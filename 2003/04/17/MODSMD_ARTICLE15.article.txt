Senior class presidential slate Fire It Up!
araues ASSU Undergraduate Senate
should certify election results immediately
During Tuesday night's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting, the Senate
passed a motion to create a committee to
investigate the technical faultiness of the
online voting system with the understand
ing that the committee will make a recom
mendation to the Senate on whether or
not to certify the election results.
We want to make it clear to the student
body and to the Senate that a recommen
dation not to certify the election results
automatically makes that part of the elec
tion "null and void." According to Article
5, Section 9 of the By-Laws of the Associ
ation, "Should circumstances warrant,
the relevant Association legislative bodies
may certify a portion of an election. The
portion not certified by the relevant Asso
ciation legislative bodies shall be null and
void."
To make changes to an election that has
been closed and after the results have been
released is absolutely unfair. A re-vote that
would result from declaring a part of an
election "null and void" would introduce

elements that cannot be measured and
would disenfranchise the entire Stanford
community. Such elements include intro
ducing new voters who otherwise would
not have voted during the time period
granted, voters changing their votes after
knowledge of the results and new strate
gies of campaigning after having knowl
edge of the numbers and results.
We agree with the three senior class
presidential slates that to disenfranchise
even one voter is a tragedy. However,
there is no way to prove that the technical
error, which resulted in the disenfran
chisement of a percentage of voters, affect
ed any one slate more than another. We,
too, heard reports from members of our
constituency who also experienced diffi
culty with the voting process and were un
able to cast their ballots for our slate. We
feel, however, that it is the responsibility of
the individual voter to report this problem
to the Elections Commission before the
election period is over and not that of the
losing slates after the results are an
nounced.
In a statement to the Senate, senior
class presidential slates BOOYAH, Senior
Citizens and Fast Forward wrote, "We
should emphasize at this point that these
concerns might be less serious had the
margin of victory in the election been sig

nificant." We disagree. If the issue at hand
is the technical problems with the voting
process, the outcome of the results —
whether the margin of victory was one
vote or 100 — is not important.
We do not think it is fair to change a past
election based on technical difficulties sim
ply because the election was close. Further
more, if the Senate decides to have a re
vote based on the committee's recommen
dation, the entire election must be re-voted
upon, based on those grounds — not just
the senior class presidential race. For ex
ample, the margin of victory for the 15th
(out of a total of 15) senator was only three
votes (712 to the 709 earned by the 16th
candidate). On the grounds upon which
the three slates are arguing, more than
three disenfranchised voters could have
been unable to submit their ballots as well.

Re-vote would set dangerous precedent
I am greatly concerned by the possibili
ty of any type of re-vote for senior class
presidents and believe that the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate should come out
strongly in favor of certifying the results of
the election.
I served as a Stanford in Government
Fellow two summers ago at the National
Labor Relations Board in Washington,
D.C. At the Board, we handled labor
union cases appealed to the federal gov
ernment. One of the more controversial
cases at the Board that summer was one in
which a union election took place, the em
ployer lost by a small margin and a door to
the election site was locked for about 30
minutes to one hour. The employer ap
pealed. 1 debated the issue substantially
with the congressionally appointed board
members including the board member for
whom I worked, who was former chair
man of the agency, and I feel that the
Board came to a strong and solid conclu
sion in its ruling.
They decided that elections, though
imperfect, are tenable and valid only inso
far as they end up final and certified. It is
remarkably common for small technical
difficulties to be present during an election
of any sort. If an election were overturned

every time there was a problem then the
election results would be far more suspect.
I his posits the problem of having contin
uous re-elections because an election can
never be perfectly run. Overturning the
election on such grounds as those seen in
the union election, or as I believe those
witnessed in the ASSU election, would cre
ate a terrible precedent for the loser to al
ways appeal almost any election. It is far
better to hold a slightly imperfect election
than to overturn an election every time the
loser feels slighted.
Additionally, I would be concerned by
any proposal to open up voting again. If
people did not vote before, then there's
no reason to allow them to vote now.
These are not disenfranchised individu
als, these are people who chose not to
vote. There is no one who was closed out
from the Web site for any short period of
time who would not have had some time
during the next 48 hours to look again at
the Web site and then vote appropriate
ly. As was decided with regard to the
NLRB case, anyone who wanted could
have simply gone to a different door or
voted again later when it was unlocked.
That the elections Web site was down for
20 minutes was an inconvenience, not a
disenfranchisement of voters.
The election was run in as fair a
manner as possible. If the ASSU is
concerned with holding fair elec
tions in the future, it should certi
fy the results of this election to en
sure that the slightest problem
does not become grounds fora re
vote in the future.

'Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions [only] for
autumn quarter?'
The addition to the Alcohol
Policy effective next year appears
to be too drastic of a change and
will most likely backfire in the face
of Residential Education at Stan
ford. Having lived in a freshman
dorm and served as a resident as
sistant, albeit in Twain, a four-class
dorm, I have witnessed that per
mitting alcohol at freshman dorm
events does effectively serve an ed
ucational value for freshman that
is carried throughout one's un
dergraduate career at Stanford, in
addition to building a relationship
with one's RAs that fosters trust,
accountability and responsibility.
Nevertheless, Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camarillo
is correct in saying, "If you do the
education proactively in the first
few days, that sets a tone." My RAs
in Cedro three years ago ab
stained from drinking in the
dorms throughout the autumn
quarter, and my fellow staff and I
at Twain last year also decided to
abstain from alcohol during the
first quarter to show that enjoying
your time at Stanford is not intrin
sically tied with alcohol.
Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions for the autumn
quarter and then allow the cur
rent policy to remain throughout
the remainder of the academic

year? That way, the "tone" will be
set at the beginning of the year but
the transition to sophomore and
subsequent years will not be so
drastic, and the proactive educa
tion can begin during the forma
tive freshman days to prevent a
mad-dash to the blurry "faded"
line during one's first days as a
sophomore.

New Alcohol Policy will promote
a 'less safe environment 7
We were deeply concerned
about tht administration's adden
dum to the alcohol policy.
Administrators claim, accord
ing to The Daily, that "allowing
drinking in freshman dormitories
is illegal, detracts from efforts to
create a safe and comfortable at
mosphere and has failed to pre
vent serious alcohol incidents."
We strongly disagree with this pol
icy on all three accounts.
Underage drinking is illegal,
but the administration should
concern itself less with enforcing
government laws and more on
ensuring the safety and lives of
students.
The University has, over the
past year, seemed to be more con
cerned with its own legal liability
than actually preventing alcohol
related injuries. In the college
campus community, strict en
forcement will promote the oppo
site outcome.
Concerning a "safe and com
fortable atmosphere," Alcohol
and Drug Educator Ralph Castro
commented that he heard from
freshmen that there was social
pressure to consume alcohol. As
current staff members in an all
frosh dorm, we certainly recog
nize this problem. But the fact of
the matter is that college students
will always have access to alcohol
and with any "forbidden" sub
stance there will always be peer
pressure associated with it. The
philosophy of Res Ed, up to this
point, has been to recognize that

reality and to create a culture
where anyone who chooses to
drink will have the knowledge of
how to do it safely. Making alco
hol more forbidden will only in
crease peer pressures and de
crease open discussion.
Moreover, enforcement of this
policy will be difficult. Whatever
the details, this policy will inevitably
create a new tension between staff
and students. This jeopardizes the
close relationship between staffand
students that is truly unique to this
university and is the best policy to
promote safety. While our peers at
other institutions often deeply dis
trust their RAs, Stanford allows the
resident staff to promote healthy
choices among freshmen in a role
of a peer adviser. This wise policy is
in danger.
Finally, this policy will not, in
our estimation, prevent serious al
cohol incidents. There will be
fewer parties with kegs at them,
and the result is that the student
drinking population, who are reg
ularly exposed to drinking before
they arrive on campus, will instead
drink in their rooms. This is the
most dangerous drinking situa
tion: there is more hard alcohol
consumed, more drinking games
and more peer pressure.
Most of the serious alcohol
problems that we've seen, both as
students and staff during our
Stanford years, come not from
parties, but from drinking in
dorm rooms. Pushing alcohol
from common areas to dorm
rooms also makes drinking be
hind closed doors more likely,
which makes it more difficult for
staff to remain aware of develop
ing problems. We were taught
from staff training that an open
drinking environment is much
safer antl experience emphatically
bears this out.
This new policy represents a
pattern of the administration fo
cusing on legal liability and what
"peer institutions" are doing over
sincere attempts to do what is best
for the unique Stanford popula
tion. The administration, it ap
pears to us, has begun (as evi

dented by the constant probation
for the Band and for fraternities) a
policy of covering itself by visibly
attac king supply of alcohol rather
than strengthening substantive ef
forts to create a healthy environ
ment for those who do or do not
drink. We strongly feel that such
efforts by the administration will
continue beyond this current poli
cy addendum and promote a less
safe environment. We urge stu
dents, especially resident staff, to
write University President John
Hennessy, University Provost
John Etchemendy and Director of
Res Ed Jane Camarillo in an effort
to reverse this policy before
tragedy strikes this campus as it
has to so many of our "peer insti
tutions."

Stanford Community Law Clinic is
not alone in serving the community
I was surprised to read in The
Daily's editorial, "Law clinic builds
local ties" (April 14), that "when
the East Palo Alto Community
Law Clinic closed last May . . . res
idents in East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Redwood City who
needed quality legal counseling
had nowhere to go."
In fact, Community Legal Ser
vices in East Palo Alto, a commu
nity-based legal clinic, opened last
September and has since been
providing free legal services in the
areas of immigration and housing
law to low-income residents.
In addition, through the Vol
unteer Attorney Program, CLS
EPA has placed clients who have
legal needs outside their scope
with local law firms who can take
the cases pro bono. The Stanford
Community Law Clinic is indeed
a valuable contribution to the
community, but it is not "fillfing]

a void."

Majority views must be respected
It is illustrative of the political
climate at Stanford that The Daily
published "Queer awareness days
being today" (April 16) one day
after a story in which a professor
decried the Catholic Church as "a
joke," due to "archaic" beliefs and
the improper actions of a very few.
What would have happened if
this professor had labeled the Jew
ish religion "a joke," due to its "ar
chaic" kosher dietary laws? Or if
this slander referred to the Muslim
religion, based on terrorist acts of
some adherents. I suspect that in
the first instance at least, the head
line would have read "Stanford
professor makes anti-semitic slur,"
and would have been followed by a
call for the professor's dismissal.
Yet this professor felt comfortable
making this remark because, as
usual, the liberal emphasis on tol
erance and diversity extends only
to views that liberals hold. Belief in
the importance of "diversity" re
quires respect for more cultures,
values and beliefs than just those
of minority groups.

Labor Relations Board in Washington,
D.C. At the Board, we handled labor
union cases appealed to the federal gov
ernment. One of the more controversial
cases at the Board that summer was one in
which a union election took place, the em
ployer lost by a small margin and a door to
the election site was locked for about 30
minutes to one hour. The employer ap
pealed. 1 debated the issue substantially
with the congressionally appointed board
members including the board member for
whom I worked, who was former chair
man of the agency, and I feel that the
Board came to a strong and solid conclu
sion in its ruling.
They decided that elections, though
imperfect, are tenable and valid only inso
far as they end up final and certified. It is
remarkably common for small technical
difficulties to be present during an election
of any sort. If an election were overturned

every time there was a problem then the
election results would be far more suspect.
I his posits the problem of having contin
uous re-elections because an election can
never be perfectly run. Overturning the
election on such grounds as those seen in
the union election, or as I believe those
witnessed in the ASSU election, would cre
ate a terrible precedent for the loser to al
ways appeal almost any election. It is far
better to hold a slightly imperfect election
than to overturn an election every time the
loser feels slighted.
Additionally, I would be concerned by
any proposal to open up voting again. If
people did not vote before, then there's
no reason to allow them to vote now.
These are not disenfranchised individu
als, these are people who chose not to
vote. There is no one who was closed out
from the Web site for any short period of
time who would not have had some time
during the next 48 hours to look again at
the Web site and then vote appropriate
ly. As was decided with regard to the
NLRB case, anyone who wanted could
have simply gone to a different door or
voted again later when it was unlocked.
That the elections Web site was down for
20 minutes was an inconvenience, not a
disenfranchisement of voters.
The election was run in as fair a
manner as possible. If the ASSU is
concerned with holding fair elec

sure that the slightest problem
does not become grounds fora re
vote in the future.

'Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions [only] for
autumn quarter?'
The addition to the Alcohol
Policy effective next year appears
to be too drastic of a change and
will most likely backfire in the face
of Residential Education at Stan
ford. Having lived in a freshman
dorm and served as a resident as
sistant, albeit in Twain, a four-class
dorm, I have witnessed that per
mitting alcohol at freshman dorm
events does effectively serve an ed
ucational value for freshman that
is carried throughout one's un
dergraduate career at Stanford, in
addition to building a relationship
with one's RAs that fosters trust,
accountability and responsibility.
Nevertheless, Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camarillo
is correct in saying, "If you do the
education proactively in the first
few days, that sets a tone." My RAs
in Cedro three years ago ab
stained from drinking in the
dorms throughout the autumn
quarter, and my fellow staff and I
at Twain last year also decided to
abstain from alcohol during the
first quarter to show that enjoying
your time at Stanford is not intrin
sically tied with alcohol.
Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions for the autumn
quarter and then allow the cur
rent policy to remain throughout
the remainder of the academic

year? That way, the "tone" will be
set at the beginning of the year but
the transition to sophomore and
subsequent years will not be so
drastic, and the proactive educa
tion can begin during the forma
tive freshman days to prevent a
mad-dash to the blurry "faded"
line during one's first days as a
sophomore.

New Alcohol Policy will promote
a 'less safe environment 7
We were deeply concerned
about tht administration's adden
dum to the alcohol policy.
Administrators claim, accord
ing to The Daily, that "allowing
drinking in freshman dormitories
is illegal, detracts from efforts to
create a safe and comfortable at
mosphere and has failed to pre
vent serious alcohol incidents."
We strongly disagree with this pol
icy on all three accounts.
Underage drinking is illegal,
but the administration should
concern itself less with enforcing
government laws and more on
ensuring the safety and lives of
students.
The University has, over the
past year, seemed to be more con
cerned with its own legal liability
than actually preventing alcohol
related injuries. In the college
campus community, strict en
forcement will promote the oppo
site outcome.
Concerning a "safe and com
fortable atmosphere," Alcohol
and Drug Educator Ralph Castro
commented that he heard from
freshmen that there was social
pressure to consume alcohol. As
current staff members in an all
frosh dorm, we certainly recog
nize this problem. But the fact of
the matter is that college students
will always have access to alcohol
and with any "forbidden" sub
stance there will always be peer
pressure associated with it. The
philosophy of Res Ed, up to this
point, has been to recognize that

reality and to create a culture
where anyone who chooses to
drink will have the knowledge of
how to do it safely. Making alco
hol more forbidden will only in
crease peer pressures and de
crease open discussion.
Moreover, enforcement of this
policy will be difficult. Whatever
the details, this policy will inevitably
create a new tension between staff
and students. This jeopardizes the
close relationship between staffand
students that is truly unique to this
university and is the best policy to
promote safety. While our peers at
other institutions often deeply dis
trust their RAs, Stanford allows the
resident staff to promote healthy
choices among freshmen in a role
of a peer adviser. This wise policy is
in danger.
Finally, this policy will not, in
our estimation, prevent serious al
cohol incidents. There will be
fewer parties with kegs at them,
and the result is that the student
drinking population, who are reg
ularly exposed to drinking before
they arrive on campus, will instead
drink in their rooms. This is the
most dangerous drinking situa
tion: there is more hard alcohol
consumed, more drinking games
and more peer pressure.
Most of the serious alcohol
problems that we've seen, both as
students and staff during our
Stanford years, come not from
parties, but from drinking in
dorm rooms. Pushing alcohol
from common areas to dorm
rooms also makes drinking be
hind closed doors more likely,
which makes it more difficult for
staff to remain aware of develop
ing problems. We were taught
from staff training that an open
drinking environment is much
safer antl experience emphatically
bears this out.
This new policy represents a
pattern of the administration fo
cusing on legal liability and what
"peer institutions" are doing over
sincere attempts to do what is best
for the unique Stanford popula
tion. The administration, it ap
pears to us, has begun (as evi

dented by the constant probation
for the Band and for fraternities) a
policy of covering itself by visibly
attac king supply of alcohol rather
than strengthening substantive ef
forts to create a healthy environ
ment for those who do or do not
drink. We strongly feel that such
efforts by the administration will
continue beyond this current poli
cy addendum and promote a less
safe environment. We urge stu
dents, especially resident staff, to
write University President John
Hennessy, University Provost
John Etchemendy and Director of
Res Ed Jane Camarillo in an effort
to reverse this policy before
tragedy strikes this campus as it
has to so many of our "peer insti
tutions."

Stanford Community Law Clinic is
not alone in serving the community
I was surprised to read in The
Daily's editorial, "Law clinic builds
local ties" (April 14), that "when
the East Palo Alto Community
Law Clinic closed last May . . . res
idents in East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Redwood City who
needed quality legal counseling
had nowhere to go."
In fact, Community Legal Ser
vices in East Palo Alto, a commu
nity-based legal clinic, opened last
September and has since been
providing free legal services in the
areas of immigration and housing
law to low-income residents.
In addition, through the Vol
unteer Attorney Program, CLS
EPA has placed clients who have
legal needs outside their scope
with local law firms who can take
the cases pro bono. The Stanford
Community Law Clinic is indeed
a valuable contribution to the
community, but it is not "fillfing]

a void."

Majority views must be respected
It is illustrative of the political
climate at Stanford that The Daily
published "Queer awareness days
being today" (April 16) one day
after a story in which a professor
decried the Catholic Church as "a
joke," due to "archaic" beliefs and
the improper actions of a very few.
What would have happened if
this professor had labeled the Jew
ish religion "a joke," due to its "ar
chaic" kosher dietary laws? Or if
this slander referred to the Muslim
religion, based on terrorist acts of
some adherents. I suspect that in
the first instance at least, the head
line would have read "Stanford
professor makes anti-semitic slur,"
and would have been followed by a
call for the professor's dismissal.
Yet this professor felt comfortable
making this remark because, as
usual, the liberal emphasis on tol
erance and diversity extends only
to views that liberals hold. Belief in
the importance of "diversity" re
quires respect for more cultures,
values and beliefs than just those
of minority groups.

Senior class presidential slate Fire It Up!
araues ASSU Undergraduate Senate
should certify election results immediately
During Tuesday night's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting, the Senate
passed a motion to create a committee to
investigate the technical faultiness of the
online voting system with the understand
ing that the committee will make a recom
mendation to the Senate on whether or
not to certify the election results.
We want to make it clear to the student
body and to the Senate that a recommen
dation not to certify the election results
automatically makes that part of the elec
tion "null and void." According to Article
5, Section 9 of the By-Laws of the Associ
ation, "Should circumstances warrant,
the relevant Association legislative bodies
may certify a portion of an election. The
portion not certified by the relevant Asso
ciation legislative bodies shall be null and
void."
To make changes to an election that has
been closed and after the results have been
released is absolutely unfair. A re-vote that
would result from declaring a part of an
election "null and void" would introduce

elements that cannot be measured and
would disenfranchise the entire Stanford
community. Such elements include intro
ducing new voters who otherwise would
not have voted during the time period
granted, voters changing their votes after
knowledge of the results and new strate
gies of campaigning after having knowl
edge of the numbers and results.
We agree with the three senior class
presidential slates that to disenfranchise
even one voter is a tragedy. However,
there is no way to prove that the technical
error, which resulted in the disenfran
chisement of a percentage of voters, affect
ed any one slate more than another. We,
too, heard reports from members of our
constituency who also experienced diffi
culty with the voting process and were un
able to cast their ballots for our slate. We
feel, however, that it is the responsibility of
the individual voter to report this problem
to the Elections Commission before the
election period is over and not that of the
losing slates after the results are an
nounced.
In a statement to the Senate, senior
class presidential slates BOOYAH, Senior
Citizens and Fast Forward wrote, "We
should emphasize at this point that these
concerns might be less serious had the
margin of victory in the election been sig

nificant." We disagree. If the issue at hand
is the technical problems with the voting
process, the outcome of the results —
whether the margin of victory was one
vote or 100 — is not important.
We do not think it is fair to change a past
election based on technical difficulties sim
ply because the election was close. Further
more, if the Senate decides to have a re
vote based on the committee's recommen
dation, the entire election must be re-voted
upon, based on those grounds — not just
the senior class presidential race. For ex
ample, the margin of victory for the 15th
(out of a total of 15) senator was only three
votes (712 to the 709 earned by the 16th
candidate). On the grounds upon which
the three slates are arguing, more than
three disenfranchised voters could have
been unable to submit their ballots as well.

New Alcohol Policy will promote
a 'less safe environment 7
We were deeply concerned
about tht administration's adden
dum to the alcohol policy.
Administrators claim, accord
ing to The Daily, that "allowing
drinking in freshman dormitories
is illegal, detracts from efforts to
create a safe and comfortable at
mosphere and has failed to pre
vent serious alcohol incidents."
We strongly disagree with this pol
icy on all three accounts.
Underage drinking is illegal,
but the administration should
concern itself less with enforcing
government laws and more on
ensuring the safety and lives of
students.
The University has, over the
past year, seemed to be more con
cerned with its own legal liability
than actually preventing alcohol
related injuries. In the college
campus community, strict en
forcement will promote the oppo
site outcome.
Concerning a "safe and com
fortable atmosphere," Alcohol
and Drug Educator Ralph Castro
commented that he heard from
freshmen that there was social
pressure to consume alcohol. As
current staff members in an all
frosh dorm, we certainly recog
nize this problem. But the fact of
the matter is that college students
will always have access to alcohol
and with any "forbidden" sub
stance there will always be peer
pressure associated with it. The
philosophy of Res Ed, up to this
point, has been to recognize that

reality and to create a culture
where anyone who chooses to
drink will have the knowledge of
how to do it safely. Making alco
hol more forbidden will only in
crease peer pressures and de
crease open discussion.
Moreover, enforcement of this
policy will be difficult. Whatever
the details, this policy will inevitably
create a new tension between staff
and students. This jeopardizes the
close relationship between staffand
students that is truly unique to this
university and is the best policy to
promote safety. While our peers at
other institutions often deeply dis
trust their RAs, Stanford allows the
resident staff to promote healthy
choices among freshmen in a role
of a peer adviser. This wise policy is
in danger.
Finally, this policy will not, in
our estimation, prevent serious al
cohol incidents. There will be
fewer parties with kegs at them,
and the result is that the student
drinking population, who are reg
ularly exposed to drinking before
they arrive on campus, will instead
drink in their rooms. This is the
most dangerous drinking situa
tion: there is more hard alcohol
consumed, more drinking games
and more peer pressure.
Most of the serious alcohol
problems that we've seen, both as
students and staff during our
Stanford years, come not from
parties, but from drinking in
dorm rooms. Pushing alcohol
from common areas to dorm
rooms also makes drinking be
hind closed doors more likely,
which makes it more difficult for
staff to remain aware of develop
ing problems. We were taught
from staff training that an open
drinking environment is much
safer antl experience emphatically
bears this out.
This new policy represents a
pattern of the administration fo
cusing on legal liability and what
"peer institutions" are doing over
sincere attempts to do what is best
for the unique Stanford popula
tion. The administration, it ap
pears to us, has begun (as evi

dented by the constant probation
for the Band and for fraternities) a
policy of covering itself by visibly
attac king supply of alcohol rather
than strengthening substantive ef
forts to create a healthy environ
ment for those who do or do not
drink. We strongly feel that such
efforts by the administration will
continue beyond this current poli
cy addendum and promote a less
safe environment. We urge stu
dents, especially resident staff, to
write University President John
Hennessy, University Provost
John Etchemendy and Director of
Res Ed Jane Camarillo in an effort
to reverse this policy before
tragedy strikes this campus as it
has to so many of our "peer insti
tutions."

Stanford Community Law Clinic is
not alone in serving the community
I was surprised to read in The
Daily's editorial, "Law clinic builds
local ties" (April 14), that "when
the East Palo Alto Community
Law Clinic closed last May . . . res
idents in East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Redwood City who
needed quality legal counseling
had nowhere to go."
In fact, Community Legal Ser
vices in East Palo Alto, a commu
nity-based legal clinic, opened last
September and has since been
providing free legal services in the
areas of immigration and housing
law to low-income residents.
In addition, through the Vol
unteer Attorney Program, CLS
EPA has placed clients who have
legal needs outside their scope
with local law firms who can take
the cases pro bono. The Stanford
Community Law Clinic is indeed
a valuable contribution to the
community, but it is not "fillfing]

a void."

Majority views must be respected
It is illustrative of the political
climate at Stanford that The Daily
published "Queer awareness days
being today" (April 16) one day
after a story in which a professor
decried the Catholic Church as "a
joke," due to "archaic" beliefs and
the improper actions of a very few.
What would have happened if
this professor had labeled the Jew
ish religion "a joke," due to its "ar
chaic" kosher dietary laws? Or if
this slander referred to the Muslim
religion, based on terrorist acts of
some adherents. I suspect that in
the first instance at least, the head
line would have read "Stanford
professor makes anti-semitic slur,"
and would have been followed by a
call for the professor's dismissal.
Yet this professor felt comfortable
making this remark because, as
usual, the liberal emphasis on tol
erance and diversity extends only
to views that liberals hold. Belief in
the importance of "diversity" re
quires respect for more cultures,
values and beliefs than just those
of minority groups.

Senior class presidential slate Fire It Up!
araues ASSU Undergraduate Senate
should certify election results immediately
During Tuesday night's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting, the Senate
passed a motion to create a committee to
investigate the technical faultiness of the
online voting system with the understand
ing that the committee will make a recom
mendation to the Senate on whether or
not to certify the election results.
We want to make it clear to the student
body and to the Senate that a recommen
dation not to certify the election results
automatically makes that part of the elec
tion "null and void." According to Article
5, Section 9 of the By-Laws of the Associ
ation, "Should circumstances warrant,
the relevant Association legislative bodies
may certify a portion of an election. The
portion not certified by the relevant Asso
ciation legislative bodies shall be null and
void."
To make changes to an election that has
been closed and after the results have been
released is absolutely unfair. A re-vote that
would result from declaring a part of an
election "null and void" would introduce

elements that cannot be measured and
would disenfranchise the entire Stanford
community. Such elements include intro
ducing new voters who otherwise would
not have voted during the time period
granted, voters changing their votes after
knowledge of the results and new strate
gies of campaigning after having knowl
edge of the numbers and results.
We agree with the three senior class
presidential slates that to disenfranchise
even one voter is a tragedy. However,
there is no way to prove that the technical
error, which resulted in the disenfran
chisement of a percentage of voters, affect
ed any one slate more than another. We,
too, heard reports from members of our
constituency who also experienced diffi
culty with the voting process and were un
able to cast their ballots for our slate. We
feel, however, that it is the responsibility of
the individual voter to report this problem
to the Elections Commission before the
election period is over and not that of the
losing slates after the results are an
nounced.
In a statement to the Senate, senior
class presidential slates BOOYAH, Senior
Citizens and Fast Forward wrote, "We
should emphasize at this point that these
concerns might be less serious had the
margin of victory in the election been sig

nificant." We disagree. If the issue at hand
is the technical problems with the voting
process, the outcome of the results —
whether the margin of victory was one
vote or 100 — is not important.
We do not think it is fair to change a past
election based on technical difficulties sim
ply because the election was close. Further
more, if the Senate decides to have a re
vote based on the committee's recommen
dation, the entire election must be re-voted
upon, based on those grounds — not just
the senior class presidential race. For ex
ample, the margin of victory for the 15th
(out of a total of 15) senator was only three
votes (712 to the 709 earned by the 16th
candidate). On the grounds upon which
the three slates are arguing, more than
three disenfranchised voters could have
been unable to submit their ballots as well.

Re-vote would set dangerous precedent
I am greatly concerned by the possibili
ty of any type of re-vote for senior class
presidents and believe that the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate should come out
strongly in favor of certifying the results of
the election.
I served as a Stanford in Government
Fellow two summers ago at the National
Labor Relations Board in Washington,
D.C. At the Board, we handled labor
union cases appealed to the federal gov
ernment. One of the more controversial
cases at the Board that summer was one in
which a union election took place, the em
ployer lost by a small margin and a door to
the election site was locked for about 30
minutes to one hour. The employer ap
pealed. 1 debated the issue substantially
with the congressionally appointed board
members including the board member for
whom I worked, who was former chair
man of the agency, and I feel that the
Board came to a strong and solid conclu
sion in its ruling.
They decided that elections, though
imperfect, are tenable and valid only inso
far as they end up final and certified. It is
remarkably common for small technical
difficulties to be present during an election
of any sort. If an election were overturned

every time there was a problem then the
election results would be far more suspect.
I his posits the problem of having contin
uous re-elections because an election can
never be perfectly run. Overturning the
election on such grounds as those seen in
the union election, or as I believe those
witnessed in the ASSU election, would cre
ate a terrible precedent for the loser to al
ways appeal almost any election. It is far
better to hold a slightly imperfect election
than to overturn an election every time the
loser feels slighted.
Additionally, I would be concerned by
any proposal to open up voting again. If
people did not vote before, then there's
no reason to allow them to vote now.
These are not disenfranchised individu
als, these are people who chose not to
vote. There is no one who was closed out
from the Web site for any short period of
time who would not have had some time
during the next 48 hours to look again at
the Web site and then vote appropriate
ly. As was decided with regard to the
NLRB case, anyone who wanted could
have simply gone to a different door or
voted again later when it was unlocked.
That the elections Web site was down for
20 minutes was an inconvenience, not a
disenfranchisement of voters.
The election was run in as fair a
manner as possible. If the ASSU is
concerned with holding fair elec
tions in the future, it should certi
fy the results of this election to en
sure that the slightest problem
does not become grounds fora re
vote in the future.

'Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions [only] for
autumn quarter?'
The addition to the Alcohol
Policy effective next year appears
to be too drastic of a change and
will most likely backfire in the face
of Residential Education at Stan
ford. Having lived in a freshman
dorm and served as a resident as
sistant, albeit in Twain, a four-class
dorm, I have witnessed that per
mitting alcohol at freshman dorm
events does effectively serve an ed
ucational value for freshman that
is carried throughout one's un
dergraduate career at Stanford, in
addition to building a relationship
with one's RAs that fosters trust,
accountability and responsibility.
Nevertheless, Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camarillo
is correct in saying, "If you do the
education proactively in the first
few days, that sets a tone." My RAs
in Cedro three years ago ab
stained from drinking in the
dorms throughout the autumn
quarter, and my fellow staff and I
at Twain last year also decided to
abstain from alcohol during the
first quarter to show that enjoying
your time at Stanford is not intrin
sically tied with alcohol.
Why not prohibit alcohol from
all-frosh functions for the autumn
quarter and then allow the cur
rent policy to remain throughout
the remainder of the academic

year? That way, the "tone" will be
set at the beginning of the year but
the transition to sophomore and

policy of covering itself by visibly
attac king supply of alcohol rather
than strengthening substantive ef
forts to create a healthy environ
ment for those who do or do not
drink. We strongly feel that such
efforts by the administration will
continue beyond this current poli
cy addendum and promote a less
safe environment. We urge stu
dents, especially resident staff, to
write University President John
Hennessy, University Provost
John Etchemendy and Director of

to reverse this policy before
tragedy strikes this campus as it
has to so many of our "peer insti

Stanford Community Law Clinic is
not alone in serving the community
I was surprised to read in The
Daily's editorial, "Law clinic builds
local ties" (April 14), that "when
the East Palo Alto Community
Law Clinic closed last May . . . res
idents in East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Redwood City who
needed quality legal counseling
had nowhere to go."
In fact, Community Legal Ser
vices in East Palo Alto, a commu
nity-based legal clinic, opened last
September and has since been
providing free legal services in the
areas of immigration and housing
law to low-income residents.
In addition, through the Vol
unteer Attorney Program, CLS
EPA has placed clients who have
legal needs outside their scope
with local law firms who can take
the cases pro bono. The Stanford
Community Law Clinic is indeed
a valuable contribution to the
community, but it is not "fillfing]

a void."

Majority views must be respected
It is illustrative of the political
climate at Stanford that The Daily
published "Queer awareness days
being today" (April 16) one day
after a story in which a professor
decried the Catholic Church as "a
joke," due to "archaic" beliefs and
the improper actions of a very few.
What would have happened if
this professor had labeled the Jew
ish religion "a joke," due to its "ar
chaic" kosher dietary laws? Or if
this slander referred to the Muslim
religion, based on terrorist acts of
some adherents. I suspect that in
the first instance at least, the head
line would have read "Stanford
professor makes anti-semitic slur,"
and would have been followed by a
call for the professor's dismissal.
Yet this professor felt comfortable
making this remark because, as
usual, the liberal emphasis on tol
erance and diversity extends only
to views that liberals hold. Belief in
the importance of "diversity" re
quires respect for more cultures,
values and beliefs than just those
of minority groups.
