Senior class presidential slate Fire It Up!
araues ASSU Undergraduate Senate
should certify election results immediately
During Tuesday night's ASSU Under
graduate Senate meeting, the Senate
passed a motion to create a committee to
investigate the technical faultiness of the
online voting system with the understand
ing that the committee will make a recom
mendation to the Senate on whether or
not to certify the election results.
We want to make it clear to the student
body and to the Senate that a recommen
dation not to certify the election results
automatically makes that part of the elec
tion "null and void." According to Article
5, Section 9 of the By-Laws of the Associ
ation, "Should circumstances warrant,
the relevant Association legislative bodies
may certify a portion of an election. The
portion not certified by the relevant Asso
ciation legislative bodies shall be null and
void."
To make changes to an election that has
been closed and after the results have been
released is absolutely unfair. A re-vote that
would result from declaring a part of an
election "null and void" would introduce

elements that cannot be measured and
would disenfranchise the entire Stanford
community. Such elements include intro
ducing new voters who otherwise would
not have voted during the time period
granted, voters changing their votes after
knowledge of the results and new strate
gies of campaigning after having knowl
edge of the numbers and results.
We agree with the three senior class
presidential slates that to disenfranchise
even one voter is a tragedy. However,
there is no way to prove that the technical
error, which resulted in the disenfran
chisement of a percentage of voters, affect
ed any one slate more than another. We,
too, heard reports from members of our
constituency who also experienced diffi
culty with the voting process and were un
able to cast their ballots for our slate. We
feel, however, that it is the responsibility of
the individual voter to report this problem
to the Elections Commission before the
election period is over and not that of the
losing slates after the results are an
nounced.
In a statement to the Senate, senior
class presidential slates BOOYAH, Senior
Citizens and Fast Forward wrote, "We
should emphasize at this point that these
concerns might be less serious had the
margin of victory in the election been sig

nificant." We disagree. If the issue at hand
is the technical problems with the voting
process, the outcome of the results —
whether the margin of victory was one
vote or 100 — is not important.
We do not think it is fair to change a past
election based on technical difficulties sim
ply because the election was close. Further
more, if the Senate decides to have a re
vote based on the committee's recommen
dation, the entire election must be re-voted
upon, based on those grounds — not just
the senior class presidential race. For ex
ample, the margin of victory for the 15th
(out of a total of 15) senator was only three
votes (712 to the 709 earned by the 16th
candidate). On the grounds upon which
the three slates are arguing, more than
three disenfranchised voters could have
been unable to submit their ballots as well.

Re-vote would set dangerous precedent
I am greatly concerned by the possibili
ty of any type of re-vote for senior class
presidents and believe that the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate should come out
strongly in favor of certifying the results of
the election.
I served as a Stanford in Government
Fellow two summers ago at the National
Labor Relations Board in Washington,
D.C. At the Board, we handled labor
union cases appealed to the federal gov
ernment. One of the more controversial
cases at the Board that summer was one in
which a union election took place, the em
ployer lost by a small margin and a door to
the election site was locked for about 30
minutes to one hour. The employer ap
pealed. 1 debated the issue substantially
with the congressionally appointed board
members including the board member for
whom I worked, who was former chair
man of the agency, and I feel that the
Board came to a strong and solid conclu
sion in its ruling.
They decided that elections, though
imperfect, are tenable and valid only inso
far as they end up final and certified. It is
remarkably common for small technical
difficulties to be present during an election
of any sort. If an election were overturned

every time there was a problem then the
election results would be far more suspect.
I his posits the problem of having contin
uous re-elections because an election can
never be perfectly run. Overturning the
election on such grounds as those seen in
the union election, or as I believe those
witnessed in the ASSU election, would cre
ate a terrible precedent for the loser to al
ways appeal almost any election. It is far
better to hold a slightly imperfect election
than to overturn an election every time the
loser feels slighted.
Additionally, I would be concerned by
any proposal to open up voting again. If
people did not vote before, then there's
no reason to allow them to vote now.
These are not disenfranchised individu
als, these are people who chose not to
vote. There is no one who was closed out
from the Web site for any short period of
time who would not have had some time
during the next 48 hours to look again at
the Web site and then vote appropriate
ly. As was decided with regard to the
NLRB case, anyone who wanted could
have simply gone to a different door or
voted again later when it was unlocked.
That the elections Web site was down for
20 minutes was an inconvenience, not a
