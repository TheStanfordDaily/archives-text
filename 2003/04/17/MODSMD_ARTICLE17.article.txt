"This weekend's competition
will serve a variety of purposes,"
said Vin Lananna, director of track
and field. "Our most important ob

many athletes as possible for the
NCAA Regional Championships.
"Since some of the athletes will
be competing on multiple days, it
will provide them with an opportu
nity to simulate the Trials and Fi
nals of both the Conference and
Regional Championships."
The Cardinal is hoping to have
most of its regional qualifying
needs met by the end of this week
end so it can light up the track at
the Drake Relays and the Big Meet
the next two weekends.
