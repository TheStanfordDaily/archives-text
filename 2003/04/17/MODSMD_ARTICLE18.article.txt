# Jordan suffers from classic sports angst
## 
### 
First of all, let us give
lhanks and praise that
the NBA regular season
is over, making it a math
ematical certainty that the
Nuggets cannot possibly lose any
more games this season.
Another season of futility
down the tubes.
(Please, NBA lottery gods, give
them Leßron James. It's the only
chance they have).
On the other side of the NBA
coin, of course, is MJ. Granted, in
his time with the Wizards he's
had the uniquely "Nuggetian"
experience of losing a few times a
week. But, putting that aside, it's
clear that there are very few
things that the two have in com
mon.
And so, with last night being
(at least for now), Jordan's last
game, it makes me wish, just a lit
tle, that I had been more of a bas
ketball fan. That I had seen more
of his games, had a poster or a
Trapper Keeper with his picture,
convinced my parents that I

needed a pair of
Air Jordans
growing up.
I saw him play
once, as he tore
up the Nuggets
in the old McNi
chols Arena
downtown. I
think the final

score was MJ 48, Denver 61. The
rest of the Bulls were able to
cover the 13 points to snake the
win.
Of course, the problem with
someone's third retirement is
that it's lost some of the emotion.
It's a common curse in sports —
the inability of an athlete to leave
the sport he or she loves.
Sometimes the love for the
game makes athletes hang
around for decades, unable to re
tire and walk away from the
sport. It happened to Willie
Mays, who was still lacing up the
cleats at 40 and struggling to imi


Matt Babin
tate the old glory that was once
his standard calling card.
Perhaps some of the difficulty
comes from the personal pride
involved. For in sports, more
than in any other profession, re
tirement could be the admission
that you have lost something you
once possessed. That you can't do
something you used to be able to
do. You can't hit the curveball
anymore. You can't beat the
press, run the power play, cover
the receiver on a deep post.
You've lost a step.
Of course, some athletes rec
ognize this fact at the zenith of
their accomplishments by some
stroke of fate, a gift from the
gods. Ray Bourque did it when
he escaped Boston to chase the
elusive Stanley Cup with the Avs,

then walk away from professional
hockey forever. John Elway (and
yes, here you see my hometown
bias again) was able to ride off
into the sunset with his two rings,
one ACL and one bicep tendon —
and never look back.
Strike that — maybe he did
look back. (He did, after all, buy
the damn Arena team). But he
didn't look back publicly. He
didn't tease us with rumors of
comebacks, with trysts in minor
league baseball. He told us thanks
for the memories and then left us
with them.
But with Jordan we've seen
something altogether different.
And so as we reflect, now, the
morning of the third retirement,
there is a little doubt in the back
of our minds — is he really done?
How many "farewell tours"
around the league can you have?
How many Sports Centuries on
late-night ESPN and gifts from
opposing teams can be presented

to you the third time around?
How, exactly, can you say good
bye to someone who won't leave?
This is a little like the boy who
cried wolf, only with millionaires.
I don't mean to take anything
away from a fantastic career. I've
loved the dunks, the fadeaways,
the way his arm hung up there
against the Jazz the way my
Beirut partner leaves his wrist up
in the air after launching the final
ping pong ball into the last cup
for the win . . . but I digress.
So MJ, if you really are retiring
this time — thanks for the memo
ries, for the first Dream Team, for
beating the crap out of the
Nuggets, for giving it a shot with
the Wiz. But no thanks for string
ing us along like this. If you're
gonna go — go.
