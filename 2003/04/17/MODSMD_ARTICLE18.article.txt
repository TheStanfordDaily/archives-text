# Jordan suffers from classic sports angst

### 
First of all, let us give
lhanks and praise that
the NBA regular season
is over, making it a math
ematical certainty that the
Nuggets cannot possibly lose any
more games this season.
Another season of futility
down the tubes.
(Please, NBA lottery gods, give
them Leßron James. It's the only
chance they have).
On the other side of the NBA
coin, of course, is MJ. Granted, in
his time with the Wizards he's
had the uniquely "Nuggetian"
experience of losing a few times a
week. But, putting that aside, it's
clear that there are very few
things that the two have in com

And so, with last night being
(at least for now), Jordan's last
game, it makes me wish, just a lit

ketball fan. That I had seen more
of his games, had a poster or a
Trapper Keeper with his picture,
convinced my parents that I

needed a pair of
Air Jordans
growing up.
I saw him play
once, as he tore
up the Nuggets
in the old McNi
chols Arena
downtown. I
think the final

score was MJ 48, Denver 61. The
rest of the Bulls were able to
cover the 13 points to snake the
win.
Of course, the problem with
someone's third retirement is
that it's lost some of the emotion.
It's a common curse in sports —
the inability of an athlete to leave
the sport he or she loves.
Sometimes the love for the
game makes athletes hang
around for decades, unable to re
tire and walk away from the
sport. It happened to Willie
Mays, who was still lacing up the
cleats at 40 and struggling to imi
