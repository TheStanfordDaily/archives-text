# Coaches don't live up to own standards
## 
### 
When Roy Williams decided on
Monday to leave Kansas to coach
basketball at his alma mater,
North Carolina, he was doing
more than returning to his roots. He was
demonstrating, once again, that the grass is al
ways greener on the other side for high-profile
college coaches.
More than perhaps any sport, college basket
ball has a detailed, extensive hierarchy of jobs.
Williams took thejayhawks to the Final Four for
the second straight time this year, yet Williams
and everyone else knows that the gig in Chapel
Hill is a "better" job.
The instant Williams was gone, the spotlight
turned to 41-year-old Bill Self, who has already
coached at Oral Roberts (four years), Tulsa
(three years) and now Illinois. The Illini are a

consistent Top-25 team which
the aptly named Self has been
coaching fora scant two years,
but he immediately came up as
the most likely candidate to fill
Williams' vacancy.
Here at Stanford, where
Mike Montgomery has gra
ciously chosen to build a pro
gram and stick with it, it's easy to

forget the madness that takes hold of men's col
lege basketball every offseason. A single firing or
departure often results in a domino effect, as
several coaches move one rung up the ladder.
Williams heads to UNC, so Self or some other
up-and-comer heads to KU, giving the next tal
ented young coach his first major-program op
portunity.

And the thing is, this happens all the time.
The fact that Williams lasted 15 years in
Lawrence, and even turned down UNC's over
tures three years ago when they also had a head
coaching vacancy, is remarkable in itself.
Staying 15 years in one place exposes your
talents. To last that long at a major-program
school requires fortitude, program-building
and more than a few lucky years. It takes a gen
uinely talented coach, able to consistently re
cruit, deal with early jumpers to the NBA, in
juries and troublemakers and not get tired or
lose focus.
It's a whole lot easier to bounce from school
to school like Jim Harrick did, staying long
enough to make the tournament a few times
