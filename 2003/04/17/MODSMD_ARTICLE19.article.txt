# Coaches don't live up to own standards
## 
### 
When Roy Williams decided on
Monday to leave Kansas to coach
basketball at his alma mater,
North Carolina, he was doing
more than returning to his roots. He was
demonstrating, once again, that the grass is al
ways greener on the other side for high-profile
college coaches.
More than perhaps any sport, college basket
ball has a detailed, extensive hierarchy of jobs.
Williams took thejayhawks to the Final Four for
the second straight time this year, yet Williams
and everyone else knows that the gig in Chapel
Hill is a "better" job.
The instant Williams was gone, the spotlight
turned to 41-year-old Bill Self, who has already
coached at Oral Roberts (four years), Tulsa
(three years) and now Illinois. The Illini are a

consistent Top-25 team which
the aptly named Self has been
coaching fora scant two years,
but he immediately came up as
the most likely candidate to fill
Williams' vacancy.
Here at Stanford, where
Mike Montgomery has gra
ciously chosen to build a pro
gram and stick with it, it's easy to

forget the madness that takes hold of men's col
lege basketball every offseason. A single firing or
departure often results in a domino effect, as
several coaches move one rung up the ladder.
Williams heads to UNC, so Self or some other
up-and-comer heads to KU, giving the next tal
ented young coach his first major-program op
portunity.

And the thing is, this happens all the time.
The fact that Williams lasted 15 years in
Lawrence, and even turned down UNC's over
tures three years ago when they also had a head
coaching vacancy, is remarkable in itself.
Staying 15 years in one place exposes your
talents. To last that long at a major-program
school requires fortitude, program-building
and more than a few lucky years. It takes a gen
uinely talented coach, able to consistently re
cruit, deal with early jumpers to the NBA, in
juries and troublemakers and not get tired or
lose focus.
It's a whole lot easier to bounce from school
to school like Jim Harrick did, staying long
enough to make the tournament a few times


Mark Thoma
and keep your name prominent in
the job market each offseason. You
leave for the big payday before
questionable coaching wears down
your players or shady recruiting
methods catch up with you.
Everyone and their uncle likes
to bag on college bailers who jump
to the NBA early. The people who
make their living off of hyping col
lege basketball want the NCAA to
get its full four years out of their
best players, and if those players
should get a degree while they're
not creating revenue, well, that's
nice too.
College coaches, though, are
often just as "guilty" as t heir play
ers of looking out for their own in
terests. Roy Williams is smiling, but
Wayne Simien is fuming, his arm
in a sling due to a series of shoulder

problems. Simien commented
about Williams, "I gave my right
arm for him, literally."
Simien, a sophomore, was
wooed to Lawrence with the
promise of suiting up fora cham
pionship contender and playing
for the renowned and respected
Williams. He got both of those
things. Hut it's understandably dif
ficult to dedicate yourself to a bas
ketball program and then have
your coach tell yon that he found
one he likes better and that you'll
have to do without him.
Williams himself was in Simien's
shoes a year ago at this time, as ju
nior phenom Drew Gooden told
his coach that he was going to
forego his senior season and head
to the NBA. It works both ways,
and it hurts both ways.
Coaches need their players to
win games for them, and players
need their coaches to help them
improve their game. The problem
with this is that the more successful

the collaboration is, the more likely
it is to fall apart prematurely.
Williams gave Gooden an oppor
tunity to shine and coached him
into a more disciplined, funda
mentally sound player. Players like
Gooden helped make Williams
into North Carolina's must-have
coach.
Basketball is a team sport, but as
the actions of Williams (and Good
en) show, life is an individual activ
ity. Players, coaches and adminis
trators alike almost always end up
doing what they think is best for
themselves. The University of
Kansas, past and present Jayhawks
and Roy Williams should just be
grateful that their arrangement
lasted so long and worked out so
well for Williams, his ex-players
and the KU program.

in history who really appreciates Mike
Montgomery right about now. Email

have to do without him.
Williams himself was in Simien's
shoes a year ago at this time, as ju
nior phenom Drew Gooden told
his coach that he was going to
forego his senior season and head
to the NBA. It works both ways,
and it hurts both ways.
Coaches need their players to
win games for them, and players
need their coaches to help them
improve their game. The problem
with this is that the more successful

the collaboration is, the more likely
it is to fall apart prematurely.
Williams gave Gooden an oppor
tunity to shine and coached him
into a more disciplined, funda
mentally sound player. Players like
Gooden helped make Williams
into North Carolina's must-have
coach.
Basketball is a team sport, but as
the actions of Williams (and Good
en) show, life is an individual activ
ity. Players, coaches and adminis
trators alike almost always end up
doing what they think is best for
themselves. The University of
Kansas, past and present Jayhawks
and Roy Williams should just be
grateful that their arrangement
lasted so long and worked out so
well for Williams, his ex-players
and the KU program.
