# ASSU members discuss reforms for special fees
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week, 61 groups asked the student body to
approve their bids to receive ASSU special fees. If all
were approved, the special-fee levy for the next aca
demic year would have totaled almost $225. Of the
61 groups that went to ballot, only four were denied,
leaving undergraduates with an annual special-fee
bill of just over $206.
Special fees represent a convenient way for
groups with many members and large budgets to re
ceive funding from the entire student population.
However, concern is growing that as special-fee costs
continue to rise — in the past five years alone, the
number of groups requesting special fees has nearly
doubled — more students will request refunds from
the ASSU.
Worried by the effects of the soaring cost of the
special-fee bill and student tendencies to approve
nearly all bids for special fees, many in the ASSU now
see a need for reforms in the process to ensure that
it remains sustainable and effective.
ASSU trims budgets
Before a group appears on the ballot, it must meet
with the ASSU Undergraduate Senate Appropria
tions Committee, which reviews the group's budget.
The committee has certain guidelines for expendi
tures and seeks to streamline each organization's
budget so that the special fee requested is reason
able.
"We trim down budgets," said sophomore Josh
Shipp, co-chair of the committee. "We have a lot of
experience dealing with student groups and how
they end up spending money."
Shipp explained that the Appropriations Com
mittee holds groups to certain budgeted amounts for
activities in order to make sure budget requests re
main reasonable.
"We have a number of policies for things like
food, copies, etc.," he said. "For food, we allow $8 a
person fora catered dinner event, and that was a
point of much consternation for the black student
community because they had budgeted $22 a person
for their soul food dinner and their Kwanzaa cele
bration. Some people say that we shouldn't be ap
plying these policies, but we try to bring the most
reasonable budget possible to the student popula
tion."
Subsequently, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
votes on all requests for special fees from the under
graduate community. The Graduate Student Coun
cil has a parallel structure for groups requesting
funding from graduate students.
Increased fee requests problematic
"We're really concerned about special fees grow
ing to the point where it's going to collapse on itself,"
Shipp said. "We have so many valuable groups,
there has to be a point where some of them can't re
ceive special fees.
"The tricky thing is that a lot of students vote for
all the special-fee groups and then go get there-
