# ASSU members discuss reforms for special fees
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week, 61 groups asked the student body to
approve their bids to receive ASSU special fees. If all
were approved, the special-fee levy for the next aca
demic year would have totaled almost $225. Of the
61 groups that went to ballot, only four were denied,
leaving undergraduates with an annual special-fee
bill of just over $206.
Special fees represent a convenient way for
groups with many members and large budgets to re
ceive funding from the entire student population.
However, concern is growing that as special-fee costs
continue to rise — in the past five years alone, the
number of groups requesting special fees has nearly
doubled — more students will request refunds from
the ASSU.
Worried by the effects of the soaring cost of the
special-fee bill and student tendencies to approve
nearly all bids for special fees, many in the ASSU now
see a need for reforms in the process to ensure that
it remains sustainable and effective.
ASSU trims budgets
Before a group appears on the ballot, it must meet
with the ASSU Undergraduate Senate Appropria
tions Committee, which reviews the group's budget.
The committee has certain guidelines for expendi
tures and seeks to streamline each organization's
budget so that the special fee requested is reason
able.
"We trim down budgets," said sophomore Josh
Shipp, co-chair of the committee. "We have a lot of
experience dealing with student groups and how
they end up spending money."
Shipp explained that the Appropriations Com
mittee holds groups to certain budgeted amounts for
activities in order to make sure budget requests re
main reasonable.
"We have a number of policies for things like
food, copies, etc.," he said. "For food, we allow $8 a
person fora catered dinner event, and that was a
point of much consternation for the black student
community because they had budgeted $22 a person
for their soul food dinner and their Kwanzaa cele
bration. Some people say that we shouldn't be ap
plying these policies, but we try to bring the most
reasonable budget possible to the student popula
tion."
Subsequently, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
votes on all requests for special fees from the under
graduate community. The Graduate Student Coun
cil has a parallel structure for groups requesting
funding from graduate students.
Increased fee requests problematic
"We're really concerned about special fees grow
ing to the point where it's going to collapse on itself,"
Shipp said. "We have so many valuable groups,
there has to be a point where some of them can't re
ceive special fees.
"The tricky thing is that a lot of students vote for
all the special-fee groups and then go get there-
funds. That doesn't help the spe
cial-fee process."
Senior Bo Cowgill, chair of the
Senate, said that although the or
ganization is concerned that the in
creasing number of special-fee
groups may prompt more requests
for refunds, individual groups will
not lose money if students ask lor
their money back.
"We have a special buffer fund
that has sufficient money to cover
the costs of refunds," Cowgill said.
"We have a formula that is pretty
good at predicting how many peo
ple will ask for refunds. If we keep
on having that and it keeps being a
good predictor, then there won't
be any problems."
A matter of.concern for Cowgill,
however, is the prospect of free
loaders in the system.
"It's a problem when people
vote for an organization and get
the benefits of it without paying for
it,"he said.
In order to preclude increasing
numbers of students seeking re
funds— an action many pursue
because of financial rather than
philosophical concerns — Shipp
said that the ASSU is investigating
ways to shift the burden of funding
certain groups away from special
fee monies.
Next year, community service
organizations may be asked to use
increased ASSU general fee fund
ing instead of applying for special
fees.

The ASSU Executive is also
studying whether to place a cap on
the special-fee request, an effort to
make students choose more care
fully among organizations.
"We are thinking of a number
of different ways to possibly cap the
special fee at perhaps $90 for next
year, and when a student votes for
more than $90 worth of student
groups, then they would be
bounc ed back and asked to re-allo
cate their decision," Shipp said. "It
would allow students to allocate
their resources more the way they
want to see it allocated and not just
say yes to everything."
Concerns about election process
Sophomore Sheena Chandran,
financial manager of the Stanford
Harmonics — one of four organi
zations which failed to secure
enough "yes" votes to receive spe
cial fees — said that although her
group was generally pleased with
the way the ASSU conducted the
election, there were some technical
annoyances associated with the
process.
"There was a lot of trouble
about the online handbook, which
was a source of stress for many
groups," she said.
"As far as the actual announce
ment process," she added, "it was
really chaotic. Everyone was really
drunk. I don't think people heard
or really listened to the results."
Echoing her concerns, sopho
more David Lu, co-president of
the Stanford Archery Club, noted
that the disorder during the an
nouncement of the results was
frustrating to his group.

"I was a little disappointed in
the process, partly due to the way
in which the special fees an
nouncements were given the night
of the voting," he said. "They were
supposed to be out by midnight,
but we had to wait nearly two
hours more.
Senior Megan Knize, editor in
chief of The Stanford Daily, said
that she was disappointed by the
way the ASSU screened groups
and presented information about
the candidate organizations to stu
dents.
"My impression was that there
was no screening process, and in
my conversation with members of
the ASSU, they believed that it
wasn't their role to screen out
groups and that they should let
students decide," she said.
"Not every student can sit down
with all 61 groups, so The Daily,
like many newspapers, decided to
provide an extra tool for students
when they vote," she added.
Underlining the importance of
a critical pre-screening process, ju
nior Ramin Setoodeh, managing
editor for special sections and a
member of the Editorial Board,
said that The Daily was left to make
difficult choices in its endorse
ments of stndent groups.
"Our ratings weren't a reflec
tion of whether or not a group con
tributed to the student body," he
said. "All groups contribute in
some way to the student body.
"The question is whether all or
the majority of students receive
benefits from these organizations
that outweigh the costs of their spe
cial-fee requests."

Groups look toward the future
Groups that lose their bids for
special fees rarely disappear. Be
fore a group applies to receive spe
cial fees, it normally demonstrates
that it is seeking outside funding
through The Stanford Fund let
ters and from sponsors within and
outside the University.
Though the Harmonics, one of
two a cappella groups to apply for
special-fee funding this year, lost
its bid, Ghandran noted that the
fact that performing arts organiza
tions have not traditionally applied
for special-fee funding probably
hurt the group.
"I think that people are hesitant
to contribute money to things they
aren't familiar with," Ghandran
said. "I think that a lot of students
didn't understand in this election
as to what we were doing with our
funding."
Chandran said that because of
the "no" vote, the Harmonics will
continue to charge admission to
concerts and will be unable to
bring Rockapella and House Jacks,
two noted a cappella groups, to
campus.
But she remains optimistic for
next year.
"Since Everyday People got
their fee this year, people may see
that a cappella groups can do great
things with their fees," she said.
The Stanford Archery Club also
said that it will continue to operate,
but will not be able to expand to
meet student demand, as it had
sought to with its special-fee re
quest.
"We're not going to cease to

exist because of the 'no' vote, but
we won't be able to expand like we
wanted to," Lu said, "The people
are there [who want to participate
in archery], but we're going to
have to make do with what we
have. We're going to take as many
students as we can. "
Elections Commission laments
indiscriminate voting
Sunaina Sinha, the special lees
director, said that she is con
cerned as the number of groups
requesting money continues to
rise. In order to combat the ten
dency to vote "yes" or "no" indis
criminately, this year the ballot
contained a hyperlink to a three
question summary of each
group's activities.
"The third question is, "What
are your top three line items?" she
said. "That's how we simplify it so
that students can see very easily
what each group's top expenses
are."
For next year, Sinha wants to
add a fourth question.
"Some groups serve relatively
small numbers of students," she
said. "My question is: How many
students does each group serve?"
She noted that it is difficult to
corroborate membership figures,
but said she believes that this infor
mation is important in helping stu
dents to make their decisions.
However, apathy remains the
primary concern for Sinha.
"The biggest problem is that
students are voting in such a
hurry," she said. "They're in such a
hurry that they don't have time to
think about 60-some groups."
