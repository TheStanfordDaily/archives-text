### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The UCLA and USC women's
tennis teams will journey to the
Farm on Saturday looking for re
venge. Upon their arrival, howev
er, the teams will face the Cardinal,
unbeaten in 15 matches and on the
brink of another league champi
onship.

No. 1 Women's Tennis
Saturday: vs. No. 15 UCLA
Friday: vs. No. 4 USC

With the Pacific-10 regular-sea
son conference title in sight, Stan
ford (17-1, 5-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) must face a tough assignment
by beating two top opponents in 24
hours.
The Cardinal will first square off
against No. 15 UCLA (13-8, 4-2
Pac-10) on Friday in a rematch of
the April 5 meeting between the
teams in Los Angeles, in which
Stanford flattened the Bruins, 6-1,
on their home courts.
UCIA will be hungry fora con
ference victory after falling to
Washington last weekend.
A quick turnaround will see the
Cardinal then face No. 4 USC (19-
3, 5-1 Pac-10) on Saturday. The
Women of Troy will prove to be an
extremely determined opponent,
as they are in the running for the
conference title.
In addition, Stanford handed
that sqtiad its only Pac-10 loss of the
season, a 5-2 battle that knocked
USC out of the top national rank
ing. Decades of anxiety will accom
pany that team, as the Women of
Troy have not beaten the Cardinal
since 1986.
Some concern will be given to
staying fresh on the courts, as the
long season has likely taken a toll on
players from all teams.
"Fatigue is definitely a factor
during this time in the season be
cause we are playing so many
matches against top teams, but we
have all been training hard and im

proving our fitness so that we are al
ways ready for each match," said
freshman Amber Liu.
As expected fora top team,
though, Stanford has become ac
customed to the stringent schedule.
"We all worked very hard on our
fitness over the fall to make sure
that we would be ready for this part
of the season, so I'm sure fatigue
will not be a problem for us. At this
stage in the season we are accus

tomed to playing two matches back
to back and sometimes three
matches in a week, so we are well
prepared."
Although the stakes will be ex
tremely high for the Cardinal, many
factors will be working in their
favor. The team is returning to the
Taube Family Tennis Center to end
the season, and Stanford fans will no
doubt be enthusiastic considering
the squad has not played a home

match since March 28.
"We've had two tough road trips
these past two weekends, so it's re
ally nice to be back at home," Barnes
said. "Also, seeing as it is the closing
weekend of the regular season, we
are hoping to have a lot of home
support."
Despite the home crowd, how
ever, the Cardinal will have to ded
icate maximum effort if it wishes to
capture the league title outright.
Stanford, which stands atop the
Pac-10 with a perfect 5-0 record,
controls its own fate. The Cardinal
can claim the conference title with
wins over UCLA on Friday and
USC on Saturday coupled with a
California loss.
But the Bears (4-1 Pac-10) and
the Women of Troy (5-1
are nipping at Stanford's heels, and
either school could capture a share
of the Pac-10 title with a Cardinal
loss in any of its last three matches.
So, although Stanford has dom
inated its conference thus far, one
uncharacteristic performance
could nullify all previous results.
Nonetheless, the team remains
confident in its preparation for this
weekend.
"I'm sure we will all be aware
that the Pac-10 depends on the
matches this week, but we will just
try and focus on keeping up the
great tennis that we have been play
ing recently and hopefully the re
sults will come," Barnes said.
The Cardinal will be anxious for
the upcoming contests, as the rain
this week has kept them off the
courts much of this week. Stanford
was supposed to take on California
yesterday, but the match was can
celled due to rain. The Cardinal's
season finale will be played against
the Bears on April 22.
For now, however, UCLA and
USC will be the focus of the Stan
ford attack.
"I am definitely looking forward
to this weekend's matches," Liu
said. "It'sa great opportunity for us
to finish off the dual match season
strongly."

Amber Liu, the No. 1 singles competitor for the Cardinal this year as a fresh
man, will look to lead Stanford over UCLA and USC this weekend. Two vic
tories would allow the team to capture a Pac-10 title with a win over Cal.
