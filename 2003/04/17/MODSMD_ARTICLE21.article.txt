# Stanford mourns fallen star
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford sports community suffered an un
expected tragedy on Tuesday as Dr. Don Bunce, a
Stanford Rose Howl MVP and orthopedic surgeon,
died of a heart attack. He was 54 years of age.
A Bay Area local, Bunce attended Woodside
High School before selecting Stanford in 1967.
After assuming the quarterback position from
Heisman Trophy recipient Jim Plunkett in 1971,
Bunce guided the Cardinal to a conference title
and a win in the Rose Bowl.
He is most remembered for his performance
against Michigan in the 1972 Rose Bowl, as he led
Stanford to a 13-12 victory over unbeaten Michi
gan. His 290 yards passing was overshadowed by
his poise on a final, game-winning field goal drive.
Despite an emotional crowd of 103,154 people,
Bunce showed his exceptional calm under pressure
by leading the Indians [the ancestor of the Cardi
nal] more than 60 yards with 1:48 to play, thereby

earning highly prestigious Rose
Bowl MVP honors.
In addition to his prowess on
the football field, Bunce excelled
in the classroom. He earned a
human biology degree in 1972
and remained on the Farm until
he earned his M.D. from Stanford
in 1977.
Although he was selected by

lhe Washington Redskins in the 1972 NFL Draft,
Bunce quickly decided to pursue his career in med
icine. Nonetheless, he did not completely shed his
athletic roots, as he worked as the physician for the
Stanford football team for more than 10 years.
Bunce is survived by his wife Jennifer, his son
Cameron, and his daughter Mikele.
A memorial service for Dr. Bunce will be held on
May 1 at Memorial Church, followed by a celebra
tion of life at Chuck Taylor Grove.
Memorials can be made to Athletes in Action,
262 Rutherford Ave., Redwood City, CA, 94061.
