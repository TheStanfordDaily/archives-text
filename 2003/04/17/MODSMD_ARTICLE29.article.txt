# Michigan expects mid-summer ruling
## 
### TOMISLAV LADIKA ABIKE MARTINS MICHIGAN DAILY 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich —As
most University of Michigan students prepare
to work and enjoy their summer vacations,
the U.S. Supreme Court will spend the next
few months deliberating over the fate of race
conscious admissions policies.
In late June or early July, the Court will
rule on the lawsuits challenging the Michi
gan's use of race in the admission policies of
the Law School and College of Literature, Sci
ence and the Aits — a ruling that is consid
ered the most significant higher education
case in a generation.
Michigan spokeswoman Julie Peterson
said Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman is
expected to send a mass e-mail to the campus
community immediately after the decision is
announced. The Court ruling will be the first
involving affirmative action since the 1978 Re
gents of the University of California v. Bakke
ruling, which banned racial quotas but per
mitted the use of race as an admissions factor.
Peterson said administrators must wait for
the court's decision to see how it affects Michi
gan's policies in order to determine what
changes, if any, need to be made.
Students can expect one of four possible
outcomes, ranging from a ban on the use of
race as an admissions factor for schools across
the country to an affirmation of the use of

racial plus factors.
Michigan administrators and affirmative
action supporters tear a decision overturning
Bakke will lead to a drastic drop in minority
enrollment, but a ruling upholding both poli
cies will probably lead to many other schools
adopting policies similar to the Michigan's.
Many legal experts anticipate a split deci
sion, with the Court upholding one of the
policies while overturning the other. Wayne
State University Law Prof. Steven Winter
said Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and An
thony Kennedy, the possible swing votes,
may favor the Law School policy because it
more closely follows the requirements of the
Bakke ruling.
"Kennedy seemed to suggest that he might
accept an individualized consideration of race
.. . as opposed to the pure number system,"
Winter said. "The point system seems more
like a quota."
Curt Levey, spokesman for the Center for
Individual Rights, the law firm representing
the plaintiffs in the cases, said he would con
sider a split decision a partial victory because
it would only eliminate one way to use race
conscious admissions.
Peterson said if one of the policies is over
turned, Michigan lawyers will closely examine
the Court's decision and decide how to
change the policy before the fall admissions
cycle begins.
A decision in favor of both policies would
likely end the debate over the constitutionali

ty of using race in admissions. Winter said
such a decision is unlikely, but would give
schools across the country the choice of mod
eling their admissions policies after the I>aw
School or LSA policy.
"There will be a certain amount of copycat
ting," Michigan State University Law Prof.
Frank Ravitch said.
Public universities in Texas and California,
which had their race-conscious admissions
policies overturned by federal appellate
courts, could also opt to tailor their policies
after the Michigan's, Ravitch said.
In its legal briefs, CIR argued that the
Court should not only overturn Michigan's
policies, but instead ban the use of race in ad
missions in general. Such a ruling would in
stantly become one of the most significant
higher education decisions in the Court's his
tory, Levey said.
All public schools would be forced to dis
continue the use of racial plus factors, but
many private schools would be required to
reform their policies as well, Ravitch said.
Due to the wide-ranging consequences of
such a ruling, Winter predicted the Court will
announce a more moderate ruling. He said
although the Court has independent jurisdic
tion, briefs filed by retired military officers
and other supporters of Michigan's policies
will affect their decision.
But Ravitch said the current justices have
been active in undoing past precedents in
many other cases.
