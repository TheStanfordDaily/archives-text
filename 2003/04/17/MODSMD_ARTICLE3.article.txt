# Tresidder to house popular restaurants

### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
On April 1, Residential and
Dining Enterprises gave notice to
Bon Appetit Management Com
pany that it was canceling the food
service company's lease on its
Tresidder Union businesses, in
cluding the company's manage
ment of the CoHo and Bon Ap
petit Catering at Stanford. Stan
ford Dining will assume control by
the start of next school year;
planned changes include bring
ing in popular national vendors
and introducing the meal point
system now in use at other dining
facilities.
"What Stanford Dining is going
to do is establish partnerships with
national vendors to bring in a vari
ety of food service," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni. "For example, a couple

of the possible partners that are
being considered are In-N-Out
Burger, Krispy Kreme Donuts
and California Pizza Kitchen. We
want to talk to those vendors and
see what options we can offer stu
dents that they haven't up to this
point enjoyed.
"Dining Services also wants to
allow students to use points as part
of their dining meal plan," Awaku
ni continued. "At Tresidder, this
has not previously been possible.
These are the options we're con
sidering. We, of course, need to
work with these vendors and work
out agreements that we all can live
with."
Awakuni said there was "no
guarantee" that any particular
chains would be coming to Stan
ford, but that the University was
trying to be responsive to student

Freshman Rachel Hsu doesn't
think cheating is a problem at
Stanford.
"I have never encountered
cheating in a testing situation,"
Hsu said.
However, she believes it de
pends on the definition of cheat
ing. For homework, Hsu believes
it is permissible to work in groups
or be tutored as is encouraged in
most classes. Only if it is said specif
ically not to discuss the assignment
is it then cheating, she said.
New Student Orientation staff
explains the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard to fresh
men and transfer students. They
also distribute bookmarks and
leaflets informing students of the
policies. Wilson hopes to get post

cards printed with similar content.
Judicial Affairs is hoping to im
plement a student survey, and
while Wilson admits it won't be
perfect, at least it will give them
more information into students'
perceptions and needs. Once ap
proved, about 1,000 undergradu
ates will receive the survey online.
As of now, the different academic
departments have liaisons with Ju
dicial Affairs.
The 70-member Judicial Panel
Pool that hears Honor (lode cases
consists of 20 undergraduates, 20
graduate students, 15 faculty and
15 staff members. During a hearing
there are four students, one faculty
member and one staff member
present. Approximately two ses
sions are held each week in a given
quarter to hear violations of the
Honor (lode or the Fundamental
Standard. About three-fourths of
the reported cases often are not
contested and the student accepts
responsibility for the violation.

The Office of Judicial Affairs has handled twice as many cases of alleged
cheating from winter 2002 to winter 2003. Cases are heard twice a week,
and panelists are drawn from a 70-member pool.
