On April 1, Residential and
Dining Enterprises gave notice to
Bon Appetit Management Com
pany that it was canceling the food
service company's lease on its
Tresidder Union businesses, in
cluding the company's manage
ment of the CoHo and Bon Ap
petit Catering at Stanford. Stan
ford Dining will assume control by
the start of next school year;
planned changes include bring
ing in popular national vendors
and introducing the meal point
system now in use at other dining
facilities.
"What Stanford Dining is going
to do is establish partnerships with
national vendors to bring in a vari
ety of food service," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni. "For example, a couple

of the possible partners that are
being considered are In-N-Out
Burger, Krispy Kreme Donuts
and California Pizza Kitchen. We
want to talk to those vendors and
see what options we can offer stu
dents that they haven't up to this
point enjoyed.
"Dining Services also wants to
allow students to use points as part
of their dining meal plan," Awaku
ni continued. "At Tresidder, this
has not previously been possible.
These are the options we're con
sidering. We, of course, need to
work with these vendors and work
out agreements that we all can live
with."
Awakuni said there was "no
guarantee" that any particular
chains would be coming to Stan
ford, but that the University was
trying to be responsive to student
