# Press adapts to new economy
## University Press to start three new business book labels 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I n an effort lo respond to a weakened econ
omy, Stanford University Press recently an
nounced a new business book program that is
expected to double the organization's rev
enues in five to six years.

The press is moving into the business prac
titioner market under three different labels:
Stanford Business Books, Stanford Econom
ics and Finance and Stanford Law and Policy.
"What we're trying to do with our lists is
straddle both markets," said Geoffrey Burn,
the managing editor of the press. "We have
works of proven theory that can be applied
within the practitioner context, whether
that's in business, economics and banking or

law. [That could be] anything
from macro policy down to the
quantitative practice of running a
business."
While the economy has been
the motivating factor behind many
of the recent changes, Burn said
that other factors have played a
significant role in this decision.
"The most significant pressure
has come from considerably re
duced unit sales," Burn said. "A
steady reduction in individual
purchases has been compounded
by reductions in library budgets
[which has been] exacerbated by
increased expenditure on scientif
ic joui nals, by consolidation in the
retail trade and by the implosion of
the superstores.
"At the same time, the pressure
to publish has continued undimin
ished, fed in large part by the need
to produce more and more
'tenure monographs.' And the
whole situation has been further
complicated by the recent eco
nomic downturn that has forced
many universities to redirect
money from press subsidies to pro
tect core academic programs."
In fact, the press is not unique
in its attempts to expand sales.
"Almost all university presses
are under the same pressures as
SUP," Burn continued. "To
counter these pressures, most
presses have introduced a mix of
strategies similar to ours. In addi
tion to reducing their scholarly

output and launching new 'money
making' lists, some have cut whole
series, [though] we have not. In
addition, some, SUP included,
have had to reduce their head
count."
Haun Saussy, a professor of
comparative literature and Asian
languages, agreed.
"These are terrible times in
publishing: look at what happened
recently to the senior editor at
Random House, Ann Godoff
Godoff was fired unexpectedly in
January.
Previously, the press had made
changes to its humanities program
in an effort to increase gross mar
gins by reducing production and
write-off costs.
"The cost of producing our hu
manities program outstrips that of
our other disciplines, making our
humanities' margins the lowest in
our overall list," Burn said. "This is
especially true for translations.
"Translations not only cost
more to produce than domestic ti
tles, they cost significantly more
and are much more volatile. We
have not terminated our transla
tions program, nor will we. We will
simply be more selective in what
we sign in future. Even with this
reduction in forward signings, we
will be able to sustain a high output
of translations for several more
years because of the large number
we currently have under con
tract."
But some faculty are worried
about the recent decisions of the
press.
"It's true that SUP has an enor
mous reputation as a publisher of

books in philosophy, humanities
and social sciences — a reputation
equal to that of presses that pub
lish four or five times as many
books as we do," Saussy said. "It
would be sad to lose that by refo
cusing on areas that may, but we
don't know for sure, bring in more
revenue."
David Palumbo-Liu, professor
of comparative literature and di
rector of the Program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Program in Asian American Stud
ies, agreed.
"Much of the worldwide repu
tation of the [press's] humanities
list rests on precisely those titles
which will be eliminated," Palum
bo-Liu said last October.
In response to the concerns over
money-making motives, Burn be
lieves that SUP will continue to up
hold its academic reputation.
"[Faculty] have a healthy press
that is doing all it can to balance the
countervailing demands of service
to the academic community and
fiscal responsibility," he said. "We
are not trying to turn SUP into a
commercial press, nor are we pub
lishing 'trade books' at the expense
of our scholarly program. Our in
tent is to survive this very stormy
time and emerge at the end of it
with a press of which our faculty
will continue to be proud and with
a list that is truly representative of
Stanford's academic programs.
"I'm confident that a look at our
catalog or a visit to our Web site
will assure all members of the Stan
ford community that we have a
publishing program here of which
they can be proud," Burn added.

In fact, the press is not unique
in its attempts to expand sales.
"Almost all university presses
are under the same pressures as
SUP," Burn continued. "To
counter these pressures, most
presses have introduced a mix of
strategies similar to ours. In addi
tion to reducing their scholarly

output and launching new 'money
making' lists, some have cut whole
series, [though] we have not. In
addition, some, SUP included,
have had to reduce their head
count."
Haun Saussy, a professor of
comparative literature and Asian
languages, agreed.
"These are terrible times in
publishing: look at what happened
recently to the senior editor at
Random House, Ann Godoff
Godoff was fired unexpectedly in
January.
Previously, the press had made
changes to its humanities program
in an effort to increase gross mar
gins by reducing production and
write-off costs.
"The cost of producing our hu
manities program outstrips that of
our other disciplines, making our
humanities' margins the lowest in
our overall list," Burn said. "This is
especially true for translations.
"Translations not only cost
more to produce than domestic ti
tles, they cost significantly more
and are much more volatile. We
have not terminated our transla
tions program, nor will we. We will
simply be more selective in what
we sign in future. Even with this
reduction in forward signings, we
will be able to sustain a high output
of translations for several more
years because of the large number
we currently have under con
tract."
But some faculty are worried
about the recent decisions of the
press.
"It's true that SUP has an enor
mous reputation as a publisher of

books in philosophy, humanities
and social sciences — a reputation
equal to that of presses that pub
lish four or five times as many
books as we do," Saussy said. "It
would be sad to lose that by refo
cusing on areas that may, but we
don't know for sure, bring in more
revenue."
David Palumbo-Liu, professor
of comparative literature and di
rector of the Program in Modern
Thought and Literature and the
Program in Asian American Stud
ies, agreed.
"Much of the worldwide repu
tation of the [press's] humanities
list rests on precisely those titles
which will be eliminated," Palum
bo-Liu said last October.
In response to the concerns over
money-making motives, Burn be
lieves that SUP will continue to up
hold its academic reputation.
"[Faculty] have a healthy press
that is doing all it can to balance the
countervailing demands of service
to the academic community and
fiscal responsibility," he said. "We
are not trying to turn SUP into a
commercial press, nor are we pub
lishing 'trade books' at the expense
of our scholarly program. Our in
tent is to survive this very stormy
time and emerge at the end of it
with a press of which our faculty
will continue to be proud and with
a list that is truly representative of
Stanford's academic programs.
"I'm confident that a look at our
catalog or a visit to our Web site
will assure all members of the Stan
ford community that we have a
publishing program here of which
they can be proud," Burn added.
