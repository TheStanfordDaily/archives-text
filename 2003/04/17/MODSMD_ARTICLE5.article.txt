# Reported cheating doubles in winter '03
## Judicial Affairs plans to conduct survey of cheating behavior 
### JANICE SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past quarter saw a
marked increase in reports of
Honor Code violations, rising
from 17 incidents reported in
winter 2002 to 37 violations in
winter 2003.
According to Judicial Affairs
Program Coordinator Ceorge
Wilson, the issue of cheating is
usually never clear-cut. Many of
the cases reported did not make
it to judicial panels because of
lack of evidence. Of those that
did make it to the panel, some
were dismissed.
Wilson said that the Judicial
Affairs Office is not sure if the in
crease in Honor Code violations
reflects increases in cheating or
if more students are simply get

The majority of the violations
consist of Internet plagiarism,
revising and resubmitting work,
usually in qualitative math or sci

ence classes and in unpermitted
collaboration. Here, too, Wilson
says it is difficult to say if the stu

laboration and group work is
often encouraged at Stanford,
making it difficult to distinguish
what is or is not considered
cheating.
Wilson stressed that Judicial
Affairs is not trying to unfairly
punish students and that many
students who have been caught
cheating and accepted responsi
bility for it have continued at
Stanford.
"We're not trying to get our
rates up here," Wilson said.
"Many do turn themselves
around and change their out
look."
Wilson believes that there is
something lacking in the com
munication between students
and professors. Also, Wilson said
that various cultures and back
grounds— particularly some
Asian cultures — view collabo
rative work as respectful. One
person's definition of helping
another could be considered
cheating. According to Wilson,
