# Reported cheating doubles in winter '03
## Judicial Affairs plans to conduct survey of cheating behavior 
### JANICE SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past quarter saw a
marked increase in reports of
Honor Code violations, rising
from 17 incidents reported in
winter 2002 to 37 violations in
winter 2003.
According to Judicial Affairs
Program Coordinator Ceorge
Wilson, the issue of cheating is
usually never clear-cut. Many of
the cases reported did not make
it to judicial panels because of
lack of evidence. Of those that
did make it to the panel, some
were dismissed.
Wilson said that the Judicial
Affairs Office is not sure if the in
crease in Honor Code violations
reflects increases in cheating or
if more students are simply get
ting caught.
The majority of the violations
consist of Internet plagiarism,
revising and resubmitting work,
usually in qualitative math or sci

ence classes and in unpermitted
collaboration. Here, too, Wilson
says it is difficult to say if the stu
dent is knowingly cheating. Col
laboration and group work is
often encouraged at Stanford,
making it difficult to distinguish
what is or is not considered
cheating.
Wilson stressed that Judicial
Affairs is not trying to unfairly
punish students and that many
students who have been caught
cheating and accepted responsi
bility for it have continued at
Stanford.
"We're not trying to get our
rates up here," Wilson said.
"Many do turn themselves
around and change their out
look."
Wilson believes that there is
something lacking in the com
munication between students
and professors. Also, Wilson said
that various cultures and back
grounds— particularly some
Asian cultures — view collabo
rative work as respectful. One
person's definition of helping
another could be considered
cheating. According to Wilson,
"often [teacher and students']
desires.
"We're going to have students
involved in the process as well,"
Awakuni said. "[Executive Direc
tor for University Dining Ser
vices] Nadeem Siddiqui is work
ing with us and the ASSU about
this."
Awakuni said that the CoHo
would continue to serve alcoholic
beverages; he said that no deci
sion had been made concerning
the possibility of using meal
points to buy alcoholic beverages
there.
While Awakuni was optimistic

about the changes being made,
Bon Appetit Chief Executive Offi
cer Fedele Bauccio expressed re
gret.
"This has been in the process
for some time, from their per
spective," he said. "Our reaction
and perspective is that we're very
disappointed. We've had a long,
13-year relationship with the
University. We've had a wonder
ful relationship — we love to
serve the campus, the students
and faculty at Stanford."
Bon Appetit will maintain its
services at the Graduate School
of Business, for which it has a
separate contract.
Awakuni said that the decision
to cut Bon Appetit and bring in
Stanford Dining was made as

part of the University's larger
plans to redefine student space in
central campus.
"I'd like to acknowledge that
when Bon Appetit came in, they
upgraded the quality of service
and set a new standard for the
University," he said. "They've
been here 13 years, and the in
dustry has changed. Now people
are demanding a lot. This is part
of the Student Activities Space
Master Plan. We're looking at
the central student spaces at
Tresidder and Old Union, and
we think it's time for us to make
some changes in the program
matic mix of these buildings.
This is part of the changes that
we're expecting to make over
the year."
