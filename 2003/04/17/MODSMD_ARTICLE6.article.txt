Seven undergraduate students were
honored on Tuesday with 2003 Dean's
Awards for Academic A< complishment.
1 he winners of the very selective award
came from diverse fields in the human
ities and sciences and were selected on
the basis of their extraordinary re
search.
"I felt honored," said junior Mark
Millet. " I his is one of the few academic
honors that Stanford gives out, and I'm
incredibly excited and even surprised
to receive it, [because] there are so
many people at Stanford that do such
good work."
Miller, a junior majoring in chemical
engineering, won for his groundbreak
ing discoveries in protein synthesis,
which will be published in either Cell or
Science, both world-renowned jour
nals. Miller is the first researcher to dis
cover the relationship between the con

centration of adenosine tri
phosphate— ATP, a basic natural
chemical fuel — and the rate of protein
synthesis.
"I was playing around with the data,
and I decided to make a plot of this ki
netic data, and it turned out to be lin
ear," Miller said. "I got pretty excited."
Like most of the nominees, Miller
wasn't previously familiar with the
award.
"I'd never even heard about the
award before I received it," Miller said.
"The first thing I did was call my mom
and tell her the good news."
Senior Orlando invited his
mother up from Houston, Texas for
Tuesday's subdued awards ceremony.
who is majoring in Chicano
studies and minoring in cultural and
s< x ial anthropology, was recognized for
his wide variety of contributions to the
Institute for the Diversity in the Arts,
most notably his dramaturgical and
script-writing contributions to a pro

duction by Daniel Valdez.
"Since I mostly do creative stuff, I
was surprised, and I was happy [to
win]," he said. "All through high school,
I didn't get involved in the arts at all so
that 1 could get into a good college, so 1
wasn't expecting that in college that 1
would be able to bring that side of me
back and mix it and weave it with acad
emic research."
Maya Adam, a junior majoring in
human biology, was recognized for her
study on attitudes about stress and in
juries among ballet dancers. Adam her
self had a nine-year career in ballet, in
cluding time as the principle ballerina
with the Dresden ballet company, so
she was well-qualified to research the
subject. As part of her research, Adam
produced a video that has drawn inter
est fr om PBS television.
"It means more to you when it's
something you've been personally in
