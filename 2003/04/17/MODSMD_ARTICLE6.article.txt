### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seven undergraduate students were
honored on Tuesday with 2003 Dean's
Awards for Academic A< complishment.
1 he winners of the very selective award
came from diverse fields in the human
ities and sciences and were selected on
the basis of their extraordinary re
search.
"I felt honored," said junior Mark
Millet. " I his is one of the few academic
honors that Stanford gives out, and I'm
incredibly excited and even surprised
to receive it, [because] there are so
many people at Stanford that do such
good work."
Miller, a junior majoring in chemical
engineering, won for his groundbreak
ing discoveries in protein synthesis,
which will be published in either Cell or
Science, both world-renowned jour
nals. Miller is the first researcher to dis
cover the relationship between the con

centration of adenosine tri
phosphate— ATP, a basic natural
chemical fuel — and the rate of protein
synthesis.
"I was playing around with the data,
and I decided to make a plot of this ki
netic data, and it turned out to be lin
ear," Miller said. "I got pretty excited."
Like most of the nominees, Miller
wasn't previously familiar with the
award.
"I'd never even heard about the
award before I received it," Miller said.
"The first thing I did was call my mom
and tell her the good news."
Senior Orlando invited his
mother up from Houston, Texas for
Tuesday's subdued awards ceremony.
who is majoring in Chicano
studies and minoring in cultural and
s< x ial anthropology, was recognized for
his wide variety of contributions to the
Institute for the Diversity in the Arts,
most notably his dramaturgical and
script-writing contributions to a pro

duction by Daniel Valdez.
"Since I mostly do creative stuff, I
was surprised, and I was happy [to
win]," he said. "All through high school,
I didn't get involved in the arts at all so
that 1 could get into a good college, so 1
wasn't expecting that in college that 1
would be able to bring that side of me
back and mix it and weave it with acad
emic research."
Maya Adam, a junior majoring in
human biology, was recognized for her
study on attitudes about stress and in
juries among ballet dancers. Adam her
self had a nine-year career in ballet, in
cluding time as the principle ballerina
with the Dresden ballet company, so
she was well-qualified to research the
subject. As part of her research, Adam
produced a video that has drawn inter
est fr om PBS television.

volved with," she explained. "I think
that makes your research become
like a hobby rather than a job."
Amrit Rao, a sophomore major
ing in biological sciences, was hon
ored for his work on three-dimen
sional surgery. He published pa
pers on 3-D reconstruction of teeth
for teaching purposes and on 3-D
imaging for reconstructive breast
surgery. He will present the latter
first-author research paper at the
prestigious international confer
ence on Computer Aided Radiolo
gy and Surgery this year.
Chuong B. Do, a junior physics
major and master's student in com
puter science, won his award for
doctorate-level research in ge
nomics, which led to his co-author
ing articles in prestigious journals.
His findings have led to further re
search in which he hopes to develop
a statistically sound method for
comparing genomic sequences.
"The research he performs is of
the depth and quality I would wish
from a final-year Ph.D. student,"
wrote Computer Science Prof. Ser
afim Batzoglou in his nomination.
Senior Jennifer Herbert, a femi
nist studies major, was honored for
her doctorate-level research on the
differences in achievement and per
ceived competency for each gender
in elementary students. She was ac
cepted to present her findings at the
annual meeting of the American
Educational Research Association.
Senior Eva St. Clair, a history
major, was acknowledged for her
intensive research on Arabic theolo
gian Al-Gazali and his impact on
early Western philosophy. St. Clair
was nominated by three different
professors, reflecting the breadth of
her studies which have included
learning French, Spanish, Arabic
and Latin.
"When you're a scholar, you
don't think that your research is that
out of the ordinary, since it's what
you do every day," she said. "To
think that someone else thinks it's re
ally impressive is kind of surreal
sometimes." For St. Clair and the
other 2003 Dean's Award winners, it
seems that their contributions to
learning have only just begun.
"I'll probably keep doing what
I'm doing," St. Clair said. Adam
added, "It's interesting to learn that
someone, just a student, can go out
and find answers fora question.
That's a very empowering feeling."
