# New phone-a-thon greets Class of 2007
## For the first time, volunteers try to reach all accepted students 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By this evening, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission hopes
to have finished calling every one
of the 2,250 students admitted to
the Class of 2007 as part a new
outreach program where volun
teers created a Phone-A-Thon to
welcome admits to Stanford.
Early Decision applicants were
contacted in February as part of
an existing program. The other
1,653, however, were the first
regular admittance students to
have the opportunity for these
phone conversations.
The two-week calling program
involved about 60 people in two
one-and-a-half hour shifts per
evening. Volunteers were given
lists of names divided into geo
graphical regions, with the earlier
shift usually calling students on
the East Coast. Although the goal
is to make contact with every stu
dent, the Phone-A-Thon has
found that students' busy sched
ules often mean leaving messages
or talking to parents, who are
usually very enthusiastic and
have a lot of questions.
Senior Tali Golan, student co

ordinator of the Ambassador Pro
gram, under which the Phone-A-
Thon project falls, noted that
parents can be much more con
cerned about their children's
happiness at Stanford and often
come up with the most interest
ing questions.
Volunteer Chris Clark, a
sophomore, noted, "Sometimes
the parents worry more than the
kids."
Still, students say the conversa
tions are very fruitful and enjoy
able.
Golan explained, "They really
like it. They're excited about
Stanford and excited about talk
ing to a current Stanford stu
dent."
Some of the most common is
sues students ask questions about
are the weather and the quality
and assignment of housing,
which seems to be a big worry.
Other interesting topics that have
come up are cell phone plans, fi
nancial aid and even the new
freshman alcohol policy.
Although some students may
not have many questions or may
hold off, expecting that most of
their questions will be answered
during Admit Weekend, volun
teers have also had student calls
lasting up to half an hour. That
enthusiasm is what brought se
nior Marisol Castillo to partici
pate in the event.
"I remember getting my
phone call and being so excited,"
she explained. "I think we ended
up talking for two hours."
Although she was involved in
efforts similar to the Phone-A-
Thon during her freshman and
sophomore years, Castillo is one
of a handful of volunteers without
current ties to the Admissions Of
fice. Most of the volunteers are ei
ther students in the office's Am
bassador program or house hosts
for Admit Weekend. Golan ex
plained that the house hosts' en
thusiasm for their jobs extends to
their phone calls.
"They really want to be a big
part of sharing their Stanford ex
perience," she said.
As part of the Student Ambas
sador program, other volunteers
have had practice representing
Stanford through their role as
representatives at college fairs,
other University promotional
programs and similar phone calls
to early admits. They received
training for these functions after
the application and selection
process early in the year. Ambas
sadors have also been participat

ing in another pilot program that
hosts lunches in the dorms for
prospective applicants.
Clark, an ambassador, ex
plained, "I became an ambassador
because I really enjoyed working
with pro fros on Admit Weekend
and have really enjoyed all the re
sponsibilities of the job."
Another recent outreach at
tempt was the recently completed
three-day Spring Postcard Pro
ject. Students had the opportuni
ty to stop by a table and write a
postcard to an admit. While the
goal was not to reach all prospec
tive students, Golan considers the
project to have been successful.
"Considering how long post
cards take to write, we did more
than I thought we could," she
said.
The programs, new and old,
are part of an increasing effort to
improve communication between
prospective students and current
Stanford students. Although the
prospective students may have
the chance to talk to alumni or
professors, the aim is to allow
them the most current perspec
tive on the University undergrad
uate experience.
"After these, we'll have made
contact. The goal is just to in
crease important communication
between current and prospective
students," Golan said.
