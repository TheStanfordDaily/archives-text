## Bechtel given millions to rebuild Iraq 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The government
awarded Bechtel Corp. a contract yesterday that
could reach $680 million to help rebuild Iraq, in
cluding the nation's power, water and sewage sys
tems.
The U.S. Agency for International Development
said the initial contract was for $34.6 million but it
could be worth the larger figure over IS months,
subject to congressional approval.
Several Democratic lawmakers have com
plained the Bush administration did not allow
open competitive bidding, but rather invited a
small number of firms to submit proposals. USAID
has defended the procedure as the only way to get
help to Iraq quickly.
The company has employed several officials after
they left high government jobs, including former
Secretary of State George Shultz and former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
The Bechtel Group and its employees have been
among the biggest political givers in the general con
tracting industry, according to an analysis by the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan Wash
ington-based group that tracks campaign finance.
The company and its workers contributed at least
$277,050 to federal candidates and party commit
tees in the last election cycle, about 57 percent to De
mocrats and 43 percent to Republicans, the center
found.
In addition to Bechtel's work utility systems, the
contract also provides for rehabilitation or repair of
airport facilities and dredging, repair and upgrad
ing of the Umm Qasr seaport in cooperation with
other contractors, the assistance agency said.
Bechtel also may have a role in repair and recon
struction of hospitals, schools, selected government
ministry buildings, irrigation facilities and trans
portation links.
The agency said Bechtel probably would hire sub
contractors for many of the projects.
"Through all of its activities, it will also engage the
Iraqi population and work to build local capacity,"
the announcement said.
