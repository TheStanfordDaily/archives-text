# Saddam Hussein's brother seized

(AP) — U.S. forces seized a half brother of Sacldam
Hussein in a commando raid yesterday, eager to in
terrogate him about secrets of the old Iraqi regime.
The FBI joined the hunt for irreplaceable antiquities
stolen from the National Museum in Baghdad.
In northern Iraq, there were grim hints about
life — and death — under Saddam. Kurds brought
American officials to what they said was a large area
of unmarked graves around Kirkuk, a region where
thousands of Kurdish men disappeared in the 1980s.
With the lighting all but over, Americans strug
gled through another day of trying to restore securi
ty and vital services for civilians. Soldiers thwarted a
Baghdad bank robbery over the protests of Iraqis
eager to share in the loot, and Marines sought to calm
tensions in Mosul after shooting 17 Iraqis to death in
clashes over the past two days.
The search for weapons of mass destruction contin
ued in Iraq, but Rumsfeld said he doubted any would

be found until Iraqis lead American forces to them.
"I think what will happen is we'll discover people
who will tell us where to go find it,"he said. "It is not
like a treasure hunt where you just run around look
ing everywhere, hoping you find something."
International experts, appalled at the looting of
Iraqi historical artifacts, met in Paris under U.N. aus
pices and called fora temporary embargo on trade in
Iraqi cultural objects.
Some participants said it appeared the looting was
organized, and some of those involved had keys to mu
seum vaults and were able to remove items from safes.
One official suggested the effort was organized
from outside Iraq.
"In fact I'm pretty sure it was," said McGuire Gib
son, a University of Chicago professor and president
of the American Association for Research in Bagh
dad. I le added that ifa good police team were put to
gether, "I think it could be cracked in no time."
