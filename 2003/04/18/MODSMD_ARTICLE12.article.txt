# SARS test in development
## 
### 
(AP) — Tests for the SARS virus will soon help
doctors sort out whether people with worrisome
coughs and fevers actually have the new respiratory
illness, relieving anxiety for many and helping judge
who should be isolated to prevent more spread.
Government agencies, university labs and private
companies are all rushing to develop highly sensitive
tests that will seek out the newly discovered virus and
confident ly allow a diagnosis of severe acute respira
tory syndrome, once their accuracy has been proven.
One version created by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention could be shipped to state labs
as soon as the end of next week, officials say. Several
others are being fine tuned around the world using
new information compiled just last weekend from sci
entists' marathon exercise of decoding the virus's
genes.
The tests, which search for viral genes in victims'
nasal secretions and other samples, are likely to work
only in the early stages of the disease, before the body
defeats the virus, removing all traces it existed.
They will be used cautiously at first, while devel
opers work to prove they pinpoint the virus in infect
ed people without sending up frequent false alarms
in the healthy. Until this accuracy is known, "we will
be loath to say someone doesn't have SARS on the
basis of the test," CDC head Dr. Julie Gerberding said
Thursday.
Nevertheless, experts hope the tests will soon allow
doctors and public health officials to distinguish
whether people with fresh symptoms have SARS or
other look-alike ills, such as bad colds and flu. Then
they can more knowledgeably decide whether the pa
tients need elaborate infection control precautions in
hospitals and whether their families, co-workers and
friends should be watched for symptoms and per
haps even quarantined to prevent passing the virus to
others.
"We could basically target our prevention at those
who truly have SARS," said Dr. Elizabeth Koch, an
epidemiologist in the Ohio Department of 1 lealth.
Dr. James Hughes, head of the CDC's National
Center for Infectious Diseases, said its test will be sent
to about 100 stale, city and federal health labs within
two weeks, perhaps as soon as the end of next week.
The labs, in turn, will test samples sent to them by
hospitals with suspected SARS cases.
