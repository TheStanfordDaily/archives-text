### 
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission and the Financial Aid Of
fice recently announced their
plans to move from Old Union to
new offices in the Bakewell Building, which
is located across the street from the Arrillaga
Alumni Center 011 Galvez Street. The move
is targeted for completion by 2006.
The proposed plan was set into motion in
the name of creating increased centrally lo
cated space for student use. Expanding stu
dent space has been a recent priority of ASSU
representatives on behalf of the student
body, and we anticipate that students will ap
preciate the University's responsiveness to
this pressing issue. If the office move is con
ducted thoughtfully, it bodes well for recent
student space initiatives and the goal of unit
ing the student body through augmented
central meeting areas.
Simultaneous to the move, the Financial
Aid Office is developing its online capacity
and hopes to continually decrease the
amount of paperwork necessary to file finan
cial aid forms and to request information.
Improving online services should make up
for the increased distance some students will
have to travel to the physical office, as well as
eliminate the need to wait in line. Additional
ly, the online site will allow parents and stu
dents to access the office at any time, regard
less of the physical office's open hours. At the
same time, we hope that the office continues
to offer personal interaction with students
and parents to resolve any concerns. Person
alized help is especially necessary to financial
aid concerns, many of which require person
al explanations from both administrators

and aid-seeking students.
While we generally support the Universi
ty's plan, we have reservations about (he
move of the Financial Aid Office in particu
lar. Given that the Stanford campus is spread
out, we are concerned that the distance to the
financial aid office discourages student-staff
interaction. Because the Student Financial
Services Office (previously the Bursar's Of
fice) and ihe Financial Aid Office often work
closely together, the separation could possi
bly cause an unnecessary inconvenience for
students when paying bills and taking care of
other financial concerns.
If the Bakewell Building is the next-best
location for the Financial Aid Office and Of
fice of Undergraduate Admissions, then the
sacrifice of a longer commute is worth the
benefits gained in student space. I lowever, if
other central locations for the Financial Aid
Office might be used instead of the Bakewell
Building, such as the old Career Develop
ment Center building by the clocktower, or
perhaps a floor in Sweet I lall, these might be
more accessible locations.
Overall, the University should remem
ber that increasing online capacity in its stu
dent services can never substitute for per
sonalized, face-to-face help and that keep
ing financial services as central to campus
as possible remains a priority, even in the
name of increased student space. In these
financially constrained times, students are
increasingly reliant on financial aid to pay
for Stanford's high tuition, and we hope
that the Financial Aid Office prioritizes all
forms of accessibility in order to provide
the best services to students.
