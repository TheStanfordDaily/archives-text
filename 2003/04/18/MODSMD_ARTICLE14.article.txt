# With distinction

### 
This week, seven undergraduates
from Stanford received the 2003
Dean's Award for Academic Ac
complishment, a prestigious honor
that is awarded annually to students who
have made impressive intellectual achieve
ments.
One of the winners, junior Mark Miller,
won for groundbreaking discoveries in
protein synthesis. Another winner, senior
Orlando Lara, was recognized for her wide
variety of contributions to the Institute for
the Diversity of the Arts. And junior Maya
Adam was recognized for her study on atti
tudes about stress and injuries among bal
let dancers.
We applaud the seven students for the
work that they have done that led to this
honor. They have pursued intellectual cu
riosities and published work that will be
read by many in the academic community.
Both of these goals are admirable in a uni

versity setting.
But, more importantly, we also want to
recognize the importance of academic
awards and distinctions at Stanford. In
many instances, accomplishments can go
unnoticed. In the realm of scholarly study,
years of research as undergraduates lead to
years of research as graduates, which led to
jobs and more research.
Furthermore, the award is especially im
portant in the sense that it honors the
achievements of undergraduates. In many
occasions, graduate students often publish
their work and receive outside recognition.
It's appropriate, every once in a while,
for the University to step back and ac
knowledge important work done by its
multi-talented undergraduates. The
Dean's Award for Academic Accomplish
ment has done just that for the last 16 years,
and we hope the University continues to
award it in vears to come.
