# ANIMAL FARM
## Shop 'till you drop 
### 
The first two weeks of
every quarter at Stan
ford are known as shop
ping period. This is a
quasi-unique phenomenon,
shared to my knowledge only with
1 larvard and Yale, where students
may come and go to classes and
don't face pressure of commit
ment.
Of course, professors do not
waste these two weeks, and a stu
dent is in trouble if she doesn't
start the reading before she is done
shopping. It's not academic anar
chy, but chaotic exploration.
The shopping period is pretty
much universally acknowledged
as a good idea. It's such a luxury to
shop a class that looked really ex
citing in the Bulletin, was excruci
atingly boring early Monday
morning and drop it Tuesday af
ternoon. You could replace that
hellish class with another course
recommended to you by some
friend who happened upon this
"amazing five unit course with
only one five-to-seven page paper
and film screenings."
Shopping period requires strat
egy. Each student has a different
approach to the two weeks, his
own mode of operation to tackle
the enormous challenge of finding
a suitable study list for the quarter.
However, some patterns do
emerge, exemplified in the follow
ing prototypical Stanford stu
dents.
•The 40-Unit Shopper: This is
the girl who gets to the mall at 9
a.m. December 26 to find the
biggest sales. She carries this über
enthusiasm to the next level when
it comes to her study list. Classes,
shoes or suitcases, it's all super
shopping to her. She shops six to
eight classes a day, making sure
that no potential diamonds slip
through her fingers. If you ask her

what classes she's taking, her re
sponse will likely be: "Welllthin
krmtakingEconsobutthat'sonlyi-
fldon'tgetintothisotherseminar-
butlstillhavethishumbioclassrmth
inkingabouttakingbecausethep
rofissupposedtobeawesome."
Avoid taking a class with this girl
at all costs. She does all the read
ing. And takes detailed notes.
•The Anti-Shopper: He's the

fine young man
who doesn't be
lieve in the shop
ping period at all.
He has a general
sense of what he
will take even be
fore the time
schedule goes up.
A brief perusal of

the time schedule confirms that
none of his classes conflict. He
signs up once on Axess and never
doubts himself.
But don't be fooled. He's prob
ably also a chemical engineering
major or a pre-med. He has no
choice in the matter. He knows
that the organic chemistry and
physics series are in his future. 1 lis
mother formulated his four year
plan during Freshman Orienta
tion.
•The Opportunist: This guy
isn't really a shopper either, but
pretends to be since it gives him a
two week grace period where he
can just skip class. You can find
him drinking at the CoHo for the
first week of the quarter, and
then during the second week, he
starts to formulate the skeleton of
his study list. He usually misses
the first section or two of any
given class and catches up on all
his reading the night before the
first midterm. If he does it at all.
He'll probably help the curve
out in this class, since he doesn't
really start the quarter until the

third week.
•The Romantic: Always living
in a dream, she has an unrealistic
self-perception. She shops a
bunch of classes, stacking on the
courses and CiERs, and then set
tles on her ideal 20 units. She al
ways ends up having too much
work and crumbles under the
pressure. I bis is the girl who cap
italizes on the drop deadline later
in the quarter. Her boastful 20
units always par down to a much
more realistic 15. Don't let her
make you feel inferior about your
measly 16 units. Her idealism
won't last. She suffers from acute
overconfidence in her ability to
take on challenges. She's also the
girl who thinks she can hook up
with that hot water polo player —
eye candy for all present —at
the frat party, too.
•Meet the GPA Hawk: The
guy who obsesses about every
grade. He needs to keep it at a 3.9
to get into law school, and he
doesn't let anything get in his
way. He uses shopping period to
his advantage because it gives
him a chance to keep a couple of
classes going, take the first
midterm and drop the class if he
bombs it. To him bombing is de
fined as a grade in the first stan
dard deviation above the mean.
This is clearly not a call to the
administration to eliminate the
shopping period — the Class of
2007 won't be able to go to any
Branner keggers, so don't take
away their measly right to shop
classes. As for the rest of us, we
handle the simple pleasure of
shopping classes quite different
ly, but when it comes right down
to it, it makes our academic class
es a lot easier to manage.

The first two weeks of
every quarter at Stan
ford are known as shop
ping period. This is a
quasi-unique phenomenon,
shared to my knowledge only with
1 larvard and Yale, where students
may come and go to classes and
don't face pressure of commit
ment.
Of course, professors do not
waste these two weeks, and a stu
dent is in trouble if she doesn't
start the reading before she is done
shopping. It's not academic anar
chy, but chaotic exploration.
The shopping period is pretty
much universally acknowledged
as a good idea. It's such a luxury to
shop a class that looked really ex
citing in the Bulletin, was excruci
atingly boring early Monday
morning and drop it Tuesday af
ternoon. You could replace that
hellish class with another course
recommended to you by some
friend who happened upon this
"amazing five unit course with
only one five-to-seven page paper
and film screenings."
Shopping period requires strat
egy. Each student has a different
approach to the two weeks, his
own mode of operation to tackle
the enormous challenge of finding
a suitable study list for the quarter.
However, some patterns do
emerge, exemplified in the follow
ing prototypical Stanford stu
dents.
•The 40-Unit Shopper: This is
the girl who gets to the mall at 9
a.m. December 26 to find the
biggest sales. She carries this über
enthusiasm to the next level when
it comes to her study list. Classes,
shoes or suitcases, it's all super
shopping to her. She shops six to
eight classes a day, making sure
that no potential diamonds slip
through her fingers. If you ask her

what classes she's taking, her re
sponse will likely be: "Welllthin
krmtakingEconsobutthat'sonlyi-
fldon'tgetintothisotherseminar-
butlstillhavethishumbioclassrmth
inkingabouttakingbecausethep
rofissupposedtobeawesome."
Avoid taking a class with this girl
at all costs. She does all the read
ing. And takes detailed notes.
•The Anti-Shopper: He's the

fine young man
who doesn't be
lieve in the shop
ping period at all.
He has a general
sense of what he
will take even be
fore the time
schedule goes up.
A brief perusal of

the time schedule confirms that
none of his classes conflict. He
signs up once on Axess and never
doubts himself.
But don't be fooled. He's prob
ably also a chemical engineering
major or a pre-med. He has no
choice in the matter. He knows
that the organic chemistry and
physics series are in his future. 1 lis
mother formulated his four year
plan during Freshman Orienta
tion.
•The Opportunist: This guy
isn't really a shopper either, but
pretends to be since it gives him a
two week grace period where he
can just skip class. You can find
him drinking at the CoHo for the
first week of the quarter, and
then during the second week, he
starts to formulate the skeleton of
his study list. He usually misses
the first section or two of any
given class and catches up on all
his reading the night before the
first midterm. If he does it at all.
He'll probably help the curve
out in this class, since he doesn't
really start the quarter until the

third week.
•The Romantic: Always living
in a dream, she has an unrealistic
self-perception. She shops a
bunch of classes, stacking on the
courses and CiERs, and then set
tles on her ideal 20 units. She al
ways ends up having too much
work and crumbles under the
pressure. I bis is the girl who cap
italizes on the drop deadline later
in the quarter. Her boastful 20
units always par down to a much
more realistic 15. Don't let her
make you feel inferior about your
measly 16 units. Her idealism
won't last. She suffers from acute
overconfidence in her ability to
take on challenges. She's also the
girl who thinks she can hook up
with that hot water polo player —
eye candy for all present —at
the frat party, too.
•Meet the GPA Hawk: The
guy who obsesses about every
grade. He needs to keep it at a 3.9
to get into law school, and he
doesn't let anything get in his
way. He uses shopping period to
his advantage because it gives
him a chance to keep a couple of
classes going, take the first
midterm and drop the class if he
bombs it. To him bombing is de
fined as a grade in the first stan
dard deviation above the mean.
This is clearly not a call to the
administration to eliminate the
shopping period — the Class of
2007 won't be able to go to any
Branner keggers, so don't take
away their measly right to shop
classes. As for the rest of us, we
handle the simple pleasure of
shopping classes quite different
ly, but when it comes right down
to it, it makes our academic class
es a lot easier to manage.
