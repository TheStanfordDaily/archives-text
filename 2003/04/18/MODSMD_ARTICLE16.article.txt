Lightweight crew coverage should focus
on performance, not on weight issues
The recent general article on the Stan
ford women's lightweight crew team,
"Lightweights Pack Punch" (March 10),
while well-written, failed to capture that the
essence of our sport is rowing, not making
weight. The majority of the article was de
voted to chronicling a weigh-in in detail,
which only composes the first 15 minutes of
a two and a half-hour practice. It is undeni
able that weight is an element of our sport.
It is equally an element of other athletics
such as wrestling, but the emphasis remains
on the sport, not the weight of the athletes.
In fact, for most of us, the weight limit is
not an all-consuming burden, but rather
what allows us to be competitive in a sport
where height and weight create power. The
lightweight category enables rowers of a
similar size to race against each other. As a
team, we meet at the Ford Center to row
and erg eight times a week and additional
ly on our own, because we are athletes who
want to train hard and win our races.
Crew is an endurance sport, and for
Stanford to lx- competitive, we must put iti

hours of training and conditioning. This is
what our energy and thoughts go into,
rather than dieting. Our goal this year is to
defend last year's first place finish at the Pa
cific Coast Rowing Championships and to
medal at Nationals in June.
We are appreciative of The Daily's cov
erage of our race last weekend and hope
that future articles continue to foc us on our
competitions.

Ethnic theme dorms offer opportunities
for real discussions on diversity
In the column, "Voluntary segregation,"
(April 17), for Uri Pomerantz to compare
Stanford students who choose to live in eth
nic theme houses to modern-day George
Wallaces is not only offensive but far
fetched. Why in the world we can't leave
this issue alone is beyond me. And I wonder
if Pomerant/ has ever lived in an ethnic
theme dorm or even visited one for more
than a second. His portrayal of interactions
in theme dorms as compared to his person
al experiences show an extreme ignorance
of ethnic theme house culture.

As a resident in an ethnic dorm, I would
say that there is more of a community here
and more emphasis on making friendships
across ethnic/cultural lines than in my aill
frosh dorm last year. Pomerantz, in his blaz
ing critique, failed to mention that all ethnic
theme hoi lses are only 50 percent of that eth
nicity. Some may write this off as just a num
ber; yet, when you live in the reality of the sit
uation, you realize that the interactions be
tween the different ethnicities within the
dorm are what build and fuel community.
It's the interaction that diversity advo
cates long for. This isn't to say that commu
nication is easy; it's very hard at times and
people sometimes do feel left out. But
what's so great about ethnic theme dorms is
that they don't encourage people to sweep
differences under the rug and ignore con
flicts. We talk about them. We argue about
them. We share. And that is how real rela
tionships are formed. I'm glad I chose to
live in Ujamaa this year because I saw just
what I was missing last year. In non- ethnic
theme dorms, the atmosphere is predomi
nantly white and discussion of pressing is
sues regarding cross-cultural relationships
are definitely not stressed; maybe ad
dressed in a "diversity"-themed discussion
here or there. Personally, I know it hurts for
those who are cultural / ethnic minorities in
those dorms who, for the most part, relate

to dormmates on the surface level to avoid
true discussion. Opponents to theme hous
es want to have easy interactions with mi
norities so they can say "Oh yeah, my drink
ing buddy/ frat brother ... etc. is black or
latino ... etc. and things are cool" but they
don't really confront real issues. In those
dorms, to actually build a strong c ross-cul
tural relationship you have to do it actively,
on your own and a lot of people don't try.
Theme dorms are a blessing in that they
make it their mission to build such a foun
dation for all residents. "To live together
with people only like you is to live apart
from society. Period." Well said. Yet most of
us come from highly segregated and isolat
ed neighborhoods anyway (by the way,
that's real residential segregation). Ever
wonder what politicians, city planners and
others for years have been trying to do
about that problem? To create models that
resemble Ujamaa, ()kada, (-asa Zapata and
Muwekma Tah-Ruk.

, Theme dorms are a "resource that
should be treasured and highly valued'
In response to Uri Pomerantz's column,

I would have to say that living in an ethnic
theme dorm, Casa Zapata, has been one of
t lie most enriching and eye-opening experi
ences I have been a part of here at Stanford.
While some may envision the perfect so
ciety to be completely integrated, evenly dis
tributed and multicultural on a person-to
person basis, the reality is that our world is
made up of distinct nations and people
groups. In order to foster multicultural re
lations in our "segregated" world, we as stu
dents need to learn how to engage with
communities and people groups, not just in
dividuals. 1 see ethnic theme dorms as a re
source that should be treasured and highly
valued as we learn to be interconnected and
ethnically sensitive members of society.
As an Asian-American student, I have
found that engaging in a community that is
different from my own has been a fabulous
by-product of the existence of ethnic theme
dorms at Stanford. Perhaps the solution is
for students who have normally found di
versity within their Draw groups to also try
engaging with diversity beyond their
groups of friends, whether that be through
ethnic dorms or student communities. 1 c an
only speak for what I have experienced,
and it's been a wealth of blessing.
