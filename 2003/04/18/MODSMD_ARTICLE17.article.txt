# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## University has a right to be concerned with underage alcohol use 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: Hie editorial board is composed of
seven members: the editor in chief , managing ed
itor for special sections, two opinions editors and
three community members-at-large. If members
of the editorial board disagree with the stance of
the board on a particular opinion, they are al
lowed to submit a guest column expressing their
views. The following is a guest column that takes
a different stance to the editorial, "Alcohol Poli
cy ill-conceived," that was printed in yesterday's
Daily.
In many countries around the world,
citizens are subject to lax drinking laws
and are usually allowed to make their
own choices concerning when and where
to drink. In the United States, however,
the government has decided that indi
viduals under 21 should not be allowed
to consume alcohol. In reality, many
young people drink — in large quanti
ties and often — especially in college
where alcohol drives many parties and is
widely and easily available. The combi
nation of being away from home — away
from parental supervision — and having

easy access to alcohol creates very tempt
ing conditions, particularly for fresh
men, who may come to Stanford having
had little experience with alcohol.
On April 15, students found out that
the administration would ban alcohol in
all-freshmen dorm events. For many stu
dents who are used to the independence
that Stanford offers, the new rule signi
fies a blow to the freedoms of college life.
Yet I believe the administration has a
right to be concerned.
A recent Harvard School of Public
1 lealth College Alcohol Study found that
binge and social drinking on college
campuses leads to 1,400 deaths, 50,000
injuries and 70,000 cases of sexual as
sault each year. Many of these fatalities
occur when individuals lose their sense
of judgement and attempt crazy stunts
or drink and drive. Other studies have
determined that some universities with
stricter enforcement policies, including
banning alcohol in freshman dorms,
have curbed drinking and resulted in
fewer alcohol-related fatalities and in
juries. And, at an institution that places a
high priority on education, there is no

doubt that University administrators
care about the many health problems as
sociated with binge drinking, including
memory loss and cognitive impairment.
The principle in the recent addition to
the alcohol policy is valid: Freshman
dorms, where nearly every resident (ex
cept for maybe a few dorm stall mem
bers) is under 21 years of age, should not
really have the option of freely serving
alcohol. Considering the many dangers
of underage binge drinking, the Univer
sity simply cannot knowingly allow fresh
men — individuals that are under the
legal drinking age — to serve and con
sume alcohol at dorm events. Students
are never happy about restrictions on
their freedoms, but the University did
not create the age limit for drinking —
it's the law.
While 1 agree with the intentions of
the University's new policy, there are
still many inherent problems with the
new policy that I believe should be ad
dressed.
The biggest concern to RFs, RAs and
students is how student behavior will be
regulated. In many of colleges around

the country, RAs must enforce the rules,
often straining friendships and trust be
tween residents and dorm staff. At Stan
ford, this dorm staff and student rela
tionship is different. Students are
proud to say to their peers at other uni
versities that they are friends with their
RAs. Many students have argued that
the new policy will destroy this impor
tant relationship. But these friendships
are not solely based on rules and en
forcement — or the freedom to serve
alcohol. Good communication between
dorm staff and students will hopefully
resolve some of these issues. It is impor
tant to note that the University did not
completely ban drinking in dorm halls,
rooms and lounges — the new addition
simply states that dorm events may not
serve alcohol. RAs will not have to police
the halls at every moment.
Clearly, the administration does not
want to banish enjoyment from fresh
man events, but allowing hundreds of
underage students to partake in binge
drinking in all-freshman housing is not
in anyone's best interest. One could
argue that college students — most of

them legal adults — should be able to
make reasonable choices. But clearly,
1,400 alcohol-related deaths a year
proves that this is not the case. The
question then remains: Is it the Univer
sity's duty to regulate the consumption
of alcohol? The new addition to the pol
icy indicates that the University feels re
sponsible for its student residents — as
it rightly should. Yet the policy needs to
be evaluated and more clearly defined
in order to avoid future problems.
1 strongly hope that Residential Ed
ucation further consults RAs and RFs
before the implementation of this poli
cy to make the necessary modifications
in vague wording and enforcement.
Meanwhile, students should use their
best judgement when choosing to con
sume alcohol in order to avoid becom
ing part of the staggering alcohol-relat
ed death, injury and sexual assault
statistics.
