## Card hits road with Pac-10 title at stake 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford (19-3, 5-0
Pacific-10 Conference) men's ten
nis team faces its toughest road trip
of the season when it travels to
Southern California this weekend
with the Pac-10 championship at
stake.

Men's Tennis
Friday: No. 5 Stanford at No. 3 UCLA
Saturday: Stanford at No. 21 USC

The Cardinal takes on No. 3
UCLA (19-2, 5-0) on Friday and
then wraps up the regular season at
No. 21 Southern Cal (13-9, 2-3) on
Saturday.
The Pac-10 champion will be
crowned by Saturday afternoon
with three of the top five programs
in the nation competing for the
title.
Stanford and UCLA have per
fect 5-0 conference records while
No. 4 Cal is 3-1.
Stanford, UCLA and USC have
been the only schools to win the
Pac-10 title in conference history.
The Bruins have been champions
21 times while the Cardinal and the
Trojans each have claimed the
honor 13 times.
If the Cardinal wants to take
home its 14th title, it will have to win
Friday's showdown against UCLA

The two schools have already
played once this season, with the
Bruins posting a 5-2 win at the
Taube Family Tennis Center on
March 5 in a match that didn't
count in the conference standings.
"We could have easily won that
match," senior All-American Scott
l.ipksy said. "We narrowly lost the
doubles point and most of the
singles matches were close."
UCLA will be even stronger than
in the last encounter because they
were playing without their No. 2
singles player, Marcin Matkowski,
who was playing in the Davis Cup
for his native Poland.
Moreover, the Bruins will be
playing on their home courts this
time around. Lipsky believes the
Cardinal can indeed pull off an
upset.
"If we compete the way we're ca
pable of competing and the way
we've competed in the past, we'll
give ourselves the opportunity to
win," he said.
Winning the doubles point will
be critical to a Cardinal victory.
"In order to beat UCLA, we're
going to need a solid performance
in doubles to start off with," Lipsky
said. "We can't afford to start the
singles down 1-0 to teams of that
caliber."
Coach Dick Gould asserts this
weekend will be crucial and doesn't
want the Cardinal to overlook the

USC match on Saturday.
"If we finish at 20-4 or 21 -3, then
that puts us in really good shape for
the nationals," Could said. "If we
stub our toe against USC, then it
will be a little bit tougher.
But wining the Pac-10 isn't the
only Cardinal goal.
"It's always nice to win the Pac
-10 championship, but that's not
what we play for," Lipsky said. "We
play for the NCA Vs in May and as

long as we're peaking at the light
time, the Pac-lOs are not a big deal.
"If we win it, it will be a bonus.
We're all focused on winning an
NCAA team title this year and none
of us are worried about the extra
accolades."
After the USC match, the Pac-10
individual championships are next
up on April 24 in Ojai, Calif. Stan
lord will send eight players to the
four-day event.
