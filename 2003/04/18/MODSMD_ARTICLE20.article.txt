# Crew coach brings new attitude
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's crew team practice
was wrapping up at eight on
Wednesday morning but, with the
men's coaching launch almost
back to shore, there was suddenly
a slight problem.
The launch ran out of gas. As the
engine sputtered and died, men's
coach Craig Amerkhanian urged
the boat forward, as if hoping to get
to shore by sheer willpower.
Being stranded in a launch
without fuel might panic a lesser
person, but Amerkhanian brought
to the situation the same determi
nation and bullish optimism that
he often uses while coaching.
"C'mon baby, gimmie one
more drop," Amerkhanian said,
looking toward shore where other
launches, with their full gas cans,

were tied. "I wanna get that gas
right there, I can smell it."
A short burst of power used up
the last of the gas fumes, leaving
tlu* launch still stranded in the bay.
After jokingly suggesting that
the rower in the launch should
swim for it, Amerkhanian called to
the varsity eight as they passed and
had the men tow him the last few
feet to the dtx k.
A dead launch does not neces
sarily heed Amcrkhanian's boister
ous commands, but rowers arc a
more responsive crowd, especially
when the coaching includes a mix
ture of passion and humor.
()ut on the water, especially, in
spiration must be inventive.
In a more colorful command
during practice, Amerkhanian de
scribed how the rowers should get
more compression at the catch by
squeezing their bent legs against

their bodies.
"You're tasting kneecap and
you're enjoying the flavor,"
Amerkhanian said. "Got a little
BBQ sauce on there, I'm talking
Trader Joe's, one of the finest
BBQ sauces out there â€” high in
sugar, but delicate on the meats."
To motivate the rowers,
Amerkhanian also used more
blunt reminders of the intensity of
spring racing.
"Everything we do, walking to
t lass, doing weights, is focused on
the boat," Amerkhanian told the
men as they began a set of drills.
"This is the boat moving season."
Amerkhanian's go-get-'em atti
tude has been infectious on the
team. Randall Graham, seat-rac

The Stanford men's crew team, which will be in tomorrow's Redwood Shores Race, is led by second-year coach Craig
Amerkhanian. Last year, he guided the Cardinal to a 1 2th-place finish nationally, the program's best in five years.
