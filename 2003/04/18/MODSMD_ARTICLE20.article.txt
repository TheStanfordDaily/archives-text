# Crew coach brings new attitude
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's crew team practice
was wrapping up at eight on
Wednesday morning but, with the
men's coaching launch almost
back to shore, there was suddenly
a slight problem.
The launch ran out of gas. As the
engine sputtered and died, men's
coach Craig Amerkhanian urged
the boat forward, as if hoping to get
to shore by sheer willpower.
Being stranded in a launch
without fuel might panic a lesser
person, but Amerkhanian brought
to the situation the same determi
nation and bullish optimism that
he often uses while coaching.
"C'mon baby, gimmie one
more drop," Amerkhanian said,
looking toward shore where other
launches, with their full gas cans,

were tied. "I wanna get that gas
right there, I can smell it."
A short burst of power used up
the last of the gas fumes, leaving
tlu* launch still stranded in the bay.
After jokingly suggesting that
the rower in the launch should
swim for it, Amerkhanian called to
the varsity eight as they passed and
had the men tow him the last few
feet to the dtx k.
A dead launch does not neces
sarily heed Amcrkhanian's boister
ous commands, but rowers arc a
more responsive crowd, especially
when the coaching includes a mix
ture of passion and humor.
()ut on the water, especially, in
spiration must be inventive.
In a more colorful command
during practice, Amerkhanian de
scribed how the rowers should get
more compression at the catch by
squeezing their bent legs against

their bodies.
"You're tasting kneecap and
you're enjoying the flavor,"
Amerkhanian said. "Got a little
BBQ sauce on there, I'm talking
Trader Joe's, one of the finest
BBQ sauces out there — high in
sugar, but delicate on the meats."
To motivate the rowers,
Amerkhanian also used more
blunt reminders of the intensity of
spring racing.
"Everything we do, walking to
t lass, doing weights, is focused on
the boat," Amerkhanian told the
men as they began a set of drills.
"This is the boat moving season."
Amerkhanian's go-get-'em atti
tude has been infectious on the

second varsity team had "never
performed this well before."
"This is probably the fastest sec
ond varsity we've had." Graham
said. "We're starting to beat
schools we haven't beat before."
About the upcoming Redwood
Shores race on Saturday against
UC-Davis and UCLA, Graham was
equally confident.
"We'll win," he said.
Although he thinks the men
have a good chance against their
opponents this weekend,
Amerkhanian does not believe in
presupposing a certain outcome.
"I don't predict, that's why they
race," he said, adding, "I know
they'll do their best, though."

The race this weekend has
more significance than simply bol
stering the standings of the Cardi
nal crew.
For the varsity men particular
ly, who performed poorly in the
San Diego Crew Classic finals, win
ning the race this weekend is a
matter of pride.
"It's important because we had
a really bad race in San Diego,"
varsity rower Robert Evans said.
"It's important for us to get back
on track."
A Stanford win is well within
reach of the team. Although there
were problems in the Cardinal
boat during the finals of the San
Diego Crew Classic, in the heats
the day before Stanford varsity
men beat the Golden Bears by al
most 18 seconds.
"We didn't have the perfor
mance we wanted last week," said

junior Eric Shedlosky after trading
places with Graham in the launch
during practice. Asked if the Car
dinal would win this weekend,
Shedlosky was cautiously positive.
"We should, yeah, barring any
unfortunate circumstances," he
said.
As Shedlosky spoke, the varsity
and junior varsity boats suddenly
stopped in the middle of practice.
In the varsity boat, a piece of Evans'
equipment had come apart.
One of the small nuts holding his
rigging, which keeps the oar at
tached to the boat, had fallen into
the water.
Pulling up alongside,
Amerkhanian opened his toolbox.
He threw two nuts to Evans, but
each time there was a small plunk
as the nut hit the water.
Finally Amerkhanian held up
the third nut for Evans to catch.

"This is the challenge," he said.
"It's too small; we can't see it,"
replied bow man Bryant Helvey.
But Amerkhanian tossed the
piece anyway, sending the nut in a
perfect arc toward the boat. The
nut was nearly invisible, a tiny gray
speck flying over the water.
But, with Amerkhanian's chal
lenge, it was now more than a piece
of metal — it represented the
power and potential of the team.
Evans watched carefully as the
nut came toward him. As it was
about to pass over his head, Evans
reached out and plucked the nut
out of the air.
Without another word, the men
picked up their practice where
they had left off.

"I don't predict, that's why they
race," he said, adding, "I know
they'll do their best, though."

The race this weekend has
more significance than simply bol
stering the standings of the Cardi
nal crew.
For the varsity men particular
ly, who performed poorly in the
San Diego Crew Classic finals, win
ning the race this weekend is a
matter of pride.
"It's important because we had
a really bad race in San Diego,"
varsity rower Robert Evans said.
"It's important for us to get back
on track."
A Stanford win is well within
reach of the team. Although there
were problems in the Cardinal
boat during the finals of the San
Diego Crew Classic, in the heats
the day before Stanford varsity
men beat the Golden Bears by al
most 18 seconds.
"We didn't have the perfor
mance we wanted last week," said

junior Eric Shedlosky after trading
places with Graham in the launch
during practice. Asked if the Car
dinal would win this weekend,
Shedlosky was cautiously positive.
"We should, yeah, barring any
unfortunate circumstances," he
said.
As Shedlosky spoke, the varsity
and junior varsity boats suddenly
stopped in the middle of practice.
In the varsity boat, a piece of Evans'
equipment had come apart.
One of the small nuts holding his
rigging, which keeps the oar at
tached to the boat, had fallen into
the water.
Pulling up alongside,
Amerkhanian opened his toolbox.
He threw two nuts to Evans, but
each time there was a small plunk
as the nut hit the water.
Finally Amerkhanian held up
the third nut for Evans to catch.

"This is the challenge," he said.
"It's too small; we can't see it,"
replied bow man Bryant Helvey.
But Amerkhanian tossed the
piece anyway, sending the nut in a
perfect arc toward the boat. The
nut was nearly invisible, a tiny gray
speck flying over the water.
But, with Amerkhanian's chal
lenge, it was now more than a piece
of metal — it represented the
power and potential of the team.
Evans watched carefully as the
nut came toward him. As it was
about to pass over his head, Evans
reached out and plucked the nut
out of the air.
Without another word, the men
picked up their practice where
they had left off.
The men's and women's crew
teams will race at the Stanford In
vitational this Saturday on the
Redwood Shores racecourse.
The men's crew team practice
was wrapping up at eight on
Wednesday morning but, with the
men's coaching launch almost
back to shore, there was suddenly
a slight problem.
The launch ran out of gas. As the
engine sputtered and died, men's
coach Craig Amerkhanian urged
the boat forward, as if hoping to get
to shore by sheer willpower.
Being stranded in a launch
without fuel might panic a lesser
person, but Amerkhanian brought
to the situation the same determi
nation and bullish optimism that
he often uses while coaching.
"C'mon baby, gimmie one
more drop," Amerkhanian said,
looking toward shore where other
launches, with their full gas cans,

were tied. "I wanna get that gas
right there, I can smell it."
A short burst of power used up
the last of the gas fumes, leaving
tlu* launch still stranded in the bay.
After jokingly suggesting that
the rower in the launch should
swim for it, Amerkhanian called to
the varsity eight as they passed and
had the men tow him the last few
feet to the dtx k.
A dead launch does not neces
sarily heed Amcrkhanian's boister
ous commands, but rowers arc a
more responsive crowd, especially
when the coaching includes a mix

()ut on the water, especially, in
spiration must be inventive.
In a more colorful command
during practice, Amerkhanian de
scribed how the rowers should get
more compression at the catch by
squeezing their bent legs against

their bodies.
"You're tasting kneecap and
you're enjoying the flavor,"
Amerkhanian said. "Got a little
BBQ sauce on there, I'm talking
Trader Joe's, one of the finest
BBQ sauces out there — high in
sugar, but delicate on the meats."
To motivate the rowers,
Amerkhanian also used more
blunt reminders of the intensity of
spring racing.
"Everything we do, walking to
t lass, doing weights, is focused on
the boat," Amerkhanian told the
men as they began a set of drills.
"This is the boat moving season."
Amerkhanian's go-get-'em atti
tude has been infectious on the
team. Randall Graham, seat-rac

About the upcoming Redwood

UC-Davis and UCLA, Graham was
equally confident.
