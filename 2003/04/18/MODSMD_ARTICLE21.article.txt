# Croquet isn't just an Englishman's game
## 
### 
I'd just settled down at my
desk after lunch last week
when tlu' phone rang. It's
been ringing oil the hook of
late, which my roommate Jamie
and 1 have come to accept as the
inevitable result of being Stanford
student-playaz of our magnitude.
OK, so maybe when the ladies
on the other end aren't telemar
keters pitching credit card oilers
they're asking for some guy
named Greg — who apparently
failed to inform his family lie no

longer lives in
Robinson 408 —
but we're popular
guys this quarter,
nonetheless.
1 answer it and
it's our friend An
drew, known af
fectionately as
" The Mexican,"

who mumbles something com
pletely undecipherable into the
phone before getting to the only
words that matter:
"Do you guys wanna play?"
Is he kidding? On a Thursday
afternoon when I've got four
chapters of reading to complete
for class in an hour?
He didn't have to ask.
Within seconds, I get my keys,
give Jamie the nod and the text
book in his hands hits the floor.
We're out the door like Roy
Williams because it's blankety
blankin' croquet time and next to
nothing takes precedence over
croquet time.
On our bicycle pilgrimage
across campus, we pass mere mor
tals amusing themselves like giddy
little schoolgirls during recess with
blase games of basketball, Frisbee
and soccer.
One of Stanford's finest, in all
his citation-writing glory, waits ;it
an intersection for some unsus
pecting victim late for I-I him sec -
tion with no intentions of stopping
and suddenly the bitterness I
would normally feel for that ticket
he wrote me last month fades away
with the happy thoughts of what
lies ahead.
Dude, snap out of it. You're
talking about croquet here. Who
are vou?

1 know what you're probably
thinking. C-roquet is for haughty
taughty Englishmen sporting V
neck sweaters and white short
shorts, sipping tea and nibbling
crumpets while their servant
Jeeves brings them cream and
sugar on a silver platter.
Rest assured, we aren't those
dudes. Nor are we sketchy grad
students, English majors or the
" Backyard ('-roquet Club" for that
matter.
We're Scott, Jamie, Stephen,
|< >st\ Ricky, Mexican Andrew and,
occasionally, Nam.
We're more hardcore than bio
core, a motley crew of techies and
fu/zies, freshmen and sopho
mores, skilled and unskilled.
And several times a week, we
are croquet warriors who descend
upon Manzanita Park to wreak
havoc beneath the blazing ball of
fire that shines above.
Weapons?
You bet.
Six colored wooden mallets
with a colossal — and detachable,
for easy storage — hammerhead,
enough to make any grown man
cry and call for his mommy.
Balls?
We got 'em.
Six, in fact, in red, orange, yel
low, green, blue and — no, not
purple — black. This is how we
roll.
Nine wickets and two stakes dot
the smooth, freshly cut natural
grass surface in a figure-eight pat
tern Michelle Kwan couldn't make
look prettier that stretches from
one end of the field to the other.
The objective is simple: hit yoi$
ball through the nine wickets be
fore everyone else.
Mere leisure to some, we take
our croquet seriously.
Some of us spend hours
dwelling on the win-loss percent
ages Stephen e-mails out, contem
plating what might have been.
Many a night my roommate has
lost sleep over a missed two-foot
shot that cost him what looked like
a sure win.
That's understandable, con
sidering since we started play


Scott Allen
ing, 10-foot shots have become
routine.
We're constantly second guess
ing each other's strategy, or lack
thereof. Croquet can be thought of
as a life-size combination of pool
and chess, where fine accuracy
and thinking ahead are important,
but the game is only as strategic as
you choose to make it.
Thinking too hard about a shot
can be disastrous, especially when
Jose, whose trademark is declar
ing "game over" when one of us
gets as much as a two-wicket lead,
mutters just loud enough for you
to hear, "He always makes this
shot."
The pressure! Sometimes, you
just gotta grip it and rip it.
We talk more trash than Reggie
Miller, with insults ranging from
the sophisticate and complex

("You know absolutely nothing
about physics!") to the pointed and
trite ("Eat a dick!").
Only at Stanford.
Recently, our games have been
tarnished somewhat. Game after
game of long shots, shanks and
the occasional John McEnroe
anger-management toss left (he
majority of the mallets cracked,
deformed and wrapped in
enough duct tape to fend off a bi
ological attack.
But 1 received an e-mail this
week with "Glorious news" written
in the subject line and "The Mag
nificence!" typed in the body.
Attached was a photograph of six
shiny new mallets Stephen had
sent away for.
They have arrived and that's
glorious news, indeed.
It's croquet time.

I'd just settled down at my
desk after lunch last week
when tlu' phone rang. It's
been ringing oil the hook of
late, which my roommate Jamie
and 1 have come to accept as the
inevitable result of being Stanford
student-playaz of our magnitude.
OK, so maybe when the ladies
on the other end aren't telemar
keters pitching credit card oilers
they're asking for some guy
named Greg — who apparently
failed to inform his family lie no

longer lives in
Robinson 408 —
but we're popular
guys this quarter,
nonetheless.
1 answer it and
it's our friend An
drew, known af
fectionately as
" The Mexican,"

who mumbles something com
pletely undecipherable into the
phone before getting to the only
words that matter:
"Do you guys wanna play?"
Is he kidding? On a Thursday
afternoon when I've got four
chapters of reading to complete
for class in an hour?
He didn't have to ask.
Within seconds, I get my keys,
give Jamie the nod and the text
book in his hands hits the floor.
We're out the door like Roy
Williams because it's blankety
blankin' croquet time and next to
nothing takes precedence over
croquet time.
On our bicycle pilgrimage
across campus, we pass mere mor
tals amusing themselves like giddy
little schoolgirls during recess with
blase games of basketball, Frisbee
and soccer.
One of Stanford's finest, in all
his citation-writing glory, waits ;it
an intersection for some unsus
pecting victim late for I-I him sec -
tion with no intentions of stopping
and suddenly the bitterness I
would normally feel for that ticket
he wrote me last month fades away
with the happy thoughts of what
lies ahead.
Dude, snap out of it. You're
talking about croquet here. Who
are vou?

1 know what you're probably
thinking. C-roquet is for haughty
taughty Englishmen sporting V
neck sweaters and white short
shorts, sipping tea and nibbling
crumpets while their servant
Jeeves brings them cream and
sugar on a silver platter.
Rest assured, we aren't those
dudes. Nor are we sketchy grad
students, English majors or the
" Backyard ('-roquet Club" for that
matter.
We're Scott, Jamie, Stephen,
|< >st\ Ricky, Mexican Andrew and,
occasionally, Nam.
We're more hardcore than bio
core, a motley crew of techies and
fu/zies, freshmen and sopho
mores, skilled and unskilled.
And several times a week, we
are croquet warriors who descend
upon Manzanita Park to wreak
havoc beneath the blazing ball of
fire that shines above.
Weapons?
You bet.
Six colored wooden mallets
with a colossal — and detachable,
for easy storage — hammerhead,
enough to make any grown man
cry and call for his mommy.
Balls?
We got 'em.
Six, in fact, in red, orange, yel
low, green, blue and — no, not
purple — black. This is how we
roll.
Nine wickets and two stakes dot
the smooth, freshly cut natural
grass surface in a figure-eight pat
tern Michelle Kwan couldn't make
look prettier that stretches from
one end of the field to the other.
The objective is simple: hit yoi$
ball through the nine wickets be
fore everyone else.
Mere leisure to some, we take
our croquet seriously.
Some of us spend hours
dwelling on the win-loss percent
