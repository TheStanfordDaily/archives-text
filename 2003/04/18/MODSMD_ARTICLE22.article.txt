Men's Volleyball
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford vs. No. 6 UC-lrvine, 7 p.m.

If history means anything, that's a good sign.
Stanford (17-11, 14-8 MPSF) last hosted a play
off game six years ago — when it won its first (and
only, to date) NCAA title.
Since then, the Cardinal — which has advanced
to the MSPFTournament in five of the last six years
— has reached no further than the quarterfinals.
Tomorrow, Stanford looks to rediscover its post
season winning ways in a first-round MSPF match

As if to underscore the difficulty of the MSPF,
both teams — ranked in the top-10 nationally —
are the fourth (Stanford) and fifth (UC-lrvine)
seeds in the tournament, respectively.
fhe No. 4 Cardinal wrapped up homecourt ad
vantage for the playoff game with a 30-27, 30-27,
32-30 win over the Anteaters last weekend in a pre
view of this weekend's action.
Stanford enters the key portion of the season on
a five-game winning streak, including sweeps over
UC-San Diego (last Tuesday), UCLA (last Friday),

can be directly attributed to the return of All-Amer
ican hitter Curt Toppel.
Toppel strained an abdominal muscle in early
February and missed 11 games — half of the regu
lar season — while Stanford tried to play without
him.
And it's clear he's all the way back after being
