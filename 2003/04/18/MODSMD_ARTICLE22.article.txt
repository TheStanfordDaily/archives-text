1 he Stanford men's volleyball team will play
host fora Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play
off game t his weekend for the first time since 1997.

Men's Volleyball
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford vs. No. 6 UC-lrvine, 7 p.m.

If history means anything, that's a good sign.
Stanford (17-11, 14-8 MPSF) last hosted a play
off game six years ago — when it won its first (and
only, to date) NCAA title.
Since then, the Cardinal — which has advanced
to the MSPFTournament in five of the last six years
— has reached no further than the quarterfinals.
Tomorrow, Stanford looks to rediscover its post
season winning ways in a first-round MSPF match
up against No. 6 UC-Irvine (19-10, 12-10).
As if to underscore the difficulty of the MSPF,
both teams — ranked in the top-10 nationally —
are the fourth (Stanford) and fifth (UC-lrvine)
seeds in the tournament, respectively.
fhe No. 4 Cardinal wrapped up homecourt ad
vantage for the playoff game with a 30-27, 30-27,
32-30 win over the Anteaters last weekend in a pre
view of this weekend's action.
Stanford enters the key portion of the season on
a five-game winning streak, including sweeps over
UC-San Diego (last Tuesday), UCLA (last Friday),
and UC-lrvine.
It beat then-No. 4 Pacific and produced a
tremendous comeback against Long Beach State.
The hot streak allowed Stanford to jump from
10 to four in the national polls in only two weeks.
That the Cardinal is peaking at the right time
can be directly attributed to the return of All-Amer
ican hitter Curt Toppel.
Toppel strained an abdominal muscle in early
February and missed 11 games — half of the regu
lar season — while Stanford tried to play without
him.
And it's clear he's all the way back after being

last week.
But were it not for contribu
tions from players like Kevin
Hansen (this week's recipient of
the weekly award), the Cardinal
might be in trouble.
This week, the redshirt sopho
more setter led the Cardinal with a
.357 hitting percentage and added
143 assists, 25 digs and eight
blocks.
Stanford will need him to step
up against the Anteaters, against
whom it went 2-1 this year — win
ning the last two with Toppel back
in the lineup.
"Both teams will be better pre
pared this time," coach Don Shaw
said. "We've played them with
Curt back in the lineup, so they
will have been able to prepare for
him better."

Irvine's offense has plenty of
power with junior outside hitter
Jimmy Pelzel, who has been strong
for the Anteaters all season..
In the teams' previous three
meetings, Pel/el racked up a total
of 60 kills and chipped in 14 digs.
Senior outside hitter Monte
Tucker was strong for the
Anteaters last weekend, lie
recorded 14 kills and had a match
high 12 digs.
Stanford will need the strong
defensive play that it showed on
Saturday in order to come away
with a victory.
But Shaw and the rest of the
Cardinal are eager to take the
court in quest of their first title in a
few years.
"I feel good about the fact that
when we take the court we are
going to be ready to play," Shaw
said. "1 think with the way we've
been playing and the way we've
been practicing, 1 have a pretty
good idea that we're going to play
well."
