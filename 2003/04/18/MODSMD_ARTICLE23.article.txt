# Villa to conclude outstanding career tonight

### FELIPE VALDEZ 
Brenda Villa is so much of a
water polo natural that you'd just
assume she wouldn't lit anywhere
else.

Women's Water Polo
Today: No. 3 Stanford vs. San Jose
State, 7 p.m.

Take Villa out of the pool, and
it might be like taking a fish out of
water.
Villa's coach, John Tanner,
wholeheartedly agrees.
"In watching her play, you'd
swear that she was born to play
water polo," he said.
Tonight marks the last time the
Stanford faithful get to see the
ultra-talented driver in regular
season action — along with fellow
seniors Julie Gardner, Jackie
Frank and Nicole I luszcz — when
No. 3 Stanford (16-2, 8-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
hosts No. 10 San Jose State (15-13,
3-6) at 7 p.m.

Villa came to Stanford in 1990
as the program's most heralded
recruit ever and has had no prob
lem living up to her billing.
After taking two years off to
train with the U.S National team
(and earning a silver medal with
the Olympic team in Sydney in
2000), Villa made an instant im
pact on the Farm.
She scored 51 goals her fresh
man year en route to being named
the NCAA Women's Water Polo
Player of the Year.
Last year, Villa netted 49 goals
and helped lead Stanford to its
first ever NCAA women's water
polo title.
Over the summer, she led the
U.S. National team to the gold
medal game of the FINA Women's
Water Polo World Cup in Perth,
Australia and led the international
tournament with nine goals.
And this year, she's scored 34
goals as she looks to help Stanford
defend its title. (The Cardinal will

clinch a No. 1 seed in the MSPF
Tournament held April 25 to 27 at
Stanford with a win tonight. It's
the first step for the Cardinal in de
fending its NCAA title.)
All in all, Villa (134 career goals)
should leave Stanford as the sec
ond-leading goal scorer in school
history behind 2002 grad Ellen
Estes.
That's quite a laundry list of ac
complishments, isn't it?
It's nothing new for the natural.
"Brenda has an amazing un
derstanding of the sport," Tanner
said. "It's uncanny how far in ad
vance she can predict [what hap
pens] in a game."
The 5-foot-4 driver also has
some physical skills that help her
create shots around defenders.
"She is a really explosive athlete
and it translates into great shoot
ing and scoring opportunities,"
Tanner said.
It has surprised no one in the
water polo community that Villa
has succeeded to the degree she
has.
But the senior concedes that
she's been challenged in other
ways under Tanner that have
helped her grow as a player.
"I've had to take on more of a
mentor role," she said. "Since I'm
not very patient, it has made me a
better player [in that] I've had to
reevaluate everything 1 do and be
able to explain it."
If fanner isanyjudge, Villa lias
adjusted quite nicely to that role.
"She's a very effective teacher,"
he said. "She understands the
game so well and passes on infor
mation [to other players]."
With all her accomplishments
in the sport, people forget Villa (in
her early, early years) seemed des
tined to be a swimmer.
Growing up in Commerce,
Calif., Villa became a swimmer at

her local club, Commerce Aquat
ics.
It was there, too, that she made
the fateful transition from swim
mer to water polo player at age
eight.
Rellec ting back on her career,
Villa didn't flinch fora second be
fore looking to last year's 8-4 win
over UCLA in the national cham
pionship game as the snapshot of
her career.
"Winning the NCAA champi
onship last year was really memo
rable because of all the heartache
ol losing the year before," she said.
for all of those people who were
in the dark, Stanford was undefeat
ed heading into the 2001 NCAA
title game at 27-0. But after a Bruin
goal with 1:28 left, the Cardinal
dropped its first game of the sea
son, 5-4, in agonizing fashion.
Villa had a chance to tie that
game with less than 20 seconds
left, but her shot was blocked by
the UCLA defense.
She obviously used that failure
to her advantage the next year.
And lanner and the rest of
Stanford has used her big name to
lure big-time recruits to Palo Alto
over the last few years to help so
lidify the Cardinal water polo pro
gram as one of the best in the
country. (Getting the Luber sis
ters, I lannah and kelty, for exam
ple, speaks to this immense impact
in recruiting.)
After graduating in June, Villa
will train with the national team
for the entire summer.
She hopes the team will qualify
for the Olympics at the Pan-Amer
ican Games in the Dominican Re
public and for the Summer
Olympics in Athens in 2004.
"It has definitely been a worth
while experience," Villa said of her
time at Stanford. "I think that
when I'm older, 1 will visit these
memories very frequently."
Vou can bet many people will
visit the memories she's created
in the last three years very fre
quently, too.

Tournament held April 25 to 27 at
Stanford with a win tonight. It's
the first step for the Cardinal in de
fending its NCAA title.)
All in all, Villa (134 career goals)
should leave Stanford as the sec
ond-leading goal scorer in school
history behind 2002 grad Ellen
Estes.
That's quite a laundry list of ac
complishments, isn't it?
It's nothing new for the natural.
"Brenda has an amazing un
derstanding of the sport," Tanner
said. "It's uncanny how far in ad
vance she can predict [what hap
pens] in a game."
The 5-foot-4 driver also has
some physical skills that help her
create shots around defenders.
"She is a really explosive athlete
and it translates into great shoot
ing and scoring opportunities,"
Tanner said.
It has surprised no one in the
water polo community that Villa
has succeeded to the degree she
has.
But the senior concedes that
she's been challenged in other
ways under Tanner that have
helped her grow as a player.
"I've had to take on more of a
mentor role," she said. "Since I'm
not very patient, it has made me a
better player [in that] I've had to
reevaluate everything 1 do and be
able to explain it."
If fanner isanyjudge, Villa lias
adjusted quite nicely to that role.
"She's a very effective teacher,"
he said. "She understands the
game so well and passes on infor
mation [to other players]."
With all her accomplishments
in the sport, people forget Villa (in
her early, early years) seemed des
tined to be a swimmer.
Growing up in Commerce,
Calif., Villa became a swimmer at

her local club, Commerce Aquat
ics.
It was there, too, that she made
the fateful transition from swim
mer to water polo player at age
eight.
Rellec ting back on her career,
Villa didn't flinch fora second be
fore looking to last year's 8-4 win
over UCLA in the national cham
pionship game as the snapshot of
her career.
"Winning the NCAA champi
onship last year was really memo
rable because of all the heartache
ol losing the year before," she said.
for all of those people who were
in the dark, Stanford was undefeat
ed heading into the 2001 NCAA
title game at 27-0. But after a Bruin
goal with 1:28 left, the Cardinal
dropped its first game of the sea
son, 5-4, in agonizing fashion.
Villa had a chance to tie that
game with less than 20 seconds
left, but her shot was blocked by
the UCLA defense.
She obviously used that failure
to her advantage the next year.
And lanner and the rest of
Stanford has used her big name to
lure big-time recruits to Palo Alto
over the last few years to help so
lidify the Cardinal water polo pro
gram as one of the best in the
country. (Getting the Luber sis
ters, I lannah and kelty, for exam
ple, speaks to this immense impact
in recruiting.)
After graduating in June, Villa
will train with the national team
for the entire summer.
She hopes the team will qualify
for the Olympics at the Pan-Amer
ican Games in the Dominican Re
public and for the Summer
Olympics in Athens in 2004.
"It has definitely been a worth
while experience," Villa said of her
time at Stanford. "I think that
when I'm older, 1 will visit these
memories very frequently."
Vou can bet many people will
visit the memories she's created
in the last three years very fre
quently, too.
Brenda Villa is so much of a
water polo natural that you'd just
assume she wouldn't lit anywhere
else.

Women's Water Polo
Today: No. 3 Stanford vs. San Jose
State, 7 p.m.

Take Villa out of the pool, and
it might be like taking a fish out of
water.
Villa's coach, John Tanner,
wholeheartedly agrees.
"In watching her play, you'd
swear that she was born to play
water polo," he said.
Tonight marks the last time the
Stanford faithful get to see the
ultra-talented driver in regular
season action — along with fellow
seniors Julie Gardner, Jackie
Frank and Nicole I luszcz — when
No. 3 Stanford (16-2, 8-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
hosts No. 10 San Jose State (15-13,
3-6) at 7 p.m.

Villa came to Stanford in 1990
as the program's most heralded
recruit ever and has had no prob
lem living up to her billing.
After taking two years off to
train with the U.S National team
(and earning a silver medal with
the Olympic team in Sydney in
2000), Villa made an instant im
pact on the Farm.
She scored 51 goals her fresh
man year en route to being named
the NCAA Women's Water Polo
Player of the Year.
Last year, Villa netted 49 goals
and helped lead Stanford to its
first ever NCAA women's water
polo title.
Over the summer, she led the
U.S. National team to the gold
medal game of the FINA Women's
Water Polo World Cup in Perth,
Australia and led the international
tournament with nine goals.
And this year, she's scored 34
goals as she looks to help Stanford
defend its title. (The Cardinal will
