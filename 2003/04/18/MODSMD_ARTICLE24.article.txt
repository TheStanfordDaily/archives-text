# Work starting to pay off for Gentry
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a freshman on the Stanford
men's golf team, Kyle Gentry is
learning that hard work off the
course can be just as important as
low scores in competition.
The 19-year-old from Carmel,
Calif, picked up the game early in
life and quickly compiled an im
pressive record on the American Ju
nior Golf Association circuit. Playing
week in and week out during the
summer, he steadily improved his
game, finding success at the high
school level as well.
When Gentry arrived at the
Farm, however, he saw that he still
had much to learn. The life of a col
lege athlete presented him with new
challenges and opportunities.
"The availability of practice facil
ities is much better [in college]. The
range is there, and you c an practice
into the night with the lights on."
Gentry and the rest of the team
will put their practice to the test at
home this weekend as they host the
U.S. Intercollegiate at the Stanford
Golf Course on Saturday and Sun
day. The event will feature 36 holes
on Saturday, beginning with an 8
a.m. shotgun start. Play will con
clude with 18 holes on Sunday.
Despite the many advantages of
the Stanford program, Gentiy still
lias yet to master the life of a stu
dent-athlete.
"It's tough balancing school with
your social life and with golf as well.
It definitely took me a couple quar
ters to figure out how to manage all
of that."
While he was learning the ropes,
he was also preparing his game fora
new level of competition. Gentry
spent much of the winter overhaul
ing his swing, a difficult process that
brought with it much frustration as
lie tried to eliminate every imper
fection.

However, the arduous winter
stalled to pay dividends lor both
Gentry and the Stanford program
last weekend, as the freshman
l(X)ked sharp at the ASU Thunder
bird Invitational in Tempe, Ariz.
Gentry tied for 24th place indi
vidually, just three strokes behind
senior Jim Seki's team-leading 207.
It was the only top-25 finish fora
Stanford underclassman this year
and a sign that Gentry's hard work
in the offseason may be starting to
bear fruit.
After last weekend's clash with
some of college golfs titans, the Car
dinal should find this Held at the
Farm a bit less intimidating.
Nonetheless, there will certainly be
some talented squads vying for the
title.
Despite recording its worst finish
of the year (last among 19 teams) in
Tempe, UCLA still remains No. 11
in the country according to
Golfweek magazine. Look for the
Bruins to bounce back this weekend
at an event where they finished
third a year ago.
Making a rare appearance on the
West Coast, No. 8 Oklahoma State
will also look to capture top team
honors. The Cowboys have won
three tournaments this spring and
are looking forward to another run
at the Big 12 Conference Champi
onship.
In the individual competition
one name stands above the rest.
Hunter Mahan, the all-world junior
from Oklahoma State returns to col
lege competition this weekend after
placing 28th at the Masters.
Mahan's 6-over-par total tied
him with PGA Tour stars like Fred
Couples and Sergio Garcia.
For the Cardinal, this tourna
ment should bring back pleasant
memories from a year ago. The
team played well on its home
course, carding a 6-over-par 858 for
three rounds.

Stanford finished in second
place, 10 shots behind Southern
California. Phillip Rovve, the since
departed Stanford senior, won the
event with an 8-under-par total of
205.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, se
nior standout Jim Seki plans to play
the weekend, despite his continuing
hack problems.
"It's senior year and the team
needs me â€” I'll be there for them,"
Seki said. "We have to have a good
performance this week and at con

ference to set tire our spot in region
al. Basically, whatever it takes."
Seki is coming off a gritty perfor
mance in Tempe where he fought
his way to a seventh-place finish, de
spite having pushed his back
through six rounds of competition
during the week.
The U.S. Intercollegiate is the
team's last regular-season tour
nament and the final tune-up be
fore Pacifc-10 Conference Cham
pionships begin April 28 in Los
Angeles.
