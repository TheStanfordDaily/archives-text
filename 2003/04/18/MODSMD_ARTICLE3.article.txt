### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University's announcement that it will ban alco
hol at gatherings in all-freshman residences next year has
met with widespread student and faculty concern, espe
cially from dormitory staff and resident fellows.
Students who are in the midst of applying to resident
assistant positions had many of their fears assuaged in a
meeting on Tuesday with Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, who assured them that the new pol
icy will not require RAs to take on the role of enforcers.
Yet current dorm staff members continue to worry about
potential negative side effects, and many were dismayed
by the lack of student and faculty input in die decision
making process.
Junior Kate Pedatella, an RAin Rinconada, said the
new policy contributed to her decision not to reapply for
the position.
"One of the staples of being an RA here is that you're
never put in the position of being a police officer," Pe
datella said. "That's a huge reason why people are inter
ested in doing the job ... There were definitely other fac
tors that went into my decision not to be an RAin Rinc
again, but the new alcohol policy was definitely not an in
centive to take on a cloudy responsibility with all sorts of
nebulous implications."
I n meeting with R*\ applicants, Camarillo tried to clar
ify the policy's intent.
"The RAs are expected to intervene when someone is
violating a policy, doing something risky or dangerous to
themselves or others," Camarillo told the applicants, ac
cording to applicant Frances Lewis.
"You're supposed to promote awareness and make
sure the freshmen know the policy, and then ask your
self, 'Are they being abusive of the policy?'" she added.
According to a sophomore who attended the
meeting, some applicants were left with lingering questions.
"She was kind of vague about the action an RA is sup
posed to take if they judge a situation to be dangerous,"
Lewis said. "She told us what we weren't supposed to do,
but didn't really say what we were supposed to do."
