# RAs, RFs wary of changes to alcohol policy
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University's announcement that it will ban alco
hol at gatherings in all-freshman residences next year has
met with widespread student and faculty concern, espe
cially from dormitory staff and resident fellows.
Students who are in the midst of applying to resident
assistant positions had many of their fears assuaged in a
meeting on Tuesday with Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, who assured them that the new pol
icy will not require RAs to take on the role of enforcers.
Yet current dorm staff members continue to worry about
potential negative side effects, and many were dismayed
by the lack of student and faculty input in die decision
making process.
Junior Kate Pedatella, an RAin Rinconada, said the
new policy contributed to her decision not to reapply for
the position.
"One of the staples of being an RA here is that you're
never put in the position of being a police officer," Pe
datella said. "That's a huge reason why people are inter
ested in doing the job ... There were definitely other fac
tors that went into my decision not to be an RAin Rinc
again, but the new alcohol policy was definitely not an in
centive to take on a cloudy responsibility with all sorts of
nebulous implications."
I n meeting with R*\ applicants, Camarillo tried to clar
ify the policy's intent.
"The RAs are expected to intervene when someone is
violating a policy, doing something risky or dangerous to
themselves or others," Camarillo told the applicants, ac
cording to applicant Frances Lewis.
"You're supposed to promote awareness and make
sure the freshmen know the policy, and then ask your
self, 'Are they being abusive of the policy?'" she added.
According to a sophomore who attended the
meeting, some applicants were left with lingering questions.
"She was kind of vague about the action an RA is sup
posed to take if they judge a situation to be dangerous,"
Lewis said. "She told us what we weren't supposed to do,
but didn't really say what we were supposed to do."
She added, "I think most people
aren't happy with the policy, but
they understand its intent, and they
understand that if it's implemented
in the right way it won't necessarily
change anything ... I'm not consid
ering dropping my application, and
honestly I think most people aren't."
With the second round of RA in
terviews underway, few expect that
the new policy will substantially af
fect the application process this year.
But junior Chuck Armstrong, an RA
in Paloma, believes he is among a
majority of current RAs who feel that
the policy has the potential to create
serious problems in the long term.
"I don't think it's possible to have
a drastic change in policy and have
the role of the RA not change," he
said.
Armstrong foresees parties mov

ing behind closed doors, forcing RAs
to decide whether to ignore the be
havior or intervene and risk being
perceived as "alcohol police."
"The change in regulation does
introduce the role of enforcement
into the RA/resident [relation
ship]," agreed Larkin Resident Fel
low Stephen Stedman. "That's cer
tainly a concern."
But Stedman said he was more
worried that the new policy could re
sult in unsafe drinking practices.
"In the six years we've been
here, most [emergency room] calls
where people are getting sick from
drinking, it's not because of a
party," Stedman said. "It's because
they're tip in their room taking
shots with three friends ... Why
they would have a policy that would
encourage that, I have no idea,
other than that they're worried
about liability."
Camarillo said yesterday that she
didn't think freshmen would neces
sarily drink more in private in re

sponse to the new policy.
"If a student is making the deci
sion to go behind closed doors be
cause the University refuses to allow
serv ice of alcohol, that is a personal
decision, not one brought on by a
policy thai simply states: 'No alco
holic beverages may be served at all
freshman house events in common
area spaces (e.g. lounges, hallways,
patios / outdoor areas),' " she said.
Camarillo also noted that the role
of the RA has always been to inter
vene in unsafe situations.
"The current expectation for the
RA position is that the residential
staff must be prepared to intervene
and act assertively if any student is,
through their actions or behavior,
being disrespectful and violating the
rights of their fellow students or
housemates," she explained.
She added, "Respecting the poli
cies deemed necessary by the Uni
versity must also be part of those
ground rules."
While students and faculty re

main divided on the degree to which
negative side effects can be expected,
nearly all felt blindsided by the deci
sion. Neither the student members
of the Alcohol Advisory Board nor
the resident fellows as a group were
consulted in the decision-making
process.
"Unfortunately, there are ac
tions that the University must take,
particularly as it relates to the law,
that cannot be a topic for consulta
tion," Camarillo said. "However,
how that policy is implemented and
how the negative impact can be
proactively addressed and amelio
rated will continue to be the focus of
discussion [with students and facul
ty groups]."
Armstrong had a different view.
"This current administration is ..
. not listening to the students here,"
he said. "I would be very surprised if
you found one student that support
ed this policy. It's just regulation that
is unnecessary and really creates an
unsafe environment."

patios / outdoor areas),' " she said.
Camarillo also noted that the role
of the RA has always been to inter
vene in unsafe situations.
"The current expectation for the
RA position is that the residential
staff must be prepared to intervene
and act assertively if any student is,
through their actions or behavior,
being disrespectful and violating the
rights of their fellow students or
housemates," she explained.
She added, "Respecting the poli
cies deemed necessary by the Uni
versity must also be part of those
ground rules."
While students and faculty re

main divided on the degree to which
negative side effects can be expected,
nearly all felt blindsided by the deci
sion. Neither the student members
of the Alcohol Advisory Board nor
the resident fellows as a group were
consulted in the decision-making
process.
"Unfortunately, there are ac
tions that the University must take,
particularly as it relates to the law,
that cannot be a topic for consulta
tion," Camarillo said. "However,
how that policy is implemented and
how the negative impact can be
proactively addressed and amelio
rated will continue to be the focus of
discussion [with students and facul
ty groups]."
Armstrong had a different view.
"This current administration is ..
. not listening to the students here,"
he said. "I would be very surprised if
you found one student that support
ed this policy. It's just regulation that
is unnecessary and really creates an
unsafe environment."
The University's announcement that it will ban alco
hol at gatherings in all-freshman residences next year has
met with widespread student and faculty concern, espe
cially from dormitory staff and resident fellows.
Students who are in the midst of applying to resident
assistant positions had many of their fears assuaged in a
meeting on Tuesday with Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, who assured them that the new pol
icy will not require RAs to take on the role of enforcers.
Yet current dorm staff members continue to worry about
potential negative side effects, and many were dismayed
by the lack of student and faculty input in die decision
making process.
Junior Kate Pedatella, an RAin Rinconada, said the
new policy contributed to her decision not to reapply for
the position.
"One of the staples of being an RA here is that you're
never put in the position of being a police officer," Pe
datella said. "That's a huge reason why people are inter
ested in doing the job ... There were definitely other fac
tors that went into my decision not to be an RAin Rinc
again, but the new alcohol policy was definitely not an in
centive to take on a cloudy responsibility with all sorts of
nebulous implications."
I n meeting with R*\ applicants, Camarillo tried to clar
ify the policy's intent.
"The RAs are expected to intervene when someone is
violating a policy, doing something risky or dangerous to
themselves or others," Camarillo told the applicants, ac
cording to applicant Frances Lewis.
"You're supposed to promote awareness and make
sure the freshmen know the policy, and then ask your
self, 'Are they being abusive of the policy?'" she added.
According to a sophomore who attended the
meeting, some applicants were left with lingering questions.
"She was kind of vague about the action an RA is sup
posed to take if they judge a situation to be dangerous,"
Lewis said. "She told us what we weren't supposed to do,
but didn't really say what we were supposed to do."
She added, "I think most people
aren't happy with the policy, but
they understand its intent, and they
understand that if it's implemented
in the right way it won't necessarily
change anything ... I'm not consid
ering dropping my application, and
honestly I think most people aren't."
With the second round of RA in
terviews underway, few expect that
the new policy will substantially af
fect the application process this year.
But junior Chuck Armstrong, an RA
in Paloma, believes he is among a
majority of current RAs who feel that
the policy has the potential to create
serious problems in the long term.
"I don't think it's possible to have
a drastic change in policy and have
the role of the RA not change," he
said.
Armstrong foresees parties mov

ing behind closed doors, forcing RAs
to decide whether to ignore the be
havior or intervene and risk being
perceived as "alcohol police."
"The change in regulation does
introduce the role of enforcement
into the RA/resident [relation
ship]," agreed Larkin Resident Fel
low Stephen Stedman. "That's cer
tainly a concern."
But Stedman said he was more
worried that the new policy could re
sult in unsafe drinking practices.
"In the six years we've been
here, most [emergency room] calls
where people are getting sick from
drinking, it's not because of a
party," Stedman said. "It's because
they're tip in their room taking
shots with three friends ... Why
they would have a policy that would
encourage that, I have no idea,
other than that they're worried
about liability."
Camarillo said yesterday that she
didn't think freshmen would neces
sarily drink more in private in re

sponse to the new policy.
"If a student is making the deci
sion to go behind closed doors be
cause the University refuses to allow
serv ice of alcohol, that is a personal
decision, not one brought on by a
policy thai simply states: 'No alco
holic beverages may be served at all
freshman house events in common
area spaces (e.g. lounges, hallways,
patios / outdoor areas),' " she said.
Camarillo also noted that the role
of the RA has always been to inter
vene in unsafe situations.
"The current expectation for the
RA position is that the residential
staff must be prepared to intervene
and act assertively if any student is,
through their actions or behavior,

housemates," she explained.
