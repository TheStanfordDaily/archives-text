# Students prepare to celebrate Africa Week
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From "Akili," a Tanzanian play, to Culture
Night, an ensemble of art, theater and dance,
the Stanford campus will be immersed in
African themes starting this Sunday.
Africa Week, taking place from April 20 to
April 26, is a collaborative effort to expose the
Stanford community to African heritage. The
week presents an eclectic mix of activities de
signed to promote cultural understanding
while entertaining students.
"I'm really excited for the upcoming week,"
says freshman Ratul Narain. "Though I've
seen a lot of cultural events on Stanford's cam
pus, this will be my first look at African culture.
And it's also a chance to learn not just about a
race, but an entire continent's traditions."
This annual event is run by the Stanford
African Students Association and solicits help

from students, faculty and staff. Africa Week is
unique to Stanford, though other institutions
have comparable events designed to educate
the community.
Every year, Stanford's Africa Week presents
a unique message.
"My Africa," this year's theme, will celebrate
the variety in African culture. While seeking to
gain a sense of African pride, the leaders want
to avoid homogenizing a diverse culture.
Past themes include "Celebrating African
Women: the Backbone of a Continent" and
"Africa on the Move."
Abosede George, a graduate student in his
tory and president of the Stanford African Stu
dents Association, enthusiastically urged stu
dents to come and learn more about Africa
through a wide mix of activities.
"We use the event as an opportunity to
communicate something about Africa that we
feel the larger community could benefit from,"

George said. "We encourage all African peo
ple, people of African descent and all people
who are interested in Africa to participate as
much as they can. That pretty much means
everybody."
The events are largely free of charge and
all are open to the public. Africa Week
promises both entertainment and an oppor
tunity to learn about Africa, organizers say.
The array of activities includes a soccer tour
nament, an African market with jewelry and
art and a film screening of "Karmen Gei." On
the more educational side, there is a sched
uled keynote speaker, a panel from the Grad
uate School of Business and a roundtable dis
cussion on the topic of oil exploration in
Africa.
Africa Week will once again host a mix of ed
ucators and students to revel in Africa's cultural
traditions. The week will conclude with a semi
formal dance event.
