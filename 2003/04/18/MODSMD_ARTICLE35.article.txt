# How students feel about financial aid
## Talkin' money 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
For many students, choosing
Stanford University over odier top
schools has little to do with California
weather, small classes and good fac
ulty-student relationships. Higher
on the priority list is the financial aid
package — will parents be able to
foot the bill? Will students graduate
with exorbitant loans to pay back?
While some undergraduates
think they have received fair
awards, others complain that it's
hard to meet tuition costs without
their families significantly compro
mising their lifestyles.
Freshman .Angela Steele is happy
with her financial aid package.
"My Stanford acceptance letter
was the last one I received and the
majority of the financial aid pack
ages I had already reviewed were
very good," Steele said. "Al
though Stanford was always my
first choice, I knew that, in the
end, if I didn't receive a good fi
nancial aid package, I wouldn't
be able to attend."
Meeting tuition costs has not
been too much of a burden on her
family.
"My expected family contribu
tion is perfect for my mother, who
is supporting two college students
right now, and I have been able to
pay my contribution through an
on-campus job."
Sophomore Elba Garcia hasn't
found meeting financial aid re
quirements too demanding or
time-consuming either.
"Dealing with the Financial Aid
Office has been a great experience,"
Garcia said. "I don't feel that they're
making unreasonable demands."
Garcia turned down a school
that was going to give her a full
scholarship, but says she has no re
grets.
"All of the extra work has been
worth it," she said. "There are a va
riety of loans, scholarships and
work study programs, and I don't
have to worry about graduating
with a big loan to pay off."
Garcia, who worked for Fresh
man and .Sophomore IVogramsand

is now assisting a professor in the An
thropological Sciences Department,
praised the work program.
"Work has been a good experi
ence," Garcia said. "I work about
five hours a week — it's just like
taking an extra two- or three-unit
course. Having a job has made me
more aware of what it costs to come
to college."
One freshman's father disagreed.
"I don't like the work compo
nent," he said. "It could potentially
take time away from other impor
tant activities and create a divide be
tween the haves and the have-nots."
Sophomore Piotr Kosicki has
found much to criticize..
"Financial aid is under-staffed and
under-funded," Kosicki said. "You
have to wonder how people get dis
bursement of scholarships at all."
"There are so many confounding
variables in the way that financial aid
works," Kosicki continued. "In most
cases, it hurts you to accumulate a lot
of outside scholarships. The Finan
cial Aid Office considers it a way of
giving back to the University."
Kosicki feels that Stanford is de
manding more of his parents than
they can reasonably pay.
"Every quarter it's the same —
my father looks at the bank state
ment and the University bill and
can't get over the shock," Kosicki
said. "I know tuition is still the thing
my dad worries about most."
To ease the financial burden on
his parents, Kosicki pays for his ex
penditures at school.
"All of the money I use to cover
expenses came from tutoring and
my summer job," he said. "Some
times my dad asks me to help out
with tuition and I throw in money
from my own account. My parents
don't take vacations any more. I
feel that it's entirely Stanford's
fault."
According to the Financial Aid
Office's Web site, the University is
"committed to need-blind admis
sion for U.S. citizens and permanent
residents of the U.S." and "makes
every effort to meet the full comput
ed need of all admitted students."
