# Politics may set tone for ASSU Senate
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a campus characterized by in
tense academic rigor and a geographic
location for which the nickname "The
Farm" is well-suited, it is not surprising
that Stanford students are reputed to
show little political fervor.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
the primary representative body of stu
dents, embodied this image when it
ruled just over a decade ago that it
would not take positions on national or
international political matters. Yet in
the past year, issues like a controversial
war in Iraq, the amplified debate over
affirmative action and workers' rights
have succeeded in pulling students'
heads out of their books — and may
challenge the nonpartisan nature of the
Senate.
A break with tradition
Protests, politicized speeches and
demonstrations of all kinds have been
abundant this year. It is in this state of
raised political consciousness that the
2003-2004 ASSU officials were elected.
With the number of political issues
affecting the Stanford community, the
newly elected ASSU Undergraduate
Senate members may find their political
backgrounds becoming a factor in an
organization that typically addresses
nonpartisan issues.
Though the majority of the new sen

ators hold moderately left-wing political
views, there are senators affiliated with
both the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford College Republicans. Politics,
though, are rarely mentioned on ASSU
candidates' platforms.
"I see no reason why my political back
ground will affect my work in ASSU," said
Senator Alyssa Schwartz, a freshman who
describes herself as a left-leaning Democ
rat. "As far as I'm concerned, [a senator's
politic al stance] doesn't matter. We were
elected to serve the needs of the students,
not to engage in politic al activities."

' Primarily nonpartisan' work
The cost of living for students,
communication between the ad
ministration and students and allo
cation of student space are a few of
the concerns that senators hope to
address this year.
"'I "he work of the ASSU is primar
ily nonpartisan," said Senator George
Hill, a freshman. "We will try not to
have political views influence that."
This past February, however, the
Senate was compelled to address
the issue of affirmative action. It
passed a resolution supporting Uni
versity President John Hennessy's
declaration for affirmative action.
In accordance with the ASSU
Constitution, only the legislative
bodies are allowed to vote to en
dorse a political idea, but even then,
the issues must only be addressed
"as they uniquely affect Stanford
students," said sophomore Joey
Natoli, the newly-elected ASSU vice
president. "We could not endorse
affirmative action in general, but we

could endorse Stanford's affirma
tive action policies."
As with affirmative action, the
continuing debates over the rights
of laborers and U.S. involvement
in Iraq have integrated national
and local political issues into the
everyday life of students.
Last week at the second annual
Community Day, several hundred
Stanford community members
participated in a march sponsored
in part by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition for issues like higher
wages and increased benefits for
workers.
In the coming months, the con
tracts of two of the labor unions rep
resented at the march, SEIU Local
715 and Local 1877, will be up for
negotiation. The terms of the con
tract will not be decided by the
ASSU,but"wecan make a statement
that will be in favor of the contract
and that will help it — that would be
more of our role," Hill said.
How political should student
governments be?
Addressing politicized issues, to
some students, oversteps the duties
of the ASSU.

"I think with the affirmative ac
tion thing, if you had had a few
more people with conservative
views [on the Senate] you would've
seen them say, This isn't under
our jurisdiction, ours to make a de
cision on,' " said senior Travis
Menk, co-president of the Stanford
College Republicans. "That's not a
statement for or against affirmative
action, it's just saying that it isn't the
job of the Senate to make a political
statement."
So, do students determine
whom to vote for based on politics?
"I don't feel like the most im
portant ASSU decisions are tied to
politics," said sophomore Doug
Wilson. "Actually, I know one per
son I voted for is from a different
political party [than I am]."
The general irrelevance of par
tisanship that has characterized the
ASSU is not consistent with most
other student governments.
The Associated Students of the
University of California at Berke
ley includes an Office of External
Affairs. The office lobbies at local,
state and federal levels to raise
awareness of student issues.
"At Berkeley, I think the Sen

ate has had problems in the past
because people were very, very
liberal," Natoli said. "Here, peo
ple tend not to run on political
platforms. We don't discourage
sharing one's voice, we just pro
mote coming to a consensus and
working together on issues that
affect everyone."
For both the Senate and the ex
ecutive branch, that means focus
ing on nonpartisan issues.
"I expect that all of us senators
will be able to put aside any polit
ical differences and focus on get
ting things done and making a
change in the University,"
Schwartz said.
Whether the Senate will address
political issues remains to be seen.
"On a case-by-case basis, we assess
whether it's the Senate's place to
make a statement," I lill said. "But if
issues do concern the student l>ody,
we'll address them any way possible."
The decision to address political
issues will l>e affected by whether or
not the current political verve per
sists among the student body.
Wilson said, "All that I really
care about is getting a DDR ma
chine in Tresidder."

Though the majority of the new sen

ators hold moderately left-wing political
views, there are senators affiliated with
both the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford College Republicans. Politics,
though, are rarely mentioned on ASSU
candidates' platforms.
"I see no reason why my political back
ground will affect my work in ASSU," said
Senator Alyssa Schwartz, a freshman who
describes herself as a left-leaning Democ
rat. "As far as I'm concerned, [a senator's
politic al stance] doesn't matter. We were
elected to serve the needs of the students,
not to engage in politic al activities."

' Primarily nonpartisan' work
The cost of living for students,
communication between the ad
ministration and students and allo
cation of student space are a few of
the concerns that senators hope to
address this year.
"'I "he work of the ASSU is primar
ily nonpartisan," said Senator George
Hill, a freshman. "We will try not to
have political views influence that."
This past February, however, the
Senate was compelled to address
the issue of affirmative action. It
passed a resolution supporting Uni
versity President John Hennessy's
declaration for affirmative action.
In accordance with the ASSU
Constitution, only the legislative
bodies are allowed to vote to en
dorse a political idea, but even then,
the issues must only be addressed
"as they uniquely affect Stanford
students," said sophomore Joey
Natoli, the newly-elected ASSU vice
president. "We could not endorse
affirmative action in general, but we

could endorse Stanford's affirma
tive action policies."
As with affirmative action, the
continuing debates over the rights
of laborers and U.S. involvement
in Iraq have integrated national
and local political issues into the
everyday life of students.
Last week at the second annual
Community Day, several hundred
Stanford community members
participated in a march sponsored
in part by the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition for issues like higher
wages and increased benefits for
workers.
In the coming months, the con
tracts of two of the labor unions rep
resented at the march, SEIU Local
715 and Local 1877, will be up for
negotiation. The terms of the con
tract will not be decided by the
ASSU,but"wecan make a statement
that will be in favor of the contract
and that will help it — that would be
more of our role," Hill said.
How political should student
governments be?
Addressing politicized issues, to
some students, oversteps the duties
of the ASSU.

"I think with the affirmative ac
tion thing, if you had had a few
more people with conservative
views [on the Senate] you would've
seen them say, This isn't under
our jurisdiction, ours to make a de
cision on,' " said senior Travis
Menk, co-president of the Stanford
College Republicans. "That's not a
statement for or against affirmative
action, it's just saying that it isn't the
job of the Senate to make a political
statement."
So, do students determine
whom to vote for based on politics?
"I don't feel like the most im
portant ASSU decisions are tied to
politics," said sophomore Doug
Wilson. "Actually, I know one per
son I voted for is from a different
political party [than I am]."
The general irrelevance of par
tisanship that has characterized the
ASSU is not consistent with most
other student governments.
The Associated Students of the
University of California at Berke
ley includes an Office of External
Affairs. The office lobbies at local,
state and federal levels to raise
awareness of student issues.
"At Berkeley, I think the Sen

ate has had problems in the past
because people were very, very
liberal," Natoli said. "Here, peo
ple tend not to run on political
platforms. We don't discourage
sharing one's voice, we just pro
mote coming to a consensus and
working together on issues that
affect everyone."
For both the Senate and the ex
ecutive branch, that means focus
ing on nonpartisan issues.
"I expect that all of us senators
will be able to put aside any polit
ical differences and focus on get
ting things done and making a
change in the University,"
Schwartz said.
Whether the Senate will address
political issues remains to be seen.
"On a case-by-case basis, we assess
whether it's the Senate's place to
make a statement," I lill said. "But if
issues do concern the student l>ody,
we'll address them any way possible."
The decision to address political
issues will l>e affected by whether or
not the current political verve per
sists among the student body.
Wilson said, "All that I really
care about is getting a DDR ma
chine in Tresidder."
On a campus characterized by in
tense academic rigor and a geographic
location for which the nickname "The
Farm" is well-suited, it is not surprising
that Stanford students are reputed to
show little political fervor.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
the primary representative body of stu
dents, embodied this image when it
ruled just over a decade ago that it
would not take positions on national or
international political matters. Yet in
the past year, issues like a controversial
war in Iraq, the amplified debate over
affirmative action and workers' rights
have succeeded in pulling students'
heads out of their books — and may
challenge the nonpartisan nature of the
Senate.
A break with tradition
Protests, politicized speeches and
demonstrations of all kinds have been
abundant this year. It is in this state of
raised political consciousness that the
2003-2004 ASSU officials were elected.
With the number of political issues
affecting the Stanford community, the
newly elected ASSU Undergraduate
Senate members may find their political
backgrounds becoming a factor in an
organization that typically addresses
nonpartisan issues.

ators hold moderately left-wing political
