# Politics may set tone for ASSU Senate
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a campus characterized by in
tense academic rigor and a geographic
location for which the nickname "The
Farm" is well-suited, it is not surprising
that Stanford students are reputed to
show little political fervor.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
the primary representative body of stu
dents, embodied this image when it
ruled just over a decade ago that it
would not take positions on national or
international political matters. Yet in
the past year, issues like a controversial
war in Iraq, the amplified debate over
affirmative action and workers' rights
have succeeded in pulling students'
heads out of their books â€” and may
challenge the nonpartisan nature of the
Senate.
A break with tradition
Protests, politicized speeches and
demonstrations of all kinds have been
abundant this year. It is in this state of
raised political consciousness that the
2003-2004 ASSU officials were elected.
With the number of political issues
affecting the Stanford community, the
newly elected ASSU Undergraduate
Senate members may find their political
backgrounds becoming a factor in an
organization that typically addresses
nonpartisan issues.
Though the majority of the new sen

ators hold moderately left-wing political
views, there are senators affiliated with
both the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford College Republicans. Politics,
though, are rarely mentioned on ASSU
candidates' platforms.
"I see no reason why my political back
ground will affect my work in ASSU," said
Senator Alyssa Schwartz, a freshman who
describes herself as a left-leaning Democ
rat. "As far as I'm concerned, [a senator's
politic al stance] doesn't matter. We were
elected to serve the needs of the students,
not to engage in politic al activities."
