# Dig in — 'Holes' is a delight
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
I watch the Disney Channel, and I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm fa
miliar with shows like "Lizzie McGuire," "Even Stevens" and reruns of
"Sister, Sister." My 9-year-old sister has dragged me to the couch, beat
me down and made me watch them with her until I've honestly become
inclined to turn the channel on myself, even when my little sis isn't

around. Why? 1 must admit that these sitcoms, which are
made fora young and imposable audience, have not justC
a moral statement, but also such a strong character ap
peal and entertainment value that I am often thoroughly
engrossed in the plot within the first 10 minutes. 1 carry
the same sentiment for the movie "Holes," which was also
made by Disney.
"Holes" is based on the children's novel by Louis
Sacliar. My reservations were of course rightly intact as I
had huge expectations for another cheesy Disney film sat-

urated with a large helping of cuteness. What I got instead, was a movie
that is an exact copy of the book — nothing is left out and nothing
added in. It was incredibly refreshing to watch a movie that is so origi
nal and watchable. And it is even more commendable to see children's
books (like the "Harry Potter" series and "Holes") being put to screen
in such stellar renditions.
Main character Stanley Yelnats, who is played by "Even Stevens'"
Shia La Beouf, is sent to an all-boys detention camp, Camp Green
lake, fora crime he didn't commit. Once he reaches the camp, he is
met by a swarm of belligerent boys with names like "Armpit,"
"ZigZag," "X-Ray" and "Zero." In order to build character, the boys
must dig a five-by-five foot hole each day. Camp Greenlake is, iron
ically, covered with dirt, and there are holes that spawn acres of land.
There is a sense of a more important reason why these holes are

being dug, and so begins the mystery of the movie.
I hroughout "Holes," Stanley blames his luck on the richly twist
ed (and humorous) Yelnats Family Curse. The movie then plays off

of the entanglement of the histories

that come about through
this family curse, giving the

audience large doses of minor

(yet important) characters.
The flashbacks eventually
piece together the entire
puzzle and clear the dust
behind the mystery of the
holes.
It was also priceless to
see such serious actors like

Sigourney Weaver (the vicious Warden)
and Jon Voight (Mr. Sir), let down their
guards and play goofy, invigorating
characters. Guest appearances by Los
Angeles Lakers player Rick Fox (Clyde
"Sweet Feet" Livingston) and Patricia Ar
quette (Kissin' Kate Barlow) are also
greatly entertaining for the older crowd
in the audience.
Most of you are thinking that a chil
dren's movie would be the last thing

you'd see on a Saturday night. Children's film or not, "Holes" is no
doubt, the best movie in the theaters right now . .. even if parental
guidance is suggested.



When you wake up to this on a Sunday morning, you know you had a
rough night.
