# 'The Good Thief' falls short of greatness
## 
### JOANNA PETRONE 
Early on in"The Good Thief,"
Bob Montagnet, a middle-aged
down-on-his-luck high roller and
heroin addict, beats up a sleazy
pimp harassing a pretty and
skimpily clad young woman. The
sequence takes place in a dark al
leyway. The lighting is luridly
blue, the camera angles jagged
and the cuts quick and sharp.
Punches are thrown, heels click
as long, slim legs flicker away,
and facial features receive adjust
ing courtesy of the glittering
pavement. As Bob walks off, hav
ing sent the pimp packing, the
young women calls after him,
"Hey, I don't need a guardian!"
Now imagine the same scene,
but take away the dark alleyway
and replace it with a well-lit cafe.
Get rid of the heroin addiction.
Dress the youug woman in a
turtleneck sweater and long
trench coat. Remove the fight
completely, and replace it with a
couple lines of dialogue. Have
the actors speak in French and
shoot the scene in long, still
frames in ascetic black and white.
The pimp tips his hat and leaves
the cafe and the young women
swivels her diner stool to face
Bob. "Je n'ai pas besoin d'un gar
dien," she says.
Neil Jordan's new movie is a
remake of the 1955 Jean-Pierre
Melville proto-Nouvelle Vague
classic, "Bob le Flatnbeur" about

an aging gambler risking his luck
on one last, risky stunt —a casino
heist in Monte (larlo on the night
of the Grand Prix. The changes
Jordan makes to both plot and
production are not, after all, so
surprising. "The Good Thief'
looks like the glossy, high-budget
studio flick it is. This is not neces
sarily a bad thing.
In addition to the colors,
drugs and bare limbs, Jordan
adds some heavy-handed dia
logue. which is saved purely by

the generous treatment they re
ceive from Nolle and a more up
beat ending. "The Good Thief' is
a movie of moments, many of
which are remarkable and re
markably funny, though conti
nuity and cohesion must be ap
preciated through sustainment
of mood rather than through the
working out of the narrative. It is
always a fine balance in a film like
this between redundant ortho
doxy and novelty for novelty's
sake. Jordan sometimes makes it

work, but sometimes he doesn't
The soundtrack is perfect

and its capstone is the
gritty sweet song "A r
Thousand
Deep" by Leonard
Cohen. His jazzy,
freewheeling cam
era movements are
often quite beautiful

feeling of beauty and resigna
tion, though at times they seem
more like annoying mannerisms
than effective devices. And may

annoying accents.
Bob's newly bestowed heroin
addiction is well done, but Jor
dan's gross favoring of Bob as
junkie over Bob as gambler
makes the ending, which is really
quite simple, nearly incompre
hensible. Likewise the host of
minor characters, many of whom
are clever and endearing — the
transsexual bodybuilder Phillip;!
is one such nice touch — but fail
to advance the plot and even pos
itively obscure it.
flie movie is worth seeing tor
Nick Nolte's performance alone.
As the pathetic yet endearing
cynic, he is hilarious and
poignant and his thick, irregular
face dominates the screen like a
black hole dominates space. He

is washed-up and
witty, unredeemed
but trying, and Nolte
es as good a show as
does that who he
most resembles —
Elliot Gould, playing
Phillip Marlowe in
Alt man's 1973 ver
sion of "The Long
Goodbye." Nutsa
Kukhianidze, the

Georgian actress who plays the
impish street waif gives a some
what wobbly performance that
works because it complements
the naif that she plays. I expect
we will be seeing more of this ac
tress soon.
To Jordan's great credit, he
has made a film that is neither a
watered-down remake nor a
pretentious upstaging hut an
unpretentious film that tries to
honor the filmmaker who in
spired it.
Besides Nolte's performance,
the rich atmosphere of the film
is captivating and intricate and
is in itself worthy of seeing; few
other directors know how to
make a single unnameable feel
ing the star of the show. (Alt
man, again, comes most strong
ly to mind.) The movie is not a
masterpiece, yet it contains
within it a number of sparkling
gems, and like its main charac
ter, one enjoys and even loves
the movie despite its flaws and
imperfections.

masterpiece, yet it contains
within it a number of sparkling
gems, and like its main charac

the movie despite its flaws and
imperfections.
