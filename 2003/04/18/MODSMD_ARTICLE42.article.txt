# Ed Burns answers our burning questions
## 
### TRACEY NYBERG 
On a sunny afternoon in San
Francisco, Edward Burns dis
cusses the freedom of acting in
a film directed by someone else,
the increasing importance of indepen
dent films, and gives some advice to young
filmmakers. Winning the Sundance Film
Festival Grand Jury Prize in 1995 for"The
Brothers McMullen," he has become one
of the significant new filmmakers of the
past decade. In
addition to directing, Burns has acted in
such movies "Saving Private Ryan," "15

Minutes," and "Life or Something Lik
It." Despite all his success, Burns is still a
very affable, laid-back individual.
Intermission: You play a con man in
["Confidence"]. Did you do anything spe
cial to prepare for this role? Did you shad
ow a con-man?
Edward Burns: I didn't. Rachel Weisz
learned how or tried to learn how to be
come a pickpocket. She learned at least
the technique, but she never learned how
to pull it oft. I sort oflooked at the con film
genre as sort of this exaggerated or paral
lel universe that has nothing to do with re
ality. I sort of never really looked at my
character as a real guy, so, I didn't feel t he
need to sort of track or hang with any con
man in preparation. Fortunately, Dong
Jung, the screenwriter, did such a great
job, a convincing job. that I sorta felt, well,
if I just follow Doug's script
I'll play a convincing con-man.
INT: Vou started acting in your own films,
writing and directing as well. Can you
compare and contrast between working
on your own material with someone
else's?
EB: Yeah, you know, when you get the
opportunity to work with someone else's
material, a couple of different things can
happen. One, when you work with anoth
er filmmaker, it sorta frees you up to try
different things that you wouldn't neces
sarily try when you are the filmmaker.
The other thing is, I tend to have a writing
style, make a certain kind of film, sort of
smaller, character-driven, dialogue-heavy
films. The fact that I can go off — that's a
certain type of character you'll tend to
play in that. I have been given the oppor
tunity to go in "Saving Private Ryan" and
"15 Minutes," so you get to play very dif
ferent types of characters, the kind of
characters 1 never would have written for
myself, so it does free you up, it sort of
forces you to try different things.
1 think what's happened for me, since I
didn't have any formal acting training, is
I've become a better actor because of
working with those different filmmakers,
working in those different genres, but
most importantly when you get to work
with Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia,
you're going to become a better actor. You
work with DeNiro, "15 Minutes," you're
going to become a better actor.
INT: Did (director) James Foley ask for

any advice, did you give him any hints?
EB: No, again because "Private Ryan" was
the first thing I'd ever acted in that wasn't
my own stuff, I kinda knew going into that
film that 1 wasn't going to be offering
Spielberg any suggestions or anything. So
that's sorta been my approach with every
film, and the great thing is that there'd be
days on ["Confidence"] where I'd look
over at Foley and he's losing light, we
couldn't get the street closed down, one of
the actors is late, and the

second camera never
showed up, and he's

pulling his hair out

of his head
and I'm sit
ting there in
my chair with

a cup of coffee,
and the three

lines of dialogue I
have in that scene,
saying, "You know
what, I'm glad I'm not
the director today."

INT: When you're working
with other directors, what do
you look for from them in
order to be satisfied as an actor?

EB: My two favorite experiences as 1
an actor have been "Private Ryan"
and "Confidence," and the reason is
that Spielberg and Foley have a very
similar approach to working with actors,
which is they have a lot of respect for
actors and what they do, so they allow the
ensembles three or four takes to find the
scene and find t he characters without feel
ing the need to step in and give direction.
I didn't do that in my first three films,
and after watching Spielberg, he has a dif
ferent level of respect for acting, and
Foley's the same way in that they don't feel
the necessity after every take to come and
give the actor direction, because the actors
tend to know the characters more inti
mately than the filmmaker does because
that is their single focus, the filmmaker
has so many other things to worry about,
and he also has 20, 50 characters that he
has to know somewhat intimately.
I'he actor only knows, or I should say,
tends to know that character in a more in
timate way. So after working with Spiel
berg I changed my style of working with
actors, where I did what they now do
which is you give the actors room to show
you the possibilities and the different
shades of that character that maybe aren't
there on the page and maybe you didn't
see. It really is just a matter of sort of
slightly pushing them in one direction or
another, and it's not coming in and after
every line saying, "No, that line needs to
be delivered this way." That's just the ap
proach that I prefer.
INT: There are a lot of really strong actors

in "Confidence" — on the set were there
egos clashing? How did yon guys get
along?
EB: Fortunately no, t here was none ot that.
Vou know, sometimes you'll do a film, and
that one bad apple can really spoil the expe
rience for everyone else. This was one with
which, you know Andy Garcia, Dustin Hoff
man, these are big guys, there was
none of that. The tone usual-

ly stems from the top,
and when you have

Jam ie
Foley, who

has such enthusi
asm for the film male-

ing prcxess and such love
for actors, and von have Dustin

who loves movie sets, loves actors and

is so happy to be there, you have those two
guys setting the tone of the film, everyone's

having a good time. Even if there was a guv
who might be a pain in the ass, he'd show up
on that set and see everyone
having such a good time and say, "You
know what, I'll save my attitude lot
another film." So I got pretty lucky on this
film.
INT: Are you more comfortable inside or
outside of t he studio system?
EB: As a filmmaker, I'm more comfort
able outside, but I think things are chang
ing within the studio world right now. I
don't think you would call Lions Gate a
studio as much as "Confidence" isn't, let's
say, some people might not consider it an
independent film, Lions Gate isn't a stu
dio. That being said, they gave Jamie total
control, hands off, and I think the work
reflects that. You can see how a personali
ty is in this film as opposed to the studio
stamp.
But I think things are changing in the
business because if you look at this past
year, what were traditionally independent
films and you look at the studio films,
there's this gray area now where maybe
they have meshed. "Adaptation," "About
Schmidt," "Road to Perdition," "Punch
Drunk Love," "The Hours," "Far From
Heaven," you've got people like Tom

Hanks, Dennis Quaid, Adam Sandler,
Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, Nit Cage,
not people you normally associate with in
dependent films being in these sort of
more independent-minded movies, and I
think it's because those actors are seeing
something going on in the independent
film world and saying, "Hey, 1 want to be
a part of that."
But now because of their association,
"About Schmidt" gets a real budget and a
real release, whereas five years ago I don't
think you'd get Jack Nicholson in that
movie, you know maybe you get Petei
Fonda, and it gets an "Ulee's Gold" re
lease. If Peter Fonda was the guy in
"About Schmidt," "About Schmidt" would
have probably gotten a 15-screen release.

but because Jack Nicholson and other
actors are seeing all the exciting things

going on, like what Alexander Payru
did in "Election," he's probably say

ing, "Hey, that's the best movie I
saw last year. I'd rather be in ili.il
movie than blank" — not to

name any of the films that
Jack Nicholson did, so you
see that kind of thing

going on, that's exciting,
I think, for
us as moviegoers.

INT: Some critics sa\
that because of that gray area
festivals such as the Sundanct

Film Festival are becoming more com
mercialized, and that indie films are not
getting the attention they deserve. How
have you seen it change over the last eight
years?

EB: I think you have to sort of look at Sun
dance as two different film festivals, and
that was true when 1 was there in '95, a lit
tle less so, but still there were the two sep
arate festivals. The festival itself is a dra
matic and documentary competition, and
then there are the premieres and the
screenings. When I was there in '95 there
were no big celebrity-filled parties like
there are now, but that is the other side of
the festival. You know, "Confidence" can
go to Sundance and it's there for two rea
sons: It's there because there's so much
press at the festival, it's a good launching
pad for a movie like "Confidence. But
also Dustin I loffman shows up at the Sun
dance Film Festival and that's cot >1 for
young filmmakers to get to meet Dustin.
A great example of the big thing that Sun
dance is now becoming, sort of the more
commercial side, and where the indie
world meet, is the film called "Raising Vic -
tor Vargas." Dustin sees the movie at the
festival, falls in love with it, tracks down
the filmmaker, and then invites the film
maker to go around with Dustin as he
does his publicity for "Confidence." So
you get Dustin Hoffman promoting this
tiny little independent film made on the
streets of New York, and that's where, let s
say if Dustin isn't there, "Vargas" doesn t
get the couple of hits of free publicity be
cause Dustin embraced the film.
Fhe other thing that Sundance, and it
was true of it in 1989 when Soderbergh
had "sex, lies and videotape," it was true of
