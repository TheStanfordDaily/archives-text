# Burns, Hoffman & company carry 'Confidence'

### TRACEY NYBERG 
One ol the travesties of recent filmmaking is the
decline in snappy dialogue. During the '40s and
"50s movies would crackle with witty banter, often
exemplified by actors such as Gary Grant,

Spencer Tracy and katherine Hep

burn. Screenwriter Doug Jung has \
resurrected this practice in the new
film "Confidence," a caper movie
about conman Jake Vig (Edward
Burns) and his team, who have un
knowingly conned money from a
major Los Angeles crime boss, the
King (Dustin 1 foffman).
In order to pay the King back

and save their lives, the team must pull off the
biggest con in their career, enlisting the help of a
pickpocket named Lily (Rachel Weisz). As they at
tempt to engineer a corporate loan fraud, things
get complicated — particularly with the arrival of
Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia), hot
on Jake's trail and just itching to catch him red
handed.
Director James Foley takes firm control of the
audience's perspective from the very beginning,
using the camera angles and narrative timeline to
dole out information in the smallest portions. This
is essential in creating the suspense of a heist film,
for the less the audience knows or suspects, the bet
ter. The camera often focuses on the actor's eyes,
who's looking at whom and how this influences the
portrayal of these characters. The only fault is in the
final twist — without giving anything away, it is
highly predictable and very Hollywood. Still, get
ting to that point is so much fun and so well done

that this film is about the
journey and not the des
tination.
The acting in this film

is what gives the
dialogue its
sparkle, particu-

larly the perfor-

mances by Ed
ward Burns
and Dustin
1 fofiman. As an
audience mem
ber you want
the highly su
perstitious Jake

to pull off this con, even
though you know in the
back of your mind he's
not really one of the good
guys. Burns brings intel
ligence to the role, and
the audience can easily
believe that he can see "20
of chess."

Hoffman's villain, the King, is a Ritalin-popping
ADHD whirlwind of a character. Seedy and lascivi
ous, yon can never predict what the King is going
to do next and the scenes with Jake are nuance
packed meetings of two great criminal minds. The
question is, which one will win out in the end?
The supporting cast is solid, and as the group
dynamics develop it becomes more and more diffi
cult to discern who is loyal to whom and who is just
putting on an act. Superstition is an important
theme in the film, although it seems anachronistic

that such a smart character like Jake (who believes
his success is due to confidence) would see bad
omens in things like birds and redheads.
Still, the ensemble group of actors and Foley's
direction do a masterful job of fooling the audience
and their "mark" into believing what they want
them to believe. As Jake says, "you can't trick
karma," and any success this film achieves is due to
the high quality workmanship that put this film to
gether. It's a fun hour and a half that will leave you
interested and entertained.
