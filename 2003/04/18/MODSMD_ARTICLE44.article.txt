# INTERMISSION WAKES PSYCHIC FRIENDS
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN ANTHONY HA (Special thanks to Japan-bound Ryan Sands 
Intrepid Intermission journalists Anthony Ha and
Karan Mahajan have delved into the mysterious
world of psychics in the Bay Area. First, they had their
fortunes decoded by two palm-readers and card
readers, anonymous in this article. Then, they found them
selves in a fancy townhouse in Redwood City, chatting widi
Barbara Courtney Mousalam, a professional psychic thera
pist. The week after, they headed down to the Psychic Eye
Bookstore in Mountain View (located at 1128 El Camino ,
catering to a wide range of spiritual and psychic interests —
ranging from broom-stick collections and Yanni videos to
books about Buddhism and palm-reading) where they in
terviewed manager Valarie Gould, tarot-card reader Kae
Lien and clerk and male witch, Achilles Romeus Bowen.
Please keep in mind that these readers are not meant to be
representative of the psychic community as a whole.
Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the
past — this was news to me — and 1 was still struggling to gel
over it. She told me that I would have two more big relation
ships in my life, and the second person would be the woman
I'd settle down with. Good to know.
And then we turned to the cards. I was hoping that she'd
look at each individual card and tell me what it meant about
me or my future, but instead she just kind of squinted at the
pile and talked about the "energy" and "feeling" that she was
getting. We talked some more about my career, she could tell
that I wanted to be a doctor. When I pointed out that I had
never really been interested in medicine, and was instead con
sidering an urban studies major, she nodded sagely. 1 added
that what 1 really wanted to do with my life was be a writer,
and the psychic assured me that 1 would be successful. She
added that I would be taking a road trip in the next month to
clear my head for the upcoming decision.
Finally, she warned me to watch out for someone with the
initial "R," and another person with the initial "G." N

Koran's palm readings
I visited two palm-readers, both of whom declined to be in
terviewed. The first location featured gaudy furniture and
maroon carpets, in addition to a professional waiting room.
The second (visited by Anthony as well) was Spartan and busi
ness-like. Below is a bullet-point account of what my life is
going to be like / has been, narrated in the original order.

Courtney Barbara Nteusalam,
psychic therapist and clairvoyant
Intermission: What are the services you offer as a psychic,
and what does it mean to be a psychic?
Courtney Barbara Mousalam: Most of my clients come tp
me through referral, so it isn't like 1 advertise services ... Sp
why do people come? They come for probably every reaso l
imaginable. Sometimes to get more insight into areas tha
may be holding them up, or barriers, or, if they're feeling ol -
stacles.

INT: What kinds of means do you use
to achieve your insights during

your visions?
CBM: I don't use anything.
It comes to me... I've
never used anything like
cards. I've worked at
not studying things.

People have given me
Tarot decks for some
gift, and I don't
want to be influ-

enced ... So it's a
combination of
things — when I'm

talking to someone,
it can be like a flash,
it can be thought, it

can be seeing some
thing in my mindfs
eye, like you would re-

/ /
member a movie that
you saw last night or

something like that, and it

will give me a clue. So some
times I'll ask people questions.

I'm not trying to get information

from them so I can tell them some
thing, but sometimes I'll get information so

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis
appointments come .. . then they're more open to get an
other insight into it.
INT: What age was it that you felt tliat you suddenly got this
ability, or was it something that you felt you were born with?
CBM: I've thought about it so many times, and I don't know.
I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few
and far between until what 1 call die "big one" that 1 had,
which was in my latter twenties, and that just... there wasn't
any way to tuck that away. And it's like it opened a door.

INT: We were also curious whether you can serve
as a medium.

CBM: 1 guess people who are no
longer alive have come to me . .

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some
one was talking to me in

the shower, arid it was
my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing
witchcraft. I mean, we were well known in the communi
ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people
knew; one lady thought that witchcraft was terrible. She
would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never
do that. When my playmates heard about it, they threw rocks at
me until I was unconscious.
INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al
ways assumed, "Oh, that's hokey," which also had to do with putting
up a front for my friends.
Then, (I took this class with a gardenian practitioner here) and that
was like "Wow! He is for real. Cool!" And so, first of all, 1 started
coming out of the broom-closet. And around that time, a
brother of mine came here and told me about it.
It's been intriguing for me — some of my other in
terests went away — but this stayed. I went out to Liv
ingstone, Montana and 1 ended up doing some ghost
busting there... You think, "No one believes these tilings
these days," but when things are moving about your house... I tell
people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the

Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age

And it's like I'm

so when tliis dress was de

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing
witchcraft. I mean, we were well known in the communi
ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people
knew; one lady thought that witchcraft was terrible. She
would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never
do that. When my playmates heard about it, they threw rocks at
me until I was unconscious.
INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al
ways assumed, "Oh, that's hokey," which also had to do with putting
up a front for my friends.
Then, (I took this class with a gardenian practitioner here) and that
was like "Wow! He is for real. Cool!" And so, first of all, 1 started
coming out of the broom-closet. And around that time, a
brother of mine came here and told me about it.
It's been intriguing for me — some of my other in
terests went away — but this stayed. I went out to Liv
ingstone, Montana and 1 ended up doing some ghost
busting there... You think, "No one believes these tilings
these days," but when things are moving about your house... I tell
people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Intrepid Intermission journalists Anthony Ha and
Karan Mahajan have delved into the mysterious
world of psychics in the Bay Area. First, they had their
fortunes decoded by two palm-readers and card
readers, anonymous in this article. Then, they found them
selves in a fancy townhouse in Redwood City, chatting widi
Barbara Courtney Mousalam, a professional psychic thera
pist. The week after, they headed down to the Psychic Eye
Bookstore in Mountain View (located at 1128 El Camino ,
catering to a wide range of spiritual and psychic interests —
ranging from broom-stick collections and Yanni videos to
books about Buddhism and palm-reading) where they in
terviewed manager Valarie Gould, tarot-card reader Kae
Lien and clerk and male witch, Achilles Romeus Bowen.
Please keep in mind that these readers are not meant to be
representative of the psychic community as a whole.
Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the
past — this was news to me — and 1 was still struggling to gel
over it. She told me that I would have two more big relation
ships in my life, and the second person would be the woman
I'd settle down with. Good to know.
And then we turned to the cards. I was hoping that she'd
look at each individual card and tell me what it meant about
me or my future, but instead she just kind of squinted at the
pile and talked about the "energy" and "feeling" that she was
getting. We talked some more about my career, she could tell
that I wanted to be a doctor. When I pointed out that I had
never really been interested in medicine, and was instead con
sidering an urban studies major, she nodded sagely. 1 added
that what 1 really wanted to do with my life was be a writer,
and the psychic assured me that 1 would be successful. She
added that I would be taking a road trip in the next month to
clear my head for the upcoming decision.
Finally, she warned me to watch out for someone with the
initial "R," and another person with the initial "G." N

Koran's palm readings
I visited two palm-readers, both of whom declined to be in
terviewed. The first location featured gaudy furniture and
maroon carpets, in addition to a professional waiting room.
The second (visited by Anthony as well) was Spartan and busi
ness-like. Below is a bullet-point account of what my life is
going to be like / has been, narrated in the original order.

Courtney Barbara Nteusalam,
psychic therapist and clairvoyant
Intermission: What are the services you offer as a psychic,
and what does it mean to be a psychic?
Courtney Barbara Mousalam: Most of my clients come tp
me through referral, so it isn't like 1 advertise services ... Sp
why do people come? They come for probably every reaso l
imaginable. Sometimes to get more insight into areas tha
may be holding them up, or barriers, or, if they're feeling ol -
stacles.

INT: What kinds of means do you use
to achieve your insights during

your visions?
CBM: I don't use anything.
It comes to me... I've
never used anything like
cards. I've worked at
not studying things.

People have given me
Tarot decks for some
gift, and I don't
want to be influ-

enced ... So it's a
combination of
things — when I'm

talking to someone,
it can be like a flash,
it can be thought, it

can be seeing some
thing in my mindfs
eye, like you would re-

/ /
member a movie that
you saw last night or

something like that, and it

will give me a clue. So some
times I'll ask people questions.

I'm not trying to get information

from them so I can tell them some
thing, but sometimes I'll get information so

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis
appointments come .. . then they're more open to get an
other insight into it.
INT: What age was it that you felt tliat you suddenly got this
ability, or was it something that you felt you were born with?
CBM: I've thought about it so many times, and I don't know.
I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few
and far between until what 1 call die "big one" that 1 had,
which was in my latter twenties, and that just... there wasn't
any way to tuck that away. And it's like it opened a door.

INT: We were also curious whether you can serve
as a medium.

CBM: 1 guess people who are no
longer alive have come to me . .

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some
one was talking to me in

the shower, arid it was
my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing

ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people

would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never

INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al

people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the
past — this was news to me — and 1 was still struggling to gel

Finally, she warned me to watch out for someone with the
initial "R," and another person with the initial "G." N

Koran's palm readings
I visited two palm-readers, both of whom declined to be in
terviewed. The first location featured gaudy furniture and
maroon carpets, in addition to a professional waiting room.
The second (visited by Anthony as well) was Spartan and busi
ness-like. Below is a bullet-point account of what my life is

Courtney Barbara Nteusalam,
psychic therapist and clairvoyant
Intermission: What are the services you offer as a psychic,
and what does it mean to be a psychic?
Courtney Barbara Mousalam: Most of my clients come tp
me through referral, so it isn't like 1 advertise services ... Sp
why do people come? They come for probably every reaso l
imaginable. Sometimes to get more insight into areas tha
may be holding them up, or barriers, or, if they're feeling ol -
stacles.

INT: What kinds of means do you use
to achieve your insights during

your visions?
CBM: I don't use anything.
It comes to me... I've
never used anything like
cards. I've worked at
not studying things.

People have given me
Tarot decks for some
gift, and I don't
want to be influ-

enced ... So it's a
combination of
things — when I'm

talking to someone,
it can be like a flash,
it can be thought, it

can be seeing some
thing in my mindfs
eye, like you would re-

/ /
member a movie that
you saw last night or

something like that, and it

will give me a clue. So some
times I'll ask people questions.

I'm not trying to get information

from them so I can tell them some
thing, but sometimes I'll get information so

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis
appointments come .. . then they're more open to get an
other insight into it.
INT: What age was it that you felt tliat you suddenly got this
ability, or was it something that you felt you were born with?
CBM: I've thought about it so many times, and I don't know.
I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few
and far between until what 1 call die "big one" that 1 had,
which was in my latter twenties, and that just... there wasn't
any way to tuck that away. And it's like it opened a door.

INT: We were also curious whether you can serve
as a medium.

CBM: 1 guess people who are no
longer alive have come to me . .

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some
one was talking to me in

the shower, arid it was
my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing
witchcraft. I mean, we were well known in the communi
ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people
knew; one lady thought that witchcraft was terrible. She
would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never
do that. When my playmates heard about it, they threw rocks at
me until I was unconscious.
INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al
ways assumed, "Oh, that's hokey," which also had to do with putting
up a front for my friends.
Then, (I took this class with a gardenian practitioner here) and that
was like "Wow! He is for real. Cool!" And so, first of all, 1 started
coming out of the broom-closet. And around that time, a
brother of mine came here and told me about it.
It's been intriguing for me — some of my other in
terests went away — but this stayed. I went out to Liv
ingstone, Montana and 1 ended up doing some ghost
busting there... You think, "No one believes these tilings
these days," but when things are moving about your house... I tell
people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Intrepid Intermission journalists Anthony Ha and
Karan Mahajan have delved into the mysterious
world of psychics in the Bay Area. First, they had their
fortunes decoded by two palm-readers and card
readers, anonymous in this article. Then, they found them
selves in a fancy townhouse in Redwood City, chatting widi
Barbara Courtney Mousalam, a professional psychic thera
pist. The week after, they headed down to the Psychic Eye
Bookstore in Mountain View (located at 1128 El Camino ,
catering to a wide range of spiritual and psychic interests —
ranging from broom-stick collections and Yanni videos to
books about Buddhism and palm-reading) where they in
terviewed manager Valarie Gould, tarot-card reader Kae
Lien and clerk and male witch, Achilles Romeus Bowen.
Please keep in mind that these readers are not meant to be
representative of the psychic community as a whole.
Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the
past — this was news to me — and 1 was still struggling to gel
over it. She told me that I would have two more big relation
ships in my life, and the second person would be the woman
I'd settle down with. Good to know.
And then we turned to the cards. I was hoping that she'd
look at each individual card and tell me what it meant about
me or my future, but instead she just kind of squinted at the
pile and talked about the "energy" and "feeling" that she was
getting. We talked some more about my career, she could tell
that I wanted to be a doctor. When I pointed out that I had
never really been interested in medicine, and was instead con
sidering an urban studies major, she nodded sagely. 1 added
that what 1 really wanted to do with my life was be a writer,
and the psychic assured me that 1 would be successful. She
added that I would be taking a road trip in the next month to
clear my head for the upcoming decision.
Finally, she warned me to watch out for someone with the
initial "R," and another person with the initial "G." N

Koran's palm readings
I visited two palm-readers, both of whom declined to be in
terviewed. The first location featured gaudy furniture and
maroon carpets, in addition to a professional waiting room.
The second (visited by Anthony as well) was Spartan and busi
ness-like. Below is a bullet-point account of what my life is
going to be like / has been, narrated in the original order.

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis

I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some

my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the

out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Intrepid Intermission journalists Anthony Ha and
Karan Mahajan have delved into the mysterious
world of psychics in the Bay Area. First, they had their
fortunes decoded by two palm-readers and card
readers, anonymous in this article. Then, they found them
selves in a fancy townhouse in Redwood City, chatting widi
Barbara Courtney Mousalam, a professional psychic thera
pist. The week after, they headed down to the Psychic Eye
Bookstore in Mountain View (located at 1128 El Camino ,
catering to a wide range of spiritual and psychic interests —
ranging from broom-stick collections and Yanni videos to
books about Buddhism and palm-reading) where they in
terviewed manager Valarie Gould, tarot-card reader Kae
Lien and clerk and male witch, Achilles Romeus Bowen.
Please keep in mind that these readers are not meant to be
representative of the psychic community as a whole.
Anthony's Palm Reading and
Card Reading
I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn
down pack of playing cards was spread out on her desk in a
circular design, and there was a crystal ball pushed off to one
side.
"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"
she asked me.
"Right," I responded, eyeing the playing cards dubiously.
"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi
tive person. A reserved person who invests a lot in their rela
tionships. She could also tell that I was very artistic. Now I was
approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con
fused me because, well, I don't really have a love life worth
talking about. She said that a girl had broken my heart in the
past — this was news to me — and 1 was still struggling to gel
over it. She told me that I would have two more big relation
ships in my life, and the second person would be the woman
I'd settle down with. Good to know.
And then we turned to the cards. I was hoping that she'd
look at each individual card and tell me what it meant about
me or my future, but instead she just kind of squinted at the
pile and talked about the "energy" and "feeling" that she was
getting. We talked some more about my career, she could tell
that I wanted to be a doctor. When I pointed out that I had
never really been interested in medicine, and was instead con
sidering an urban studies major, she nodded sagely. 1 added
that what 1 really wanted to do with my life was be a writer,
and the psychic assured me that 1 would be successful. She
added that I would be taking a road trip in the next month to
clear my head for the upcoming decision.
Finally, she warned me to watch out for someone with the
initial "R," and another person with the initial "G." N

Koran's palm readings
I visited two palm-readers, both of whom declined to be in
terviewed. The first location featured gaudy furniture and
maroon carpets, in addition to a professional waiting room.
The second (visited by Anthony as well) was Spartan and busi
ness-like. Below is a bullet-point account of what my life is
going to be like / has been, narrated in the original order.

things are improving now. True...

© You'll travel more this year than the last.

you're doing well.
© Except fora few minor bumps you'll have a happy life. ■

Courtney Barbara Nteusalam,
psychic therapist and clairvoyant
Intermission: What are the services you offer as a psychic,
and what does it mean to be a psychic?
Courtney Barbara Mousalam: Most of my clients come tp
me through referral, so it isn't like 1 advertise services ... Sp
why do people come? They come for probably every reaso l
imaginable. Sometimes to get more insight into areas tha
may be holding them up, or barriers, or, if they're feeling ol -
stacles.

INT: What kinds of means do you use
to achieve your insights during

your visions?
CBM: I don't use anything.
It comes to me... I've
never used anything like
cards. I've worked at
not studying things.

People have given me
Tarot decks for some
gift, and I don't
want to be influ-

enced ... So it's a
combination of
things — when I'm

talking to someone,
it can be like a flash,
it can be thought, it

can be seeing some
thing in my mindfs
eye, like you would re-

/ /
member a movie that
you saw last night or

something like that, and it

will give me a clue. So some
times I'll ask people questions.

I'm not trying to get information

from them so I can tell them some
thing, but sometimes I'll get information so

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis
appointments come .. . then they're more open to get an
other insight into it.
INT: What age was it that you felt tliat you suddenly got this
ability, or was it something that you felt you were born with?
CBM: I've thought about it so many times, and I don't know.
I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few
and far between until what 1 call die "big one" that 1 had,
which was in my latter twenties, and that just... there wasn't
any way to tuck that away. And it's like it opened a door.

INT: We were also curious whether you can serve
as a medium.

CBM: 1 guess people who are no
longer alive have come to me . .

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some
one was talking to me in

the shower, arid it was
my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing
witchcraft. I mean, we were well known in the communi
ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people
knew; one lady thought that witchcraft was terrible. She
would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never
do that. When my playmates heard about it, they threw rocks at
me until I was unconscious.
INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al
ways assumed, "Oh, that's hokey," which also had to do with putting
up a front for my friends.
Then, (I took this class with a gardenian practitioner here) and that
was like "Wow! He is for real. Cool!" And so, first of all, 1 started
coming out of the broom-closet. And around that time, a
brother of mine came here and told me about it.
It's been intriguing for me — some of my other in
terests went away — but this stayed. I went out to Liv
ingstone, Montana and 1 ended up doing some ghost
busting there... You think, "No one believes these tilings
these days," but when things are moving about your house... I tell
people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■

Anthony's Palm Reading and

I took a seat in front of the psychic's desk. A rather worn

"50... you want both a card readinganda palm reading?"

"A palm reading and a Tarot reading."
Either not hearing or choosing to ignore my mention of
Tarot cards, the psychic started to shuffle her ratty deck in her
hands, then told me tocut the deck twice while thinking about
things that 1 wanted to learn.
"O cards, show me what my major will be," I thought to
myself, then proceeded to divide the cards as she had direct
ed. The psychic started to arrange the cards in a circular pat
tern similar to the one they had been in when I first arrived.
When she was done, she asked to see my right hand.
Looking over my palm, the psychic told me in a very ma
tronly — if slightly rehearsed tone — that I was a very sensi

approaching a major decision in my life, but I wasn't sure
what to decide.
"You expect everything to fall into place too quickly," she
said, " just relax and things will work out."
The psychic then started to get into my love life. This con

I'm not trying to get information

from them so I can tell them some
thing, but sometimes I'll get information so

that 1 can understand what it is that I'm seeing.
Sometimes somebody'll start talking and I'll immediately
say, you know, "What's your relationship with your father?"
I already know what it is, but I'll ask the question. And ifthw
say, "Oh, it's great," I'll say, "Maybe, maybe it would be
worth looking at that a little closer." (laughs)
INT: How old are the people who come to you?
CBM: he-birth to people in their 90s. But. the average age
group, probably the bulk of the people I would say mightbe
like in their later thirties on ... younger people are more
idealistic, they're always clear that they're not going to make
the same mistakes their parents did, and that they're in

charge, you know, and I really respect that. And when dis
appointments come .. . then they're more open to get an
other insight into it.
INT: What age was it that you felt tliat you suddenly got this
ability, or was it something that you felt you were born with?
CBM: I've thought about it so many times, and I don't know.
I've had experiences throughout my life, but they were few
and far between until what 1 call die "big one" that 1 had,
which was in my latter twenties, and that just... there wasn't
any way to tuck that away. And it's like it opened a door.

INT: We were also curious whether you can serve
as a medium.

CBM: 1 guess people who are no
longer alive have come to me . .

I was taking a shower and it
was almost as though some
one was talking to me in

the shower, arid it was
my grandmother . . .
But there was discus-

sion about my aunt.
And it's like I'm

thinking while I'm
hearing this that my
aunt is absolutely

not going to believe
this if I call her and
(tell her). So what
came to me was a cer
tain dress. Well, my

aunt and my father
grew up during the
Depression years . . .

they had very little. And
so when tliis dress was de
scribed to me, what it

looked like, what color it was,

what was on the .front of the
dress, 1 got out of the shower, and

I called my aunt. And 1 said, "I think
your mother came to see me, and she

asked if you remembered this dress." And I de
scribed the dress.. . and my aunt was just sobbing. It
was the only dress that they had been able to buy Her
when she was a little girl, and they bought it to have a
family picture taken. And she never got over how beauti
ful that dress was, because it was the only store-bought
dress that she'd ever had. And so how would I know that,
[you know? So 1 just figured that that came in a way that
ray aurit could relate to.
Since then, if people have asked me to be a liaison be
tween this world and the other, I'm not interested. II some
thing comes to me, it's fine. 1 sort of feel, it somebody has
Jived a life and died, then why pull then back here, you
know? (laughs) ■

The male witch speaks
INT: Do you conduct readings professionally?
Achilles Romeus Bowen: Not professionally ... for me it's a little bit
different... For myself it's just in the course of conversation — I'm
looking for something, someone needs an example, I'll give one to
them that for whatever reason it came to mind — and then it turns out
to lie specifically appropriate to them. And they (ask), "How'd you
know about that.'" And 1 don't know ... No, I'm not a professional
reader, but lam a witch ... witchcraft, the old religion and it's pre-
Wicca ... Outside people will call, and I'll be involved in healing, or
finding someone or solving this problem or what-have-you, commu
nicating with someone, changing the dynamics of a situation across t he
planet (laughs), so anyway, 1 use the old techniques. My teaching
began when I was seven — it's a family — my mother was involved,
her mother and father and their parents that I specifically know of. So
given that, the chances are it's gone way back.
INT: I low does it feel to be a male in female dominated field?
ARB: Oh, it bothers me ... all of witchcraft as a religion is supposed to
be very equal... there's the duality of nature and male and female
concepts, not necessarily the sex — male or female — but the light
(and) dark, happy, sad, what-have-you, neither one was good or
bad, they're just parts of life so it's all good. You find an awful lot
of old misconceptions and that only women are witches — that
is not true, never was. Men were burnt as well, men were
hung as well.
INT: When you were growing up, was this sort of thing
outlawed? Did you have to keep it a secret?
ARB: Our family was supposed to be Catholic. Some of
them weren't, but they weren't open about it.. .Any
way, my father knew my mother's beliefs. 1 Ie had his
own beliefs, but he did not believe in witchcraft. At the
same time, my father was interested in some occult be
liefs, the Rosicrucians in particular. So with this kind of
family background, between the two sides, I was
raised in witchcraft, but also in engineering and
physics. It was a unique opportunity because I would
think, "This is true, but this is also true." I would try to
understand each phenomenon in the language of the
other.
I don't find them antagonistic. Physics itself became
a little magical when it entered the quantum realm...
all (beliefsystems are) saying essentially the same thing.
I consider physics to be a belief system, 100.
Getting back to my family, much of my family did not
even know that there was this branch that was pract icing
witchcraft. I mean, we were well known in the communi
ty, very high-profile. We were supposed to be good
Catholics. We donated a lot of money to build the commu
nity's big church. There was a delicate dance. A few people
knew; one lady thought that witchcraft was terrible. She
would go around saying, "Witches eat babies!" And well, you
know, they used to say that about Christians. So no, we never
do that. When my playmates heard about it, they threw rocks at
me until I was unconscious.
INT: How did you come to work for the Psychic Eye bookstore?
ARB: It's a strange thing. 1 was originally involved in more technical
things. As for the witchcraft, we kept things quiet. 1 did not go into book
shops, 1 just did what I did on my own. When I saw bookshops, I al
ways assumed, "Oh, that's hokey," which also had to do with putting
up a front for my friends.
Then, (I took this class with a gardenian practitioner here) and that
was like "Wow! He is for real. Cool!" And so, first of all, 1 started
coming out of the broom-closet. And around that time, a
brother of mine came here and told me about it.
It's been intriguing for me — some of my other in
terests went away — but this stayed. I went out to Liv
ingstone, Montana and 1 ended up doing some ghost
busting there... You think, "No one believes these tilings
these days," but when things are moving about your house... I tell
people not to jump to conclusions, but if we can't figure anything else
out... For me it was a way to be open — this place means a lot to me.
That was seven years ago.
(Now), I'm thinking of going after my private detective license; a
friend ofmine was a bounty hunter, and well, I thought, he might need
some psychic stuff — like a shorter time to find locations. ■

Kae Lien, tar©t card reader
Intermission: How long have you been a psychic?
Kae Lien: Professionally, about seven months now.
I've been studying for over seven years.
INT: What kind of readings do you do?
KL: I use purely the tarot cards, for the most part I
don't consider myself a strong psychic ... those abili
ties 1 believe that everyone has innately, but the tarot
cards I use mainly ... mostly using intuition, empa
thy, understanding things through emotions and that
kind of connection.
INT: 1 low do tarots work?
KL: Tarot cards — it's an archetypal system. Carl
Jung and his ideas about archetypes and universal
consciousness tie very much into how it works ... the
idea that a card would determine — is this is some
thing that is affecting them from their past, right now,
or in the future.
Looking at those and discussing with the person
and getting them to acknowledge what it is about these
cards and you start understanding a person. It's a
form of counseling, honestly many readers have for
mal training as counselors, I do not. Ultimately, it is an
entertainment, it's fora person to take what they get
from it and do what they wi11... nothing is predeter
mined. It's their free will, you know if they get some
good advice out of it or they think it's junk, it's their
will to let it go.
INT. C lan you see the future using tarot cards?
KL: I can get a sense of how their path will lie accord
ing to the actions that they are taking at this moment
in time or have taken in the past... lam not a strong
reader who can say on "such and such day a tall dark
handsome man is going to come into your life." Some
of the readers I have seen do that accurately. When
people ask something like, "When am 1 going to die?"
I'm not going to tell you that, you don't really want to
know that because then you stop growing, you stop
wanting to change things, you begin feeling your life
is predetermined, and that is dangerous.
INT: Do you believe in free will? If you do, how can
you predict the future?
KL: It's the sense that if you press the gas in a car and
you're headed towards a wall, yes, you're going to hit
the wall and you're going to be extremely injured if
not killed. The question there is — you've the choice
to hit the gas or to turn the car, you have the choice to
get out of the car, and the hope is that we'll be able to
show people they have some time before such a thing
happens. Honestly, we will get people in here who are
obviously in a downward spiral, whether it's through
addiction or an abusive relationship ... where it's ob
vious and all we can tell them is they need to change,
and a lot of us will recommend something more than
us —seeing a doctor, seeing a psychological coun
selor— it's more like being a signpost.
INT: What was your profession before you took up
tarot reading?
KL: Ido have another job— I'm a retail clerk. Most
readers don't depend on this for their living — for
me, I'm sure it will be many, many years if I
would decide to make this my full-time
job because, again, it would force me to
focus on the money, and that's not the
important part. II I can have my job that
puts food on the table and a roof on my head,
and I don't have to worry about that, then I can just
come here and be here for whoever needs, whoever
wants to hear another voice, know what's going on.
Most people here do something else and a little bit
of everything — we've got someone who's been a chi
ropractor, we've got accountants, we've got a chef. ■
