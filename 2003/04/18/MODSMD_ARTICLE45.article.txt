# The 						Raveonettes: a sweet Danish duo
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM KARAN MAHAJAN 
People in India don't speak
"Indian" and people in Mexico
don't speak "Mexican." I lell, peo
ple in America don't speak "Amer
ican," do they? So why should we
have expected the Danish to actu
ally speak "Danish"?
We had so many questions for
Danish duo Sune Rose Wagner
and Sharin Foo — also known as
The Raveonettes — such as:
"What do people in Denmark
eat?" and "What kind of clothes do
your people wear?" In the mo
ment of truth though, while sitting
inside their tour bus at Santa ("lat a
University, we wimped out,
choosing instead to ask Sharin
Foo about File Raveonettes'
music, tour and the band's recent
success with their debut album
"Whip It On." So much for open-

ing our global
horizons.
Intermission: I
know that in in
terviews, you've
said that the
music scene in
Denmark is
frustrating.
Sune Rose
Wagner: I
think it's kinda
getting better
now. It seems
the trend now
is to be more
original. For
many years, it

seemed like most people were try
ing to copy what was going on in
the States or in the UK. But it's not
going to do anything for you if you
just put together another Cold
play band. It's really interesting
because when we released "Whip
It On" in Denmark hist May, we
got really bad reviews. It seemed
people didn't get it at all. 1 guess
we are a little behind in Denmark
[smiles].
INT: Do you read the reviews a lot
and is there anything that bothers
you about what people say about
the band?
Sharin Foo: We get the question
a lot, "Does it bother you that
people compare you to the
White Stripes?" — a band we
sound nothing like. But I guess
it's the fact that we're a guy and a
girl.
INT: How did you get signed to
Columbia and were you on a small
label before that? How was the
transition to the major label?
SF: We started out with an indie
label (Crunchy Frog Records) in
Denmark but all along, we were

very ambitious. We wanted to go
beyond the Danish music scene
and wanted to aim li>r the U K and
the U.S. in particular. And we
played at a music conference, and
David Fricke was there, from
Rolling Stone, and he kind of fell
in love with the Raveonettes. And
that's how the whole ball started
rolling.
Sometimes the music industry
feels really small though, because
when there's a buzz about a band,
everybody knows, and that's what
happened to us last summer.
Everything was so new to us, but
then we hired an American man
ager who helped us navigate
through all this. We just felt good
about Columbia, and actually the
transition hasn't been difficult.
Both our indie label and Colum
bia leave us to do what we want
and don't interfere at all.
INT: Given the scene in Den-

mark, what
kind of music
do you listen
to?
SRW: We lis
ten to a lot of
old stuff actual
ly. Like The
Cookies, The
Angels,
Buddy Holly,
Richie
Valens, Ever
lv Brothers,
Suicide,
Cramps, stuff
like that. But
more contem
porary stuff, I

like "Hie Kills, White Stripes. Pri
mal Scream is one of my favorite
bands. I listen to some jazz these
days, Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Si
mone. Just music that has some
nerve and some edginess to it.
INT: We read that you spend
some time in India and that you
enjoy a lot of classical Indian and
qawwalli music.
S F: Oh yeah. About four or five
years ago, I stumbled across
Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan and
thought it was really amazing.
And then, 1 was studying at a
music conservatory in Denmark
and decided to go to India,
where I studied the dhrupat,
which is the oldest, most ancient
style of Hindustani classical
music. It was really exciting, but
the more 1 learned, the more it
was just, "This is incredible. It's
a science and a lifestyle really."
It was an inspiration for me, but
I also thought the music was so
difficult. But, I don't think you
can hear the Indian music influ
ence in the Raveonettes.
[laughs]


Who says the Danish don't know
how to loosen up? Foo and Wagner
prove otherwise.

don't speak "Mexican." I lell, peo

ican," do they? So why should we

to?
SRW: We lis
ten to a lot of
old stuff actual
ly. Like The
Cookies, The
Angels,
Buddy Holly,
Richie
Valens, Ever
lv Brothers,
Suicide,
Cramps, stuff
like that. But
more contem
porary stuff, I

like "Hie Kills, White Stripes. Pri
mal Scream is one of my favorite
bands. I listen to some jazz these
days, Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Si
mone. Just music that has some
nerve and some edginess to it.
INT: We read that you spend
some time in India and that you
enjoy a lot of classical Indian and
qawwalli music.
S F: Oh yeah. About four or five
years ago, I stumbled across
Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan and
thought it was really amazing.
And then, 1 was studying at a
music conservatory in Denmark
and decided to go to India,
where I studied the dhrupat,
which is the oldest, most ancient
style of Hindustani classical
music. It was really exciting, but
the more 1 learned, the more it
was just, "This is incredible. It's
a science and a lifestyle really."
It was an inspiration for me, but
I also thought the music was so
difficult. But, I don't think you
can hear the Indian music influ
ence in the Raveonettes.

Who says the Danish don't know
how to loosen up? Foo and Wagner
prove otherwise.
