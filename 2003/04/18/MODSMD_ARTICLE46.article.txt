# Ben Harper's melodies are 'Diamonds' in the rough
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
On my sister's and my mixed disc, titled "Sexy CD," we
included Paula Cole's "Feelin' Love," Prince's "Little Red
Corvette" and lots of Ben Harper. We like songs like "For
ever" and "Ashes" where his voice is hushed, raspy and
syrupy-slow.
iliere aren't many like that on "Diamonds on the Inside,"
Harper's latest release. Instead, he opts to experiment with
gospel-influenced rock, especially apparent in "Amen
Omen" and "Blessed to be a Witness." In "Witness," an
African chorus (Ladysmith Black Mambazo) harmonizes
beautifully in the background in lieu of instruments.

I Jar per adds his signature touches of reggae in

songs like "With My Own Two Hands," one of the
best on the album and the opening track. The
lyrics reveal artistic conscience — "I can change I
the world / With my own two hands / Make a bet-

ter place / With my own two hands" — without X
being condescending or preachy, a characteristic

that mars more than a few Dave Matthews Band songs.
Bluesy soul slinks its way into "Brown Eyed Blues" and
"When it's Good." In the latter, Harper's sexiness is in
escapable while he breathes lines like "When it's good / It's
so good / When it's gone / It's gone." Also included in the
track is a chorus of shouts and handclaps, blending a
church-like atmosphere with soul.
Amazingly, almost all the tracks benefit from Harper's
genre-twisting experimentation. In fact, the more tradi
tional rock tracks seem unnecessarily weighty in compari
son. For example, when he sings "So much sweeter / Than
all the rest / You're what lies / Between pain and death" in
"Touch of your Lust," the heaviness of Harper's vocals,
drowned in electric piano and bass, nearly smothers me.
Similarly, "Temporary Remedy" merits Harper the
standard J imi Hendrix comparisons. Emotionally charged
with a screaming slide guitar, the song rocks out but is
nothing special.
While the rest of the disc is lighter than "Temporary
Remedy" and "Lust," Harper never reaches the radio
friendly exuberance of 1999's "Steal your Kisses" — a
credit to the album as a cohesive whole. The disc may ex-

periment with many influ
ences, but none come close
to pop.
The title track is especial
ly impressive, a gentle rock
melody with a message
("When yon have everything

/ You have everything to lose"). Quietly persistent, it show
cases Harper's versatility, but never reveals artistic confusion.
The few songs reminiscent of my favorite album, 1994's
"Welcome to the Cruel World," are exceptional, as most of
Harper's sexy odes are. In "When She Believes" he whis
pers to the lucky woman, "Now all of life / Is just passing
the time / Until once again / Your eyes look into mine." I
can't decide if he's addressing his mother or lover in the
song, or maybe both? This sounds more disturbing than it
is though and doesn't take away from the close-your-eyes
beauty of the song.
Otherwise, "Diamonds on the Inside" has a different
sound than past Ben Harper efforts. Most notably, the
gospel aspect shifts the direction of this album away from
traditional rock. Besides the obvious religious references,
the subtle harmonies and soulfulness of gospel is evident
on many tracks.
The best asset, of course, is Harper's voice — a unique
mix of tenderness, energy and rasp. Whether screaming
over an electric guitar or crooning sweet nothings, that
voice is what puts him on heavy rotation on the "Sexy CD"
every time.
