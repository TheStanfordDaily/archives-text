# The
						White Stripes make 'Elephant' a gigantic treat

### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Music as direct as that made by Jack, The
White and Meg, The Slight must be hon-

ored by a tweaking of allegories: Adam

and Eve are now brother and sister,
blessed with infinite tongue-in
cheek capacity, and their intestines
are full of the undigested apple
known as rock 'n' roll. Further,

they've decided that paradise just ain't

in Detroit and that autarky must be killed
lor a two-week recording session in God's
Own Country: England. Here, they breed
snakes, show off their influences, wield
cricket bats and blast the blues.
On their album sleeve, they thank God.
Still, revelations of such Gidgeon-esque
proportions must not blind us to the fact that
I he White Stripes are essentially flag-bear
ers of an important, if recently recognized,
sub-cult: archaic sameness.
All through "Elephant" we are reminded
that though The Stripes have ably tran
scended detoxed rock-stars and de-tusked
mammals, they are tempted to cut the deck,
deal the pack and re-enact. Hut what a fuck
ing re-enaction it is — "Elephant" brilliant
ly assimilates and re-packages the commen
tary on "White Blood Cells" [WBC]. What is
lost is the innocence of the previous record;
Jack and Meg are now in on every joke and
aren't trying to conjure up new controver
sies. They forget that their supposed incest is
a relationship between themselves, not be
tween their records.

This album, of course, is all about rela
tionships — "the death of the sweetheart" as
helpfully advertised by the Liner notes. If
you ask me, the problem is that Jack has too

many sweet
hearts — he's
engaged in an
interesting vocal
threesome on
the country-ish
"Well it's true

that we love one another" — and he's so
hard-pressed that he ends up being every
one's friend and nobody's bitch ("I love Jack
White like a little brother" sings guest I lolly
Golightly).
Meanwhile, "There's No 1 lome For You
Here" is such an obvious "Dead Leaves..."
doppelganger that you begin to understand
that "Elephant" was meant as a conscious
reprise to WBC. It's a great song though —
with the sparse drumming and awesome
Robert Plant vocals nicely intact. Jack White's
steam-rolling tongue is addictive — the lyric
"completely baffled by a backward indication
that an inspired word will come across your
tongue" would be death for most singers. Fi
nally, when you expect the guitars to fall across
the table like chopped onions, they hold 'em
back, plug on a raspy chorus and background
distorted solo until your eyes are watering.
You also get the sense that T he White
Stripes are using years of accumulated criti
cal acclaim as a battering ram — can we do
long solos? Bam, yes! Can we write eerie,
sexy songs without intensive hooks (such as

Meg singing on "Cold, Cold Night")? Boo
yah! Can we convince everyone that retard
ed, inglorious drumming is a strategy? Hell
yes, because the lack of a violent drum-attack
is exactly what makes The Stripes such a
loveable (ex) couple. And I do love them.
Dearly. So, here's my advice:
To radio-rovers: "Seven Nation Army" is
the catchiest call to war I've ever heard, and
the bass-line waddles, for want of a better

metaphor, like an elephant. Love the beast.
Consumers and carnivores: This is an album
of few missteps and even fewer bass-lines. So
which one is better? The boyhood-bracing
"White Blood Cells" or the nastier-bluesier
"Elephant"? It'll take me a few years to fig
ure this one out, but I can tell you this: The
fact that the two are largely indistinguish
able will only make the endeavor more en
joyable.


The White Stripes — if they really are brother and sister, that would be weird. Brothers and sisters
don't usually aate each other.
