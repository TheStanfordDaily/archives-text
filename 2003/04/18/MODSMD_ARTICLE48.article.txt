# Ben Kweller: Not just another scrawny, pale rock star
## 
### TAM VO 
They said it couldn't be done, I hadn't set up an inter
view with the record label or venue, I didn't have a
recorder with me or even paper and a pen, but somehow
things all worked out. I'm now going to shamelessly plug
the virtues of the Siemens 546 Global cell phone because it
saved my life with its "voice memo" function. (It was sort of
silly sticking a cell phone in Ben Kweller's lace, but he
didn't seem to mind) He is disarmingly nice and ap
proachable, not at all suffering from the rock-star syn
drome that afflicts most young musicians who make it big.
I wanted to take him home with me. 1 really tried to, but
he wanted to go back home to Brooklyn.
Intermission: So what's next alter "Sha Sha" (Kweller's
full length debut on ATO records)?
Ben Kweller: Well I'm gonna start making a new album
over the summer, and I'm ... sort 0f... I'm doing a little
bit of touring, I 'm going to Japan with Adam Green from
the Moldy Peaches, I'm doing a tour on the east coast
doing for just a week and a half... and then I'm gonna
do some festivals like Coachella (in Indio, Calif.) and Bon
naroo (Manchester, Tenn.), and then I'm gonna start
making my new album over the summer.
INTU m, could you talk into the phone so that it records?
BK: That's really amazing, this phone.
INT: You can say that again.
BK: [laughs] That's really amazing, this phone.
INT: Are the Bens (referring to the trio of Ben Folds, Ben
Lee and Kweller) coming to America any time soon? They
toured overseas together earlier this year.
BK: I think so, at some point, yeah.
INT: Which wheel would you be on the Ben tricycle?
BK: Hntm ... I'd be the back left wheel, 'cause I'm left
handed, I've gotta hold down the lefthandedness.
INT: I m left-handed too, they say we're evil!
BK: Oh really? Well, Ben Folds is evil too, I guess, [grins]
INT: Was taking standardized tests really hard for you
too? Because I smeared all over the place.
BK: Yeah it's totally hard to write in general cause I smear

as I go, and we push the pen instead of pull it , right hand
ed people pull the pen so that it flows out, so the ink flows,
but we push it, see that? [motioning and gesturing with
hand, demonstrating how lefties push instead of pull]
INT: Definitely.
BK: It's a chronic problem.
INT: What's your favorite Narnia book? (Kweller has a cat
named after the lion in the C.S. Lewis series.)
BK: Narnia? I don't know what Narnia is!
INT: But your cat's name is Asian.
BK: Ohhhhh, 1 know about" The Lion, the Witch and the
Wardrobe," but I didn't name it... Liz (Kweller's girl
friend) named it, she had that cat before I met her, but I
gotta read some of those. 1 love "The Lion, the Witch and
the Wardrobe," though ... do you remember that book

"The Indian in the Cupboard"?
INT. Oh yeah, that kid Omri would lock up his plastic fig
ures in tht- magical cupboard, turn the key, and they'd
come alive ...
BK: Yeah, that was the best book ever ... that, and my fa
vorite book is Holden Caulfield, well he's one of my fa
vorite characters of all time, "Catcher in the Rye" is my fa
vorite book, 1 think.
INT: OK, one more question ... what advice do you have
for pale scrawny white guys everywhere?
BK: | laughs] 1 leh ... my advice is to go out and get a sun
burn and then when you feel better, go back outside and
get sunburned again to even it out. Eventually you have
something that looks like a tan and hopefully chicks will
dig you. I do it by going bass fishing a lot.


We dig the Sergeant Pepper coat, but that wallpaper is trippy
