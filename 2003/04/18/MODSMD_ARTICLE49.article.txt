# Seeing Ben Kweller live is worth the bike ride

### TAM VO 
First of all, it sucks to be a freshman without a car. We're
pretty much stuck here unless we hotwire someone else's ve
hicle. It also sucks to be a poor, starving student (()h, the rip
offs of Wilbur Dining overhead and 1-1 lum course readers),
so when I heard that Ben Kweller was playing a special
acoustic show at The Edge (formerly The Icon nightclub)
courtesy of 104.9 FM Alternative for only a buck fifty, 1 furi
ously pedaled my little Huff)' kid's bike down to California
Avenue, doing my damn best to not get run over.
While waiting for Ben to take the stage, I looked around
at my surroundings — somehow, The Fdge had trans
formed itself from a 21 + nightclub into an all-ages venue. 1
suddenly felt old, as half the kids in the crowd still had braces
— high school girls gushing about how "ahhhhh adorable
Ben was while reapplying their glittery, scented lip gloss
every two seconds. I wondered how many in the crowd
knew that Ben was about their age, just 16, when he was
signed to Mercury Records as the lead singer ol the much
hyped grunge punk trio Radish. Only 20 now, Kweller is
making a second musical journey at a time most rockers are
struggling to get heard for the first time.

Three Stooges" shirt, jeans and Pony sneakers, Kweller
could easily be a kid in the audience himself. Hell, with his
mop top, shaggy brown hair and non-athletic build, he
could be related to former Intermission editor Ryan Sands.
He picked up his beat-up, acoustic guitar and quickly
opened to raucous cheers with "BK Baby," his parody of the
Vanilla Ice song that you know you sang along to back in el
ementary school.
Kweller veered between his guitar, a Roland keyboard
and a harmonica for the rest of the night. He didn't hesitate
to put on the shirt emblazoned with the Burger King logo
that a fan handed him. I lis infectious energy quickly spread
itself to the crowd, something that characterizes the kinetic
performances he is known for. Like his anti-folkedelica,
indie-pop eclectic style that refuses to be pinned down, he
never remained in one place on the stage for long. Even

without drums, Kweller maintained a rockin' rhythm
throughout the entire show, his cheerful yet melancholic
voice resonated throughout the venue.
From the power-pop hooks that can be heard on faster,
upbeat songs such as the youthfully grinding "Commerce,
TX" and the addictive power of "Wasted and Ready" (start
ing off by saying "This is a great song . .. about Italian food"
in reference to lyrics such as: "Sex reminds her of eating
spaghetti"), Kweller effortlessly transitioned into lush piano
driven ballads.
What was so incredible about the evening was how kalei
doscopic Kweller's songs were, from the sunny title track
"(How it Should Be) Sha Sha," in which he hummed the
moog line in between exuberant "Sha Sha! Sha doo"s, to the
country-tinged wistfulness of "Lizzy" and "Debbie Don't
Worry, Doll." His voice cracked as he pleaded, "If I was in
your shoes, I wouldn't walk all over you / So please don't
walk all over me" while he rocked out on "Walk on Me."
After the show, I happily biked back to my dorm, humming
"Problems," Kweller's encore that night, reflecting on all (he
factors that made the show so memorable. It would be easy to
describe Ben Kweller as what would happen if Rivers Cuomo
took piano lessons from Ben Folds, but then I'd be taking the
easy route out. Don't miss the chance to see him live.
