# Students fight sexual assault
## Event in White Plaza rallies students to be more aware of sexual violence 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
About 40 women and several men carried candles and
marched last night in order to "take back the night" from
sexism and sexual assault at an event organized to raise
awareness of these issues on campus. The group stopped
in front of three dorms for spoken word performances
and also crossed campus chanting slogans like "Yes means
yes, no means no, whatever I wear, wherever I go."
"This is for people who are survivors of sexual assault
to come be part of a community," said senior Kendra Ari
moto, the organizer of the event. "It's also to create a pres
ence on campus. It's the one march and rally we have."
"Take Back the Night" is an annual event that in past
years has drawn upwards of 200 people.
"Women's liberation has been hit or miss," said third
year law student Shahid Buttar, performing a piece about
his sister. "When we stop making women walk in
fear . . . we'll hear the voice of all oppressed people. We'll
all be better off."
The rally finished with a proclamation declaring Stan
ford a "Rape-Free Zone."
"Violence against women does not distinguish between
class, race, age or locality," the crowd shouted.
"It's a very important event," said senior Mali Mo
hanan, who performed a poem she wrote on casual
hook-ups. "On college campuses, we never really talk
about relationships."
Participants agreed that the rally this year was much
smaller than in years past, but as senior Shri Mahesh said,
"It is one small step.
"This is something that even the most liberated woman
is afraid to talk about," she said.
"You'll be surprised how many women don't think
they have the power [to resist sexual advances]," Ma
hesh said. "This is saying that no does mean no. It's
about empowerment."
At the beginning of the march, Arimoto stated, "We're
small, so we'll need to make our voices heard."
Senior Valarie Brar explained, "Taking back one night
means that someday we can take back all the nights."
