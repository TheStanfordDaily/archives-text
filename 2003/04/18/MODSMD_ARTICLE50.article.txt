# Stanford grad Lindsay and her Antifolk set to perform
## 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
A shared love of In-N-Out burgers is
what brought the four members of the Pub
lic Approval together to the West Coast, ac
cording to tour member Robin Aigner.
Plus, of course, a shared love of music.
Casey Holford, Robin Aigner, Phoebe
Kreutzand Stanford alumna Jenn Lindsay
met at the Sidewalk Cafe in the East Village
of New York City, the center of the current
Antifolk music movement.
The West Coast Public Approval four
brings this foursome here to Stanford on
Friday fora CoHo concert in conjunction
with a workshop on political songwriting.
These events are sponsored by the LGBT
CRC as part of their week long Queer
Awareness Days (QuAD), which began on
April 16 with the National Day of Silence to
raise awareness about the injustices suf
fered by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans
sexual people across the country.
Antifolk as a genre began in the mid
eighties in New York City with a group of
musicians who broke off of the folk boom
and started their own movement. It incor
porates many other genres, from '80s
garage punk to Americana. Honesty
through lyrical strength seems to be the
unifying feature of Antifolk and, according
to some, that's the reason it has been going
strong for twelve years.
Casey Holford, at 23, already has a
decade of live performance experience be
hind him and two discs recorded. While his

guitar is mostly acoustic, his music is much
edgier than traditional acoustic folk. His
songs provide melodic, rhythmic and lyri
cal depth, and much personal insight that is
sometimes lacking in political songwriting.
Jenn Lindsay, a Stanford alumna hail
ing from San Diego, plays regularly for
schools, women's centers, and folk festi
vals. Her music focuses primarily on the
struggles inherent in urban life, moving
easily from quiet confessional to indignant
rallying cry, and back to personal reflec
tion. While it is easy to compare her work
to that of Ani Difranco, Lindsay says,"I
speak, write, and sing from my own expe
rience; my anger and my love are all my
own. 1 guess people just need a reference
point." Lindsay uses these Difranco's in
fluence to her advantage; pulling off and
effective mixture that evokes the Indigo
Girls and is reminiscent of Dar Williams.
Lindsay says her influences are "very situ
ational. I am influenced by whoever 1 am
listening to at the time."
It has been said that the third member,
Phoebe Kreutz, sings like a lovechild of
Joan liaez and Weird A1 Yankovic. To me,
she sounds like a female version of Adam
Sandler, only more focused on the quality
of her music than that renowned comedi
an-turned-songwriter. Working well within
the Antifolk community, Kreutz also keeps
true to her promise to never write about her
feelings.
Robin Aigner has tuned her music to al
ternative roots folk, with interesting vocals

laid on top of soothing melodies. A native
New Yorker, Aigner looks forward to her
West Coast tour as a "badly needed break
from the New York winter," as well as the
sometimes overly competitive musical
scene there.
The foursome put out a demo compila
tion CD in anticipation of the tour, with
three songs from each individual artist.
The disc works remarkably well fora com
pilation, with each musician showcasing
distinct interests and skills on every song.
Kreutz's musical style and brings some
comic relief to the otherwise emotionally
and politically charged record. Lindsay
and 1 lolford, well versed in the field of so
cial protest music, both present this talent
on their tracks. Lindsay writes protest
songs in an attempt to act as a spokesper
son that gets her voice heard, as well as to
affirm with her audience that they are not
alone in their protest. She believes protest
music is "actually music of affirmation; it
embraces hope and positivity and sup
ports a peaceful alternative."
Holford promises to make the show will
be as entertaining and en joyable for the au
dience as it will be for the foursome of
singers, by using a "wide array of tactics, in
cluding but not limited to dissonant four
part harmony, slapstick, bad knock-knock
jokes, sing-a-longs, choreography, holler
ing and wailing and good songs."

Workshop at 3 p.m. at the Fire Truck House
Performance at Bp.m. at the CoHo.
