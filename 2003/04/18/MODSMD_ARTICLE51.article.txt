### HELEN KIM 
Some men are excited by pornographic
depictions of women having sex with, say,
eels and pigs, according to David Loftus, au
thor of "Watching Sex." In a later chapter,
Loftus quotes a man who says, '"Just as
sometimes a Mac Donald's hamburger and
fries is OK, so might a quick hand job be
OK.'" I'll be sure to ask fora hand job next
time I grab a burger and fries!
Loftus' book is full of amusing, horrify
ing and curiosity-piquing quotations from
nearly 150 men who watch porn. Serving as
a counter-polemic to feminist anti-porn ar
guments, he provides an "inside" look at
what the men who actually buy and use
porn think. However, his book is no more
than a collection of anecdotes; no hard evi
dence exists to substantiate pro-porn argu
ments and weaken anti-porn ones. Loftus
ambitiously interviewed men of all ages, oc
cupations and all sexual backgrounds —
from middle-aged gay professors to young
bisexual married men and straight male
college students.
Topics in the first half of the book includ
ed: lesbians in porn, sharing porn with oth
ers and initial exposure and reactions to
porn, while the less amusing and more seri
ous ones of the latter half dealt with men's
perception of porn as reality or fantasy and
the effect that violence in porn has on men
and men's treatment toward women.
So why do many men like to see two
women touching each other more than a
woman and a man doing the same thing?
Well, according to the author, some femi-

nists say men s in
terest in lesbian sex
exemplifies a need
to "pry into and de
grade every aspect
of women's lives,"
especially because
(hey imagine them
selves having access
to all women, in
cluding those who
are not interested
in men.
Overall, most of
the gay men that he
interviewed
showed more re
spect for the
women in porn
than straight men
did. fhe fans of
bondage and vio
lence (including
one man who liked
to have sex with his
girlfriend, whose
labia was clipped
back with laundry
pins, with arms and
legs tied, eyes blind-

folded, and hot candle wax dripping on her
breasts), turned out to be horny straight
dudes. Those freakin' horny straight men
make me sick. I couldn't believe that that girl
would put up with all that. Maybe some of
the women who allow themselves or volun
teer to be in submissive positions are also to
blame.

Now onto the
more serious topics
of violence and its
i m p 1 i c at ions:
While one of the
men interviewed
pointed out that
his analysis of anti
porn arguments in
the feminist press
lacked substantial
evidence, I wonder
where the evidence
for each of the
book's anecdotes
could be found.
For instance, Lof
tus focused too
much on whether
men who watch vi
olence in porn will
be led to commit
actual acts of vio
lence. He touched
too much upon

whet her porn causes or leads to violence and
not enough on violent porn's contributory
effects on actual violence.
While reading various men's self-procla
mations that violent porn did not make
them engage in violent sex, I could not help
but remember the scientific research I read

iii my communication c lass
es. Just as media violence is
a contributing factor to real
violence, so is violence de
picted in porn. Some of the
men even said that violent

porn does not breed rapists, but that rapists
are the ones who seek those types of porn.
This whole cause-and-effect argument can
go on forever, which can lead to a shift in
blaming and lack of attention to solving any
thing. One of the men Loftus interviewed
even argued that regular media depict vio
lence and maltreatment of women more
than does porn; however, if true, does this
mean that the violence that exists in porn
can be ignored?
Perhaps this just means that we need to
try harder to either show less or no vio
lence, or when we do, to also portray the
victims' pain and not justify the violence, so
viewers would not be encouraged to imi
tate or accept it and be desensitized to vio
lent acts.
On that note, most men (except lor the to
tally psychotic abnormal pigs) seem to know
that porn (with the exception of amateur
porn) is not real and that the actors are being
paid to perform. 1 lowever, just because they
can distinguish reality from fantasy does not
mean that fantasy won't have any negative
effects. As one interviewee wisely noted,
"when pictures, thoughts and ideas get into
your head, they never get out."

Writer's note to the rule men at Stanford: Please do
not let my sassiness get in the way of your limiting
to include we in one of your amateur porn videos.

perception of porn as reality or fantasy and
the effect that violence in porn has on men
and men's treatment toward women.
So why do many men like to see two
women touching each other more than a
woman and a man doing the same thing?
Well, according to the author, some femi-

nists say men s in
terest in lesbian sex
exemplifies a need
to "pry into and de
grade every aspect
of women's lives,"
especially because
(hey imagine them
selves having access
to all women, in
cluding those who
are not interested
in men.
Overall, most of
the gay men that he
interviewed
showed more re
spect for the
women in porn
than straight men
did. fhe fans of
bondage and vio
lence (including
one man who liked
to have sex with his
girlfriend, whose
labia was clipped
back with laundry
pins, with arms and
legs tied, eyes blind-

folded, and hot candle wax dripping on her
breasts), turned out to be horny straight
dudes. Those freakin' horny straight men
make me sick. I couldn't believe that that girl
would put up with all that. Maybe some of
the women who allow themselves or volun
teer to be in submissive positions are also to
blame.

Watching Sex
/jf \ David Loftus
('§7/

Now onto the
more serious topics
of violence and its
i m p 1 i c at ions:
While one of the
men interviewed
pointed out that
his analysis of anti
porn arguments in
the feminist press
lacked substantial
evidence, I wonder
where the evidence
for each of the
book's anecdotes
could be found.
For instance, Lof
tus focused too
much on whether
men who watch vi
olence in porn will
be led to commit
actual acts of vio
lence. He touched
too much upon

whet her porn causes or leads to violence and
not enough on violent porn's contributory
effects on actual violence.
While reading various men's self-procla
mations that violent porn did not make
them engage in violent sex, I could not help
but remember the scientific research I read

iii my communication c lass
es. Just as media violence is
a contributing factor to real
violence, so is violence de
picted in porn. Some of the
men even said that violent

porn does not breed rapists, but that rapists
are the ones who seek those types of porn.
This whole cause-and-effect argument can
go on forever, which can lead to a shift in
blaming and lack of attention to solving any
thing. One of the men Loftus interviewed
even argued that regular media depict vio
lence and maltreatment of women more
than does porn; however, if true, does this
mean that the violence that exists in porn
can be ignored?
Perhaps this just means that we need to
try harder to either show less or no vio
lence, or when we do, to also portray the
victims' pain and not justify the violence, so
viewers would not be encouraged to imi
tate or accept it and be desensitized to vio
lent acts.
On that note, most men (except lor the to
tally psychotic abnormal pigs) seem to know
that porn (with the exception of amateur
porn) is not real and that the actors are being
paid to perform. 1 lowever, just because they
can distinguish reality from fantasy does not
mean that fantasy won't have any negative
effects. As one interviewee wisely noted,
"when pictures, thoughts and ideas get into
your head, they never get out."

Writer's note to the rule men at Stanford: Please do
not let my sassiness get in the way of your limiting
to include we in one of your amateur porn videos.
