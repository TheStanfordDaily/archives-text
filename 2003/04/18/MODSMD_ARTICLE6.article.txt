# OSP students not affected by SARS, war

Senior Megan Donahue was a little wor
ried when she booked her March 29 flight
home from the Stanford Overseas Study
Program in Berlin.
"I had a conversation with my dad once
about whether I should make other flight
plans, since it looked like the war might
break on the day I was scheduled to return
to the states," she said.
That was pretty much the only time
Donahue felt concerned about her person
al safety while abroad, she said. Despite al
most daily anti-war protests in Germany,
and contrary to some U.S.-media images of
rampant anti-Americanism in Europe,
Donahue said she never felt threatened or
even unwelcome by Germans during her
three months in Berlin.
Like Donahue, many Stanford students
who have studied overseas in the past few
months said they have felt very safe abroad,
in spite of international concerns sur
rounding the war in Iraq and, more re
cently, the outbreak of severe acute respi
ratory syndrome, known as SARS.
Those two threats have prompted a
number of U.S. universities to suspend
some of their overseas programs. Stanford,
however, has not been among them.
"Right now, we have no plans to alter
any of our programs as a result of the war
[with Iraq] or SARS," said Susan Christo
pher, an academic program officer for the
Overseas Studies Program.
Stanford runs no programs in the
Middle East or in China, where the war
and SARS have had the greatest impact,
respectively.
Nonetheless, Overseas Studies is closely
monitoring world events, according to
Christopher. She said the office receives a
daily "intelligence briefing" from the Office
of Risk Management outlining potential

threats abroad. The office also monitors
U.S. State Department travel advisories.
According to Christopher, Overseas
Studies can get in touch with students
quickly and has emergency plans to evacu
ate them should the need arise.
"Of course I've had students and par
ents express concerns," Christopher said.
"But so far, nobody has withdrawn from a
program because they felt endangered."
Junior Audrey Yang arrived in Japan on
Wednesday to begin a quarter of study in
Kyoto at Stanford's only overseas program
in eastern Asia. In the short time since she
left the United States, she said that SARS

lias not affected her in any significant way.
"On the plane from Los Angeles there
were one or two Japanese businessmen
with masks on," she saitl. "But I didn't sit
on a 12-hour (light with a tuberculosis
mask on. "
Yang added, "Obviously [SARS] has
made everyone somewhat reconsider any
travel to Asia, but I didn't seriously consid
er not coming to Kyoto at all."
The SARS outbreak may delay the
opening of Stanford's new program in Bei
jing, set to begin in the fall of 2004 Repre-

that when she was studying there, she did not feel uncomfortable as an American despite the
widespread opposition among Germans to the U.S.-led military action in Iraq.
sentatives from Stanford had
planned to travel to China this
summer to lay the groundwork for
the program, but they are now re
considering, according to Christo
pher.
Americans in Europe have faced
the potential fora different sort of
threat â€” a backlash by those op
posed to war in Iraq. Now that the
war is effectively over, that possibil
ity seems remote. But Stanford stu
dents who have studied in Paris
and Berlin reported that even at
the height of the anti-war protests,
they never felt threatened.
"I encountered no ill feelings
and to the contrary felt quite com
fortable and welcome in Ger
many," said Jake Kirsch, a junior
who studied in Berlin during au
tumn quarter. "Even though there
may have been general dissatisfac
tion with U.S. policy and the cur
rent administration, I was never
singled out for criticism."
Alexandra Pocek, a sophomore
currently studying in Berlin, said
that she does not feel endangered,
although she has noticed that the
American Embassy and other
American facilities in Berlin have
been heavily guarded.
Danielle Guernsey, a junior who

studied in Paris during the winter
quarter, said that exaggeration by
the U.S. media is largely to blame
for fears of anti-Americanism in
Europe.
"What saddened me was how
much the American media played
up the idea that the French hated
Americans," she said. "That result
ed in such crap as 'freedom fries'
and the dumping out of perfectly
good French wines."
Guernsey added that she the felt
the French media was also guilty of
distortion. She said that while she
was in France, she personally
"stood up for American interests
when we were accused of starting
war for oil," a perspective often cir
culated in the French press.
According to some studies,
major international crises like
war may actually heighten inter
est in study abroad. The Institute
for the International Education
of Students, a Chicago-based
nonprofit, found that the number
of Americans studying overseas in
2001 -2002 increased by 3 percent
over the previous year, in spite of
Sept. 11 and the war in
Afghanistan.
Guernsey said being in France at
a time of international upheaval
was particularly rewarding.
"Studying abroad helped me
look at the situation from a differ
ent angle," he said, "[and] not from
a purely American point of view."
