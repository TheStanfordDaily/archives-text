# OSP students not affected by SARS, war

Senior Megan Donahue was a little wor
ried when she booked her March 29 flight
home from the Stanford Overseas Study
Program in Berlin.
"I had a conversation with my dad once
about whether I should make other flight
plans, since it looked like the war might
break on the day I was scheduled to return
to the states," she said.
That was pretty much the only time
Donahue felt concerned about her person
al safety while abroad, she said. Despite al
most daily anti-war protests in Germany,
and contrary to some U.S.-media images of
rampant anti-Americanism in Europe,
Donahue said she never felt threatened or
even unwelcome by Germans during her
three months in Berlin.
Like Donahue, many Stanford students
who have studied overseas in the past few
months said they have felt very safe abroad,
in spite of international concerns sur
rounding the war in Iraq and, more re
cently, the outbreak of severe acute respi
ratory syndrome, known as SARS.
Those two threats have prompted a
number of U.S. universities to suspend
some of their overseas programs. Stanford,
however, has not been among them.
"Right now, we have no plans to alter
any of our programs as a result of the war
[with Iraq] or SARS," said Susan Christo
pher, an academic program officer for the
Overseas Studies Program.
Stanford runs no programs in the
Middle East or in China, where the war
and SARS have had the greatest impact,
respectively.
Nonetheless, Overseas Studies is closely
monitoring world events, according to
Christopher. She said the office receives a
daily "intelligence briefing" from the Office
of Risk Management outlining potential

threats abroad. The office also monitors
U.S. State Department travel advisories.
According to Christopher, Overseas
Studies can get in touch with students
quickly and has emergency plans to evacu
ate them should the need arise.
"Of course I've had students and par
ents express concerns," Christopher said.
"But so far, nobody has withdrawn from a
program because they felt endangered."
Junior Audrey Yang arrived in Japan on
Wednesday to begin a quarter of study in
Kyoto at Stanford's only overseas program
in eastern Asia. In the short time since she
left the United States, she said that SARS

lias not affected her in any significant way.
"On the plane from Los Angeles there
were one or two Japanese businessmen
with masks on," she saitl. "But I didn't sit
on a 12-hour (light with a tuberculosis
mask on. "
Yang added, "Obviously [SARS] has
made everyone somewhat reconsider any
travel to Asia, but I didn't seriously consid
er not coming to Kyoto at all."
The SARS outbreak may delay the
opening of Stanford's new program in Bei
jing, set to begin in the fall of 2004 Repre-

that when she was studying there, she did not feel uncomfortable as an American despite the
widespread opposition among Germans to the U.S.-led military action in Iraq.
