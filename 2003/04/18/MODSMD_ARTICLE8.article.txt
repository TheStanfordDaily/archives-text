# Faculty Senate reviews undergrad education
## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, the Faculty
Senate listened to two presenta
tions, both dealing with issues per
taining to undergraduate educa
tion. Vice Provost lor Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman and
Director oflntroduction to the Hu
manities Orrin Robinson spoke
about the Office of the Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education and
the Introduction to the Humanities
Program, respectively.
Bravman outlined the VPUE's
successes, challenges and future
plans for the senate.
"There is no university deliver
ing a finer undergraduate educa
tion today," he said. "We attract the
best students in the world, so we can
attract the best faculty in the world."
He pointed out that out of the
1,600 faculty members on campus,
almost half are involved with under
graduate education.

"[The students] are here to get
the world's finest education, and we
can give it to diem."
The VPUE controls numerous
programs on campus â€” among the
many are the Stanford Introducto
ry Studies, I-Hum, Sophomore Col
lege, Undergraduate Research Pro
grams and the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center.
Bravman told the senate that the
VPUE advocates general education.
"Someone has to do it,"he said.
"It is one way of expressing what we
believe in as scholars."
Some of the challenges that Brav
man faces as vice provost deal with
advising and mentoring, residential
programs and technical education
for "technophobic students."
He recognized that students
enter Stanford with different skills
and talents.
"Students enter here whose writ
ing, frankly, is scar) ," he said, telling
the senate that "it is our job to bring
them along."

Likewise, for the less technically
inclined students, Bravman stressed
the importance of the development
of quantitative reasoning skills.
Bravman estimated that 200 to
300 students per year enter Stan
ford who have real difficulties in sci
ence and mathematics.
Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo suggested that a study be con
ducted to investigate the reasons for
what Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Sharon Long called the
"techie-fuzzy divide."
Patricia Jones, a professor of bio
logical sciences, went further to sug
gest bringing back the "SME core,"
a sequence of science, math and en
gineering courses that serve a pur
pose similar to that of the I-Hum
program.
The faculty reached no conclu
sions on the matter, but a discussion
about the University's current Gen
eral Education Requirements is
scheduled for the senate's May 15
meeting.

After the questioning period fol
lowing Bravman's report on the
VPUE, Robinson gave a brief report
on die status of I-Hum five years
after its inception.
Robinson prepared a 47-page
report for each senate member out
lining the major findings of the 1-
Hum program's one-and-a-half
year-long self-study, but he referred
everyone to the unabridged, 1,234-
page online report.
Me reported that the I-Hum
courses are "getting more popular
all the time . . We have uniformly
gotten high course evaluations."
The current program gives stu
dents choices with respect to which
courses they take and does "an in
creasingly good job placing students
[in their class of choice]," he said.
"There have been a lot of big
structural changes bet ween this pro
gram and the last one," he said,
pointing out its "very unique" com
