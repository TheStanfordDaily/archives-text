Dykes to Watch Out For by Alison Bechdel
Bechdel's ( Dykes to Watch Out For) comics present an idealized community of lesbian friends, lovers and gay activists. This new collection
of "dykes" follows the politically earnest and neurotic Mo and her affable lover Harriet as they prepare to live together. Their many friends
happily promiscuous Lois; Ginger, the black college professor; Ginger's Asian housemate Sparrow; and lovebirds Clarice and Toni-make
appearances throughmsubplots that humorously detail the course of their lives and love affairs. Needless to say, Bechdel's work is political
ly correct-racially diverse to a fault, her characters routinely spout liberal political platitudes and radical sexual ideology; but her stories
combine a gentle humor with a forthright depiction of the complex social issues facing homosexual women. Her drawings are charming,
simple and skillfully comic, but the book's real gem is a separate feature, "Serial Monogamy," a very funny, autobiographical examination
of the cartoon ist's own inability to make a relationship last ("Not only do lesbians have less sex than Hets and Gay men, we break up more
often"), something with which heterosexuals can certainly sympathize. Titles include More Dykes to Watch Out For. Post-Dykes to Watch
Out For. Hot, Throbbing, Dykes to Watch Out For. Split-Level Dykes to Watch Out For. Unnatural Dykes to Watch Out For. Spawn of Dykes
to Watch Out For. Dykes to Watch Out for: the Sequel: Added Attraction! "Serial Monogamy:" A Documentary. New Improved! Dykes to
Watch Out For

The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Psychology of
Gender Bending & Transsexualism by J. Michael Bailey
Written by cutting-edge researcher and sex expert J. Michael Bailey, The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frankly controversial, intensely
poignant, and boldly forthright book about sex and gender. Based on original research, Bailey's book is grounded firmly in science. But as
he demonstrates, science doesn't always deliver predictable or even comfortable answers. Indeed, much of what he has to say will be sure
to generate as many questions as it does answers.
