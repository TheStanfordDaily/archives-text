## Celebrating Easter in Iraq 
### 
TIKRIT, Iraq (KRT) — Soldiers of Golf Troop,
10th Cavalry, didn't hunt for Easter eggs yesterday.
Instead, they c hilled out at Saddam Hussein's pool
house, checked out several of his palace complexes,
tossed a football around in one of them, comman
deered his party barge, took a dip in his private lake
and slept as long as they wanted.
There were also chores to be done like washing
clothes, taking showers, checking and cleaning their
equipment. Alter days in the field, the porcelain
thrones in Saddam's pool house bathrooms were a
special treat.
Two G Troop soldiers spent their birthdays in the
shadow of ancient ruins on the main presidential
palace grounds in Tikrit.
"I didn't think I was going to be spending my 30th
birthday in Saddam's palace," said Specialist Julio
Rodriguez, of Lubbock, Texas. "1 think Saddam
knew how to spend money on himself, but the people
don't have anything — no running water and he has
three toilets in his pool house."
Alter pushing north from Baghdad for the better
part of four days, with only brief refueling stops, the
troop set up camp in the pool house area on Saturday.
No complaints were registered by the absentee owner.
"I'd rather be at home but since I'm here, I never
thought I'd be in Saddam's palace," said Specialist
John Almen, of Apple Valley, Minn., who marked his
35th birthday on Sunday. "I thought we'd be some
where else, bullets flying.. .."
The amenities of Saddam's pool house were a
break from life in the field, but Almen said he was not
impressed.
"There's a lot of gluttony here," he said. "He was
spending money just to spend money, to say I've got
it and you don't. That's pretty sad."
Capt. Tyler Schaffer, 26, of Pennsburg, Pa., also
was offended by the opulence.
"I had wondered where all the money had gone
from the oilfields and the agriculture in Iraq," he
said. "And when I got here, it was apparent _ here's

where the money is going to. This is a billion dollar
palace, at least. .. . It's luxurious, and it's kind of like
an appendage of Saddam's ego."
Some soldiers, Schaffer among them, hadn't imme
diately realized that Sunday was Easter. Their focus,
for several days, has been on combat operations.
"My mind was more geared toward the military ac
tion .. . and what our mission is going to be, to help
these people," Schaffer said. "They had nothing when
we came here. They still have nothing, but I truly be
lieve that we can help them have a better future."
The destructive power of U.S. precision muni
tions also was apparent.
The interior of one palace was gutted, with con
crete reinforcement bars hanging like wet spaghetti
where there were once ceilings and floors, the

ground level covered with smashed plaster.
A palace building near the pool house was in much
better shape. It served as an impromptu football field,
fulfilling a vow G Troop's commander, Capt. Timothy
Jacobsen, had made before the unit left Fort Hood.
He was determined to play football at one of' Sa
ddam Hussein's palaces, and a football had accompa
nied the troop all the way from Texas.
"We're not going to damage anything. We're not
going to tear the place up," he told his soldiers.
"We'rejust going to go down there, take a look at the
palace, throw the ball around, and then leave."
So on Easter Sunday, near the banks of the Tigris
River, soldiers kicked back in Saddam's overstuffed
chairs and couches and tossed a pigskin on the de
posed dictator's marble floor.
