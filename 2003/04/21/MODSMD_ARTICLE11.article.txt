# China admits SARS cover-up

### 
BEIJING (KRT) — China's government admitted
yesterday that the number of SARS victims in Beijing
was nearly 10 times as many as had been previously
reported, and it offered a rare rebuke of its own offi
cials for mishandling the epidemic.
Besides acknowledging that it is treating 346 con
firmed SARS cases and 40'2 more suspected cases —
rather than the 37 it had previously identified — the
government took two extraordinary actions. It can
celed the upcoming May Day holiday week to dis
courage people from traveling and possibly spread
ing the disease, and it stripped the health minister
and the Beijing mayor of their Communist Party
posts as punishment.
The government put the blame for its lax reaction
to the spread of severe atypical respiratory syndrome
(SARS) on a disorganized bureaucracy but also vowed
to punish any official who tries to cover up or delay
the reporting of new cases.
At a news conference, Gao Qiang, the newly ap
pointed party boss for the Health Ministry, raised the
issue of a possible cover-up, but he denied knowing of
any instances of officials intentionally hiding patients,
despite persistent, credible reports of concealed cases
at hospitals.
Acting to clean up what was clearly a disastrously
inadequate response, Gao announced several steps to
bead off the calamitous possibility of SARS spreading
through China's population of 1.3 billion. Monitors
will be placed along transportation routes to identify
victims. Officials also will fan out to interior provinces
to oversee the local government response.
Gao signaled that the greatest risk may lie in
China's vast interior, where few cases of SARS have
been reported but 900 million peasants live in relative
isolation, cut off from adequate health care.
"Awareness among farmers generally is not as high
as in the cities," he said. "Once the disaster spread to
these areas the consequences would be especially
grim."
