Editorial

The Stanford campus voice lias in re
cent years become preponderantly
activist. Student groups from both
edges of the political spectrum
have gained high visibility, organizing so
phisticated actions addressing alleged injus
tices in labor, foreign policy and civil rights,
to name a few. Outgoing ASSU President
Monica Henestroza was elected last year
partially by appealing to this increasingly
vocal campus contingent, bringing to the
ASSU executive a message of student em
powerment. President-Elect Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President-Elect Joey Na
toli seek to expand this policy, placing strong
student representation at the top of their
platform.
As the newly elected Undergraduate Sen
ate is seated, the legislative branch is explor
ing ways to amplify student voice by consid
ering possibilities for drawing the ASSU into
more national and international political af
filiations. In contrast to many student poli
ties nationwide, the ASSU has a history of

things done. However, should the ASSU ex
change its present occupation for that of a
political impresario, the ASSU would vacate
its position as the only legitimate representa
tive student body and thereby reach a level
of futility far beyond the denunciation of
even the most cynical Stanford student.
Many candidates in the recent ASSU
election stressed their opposition to the war
in Iraq or their commitment to affirmative
action — both highly charged national po
litical issues. The College Republicans
sought some stake in next year's ASSU by
distributing several e-mails endorsing cer
tain candidates. Yet despite such posturing
and maneuvering, the most salient issues
regarding life at Stanford seem to fall out
side or even transcend retail politics. After
all, when advocating for lower laundry
costs or increased student space, does it re
ally matter how one voted in the last presi
dential election or in how many protests
one has participated?

Though a lean organization by some stan
dards, the ASSU has successfully obtained
positions for students whereby they are able
to influence several University policy deci
sions. Through the efforts of certain leaders,
the ASSU has placed students in roles where
they have become effective advocates and
negotiators. Through the work of genera
tions of Stanford students (including Cali
fornia Senator Diane Feinstein, a former
ASSU vice president), the ASSU has suc
ceeded in becoming an integral part of the
Stanford institution and persuading the
University to devote due attention to mat
ters which distinguish Stanford even among
its peers.
Despite these achievements, the ASSU is
frequently reproached for its elected repre
sentatives' setting unrealistic goals, making
untenable promises and simply not getting

tending to speak for the whole student poli
ty concerning political issues for which no
consensus exists. Furthermore, once the
ASSU makes a stance on one national issue
— such as affirmative action — it sets the
precedent for considering and supporting a
host of national and political issues.
Instead, the ASSU should empower stu
dents by creating places for anyone who
wishes to participate in the governance of
the Stanford polity and its resources, giving
such persons the opportunity to lead and
serve, building on their individual strengths
and the unique virtues of the Stanford com
munity. Rather than empowering those
without a voice, recasting the ASSU into an
activist organization would alienate more
students than it attracts, and it would de
tract time, effort and leadership from the is
sues where the ASSU can actually make a
difference.
