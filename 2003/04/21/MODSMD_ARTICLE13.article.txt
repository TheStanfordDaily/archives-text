# LETS GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Overprotected 
### 
It's another glorious morn
ing at Stanford University.
You wake up to clear sunny
skies (it's spring quarter isn't
it?) and can't wait for your im
pending adventures. No, you
aren't on your way to class and you
aren't stumbling out of someone
else's bed, completely hung over
— you're tripping over your suit
cases to find the red folder you will
be clinging to for the rest of the day.
Starting Thursday, scores of
high school seniors will flock to
"the Farm" in order to get a taste of
our campus. The problem is,
Admit Weekend is a completely
surreal, unrepresentative charade
the administration puts on to lure
prospective students and protect
them from the real Stanford.
Unless, of course, the following
description sounds like "yoli" —
that's Stanfordese for "your life."
After grabbing your red folder, fa
miliar words echo through your
head, "For all the times you stayed
up late to get it right ... we ap
plaud you." As you inwardly beam
with pride, you consult your trusty
campus map to see where your 8
a.m. financial aid seminar is held.
By 9 a.m. you can't wait to get to the
Native American Pamcake Break
fast — no it's not misspelled and
everyone's invited!
What does the average college
student do next? No, you don't go
back to sleep; you head over to one
of 50 lecture halls where Stan
ford's premiere faculty hold semi
nars just for you! Here at Stanford,
you don't have to be writing your
doctoral thesis to forge working re
lationships with Nobel Prize win
ners; they come to you. It's not like
you have to sleep with the depart
ment administrator to get into the
classes the best of the best teach. Of
course that's assuming they are not
too busy researching hydrogen su
perfluidity near absolute zero to
hold many classes.

Since it is a typical day, you
head over to Wilbur Field fora
boxed lunch gala. Here, you and
your fellow red folders congregate
to form lasting relationships and
career connections that will serve
you for the rest of your life! That is
of course, if you aren't just hang
ing out with all your friends from
high school because you came into

Stanford together and will leave it
together. After all, isn't college just
like high school without the par
ents?
But wait, it's time for the activ
ities fair and you certainly don't
want to be late in case those sign
up sheets fill up and you cannot
join Cornerstone. Isn't it great to
receive weekly e-mail reminders
from 30 different on-campus
groups, which you of course have
time to commit to?
Luckily, you aren't too far from
the starting point of a campus
tour. No Stanford student can re
sist the allure of the Papua New
Guinea sculpture garden or the
witty, informative banter of those
backward-walking tour guides.
At this point, you've probably
had enough history for one day.
Time to wind down and relax.
You head on over to the Cantor
Arts Center for your afternoon
visit to a museum. Here on cam
pus, the cultural opportunities
abound. How can a student keep
up with it all?
There's nothing much to do
until after dinner, since you don't
have any homework or anything.

By 7:30 p.m. the real fun begins.
First, you play the name game in
the lounge. No preparty can rival
icebreakers like two truths and a
lie; it really revs you up for the
night's activities. Essentially, the
entire evening is tilled with rol
licking events; college is like
camp! We play capture-the-flag,
swing dance on the catwalks and
may even go fountain hopping —
all in one night! Remember, there
is no alcohol involved since that's
illegal for our underage students.
The hippest place to be by far is
of course, Tresidder where you
will party 'till 2 am.. It's the best
thing on campus when it comes to
meeting people and getting your
groove on. You haven't been to a
party this good since junior high.
Clearly, the events of Admit
Weekend in no way convey what
college is really like. For it to be
true to life, by definition, we
should all behave normally and
let prospective students judge for
themselves whether Stanford
meets their social and academic
needs.
In fact, Admit Weekend is
probably more of a deterrent to
attending Stanford. Normal
campus activities like hanging
out at the CoHo, going to a frat
party or playing Frisbee on the
lawn beat camp activities hands
down. If we really want to sell
ourselves to these students, we
should just be ourselves and give
them a fair representation.
Admit Weekend coordinators
should spend less time overpro
tecting profros and more time
giving them balanced exposure
to everything Stanford has to
offer.

Don 7 get your profro hospitalized for al
cohol poisoning and rain it for tiie rest of
us. If you don't know why e-mail
eym@stanford.edu and aketulall@stan
ford.edu.
