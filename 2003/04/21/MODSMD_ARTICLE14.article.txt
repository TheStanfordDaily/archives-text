Ethnic theme dorms still offer a
multicultural experience
I am responding to Uri Pomerantz's
column, "Voluntary segregation" (April
17). Not all people of color are the same.
This is pretty basic but it seems as though
this fact is often overlooked.
Although people share the same race
they have a world of difference in their
experiences. In addition, theme houses
are only 50 percent of the ethnicity of the
house. Ask any person who lives in a
theme house and you will see how multi
cultural their group of friends is.
Living in an ethnic theme house pro
vides the unique opportunity to engage
with a racial group that is often voiceless
in every aspect of society. Leaving the
university without this knowledge is
what I would deem a "limited" world
perspective.
Those are just a few points to consider
when lashing out against ethnic theme
houses without experiencing one first
hand.
My freshman year I lived in Larkin, a
inostlv white all-frosh dorm. It was a dif

ficult experience but if I had the chance
to go back and choose where I'd live,
there's no doubt in my mind that I would
live there again. I am currently a resi
dent assistant in Casa Zapata and next
year will mark my third year living there.
That does not mean that I wish only to
associate with Latinos. This means that I
have the opportunity to share my culture
with other people in a unique setting and
encourage them to think differently
from the way we've been taught our
whole lives. I'd say only about half of my
friends are Latino; the rest are not. It is
offensive to draw parallels between the
segregation of half a century ago and
ethnic theme houses. When 1 read state
ments like those it proves that a huge
part of our society still doesn't under
stand the problem of race / racism in our
country (and the world). I can't begin to
explain why, so instead I leave everyone
with a challenge. If someone finds it
problematic that some students of color
"cop-out" by staying in their "comfort
zones" when choosing to live in an ethnic
theme house, I challenge them to step
out of their comfort zone and experience
living in one, too.
Just because someone enjoys ethnic
food is not enough to say that that person

understands and embraces the struggles
of many people of color who choose to
live in these theme houses (people of
color included). People should under
stand the historical and present-day sig
nificance of ethnic theme dorms before
criticizing them.

Reader 'disgusted' by presidential class
slate's reaction to voting problems
I am utterly disgusted by Fire It Up!'s
blatant attempt to take the vote away from
Stanford students. Instead of citing use
less jargon to defend their case, they
should come clean about what they are
trying to do: manipulate and coerce the
powers that be to give them the presiden
cy before a rational decision can be made.
This is the real "travesty." Manipulation
and coercion of Stanford student's life
should be left to the professionals â€” Res
idential Education (especially the folks in
charge of Row housing).
The facts are clear, though: There was a
mistake made which undoubtedly altered
the outcome in a very serious, tight race.
The prudent thing to do is exactly what the

Senate did. By creating a committee to in
vestigate, more information will come to
light and the right decision can be made.
Do these four students really want to
begin their leadership on a sour note? If
they are the real winners there is nothing to
fear. If and when this is shown, I am sure
the student body will indeed rally behind
the slate because they will be just so darn
fired up.

Ethnic theme dorms are a unique
experience for people of different races
I must admit that the column on "Vol
untary segregation" caught my eye. But
not in a way I enjoy. As a proud African-
American resident of Ujamaa, I feel that
there are some things people don't un
derstand very well. First, Ujamaa is not
100 percent black. It's not 90 percent or
80 percent or 75 percent. It's 50 percent
black and 50 percent of people other
ethnicities. Even while I'm in Ujamaa, I
don't just interact with black people.
But we know college students don't
spend all of their time in the dorm. I go

to class where I'm one of a few blacks, I
go to the gym where I'm one of a few
blacks, and I go to other dorms where
I'm one of a few blacks. If you think
about it, Stanford is about 50 percent
white so almost every other dorm has
about 50 percent white people and 50
percent of people of other races. So basi
cally someone who is white in Toyon,
Florence Moore Hall or Roble Hall feels
just how I feel living in Ujarnaa. Yet some
people have the nerve to criticize me or
any other person that lives in an ethnic
theme dorm.
But don't get me wrong. One of the
reasons I chose Stanford was because it is
so diverse. So it doesn't bother me that I
am one of a few blacks in class or in the
gym. I think it's a good experience; just
like it's a good experience for someone
from a different race to live in Ujamaa,
Okada, Casa Zapata or Muwekma Tah-
Ruk. Before passing judgments so quick
ly, I offer Uri Pomerantz and anyone
else a challenge: I want you to live in one
of these houses next year. After this ex
perience, I think you and your "alien"
may view things a little differently.
