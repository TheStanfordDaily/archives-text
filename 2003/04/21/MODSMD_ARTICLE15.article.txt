# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Senior class election needs a revote to set important precedent 
### BROOKE FINEBERG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Editor's Note: Brooke Fineberg is the campaign
manager for Fast Forward, which lost the se
nior class presidential election by 10 notes in
the final round.

When a number of my friends on various
senior class president slates made the deci
sion to run for office, they did so out of a com
mitment to their fellow classmates.
As a close friend of many of these candi
dates, I have looked carefully at the details of
the recent election. I now feel compelled to
express both my deep concern for the mem
bers of our junior class who were disenfran
chised by technical errors in the recent vot
ing process and my strong support fora
revote.
At last Tuesday's ASSU Senate meeting,
one senator noted that the most important
goal is to ensure that the election results

represent the "general mind" of the junior
class. Based on the breakdown of the votes
— Fast Forward won the first round,
BOOYAH! was eliminated by only 13 votes
in the second round and Fire It Up! won by
only five second-place and five third-place
votes — the "general mind" of the junior
class is ambiguous, at best. This lack of clar
ity was made all the more serious when all
four class president slates admittedly re
ceived personal reports that at least 10 ju
niors were not able to vote due to technical
errors while using the voting Web site.
In addition to the individual errors,
there was a major discrepancy in the actu
al voting link that was sent out to hun
dreds of students within our class. Having
received explicit confirmation that the two
primary voting Web sites would be up and
running throughout the elections period,
Fast Forward sent out a link to
elections.stanford.edu, while Fire It Up!

sent out a link to ballot.stanford.edu. The
problem was that the second Web site
worked but the first did not.
Elections.stanford.edu was down for 30
minutes during time when historically the
highest number of students goes to vote.
Two consequences resulted from this,
both of which gave Fire It Up! an undue,
unfair advantage. First, some students who
received the incorrect link may not have
come back later to try again; this seems
likely, given the profoundly low turnout
for this year's senior class election.
Second, students who received both a
working link from Fire It Up! and an in
valid link from Fast Forward may have
based their decision on this distinction.
And, if you think this sounds ridiculous,
just recall that the election was not decided
by first-place votes; it was decided by less
than a dozen second and third-place votes.
In terms of precedents, I think there

are two we can set. In a recent letter, "Se
nior class presidential slate Fire It Up! ar
gues ASSU Undergraduate Senate should
certify election results immediately" (April
17), it was stated that "to make changes to
an election that has been closed and after
the results have been released is absolute
ly unfair." This is the first precedent: to ig
nore questions of democratic legitimacy
and confirm the election results because
that's the easiest thing to do. The second
one, espoused by the coalition of Fast For
ward, BOOYAH! and Senior Citizens, is to
fight for the voice of every single junior
and the principle of democratic legitima
cy, fix the technical problems — which is
feasible and would prevent them from oc
curring in the future — and hold a revote.
I stand firmly in the second camp.
This is not about who won and who lost.
This is about democratic legitimacy over
simple expediency. This is about principle

over politics. It is decisively more valuable
to hold a legitimate election with full rep
resentation than one in which there is doc
umented disenfranchisement. Never has
this been more true than for our recent
senior class president election, which was,
in fact, the closest class presidential race in
Stanford's history.
And now our senators are faced with a
unique opportunity to exercise their con
stitutional option of withholding certifica
tion of the election. At Stanford, this is a
truly monumental decision, and although
the status quo will inevitably exert sub
stantial weight on our senators' judg
ments, it is my hope that they will seize this
chance to act with conviction and call fora
revote.
