## Home course lays traps for Stanford golf 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team never seemed to get
comfortable at this weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate, as
the competition was able to make itself right at home
on the Cardinal's own turf.
No. 11 UCLA proved that its last-place disaster at
last week's ASU Thunderbird Invitational was just a
fluke, as it jumped out to an early lead and never
looked back. The Bruins left the rest of the field in the
dust, clearing second-place Oklahoma State by 10
strokes.
This was the Bruins' fifth team title of the year and
the fourth this spring. Stanford finished seventh, 24
shots off the lead.
At the beginning of the tournament on Saturday,
the Cardinal had good reason for optimism. First, the
team played well at last week's ASU Thunderbird In
vitational when Stanford hung strong and finished
seventh in a far superior field compared to this week
end's.
Second, history was on the Cardinal's side: Last
year's squad limped into the event after two consecu
tive poor performances, but turned things around at
home, taking second-place honors.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, this year's team
could not re-capture the same magic on the first day
of competition.
The experience of junior Blake Mastalir, com
peting in the event as an individual, was typical of
Stanford on Saturday. He played 16 of his first 18
holes in two strokes under par, but double-bogeyed
the first and final holes of the round, carding a 2-
over-par 73.
"I started and finished my round horribly, but I
played pretty well in between," Mastalir said.
Senior Jim Seki led the Cardinal out of the gate on
Saturday, firing rounds of 72 and 71. Playing in his
final regiilar-season tournament for Stanford, Seki
battled back pain to finish the day tied for 18th place
individually, at one stroke over par.
At times, it was clear that Seki's back was giving him
trouble, as he did stretches between holes in an effort
to loosen the muscles.
"I've been counting the holes, since virtually the
first tee," Seki said. "After the first hole, I said, 'Only
35 left.'"
Sophomore Kevin Blue wasjust a shot behind Seki
ai the end of the first day. After struggling a bit to a
first-round 75, Blue rebounded nicely in the second,
shooting a 2-under-par 69 and moving into a tie for
24th place.
For senior George Downing, the story was re
versed. Downing started the event solidly enough,
carding an even-par 71 in his first 18 holes. He stum
bled however, on his second loop around the Stan
ford Golf Course, ballooning to a 75.
Downing's 4-over-par total of 146 on Saturday left
him just two strokes back of Blue and tied for 38th
place.
Freshman Kyle Gentry's poor first round made it
difficult to recover or position himself for Sunday's
final 18 holes. A76 in the morning dropped Gentry in
the standings, and his solid round of 71 in the after
noon could only bring him back up to a tie for 45th
place.
Rounding out the scoring for the Cardinal was se
nior Ron VVon, whose 78 in the afternoon round
dropped him into 61st.
"The course was definitely playing harder than
usual," Won said. The rough was [longer than nor
mal], and the course was playing really long."
On Sunday, Stanford was unable to post an excel
lent score, but did move up on a field that was giving
back the shots it gained on Saturday.
