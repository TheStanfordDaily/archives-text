# Card schools OSU 10-0 to close series
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A weekend that could have been
brilliant for No. 4 Stanford turned
out to be simply satisfying, as the
Cardinal split the final two games
of its weekend series with Oregon
State and remains two games
ahead of No. 6 Arizona State and
Arizona in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence race.

Friday: No. 4 Stanford 7, Oregon State 8
Saturday: Stanford 10, Oregon State 0

After taking the series opener 5-2
on Thursday behind another ster
ling performance from senior John
Hudgins, Stanford (25-11, 9-3 Pac
-10) fell just one run short of its
biggest comeback in more than a
year on Friday night. The 8-7 defeat
snapped the Cardinal's seven-game
win streak and kept it from opening
a commanding three-game lead in
the conference standings.
"We just couldn't quite catch up
tonight," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "Oregon State
bunched their hits together and
beat us in the first couple innings."
Stanford trailed 6-0 after just
two innings, as senior starter Ryan
McCally's shaky outing saw him
surrender five runs and seven hits
over 1 2/3 innings to begin the con
test. Junior David O'Hagan re
lieved McCally and allowed Ore
gon State's fifth second-inning run
before settling down for five in
nings of decent relief to keep Stan
ford close.
Stanford began stalking the
Beavers with a three-run third in
ning that was sparked by two key
at-bats.

After junior Brian Hall beat out
an infield single to lead off the
frame, junior Sam Fuld battled
Oregon State starter Jake Postle
wait to a full count and singled up
the middle to put two men on with
none out.
Senior Ryan Garko drew a walk
two batters later, and with the bases
loaded sophomore Donny Lucy
battled to foul off three 1-2 pitches
and eventually earn an RBI base
hit to center.
Next, sophomore Danny Put
nam tallied two of his four RBI on
the evening with a single to cut the
Beaver lead to 6-3 after three, and
the Stanford comeback seemed in
evitable.
Oregon State pushed the lead
back to four with a rally in the
fourth, but Putnam's fifth-inning
double scored two more runs for
the Cardinal, and after Garko
scored on a wild pitch in the sev
enth the Beaver lead was down to
one.
A mammoth solo homer by
Oregon State's Andy Jarvis in the
eighth ended up making the dif
ference, but Stanford still had its
chance in the bottom half.
A two-out Cardinal rally fell just
short, as Hall singled and Fuld
walked with two down to put ju
nior Carlos Quentin at the plate.
With the Sunken Diamond crowd
anticipating heroics from the hot
hitting junior, Quentin popped
the first pitch he saw straight up to
end the Cardinal threat.
In the ninth, Stanford pushed
one run across but senior Tobin
Swope popped up with a man on
first to send the Cardinal down for
the first time in eight games.
