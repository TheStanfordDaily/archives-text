No. 5 Stanford (21-3, 7-0 Pac-10) clinched its
14th Pac-10 conference title when it brushed
aside No. 21 Southern California (13-11, 2-5) on
Saturday after narrowly winning its heavyweight
showdown against No. 3 UCLA (20-3, 6-1) on
Friday.
For the second time in as many weeks, the Car
dinal have sophomore Sam Warburg to thank for
winning the deciding point against an opponent


DARREN BECHTEL/The Stanford Daily
Senior Scott Lipsky hits a forehand earlier this week at Stanford. The men's tennis team downed two formidable op
ponents this weekend to clinch its 14th conference title and remain undefeated in Pac-10 play.
ranked in the top five.
With the Bruins and the Cardi
nal knotted at 3-3, the only match
left to be decided was between
Warburg and UCLA's Chris Lam.
Warburg was serving at 4-5 in
the third set.
"I was just about to go to 5-5
when I saw [sophomore Phil
Sheng] shaking hands on court
six," Warburg said. "I felt a lot of
pressure at that point. It was
ridiculously loud and the people
from UCLA were so obnoxious.
"A bunch of people were
standing on the fence at the back
of my court shaking the fence
and taunting me. They were

yelling tilings at me like 'You're
going to get tight, you're going to
miss, you're terrible.' It was pret
ty cool because when I won it got
really quiet."
Alter breaking Lam to go up 6-
5, Warburg served out the match
to complete a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 victory.
Just as in Warburg's win over
California's Or Dekel in the match
that completed Stanford's 4-3
comeback against the Bears on
April 8, the key was that Warburg
didn't change his style of play
when the match reached its final
stages.
"I definitely was putting the
pressure on him. I was the one
who was being aggressive and he
was the one hanging back, just
waiting for me to miss."
The win was even more im
pressive considering the fact that

Lam had beaten Warburg in
UCLA's 5-2 victory at the Taube
Family Tennis Center only a few
weeks earlier.
"Having played him once al
ready I knew what I was going to
have to do to win," Warburg said.
"Before the match, [associate head
coach John Whitlinger] and I
talked a lot about what I did last
time against him and what I could
do a little better this time.
"For example, he really likes the
serve out wide on the ad side, so I
knew to look for that on big points.
He did that on break point at 5-5 in
the third set and I was waiting for
it."
Stanford's 4-3 victory over
UCLA marked the second time
this season the Cardinal has
avenged a loss from earlier in the
year. The Cardinal followed a 4-3

loss to Cal on Feb. 1 with a 4-3 win
on April 8.
Following the thrilling UCLA
victory, the Cardinal had little
trouble with USC, demolishing the
Trojans in 7-0 blowout.
Stanford easily won all three
doubles matches to take a 1-0
lead. The Cardinal then won five
of the six singles matches in
straight sets.
While Stanford was wrapping
up the conference title against the
Trojans, Cal and UCLA were play
ing across town for second place,
with the Bruins eventually down
ing the Bears 6-1.
Wrapping up the regular sea
son with a 21-3 record and a con
ference title, Stanford will almost
certainly host a regional for the
opening two rounds of the NCAA
tournament May 10 and 11.
