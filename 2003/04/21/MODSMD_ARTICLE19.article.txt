# Softball struggles to bring batters home

### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So close — three times.
This past weekend the No. 15 Stanford
soltball team (32-18, 4-8) dropped a trio of
matchups to defending national champion
No. 10 California (38-12,6-6) —and the dif
ference in each dual was merely one run.

The series began on the Farm Friday
night when the Cardinal came up short de
spite outhitting its cross-bay rival 5-3.
Redshirt junior Dana Sorensen took her
place in the circle in the opener and was
immediately dealt a challenge.
The Bears loaded the bases in the top of
the first, but Sorensen shut down the Cal
bats just in time, ending the rally when Cal
right fielder Jessica Pamanian ground out

with no runs scored.
A similar situation presented itself in the
third when Sorensen found herself on the
rubber with the bases loaded and one out.
The two-time Ail-American answered by
forcing two consecutive pop-ups, ending
the inning with the game still at 0-0.
The battle remained scoreless until the
top of the fifth, where, following two ques
tionable calls on a pair of Sorensen's
change-ups, Cal center fielder Kaleo El
dredge walked to first.
That set the stage for Cal senior catcher
Courtney Scott, who ripped a towering
two-run homer down the third base line
and over the fence.
Stanford waged a comeback in the bot
tom of the sixth when freshman center
fielder Catalina Morris posted her third
single of the night. The first Cardinal run
was scored when senior second baseman
Kit a (ibing launched a deep sacrifice fly to
light field allowing Morris to tag up and
score.
But the tying run remained stranded at

third as the inning ended.
In the seventh, sophomore designated
player Leah Nelson singled down the left
field line in an attempt to start a rally, but
the rest of the Cardinal lineup could not
keep it going and the Bears finished on top
2-1.
Saturday allowed Stanford two more
chances as the rivals faced off in a double
header— this time in Bear territory.
The day's opener featured Stanford se
nior hurler Tori Nyberg in the circle.
Cal was on the board first again, this time
in the bottom of the second inning. With
one out and runners at second and third,
Scott crossed the plate on a fielder's choice.
Nyberg bore down and got the last two outs
by striking out Cal shortstop Eryn Mana
han looking and forcing Kristen Morley to
pop up to end the inning.
This one run ended up being the differ
ence as the following five innings became a
pitcher's duel, in which neither offense was

The Cardinal attempted an at
tack in the fourth when sophomore
designated player Heather Shook
led oft the inning with a single to
left. Then Ching reached base on
an error putting runners on first
and third with two outs. But Cal
pitcher Kristina Thorson shut
down the Cardinal bats with a

strikeout to end the inning.
Taking the field for the third
and final time against Stanford, Cal
posted the first run of the game
again, wasting no time by crossing
home at the top of the first.
Stanford did not answer back
until the top of the fifth when
sophomore Katherine Hoffman
started the rally with a walk. Then
Morris, building on her 3-for-4
rampage from Friday's game,
smashed a triple to right center,
scoring Hoffman and tying the
game at 1 -1.

Cal threatened in the bottom of
the sixth when it loaded the bases
with one out, but Sorensen forced Pa
manian to pop out before striking out
shortstop Chelsea Spencer looking.
In the top of the seventh, sopho
more third baseman Elizabeth
Bending reached base on an error,
threatening to break the tie in Stan
ford's favor. But the Cardinal could
not make it count as its bats were
unable to bring Bendig home.
The Bears made the most of
their last at-bat , as two short flies
fell in the right spots and a single

up the middle from third baseman
Vicky Galindo combined for the
game-winning run.
The weekend ended with the
Bears winning all three, albeit by a
close margin each time and only
outhitting the Cardinal once.
"I just think they got their hits at
the right time and ours just didn't
come at the right time," Sorensen
said. "Each game was decided by
one run, and to lose three one-run
ball games is really tough. Especial
ly when you know that you are fully
capable of winning."

The Cardinal attempted an at
tack in the fourth when sophomore
designated player Heather Shook
led oft the inning with a single to
left. Then Ching reached base on
an error putting runners on first
and third with two outs. But Cal
pitcher Kristina Thorson shut
down the Cardinal bats with a

strikeout to end the inning.
Taking the field for the third
and final time against Stanford, Cal
posted the first run of the game
again, wasting no time by crossing
home at the top of the first.

Morris, building on her 3-for-4
rampage from Friday's game,
smashed a triple to right center,
scoring Hoffman and tying the
game at 1 -1.

Cal threatened in the bottom of

with one out, but Sorensen forced Pa

Vicky Galindo combined for the
game-winning run.
The weekend ended with the
Bears winning all three, albeit by a
close margin each time and only
outhitting the Cardinal once.
"I just think they got their hits at
the right time and ours just didn't
come at the right time," Sorensen
said. "Each game was decided by
one run, and to lose three one-run
ball games is really tough. Especial
ly when you know that you are fully
capable of winning."
