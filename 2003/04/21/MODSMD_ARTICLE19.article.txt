So close — three times.
This past weekend the No. 15 Stanford
soltball team (32-18, 4-8) dropped a trio of
matchups to defending national champion
No. 10 California (38-12,6-6) —and the dif
ference in each dual was merely one run.

The series began on the Farm Friday
night when the Cardinal came up short de
spite outhitting its cross-bay rival 5-3.
Redshirt junior Dana Sorensen took her
place in the circle in the opener and was
immediately dealt a challenge.
The Bears loaded the bases in the top of
the first, but Sorensen shut down the Cal
bats just in time, ending the rally when Cal
right fielder Jessica Pamanian ground out

with no runs scored.
A similar situation presented itself in the
third when Sorensen found herself on the
rubber with the bases loaded and one out.
The two-time Ail-American answered by
forcing two consecutive pop-ups, ending
the inning with the game still at 0-0.
The battle remained scoreless until the
top of the fifth, where, following two ques
tionable calls on a pair of Sorensen's
change-ups, Cal center fielder Kaleo El
dredge walked to first.
That set the stage for Cal senior catcher
Courtney Scott, who ripped a towering
two-run homer down the third base line
and over the fence.
Stanford waged a comeback in the bot
tom of the sixth when freshman center
fielder Catalina Morris posted her third
single of the night. The first Cardinal run
was scored when senior second baseman
Kit a (ibing launched a deep sacrifice fly to
light field allowing Morris to tag up and
score.
But the tying run remained stranded at

third as the inning ended.
In the seventh, sophomore designated
player Leah Nelson singled down the left
field line in an attempt to start a rally, but
the rest of the Cardinal lineup could not
keep it going and the Bears finished on top
2-1.
Saturday allowed Stanford two more
chances as the rivals faced off in a double
header— this time in Bear territory.
The day's opener featured Stanford se
nior hurler Tori Nyberg in the circle.
Cal was on the board first again, this time
in the bottom of the second inning. With
one out and runners at second and third,
Scott crossed the plate on a fielder's choice.
Nyberg bore down and got the last two outs
by striking out Cal shortstop Eryn Mana
han looking and forcing Kristen Morley to
pop up to end the inning.
This one run ended up being the differ
ence as the following five innings became a
pitcher's duel, in which neither offense was

Freshman centerfielder Catalina Morris slides into home earlier this year. Despite dropping
three to rival Cal this weekend, Morris continued her explosive rookie effort at bat.
