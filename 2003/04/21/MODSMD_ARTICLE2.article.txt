### JANICE SANCHEZ 
In collaboration with colleges
from across the nation, the History
Department hosted a workshop last
Saturday titled "Islam and Globaliza
tion, Islam and Localization." Stan
ford professors and graduate stu
dents who specialize in Islamic stud
ies participated in this forum with
colleagues from other universities.
The workshop was divided into
sessions: "18th and 19th Centuries,"

"Late 19th and 20th Centuries,"
"20th Century African Case Stud
ies," and "Late 20th Century Glob
alization." Each session explored re
ligion, scholarship and politics.
Stanford History Prof. Joel
Beinin and Associate Prof. Ahmad
Dallal headed the event.
According to Dallal, the dia
logues were meant to encourage
communication on a variety of
subjects within Islam. They ex
plored the Islamic movement
from historical perspectives in dif
ferent regions in the Middle East,
North Africa and the Ottoman
Empire. The debate centered
around the question of localization
and globalization of Islam and the

frequent intersection of the two.
Dallal said the aim of the work
shop was to "explore global trends as
well as local trends in the 18th, 19th
and 20th centuries.. These are very
important geographical questions.
"[The forum] is looking at the
picture of globalization in a long
historical complex rather than see
ing it as a modern phenomenon."
According to Emily Burrill, a
Stanford history graduate stu
dent who attended the event,
"[Globalization] has historic roots
. . .it isn't something that has
popped out in recent decades.
Islam has been a means of creat
ing networks."
Temple University Prof. Peter
Gran cautioned audience members
in using the vocabulary of politicians
before clearly defining it historically.
Also discussed were the subjects
of religiosity, protest, reform, poli
tics, pan-Islamism and resistance.
The controversy over Saudi-funded
schools was explored by NYU doc
toral student Isa Blumi who said he
believes they promote isolationism.
Scott Reese, a graduate student

from the University of Northern
Arizona, had a somewhat optimistic
view regarding Muslim people's re
tainment of their own local culture.
"The Da'wa is not necessarily an
irresistible force; people do reject it

in favor of their own traditions,"
Reese said.
Forum attendees did not only dis
cuss economic and political factors of
the globalization in Islam, but also the
influence of culture.

Mark LeVine, a graduate stu
dent of UC-Irvine, advocated a
more holistic framework on view
ing globalization. Me called fora
"new conception of public
sphere."
