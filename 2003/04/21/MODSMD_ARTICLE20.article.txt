# Track and field rewrites record books
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Although the teams may not have qualified as many
athletes to the West Regional Championships as they
wanted, the Cardinal track and field rosters posted stel
lar performances over the weekend Mt. San Antonio
College Relays and Pomona-Pitzer Invitational.
Under the lights of Mt. SAC Stadium on Thursday,
Stanford senior Lauren Fleshman posted the fastest
5,000-meter time by a collegian this year, placing second
in a stacked field of elite athletes from around the globe.
The race was almost a repeat of Indoor Nationals,
with defending indoor champion Sara Gorton of Col
orado pulling away from Fleshman and Cardinal Alicia
Craig late in the race.
But a final surge pushed Fleshman in front of Gorton
this time and just shy of Ethiopia's Ejegayehu Dibaba,
who claimed first.
Fleshman's time of 15 minutes, 23.94 seconds is a new
school record, ousting Olympian PattieSue Plumer's
mark of 15:29.0 set in 1984 and is the third-fastest time
ever tallied in-season by a collegian.
With her performance, Fleshman becomes a viable
contender to qualify for the world championships in
June.
"I plan to train like a person that has a chance to con
tend for the U.S. team," Fleshman said. "The prospect of
racing throughout the summer is exciting but certainly
does not undermine my commitment to our team goals.
"I have a fantastic team with awesome opportunities
that most world champions probably can't say they had
the chance to experience or be a part of when they were
in college."
In her outdoor collegiate debut, Craig's time of
15:25.75 also bested the school record and was good
enough fora fourth-place showing behind Gorton. The
mark makes her the fifth-fastest collegian ever and
breaks the freshman school record — held by Fleshman
— by a whopping 24 seconds.
Earlier in the day, sophomore Sara Bei won the open
division of the 5,000 with a personal best 16:03.08 in her
first race since having knee surgery — the injury forced
her to redshirt the indoor season.
In the men's 5,000, junior Louis Luchini blasted a
personal best 13:31.80 for fifth place and the No. 3 spot
all-time at Stanford.
Sophomore Jeane Goff placed fifth with a time of
10:24.32 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, qualifying for
the West Regional Championships at the end of May.
Sophomore Erin Merriman notched a career-best of
144 feet, 8 inches in the javelin throw to take second
place.
On Friday at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, the field
events took center stage.
Senior weight throwers Omer I nan and Nick Weli
hozkiy made their season debuts in the discus and ham
mer, respectively.
Inan won the discus with a toss of 189-2, while Weli
hozkiy took third in the hammer with a personal-best
213-0. The marks are some of the best recorded in the
West Region so far.
Junior Jason Goff made his season debut in the
javelin with a throw of 201-6, good for fourth and a re
gional qualifying mark.

Senior Lauren Fleshman — seen here running cross country at the Stanford Invitational —
broke the longtime 5,000 meter school record at the Mt. SAC relays this weekend.

800-meter runners were record
ing some strong marks.
Senior Malindi Elmore placed
seventh in the 800 with a West
Regional qualifying time of

On the men's side, redshirt
freshman Justin Romaniuk and
sophomore Evan Fox also hit the
qualifying mark with their re
spective times of 1:50.79 and
1:50.94.
The Cardinal's effort on the
final day of competition was high
lighted by Milton Little and Lind
sey Johnson.
Little rose to the occasion in the
long jump, placing second in a tal
ented field with a career best 25-
11, good enough for No. 3on
Stanford's all-time list.
Johnson capped off a spectacu

ish in the 400-meter hurdles in
58.84 seconds. Her time is No. 2 in

"I plan to train like a person that has a chance to con
tend for the U.S. team," Fleshman said. "The prospect of
racing throughout the summer is exciting but certainly
does not undermine my commitment to our team goals.
"I have a fantastic team with awesome opportunities
that most world champions probably can't say they had
the chance to experience or be a part of when they were
in college."

— by a whopping 24 seconds.
