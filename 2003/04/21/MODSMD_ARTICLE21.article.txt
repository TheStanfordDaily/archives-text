The Stanford Women's lacrosse team had two expe

er and losing.

Women's Lacrosse
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford 4, No. 1 Loyola 9

As the sun beat down on its home field on Saturday,
the Cardinal faced off against No. 1 Loyola, a program
that, along with a perfect season and some impressive
speed and skill, now boasts a 9-4 win over No. 15 Stan
ford.
Both teams, however, got off to a slow start, and a de
fensive game dragged on without a goal for the first 15
minutes of play. But the momentum created by a Grey
hound goal scored with 13 minutes remaining in the half
propelled another that followed less than a minute later.
Stanford freshman Megan Burker answered widi a
strong run up the field and a last-second dish to senior
Kim Cahill for what would be the only Cardinal goal of
the half.
Working the ball inside, Loyola scored with six min
utes to go and then again with three minutes remaining,
bringing the score to 4-1 in the Greyhounds' favor.

The fourth and final goal of the half resulted in a de
fensive huddle, but there was little time left for the Car
dinal to react. Even so, sophomore Nina Pantano lifted
the crowd and her team with an unexpected intercep
tion and three threatening shots in the waning seconds.
The Cardinal left the field down by three.
During halftime, Cardinal coach Michele Uhlfelder
encouraged her team by reviewing the game plan.
"At that point, we saw coming out as a restart,"
Uhlfelder said, explaining that the second half could be
seen as an entirely different matchup and asking her
team for more fire and better execution.
To a certain extent, the Cardinal delivered. The
physicality of both teams increased in the second half,
and the scrappy play of freshman Cassie Harvey often al
lowed the Cardinal to come up with the ball on draws.
But the beginning of the second half was dominated of
fensively by Loyola, who scored within the first two min
utes of play.
Shooting at the other end of the field was not going so
well.
"It's not like we didn't have the opportunities," Pan
tano said. "We just didn't finish. You can't win a game
only putting four of your shots in the net."
The Greyhounds hardly seemed fatigued by their

Junior Nina Pantano slips past a Loyola defender en route to the goal. Pantano's goal cut the Cardinal deficit to four
with 13:29 left in the match. Stanford could not overcome the difference, however, and dropped the 9-4 decision.
