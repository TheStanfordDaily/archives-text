# No. 1 Loyola edges Card lacrosse

### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Women's lacrosse team had two expe
riences this weekend it hasn't had in a while: great weath
er and losing.

Women's Lacrosse
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford 4, No. 1 Loyola 9

As the sun beat down on its home field on Saturday,
the Cardinal faced off against No. 1 Loyola, a program
that, along with a perfect season and some impressive
speed and skill, now boasts a 9-4 win over No. 15 Stan
ford.
Both teams, however, got off to a slow start, and a de
fensive game dragged on without a goal for the first 15
minutes of play. But the momentum created by a Grey
hound goal scored with 13 minutes remaining in the half
propelled another that followed less than a minute later.
Stanford freshman Megan Burker answered widi a
strong run up the field and a last-second dish to senior
Kim Cahill for what would be the only Cardinal goal of
the half.
Working the ball inside, Loyola scored with six min
utes to go and then again with three minutes remaining,
bringing the score to 4-1 in the Greyhounds' favor.

The fourth and final goal of the half resulted in a de
fensive huddle, but there was little time left for the Car
dinal to react. Even so, sophomore Nina Pantano lifted
the crowd and her team with an unexpected intercep
tion and three threatening shots in the waning seconds.
The Cardinal left the field down by three.
During halftime, Cardinal coach Michele Uhlfelder
encouraged her team by reviewing the game plan.
"At that point, we saw coming out as a restart,"
Uhlfelder said, explaining that the second half could be
seen as an entirely different matchup and asking her
team for more fire and better execution.
To a certain extent, the Cardinal delivered. The
physicality of both teams increased in the second half,
and the scrappy play of freshman Cassie Harvey often al
lowed the Cardinal to come up with the ball on draws.
But the beginning of the second half was dominated of
fensively by Loyola, who scored within the first two min
utes of play.
Shooting at the other end of the field was not going so
well.
"It's not like we didn't have the opportunities," Pan
tano said. "We just didn't finish. You can't win a game
only putting four of your shots in the net."
The Greyhounds hardly seemed fatigued by their

first-half performance, consistently
outsprinting the Cardinal through
the midfield. Their speed provided
several opportunities in the second
half, the first of which Loyola con
verted to a goal with 24 minutes re
maining. Three minutes later, the
Greyhounds notched another, mak
ing the score 6-1.
"From a raw sprint standpoint,
Loyola is definitely one of the fastest
teams in the country," admitted
Ulfhelder, going on to compare the
Greyhounds to another team in the
top three that has also defeated Stan
ford. "But I certainly think Duke
moved the ball down the field
faster."
It seemed that Stanford was
building to a comeback when two
Cardinal goals within five minutes of
each other buoyed team and crowd
confidence alike. Sophomore Kelsey
Twist responded to the five-goal
deficit with a score from the outside,
and with 13 minutes remaining,
Pantano received the ball with her
back to the goal, turning to shoot for
a score that might have been the
turning point of the game.
But Loyola's relentless drives and
patient offense proved too much for
the Cardinal, who let slip two more
goals before Harvey netted a goal,
this time on a free position shot. Har
vey's goal with under five minutes to
go marked Stanford's first successful
penalty conversion, usually blocked
by the excellent play of Loyola's
goalkeeper, who consistendy de
flected free position shots from a dis
tance of only eight meters.
Even when the Greyhounds led
by four with only three minutes re
maining, Loyola pushed fast down
the field for the final goal of the game.
Uhlfelder said the pressure of
playing the top-ranked team in the
country was not a factor in Cardinal
play and Harvey agreed.
"Going into it they had every
thing to loose, and we had nothing
to loose," Harvey said. "We should
have capitalized on their mistakes,
ground balls, just the little stuff."
Similarly, Uhlfelder is taking the
loss in stride, concentrating on the
ongoing improvement of the pro
gram.
"We're really focused on step
ping up our game and reinventing
ourselves," Uhlfelder said.
Pantano added, "It's clone now.
We have three more regular season
games to take care of business."

first-half performance, consistently
outsprinting the Cardinal through
the midfield. Their speed provided
several opportunities in the second
half, the first of which Loyola con
verted to a goal with 24 minutes re
maining. Three minutes later, the
Greyhounds notched another, mak
ing the score 6-1.
"From a raw sprint standpoint,
Loyola is definitely one of the fastest
teams in the country," admitted
Ulfhelder, going on to compare the
Greyhounds to another team in the
top three that has also defeated Stan
ford. "But I certainly think Duke
moved the ball down the field
faster."
It seemed that Stanford was
building to a comeback when two
Cardinal goals within five minutes of
each other buoyed team and crowd
confidence alike. Sophomore Kelsey
Twist responded to the five-goal
deficit with a score from the outside,
and with 13 minutes remaining,
Pantano received the ball with her
back to the goal, turning to shoot for
a score that might have been the
turning point of the game.
But Loyola's relentless drives and
patient offense proved too much for
the Cardinal, who let slip two more
goals before Harvey netted a goal,
this time on a free position shot. Har
vey's goal with under five minutes to
go marked Stanford's first successful
penalty conversion, usually blocked
by the excellent play of Loyola's
goalkeeper, who consistendy de
flected free position shots from a dis
tance of only eight meters.
Even when the Greyhounds led
by four with only three minutes re
maining, Loyola pushed fast down
the field for the final goal of the game.
Uhlfelder said the pressure of
playing the top-ranked team in the
country was not a factor in Cardinal
play and Harvey agreed.
"Going into it they had every
thing to loose, and we had nothing
to loose," Harvey said. "We should
have capitalized on their mistakes,
ground balls, just the little stuff."
Similarly, Uhlfelder is taking the
loss in stride, concentrating on the
ongoing improvement of the pro
gram.
"We're really focused on step
ping up our game and reinventing
ourselves," Uhlfelder said.
Pantano added, "It's clone now.
We have three more regular season
games to take care of business."
