# Irvine spikes past Cardinal in MPSFs
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time in six years,
the men's volleyball program
hosted a postseason match. As it
had hoped, Burnham Pavilion
was packed with Cardinal faithful
and emotions were running high.

Men's Voueybau
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford 1, No. 6
UC-lrvine 3

Ironically, the atmosphere may
have been the demise of No. 4
Stanford (17-12, 14-9 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) as it fell
to No. 6 UC-lrvine (20-10, 13-10
MPSF) in four games.
"Maybe we just got caught up in
the moment," coach Don Shaw
said. "We didn't play anywhere
near the level we've been playing
the last few weeks . . . Irvine had a
lot to do with that though."
What ultimately made the dif
ference was not the Anteaters
highly touted defense, but the
Cardinal's inability to slow down
Irvine's attack.
Irvine's middle blocker tandem
of freshman Nic Vislay and junior
Kyle Weichert, which had been
largely ineffective in the two
teams' previous match, racked up
12 kills apiece, with Vislay hitting
.455 and Weichert .500.
"When [Irvine] is passing as
effectively as they did [on Satur
day], they can run a game plan
like that," Shaw said. "We
weren't expecting them to use
their middles that much because
their outside hitters, especially
Pelzel, are the ones that really
carry the load."
The efficiency of the blocking
duo enabled the Anteaters to uti
lize their biggest threat: junior
outside hitter Jimmy Pelzel.
Pelzel was everywhere for
Irvine, finishing with a double
double on 29 kills — the third
most allowed by the Cardinal all
season — and 10 digs.
But it was the Cardinal who
started the night off strongly.
In game one, Stanford rode the
hot serving of senior outside hitter
Will Curtis to build a substantial
18-12 lead. The Cardinal contin
ued its strong play to hold its six
point lead and get to game point at
29-23.

The Anteaters wouldn't roll
over and give up on game one and
Stanford's struggle en route to
that first win helped the momen
tum swing in Irvine's favor.
"We had a really big high in
the first game," redshirt sopho
more setter Kevin Hansen said.
"In the second game I think that
kind of let up and our emotions
got to us. They got the momen
tum and we just couldn't stop
them."
Game two saw the Anteaters
jump out to a four-point lead, due
to four early kills from Pelzel.
The Cardinal chipped away at
the lead throughout the game and
even managed to tie the game at
25 and 26. But Irvine always re
sponded, eventually finishing with
a 30-28 win to tie the match at one
game apiece.
During game three, the frustra
tion was evident on the faces of the
Cardinal.
"They served very, very effec
tively," Shaw said. "They went
after Curt [Toppel] who is not one
of our primary passers. They just
pinpointed serves very well."
Irvine's aggressive serving and
accurate passing put them up 28-
20, and the Cardinal's short streak
of points wasn't enough to post a
comeback.
In what would be the final
game of the Stanford season, the
Cardinal got off to a slow start.
With the help of five early Stan
ford errois, the Anteaters went
up 8-4 and then extended it to 12-
7.
"When it comes down to it, we
just made too many mistakes
tonight," senior opposite hitter
Curt Toppel said. Toppel led the
Cardinal with 22 kills on a .400 hit
ting percentage. He also chipped
in four digs.
However, the Cardinal came
back and tied the score at 24 on a
booming service ace from Toppel.
It was Pelzel who drove the
dagger into the Cardinal team
when he posted a huge kill which
brought another match point for
the Irvine, allowing the Anteaters
to finish things off with a massive
block off a Toppel attack.
"They just played better than
us tonight, and when two teams
are that evenly matched, the team
that plays better is the team that
wins," Toppel said.

Senior Paul Bocage goes for the spike earlier this year. Bocage's career ended prematurely as the Cardinal fell to No.
6 UC-lrvine in the quarterfinals of the MPSF tournament. No. 4 Stanford concluded its season at 17-12.
