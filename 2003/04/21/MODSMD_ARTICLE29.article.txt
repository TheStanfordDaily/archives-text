# 'Project' hosts high schoolers
## Low-income, minority students shadow undergrads for a day on the Farm 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Thursday, Project Motivation held its an
nual "Day with an Undergrad" event, aimed at
promoting higher education to California low-in
come, minority high school students. Between 11
a.m. and 2 p.m., approximately 90 high school stu
dents shadowed Stanford undergraduates as they
went to their classes.
Project Motivation was initially started by
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA).
It now exists as an independent student-run organi
zation. Throughout the year, Project Motivation or
ganizes panels in which Stanford undergraduates dis
cuss their college experience and tours for low-income
high school students. Thursday's event ran in con
junction with Stanford Upward Bound.
Organizer Saskias Casanova, a junior at Stanford,
said the program "got started because low-income
students are underrepresented at Stanford."
"[There is a] need for more role models for stu
dents who see college as something they can't achieve
because of their low-income status," Casanova said.
After attending classes with students, participants
went to the closing ceremonies held at the Asian-
American Community Center. The organizers held a
raffle that distributed Stanford gear, including a bas
ketball signed by the men's basketball team as the
grand prize.
The various activities held throughout the day,
such as performances by Jam Pac'd and Mariachi
Cardenal de Stanford, were aimed at dispelling
popular stereotypes of Stanford and displaying its
diversity.
Finally, Admissions Officer Marcella Muniz spoke
at the closing ceremonies. She related her own expe
rience as a former Stanford undergraduate coming
from a typical conservative Mexican family.
"I thought that Stanford wasn't a place for me,"
Muniz said, citing her mistaken impression of Stan
ford's lack of diversity. She then explained that she re
alized that she could be happy at Stanford despite ini
tial apprehensions about applying.
Muniz was critical of stereotypes of minorities. She
read out several jokes that started, "You know you're

Mexican if..." or "You know you're ghetto if..."
She said that though she identified with many of the
stereotypes, she noted that none of them addressed
the issue of higher education amongst minorities.
She expressed disappointment that there was a
lack of awareness amongst minority communities re
garding the attainability and necessity of higher edu
cation.
The high school students involved felt that the
event, along with other programs conducted by Pro
ject Motivation and Upward Bound helped answer
many questions about college.
Nick Lee, 15, discussed why he initially got in
volved with Upward Bound.
"I needed help with high school; I thought that
since they [Upward Bound] have tutoring, they could
help out a bit; it's also supposed to help you get into
college."
When asked about the influence Project Motiva
tion had on him, he said, "I want to apply to college
more, 1 feel like I'm more motivated to do stuff. I
wouldn't have tried so hard before."
Jackie P lores, 16, said that Project Motivation
helped her figure out her goals and provided infor
mation on how to apply to college.
"It helps you figure out what you want to do,
which field you want to be in," said Mores. "I didn't
know how to do it [apply to college], what kind of
grades, CPA, SAT scores [and] extracurriculars I
needed."
Stanford students were enthusiastic about the
event as well.
"I guess I liked the idea of sharing my Stanford ex
perience," said freshman Lara Burenin. "The idea is
to encourage high school students not necessarily to
come here but to apply to college in general. 1 lope
fully I gave the high school students an idea of what
college is like... it definitely becomes more real
when you come here."
Freshman Neepa Acharya said, "[We] tried to get
them excited about the prospect of going to college
without worrying about the money issue. A lot of
them worry that they can't rise above their socioeco
nomic status."
Junior Carmen Cordova said that many of the stu
dents selected for the "I)ay wi than U ndergrac 1" event
had already shown some interest in college. She felt
that the program helped show them what college has
to offer.
"I think a lot of students are going to come out hav
ing a l>etter outlook on Stanford just by coming here,"
Cordova said. "It's a little more real now."
