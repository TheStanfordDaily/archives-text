# Overseas Studies to open Beijing campus
## SARS concerns do not slow down plans to host studies in Beida University in 2004 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite worldwide concern about the health
risks of SARS, the staff at Overseas Studies is
moving swiftly forward with plans to open a new
campus in Beijing, China for the 2004-2005 aca
demic year.
"We're hoping to open a program in collabo
ration with Beida University in Beijing," said
Irene Kennedy, associate director of OSP.
Beida, for the linguistically inclined, is formed
from an abbreviation of the words "Beijing," the
Romanized spelling of China's capital city, and
"Da-she," the Chinese word for university. The

school is also known as Beijing University and,
formally, Peking University.
Overseas Studies hopes to offer students an
opportunity to study at the campus in both the
autumn and spring quarters. Not all students
will get a chance to participate, however; there
will be a Mandarin language requirement, al
though the specifics of the requirement are still
being discussed.
"It will be modeled after our other overseas
programs," Kennedy said. "There will be a range
of courses, some really specific to the location and
environment." As with other Stanford programs,
there should also be a number of GER-fulfilling
courses.
"It would be a pretty diverse mix," she said.
"The Stanford faculty member in residence will
offer one or two courses and the bulk of the
courses will be taught by the local faculty."
According to its Web site, Beida consists of 30
colleges and offers 93 specialties to its undergradu

ates. Its schools range from traditional offerings like
the College of Mathematics and Sciences and the
School of International Studies to one-of-a-kind
academic fare like the College of Marxism, which
offers a degree in the Education of Ideal Politics.
Beida is widely considered one of the top univer
sities in China; the education Web site Netbig.com
placed the school second in a recent survey of
China's major universities. Tsinghua University, lo
cated in northwest Beijing, garnered the top prize.
The school is benefiting from a major increase in
government spending on research universities, re

of education in Asia three years ago. According to
the study, the boon has resulted in a new library,
theater and humanities building for the school. All
dormitories have been wired to the Internet as well.

the university last January and came to a final
