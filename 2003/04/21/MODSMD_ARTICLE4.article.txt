# Murray raises awareness in Diversity Fest
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Crowds of students gathered in White Plaza
Friday afternoon to watch performances and
attend a fair for the second Diversity Fest pre
sented by Murray, the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity focus dorm. The festival,
which was originally held in Murray to cele
brate and raise awareness about diversity, was
moved to White Plaza this year to be more ac
cessible to students.
"I feel that the event was a great success,
since our goal was to attract students from all
walks of diversity," said junior Lauren Rhue,
one of the Murray focus assistants who had
been planning the festival since January. "We
saw students of all different backgrounds
watching some of the talent and learning about
some of the issues in our communities here at
Stanford."
To illustrate the diversity of the student
body, the festival featured a number of student
organizations that displayed information, art or
food from their cultures. A number of groups
were represented, including the Society of
Black Scientists and Engineers, Hapa Issues
Forum, the Philipino American Student
Union, the Central American Students Associa
tion, the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and Hillel.
Hapa Issues Forum presented a blank can
vas with the question "What are you?" Students
at the fair were encouraged to express their an
swers with the use of paint and glitter.
The festival also featured a variety of student
performances, including spoken word, Mari-

achi Cardenal, Beat Junkies, Ballet Folklorico
and Stanford Gospel Choir.
"I got involved with the festival because of
my belief in poetry's ability to affect positive
changes across Stanford's diverse communi
ties," said spoken word performer Mark Otut
eye, a sophomore.
Murray later hosted a panel titled "The Mar
gins of Diversity" with Sociology Prof. Matt
Snipp and History Prof. Gin Pang. The discus
sion centered around the concept of "diversity
within diversity — how different groups within
ethnic minority populations have in them peo
ple who feel marginal to their communities,"
Snipp said. "The main idea is that when people
use the term 'diversity' in fact, it's a much more
complicated idea than they often think."
Afterward, 60 students attended an open

house at Murray to learn what it was like to
live in the CSRE-focus dorm, which has "fos
tered a very open and provocative environ
ment regarding issues of race and ethnicity,"
according to focus assistant Willow Miller-
Young, a senior.
Organizers are confident that the festival,
which was sponsored by The Riddell Fund, the
Dean of Students Office, the Modern Thought
and Literature Department, the Religious
Studies Department and the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, will be
come a well-known annual event.
"I was surprised to see how many different
student groups exist on campus," said fresh
man Stephanie Lin. "This event could've
shown [prospective freshman] how diverse
your Stanford experience can be."
