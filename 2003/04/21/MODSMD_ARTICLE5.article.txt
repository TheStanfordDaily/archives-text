# Stanford wins first I-Challenge

### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
The "Big Game" of technology
blasted off last Saturday at Arrilla
ga Alumni Center in what can be
best characterized as an intellectu
al quest. The first-ever Innovators'
Challenge showcased engineering
research at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, and this year Stanford
won the competition.
The Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students,
also known as Bases, and VER
TEX, the engineering entrepre
neurial club at UC-Berkeley, host
ed the event. The competition at
tracted well over 100 individuals
from Stanford and the surround
ing community.
"It's really a tech design con
test," said Nate Ota of VERTEX, a
UC-Berkeley doctoral candidate.
"The goal is to find the best and
brightest that came out."
Competing fora $25,000 prize
pool, students at the doctoral,

graduate and undergraduate lev
els presented their research to a
group of 30 industry leaders con
sisting of venture capitalists and
founders of leading engineering
and technology companies. Stu
dent research and product design
were assessed on the basis of inno
vation and product potential.
"I was very struck from the list
of abstracts," said Shankar Sastry,
adviser to VERTEX and chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci
ence at UC-Berkeley. "We were
blown away by how in the past cou
ple of years the trends [in technol
ogy] have changed so dramatic al
ty-
Presentations at I-Challenge
were primarily focused on hard
ware and devices, manufacturing
and processes, software and infor
mation technology and bioengi
neering fields.
Pedram Keyani, a graduate stu
dent in computer science at Stan
ford, showcased what can poten

tially make peer-to-peer file sys
tems like Gnutella and iMesh
more robust from attack by hack
ers.
"If a small percentage of highly
connected nodes fail, the whole
system fails," Keyani said. He ex
plained how his software, coupled
with the appropriate hardware,
detects attacks and recovers from a
failure.
Brian Bircumshaw, a UC-
Berkeley doctoral candidate, pre
sented RBAR, a Micro Electr
o Rf device that may be
a component in the next genera
tion of cell phones.
"With RBAR, power consump
tion is reduced by a factor of 10 to
100 over contemporary wireless
solutions," Bircumshaw said.
"Your favorite wireless [device]
will cost less and last longer."
