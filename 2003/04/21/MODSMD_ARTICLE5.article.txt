# Stanford wins first I-Challenge
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
The "Big Game" of technology
blasted off last Saturday at Arrilla
ga Alumni Center in what can be
best characterized as an intellectu
al quest. The first-ever Innovators'
Challenge showcased engineering
research at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, and this year Stanford
won the competition.
The Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students,
also known as Bases, and VER
TEX, the engineering entrepre
neurial club at UC-Berkeley, host
ed the event. The competition at
tracted well over 100 individuals
from Stanford and the surround
ing community.
"It's really a tech design con
test," said Nate Ota of VERTEX, a
UC-Berkeley doctoral candidate.
"The goal is to find the best and
brightest that came out."

pool, students at the doctoral,

graduate and undergraduate lev
els presented their research to a
group of 30 industry leaders con
sisting of venture capitalists and
founders of leading engineering
and technology companies. Stu
dent research and product design
were assessed on the basis of inno
vation and product potential.
"I was very struck from the list
of abstracts," said Shankar Sastry,
adviser to VERTEX and chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci
ence at UC-Berkeley. "We were

were primarily focused on hard
ware and devices, manufacturing
and processes, software and infor

neering fields.
Pedram Keyani, a graduate stu
dent in computer science at Stan
ford, showcased what can poten

tially make peer-to-peer file sys
tems like Gnutella and iMesh
more robust from attack by hack
ers.
"If a small percentage of highly
connected nodes fail, the whole
system fails," Keyani said. He ex
plained how his software, coupled
with the appropriate hardware,
detects attacks and recovers from a
failure.
Brian Bircumshaw, a UC-
Berkeley doctoral candidate, pre
sented RBAR, a Micro Electr
o Rf device that may be
a component in the next genera
tion of cell phones.
"With RBAR, power consump
tion is reduced by a factor of 10 to
100 over contemporary wireless
solutions," Bircumshaw said.
"Your favorite wireless [device]
will cost less and last longer."

event. Commonly known as ISIS,
the project promises to bring,
among other services, the capabili
ty fora personalized Web site with
on-campus events and plasma
screens around campus to central
ize information.
"It's hard to find out what's hap
pening on campus . . . fliers can
cover only so much info," said se
nior Scott Cannon, the president of
ISIS. Similar to Amazon, the ISIS
system will notify students of events
in which they are interested.
The lab on a chip is arguably
one of the biggest innovations in
the biotech industry. UC-Berkeley
doctoral candidate Nikolas Chro
nis presented his advances in this
area.
"I'm trying to develop a univer
sal tool for research institutions to

assess how, for instance, how me
chanical forces are translated to
chemical signals," Chronis said. By
having 1,000 labs on a chip, paral
lel processing will greatly reduce
research time and cost, he added.
Martina Gerken, a recent Stan
ford Ph D, presented her work on
thin film gratings. Her invention
resolves light based on different
wavelengths.
"We want a compact, cost-effec
tive prism," she said, adding that
her invention can find application
in a variety of settings, like optical
communications.
I-Challenge came to an end
with the awards ceremony. Awards
were given in three categories —
elegant solution, technical execu
tion and impact.
Kailash Gopalakrishnan, a
Stanford electrical engineering
doctoral candidate, earned first
place in "elegant solution" for his
work on novel semiconductor de
vices for next generation comput

ing.
Stanford electrical engineering
doctoral candidate Frank P. O'Ma
hony won first place in "technical
execution" for his work on stand
ing-wave clock distribution.
Stefan Zimmerman, a UC-
Berkeley graduate student, took
first place in "impact" for his efforts
in developing a microneedle-based
continuous glucose monitor.
In the spirit of the Big Game's
Axe, a coaxial cable in a dish,
dubbed Coax, was given to the
school that had accrued the most
number of individual awards. At a
narrow margin of 5 to 4, the Coax
went to Stanford.
"It's a tradition that I hope will
become a long-standing one," said
Bruce Wooley, an electrical engi
neering professor at Stanford.
The challenge for the Coax will
continue next year as the innova
tive minds at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley go at it again in I-Chal
lenge 2004.

narrow margin of 5 to 4, the Coax
went to Stanford.
"It's a tradition that I hope will
become a long-standing one," said
Bruce Wooley, an electrical engi
neering professor at Stanford.
The challenge for the Coax will
continue next year as the innova

The "Big Game" of technology
blasted off last Saturday at Arrilla
ga Alumni Center in what can be
best characterized as an intellectu
al quest. The first-ever Innovators'
Challenge showcased engineering
research at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, and this year Stanford
won the competition.
The Business Association of
Stanford Engineering Students,
also known as Bases, and VER
TEX, the engineering entrepre
neurial club at UC-Berkeley, host
ed the event. The competition at
tracted well over 100 individuals
from Stanford and the surround
ing community.
"It's really a tech design con
test," said Nate Ota of VERTEX, a
UC-Berkeley doctoral candidate.
"The goal is to find the best and
brightest that came out."
Competing fora $25,000 prize
pool, students at the doctoral,

graduate and undergraduate lev
els presented their research to a
group of 30 industry leaders con
sisting of venture capitalists and
founders of leading engineering
and technology companies. Stu
dent research and product design
were assessed on the basis of inno
vation and product potential.
"I was very struck from the list
of abstracts," said Shankar Sastry,
adviser to VERTEX and chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci
ence at UC-Berkeley. "We were
blown away by how in the past cou
ple of years the trends [in technol
ogy] have changed so dramatic al

Presentations at I-Challenge
were primarily focused on hard
ware and devices, manufacturing
and processes, software and infor
mation technology and bioengi
neering fields.
Pedram Keyani, a graduate stu
dent in computer science at Stan
ford, showcased what can poten

tially make peer-to-peer file sys
tems like Gnutella and iMesh
more robust from attack by hack
ers.
"If a small percentage of highly
connected nodes fail, the whole
system fails," Keyani said. He ex
plained how his software, coupled
with the appropriate hardware,
detects attacks and recovers from a
failure.
Brian Bircumshaw, a UC-
Berkeley doctoral candidate, pre
sented RBAR, a Micro Electr
o Rf device that may be
a component in the next genera
tion of cell phones.
"With RBAR, power consump
tion is reduced by a factor of 10 to
100 over contemporary wireless
solutions," Bircumshaw said.
"Your favorite wireless [device]
will cost less and last longer."

event. Commonly known as ISIS,
the project promises to bring,
among other services, the capabili
ty fora personalized Web site with
on-campus events and plasma
screens around campus to central
ize information.
"It's hard to find out what's hap
pening on campus . . . fliers can
cover only so much info," said se
nior Scott Cannon, the president of
ISIS. Similar to Amazon, the ISIS
system will notify students of events
in which they are interested.
The lab on a chip is arguably
one of the biggest innovations in
the biotech industry. UC-Berkeley
doctoral candidate Nikolas Chro
nis presented his advances in this
area.
"I'm trying to develop a univer
sal tool for research institutions to

assess how, for instance, how me
chanical forces are translated to
chemical signals," Chronis said. By
having 1,000 labs on a chip, paral
lel processing will greatly reduce
research time and cost, he added.
Martina Gerken, a recent Stan
ford Ph D, presented her work on
thin film gratings. Her invention
resolves light based on different
wavelengths.
"We want a compact, cost-effec
tive prism," she said, adding that
her invention can find application
in a variety of settings, like optical
communications.
I-Challenge came to an end
with the awards ceremony. Awards
were given in three categories —
elegant solution, technical execu
tion and impact.
Kailash Gopalakrishnan, a
Stanford electrical engineering
doctoral candidate, earned first
place in "elegant solution" for his
work on novel semiconductor de
vices for next generation comput

ing.
Stanford electrical engineering
doctoral candidate Frank P. O'Ma
hony won first place in "technical
execution" for his work on stand
ing-wave clock distribution.
Stefan Zimmerman, a UC-
Berkeley graduate student, took
first place in "impact" for his efforts
in developing a microneedle-based
continuous glucose monitor.
In the spirit of the Big Game's
Axe, a coaxial cable in a dish,
dubbed Coax, was given to the
school that had accrued the most
number of individual awards. At a
narrow margin of 5 to 4, the Coax
went to Stanford.
"It's a tradition that I hope will
become a long-standing one," said
Bruce Wooley, an electrical engi
neering professor at Stanford.
The challenge for the Coax will
continue next year as the innova
tive minds at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley go at it again in I-Chal
lenge 2004.
