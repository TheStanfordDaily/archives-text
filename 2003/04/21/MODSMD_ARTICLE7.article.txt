# Professors show they do more than research
## Computer nerds can be buff, too 
### JESSICA WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Computer science professors
often pride themselves on their
programming skills, debugging
abilities and the number of start
ups they've created. However, at
Stanford there are not one, but
two computer science professors
who can claim something else —
they can bench press more than
their own body weight.
Professors Ron Fedkiw and
Dawson Engler defy geeky
stereotypes often associated with
the computer world, both having
won weightlifting titles earlier in
their lives.
Fedkiw's career began in his
early teens after he contracted
mono and spent a month in the hos
pital.
"The week afterwards I almost
lost in arm wrestling to another
kid in my class. So I started seri
ously lifting weights to recover,"
Fedkiw said. "I kept doing it
through high school to get
stronger for wrestling and then
continued lifting in college for the
sake of power lifting itself."
Engler started lifting weights
when he was 14, when his mother
dropped him off at the gym in
order to get him out of the house.
"The only thing I knew how to
do was bicep curls," Engler re
called. "After an hour of that I was
ready to go back home and
couldn't move fora week. She
liked having me quiet and well
behaved so she started dropping
me off at the gym more often."
Eventually, the time at the gym
paid off for the two young men in
weightlifting competitions. Engler
placed second in a Junior California
Drug-free Competition in the 1980s.
"Ron is the world-level competi
tor; I was strictly minor league,"
Engler said about his colleague.
Fedkiw won various state cham

pionships in both New York and
California, even setting some state
records before competing at na
tionals. Unfortunately, it was both
his first and last time competing.
"The guy before me broke his
leg; I didn't stay warmed up, and
got injured," Fedkiw said. "Too
bad, because based on my recent
performances, I probably would
have won."
At a body weight of 198
pounds, Fedkiw was bench press
ing about 530 pounds in competi
tions and 555 pounds in the gym
— when the current world
record was 563 pounds.
"But even a few pounds are
tough at that level," Fedkiw
noted. "I used to train at Gold's
Gym in Venice with all the pro
bodybuilders. One of my training
partners Michael O'Hearn had
more covers of Muscle and Fit
ness than anyone else. I was in
this magazine once or twice, and a
few others here and there, but
never got huge publicity. They
made an 'Insane' bench press
video of me once."
Though going from profession
al weightlifting to teaching com
puter science is unconventional,
Fedkiw made this seemingly un
likely transition after his injury.
"The funny thing was that I
never even wanted to be a profes
sor until after getting my Ph.l).
and getting injured at nationals,"
Fedkiw said.
After completing a Ph.D. in
mathematics at UCLA, he did
post-doctorate work in mathe
matics and aeronautics at UCLA
and California Institute of Tech
nology. He then began looking
for jobs in mathematics, mechan
ical engineering and computer
science departments.
Fedkiw recalled that when he
met faculty of the Computer Sci
ence Department at Stanford, he
was "singularly impressed with

their intellectual depth and it
seemed the logical choice" for him
to hop on board.
"I used to study a little just so I
would have something to do if I
ever got injured — good thing 1
did," Fedkiw said.
Engler's path to becoming a
computer science professor was
"pretty deterministic."
"When I was a senior I got ob
sessed with CS research. I had hated
both computers and classes until
then," Engler said. "To keep doing
research 1 had to go to grad school.
And in order to keep doing it after
grad school the best thing to do was
become a professor, so I did that."
When he first started working at

Stanford, many of the professors in
his department did not realize they
were colleagues, more than once
asking him "Who do you work for?"
Engler said, "Depending on
the setting, if I tell people I'm a
professor they think I'm lying.
When I started at Stanford that
was the main reason I had busi
ness cards made, though they
come in handy for other things."
Engler and Fedkiw share
something else in common: both
were bouncers in clubs.
"I paid my undergraduate tu
ition that way for the last two years.
Though Ron [Fedkiw] worked in a

tough New York bar and I was in a
pretty mellow reggae [and] blues
place in Arizona," Kngler said.
Students of the two professors
are often shocked to find out
about their weightlifting past. En
gler said many of his students
have told him, "You look a lot big
ger in your picture."
Fedkiw commented that, "Gradu
ate students seemed amused by it. I
just returned from a joint Applied
Math and CS talk 1 gave at Brown and
some students wanted to roll in some
weights and see what I could do."
Recently, his time has been
spent helping his wife with their
new baby. These days, his
weightlifting consists of "mostly
textbooks, whiteboard markers
and diapers."
