Is there extraterrestrial life?
Professor Christopher Chyba, associate professor in the Depart
ment of Geological and Environmental Sciences and co-director of
CISAC, will give a talk titled "The 21st-century Search for Extrater
restrial Life."
The talk will focus on the study of astrobiology, which is the study of
the origin, evolution, distribution and destiny of life in the universe.
"Whether there is other life is one of the great scientific questions,"
Chyba said. "We are systematically marching through the thousand
nearest sun-like stars looking for artificial signals. We're more than
halfway through that search."
He added that there are a couple hundred billion stars in the Milky
Way. He says the study will not be successful unless "the galaxy is replete
with extraterrestrial technical civilizations who are broadcasting."
The talk will be at 7:30 p.m. tonight in Braun Auditorium of the
Mudd Chemistry Building.
Spring 'Student Night' at Cantor Arts Center

fora fun and open night," said coordinator Geoff Shamos. "We hope
people will take this opportunity to check out the museum and our pro
gram."
Art History graduate student Hilary Snow will present a Spotlight
Gallery Talk, the band North of Cuba will perform at 6:30 p.m. and
at 7:30 p.m., all 15 student guides will be available to offer gallery
tours.
"We are very proud of our student guides and the hard work they
have done this year," said museum public relations aid and sophomore
Elizabeth Ayala. "This night is a chance for students to come to the mu
seum and have some of their own peers speak to them about the muse
um."
The Student Night is free and open to all Stanford students. Light re
freshments and drinks will be provided.
Commemoration day for the Armenian Genocide
April 24 is the official commemoration day for the Armenian Geno
cide. Commemorating the Genocide this year, Professor Vahakn N.
Hadrian, the director of the Genocide research at the Zoryan Institute,
will give two lectures.
The Genocide took place from 1915 to 1922 and more than 1.5 mil
lion Armenians were killed.
"Few people today are aware of this event, and some deny its very ex
istence," said organizers. The talk, titled "The Armenian Genocide in the
Context of Compelling Evidence," is organized by the Stanford Armen
ian Student Association and co-sponsored by the Stanford International
Society.
The first lecture will take place at 1 p.m. in room 2808 of the Law
School and will concentrate on international law. The second lecture will
take place at 7 p.m. in building 200, room 203 and will place the Ar
menian Genocide in a historical context.
