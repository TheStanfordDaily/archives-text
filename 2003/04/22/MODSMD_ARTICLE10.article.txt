WASHINGTON (AP) — The
maker of a morning-after pill ap
plied for government permission
yesterday to begin selling the
emergency contraceptive without
the doctor's prescription now re
quired.
The maker of Plan B pills hopes
to win Food and Drug Administra
tion approval for over-the-counter
sales by next year.
Dozens of medical and women's

groups petitioned the FDA two
years ago to allow the pills to be
sold without a prescription as a
way to help women prevent preg
nancy following rape, contracep
tive failure or just forgetting birth
control.
The FDA typically won't move a
drug from prescription to nonpre
scription status unless the manu
facturer makes the request. Yes
terday, Plan B's maker, Women's

Capitol Corp., said it had.
The morning-after pill can pre
vent ovulation or fertilization
when taken within 72 hours of un
protected sex. The pills won't
work if the woman already is preg
nant.
A completely different pill, RU
-486, can cause an abortion if taken
in early pregnancy. Abortion foes
have been less vocal on morning
after pills.

Morning-after pills already are
sold without a prescription in
Britain and several European
countries.
They also are available without
a prescription through a network
of pharmacists in Alaska, Califor
nia and Washington state.
Two brands of morning-after
pills, Plan Band Preven, have
been sold in the United States by
prescription since 1998.
