MODESTO, Calif. (AP) —
Scott Peterson pleaded inno
cent yesterday in the deaths of
his pregnant wife and unborn
son as the district attorney filed
murder charges and said he
would probably seek the death
penalty.
"I am not guilty," a clean
shaven Peterson said during a
brief arraignment in Stanislaus
County Superior Court.
Prosecutors filed the murder
charges hours before Peterson,
30, appeared in the Modesto
courtroom. In the filing, District
Attorney James Brazelton said
Peterson acted "intentionally,
deliberately and with premedita
tion" in killing 27-year-old Laci
Peterson and Conner Peterson,
the couple's unborn child.
Their bodies washed ashore
last week about three miles from
where Peterson said he was fish
ing in the San Francisco Bay

when his wife — who was eight
months pregnant — vanished
just before Christmas.
"They could no longer wait to
be found so last week they came
back to us," Laci Peterson's
mother, Sharon Rocha, said in an
emotional news conference after
the arraignment. "They didn't
deserve to be dumped in the bay
and sent to a watery grave."
Rocha said her son-in-law
called her the night before
Christmas with the news that
Laci was missing.
"I heard the devastating
words that would forever
change my life: 'Laci's missing,'"
Rocha said. "My whole world
collapsed around me."
The charges against Peter
son include the special circum
stance that he committed more
than one murder, allowing the
district attorney to seek the
death penalty.
