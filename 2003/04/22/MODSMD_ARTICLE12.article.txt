## The
						Stanford Daily Elections need review, reform 
### 
Editorial

The ASSU will soon decide if the
technical errors of its recent
election warrant a re-vote of the
senior class presidential race.
After dealing with the problem at hand,
the ASSU must seek long-term solutions
to such problems in order to prevent
their reoccurrence next year.
According to reports in The Daily, the
ASSU's online voting system was riddled
with errors. Problems included current
seniors' being able to vote for any class's
presidential slate, while current ju
niors — at times — could not vote at all
for next year's senior class presidents.
Now that the elections are over, some stu
dents remain confused about other de
tails, including whether undergraduates
were supposed to vote for Graduate Stu
dent Council candidates.
Some students complained about pre
election problems as well. These complaints
mainly had to do with a lack of sufficient
time given to students to familiarize them
selves about the candidates of the election.
Details about the voting process, the candi
dates and the ballots were available on the
ASSU's Web site only a day before the elec

tion, making it difficult for voters to educate
themselves about the slates and issues.
Overall, the ASSU election lacked pro
fessionalism. Had the ASSU planned suf
ficiently in advance — for example, had it
tested the elections software with enough
time to fix potential problems and had it
tested the steps of the voting process —
then most of this election's errors could
have been avoided.
I'his is not to suggest that technical mis
takes should never happen, because in
any new voting process there are bound
to be some glitches. But it is reasonable to
expect that the errors should not occur
because of poor preparation or because
the voting procedures were not well
thought-out. Despite these problems, a
re-vote is not the way to make up for an
election marred by technical problems.
There is no guarantee that the ASSU
would have better software this time. The
best the ASSU can do is make sure that
next year's election runs smoothly.
It is in every voter's interest to have
elections be as structurally competent and
as fair as possible. Providing this is the
ASSU's responsibility.
