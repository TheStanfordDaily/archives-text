# Celebrating Earth Day

It'd be a shame for the human race
to die out because it irreplaceably
ravaged the world in which it lives,
and it'd be a shame for the human
race to end because of its own laziness.
Luckily, we have found ways to slow the
rapid rate at which we consume the
world's resources — reducing the use of
products, reusing resources and recycling
are some of these ways. But if we are too
lazy to utilize these methods on a consis
tent basis, then there is no hope for slow
ing our own extinction.
lake a look around your environment.
Do you feel like humans have a good rela
tionship with the Earth? No one can ques
tion that here on campus many of us love
to be outdoors, and our recycling pro
gram rivals that of many communities'.
The Stanford Community Farm uses
campus compost. And many of our lights
turn off by automatic sensor. But we waste
more than our fair share of electricity and
water. Plenty of students litter, and many
don't recycle. When it comes to relating to
the Earth, Stanford has no moral high
ground on which to stand.
Today is the United States' 23rd official
Earth Day, a holiday first established as a
common day on which all Americans

could voice their concerns about environ
mental degradation. While its first obser
vance began in the name of grassroots po
litical organizing, Earth Day is also an use
ful excuse to just appreciate your environ
ment. All you have to do is consider your
environment in ways you normally don't.
Recycle your newspapers and old notes.
Turn off the lights when you leave any
room. Every day, each of us chooses be
tween being lazy and using resources effi
ciently.
Although the common Earth Day mes
sage is to reduce, reuse and recycle, it
doesn't have to be the only one. We can
also think about redefining the human-
Earth relationship. What if we tried to
maximize the benefit to our environment
instead of minimizing harm? Would we be
able to give back to the Earth as well as
take from it? For example, could we ever
make the air that goes into our vehicles
come out cleaner than when it entered?
Could the concept of composted food
waste as a soil fertilizer be applied to more
of the waste that we create? Maybe one
day we'll figure out how to live and pro
duce in the world and impact it positively
in the process. That would be successful
symbiosis.
