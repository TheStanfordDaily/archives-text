# LYING IN THE GRASS
## A 						cardinal regret? 
### 
It's sad but true: happiness,
during my teenage years,
was defined by academic
success. So I felt an incredi
ble sense of validation when I re
ceived my Stanford admission
packet in the mail. There would be
no regretting all the times I put my
GPA above my friends or memo
rized SAT words on a Friday night.
I had made it.
The summer after high school,
I whittled the time away idealizing
Stanford to holy heaven. There
were 900 pages-worth of classes to
ponder, an endless number of
programs and services to explore.
I thought I would regularly exer
cise next to Olympic athletes and
visit San Francisco every couple of
weeks. Surrounded by a phalanx
of incredible peers and world-class
professors, my mind would under
go an intellectual renaissance.
My perceptions of Stanford
were no different from a visitor's. I
envisioned that on a clear, lazy
Sunday afternoon, I would stroll
down Palm Drive and see volleyball
players frolicking on the green,
green grass. Along Serra Mall I'd
gaze up at hundred million dollar
monoliths with names like Gates
and Packard rising to meet the
open sky. Picturesque yet modern,
Stanford would be a Utopian center
for intellectual vitality.
Fast-forward a couple of years.
Under the relentless pace of the
quarter system, the brief euphoria
of a task well done is overshad
owed by the buckling weight of pa
pers and reading. Any free time is
spent saturating my blood with
caffeine in preparation for exami
nations. And as the weeks go by,
my memory becomes an amor
phous blur, an academic Ground
hog's Day of perpetuity. As for
traveling, it would make no differ
ence if the city were a little ways up
interstate 280 or smack-dab in the
middle of Kansas — my world was
cordoned off by the proverbial

Bubble long ago.
The drive to achieve keeps me
chained to my desk. Even when my
dormmates are laughing and
shouting outside, and I honestly
want to partake in their revelry, I
ultimately conclude that any sacri
fice of the present is worth it fora
brighter future. But sometimes
without warning, the 112 uture smacks

me in the face as it
inexplicably meta
morphoses into
the present. At
moments like
these, I sit back
and reflect, and a
seething pes
simism surges
through my veins

as I come to the stark realization
that my transcript — a single sheet
of paper, listing no more informa
tion than my classes and grades —
most accurately sums up my history
at Stanford.
So not much has changed since
high school. Academic achieve
ment is still dictating how I live out
each day.
I realized my idyllic representa
tions of Stanford would inevitably
be tainted with reality, but never to
this degree. This college experi
ence I could've lived out anywhere
else, without my parents having to
foot a thirty-grand bill every year.
If the fat envelope hadn't arrived
that April afternoon, I would've
gone to Cal. Sometimes I wish I
had. Its campus has an urban
edge, and the food's actually de
cent at night. Most importantly,
I'd at least be doing better than the
mean. But there's no point in play
ing this game of ifs and maybes. As
a junior, I'm too old to pack my
bags and transfer. My Stanford de
gree will be noted on my obituary.
Sometimes it feels like there are
only a lonely few others who ques
tion their decisions to come to
Stanford. Outside section, we like
to showcase our easy, even unin

telligent, nature with one another.
Of course 1 didn't study that much.
Because I was partying over the
weekend, of course I bombed the
test. Kant? He's a misspelled nega
tive contraction. Yes, there's no
questioning my perfect life — es
pecially my choice of a college.
I'm fully aware that the blame
for this mess falls squarely on the
conscientious decisions I've made
in the past and continue to make
everyday. I chose to come to Stan
ford, and I choose to mark my cal
endar around term papers and
tests. But I can also choose to get a
life and thoroughly enjoy my Stan
ford experience. I need to stay up
all night chatting with all the
novel-writers and aspiring politi
cians and budding scientists, to
contemplate their unique perspec
tives before we go our separate
ways. I want to have a romantic
picnic on the Oval, and go stargaz
ing up at the Dish. I want to show
up at a rave and get raving drunk,
if only to say that I've done so.
I've made this solemn promise
to change before — at the end of
high school and also in the sum
mers after my freshman and
sophomore years. Will I cheat my
self again? My grandmother just
turned 80, and she is now visceral
ly aware of her own mortality. She
whispers to me her deepest regret:
that when she was young and ener
getic, she did not allow herself to
experience the boundless freedom
that accompanies such youth. One
day I will be an old man, and my
collective past will be nothing more
than a scrapbook of memories. I
fear that the photo albums will be
empty, and that the only thing I'll
be able to recall will be my dormi
tory room and a large pile of books.
So what is the essence of Stan
ford? Right now I don't know, but
I'll be able to tell you after I spend
my last year truly living it up.
