Ethnic theme houses not to be blamed
for 'natural adolescent tendency to
ding to the familiar'
Uri Pomerantz's column on ethnic
theme houses was grossly uninformed. He
seems not to realize that ethnic theme
dorms only contain 50 percent of students
of that ethnicity. There are many things
wrong with the ethnic communities at
Stanford. As an African-American student
labeled an "incog" for not attending every
black event held on campus, I understand
how white students can feel excluded by
the presence of these theme houses. But
for some students, living with or associat
ing with others of the same ethnic back
ground is necessary to their personal hap
piness.
During every meal in my dining hall —
which includes no theme houses — stu
dents of ethnic-minority groups have laid
claim to their own individual tables. It is
unfair for Pomerantz to blame theme
houses for the very natural adolescent ten
dency to cling to the familiar. If he does
not want to be involved in theme dorms,
he shouldn't be. I won't either. But far be

it for me to condemn or judge anyone who
thinks that Okada, Casa Zapata, Muwek
ma or Ujamaa are the places that they
would feel most comfortable.

Diversity among 'backgrounds, view
points, geograpnic origin and religion'
exist in ethnic theme houses
As a past and current resident of a
theme house, I was troubled by four points
in Uri Pomerantz's column, "Voluntary
Segregation (April 17).
First, Pomerantz misrepresents theme
houses as segregationist. In reality, theme
houses have, on average, no more than 50
percent of its population composed of the
ethnic minority represented by its theme.
As a result, theme houses are some of the
most diverse dorms on campus. Further
more, most freshmen who are placed into
these houses do not have roommates of
the same ethnicity. In fact, I imagine that
these houses are officially called "Cross
cultural I heme Houses" by Res Ed be
cause of these reasons. Stories like an Is
raeli meeting a Palestinian and becoming
best friends with him can easily take place
in theme houses at Stanford.

Second, Pomerantz's column implies
that there is no diversity within an ethnic
minority community and, hence, within an
ethnic theme house. Putting aside the first
concern I voiced above, I find it troubling
that Pomerantz believed that, amongst a
group of people of the same color, there
would be no diversity among backgrounds,
viewpoints, geographic origin and religion.
That is certainly not the case. Whether you
are looking at Ujarnaa, Zapata, Okada or
Muwekma, all of them encompass a wide
spectrum of different cultures under one
roof—and this refers to the 50 percent
who fall under the enormous umbrellas of
black, Latino / Chicano, Asian or Native
American peoples in the theme houses.
There are hundreds of different cultures,
languages, backgrounds and histories asso
ciated with subgroups of these umbrella
classifications — and even more diversity
amongst the amazing, different individuals
that hail from those backgrounds. Again,
this does not even include the entirely dif
ferent spectrum of diversity introduced by
the group of residents in theme dorms who
do not fall under the ethnic category of a
cross-cultural theme house.
Third, Pomerantz's column completely
ignores one of the most important missions
of these theme houses: to educate its diverse
group of residents on the c ulture, cultural

diversity, histories and backgrounds of the
ethnic-minority group represented by its
theme. Ujamaa, in particular, hosts numer
ous events that are geared specifically to
ward educating people about black culture
and history — as well as a number of com
parative studies programs that focus on in
teractions between cultures. Pomerantz
wrote in his column that he agreed with the
student who said that "... education also
occurs outside of the classroom and racial
diversity is important to help in this educa
tion." Why was it not mentioned in his col
umn that one of the main purposes of theme
dorms is to do just this?
Finally, Pomerantz's column suffers
from a horrendous lack of research — or
perhaps merely a silencing of the facts and
conflicting opinions — about ethnic
theme dorms at Stanford. People who
know the facts about theme dorms have a
valid reason to be upset by his column be
cause of its distorted image our campus's
theme houses. Students on campus are as
likely to encounter the alien mentioned in
Pomerantz's column as they are to en
counter the "segregated" theme dorms
described in your article.

U.S. News & World Report rankings
are not wholly reflective of GSB
I read the editorial, "Valuing the rank
ings" (April 15) with some dismay. It seems
that the Daily's editorial board — or Stan
ford in general — believes that only one
set of rankings for business schools exist.
Unfortunately for the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, there are a number of
reputable sources other than U.S. News &
World Report that do not consider the
Business School to be first or second in
rank.
It would be fair to assess the state of the
Business School based on a more repre
sentative set of rankings, such as those of
the Wall Street Journal, Business Week,
The Financial Times, The Economist and
Forbes, in addition to the U.S. News &
World Report.
