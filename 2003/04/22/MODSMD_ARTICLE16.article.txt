# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Under Bush administration, ROTC is not admirable program 
### JOHN MARTIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
This column is in response to The
Daily's article, "ROIC readies military
leaders" (April 14). I think that defending
one's country is an honorable and even
noble cause when the leaders of one's
country are rational and focused on peace
and national security. But the Bush ad
ministration is both irrational and bent on
world domination, using the excuse of
Sept. 11 and the existence of admittedly
bad foreign leaders to implement its plans
for world domination, expansion of Amer
ican multi-national corporations and re
striction of civil rights.
The war on Iraq was, technically, a
"preventive war," which is an illegal act
under international law, according to such
experts as University of Chicago Political
Science Prof. John Mearsheimer. Further,
it was opposed by a majority of people in
virtually every country on this planet.
Even in those countries whose govern
ment supported the war — such as Great
Britain, Spain and Italy — the people
clearly opposed it.
As should be clear from the results of
the war, Iraq under Saddam Hussein
posed no real threat to the United States
and its neighbors. It did not use weapons
of mass destruction, nor did the "elite" Re
publican Guard put up much of a light.
Notice also that the U.S. military, after
capturing Baghdad, did not protect hospi
tals so that the injured could be cared for,

did not protect the mosques so that the re
ligious beliefs of the people could be re
spected, did not protect the museums so
that the national treasures of this ancient
land could be protected and did not pro
tect schools so that children could resume
their education.
The U.S. military primarily protected
the oil fields and the Ministry of Oil be
cause this war was mostly about oil and
killing Hussein. Robert Fisk, an "unem
bedded" reporter for The Independent of
London reported that he counted 35 min
istries that had been torched. The benefi
ciaries of this destruction will be American
firms such as Halliburton (formerly head
ed by Vice President Dick Cheney) and
Bechtel (former Republican Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Schultz
serves on its board). Both of these compa
nies have been substantial contributors to
the Republican Party. Also consider this
statistic: Bush's proposed tax cut will add
to the wealth of the rich. For example, the
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in
dicates that the richest 1 percent of the
population will receive 36 percent of the
total benefits, while the poorest 40 percent
will get only 4 percent.
I think the Bush administration is com
posed of evangelical Christian fundamen
talists (Bush and John Ashcroft for two),
orthodox Jewish conservatives and secular
neo-conservatives who have spelled out
their agenda for world domination in a
clear and unambiguous fashion. Read, for
example, the "Project fora New American

Century" or the paper by Paul Wolfowitz
that spells out the doctrine of preventive
wars and the universality of American val
ues. As someone who lived overseas for 12
years, I can state emphatically that Ameri
can values are not universal.
One should also check out The Domes
tic Security Enhancement Act 0f2003, also
known as Patriot 11. This act is so scary that
a member of the Justice Department was
sufficiently alarmed by it that he / she
leaked it to the press. These views are pro
foundly un-American and may truly be la
beled as fascist. Bush's religious extrem
ism was shown clearly by his call fora "cru
sade" immediately following Sept. 11, by
his "axis of evil" comment and constant
references to evil, by his "you are either
with us or the terrorists" mentality and by
his "I am the instrument of God" com
ment just prior to the start of the war on
Iraq. The March 10 issue of Newsweek
magazine has a number of articles on the
influence of religion on Bush. This is a
man who led an irresponsible life until
past the age of 40 (for example, he was ar
rested three times, including for drunk
driving) and then was "reborn" and came
to see himself as an American Joan of Arc,
"destined" to lead America to victory
through the force of arms. This war has
been condemned by religious people of all
faiths from Pope Paul II to the minister of
Bush's own church.
I would also point out to Bobby Crotty,
who is quoted in the April 14 article, that
the "fun challenges" he talks about involve

killing innocent women and children and
that the "unique leadership training" is in
asymmetrical warfare which basically in
volves sneaking into a country and killing
people while they are sleeping.
The "smart" bombs that the govern
ment boasts of are not that smart. Read
Fisk's reports on the war to get a true pic
ture of the impact of these weapons. I
would also suggest to Justin Biolo, who is
also quoted in the article, that while it is
true that "every sailor, soldier, airman and
officer is also someone's friend, brother,
mother or daughter," the same was true of
the Nazi military personnel who murdered
6 million Jews, the same is true of Osama
bin Laden and the men who llew the
planes on Sept. 11, the same is true of Hus
sein and the same is true of Bush. What re
ally counts is the quality of your character,
not who your friends and family are.
I would also suggest that one study the
Cuban Missile crisis. The result of that
confrontation was an understanding be
tween U.S. President John F. Kennedy
and Soviet Premier Nikita Sergeyevich
Khrushchev that there must be another
choice in a disagreement besides the alter
natives of humiliation and war. But the
members of the Bush administration do
not understand that basic reality. They are
caught up in their religious fervor and by
the arrogance of power into thinking that
they can force the rest of the world to ac
cede to their world view — or kill them
trying. They are wrong. The world will
unite against the United States and we will

become further isolated and subject to
more attacks culminating in a nuclear war.
To all those in ROTC there is one hon
orable course of action. In Israel, a num
ber of Israeli soldiers have adopted the
practice of "selective refusal." They are
willing to serve their country in the legiti
mate defense of the State of Israel within
its borders, but they refuse to go into the
West Bank or Gaza Strip to terrorize and
kill Palestinians. I would suggest that the
Stanford ROTC students consider adopt
ing a similar position. I should warn you
that the likely result would be a court mar
tial and imprisonment, as has been the
case for the Israeli soldiers. This position is
quite different from being a conscientious
objector who opposes war in general. Jus
tifying a conscientious objector position
would be hard in any case for members of
a voluntary military. There is a benefit to
selective refusal — you will be able to live
with yourself for the rest of your life.
I do not mean to imply that the 30
young people from Stanford currently
serving in the ROTC program are wrong
in some corrupt fashion. I believe that they
joined ROTC with the sincere belief that
they were supporting their country. But
they — and all Stanford students —
should make a concerted effort to under
stand the kind of people currently in
power in this country. Their futures and
the future of this country depends on it.

Bechtel (former Republican Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Schultz
serves on its board). Both of these compa
nies have been substantial contributors to
the Republican Party. Also consider this
statistic: Bush's proposed tax cut will add
to the wealth of the rich. For example, the
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in
dicates that the richest 1 percent of the
population will receive 36 percent of the
total benefits, while the poorest 40 percent
will get only 4 percent.
I think the Bush administration is com
posed of evangelical Christian fundamen
talists (Bush and John Ashcroft for two),
orthodox Jewish conservatives and secular
neo-conservatives who have spelled out
their agenda for world domination in a
clear and unambiguous fashion. Read, for
example, the "Project fora New American

Century" or the paper by Paul Wolfowitz
that spells out the doctrine of preventive
wars and the universality of American val
ues. As someone who lived overseas for 12
years, I can state emphatically that Ameri
can values are not universal.
One should also check out The Domes
tic Security Enhancement Act 0f2003, also
known as Patriot 11. This act is so scary that
a member of the Justice Department was
sufficiently alarmed by it that he / she
leaked it to the press. These views are pro
foundly un-American and may truly be la
beled as fascist. Bush's religious extrem
ism was shown clearly by his call fora "cru
sade" immediately following Sept. 11, by
his "axis of evil" comment and constant
references to evil, by his "you are either
with us or the terrorists" mentality and by
his "I am the instrument of God" com
ment just prior to the start of the war on
Iraq. The March 10 issue of Newsweek
magazine has a number of articles on the
influence of religion on Bush. This is a
man who led an irresponsible life until
past the age of 40 (for example, he was ar
rested three times, including for drunk
driving) and then was "reborn" and came
to see himself as an American Joan of Arc,
"destined" to lead America to victory
through the force of arms. This war has
been condemned by religious people of all
faiths from Pope Paul II to the minister of
Bush's own church.
I would also point out to Bobby Crotty,
who is quoted in the April 14 article, that
the "fun challenges" he talks about involve

killing innocent women and children and
that the "unique leadership training" is in
asymmetrical warfare which basically in
volves sneaking into a country and killing
people while they are sleeping.
The "smart" bombs that the govern
ment boasts of are not that smart. Read
Fisk's reports on the war to get a true pic
ture of the impact of these weapons. I
would also suggest to Justin Biolo, who is
also quoted in the article, that while it is
true that "every sailor, soldier, airman and
officer is also someone's friend, brother,
mother or daughter," the same was true of
the Nazi military personnel who murdered
6 million Jews, the same is true of Osama
bin Laden and the men who llew the
planes on Sept. 11, the same is true of Hus
sein and the same is true of Bush. What re
ally counts is the quality of your character,
not who your friends and family are.
I would also suggest that one study the
Cuban Missile crisis. The result of that
confrontation was an understanding be
tween U.S. President John F. Kennedy
and Soviet Premier Nikita Sergeyevich
Khrushchev that there must be another
choice in a disagreement besides the alter
natives of humiliation and war. But the
members of the Bush administration do
not understand that basic reality. They are
caught up in their religious fervor and by
the arrogance of power into thinking that
they can force the rest of the world to ac
cede to their world view — or kill them
trying. They are wrong. The world will
unite against the United States and we will

become further isolated and subject to
more attacks culminating in a nuclear war.
To all those in ROTC there is one hon
orable course of action. In Israel, a num
ber of Israeli soldiers have adopted the
practice of "selective refusal." They are
willing to serve their country in the legiti
mate defense of the State of Israel within
its borders, but they refuse to go into the
West Bank or Gaza Strip to terrorize and
kill Palestinians. I would suggest that the
Stanford ROTC students consider adopt
ing a similar position. I should warn you
that the likely result would be a court mar
tial and imprisonment, as has been the
case for the Israeli soldiers. This position is
quite different from being a conscientious
objector who opposes war in general. Jus
tifying a conscientious objector position
would be hard in any case for members of
a voluntary military. There is a benefit to
selective refusal — you will be able to live
with yourself for the rest of your life.
I do not mean to imply that the 30
young people from Stanford currently
serving in the ROTC program are wrong
in some corrupt fashion. I believe that they
joined ROTC with the sincere belief that
they were supporting their country. But
they — and all Stanford students —
should make a concerted effort to under
stand the kind of people currently in
power in this country. Their futures and
the future of this country depends on it.

This column is in response to The
Daily's article, "ROIC readies military
leaders" (April 14). I think that defending
one's country is an honorable and even
noble cause when the leaders of one's
country are rational and focused on peace
and national security. But the Bush ad
ministration is both irrational and bent on
world domination, using the excuse of
Sept. 11 and the existence of admittedly
bad foreign leaders to implement its plans
for world domination, expansion of Amer
ican multi-national corporations and re
striction of civil rights.
The war on Iraq was, technically, a
"preventive war," which is an illegal act
under international law, according to such
experts as University of Chicago Political
Science Prof. John Mearsheimer. Further,
it was opposed by a majority of people in
virtually every country on this planet.
Even in those countries whose govern
ment supported the war — such as Great
Britain, Spain and Italy — the people
clearly opposed it.
As should be clear from the results of
the war, Iraq under Saddam Hussein
posed no real threat to the United States
and its neighbors. It did not use weapons
of mass destruction, nor did the "elite" Re
publican Guard put up much of a light.
Notice also that the U.S. military, after
capturing Baghdad, did not protect hospi
tals so that the injured could be cared for,

did not protect the mosques so that the re
ligious beliefs of the people could be re
spected, did not protect the museums so
that the national treasures of this ancient
land could be protected and did not pro
tect schools so that children could resume
their education.
The U.S. military primarily protected
the oil fields and the Ministry of Oil be
cause this war was mostly about oil and
killing Hussein. Robert Fisk, an "unem
bedded" reporter for The Independent of
London reported that he counted 35 min
istries that had been torched. The benefi
ciaries of this destruction will be American
firms such as Halliburton (formerly head
ed by Vice President Dick Cheney) and
Bechtel (former Republican Secretary of
State and Hoover Fellow George Schultz
serves on its board). Both of these compa
nies have been substantial contributors to
the Republican Party. Also consider this
