## Stanford's rock in left field 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the last four years one thing has
remained strong and consistent for the
No. 15 Stanford softball team â€” senior
left fielder Cassi Brangham.
Brangham is the only member of the
Cardinal squad that has started in the
same spot from the first contest of her
freshman year to the doubleheader she
will star in tonight at the eve of her senior
campaign.
The four-year starter did not always
find herself in left field. In fact, Brang
ham, who hails from Clovis, Calif., never
played in the outfield before arriving on
the Farm.
The natural left-hander was a first
baseman for both Clovis High School
and one of the best travel teams in the na
tion, the Fresno Force. Brangham ar
rived on the Farm having been named a
first-team Ail-American NFCA First base
man and a two-time West Regional All-
American.
Consistency has always been the lefty's

trademark, as she reached base in 38 of
39 games as a high school senior and bat
ted .406 for her team.
Beyond excellence in the field, Brang
ham's batting average was matched with
a grade point average of 3.95 in the class
room.
Since high school, not much has
changed.
The American Studies major was
named an NFCA All-American Scholar-
Athlete and Second Team Academic All-
Pac-10 selection in her junior season at
Stanford.
But, honors and statistics cannot ex
press the magnitude of Brangham's con
tributions to Stanford softball.
As a freshman, she started next to Na
tional Team member and four-time first
team Ail-American Jessica Mendoza.
Now, Brangham is the senior in the
outfield and is passing along her experi
ence of the last three and a half years to
first-time starters freshman center fielder
Catalina Morris and sophomore right
fielder Meghan Sickler.
"It has been like a role reversal,"

Brangham said. "I was the new person
on the team and had never played in the
outfield. And now, it has been a really
neat experience to play alongside
younger players. I know the players in
the Pac-10 and their tendencies and I can
pass that along."
Brangham's leadership in the field is
one of seniority and stability.
"There is no doubt in my mind when
the ball is hit to left field she is going to
catch it," senior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"And as a pitcher it is so important to
have that kind of confidence in your de
fense."
And, Nyberg should be confident in
Brangham's skills, as the left fielder has
made just seven errors in the 245 games
of her Stanford career.
As knowledgeable, static and depend
able as Brangham has been in the field,
her spot in the lineup has jumped quite a
bit since freshman year.
Her growth as a player at the plate has
reached a climax in her senior campaign.
