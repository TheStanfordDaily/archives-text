## Stanford's rock in left field 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the last four years one thing has
remained strong and consistent for the
No. 15 Stanford softball team â€” senior
left fielder Cassi Brangham.
Brangham is the only member of the
Cardinal squad that has started in the
same spot from the first contest of her
freshman year to the doubleheader she
will star in tonight at the eve of her senior
campaign.
The four-year starter did not always
find herself in left field. In fact, Brang
ham, who hails from Clovis, Calif., never
played in the outfield before arriving on
the Farm.
The natural left-hander was a first
baseman for both Clovis High School
and one of the best travel teams in the na
tion, the Fresno Force. Brangham ar
rived on the Farm having been named a
first-team Ail-American NFCA First base
man and a two-time West Regional All-
American.
Consistency has always been the lefty's

trademark, as she reached base in 38 of
39 games as a high school senior and bat
ted .406 for her team.
Beyond excellence in the field, Brang
ham's batting average was matched with
a grade point average of 3.95 in the class
room.
Since high school, not much has
changed.
The American Studies major was
named an NFCA All-American Scholar-
Athlete and Second Team Academic All-
Pac-10 selection in her junior season at
Stanford.
But, honors and statistics cannot ex
press the magnitude of Brangham's con
tributions to Stanford softball.
As a freshman, she started next to Na
tional Team member and four-time first
team Ail-American Jessica Mendoza.
Now, Brangham is the senior in the
outfield and is passing along her experi
ence of the last three and a half years to
first-time starters freshman center fielder
Catalina Morris and sophomore right
fielder Meghan Sickler.
"It has been like a role reversal,"

Brangham said. "I was the new person
on the team and had never played in the
outfield. And now, it has been a really
neat experience to play alongside
younger players. I know the players in
the Pac-10 and their tendencies and I can
pass that along."
Brangham's leadership in the field is
one of seniority and stability.
"There is no doubt in my mind when
the ball is hit to left field she is going to
catch it," senior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"And as a pitcher it is so important to
have that kind of confidence in your de
fense."
And, Nyberg should be confident in
Brangham's skills, as the left fielder has
made just seven errors in the 245 games
of her Stanford career.
As knowledgeable, static and depend
able as Brangham has been in the field,
her spot in the lineup has jumped quite a
bit since freshman year.
Her growth as a player at the plate has
reached a climax in her senior campaign.

Senior Cassi Brangham has been strong at bat this year for the Cardinal posting a .285 batting av
erage and is leading the team in RBI with 30.
She batted seventh or eighth at the
beginning of her collegiate career,
but as a senior Brangham's bat
comes third or fourth in the lineup.
"I think that my improvement at
the plate has been a product of ex
perience," Brangham said. "I think
I have just grown as a player and
the way I can help the team."
Brangham is third on the team
in batting average at .285 and leads
the team with 25 bases on balls and
30 RBI.
Perhaps the most telling of these
is her team-leading 30 RBI.
"She is just so clutch," said senior
pitcher Tori Nyljerg. "Such a large
percentage of her hits are when we
need to have a hit. She Ls always the
person who steps up when we need it."
Cassi lias always proven to be a
team player and her timeliness at
the plate with runners in scoring
position reflects her commitment to
Stanford softball's success.
"She is always playing for the

team," Nyberg said. "She is very un
selfish. She is always trying to con
tribute to help us win, that is one of
her best attributes as a player."
As Brangham sees the end of her
time at Stanford upon the horizon,
she recognizes the accomplish
ments of the softball team of which
she has been a member.
"Every time I go out to the field I
am reminded of how far this team has
come," Brangham said. "We have
this beautiful stadium and when I
came there was no stadium. Just to
see dial kind of physical progression
of our program is so fulfilling."
Beyond the construction of a sta
dium, Brangham was part of the
first Stanford softball team to ever
make the Women's College World
Series in 2001.
But, in addition to the record
setting and record breaking, the se
nior also recognizes those results
that will last beyond the end of the
season.
"The four of us seniors have
been really close since we arrived at
Stanford," Brangham said. "They
are friendships that will last a life
time."
