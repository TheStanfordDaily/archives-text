# Fans need to drink their beer in peace

Last week's shocking at
tack against Major
League Umpire Laz
Diaz by a drunken
Chicago White Sox fan rehashed
a dangerous problem in profes
sional sports concerning fan vio
lence. Seeking to "get a rise out of
the crowd," 24-year-old Eric
Dybas leapt onto the field at U.S.
Cellular Field in Chicago and at-

tempted to
tackle Diaz. The
incident comes
after a similar
altercation at
the same stadi
um last season
when a fan at
tacked Royals
third base coach

Tom Gamboa and inflicted him
with minor hearing loss.
Another fan, not surprisingly
at an Oakland game, was arrest
ed on Saturday after hitting
Texas Rangers' outfielder Carl
Everett in the back of the head
with a cell phone flung from the
upper deck.
While none of these incidents
produced any serious injuries to
the parties involved, the phe
nomenon of fan violence re
mains a horrifying thought to
professional athletes, coaches
and officials. The task of com
pletely fortifying an arena
against all the random acts of lu
nacy committed by out-of-con
trol spectators is a difficult and

perhaps impossible task. Those
people who are regularly ex
posed to the whims of distressed
fanatics, therefore, are left to
ponder what will happen in the
event that someone comes charg
ing at them with a knife, as was
the case when Monica Seles was
brutally stabbed in 1993 by an
obsessive Steffi Graf fan.
Unfortunately, for those ath
letes and other participants wor
ried about event safety, banning
of beer sales at athletic events is
slightly less likely than R. Kelly be
coming the next host of Reading
Rainbow. Beer and sports simply
go together. They are like Abbott
and Costello, Sonny and Cher or
NASCAR and mullets. I double
dog dare anyone to go up to Oak
land during a night game and try
peddling a bunch of Snapple or
Orangina and say that it's for the
safety of everyone involved. If
there is such a thing as instant
riot, I'm sure that alcohol would
be an essential ingredient.
So while the fears of inebriat
ed mayhem are unlikely to be as
suaged by banning alcohol sales,
at least the athletes can take so
lace in the fact that these recent
attackers are a big gaggle of
pantywaists compared to Seles'
attacker Guenter Parche. Parche
was a deranged lathe operator (a
lathe operator is a person who
cuts screws into metal. He
