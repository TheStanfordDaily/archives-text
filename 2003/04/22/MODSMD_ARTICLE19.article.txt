# Team falls short in NCAA Championships
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Very few people expected the
Stanford men's gymnastics team to
have a successful season. Losing five
seniors in 2002, including national
team member David Durante, the
Cardinal started the season unable
to field a full lineup on several
events.
"My expectations weren't that
great at the start of the year because
the team was so small," first-year

head coach Thom Glielmi said.
"But they gradually seemed to
enjoy themselves over time."
As a result, the undermanned
squad exploded on the scene for its
first meet this year, beating rival
California for the first time in three
seasons and achieving a No. 4 rank
ing, its highest since the 1996-1997
season.
The meet would be very indica
tive of what was to come this season.
This gym squad was defined by a
team whose top routines were some

of the best in the world, but its lack
of depth gave it a very small margin
of error. The team relied heavily on
its top world-class routines on each
event. With those hit routines, the
team was in contention with just
about any team in the country
But if the top routines missed,
the squad didn't have the "bench"
to make up for those misses. This is
what happened at the NCAA
Championships, where the Cardi
nal placed fourth in the prelimi
nary round, failing to qualify to the

second day of competition.
"It was a little disappointing
where we finished at NCAAs,"
Glielmi said. "Especially consider
ing how well we were doingjust one
week before the championships."
The Cardinal had arrived at the
national championships with a
gymnast ranked in the top-four on
every event and the all-around.
The team had won half of the
events at the MPSF Conference
Championships, stealing several ti
tles from eventual national champi
on Oklahoma. With several con
tending routines, there was even a
realistic chance that Stanford would
walk away with a national title on
every event.
Though the team didn't qualify
to the second day of competition, al
most every team member qualified
as individuals. Senior Marshall
Lrwin and junior Dan Gill also
moved on to event finals on the last
day of competition.
On the final day of competition,
Gill was unable to defend his 2002
NCAA vault title, finishing fourth
on the event to garner his third Ail-
American honor.
Erwin, the 2002 NCAA ring
champion, undefeated all season
on the event, finished in second
place, .012 points behind Penn
State's Kevin Tan.
"Marshall hit a great routine,"
Glielmi said. "I thought it was good
enough to win it."
Glielmi was very happy with his
first season as head coach of Stan
ford men's gymnastics.
"Knowing where the guys were
at the beginning of the season and

where they finished it, this was a
very successful year." Glielmi said.
"The highlight for me was seeing
the seniors really enjoy themselves
again because it seemed like they
had lost some of the passion for the
sport."
Losing seniors Cade Raggio,
Matt McLean, Paul O'Leary and
Erwin, the Cardinal faces another
rebuilding season next year. Gliel
mi is counting on a large recruiting
class to fill some of the void left from
nine graduating seniors in two
years.
"We're going to have a tough
year, but it'll be a great experience
for the incoming freshman," Gliel
mi said. "We have at least four and
possibly seven new gymnasts com
ing in."
The team will take little lime off
as many prepare for offseason
competition. Gill, Erwin and Lang
will all compete for national team
spots during the summer.
