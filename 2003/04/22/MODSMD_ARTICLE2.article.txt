Gail Collins spoke last night about steer
ing one of the most influential editorial
pages in the nation through the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq.
night's lecture, entitled "Opinions
in a Time of War," addressed the role of
newspapers, specifically editors, in sepa
rating opinion from objectivity, especially
in an age of fast Internet news and 24-

opinion of the institution of the newspa

Times, it has real impact," said Commu

the Knight Fellowships Program, in his
introduction of Collins.
Collins took her post as the editorial
page editor in the summer of 2001
after working as both a bi-weekly
columnist and a member of the Times'
editorial board. During her career in
journalism, Collins has written for both
New York Newsday and The New
York Daily News.
The event was sponsored by the John
S. Knight Fellowships Program and held
in Kresge Auditorium.

called attention to the fact that Collins

national voice in many issues. Collins'
speech was partially devoted to dispelling
these rumors and offering her own per

"I had never been an editor before,
and I thought it would be a good time to
enter into the field during a boring peri
od," she said. "But so far we've had ter
rorist attacks, two wars and a space shut
tle crash."
