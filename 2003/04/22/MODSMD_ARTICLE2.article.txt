## Gail Collins opens up about her work after Sept. 11

New York Times Editorial Page Editor
Gail Collins spoke last night about steer
ing one of the most influential editorial
pages in the nation through the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq.
night's lecture, entitled "Opinions
in a Time of War," addressed the role of
newspapers, specifically editors, in sepa
rating opinion from objectivity, especially
in an age of fast Internet news and 24-
hour cable network coverage.
"Editorial pages are meant to give the
opinion of the institution of the newspa
per, and when that paper is the New York

Times, it has real impact," said Commu
nication Prof. James Bettinger, director of
the Knight Fellowships Program, in his
introduction of Collins.
Collins took her post as the editorial
page editor in the summer of 2001
after working as both a bi-weekly
columnist and a member of the Times'
editorial board. During her career in
journalism, Collins has written for both
New York Newsday and The New
York Daily News.
The event was sponsored by the John
S. Knight Fellowships Program and held
in Kresge Auditorium.
In his opening remarks, Bettinger
called attention to the fact that Collins
was appointed to her editorship im
mediately preceding the Sept. 11 ter
rorist attacks and accordingly came
under great pressure to support the

current administration.
With the advent of war in Iraq, Collins
said she confronted similar tension.
Recently, The Times has come under
fire from both political pundits and con
servative journalists who label it a left
leaning publication that fails to reflect the
national voice in many issues. Collins'
speech was partially devoted to dispelling
these rumors and offering her own per
spective on media bias.
"I had never been an editor before,
and I thought it would be a good time to
enter into the field during a boring peri
od," she said. "But so far we've had ter
rorist attacks, two wars and a space shut
tle crash."
Collins spoke briefly on how The
Times' editorial board decides on the

pieces that make it onto the page
each day and how tour staff mem
bers are in charge of sitting
through letters to the editor and
choosing 20 to be printed. She re
marked that in the days following
Sept. 11, The Times received up to
500 letters an hour.
According to Collins, this envi
ronment makes it very difficult to
balance the multitude of viewpoints
without lipping in a single direction.
"It is really important for the
journalistic community to decide
how to separate opinions from
news," she said. "Objective journal
ism is a profession requiring a real
passion for the truth."
Alluding to rapidly shitting stan
dards of news coverage, Collins
made mention of large news cable
networks and the unbounded sup
ply of sources offered by the Inter
net.

"Opinion has become cheaper
than hard news," she said. "Right
now, hard-news channels are com
peting for relatively small audi
ences, and they can only yell louder
in order to survive.
"My prediction is that cable-news
channels will only yell louder until
there is only one, and then they will
all lower their voices and of course
raise their ad rates," she added.
In referring to the Internet as
"one big unedited ops page,"
Collins introduced the sensitive
issue of news advocacy, citing radio
personality Rush Limbaugh as a pri
mary example.
She said, "The news media has
come to include in its ranks advo
cates, especially from the right."
According to Collins, when this
heightened sense of advocacy and
unedited means of expression are
combined, the result is contempo
rary contusion between objectivity
and opinion.
"Objectivity is not a standard â€”
it's a perpetual struggle to do the
right thing," she said. "Sources for

information are so multitudinous
that there is no way to impose quali
ty control."
The vast part of Collins' job at
The Times is to cast a sharp eye on
the quality of the editorial page's
content and to decide which issues
deserve attention over others. This
often means that the decisions of the
editorial board set the political or
subjective tone for the rest of the
paper, which has become increas
ingly analytical.
After her talk, which lasted a half
hour, Collins opened the floor tor
questions, many of which were
aimed at specific Times policies and
practices.
One man from the audience
called attention to what he called
The Times' apparent willingness to
accept the president's agenda at face
value and cited embedded re
porters as an example.
'It's always better to have a re
porter there than not to have a re
porter there," Collins said." I can see
how it would be possible to form a
bond with someone whose job is to

stop bullets from hitting you, but it
was the only way to have someone
there.
"1 think that each of these re
porters saw a tree, and only now are
they going to come together to see if
they can form a forest."
The remainder of Collins' com
ments focused on obstacles she's
faced during the past two years as
well as her personal opinions on
presidential action and even her in
dividual history in the journalism
industry.
This is the 15th year that the
Knight Fellowships Program held
its annual lecture with the help of
the larger Knight Foundation in an
effort to bring celebrated journalists
and authors to campus. Past guests
have included Paul Steiger, manag
ing editor of The Wall Street Jour
nal, and Garry Trudeau, creator of
the Doonesbury comic strip.
The Knight Fellowships Pro
gram promotes active discourse
within the journalism community
on a variety of issues, especially in
light of cuirent affairs.
