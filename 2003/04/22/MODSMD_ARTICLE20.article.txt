# Women stay undefeated in Pac-10
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was clear from the start of this week
end's women's tennis matches at Taube
Family Tennis Center diat nothing could
hinder Stanford's quest for its 16th-straight
Pacific-10 conference championship.

Women's Tennis
Friday: No. 1 Stanford 6, UCLA 1
Saturday: Stanford 5, No. 4 USC 2
at California, Today, 1:30 pm

The No. 1 Cardinal (19-1, 7-0 Pac-10)
ran its winning streak to 17 matches by de
feating conference foes, No. 15 UCLA (13-
10, 4-4 Pac-10) and No. 4 USC (19-5, 5-3
Pac-10), 6-1 and 5-2, respectively. The
team secured its spot one game ahead of
California in the conference race with an
unblemished 7-0 conference record.
In both matches this weekend, the Bru
ins and the Women of Troy were defeated
in similar fashion. Stanford struck early by
capturing the doubles point in both match
es. The Cardinal then held on with over
powering singles play that has been strong
all year long.
The Stanford charge was led by junior
co-captain Emilia Anderson and freshman
Alice Barnes.
Anderson tallied two singles and two
doubles victories and pushed her dual

match singles record to 18-2, including a
perfect 7-0 mark in-conference. In addi
tion, Barnes and her doubles partner,
freshman Amber Liu, improved to 16-2 as
a doubles team in dual matches with two
wins over the weekend.
Barnes added to her impressive run at
the No. 4 singles position by quickly down
ing Laura Gordon, 6-4,6-2, on Friday and
USC's Anita Loyola on Saturday, 6-0,6-3.
After two losses last weekend to the Ari
zona schools at the No. 1 singles position,
Liu, ranked No. 4 in the country, re
bounded nicely with victories over two pre
mier players in the country. The freshman
beat No. 12 Sara Walker of UCLA 3-6, 6-
2, 1-0 (10-8) on Friday before downing
Jewel Peterson of USC, who is No. 5 na
tionally, 6-1, 5-6, 6-4.
Sophomore Story Tweedie-Yates also
posted two strong singles victories and im
proved to 16-3 on the year in dual matches
at the No. 6 singles position.
Junior co-captain Lauren Barnikow
beat Susi Wild of UCLA, 7-5,6-3, but fell to
a strong opponent, No. 30 Luana Magnani
of USC, on Saturday.
At the No. 3 singles position, sopho
more Erin Burdette struggled over the
weekend, dropping matches to Feriel Es
seghir of UCIA and Maureen Dia/ of
USC. The losses are by no means a sign of
trouble for the Cardinal, though, as Bur
dette was previously 16-1 in her singles

matches and, with Barnikow, has an
chored Stanford's doubles lineup through
out the season.
Sitting atop the Pac-10 conference and
one victory away from a regular season
team championship, Stanford now must
set its sights on rival California (19-4, 6-1
Pac-10), the No. 5 team in the nation. The
Bears have been strong of late, also defeat
ing both UCLA and USC over the week
end.
In addition, California is responsible for
the only blemish on the Cardinal's record
— a 4-3 loss at the National Team Indoors
on Feb. 7.
In that loss, the Bears captured the dou
bles point and the No. 1,5 and 6 singles for
the victory. Since then, however, Stanford
has worked relentlessly on doubles and has
only dropped a doubles point once in its 17
matches since the loss.
The Cardinal revenged the loss on
Feb. 22 with a 6-1 win over the Bears at
the Taube Family Tennis Center, but
Tuesday's competition will be held at a
very hostile environment on the Berkeley
Campus.
Nonetheless, the stakes are extremely
high for both teams, as each team will look
to not only capture a league title but defeat
its rival from across the Bay.
Ilie match will be on Tuesday at 1:30 at
the Helltnan Tennis Complex on the
Berkeley campus.

the victory. Since then, however, Stanford
has worked relentlessly on doubles and has
only dropped a doubles point once in its 17
matches since the loss.
The Cardinal revenged the loss on
Feb. 22 with a 6-1 win over the Bears at
the Taube Family Tennis Center, but
Tuesday's competition will be held at a
very hostile environment on the Berkeley
Campus.
Nonetheless, the stakes are extremely
high for both teams, as each team will look
to not only capture a league title but defeat
its rival from across the Bay.
Ilie match will be on Tuesday at 1:30 at
the Helltnan Tennis Complex on the
Berkeley campus.
