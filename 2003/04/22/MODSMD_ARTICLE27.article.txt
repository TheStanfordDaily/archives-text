### FELIPE VALDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There was definitely a sense of
nostalgia in the air on Friday night
at Aver)' Aquatic Center when No. 3

9-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) trounced No. 10 San Jose
State (15-14,3-7) 11-2 and honored
its four seniors.

Friday: No. 3 Stanford 11, No. 10
San Jose State 2

Brenda Villa scored three goals
and fellow senior Julie Gardner
added two to lead the Cardinal in
securing the No. 1 seed for the
MPSF Tournament. Senior goalie
Jackie Frank was also outstanding,
racking up nine saves. Nicole
Huszcz completed the senior dom
ination with a third-period goal.
The offense was out in full force as
eight different players scored for
Stanford.
The Cardinal found its groove
after getting off to a slow start, when
sophomore Hanna Luber put Stan
ford on the board with just three
minutes remaining in the first peri

od. The Cardinal went on a scoring
barrage in the quarter's final min
utes, taking a 4-0 lead.
With a strong defense led by
Frank, the Cardinal held the Spar
tans scoreless in the first three peri
ods.
In the fourth, San Jose finally got
on the board with two goals. But
Villa completed her hat trick and
freshman Lauren Boreta scored as
well to maintain Stanford's nine
point victory.
Coach John Tanner was pleased
with the victory and looks ahead to
this weekend's MPSFTournament,
which will be hosted by Stanford.
"It's what we wanted to accom
plish. We needed to be consistent
throughout the course of the year
in order to have a chance to be the
No. 1 seed," Tanner said.
He added, "We played really
well on defense. To keep them shut
out through three quarters was
something we really had hoped we
might be able to do. We needed to
prevent them from getting us off
balance on defense. We knew we
needed to be alert on defense and
finish our scoring opportunities.
Most of the scoring opportunities in
the first half we put away."

It was a memorable night for
Stanford's four graduating seniors.
"It was a really fun game, since it
was the last home game [of the reg
ular season]," said Villa, who was
celebrating her birthday as well as
senior night. "We executed our
plays and we were all on the same
page, which was very encouraging.
The atmosphere was really enjoy
able."
Villa felt that she connected well
with Gardner in finding the net,
which bodes well for the postsea
son.
"I think that I had a lot of con
nections with Julie in this game.
We've had a connection the last two
years and this year our roles have
changed.
"Today, it was a glimpse of the
connections we had in previous
years... I'm excited. I can't wait to
play next weekend against the top
four schools to keep that connec
tion going."
She seemed pleasantly surprised
when the crowd sang "Happy
Birthday" to her at the half.
"It was really sentimental for me.
It finally hit me that this was our last
home game," Frank said.
"During lineup when [the se
niors] were introduced with our
major, it finally hit me that this was
the last time I'm going to be with
this team. It seems really weird to
me that I am not going to be play
ing in this pool anymore and have
that whole red crowd up in the
stands."
Gardner shared Villa's enthusi
asm.
"It was really fun. My family was
here and a lot of friends were here.
It's so nice to be playing in our offi
cial last game in our home pool. It's
very intense... but it was nice get
ting to come out and see all the
freshmen playing, which is the fu
ture of the program."
Tanner expects stiff competition
from all teams in the MPSF Tour
nament, especially if the Cardinal
were to match up with Long Beach
State in the semifinals. The 49ers
upset them earlier this season.
