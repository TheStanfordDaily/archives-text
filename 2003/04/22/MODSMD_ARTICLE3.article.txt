# Stanford focuses on minority outreach for Admit Weekend
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
The most racially diverse accepted class in
Stanford's history will fl<x:k to campus this
Thursday for Admit Weekend 2003. Ac
cordingly, many of the events planned for
prospective freshmen will reflect the Uni
versity's strong minority outreach effort, in
cluding a wide variety of activities coordinat
ed by ethnic community centers and other
student organizations.
"Everyone is looking to see if they can see
themselves in the Stanford community for
their undergraduate years," said Sarah Ihn,
assistant director at the Asian American Ac
tivities Center, or A3C. "Belonging to an eth
nic community is definitely one of the more
salient communities people identify with."
The night students arrive on campus,
they will have the opportunity to choose
from an array of multicultural events orga
nized through the University's ethnic theme
dorms. From the Ice Cream Dialogues at
Casa Zapata, the Chicano theme house, to
Chill Night at Okada, the Asian-American
theme dorm, house hosts and residential
staffs will try to make members of the Class
0f2007 feel at home.
"Most pro fros come to Uj to find out what
black life at Stanford is really like," said
Melissa Ghoston, an ethnic theme associate
in Ujamaa. "Uj bends over backwards to
have as many [room hosts] as possible to ac
commodate the high number of pro fros
looking for the Ujamaa experience."
On Friday afternoon, four of the Univer
sity's major ethnic community centers will
welcome students and provide them with a
glimpse of Stanford's multicultural scene
and the resources it has to offer.
"When students come to El Centro they
are able to experience the academic, cultur

aland social support that will be available to
them should they choose Stanford," said
Frances Morales, director of El Centro Chi
cano, "Over the years I have heard students
comment that seeing a supportive Chi
cano / Latino community at Stanford was a
deciding factor for them."
According to Morales, these community
center activities may help ease the transition
from high school to college for parents as
well as students. Both will be invited to the
Latino / Chicano Welcome and the De
sayuno Como Hecho En Casa event on Sat
urday morning.
"Parents feel at ease knowing that their
daughters and sons have faculty, staff and
students they can turn to for support," she
said. "This is particularly true for students
who are first-generation college students."
The Black Community Service Center
and the Black Recruitment Orientation
Committee will team up to host a series of
events including the Black Student Wel
come and the BROC party on Friday night.
"I think these events will give students a
good sense of Stanford's black community
and the many outlets available on campus to
express one's blackness," said Damon Jones,
a coordinator for community programming
at the BCSC. "This program is very success
ful in my opinion. A lot of our methods of re
cruitment have been adopted by the gener
al Admit Weekend program."
The American-Indian, Alaska-Native and
Native-Hawaiian community will be hosting
a reception on Friday, and the A3C, home to
over 40 Asian organizations, will be holding
an open house.
"I hope that students will be able to see
that the Asian-American community has a
strong presence on this campus, and that
