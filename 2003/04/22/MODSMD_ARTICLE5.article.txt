### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
John Arrillaga, Class of 1960, has
agreed to fund the construction of the
Graduate Community Center, the Grad
uate Student Council announced on
Wednesday.
"Right now all we can really tell you is
that we're very excited that Mr. Arrillaga
has decided to take on the Graduate
Community Center," said outgoing GSC

Vice President Lisa Marin. "[Dean of
Graduate Student Life] Chris Griffith
and a team of grad students and admin
istrators designed the proposal for the
center several years ago, and the exact
site was selected in mid-2001."
The center will be located in Escondi
do Village, on or near Escondido Road.
The task force had included the center
as an option in its reports to University
Provost John Etchemendy, but a private
donor was needed to fund it.

"This year, the Graduate Student
Council, the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee and the ASSU Executives
Monica Henestroza and Nick Rodriguez
worked hard to convince the University
that the [Graduate Community Center]
should be a high priority, and we are very
grateful to the administrators, particular
ly Provost [John] Etchemendy, who sup
ported our efforts and ultimately identi-
tied a donor," Marin added.
The group, which is comprised
of students, staff and administra
tors, has been meeting since last
year to assess campus renovation
opportunities.
