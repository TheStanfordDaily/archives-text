# French institute to open next fall

### EVAN BERGER 
With generous support from the French govern
ment, Stanford will welcome the France-Stanford
Center for Interdisciplinary Studies to campus next
fall. The center, funded by a $1 million gift from the
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is intended to in
crease collaboration between French and American
academics in a wide range of fields.
The center will succeed Stanford's Interdiscipli
nary Institute of French Studies and will be funded by
an endowment, jointly supported by the French min
istry's gift and matching funds raised by Stanford.
Unlike most French Studies programs in the Unit
ed States, the center will cover more than just the hu
manities. The center plans to address not only sub
jects like language, literature and history, but will also
include French perspectives on disciplines as diverse
as engineering, business and law.
Keith Baker, professor of history and cognizant
dean for the I lumanities, will be the center's director.
"The 112 undamental goal of the center will be to fos
ter interdisciplinary research interests between Stan
ford scholars across the departments and schools and
their French counterparts," Baker told the Stanford
News Service.
The center's broad scope was put on display at a
conference titled "Issues of Risk and Responsibility in
Contemporary Engineering and Science: French and
U.S. Perspectives," held at the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter from April 7 to 8. The conference paired 12
French researchers with counterparts from the Stan
ford faculty to discuss a wide variety of issues, ranging
from space exploration to stem-cell research. Partici
pants addressed many of today's most controversial
international debates, including climate change and
national security.
Though there were disagreements among scholars
of the two countries, conference organizer Robert
McGinn, professor of management science and engi
neering and director of the Program in Science, Tech
nology and Society, said that the event was remark
ably congenial and productive â€” so productive that
the participants plan to reconvene in Paris for further
discussion.
McGinn, the associate director of the center, ex
plained that France and the United States have vastly
different engineering traditions which shape their
methods and practices. McGinn believes that French
and American scholars have much to learn from each
other's approaches to science and policy.
"France is very interesting to look at as an industri-

al society, not just as a cultural cen
ter because things are sometimes
done in interestingly different
ways from the way in which they're
done in the United States,"
McGinn said. "We need to be more
aware of alternate possibilities for
doing things than those we usually
take for granted."
McGinn hopes that the center

will "cultivate and deepen fields of
research across various disci
plines." He said that few American
universities study contemporary
France as a society that faces many
of the same issues that the United
States does.
When asked why the French
government offered its gift to Stan
ford, McGinn speculated that the
French government may see the
program as a way to "breathe new
life into French Studies" in the
United States, where interest in
the discipline has declined.

The center will stage annual
conferences, addressing both his
torical fields and contemporary
issues of the natural and social sci
ences. The center has also begun
sponsoring courses by visiting
professors, including a current
course in political anthropology
taught by Prof. Jean Pierre
Dupuy of the Ecole Polytech
nique in Paris.
The center will be officially
launched in the fall at a celebration
with French academics and diplo
matic officials.
