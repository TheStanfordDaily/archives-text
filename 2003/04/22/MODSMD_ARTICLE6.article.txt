# French institute to open next fall

With generous support from the French govern
ment, Stanford will welcome the France-Stanford
Center for Interdisciplinary Studies to campus next
fall. The center, funded by a $1 million gift from the
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is intended to in
crease collaboration between French and American
academics in a wide range of fields.
The center will succeed Stanford's Interdiscipli
nary Institute of French Studies and will be funded by
an endowment, jointly supported by the French min
istry's gift and matching funds raised by Stanford.
Unlike most French Studies programs in the Unit
ed States, the center will cover more than just the hu
manities. The center plans to address not only sub
jects like language, literature and history, but will also
include French perspectives on disciplines as diverse
as engineering, business and law.
Keith Baker, professor of history and cognizant
dean for the I lumanities, will be the center's director.
"The 112 undamental goal of the center will be to fos
ter interdisciplinary research interests between Stan
ford scholars across the departments and schools and
their French counterparts," Baker told the Stanford
News Service.
The center's broad scope was put on display at a
conference titled "Issues of Risk and Responsibility in
Contemporary Engineering and Science: French and
U.S. Perspectives," held at the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter from April 7 to 8. The conference paired 12
French researchers with counterparts from the Stan
ford faculty to discuss a wide variety of issues, ranging
from space exploration to stem-cell research. Partici
pants addressed many of today's most controversial
international debates, including climate change and
national security.
Though there were disagreements among scholars
of the two countries, conference organizer Robert
McGinn, professor of management science and engi
neering and director of the Program in Science, Tech
nology and Society, said that the event was remark
ably congenial and productive â€” so productive that
the participants plan to reconvene in Paris for further
discussion.
McGinn, the associate director of the center, ex
plained that France and the United States have vastly
different engineering traditions which shape their
methods and practices. McGinn believes that French
and American scholars have much to learn from each
other's approaches to science and policy.
"France is very interesting to look at as an industri-
