## Weapons ingredients found in Iraq 
### 
(AP) — U.S. weapons experts in Iraq
have discovered ingredients and equip
ment that can be used to make a chemi
cal weapon, U.S. military officials con
firmed yesterday.
The discovery south of Baghdad was
made several days ago with the help of
an Iraqi scientist who claimed to have
worked in Saddam Hussein's chemical
weapons program.
The military officials, involved in the
weapons hunt and based at Camp Doha
in Kuwait, refused to name the scientist
or identify the material that had been
buried in the ground.
Many chemical weapons ingredients
have non-military purposes and officials
cautioned that the findings, which are
being analyzed, do not confirm the pres
ence of chemical weapons at that site.
Officials also raised suspicions about
some of the scientist's claims that
couldn't be immediately verified.

According to the officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, the scientist
said Iraq destroyed and buried chemical
weapons and biological warfare equip
ment days before the war began.
A senior defense official in Washing
ton said the Pentagon was "highly skep
tical" of information the scientist provid
ed alleging that Iraq recently began co
operating with Osama bin Laden's al-
Qaida terror network.
The Bush administration has
claimed that Saddam's regime had ties
with al-Qaida but they've provided little
conclusive evidence.
So far, no new discoveries have been
made in Iraq that link Saddam to al-
Qaida, the defense official said, speak
ing on condition of anonymity.
In Washington, Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld declined to confirm
the discovery, which was first reported
in yesterday's edition of The New York

Times.
He said inspections were continuing
in a search for evidence of weapons of
mass destruction and that the govern
ment would "obviously look with favor
on" Iraqis who provide information on
hidden materials.
Rumsfeld said last week that U.S.
troops would need to rely on the help of
Iraqis to find the weaponry.
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans
Blix cautioned the Americans to treat in
formation with skepticism, noting that
some Iraqis may be motivated to claim
more than they know.
"They have to examine everything
critically," Blix told The Associated
Press yesterday.
Blix's inspectors, working in Iraq be
tween November until mid-March,
didn't find any evidence that Iraq had
weapons it claimed to have destroyed
years ago.
