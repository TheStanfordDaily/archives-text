Editorial

The focus on health in the United
States reflects an interesting"
paradox: Although the United
States spends more than most
countries on health care — more than 14
percent of the total gross domestic product
is devoted to the health sector — our coun
try ranks below many developed countries
on most scales of health, including infant
mortality, life expectancy at every age ex
cept for 80 and access to health care. While
there are many factors that are beyond the
control of any one individual — the rising
cost of health care, for example — there
are many steps that people can take to im
prove their overall level of health.
Last week, former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders came to speak to the Stan
ford community, and she reflected on her
life, her work and the

ucation to offer more health programming
so that students will have more opportuni
ties to become informed. Currently, many
houses and dorms on campus do not have
peer health educators; nutrition courses
are few and sometimes offered only to
human biology or biology majors.
Additionally, in past years Cowell pub
lished health newsletters that were posted
in dorm bathrooms and in dining halls,
giving students health tips and ideas on
leading a healthy life. Hectic schedules that
include late-night pizza runs and frequent
sleepless nights around midterms and fi
nals can thwart efforts to maintain a
healthy lifestyle. For these reasons, making
health resources and information more ac
cessible should be an important priority for

In line with Elders' advice, it is up to
each individual to become knowledgeable
about health issues. Every day, studies are
completed or published around the world
with new findings about the "perfect" food
or the "right" type of exercise and people
are often left confused and frustrated
about what to make of the plethora of in
formation available. Too often Americans
read about a new health finding that
promises a quick and easy solution to a
health problem and are left disappointed
when they fail to get results. Health educa
tion can make a difference in learning how
to wade through the vast amounts of stud
ies and facts, separating the good advice
from the quackery and where students, fac
ulty and community members at Stanford
can take an important step in improving
their health.
Whether it's through taking a class at
Stanford about sleep or nutrition or speak
ing to a doctor about lifestyle habits and
making changes, there are several ways
that individuals can become more knowl
edgeable about their health. We also urge

lifestyles — providing easy access to a nu
tritionist is an important consideration that
the University should keep in mind. These
specialists can help students dispel eating
myths and avoid dangerous diets that can
seriously impede their health.
Many health and lifestyle habits are es
tablished early on in a person's life and col
lege is often the first time many students
begin to completely take care of all of their
health concerns. While every student at
Stanford will graduate with a wealth of
knowledge and information in many areas,
it is also important that she or he leave cam
pus and step into the world with a good
health education as well. There is no rea
son why bright Stanford students should
be uninformed about such a significant
and valuable part of their lives.
With so many issues to think about each
day — personal schedules, international
conflicts and future career plans — health
issues are often pushed back and forgotten.
Yet health and wellness should not be taken
for granted and becoming better informed
can be the first important step toward lead
ing a healthy life.
