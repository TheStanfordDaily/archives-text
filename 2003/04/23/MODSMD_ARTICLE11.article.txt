## Behind the music 
### 
Ask students what they be
lieve is the best part of
being at college and many
will say it's the unique liv
ing experience, the chance to get to
meet a variety of people or the op
portunity to expand their horizons
and develop knowledge. I recently
asked a friend what he most liked
about college life and he said, "the
ability to download stuff a thousand
times faster than usual at home."
Most colleges around the coun
try have high-speed Internet ac
cess and many students take ad
vantage of it by using file-sharing
software to download music,
movies, games or virtually any
thing that can be transferred digi
tally.
For most Stanford students,
downloading stuff from the Net
— especially music mp3s — is
rarely given a second thought. It
has become a collegiate pastime.
The availability of more band
width than we know what to do
with makes downloading so much
faster and more efficient than ever
before. But the proliferation of
high-speed Internet access has the
music industry in a tizzy. The Big
Music honchos believe free file
sharing is the main reason why
record sales have declined over 10
percent in the past two years.
The Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America successfully
brought down the beast that start
ed it all: Napster. Now, the post-
Napster world is populated by
new peer-to-peer (p2p) software
such as Kazaa, Morpheus and
Gnutella. What makes these
newer incarnations different from
Napster (and more difficult to
shut down) is the fact that they
don t operate from a centralized
server. So the chase continues:
The RIAA is now hunting individ
uals downloading music.
They recently brought a law
suit against four college students
from different schools for operat
ing file-swapping services over
their campus networks. The stu
dents are facing fines of up to
$ 150,000 per song that was illegal

ly traded. The RIAA is going after
the middlemen as well, asking
large companies and universities
(including Stanford) to prohibit its
employees and students from
using these file-sharing networks.
The RIAA is even forcing telecom
munications companies to give it
names of subscribers trading large
amounts of copyrighted data over

their servers.
While music
labels and artists
have a right to
protect their
work, the RIAA is
pointing too
much of the
blame for the re
cent slump in

music sales at file-sharing software
and their predominant users: col
lege students. This is a grievous
mistake; college-aged people are
some of the biggest buyers of not
only music CDs, but also concert
tickets and other music-related
paraphernalia. By going after
young buyers, Big Music is send
ing the wrong message — that the
music industry is nothing but a
greedy, vicious business that
doesn't care about the demands of
individual consumers.
The RIAA should first take a
look at its own members (compa
nies and artists) for the problems
plaguing the music industry.
Companies charge too much for
CDs in the first place — especially
when you consider the quality of
the CD. About 15 bucks for 15 de
cent songs is a good deal in my
opinion, but 15 bucks for three
good songs and 13 lame ones is
not.
Years ago, the radio was the
perfect place to hear new songs
you wouldn't get to hear other
wise. Today the opposite is true:
You can't listen to commercial
radio without hearing another
Avril Lavigne song or the latest
Good Charlotte tune. In my opin
ion, there is more music — better
music — out there. But with labels
only pushing forward a few artists
and pushing aside all the rest, the

ability to sample new material is
severely limited. This is why so
many independent artists prefer
that their music is traded online
— it creates exposure, which can
translate into more sales.
Recently, artists have been
putting out bogus mp3s on file
sharing networks in order to
thwart downloading. Try finding
good copies of the new White
Stripes songs online and you're
more likely to get looped versions
of them. Now, this did force me to
go out and buy their new CD, but
I can't help but feel a little an
noyed bythat — especially when I
just spent $55 to see them in con
cert.
When Radiohead's new album
was put online, the band said the
version was "incomplete," and a
"work in progress." I don't know if
that is true or not, but the album
sounds pretty good and done to
me. It is more likely that it was just
a ploy to buy it when it comes out.
With all this exploitation and
manipulation going around, it's
no wonder music fans have be
come jaded. Nowadays, consumer
demands are becoming much
more complex and individual
ized. Big Music must realize that
these demands cannot continue to
be met by packaging the answers
in hard-to-open plastic wrapping
and tough-to-peel stickers.
The advent of legal online file
sharing where artists still get roy
alties is a good start toward creat
ing a new music market that
meets both the demands of the
consumers and the music indus
try, but it can't be the only solu
tion. Shutting down all file-shar
ing networks and busting down
dormroom doors and arresting
college kids won't solve the prob
lem.
So unless Stanford cuts my In
ternet cord or the music police
comes and gets me, I'll continue
to download my favorite music
the way I want to.

Got any good mp3s ? Send them to me at
