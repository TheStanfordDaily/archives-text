Alcohol Policy will not reduce the number
of hospital visits for binge drinking
The growing ferocity of enforcement
regarding underage drinking policy is
not only a disturbance of the trust and
cooperation that Stanford has tradition
ally shown its undergraduates — it is en
tirely ineffective. The real hazard lies in
small groups of students consuming
hard alcohol away from large parties and
there doesn't seem to be any new Uni
versity legislation to effectively address
this problem.
The constant invasion of parties by
minor-in-possession citation-wielding
police officers, the recent policy of alco
hol-free freshman residence events and a
general tightening up of alcohol rules
will do little, if anything, to curb the in
creasing number of trips to the hospital

due to binge drinking. In my opinion,
the reason for this is one of simple prac
ticality: No one gets dangerously drunk
by drinking at a party.
To do so is simply not worth the efTort.
Even if you are able to fight your way to
the front of a crowded bar the requisite
eight to 15 times it would take to really
harm yourself with alcohol, the odds are
you'll have a stomach painfully full of
beer well before you're in danger. Even
parties serving mixed drinks are gener
ally safe, as the aforementioned scarcity
of service combines with a desire to make
weak drinks (in the interest of saving the
house money) and the desire by servers
to avoid an incident (in the interest of
keeping said house off of probation — or
worse).
Take away drinking at parties and you
leave people with an even greater excuse
to consume alcohol before going out, in
their rooms, where hard alcohol is the
beverage of choice and the risk of unsafe
consumption is highest. The new rules

and the increasingly harsh police force
will snag more and more students sip
ping beer on the dance floor and contin
ue to ignore growing numbers of those
who binge drink in private.
No one denies that the problem is com
plicated: The freedom and privacy of
students must be preserved, while at the
same time offering them a safe place to
explore drinking and its consequences.
This is a battle that must be won by stu
dent dorm staff, who have the most ex
tensive contact with minors, along with
some administrators. Getting resident
assistants and other staff to buy into and
convincingly communicate safe drinking
practices without sounding like they are
delivering an obligatory formality is a
good place to start.
Further efforts to curb binge drink
ing, however, will only increase its ap
peal. If the University wants to avoid
drinking incidents that endanger lives,
the administration would be just as well
off banning milk in freshman dorms as

they would be banning beer at parties
held there.

Principle of hospitality important during
Admit Weekend
The column "Overprotected" (April
21) seems to ignore, if not consciously re
ject, the principle of hospitality. I must
say that I am curious to know what kind
of bizarre world view can lead a person to
sec an effort to let prospective students
see the best side of Stanford as an "un
representative charade."
While some might enjoy a short-lived
burst of perverse, cynical amusement
from watching crowds of talented, ener
getic high school seniors spiral into a
jaded, sarcastic bitterness over a period of
72 hours, I personally don't see this as a
worthy goal for Admit Weekend. The au

thors may believe that a "fair representa
tion" of our community would entail a les
son on surviving hangovers or getting to
know department administrators between
the sheets, but frankly, I beg to differ.
Trying to encapsulate the entirety of
the Stanford experience in one weekend
is a truly Herculean task. If the resulting
three days feel slightly artificial, it is sim
ply an unavoidable consequence of try
ing to pack a snapshot of one of the most
culturally and intellectually rich commu
nities on the face of the Earth into a few
short days and nights.
We share with the Admit Weekend co
ordinators the task of welcoming
prospective students with warmth and
hospitality. Whether we are inviting a
stranger to our home or a thousand
strangers to our school, hospitality
means taking extra steps to make the
guests feel comfortable and happy.
