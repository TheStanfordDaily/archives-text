# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Admit Weekend an opportunity to showcase Stanford's caliber 
### HUNTER HARGRAVES GUEST COLUMNIST 
As one of the coordinators for
Admit Weekend 2003, I was dis
appointed to read in Monday's
column "Overprotected" that
some students feel that "the
events of Admit Weekend in no
way convey what college is really
like." The authors misunder
stand the fundamental purpose
of Admit Weekend.
First, Admit Weekend is de

signed to provide a comprehen
sive glimpse into life at Stanford.
Chances are, a Stanford student
will at some point attend an activ
ities fair, an event sponsored by a
community center and an infor
mational panel on studying
abroad or on applying to gradu
ate school. Instead of making
Admit Weekend a "typical" week
end, we plan events that reflect
the very real opportunities avail
able to Stanford undergraduates
over the course of four years.

Second, Admit Weekend not
only invites the 2,250 admitted
students to campus but also their
parents, many of whom have
never set foot on the Farm. For
these people, Admit Weekend is
a first look of an often-intimidat
ing place where they or their
child may spend the next four
years. To a high school senior
who has one week to visit five dif
ferent campuses, perhaps those
extra events that a current stu
dent may find unrepresentative
of one weekend are indeed help
ful in choosing a college. Any
orientation and guide that we
can give them as members of the

Stanford community is much ap
preciated, as shown by the 82
percent of prospective freshmen
who attend Admit Weekend and
enroll at Stanford — hardly an
indication that the weekend is "a
deterrent to attending Stanford"
at all.
It is true that the average
weekend at Stanford does not
include an activities fair, alco
hol-free parties or panels about
how to enhance the freshman
experience. But Admit Week
end has the daunting task of
showcasing Stanford to the
most talented high school se
niors in the world, who must

then decide if Stanford is a
good fit for them. The average
day at Stanford might not com
pletely distinguish Stanford
from other institutions of simi
lar caliber, but by providing ac
tivities that cater to both
prospective freshmen and their
parents, combined with resi
dential programming and host
ing to show these prospective
students dorm life, as coordina
tors, we think Admit Weekend
reflects the fact that Stanford is
pretty attractive.
Admit Weekend is the most
comprehensive college preview
weekend in the nation, involving

more than 1,400 students as
hosts, coordinators and volun
teers. So this weekend, we're ask
ing all members of the Stanford
community to welcome these
bright prospective freshmen and
their parents and give them addi
tional perspectives on what it's
like to attend Stanford — you
might be able to offer something
that the red folder cannot.
