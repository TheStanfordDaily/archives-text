## Card softball bucks Broncos twice 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday's doubleheader between
the Stanford softball team and Santa
Clara had an even more familiar feel than
a cross-town rivalry.

Softball
Tuesday: No. 15 Stanford 2, Santa Clara ;
No. 15 Stanford 9, Santa Clara 0

While the neighboring Broncos (24-
21) boasted several Stanford connections
on its roster, the No. 13 Cardinal (34-18,
4-8) took no pity on its old mates, sweep
ing the day-night doubleheader 2-1 and
9-0.
The head coach of the opposing Bron
cos is former Cardinal pitcher and
shorstop Marci Crouch, who played
under current Cardinal coaches John
Rittman and Lonni Alameda.
And the ace of the Santa Clara pitching
staff is Jaime Forman, a former Stanford
pitcher that suited up here her first two
years of college.
The Stanford presidential scholar
opted out of her junior season before
graduating in three years and pursuing
a graduate degree at Santa Clara. For
man-Lau has revived her softball career
at the neighboring university and is set
ting new records there — and was just

fresh off of the first perfect game in
Santa Clara school history.
But records meant nothing to the
Stanford offense of her old haunts.

All the offense ace Dana Sorensen
would need came in the top of the first.
Freshman center fielder Catalina Morris
led off the game with a homer to left, fel
low Lauren Lappin bunted fora base hit,
moved to third on a double by Cassi
Brangham and was driven home after a
sacrifice fly by Kira Ching.
Sorensen took it from there, allowing
just four hits and one unearned run while
striking out eight Broncos in the opener.
The nightcap followed with an explo
sion of the Cardinal offense. The hot
Stanford bats tallied 12 hits and nine runs
in a five-inning game.
The evening was highlighted by an
eight-run third inning during which
Brangham had two hits, two runs and
an RBI single. She finished 3-for-3 in
the win.
Senior pitcher Tori Nyberg recorded
the victory, shutting out the Broncos and
holding them to only two hits.
The Cardinal is feeling good following
the sweep and heading into a big week
end against Pac-10 powerhouses No. 2
UCLA and No. 4 Washington.
"These two wins are good for us
going into this weekend when we are
playing two really tough teams,"
Brangham said. "It is really good for
our confidence to just rally a bunch of
hits and score a lot of runs in these mid
week games."
