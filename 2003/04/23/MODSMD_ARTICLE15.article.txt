# Palmer makes perfect sense for Cincy
## 
### 
The Cincinnati Bengals have first
pick in this weekend's NFL
Draft, by virtue of their 1-15
record and the mere fact that
Akili Smith is not only their roster, but ac
tually plays in their games on occasion.
Frighteningly, they seriously consid
ered drafting a cornerback (Terence New
man of Kansas State). But, in a move that is
actually surprising because it nukes-si*
much sense, the Bengals are negotiating a
contract with Southern California's Carson
Palmer and plan to pick him first overall.
If there is a player capable of resurrect
ing the moribund Bengals, it is Palmer.
This man is an amazing quarterback.
After USC suffered early losses to
Kansas State and Washington State,
Palmer took over. He shredded Notre
Dame, which had one of the most domi
nant defensive units in football last year,
racking up more yards than the Irish had
ever allowed in a game in their long and
storied history.
lowa proved no challenge in the Or
ange Bowl, either. He won the small
games, he won the big games, and he even
won the Heisman Trophy.
He's got a strong arm, throws with
tremendous accuracy and timing, runs
through his receiver progressions with
ease, finds his backs and tight ends with
great success and displays poise in and out
of the pocket.
He's dealt with hype and sky-high ex
pectations throughout his career and has
managed to improve every year (particu
larly in his senior year, when he posted an
impressive 62 percent completion rate
along with a nifty 32-10 touchdown-to-in
terception ratio).

He has not had the
benefit of a gimmicky of
fense and an ultra-talent
ed supporting cast (like
Ken Dorsey) and played
in one of the nation's
toughest conferences.
In short, he's the man.
Well, actually, that's
not true., v
Jon Kitna is the man.

Bengals rookie head coach Marvin
Lewis named Kitna the Bengals' 2003
starter months ago, shortly after being
hired. This is good news for Palmer, who
won't have to start as a rookie like last year's
No. 1 pick, David Carr. As good as Palmer
is, the best thing he can do his first season is
not play.
Rookie quarterbacks, even those who
were unfathomably dominant in college,
do not succeed in the NFL. Joey Harring
ton couldn't do it. Michael Vick couldn't do
it. Ryan Leaf couldn't do it. (His l-of-15
passing performance against the Chiefs in
his third game was more painful to watch
than any individual performance in NFL
history.)
Of course, there are exceptions to every
rule. The player usually cited as said ex
ception? Peyton Manning, who got inter
cepted 28 times as a rookie en route to a
pedestrian — but not abysmal — 71.2
passer rating.
Lewis, who seems far too intelligent to
be a Bengals head coach, is wise enough to
see the value in patience.
Why throw Palmer into the fire as a
rookie with the hope that he can post
mediocre numbers as a rookie when you
have a veteran who's posted mediocre

numbers his whole career?
As the Jets found out this year with
Chad Pennington, time pays dividends at
the quarterback position. It takes a long,
long time to fully become comfortable with
an offensive playbook as well as the sheer
speed of the pro game — something that
allows little margin for error.
The N FL Draft is often likened to a meat
market, as times in the 40-yarxL dash-take
on otherworldly importance and players'
heights are measured to eighths of an inch.
But quarterback is one position at which
intangibles get their due. The best athletes
— Akili Smith, Michael Bishop, etc. —
often end up being the biggest failures.
Kids full of heart who lack many of the
same physical gifts (a la Brett Favre) often
end up as the greatest success stories.
Palmer runs a 4.8 in the 40 and some
times his deep balls look just a tad lazy,
but he's still widely considered the best
player available.
Now, Palmer's not perfect. After all, he
got sacked for minus-26 yards against the
Cardinal this year. The only time a quar
terback should get sacked fora 26-yard loss
is when I'm playing Madden 94 on my
SNES.
And that's exactly the sort of thing
Palmer will learn best on the bench in
Cincy. Does he really need to get driven
into the ground 76 times like Carr did last
year in order to realize that he's got a long
way to go?

starter months ago, shortly after being
hired. This is good news for Palmer, who
won't have to start as a rookie like last year's
No. 1 pick, David Carr. As good as Palmer
is, the best thing he can do his first season is
not play.
Rookie quarterbacks, even those who
were unfathomably dominant in college,
do not succeed in the NFL. Joey Harring
ton couldn't do it. Michael Vick couldn't do
it. Ryan Leaf couldn't do it. (His l-of-15
passing performance against the Chiefs in
his third game was more painful to watch
than any individual performance in NFL
history.)
Of course, there are exceptions to every
rule. The player usually cited as said ex
ception? Peyton Manning, who got inter
cepted 28 times as a rookie en route to a
pedestrian — but not abysmal — 71.2
passer rating.
Lewis, who seems far too intelligent to
be a Bengals head coach, is wise enough to
see the value in patience.
Why throw Palmer into the fire as a
rookie with the hope that he can post
mediocre numbers as a rookie when you
have a veteran who's posted mediocre

numbers his whole career?
As the Jets found out this year with
Chad Pennington, time pays dividends at
the quarterback position. It takes a long,
long time to fully become comfortable with
an offensive playbook as well as the sheer
speed of the pro game — something that
allows little margin for error.
The N FL Draft is often likened to a meat
market, as times in the 40-yarxL dash-take
on otherworldly importance and players'
heights are measured to eighths of an inch.
But quarterback is one position at which
intangibles get their due. The best athletes
— Akili Smith, Michael Bishop, etc. —
often end up being the biggest failures.
Kids full of heart who lack many of the
same physical gifts (a la Brett Favre) often
end up as the greatest success stories.
Palmer runs a 4.8 in the 40 and some
times his deep balls look just a tad lazy,
but he's still widely considered the best
player available.
Now, Palmer's not perfect. After all, he
got sacked for minus-26 yards against the
Cardinal this year. The only time a quar
terback should get sacked fora 26-yard loss
is when I'm playing Madden 94 on my
SNES.
And that's exactly the sort of thing
Palmer will learn best on the bench in
Cincy. Does he really need to get driven
into the ground 76 times like Carr did last
year in order to realize that he's got a long
way to go?
