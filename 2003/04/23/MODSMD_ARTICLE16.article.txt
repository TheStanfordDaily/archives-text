The Stanford women's
tennis team clinched its 16th
consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference title yesterday after
noon with a 4-3 win at cross
town rival California.
The top-ranked Cardinal
(20-1, 8-0 Pac-10) defeated
the No. 5 Golden Bears (19-5,
6-2) when sophomore Erin
Burdette downed Cal's
Catherine Lynch 3-6,6-3,6-2
at the No. 3 singles spot.
It was no surprise the
matchup was as closely con
tested as it was, since both
teams combined to boast nine
players from the NCAA's top
120 singles players.
The Cardinal won the
doubles point but lost at both
No. 1 and No. 2 singles â€” so
its depth had to carry the
team the rest of the after
noon.
Stanford is 107-3 over the
last four years and next will
compete in the Pac-10 Indi
vidual Championships in
Ojai, Calif., starting tomor
row through Sunday.

Junior Lauren Barkinow lost her match yesterday, but her Cardinal team
mates picked up the slack and won their 16th-consecutive Pac-10 title.
