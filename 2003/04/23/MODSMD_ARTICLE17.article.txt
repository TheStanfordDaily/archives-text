Women's Lacrosse
Today: No. 15 Stanford 4 vs. California, 7 p.m.

Art equally important story, however, is
the showdown between the No. 15 Cardinal
(10-3, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Lacrosse
League) and California (10-4,3-0) at 7 p.m.
at Maloney Field in a game that will deter
mine the regular-season title.
"We honor the rivalry," Stanford coach
Michelle Uhlfelder said. "But we don't let it
dictate our emotion or focus."
The MPLL conference tournament will
be held in Palo Alto May 3 and 4, when
Stanford will be looking to claim its second
straight league title. (This form of the con
ference has only been in existence for one
other year.)
Stanford is led by offensive star Kelsey
Twist. Twist, a sophomore, lias scored 30
goals and added 19 assists in 13 games,
ranking 18th nationally in points per
game (3.77). Additionally, she's 14th in
the nation in groundballs per game at
3.92. Her best game of the season came in
a 14-13 double-overtime victory over
Notre Dame in which she netted four
goals — the last of which was the game
winning goal.
Twist has been instrumental in bringing
the Cardinal attack to national prominence.
Stanford ranks 11th nationally with 11.92
goals per game — the only West Coast team
ranked that high.
The Cardinal's defensive stalwart is its
goalie, junior Christina Saikus, who has put
up a 55 percent save percentage and has
122 saves.
As a result of the goalie's stellar play, the
Cardinal is 16th in the nation in scoring

margin (2.85).
In the bigger picture, though, all this
big-time Stanford success couldn't have
come without the help of the two graduat
ing seniors. (The Stanford women's
lacrosse program is relatively new to the
mostly East Coast scene. It has existed
only since 1996.)
Solomon arrived at Stanford last year
after transferring from Maryland, where
she won two NCAA championships in 2000
and 2001.
Last year, she set a number of Stanford
all-time records. She set a new school record
in goals against average (7.2), tied for first in
games played (18), was third in save per
centage (. 517) and minutes played (771)
and fifth in saves (138).
"She brought her experience and love of
the game from Maryland," said Uhlfelder.
"She stepped in right away with her sense of
ownership of the program."
This year, however, she has lost her start
ing job to Saikus, who has had a great sea
son of her own.
Dietrich, meanwhile, has been more of a
defensive presence over the years. She took
a year off from the sport last spring to con
centrate on school, but had a big impact on
the program in her first two years.
She's one of Stanford's all-time leaders in
draw controls and set a school record her
freshman year with eight successful draws
against UC-Davis.
But her biggest contribution, according
to Uhlfelder, has been more than a physical
presence.
"She provides a lot of emotional support
for her teammates," she said.
Both seniors will be honored before the
announcement of the Cardinal starting line
up on Wednesday. Each will be given flow
ers, and an announcer will summarize their
outstanding accomplishments over the
years.
"Both Lauren and Virginia will leave the
program knowing that they have played
special parts in building the tradition of
Stanford lacrosse," Uhlfelder said.

Sophomore lacrosse superstar Kelsey Twist is a big reason the Cardinal is in a position to win
its second-straight MPLL title. She is Stanford's leading scorer with 30 goals and 19 assists.
