A rain check only delayed the
Sacramento State Hornets' being
swept by the Stanford baseball team.

Baseball
Tuesday: No. 4 Stanford 5, Sacra
mento State 1

The No. 4 Cardinal (27-11) had
taken the first of a two-game series
against the Hornets on April 11 by
a score of 9-1, but the second game
was rained out. The make-up
game was played last night at
Sacramento, and once again the
Hornets only managed one run
against a tough Stanford pitching
staff and defense, losing 5-1.
As has been the case in the past
few games, one big inning has
been enough to lift the Cardinal to
victory. In last night's game it was
the fifth frame.
Striking out isn't a typical way to
start a rally, but senior Tobin
Swope managed just that as the
first batter in the fifth. Swope
swung on his third strike, but I for
nets catcher Matt Wilson hobbled
the ball, allowing Swope to take off

for first. Wilson's throw was so far
off the mark that Swope, with his
notorious speed, made it all the
way to third.
Junior Sam Fuld then walked,
and a sacrifice fly from junior
Brian I fall brought Swope home.
Junior Carlos Quentin then blast
ed a two-run homer to left and fin
ished the game 3-for-4 in the win.
"I was just seeing the ball well
today, and 1 saw some good pitch
es to hit," said Quentin, who has
been seeing the ball well now for
26-straight games (which is where
his hitting streak now stands). His
performance last night raised his
season batting average to an as
tounding .434, which would set a
school record if it holds for the re
mainder of the season.
Sophomore Danny Putnam
also homered with a solo shot in
the eighth inning for his ninth
homer of the season — putting
him in a tie with senior Ryan
Garko for the team lead.
Four Cardinal pitchers took
turns at shutting down the Hor
nets offense.
Freshman Kodiak Quick threw
three scoreless innings to start the
game before sophomore Jonny

Dyer took over. Dyer allowed one
run in one and two thirds innings,
and since he was on the mound in
the fifth when Stanford went ahead,
he was credited with the win.
Senior Ryan McCally dealt an
other three scoreless innings, and
freshman Matt Manship was
brought in with two outs in the bot
tom of the eighth to get the Cardi
nal out of a jam. Manship's first
three pitches were balls, but he bat
tled back to strike his man out and
closed the game with a perfect
ninth inning.
Stanford resumes Pac-10 play
this weekend with a home series
against second-place Arizona and
refuses to relax.
"Every series, including the one
versus Arizona this weekend is
big," Quentin said. "We will just
try to approach it the same way we
have been and try to play some
good baseball by swinging the bats
just a little better, pitching well and
playing some good defense."
Friday's series opener at 6 p.m.
will be the first Stanford baseball
game televised by the College
Sports Television Network—
which made its programming
debut earlier this month.
