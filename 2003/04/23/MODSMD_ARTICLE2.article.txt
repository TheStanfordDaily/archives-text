# ASSU certifies contested election
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
In the final meeting of the 2002-2003
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night certified the highly contested
results for the senior class election, as well
as the results for other races. Additional
ly, the Senate passed a bill mandating that
election results — including the identities
of the winning slates and senators — are
withheld for two clays following the elec
tion to ensure the legitimacy of election
appeals and complaints.
The Senate decided at its meeting last
week to create a committee to investigate
voting difficulties from the election and
recommend to the Senate an appropriate
course of action based on these findings.
This sparked a controversy over a poten
tial re-vote and its ramifications.
In the election, the slate Fire It Up won
by 10 votes after two run-offs, and after

the election there were reports that some
students had been unable to vote on the
ASSU Web site for the senior class elec
tion and that some students who were not
rising seniors had voted for senior class
presidential slates.
In its report, the committee recom
mended several improvements upon the
current elections system and suggested
that the Senate certify the election results.
The committee said that a maximum
of 33 people may have been unable to
vote in the election due to technical er
rors. The committee determined that
there was not enough evidence to suggest
that this would have specifically changed
the results ol the senior class election.
"No single slate was seriously affected,"
said sophomore Senator Howard Chiou.
Representatives from the senior class
slates contesting the election results ex
pressed appreciation for the thorough
ness of the committee's report but were

dissatisfied with its recommendations.
"We are disappointed with the logic
used in the report and we are extraordi
narily disappointed by the conclusion"
said Fast Forward member Mark
McLaughlin, a junior. "The unpre
dictable legitimacy of a second election is
being used as reason and logic to over
shadow the lact that this first election was
illegitimate and lacked legitimacy. At the
end of the day, voters were not able to
vote and they were disenfranchised."
The Senate acknowledged that stu
dents being unable to vote was a concern.
However, the findings of the committee
did not suggest that a re-election was an
appropriate course of action.
"We don't think that a second elec
tion would do anything to completely
legitimize whoever wins," said Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior and member

of the investigative committee.
"Basically, with such a tight elec
tion, it will be contestable under all
circumstances and there's no
guarantee [against] additional
technical problems."
I n order to address the difficul
ties incurred in this election and
ameliorate the process for future
elections, a bill was passed stipulat
ing several alterations to the elec
tion system. The system will have to
rely on a database to determine

who is eligible to vote in a particular
election and to make a potential ap
peal easier to investigate.
Additionally, the results of elec
tion will not be disclosed until at
least two days after the election
ends, creating a grace period dur
ing which time all complaints and
appeals in regards to the election
must be registered. The Elections
Commission will be required to no
tify candidates of this deadline. Fu
ture ballots will stipulate that only
enrolled students are eligible to
vote, as well as whom to contact if a
voting problem arises.
"After having read the three
slates' brief... we agree with many
of the points there, and what the

Senate's voting on right now are is
sues that we are equally concerned
about," said junior Mikey Lee of
Fire it Up. "We'rejust as interested
in participating in any rectification
of this problem in the coming year."
The Senate voted to certify' the
results with five in favor and four
abstaining. Those who opted not to
vote said that they did so due to con
flicts of interest.
Another bill brought to the floor
last night concerned offering Sena
tors the option of receiving
stipends.
"I think it's important that peo
ple who need to work, or have the
option to dedicate themselves, [are
compensated for their time],"

said sophomore Senator Sara Ines
Calderon. "I'm not saying this
should be a bill to give people
money, [but] I think it should be an
option or available dependent
upon the senator's situation]."
The Senate was divided on the
issue.
Sophomore Senator Josh Shipp
said, "There will be people who will
be upset, but there will be people
who will be compensated justly. It's
tricky."
Others emphasized that it would
not take effect immediately and
could provide important opportu
nities in the future.
"We're opening up doors,"
Chiou said. "The new Senate can

do something about it in the fu
ture."
Ultimately, with five votes in
favor and three opposed, the bill
did not receive the requisite two
thirds approval to pass.
In other business, the Senate
passed its operating budget for next
year.
As the meeting wound down,
many of those present, including
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior, congratulated and
thanked the senators for their ef
forts during the year.
"You guys have done a wonder
ful job," said Assoc. Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves. "You ought to
be commended."

option to dedicate themselves, [are

In the final meeting of the 2002-2003
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night certified the highly contested
results for the senior class election, as well
as the results for other races. Additional
ly, the Senate passed a bill mandating that
election results — including the identities
of the winning slates and senators — are
withheld for two clays following the elec
tion to ensure the legitimacy of election
appeals and complaints.
The Senate decided at its meeting last
week to create a committee to investigate
voting difficulties from the election and
recommend to the Senate an appropriate
course of action based on these findings.
This sparked a controversy over a poten
tial re-vote and its ramifications.
In the election, the slate Fire It Up won
by 10 votes after two run-offs, and after

the election there were reports that some
students had been unable to vote on the
ASSU Web site for the senior class elec
tion and that some students who were not
rising seniors had voted for senior class
presidential slates.
In its report, the committee recom
mended several improvements upon the
current elections system and suggested
that the Senate certify the election results.
The committee said that a maximum
of 33 people may have been unable to
vote in the election due to technical er
rors. The committee determined that
there was not enough evidence to suggest
that this would have specifically changed
the results ol the senior class election.
"No single slate was seriously affected,"
said sophomore Senator Howard Chiou.
Representatives from the senior class
slates contesting the election results ex
pressed appreciation for the thorough
ness of the committee's report but were

dissatisfied with its recommendations.
"We are disappointed with the logic
used in the report and we are extraordi
narily disappointed by the conclusion"
said Fast Forward member Mark
McLaughlin, a junior. "The unpre
dictable legitimacy of a second election is
being used as reason and logic to over
shadow the lact that this first election was
illegitimate and lacked legitimacy. At the
end of the day, voters were not able to
vote and they were disenfranchised."
The Senate acknowledged that stu
dents being unable to vote was a concern.
However, the findings of the committee
did not suggest that a re-election was an
appropriate course of action.
"We don't think that a second elec
tion would do anything to completely
legitimize whoever wins," said Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior and member

The ASSU Undergraduate Senate meets last night at the Law School. The Senate had a full agenda,
certifying the contested election results and passing a measure changing elections protocol.
of the investigative committee.
"Basically, with such a tight elec
tion, it will be contestable under all
circumstances and there's no
guarantee [against] additional
technical problems."
I n order to address the difficul
ties incurred in this election and
ameliorate the process for future
elections, a bill was passed stipulat
ing several alterations to the elec
tion system. The system will have to
rely on a database to determine

who is eligible to vote in a particular
election and to make a potential ap
peal easier to investigate.
Additionally, the results of elec
tion will not be disclosed until at
least two days after the election
ends, creating a grace period dur
ing which time all complaints and
appeals in regards to the election
must be registered. The Elections
Commission will be required to no
tify candidates of this deadline. Fu
ture ballots will stipulate that only
enrolled students are eligible to
vote, as well as whom to contact if a
voting problem arises.
"After having read the three
slates' brief... we agree with many
of the points there, and what the

Senate's voting on right now are is
sues that we are equally concerned
about," said junior Mikey Lee of
Fire it Up. "We'rejust as interested
in participating in any rectification
of this problem in the coming year."
The Senate voted to certify' the
results with five in favor and four
abstaining. Those who opted not to
vote said that they did so due to con
flicts of interest.
Another bill brought to the floor
last night concerned offering Sena
tors the option of receiving
stipends.
"I think it's important that peo
ple who need to work, or have the
option to dedicate themselves, [are
compensated for their time],"

said sophomore Senator Sara Ines
Calderon. "I'm not saying this
should be a bill to give people
