# ASSU certifies contested election
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
In the final meeting of the 2002-2003
term, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night certified the highly contested
results for the senior class election, as well
as the results for other races. Additional
ly, the Senate passed a bill mandating that
election results — including the identities
of the winning slates and senators — are
withheld for two clays following the elec
tion to ensure the legitimacy of election
appeals and complaints.
The Senate decided at its meeting last
week to create a committee to investigate
voting difficulties from the election and
recommend to the Senate an appropriate
course of action based on these findings.
This sparked a controversy over a poten
tial re-vote and its ramifications.
In the election, the slate Fire It Up won
by 10 votes after two run-offs, and after

the election there were reports that some
students had been unable to vote on the
ASSU Web site for the senior class elec
tion and that some students who were not
rising seniors had voted for senior class
presidential slates.
In its report, the committee recom
mended several improvements upon the
current elections system and suggested
that the Senate certify the election results.
The committee said that a maximum
of 33 people may have been unable to
vote in the election due to technical er
rors. The committee determined that
there was not enough evidence to suggest
that this would have specifically changed
the results ol the senior class election.
"No single slate was seriously affected,"
said sophomore Senator Howard Chiou.
Representatives from the senior class
slates contesting the election results ex
pressed appreciation for the thorough
ness of the committee's report but were

dissatisfied with its recommendations.
"We are disappointed with the logic
used in the report and we are extraordi
narily disappointed by the conclusion"
said Fast Forward member Mark
McLaughlin, a junior. "The unpre
dictable legitimacy of a second election is
being used as reason and logic to over
shadow the lact that this first election was
illegitimate and lacked legitimacy. At the
end of the day, voters were not able to
vote and they were disenfranchised."
The Senate acknowledged that stu
dents being unable to vote was a concern.
However, the findings of the committee
did not suggest that a re-election was an
appropriate course of action.
"We don't think that a second elec
tion would do anything to completely
legitimize whoever wins," said Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior and member
