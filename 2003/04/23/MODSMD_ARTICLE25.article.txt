Probing Einstein's Theory of Relativity

Stanford physicists and
NASA are launching a
new satellite to investi
gate relativity. The
satellite, called Gravity
Probe B, will orbit at a
400-mile altitude di
rectly over the Earth's
poles. It will have two
gyroscopes that will
measure how space and
time are warped by our
planet. The numbers,
which are expected to
be very small, will be
help in understanding
how the universe be
haves. Einstein's theory'
of relativity suggests
that every object in the
universe causes a small
disturbance in space
and time. By measur-

ing the disturbance of the Earth, investigators are hop
ing to provide empirical evidence for this yet-unveri
fied phenomena.
The Secret Behind Chili Peppers Discovered
Ever wondered what causes pepper to be so hot? The

culprit is a chemical known as cap
saicin —an odorless, flavorless sub
stance commonly found in chili pep
pers. Capsaicin acts directly on the
pain receptors that detect heat. The
greater the concentration of the
chemical, the more heat you feel. As
you might guess, good old habanero
peppers have a lot of capsaicin. Be
cause it affects pain receptors, cap
saicin is used as an analgesic to treat

arthritis, neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Creams
and ointments containing capsaicin cause discomfort at
first but then help alleviate the pain.
Altruistic Birds
According to a study published in Nature by Terry
Burke and colleagues from the University of Sheffield,
in the U.K., altruistic birds may have an ulterior motive.
Burke studied the Seychelles warbler, which occupies
three isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. Since condi
tions are cramped, many females stay in the nest to help
raise the next brood. Burke found that the spinsters
would feed chicks being fed by the same female that fed
them when young. In most cases, this turned out to be
siblings or half-siblings. The authors believe this is an ev
idence of kin selection — you may not pass your genes
but ensure that genes very close to you survive.
How Old is Life?
When did life emerge on Earth? There are no fossils of
microscopic life that dominated early Earth. Instead,
scientists study bio-signatures, the traces left by them in
rocks. Using this method, the date corresponding to
the origin of life has been pushed back repeatedly. In
1990 it was 3.5 billion hears ago and in 1996 that figure
was refined to 3.9 billion years. New evidence found in
even older rocks in Greenland and Australia suggests
that life may even be older. One issue in assessing the
exact date is that these rocks were discovered in envi
ronments where life could not have possibly formed,
which suggests that our understanding of how life
emerged is incorrect. Perhaps life can arise in what we
consider inhospitable conditions. On the other hand,
what look like bio-signatures may be generated by
other natural effects such as erosion. Many scientists be
lieve that Martian meteorites, which presumably bear
bio-signatures, fall into this category.
2 Mass Pictures Released
Astronomers just released photographs from the first
near-infrared all-sky survey. The mapping project,
called the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2Mass), began
in 1997. The pictures are online, so anyone can down
load them for analysis. Near-infrared means that these
pictures were taken at wavelengths of light just outside
what the human eye can see. Infrared radiation pene
trates through most dust, which surrounds many stars
and permeates galaxies. "I anticipate that 2MASS will
help answer key questions about local galaxy proper
ties and their distribution," said Martin Weinberg,
from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
where the project is housed.
Investigators Question the Benefits of Gingko
The supplements of gingko, a deciduous tree found in
China, supposedly improve memory. But scientists in
vestigating that claim found little proof of even mild
benefits. They found the plant to have a host of other
effects on the brain, however. For instance, it dilates
blood vessels, thus increasing blood flow to the brain
and lowering blood pressure. It also has antioxidant ef
fects which slow aging. Gingko also enhances the activ
ities of several neurotransmitters, which are the basis
for all kinds of activities associated with the nervous sys
tem. In an article published in Scientific American, re
searchers concluded that "(there is not] enough infor
mation to say conclusively whether gingko does or does
not improve cognition ... but there are enough posi
tive findings, perhaps just enough, to sustain our inter
est in conducting further research on gingko."

vestigating that claim found little proof of even mild
benefits. They found the plant to have a host of other
effects on the brain, however. For instance, it dilates
blood vessels, thus increasing blood flow to the brain
and lowering blood pressure. It also has antioxidant ef
fects which slow aging. Gingko also enhances the activ
ities of several neurotransmitters, which are the basis
for all kinds of activities associated with the nervous sys
tem. In an article published in Scientific American, re
searchers concluded that "(there is not] enough infor
mation to say conclusively whether gingko does or does
not improve cognition ... but there are enough posi
tive findings, perhaps just enough, to sustain our inter
est in conducting further research on gingko."
