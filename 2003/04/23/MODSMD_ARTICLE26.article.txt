# Addressing corporate ethics:
## Dell President Addresses Students 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
During a conference call yesterday,
Dell President and Chief Operating Of
ficer Kevin Rollins talked about the com
pany's corporate ethics. Reporters from
various news outlets at colleges and uni
versities across (he country took part in
the event.
Rollins is responsible for Dell's daily
global operations and, with CEO
Michael Dell, sets the company's strate
gic direction.
"I'd like to talk to folks at the univer
sities across the country," Rollins said in
his opening remarks. "You are the fu
ture of Dell."
Since its inception, Dell has put a lot
of effort in assessing its financial perfor
mance, Rollins said. "There was a great
challenge ahead of us in creating a great
company."
According to Rollins, Dell's statement
of values, the so-called "Soul of Dell,"
manifests itself in the company's corpo
rate ethics.
"We believe in being direct," he said.
"We have a passion in everything we
do."
Rollins indicated that Dell has a work
ing atmosphere in which all 38,000 em
ployees can contribute to the improve
ments in and around the company.
"We have an open-door policy,"
Rollins said. He further explained how
Dell has a hotline dedicated to employee
input, enabling them to communicate
various concerns, like issues such as
work ethics.
Following his opening remarks, The
Daily asked Rollins to comment on how
Dell has been affected by the current
state of the economy.
"Our company has weathered the
downturn," he said, attributing much of
Dell's success to a market share growth
initiative.
Over the past couple of years, the
company has ventured into areas be
yond business and technology. Accord
ing to Rollins, "[Dell] has a large medical
segment today, consisting of healthcare
and medical [related fields]."

Rollins subsequently responded to a
UT-Austin reporter's query regarding
Dell's zero tolerance policy. "We will fire
someone not living up to the standards
that we aspire to as a company," he said.
Rollins credits much of Dell's ethical
values to those held by Thomas Jefier
son.
"When [Thomas Jefferson] lived in
Europe, [he] wanted to create an aristoc
racy of virtues and talent in the United

States," Rollins said. "That is our compa
ny [mission]."
Rollins was adamant on the corporate
ethics issue, believing it to be pivotal in
the success of one company over anoth
er. Technology excluded, if anything
sets Dell apart from others, it's the com
pany culture.
"We launched on this notion of a win
ning culture," he added. "We felt that
our people needed more development

to have higher potential."
The company gives its employees the
opportunity improve themselves via an
array of resources that include mentor
feedback.
"Every culture, gender ... talent has
something to offer," he said.
Aside from corporate ethics, Rollins
said that Dell stresses employee account
ability. "We train our people to be re
sponsible and accountable."
A University of Tennessee reporter
queried Rollins on Dell's involvement in
the community at locations where the
company is based. Rollins explained
how Dell has had programs where it
handles the disposal of old computers —
regardless of the make — and associated
components.
Rollins was also asked to discuss his
experience with company-wide layoffs.
"Whenever you have to have a layoff,
it suggests in some sense that the man
agement has failed to some extent,"
Rollins said. The company did not wit
ness an increase in violations of the com
pany's code of ethics in response to the
layoffs, he added.
Individuals who lost their jobs were
compensated with a severance pay and
counseling. They were given additional
assistance in finding a job.
Rollins was asked to comment on the
effects technology has had on fraud as it
applies to online transactions.
"I think it's a double jagged sword,"
he said. "Technology was a danger in its
early phase but now is a real safeguard."
Rollins finished by explaining what
he believes are winning leadership
styles. He believes there are three — be
lieving your idea is right, the use of
praise and inspiring people to achieve
their full potential.
Though hard to achieve, inspiring
people to achieve their potential is what
Dell strives for, Rollins said. It is arguably
the company's code of ethics and em
ployee relations that have kept Dell at
the forefront of the computer industry.
"We're now not only number one
worldwide, but number one in the U.S.
at the customer level, which includes col
leges," he said.
