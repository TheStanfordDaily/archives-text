# Blogging the war:
## Stanford students share views on war online 
### TAYLOR ALTMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The phenomenon known as blog
ging has given rise to a surge of Weblogs
used as forums for both anti-war and
pro-war sentiments. Many of these blogs
are from the pro-war side and Stanford
students are getting in on the act.
For those not in the know, Weblogs
(or blogs) are a form of online self-pub
lishing for the public, usually free of
charge.
Blogger (www.blogger.com) is a hot
blog-publishing site that provides every
thing you need to start your own
Weblog. Blogs are generally short, easily
updatable posts to a Web site that consist
of commentary, opinions, poetry, pho
tos, diary entries or links to other blogs
or Web sites.
Why are blogs so effective for broad
casting political viewpoints? The answer
is simple: They create their own com
munity through links.
Many student-run blogs, either col
lective or individual, receive a substantial
number of hits each day. Blogs are a
unique and rapid way to reach the entire
Stanford community and beyond. They
have the potential to grow and expand
their readership exponentially over the
course of the next few years. People can
respond to the politically provocative
posts by giving feedback directly on the
blog site.
But there is a difference between so
called warbloggers and those who ex
press political ideas on their sites.
"I do not consider myself a 'warblog
ger,'" said Chris Lin, a sophomore and
ASSU senator. "Warbloggers are gener
ally professional bloggers who write
about their political views fora living."
One student blog caused controversy
between a student and professor. Bo
Cowgill, a senior and ASSU Senate
chair, displayed on bis personal Web site
(www.lKKowgill.com) an essay criticizing
an ant i-war essay written by Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo. Zimbardo's de
fense of his argument was also posted on
the site.

"Fisking" (used by Cowgill in this in
stance) is a technique widely known in
the blogging world. Cowgill defines it on
his site as "[a] thorough and forceful ver
bal beating of an anti-war, possibly anti-
American, commentator [Robert Fisk]
who has richly earned this figurative
beating through his words."
In Fisking, one person can easily cut
and paste another's words onto the blog
alongside the point-by-point counter ar
gument, creating a dialogue between
the two individuals.
Cowgill distinguishes between stu
dents who support the war and real war
mongers." We regretfully accept the
war," he said.
Another site debating foreign and
domestic policy is the Cardinal Collec
tive (http://cardinalcollective.
blogspot.com), which was started by
first-year computer science graduate
student Bob Mc Crew and six friends.
Billed as "the brightest American

thinkers under 40," it is, according to
one of McGrew's postings "sort of an ex
periment: get seven people with widely
differing political views to work on a blog
together and see what comes out."
"So far, it seems to be working pretty
well," McGrew writes on his own blog.
(http://www.stanford.edu/~bmcgrew/).
On the Cardinal Collective, lie con
tinues: "We seven cover pretty much the
entire political spectrum: a libertarian, a
conservative, a neoliberal, a moderate
liberal, a paleoliberal, a radical and an
absurdist. We've got a biologist, a politi
cian, a computer scientist, two philoso
phers, a sociologist of technology and a
professional bon vivant." Almost all of
the bloggers on Cardinal Collective have
their own personal blogs as well. The
Cardinal Collective also contains addi
tional links to student-run political sites,
most of them conservative, including
those of Lin, Cowgill, Will Hudson and
Stanford College Republicans president

Joe Fairbanks.
While blogs establish their own circle,
new voices are always welcome to post
their agreement or dissent.
A recent topic on the Cardinal Collec
tive concerns the special fees collected by
various student organizations, including
The Stanford Daily, Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford, Muslim
Students Awareness Network, Asian
American Student Association, Black
Student Union, Stanford NAACP,
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Azt
lan and Stanford American Indian Or
ganization â€” which the collective says
actively oppose the war.
The majority of the newest posts are
in favor of the campaign launched by the
Stanford College Republicans to en
courage students to request refunds
from these organizations.
"Liberal ideas tend to get more press
and are displayed more often at large
gatherings," Lin said.
