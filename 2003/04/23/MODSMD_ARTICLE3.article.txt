# Students protest Lockheed
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Approximately 50 Stanford students gath
ered yesterday morning at 6 a.m. with hun
dreds of other anti-war activists from around
the Bay Area at the entrances to Lockheed
Mart in Corp.'s Sunnyvale complex to prevent
employees from coming to work and building
"weapons of mass destruction."
Lockheed Martin is the nation's largest
defense contractor.
"Every time a bomb is dropped, a gun
fired, a person killed, Lockheed Martin —
this facility — profits," said senior Valarie
Kaur Brar, an organizer with the Stanford
cluster. "We cannot continue to separate the
work that goes on behind these walls with the
killing of civilian populations. As a student,
an inheritor of this world, I cannot stand
silent as Lockheed Martin manufactures
weapons of mass destruction and threatens
the safety of American citizens and innocent
civilians."
Many of the students at yesterday's
protest were also in San Francisco on Marc h
20, the day after the war in Iraq began. These
students have formed a Stanford c luster with

the community organization South Bay Mo
bilization to Stop the War, along with the
anti-war umbrella organization Direct Ac
tion to Stop the War.
On Sunday, students led a teach-in about
the connection between Lockheed Martin
and the war in Iraq to prepare for the protest,
and on Monday night around 100 activists
from all over the Bay Area stayed in Stanford
residences to be closer to Sunnyv ale.
Yesterday, students assumed roles as legal
observers, spokespeople to the media and lo
gistical coordinators. Others assumed more
ac tive roles as so-called "weapons inspectors"
trying to gain access to Lockheed Martin's fa
cilities and as protesters linked together by
plastic tubing or by their arms, breaking traf
fic laws to keep Lockheed Martin employees
from going to work.
Although there was one minor injury re
ported during the protest, both sides said the
protest had gone without any unanticipated
incidents.
Lockheed Martin maintained a positive
tone about the day.
"I would expect them to respect our rights
