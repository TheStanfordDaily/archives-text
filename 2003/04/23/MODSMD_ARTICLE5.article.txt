# Orientation seeks greater involvement

With the number of applications for fall
Orientation volunteer positions declining,
Orientation coordinators are emphasizing
that being an OV is a "stepping stone lead
ing toward other leadership positions on
campus," hoping to increase interest
among students before the May 1 applica
tion deadline.
"We are pumping this up as a good way
for the upperclassmen to welcome the un
derclassmen," said Head Orientation Co
ordinator Lauren Friedman, a sophomore.
OVs greet new students as they arrive
on campus, help and participate in Orien
tation events and often leave lasting im

pressions on new students.
The past few years have attracted
around 100 volunteers, short of the 120-
volunteer goal, which can make Orienta
tion especially hectic because of the lack of
OVs.
"The job of an OV does require a bit of
a commitment," said New Undergraduate
Student Housing Coordinator Emil Mar
tinsek, a junior. "But the job is very impor
tant. Orientation is the time when you've
got 1,700 students, their parents and their
families on campus. Volunteers must direct
them, get them setded in and help things
run smoothly â€” but this cannot be accom
plished if there aren't enough volunteers."
This year, the structure of the program
is being reformatted to give OVs more re

sponsibility. There will now be a set of 10
head Orientation volunteers who will di
rect a team of OVs under them. Each team
will be in charge of certain orientation ac
tivities.
"Previously, the OVs were just random
ly assigned to different activities," Fried
man said. " This year, we want the volun
teers to become more invested in Orienta
tion."
Orientation will be held Sept. 18 to 23 of
this year, in the second year of its extended,
six-day program. OVs are required to ar
rive on campus on Sept. 15. Orientation
provides room and board for all volunteers
until their regular housing and dining con-
