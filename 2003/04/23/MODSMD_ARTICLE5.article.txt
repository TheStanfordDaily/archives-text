# Orientation seeks greater involvement
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the number of applications for fall
Orientation volunteer positions declining,
Orientation coordinators are emphasizing
that being an OV is a "stepping stone lead
ing toward other leadership positions on
campus," hoping to increase interest
among students before the May 1 applica
tion deadline.
"We are pumping this up as a good way
for the upperclassmen to welcome the un
derclassmen," said Head Orientation Co
ordinator Lauren Friedman, a sophomore.
OVs greet new students as they arrive
on campus, help and participate in Orien
tation events and often leave lasting im

pressions on new students.
The past few years have attracted
around 100 volunteers, short of the 120-
volunteer goal, which can make Orienta
tion especially hectic because of the lack of
OVs.
"The job of an OV does require a bit of
a commitment," said New Undergraduate
Student Housing Coordinator Emil Mar
tinsek, a junior. "But the job is very impor
tant. Orientation is the time when you've
got 1,700 students, their parents and their
families on campus. Volunteers must direct
them, get them setded in and help things
run smoothly — but this cannot be accom
plished if there aren't enough volunteers."
This year, the structure of the program
is being reformatted to give OVs more re

sponsibility. There will now be a set of 10
head Orientation volunteers who will di
rect a team of OVs under them. Each team
will be in charge of certain orientation ac
tivities.
"Previously, the OVs were just random
ly assigned to different activities," Fried
man said. " This year, we want the volun
teers to become more invested in Orienta
tion."
Orientation will be held Sept. 18 to 23 of
this year, in the second year of its extended,
six-day program. OVs are required to ar
rive on campus on Sept. 15. Orientation
provides room and board for all volunteers
until their regular housing and dining con-
tracts begin. Volunteers also get to
move into their residences earl)'.
"I really liked that we got to
move into our dorms early and had
extra time to set up our rooms the
way we wanted," said junior Laura
Pearson, an OV in 2001. "I also
liked meeting the new trosh — they
had lots of energy . I got be one of
the people who welcomed them in,
cheering on Palm Drive. 1 got to go
on the Band run, go to their party
and the other tun stuff.
"This was my first step in becom
ing an RA," continued Pearson,
who is currently a resident assistant
in Otero. "But we also had to work
very hard. We had to wake up early,
stuff folders and set up chairs for
Convocation. But overall, it was a
gr eat experience."
This fall, the Orientation team will
report to the Office of Freshmen
and Transfer Students instead of
the Dean of Students Office, as it has
in past years.
"I have very fond memories of
my own experience as an OV," said
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer
Students Julie Lythcott-Haims,
Class of 1989. "OVs are the greeters
and the bag carriers who make our
new students and parents feel cared
for at Orientation. There is no other
position as important as an OV on
that first day."
