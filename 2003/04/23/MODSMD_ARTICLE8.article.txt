## Court rules on Olympics case 
### 
SAL T LAKE CITY (AP) — A federal appeals court
yesterday reinstated a bribery case against two men
accused of using $ 1 million in enticements to sway In
ternational Olympic Committee delegates to award
Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games.
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
overturned a federaljudge in Utah who threw out the
case in a series of rulings and opinions in 2001. The
three-judge appeals panel unanimously reinstated all
15 felony charges against the two bid executives,
clearing the way fora trial in Utah.
Tom Welch, 58, who was president of the city's bid
and organizing committees, and Dave Johnson, 44,
who was senior vice president, were accused of lavish
ing $ 1 million in cash, gifts and favors on Olympic del
egates.
The scandal was the worst in Olympic history, and
it resulted in the expulsion or resignation of 10 lOC
members who took advantage of Salt Lake's well-doc
umented generosity.
Welch and Johnson were charged by a federal
grand jury with conspiracy, bribery racketeering, and
mail, wire and "honest-services" fraud.
But the charges were thrown out by U.S. District
Judge David Sam, who lambasted the Justice Depart
ment for building a case around an obscure Utah
commercial bribery law.
That law prohibits classic business kickback
schemes.
Sam ruled the law didn't clearly apply to Olympic
bidding.
Justice Department prosecutors who had ap
pealed Sam's ruling felt vindicated yesterday.
"We are gratified that the 10th Circuit agreed with
the government's position, and we look forward to
bringing the case to trial," Justice Department trial at
torney Richard Wiedis said.
Welch's lawyer, William Taylor, said he was disap
pointed.
"We'll study the court's opinion and move for
ward," he said.

commemorate his slaying 1,300 years ago. Crowds exulted in being able to celebrate a rite that
had been suppressed for decades under Saddam Hussein.
