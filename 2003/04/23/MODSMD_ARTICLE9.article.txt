# 1 million Muslims celebrate freedom

KARBALA, Iraq (AP) — Sway
ing and chanting, some bleeding
from self-inflicted wounds of ritual
mourning, an estimated one mil
lion Shiite Muslims marched to
this city's holy shrine yesterday,
celebrating their freedom from
years of repression by Saddam
Hussein's regime.
The large turnout for the pil
grimage, which ends tomorrow,
highlighted the power and poten
tial of Iraq's majority Shiite com
munity. Despite bitter internal dif
ferences the Shiites, who represent
60 percent of Iraq's 24 million
people, were able to pull off the
event on short notice and thus far
without violence.
It showed how once again, up
heaval in a Middle East country
has brought followers of the Shi
ite branch of Islam to the fore
front. It happened in 1979 when
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
founded a Shiite theocracy in
neighboring Iran, and three
years later when Israel invaded
Lebanon, drove out Yasser Arafat
and ended up facing the Shiite
fighters of Hezbollah.
Pilgrims, many with heads
bleeding and limping from long
journeys in 90-degree heat,
pressed up against each other on
roads. U.S. troops were largely out
of sight, with a few members of the
U.S.-backed Iraqi National Con
gress at checkpoints.
The collapse of Saddam's rule
left a political vacuum, "So we
moved in a specialized and orga

nized way to face this problem,"
said a Shiite official, Sheik Sadeq
Jaafar al-Tarfi.
"All the religious leaders, Sis
tani and Sadr, united to make it
successful and had it not been for
this unity it would have failed," he
said, referring to Grand Ayatullah
Ali Hussein al-Sistani, Iraq's top
Shiite cleric, and Muqtada al-Sadr,
the son of al-Sistani's slain prede
cessor.
He said the Hawza al-Ilmiya, a
center of Shiite learning headed by
Sistani in the holy city of Najaf,
sent in thousands of volunteers to
manage security and traffic. Amer
ican troops were ready with food
and water; it wasn't needed. But
Maj. James M. Bozeman, a civil af
fairs officer attached to the 82nd
Airborne Division, said U.S. spe
cial forces treated scores of pil
grims for sprains, cramps and heat
exhaustion.
In addition, the U.S. military
said police on Monday arrested six
men who had been planning to
blow up two of Karbala's mosques.
Five of the detainees claimed to be
members of Saddam's Baath
Party, and one said he belonged to
al-Qaida, said Army Capt. Jimmie
Cummings.
The United States hopes to
work with Shiites to form a new
government without resorting to a
Shiite theocracy like Iran's — a
balancing act that will test the skills
of retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Jay Gar
ner, who is overseeing Iraq's post
war reconstruction.
