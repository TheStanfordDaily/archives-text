## Dixie Chicks still ain't sorry 
### 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Dixie Chicks' lead
singer Natalie Maines says she spoke against President
Bush and war with Iraq last month out of frustration
and regrets her choice of words, but she makes no
apologies for thinking critically.
"I'm not truly embarrassed that, you know, Presi
dent Bush is from my state, that's not really what I care
about," Maines says in an interview with ABC's Diane
Sawyer for "Primetime Thursday," airing 10 p.m.
EDT tonight. "It was the wrong wording with genuine
emotion and questions and concern behind it.. .Am
I sorry that I asked questions and that I just don't fol
low? No."
At a March 10 concert in London, Maines told the
audience in reference to Bush's push for military ac
tion against Iraq: "Just so you know, we're ashamed
the president of the United States is from Texas."
Maines and the Texas-based trio's other
members — Emily Robison and Mai tie Maguire, who
are sisters — also tell Sawyer the fallout was too harsh
for the offense and they've always supported U.S.
troops even though they questioned the war.
"We know some of our fans were shocked and ...
and upset, and we are compassionate to that,"
Maguire said. "My problem is, when does it cross the
line? When is writing a threatening letter OK?"
The interview airs a week before they begin their
U.S. tour May 1 in Greenville, S.C., and they appear
nude on the May 2 issue of Entertainment Weekly,
with epithets such as "Traitors" written on their bodies.
The Dixie Chicks declined a request to be inter
viewed by The Associated Press.
After Maines' remarks, radio stations began boy
cotting the Dixie Chicks, even though she publicly
apologized for her statement in London.
The song "Travelin' Soldier," which was No. 1 on
Billboard's country charts around the time Maines
made the remark, tumbled completely off the charts af
terward. Sales of the group's latest CD, "Home," plum
meted, although sales have rebounded slightly, accord
ing to Nielsen Sound Scan, which tracks music sales.
