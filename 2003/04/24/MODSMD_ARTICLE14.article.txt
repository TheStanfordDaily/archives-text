WASHINGTON (AP) — Not a
member of President Bush's "coali
tion of the willing" on Iraq, Uruguay
President Jorge Batlle yesterday of
fered the United States help with post
war humanitarian aid.
The two leaders, meeting in the
Oval Office for about 40 minutes, also
agreed on efforts to expand trade be
tween their countries. The Bush ad
ministration is involved in 34-nation
talks to create the world's largest free
trade zone, covering the Western
Hemisphere from Alaska to the tip of
South America.
The president also spoke on the
phone with his chief Iraq allies,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar. In the three-way call,
the leaders reviewed postwar hu
manitarian and reconstruction ef
forts and applauded the steps toward
a new Iraqi government represented
by a U.S.-led meeting near Nasiriyah
last week, White House spokesman
Sean McCormack.

They also discussed developments
in the search for Mideast peace — a
topic that was subject of a separate call
by Bush to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
Earlier yesterday, Bush called the
prime minister of Turkey, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan.
The prime minister has gone to
great lengths to maintain the relation
ship since he failed to persuade the
Turkish parliament to allow U.S.
troops to launch attacks against Iraq
from Turkey.
White House spokesman Ari Fleis
cher noted the "strong relations" be
tween the two countries and the pres
ident's thanks that Turkey is resup
plying U.S. troops in northern Iraq
and promising help with Iraq's recon
struction.
Turkish officials say the United
States has asked for peacekeeping
troops and experts to help stabilize
and rebuild Iraq, though no formal
arrangements have been made.
The leaders also talked economics.
