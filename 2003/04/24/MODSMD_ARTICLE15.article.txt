ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) —
Pakistan wants India to participate in a
$2.5 billion natural gas pipeline project
now that tensions between the nuclear
rivals appear to be easing, the foreign
minister said yesterday.
In an interview with The Associated
Press, Kursheed Kasuri said Pakistan
would like India to join the 1,000-mile
central Asia pipeline project in the spir
it of reconciliation started by Indian

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Last week, Vajpayee called for nego
tiations to settle outstanding disputes
between the two nations.
"I would like to say to India: Pak
istan has a vital interest in improving
relations with India," Kasuri said.
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turk
menistan first invited India to join the
pipeline project in February, indicating
the plan would not be economically vi

able without New Delhi's participation.
The project, which will take three
years to complete, is expected to trans
port up to 39.2 billion cubic yards of gas
from the Dauletabad fields in Turk
menistan to consumers in Pakistan,
Afghanistan and India.
India, the main potential buyer of
Turkmen gas, so far has shown little in
terest in participating because of tense
relations with Islamabad.

New Delhi says its main concern is
that the pipeline through Pakistan
would not be safe. Feuding tribes have
attacked a major pipeline in Pakistan
several times.
Kasuri said Pakistan is ready to meet
New Delhi's demands for the pipeline's
security, adding that trade between the
two countries is a good beginning to
improve relations — even without a
settlement in Kashmir.
