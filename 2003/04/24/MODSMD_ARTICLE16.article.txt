## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Upholding the Honor Code 
### 
The following statement should
be familiar to everyone in the
Stanford community. "The
Honor Code is an undertaking
of the students, individually and collec
tively .. . that they will not give or receive
aid in examinations; that they will not give
or receive unpermitted aid in class work,
in the preparation of reports, or in any
other work that is to be used by the in
structor as the basis of grading."
The Honor Code is not only explained
to all freshmen and transfer students upon
their arrival to Stanford but also appears
on the cover of every examination booklet.
Chances are that all Stanford students
have signed their names in acknowledge
ment and acceptance of the Honor Code
within the past few weeks. But it seems that
for many students, signing the blue books
has lost its meaning and has become noth
ing more than a formality.
The Daily reported last week that the
number of Honor Code violations report
ed in winter 2003 rose to 37, from 17 re
ported in winter 2002. While Judicial Af
fairs Program Coordinator George Wil
son told The Daily that he is not sure if the
increase in Honor Code violations reflects
an increase in cheating or that more stu
dents are simply getting caught, the fact of
the matter is that Stanford students are
cheating. And that is a problem, both at
the university level and beyond.
The fact that students on campus are vi
olating the Honor Code goes against the
core value of the Stanford community —
trust. By upholding the Honor Code,
professors do not proctor exams and in
stead place their confidence and faith in
their students to do the same. At some uni
versities, professors not only proctor
exams but also place "undercover stu
dents" in the exam room to catch cheaters.
Is that the kind of environment — one
plagued by distrust and suspicion — we
want at Stanford? Hopefully not.
Moreover, violating the Honor Code
betrays the trust that exists among stu
dents. During an exam, students hold the
mindset that everyone will be fairly as
sessed; this is no longer the case when a
few students decide to cheat. In a class
where the grading is based on a curve,
those who decided not to cheat will be at a
disadvantage. Thus, when some students
fail to hold up their ends of the bargain,
they perform a disservice to the entire stu
dent body. In addition, it goes without
saying that violating the Honor Code goes
against the academic mission of the Uni
versity. Students come to college to learn,

not to copy down information they don't
understand.
But the ramifications of cheating ex
tend outside the Stanford community. It is
not far-fetched to believe that a student
who cheats throughout college will devel
op a habit of cheating in life after college,
when the decisions made and the cheat
ing done can have a devastating impact on
society. In 2002, Americans became all
too-familiar with what happens when de
cision-makers fail to play by the rules.
There cannot be more Enrons and
WorldComs. Thus, it is imperative that
Stanford students — who will become the
leaders of tomorrow — enter the real
world with the abilities to make moral de
cisions. And in order to be able to make
these kinds of decisions in the future, they
must start today.
If students violate the Honor Code for
personal academic achievement now —
many students justify cheating with the
claim that high grades are important —
then what is to stop these very students, in
a few years, from partaking in corporate
accounting scams for personal wealth?
Students must uphold the Honor Code at
this time, not only for the current state of
the University but also for the future of
our society. But there is more to the
Honor Code than just making the indi
vidual choice not to cheat.
Adhering to the Honor Code also
means that students "will do their share
and take an active part in seeing to it that
others as well as themselves uphold the
spirit and letter of the Honor Code." Re
porting a violation of the Honor Code is a
responsibility that students should fulfill.
Such is the case even in the real world,
lake, for example, Susan Watkins and
Cynthia Cooper, who were two of the
three women that Time magazine select
ed as its "Persons of the Year" for 2002.
Watkins is the Enron vice president who
wrote a letter to Enron chairman Kenneth
Lay warning him about Enron's improp
er accounting methods. Cooper informed
the World Com board that the company
had covered up $3.8 billion in losses. It
may be difficult to report cheating but it is
the best way to ensure fairness for all.
Upholding the Honor Code is an obli
gation that students, as members of the
Stanford community and of society at
large, should fulfill. As students are busy
studying for midterms and writing papers
around this time of the year, they make
many sacrifices, including sleep and so
cializing with friends. One's morals, how
ever, should never be forfeited.
