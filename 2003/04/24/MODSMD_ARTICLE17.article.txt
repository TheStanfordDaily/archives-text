The Daily needs to cover the
women's golf team
The members of the Stanford
women's golf team applaud the
fine coverage of the men's golf
tournament by The Daily this
past weekend. However, the
quality and quantity of the re
porting only makes it all the
more surprising and disappoint
ing that The Daily failed even to
mention the women's team's
only home tournament in the
spring, the Peg Barnard Colle
giate, which took place the week
end before.
We believe that the Stanford
community expects better infor
mation regarding athletic
events, especially when the team
is in season and the event takes
place on campus. Better support
in the future would be much ap
preciated.
