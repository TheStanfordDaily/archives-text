# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Loveable hate mail 
### 
Had an alien from a dis
tant planet had the op
portunity to read some
of the e-mail responses
to my column last week against
ethnic theme houses, he would've
concluded that I possess some
magical power of making people
truly angry.
What a power indeed. I was
able to make a graduate student's
"blood boil" and another woman
wasn't sure "whether my column
was a joke or what... [after all
that] crap [I] spewed." Someone
also made sure to let me know that
what I wrote was enough to "get
[me] kicked out of journalism
school." Thankfully, at least I'll get
my undergraduate degree in a few
weeks.
I'll let you in on a little secret
The Daily doesn't want you to
know: Columnists need love more
than furbies need batteries. Each
week we slave away unpaid and
unfed in the dark dungeons of the
Storke Publications Building in
order to share our prose with
thousands of students who usually
flip through these very pages
faster than they can finish their
stale pizza at Bon Appetite.
The sad reality is that every
one says they read our columns
but few write back. Week after
week, the five of us put our hearts
out to our readers but we get lit
tle back in the form of e-mails or
letters to the editor.
Thus we resort to hot topics,
quick sentences, catchy titles.
Less Thoreau, more Tom Clancy.
A Daily column isn't, after all, a
face-to-face conversation but
rather a chance fora writer to ex
press his or her opinions in ap
proximately 700 words, knowing
that nobody can interrupt; it had
better be exciting.
But last week was quite differ
ent.
I must admit that the sheer vol

ume of support and criticism I re
ceived was enough to make any
columnist smile; I've received
about 40 individual e-mails from
students, professors and adminis
trators. Six of those letters have
been published in The Daily. One
concerned student even forward
ed his critique of my column to all
the residents of Ujamaa.
What's even more impressive is

that the vast ma
jority of messages
I received weren't
closed-minded
and bitter like the
ones I cited at the
beginning of this
column. Rather,
each was an hon
est effort to en-

gage in discussion. Some wrote
back to share first-hand experi
ences of theme-house living. Oth
ers wanted to check if I knew cer
tain facts about theme house de
mographics, like the fact that only
50 percent of the residents of an
ethnic theme house are of that des
ignated ethnicity. And although I
haven't changed my mind about
not supporting ethnic theme
houses, I've become increasingly
aware of the reasons why many
people decide to draw into them.
One of the most surprising sto
ries I heard was that of a white stu
dent who was randomly assigned
to a theme house. While he had
never taken interest in his own
family's history, culture and com
munal history, he became acutely
aware of how important it was for
so many residents of his house.
That same month, he called home
and began questioning his parents
about his family's heritage and
what it meant to be an Irish Amer
ican. This story allowed me to ap
preciate for the first time the possi
bility of a randomly assigned stu
dent benefiting from an ethnic
theme house for completely un

predictable reasons.
On the other hand, some of the
feedback I received seemed to
marginalize the role of student
opinion outside of ethnic theme
houses. A claim I heard numerous
times is that only residents of eth
nic theme houses are qualified to
make critical statements against
them. Since when does this logic
apply to the real world? This rea
soning is like assuming U.S. citi
zens can't critique Congress be
cause most of them have never
spent time in Washington, D.C.
But perhaps the most interest
ing thing I learned last week is that
the Stanford community does,
after all, possess a strong and im
passioned voice —it just took a
strongly phrased opinion piece to
bring it out. The experience of
sharing strong views with a com
munity of thousands and receiving
intelligent and focused messages
(and only a limited number of hate
e-mails back) is perhaps what lies
at the essence of the Stanford com
munity. I can't help but think that
the world might be a slightly better
place if everyone would just talk
and listen like we do here on the
Farm. Maybe more people would
actually respect the United Na
tions instead of viewing it as a
forum for the biggest powers to do
their bidding.
So as for me, I'll continue to
write as long as you'll keep on
reading and engaging these issues
with your friends and others. You
might even surprise yourself by
honestly considering a unique
opinion from someone you've
never spoken with before. And yes,
the amazing power to make a
reader's "blood-boil" that I
learned I possess last week makes
me smile. Who knew that hate mail
could be so damn fun?

Had an alien from a dis
tant planet had the op
portunity to read some
of the e-mail responses
to my column last week against
ethnic theme houses, he would've
concluded that I possess some
magical power of making people
truly angry.
What a power indeed. I was
able to make a graduate student's
"blood boil" and another woman
wasn't sure "whether my column
was a joke or what... [after all
that] crap [I] spewed." Someone
also made sure to let me know that
what I wrote was enough to "get
[me] kicked out of journalism
school." Thankfully, at least I'll get
my undergraduate degree in a few
weeks.
I'll let you in on a little secret
The Daily doesn't want you to
know: Columnists need love more
than furbies need batteries. Each
week we slave away unpaid and
unfed in the dark dungeons of the
Storke Publications Building in
order to share our prose with
thousands of students who usually
flip through these very pages
faster than they can finish their
stale pizza at Bon Appetite.
The sad reality is that every
one says they read our columns
but few write back. Week after
week, the five of us put our hearts
out to our readers but we get lit
tle back in the form of e-mails or
letters to the editor.
Thus we resort to hot topics,
quick sentences, catchy titles.
Less Thoreau, more Tom Clancy.
A Daily column isn't, after all, a
face-to-face conversation but
rather a chance fora writer to ex
press his or her opinions in ap
proximately 700 words, knowing
that nobody can interrupt; it had
better be exciting.
But last week was quite differ
ent.
I must admit that the sheer vol

ume of support and criticism I re
ceived was enough to make any
columnist smile; I've received
about 40 individual e-mails from
students, professors and adminis
trators. Six of those letters have
been published in The Daily. One
concerned student even forward
ed his critique of my column to all
the residents of Ujamaa.
What's even more impressive is

that the vast ma
jority of messages
I received weren't
closed-minded
and bitter like the
ones I cited at the
beginning of this
column. Rather,
each was an hon
est effort to en-

gage in discussion. Some wrote
back to share first-hand experi
ences of theme-house living. Oth
ers wanted to check if I knew cer
tain facts about theme house de
mographics, like the fact that only
50 percent of the residents of an
ethnic theme house are of that des
ignated ethnicity. And although I
haven't changed my mind about
not supporting ethnic theme
houses, I've become increasingly
aware of the reasons why many
people decide to draw into them.
One of the most surprising sto
ries I heard was that of a white stu
dent who was randomly assigned
to a theme house. While he had
never taken interest in his own
family's history, culture and com
munal history, he became acutely
aware of how important it was for
so many residents of his house.
That same month, he called home
and began questioning his parents
about his family's heritage and
what it meant to be an Irish Amer
ican. This story allowed me to ap
preciate for the first time the possi
bility of a randomly assigned stu
dent benefiting from an ethnic
theme house for completely un

predictable reasons.
On the other hand, some of the
feedback I received seemed to
marginalize the role of student
opinion outside of ethnic theme
houses. A claim I heard numerous
times is that only residents of eth
nic theme houses are qualified to
make critical statements against
them. Since when does this logic
apply to the real world? This rea
soning is like assuming U.S. citi
zens can't critique Congress be
cause most of them have never
spent time in Washington, D.C.
But perhaps the most interest
ing thing I learned last week is that
the Stanford community does,
after all, possess a strong and im
passioned voice —it just took a
strongly phrased opinion piece to
bring it out. The experience of
sharing strong views with a com
munity of thousands and receiving
intelligent and focused messages
(and only a limited number of hate
e-mails back) is perhaps what lies
at the essence of the Stanford com
munity. I can't help but think that
the world might be a slightly better
place if everyone would just talk
and listen like we do here on the
Farm. Maybe more people would
actually respect the United Na
tions instead of viewing it as a
forum for the biggest powers to do
their bidding.
So as for me, I'll continue to
write as long as you'll keep on
reading and engaging these issues
with your friends and others. You
might even surprise yourself by
honestly considering a unique
opinion from someone you've
never spoken with before. And yes,
the amazing power to make a
reader's "blood-boil" that I
learned I possess last week makes
me smile. Who knew that hate mail
could be so damn fun?
