# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford needs ROTC to train leaders, teach discipline 
### 
JEFFREY C. NEEDHAM
GUEST COLUMNIST
As a journalist and future Naval Re
serve Officers Training Corps mid
shipman at the University of
Kansas, I have a number of
grievances with John Martin's guest col
umn, "Under Bush administration, ROTC
is not admirable program" (April 22).
First, Martin states that "the Bush admin
istration is both irrational and bent on world
domination." What is irrational is waiting
fora madman to attack you first. Martin also
states that militarily, Iraq did not pose a
threat to the security of the United States.
Perhaps that is true But he does not account
for the fact that it did not take an army to kill
3,000 innocent American civilians in down
town Manhattan.
Martin also states that multinational cor
porations seek to gain control of Iraq's vast
oil supply. I am eager to point out to him
that France and Russia have much more sig
nificant economic ties to Iraq than the Unit

ed States does. They are the obstructionists
of war who did not want their economic in
terests toppled along with Saddam Hus
sein's regime. They had much to lose eco
nomically, not the United States.
Martin then goes on to state that the U.S.-
led war against Iraq is "opposed by a major
ity of people in virtually every country on
this planet" Since when does the rest of the
world, who is misinformed by its own leftist
propaganda media, indicative of the legiti
macy of the U.S. cause in Iraq? Martin also
writes that the U.S. military "did not protect
schools so that children could resume their
education." I think that the Iraqi children
could wait a little bit longer to go back to
school while we make sure that we are en
tirely secure of the country first. We don't
need to start securing Iraqi rights before
American serviceman and women have
their lives secured.
I agree with Martin on one thing. He is
right about the aims of this war. This war
was aimed to eliminate Hussein, a goal that
was clearly identified by the Bush adininis

tration in its intricate pre-war planning. The
objectives of the war were made very clearly
to the public as well. Martin writes in this
guest column, "Also consider this statistic:
Bush's proposed tax cut will add to the
wealth of the rich." What does his guest col
umn have to do with the Bush tax cut? Mar
tin's opinion of the Bush tax plan is not per
tinent to the central point in his column. He
then proceeds to condemn the Bush admin
istration by describing them as "evangelical
Christian fundamentalists." Since when
does being guided by moral and ethical tra
ditions a harmful policy? Liberals treat God
fearing people like dirt while praising the
ultra-liberal socialists who condemn morali
ty and all that is just.
Martin then continues his ambiguous ar
gument to try to convince his readers that
his argument is somehow substantial be
cause he has a lot of documents that we need
to study and "check out" so that we can be
lieve his misguided opinion. Martin obvi
ously also doesn't understand history either.
There was no agreement between U.S. Pres

ident John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev during the
Cuban Missile Crisis. There was no commu
nication between the two, no direct line be
tween these two superpowers. There was no
diplomacy, just absolute horror and antici
pation that the other might at any moment
push the fatal button. Martin is terribly mis
guided to point out the Cuban Missile Crisis
as some sort of pinnacle of diplomacy be
tween the Soviet Union and United States. I
even venture far enough to call Martin trea
sonous to draw parallels between the U.S.
military and Nazi Germany and the Sept. 11
terrorists.
Lastly, Martin decides to come back to the
main point of his guest column, ROTC.
How can Martin suggest that ROTC cadets
somehow go against the oath that they have
taken voluntarily to uphold? Martin has no
basis for asking this question, and only at an
institution where ROTC is not housed on
campus can he make this statement and not
be completely annihilated by the
opposition and those who truly
understand the benefits and great
training provided in ROTC. Mar
tin is right that we need to make a
concerted effort to understand the
country's leaders. But if only those
misinformed people such as Mar
tin could understand the country's
leaders would they be able under
stand that the United States is
being led in the light direction by

an able, diverse and moral leader
ship.
Stanford needs to reexamine its
policy of ROTC very closely. It was
abandoned in the late 1960s when
war protesters actually had a legit
imate complaint with the military.
But today it needs to find a new
home again at Stanford in order to
ensure that students can have the
same kind of leadership training
and lessons in discipline that I will
be participating in at the Universi
ty of Kansas.
