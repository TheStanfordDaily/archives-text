# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Turkey must officially recognize the Armenian Genocide 
### 
CHRIS GUZEUAN
GUEST COLUMNIST
In 1915, 1.5 million Armenian citizens
of Ottoman Turkey perished.
Mass death in World War 1 was no
anomaly, of course. Had foreign attackers
massacred these Armenians as part of the
wider war, historians might show thrift in
spilling ink to describe near-extinction of a
lesser-known race of farmers and mer
chants. Had plague or famine broken out,
1.5 million Armenians lost would be as in
consequential to humanity's collective
consciousness as apparently are the mil
lion Eritreans who died between 1984 and
1985 from war-related famine. But for the
1.5 million fallen Armenians, invaders and
pestilence cannot be blamed. Today, April
24, is Armenian Genocide Remembrance
Day, so named because Armenians' own
Turkish brethren were the butchers.
Among forms of mass death, systematic
ethnic killings evoke exceptional sympa

thetic remembrance. The Holocaust, the
Khmer Rouge's Cambodian killing fields,
the 1992 Bosnian atrocities, the 1994
Rwandan Genocide and the Kurds in
modern-day Turkey, all evidence this gen
eral principle. But this axiom of global rec
ollection does not hold for the forgotten
Armenians.
That we lack recollection of the Armeni
ans is not an accidental by-product of his
tory's unkind whirlwind. Rather it stems
from active suppression by Turkey. Even
now, 88 years later, Turkey disputes
that"genocide" — systematic, widespread,
ethnically motivated killings — occurred.
It debates scores of eyewitness and survivor
accounts of horrors that spattered the Ana
tolian plateau in tears, misery and blood. It
denigrates the extensive documentation of
organized tortures, murders, rapes, beat
ings and property seizure. It denies Arme
nians were crucified alive on the doors of
village churches. It dismisses as mirages
the countless columns of Armenians shep

herded at fixed bayonet point without food
or water to their collapse into the searing
Syrian Desert.
I could continue. But The Daily is not
the forum fora general account of 1915.
Instead, I want to tell you about my
great-grandparents, Mike and Dorothy
Gibilian. Mike, to avoid certain death,
was hidden by sympathetic neighbors
and bribed his way out of the country on
a transport ship. The same day, Turkish
gendarmes bayoneted Dorothy's two in
fant boys before her eyes, then captured
and forced her extended family on a
death march for hundreds of miles into
Syria. Only she survived. Mike and
Dorothy reunited after six years apart.
For Armenians, their tale is among the
happiest from 1915.
Tomorrow some of my Stanford Turk
ish friends will respond unfavorably to this
essay, as they have in past years. They will
explain that an Armenian archimage and
his fabricating wand are at it once more,

waving up a fairy tale portrayal. The re
sponse predictably will brim with annoy
ance and exasperation at my words. But
what we will not read in this response is a
direct rebuttal of my family's suffering, for
no one can deny that truth. And if you ask
any other Armenian whose family lived in
Turkey in 1915, each will offer a similar
truth. Collectively, humanity rightfully
calls these truths "genocide."
So, my Turkish friends, before you
rush to set enraged ink to page, please re
alize that an 88th year of general recrimi
nations is not the appropriate response to
my family's tale. Please understand anoth
er year of unfounded general denials
helps only to send the Gibilian's truth to
history's backwaters, something any stu
dent at a university so renowned as this
one could possibly tolerate in our mutual
pledge of objectivity. Please consider that
our joint failure to come to proper com
mon understanding about the Gibilians is
akin to declaring their lives irrelevant, to

metaphorically stomping upon their trag
ic graves, to a willful closure of our eyes to
truth, however unpleasant it may be.
This year, the Armenian Genocide
reaches its 88th mark without Turkish af
firmation. The perpetrators have per
ished, the victims vanished, the memories
faded. Truth will not live if only the pow
erless have the strength to shoulder it.
Turkey has the power to change all this, to
set things right for all time. Acknowledg
ment of now-distant wrongs is not weak
ness — it is the magnificent evolution of
Turkish society.
li is (he strength to overcome ancestors'
fallibility and heralds a day when we Ar
menians and Turks — brothers and sis
ters of the same ancient mother Anatolia
— live, laugh and embrace harmoniously
again. I look forward to that day on this
Remembrance Day.

explain that an Armenian archimage and
his fabricating wand are at it once more,

waving up a fairy tale portrayal. The re
sponse predictably will brim with annoy
ance and exasperation at my words. But
what we will not read in this response is a
direct rebuttal of my family's suffering, for
no one can deny that truth. And if you ask
any other Armenian whose family lived in
Turkey in 1915, each will offer a similar
truth. Collectively, humanity rightfully
calls these truths "genocide."
So, my Turkish friends, before you
rush to set enraged ink to page, please re
alize that an 88th year of general recrimi
nations is not the appropriate response to
my family's tale. Please understand anoth
er year of unfounded general denials
helps only to send the Gibilian's truth to
history's backwaters, something any stu
dent at a university so renowned as this
one could possibly tolerate in our mutual
pledge of objectivity. Please consider that
our joint failure to come to proper com
mon understanding about the Gibilians is
akin to declaring their lives irrelevant, to

metaphorically stomping upon their trag
ic graves, to a willful closure of our eyes to
truth, however unpleasant it may be.
This year, the Armenian Genocide
reaches its 88th mark without Turkish af
firmation. The perpetrators have per
ished, the victims vanished, the memories
faded. Truth will not live if only the pow
erless have the strength to shoulder it.
Turkey has the power to change all this, to
set things right for all time. Acknowledg
ment of now-distant wrongs is not weak
ness — it is the magnificent evolution of
Turkish society.
li is (he strength to overcome ancestors'
fallibility and heralds a day when we Ar
menians and Turks — brothers and sis
ters of the same ancient mother Anatolia
— live, laugh and embrace harmoniously
again. I look forward to that day on this
Remembrance Day.
