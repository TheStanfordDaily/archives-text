## Card tries for Super Six win 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With just three days left in the women's gymnastics
season, No. 6 Stanford (11-2-1,4-1-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) travels to Lincoln, Neb. ready to give it the
old college try at the NCAA Championships.
"Our goal is always to have our best day on the last
day of the year," coach Kristen Smyth said.
What's surprising about the 2003 team is that, de
spite storming out of the gates in January and deliv
ering the strongest regular-season showing of all the
Pac-10 teams, the squad keeps improving. At this rate,
there's no telling what Stanford can accomplish dur
ing the next three days of competition.
"We couldn't be in a better position," Smyth said.
"We're healthy and have high energy right now with
12 athletes ready to step in and compete wherever
needed.
"That's a big success in and of itself: starting and
ending our season with 12 healthy athletes."
In her second year at the helm, Smyth has built un
precedented depth on all four events, making the
Cardinal a force to be reckoned with at NCAAs. The
team's hope is to build off of last year's first-ever Super
Six appearance, but the road won't be an easy one.
"I know we are capable of making it to Super Six
and coming in the top three, but will have to all come
together and compete with everything we have,"
freshman Natalie Foley said.
The Cardinal earned its bid to nationals after de
livering a solid performance at the North Central Re
gional on April 12, taking second-place to No. 8 Utah
and securing the chance to compete with the top 12
teams in the country at NCAAs. Foley highlighted
Stanford's tour de force, earning top honors on the
vaulting table and taking second in the all-around.
"Regionals was a good meet, but not a great meet
for us," Smyth said. "We still have a lot of room for im
provement. Our energy was good and we had a great
beam rotation with [senior Kelsey Stillinger] hitting in
the anchor spot and the freshmen posted great per
formances on that event as well."
A hallmark of this year's squad has been its unwa
vering focus, which was showcased during regionals
when the uneven bars uncharacteristically broke just
as the Cardinal was about to begin its performance on

Junior Caroline Fluhrer, who scored a 9.825 in the second rotation at the North Central Re
gionais earlier this week, will look to lead the Cardinal to a Super Six birth.
