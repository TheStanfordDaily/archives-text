## Card tries for Super Six win 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With just three days left in the women's gymnastics
season, No. 6 Stanford (11-2-1,4-1-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) travels to Lincoln, Neb. ready to give it the
old college try at the NCAA Championships.
"Our goal is always to have our best day on the last
day of the year," coach Kristen Smyth said.
What's surprising about the 2003 team is that, de
spite storming out of the gates in January and deliv
ering the strongest regular-season showing of all the
Pac-10 teams, the squad keeps improving. At this rate,
there's no telling what Stanford can accomplish dur
ing the next three days of competition.
"We couldn't be in a better position," Smyth said.
"We're healthy and have high energy right now with
12 athletes ready to step in and compete wherever
needed.
"That's a big success in and of itself: starting and
ending our season with 12 healthy athletes."
In her second year at the helm, Smyth has built un
precedented depth on all four events, making the
Cardinal a force to be reckoned with at NCAAs. The
team's hope is to build off of last year's first-ever Super
Six appearance, but the road won't be an easy one.
"I know we are capable of making it to Super Six
and coming in the top three, but will have to all come
together and compete with everything we have,"
freshman Natalie Foley said.
The Cardinal earned its bid to nationals after de
livering a solid performance at the North Central Re
gional on April 12, taking second-place to No. 8 Utah
and securing the chance to compete with the top 12
teams in the country at NCAAs. Foley highlighted
Stanford's tour de force, earning top honors on the
vaulting table and taking second in the all-around.
"Regionals was a good meet, but not a great meet
for us," Smyth said. "We still have a lot of room for im
provement. Our energy was good and we had a great
beam rotation with [senior Kelsey Stillinger] hitting in
the anchor spot and the freshmen posted great per
formances on that event as well."
A hallmark of this year's squad has been its unwa
vering focus, which was showcased during regionals
when the uneven bars uncharacteristically broke just
as the Cardinal was about to begin its performance on

Junior Caroline Fluhrer, who scored a 9.825 in the second rotation at the North Central Re
gionais earlier this week, will look to lead the Cardinal to a Super Six birth.
the apparatus.
"We all pulled together and
overcame the obstacles in our way
at Regionals, especially the bars
breaking," Foley said.
Smyth added, "I was so im
pressed with how the girls stayed
composed and focused when the
bars broke and they ended up
competing by themselves in front
of 5,000 people. They hit six-for
six routines and were unfazed,
which showed me how mentally
tough this team is."
Stanford will draw on that men
tal toughness and on the numer
ous man-hours logged since Sep
tember in the gym to close out this
season with another history-mak
ing performance.
The Cardinal is up against for
midable foes, however, as nine of
the teams left in competition are
ranked in the top 10. Stanford will
first battle against No. 2 Nebraska
(which will undoubtedly be taking
advantage of the home-gym ad
vantage during the meet), No. 9
Florida, No. 17 Auburn, No. 4
Georgia, and the Utes on Thurs

day night for one of the top-three
spots to repeat their 2002 Super
Six appearance.
The Cardinal will rely on junior
Lise Leveille and Foley to continue
delivering on all events, as the duo
is currently ranked 14th and 13th,
respectively, in the all-around.
Junior Lindsay Wing will likely
contend for the balance beam title
on Saturday night and is currently
ranked No. 2 nationally on the ap
paratus.
Foley holds the 11 th ranking on
bars and junior Caroline Fluhrer -
whose vault score at nationals last
season secured Stanford's Super
Six berth — is ranked 20th on the
event.
The main challenge posed at
nationals is the potential for three
days of competition — two days of
team matchups and one night of
individual event finals. But the
Cardinal roster has been waiting
for this day all year, keeping in
mind the motto that hangs in their
gym: All it takes is all you've got.
"There are only 12 teams left in
the country that still get the
chance to compete, and it's great
to be a part of that field," Smyth
said. "But now we want to make
something happen with this op
portunity."
