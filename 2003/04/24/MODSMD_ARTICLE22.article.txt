# Men's tennis looks to individual tourney
## Propelled by Corkery, Warburg and Pade, Cardinal confident after win over UCLA 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Riding on the high of last Friday's confer
ence-clinching triumph over No. 4 UCLA (20-
3, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference), the No. 3 Stan
ford men's tennis team (21-3, 7-0 Pac-10) will
travel to Ojai, Ca. this weekend to begin post
season play in the Pac-10 individual champi
onships .
"There's no question that UCLA is one of
the teams that absolutely has a chance to win
the NCAA Championship," head coach Dick
Gould said. "We've beaten some pretty good
teams like USC, Pepperdine and Tulane, and

we've beaten them pretty badly.
"But it's a little different when you're play
ing one of the very best teams. To beat UCLA
at UCLA is something that in my 37 years
we've done very rarely. It's really an achieve
ment."
Associate head coach John Whitlinger
agreed.
"The win at UCLA and taking home the
conference crown will hopefully send a mes
sage around the country that yes, we lost a
very good player in Ryan Haviland, but you
know what?" Whitlinger said. "We've got
other guys stepping up and doing the job.
We're still a force to be reckoned with."
A positive sign for the Cardinal is that it has
played better as the regular season has pro
gressed, tallying its most impressive victories
in the last few weeks.
"It's always been our M.O. here at Stanford
to be constantly improving over the course of

the season," Whitlinger said. "I think what this
win does for me and the rest of the guys, it
shows that we can beat anybody on a given
day.
"I think the guys have a lot of confidence in
one another now. The team's really coming
together."
A big part of the Cardinal's success this sea
son has been its strength in the middle of the
lineup.
"At three, four and five this year, we've
been incredible," Whitlinger said.
Freshman KC Corkery, sophomore Sam
Warburg and freshman James Fade have
combined to post a 60-6 win-loss record in
dual matches.
Corkery and Warburg are in the midst of
putting together two of the best single season
dual-match records in Stanford history. Cork-
ery's 18-1 record and Warburg's
21-2 record currently rank Bth
and 11th, respectively, in terms of
win percentage.
The Pac-10 individual cham
pionships will take place between
Thursday and Sunday. The
event is made up of two flights —
championship and invitational —
with a 32-player singles draw and
16-team doubles draw in each
flight.
" It's a nice change of pace from
all the dual matches," Gould said.
"It's a little more relaxed at
mosphere. It's really a tourna
ment for the guys without any
team pressures.
"Coach Whitlinger and myself
will be there to help if guys ask for
it, but we won't be holding their
hands during changeovers. It's
good to let loose a little bit."
In the championship flight,
Stanford has entered senior Ail-
Americans Scott Lipsky and
David Martin, Warburg and
Corkery in singles. The Cardi
nal's doubles entrants are Lipsky
and Martin (ranked No. 2 nation
ally) and Corkery and Pade.
In the invitational flight, the
Cardinal will send junior Carter
Morris, junior Joe Kao, sopho
more Phil Sheng and Pade to
compete in singles. Stanford's
No. 3 duo of Morris and Warburg
and the No. 4 tandem of Kao and
Sheng will be the doubles en
trants.
This weekend will provide the
opportunity for some of the Cardi
nal players to strengthen their cases
for selection into the NCAA individ
ual and doubles championships.
At No. 12 in the nation, Martin
can be considered the only lock for
selection into the 64-player singles
field. No. 56 Lipsky, No. 47 Cork
ery and No. 52 Warburg are all on
the bubble and this weekend will
be their last chance to improve
their rankings.
"Hopefully down there, some

of our guys will get some positive
results that will help them tor
NCAA selection purposes," Gould
said. "It's a great chance for some
one who's not number one on the
team to play another team's num

ber one or two player.
"But mostly this weekend is a
chance to get some matches in so
that we can stay sharp because we
have a two-week break after it's
over before NCAA regionals."

together."
A big part of the Cardinal's success this sea
son has been its strength in the middle of the
lineup.
"At three, four and five this year, we've
been incredible," Whitlinger said.
Freshman KC Corkery, sophomore Sam
Warburg and freshman James Fade have
combined to post a 60-6 win-loss record in
dual matches.
Corkery and Warburg are in the midst of
putting together two of the best single season
dual-match records in Stanford history. Cork-
ery's 18-1 record and Warburg's
21-2 record currently rank Bth
and 11th, respectively, in terms of
win percentage.
The Pac-10 individual cham
pionships will take place between
Thursday and Sunday. The
event is made up of two flights —
championship and invitational —
with a 32-player singles draw and
16-team doubles draw in each
flight.
" It's a nice change of pace from
all the dual matches," Gould said.
"It's a little more relaxed at
mosphere. It's really a tourna
ment for the guys without any
team pressures.
"Coach Whitlinger and myself
will be there to help if guys ask for
it, but we won't be holding their
hands during changeovers. It's
good to let loose a little bit."
In the championship flight,
Stanford has entered senior Ail-
Americans Scott Lipsky and
David Martin, Warburg and
Corkery in singles. The Cardi
nal's doubles entrants are Lipsky
and Martin (ranked No. 2 nation
ally) and Corkery and Pade.
In the invitational flight, the
Cardinal will send junior Carter
Morris, junior Joe Kao, sopho
more Phil Sheng and Pade to
compete in singles. Stanford's
No. 3 duo of Morris and Warburg
and the No. 4 tandem of Kao and
Sheng will be the doubles en
trants.
This weekend will provide the
opportunity for some of the Cardi
nal players to strengthen their cases
for selection into the NCAA individ
ual and doubles championships.
At No. 12 in the nation, Martin
can be considered the only lock for
selection into the 64-player singles
field. No. 56 Lipsky, No. 47 Cork
ery and No. 52 Warburg are all on
the bubble and this weekend will
be their last chance to improve
their rankings.
"Hopefully down there, some

of our guys will get some positive
results that will help them tor
NCAA selection purposes," Gould
said. "It's a great chance for some
one who's not number one on the
team to play another team's num

ber one or two player.
"But mostly this weekend is a
chance to get some matches in so
that we can stay sharp because we
have a two-week break after it's
over before NCAA regionals."
