## Propelled by Corkery, Warburg and Pade, Cardinal confident after win over UCLA 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Riding on the high of last Friday's confer
ence-clinching triumph over No. 4 UCLA (20-
3, 6-1 Pacific-10 Conference), the No. 3 Stan
ford men's tennis team (21-3, 7-0 Pac-10) will
travel to Ojai, Ca. this weekend to begin post
season play in the Pac-10 individual champi
onships .
"There's no question that UCLA is one of
the teams that absolutely has a chance to win
the NCAA Championship," head coach Dick
Gould said. "We've beaten some pretty good
teams like USC, Pepperdine and Tulane, and

we've beaten them pretty badly.
"But it's a little different when you're play
ing one of the very best teams. To beat UCLA

we've done very rarely. It's really an achieve

Associate head coach John Whitlinger
agreed.
"The win at UCLA and taking home the
conference crown will hopefully send a mes

very good player in Ryan Haviland, but you
know what?" Whitlinger said. "We've got
other guys stepping up and doing the job.
We're still a force to be reckoned with."
A positive sign for the Cardinal is that it has
played better as the regular season has pro
gressed, tallying its most impressive victories
in the last few weeks.
"It's always been our M.O. here at Stanford
to be constantly improving over the course of

the season," Whitlinger said. "I think what this
win does for me and the rest of the guys, it
shows that we can beat anybody on a given
day.
"I think the guys have a lot of confidence in
one another now. The team's really coming
together."
A big part of the Cardinal's success this sea
son has been its strength in the middle of the
lineup.
"At three, four and five this year, we've
been incredible," Whitlinger said.
Freshman KC Corkery, sophomore Sam
Warburg and freshman James Fade have
combined to post a 60-6 win-loss record in
dual matches.
Corkery and Warburg are in the midst of
putting together two of the best single season
dual-match records in Stanford history. Cork-
