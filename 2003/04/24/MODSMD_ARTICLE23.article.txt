# Cardinal defeats Cal for 16th-straight title
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In the past 16 years, 10 different
NFL teams have captured a Super
Bowl tide, Michael Jordan has re
tired three times and three U.S.
presidents have been inaugurated
into office. Yet throughout that pe
riod, there has been only one Pacif
ic-10 conference champion in
women's tennis — Stanford.
On Tuesday at the Hellman
Tennis Complex in Berkeley, the
No. 2 Cardinal (20-1, 8-0 Pacific-10
Conference) claimed its 16th
straight conference title with a 4-3
squeaker over cross-bay rival, No. 4
California(l9-5,6-2 Pac-10) and so
lidified its place as a top contender
for the NCAA Championship.
The day began with remarkably
even matchups at all three doubles
positions. The Cardinal found itself
in trouble after its No. 3 doubles
team of junior co-captain Kmilia An
derson and sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates fell to Nicole
Havlicek and Catherine Lynch, 8-3.
But Stanford bounced back, as

the No. 2 doubles team in the nation
of junior co-captain Lauren
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette defeated the team of
Christina Fusano and Raquel Kops-
Jones, ranked fourth nationally, in a
closely contested batde, 8-6.
The Stanford freshman duo of
Barnes and Amber Liu snuck by
Jieun Jacobs and Jody Scheldt, 9-7,
and the Cardinal claimed the crucial
point.
Yet the closeness and intensity of
competition in the doubles was just
a fraction of the excitement that
would play out in singles.
The only lopsided match oc
curred at No. 6 singles, as Tweedie-
Y ates, who has been playing some of
her best tennis as of late, crushed
Br<x)ke Borisoff, 6-0,6-2.
Scheldt beat Anderson, 6-1,6-2,
at No. 5 singles to claim the first Cal
point of the day, but Barnes quick-
ly put the Cardinal ahead, 3-1, with a 6-4, 6-2 victory
over Jacobs. With the win, Barnes impressively fin
ished her Pac-10 singles season undefeated with an 8-
0 record and the entire dual match season with a 20-0
record.
Stanford could not hold its lead, however, as Cal
clawed back to even the match at 3-3. First. Fusano de
feated Barnikow, 6-1, 7-6 (4), at the No. 2 singles posi
tion.
Then, in a hard-fought, near-even matchup, Liu fell
to Kops-Jonesat No. 1 singles.
The outcome of the match then depended solely on
the No. 3 singles match between Burdette and Lynch.
Alter dropping the first set, 3-6, Burdette battled
back to knot the match at one set apiece. Then, with the
pressure of the match and the conference victory at
stake, the sophomore downed her opponent with her
powerful serve-and-volley attack, eventually pulling out
a 3-6,6-3,6-2 win.
The victory was even more sweet considering that
California was the only team to defeat the Cardinal all
season, a feat accomplished with a 4-3 Bear victory at the
National Team Indoors in early February.
As expected, the Cardinal was elated with the win.
"I'm really thrilled — there was a lot of pressure on
us to keep the winning streak going, and we rose to the
challenge brilliandy," Barnes said. "We knew the com
petition would be tough this year and to come back and
beat Cal twice — after having lost to them earlier in the
year — shows just how tough we are."
Added Liu: "I'm really happy for the team that we
won the Pac-10 Championship," Liu said. "It is a great
feeling to know that the hours and time each of us has
put in on the court have paid off."
Stanford was originally scheduled to play Tuesday's
match last Wednesday and finish its Pac-10 season Sun
day vs. USC, but the Cal match was postponed due to
rain.
The cancellation of the original Cal contest caused
some travel problems for die Cardinal, as the Pac-101 n
dividual Championships will take place again today in
the conference individual tournament. As a result, Stan
ford players will be competing on two days' rest instead
of four. Last week's rain delay, though, could have been
a blessing in disguise.
"It was great to go to Cal and beat them on their
home courts for the title," Barnes said. "I don't think it
would have been anywhere near as exciting if the title
had already been decided.
"We definitely did not want to share this title with
anybody, and the fact that we took it awa\ from our ri
vals Cal was a great feeling. We have a great deal of re
spect for the Cal team this year, so it was fitting that the
two best teams in the conference were playing off for the

title on the final day."
Stanford will now head to Ojai to compete in the Pac
-10 Individual Tournament. The competition will fea
ture a 32-player singles draw and a 16-team doubles
field.
Although the Cardinal will give total effort this week,
it will keep its eyes fixed on the ultimate goal — an
NCAA championship.
"If I win a few rounds, that would be great — and, of
course, always at the back of my mind is the motivation
that if I can improve my ranking and may help the team
secure the No. 1 seed at the NCAAs," Barnes said.
Even with the conference championship, though,
Stanford lost its No. 1 ranking to Florida in the latest
ITA poll. The Gators easily won the SEC tournament
and edged the Cardinal, 107.66 to 107.25 when the
final tally was complete.
Florida will be hosting the final rounds of the up
coming NCAA Tournament, which begins on May 9.
The first two rounds will be held at regional sites select
ed by the NCAA committee.
