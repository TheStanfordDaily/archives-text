In the past 16 years, 10 different
NFL teams have captured a Super
Bowl tide, Michael Jordan has re
tired three times and three U.S.
presidents have been inaugurated
into office. Yet throughout that pe

would play out in singles.
The only lopsided match oc
curred at No. 6 singles, as Tweedie-
Y ates, who has been playing some of
her best tennis as of late, crushed
Br<x)ke Borisoff, 6-0,6-2.
