# Are you a master of the SATs? Find out
## 
### 
All right profros, this is
my one column of the
year directed at all
you future pre-med
dropouts, so listen up.
You think getting into Stan
ford was hard this year?
Impressed by the 12 percent
admissions rate?
Happy that you fall within die
high SAT range?
Oh, please - You got off easy.
Because next year, as I'm sure
you've heard, drastic change is
ahead for Stanford's Office of Ad
missions policy.
No, I'm not talking about any
early admission mumbo-jumbo
or any actual change of person
nel. I've talked to Dean Robin

Mamlet (read:
I've never had
any communi
cation with her,
except for one
"Bravo!" hand
written on my
admission letter
that had more
bearing on my
decision to come

here than it probably warranted),
and she has agreed, the Myrick-
Porter plan will be put into place
next year.
For you see, my roommate
Steve "whose Rick?" Myrick and I
have witnessed a problem with
the current SAT system.
Yes, the SAT does a semi-de
cent job of judging general aca
demic aptitude. And yes, the
SAT lis do a good job of judging
specialized subject-by-subject
intelligence.
However, we have found that a
crucial talent for applicants goes
unrecorded, untested and disre
spected by traditional admissions
schools of thought.
That subject area?
Sports knowledge.
No area of expertise is more
crucial to understanding exactly
who a person is than sports knowl
edge. It is a life skill, an important
indicator of social aptitude and a
clear judge of character.
So Steve and I propose diat an
optional SAT II be offered in the
most socially relevant of all disci
plines â€” sports knowledge.
It will consist of three parts: Triv
ia, Rules and the most important,
Situational Sports Strategy. It will
consist of five sections (three of
them are Strategy.)
But you ask, Spencer and
Steve, what will the test look like?
Do you have any sample ques
tions?
Oh, you profros are an inquisi
tive bunch, aren't you?
So here you go. A sample.

TRIVIA
1) (Analogy) Hank Aaron :
home runs
A) Barry Bonds :San Francisco
Giants
B) Emmitt Smith : rushing
yards
C) Antoine Walker: 3-pointers
D) Phil Mickelson : major
championships
The answer is B. Emmitt and
Hank are both the respective ca
reer leaders in those statistical cat
egories.
STRATEGY
1) You are Kurt Warner, the St.
Louis Rams quarterback. A defen
sive lineman jumps offsidejust be
fore you get the snap, and you see
the referees throw yellow flags.
You should:
A) Hand the ball to a referee; the
play is over.
B) Take a knee; that way you
won't get hit by the lineman.
C) Throw a long pass downfield;
somebody might catch it.
D) Get a divorce; your wife is so
damn ugly.
Answer: C. You have a free play,
you should make the best of it.
2) As a fan, in which situation do
you cheer?
A) Your favorite golfer is putting
for birdie.
B) Your favorite tennis player is
serving for match point.
C) Your favorite football team is
trying to convert on fourth down,
d) Derek Jeter just separated his
shoulder.
Answer: This should be a no
brainer. D!
3) Antoine Walker is shooting a
free throw with the Celtics down
by two points and one second left
on the clock. The Celtics are best
off if Antoine:
A) Makes his free throw.
B) Throws the free throw off the
backboard to himself.
C) Misses the free throw off the
rim, hoping fora tip in.
D) Breaks his ankle and retires.
The answer is C, although D is ac
ceptable. Antoine is the most over
rated player in the league and was
a cancer on Steve's league-win
ning fantasy basketball team.
RULES
1) It is the second inning, one
out, and the game is tied. There
are runners on first and second.
You are the shortstop. There is a
ground ball to the first baseman,
