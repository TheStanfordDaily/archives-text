# Track sprints to Drake Relays, Cal Invite
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
After a successful trip to south
ern California last weekend, the
No. 8 women and No. 9 men's
track and field squads return to
action this weekend, sending
some athletes to lowa for the
renowned Drake Relays and oth
ers to the Cal Invitational in
Berkeley.
One of the highlights of the
Drake Relays is the distance re
lays, which are not contested at the
NCAA Championships. With its
powerful middle-distance squad,
the Cardinal will contend for titles
in both the men's and women's
3,200-meter relays, distance med
ley relays and 4-mile relays.
The Cardinal men will be chal
lenged by distance powerhouses
Eastern Michigan, Notre Dame
and Indiana, among others, while
the women can expect competi
tion from Missouri, Colorado
State and lowa State.
"We are hoping to thrill the
crowd this weekend at the Drake
Relays," said Vin Lananna, direc
tor of track and field at Stanford.
While athletes cannot qualify to
the West Regional Champi
onships from these relays, the
runners will be using the races as a
chance to warm up for the Cardi
nal Invitational and the Big Meet,
both of which are held at Stanford
next weekend.
There will also be individuals
representing the Cardinal at the
Drake Relays.
In the men's 1,500, junior
Steve Loughlin will lead a group
of Stanford runners aiming fora
regional qualifying time of
3:50.14.
Senior Milton Little, coming off
a personal record long jump of

-25-11 last weekend, will enter the
long jump as well as the 400 and
1,600-meter relays. Both of the
men's sprint relays will be chasing

school records. Both records have
stood since 1978.
For the women, junior Lindsey
Johnson is entered in the elite sec

tion of the 100-meter hurdles,
while sophomore Sara Bei will try
to claim her second victory in two
weekends as she makes her season
debut at 1,500 meters.
Sophomore Jeane Goff, who
now owns two regional qualifying
marks in the 1,500 and steeple
chase, will make her debut at
5,000 meters.
Stanford is expected to send a
strong contingent of throwers
and competitors in other field
events, as well as some distance
runners to the Cal Invitational.
Some of the athletes will be look
ing to qualify for the Regional
Championships, while others will
be staying sharp for the competi
tion next weekend.
"We want to qualify as many
people as possible for the Pac-10
and Regional Championships,"
Lananna said. "This weekend will
be an opportunity for some peo
ple to qualify and an opportunity
for others to practice competing
and warming up for the Big Meet
next weekend."
The Cardinal currently has 68
qualifying marks for the West Re
gional Championships and 86
marks that qualify for the Pacific
-10 Conference Championships.
Despite this huge number,
some of the Cardinal's middle-dis
tance runners, like junior Don
Sage and redshirt freshman Ryan
Hall, have not opened yet this sea
son, while others like senior Lau
ren Fleshman and junior Grant
Robison have only competed in
one event.
After the races this weekend
and next, the Cardinal should
have qualified all the athletes it
needs to challenge for both the
men's and women's Pac-10 titles
and should be able to make a run
at an NCAA Championship.
