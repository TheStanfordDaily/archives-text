# Students call for a voice in Alcohol Policy
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Student disaffection with the University's re
cent change to the Alcohol Policy has coalesced in
two separate efforts to convey concerns about its
potential drawbacks and to advocate for student
input in future alcohol-related decisions.
On April 18, ASSU President-elect Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President-elect Joey Na
toli released a statement criticizing the lack of
student input in the decision and calling for
an ad hoc committee to oversee the policy's
implementation.
"Whereas we appreciate the goals of the ad
ministration to encourage safer drinking, to
limit liability to the University and to foster a
more comfortable frosh-dorm environment,
any substantial changes to residential and other
policies require student input and must take
into account student concerns," they said in the
statement.
On Monday, Jeff Cooper, Class of 2001, post
ed an online petition requesting that administra
tors meet with a group of concerned students and
alumni to discuss the new policy.
The petition read, in part, "With what we
know of the revised policy, we are all afraid that
[Stanford's] characteristic residential experience
and the safety of its students are in jeopardy."
To date, the petition has over 2,100 signatures,
many by current or former resident assistants and
peer health educators. Cooper said he plans to pre
sent the petition to administrators tomorrow, and
he hopes to schedule a meeting soon thereafter.
Administrators 'receptive' to calls for
student input
University leaders maintain that legal and tim
ing issues prevented them from consulting stu
dents and resident fellows in their decision to pro
hibit alcohol at freshman-dorm events. But after
a series of meetings with administrators over the
last few days, Figueroa and Natoli expressed op
timism that student opinion would help shape the
policy's eventual implementation.
"We feel pretty confident that the policy, when
it comes out, will include student voice, and be
cause of that, will be a safer alcohol policy," Natoli,
a sophomore, said.
In die past two days, he and Figueroa have sat
down with Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo, Senior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wachtel, and Ralph Castro and Carol Pel tofsky of
Vaden Student Health Service to express student
misgivings about the unilateral policy change.
Figueroa described the administrators as
"very receptive" to the idea of working with R\s,
resident fellows and student representatives on
