# Students call for a voice in Alcohol Policy
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Student disaffection with the University's re
cent change to the Alcohol Policy has coalesced in
two separate efforts to convey concerns about its
potential drawbacks and to advocate for student
input in future alcohol-related decisions.
On April 18, ASSU President-elect Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President-elect Joey Na
toli released a statement criticizing the lack of
student input in the decision and calling for
an ad hoc committee to oversee the policy's
implementation.
"Whereas we appreciate the goals of the ad
ministration to encourage safer drinking, to
limit liability to the University and to foster a
more comfortable frosh-dorm environment,
any substantial changes to residential and other
policies require student input and must take
into account student concerns," they said in the
statement.
On Monday, Jeff Cooper, Class of 2001, post
ed an online petition requesting that administra
tors meet with a group of concerned students and
alumni to discuss the new policy.
The petition read, in part, "With what we
know of the revised policy, we are all afraid that
[Stanford's] characteristic residential experience
and the safety of its students are in jeopardy."
To date, the petition has over 2,100 signatures,
many by current or former resident assistants and
peer health educators. Cooper said he plans to pre
sent the petition to administrators tomorrow, and
he hopes to schedule a meeting soon thereafter.
Administrators 'receptive' to calls for
student input
University leaders maintain that legal and tim
ing issues prevented them from consulting stu
dents and resident fellows in their decision to pro
hibit alcohol at freshman-dorm events. But after
a series of meetings with administrators over the
last few days, Figueroa and Natoli expressed op
timism that student opinion would help shape the
policy's eventual implementation.
"We feel pretty confident that the policy, when
it comes out, will include student voice, and be
cause of that, will be a safer alcohol policy," Natoli,
a sophomore, said.
In die past two days, he and Figueroa have sat
down with Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo, Senior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wachtel, and Ralph Castro and Carol Pel tofsky of
Vaden Student Health Service to express student
misgivings about the unilateral policy change.
Figueroa described the administrators as
"very receptive" to the idea of working with R\s,
resident fellows and student representatives on
the Alcohol Advisory Board to de
termine how the new policy will play
out in the dormitories. She said the
proposal to create a subcommittee
of die board to oversee its imple
mentation has also been well-re
ceived.
Ambiguity leaves room for RAs to
use judgment
Figueroa and Natoli said they
thought the policy's potential side
effects — such as a less-trusting rela
tionship between RAs and residents
and increased drinking behind
closed doors — could be mitigated
by proper RA training and alcohol
education during New Student Ori
entation.
"There is a good bit of ambigui
ty in the policy, and in these con

versations we've been trying to fig
ure out exactly where the policy
lies," Natoli said. He noted that the
policy does not include a mecha
nism for RAs to issue citations, so
enforcement could be accom
plished informally within the cur
rent framework of respectful inter
vention by both dormitory staff
and fellow students.
Figueroa, a junior, said she
doubted that tfie policy would en
courage students to engage in un
safe drinking in the privacy of their
rooms.
"RAs are already expected to
intervene when there are activi
ties that are unsafe," she said.
"We're less concerned about the
wording of the policy [which pro
hibits drinking in public spaces],
and more concerned about the
implementation of the policy
[which could allow dorm staff to
use their judgment to promote
safe drinking]."

Camarillo said she was pleased
with the progress made in discus
sions with Figueroa and Natoli.
"There is a lot of positive energy
around clarifying misconceptions or
misinformation as well as concerns
about the real impact of change in
the Alcohol Policy," she said.
Petition focuses on safety
concerns
Still, Cooper said he fears that
the changed policy represents a
philosophical shift away from mu
tual trust and toward regulation,
and he hopes that the petition will
create dialogue about issues of stu
dent safety.
While Cooper is the main
spokesman for the petition, he said
the idea came from"a group of
about a dozen people who were very
concerned after reading the an
nouncement of the policy."
"A lot of the people who came
up with the idea [for the petition]

are former residence staff mem
bers," he said. "And I think as RAs
we bought pretty heavily into the
core philosophy of the Alcohol
Policy up until now, which we've
always seen as being: 'Students
are going to drink, just as a base
line assumption, so there's an
obligation to make sure that that
drinking happens in the safest
and most responsible environ
ment possible.' "
Cooper said he believes that re
stricting the use of alcohol in public
spaces runs contrary to this goal.
"Our worry is basically that, far
from reducing the amount of alco
hol-related incidents ... this revi
sion may actually increase [the po
tential danger] by driving drinking
underground, away from commu
nities of people that care and trained
staff members," he said.
The petition also alluded to
concerns about "the weight of evi
dence that led to a revision of this

scope and structure," though
Cooper said that "the decision
making process is secondary to the
concern of student safety."
While the petitioners do not ex
pect to be able to effect a substantial
change in the content of the new
policy, Cooper said they do have
concrete suggestions for alternative
steps that the University could take
that would exhibit more respect for
students' ability to make their own
decisions. The suggestions include
increased alcohol education for
freshmen and increased training for
RAs on how to deal with alcohol-re
lated issues.
Cooper added that he hoped the
meeting would present an opportu
nity to discuss the long-term role of
the RA at Stanford.
"We're hoping to have some sort
of protection of the RA role written
into the Alcohol Policy — some
thing that says that Stanford stands
behind its RAs and expects them to

use their discretion to decide what
are dangerous problems and what
are not," Cooper said.
The meeting will likely include
a small representative group of
petitioners, but, according to
Cooper, "We're hoping to gather
input from a wide variety of stu
dent sources and bring the largest
possible set of inputs into the
meeting and then communicate
the results back [to the broader
community]."
Awakuni is expected to invite the
students to meet with administra
tors soon to share their concerns.
"We take all student feedback se
riously, but I think there's a lot of
misinformation about the change to
the Alcohol Policy that's engender
ing a strong reaction," Awakuni
said.
Asked whether there was room
for discussion in shaping die policy's
implementation, he said, "There's
always room for discussion."

enforcement could be accom
plished informally within the cur
rent framework of respectful inter
vention by both dormitory staff
and fellow students.
Figueroa, a junior, said she
doubted that tfie policy would en
courage students to engage in un
safe drinking in the privacy of their
rooms.
"RAs are already expected to
intervene when there are activi
ties that are unsafe," she said.
"We're less concerned about the
wording of the policy [which pro
hibits drinking in public spaces],
and more concerned about the
implementation of the policy
[which could allow dorm staff to
use their judgment to promote
safe drinking]."

Camarillo said she was pleased
with the progress made in discus
sions with Figueroa and Natoli.
"There is a lot of positive energy
around clarifying misconceptions or
misinformation as well as concerns
about the real impact of change in
the Alcohol Policy," she said.
Petition focuses on safety
concerns
Still, Cooper said he fears that
the changed policy represents a
philosophical shift away from mu
tual trust and toward regulation,
and he hopes that the petition will
create dialogue about issues of stu
dent safety.
While Cooper is the main
spokesman for the petition, he said
the idea came from"a group of
about a dozen people who were very
concerned after reading the an
nouncement of the policy."
"A lot of the people who came
up with the idea [for the petition]

are former residence staff mem
bers," he said. "And I think as RAs
we bought pretty heavily into the
core philosophy of the Alcohol
Policy up until now, which we've
always seen as being: 'Students
are going to drink, just as a base
line assumption, so there's an
obligation to make sure that that
drinking happens in the safest
and most responsible environ
ment possible.' "
Cooper said he believes that re
stricting the use of alcohol in public
spaces runs contrary to this goal.
"Our worry is basically that, far
from reducing the amount of alco
hol-related incidents ... this revi
sion may actually increase [the po
tential danger] by driving drinking
underground, away from commu
nities of people that care and trained
staff members," he said.
The petition also alluded to
concerns about "the weight of evi
dence that led to a revision of this

scope and structure," though
Cooper said that "the decision
making process is secondary to the
concern of student safety."
While the petitioners do not ex
pect to be able to effect a substantial
change in the content of the new
policy, Cooper said they do have
concrete suggestions for alternative
steps that the University could take
that would exhibit more respect for
students' ability to make their own
decisions. The suggestions include
increased alcohol education for
freshmen and increased training for
RAs on how to deal with alcohol-re
lated issues.
Cooper added that he hoped the
meeting would present an opportu
nity to discuss the long-term role of
the RA at Stanford.
"We're hoping to have some sort
of protection of the RA role written
into the Alcohol Policy — some
thing that says that Stanford stands
behind its RAs and expects them to

use their discretion to decide what
are dangerous problems and what
are not," Cooper said.
The meeting will likely include
a small representative group of
petitioners, but, according to
Cooper, "We're hoping to gather
input from a wide variety of stu
dent sources and bring the largest
possible set of inputs into the
meeting and then communicate
the results back [to the broader
community]."
Awakuni is expected to invite the
students to meet with administra
tors soon to share their concerns.
"We take all student feedback se
riously, but I think there's a lot of
misinformation about the change to
the Alcohol Policy that's engender
ing a strong reaction," Awakuni
said.
Asked whether there was room
for discussion in shaping die policy's
implementation, he said, "There's
always room for discussion."
Student disaffection with the University's re
cent change to the Alcohol Policy has coalesced in
two separate efforts to convey concerns about its
potential drawbacks and to advocate for student
input in future alcohol-related decisions.
On April 18, ASSU President-elect Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President-elect Joey Na
toli released a statement criticizing the lack of
student input in the decision and calling for
an ad hoc committee to oversee the policy's
implementation.
"Whereas we appreciate the goals of the ad
ministration to encourage safer drinking, to
limit liability to the University and to foster a
more comfortable frosh-dorm environment,
any substantial changes to residential and other
policies require student input and must take
into account student concerns," they said in the
statement.
On Monday, Jeff Cooper, Class of 2001, post
ed an online petition requesting that administra
tors meet with a group of concerned students and
alumni to discuss the new policy.
The petition read, in part, "With what we
know of the revised policy, we are all afraid that
[Stanford's] characteristic residential experience
and the safety of its students are in jeopardy."
To date, the petition has over 2,100 signatures,
many by current or former resident assistants and
peer health educators. Cooper said he plans to pre
sent the petition to administrators tomorrow, and
he hopes to schedule a meeting soon thereafter.
Administrators 'receptive' to calls for
student input
University leaders maintain that legal and tim
ing issues prevented them from consulting stu
dents and resident fellows in their decision to pro
hibit alcohol at freshman-dorm events. But after
a series of meetings with administrators over the
last few days, Figueroa and Natoli expressed op
timism that student opinion would help shape the
policy's eventual implementation.
"We feel pretty confident that the policy, when
it comes out, will include student voice, and be
cause of that, will be a safer alcohol policy," Natoli,
a sophomore, said.
In die past two days, he and Figueroa have sat
down with Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo, Senior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wachtel, and Ralph Castro and Carol Pel tofsky of
Vaden Student Health Service to express student
misgivings about the unilateral policy change.
Figueroa described the administrators as
"very receptive" to the idea of working with R\s,
resident fellows and student representatives on
the Alcohol Advisory Board to de
termine how the new policy will play
out in the dormitories. She said the
proposal to create a subcommittee
of die board to oversee its imple
mentation has also been well-re
ceived.
Ambiguity leaves room for RAs to
use judgment
Figueroa and Natoli said they
thought the policy's potential side
effects — such as a less-trusting rela
tionship between RAs and residents
and increased drinking behind
closed doors — could be mitigated
by proper RA training and alcohol
education during New Student Ori
entation.
"There is a good bit of ambigui
ty in the policy, and in these con

versations we've been trying to fig
ure out exactly where the policy
lies," Natoli said. He noted that the
policy does not include a mecha
nism for RAs to issue citations, so
enforcement could be accom
plished informally within the cur

and fellow students.
