# Students and community gather to educate about the Earth
## Earth Day fair continues 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
To celebrate the 33rd Earth Day, stu
dent groups and community members
have brought booths raising awareness of
toxic chemicals and urging students to re
cycle into White Plaza as a part of Earth
Awareness Week. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.,
starting yesterday, students have been en
couraging people to sign petitions, dig up
their old cell phones and become involved
in environmental issues.
Booths range from the Stanford Open

Space Alliance asking people to sign post
cards to discourage development in the
Foothills to a table seeking donations of
cell phones and shoes for reuse and recy
cling.
Many of the student booths are run by
interns at the Stanford Recycling Center
and campus environmental representa
tives, or eßeps, who are responsible for
maintaining environmental conscious
ness in the dorms.

to run the athletic shoe and cell
phone collection booth. The cell
phones will either be taken and re
programmed with emergency
numbers for victims of domestic
abuse or given to the South Bay
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which
will receive money for each phone.
She came up with the idea fora cell
phone collection after looking in
her parents' closet.
"I opened up my parents' closet
at home and saw a bunch of used
cell phones wedged into a dark
ened corner," she said. "It seemed
like such a waste to just throw them
out, so I looked online and found a
bunch of different programs for
cell phone reuse. Since students
seem to change cell phones so
often here, I figured that this
would be a good place to do a
drive."
Malia Langworthy, outreach
specialist for Recycle Works of San

Mateo County, explained the rea
soning behind the New Life for
Old Soles Shoe Recycling Project.
"We wanted to do a program
around Earth Day that would
reach a lot of different people —
almost everyone has an old pair of
sneakers that can be recycled," she
said.
The recycled shoes continue
their sporty function in their rein
carnation as new athletic surfaces
"Each part of the shoe is recy
cled into a different material that is
used to make different types of
athletic surfaces," Langworthy
said. "It takes 3,000 shoes to make
a basketball court and 100,000
shoes to make a track. These are
shoes that would be otherwise
thrown into the trash because
there are not many places to take
shoes for recycling."
Passers-by and bikers slowed
down to take a look at the booths in
White Plaza yesterday. Kwong
Yung, a doctoral candidate in sta
tistics, stopped yesterday after
noon to compare his shoes with
ones on the reuse table. He ended

up taking a pair home.
"They looked nice and I
thought I could use them," he said.
"It's an extension of passing it on to
the family. I'm always the oldest, so
nothing ever got passed on to me."
Sophomore Jennifer Chiu is
running the Clean Computer Cam
paign booth, which includes a letter
writing campaign to Dell, a docu
mentary video and student "E-
Waste Educators" in hazardous ma
terial suits. Chiu is trying to educate
students about the hazards of chem
icals like lead, mercury and other
toxic pollutants found in communi
ties that dismantle computers.
"Most of these communities are
located in developing countries,
such as China and India," she said.
"The goal of the booth is to edu
cate students about the unintend
ed consequences of their products,
how they can dispose of their com
puters in the safest way possible
and what they can do to promote
the development of cleaner tech
nology so that electronic waste will
no longer contain the dangerous
toxins that it does today."

According to Julie Muir,
manger of Stanford Recycling,
Stanford already has a strong recy
cling program — the University
diverts 53 percent of its waste from
landfills.
"We are recycling paper, bot
tles and cans, plastic bags, scrap
metal, electronic scrap, construc
tion and demolition debris and
composting yard waste and food
waste," she said. "We hope to in
crease our diversion by expanding
our food-waste composting to
more kitchens and by continually
educating the campus to recycle
all of their paper and bottles and
cans."
Jennifer Chiu feels that the re
cycling program at Stanford is ex
cellent, but still thinks there is
room for improvement.
"[Students] don't realize that re
cycling their Coke can or junk mail
is part of a larger movement of re
source and energy conservation, of
people taking small steps in their
everyday lives that add up to huge
positive change for the environ
ment," she said.
