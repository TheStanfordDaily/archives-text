# Students and community gather to educate about the Earth
## Earth Day fair continues 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
To celebrate the 33rd Earth Day, stu
dent groups and community members
have brought booths raising awareness of
toxic chemicals and urging students to re
cycle into White Plaza as a part of Earth
Awareness Week. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.,
starting yesterday, students have been en
couraging people to sign petitions, dig up
their old cell phones and become involved
in environmental issues.
Booths range from the Stanford Open

Space Alliance asking people to sign post
cards to discourage development in the
Foothills to a table seeking donations of
cell phones and shoes for reuse and recy
cling.
Many of the student booths are run by
interns at the Stanford Recycling Center
and campus environmental representa
tives, or e√üeps, who are responsible for
maintaining environmental conscious
ness in the dorms.
