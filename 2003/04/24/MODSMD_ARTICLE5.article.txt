# FACES disrupted by concerns over SARS
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Fifteen students from China were
prohibited from traveling to Stanford
fora conference next week due to the
University's concerns about Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
The Forum for American Chinese
Exchange at Stanford had to drastical
ly change the nature of its upcoming
conference because of the University's
fears of SARS and current health advi
sories in China.
The University administration ex
plained that while there is no general
prohibition on travel to and from cer
tain countries, this conference present
ed unnecessary risk, that the University
wanted to minimize.
"Although the FACES participants

who were asked last week not to come
are not Stanford students," said Ira
Friedman, director of Vaden Student
Health Service, "there was the poten
tial of putting Stanford undergradu
ates at particular risk because they
would be sharing dorm rooms with
Stanford undergraduate students."
Members of FACES said they are
frustrated by the University's decision
and the impact it has had on their con
ference, meant to create dialogue be
tween Chinese and American students.
"I think it's been an overreac
tion," said senior Jessica Weiss, pres
ident of FACES.
Last week, FACES informed the
Chinese students who had been select
ed for the conference that they would
no longer be permitted to attend
and the group had to quickly find
20 Chinese students already study
ing in the United States to partici
pate in the conference, which be
gins Monday.
The group was able to find par
ticipants, but according to Weiss,
the quality of applicants suffered.
"We're disappointed, but we're
going to make the best of it," she said.
Coordinators said they felt com
munication between the University
and the organization was not han
dled well as they were informed
suddenly just a couple weeks before
their conference.
According to Weiss, this decision
was made with little student input,
and suggestions, such as placing the
visiting students in hotels instead of
dorms, were not considered.
"We tried other options,
but... there's been no discussion,"
Weiss said.

A long-standing policy prohibits
University-sponsored undergradu
ate travel to countries where State
Department travel warnings are is
sued, though there are no prohibi
tions involving faculty, staff or grad
uate students.
"The students traveling from
China and Hong Kong to participate
in the FACES program would be
traveling to campus for an elective,
non-essential activity — such as a
short-term conference — supported
with University funds and that might
have an impart on our undergradu
ate population," Friedman said.
Professors traveling from China
for the conference were allowed to
attend and were only advised to visit
Vaden for precautionary measures.
"I don't think it is overreacting,"
Friedman said. "I think it is just
being prudent and proactive. We
are being very careful because the
SARS situation is still developing.
"At the same time, we are mind
ful that we have many students,
scholars and visitors from SARS-af
fected areas," he continued, "and we
are not closing our doors to them."
