## WHO'S UGLY? 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Who is the ugliest person at Stan
ford? Five University members are bat
tling it out in White Plaza this week to
earn the tide. Sponsored by Alpha Phi
Omega, Stanford's co-educational
community service fraternity, The
UGLY Contest is actually a fundraiser
for charity running until Friday.
All week, students voted by drop
ping money in each of the candi
dates' buckets, which feature their
pictures. All of the money collected
will be donated to a charity of the
winner's choice.
Candidates for the contest are Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, seniors Caroline Hopper
and Mike Massey, coterminal student
Will Taylor and vicar of the Episco
pal-Lutheran Campus Ministry
Karen Perkins.
"The name of the contest itself is just
for fun," said sophomore Diana Lam,
UGLY Contest co-chair. "The winner
is obviously not the ugliest person at
Stanford. This is just a great way to
raise money for charity."
Many students, however, were baf
fled by the name of the event.
"I was really confused when I first
saw a sign for an ugly contest," said
freshman Dan Taron. "It seemed kind
of mean to vote for the ugliest person.
But no one is really taking that serious

ly, so it's a pretty interesting idea fora
charity fundraiser."
Awakuni, who hopes to raise money
for Special Olympics, said, "It's fora
good cause so I agreed to participate in
the contest. I think what these athletes
do, despite their disability, is extraordi
nary. It's a testament to the resilience
and beauty of the human spirit."
The candidates represent a variety
of charities. Perkins is running on be
half of the San Francisco Night Ministry
while Hopper is running for the Sup
port Network for Battered Women.
Taylor is supporting Wildlife Rescue
and Massey represents Pets in Need.
"The primary reason that I want
ed to represent Pets in Need is that, to
me, they fill a niche in the local com
munity that is not often considered by
many people, even pet owners and
pet lovers," Massey said. "Pets in
Need rescues adoptable animals that
have run out of time and cares for
them for until the pet is adopted into
a loving home. Pets in Need is run
without public funds. Therefore, I
would like to support them in their
cause in whatever small way I might
be able to."
An UGLY pageant, in which all of
the candidates parade to music and
come to the microphone to convince
people to donate to their charity, is
scheduled for today at noon in
