# Student-initiated course gives attention to prominent Indian religion
## Students explore Sikhism 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford bolsters its re
sources in Islamic studies, aug
menting extensive work already
done in Christianity, Judaism and
Buddhism, some students say that
the University is lacking in its at
tention to one of the world's major
religions — Sikhism.
To fill this curricular gap, this
quarter Stanford is offering
"Sikhism in America,"a student
initiated course that addresses
both the history of Sikhism and
current issues relating to Sikhs.
" The starting of this class was
really a major step in advancing
the Religious Studies Depart
ment here at Stanford," said head
teaching assistant and class orga
nizer Harvir Singh, a sopho
more. "Most colleges around the
nation offer programs on Islamic
studies or Christian studies or

Jewish and Buddhist studies, but
it's really rare to find a program
on Sikh studies."
Sikhism is estimated to have
more than 20 million adherents
internationally and several hun
dred thousand in the United
States. It has been ranked as the
world's fifth-largest religion.
Singh estimated that there are
about 20 to 30 Sikhs at Stanford,
including both undergraduate
and graduate students.
"The Sikh religion was found
ed nearly 530 years ago in
India," Singh said. "At its core,
Sikhism preaches a message of
devotion and remembrance of
God at all times, honorable liv
ing, social justice and equality of
mankind."
Class member Vikram Field
ing-Singh, a sophomore, said
that the class at Stanford enables
him to explore Sikhism in a struc
tured way.

"It's very hard to learn about
Sikhism in an organized setting,"
he said. "1 think this class is a great
opportunity to do so."
Fielding-Singh added, "I am
taking the class because half of
my family is Sikh, and although
I've been to India a few times,
I've never really had the oppor
tunity to learn about Sikhism and
its history."
After Sept. 11 significantly al
tered the public's view of the Mid
dle East, the drive to increase gen
eral knowledge about Sikhism
and combat stereotypes has
strengthened, according to Singh.
In the weeks after Sept. 11, many
Sikhs were mistaken for Muslims
and attacked in hate crimes.
"[Sikh] temples have been
open to non-Sikhs," Singh ex
plained. "Yet misunderstanding
of its religion's culture and dress
has lingered and lead to unfortu
nate incidents in the wake of the
9/11 attacks. For example, a
Sikh man was denied a job in
New York for keeping long hair.
Legislation in Canada prevented
Sikhs from being employed in
the police."
While the vast majority of the
Sikh population is in India,
Sikhs have lived in the United
States for more than 100 years
now, with nearly a third of the
U.S. Sikh population living in
California.
Community members come to
Stanford from a variety of loca
tions in the area, including Berke
ley and Fremont, to attend the
student-initiated class.
"What makes the Sikhism in
America class so unique is that
it's open not only to Stanford stu
dents but to the community as

well," Singh said. "This really
brings in a lot of viewpoints and
really stimulates our discus
sions."
The class features speakers
nearly every week who lecture
on a range of topics. Lectures in
clude "The Birth of Sikhism and
its Journey from the 1400s to
1900s," given by Gurinder
Singh Mann of UC-Santa Bar
bara, and "Preservation and
Evolution of Culture for Sikhs in
America," given by Prof. Bruce
Laßrack from the University of
the Pacific.
The class is sponsored by the
Sikh Students Association,
Satrang and the ASSU.
