# Student-initiated course gives attention to prominent Indian religion
## Students explore Sikhism 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford bolsters its re
sources in Islamic studies, aug
menting extensive work already
done in Christianity, Judaism and
Buddhism, some students say that
the University is lacking in its at
tention to one of the world's major
religions â€” Sikhism.
To fill this curricular gap, this
quarter Stanford is offering
"Sikhism in America,"a student
initiated course that addresses
both the history of Sikhism and
current issues relating to Sikhs.
" The starting of this class was
really a major step in advancing
the Religious Studies Depart
ment here at Stanford," said head
teaching assistant and class orga
nizer Harvir Singh, a sopho
more. "Most colleges around the
nation offer programs on Islamic
studies or Christian studies or

Jewish and Buddhist studies, but
it's really rare to find a program
on Sikh studies."
Sikhism is estimated to have
more than 20 million adherents
internationally and several hun

States. It has been ranked as the
world's fifth-largest religion.
Singh estimated that there are
about 20 to 30 Sikhs at Stanford,
including both undergraduate
and graduate students.
"The Sikh religion was found
ed nearly 530 years ago in
India," Singh said. "At its core,
Sikhism preaches a message of
devotion and remembrance of
God at all times, honorable liv

mankind."
Class member Vikram Field

that the class at Stanford enables
him to explore Sikhism in a struc
tured way.

"It's very hard to learn about
Sikhism in an organized setting,"
he said. "1 think this class is a great
opportunity to do so."
Fielding-Singh added, "I am
taking the class because half of
my family is Sikh, and although
I've been to India a few times,
I've never really had the oppor
tunity to learn about Sikhism and
its history."
After Sept. 11 significantly al
tered the public's view of the Mid
dle East, the drive to increase gen
eral knowledge about Sikhism
and combat stereotypes has
strengthened, according to Singh.
In the weeks after Sept. 11, many
Sikhs were mistaken for Muslims
and attacked in hate crimes.
"[Sikh] temples have been
open to non-Sikhs," Singh ex
plained. "Yet misunderstanding
of its religion's culture and dress
