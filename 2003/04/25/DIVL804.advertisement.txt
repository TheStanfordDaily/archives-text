SCHUMANN
String No*. i % 1
Winners of the 1992 Banff International String Quartet Competition, these four young Canadians are a striking new
presence on the chamber music scene. The quartet was founded in 1989 and studied with the Emerson String Quartet
at the Hartt School of Music. The passion and technical skill the members bring to their playing make them ideally
suited to the music of Robert Schumann.
Schumann wrote his Op. 41 quartets in a two-week flurry of activity during the summer of 1842. The composer had
been studying the quartets of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, as well as Bach's contrapuntal techniques. Schumann's
quartets look back to the older music while presenting some challenging new ideas of his own. A good example is
the second movement of the Op. 41 in A Major Quartet. Cast in sonata form, a fiery introduction gives way to a sigh
ing adagio before it becomes an energetic fugue.
The St. Lawrence String Quartet meets the challenges of Schumann's occasionally idiosyncratic string writing with
skill. Possessing a warm tone and brilliant technique, the quartet captures the rhapsodic heart of each of these cham
ber music treasures.
