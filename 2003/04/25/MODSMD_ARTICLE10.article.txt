# Iraqi leader in U.S. custody
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. forces
in Iraq have taken custody of Tariq Aziz,
the former deputy prime minister and
the most visible Iraqi leader other than
Saddam Hussein.
Officials at the Pentagon and at Cen
tral Command headquarters in Qatar
said yesterday they did not know
whether Aziz was captured or whether he
turned himself in.
On the U.S. list of the 55 most-wanted
members of the former government, Aziz
was No. 43, the eight of spades in the mil
itary's card deck of top Iraqi leaders.
His prominence in the regime could
make Aziz a source for the best informa
tion yet on the fate of Saddam and his two
sons, as well as the location of any hidden
weapons of mass destruction.
"We can confirm Tariq Aziz is now
under coalition control," said Central
Command spokeswoman Capt. Dani
Burrows.
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., former
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said last night the arrest of

another top Iraq official, in Syria, would
be announced shortly.
Graham, at a session of the Council on
Foreign Relations, declined to identify
the Iraqi, saying only that he held one of
the most sensitive positions in the Iraqi
government and was arrested in the past
24 hours.
Aziz was often the public face of Iraq
when responding to accusations by the
United States and United Nations.
He was the only Christian in Saddam's
inner circle, most of whom were Surini
Muslims like Saddam. He served as for
eign minister during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War and was a frequent spokesman
at that time.
Aziz last appeared in public March 19,
when he held a news conference in Bagh
dad to quash rumors he had fled the
Iraqi capital.
"1 am carrying my pistol to confirih to
you that we are ready to fight the aggres
sors," Aziz said then. "American soldiers
are nothing but mercenaries and they
will be defeated."
