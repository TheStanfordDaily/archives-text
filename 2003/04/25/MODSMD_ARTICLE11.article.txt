## The Stanford Daily Soaking in the experience

Editorial

As the days get longer and the
shorts get shorter, Stanford stu
dents can welcome yet another
sign that spring is here: the
profros have landed.
For those who may not be familiar with
the Farm and its quirky nicknames for ev
erything, "profro" stands for prospective
freshman. If you're one of them, that
means you're one of a group of 2,000 ex
cited, confused and enthusiastic individu
als running around campus today. It also
means you're an amazing person who ev
eryone in the Stanford community —

from Admissions
Dean Robin Mamlet
to your RoHo (room
host, for you fresh
faces) — would like
to get to know. So on
behalf of Stanford
University, The Daily
welcomes you, con
gratulates you and
invites you into our
college community
with open arms.
If the Admit Week
end planners did
their organizing
right, these next few
days will be memo
rable, hectic and in
sanely wacky for ev
eryone on campus.
Some sights and at

Weekend experience. There are many
opportunities for learning and many
things to think about as you meander
through the campus, deciding if it's the
right place for you. Remember, no matter
where you ultimately choose to go for col
lege, your decision will impact the rest of
your life in extraordinary ways.
For this reason, we have a few pointers.
First, soak in as much as you can; try to get
a feel for the Stanford community as a
whole.
The friendly Cardinal faces around you
have been through it all: They had the

the authentic Stanford: fountain hop
ping; dorm "family bonding;" Division I
athletics teams you can be proud of; music
— especially a cappella of all flavors; year
round celebration of world cultures and
American diversity; gorgeous Palm Drive;
and the key part of Stanford: the spon
taneity, energy, dweebiness, rebellion,
corniness and amazing talent rolled into
every single student on campus.
Some other experiences this weekend
will not represent typical the Stanford:
dozens of HoHo's (house hosts) scram
bling around in matching T-shirts,
yelling, flailing their arms, cheering for no
apparent reason (OK, so some of this is
still authentic Stanford); übiquitous red
folders; free food everywhere; and of
course, thousands of other profros meet
ing and forming official Stanford friend
ships, the first of many more in the years
to come.
All of it — whether it illustrates the typ
ical Stanford life or is just part of the
profro frenzy — is part of the Admit

same questions and
the same feelings you
have now. If you ever
get stuck, ask them;
they are guaranteed
to be your best guides
when it comes to life
on the Farm.
We know how
short this weekend
will be. So talk to your
fellow profros, but
talk to students, to
professors — they
will be eager to meet
you. Then talk some
more — to the Book
store staff, librarians
and Dining Services
employees. Talk to
President Hennessy
(see if you can catch
him going by in his

golf cart). Smell the flowers, flip through li
brary books, lie on the grass, hop in a foun
tain, witness the Stanford athletes in play at
a sports event and ride the Marguerite. Go
to the many diverse parties offered this
weekend. Visit the ethnic and cultural cen
ters, go to a lecture. We urge you to see,
hear, taste, touch and smell everything
Stanford you possibly can.
Then do the same when you visit other
universities. Compare and decide what's
best for you. Many Stanford students came
here because they felt invigorated by the
unique and dazzling array of people, tal
ents, niche communities and interests
here; others were primarily drawn by the
strong departments and interdisciplinary
academic programs. To at least some ex
tent, all were drawn by the beautiful Cali
fornia weather and campus. But although
we may feel that Stanford has everything
that anyone could possibly wish for in a
school and a home, we may be a little bi
ased. So take up our challenge: See for
yourself.
