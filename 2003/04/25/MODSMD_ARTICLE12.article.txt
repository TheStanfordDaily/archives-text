# ANIMAL FARM
## Farmhands 
### 
The stakes are higher for
me this week, being that
it's the start of Admit
Weekend and a large
number of prospective freshmen
will be reading this column. As
they're running around campus,
eyes wide-open, analyzing every sit
uation they find themselves in, ask
ing for advice in every interaction,
they are trying to get a feel for the
campus and decide if they will at
tend our lovely university in the tall.
Though I was a profro once my
self, I now see this weekend from
the other side. Why do Stanford
students put up with Admit Week
end? If you think about it, it's an
awful amount of pressure on us to
sell our school. Is that our responsi
bility? Isn't there a U.S. News &
World Report ranking and a team
of professional advertisers hired to
sell our school?
Quite simply, Admit Weekend is
very disruptive for the present stu
dents at Stanford. Dorms overrun
with high schoolers mean no par
ties and no alcohol. We even got an
e-mail asking us to be on "responsi
ble behavior" this weekend from
Dean of Admission Robin Mamlet.
It's a pain for us all; we can't really
live our normal lives for three days.
Frats — now seen as the devil by
the administration — are prohibit
ed from sponsoring any sort of im
bibing event. I can't say that these
few days are that fun in the grand
scheme of spring quarter.
So why do we put up with it? I
think it comes down to the most im
portant thing about Stanford and
why it's so great to go here. People
love this place. Students actually
like being here. And we genuinely
want other people to share in all the
great things about Stanford. We
want all the profros to be real fresh
men next year, so that we can kiss
them at Full Moon on the Quad.

Feeling the re
sponsibility to con
vince profros to
come to Stanford
makes this a week
end a heavy bur
den. Most stu
dents don't realize
it, but the smallest
interaction with a

prospective freshman can tilt the
scale toward or away from Stanford
for the high schooler. A smile or a
snippet of a conversation can prove
that Stanford is a great school, but
one not-so-great interaction with a
disgruntled sophomore having a
bad day can turn an ambivalent
high school senior away from the
Farm.
Ask anyone her storv about

7 think it comes down to the
most important thing about
Stanford and why it's so great
to go here. People love this
place. Students actually like
being here."

why she's at Stanford and you're
bound to get a really random re
sponse, an arbitrary occurrence
that meant the difference between
Stanford and a host of other
schools.

For me, it was the Band. I went
to the welcome talk by President
Hennessy in MemAud, and as I
had entered the building it was
pouring rain outside. When the
speech was finished and I exited,
the sun was shining, typical Stan
ford style (at least the way it used
to be), and the Band was waiting

outside in their crazy clothes play
ing upbeat music.
I knew then that Stanford was
more fun than any other school I
had visited.
Just the opposite can happen if
you meet up with the wrong per
son. At another school during the
month of April of my senior year,
I asked a girl why I should attend
that school, what makes it special.
Her response was,"The students
here all share something really
great —we all got in."
I thought this was the worst ex
planation I had ever heard. Get
ting in is only the first part of col
lege. It doesn't feel like that when
you are 17 and college seems like
this strange and wondrous land
where you can do anything you
want. What matters is how you
feel at your university and what
experiences and opportunities
present themselves to you as an
undergrad.
For students who are early
admits, sure they are coming to
Stanford, a friendly conversa
tion only gets them more excit
ed for their imminent days on
the Farm. But fora bunch of
other profros, this is a scary
time. For many, this is the first
big decision of their lives.
With that in mind, I pay spe
cial attention to smile at
prospective freshmen, to make
myself seem warm, inviting and
put together and to appear in
tellectual—yet still fun. I have
no idea what they are looking
for to find out if if this is the
ideal place for them. I want to
make them as comfortable as
possible and so do the rest of the
current students at Stanford.

Hey profros! Come to Stanford! If you
have any questions e-mail me at

7 think it comes down to the
most important thing about
Stanford and why it's so great

place. Students actually like
being here."

why she's at Stanford and you're
bound to get a really random re
sponse, an arbitrary occurrence
that meant the difference between
Stanford and a host of other
schools.

For me, it was the Band. I went
to the welcome talk by President
Hennessy in MemAud, and as I
had entered the building it was
pouring rain outside. When the
speech was finished and I exited,
the sun was shining, typical Stan
ford style (at least the way it used
to be), and the Band was waiting

outside in their crazy clothes play
ing upbeat music.
I knew then that Stanford was
more fun than any other school I
had visited.
Just the opposite can happen if
you meet up with the wrong per
son. At another school during the
month of April of my senior year,
I asked a girl why I should attend
that school, what makes it special.
Her response was,"The students
here all share something really
great —we all got in."
I thought this was the worst ex
planation I had ever heard. Get
ting in is only the first part of col
lege. It doesn't feel like that when
you are 17 and college seems like
this strange and wondrous land
where you can do anything you
want. What matters is how you
feel at your university and what
experiences and opportunities
present themselves to you as an
undergrad.
For students who are early
admits, sure they are coming to
Stanford, a friendly conversa
tion only gets them more excit
ed for their imminent days on
the Farm. But fora bunch of
other profros, this is a scary
time. For many, this is the first
big decision of their lives.
With that in mind, I pay spe
cial attention to smile at
prospective freshmen, to make
myself seem warm, inviting and
put together and to appear in
tellectual—yet still fun. I have
no idea what they are looking
for to find out if if this is the
ideal place for them. I want to
make them as comfortable as
possible and so do the rest of the
current students at Stanford.

Hey profros! Come to Stanford! If you
have any questions e-mail me at
