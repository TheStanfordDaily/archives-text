# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Psychology lecture lacks sensitivity to sexual orientation 
### JOAN ROUGHGARDEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
On April 23, Psychology Prof. Michael
Bailey from Northwestern University
presented a lecture entitled "Gender
Nonconformity and Sexual Orientation"
to the Stanford University Psychology
Department as part of its regularly sched
uled departmental lecture series.
The audience, including about 10 fac
ulty and 100 students, enjoyed laughing
at pictures, quotations and voice record
ings of gay, lesbian and transgendered
people. The material consisted mostly of
film clips and animated cartoons. At no
point was the audience admonished to
assume a professional decorum. No fac
ulty challenged the scholarship, and crit
icism of the evidently limited sampling
was left to several graduate students.
Bailey was introduced as "controver
sial," someone whose work has important
implications for law, medicine and social

policy and as a successful teacher whose
courses feature "Transsexuals stripping
after class." (First big laugh.) The initial
photographs included a male-bodied
child wearing her mother's shoes, when
the second round of laughter erupted. A
female-bodied child was then shown in
male clothes and quoted as saying she
"wanted a penis," again producing
laughter. In another example, an older
child in a clinical setting was given the
choice of toys and chose a doll and a wig.
She was quoted as saying, "1 hate my
hair," greatly amusing the audience.
Bailey's main claim is that 75 percent
of gender-variant male-bodied children
grow up to be gay men. Furthermore,
gay men questioned about their child
hood report more feminine identifica
tion on the average than straight-identi
fied men. A similar claim is made for gen
der-variant female-bodied children
growing up to become lesbians, though
with less certainty. Therefore, Bailey's

thesis is that gay men are more feminine
than straight men, lesbians more mascu
line than straight women and that trans
gendered people do not exist as a distinct
category but as an extreme gender-vari
ant "subtype" of homosexuality.
Bailey did not present, much less do
justice, to the many alternative theories
and supporting data that conceptualize
gender identity and sexual orientation as
distinct axes of description.
Bailey followed this claim with more
photographs and film clips. Two gay men
were interviewed and the audience was
invited to sharpen their ability to discern
a gay male from a straight male — to
train their "gaydar" (his word) and "pick
up the vibes." An animated cartoon
showing effeminate gestures fora gay
man was contrasted with one depicting a
macho manner fora straight man, again
sending the audience into peals of laugh
ter. He then proceeded to show clips of a
drag queen and a transgendered woman.

The transgendered woman was de
scribed as "an extremely feminine gay
man who decided to become a woman."
Bailey would show bar graphs (without
error bars) purporting to show that gay
men and straight men prefer "casual sex"
more than straight women, and straight
women also prefer this type of sexual be
havior more than lesbian women. The
transgendered woman was claimed
(though no data given) to be as sexually
active in casual sex as a straight man or
gay man, and for this reason had to be
considered a gay man "himself."
The lecture continued with a cata
logue of diagnostic criteria to include in
one's "gaydar" for accurately discerning
gay people from straight people, a pro
ject that drew an approving wisecrack
from one faculty member. Using North
western undergraduates as subjects
("Northwestern has a good theater de
partment") he developed a rating for gay
presentation, leading to the phrase, "the

gayest-rated gay man."
Then voices of two gay men and two
straight men were played and the audi
ence was asked to guess who was gay and
who was straight. Those who guessed
correctly grinned with joy and were ap
plauded by their neighbors, leading to
the conclusion that if a gay sounds really
gay, then he probably is. If Bailey had
presented a scholarly account of his theo
ry in comparison with alternative theo
ries of gender expression and sexuality,
he would not have had to rely on a comi
cal and vulgar performance to garner au
dience support.
Finally, Bailey presented the book,
"The Man Who Would Be Queen," in
which he identifies the other "subtype" of
transsexual as someone motivated by
fetishistic body morphing, a largely obso
lete idea that originated with Ray Blan
chard. Bailey said his seminar had avoid-
Ed the "really controversial"
material that was available in
his book. The official publicity
for the book distributed at the
Denver American Association
for the Advancement of Science
Convention in February, leads
with the phrase "Gay, Straight,
or Lying? Science Has the An
swer" and ends with the claim
that Bailey's conclusions "may
not always be politically cor
rect, but they are scientifically
accurate, thoroughly re
searched and occasionally
startling." Instead, many are
now offering the book as the

latest example of junk science
and are appalled at the Nation
al Academy's complicity in the
sensationalizing of lesbian, gay
and especially, transgendered
people.
Bailey's book is fulfilling the
prophesy of being "controver
sial." Gay, lesbian and trans
gendered people are organiz
ing protests at bookstores
around the country and are
writing critiques in every media
outlet possible.
To many observers, Bailey
appears to be a rather dumb,
stubborn, dense and possibly
deceptive regular guy with
some experience in locker
room humor. Meanwhile, the
day before, on April 22, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported

that the California State Assem
bly passed a bill extending Cal
ifornia's housing and employ
ment nondiscrimination laws to
cover gender-variant people,
including transvestites and
transsexuals. The bill will soon
move to the state senate and
will proceed to the governor.
The political progress being
made by gay, lesbian and now
transgendered people greatly
exceeds that in academia, if the
homophobic and transphobic
welcome to Bailey given by the
Stanford Department of Psy
chology is any indication.

after class." (First big laugh.) The initial
photographs included a male-bodied
child wearing her mother's shoes, when
the second round of laughter erupted. A
female-bodied child was then shown in
male clothes and quoted as saying she
"wanted a penis," again producing
laughter. In another example, an older
child in a clinical setting was given the
choice of toys and chose a doll and a wig.
She was quoted as saying, "1 hate my
hair," greatly amusing the audience.
Bailey's main claim is that 75 percent
of gender-variant male-bodied children
grow up to be gay men. Furthermore,
gay men questioned about their child
hood report more feminine identifica
tion on the average than straight-identi
fied men. A similar claim is made for gen
der-variant female-bodied children
growing up to become lesbians, though
with less certainty. Therefore, Bailey's

thesis is that gay men are more feminine
than straight men, lesbians more mascu
line than straight women and that trans
gendered people do not exist as a distinct
category but as an extreme gender-vari
ant "subtype" of homosexuality.
Bailey did not present, much less do
justice, to the many alternative theories
and supporting data that conceptualize
gender identity and sexual orientation as
distinct axes of description.
Bailey followed this claim with more
photographs and film clips. Two gay men
were interviewed and the audience was
invited to sharpen their ability to discern
a gay male from a straight male — to
train their "gaydar" (his word) and "pick
up the vibes." An animated cartoon
showing effeminate gestures fora gay
man was contrasted with one depicting a
macho manner fora straight man, again
sending the audience into peals of laugh
ter. He then proceeded to show clips of a
drag queen and a transgendered woman.

The transgendered woman was de
scribed as "an extremely feminine gay
man who decided to become a woman."
Bailey would show bar graphs (without
error bars) purporting to show that gay
men and straight men prefer "casual sex"
more than straight women, and straight
women also prefer this type of sexual be
havior more than lesbian women. The
transgendered woman was claimed
(though no data given) to be as sexually
active in casual sex as a straight man or
gay man, and for this reason had to be
considered a gay man "himself."
The lecture continued with a cata
logue of diagnostic criteria to include in
one's "gaydar" for accurately discerning
gay people from straight people, a pro
ject that drew an approving wisecrack
from one faculty member. Using North
western undergraduates as subjects
("Northwestern has a good theater de
partment") he developed a rating for gay
presentation, leading to the phrase, "the

gayest-rated gay man."
Then voices of two gay men and two
straight men were played and the audi
ence was asked to guess who was gay and
who was straight. Those who guessed
correctly grinned with joy and were ap
plauded by their neighbors, leading to
the conclusion that if a gay sounds really
gay, then he probably is. If Bailey had
presented a scholarly account of his theo
ry in comparison with alternative theo
ries of gender expression and sexuality,
he would not have had to rely on a comi
cal and vulgar performance to garner au
dience support.
Finally, Bailey presented the book,
"The Man Who Would Be Queen," in
which he identifies the other "subtype" of
transsexual as someone motivated by
fetishistic body morphing, a largely obso
lete idea that originated with Ray Blan
chard. Bailey said his seminar had avoid-
Ed the "really controversial"
material that was available in
his book. The official publicity
for the book distributed at the
Denver American Association
for the Advancement of Science
Convention in February, leads
with the phrase "Gay, Straight,
or Lying? Science Has the An
swer" and ends with the claim
that Bailey's conclusions "may
not always be politically cor
rect, but they are scientifically
accurate, thoroughly re
searched and occasionally
startling." Instead, many are
now offering the book as the

latest example of junk science
and are appalled at the Nation
al Academy's complicity in the
sensationalizing of lesbian, gay
and especially, transgendered
people.
Bailey's book is fulfilling the
prophesy of being "controver
sial." Gay, lesbian and trans
gendered people are organiz
ing protests at bookstores
around the country and are
writing critiques in every media
outlet possible.
To many observers, Bailey
appears to be a rather dumb,
stubborn, dense and possibly
deceptive regular guy with
some experience in locker
room humor. Meanwhile, the
day before, on April 22, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported

that the California State Assem
bly passed a bill extending Cal
ifornia's housing and employ
ment nondiscrimination laws to
cover gender-variant people,
including transvestites and
transsexuals. The bill will soon
move to the state senate and
will proceed to the governor.
The political progress being
made by gay, lesbian and now
transgendered people greatly
exceeds that in academia, if the
homophobic and transphobic
welcome to Bailey given by the
Stanford Department of Psy
chology is any indication.

On April 23, Psychology Prof. Michael
Bailey from Northwestern University
presented a lecture entitled "Gender
Nonconformity and Sexual Orientation"
to the Stanford University Psychology
Department as part of its regularly sched
uled departmental lecture series.
The audience, including about 10 fac
ulty and 100 students, enjoyed laughing
at pictures, quotations and voice record
ings of gay, lesbian and transgendered
people. The material consisted mostly of
film clips and animated cartoons. At no
point was the audience admonished to
assume a professional decorum. No fac
ulty challenged the scholarship, and crit
icism of the evidently limited sampling
was left to several graduate students.
Bailey was introduced as "controver
sial," someone whose work has important
implications for law, medicine and social

policy and as a successful teacher whose
courses feature "Transsexuals stripping
after class." (First big laugh.) The initial
photographs included a male-bodied
child wearing her mother's shoes, when
the second round of laughter erupted. A
female-bodied child was then shown in
male clothes and quoted as saying she
"wanted a penis," again producing
laughter. In another example, an older
child in a clinical setting was given the
choice of toys and chose a doll and a wig.
She was quoted as saying, "1 hate my
