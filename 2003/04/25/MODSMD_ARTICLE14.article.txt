# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Commemorating a close friendship, alum reflects on peer's life 
### D. BOSZAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Editor's Note: The following is a guest column
commemorating the life of Vusumzi Silwana,
Class of2ool, who recently passed away.

"Living for one's self is too easy" V usumzi
Silwana explained in a slow baritone. He
was pulling the edge of his hat down near his
eyes — as it literally tightening his thinking
cap — as he distilled his thoughts on a com
plex subject down to a single phrase. His
words stuck with me, not only because of
their simple wisdom, but also because they
seemed to be a verbal reflection of his being.
Coming from a family of 11 kids in rural

South Africa, it's not all that surprising that
Vusi learned to share early on. It's the ex
tent of his sharing and his ability to recog
nize the wealth he had to share that were
particularly striking. We would be furious
ly hammering out programming code at 4
a.m., surrounded by crushed Coke cans
and empty terminals in Sweet Hall trying
to meet a deadline, when Vusi would stop
his work to help me with a bug in mine.
Later on, I would learn that he wasn't even
in the class he was coding for. He had de
cided to take on a project of his own partly
out of his pure passion for the computer
science, partly just to keep me company.
Vusi and I frequently chased this sort of
marathon coding session with a snack. He'd

have to stand up to turn
the pedals on his old, yel
low weather-beaten bike
as we cranked our way
down to Carl's Junior.
When it's late and you're
hungry, you take what
you can get. When it came
to be Vusi's birthday, how
ever, a bunch of friends of-

fered to take him out for dinner wherever
he wanted. Expecting him to select any
number of University Ave. yuppie stalls,
our eyes bulged a little when Vusi opted for
a "Carl's burger and curly fries."
It's not that Vusi disliked a steak and lob
ster dinner; rather, it seemed to me that he

recognized his good fortune to have good
ftiends and ample food on his birthday and
asked for nothing more, inadvertently
highlighting the richness of our everyday
lives.
Vusi would often talk about South
Africa with a special sort of smile. "When
you guys come down South," he would
begin, "we'll get you a nice pig from the
yard." He would then go through the
steps of what kind of side vegetables we
would have and exactly how tender the
meat would be. Of course we would
squirm a little at the thought of killing a
pig, but the underlying message was the
unconditional welcome to his home. Vusi
welcomed us into all aspects of his life,

from the three clicks of his native tongue,
Xhosa, to his stories of "Alfonso the Big
Man," his 6-year-old younger brother.
Living for one's self is too easy and Vusi
was never one to take the easy way out. Al
though I won't ever be able to go "down
South" with Vusi, I will bring Vusi's wis
dom with me wherever I go, sharing his
companionship, his recognition of our
good fortune and his unconditional wel
come wherever I am.
A candlelight memorial service will be
held in the garden of Bechtel Internation
al Center at 8 p.m. on April 26. All are wel
come to come as Vusi's friends share sto
ries to celebrate his life and commemorate
his loss.
