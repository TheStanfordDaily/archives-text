## At halfway point, Card is leader of the Pac 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Throughout the first half of the Pacific-10
Conference season, the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal
earned a two-game lead over both Arizona and
No. 11 Arizona State by winning all four league
series it played, the most important of which was
a pivotal set atTempe over the Sun Devils to start
the Pac-10 schedule.
The Cardinal (27-11, 9-3 Pac-10) now enters
the last 12 conference games within sight of its first
league tide since the 2000 season. But Stanford
kicks off the second half against the Pac-10's sur
prise team —Arizona—while Arizona State hosts
lowly Washington State, a circumstance that
makes a series win over the Wildcats (28-15,7-5) a
must for head coach Mark Marquess' squad.
Should Arizona steal two from the Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond and die Sun Devils sweep the
Cougars as expected, the Pac-10 standings would
see three teams tied at the top.
"I feel good," Marquess said. "1 would rather
have a two-game lead than be down by two. But,
at the same time, 1 think we need to improve in
the second half. We need to be more consistent,
and that starts with pitching and defense."
While Marquess may have his doubts, Stan
ford would be hard-pressed to find more consis
tency than it has shown over the past two months.
The Cardinal is 18-4 in March and April, a re
markable recovery from a sluggish start to 2003.
However, the second half of the conference
schedule brings difficult road series against
Southern California in Los .Angeles and against

the Golden Bears in Berkeley.
Unless Arizona State falters this weekend, Stan
ford will be unable to take complete control of die
Pac-10 race, but it can effectively knock die Wild
cats out of contention in what has been an out
standing season under head coach Andy fxipez.
Arizona has cooled lately, losing three of its last
five ballgames, but the Wildcats have won five of
their last seven Pac-10 games and will enter this
series eager to prove their metde against fourth
ranked Stanford.
With so much riding on the series, the Cardi
nal must get quality play from its senior catcher
Ryan Garko to stop the lethal running game of
Arizona. The Wildcats have legged out 40 triples
and stolen 111 bases this season — mind-bog
gling totals halfway through the season.
"Arizona presents a unique challenge because
they run so much, more than anybody else that
we've played all year," Marquess said.
Garko has thrown out 37 percent of runners
attempting to steal against him this season, com
pared with sophomore Donny Lucy's more de
pendable 56 percent. Because of Lucy's abilities
behind the plate, Marquess may elect to start the
sophomore at catcher and move his senior leader
to the designated hitter role.
However, Garko has dramatically improved
his skills behind the plate this season and his lead
ership and management abilities should keep

him in the battery this weekend.
At the plate, the story for the Cardinal contin
ues to be junior Carlos Quentin's pursuit of the
Stanford record books. The right fielder's cur
rent 26-game hit streak has lifted his average to a
Pac-10-leading .434, four points ahead of the
Stanford single-season record set by Tom
Williams in 1971.
Quentin is also within 11 games of Jeffrey
Hammonds' school-record 37-game hitting
streak and shows no signs of slowing down.
During the tear, Quentin has collected 51 hits
in 103 at-bats, fallingjust a triple short of the cycle
on Tuesday against Sacramento State. In addition,
he leads the Cardinal in seven offensive categories,
including extra-base hits (26) and total bases (100).
Tonight, Stanford can expect another stellar
outing from junior John Hudgins, who has al
lowed just three earned runs in his last 29 innings.
He will lock horns with Wildcat starter Ric hie
Gardner, who is 6-1 with a 3.63 ERA this season.
Marquess has not announced his other two
starters for the weekend, but freshman Mark Ro
manczuk and his 8-0 record will likely get the call
tomorrow against Arizona's Sean Rierson.
Romanczuk has been outstanding in his rookie
campaign for the Cardinal, and Rierson's 7-1
record is one of his several impressive numbers
this season, making Saturday's matinee an excel
lent matchup.
Perhaps Sunday's matchup is the most illus
trative of the importance of this series for the Car
dinal. For the potentially decisive contest, both
teams' listings for their starting pitchers mirror
the unpredictable state of the Pac-10: TBA.
