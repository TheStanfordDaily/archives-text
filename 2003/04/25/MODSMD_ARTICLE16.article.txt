Coming off an 11-2 victory over
San Jose State last week to close out
the regular season, the Cardinal has
high hopes heading into the tour
nament.
"I'm really excited," said Villa,
who scored three goals in the regu
lar season finale. "Everyone gets
better each week and everything is
finally coming together. We're all
on the same page and we're func
tioning really well right now; it's ex
citing."
Senior goalie Jackie Frank, who
will also be playing in her last MPSF
tournament, put the weekend in
perspective:
"This is a do-or-die situation for
us," Frank said. "It should be a real
ly competitive tournament. Fora lot
of teams, this may be their last tour
nament of the season. It's going to
be really intense."
Despite the pressure, both Villa
and Frank feel the team is well-pre
pared to capture the MPSF" champi
onship and possibly exact a little re
venge along the way.
"I think we've been really click
ing at practice," Frank said. "After
losing to Long Beach a couple week
ends ago, it really hurt us. I think

we're really pumped up to play
against them this time."
With a win on Friday, Frank and
the Cardinal could get that chance.
Stanford will most likely meet the
fourth-seeded 49ers, who handed
the Cardinal an 8-7 defeat three
weeks ago, in Saturday's semifinals.
If the Cardinal gets by Long
Beach State, odds are they would
match up in the final against either
second-seeded USC or third-seed
ed UCLA, whom they lost to in last
year's championship game.
Stanford went 2-1 against the Bru
ins during the regular season, win
ning twice at home and losing in the
tinal of the Santa Barbara Invitational.
The Cardinal must win on Fri
day and Saturday to clinch an auto
matic berth in the NCAA tourna

in San Diego. year, the Cardi
nal received the lone at-large bid to
the four-team tournament on its
way to the national title.
"I want to be there," Villa said.
"We need to play well Friday, Satur
day, and Sunday and make sure
that we control our destiny. The ball
is in our court so we are going to ex
ecute our game plan and be in the
driver's seat."
Winning the MPSF would not
only guarantee the Cardinal a spot
in the NCAAs but would secure the
No. 1 seed in the tournament as
well.
Despite the home-pool advan
tage, the Cardinal is not overlooking
any of its competition this weekend.
