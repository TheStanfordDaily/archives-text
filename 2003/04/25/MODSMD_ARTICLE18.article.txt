# Picky, picky, picky

### 
So it's come down to this.
Three seconds on the clock...
I can't bear to watch.
Two...
Oh, the drama!
One...
Brace yourself.
Zero.
And with the 10th pick in the
seventh round, the Seattle Sea
hawks select Rufus Jones, center,
Southwest Northeast Louisiana
Tech.
What were you expecting, an-

other NBA play
off buzzer-beat
er? Please.
Such is the
nature of the
NFL Draft, a
two-day, 17-
hour, 226-pick
extravaganza re
plete with more
clock-watching

than New Year's Eve or a Friday
afternoon lecture.
The hype preceding the event
is more overkill than department
stores putting out Christmas or
naments and lights the day after
Halloween.
That's not to say the 2003 N FL
Draft, which begins tomorrow,
won't have its moments and an
swer some intriguing questions.
What trades will go down?
Who's the next Ryan Leaf?
Where will Stanford's own
Teyo Johnson, Kwame Harris
and Colin Branch end up?
I'm personally rooting for
Teyo to have a Yao-esque rookie
year, catapulting him into the
next Visa Check Card commer
cial. I can see it now:
Teyo: "Can I write a check?"
Cashier (pointing at "No
checks allowed" sign): "Yo."
Teyo: "Tey-yo. Can I write a
check?"
Cashier (pointing at sign):
"Yo."
And, well, you get the picture.
But I digress.
Without further ado, I give
you the ultimate guide to the
NFL Draft (the first 10 picks any
way):
1. Cincinnati: New
masochist, err, coach Marvin
Lewis is in great position to turn
the hapless Bengals into a play
off contender — that is if he can
somehow sucker the rest of the
league's owners into trading
picks 2-32 fora No. 1 pick and
Akili Smith package in the name
of parity.
Pick: Carson Palmer, QB,
use
2. Detroit: Joey Harrington

was decidedly mediocre as a
rookie, at least partially due to a
wide receiver corps that could
rival any team — for worst in the
league.
Pick: Charles Rogers, VVR,
Michigan State
3. Houston: We have a prob
lem —of Gilbert Brown and
William "Refrigerator" Perry
proportions. There's not a single
player in the draft or on this plan
et large or skilled enough to help
shore up an offensive line that
gave up an NFL-record 76 sacks.
Is the Michelin Man available?
Pick: After head coach Dom
Capers' motion to establish a six-
Mississippi rule was shot down,
the Texans put their faith — and
David Carr's life —in the very
large hands of Kwame Harris, T,
Stanford.
4. Chicago: Many considered
the Bears the most disappointing
team of the year but should their
4-12 record really have come as a
surprise? Seriously folks, Jim
Miller was their starting quarter
back and not even Redskins
coach Steve Spurrier would put
his faith in Jim — oh, wait.
Pick: Jimmy Kennedy, DT,
Penn State
5. Dallas: Things just won't be
the same in Big D without old No.
22 in the backfield. Emmitt
Smith's departure to the desert
means the 'Boys need an identity
and early returns say that Quincy
Carter doesn't fit the bill. Ameri
ca's team isn't even Texas' team
anymore and nobody's happier
about that than yours truly.
Pick: Terrell Suggs, DE, Ari
zona State
6. Arizona: Draft Day is tradi
tionally the second most exciting
day of the year for Cardinals fans.
The first being the day they re
ceive advance-order playoff ticket
refunds in the mail.
Pick: Byron Leftwich, QB,
Marshall
7. Minnesota: And with the
seventh pick in the 2003 NFL
Draft, the Minnesota Vikings se
lect the Honorable Ralph
Poindexter, Fifth Circuit Judge.
Five years ago, many around the
league questioned the Vikings
for taking a chance on a trouble
maker named Randy Moss. Five
years later, problem solved.
Pick: Terence Newman, CB,
Kansas State
8. Jacksonville: Outside of the
Arena Football league, nothing
has the potential to make a rickety
old quarterback (Mark Brunell)
look better than a young, athletic
burner.
Pick: Andre Johnson, WR,


Scotf Allen
Miami
9. Carolina: And here I was
thinking the rights to the colors
black and silver belonged to Cray
ola! The Panthers will look to ac
quire legal support early amid whis
pers that Raiders owner /VI Davis is
prepared to sue Carolina if it picks a
player the Raiders were planning to
pick later in the round.
Pick: Jordan Gross, OT, Utah
10. Baltimore: Quite frankly, it's
hard to see where the Ravens need
help. With football super-genius

Brian Billick running the show, you
can chalk last year's poor perfor
mance up to plain and simple bad
luck. Sure, Einstein invented a lot of
cool stuff, but did he win a Super
Bowl with Trent Dilfer at quarter
back?
Pick: Kyle Boiler, QB, California
Enjoy the draft, or better yet,
check out next year's potential first
round picks at the Cardinal and
White scrimmage. The Bengals,
and your life, are on the clock.

Scott Allen is an undeclared sophomore
who only hopes Kwarne Harris enjoys
more success than former No. 1 NBA
draft-pick Kwame Brown. E-mail him

wide receiver corps that could
rival any team — for worst in the
league.
Pick: Charles Rogers, VVR,
Michigan State
3. Houston: We have a prob
lem —of Gilbert Brown and
William "Refrigerator" Perry
proportions. There's not a single
player in the draft or on this plan
et large or skilled enough to help
shore up an offensive line that
gave up an NFL-record 76 sacks.
Is the Michelin Man available?
Pick: After head coach Dom
Capers' motion to establish a six-
Mississippi rule was shot down,
the Texans put their faith — and
David Carr's life —in the very
large hands of Kwame Harris, T,
Stanford.
4. Chicago: Many considered
the Bears the most disappointing
team of the year but should their
4-12 record really have come as a
surprise? Seriously folks, Jim
Miller was their starting quarter
back and not even Redskins
coach Steve Spurrier would put
his faith in Jim — oh, wait.
Pick: Jimmy Kennedy, DT,
Penn State
5. Dallas: Things just won't be
the same in Big D without old No.
22 in the backfield. Emmitt
Smith's departure to the desert
means the 'Boys need an identity
and early returns say that Quincy
Carter doesn't fit the bill. Ameri
ca's team isn't even Texas' team
anymore and nobody's happier
about that than yours truly.
Pick: Terrell Suggs, DE, Ari
zona State
6. Arizona: Draft Day is tradi
tionally the second most exciting
day of the year for Cardinals fans.
The first being the day they re
ceive advance-order playoff ticket
refunds in the mail.
Pick: Byron Leftwich, QB,
Marshall
7. Minnesota: And with the
seventh pick in the 2003 NFL
Draft, the Minnesota Vikings se
lect the Honorable Ralph
Poindexter, Fifth Circuit Judge.
Five years ago, many around the
league questioned the Vikings
for taking a chance on a trouble
maker named Randy Moss. Five
years later, problem solved.
Pick: Terence Newman, CB,
Kansas State
8. Jacksonville: Outside of the
Arena Football league, nothing
has the potential to make a rickety
old quarterback (Mark Brunell)
look better than a young, athletic
burner.
Pick: Andre Johnson, WR,


Scotf Allen
Miami
9. Carolina: And here I was
thinking the rights to the colors
black and silver belonged to Cray
ola! The Panthers will look to ac
quire legal support early amid whis
pers that Raiders owner /VI Davis is
prepared to sue Carolina if it picks a
player the Raiders were planning to
pick later in the round.
Pick: Jordan Gross, OT, Utah
10. Baltimore: Quite frankly, it's
hard to see where the Ravens need
help. With football super-genius

Brian Billick running the show, you
can chalk last year's poor perfor
mance up to plain and simple bad
luck. Sure, Einstein invented a lot of
cool stuff, but did he win a Super
Bowl with Trent Dilfer at quarter
back?
Pick: Kyle Boiler, QB, California
Enjoy the draft, or better yet,
check out next year's potential first
round picks at the Cardinal and
White scrimmage. The Bengals,
and your life, are on the clock.

So it's come down to this.
Three seconds on the clock...
I can't bear to watch.
Two...
Oh, the drama!
One...
Brace yourself.
Zero.
And with the 10th pick in the
seventh round, the Seattle Sea
hawks select Rufus Jones, center,
Southwest Northeast Louisiana
Tech.
What were you expecting, an-

other NBA play
off buzzer-beat
er? Please.
Such is the
nature of the
NFL Draft, a
two-day, 17-
hour, 226-pick
extravaganza re
plete with more
clock-watching

than New Year's Eve or a Friday
afternoon lecture.
The hype preceding the event
is more overkill than department
stores putting out Christmas or
naments and lights the day after
Halloween.
That's not to say the 2003 N FL
Draft, which begins tomorrow,
won't have its moments and an
swer some intriguing questions.
What trades will go down?
Who's the next Ryan Leaf?
Where will Stanford's own
Teyo Johnson, Kwame Harris
and Colin Branch end up?
I'm personally rooting for
Teyo to have a Yao-esque rookie
year, catapulting him into the
next Visa Check Card commer
cial. I can see it now:
Teyo: "Can I write a check?"
Cashier (pointing at "No
checks allowed" sign): "Yo."
Teyo: "Tey-yo. Can I write a
check?"
Cashier (pointing at sign):
"Yo."
And, well, you get the picture.
But I digress.
Without further ado, I give
you the ultimate guide to the
NFL Draft (the first 10 picks any
way):
1. Cincinnati: New
masochist, err, coach Marvin
Lewis is in great position to turn
the hapless Bengals into a play
off contender — that is if he can
somehow sucker the rest of the
league's owners into trading
picks 2-32 fora No. 1 pick and
Akili Smith package in the name
of parity.
Pick: Carson Palmer, QB,
use
2. Detroit: Joey Harrington

was decidedly mediocre as a
rookie, at least partially due to a
wide receiver corps that could
rival any team — for worst in the
league.
Pick: Charles Rogers, VVR,
Michigan State
3. Houston: We have a prob
lem —of Gilbert Brown and
William "Refrigerator" Perry
proportions. There's not a single
player in the draft or on this plan
et large or skilled enough to help
shore up an offensive line that
gave up an NFL-record 76 sacks.
