# Softball hits the road to face Huskies, Bruins
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford Softball team (34-18,4-8
Pacific-10 Conference) has completed the roller
coaster ride that was the first half of the Pat-10
season. The ups include a win at No. 1 Arizona
and the downs being swept in three games with
No. 10 California. But the second half of confer
ence play begins today, and Stanford hopes to
duplicate its ups and eradicate its downs in the
remainder of Pac-10 play.
This weekend the Cardinal meets No. 3 Wash
ington (27-7,5-5) and No. 2 UCLA (36-5,8-3).
The battle begins in Seattle where the Cardi
nal will fight to bring back its third win over the
Huskies this season. Stanford last faced Wash
ington March 30, when it was led to a 4-0 win by
junior hurler Dana Sorensen's no-hitter.
"We are definitely looking to win," senior

pitcher Tory Nyberg said.. "1 think that Dana
has pitched extremely well against Washington
and they haven't been able to hit her yet,"
Sorensen's success has not been tested in the
Seattle winds this season, but the Cardinal's
memory of last year's trip up north has them
eager for revenge.
"We are really motivated to beat them at Wash
ington," Nyberg said. "Our history playing up
there has been frustrating, last year we dropped
both games. So we really want to take a win up
there."
The Cardinal's desire fora win will be
matched by the Huskies wanting of redemp

tion after UCLA swept the Huskies this past
weekend.
As much as the Huskies are looking to bounce
back from a Bruin beating, UCLA will be looking
to add on to its conference success.
UCLA's only Pac-10 losses so tar this season were
dealt by No. 1 Arizona, a team Stanford beat 4-3 two
weeks ago. Lhat victory inspires confidence in the
Cardinal heading down to Los Angeles.
"Any given day we can win any game," Nyberg
said. "We are definitely going down there wanti
ng and looking to take two games from UCLA"
following a disappointing weekend in which
the Cardinal was swept by California in three
one-run decisions — the Stanford squad is
searching fora swing in momentum.
"I think that following last weekend we are a
little bit frustrated," Nyberg said. "And so we are
looking to turn things around and get some mo
mentum going in the right direction."
