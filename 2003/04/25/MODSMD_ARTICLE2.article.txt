# Univ. sets living-wage guidelines
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford administrators released the University's
living-wage guidelines yesterday, which call for com
panies contracted by the University to pay their em
ployees a minimum of $ 10.10 per hour if health ben
efits are provided and $11.35 per hour if no health
benefits are provided.
The guidelines will not apply to workers directly
paid by the University, temporary workers or work
ers belonging to a union.
Representatives from both the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition and SEIU Local 715 — a union cover
ing all the organized workers directly employed by
Stanford — complained that the guidelines are inef
fective, particularly because they apply to such a small
number of workers.
The guidelines begin, "Stanford University recog
nizes the importance of paying a living-wage to all ser
vice workers at Stanford, whether they are directly
employed by Stanford or by contractors ... Stanford
already pays a living-wage to its employees and now
adopts this living-wage and benefit policy to guide its
procurement of such services from contractors."
A proposed version of these guidelines was re
leased by administrators last year and drew fire from
activists and the ASSU for not seeking enough stu
dent and worker input into the process. According to
Vice President for Public Affairs Gordon Earle, the
University has "sought input in many ways" since the

release of the proposed guidelines.
"We asked for and received feedback from the fac
ulty and student senates; we participated in public fo
rums; President Hennessy met with students to dis
cuss the guidelines, as did a number of his senior
staff," Earle said. "Many opportunities were provided
for input, and these same opportunities will be avail
able in the future for students, faculty and others."
Companies that sign new contracts with the Uni
versity or renew old contracts will be required to fol
low the guidelines, although "there may be unfore
seen circumstances where an exception is appropri
ate," according to the document.
Based on "staff recommendations [and] informed
by input from affected contractors and other interest
ed parties," the guidelines dictate that wage and ben
efit levels will be reviewed every year. Stanford's Pres
ident will ultimately determine these levels. The
guidelines also require that contractors give 10 com
pensated days off annually to employees who have
been working for the company for at least one year.
Said SLAC Co-Coordinator .Anna Mumford, a
sophomore, "Because no research was released and
because there was little effort to include workers and
students in the formation of the policy, we are left to
assume that this is nothing more than a public rela
tions move."
Mumford also compared the living-wage guide
lines to the University's new Alcohol Policy, claiming,
