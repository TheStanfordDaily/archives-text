The performances and games of Stanford's second
annual Community Day on April 6 were momentarily
interrupted by workers and students marching in front
of the Oval, shouting and waving signs demanding that
the University recognize workers as an important part
of its community. The rally was only the most recent
manifestation of a long series of struggles between the
University and its workers.
"We're always somewhat on the defensive," said
Roxana Rivera, worksite organizing director of SEIU
Local 715, the union representing directly hired Uni
versity workers. "It's a struggle because everything is
seen as a business decision from an economical per
spective. No one's looking out for the workers."
Stanford's current student labor movement can be
traced to 1994 when four University students staged a
three-day hunger strike to protest the conditions of
U.S. grape farmers. This led to a boycott of grapes in
University dining halls that lasted for several years.
Alter watching videos and being given pamphlets
about the grape issue, individual dorms voted each
year on whether they wanted to participate in the boy
cott. By 2000, however, student interest in the grape
boycott waned to such an extent that the annual voting
was ended.
Stanford activists used the grape boycott to make
others more aware of labor issues that they said affect
ed the Stanford community. In tandem with dorm
votes concerning the grape boycott, MEChA and Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stanford held a con
ference that consisted of a series of speakers and pro
grams in November 1998. From this temporary union
between the two student organizations, a new Stanford
group — the Stanford Labor Action Coalition — was
founded in January 1999.
Working with SEIU Local 715 and SEIU Local 1877
— two unions with workers on the Stanford campus,
collectively representing about 2,500 employees —
SLAC has been a driving force in promoting campus
awareness of labor issues and in lobbying for better
treatment of Stanford workers.
