## Labor at Stanford

has been marked by numerous small battles, rather
than any singular sweeping campaign, a fact that frus
trates activists.
"We don't want to have all these little lights all the
time," Rivera said. "Wejust want Stanford to accept the
unionization of its workers, tojust say 'yes' to that."
Prior to the actual formation of SLAC, but aided by
many future SLAC members, roughly 1,500 workers at
Stanford and Lucille Packard Hospitals won their first
ever contract, having struggled to organize with the
union for over two years. Nursing assistants, house
keepers and dietary workers were all successfully
unionized, and for the first time their work was gov
erned by an official document.
"This was huge," Rivera said. "There are about 60

other Bay Area hospitals, and they already were orga
nized —just not at Stanford."
Among the issues that SIAC has addressed are the
Justice for Janitors contract campaign, the Bon Appetit
contract campaign, contract campaigns at both the
University and hospital and recently, the code of con
duct campaign.
Justice for Janitors
The nationwide Justice for Janitors campaign was
initiated in the spring of 2000 and, at Stanford, in
volved a worker / student rally of 400 protesters that
blocked a major campus intersection. Protesters pre
sented a petition signed by over 500 students to the
local office of American Building Maintenance, a

statewide janitorial services company that contracts to
Stanford.
At the time, Associate Vice Provost and Director of
Facilities Operations Chris Christofterson told The
Daily that the University "is not party, legally [or] oth
erwise, to the [current] negotiation process [between
the union and ABM]. As such, the University will not at
tempt to intervene in the negotiations."
Debra Zumwalt, acting University general counsel
at the time, argued that responsibility for making sure
the workers' concerns are addressed lay not with the
University, but with union representatives.
"|The unions are] the ones who have the responsi-

bility and authority to negotiate on
behalf of the workers," she said. "It
would be presumptuous of Stan
ford to say that they know better
what the janitors want than their
duly elected union officials."
A survey of Stanford janitors
found that janitors on campus re
ceived pay significantly below the
minimum student worker's wage.
As a result of the campaign, the
union reached a settlement with
ABM, and janitors received a 9 per
cent pay raise for each year of the
three-year contract, in addition to
an agreement for all ABM-em
ployed Bay Area janitors — includ
ing those at Stanford — to receive
an hourly-wage increase. When the
contract ended in 2002, on-campus
janitors were paid an average annu
al salary of $20,820, a $4,740 in
crease from what janitors made
prior to this SLAC- and SEIU-led
campaign.
However, SLAC and SKI U Local
1877 — the local chapter ola
statewide union representing sub
contracted janitors — had been
hoping for more concessions. I his
settlement was one ol many "partial
victories" that SLAC has been
forced to accept, according to ju
nior Leticia Ramirez, the group's
co-coordinator.
Another victory occurred in Sep
tember 2000, when over 1,100
Stanford campus workers won
wage increases and better retire
ment benefits in the triennial con
tract review process. However, the
University continued to rely heavily
on temp workers, despite previous
agreements restricting their use.
"(These agreements] are always,
always, always not respected,
Rivera said. "We have to be watch
dogs for that constantly.'
Bon Appetit
More recently, Stanford labor
activists were involved in a struggle
to win parity wages and more af
fordable health care for employees
of Bon Appetit Management Com
pany, which currently operates the
Bon Appetit cafeteria and the Cof

fee House, both in Tresidder
Union. In May 2002, more than 50
Stanford students staged a "sleep
out" in the Main Quad to draw at
tention to what they saw as unjust
working conditions for the subcon
tracted Bon Appetit workers.
Bon Appetit is not contractually
obligated to offer its employees the
same wages and benefits given to
workers directly hired by Dining
Services. The starting wage for
Bon Appetit workers was $8.50 an
hour with benefits — less than
those of directly hired Stanford
workers, who made a minimum of
$10.10 an hour, according to the
protest's organizers.
Shortly following the sleepout, a
new contract was agreed upon that
would phase in wage parity over a
period of two years. In addition, the
monthly cost of health benefits and
dental benefits for Bon Appetit
workers was reduced.
Again, the University did not in
volve itself with the negotiations.
At the time, Hennessy told The
Daily, "We've certainly had a few
discussions with Bon Appetit, but
we've avoided interfering with the
negotiations."
This fall, Stanford Dining will as
sume control of the eateries in
Tresidder and catering service cur
rently run by Bon Appetit.
Subcontracting: 'The largest force
undercutting workers today'?
Perhaps the most dramatic labor
action of the past few years has been
the extended campaign against
subcontracting and what activists
describe as unfair contract benefits
at Stanford's hospitals.
"Subcontracting has really been
the largest force undercutting
workers today," said senior
Meghana Reddy, a member of
SLAC. " Twenty percent of [Stan
ford] workers are currently subcon
tracted, and with subcontracting,
workers aren't trained properly,
are called one day to work then
called the next day and told not to
come in. Subcontracted workers
earn 25 percent less than do union
contract employees, receive fewer
benefits and frequently have prob
lems organizing a union."
I n November 2001, a coalition of
student groups, in partnership with

SKIU Local 715, entered Stanford
Hospital to demonstrate against the
outsourcing of 10 housekeeping
positions at three area medical facil
ities. As a result, six students were
arrested, charged with trespassing
and convicted.
Some students met with Hen
nessy a week later while students
and workers rallied outside the
meeting. Hennessy promised to en
sure that the subcontracted jobs
would pay a living wage and offer
health care.
"Stanford will continue to sub
contract but will review the sub
contracting it does to ensure that
workers are not being unfairly
treated," said Gene Awakuni, vice
provost for student affairs, at the
time of the meeting.
The administration also em
phasized that the hospital has its
own chief executive officer and
board of advisers and that the Uni
versity therefore has no jurisdic
tion over its subcontracting and
unionization policies.
In 2002, further controversy
surrounding the hospital devel
oped. With negotiations fora new
contract underway, hospital work
ers went on a one-day strike to ad
vocate for higher wages and im
proved conditions.
While some students believed
that 1 lennessy is in a position to in
fluence the hospitals' labor policies,

the University administration
maintained that it is not involved in
the hospitals' internal affairs.
Finally, on Dec. 19, 2002, the
hospitals ratified a new contract
with their employees that provided
an average pay increase of 21 per
cent over three years, workplace
benefits and job security, and a new
pay scale recognizing seniority
among the 1,400 unionized work
ers at the hospitals.
However, SLAG members said
they believe that the hospitals have
thus far neglected to follow through
on parts of the contract, particular
ly regarding health-care benefits
and providing a living wage for sub
contracted workers.
"The amended hospital con
tracts promised to increase pay by
$2 an hour, and workers have not
received health care, although this
was promised," Keddy said.
Living wage and code of conduct
Closely related to the hospital
campaign, SI AC is also attempting
to convince the University to ratify a
code of conduct that members say
would institutionalize worker re
spect through fair wages and bene
fits at Stanford. It would also create
a ban on outsourcing any work cur
rently done by permanent employ
ees.
"There are temp workers who
spend seven to eight years (in

their temp position]," Ramirez
said. "They only make $7 or $8 an
hour versus a starting wage of $11
an hour with health care for lull
time employees."
I lennessy responded to activists'
demands fora code of conduct by
releasing living-wage guidelines
that require companies contracted
by the University to pay non-union
ized employees $ 10.10 per hour for
those who receive health benefits
and $ 11.35 for those who don't.
Activists have not been placated.
"It does not address the right to
unionize, an end to subcontracting
and a true living wage, ensuring no
decreases in wages," said SLAC Co-
Coordinator Clara Webb, a senior.
Christofferson defended the liv
ing wage, claiming that the Univer
sity is "really more in a position of
leading than of following, as you see
in our adoption of the living-wage
policy. We're one of only a handful
of universities to have adopted
something like this."
Continuing conflicts
The battle over labor issues con
tinues to Ix.' fought on Stanford's
campus. Over time, labor organiz
ers have recognized the need to
concentrate their efforts, and their
goals have evolved. While campus
debates once centered largely on
demands for worker salary increas
es, activists today are stressing more

general issues such as unionization.
Said Zev Kvitky, president of
United Stanford Workers— Stan
ford's local chapter of SEIU 715,
founded in 1973 — "Most employ
ees don't even have a
union . . . We've been trying to
move the focus away from small bat
tles over wages and benefits in
order to put more emphasis on
larger issues like subcontracting
and temp workers."
Kvitky expressed concern about
the growing use of these employ
ment practices.
"This practice allows Stanford
management to absolve themselves
of all responsibility for the wages,
benefits and working conditions of
such employees," Kvitky said. "If
Stanford needs work done, we be
lieve they should hire workers to
perform the needed jobs and pro
vide them with <i living wage, health
benefits and basic job securities. In
other words, we believe that Stan
ford should be a fair and responsi
ble employer."
Stanford's administration, how
ever, has a different point of view.
"In any kind of venture, it's
reasonable to do a make-or-buy
kind of analysis," Christofferson
said. "It's not at all unusual for
universities to do the same, espe
cially when providing basic sup
port services that are not unique
to higher education."
