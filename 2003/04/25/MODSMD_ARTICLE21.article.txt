has been marked by numerous small battles, rather
than any singular sweeping campaign, a fact that frus
trates activists.
"We don't want to have all these little lights all the
time," Rivera said. "Wejust want Stanford to accept the
unionization of its workers, tojust say 'yes' to that."
Prior to the actual formation of SLAC, but aided by
many future SLAC members, roughly 1,500 workers at
Stanford and Lucille Packard Hospitals won their first

local office of American Building Maintenance, a

statewide janitorial services company that contracts to
Stanford.
At the time, Associate Vice Provost and Director of

Debra Zumwalt, acting University general counsel
at the time, argued that responsibility for making sure
the workers' concerns are addressed lay not with the
University, but with union representatives.

Students march toward the Stanford Hospital in November 2001 to protest the outsourcing of 10 housekeeping positions at three area medical facilities. During the subsequent
