# Union to renegotiate contract with ABM
## Health care among top concerns for subcontracted workers 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
SEIU Local 1877, a union with ap
proximately 120 members working on the
Stanford campus, will soon be renegotiat
ing its contract for its work at the Univer
sity. The negotiations will focus largely on
rising health-care costs, as well as pay and
the employment of temporary workers.
Students and union representatives
are appealing to Stanford administrators
to pressure American Building Mainte
nance, to which the University frequently
subcontracts campus cleaning duties, on
behalf of the workers. However, the Uni
versity is maintaining its tradition of non
involvement in negotiations between sub
contractors and their employees.
According to Flower De L&on, an orga
nizer for the union, most of the 120 jani
tors at Stanford are hired by ABM.
The union's three-year contract with
ABM will expire on April 30.
Along with concerns such as wages and
temporary workers, De Leon said that
health care is "one of the biggest issues" to

be settled between Local 1877 and ABM.
She noted that when the union recently
asked its members about what they felt
were the most important issues to address
in the negotiations, "Unanimously, [the
answer] was the health-care crisis."
Beth Trimarco, the communications
coordinator for Local 1877, said the
health care situation "is affecting all work
ers in Silicon Valley as health care
providers raise their premiums."
She said insurance companies have in
creased rates "enormously" in recent
years and that "the high-tech firms pass
those rising costs on to the backs of the jan
itors."
According to De Leon, janitors are cur
rently paying $77 per month for insur
ance costs, which could rise to $144 in the
coming year.
"The janitors are trying to stop these
increases," Trimarco said. "No one should
have to decide between rent, health care
and other costs."
Stanford Labor Action Coalition co-co
ordinator Anna Mumford, a sophomore,
emphasized that it can be difficult to un
derstand Stanford's role in the negotia
tion process since ABM is the actual hiring
contractor. But because the janitors are
subcontracted and work on campus, she
said the University has "the ability to say to
ABM that they want the workers to be able

to afford health care."
According toTrimarco, Local 1877 re
ceived a letter from University President
John Hennessy last week in which he ex
pressed his awareness of the janitors' diffi
culties.
Chris Christofferson, associate vice
provost and director of Facilities Opera
tions, said the University has taken note of
the workers' concerns.
"We agreed that the contractor's em
ployees have a compelling issue, and we
are monitoring the situation," he said. Fol
lowing Hennessy's letter to Local 1877,
Christofferson had a meeting with union
members that he described as "good and
productive."
When asked if she thought the current
negotiations would follow the path of East
Coast labor campaigns — such as the
strike at Yale University earlier this year
— Trimarco said it was important that
Stanford discussed the issue with Local
1877.
"We are hopeful," she said. "The letter
from Hennessy indicated that the Univer
sity was aware of the situation."
Christofferson said the University has
no plans to become involved in the collec
tive bargaining process between ABM and
Local 1877. He noted that in most situa-
