# The 						janitors dream awake
## A 						Stanford janitor reflects on University life 
### DOROTEO GARCIA GUEST COLUMNIST 
Many of us who clean Stanford Univer
sity are Mexican immigrants who come to
this country seeking opportunities that we
don't find in Mexico. When we come to
the United States, we leave everything in
our country — we leave family, children,
brothers, wives, husbands, our customs,
our houses, our dead. We only bring our
dreams, our illusions.
We are the ones who clean Stanford
University during the night, while every
one sleeps. Every night, for five days,
while we clean classrooms, auditoriums,
bookstores, offices, studios, or theaters,

we think about our family, about every
thing we left in our country. Sometimes,
to frighten off our nostalgia, we sing.
On our days off, some of us also write.
Everyone has different stories to tell, dif
ferent places to remember. The only
thing that we have in common is this job,
that we do enthusiastically, with determi
nation, with hopes of having better living
conditions. Through this work we sur
vive in this country. With the salary we
earn cleaning this university, we pay the
rent for our apartment or house, we give
our children food to eat, we send money
to our families in Mexico. Often, our
salary doesn't stretch far enough for
these things. Many of us have two jobs.
Others of us share an apartment or a
room with other people to help each
other economically.
For this reason, we hope that we can
always count on having this job. We've

witnessed many layoffs in other places, in
other companies. The Latino communi
ty has suffered a lot due to the terrorist at
tacks of Sept. 11. Many of our friends
have ended up without work. We see
them in the street, in our neighborhoods;
we hear them on the buses; they are our
friends or our family.
We don't want to be a burden on this
country. We don't want charity. We don't
want to harm anyone. We only want hon
est work. We want to be an important part
of this country's economic development.
This is what we, the janitors, think. We
want the students to get to know us. We
are people who feel; who suffer and
laugh like each of you.
