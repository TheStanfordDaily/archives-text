# Students, workers form productive relationships

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Workers and students cross each
other's paths every day in dining halls,
dorms and all over campus. Closely
linked in the university setting, it is hard
for either group to remain invisible to
the other. From brief conversation to
meaningful exchange, students and
workers have formed solid opinions of
one another and, in most cases, have
profited from this experience.
Although the majority of students
don't converse with workers on a reg
ular basis, many students expressed
their appreciation for the workers'
labor, emphasizing how much they de
pend on housekeeping and dining
hall staffs.
"Workers are the invisible backbone
at Stanford," said freshman Mark
Berghausen. "Without them, we'd be liv
ing in filthy dorms, and because I'd be
cooking, we'd be eating extremely poor
ly prepared food. Instead we've got im
maculate dorms antl incredible food,
and we have the underappreciated Stan
ford workers to thank."
Several workers affirmed that they
strive to maintain a level of invisibility as
they work, especially those involved in
grounds keeping and maintenance.
"Workers view students as our cus
tomers and clients," said Herb Fong, a
manager in the University's Grounds
Department. "We try to be the service of
choice and not even be noticeable while
everything gets magically done."
VVhile workers keep this policy in
mind, several expressed their enjoyment
in speaking with students and touched
on their desire to improve the general
quality of campus resources.
"When there is a chance for students
and staff to interact there is always a
good mix of actions antl reactions on
both sides," Fong said. "Staff works to
ensure the students are not negatively
impacted in their studies. Everything is
green, clean and healthy so students
don't have to worry about anything
other than to study and enjoy their sur
roundings."
Students seem to form stronger bonds

with dining hall and housekeeping
workers who they socialize with on a
more regular basis. Ricker Dining server
Maryann Lopeti said she has had posi
tive experiences with students since she
began working at Stanford in 1988.
"The kids are just like our children,"
Lopeti said. "We talk to them all the time,
and it really feels like a family."
Lopeti said she makes it a point not
only to offer everyone a warm greeting,
but also to know what is going on in the
lives of the students with whom she has
become familiar.
"I'll ask how their day was, especially
when they have exams," she said.
According to Lopeti, a few of the stu
dents she serves help tutor her 6-year
old son for an hour on weekends. Last
year, several students even helped
Lopeti, a native Spanish speaker, im
prove her English reading and writing
skills during their lunch breaks.
"Every year new kids come in, and
others go out, but now I have friends all
over campus," Lopeti said. "Kids from
everywhere can come to eat and still
know my name."
Although she emphasized the many
good experiences she's had with stu
dents during her career, Lopeti ac
knowledged that some appear to not be
interested in building friendships with
staff members.
"Some kids, you will try to talk to
them, and they will just walk by," she said.
Several students agreed that workers
are not treated with the level of respect
they deserve and stressed that workers
should never go unnoticed. Citing unfair
employment policies and student misbe
havior, they expressed the need for im
provement in treatment of the working
community.
"1 think the workers on campus are
integral to the Stanford community,"
said freshman Maricela Trevino. "I
think they are oftentimes overlooked
and there are many inconsiderate peo
ple who treat cleaning service people as
maids and expect them to clean up
their mess."
Students who share Trevino's senti-
