# Students, workers form productive relationships
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Workers and students cross each
other's paths every day in dining halls,
dorms and all over campus. Closely
linked in the university setting, it is hard
for either group to remain invisible to
the other. From brief conversation to
meaningful exchange, students and
workers have formed solid opinions of
one another and, in most cases, have
profited from this experience.
Although the majority of students
don't converse with workers on a reg
ular basis, many students expressed
their appreciation for the workers'
labor, emphasizing how much they de
pend on housekeeping and dining
hall staffs.
"Workers are the invisible backbone
at Stanford," said freshman Mark
Berghausen. "Without them, we'd be liv
ing in filthy dorms, and because I'd be
cooking, we'd be eating extremely poor
ly prepared food. Instead we've got im
maculate dorms antl incredible food,
and we have the underappreciated Stan
ford workers to thank."
Several workers affirmed that they
strive to maintain a level of invisibility as
they work, especially those involved in
grounds keeping and maintenance.
"Workers view students as our cus
tomers and clients," said Herb Fong, a
manager in the University's Grounds
Department. "We try to be the service of
choice and not even be noticeable while
everything gets magically done."
VVhile workers keep this policy in
mind, several expressed their enjoyment
in speaking with students and touched
on their desire to improve the general
quality of campus resources.
"When there is a chance for students
and staff to interact there is always a
good mix of actions antl reactions on
both sides," Fong said. "Staff works to
ensure the students are not negatively
impacted in their studies. Everything is
green, clean and healthy so students
don't have to worry about anything
other than to study and enjoy their sur
roundings."
Students seem to form stronger bonds

with dining hall and housekeeping
workers who they socialize with on a
more regular basis. Ricker Dining server
Maryann Lopeti said she has had posi
tive experiences with students since she
began working at Stanford in 1988.
"The kids are just like our children,"
Lopeti said. "We talk to them all the time,
and it really feels like a family."
Lopeti said she makes it a point not
only to offer everyone a warm greeting,
but also to know what is going on in the
lives of the students with whom she has
become familiar.
"I'll ask how their day was, especially
when they have exams," she said.
According to Lopeti, a few of the stu
dents she serves help tutor her 6-year
old son for an hour on weekends. Last
year, several students even helped
Lopeti, a native Spanish speaker, im
prove her English reading and writing
skills during their lunch breaks.
"Every year new kids come in, and
others go out, but now I have friends all
over campus," Lopeti said. "Kids from
everywhere can come to eat and still
know my name."
Although she emphasized the many
good experiences she's had with stu
dents during her career, Lopeti ac
knowledged that some appear to not be
interested in building friendships with
staff members.
"Some kids, you will try to talk to
them, and they will just walk by," she said.
Several students agreed that workers
are not treated with the level of respect
they deserve and stressed that workers
should never go unnoticed. Citing unfair
employment policies and student misbe
havior, they expressed the need for im
provement in treatment of the working
community.
"1 think the workers on campus are
integral to the Stanford community,"
said freshman Maricela Trevino. "I
think they are oftentimes overlooked
and there are many inconsiderate peo
ple who treat cleaning service people as
maids and expect them to clean up
their mess."
Students who share Trevino's senti-
ments often participate in activi
ties and protests sponsored by the
Labor Justice Union, hoping to
establish what they call a reason
able living wage for workers who
are consistently unappreciated.
When asked about the Uni
versity's employment policies,
Lopeti said, "Right now, we're
waiting for our contracts to be re
newed. We're just waiting and
hoping."
Lopeti mentioned the price of
parking stickers, which the Uni
versity continues to raise every
year. She expressed her hope that
the new contract would make this

aspect of working at Stanford
more affordable.
She touched briefly on the
demonstrations for labor justice
on Community Day and ex
pressed her appreciation for the
efforts of all the students who
were involved.
Others have discovered that
protest is not the only way to help
improve the quality of life for stall
members. Groups of students and
faculty on campus, realizing that
many Stanford employees speak
little or no English, have founded
tutoring organizations designed
to help workers learn.
These two programs, Work
place English Literacy and Habla
La Noche, teach dining hall and
housing workers relevant, job-re
lated vocabulary, literacy and

health-safety skills. While WEL
offers services for approximately
35 workers, Habla La Noche pro
vides English lessons for 20 night
shift employees who cannot at
tend tutoring sessions during the
daytime.
Habla La Noche President
Kelly Wells said, "It is important
to note that because the work of
the night janitors isolates them
so much from each other - often
one person will clean four or five
buildings by herself without see
ing anyone else - the fact that
the program brings them all to
gether twice a week is also strate
gic in terms of forming a
stronger community amongst
workers themselves."
According to Wells, many of
the students involved in the tu

toring program have formed
close relationships with the
workers involved. In fostering a
sense of community, some of the
male students have played soccer
in San Jose with the employees
they help teach.
"There are a couple of [work
ers] who call just to talk and
check up on me, to see how I'm
doing in my studies or how my
family is, or to discuss something
they're reading about or have
written," Wells said.
Currently Wells is working
with a janitor to help him publish
several of his essays and poems.
She said that she gains inspiration
from her work with these employ
ees. She also stressed that stu
dents and workers can be a valu
able resource for one another and

that they have more in common
than they might think.
"We all come from somewhere
else and are only here temporari
ly," Wells said. "That adjustment
can be really difficult, and
whether you're a student or a
worker, it's helpful to have some
one looking out for you and sup
porting you, whether morally or
logistically."
Said Omar Amador, a janitor
who works on campus, "I think
the tutoring is very necessary, be
cause it gives us a kind of educa
tion. I think it is important to at
tend their classes, and it has really
helped a lot."
Wells also said she movement
to overcome the language barrier
fuels the progress made toward
fair-labor policies.

"Student-staff interaction is
absolutely essential to the cam
pus labor movement," she said.
"As students, we can exert pres
sure in ways that the workers
cannot, but the ultimate goal is to
reach the point where we won't
have to do that, where the work
ers themselves have an estab
lished voice in the University ad
ministration.
"Until we get there, we have to
be in close contact and work to
gether intensively," she added.
Said freshman Michelle Er
drich, "[Workers] are our link to
the world that exists beyond the
Stanford bubble. They remind
us that though we are a specific
community, we are all still part of
a larger one that has effects on all
of us."

one another and, in most cases, have
profited from this experience.
Although the majority of students
don't converse with workers on a reg
ular basis, many students expressed
their appreciation for the workers'
labor, emphasizing how much they de
pend on housekeeping and dining
hall staffs.
"Workers are the invisible backbone
at Stanford," said freshman Mark
Berghausen. "Without them, we'd be liv
ing in filthy dorms, and because I'd be
cooking, we'd be eating extremely poor
ly prepared food. Instead we've got im
maculate dorms antl incredible food,
and we have the underappreciated Stan
ford workers to thank."
Several workers affirmed that they
strive to maintain a level of invisibility as
they work, especially those involved in
grounds keeping and maintenance.
"Workers view students as our cus
tomers and clients," said Herb Fong, a
manager in the University's Grounds
Department. "We try to be the service of
choice and not even be noticeable while
everything gets magically done."
VVhile workers keep this policy in
mind, several expressed their enjoyment
in speaking with students and touched
on their desire to improve the general
quality of campus resources.
"When there is a chance for students
and staff to interact there is always a
good mix of actions antl reactions on
both sides," Fong said. "Staff works to
ensure the students are not negatively
impacted in their studies. Everything is
green, clean and healthy so students
don't have to worry about anything
other than to study and enjoy their sur
roundings."
Students seem to form stronger bonds

with dining hall and housekeeping
workers who they socialize with on a
more regular basis. Ricker Dining server
Maryann Lopeti said she has had posi
tive experiences with students since she
began working at Stanford in 1988.
"The kids are just like our children,"
Lopeti said. "We talk to them all the time,
and it really feels like a family."
Lopeti said she makes it a point not
only to offer everyone a warm greeting,
but also to know what is going on in the
lives of the students with whom she has
become familiar.
"I'll ask how their day was, especially
when they have exams," she said.
According to Lopeti, a few of the stu
dents she serves help tutor her 6-year
old son for an hour on weekends. Last
year, several students even helped
Lopeti, a native Spanish speaker, im
prove her English reading and writing
skills during their lunch breaks.
"Every year new kids come in, and
others go out, but now I have friends all
over campus," Lopeti said. "Kids from
everywhere can come to eat and still
know my name."
Although she emphasized the many
good experiences she's had with stu
dents during her career, Lopeti ac
knowledged that some appear to not be
interested in building friendships with
staff members.
"Some kids, you will try to talk to
them, and they will just walk by," she said.
Several students agreed that workers
are not treated with the level of respect
they deserve and stressed that workers
should never go unnoticed. Citing unfair
employment policies and student misbe
havior, they expressed the need for im
provement in treatment of the working
community.
"1 think the workers on campus are
integral to the Stanford community,"
said freshman Maricela Trevino. "I
think they are oftentimes overlooked
and there are many inconsiderate peo
ple who treat cleaning service people as
maids and expect them to clean up
their mess."
Students who share Trevino's senti-
ments often participate in activi
ties and protests sponsored by the
Labor Justice Union, hoping to
establish what they call a reason
able living wage for workers who
are consistently unappreciated.
When asked about the Uni
versity's employment policies,
Lopeti said, "Right now, we're
waiting for our contracts to be re
newed. We're just waiting and
hoping."
Lopeti mentioned the price of
parking stickers, which the Uni
versity continues to raise every
year. She expressed her hope that
the new contract would make this

aspect of working at Stanford
more affordable.
She touched briefly on the
demonstrations for labor justice
on Community Day and ex
pressed her appreciation for the
efforts of all the students who
were involved.
Others have discovered that
protest is not the only way to help
improve the quality of life for stall
members. Groups of students and
faculty on campus, realizing that
many Stanford employees speak
little or no English, have founded
tutoring organizations designed
to help workers learn.
These two programs, Work
place English Literacy and Habla
La Noche, teach dining hall and
housing workers relevant, job-re
lated vocabulary, literacy and

health-safety skills. While WEL
offers services for approximately
35 workers, Habla La Noche pro
vides English lessons for 20 night
shift employees who cannot at
tend tutoring sessions during the
daytime.
Habla La Noche President
Kelly Wells said, "It is important
to note that because the work of
the night janitors isolates them
so much from each other - often
one person will clean four or five
buildings by herself without see
ing anyone else - the fact that
the program brings them all to
gether twice a week is also strate
gic in terms of forming a
stronger community amongst
workers themselves."
According to Wells, many of
the students involved in the tu

toring program have formed
close relationships with the
workers involved. In fostering a
sense of community, some of the
male students have played soccer
in San Jose with the employees
they help teach.
"There are a couple of [work
ers] who call just to talk and
check up on me, to see how I'm
doing in my studies or how my
family is, or to discuss something
they're reading about or have
written," Wells said.
Currently Wells is working
with a janitor to help him publish
several of his essays and poems.
She said that she gains inspiration
from her work with these employ
ees. She also stressed that stu
dents and workers can be a valu
able resource for one another and

that they have more in common
than they might think.
"We all come from somewhere
else and are only here temporari
ly," Wells said. "That adjustment
can be really difficult, and
whether you're a student or a
worker, it's helpful to have some
one looking out for you and sup
porting you, whether morally or
logistically."
Said Omar Amador, a janitor
who works on campus, "I think
the tutoring is very necessary, be
cause it gives us a kind of educa
tion. I think it is important to at
tend their classes, and it has really
helped a lot."
Wells also said she movement
to overcome the language barrier
fuels the progress made toward
fair-labor policies.

"Student-staff interaction is
absolutely essential to the cam
pus labor movement," she said.
"As students, we can exert pres
sure in ways that the workers
cannot, but the ultimate goal is to
reach the point where we won't
have to do that, where the work
ers themselves have an estab
lished voice in the University ad
ministration.
"Until we get there, we have to
be in close contact and work to
gether intensively," she added.
Said freshman Michelle Er
drich, "[Workers] are our link to
the world that exists beyond the
Stanford bubble. They remind
us that though we are a specific
community, we are all still part of
a larger one that has effects on all
of us."
Workers and students cross each
other's paths every day in dining halls,
dorms and all over campus. Closely
linked in the university setting, it is hard
for either group to remain invisible to
the other. From brief conversation to
meaningful exchange, students and
workers have formed solid opinions of
one another and, in most cases, have
profited from this experience.
