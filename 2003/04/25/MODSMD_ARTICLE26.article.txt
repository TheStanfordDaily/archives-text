# Administrator explains guidelines

### CHRIS CHRISTOFFERSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Since the start of the academic
year, we have sought input from
students, faculty and others in de
veloping living-wage and benefit
guidelines for service workers at
Stanford. This week, we finalized
those guidelines, making Stanford
one of a handful of institutions of
higher learning in the country that
have implemented a living-wage
program.
In reaching our decision, we
consulted with the faculty and stu
dent senates, participated in stu
dent forums and heard from indi
viduals one-on-one. Overall, there
was little dissent over the benefits of
a living wage. Some expressed con
cern, however, over how far those
benefits should go.
Our initial wage is set at a mini
mum of $10.10 per hour if health
benefits are provided to workers
and $11.35 per hour if no health
benefits are offered (the amounts
were established after a review of
similar programs in the Bay Area).
The guidelines apply to contrac
tors whose non-union employees
provide basic services to Stanford
in areas that include maintenance,
grounds keeping, housing and
food services. The wage levels will
be reviewed on an annual basis and
adjusted as appropriate.
The guidelines apply specifically
to non-union workers, in part, be
cause these workers don't have offi
cial representation that is provided
by the collective-bargaining
process. While the guidelines still
leave some issues for employees
and employers to work out, the
policy is important because it pro
vides an economic safety net for
those who are most in need.
In addition, the guidelines
honor t he rights of employees to
organize — or not organize — ac
cording to their wishes. They also:
• Require contractors to give at

least 10 compensated days off an
nually to workers;
• Mandate contractors to pro
vide employees with a safe working
environment that is free of unlaw
ful discrimination and harassment;
• Ensure that employees are eli
gible to participate in English as a
Second Language (ESL) classes of
fered to employees at Stanford;
and
• Encourage job protection.
It is important to note, however,
that what is outlined here repre
sents only minimums and is not in
tended to prevent contractors from
providing wages, benefits and paid
time off in excess of what is spelled
out in the guidelines. Further
more, senior University staff will re
view the guidelines annually after
receiving input from contractors
and other interested members of
the University community.
Regarding implementation, the
guidelines will immediately apply
to all requests for proposals that are
sent out by the University. For ex
isting contracts, they will apply
when contracts are renewed, after
they expire or if contract exten
sions are requested. All contracts
entered into by Stanford will con
tain a clause stating that the con
tractor has been given a copy of the
guidelines and is in compliance
with them. All contractors must
agree to provide evidence of com
pliance, as requested by Stanford;
failure to comply will be considered
a material breach of the contract.
While the proposed guidelines
were generally applauded, some
have asked Stanford to go further
and implement a wide-ranging
code of conduct. While we respect
the views of those who proposed
this alternative, we have not adopt
ed a code of conduct for several
reasons.
First, we do not believe Stan
ford should mandate a broad
range of employment policies to
its contractors. We do believe,

however, in establishing guide
lines that positively impact the
quality of workers' lives. What we
are proposing accomplishes this
by strongly encouraging contrac
tors to offer wages and benefits
that provide an economic safety
net. If this is not done, we can de
cide not to hire the contractor —
or to fire them if they fail to com
ply with our wage and benefit
minimums.
Second, some benefits provided
in a code of conduct proposed to
the University go beyond the
bounds of reasonableness. It in
cluded, for example: free parking
for all workers and a $10 per day
premium for workers who live 60
or more miles from Stanford.
These and other benefits in the
proposed code of conduct are not
currently available to any workers
at the University.
Third, there are significant cost
issues. The University estimates it
would spend millions of dollars to
implement the range of benefits
contained in the proposed code of
conduct for all workers at Stanford.
This expense would be difficult
for the University during good eco
nomic times; it is virtually impossi
ble when we are experiencing an
annual budget deficit, cutting costs
at every level and implementing a
University-wide wage and hiring
freeze. Even if it could be accom
plished, implementing a code of
conduct would require difficult
tradeoffs, producing probable cuts
in student aid and increases in tu
ition, among other things.
In issuing living-wage and bene
fit guidelines, we wish to thank
everyone who has been involved in
the process. We believe they are in
the best interests of the University,
as well as those who work, study
and teach at Stanford.
