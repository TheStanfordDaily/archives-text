## University maintains that cottage clearance is needed for SARS preparation

With the Murray and Yost cottages still
unused since they were vacated on April
9, the University's decision to move stu
dents out of the residences as a precau
tion for quarantining students with pre-
SARS symptoms has drawn much criti
cism from students.
Sophomore Karan Mahajan, one the
nine relocated students, expressed his
frustration with the University's actions.
"This is a violation of student rights,

and no apology has been forthcoming
from the administration," Mahajan said.
"I totally support the University's timely
action to contain SARS, but I do not agree
with the means that were used. The Uni

Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Stu
dent Health Service, stated that while
there have been no cases of SARS — for

ranted since there have been more cases
per capita in Santa Clara County than in
any other U.S. county.
"We have been monitoring the SARS
situation and . . . working closely with
the Santa Clara County Public Health
Department, which judges the degree of
risk locally," Friedman said. "Although

there is clearly no public health emer
gency on campus, other campus officials
and I have concurred with the Public
Health Department that it is important
to be prepared."
According to Medicine Prof. Stan
Deresinski, it is unlikely that Stanford will
use the cottages to quarantine either stu
dents or visitors.
"My guess is they're not going to need
it," Deresinski told the Palo Alto Weekly.
"Right now, if you're living in the United
States and you haven't traveled and
haven't come in contact with someone
who has it, your chances of getting it ap
proach zero."
In response to the SARS threat that
emerged over spring break, the Universi-
