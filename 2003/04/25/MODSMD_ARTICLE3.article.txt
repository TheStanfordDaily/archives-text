# Students question cottage evictions
## University maintains that cottage clearance is needed for SARS preparation 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Murray and Yost cottages still
unused since they were vacated on April
9, the University's decision to move stu
dents out of the residences as a precau
tion for quarantining students with pre-
SARS symptoms has drawn much criti
cism from students.
Sophomore Karan Mahajan, one the
nine relocated students, expressed his
frustration with the University's actions.
"This is a violation of student rights,

and no apology has been forthcoming
from the administration," Mahajan said.
"I totally support the University's timely
action to contain SARS, but I do not agree
with the means that were used. The Uni
versity has a responsibility to its students."
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Stu
dent Health Service, stated that while
there have been no cases of SARS — for
mally known as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome — in the Stanford communi
ty, the creation of isolation units was war
ranted since there have been more cases
per capita in Santa Clara County than in
any other U.S. county.
"We have been monitoring the SARS
situation and . . . working closely with
the Santa Clara County Public Health
Department, which judges the degree of
risk locally," Friedman said. "Although

there is clearly no public health emer
gency on campus, other campus officials
and I have concurred with the Public
Health Department that it is important
to be prepared."
According to Medicine Prof. Stan
Deresinski, it is unlikely that Stanford will
use the cottages to quarantine either stu
dents or visitors.
"My guess is they're not going to need
it," Deresinski told the Palo Alto Weekly.
"Right now, if you're living in the United
States and you haven't traveled and
haven't come in contact with someone
who has it, your chances of getting it ap
proach zero."
In response to the SARS threat that
emerged over spring break, the Universi-
ty decided in early April to set up
isolation units in the Governor's
Corner cottages. The decision was
made by a group of administrators
representing Housing, Residen
tial Education, the Dean of Stu
dents Office, Student Affairs and
Vaden.
Housing Assignment Services
told the nine undergraduates liv
ing in the cottages that they were
to permanently vacate the cottages
as soon as possible.
Sophomore Collin Melton, an
other student forced to move,
questioned the University's ac
tions.
"I feel that it is prudent of the
University to have an area to quar
antine students with infectious dis
eases," Melton said. "However, I
am not convinced the cottage com
plex is the ideal location for such a
quarantine area. Perhaps a more
isolated off-campus location could
have been found."
Friedman explained the reason
for choosing the cottages.
l '[lt was intended] to make the
lakeside cottages available for their
original purpose, which is for stu
dents and others with short term
on-campus housing needs, includ
ing isolation for infectious dis
eases, including potentially
SARS," he said. "The cottages are
the most appropriate setting for
that purpose. We need to be pre
pared to encounter students and
others with symptoms consistent
with SARS."
Mahajan disagreed with the

University's claim that the cot
tages are suitable for quarantine
purposes, suggesting the use of a
hospital or isolated motor-homes
instead.
"Ideally, the University should
have considered other options,"
Mahajan said. "Isolating students
[and / or] personnel in the middle
of campus when they can't attend
class begs the question, why not
just take them oft campus?"
Many students who were not af
fected by the decision also ex
pressed criticism.
" The fact that they had to move
[students] out for this indicates
that there was no other plan in
place, should some other infec
tious disease strike the student
populace," said sophomore Jason
Dent. "If quarantine is so critical,
there should have been facilities
left empty from the beginning of
the school year."
Todd Benson, director of hous
ing assignment services, said that
the cottages will not be used for
permanent undergraduate hous
ing
"With Branner re-opening for
2003-04, we do not expect that
there will be any shortage of space
to house undergraduates next
year."
Without an explicit reason for
why the administration chose the
Murray cottages over other possi
ble quarantine spaces, the dis
placed students speculated about
the motivation behind the deci
sion.
"Perhaps clearing the cottage
complex was the most cost-effec
tive way for the University to ob
tain a quarantine area" Melton
said.
