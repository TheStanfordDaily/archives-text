## Turkey 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is part of a series of interviews with
international students at Stanford meant to heighten aware
ness of issues of social and political importance aroutul the
world.
Onur Fidaner of .Ankara, Turkey is a sec
ond-year graduate student in electrical
engineering at Stanford and the president
of the Turkish Students Association. The
seat of numerous empires since ancient times,
Turkey is now a predominantly Muslim country with
a historically secular government seeking admission
to the European Union. While violent conflict be
tween the Turkish government and ethnic minority
separatist groups has occasionally flared and some
international groups have criticized the Turkish gov
ernment for human rights abuses, others have ar
gued that the country has played a stabilizing role in
the region.
The Daily: What would you like to share about you;
experiences growing up in Turkey?
Onur Fidaner: I think the most important thing in
Turkey is the economy there. There has been a re
cent economic crisis in which the value of the .Ameri
can dollar against the local currency has jumped up,
so we had two [crises] actually in the 19905, and so thd
salaries couldn't keep up with the dollar. It's been a
problem. People are less happy, I think that's the ex
pected result. It hasn't really been going better, so
they're losing hope for the future of the economy.
TD: What are the societal and political effects of this?
OF: First of all, I think the new government has some
Islamic roots. They got 35 percent of the votes, but
this translated into them having almost two-thirds of
the seats in Parliament because of the system of par
ties having less than 10 percent of the votes not being
represented in Parliament; this year, only two parties
are represented and many non-Islamic parties did
not receive 10 percent of the vote.
I think the real reason behind [the Islamic par
ties'] success is because the other parties are not of
fering good solutions for those kind of problems.
The reason behind the current crisis is that we have
to use 80 percent of our gross national product to pay
for the interest and previous debts and perhaps fi
nance new debts. Our population is a young popula
tion, so each year there's a million young people
knocking on the door of the government for job of
ferings, so unemployment is very high. Of course,
having a job is very important for happiness, right?
TD: So there's a million unemployed young people,
how does this affect society?
OF: First of all, they're looking for jobs. I think the so
cial structure is kind of different in Turkey because
the social ties are much stronger, so if you have a job
you're not necessarily starving, so you can stay with
your family. So, they're just not doing anything, ac
tually— but they're the potential of the country.

What could be a solution? 1 think global capital, glob
al investment is necessary in Turkey, so there are, for
instance, many state-owned companies that could be
privatized, so this should be done.
TD: What are some major issues right now in Turkey
besides the economy?
OF: If you asked that five years ago, it would have
been terrorist attacks or terrorist organizations in the
southeast of Turkey, but that ended in 1998. Terror
ist attacks were one of the major reasons for the eco
nomic downturn in Turkey, especially in the eastern
and southeastern part of Turkey. The terrorists, the
PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party] — which were
Marxist and communist-based — lasted for 15 years,
and a grand total of 30,000 died. You would see on
TV every night, actually, babies shot and it was terri
ble. In big cities like Istanbul and Ankara, those at-

I neks were not really very deeply felt, but especially in
the] southeastern region, the terrorists were orga
nized in terms of guerrilla fighters, so the military,
when they were first in use, actually had to learn
those tactics.
And more importantly, I believe that there is clear
evidence that terrorists with that organization were
sheltered and supported by some European coun
tries and were also in charge of arms dealing [to
them]. Germany, France and I believe Italy actually
harbored the leader of that terrorist group fora
month or two. He was arrested in 1999. His name is
Abdullah Ocalan and a lot of people wanted to exe
cute him for treason. In the process, [Turkey] was
joining the European Union [which outlaws the
death penalty], so [the sentence] was changed to life
in prison.
TD: What are the opinions on the Turkish side and
the Europe side about this?
OG: I want to consider Kurds and terrorism sepa
rately, because that's what it is. The Kurds, al
though they live intensely in the southeastern
area — by the way, the PKK was killing not only
Turks but Kurds. It was a terrorist organization, ob
viously. Also, there are many, many millions of
Kurds in big cities like Istanbul, and almost all of
them are very well-integrated into society, so they
are singers, they are politicians, and even two pres
idents of Turkey say they have Kurdish blood in
them. This is actually not a social problem, because
as I said, you are seeing those babies killed for 15
years, and people had Kurdish neighbors, so they
did not associate it with their neighbors. Kurdish
people have multiple languages and a culture, so

some writers here actually, Noam Chomsky — he
claims that in the '90s the U.S. helped Turkey with
arms, and Turkey used that to oppress the Kurdish
minority. He even used the very unfortunate word
"ethnic cleansing," which is not accurate. So it was a
war against terrorism. During those wars, of course,
some of those cultural rights — books and newspa
pers in Kurdish were not really allowed during that
period. But now, after the elimination of terror,
some democracy is allowed.
TD: Turkey has classically been at the crossroads be
tween the Europe, the Middle East and the rest of a
lot of the world. Right now, Turkey is applying to be
a member of the E.U., but it is also dealing with a lot
of issues with its neighbors, especially Iraq. Would
you talk about how you see Turkey's role in relation
lo Europe and in relation to the Middle East.

OF: Now Turks do not fit the prototype of a Euro
pean, so when you sav 'Turk' to somebody, you
wouldn't think of a European, but you wouldn't
think of an Arab as well. It is actually a crossroads,
and we're a culture and nation of our own. However,
the European Union is where they have modern
roads going, and [Turkey is] trying to be part of the
European Union. But there are some hindrances for
that, that Turkey has to improve the commerce.
But I think that there is a fundamental problem
that they have to show themselves first, that they're
not really mentally ready to accept a country having
a majority Muslim population. They perceive Turks
as the 'enemy in the East,' an unbelievable mentality
of the age of the Crusades. There are some social is
sues [in Turkey], but [Europeans] have to change
that [mentality] first. They have double standards.
For instance, there are other countries applying to be
members of the E.U., Romania and some old Soviet
countries, and the same issues aren't brought to
them.
TD: From your perspective, is that the general view
among Turks?
OF: For Turks, actually the polls show that 70 per
cent want that membership. From my perspective is
that although I want it very much, I'm not sure that
Europe wants Turkey, really, or is sincere in wanting
Turkey. And their support of that terrorist organiza
tion is evidence of that.
TD: What about the Middle East? Could you go into
Turkey's relationships with its neighbors to the south
and specifically some of the issues surrounding the
U.S.-led war on Iraq?

OF: Turkey is — I don't want to say unlucky, but
I wish we had neighbors like Switzerland, Swe
den, Germany, those sorts of developed coun
tries. In the south part of Turkey, we share a bor
der with Syria, Iraq and Iran. Syria, when Hafez
al-Assad used to reign, they sheltered terrorists.
So the ringleader used to live there. They have ex
tensive camps there. They refused to stop . . . but
now that the son is in power and after the terror
ist attacks ended, Syria is no longer a threat to
Turkey.
For Iraq, in the northern part oflraq, there are
also many Kurds living. All of Syria, and almost all of
the Arabian land used to be Ottoman land until the
19205, so there are Turks — they're called Turke
mans —in Iraq. They comprise almost 15 percent of
the population. The Kurds and (he Turkemans suf
fered, but since the first Gulf War, the central gov
ernment lost control of northern Iraq. It was a per
fect location for terrorist activities. Also, we had to
shelter some 500,000 Iraqi refugees after the war. It
was a concern for us [again]: we would like to help
l|hose people, but we're going to do it from the other
side of the border.
TD: Could we talk some more about U.S.-Turkish
relations, specifically what's gone on in the past cou
ple of months with the U.S. attempting to use Turkey
fora northern invasion oflraq?
OF: The U.S.-Turkey relationship has quite a histo
ry. And it starts, I think, just after World War 11.
When the Cold War started, Turkey had a very
strategic location with the frontier of NATO, so the
U.S. built military bases in Turkey. They even
placed some nuclear arsenals in Turkey, just in case.
But I suppose had there been any misunderstand
ing, the Turkish people would have been the first to
be adversely affected. And Turkey fought with the
U.S. in the Korean War, and in terms of casualties I
think they had even more than the U.S. Then we al
ways supported U.S. actions all over the world — in
Somalia, the Balkans. In the first Gulf War, [the
U.S.] actually supported Turkey's struggle against
terrorists.
Partly in the latest war, the polls show that 95
percent of the Turkish population was against that
war. This means that the average man on the street
is not really convinced of the reasoning of the coali
tion forces. However, when a war becomes in
evitable, you have to act in a way to make your mus
cles as . . . so the U.S. wanted to use the Turkish
bases and the Turkish soil. So Turkey negotiated
some possible expected losses with the U.S. gov
ernment, but during that process, actually, de
meaning cartoons appeared in U.S. newspapers.
We were depicted as . . . some of them were really
not nice. The government was actually supportive
of that idea of letting the U.S. in, but Parliament
decided not to, basically. It's a long-term relation
ship, as I said. We've been allied for more than 50
years. The European Union, the countries don't
like the idea that Turkey is so much connected with
the United States.
