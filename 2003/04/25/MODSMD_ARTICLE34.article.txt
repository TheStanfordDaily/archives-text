"Getting funded is like diaper changing," said
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare to an auditorium of
200 people this past Tuesday. "The job is never fin
ished until all of the paperwork is done."
Zare is one of the speakers in "Research Univer
sities: Stanford, A Case Study," a lecture series that
aims to provide insight into how modern research
universities actually work. The series was coordinat
ed by Vice Provost and Dean of Research and Grad
uate Policy Charles Kruger and Patricia Jones, pro
fessor of biological sciences and vice provost for fac
ulty development. The series is targeted to young
faculty, but is open to all members of the University,
including graduate students and post-docs.
Topics in the 10-lecture series include university
governance, budgets, finance and indirect costs;
appointment and promotions; research policies;
ethical issues in the publication process; current
trends in multidisciplinary scholarship; and Stan
ford and society.
Kruger explained why he had helped start the
series.
"Our goal was to provide information on how
the University is run,"he said. "People are curious
about lots of things — what happens in the
Provost's Office, who makes the decisions, where
the money comes from. We encourage speakers to
provide both factual information as well as a subjec
tive spin on the matter."
He stressed that the talks are intended fora wide
range of people.
"The topics covered are broad enough to be of
interest to sophomores and emeritus faculty alike."
The fourth of the speakers in the lecture series,
Zare cracked up the audience this week with a to
the-point talk on grantsmanship and research
funding.
Zare compared grant seeking to a contact sport.
"A personal visit is ideal, but a phone conversa
tion is acceptable," he said.
He outlined the traits of a successful proposal,
listing novelty, demonstration of feasibility and the
"beauty contest" element.
"No one wants to read something densely typed
with small font that's as thick as it can be," Zare said.
"Tell it with cartoons and pictures if you can."
He added, "It's not just a question of cosmetics."
Zare stressed that funding doesn't "come out of
thin air."
"If you want to win the Lotto, you've got to buy
tickets. If you want to get funded, you've got to

write proposals."
His talk attracted an eclectic group of people.
Audience members included undergraduates and
senior citizens, students and experienced entrepre
neurs.
Seungbae Park, a visiting scholar from South
Korea, has attended every lecture in the series ex
cept for one. He has found the series very worth
while.
"The first lecture was about the history of Stan
ford and Silicon Valley. Another lecture focused on
promotion. 1 was interested to learn how professors
are promoted in this country and compare your
system to the way things work in South Korea."
Kruger is pleased with the way the series is turn
ing out.
"I think it's gone really well," he said. "I know
I've learned something from each of the speakers.
There's been an amazingly positive response."
The next talk will be held Tuesday at 4:15 p.m.
in Building 420, room 40.
