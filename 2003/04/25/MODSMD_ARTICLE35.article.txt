# Costs do not stop SoCo enrollment
## University plans to offer two new courses this fall and will continue charging enrollees 
### NEMIL DALAL STAFF WRITER 
Entering its ninth year, Sophomore College this fall
will retain changes implemented during last year's pro
gram. Although SoCo began charging students last
year, the program experienced no decline in enroll
ment. SoCo is also introducing two new classes —
"Creen Buildings" and another that takes students to
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
Established in 1995, the two-week class allows rising
sophomores to return before the start of autumn quar
ter and participate in small seminars. A total of 20 class
es will be offered this fall, each enrolling 12 to 14 stu
dents. Topics range from "Resistance Writing in Nazi
Germany" to "Mathematics of the Information Age."
While SoCo was free in the past, last year marked
the first time that students were asked to pay $400 to
help defray the cost of board. However, Director of
Freshman and Sophomore Programs Sharon Palmer
noted this change did not affect the number of pro
gram participants.
"Every class was fully enrolled last year, and I expect
the same to be true in the future," Palmer said. "Fi
nancial aid is available so that no student should be de
terred from applying because of the fee."
last year also marked the introduction of graduate
students as student advisers in the program. In previ
ous years, two undergraduate student assistants

helped run the classes. The change in policy allows
graduate student assistants to be paired with under
graduates.
"We still feel it's important to have at least one un
dergraduate involved as an SA, but the graduate stu
dents can provide additional knowledge and support
to the faculty because of their more extensive training
in a field and in teaching," Palmer said. "They can also
serve as mentors to the students in terms of what hap
pens after college, in graduate study, for instance."
Overall, many students explained that they are at
tracted to SoCo because it allows them to explore in
terests they might not otherwise pursue during the
regular school year. They also reported that the small
class sizes allow students to become more intimate with
faculty.
"It's a great chance to really get to know professors,"
said junior Varun Saxena, who ended up researching
in his SoCo professor's laboratory.
"It's also just so much more interesting than a tradi
tional class," she continued. "We used to go over to my
professor's house and have our discussions on his back
lawn."
Drama Prof. Harry Elam, who has taught "Social
Protest Drama" for several years, said that he likes the
greater intensity of classes during SoCo.
"Since students are only taking one course during
SoCo, their focus is only on that course," Elam said.
"This prompts them to really hone in on the materials.
Consequently, we have really spirited in-depth discus
sions of the subject matter.
"SoCo continues to be one of my favorite teaching
experiences at Stanford," Elam added. "It is [an] in
tense, creative, fun and intellectually challenging two
and-one-half weeks."
