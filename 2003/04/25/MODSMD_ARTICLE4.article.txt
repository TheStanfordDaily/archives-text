### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Yesterday evening, the Asian Ameri
can Theater Project opened "12-1-A,"a
play set in a Japanese internment camp in
Arizona. The production, AATP's first in
two years, will run through Sunday in the
Asian-American Activities Center Ball
room at the Old Union Clubhouse.
AATP was founded in 1978 by Stan
ford graduates Nancy Takahasi and
David Henry Hwang — known for the
Tony Award winning "M. Butterfly" —
to bring Asian-American stories and per
spectives to the stage at Stanford. The
group aims at joining the theater and
Asian-American communities.
"I think they started the group in
order to say, 'Hey, we're here. Asian
Americans do exist, and we're interested
in theater too,' " said junior Helen
Cheng, one of the play's producers.
Senior Michael Chang, the play's exec
utive producer, became involved in
AATP during his freshman year.
"I heard about the group through a
few of my upperclassmen friends who
had participated in previous produc
tions, and I was interested in the group
for the way it intertwined racial and eth
nic issues with art," he said.
"12-1-A" follows members of the
Tanaka family as they are uprooted from

their home and sent to an internment
camp during World War 11. The play
wright, Wakako Yamauchi, was in her
teens when she and her family were as
signed to the same camp featured in the
production.
"The play is about her observations
and memories of the internment experi
ence," explained director Khai Thu
Nguyen, who earned her bachelor's
from Stanford in 2001 and her master's

in 2002. "She identifies most with the
young teenager in the play, Koko, since
she was a teenager herself when she was
interned."
Nguyen believes the play deals with
themes that are highly relevant to today's
American society.
"It shows the struggles and challenges
Japanese Americans faced in internment

and the ways in which all Ameri
cans had to reconstruct what it
means to be a citizen and resident
of the country," Nguyen said. "It
has great relevance to political is
sues today. It is about human ex
perience and the human commu
nity as a whole."
Rather than having official
members, AATP has an executive
board that finds scripts for their
live performances.
"Once we make the decision to

produce a play, we hold auditions
and choose a cast and then put on
a show in the spring," Cheng said.
"[The actors] auditioned for 112" 12-
1 -A"] for various reasons like per
sonal interest or hearing about the
production from a friend or flier."
The group has had difficulty
raising general interest but is trying
to increase its visibility on campus.
"Our ultimate goal is to get
more people interested in Asian-
American theater, and by that I
mean performing art that touches
on universal issues told from an
Asian-American viewpoint,"
Cheng said. "Eventually, we'd like
to put on two shows a year, invite

playwrights and actors to speak to
the Stanford community and any
thing else we can think of."
The producers are excited
about the venue for the spring
production.
"Having the play in the A3C
Ballroom also provides a very inti
mate setting — you're up close to
the actors, you can really see
what's going on," Cheng said.
She stressed that the group en
courages people of all back
grounds to get involved in AATP.
"We're very open to new ideas,
and we welcome anyone who
would like to get involved," she
said. "You don't have to be Asian."
