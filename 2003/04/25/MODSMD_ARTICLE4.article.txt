### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Yesterday evening, the Asian Ameri
can Theater Project opened "12-1-A,"a
play set in a Japanese internment camp in
Arizona. The production, AATP's first in
two years, will run through Sunday in the
Asian-American Activities Center Ball
room at the Old Union Clubhouse.
AATP was founded in 1978 by Stan
ford graduates Nancy Takahasi and
David Henry Hwang — known for the
Tony Award winning "M. Butterfly" —
to bring Asian-American stories and per
spectives to the stage at Stanford. The
group aims at joining the theater and
Asian-American communities.
"I think they started the group in
order to say, 'Hey, we're here. Asian
Americans do exist, and we're interested
in theater too,' " said junior Helen
Cheng, one of the play's producers.
Senior Michael Chang, the play's exec
utive producer, became involved in
AATP during his freshman year.
"I heard about the group through a
few of my upperclassmen friends who
had participated in previous produc
tions, and I was interested in the group
for the way it intertwined racial and eth
nic issues with art," he said.
"12-1-A" follows members of the
Tanaka family as they are uprooted from

their home and sent to an internment
camp during World War 11. The play
wright, Wakako Yamauchi, was in her
teens when she and her family were as
signed to the same camp featured in the
production.
"The play is about her observations
and memories of the internment experi
ence," explained director Khai Thu
Nguyen, who earned her bachelor's
from Stanford in 2001 and her master's

in 2002. "She identifies most with the
young teenager in the play, Koko, since
she was a teenager herself when she was
interned."
Nguyen believes the play deals with
themes that are highly relevant to today's
American society.
"It shows the struggles and challenges
Japanese Americans faced in internment
