# Presley's first album actually pleases
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
I lie first thought that struck me as I listened to "To Whom It May
Concern," the long-anticipated debut album from Lisa Marie Presley,
was "damn — she actually has something to say."
Perhaps this should not be surprising; Elvis's only daughter has
been in the media spotlight from the day she was born, she was the one
who discovered his body on the day he died (she was only 9 years old),
she has endured brief and crazy marriages to Michael Jackson and
Nicolas Cage and has experienced a million other, things to ensure a
completely abnormal life.
You'd hope she'd have something to talk about. But the genius of a
parent doesn't always trickle down to a child, and Lisa Marie, knowing
the incredible standards she'd be held to, has resisted releasing any
music of her own. Until now.
"To Whom It May Concern" is actually good. It's the kind of record
that, while decent in itself, does an even better job of showing future po
tential. If Presley continues to mature as a songwriter, she could be
come a viable musical force independent of her family tree. Producer
Eric Rosse has crafted a sound for Presley best described as Alanis Mor
rissette with a few rough edges smoothed out — solid rock-pop that
seems contemporary or that could have fit in the mainstream eight or
nine years ago.
By now, many of us have seen or heard "Lights Out," the angst-filled
first single from the album, wherein Presley grapples with issues of her
lineage and her father's death — "Someone turned the lights out in
Memphis / That's where my family's buried and gone / Last time I was
there I noticed a space left / Next to them there in Memphis, in the
damn back lawn."
While the song is one of the more enjoyable tracks for repeated lis
tenings, releasing it as the first single seemed cheap to me — it smells
of record label promotion politics. "5.0.8.," the first cut on the

album, packs a

opening punch. |

bass mid-tempo rock rhythm, Lisa Marie's low
alto introduces itself like thick butter with the
line "You say I seem so grim, darling do you for
give me /1 went out on a limb, 'cause I needed to
be / Near the fireflies Hying high above me /
Then I hit the sky and it fell down on me."
Cheerful, right?
And perhaps here is where the largest weak
ness of "To Whom It May Concern" lies. Just like
Alanis with "Jagged Little Pill," Presley takes her
self so seriously that at times the production and
arrangements border on pretentious. Her lyrics
are good, but not quite consistent enough that
they always warrant the weighted and self-impor
tant production presented. But this is more the

fault of producer Rosse — for example, it's touch
ing that Presley includes a love song to her children ("So Lovely"), but
Rosse drenches it with enough country-ballad guitar that it's hard to lis
ten to with a straight face.
That said, "To Whom It May Concern" still hits home. It provides
the first glimpse into a woman who has been famous since before she
was born, but who no one really knows anything about to this day. This
album is not extraordinary, but it's good — and the potential for some
thing special down the road is clearly there.
