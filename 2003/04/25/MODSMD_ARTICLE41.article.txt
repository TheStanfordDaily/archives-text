# Williams' latest reveals reflective, nostalgic side
## 
### ANDY MOON 
Several of my dormmates walked in as I blasted the
new Lucinda Williams CD from my speakers, and most
comments were along the lines of "What the hell are you
listening to?" or "Turn that noise off!"
"World Without Tears" is not an album of catchy, up
beat tunes. But it definitely has its moments, and the
album grew on me after repeated listenings. The softer
songs tell stories of heartbreak and nostalgia while the
more aggressive tunes are raw and, at times, downright
angry; Williams holds nothing back as she sings about
church hypocrisy and child abuse while referencing ac
tions as bold as vomiting and heroin use.
The album opens softly with the drawling,
wistful "Fruits of my Labor." The simple ac-

companiment — sparse drums and bass
with a reverb guitar and occasional har
monica solos — creates a vivid country at
mosphere. Lucinda, daughter of
renowned poet Miller Williams, shows off
her impressive way with words as she sings:
"Lavender, lotus blossoms too/Water in
the dirt, flowers last for you ... Lemon trees
don't make a sound / Til branches bend and
fruit falls to the ground."
However, the album single, "Righteous-

ly," falls flat. The same verse seems to repeat
endlessly with slightly different lyrics, and her
twangy and un-melodic style becomes irritat
ing: "When you run your hand / All up and
run it back down my leg / Get excited and bite
my neck / Get me all worked up like that."
Unfortunately, this repetitiveness is reflected
in several songs throughout the album, in
which monotonous verses and accompaniments

drag on for more than four minutes.
The aggressive track "Atonement" drives hard
with crunching guitars and growling vocals, but it's

musically uninteresting. I
Williams rushes '

lyrics in the verses, leaving

rus over and over: "Come

on, come on!" Both

es, have an annoying
quality to them. While
the lyrics are angry,
the delivery lacks emo
tional substance.
This is not to
say that "World With-

out Tears" doesn't have its shining moments. Williams
produces beautiful music in songs such as "Three Days,"
a testament to an old lover that still manages to convey all
of Williams' frustration and anger. With harmonies by
guitarist Doug Pettibone and bassist Taras Prodaniuk, the
piece has texture and substance while evoking the pain of
being deserted. There are more than a handful of songs
on "World Without Tears" that are superbly done, re
flecting a melancholy free of bitterness. "Overtime," a
song about healing after lost love, is simple but beautiful
while "Minneapolis" and "Words Fell" are both well-craft
ed pieces full of poetic symbolism. These outstanding
tracks help carry the album forward.
While there are a few tracks that I always skip, the CD
has several gems that will stay fresh fora long time.
Williams' blend of country, blues and rock produce a
unique sound unlike any recent artist. After hearing her
2001 effort, the glossy and melodic "Essence," this album
was not close to what I expected. Williams attempts a dar
ing, raw record in "World Without Tears." However,

it is mostly when she shows her reflective, nostalgic
side that she succeeds. Her expressions of lost love
and places she once knew allow her skill as a poet
and as a singer-songwriter to shine.


She's probably right: The world doesn't seem so sad
when you're gorging yourself on watermelons.
