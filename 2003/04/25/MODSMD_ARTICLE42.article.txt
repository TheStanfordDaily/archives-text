# Britney is beautiful as ever,
## but 'Stages' isn't staged enough 
### JENNIE KIM 
What

comes across in "Stages" is the
absolute void that is Britney Spears.
The girl just has nothing to say.

The door to my room gets a lot of taunting. It's covered
with Britney Spears. Other random images — a doll that
looks alarmingly like a blond baby Hitler dressed in com
munist China's military uniform, an airline safety card, an
Andy Warhol Vegas exhibition catalog — also litter the edges of the
door, but it's dominated by two large Britney posters. One of the
posters came with the purchase of "Stages," Britney's oversized
magazine-like book.
"Stages" covers the last three days of Britney's "Dream within a
Dream" tour and includes a 90-minute documentary DVD of the
events leading up to the final shows in Mexico City. Written with Sh-

eryl Berk (the co-authorship credit is
a bit disconcerting since, out of the
104 pages, less than a dozen are cov
ered with text), the book tries to re
veal the inner Britney — the Britney
behind the gloss.
To accomplish this goal, Brit
ney's little sister, mother, aunt and
best friend share stories, trying to
shed light on her personality. Her
best friend recalls Britney's visits to
her college campus: "She'll tell me,
'Oh, you're so lucky you go to college
— I wish I could!"'
Such trivial gems litter "Stages,"
which reads like an issue ofTiger Beat
Magazine: Britney Edition. Britney
ends the book with a hollow personal
statement, "I wanted to give people a
chance to see who I am as a whole."
The text reveals a whole bunch of co
authored nothing.
But honestly, who really spends

$29.95 to read Britney literature? Her hotness does not come across
in the writing! Some of the photos in "Stages" are gorgeous, artful
two-page Britney spreads. But too many are cheesy publicity shots;
photos of Britney superimposed over tacky computer-imaged neon
backgrounds. That photo is fine for the cover of a notebook, but it
looks terribly out of place next to a Herb Ritts still. Also, since the
book covers only three days, the new photos are of Britney in the
same old, not cute outfits. Seriously not cute. I really would have
liked to see more costume changes.

The DVD does a little better in achieving Britney's goal of show
ing her wholeness. There are some worthwhile candid mo-

ments: Britney being bitchy at a Mexican press con
ference, Britney vamping around her dressing

room pre-show, Britney crying tears ofjoyover
a gift her momma sent her. But the docu-

mentary could have been edited better. I
could care less about Britney's annoying
make-up artist's engagement or her pro
duction manager's stress attacks. All that is
filler — the fans want more fluff.
What comes across in "Stages" is the ab-

solute void that is Britney Spears. The girl just
has nothing to say. Even when she's bitchy, it's not in-

triguingly bitchy like Madonna or type-A bitchy like Barbra
Streisand. It's junior high Texas cheerleader bitchy. Britney maybe
extremely hard working, dedicated and hot beyond belief, but her
personality is blander than British food.
Yet I, and millions of others, still love her. I'm obsessed.
Ultimately, "Stages" reveals the true value of Britney: as an em
blem of the popular culture of our time. Image is everything, and
as hard as she may try to deny it, Britney Spears is just that —at
most she's an entertainer, but never a personality. Personality, sub
stance is null; she has reached iconic status; she has morphed into
the unspoken American feminine ideal — all without saying a
meaningful word.
Pop-art Warhol would love pop-tart Britney. He said famously,

"If you want to know all about
Andy Warhol, just look at the sur
face: of my paintings and films
and me, and there I am. There's
nothing behind it."
And that's what the people who
criticize my door just don't get.

Adoring Britney doesn't en
tail an equal admiration for
who she is as a person. No
one knows the inner Britney

or even cares. We all like to pre-

Stages
Britney Spears
with Sheryl Berk

tend we care; we ask her about her
virginity, track her dating history in US Week-

ly. We want to know about her feelings about Justin but not Iraq. In
stead, to love Britney is to embrace pop culture in all its brightly
packaged, consumable emptiness.
The book and DVD straddle the line between substance and ar
tifice, an awkward position that diminishes the value of both at
tempts. "Stages" should have ditched the soul-searching and stuck
to the stage. Why degrade the pop-purity of Britney by forcing her
to speak?


"Shhh . . . don't tell
anyone, but my book
is a waste of
money."

But honestly, who really spends

$29.95 to read Britney literature? Her hotness does not come across
in the writing! Some of the photos in "Stages" are gorgeous, artful
two-page Britney spreads. But too many are cheesy publicity shots;
photos of Britney superimposed over tacky computer-imaged neon
backgrounds. That photo is fine for the cover of a notebook, but it
looks terribly out of place next to a Herb Ritts still. Also, since the
book covers only three days, the new photos are of Britney in the
same old, not cute outfits. Seriously not cute. I really would have
liked to see more costume changes.

The DVD does a little better in achieving Britney's goal of show
ing her wholeness. There are some worthwhile candid mo-

ments: Britney being bitchy at a Mexican press con
ference, Britney vamping around her dressing

room pre-show, Britney crying tears ofjoyover
a gift her momma sent her. But the docu-

mentary could have been edited better. I
could care less about Britney's annoying
make-up artist's engagement or her pro
duction manager's stress attacks. All that is
filler — the fans want more fluff.
What comes across in "Stages" is the ab-

solute void that is Britney Spears. The girl just
has nothing to say. Even when she's bitchy, it's not in-

triguingly bitchy like Madonna or type-A bitchy like Barbra
Streisand. It's junior high Texas cheerleader bitchy. Britney maybe
extremely hard working, dedicated and hot beyond belief, but her
personality is blander than British food.
Yet I, and millions of others, still love her. I'm obsessed.
Ultimately, "Stages" reveals the true value of Britney: as an em
blem of the popular culture of our time. Image is everything, and
as hard as she may try to deny it, Britney Spears is just that —at
most she's an entertainer, but never a personality. Personality, sub
stance is null; she has reached iconic status; she has morphed into
the unspoken American feminine ideal — all without saying a
meaningful word.
Pop-art Warhol would love pop-tart Britney. He said famously,

"If you want to know all about
Andy Warhol, just look at the sur
face: of my paintings and films
and me, and there I am. There's
nothing behind it."
And that's what the people who
criticize my door just don't get.

Adoring Britney doesn't en
tail an equal admiration for
who she is as a person. No
one knows the inner Britney

or even cares. We all like to pre-

Stages
Britney Spears
with Sheryl Berk

tend we care; we ask her about her
virginity, track her dating history in US Week-

ly. We want to know about her feelings about Justin but not Iraq. In
stead, to love Britney is to embrace pop culture in all its brightly
packaged, consumable emptiness.
The book and DVD straddle the line between substance and ar
tifice, an awkward position that diminishes the value of both at
tempts. "Stages" should have ditched the soul-searching and stuck
to the stage. Why degrade the pop-purity of Britney by forcing her
to speak?


"Shhh . . . don't tell
anyone, but my book
is a waste of
money."



Britney has a good time discussing the blessed genes passed down by
momma Spears.needs one.
