# Intermission interviews the hottest woman in the world
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ ED SCOTT 
Deep in a Sri Lankan jungle, Angelina
Julie speaks into a high tech communication
device. Sound a little like "Tomb Raider"?
This time, at least, Jolie is not seeking trea
sure, but instead investigating ways to share
her wealth with poor- Sri Lankan villages.
She's talking with reporters on her cell
phone, doing publicity for her new movie
"Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life" and
speaking candidly about her nonexistent sex
life and her disappearing Oscar statue.
Hearing Angelina ask, "Can you hear me
now? Can you hear me now?" in response to
the intermittent Sri Lankan cellular service
was the first indication of the divide between
her hard-edged Hollywood roles and her
more approachable real-life persona. Jolie,
unlike many other actors, answers questions
simply and directly. She laughs a lot and
even seems a little insecure. She doesn't be
lieve half the stuff written about her in the
tabloids. That does, of course suggest that all
you guys can keep imagining the remaining
50 percent is true.
Intermission: The first "Tomb Raider" was
not well-received by the critics, but it was a
blockbuster. How do you feel about that sit
uation?
Angelina Jolie: I had my own feelings about
the film. I personally don't care about the crit
ics. I wanted the second one to be better so that
I could be happy with it. I'm just glad it did so
well! 1 wasn't concerned about the critics.
INT: Your dad made a cameo in the first
"Tomb Raider" movie, will he come back
from the dead in this one?
AJ: No, no. We're not very close (my father
and I).
INT: This summer, there are a half a dozen
major sequels. How does this movie separate
from the rest?
AJ: It's the only adventure film this summer
and it has a more global scope as a film. Jan
Deßont made it more of a fantasy film this
time. Watching all of the different countries
will be more interesting, too.
INT: Do you think the Tomb Raider movies
have the staying power like the Indiana
Jones series?
AJ: I would never want to be so confident
with it. I love the Indiana Jones films. I'm
not sure that... [pauses] I'm not the person
to ask! We'll see after this one.
INT: Have you played the real Tomb
Raider game?
AJ: Fora second, yes, but I have no patience
and the girl's accent annoyed me, so I ended
up killing her all the time.
INT: What do you think is behind the .An
gelina Jolie that captivates people?
AJ: I always need to share myself and I feel
connected to everyone. Most people think
they know me, and they actually do.
INT: Do you think "The Cradle of Life" is
sexier than the original?
AJ: Yes, I feel sexier, maybe because I'm sin
gle this time [laughs]. It's also less of a fanta
sy. She bleeds this time ...

INT: Do you see yourself as sex symbol?
AJ I m someone at this time who hasn't had
any sex [laughs]. So I don't feel it at the mo
ment.
INT: Is it stifling to your creativity for you to
revisit a character?
AJ: It was really good to do. In the first one
we were trying to create a person from a
game. This time we had a lot more to play
with.
INT: How close does your on-screen per
sona come close to the real one? Did Lara
Croft require more acting?
AJ : I love adventure and other countries. I
love to fight about something I care about. I
am also a good friend to people close to me.
[Lara Croft is] quite a lady in the British
sense. So, no, there's not much that's differ
ent.
INT: How can "Tomb Raider" be tied to
current world events? There are certain
weapons of mass destruction you're trying to
keep away in the film.
AJ: I wouldn't relate it too much to this
world. In a sense it's a simple story about
good vs. evil that's relevant today. Lara suc
ceeds because she UNDERSTANDS other
countries and does not CRASH into them.
INT: How did working with director Jan
Deßont compare with director Simon West.-'
AJ: When I came back to set, everyone was
the same except for the director. The whole
crew was the same, and they really make up
a film like this. But Jan did the story so dif
ferently; however, there was not a huge dif
ference in the way they both directed ME.
INT. I know you have a lot of tattoos. Why
so many?
AJ: I'm indecisive, (laughs) I have a new one
that I got in Thailand. It was done in the tra
dition way — with the monks and long nee

dies — which is a prayer protection for my
family. The tattoo is actually in the new
"Tomb Raider" because it's a tribal.
INT: How do you balance making a film
with being a mother?
AJ: It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but
it's also wonderful. It's a delicate balance, but
Maddox [Jolie's son] kinda makes every
thing worthwhile; he makes it easy.
INT: I heard you're donating $5,000 every
year to a wildlife refuge in Cambodia?
AJ: Yeah. Wow, how was that released? I
loved Cambodia and visited it again with the
U.N. and visited orphanages, and that's how
I got Maddox. We're building and paying
for an education center, rangers and protec
tion of animals and forests. There's lions and
tigers and a lot of animals that no one's sure
about there. It's for Cambodia and all the
people that live there.
INT: What do you do at home in your spare
time? Do you ever look back at how far you
come?
AJ : I ma very normal person, so being a bit
public was a little weird. I've come to a
place where I can feel good about my fi
nancial success and do a lot of good. I can
do other things and films. I'm just grateful
I'm able to work, spend a lot of time with Sri
Lankan people and doing fun baby things,
[laughs]
INT: What religion do you plan on raising
Maddox?
AJ: I will teach him about Buddhism. I've
read a lot of religions. I'm a believer that he
will find his own someday. I want him to
know the religion of the country he came
from. It's important for him to appreciate
his country's religion. So there will probably
be a lot of different religions in the house.
INT: What is your next project?
AJ: "Beyond Borders," which comes out in
November. It spans 12 years and it's an epic
story of life and love. It has a lot of really
good issues.

INT: With what's going on in the world
right now, what do you find is the difference
in Sri Lankan news as compared to the U.S.?
AJ: It's very interesting to me. I talk to my
mom at home, and she's getting the news the
same way that everyone else is getting it. You
need to search out the truth for itself. It's ob
viously a big thing, but it's frustrating for me
to see people in other countries flee the
Conga; and here in Sri Lanka, for the last
three decades, there's been war. There
needs to be attention in certain places. The
hot topic switches to whatever it may be
every day, and I know that a lot of other
places need to be helped too.
INT: How do you feel about the celebrity
world?
AJ: I am happy to tell stories to people as an
actor and have people respond. Knowing
that I get through to people makes me
happy. I love that about being in the public
eye. You read all of these lies, and it's your
self, and it's weird. I like it, and it's funny.
INT: How is the tattoo of Billy Bob going?
AJ: It's pretty close to gone. It's been lasered
at the dermatologist a couple times.
INT: How is it to work with actors like Den
zel Washington and Ed Burns? How is it to
be on the level of what people view as huge?
AJ: It's great and wonderful. They're as in
teresting to me as these people I talk to for
these college papers. You can connect to
them in different ways and they're there
for you off camera and give you a lot of
support.
INT: How has life changed after the Oscars?
AJ: It's one of those things you feel you should
accomplish as an actor... it takes some relief
after you've done it. I take it so seriously. To
be honest, I haven't seen it after the day I won
it. I think it's with my mom [laughs]. To hear
someone say they see me and can relate my
role to their life; that's much more important
to me than an Oscar. Like an 11-year-old
came up to me, and called me "Lara." That's
much better than an Oscar.


Underneath that filmy gown lies a heart of gold


Jolie won't score a second Oscar with the 'Tomb Raider" sequel, but that's OK. She really only
needs one.
