# 'Tomorrow' — watch it today

### RANDY MANO 
After receiving an overzealous e-mail for
"Better Luck Tomorrow," I quickly toned it
down before sending it on to several of my
friends. Essentially, the writer of the message
implied that this Asian-American film, without
the overdone stereotypes of school nerd and
kung-fu master, needed to be sold out for
weeks in order to send a powerful message to

Hollywood's elite that Asian Americans de
served more balanced roles in the movie

industry.
More accurately, all it comes\
down to is relative profitability and
talent-pool size. Paramount Pic
tures — specifically MTV Pictures
— picked up the film for distribu
tion at a cheap rate, which has
meant more money could be used to
advertise to teens on stations like
MTV. The investment has paid off

already: "BLT," while at far fewer venues,
scored better than a $27,000 per theater aver
age during its opening weekend, far outpacing
the No. 1 film, "Anger Management" (at rough
ly $11 ,000 per theater).
In terms of talent, "BLT" has enough to stay
afloat. It is very true that Asian Americans
never get the lead of a major film — probably
the most famous actor in this movie is biology
teacher Jerry Mathers, who was once Beaver
Cleaver. I also don't doubt that as a career, pro
fessional acting is not at the top of many Asian
American's job lists.
Still, director Justin Lin gets a decent per
formance out of his lead, Parry Shen, to make
enough of a connection with the audience.
What is important for Lin is to get anyone, re
gardless of race, to identify with the themes and
to become involved with the characters. As Ben
Manibag, a straight-A student with aspirations
for top colleges, Shen taps into the frustration
of living in a mundane suburban life and always
striving towards achieving and getting more.

He descends into darkness
with three friends: annoying Virgil
(Jason Tobin), stoic Han (Sung
Kang) and ringmaster Daric
(Roger Fan). They begin conduct
ing criminal activities — starting
with cheat sheets but eventually es
calating to bigger, pricier acts.
Ben also wants to date
Stephanie (Karin Anna Cheung),
a cutie who is currently involved
with preppy Steve (John Cho, the

"MILTF" dude in "American Pie"). It is Steve
who, surprisingly, creates the greatest plot
movement through his proposed crime.
Shot for only $250,000, "BLT" has the flavor
and impact of an In-N-Out burger. You know
it's not the same as a filet mignon at the Ritz, but
still you appreciate what you have, given cer
tain constraints. There are some good observa
tions made — including an excellent thread
about token Asian-American basketball players,
culminating with a hilarious mini demonstra
tion at a game by Asian students. The scenes are
shot primarily in Cypress and my hometown
Seal Beach, so I got a big kick out of the famil
iar Orange County scenery.
Mainly, though, "BLT" is a different sort of
high school film with edgy characters making
somewhat believable decisions. While not life
changing or bubbling over with witty dialogue,
"BLT" is still better than the majority of boring
mainstream fare, so support independent film
making, and check out this film in limited re
lease.
