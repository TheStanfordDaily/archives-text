# You can't pronounce their name, but Sigur Rós still amazes

I don't know exactly what's going on in Reykjavik
(pop. 101,000) these days, but I can't help guessing
that Iceland's geothermal, sulfurous gases have per
meated the pop music scene with hallucinogenic
fumes. April Bth's Sigur Ros concert at the Paramount
Theatre in Oakland made me question whether there
can be any further innovation in music beyond theirs
— save interceding for the eyes and ears by jacking
electrodes straight into the left, right, fore, aft and
starboard brain lobes, pushing awe straight across the
blood-brain barrier.
The conventional tropes of pop were dispensed with,
replaced by a gray, electro-tonal firmament from the
keyboards, embroidered with the blood purples of the
three-person string section. Sigur Ros drifted between
nocturnal communiques about the anomie of modern
life (or perhaps just about life in Reykjavik-pop. 101,000)
and primal displays that sent the message to bass manu
facturers worldwide: "We will play your guitars by
whacking them with violin bows, and we will not hear
your pleas to the contrary."
Sigur Ros defied simple genealogies — as one would
hope of a band that had the pretension to call their last
album by non-phonetic characters. I could rattle off a
number of probable influences from acts like Bjork, Ra
diohead, Pink Floyd and various other early-'9os
shoegazer bands to the effects of sub-arctic loneliness, but
I would be hard-pressed thus to depict more than a
bland synthesis of past idols. Their music was amor
phous, minimalist, chilly and ethereal. Their sets were
operatic with monolithic equipment that described intri

cate blocking patterns across the stage; the rhythmically
cued stage lights, envious of the instruments, danced
along the color spectrum and around the vaulted, cathe
dral-like venue. During the first of their two encores, the
projection screen behind the band showed two orange
coronas merging and dividing, as if the sound waves

were pressing thumbs

against my eyeballs.
The music's
drawback, but also J
its reward, is that it

Concert Review

overt emotional states

or unilaterally propagan
dize feelings the way pop music is wont to do. It does not
offer comfort. Instead, the music foists confusion on you.
Sitting in the concert hall, actively keying my ears to each
instrument in turn, I was fleetingly unsettled by the vo
cals. The lead singer's voice was strung out yet angelic,
male but androgynous. The lyrics, written in a nonsense
tongue called Hopelandish, sounded just Anglo enough
that, while the syllables fluttered through my mind, I
tried to lock onto, parse and catalog them in vain. My fu
tile composition of meaning reminded me of the painter
Gerhard Richter's declaration that "abstract art is inher
ently about the search — and about not finding any
thing."
And suddenly, as I was just coming to grips with
this sensory confusion, Sigur Ros had slipped off
stage, staging a dramatized version of a modest in
song exit. They had even managed to make the finale
bewildering, vanishing without a bow or goodbye
note. Walking out from the red-carpeted, gilded,
1920s tribute-to-capitalism Paramount, I savored the
night's rendition of the untitled fourth track from
their latest album. Remembering the flute, which
trickled over the three guitars, the two violins, the
cello, the two keyboards and the alpha male drums, I
felt nostalgic for the future.


Sigur Ros: spawn of the Coneheads?
