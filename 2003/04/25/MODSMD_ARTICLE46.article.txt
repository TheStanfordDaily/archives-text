# SF Symphony sparkles

### TIFFANY LEE 
Herbert Blomstedt made a stunning return to the San Francisco
Symphony on April 12, guest conducting a sampling of
Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and the entirety of
Bruckner's Symphony No. 4 in E-flat Major, Romantic. Blomstedt.

currently the music director of the
Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, j
is a conductor laureate of the SF j
Symphony where he conducted |
from 1985 to 1995 and is in constant j
demand as a guest conductor j
throughout the world.
In general, the symphony j
sounded wonderful, although '

there were times when cohesion was a slight problem and when I
craved a stronger string presence in response to the louder brass in
struments. But overall, it was a truly enjoyable way to spend an

evening. The concert hall is relatively small and intimate, en
suring that pretty much every seat is a good seat.
The performance of "A Midsummer Night's

Dream" painted important aspects of Shakespeare's play
itself using notes and lyrical melodies. Written when
Mendelssohn was in his late teens, each instrument plays
a particular role in the presentation of the story as a whole.
The violins, for example, with their quick airy notes, rep-

resented the playfulness of the fairy dances.
What accentuated the playfulness of the fairies was the setup
of the orchestral stage itself. Usually, the strings are placed in an
arc around the conductor starting with all the violins on the
viewer's left and moving onto violas, cellos and basses on the
viewer's right.
In this particular performance, however, the violins were di
vided into two parts, with the first violins on the viewer's left

and the second violins on the viewer's right. This created an
interesting sound as the music rolled off the stage to the

audience's ears. There were several parts of the piece
. where the first violins played a melody that the sec-

ond violins responded to in the next phrase. This
banter of notes became more apparent and ev-

ident because of the placement of the two vio
lin sections on either side of the audience, ac
centuating the feeling of fairies surrounding

them, calling from one side and then the
other.
The Bruckner was no less of an amazing

piece than the Mendelssohn. Unlike
Mendelssohn who was a precocious musi-

cian, much like Mozart, Bruckner did not com
pose his mature works until the age of 40.

Although the piece starts off quite slowly,
with quiet string tremolos backing a solo
horn, the music grows to a loud, rambunc-

tious piece full of life, vigor and power.
Bruckner described his first movement as,
"Medieval city — dawn — morning calls
sound from the towers — the gates open
— on proud steeds the knights ride into
the open — woodland magic embraces
them — forest murmurs — birds songs
— and thus the Romantic picture un-

112 folds." Each movement comes with a men
tal image attached; it's something that the
viewer clearly traces throughout the piece,

painting a picture with words much like the
Mendelssohn piece.

If you've never been to the San Francisco Sympho-

Ny, it is definitely worth a visit. Not only is the building a gorgeous
work of architecture, but the symphony itself is a five-time Gram
my-award winning one under its current resident conductor

Michael Tilson Thomas.
