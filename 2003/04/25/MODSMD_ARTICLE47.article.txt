# Roxy cares about you, you big pussy
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Most of us say that we don't care what anybody else
thinks. Well, most of us are big fat liars.
In high school, you might have convinced yourself
that you didn't care when you opted to build the per
fect balsa wood tower for Science Olympiad rather

than go to the house party down the block, but you
probably cared. You flocked to Math Squad or what
ever dorky extra-curricular activity not just to pad
your college apps but also to avoid certain irksome so

cial situations altogether.
At Stanford, the passive "I don't care" arguments are
really starting to tick Roxy off. Who are you, Groucho
Marx? Of course you care. And acting like you don't is ru
ining your love life.
Call it social laziness, anxiety or simple fear — it's what
prevents you from introducing yourself to the most beau
tiful person you've ever seen. It's what causes those awk-

ward mutual non-acknowl
edgements between recognized
non-acquaintances in the quad
everyday. It's what deters you
from asking out that guy or girl
in your section — the one you
know is single and is the reason
you even show up to optional
section anyway. Well, that per
son's presence and also to turn
in your problem set. but you do
stay the whole 50 minutes be
cause of him or her.
The point of this tongue-lash
ing is to awaken you into ac
tion. For the love of God, you
egotistical bastard, people are
not sitting around watching
your every move, waiting to
laugh if you fail to score a date
with the object of your affec
tion.
What's the worst thing that
could happen if you say some
thing flirtatious or extend an

invite to some crappy-ass dorm party?
They could refuse, yes, but they'll be flattered
nonetheless, and they'll know you're interested — some
thing that could help you down the road after his or her

long-distance relationship has fizzled. And what's so
wrong with rejection? You've gotten rejected before.
Princeton rejected you, but you got over it.
Encouragingly, here and now is the best time to be for
ward. The vast majority of students here are not going to
be as mean to you as the head cheerleader was in high
school. Also, there's less selection here than in the world
outside the bubble, so even if someone seems out of your
league, he or she just might settle for you if you aren't as
good-looking but are still cool. Best-case scenario: He or
she has noticed you too and was hoping you'd make a
move already. Music swells in the background as a lust
connection is made.
If you want to hook up with someone, stop being so
damned lazy. It's not like a hook-up will magically hap
pen if you don't put in any effort. Unless, of course, you
are either freakishly hot or a female.
Honesdy, guys love to bitch about Stanford women
and their unwillingness to hook up with them. Not all
girls are comfortable with random hook-ups. Some need
(gasp!) to get to know you or even your last name first.
You may even have to try to get to know her too. Invite
her to Flicks with you or to a dorm or house dinner. Noth
ing big, just something to show you're into her.
Roxy knows you all are real busy: Midterms are
around the corner; you're staring down the barrel of
your honors thesis; blah blah blah. Your schedule is not
going to relent, but neither is your need to get ass. Some
thing has got to give. Either you hide behind your books
and tell yourself you're too busy to go after that special
someone, or you swallow your pride and take a chance. If
you do the former you'll eventually morph into a celibate
academic, dien explode out of sexual frustration. To
Roxy, the choice is clear.
