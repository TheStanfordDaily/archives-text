# Shoot this monk on sight

### PHIL FLORES 
104 minutes. That is the running time of
"Bulletproof Monk," the latest special ef
fects-driven martial arts movie those genius
es in Hollywood have actually given money
to and expect the American public to do so
in return. Unfortunately, they are 104 min
utes I can't get back. Ever. Plain and simple,
this movie sucks. There is absolutely noth
ing that can remotely salvage this reviewer's
opinion of it. Not the been-there-done-that
fighting sequences. Not the overexposed
antics of Sean William Scott (Stifler from
"American Pie"). Not even the innumerable
talents of the ever-charismatic Chow Yun-
Fat ("Hard Boiled" and "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon") can redeem this woefully
uninspired film
Based on a cult comic book series ("cult"
means "never heard of before"), the movie
tells the story of a nameless monk (Yun-Fat)
and his quest to protect a mystical scroll that
grants its owner complete world domination.
Along the way, the monk meets up with some
Nazis, a dim-witted but lovable sidekick
(Scott) and the latest model-turned-actress
(Jamie King of "Pearl Harbor"). And that is
the plot that took me five minutes to write but

104 minutes to
watch.
Directed by
Paul Hunter,
whose resume
largely consists
of Puff Daddy
music videos,
"Monk" is a
movie that

seems to actively resist any and all qualities
that make a film an enjoyable experience.
The cast displays some of the worst acting
I've seen this year. While I did not expect
Stifler to give an Oscar-winning perfor
mance, he could have at least made me
laugh. King, that model-turned-actress
mentioned above, should just do the view
ing public a favor and quit the industry.
Don't ever act, direct, produce, cameo, etc.
in anything that robs people of both their
hard-earned income and time again. Final
ly, Yun-Fat deserves better than this lame
ass movie. To those geniuses in Hollywood,
don't give us the Americanized Yun-Fat of
"Anna and the King." Give us the old Yun-
Fat of those John Woo Hong Kong action
flicks, and we'll (or, at least I'll) be happy.
Moving on, the script, written by Ethan

Reif! and Cyrus Voris, forgets what good di
alogue is; it's as if the writers tried to create
the term, "bad dialogue" and define it with
this God-awful screenplay. Watching the
film, you can sometimes notice actors grin
ning through some of the film's more "dra
matic" lines suggesting that the filmmakers
behind "Monk" did not take their movie se
riously. Although bad movies that know
they are bad can sometimes be a good thing
(see J. Lo's 1997 film "Anaconda" for an ex

ample), "Monk" is a film whose utter stupid
ity and irrelevance demand its swift and
complete annihilation.
Unfortunately, with all the world's mod
ern technology, they have yet to invent the
gadget from "Men in Black" that can erase
a person's most recent memories. All that I
can do now is imagine what I could have
done with those precious 104 minutes
wasted on a movie that should not have
been made.
