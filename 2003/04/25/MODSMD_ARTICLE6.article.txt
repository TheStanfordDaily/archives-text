# Former journalism fellow passes away in Colombia
## 
### LESLIE COHEN 
Clara Ines Rueda, senior editor with the
Colombian paper El Tiempo and a John S.
Knight Professional Journalism Fellow at
Stanford during the 2000-01 academic year,
was killed April 7 in Bogota. She was 33.
Rueda was shot by police after her fi
ancee, Rodrigo Mora, allegedly failed
to stop driving through two police
checkpoints on their way home from a
restaurant.
A Colombian police officer stated,
"[Mora] threw his vehicle at them, made ag
gressive moves against the police and the
officer reacted by shooting his gun. All of
these moves were in accordance with the
norms and procedures."
However, Mora recounted a different
version of events for El Tiempo.
"We were talking, we didn't see any
thing, any stop sign," he told the paper.
"There were no signs to stop at or those
things they use to warn people and make
them stop. I didn't hear the shot either,
until she told me she was wounded."
When she received the Knight Fellow
ship, Rueda was managing editor at Ger
ente magazine. When she returned to
Colombia after her year of study, she
briefly worked for Stratcom Latin America
before rejoining El Tiempo, the largest
newspaper in Colombia, as business and
economics editor.

"She was a very serious and committed
journalist, who had deep concerns about
the future of her country," said Communi
cation Prof. Jim Bettinger, director of the
Knight Fellowships Program at Stanford.
Bettinger added, "Her journalistic am
bitions went hand-in-hand with a love of
life and a joy for each day that was never
extinguished."
Other Knight Fellows remembered her
lively nature.
"She was such a personification of gusto
for life," said Henrietta Grant-Peterkin, "I
remember her coming into my office some
times at the end of the week, and I'd quiz
her about her weekend plans — they were
always outrageous."
Before coming to Stanford, Rueda ex
pressed her deep commitment to journal
ism in her application for the fellowship.
"There are many reasons to love jour
nalism as a career," she wrote, "but for me
the main reason is that in undertaking it,
I also accepted a major responsibility with
society.
"Journalism is a profession through
which one can help others to become well
informed and develop grounded opinions
about history and reality," she added.
"Such an approach to the practice of jour
nalism is particularly significant in a coun
try like Colombia, where there are always so
many challenges to the construction of a
productive and democratic society."
