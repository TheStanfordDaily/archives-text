## Weapons searches come up empty; Hussein might already be dead 
### 
LIMA, Ohio (AP) — President Bush raised the
possibility yesterday that any Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction were destroyed before or during the U.S.-
led war, suggesting for the first time that coalition
troops may come up empty in their search.
"He tried to fool the United Nations and did for 12
years by hiding these weapons. And so it's going to
take time to find them," the president said at the Lima
Army Tank Plant. "But we know he had them. And
whether he destroyed them, moved them or hid
them, we're going to find out the truth."
In a television interview, meanwhile, Bush said
there was "some evidence" suggesting Saddam
Hussein is dead. "The person who helped direct
the (U.S. bombing) attacks believes that Saddam at
the very minimum was severely wounded," Bush
told NBC.
He also said U.S. troops would remain in Iraq "as
long as necessary." In the interview aboard Air Force
One, Bush was asked by NBC "Nightly News" an
chor Tom Brokaw if that could take as long as two
years. "Could —or less," Bush said to Brokaw.
"Who knows?"
A senior administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Bush's remarks about
weapons were based on information from at least
one Iraqi scientist who has led coalition forces to
materials used in the production of weapons of
mass destruction and who has said some weapons
were destroyed before the war, others perhaps af
terward.
It is believed that some weapons may have been re
moved from Iraq, and some probably remain, the of
ficial said.
Bush did not say how likely it was that weapons had
been destroyed, rather than hidden and perhaps
soon to be uncovered.
"One thing's for certain, Saddam Hussein no
longer threatens America with weapons of mass de
struction," he said.
