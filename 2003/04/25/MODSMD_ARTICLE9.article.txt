WASHINGTON (AP) — North
Korea's lead official at nuclear
weapons talks in China told a U.S.
envoy that his country has nuclear
weapons and may test, export or use
them depending on U.S. Ac tions, a se
nior American official said yesterday.
The comment was made by North
Korean delegate Ri Gun to Assistant
Secretary of State James Kelly during
a social gathering Wednesday follow
ing formal discussions on the North's
nuclear weapons program, said these

nior U.S. official, speaking only on
condition of anonymity.
Kelly did not respond to Ri's com
ment, said the official.
According to the official, Ri said dur
ing the plenary session earlier that
North Korea has reprocessed all 8,000
spent nuclear fuel rods in its possession.
If true, that would put North
Korea much closer to building six to
eight additional weapons beyond
the one or two it is believed to have
at present.

An administration official said last
night it is doubtful the North Kore
ans have reprocessed or made signif
icant progress in reprocessing.
Large-scale reprocessing probably
would be detectable via satellite pho
tos, the official said.
Last Friday, North Korea said that
after initial preparations, it was "at
the point" of reprocessing, a state
ment apparently designed to in
crease its leverage heading into this
week's talks.

In South Korea, Ko Yoo-hwan, a
North Korea expert at Seoul's
Dongkuk University, said that if the
North "admitted that it was armed
with nuclear weapons, it means it i>
using its last card. It also means it's
going for its last, big deal with the.
United States."
He added that the United States
should note Pyongyang's position
that it will give up its nuclear pro
grams if Washington guarantees
regime's safety.
