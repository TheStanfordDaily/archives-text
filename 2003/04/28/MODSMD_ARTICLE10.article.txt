## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
With historical education marked as a top pri
ority, Holocaust Remembrance Week will begin
today to instruct students about the events and
impact of the Holocaust as well as its contempo
rary legacy in relation to foreign affairs.
Ilie week's events will commence tonight with
a memorial service and talk delivered by local
Holocaust survivor Helen Farkas. As author of
"A Memoir of Survival," Farkas will discuss her
personal experience in the Holocaust and what it
has come to mean to her.
Born in Romania near Hungary, Farkas ar
rived at Auschwitz in May of 1944. A survivor of
forced labor camps, she managed to escape dur
ing a death march in 1945.
"She has suffered gready yet still maintains the
courage to speak about her story to ensure that
younger generations never forget what hap
pened during the Holocaust," said Hillel coordi
nator Sophie Roberts. "I am very excited for

Helen to speak at Stanford because I leel that
hearing about the Holocaust directly from some
one who experienced it is far more significant
and profound than reading about it in a book or
hearing about it second hand."
Deborah Lipstadt will give the keynote ad
dress, which will discuss modern anti-Semitism,
Holocaust denial and her landmark case against
Holocaust-denier David Irving.
"In this event, students will hear that, even
more than 50 years after the Holocaust, we still
cannot tolerate those who deny that it occurred
or its relevance in our lives today," said Hillel Di
rector Debra Feldstein.
On Wednesday, Hillel will hold a vigil for tol
erance.
"The essence of the event is to demonstrate
that while the Holocaust is known for its devas
tating effect on the Jewish community, it also af
fected many other communities," Roberts said.
Stuart Eizenstat, deputy secretary of the trea
sury during the Clinton administration and the
former ambassador to the European Union, will

be giving a speech Thursday titled "Imperfect
Justice: Looted Assets, Slave Labor and the Un
finished Business of World War II."
The week will culminate in a showing of the
Academy Award-winning film ' The Pianist," in
partnership with FLiCKS. ()ther events are spon
sored by Stanford Hillel in conjunction with the
Education and Culture Committee of the Jewish
Leadership Council, the Hoover Institute, the
History Department, the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and several other campus organizations.
"[The events] are all extremely important in their
own ways," Roberts said. "In fact, that is why there is
Holocaust Remembrance Week at Stanford. At most
schools and other establishments, there is just the clay
of Holocaust Remembrance, Yom HaShoah.
"At Stanford, we recognized that the Holo
caust is of too much significance to have there be
just one clay of remembrance," she added. "Edu
cation is essential in terms of the goal of never for
getting what happened and the appropriate level
of education needed to even begin
to grasp the enormity of the pain
and suffering of the Holocaust."
According to Hillel organizers,
the week's main focus will be to com
memorate the lives of those who
were persecuted and killed during
the Holocaust and to remind the
University student body that such
atrocities should never occur again
to Jews or any other religious, racial,
ethnic or cultural group.
"We seek to educate the campus
community about the importance
of tolerance and the necessity of
each individual's commitment to
fighting against the discrimination,
prejudice and bigotry that lead to
hate speech and hate crimes of any
kind against any person or group of
individuals," Feldstein said.
Roberts expressed her hope that
each person who attends an event
will walk away with a deeper under
standing of the Holocaust and the
importance of remembering and de
riving lessons from past atrocities.
