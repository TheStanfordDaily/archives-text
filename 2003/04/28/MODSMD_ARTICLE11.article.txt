# Law School serves in 'Building Community Day'
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Law School students, faculty and staff con
ducted three community service projects in
East Palo Alto and Redwood City on Saturday,
all part of Building Community Day .
The Ecumenical Hunger Project, one of
the three collaborative efforts through
which law students joined a number of com
munity volunteers to prepare a new office
for the organization, was paused when law
students discovered dynamite in one of the
buildings. They called the Palo Alto Fire De
partment, which arrived with a bomb squad,
and the law students were able to finish the
day of volunteering.
While the other sites were tamer than the
Ecumenical Hunger Project, law student vol-

unteers had their hands full with building and
renovating for various non-profit organiza
tions. In the Ravenswood School District, vol
unteers constructed and repaired parts of the
Flood Elementary School playground and
planted eight large flower pots.
The 49ers Academy project in East Palo Alto
gave law students direct communication with
eighth graders through a program called
Streetlaw. Volunteers talked to middle school
students about the legal system and construct
ed a memorial garden in honor of a deceased
community member.
"At the end of the day there were about 50
volunteers who worked and benefited from af
filiation with the Law School," said organizer
David Kovick, a law student, of his work with
the Ecumenical Hunger project. "It was real
community building."

Building Community Day is an annual tra
dition organized by the Law School. This
"Christmas in April" event has given law stu
dents, faculty and staff outreach opportunities
for over a decade.
Sponsored by the Public Interest Law Stu
dents Association, Building Community Day
solicited support from neighboring businesses
such as Trader Joe's, Feet's Coffee, Home
Depot and Ciardelli's Nursery. The majority of
the funding for the project came from the office
of Dean of Students Cathy Glaze.
"The goal of this Law School philanthropy
project is to help nonprofits and schools get
major projects taken care of in one day," said
Corene Kendrick, a law student and organizer
of the day."It gives students an opportunity to
give back to the area community — and not
necessarily simply based on their legal skills."
