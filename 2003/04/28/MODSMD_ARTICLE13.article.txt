increases their chances.

away from campus may obtain priority by contacting the house, but
friends cannot obtain priority for them.
Alter obtaining priority from a residence, students must submit their

'Hidden Wars of Desert Storm' airs on Thursday
The United Nations Association Film Festival and the Stanford Film
Society present the film "Hidden Wars of Desert Storm" this Thursday
in Annenberg Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
The documentary, made in 2000 by filmmakers Cerard Ungerman
and Audrey Brohy, explores controversial issues from the Gulf War
such as how diplomacy was used, what alternative purposes were behind
the embargo against Iraq and the role the media played in influencing
people's perceptions of the war.
" 'Hidden Wars' is very relevant today as the current situation with
Iraq is the product of a long history of Western involvement in this coun
try," said Ungerman, a former infantry platoon leader. "The film also
helps the viewer to understand the level of threat the Iraqi regime was
posing today to the world and the general conditions of the country after
13 years of embargo."
To better comprehend the Gulf War, the filmmakers used documents
never before seen on television and interviews with prominent figures
such as General Norman Schwarzkopf, former Attorney General Ram
sey Clark and former U.N.-Iraq Program Director Dennis Halliday.
Ungerman and his wife, Brohy, hope "Hidden Wars" gives the view
er more reason to follow a critical path as opposed to saying 'amen' to
anything originating from the corporate media."
I he New York limes has described the film "as an uncommonly
sober, well-researched film of its type."
