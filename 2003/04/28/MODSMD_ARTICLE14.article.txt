## In the aftermath of war Iraqi liaison surrenders 
### 
BAIJI, Iraq (AP) — The Iraqi
chief liaison to U.N. weapons in
spectors surrendered to U.S.
forces yesterday, as American
troops performed further tests on
a metal drum that initial readings
suggested contains nerve agents
and mustard gas.
Lt. Gen. Hossam Mohammed
Amin — No. 49 on the U.S. list of
the 55 most-wanted figures from
the regime of Saddam Hussein,
the six of clubs in the deck of fugi
tive playing cards — was taken
into custody in Baghdad.
Capt. Kellie Rourke, division
battle captain with the 101st Air
borne Division, said Amin surren
dered to soldiers of the division's
2nd Brigade and was taken to the
for questioning.
Also known as Hossem Mo
hammed Amin al-Yasin, he was
among the key figures in Sad
dam's weapons programs. He
would be expected to have de
tailed knowledge of any illegal ar
maments and where they might be
found, if they exist.
Meanwhile, 12 suspicious 55-
gallon drums were found propped
up with gravel in an open field near
the northern Iraqi town of Baiji.
Preliminary tests performed at the
scene indicated one drum might
contain the nerve agent cyclosarin
and a blister agent that could be
mustard gas, U.S. troops said.
But more tests were being con
ducted. By design, initial test pro
cedures favor positive readings,
erring on the side of caution.
The New York Times quoted
Capt. Ryan Cutchin of Mobile Ex

ploitation Team Bravo — one of
the specialist teams deployed in
Iraq — as saying further testing by
his unit had shown that the bar
rel's contents were not chemical
weapons. He also said that initial
suspicions that two vehicles at the
site were mobile chemical labora
tories had proved wrong.
There was no immediate com
ment from U.S. Central Command
in Doha, Qatar, about the report,
posted on the Times site yesterday.
There have been numerous
false reports that coalition forces
have turned up chemical or bio
logical weapons. Since the discov
ery, Central Command has been
measured in its response.
"There are many sites that we
look into every day, and when we
have confirmed positive results we
will provide that information,"
spokesman Capt. Stewart Upton
said earlier yesterday. "We just
want to be very cautious that when
we go with the information, that
when we release nuclear, biologi
cal, or chemical information, that
we're accurate."
Mustard gas burns skin, eyes
and lungs, while exposure to high
amounts cyclosarin may lead to loss
of muscle control, twitching, paral
ysis, unconsciousness, convulsions,
coma, and death within minutes.
Lt. Col. Ted Martin of the 10th
Cavalry Regiment said soldiers
went to the site near Baiji at mid
night Friday after being alerted by
U.S. Special Forces teams who be
came suspicions of the site because
of the presence of surface-to-air
missiles guarding the area.
