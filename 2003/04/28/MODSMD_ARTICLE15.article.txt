BEIJING (AP) — Karaoke par
lors, movie theaters and discos
shut their doors yesterday under
orders from Beijing officials trying
to contain the spread of SARS,
which claimed more lives in the
Chinese capital, Hong Kong,
Taipei, Singapore and Toronto.
As Beijing health officials
recorded eight new deaths and
said as many as 2,300 people
might be infected, hundreds of
construction workers labored
around the clock to build a 1,000-
bed isolation ward for SARS pa
tients. A ninth person died else
where in mainland China, bring
ing its total to 131, and 12 more
died in Hong Kong.
Taiwan, which reported its first
SARS death, imposed a mandato
ry 10-day quarantine on travelers
from areas affected by the virus _
including mainland China, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and
Toronto. But officials did not an
nounce where those travelers
would stay while quarantined.
Those violating the quarantine,
including foreigners, can be jailed
for up to two years or fined up to
$8,600, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said.
Trying to stem panic over the
flu-like disease, the World Health
Organization said yesterday there
was still time to keep SARS from
spreading globally if affected
countries take strong enough ac
tion, and through travel warnings
and checks of travelers for symp
toms, such as fever, dry cough and
shortness of breath.

WHO planned today to desig
nate Vietnam as the world's first
country to successfully contain its
outbreak. No new cases have been
reported there since April 8 —
meeting the window of 20 days, or
twice the disease's incubation peri
od, set by the WHO as the stan
dard for declaring that the out
break is no longer spreading.
"I think we still have a window of
opportunity. At the moment, we
still have a chance to contain it and
to have it go down in the places
where outbreaks are already hap
pening and avoid it spreading to
new countries," WHO director Gro
Harlem Brundtland said in an in
terview on the BBC.
The WHO has issued travel
warnings for affected areas, includ
ing regions of China and Toronto,
which reported its 21st victim yes
terday. Canada has the biggest out
break of SARS outside of Asia.
SARS, or severe acute respira
tory syndrome, has killed 319 peo
ple from Beijing to Toronto in the
past several months and sickened
more than 4,800 others world
wide. There have been 41 cases in
the United States, but no deaths.
Barring any last-minute new
cases, Vietnam was to be declared
the first country to beat the disease.
Vietnam had five deaths from
SARS after the virus spread
through Hanoi's only internation
al hospital, which closed its doors
on March 11 — a move that is
credited with containing the out
break.
