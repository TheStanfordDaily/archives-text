## The 						Stanford Daily Labor talks were flawed 
### 
Editorial

Labor relations on campus have
been a part of the Stanford com
munity dialogue for over 30
years and will undoubtedly re
main in the spotlight for many years to
come. Over the past six years, attention
has focused on hospital support staff and
food service personnel, most of whom fall
in the categoi-y of subcontracted labor. In
a series of high-profile protests, these la
borers and a handful of student activist
groups have joined forces, demanding liv
ing wages and health and dental care ben
efits for subcontracted workers. Last Fri
day, the University released its long-await
ed resolution of living wage guidelines,
wherein it affirmed a two-tiered mini
mum wage standard for contract labor.
We applaud the University, student ac
tivists, Stanford laborers and labor leaders
for their efforts to reach this resolution.
Though the current living-wage resolu-

tion may contain am
biguities and does
not cover as many
workers as might be
desirable, it repre
sents the beginning
of what we hope will
be a new pledge to all
who work here. We
support the Univer
sity's stated coinmit

ment to providing a living wage for its
workers and praise the efforts of the stu
dent labor activist groups who brought
the living-wage issue to the forefront.
Yet we also believe there were flaws in
the ways both sides dealt with one another.
The University said it sought input
from all members of the community, yet
many people simply were not part of the
discussions about living wage. A one-time
sparsely attended forum discussion dur
ing Dead Week does not suffice. In ad
dressing labor issues, the University has a
responsibility to assume a leadership role
on campus, taking charge to promote fur
ther dialogue among laborers and stu
dent groups and making visible its efforts
to reach out to labor leaders and student
activists. Similarly, the University ought to
partner with student groups in publiciz
ing their mutual efforts, with the goal of
making more transparent and compre
hensible such University policy decisions.
Many labor activists were unaware that
new guidelines were even being released.
On the student activists and laborers'
side, there were also several faults in their
approach that may have prevented them
from achieving more of the results they

The campaign failed to convince
the majority of the Stanford
community why it should care
about small groups of workers.

desired. At several times activists made
unreasonable demands and revealed in
sensitivity to the nature of crafting Uni
versity policy. For example, living-wage
demonstrators demanded that tempo
rary workers receive such benefits as
parking permits and extra compensation
if they commute from more than 60 miles
away, perquisites that even faculty and ad
ministrators do not receive.
Throughout the living-wage cam
paign, labor activists applied undue pres
sure to University President John Hen
nessy, at times demanding that he alone
intervene although it might not be appro
priate. Ultimately, the activists prevailed
in getting Hennessy to respond to their
demands, yet failed at the greater task of
making him a strategic ally.
At a theoretical level, the notion of a liv
ing wage is perplexing even to eminent
economists. Yet the labor activists failed to

define "living wage"
clearly and simply
such that everyone
could understand
and take an informed
position. As a result,
the campaign failed
to convince the ma
jority of the Stanford
community why it
should care about

small groups of workers, or why these
workers ought to have better health and
dental benefits than 7,000 Stanford grad
uate students.
Considered by itself, the issue of a living
wage is not inherently controversial —
who is fundamentally opposed to paying
Stanford workers wages that enable them
to meet the cost of living here? Yet activists
offered only one solution — increased
unionization — the consequence of
which would likely be the addition of an
other constraint to labor issues, rendering
further work less tractable. Perhaps most
prominently, labor activists raised appre
hensions that their demands might be
more overly concerned with increasing
union influence, as their proposed code of
conduct appeared suspiciously to resem
ble a collective bargaining agreement.
Like many notable projects on campus,
labor relations is an unfinished work, one
which will evolve further by what we hope
will be conscientious leadership on both
sides. We urge that both sides of the living
wage issue not regard the University's res
olution as the final word, but rather as
momentum to advance labor relations on
campus.
