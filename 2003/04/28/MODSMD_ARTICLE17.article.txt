# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## A 						new union: now or never 
### 
Over the weekend, a
profro approached us
with a question. His
innocent young face
reflected a mixture of naive con
fusion and bewilderment as he
asked us, "Where's the student
union?" Apparently, the answer
was not in his red folder. We
looked at each other, puzzled by
his simple request. We asked that
he define this "student union."
He described a magical place
where "students congregate, in
teract socially and play games to
gether." We simultaneously real
ized in horror that the Stanford
version of this Utopian edifice is
none other than Tresidder.
At every other college across
the country, the student union is
the central hub of campus. You
wouldn't go a day without pass
ing through it.
On our campus, a true student
union would be an indoor White
Plaza. Think how much better it
would be if there were a place to
table that did not have the pitfalls
of a sectioned-off thoroughfare
that resembles tent city or shanty
town, if you will. Is it too much to
ask to have a viable, designated
location to advertise your upcom
ing a cappella Israeli rap concert
that doesn't get rained on three
months out of the year? Or even
not to have to schlep tables and
chairs all the way from Tresidder
to White Plaza, only to have all
your trite, poorly drawn fliers
blow away as you desperately try
to cling to the last remaining
sheets, declaring that the next of
ficial meeting of the Stanford
hackey sack society is tonight?
In order to make Tresidder a
more useful and attractive loca
tion, there should be several com
puters available on the ground
floor for people to check their e
mail and do other errands. Now

we know that the LAIR has more
computers than anyone ever
uses, but they are cloistered away
upstairs and are completely un
inviting. Think of the warm,
fuzzy feeling you get when you
see the shining apple computers
in building 160 (also known as
Wallenberg Hall") that practical
ly beg you to come inside and
find out that the motif "appear
ance versus reality" not only ap
plies to "The Odyssey," but also
to your friend's drunken hook-

up history this quarter.
Once you have been lured in
side, a student union should pro
vide a place to hang out. We need
comfortable couches or futons
that are actually conducive to ex
tended relaxation, unlike the
tired-looking frumpily uphol
stered chairs currently in the up
stairs of Tresidder. Moving in
new casual furniture to a renovat
ed assembly-type open room on
the first floor would also encour
age campus-wide fraternization.
If you added television to this
mix, it would be like the ideal form
of a dorm lounge, expanded to a
campus-wide scale. How nice
would it be to be able to go to
Tresidder and see CNN or ESPN?
The televisions could also broadcast
SCBN, giving the student-run sta
tion a built-in audience. Wouldn't
we unite the campus if everyone
were welcome to come watch Stan
ford win its first round game of
March Madness together, instead
of isolated in specific dorms?

If you get tired of sitting
around and watching television,
you should also have alternative
activities you can participate in
with your fellow peers. If Tresid
der Fitness were renovated into a
two-story shining paragon of ath
letic virtue, you could work out
without feeling like you are inside
a fishbowl — a stinky one at that.
There could be a rock climbing
wall and even (gasp!) elliptical
trainers. For non-athletic people,
there could be ping pong, foos
ball, air hockey, pool and, most
importantly, Dance Dance Revo
lution (also known as DDR).
We don't feel that our de
mands are unreasonable. Most
other schools have bowling and
arcades; is a ping-pong table too
much to ask? These amenities
would provide students with the
chance to meet people. Students
could have even more fun if there
were campus-wide competitions.
Wouldn't it be great to see that
guy who never said a word in
your I-Hum section bust a move
in DDR and win the title of "most
amazing dancer on campus"?
In the midst of campaign dis
cussions about increasing social
opportunities between classes
and on campus, why isn't there
any serious talk of creating a real
student union? The job of the
ASSU is to represent the overar
ching interests of all students. Its
primary function, however, has
descended into doling out money
to various student groups. While
such activity is clearly positive, it
should not be the ASSU's all-en
compassing purpose.
The reason why the ASSU be
haves in this disappointing man
ner is that they fall into the trap of
catering to vocal special interests,
instead of taking on larger pro-



Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi
grains that would benefit their
true constituency.
We have seen different com
munities on campus mobilize
their groups to demand that the
administration support the es
tablishment, expansion or fund
ing for their community centers,
but the ASSU refuses to do the
same for its members: the entire
student body.
Unfortunately, even if the
ASSU were to decide to take on
this cause, the University admin
istration's funds for such an un
dertaking may have already been
squandered on specialized inter
ests. The entire student body will
be deprived of an essential col
lege institution, unless the ASSU
is willing to make some tough
budget sacrifices. Maybe we don't
need to give $ 1,000 artistic grants
individual students out of the
special-fee surplus and should in
stead focus our resources on the
intended beneficiaries of the sur
plus (and the entire ASSU): the
general student body.
We call upon our leaders to
look beyond the politically expe
dient and do what is best for
every Stanford student: give us a
real student union.
Don V have an organization to speak for
you? We can empathize: eym(a>Stan
ford.edu and akendall@stanford.edu.

version of this Utopian edifice is
none other than Tresidder.
At every other college across
the country, the student union is
the central hub of campus. You
wouldn't go a day without pass
ing through it.
On our campus, a true student
union would be an indoor White
Plaza. Think how much better it
would be if there were a place to
table that did not have the pitfalls
of a sectioned-off thoroughfare
that resembles tent city or shanty
town, if you will. Is it too much to
ask to have a viable, designated
location to advertise your upcom
ing a cappella Israeli rap concert
that doesn't get rained on three
months out of the year? Or even
not to have to schlep tables and
chairs all the way from Tresidder
to White Plaza, only to have all
your trite, poorly drawn fliers
blow away as you desperately try
to cling to the last remaining
sheets, declaring that the next of
ficial meeting of the Stanford
hackey sack society is tonight?
In order to make Tresidder a
more useful and attractive loca
tion, there should be several com
puters available on the ground
floor for people to check their e
mail and do other errands. Now

we know that the LAIR has more
computers than anyone ever
uses, but they are cloistered away
upstairs and are completely un
inviting. Think of the warm,
fuzzy feeling you get when you
see the shining apple computers
in building 160 (also known as
Wallenberg Hall") that practical
ly beg you to come inside and
find out that the motif "appear
ance versus reality" not only ap
plies to "The Odyssey," but also
to your friend's drunken hook-

up history this quarter.
Once you have been lured in
side, a student union should pro
vide a place to hang out. We need
comfortable couches or futons
that are actually conducive to ex
tended relaxation, unlike the
tired-looking frumpily uphol
stered chairs currently in the up
stairs of Tresidder. Moving in
new casual furniture to a renovat
ed assembly-type open room on
the first floor would also encour
age campus-wide fraternization.
If you added television to this
mix, it would be like the ideal form
of a dorm lounge, expanded to a
campus-wide scale. How nice
would it be to be able to go to
Tresidder and see CNN or ESPN?
The televisions could also broadcast
SCBN, giving the student-run sta
tion a built-in audience. Wouldn't
we unite the campus if everyone
were welcome to come watch Stan
ford win its first round game of
March Madness together, instead
of isolated in specific dorms?

If you get tired of sitting
around and watching television,
you should also have alternative
activities you can participate in
with your fellow peers. If Tresid
der Fitness were renovated into a
two-story shining paragon of ath
letic virtue, you could work out
without feeling like you are inside
a fishbowl — a stinky one at that.
There could be a rock climbing
wall and even (gasp!) elliptical
trainers. For non-athletic people,
there could be ping pong, foos
ball, air hockey, pool and, most
importantly, Dance Dance Revo
lution (also known as DDR).
We don't feel that our de
mands are unreasonable. Most
other schools have bowling and
arcades; is a ping-pong table too
much to ask? These amenities
would provide students with the
chance to meet people. Students
could have even more fun if there
were campus-wide competitions.
Wouldn't it be great to see that
guy who never said a word in
your I-Hum section bust a move
in DDR and win the title of "most
amazing dancer on campus"?
In the midst of campaign dis
cussions about increasing social
opportunities between classes
and on campus, why isn't there
any serious talk of creating a real
student union? The job of the
ASSU is to represent the overar
ching interests of all students. Its
primary function, however, has
descended into doling out money
to various student groups. While
such activity is clearly positive, it
should not be the ASSU's all-en
compassing purpose.
The reason why the ASSU be
haves in this disappointing man
ner is that they fall into the trap of
catering to vocal special interests,
instead of taking on larger pro-



Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi
grains that would benefit their
true constituency.
We have seen different com
munities on campus mobilize
their groups to demand that the
administration support the es
tablishment, expansion or fund
ing for their community centers,
but the ASSU refuses to do the
same for its members: the entire
student body.
Unfortunately, even if the
ASSU were to decide to take on
this cause, the University admin
istration's funds for such an un
dertaking may have already been
squandered on specialized inter
ests. The entire student body will
be deprived of an essential col
lege institution, unless the ASSU
is willing to make some tough
budget sacrifices. Maybe we don't
need to give $ 1,000 artistic grants
individual students out of the
special-fee surplus and should in
stead focus our resources on the
intended beneficiaries of the sur
plus (and the entire ASSU): the
general student body.
We call upon our leaders to
look beyond the politically expe
dient and do what is best for
every Stanford student: give us a
real student union.
Don V have an organization to speak for
you? We can empathize: eym(a>Stan

Over the weekend, a
profro approached us
with a question. His
innocent young face
reflected a mixture of naive con
fusion and bewilderment as he
asked us, "Where's the student
union?" Apparently, the answer
was not in his red folder. We
looked at each other, puzzled by
his simple request. We asked that
he define this "student union."
He described a magical place
where "students congregate, in
teract socially and play games to
gether." We simultaneously real
ized in horror that the Stanford
version of this Utopian edifice is
none other than Tresidder.
