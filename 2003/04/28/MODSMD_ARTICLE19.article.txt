Psychologist's talk exhibited lack of
sensitivity toward LGBT community
I want to thank Joan Roughgarden for
her guest column, "Psychology lecture
lacks sensitivity to sexual orientation"
(April 25) in which Roughgarden reports
an event that portrays members of the
Stanford community as embracing cultur
al and social intolerance, including using
humor and denigration at the deplorable
expense of others, about a certain commu
nity — in this case, the lesbian, gay, bi-sex
ual and transgendered community.
1 am quite certain a similar enactment
focused on the African-American and / or
latino communities, for example, would
have brought immediate reaction from
members of the Stanford community. I
am writing in hopes that Stanford will re
dress the matter and publicly distance it
self from this event while reaffirming its
commitment to tolerance and diversity.
The lack of sensitivity and decorum ex
hibited by the members of tiie audience, at
the apparent expense of the LGBTcommu

nity, does not portray Stanford well — even
taking into account the University's need to
allow a wide range of opinions and positions
to l>e expressed in pursuit of academic free
dom. Stanford is a world-renowned learning
and research institution, whose behavior
and community presence should serve as a
world-class model of diversity and tolerance
for others to emulate.

Northwestern U. Psychology professor's
teaching methods questionable
I am writing in response to Joan
Roughgarden's guest column, in which
she criticizes Northwestern University
Psychology Prof. Michael Bailey's lecture,
"Gender Nonconformity and Sexual Ori
entation." I am not qualified to comment
on Professor Bailey's recent book because
I have not read it, but the description of
the manner in which the lecture was pre
sented raises the gravest doubts in my
mind concerning Bailey's teaching meth
ods. Is it his intention to be a popular en

tertainer, taking as his material the theme
of "gay bashing" or does he wish to be re
spected as a serious investigator?
According to Roughgarden's account
of the lecture, "Voices of two gay men and
two straight men were played and the au
dience was asked to guess who was gay and
who was straight. Those who guessed cor
rectly grinned with joy and were applaud
ed by their neighbors, leading to the con
clusion that if a gay sounds really gay, then
he probably is." If Bailey is presenting this
kind of material as serious scientific evi
dence, can we similarly expect a return to
the days of the black-face minstrel as a rep
resentative of the black community?

Stanford community must learn about
both Turkish and Armenian histories
I have written about the alleged Arme
nian Genocide in The Daily in the past and
this time, in response to the guest column,
"Turkey must officially recognize the Ar
menian Genocide" (April 24), I do not
want to repeat all of the evidence that had

been cited numerous times since it seems
that the only outcome of such an approach
is blatant denial and dismissal of this evi
dence by the Armenian-American com
munity. Instead, I have decided to bring
up a real life example of the "other side of
the story in Anatolia."
I am originally from Kemah, Turkey, a
remote town of about 20,000 people in the
eastern part of the country. What the Arme
nian community will not tell you (or admit
to) is the story of my town during World
War I (at the time it wasjust a village). While
my great-grandfather and most able-bodied
men were fighting against the Russians in
the Northern border, armed Armenian
militia massacred around 200 of the towns
people — mostly women, old men and chil
dren— in January 1916.
My family was survived by my grand
mother and her two youngest children,
not because Armenian militia spared
them, but because her Jewish neighbors
had the decency to hide them in their stor
age house. A grant! total of 20 Muslim vil
lage residents survived to report this mas
sacre by the Armenian militia. There are
similar stories from all over eastern Anato
lia from Igdir to Sivas, front Guinushane
to Elazig. Many mass graves were uncov

ered in these areas that have clear indica
tions of a people with Muslim beliefs. The
25,000 lurks massacred by Armenian
militia in Van is documented with gross
details by foreign and domestic sources.
I could be filled with anger and hatred
toward the Armenians with this kind of a
history behind me, but I am not. I could
ask for reparations for their genocidal acts
but I don't. I could ask this continuing cul
ture of hatred to stop killing Azeris in
Karabagh in this modern contemporary
society but I don't bring that up, either. In
stead, 1 disown hate and prejudice and
move on to live my life. I hope that the
friendships I build with Armenian Ameri
cans will eventually result in an under
standing where both peoples will be able to
live in harmony and peace.
One-sided stories are easy to sell if you
don't know the story of the other side. I
urge the Stanford community to read and
learn and draw its own conclusions and
lessons from the history of these two peo
ples. Hopefully, this way, we will learn
from the past mistakes but still continue to
face the future with unrelenting goodwill
toward our fellow men and women.
