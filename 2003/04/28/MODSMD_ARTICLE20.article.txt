# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Holocaust Remembrance Week teaches to improve the future 
### SOPHIE ROBERTS GUEST COLUMNIST 
"Why is there so much hatred and suf
fering.-' asked a student in the sixth grade
religious school class that 1 teach as we dis
cussed Holocaust Remembrance Day,
which is tomorrow. "And why don't we
ever do anything to stop it?"
Each year we take time to remember
the Holocaust. Jews and non-Jews alike
commit themselves to the promise that
never again will there be a repetition of the
Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jewish
people. A fundamental concept of "never
again," is never forgetting what hap
pened. However, is pure remembering
enough?
The question posed by my 11-year-old

student is, in tact, the essence of what
Holocaust remembrance programs are
about. This week, the Jewish Leadership
Council of Hillel at Stanford will be hold
ing its Holocaust Remembrance Week.
The week consists of several programs
including a talk given by a Holocaust sur
vivor; a talk give by Deborah Lipstadt,
author of "Denying the Holocaust: The
Crowing Assault on Truth and Memory";
a vigil for tolerance; a talk given by Stuart
Eizenstat, former ambassador to the Eu
ropean Union; and a film screening of
"The Pianist" in partnership with Flicks.
These events strive not only to help stu
dents remember what happened and
learn about the Holocaust — but also to
go beyond that.
There is a level of passivity in just re

membrance. This is not to say that re
membrance is not enough. To be sure, re
membering the Holocaust and hearing
the stories of survivors is what has kept the
history alive for so long.
Yet, remembering only does so much.
As Lipstadt will discuss in her lecture to
morrow, there is still a great deal that
needs to be done in regard to the Holo
caust. Refusal to acknowledge the Holo
caust remains a powerful and disturbing
force throughout the world and threat
ens to undermine and negate the incred
ible suffering of countless victims. It is in
conceivable that this kind of "revisionist"
history is allowed to exist, and what is
even more disturbing is that it finds an
audience.
Remembering the Holocaust presents

us with an important opportunity to con
sider what can be done today to prevent
similar events from occurring in the fu
ture. The failure of world governments to
act at the time of the Holocaust remains an
enormous stain on state histories, includ
ing our own. Why did it take so long for
the world powers to stop what was hap
pening? If someone had taken the neces
sary steps sooner, would so many lives
have been lost? History gives us 20/20 vi
sion, yet this vision needs to be applied to
our world today.
Each day, countless numbers of people
are dying from terrorism, disease, famine,
poverty, hatred and cruelty. People are
forced to live their lives in fear — fear of
sending their children off to school on a
bus that may be bombed, fear of not being

able to buy enough food to survive
through the week, fear of contracting
AIDS, fear of their government. As we re
member the past, we must look at the fu
ture. Never again, never forget.
This week, I implore everyone to take
this opportunity to remember the enor
mous suffering of the Holocaust and use it
as a vehicle to improve the future. The
programs of Holocaust Remembrance
Week will serve to encourage people to
look at the history and see how learning
from the past can shape the future.
