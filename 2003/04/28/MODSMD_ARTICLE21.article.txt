All good things must come to an end,
and the Cardinal's eight-series winning
streak was a good thing.

Stanford has been even tougher to beat
at home, having won every Pac-10 series
on campus since 1999. But Arizona took
two of three to drop the Cardinal from its
pervious perch at the top of the confer
ence.
Arizona State is now tied with Stanford
for the Pac-10 lead, with the Wildcats and
USC one game behind.
Junior John Hudgins pitched his
fourth complete game of the season on
Friday.
Hudgins shut the Wildcats down in
seven innings, but gave up a triple and a
home run in a rainy fifth inning, as well as
a solo homer in the eighth that lifted Ari
zona to a 4-3 lead.
"They got the big hits and we didn't,"

head coach Mark Marquess said. "We had
a couple of chances and just couldn't get
the big hit. They won the big spots and de
served to win the game."
The fact that junior Carlos Quentin's
26-game hitting streak came to an end
seemed to go along with the dreary weath
er and Cardinal loss.
While Friday's contest was a low-hit,
low-scoring ballgame with the outcome
determined by a few key hits, both teams'
bats woke up on Saturday.
Quentin blasted a two-run homer in
the first inning to give the Cardinal the
early lead, and senior Ryan Garko hit his
10th home run of the season in the third.
Arizona's Brian Anderson, who hit the
game-winning home run in Friday's
game, proved again to be a thorn in the
Cardinal's side. The junior hit an inside
the-park grand slam in the third and
homered again in the eighth (this time the
conventional way: over the fence) to give
the Wildcats a 9-6 lead heading into the
bottom of the inning.
However, the Cardinal offense had a
quick response.
Garko walked to start the bottom of the
eighth. A grounder by sophomore Danny
Putnam to Arizona pitcher Brian Pemble

had Cardinal fans holding their breath,
fearing a possible double play, but Pem
ble's throw to second was off the mark and
Garko advanced to third.
Freshman Jed Lowrie singled to bring
in Garko, and sophomore Donny Lucy,
who pinch hit for senior Jonny Ash, came
through with another single that drove in
Putnam.
The score then stood at 9-8, and fresh
man Chris Minaker laid down a perfect
sacrifice bunt. With runners at second and
third, senior Tobin Swope was intention
ally walked to bring up junior Sam Fuld,
who destroyed the Wildcats' hopes fora
double play with a two-RBI double.
"It seemed like it was going to be a
slugfest from the beginning," Fuld said. "I
knew we had a great chance even when we
were down three runs late in the game."
Fuld's clutch hit put the Cardinal
ahead 10-9, which stood as the final score
after freshman closer Matt Manship shut
down the Wildcats in the ninth.
"I was really proud of the way we
hung in the game today and came up
with some big hits," Marquess said.
"Every time Arizona scored, we were al-

ways able to answer by scoring in
our half of the inning."
Sunday's game provided a less
favorable outcome for the Cardinal
as .Arizona took the rubber game by

a score of 11-6.
Stanford's starter, senior Ryan
McCally, gave up four runs without
finishing the second inning. Man
ship follow McCally, and a wild pitch
and a balk brought in one more of
McCally's runners before he ended
the inning with a strikeout.
Manship gave up two runs over
the next four innings and took the

loss. Junior David O'Hagan and
sophomore Jonny Dyer each gave
up one run in run inning. Sopho
more Mark Jecmen pitched the
ninth and allowed no runs, but the
damage had already been done.
"We didn't pitch very well this
series," Marquess said. "We'll
need to pitch better if we hope to
do well for the remainder of the

Pac-10 schedule."
Stanford showed its resilience
again with a four-run third inning to
even the score at 5-5. The Cardinal
even took a one-run lead in the fifth,
but was unable to answer the Wild
cats' next six runs.
"If you don't play well on any
given weekend in the Pac-10, you
are going to lose," Marquess said.
