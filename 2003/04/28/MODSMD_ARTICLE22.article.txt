# Women clinch the MPSF crown
## 
### FELIPE VALDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It took 19 extra minutes for the No. 3 Stanford
women's water polo team to secure the 2003 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Championship and the re
sultant automatic bid to nationals.
The heart-stopping game saw two overtime and five
sudden-victory periods as No. 1 UCLA (21-4, 10-3
MPSF) dropped the 3-2 decision. The contest was
tough until the end, with both teams exhibiting tight
defense.
Freshman Laurel Champion put the Cardinal on
the board just two minutes into the first quarter. But
that early goal didn't set the tenor of the duel, as each
impenetrable defense kept either team from finding
the net in the second period.
UCLA leveled the game at 1-1 with 3 minutes re
maining in the third. UCLA had another chance late in
the third, but Cardinal senior goalie Jackie Frank dis
played her quick hands as she blocked a penalty shot to
shut down the Bruin threat.
In the fourth quarter, Champion notched another
Cardinal goal with 3:39 left in regulation, giving Stan
ford the lead 2-1. But UCLA countered with a goal of
their own, tying it up at 2-2 and sending the game into
overtime.
After two overtimes and four sudden-victory peri
ods, the game was still lied. Then, sophomore Kelty
Luber found the back of the net with an outside shot
and clinch the victory for Stanford.
"We played wonderfully on defense and Jackie was
amazing," coach John Tanner said. "Individually I
think we did a really good job in preventing [UCLA]
from getting any easy scoring opport unities in front of
the goal.
"Kelty had an amazing shot at the end. After almost
two hours of water polo, it was nice to see somebody
like that step up and nail a great shot ."
Frank was a stalwart in the goal during the 110-
minute matchup, racking up 22 saves.
"It was a really great game of water polo. I've never
played in such a long game before," Frank said. "Those
games really hurt you if you lose or really pump you up il
you win. UCIA played a really great game. It was exciting."
Stanford's talent was on display from day one of the
tournament. On Friday, the Cardinal soundly defeat
ed UCSB 10-1 and Saturday's semifinal saw Stanford
trounce fourth-seeded Long Beach State 9-1.
