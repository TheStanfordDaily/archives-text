# Pro squads draw four Cards
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
This year's NFL Draft was as a whole
rather predictable, but that statement does
not apply to the Cardinal's draft hopefuls.
Amazingly, senior safety Colin Branch was
drafted in the fourth round, while senior
fullback Casey Moore — widely rated as
one of the top fullbacks in the draft —
wasn't picked until late in the seventh and
final round.
Even those picks which were not surpris

ing were notable for their local character.
Junior tackle Kwame Harris went 26th
overall and will suit up alongside Stanford
alumnus Eric Heitmann on the San Fran
cisco 49ers offensive line, while sophomore
Teyo Johnson, who will play tight end in the
pros, went in the second round to Oakland.
While Harris and Johnson will play across
the Bay from each other, Branch and Moore
will once again be teammates, as both players
were selected by the Carolina Panthers.

Junior Kwame Harris grapples with an Arizona Wildcat last season. The offensive tackle was
the 26th pick in the NFL Draft's first round and will soon begin his pro career with the 49ers.
