# Pro squads draw four Cards
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
This year's NFL Draft was as a whole
rather predictable, but that statement does
not apply to the Cardinal's draft hopefuls.
Amazingly, senior safety Colin Branch was
drafted in the fourth round, while senior
fullback Casey Moore — widely rated as
one of the top fullbacks in the draft —
wasn't picked until late in the seventh and
final round.
Even those picks which were not surpris

ing were notable for their local character.
Junior tackle Kwame Harris went 26th
overall and will suit up alongside Stanford
alumnus Eric Heitmann on the San Fran
cisco 49ers offensive line, while sophomore
Teyo Johnson, who will play tight end in the
pros, went in the second round to Oakland.
While Harris and Johnson will play across
the Bay from each other, Branch and Moore
will once again be teammates, as both players
were selected by the Carolina Panthers.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Junior Kwame Harris grapples with an Arizona Wildcat last season. The offensive tackle was
the 26th pick in the NFL Draft's first round and will soon begin his pro career with the 49ers.
C)ffensive guard Greg Schindler,
defensive tackle Matt Leonard and
running back Kerry Carter, all se
niors, went undrafted. Prior to the
draft, Pro Football Weekly projec t
ed that Leonard could go as high as
the third round. Both Carter and
Schindler had been projected as
possible late-round picks.
Various scouting publications
lauded the smarts and technique of
Carter, Leonard and Schindler, but
all were also penalized by the same
groups for lacking the exceptional
athleticism for which NFL teams
hunger. In the draft, physical gifts
are usually the tie-breaker. A couple
rxtra inches of height, another 10

reps on the 225-pound bench press,
or a 10th of a second in the 40-yard
dash can make a lot more difference
than a player's actual performance in
college.
Branch was the surprise success
story of the draft, rising from obscuri
ty due to a strong performance at the
draft combines. His size (5-11, 203)
and spectacular time in the all-impor
tant 40 (4.41) made him an appealing
project player for the Panthers.
Harris and Johnson were both
proven draft quantities, possessing
enough physical talent and poten
tial to be called in the early rounds.
Harris' size (6-7), mobility and
athleticism made him one of the top
linemen in the draft, despite the
prevailing opinion that he could
have benefited from another year in
college and in the weight room.
Johnson was seen asapass-catch

er with the rare combination of
height and athleticism. His strength
made him an attractive pick, al
though his 4.65 showing in the 40
probably relegates the college re
ceiver to the role of tight end or H
back.
Of note is that a 2-9 Cardinal
team produced four draft picks and
a half-dozen legitimate NFL talents.
National champion Ohio State, by
comparison, produced five draft
picks. In the Pacific-10 Conference,
only Southern California produced
more draft picks (five).
The wealth of talent on the cur
rent Stanford roster — including
this year's stellar recruiting class —
ensures that, regardless of Stan
ford's performance as a team, indi
vidual Stanford players are sure to
play a significant role in the NFL
Draft for years to come.
