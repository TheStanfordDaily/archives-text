# Defense comes alive
## 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
When a team plays itself, one
side has to win. Saturday's Cardinal
and White spring game at Stanford
Stadium pitted Stanford football's
offense (Cardinal) against its de
fense (White), and the White squad
emerged victorious.
Stanford's defense was criticized
throughout last season for its inex
perience, and with another season
under its pads, all early signs point
to a defensive renewal on the Farm.
Coach Buddy Teevens returns
eight starters on a defense that held
the Cardinal squad to only four
touchdowns on 18 offensive drives.
The White boasted four quarter
back sacks, a fumble recovery and
three interceptions, including a 49-
yard interception return by redshirt
freshman linebacker Mike Silva.
Still, the defense's dominance
might be a testimony not to their re
markable improvement but to the
fact that they were playing against a
severely depleted Stanford offense.
Stanford's three most consistent of
fensive performers, fullback Casey
Moore, tackle Kwame Harris and
receiver Teyo Johnson were cho
sen in this weekend's NFL Draft
and will suit up on Sundays next
season.
Stanford will feel the loss, espe
cially on the offensive line, where
senior tackle Kirk Chambers is the
only returning starter, joining two
redshirt freshman and a sopho
more on the line.
"Anytime you have a majority of
freshmen on the offensive line

there's going to be some mistakes,"
said senior quarterback Chris
Lewis, who was 7-14 passing for 75
yards, one touchdown and one in
terception.
"They're tough guys and work
so hard. That's going to take them
a long way."
According to Teevens, Lewis'
experience gives him the starting
nod at the end of spring. He suf
fered through a miserable 2002
campaign which saw him sidelined
with an injury for much of the year.
Lewis maintains that the injury to
his throwing shoulder has turned
him into a better quarterback.
"Because of my injury my tech
nique has improved a lot," he said.
"I have to use my body a lot more
— before I was using just my arm."
On Saturday redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards showed that he
plans to give Lewis a run for the
starting spot come next fall. He
took the field at Stanford Stadium
and looked like he belonged —
completing 12 of 19 passes for 122
yards and a touchdown. He made
good reads and crisp passes, show
ing some of the skills that brought
him to Stanford as a top recruit out
of Los Gatos. He seems to have
passed sophomore Kyle Matter —
last year's starter for much of the
season — on the depth chart.
Teevens says that the player that
impressed him most this spring was
senior flanker Luke Powell. Powell
was the Cardinal's top receiver and
a first-team Ail-American punt re
turner in 2001, but was sidelined
for much of last fall with ankle and
groin injuries. The past weeks have
given Teevens his first glimpse at
what the speedy receiver can do
and the coach likes what he has
seen. Powell finished the day with
eight catches for 76 yards.
"It was nice to get the ball in Luke's
hands today," Teevens said. "We
need to get the ball in Luke's hands as
much as possible this season."
While Powell will provide a fa
miliar jersey lining up on offense,
several players will be suiting up in
unfamiliar places come next fall.
Because of the Cardinal's
depth at quarterback, redshirt
freshman David Lofton was
moved from passer to target and
will likely suit up as a receiver. He
looked surprisingly comfortable
at that position, catching three
passes for 42 yards.
In the backfield, sophomore
linebacker Kris Bonifas has been
permanently moved to fullback.
He scored two touchdowns Satur
day — a one-yard scoring plunge
and a 23-yard pass from Edwards.
The final notable move is junior
Anion Gordon, making the transi
tion from defensive end to defen
sive tackle. The Cardinal's sack
leader last season, Teevens credits
Gordon with adapting quickly to
the interior line.
But even with a young offense
and a matured defense, fans
shouldn't expect a toned-down
Stanford attack in the Cardinal's
Sept. 6 opener with San Jose State.
"Everyone knows that this is an
offensive school and we're going to
put up a lot of points," Powell
promised.
