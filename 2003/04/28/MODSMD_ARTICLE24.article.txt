# Defense comes alive
## 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
When a team plays itself, one
side has to win. Saturday's Cardinal
and White spring game at Stanford
Stadium pitted Stanford football's
offense (Cardinal) against its de
fense (White), and the White squad
emerged victorious.
Stanford's defense was criticized
throughout last season for its inex
perience, and with another season
under its pads, all early signs point
to a defensive renewal on the Farm.
Coach Buddy Teevens returns
eight starters on a defense that held
the Cardinal squad to only four
touchdowns on 18 offensive drives.
The White boasted four quarter
back sacks, a fumble recovery and
three interceptions, including a 49-
yard interception return by redshirt
freshman linebacker Mike Silva.
Still, the defense's dominance
might be a testimony not to their re
markable improvement but to the
fact that they were playing against a
severely depleted Stanford offense.
Stanford's three most consistent of
fensive performers, fullback Casey
Moore, tackle Kwame Harris and
receiver Teyo Johnson were cho
sen in this weekend's NFL Draft
and will suit up on Sundays next
season.
Stanford will feel the loss, espe
cially on the offensive line, where
senior tackle Kirk Chambers is the
only returning starter, joining two
redshirt freshman and a sopho
more on the line.
"Anytime you have a majority of
freshmen on the offensive line

there's going to be some mistakes,"
said senior quarterback Chris
Lewis, who was 7-14 passing for 75
yards, one touchdown and one in
terception.
"They're tough guys and work
so hard. That's going to take them
a long way."
According to Teevens, Lewis'
experience gives him the starting
nod at the end of spring. He suf
fered through a miserable 2002
campaign which saw him sidelined
with an injury for much of the year.
Lewis maintains that the injury to
his throwing shoulder has turned
him into a better quarterback.
"Because of my injury my tech
nique has improved a lot," he said.
"I have to use my body a lot more
— before I was using just my arm."
On Saturday redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards showed that he
plans to give Lewis a run for the
starting spot come next fall. He
took the field at Stanford Stadium
and looked like he belonged —
completing 12 of 19 passes for 122
yards and a touchdown. He made
good reads and crisp passes, show
ing some of the skills that brought
him to Stanford as a top recruit out
of Los Gatos. He seems to have
passed sophomore Kyle Matter —
last year's starter for much of the
season — on the depth chart.
Teevens says that the player that
impressed him most this spring was
senior flanker Luke Powell. Powell
was the Cardinal's top receiver and
a first-team Ail-American punt re
turner in 2001, but was sidelined
