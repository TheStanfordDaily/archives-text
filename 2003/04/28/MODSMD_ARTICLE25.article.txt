# Trouble 'Bruin' for softball in LA
## By LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
### 
It was another heartbreaking
weekend for the No. 16 Stanford
Softball team (35-20, 5-10 Pacific
-10 Conference). The Cardinal lost
two one-run decisions to No. 2
UCLA (39-5, 11-3) after blowing
out No. 4 Washington (39-9-1,6-7)
Friday night.

If playing two of the nation's top
five teams was not a grueling
enough task, the Cardinal had to
handle interstate travel as well.
The road trip started on a high
note for Stanford as Dana
Sorensen continued her domina
tion of the I luskies in an 8-0 victo
ry, cut short by the five-inning run
rule. But the Huskies may take
heart from the thrashing, or at
least relief that they will most likely
not see Sorensen again this year.
Washington and Stanford have
met four times this season, with the
Cardinal taking the season series
three games to one. Quite an ac

complishment after Stanford
failed to take a game from the
Huskies in 2002.
Sorensen has been an unsolv
able puzzle for Washington this
season. In 19 innings of work,
Sorensen has allowed just four hits
and one run, and has taken out 30
Husky batters on strikes. Her most
dominant performance came on
March 30 when Sorensen was just
one walk from perfection against
the Huskies in recording her sec
ond no-hitter of the year.
Friday's win was an opportuni
ty for the Cardinal offense to shine
along with Sorensen.
Stanford posted seven runs
against the Huskies' ace, Ashley
Boek, sending her to just her third
defeat of the season.
The Cardinal was opportunistic
in the top of the first. Freshman
Catalina Morris walked to open
the game, but stood at second with
two outs on the board. Senior Cassi
Brangham kept the inning alive
with a walk, and sophomore Leah
Nelson packed the sacks after
being hit by a pitch from Boek.
Senior Kira Ching began what
would l>e an extraordinarily pro
ductive weekend at the plate with a
bases-clearing double to left field.
Junior Jessica Allister tallied the

Cardinal's fourth run with a
homer to lead off the second.
Stanford chased Boek in the
third after taking further advan
tage of her wildness. Boek loaded
the bases with no outs on a single, a
walk and a hit batter. Tia Bollinger
replaced Boek but could not put
out the fire thanks to unsound de
fense.
Bollinger allowed her first two
batters, Morris and senior Mau
reen LeCocq, to reach on errors,
bringing home the fifth and sixth
runs of the day for Stanford. The
Cardinal would add two more in
the inning on a sacrifice fly by
sophomore Meghan Sickler and a
single by freshman Lauren Lap
pin.
With that generous eight run
cushion in place, Sorensen retired
the final nine Huskies and took ad
vantage of the five-inning run rule
to earn herself an early finish for
the night.
The early finish was welcome, as
the Cardinal had to board a plane
to I .os Angeles to compete in its sec
ond state in as many days.
The sweet taste of Friday's victo
ry would fade quickly for Stanford
as they endured two one-run loss-

es to the Bruins, Sunday's going to
extra innings. The Bruins pushed
across the winning run in their final
at-bat each time.
The defeats were the fifth and
sixth one-run losses Stanford has
suffered to top-10 competition this
season.
The Bruins won by a count of 1-
0 in Saturday's action.
Senior Tori Nyberg was strong
from the circle, allowing just two hits
to the Bruins. But with the game
scoreless in the sixth, the Bruins
turned a two-out walk and double
into the one run they would need to
claim victory.
Stanford scratched out six hits

and two walks off of the Bruins'
Keira Goerl but was never able to
push a runner past second base.
Still, Saturday's heartbreak was
nothing compared to what would
befall the Cardinal on Sunday,
when UCLA claimed a 3-2 victory in
eight innings.
Stanford had the lead in the
game in both the third and the fifth,
but each time relinquished it in the
bottom of the inning.
Ching starred for the Cardinal
at the plate with a 3-4 performance
to cap a weekend that saw her
reach base safely in seven of 10
plate appearances. Allister also
closed out a successful weekend
with her second home run, her
eighth of the season.
The Bruins got stellar perfor
mances from Keira Goerl, who
picked up her second complete

game victory in two days, and
shortstop Natasha Watley, who
banged two home runs off of
Sorensen.
The game moved into extra in
nings with the score tied at two.
Stanford had an excellent
chance to pull ahead in the top of
the eighth after a walk by Nelson
and a single by Ching put runners
on second and third, but Goerl set
tled down and induced two pop
ups to end the threat.
After high drama in the top of
the eighth, the bottom of the eighth
was over quickly. Watley led off the
inning with a home run to center
field that drove the Cardinal out of
Los Angeles winless.
Stanford will return for its final
Pac-10 homestand of the year
against Arizona and Arizona State
next weekend.

homer to lead off the second.
Stanford chased Boek in the
third after taking further advan
tage of her wildness. Boek loaded
the bases with no outs on a single, a
walk and a hit batter. Tia Bollinger
replaced Boek but could not put
out the fire thanks to unsound de
fense.
Bollinger allowed her first two
batters, Morris and senior Mau
reen LeCocq, to reach on errors,
bringing home the fifth and sixth
runs of the day for Stanford. The
Cardinal would add two more in
the inning on a sacrifice fly by
sophomore Meghan Sickler and a
single by freshman Lauren Lap
pin.
With that generous eight run
cushion in place, Sorensen retired
the final nine Huskies and took ad
vantage of the five-inning run rule
to earn herself an early finish for
the night.
The early finish was welcome, as
the Cardinal had to board a plane
to I .os Angeles to compete in its sec
ond state in as many days.
The sweet taste of Friday's victo
ry would fade quickly for Stanford
as they endured two one-run loss-

es to the Bruins, Sunday's going to
extra innings. The Bruins pushed
across the winning run in their final
at-bat each time.
The defeats were the fifth and
sixth one-run losses Stanford has
suffered to top-10 competition this
season.
The Bruins won by a count of 1-
0 in Saturday's action.
Senior Tori Nyberg was strong
from the circle, allowing just two hits
to the Bruins. But with the game
scoreless in the sixth, the Bruins
turned a two-out walk and double
into the one run they would need to
claim victory.
Stanford scratched out six hits

and two walks off of the Bruins'
Keira Goerl but was never able to
push a runner past second base.
Still, Saturday's heartbreak was
nothing compared to what would
befall the Cardinal on Sunday,
when UCLA claimed a 3-2 victory in
eight innings.
Stanford had the lead in the
game in both the third and the fifth,
but each time relinquished it in the
bottom of the inning.
Ching starred for the Cardinal
at the plate with a 3-4 performance
to cap a weekend that saw her
reach base safely in seven of 10
plate appearances. Allister also
closed out a successful weekend
with her second home run, her
eighth of the season.
The Bruins got stellar perfor
mances from Keira Goerl, who
picked up her second complete

game victory in two days, and
shortstop Natasha Watley, who
banged two home runs off of
Sorensen.
The game moved into extra in
nings with the score tied at two.
Stanford had an excellent
chance to pull ahead in the top of
the eighth after a walk by Nelson
and a single by Ching put runners
on second and third, but Goerl set
tled down and induced two pop
ups to end the threat.
After high drama in the top of
the eighth, the bottom of the eighth
was over quickly. Watley led off the
inning with a home run to center
field that drove the Cardinal out of
Los Angeles winless.
Stanford will return for its final
Pac-10 homestand of the year
against Arizona and Arizona State
next weekend.
It was another heartbreaking
weekend for the No. 16 Stanford
Softball team (35-20, 5-10 Pacific
-10 Conference). The Cardinal lost
two one-run decisions to No. 2
UCLA (39-5, 11-3) after blowing
out No. 4 Washington (39-9-1,6-7)
Friday night.

If playing two of the nation's top
five teams was not a grueling
enough task, the Cardinal had to
handle interstate travel as well.
The road trip started on a high
note for Stanford as Dana
Sorensen continued her domina
tion of the I luskies in an 8-0 victo
ry, cut short by the five-inning run
rule. But the Huskies may take
heart from the thrashing, or at
least relief that they will most likely
not see Sorensen again this year.
Washington and Stanford have
met four times this season, with the
Cardinal taking the season series
three games to one. Quite an ac

complishment after Stanford
failed to take a game from the
Huskies in 2002.
Sorensen has been an unsolv
able puzzle for Washington this
season. In 19 innings of work,
Sorensen has allowed just four hits
and one run, and has taken out 30
Husky batters on strikes. Her most
dominant performance came on
March 30 when Sorensen was just
one walk from perfection against
the Huskies in recording her sec
ond no-hitter of the year.
Friday's win was an opportuni
ty for the Cardinal offense to shine
along with Sorensen.
Stanford posted seven runs
against the Huskies' ace, Ashley
Boek, sending her to just her third
defeat of the season.
The Cardinal was opportunistic
in the top of the first. Freshman
Catalina Morris walked to open
the game, but stood at second with
two outs on the board. Senior Cassi
Brangham kept the inning alive
with a walk, and sophomore Leah
Nelson packed the sacks after
being hit by a pitch from Boek.
Senior Kira Ching began what
would l>e an extraordinarily pro
ductive weekend at the plate with a
bases-clearing double to left field.
Junior Jessica Allister tallied the

Cardinal's fourth run with a
homer to lead off the second.
Stanford chased Boek in the
third after taking further advan
tage of her wildness. Boek loaded
the bases with no outs on a single, a
walk and a hit batter. Tia Bollinger
