# Golf tees off at Pac-10 Championships

### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Among other things, the postseason offers a
chance for redemption.
After a season that has seen the Stanford men's
golf team struggle to play up to its potential, the
Cardinal has a chance to truly establish itself with
three days and four rounds of solid golf .
Today, the team begins play at the 44th Pacif
ic-10 Conference Championship. The tourna
ment will be played at the par-72 6,736-yard Oak
mont Country Club in Glendale, Calif, and No.
5 UCLA will host the event.
The teams couldn't ask fora better venue than
Oakmont, which has hosted 10 major profession
al championships and five U.S. Amateur Cham
pionships. In its most recent rankings, Coif Mag
azine ranked Oakmont fifth on its list of the coun
try's 100 best courses.
The field is also one befitting a championship
tournament. The Pac-10 is stacked with some of
the country's best teams, including five in
Golfweek's top 25.
The group is led by the Bruins, by far the
strongest team in the conference this year. UCLA
has come out of nowhere to win an incredible five
team tides, finishing out of the top five only once
all year.
The team stands to lose only one player at sea
son's end and, Golfweek rankings aside, is prob
ably the best and most promising team in the
country.
Right behind UCLA is No. 6 Arizona, which
has three tournament victories to its credit this
year.
The Wildcats are led by a strong group of
underclassmen, including junior Chris
Nallen, who is ranked 15th in the country as
an individual.
Of course, the two-time defending champions
from Southern California will be trying to make it
three in a row at this year's event.
The No. 18 Trojans claimed last year's tide in

dominant fashion, clearing second-place Stan
ford by 15 strokes.
The Cardinal is coming oft'a seventh-place fin
ish at its own tournament, the U.S. Intercolle
giate, but played better than the numbers might
indicate.
Coach Jet} Mitchell said the team had reason

to draw some encouragement from its last out
ing: "We beat Washington State, Pacific and
Long Beach State," Mitchell said. "That will help
us in the bids [for the NCAA West Regional Tour
nament]. It should also give us a pretty good vote
of confidence, too."
Seniors Jim Seki, Ron Won and George
Downing are playing in their final Pac-10 Cham
pionships for the Cardinal.
Seki, who has led the team all year with his
solid play and toughness (he has battled back
pain since nearly the beginning of the year), is the
defending Pac-10 champion.
Seki finished last year's tournament at tour
strokes under par, just one better than USC's
Kevin Stadler.
Won, who has struggled mightily in the Car
dinal's recent events, did not fare quite so well at
last year's championship, finishing in 39th place
overall.
Downing struggled early in the year, but came
on during the spring season to be one of the Car
dinal's more consistent performers. He did not
play with the team in the Pac-10 Championship a
year ago.
Junior Blake Mastalir, who also made the trip
to Oakmont, recorded his best finish of the year
at the championship. His four-round total of 290
was two strokes over par and just six shots behind
Seki's leading pace.
Sophomore Kevin Blue is coming off his best
finish of the year, a 19th-place performance at the
U.S. Intercollegiate.
This week he looks to improve on his fresh
man performance at Pac-10s, when he struggled
to a 53rd-place finish.
The only freshman in the group, Kyle Gentry,
is getting his first taste of postseason competition
this week. He posted his best finish (24th place)
two weeks ago at the ASU Thunderbird Invita
tional.
When play wraps up at Oakmont on Wednes
day, the Cardinal will return home fora week off
before participating in the NCAA West Regional.

Freshman Kyle Gentry drives for Stanford at last
weekend's home tournament. The Cardinal hopes
to turn things around during the postseason as it
squares off against five top-25 teams for the 2003
conference title.
