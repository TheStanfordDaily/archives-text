## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf
team was faced with a difficult task
this weekend. The Cardinal bat
tled tough weather conditions and
an elite field to finish in sixth place
at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championship in Corvallis, Ore.
California swept the tourna
ment, taking top team honors by
five strokes over second-place Ari
zona. Cal's senior Vikki Laing cap
tured a one-stroke victory in the
individual competition.
Stanford finished five shots be
hind Arizona State at the three
day, 54-hole event.
The field, although limited to
the members of the Pac-10, was ex
tremely strong and promised to
showcase some of the country's top
golf talent. The Pac-10 is possibly
the nation's strongest women's
golf conference, and half of the
teams entered the event ranked in
the top 20 by Golfweek magazine.
No. 4 Southern California was
the class of the field, followed
closely by Arizona. Not only were
the Wildcats ranked fifth in the
country at the beginning of play
on Thursday, but the team has
won the Pac-10 Championship the
last three years in a row.
In addition to a host of strong
teams, the Pac-10 boasts some of
the top individuals in the nation as
well. Erica Blasberg, Arizona's
freshman phenom, is the top fe
male golfer in the country. During
the regular season, she claimed a
pair of individual titles, including a
dominating five-stroke victory at
the Stanford/Pepsi Intercollegiate
in the fall.
Charlotte Mayorkas, a sopho
more from UCLA, also looked to
challenge for the individual
crown. The No. 5 female in the
country, she claimed her first tour
nament victory earlier this year,

setting a school record witli a 6-
under-par 66 in her first round.
Such an elite field demanded a
venue equal to the occasion. 1 he
event took place at the pat-72
6,160-yard Trysting Tree Conntry
Club and was hosted by Oregon
State University.
Rated the third best college
course in the west by Golfweek in
1998, Trysting Tree also played
host to last year's men's Pat-10
Championship.
The Cardinal had good reason
to be confident coming into this
week's championship. The team
was coming off a second-place
showing at its home tournament,
the Peg Barnard Collegiate two
weeks ago.
Not only was it the Cardinal's
best finish of the year, but it came
in the most adverse of conditions.
Alter rain halted the first day ol
competition early, the team
played 27 holes the second day in
driving rain, beating many of the
same Pac-10 foes that they faced
in Corvallis.
At the Peg Barnard, three Stan
ford players finished in the top 10
and five of the team's six were in
the top 25 overall. Sophomore
Wendra Liang led the group, fir
ing a 4-over-par 148 for 36 holes,
grinding out her first collegiate
victory.
During the first two rounds at
Corvallis, senior Kim Rowton led
the charge. Playing in her final
conference championship for
Stanford, Rowton has been the
team's most consistent player this
year.
She has four top-10 finishes to
her credit, and took top individual
honors at the Rainbow Invitation
al in Honolulu. After beginning
this year's Pac-10 Championship
with a sizzling even-par 72, Row
ton slipped a bit on the second day,
