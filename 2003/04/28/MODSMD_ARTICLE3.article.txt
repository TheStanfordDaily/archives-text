### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week, the University's Department of
Human Resources and Stanford Dining met with
SEIU union Local 715 to discuss what will happen to
current Bon Appetit Management Company work
ers after Stanford Residential and Dining Services
takes control of the eateries in Tresidder Union on
June 18. The University has said that it plans to allow
workers to re-apply to become directly employed by
Stanford. However, current Tresidder workers,
their union and campus labor activists are advocat
ing that the University find ways to assure these
workers' continued employment at Tresidder.
Dining Services announced on April 1 that it
would be taking over Tresidder food service facilities
from Bon Appetit.
"When we met with the union and union stew
ards, what I said then is that my expectation — my
commitment — is that the Tresidder transition hap
pens as smooth as possible following our contract
and University policy," said Nadeem Siddiqui, exec
utive director of Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises. "My hope is that in the next few weeks
we can meet with Tresidder employees to make the
transition as smooth as possible."
He added, "There's a provision in the current
contract we have with the union. That's the process
that we're going to take."
This provision requires that all who apply to work
directly for Stanford Dining first go through a formal
interview and application process.
Union representative Roxana Rivera said that
they would like the University to find ways to retain
Bon Appetit's Tresidder workers. She said re-hiring
will be the University's decision.
"We'll be considering, for example, asking the
University, to waive certain language around the
posting of positions because we think this is a unique
situation, that recognizing the years of service that
the Tresidder workers have given is of utmost im
portance," she said. "They're not recognizing the
years of service that Tresidder workers have given to
the Stanford community due to the fact that they're
not offering these workers anything that they
wouldn't offer somebody that was applying off the
street."
Because of the short notice and tight job market,
workers have been worried that they won't be able to
find other jobs, said Ana Pulido, a server and union
steward who has been employed by Bon Appetit at
Tresidder for seven years.
"For the past month, we have been distressed, be
cause most of us have families that rely on one job,"
Pulido said. "From this time to [when Bon Appetit
leaves Tresidder on June 18], it doesn't give us that
much time to look for another job if the University
doesn't re-hire people."
The workers had been told by Bon Appetit at the
beginning of the month that Tresidder was being
