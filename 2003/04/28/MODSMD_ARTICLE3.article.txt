# Stanford meets with Tresidder workers' union
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week, the University's Department of
Human Resources and Stanford Dining met with
SEIU union Local 715 to discuss what will happen to
current Bon Appetit Management Company work
ers after Stanford Residential and Dining Services
takes control of the eateries in Tresidder Union on
June 18. The University has said that it plans to allow
workers to re-apply to become directly employed by
Stanford. However, current Tresidder workers,
their union and campus labor activists are advocat
ing that the University find ways to assure these
workers' continued employment at Tresidder.
Dining Services announced on April 1 that it
would be taking over Tresidder food service facilities
from Bon Appetit.
"When we met with the union and union stew
ards, what I said then is that my expectation — my
commitment — is that the Tresidder transition hap
pens as smooth as possible following our contract
and University policy," said Nadeem Siddiqui, exec
utive director of Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises. "My hope is that in the next few weeks
we can meet with Tresidder employees to make the
transition as smooth as possible."
He added, "There's a provision in the current
contract we have with the union. That's the process
that we're going to take."
This provision requires that all who apply to work
directly for Stanford Dining first go through a formal
interview and application process.
Union representative Roxana Rivera said that
they would like the University to find ways to retain
Bon Appetit's Tresidder workers. She said re-hiring
will be the University's decision.
"We'll be considering, for example, asking the
University, to waive certain language around the
posting of positions because we think this is a unique
situation, that recognizing the years of service that
the Tresidder workers have given is of utmost im
portance," she said. "They're not recognizing the
years of service that Tresidder workers have given to
the Stanford community due to the fact that they're
not offering these workers anything that they
wouldn't offer somebody that was applying off the
street."
Because of the short notice and tight job market,
workers have been worried that they won't be able to
find other jobs, said Ana Pulido, a server and union
steward who has been employed by Bon Appetit at
Tresidder for seven years.
"For the past month, we have been distressed, be
cause most of us have families that rely on one job,"
Pulido said. "From this time to [when Bon Appetit
leaves Tresidder on June 18], it doesn't give us that
much time to look for another job if the University
doesn't re-hire people."
The workers had been told by Bon Appetit at the
beginning of the month that Tresidder was being
taken over by Stanford Dining, but
many had been waiting up until
last week's meeting to learn what
the process was going to be for re
hiring.
The Stanford Labor Action
Coalition and the Coalition for
Labor Justice have promised to
stand by the workers and are peti
tioning the University for the
workers' continued employment.
"We are sending out a petition
asking [University] President
[John] Hennessy and Stanford
Dining to give priority to Bon Ap
petit's Tresidder workers in the re
hiring process," said junior Leticia
Ramirez, a coordinator with the
SLAC.
The workers and their union at
Bon Appetit's Tresidder
facilities — which include the
CoHo and Bon Appetit Catering at
Stanford, as well as the main cafe
teria — have had regular battles
with Bon Appetit for higher wages
and benefits since their unioniza
tion in 1995. Negotiations for the
last contract were resolved at the
end of last May, after workers and
student activists spent weeks
protesting for "equal pay for equal
work" with directly hired Stanford
Dining employees.
Last summer, workers com
plained that they had not received
the planned benefits; this dispute
was resolved only last fall after
more negotiations.
The union and Stanford Dining
plan to meet in the coming weeks
to further discuss the re-hiring
