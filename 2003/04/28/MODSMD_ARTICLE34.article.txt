Two proved to be greater than
one this weekend tor the No. 3 Stan
ford (21-3, 7-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) men's tennis team at the Pac
-10 Individual Championships in
Ojai, Calif.
The Cardinal enjoyed moderate
success in singles, but advanced one
doubles pair to the finals of the tour
nament's championship flight and
won the invitational flight.
"It was a good week for us," asso
ciate head coach John Whitlinger
said. "Six of our seven guys won
their first-round matches. We got a
lot of matches and we stayed
healthy, both of which we wanted.
"Our doubles has come a long
way in the last few weeks. Last
weekend against UCLA and USC
we played great in doubles, and
now to get teams to the finals here
is outstanding."
Stanford's No. 2 tandem of fresh
men KC Corker) and James Pade
breezed to the final of the champi
onship flight, earning the right to
compete for an automatic bid to the
NCAA Doubles Championships in
Athens, Ga.
"Coming into this tournament,
they didn't have much of a chance
to qualify' for NCAAs," associate
head coach John Whitlinger said.
"They came so close."
Despite being unseeded, Cork
ery and Pade steamrolled their way
into the finals with 8-3, 8-4 and 8-4
victories over teams from Washing
ton, Arizona State and Arizona. In
the finals, they fell to Southern Cali
fornia's Parker Collins and Daniel
Langre 8-3. The pair had won nine
matches in a row dating back to
April 8 before the finals loss.
Senior All-Americans Scott Lip
sky and David Martin, the No. 2
ranked team in the nation, were
upset in the quarterfinals. They lost
9-7 to Arizona State's Olivier Char
roin and Chris Stewart.
"We served for the match at 7-6, so
it was disappointing," lipsky said.
"But the positive thing that came out
of it was that KC and James had a
chance to win the tournament."
The Cardinal's No. 3 duo of
sophomore Sam Warburg and ju
nior Carter Morris took home the
tide in the invitational flight. The
pair received a bye in the first round
then posted 8-6 and 8-3 victories to
advance to the final. Warburg and
Morris took die title with an 8-5 vic
tory over California's Or Dekel and
Robert Kowalcyzk.
In singles, all four Cardinal en
trants in the championship flight
advanced to the second round with
straight-set victories.
Warburg and Pade bowed out in
the second round to Washington's

lop two players. Warburg lost 6-4,6-
1 to No. 18 .Alex Ylaski and Pade lost
6-4,7-5 to No. 27 Matt Hanlin.
Lipsky and Martin reached the
quarterfinals and semifinals, re
spectively.
Lipsky put together two solid
straight-set wins over Washington's
Dillon Ruby and Dekel in the Hrst
two rounds, setting up a rematch
with UCLA's Martin Matkowski. In
Stanford's 4-3 win over the Bruins
last week, Matkowski narrowly beat
Lipsky 3-6,6-3,6-4. Matkowski won
easily this time, 6-2,6-0.
"He was playing really well, just
not missing much," Lipsky said. "I
wasn't that sharp. I was making too
many errors and I just couldn't
hang in with him."
Martin had a tougher time get
ting through to the quarterfinals.
After a routine victory over USC's
Scott Paterson, he took on Cal's
Kowalcyzk, a senior who has had
tremendous success against Cardi
nal players in his career. Kowalcyzk
won the first set 6-3, but Martin bat

tied back and squeezed out a 6-2, 7-
5 victory.
"It was very high quality tennis,"
Whitlinger said. "The match could
have gone either way. Dave was feel
ing sluggish, but he kept fighting
and fighting. It was a great effort for
him to turn it around after losing
the first set."
In the quarterfinals, Martin took
down UCLA's Chris 6-3, 7-5.
Martin's run ended in his next
match when he lost 6-2, 6-4 to Vlas
ki, the tournament's eventual run
ner-up to Matkowski.
"Bottom line, Vlaski played
great," Whitlinger said. "He was
dominating. His serve was good
and his forehand was huge. Dave
didn't play badly, Vlaski just won
that match."
In the invitational flight of the
singles, sophomore Phil Sheng was
the only Cardinal player to advance
to the quarterfinals. After picking
up wins over Oregon's Aaron
Spencer and USC's Collins, lie lost
to Cal's Mik Levanova 6-3, 6-2.
