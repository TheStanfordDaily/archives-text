# Women's shots fall long in Ojai
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team earned some valuable
match experience this weekend in
preparation for the NCA\Tourna
ment at the Pacific-10 Individual
Championships in Ojai, Calif.
In a very short turnaround, the
No. 2 Cardinal (20-1, 8-0 Pac-10)
departed for Ojai just one day after
securing its 16th-straight Pac-10
Conference Championship win
with its defeat of rival California last
Tuesday.
The most productive perfor
mance of the weekend was turned in
by freshman Joanna Kao, who
thrived in singles, reaching the semi
finals of the invitational bracket .
Kao defeated both Kate Jolson
of UCLA, 7-6, 6-2 and Erin Hoe of
Washington, 0-6, 6-1, 7-6 (8) on
Thursday to advance to the quar
terfinals of the singles tournament.
On Friday, Kao earned a trip to the
semifinals when her opponent,
Nora Cail of Washington State, de
faulted due to illness.
In the semifinals, Kao fell to a
tough Nicole Havlicek, who played
at N0.6 singles sporadically for Cali
fornia this year, 6-1, 6-2. Nonethe
less, the performance was impressive
and a very good sign for the Kao.
Although she saw limited action
in dual match play this season, this
experience will likely aid Kao in her
upcoming seasons on the Farm.
"This tournament will definitely
help my development as a player,"
Kao said. "As a non-starter on the
team, my source of learning is
mainly from practicing with my
teammates and watching how they

beat other great players.
"But, this past weekend, 1 got a
small taste of what they experience
during the season, and it is a huge
difference between watching and
playing."
Other Stanford competitors
over the weekend included fresh
men Jessica Leek, Alice Barnes and
sophomores Kara Guzman, Story
Tweedie-Yates and Erin Burdette.
All the Stanford players entered
in the main draw of the singles com
petition won their first-round
matches.
No. 8 Barnes beat Debbie
Larocque of Arizona, 6-3,6-0, while
Burdette defeated Orsi Sallai of
Washington State, 6-3,6-4. Tweed
ie-Yates won a marathon victory
over Lorena Arias of Washington
State, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4.
Barnes then advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 7-5, 6-0 win
over Anita Loyola of Southern Cal
ifornia. She was joined by Burdette,
who was a 6-0,6-4, winner over Dea
Sumantri of Washington. Tweedie-
Yates fell to No. 20 Daria Panova in
her second-round match.
Stanford was eliminated from
the championship flight on Friday
when No. 5 Emilie Scribot of Ari
zona knocked Burdette from the
tournament. Barnes lost her first
Pac-10 singles match of the year
when she retired in the first set of
her match against No. 7 Raquel
Kops-Jones of California.
Panova won the tournament
with a 7-6 (6), 6-2 defeat of the pow
erful Kops-Jones on Sunday.
The remaining three Cardinal
competitors took part in the invita
tional flight of the tournament.
Leek fell in the first round of singles

competition, 6-3, 6-1, to Jody
Scheldt of California. Guzman
gained a first-round bye but
dropped a 6-2,6-2 decision to Nina
Yaftali of UCIA in her second
round match.
In an all-Cal singles final,
Scheldt beat Havlicek, 6-4,6-2.
Although Stanford did not cap
ture any titles over the weekend,
the experience will prove very valu
able, especially for the freshmen
who have not seen much action
during the regular season.
"I've learned so much this past
weekend, such as things about my
own game, what I need to work on
over the summer to improve, how
to handle pressure situations, and
how to compete with better oppo
nents," Kao said. "I just hope that I
can build from this experience and
use it as a stepping stone to become
a better player."
The tournament was strictly an
individual affair, as it has no effect
on the team standings or team
championships.
After a hectic end to the Pac-10
regular season, Stanford will now
have roughly two weeks to rest and
prepare for the NCAA tournament,
which will begin on Friday, May 9 at
regional locations. The brackets will
be announced this Wednesday on
ESPN News.
The tournament cannot come
soon enough for the Cardinal, how
ever, as it is anxious to defend its na
tional championship.
"The team is very focused on
and aiming for the NCAAs," Kao
said. "Everybody is entirely focused
to prepare in whatever is the best
way for them, so that we can domi
nate and win."

Sophomore Storey Tweedie-Yates follows through on a serve earlier this season. Yates won a three-set marathon in
her first championship flight match, but was eliminated in the second round of the Pac-10 Individual Championships.
The No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team earned some valuable
match experience this weekend in
preparation for the NCA\Tourna
ment at the Pacific-10 Individual
Championships in Ojai, Calif.
In a very short turnaround, the
No. 2 Cardinal (20-1, 8-0 Pac-10)
departed for Ojai just one day after
securing its 16th-straight Pac-10
Conference Championship win
with its defeat of rival California last
Tuesday.
The most productive perfor
mance of the weekend was turned in
by freshman Joanna Kao, who
thrived in singles, reaching the semi
finals of the invitational bracket .
Kao defeated both Kate Jolson
of UCLA, 7-6, 6-2 and Erin Hoe of
Washington, 0-6, 6-1, 7-6 (8) on
Thursday to advance to the quar
terfinals of the singles tournament.
On Friday, Kao earned a trip to the
semifinals when her opponent,
Nora Cail of Washington State, de
faulted due to illness.
In the semifinals, Kao fell to a
tough Nicole Havlicek, who played
at N0.6 singles sporadically for Cali
fornia this year, 6-1, 6-2. Nonethe
less, the performance was impressive
and a very good sign for the Kao.
Although she saw limited action
in dual match play this season, this
experience will likely aid Kao in her
upcoming seasons on the Farm.
"This tournament will definitely
help my development as a player,"
Kao said. "As a non-starter on the
team, my source of learning is
mainly from practicing with my
teammates and watching how they

beat other great players.
"But, this past weekend, 1 got a
small taste of what they experience
during the season, and it is a huge
difference between watching and
playing."
Other Stanford competitors
over the weekend included fresh
men Jessica Leek, Alice Barnes and
sophomores Kara Guzman, Story
Tweedie-Yates and Erin Burdette.
All the Stanford players entered
in the main draw of the singles com
petition won their first-round
matches.
No. 8 Barnes beat Debbie
Larocque of Arizona, 6-3,6-0, while
Burdette defeated Orsi Sallai of
Washington State, 6-3,6-4. Tweed
ie-Yates won a marathon victory
over Lorena Arias of Washington
State, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4.
Barnes then advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 7-5, 6-0 win
over Anita Loyola of Southern Cal
ifornia. She was joined by Burdette,
who was a 6-0,6-4, winner over Dea
Sumantri of Washington. Tweedie-
Yates fell to No. 20 Daria Panova in
her second-round match.
Stanford was eliminated from
the championship flight on Friday
when No. 5 Emilie Scribot of Ari
zona knocked Burdette from the
tournament. Barnes lost her first
Pac-10 singles match of the year
when she retired in the first set of
her match against No. 7 Raquel
Kops-Jones of California.
Panova won the tournament
with a 7-6 (6), 6-2 defeat of the pow
erful Kops-Jones on Sunday.
The remaining three Cardinal
competitors took part in the invita
tional flight of the tournament.
Leek fell in the first round of singles

competition, 6-3, 6-1, to Jody
Scheldt of California. Guzman
gained a first-round bye but
dropped a 6-2,6-2 decision to Nina
Yaftali of UCIA in her second
round match.
In an all-Cal singles final,
Scheldt beat Havlicek, 6-4,6-2.
Although Stanford did not cap
ture any titles over the weekend,
the experience will prove very valu
able, especially for the freshmen
who have not seen much action
during the regular season.
"I've learned so much this past
weekend, such as things about my
own game, what I need to work on
over the summer to improve, how
to handle pressure situations, and
how to compete with better oppo
nents," Kao said. "I just hope that I
can build from this experience and
use it as a stepping stone to become
a better player."
The tournament was strictly an
individual affair, as it has no effect
on the team standings or team
championships.
After a hectic end to the Pac-10
regular season, Stanford will now
have roughly two weeks to rest and
prepare for the NCAA tournament,
which will begin on Friday, May 9 at
regional locations. The brackets will
be announced this Wednesday on
ESPN News.
The tournament cannot come
soon enough for the Cardinal, how
ever, as it is anxious to defend its na
tional championship.
"The team is very focused on
and aiming for the NCAAs," Kao
said. "Everybody is entirely focused
to prepare in whatever is the best
way for them, so that we can domi
nate and win."
