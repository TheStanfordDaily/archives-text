# Former governor talks to Republican Jewish voters
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former California governor Pete Wilson
was introduced to a crowd of 100 Bay Area
Republican Jewish Coalition members yes
terday with a simple sentence: "Welcome to
the vast right-wing conspiracy."
Coalition President Debra England's
tongue-in-cheek words brought laughter
and applause from the audience.
Following England's remarks, Wilson spoke
on topics as diverse as welfare reform, the state
budget and improving education — all the
while linking these issues to his plan fora revi
talization of the Republican Party in California.
When die top of the ticket has done well," he
said, "we have done well down-ticket. In 1994
we presented the image of a unified party."
Wilson, replete with .American flag cuf
flinks, displayed a refined sense of humor
and quick wit as he opened his speech with
stories from his time in office.
"I wish that I were back in the governor's
chair," he said. "But there's a little thing
called term limits." He paused, then said,
"Seemed like a good idea at the time."
Wilson discussed t he idea of recalling Gov

ernor Gray Davis, a Democrat, but also ad
mitted that the possibility of a successful recall
would be incredibly small.
"Ever)' governor since Earl Warren has
been the subject of a recall," he said. "Typically
they don't make it to die ballot." Nonetheless,
lie urged the Republican Party to field a strong
candidate in the event of a recall election.
"Schwarzenegger is very attractive, he has
110 percent name recognition," Wilson said in
reference to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who has indicated interest in running for gov
ernor. "But is he ready to do it?" Wilson asked.
"It is unlikely that we will be required to field a
candidate, but we have to think about it."
Education formed the centerpiece of his
criticism of the state.
"We have allowed the public school system
to deteriorate into something that is a dis
grace," he said. He argued that education im
provement should be the foremost goal of the
future leaders of California.
The discussion soon turned to talk of the war.
"I drive around here and see 'War is not
the answer' bumper stickers," Wilson said.
"War was the answer."

Former California Governor Pete Wilson speaks to members of the Bay Area
Republican Jewish Coalition about topics ranging from education to the war
in Iraq.
He also had harsh words for the
Shiite clerics in Iraq that oppose a
U.S.-led reconstruction effort.
These clerics, he said, are con
trolled by the mullahs in Iran.
"The idea that we leave in two
months so that they can establish a
theocracy, Tehran-style — to hell
with that," he said.
The event took place in a backyard
garden at the Palo Alto home of Abra
ham Sofaer, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution. He and others
hoped to use the gathering as a re
cruiting tool for the coalition.
"We'll look back on this event,"
Sofaer said, "and think this is the
turning point in Jewish involve
ment in the Republican Party.
"The principles that Jewish-
Americans believe in — namely law

and order, fairness, equity, non-dis
crimination — have gradually led to
the sense that Jewish people can be
Republican, even in California," he
said. "Pete Wilson is a classic example
of the kind of Republican that Jewish
voters would be comfortable with."
A light brunch preceded Wil
son's speech. Certain words and
phrases floated through the air over
and over, words like "Condi Rice,"
"liberal academia" and "terrorism."
"There's a conformity of
thought that's taken hold of the so
cial sciences in American universi
ties that's frightening," said Paul
Sanderson, a community member.
Upon meeting a student from
Stanford, another attendee, Pnina
Rothenberg, said, "Can you do
something to make [History Prof.]
Joel Beinin disappear?"
Most of those present were mem
bers of the Bay Area community at
large, although several Stanford stu
dents and staff attended as well.
