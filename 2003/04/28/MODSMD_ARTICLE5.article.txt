# Ohio congressman rails at Bush policies

### ERICA O'YOUNG 
Rep. Dennis Kucinich (L)-Ohio),
a 2004 Democratic presidential can
didate, stipulated Friday the need
for the United States to shake off its
unilateralist world view and "rejoin
the world community."
In a speech organized by the
Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice and the Stanford Democrats,
Kucinich spoke to about 200 mem
bers of the Stanford community
gathered in Annenberg Auditori
um. Warning that the wave of fear
following Sept. 11 has been misused
by the government to cloud the vi
sion of the American people, he told
the crowd, "We have created the
world of our nightmares when we
could have created the world of our
dreams."
Kucinich attributed the United
States' self-separation to "fear, de
sire for control, an inquisitiveness
that covers oil, water" and"a desire
for power." These, Kucinich said,
are primary motives behind Bush
administration measures, such as
the Nuclear Posture Review.

The review, released in January,
attempted to formulate a post-Cold
War nuclear strategy for the United
States. Public concern, however, has
been that the review's call for an in
creased commitment to reinforcing
nuclear strength will lead to a uni
lateralist U.S. nuclear policy that vi
olates the internationally-accepted,
long-standing Nuclear Non-Prolif
eration Treaty.
"When we look at our nuclear
policy, we need to think about the
implications for the world,"
Kucinich emphasized, warning that
the "beginning of dichotomized
thinking of'us'vs. 'them' " may lead
to "real conflict with the ability for
devastating effect."
Kucinich singled out the passing
of the 2001 USA Patriot Act as an il
lustration ofthe current administra
tion's imprudent decision-making.
" Fear is disempowering," he cau
tioned, pointing to the act's six-week
rush through Congress, which cap
italized on the anthrax scare. The
Act, which has provisions including
detention without trial for non-citi
zen terror suspects, surveillance of

electronic messages and the exten
sion of foreign CIA intelligence
gathering operations, was passed
on Oct. 29, a month and a half after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Kucinich also reinforced his anti
war stance, highlighting U.S. unilat
eralist tendencies as a dangerous
catalyst for escalating circumstances.
