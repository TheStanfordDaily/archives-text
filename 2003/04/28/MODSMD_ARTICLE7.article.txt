### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
After 33 years of service to
the Stanford community, Cul
tural and Social Anthropology
Prof. Renato I. Rosaldo, Jr. will
leave the University at the end
of this quarter. In honor of his
departure and in celebration of
his work, El Centro Chicano
and the Chicana/o Studies Pro
gram, in conjunction with vari
ous University departments,
held a day-long tribute to Rosal
do on Saturday.
Saturday's events included
two panels, which were in ques
tion-and-answer format, and an
evening of spoken word, dance,
poetry and music featuring Los
Decanos, El Ballet Folklorico
and individuals who shared
their art at C.asa Zapata.

The first panel was entitled
"Platica — Between Tight
Spaces: The Intersections of
Scholarship and Creative
Work" and highlighted four of
Rosaldo's current or former
advisees. The students reflect
ed lx)th on Rosaldo's influence
in their lives and on the "pro
ductive influences and ten
sions between scholarship and
creative work that [they] have
found," according to their re
sponses to panelist leaders'
questions.
The students lx>th spoke and
performed to illustrate their re
sponses, creating a "really mov
ing experience," in the words of
Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano, di
rector of Chicana/o studies at
Stanford.
Gabriela Rico, a senior, intro
duced Rosaldo, indicating that his
work has deeply touched many.
"A dedicated member and ser
vant of the Stanford Chicana/o
Latina/o community, Renato has
opened up the historically exclu
sive, white walls of academia to
Chicana/o students who other
wise would have never seen
themselves reflected in a book, in
a classroom, in a lecture, on a
campus," Rico said. "Renato has
kept his heart where it belongs —
in the hands of his comunidad
whose concerns mold and shape
his beliefs in 'justicia social.' It is
because he is not just an academ
ic, but an intellectual, artist and
community advocate that Rena
to's dynamic presence will be ir
replaceable."
A world-renowned anthropolo
gist and respected Chicano scholar,
Rosaldo has served as a Lucie Stern
Professor in the Social Sciences in
the Department of Cultural and So
cial Anthropology. He has taught
both graduate and undergraduate
level courses in anthropology, cul
tural studies, cultural citizenship
and Chicana/o Studies. Rosaldo has
published numerous books and ar
ticles, has served as president of the
American Ethnological Society, di
rector of the Stanford Center for
Chicano Research and chair of the
Department of Anthropology, as
well as being a member of the Amer
ican Academy of .Arts and Sciences.
The second panel, titled "Plan
ning for the Future: Chicana/o
Studies Scholars Reflect on Past,

Present, and Future Research Di
rections," featured four leaders in
the field of Chicana/o academia
who briefly outlined their hopes
for the paths that Chicana/o stud
ies will take in the near future.
Points mentioned included the
need fora balance between cultural
studies — which is currently em
phasized with public policy issues,
the urgency of developing studies
regarding Chicana/o sexuality and
"lesbigay conflicts," and the impera
tive to find relevancy within the
larger community.
"We've become complacent, and
this complacency is very danger
ous," said Adela de la Torre, direc
tor of Chicana/o studies at UC-

Davis. "We're creating an elite of
[Chicana/o] intellectuals and leav
ing behind the rest. We fail to be ef
fective when we no longer are rele
vant to our base, and our base is
wider than our students. We have a
broader mission, beyond just stu
dents we must represent the whole
community."
Rosaldo will be teaching at New
York University while also working
on his writing after his departure
from Stanford. A "Renato Rosaldo
Award" has been created in his
honor to recognize students that are
"carrying out that which Rosaldo's
work has done," according to Maria
Medina, publicity coordinator at El
Centro Chicano.
