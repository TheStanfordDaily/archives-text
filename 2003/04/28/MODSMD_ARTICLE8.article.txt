# Class of 2007 visits the Farm
## Stanford's most diverse class explores campus during 2003 Admit Weekend 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Armed with name tags and conspicuous red
folders, prospective freshmen flocked to the Stan
ford campus this weekend for the University's an
nual Admit Weekend. The Class of 2007, high
lighted as the most diverse admitted class in Stan
ford history, attended a flurry of workshops, open
houses, dorm events and other activities.
"We hope they get all the information they
need to make a decision that will be best for them,
to choose a school that they will feel the most com
fortable with," said Gabriel Lazarin, director of
Admit Weekend 2003.
"Even if you know that you are coming here al
ready, there is a lot to gain," he added. "You get
to know your classmates a lot earlier and you start
to become part of the Stanford community, learn
more about the University, meet faculty and learn
about many different programs."
Prospective freshmen — known almost exclu
sively as 'profros' — expressed their appreciation
for the efforts of the event coordinators to appeal
to student interest.
"Everyone was really energetic," said profro
Tom Richardson. "I sat in on an art history class
and I recognized stuff I had studied in high school
but it was far more in-depth and intellectual. The
professor was great."
In addition to the opportunity to audit classes,
Admit Weekend offered a variety of student and
faculty panels, information sessions — and of
course, parties. Profros emphasized their interest
in faculty as an aspect of the University that they
did not have the chance to experience before they
came to the Farm as admits.
"The coolest guy on campus was Gerhard
Casper, the funniest man alive," said Bharat Ven
ket, a profro from Racine, Wis. "The neat thing
was he kept saying, 'Don't worry about it, just take
what you want and have fun,' and that's always
good to hear from the ex-president of Stanford."
According to Lazarin, many faculty members
are equally enthusiastic about making contact
with prospective students.
"YVe send out invitations to participate in acad
emic expos early in the year since it's sometimes
difficult to get on professors' schedules," he said.
"A lot of professors are readily enthusiastic, and
some of them even participated in two or three
events during the weekend."
While the coordination staff
concentrated many of the events
on Thursday and Friday, Satur
day was left relatively open for in
coming students to become ac
quainted with one another and to
familiarize themselves with the
campus social scene.
"It's really cool to get to know
the people we're spending the
next four years with," said pro
fro Suzy Tollerud, from Philadel
phia, Pa. "I just met someone
who is actually leaving early to go
home and compete in a statewide
speech competition, and it just
seems that everyone here has
done so many amazing things."
By Saturday evening, several
students agreed that their perspec
tives of Stanford had changed after
living in the dorms and gaining
first-hand experience.
"I had this image in my head of

sunny California, making tons of
new friends, and 1 don't
know . . . finding love," Venket
said. "But you come here and
you're still the same person. The
world hasn't changed in three days.
"In high school, I felt like the big
fish in the small pond, and now I
totally realize I'm a small fish in a
very big pond," he added. "In fact,
I think I'm more afraid now,"
Tollerud concurred that her
perception of Stanford had been
altered the moment she stepped
on campus.
"I think the last time we were
all here is when we were visiting
before we actually applied, and
the campus is generally empty
over the summer," she said. "Now
the first thing you see when you
arrive is hundreds of bikes every
where and you think to yourself,
'Whoa there are actually people
here.'"
Some prospective students saw
living in the dorms as an opportu
nity to meet current students who
provided them with a clearer un
derstanding of students' day-to

day experience.
"I met a lot of people who go
here now, and I feel less intimidat
ed," said profro Caldwell
from Grass Valley, Calif. "1 realize
I can't expect to take the world by
storm here, but at the same time
the people I met are very real, and
I like that a lot."
Profro Matt Janes from Med
ford, Ore. said, "My perspective
did change, in that I now officially
care less about high school than I
even did before — and to think I
still have to take my AP Calculus
BC test."
Many potential members of the
Class of 2007 had only positive re
marks about the University in gen
eral, and said that they had already
decided to attend Stanford this
fall.
"From my end, the weekend
went really smoothly, which is the
most we can really hope for,"
Lazarin said. "In talking to stu
dents and parents, looking at the
people walking around, we got the
sense that people had a really good
time."

ford campus this weekend for the University's an
nual Admit Weekend. The Class of 2007, high
lighted as the most diverse admitted class in Stan
ford history, attended a flurry of workshops, open
houses, dorm events and other activities.
"We hope they get all the information they
need to make a decision that will be best for them,
to choose a school that they will feel the most com
fortable with," said Gabriel Lazarin, director of
Admit Weekend 2003.
"Even if you know that you are coming here al
ready, there is a lot to gain," he added. "You get
to know your classmates a lot earlier and you start
to become part of the Stanford community, learn
more about the University, meet faculty and learn
about many different programs."
Prospective freshmen — known almost exclu
sively as 'profros' — expressed their appreciation
for the efforts of the event coordinators to appeal
to student interest.
"Everyone was really energetic," said profro
Tom Richardson. "I sat in on an art history class
and I recognized stuff I had studied in high school
but it was far more in-depth and intellectual. The
professor was great."
In addition to the opportunity to audit classes,
Admit Weekend offered a variety of student and
faculty panels, information sessions — and of
course, parties. Profros emphasized their interest
in faculty as an aspect of the University that they
did not have the chance to experience before they
came to the Farm as admits.
"The coolest guy on campus was Gerhard
Casper, the funniest man alive," said Bharat Ven
ket, a profro from Racine, Wis. "The neat thing
was he kept saying, 'Don't worry about it, just take
what you want and have fun,' and that's always
good to hear from the ex-president of Stanford."
According to Lazarin, many faculty members
are equally enthusiastic about making contact
with prospective students.
"YVe send out invitations to participate in acad
emic expos early in the year since it's sometimes
difficult to get on professors' schedules," he said.
"A lot of professors are readily enthusiastic, and
some of them even participated in two or three
events during the weekend."
While the coordination staff
concentrated many of the events
on Thursday and Friday, Satur
day was left relatively open for in
coming students to become ac
quainted with one another and to
familiarize themselves with the
campus social scene.
"It's really cool to get to know
the people we're spending the
next four years with," said pro
fro Suzy Tollerud, from Philadel
phia, Pa. "I just met someone
who is actually leaving early to go
home and compete in a statewide
speech competition, and it just
seems that everyone here has
done so many amazing things."
By Saturday evening, several
students agreed that their perspec
tives of Stanford had changed after
living in the dorms and gaining
first-hand experience.
"I had this image in my head of

sunny California, making tons of
new friends, and 1 don't
know . . . finding love," Venket
said. "But you come here and
you're still the same person. The
world hasn't changed in three days.
"In high school, I felt like the big
fish in the small pond, and now I
totally realize I'm a small fish in a
very big pond," he added. "In fact,
I think I'm more afraid now,"
Tollerud concurred that her
perception of Stanford had been
altered the moment she stepped
on campus.
"I think the last time we were
all here is when we were visiting
before we actually applied, and
the campus is generally empty
over the summer," she said. "Now
the first thing you see when you
arrive is hundreds of bikes every
where and you think to yourself,
'Whoa there are actually people
here.'"
Some prospective students saw
living in the dorms as an opportu
nity to meet current students who
provided them with a clearer un
derstanding of students' day-to

day experience.
"I met a lot of people who go
here now, and I feel less intimidat
ed," said profro Caldwell
from Grass Valley, Calif. "1 realize
I can't expect to take the world by
storm here, but at the same time
the people I met are very real, and
I like that a lot."
Profro Matt Janes from Med
ford, Ore. said, "My perspective
did change, in that I now officially
care less about high school than I
even did before — and to think I
still have to take my AP Calculus
BC test."
Many potential members of the
Class of 2007 had only positive re
marks about the University in gen
eral, and said that they had already
decided to attend Stanford this
fall.
"From my end, the weekend
went really smoothly, which is the
most we can really hope for,"
Lazarin said. "In talking to stu
dents and parents, looking at the
people walking around, we got the
sense that people had a really good
time."

At Friday's Activities Fair, student organizations encourage prospective freshmen to join them next year when they
come to the Farm as students. In addition to the Activities Fair, admitted students audited classes and went to parties.
