# Class of 2007 visits the Farm
## Stanford's most diverse class explores campus during 2003 Admit Weekend 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Armed with name tags and conspicuous red
folders, prospective freshmen flocked to the Stan
ford campus this weekend for the University's an
nual Admit Weekend. The Class of 2007, high
lighted as the most diverse admitted class in Stan
ford history, attended a flurry of workshops, open
houses, dorm events and other activities.
"We hope they get all the information they
need to make a decision that will be best for them,

did not have the chance to experience before they
came to the Farm as admits.
"The coolest guy on campus was Gerhard
Casper, the funniest man alive," said Bharat Ven
ket, a profro from Racine, Wis. "The neat thing
was he kept saying, 'Don't worry about it, just take
what you want and have fun,' and that's always
good to hear from the ex-president of Stanford."
According to Lazarin, many faculty members
are equally enthusiastic about making contact
with prospective students.
"YVe send out invitations to participate in acad
emic expos early in the year since it's sometimes
difficult to get on professors' schedules," he said.
"A lot of professors are readily enthusiastic, and
