## Leaders to hold meeting in Iraq 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Delegates from inside
and outside Iraq agreed yesterday to hold a nation
building meeting next month and fashion a tempo
rary, post-Saddam Hussein government that the
United States predicted could be in place within days
after that.
Iraq's new American administrators, charting the
future of the land they invaded, secured the pledge to
meet again in May from a multiethnic assortment of
delegates. It represents the first specific timetable for
trying to assemble the foundations of democracy in
postwar Iraq and a more secure tomorrow.
"I think we have enough to come up with a road
map," said U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, adding that
an administration could be in place within weeks.
Yesterday's daylong conference coincided with a
date that had been a national holiday: It was Saddam
Hussein's 66th birthday.
"Today, on the birthday of Saddam Hussein, let us
start the democratic process for the children of Iraq,"
the U.S. civil administrator for Iraq, retired Lt. Gen.
Jay Garner, told delegates.
The conference brought together Shiite and Surini
Muslim clerics in robes, Kurds from the north, tribal
chiefs in Arab headdresses and Westernized exiles in
expensive suits. Still, some said Shiites, who make up
60 percent of Iraq's population, were underrepre
sented, and delegates generally agreed on a need for
wider representation in the future.
"This is the start of democracy," delegate Hatem
Mokhless said. "Discussions were serious and deep. It
is a long and difficult road but we shall cross it."
Washington invited U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to send an observer, but he declined. He did
so because the role of the United Nations in post-war
Iraq hasn't been defined, said Mexico's U.N. Ambas
sador Alfonso Aguilar Zinser, the current Security
Council president.
The United States wants the U.N. role in Iraq limit
ed to providing experts to help reconstruction and to
endorse the U.S.-organized administration. Many

council members, however, want the world body to play
an active part in putting the new government together.
For Iraq, a nation riven by a generation of auto
cratic rule, the notion of a broad leadership council
appeared to gain ground, with many delegates en
dorsing it as the best path.
"We hope we can form a unified government, one
that reflects the entire spectrum of Iraq," said Ahmad
Jaber al-Awadi, a representative of the newly formed
Iraqi Independent Democrats Movement.
Under Saddam, the all-powerful Baath Party
barred dissent and effectively banned competing par
ties. Yesterday's meeting, like one in the ancient city of
Ur earlier this month, pulled aside that monolithic fa
cade to reveal a fractious land with political agendas.
