# Fund-raising inquiry dismissed

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In their first inquiry
under the new fund-raising law, federal regula
tors punished neither the Democratic nor Repub
lican party organizations over allegations they
were trying to evade the ban on corporate and
union donations.
Following a preliminary inquiry, the Federal
Election Commission announced yesterday that it
would not act further on a complaint that accused
the two major parties of creating groups to contin
ue collecting "soft money" despite a prohibition
that tookelfect last November.
Members of the FEC offered dilferent conclu
sions on the outcome. All the regulatory commis
sion could agree was that a letter of admonishment
be sent to a Republican committee.
A complaint filed last November by four cam
paign finance watchdog groups accused the Na
tional Republican Congressional Committee and
the Democratic National Committee of trying to
skirt the ban on the raising of soft money by na
tional parties.
The complaint said the NRCC set up a group
called The Leadership Forum, and the Democratic

National Committee and its chairman, Ferry
McAulifFe, established the Democratic State Parties
Organization to get around the new law.
All those named in the complaint denied wrong
doing, including the NRCC and DNC, who said
they had no connection to the new groups.
The NRCC transferred $1 million to The Lead
ership Forum shortly before the law took effect
Nov. (j. l he forum gave the money back to the Re
publican committee after the watchdog groups
filed their complaint, and the NRCC then refund
ed the money to donors.
In a 4-1 vote earlier this month, the commission
ruled that the NRCC shouldn't have taken the
money back because national party committees
weren't supposed to accept soft money after the law
had taken effect.
It decided against taking any action beyond a let
ter of admonishment, however, because the money
was subsequently returned to its donors. Commis
sioner Ellen Weintraub didn't vote on the matter.
In a 4-2 decision, the commission concluded that
none of the other groups named in the complaint
had broken the law.
