# Plan proposed for hydrogen energy

### 
PARIS (AP) — The world's top
economies should pool resources
to develop hydrogen energy tech
nology, limiting dependence on
fossil fuels, the U.S. secretary of en
ergy said yesterday.
Spencer Abraham proposed an
international partnership for hy
drogen energy at the Internation
al Energy Agency, which began a
meeting in Paris yesterday.
"By working together we can
dramatically speed the day when
everyone can buy a competitively
priced hydrogen-powered vehi
cle," Abraham told reporters.

Abraham said countries could
cooperate to develop technology,
set safety and other standards, find
ways of producing and storing hy
drogen and otherwise prepare for
a future "hydrogen economy."
1 he United States plans to spend
about $1.7 billion over the next live
years on hydrogen development,
and Abraham said the European
Union has committed up to $2 bil
lion for research into hydrogen and
other renewable energy sources.
He said the aim was to put com
petitively priced hydrogen carson
the market by 2020.

1 lydrogen fuel cell automobiles
run on electricity from a chemical
reaction between oxygen and hy
drogen and only emit clean water
from the tailpipe rather than pol
luting exhaust.
The meeting also will focus on
security of the world energy sup
ply, environmental damage and
unequal access to energy sources.
Abraham plans to meet next
week with the president of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries and the Saudi Arabi
an oil minister during a trip to the
Persian Gulf
