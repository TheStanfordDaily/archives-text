## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Sexual assault education 
### 
This week, members of next
year's residence staff in all cam
pus dorms will be announced.
According to the Office of Resi
dential Education, the purpose of resi
dence staff is twofold. First, they serve as
"the front line for fielding questions and
addressing personal issues." Second, they
develop programs within the dorms to
"encourage the intellectual, academic,
personal and social growth" of residents.
As the new cohort of residence staff begin
to receive training to fulfill these two very
important roles within the dorms, they —
especially the resident assistants and the
peer health educators — should consider
addressing in the dorms a pressing cam
pus issue: sexual assault.
During this year's "Take Back the
Night," which took place on April 17, a
crowd of 40 women and men marched
across campus carrying lit candles while
chanting slogans like "Yes means yes, no
means no, whatever I wear, wherever I
go." Designed to raise awareness of sexual
assault on campus, the event ended with a
rally at which the participants declared
Stanford a "Rape-Free Zone."
When Katie Koestner, a date-rape sur
vivor and sexual assault prevention ac
tivist, spoke on campus last quarter, stu
dents revealed having been emotionally
touched and mentally challenged by
Koestner's message, which emphasized
the importance of responsibility, commu
nity and respect among college students.
But despite these kinds of efforts to ed
ucate the Stanford community about sex
ual assault prevention and response, many
on this campus remain poorly informed,
which is a problem because sexual assault
cases are reported each year — there were
seven last year.
While ways to both prevent and re
spond to sexual assault are addressed in
"The Real World: Stanford," a theater
performance that nearly all incoming
freshmen see during Orientation Week,
the message is often lost by the end of the
year and almost certainly lost by the end of
four years. And since sexual assault is only
one of the many topics addressed in the
presentation, freshmen often walk away
without clear knowledge of how to deal
with sexual assault.
In addition to being incorporated into
"The Real World: Stanford," presenta
tions in dorms by a counselor from Coun
seling and Psychological Services or a
member of the Sexual Assault Prevention
Program would be highly effective in edu
cating freshmen, mainly because in that

kind of small setting, students may feel
more comfortable asking questions and
engaging in discussion with one another.
Particularly during the first few weeks of
the school year, the dorm is where fresh
men feel most comfortable, and since sex
ual assault is a highly sensitive issue, edu
cation on sexual assault prevention and re
sponse education should start in the dorm.
According to the Residential Staff Re
source Guide, published by the Health
Promotion Services at the Vaden Health
Center, the most likely time fora female to
be sexually assaulted is during the first few
weeks of freshman year. Given this infor
mation, it is important that freshmen are
given the appropriate information and re
sources to deal with sexual assault when
they first arrive on campus. They need to
be able to define sexual assault and, most
importandy, must know where to turn for
both immediate and long-term help. Un
fortunately, this information is currendy
not readily available to students.
In many dorms, peer health educators
may offer programs focused on sexual as
sault. However, PHEs are not required to
do so. And in many upperclassmen dorms
and houses, there are no PHEs. As a result,
after Orientation Week of freshman year,
many students are never presented with
information about sexual assault again.
PHEs and other members of the residence
staff (in dorms without PHEs) should
make a conscious effort, preferably early in
the year, to offer programming to address
sexual assault.
Educating the Stanford community
about sexual assault prevention and re
sponse is not a responsibility that falls sole
ly into the hands of residence staff. Sexual
Assault Prevention Program, Campus
Sexual Assault Response & Recovery
Team and Vaden Medical Services — pro
fessional resources available to students —
and Stanford Student Self-Defense Pro
gram, Coalition Against Sexual Assault
and Stanford United in Rape
Elimination — student peer resources —
should better advertise the programs and
services that they offer. One way to do so is
to publish a sticker or flier with a step-by
step guide to handing sexual assault — in
cluding the names, phone numbers and
descriptions of these organizations — that
can be placed in each dorm room, along
side the fire escape plans.
Creating a safe, healthy environment at
Stanford is in the best interest of everyone
within the community, and the first step to
ward preventing sexual assault on campus
is through education.
