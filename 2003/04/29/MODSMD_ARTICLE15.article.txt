# LYING IN THE GRASS
## The 						religion thing 
### 
Every Wednesday evening
in the Geo Corner, after
the bumblebee franticness
of the daytime has died
down, members of the Christian fel
lowship group Intervarsity gather
together to sing and worship. Once
in awhile I'll join this mosaic of stu
dents to soak in the camaraderie
and let the gospel music seep
through my skin, in the hopes that
I'll gain what most members of In
tervarsity already possess: an unwa
vering belief in God.
My personal conception of God
can be encapsulated in"The Simp
sons" rendition of our divine being:
somebody with whom you could
split a large pepperoni pizza and
shoot a few games of pool. Granted,
1 would lose every time, but He's still
an omniscient friend, and not some
body before whom I should spend
every waking moment cowering in
fear. Fortunately, setting aside the
Ned Flanders satire, the Archbishop
of Canterbury sees the virtue in
such a conception, calling "The
Simpsons" a program with "one of
the most subtle pieces of propagan
da around in the cause of sense, hu
mility and virtue." Otherwise, my
brand of religion would be labeled a
cult, and I'cl be hanging out with
Beezlebub in the afterlife.
Some people construe the
Christian way as the only way. But
what makes it so fundamentally dif
ferent from any of the other reli
gions? The Greeks and Egyptians
worshiped their deities before we
decided to put them into story
books and turn everything into
"mythology." Call me naive, but
the Jews, Muslims, Christians,
Catholics, Quakers and Mormons
essentially worship the same Ulti
mate Being, the details being varia
tions on a recurring motif. Yet the
search fora higher meaning, how
ever you want to define it, is what
leads me to God.
I started going to Intervarsity
and the occasional Sunday service
ever since I picked up the God bug
again at the end of last year. My
mom took me to church as a little

kid, and I've always considered my
self Christian, though it has never
been the f(>cal point of my life. The
Bible thing fell to the wayside a few
years back after I saw people
around me, the so-called hypocriti
cal Christians, abide by the Seven
Deadly Sins on Saturday nights and
then claim devout piety the next
morning.
In this instance, it seemed like

God's purpose was
to be at the helm of
a social network
and even act as the
heavenly host of
some twisted dat
ing game. The
church was re
duced to the func
tion of a town hall

or coffee shop, purely a place of con
gregation where the Christianity be
came lost amid the superficial con
versations.
True, nobody's perfect, but the
moral discrepancies were just way
too large. I've seen these people slip
in a couple extra bucks into the col
lection plate — I've done it myself
many a time. But you don't need a
Gideon Bible from some seedy hotel
to shed light on the fact that God
does not accept bribes.
Within any church, there is a
wide spectrum of believers. Some
have walked with God their whole
lives, while others, like me, are just
beginning to find their ways
through the dark. Yet my views are
far different from those of tfie Bible
toting, proselytizing Birdcage man
who constantly warns us of impend
ing doom. And that is the most diffi
cult part for me to reconcile. You're
either supposed to eat and breathe
Christianity, or you're supposed to
steer clear of the path, comfortable
with the notion that once your pulse
stops, your body disintegrates into
the earth, and, sorry', that's all folks.
Everything's so black and white
that there's little space fora person
to put his foot in the water, to criti
cally contemplate aspects of Chris
tianity's moral order before the reli
gious tsunami swallows him whole.

Once you ascribe to the idea that
there is a power above you, actions
fall into place a little bit more easily.
A belief in God can be the ultimate
agent for g(xxl, spurring people to
live honorably and altruistically and
fight against the injustices lurking
about our earthly domain. At the
same time, religion — in whatever
form, be it Christianity, Islam or Ju
daism — can be used to justify social
treachery. In antebellum America,
the Bible was quoted in support of
slavery, while Osama Bin Laden's
lemmings and suicide bombers
alike invoke Allah in their quest to
become martyred.
For good or ill, there is some
thing about religion that strikes at
the ideological core, igniting a pas
sionate flame that allows us to blind
ly leap into the abyss of faith.
The Torah, Koran, Bible and
Bhagavad Gita all speak the univer
sal language of spirituality, topping
into our emotional wellspring, turn
ing us into specks of dust in the
grand scheme of things. In more
pessimistic moments, I'm scared
that religion's purpose is much
more mundane: a cultural vehicle
for those who fear the abruptness of
death, if not a purely institutional
ized form for ordering our awe with
the world. Nor is religion perfecdy
rational: Witness Charlton Heston
in the guise of Moses, standing atop
a mountain shouting, "Thou shah
not kill!" while wielding a rifle in his
right palm. Hallelujah, we have a
contradiction!
I've made the decision to delve
into Christianity, and now my fu
ture is left to Clothos, the Greek
goddess of fate, who can spin and
cut as she whimsically pleases. Nev
ertheless, I'm still questioning
things, searching for Christian nir
vana wherever it may lie. In the
meantime, though, I'll still go to In
tervarsity — if only as a peripheral
member — and, afterward, whistle
a gospel tune as I make my way back
home.
