Columnists fails to understand work of
the ASSU fora new student union
I was shocked to read Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's column,
"A new union: now or never" (April 28).
While the column is correct in that there is
not a student union on campus, all other
content in the column is factually incor
rect. For the last two years the ASSU has
been working hard to plan a new student
union, lobby administrators and gather
support. Also, there is currently a Univer
sity committee that is looking into the pos
sibility of a new student union.
When the columnists claim that the
ASSU refuses to work on the new student
union issue, they arc missing the mark.
Fora year, the ASSU has led an effort
called the Campaign for Student Space, a
project to assess and lobby for the most
needed forms of student space, including
a new student union. In addition, for nine
months I have been sitting on the Student
Activities Space Committee, which is look
ing into the renovation or construction of
a new Tresidder. Through the work of the
ASSU, administrators are aware of the
need fora new student union.

However, a new student union would
cost upwards of $60 million, money that is
not easily available given the current state
of the economy. So while the columnists
claim that "funds.. . may have already
been squandered on specialized interests,"
the fact is that the funds have never exist
ed. Benefactors of the University far pre
fer to give money to educational aspects of
the school rather than to activity space.
And unfortunately, the $10,000 of ASSU
money dedicated to the arts grant pro
gram would buy a nice couch in a $60 mil
lion student union, nothing else.
Finally, many of the specialized inter
ests the columnists refer to do benefit the
entire study body. Cultural, social and
artistic events all work to better our cam
pus. While not every student may attend
An Art Affair, Pow Wow or Diversity Pest,
all of these events work to make Stanford a
better place by bringing greater knowl
edge to the student body and fostering a
more diverse environment.

Reader 'concerned and personally
offended' by psychology lecture
I am appalled and saddened that Stan

ford would allow Northwestern Universi
ty Psychology Prof. Michael Bailey a plat
form to spew his dangerous and ill-in
formed findings. As a transsexual man, I
have worked incredibly hard to find a safe
and engaging community in which to ful
fill my greater promise, and had I been
treated or put in the way of someone such
as Michael Bailey I would not have come
as far as I have today.
In 1974 I was attending junior high
school in southern California and transi
tioned during that time. It wasn't at all
easy and would have been much harder
with information such as Bailey's out in the
world. I have overcome substantial social
and cultural obstacles to thrive as an artist,
Internet developer, husband and activist.
I am very concerned and personally of
fended by the Psychology Department's
insensitivity and wonder why Stanford
would even have someone like him lecture
(and elicit laughter) there.
I appreciated Joan Roughgarden's
measured and thoughtful response to the
lecture in her guest column, "Psychology
lecture lacks sensitivity to sexual orienta
tion" (April 25), and hope that the staff of
the Psychology Department will issue
some type of response to her guest col
umn. My wife of 10 years and I are very
proud of who we are and proud of all
we've accomplished. We don't need the

type of misunderstanding that ideas like
Bailey's create.

Stanford should not have invited
psychology professor to lecture
I am a transsexual living and working
full-time as a woman. Had I been a stu
dent in the classroom with Northwestern
University Psychology Prof. Michael Bai
ley and heard his antics, I would have been
offended by his presentation â€” so much
so that I would have sued Stanford for sex
ual harassment, which is what Bailey's lec
ture seemed to amount to. Would Stan
ford allow someone to come into a class
room and present women or other mi
norities in a similar light? I don't believe it
would. If someone were to do that, that
person would be called a misogynist
and / or a bigot.
Instead, the faculty and students who
attended Bailey's lecture broke out in
laughter. I think a little sensitivity is need
ed here for gay, lesbian and transgen
dered people. Bailey just stereotypes
transsexuals such as myself. Many of us
are emotionally distraught as it is by the

way society treats us. Stanford is adding
further fuel to the fire by inviting him
into the classroom, which validates his
psuedo-science.
