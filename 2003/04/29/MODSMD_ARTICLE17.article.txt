## Gym nabs eight All-America honors 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Murphy's Law says that anything that
can happen will happen. In the history of
NCAA women's gymnastics, only UCLA,
Georgia, Alabama and Utah have ever
tumbled to the top of the winner's podium
at nationals. Of the 12 women's gymnas
tics teams that competed at the NCAA.
Championships last weekend, eight — in
cluding No. (j Stanford — were hoping
Murphy would be on their side in the
search to win their first-ever team titles.
But the Cardinal's hopes fora Cin
derella season just weren't in cards last
week. In a stacked session with three
perennial powerhouses, the Cardinal fell
short of securing its second-straight Super
Six berth, finishing fifth in a field of six
teams during the first evening of competi
tion.
"We had some great individual perfor
mances," coach Kristen Smyth said. "But
we didn't have a great team effort. Men
tally, we just weren't on our game as a
whole."
Last year, the Cardinal became only the
ninth team to ever break into the second

night ofcompetition in NCAA history with
its first-ever Super Six appearance. But, in
order to compete on the last day of the sea
son, the squad needed to put forth its best
effort on Thursday and the scores simply
didn't fall in its favor.
"It was disappointing to be physically
prepared and be in the position to have
depth on the second day, which is what
most teams really struggle with," Smyth
said. "But, Stanford's only been to nation
als six times and we are never going to get
the benefit of the doubt until we earn it
with our best performances."
Still, the night saw stellar individual
performances from the Stanford roster,
notably from freshmen Natalie Foley and
Glyn Sweets and juniors Caroline Fluhrer
and Lindsay Wing. The foursome walked
away with eight All-America honors, as
Fluhrer and the rookies picked up the first
such awards of their respective careers.
Wing's second-place effort on beam gar
nered her a position to compete in the in
dividual event finals on Saturday.
The Cardinal started the evening with
a solid delivery on the vaulting table, but a
miss at the second spot in the lineup
stopped the momentum of building scores

that Stanford needed to start the night ofl
right. Nonetheless, the last four athletes
stuck their vaults with Sweets and Foley
earning 9.8755, good for second-team All-
America spots.
On the uneven bars, Sweets suffered a
tough fall, but Wing was right there to
cover her, matching Foley's 9.85 on the
apparatus. Fluhrer capped off the Cardi
nal effort with a 9.875 and a tie for fifth
place.
"Lindsay really stepped up right after
the fall and stuck her routine and double
front dismount," Smyth said. "I was so
glad that she earned All-America honors
on the event, because she's worked so
hard for that. To have our last three girls
up, Lindsay, Natalie and Caroline, pick
up their first All-America honors on bars
was very exciting." Yet again, the early
miss made it difficult for Stanford to earn
the huge scores it wanted later in the line
up. "These meets come
down to quarters and halves of a point.
Bars was sort of our opportunity to get
some distance in front of Georgia and put
them on the defensive," Smvth said. "In-

in the program's history, including three from freshman Natalie Foley.
stead we opened the door."
After two events, the Cardinal
found itself in fourth plate and
hoped its balance beam lineup
could move it into third. The team
went 6-for-6 on the event, with
Wing's 9.9 pacing Stanford's effort.
Sweets and Foley garnered second
team All-America honors with a
9.875 and 9.85, respectively.
The squad ended the night on
the lloor exercise, which has been a

struggle all year. Despite Fluhrer's
9.85 and Foley and Wing's 9.85,
Stanford had trouble staying in
bounds and chalking up high
scores, thus finding itself in fifth
place with a 196.2 —just 0.425
points away from the Super Six —
at the end of the evening. Wing's
execution on beam earned her
first-team All-America honors,
which Foley also picked up in the
all-around after her solid tour de
force in every event.
Despite having its season end
earlier than hoped, the future isn't
bleak for this resilient team that is
bent on rewriting the record books.

"We had an especially long sea
son this year and 1 think it may
have been an emotional struggle to
keep up the level of intensity we
needed that night," Smyth said.
"[Junior Kendall Beck] was solid
for us at NCAAs, especially after
coming off an injury. (Junior Use
Leveille] also had a good perfor
mance and she has competed in
(he all-around all year, doing a
beautiful job of getting us to na
tionals. "We return an amazing se
nior class next year and all of our
All-Americans, so we've already
started to look forward to what
next year will bring."
