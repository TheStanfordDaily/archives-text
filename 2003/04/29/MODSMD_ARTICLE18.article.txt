# Big wins despite horrible games
## 
### 
Despite his best efforts, Wally Sczerbiak could
not single-handedly will his Timberwolves
to lose game three of their best-of-seven se
ries with the L.A. Lakers. Not for lack of ef
fort, mind you, but sometimes even those perfor
mances that are so abominable that they become the
basis for eternal ridicule and death threats can not be
rewarded with the loss they so deserve.
In one of the most atrocious six minutes of bas
ketball I have ever seen from an NBA player not
wearing a Clippers uniform, Sczerbiak gift-wrapped
a victory for the Lakers only to have them spurn the

gesture like Allen Iverson turning
down an invitation to practice.
He began his sabotage efforts by
picking up a late game technical
foul. Then, with the T-Wolves up
by five with under 23 seconds to
play, Sczerbiak stupidly fouled
Kobe Bryant while shooting a 3-
pointer, setting up a four-point
play for the Lakers.

On the ensuing play, Sczerbiak stepped out of
bounds after receiving the inbounds pass, allowing
the Lakers to tie the game and send it into overtime.
The extra period was a little bit more of the same
for VVally. 1 le had a costly turnover, got a 3-point at
tempt swatted into about the 53rd row and played ter
rible defense. Luckily for Minnesota, not even Wally
the Wretched could rip victory from their clutches in
game three.
That memorable performance has inspired me to
give praise to some of the others whose feats of im
mortal despicability were not enough to bring their
teams to the depths of defeat.
1.) The entirety of the 2001 Arizona Diamond
backs except Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. In
the three games the D-backs lost on their way to de
throning the Yankees, Arizona hitters managed a pal
try six runs in 31 innings of play. And the final two of
the measly three runs they put up in game seven to
win the series were more fluke than skill.
With Johnson and Schilling mowing down Yan
kees left and light, Luis Gonzalez and company did
everything they could to spoil their pitchers' efforts.
But in the end, they came up one mistimed swing
with a lucky bounce short of blowing it all.
2.) I lu* offense of the 2000-2001 Baltimore
Ravens, l liis unit went a month without even scoring
a touchdown, but got bailed out by the fact that no one
wants to run at a middle linebacker who may or may
not have stabbed a man to death a few months earli
er. Ray Lewis and the Baltimore defense turned in
one of the most dazzling defensive seasons in NFL his
tory and proved true the old adage that defense wins
championships.
In one of the biggest disappointments in recent
NFL history, those hopelessly offensive Ravens upset
the more complete and more deserving Tennessee
Titans in the AFC championship game, despite the
fact that the offense was slightly less daunting than a
French army brigade to six German teenagers with
slingshots and water balloons. The Ravens went on to
beat the New York Giants in the worst Super Bowl
ever played. 1 would have switched the television to
NASCAR if I'd had the opportunity. Seriously,
NASCAR.
3.) Stanford University. We've been trying pretty
damn hard to blow our reputation as the elite colle
giate athletics program in the nation, but it looks like
for now we will continue our stranglehold on the
Sears Cup despite our best efforts.
I seriously don't know how Stanford keeps attrac t
ing top athletes to play here, but the Cardinal remain
one of the top draws for many of the nation's prep


Ryan Stewart
stars. This is in spite of the tact that
the administration is doing all it can
to drain the last ounce of fun out of
a school that was only marginally
cool to begin with.
We've slapped some sort of
probation on any organization
with a charter, a stray beer can
and a drunk freshman within 20

yards of its meeting place. And
though the pipeline was never ex
actly overflowing, the supply of
hot, fun-loving students is reach
ing dangerously low Mi l'propor
tions. With stricter measures in
place to limit the concentration of
personal enjoyment at campus
events, any party that doesn't get
shut down by the cops past 12:45
is a real rager.
Personally, if I were a top athlete
with plans of going pro picking be
tween Stanford and University of

Miami, I'd be practicing having
someone else do my homework for
me while I lay in the sun with many
beautiful women on South Beach.
But since the NAS( 'AR refuses to let
me join the circuit because 1 make
fun of it too much, Cardinal and
white isn't such a bad choice.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and the University is current
ly considering placing him on double se

tory and proved true the old adage that defense wins
championships.
In one of the biggest disappointments in recent
NFL history, those hopelessly offensive Ravens upset
the more complete and more deserving Tennessee
Titans in the AFC championship game, despite the
fact that the offense was slightly less daunting than a
French army brigade to six German teenagers with
slingshots and water balloons. The Ravens went on to
beat the New York Giants in the worst Super Bowl
ever played. 1 would have switched the television to
NASCAR if I'd had the opportunity. Seriously,
NASCAR.
3.) Stanford University. We've been trying pretty
damn hard to blow our reputation as the elite colle
giate athletics program in the nation, but it looks like
for now we will continue our stranglehold on the
Sears Cup despite our best efforts.
I seriously don't know how Stanford keeps attrac t
ing top athletes to play here, but the Cardinal remain
one of the top draws for many of the nation's prep

stars. This is in spite of the tact that
the administration is doing all it can
to drain the last ounce of fun out of
a school that was only marginally
cool to begin with.
We've slapped some sort of
probation on any organization
with a charter, a stray beer can
and a drunk freshman within 20

yards of its meeting place. And
though the pipeline was never ex
actly overflowing, the supply of
hot, fun-loving students is reach
ing dangerously low Mi l'propor
tions. With stricter measures in
place to limit the concentration of
personal enjoyment at campus
events, any party that doesn't get
shut down by the cops past 12:45
is a real rager.
Personally, if I were a top athlete
with plans of going pro picking be
tween Stanford and University of

Miami, I'd be practicing having
someone else do my homework for
me while I lay in the sun with many
beautiful women on South Beach.
But since the NAS( 'AR refuses to let
me join the circuit because 1 make
fun of it too much, Cardinal and
white isn't such a bad choice.
