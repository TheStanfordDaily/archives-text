## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
As a warm-up for this weekend's Big Meet and Car
dinal Invitational, the Stanford track and field squads
competed across the nation this weekend at the Drake
Relays in lowa, the UC-San Diego Invitational and the
Cal Invitational.
The distance squads completed a successful week
end in lowa by claiming five of the six distance-relay ti
tles and bringing home an individual title.
Sophomore Sara Bei claimed the individual title in
the women's 1,500-meter run with a personal best
time of 4 minutes, 20.88 seconds. Bei's time qualifies
her for both the Pacific-10 Conference and West Re
gional Championships.
Sophomore JeaneGoff hit her third Pac-lOand re
gional qualifying time of the season, this time in the
5,000. Cioff set a personal best of 16:55.28 to finish
fourth in the race.
The four-mile relay team of Bei, redshirt freshman
Alicia Craig, and juniors Lindsay Hyatt and Katie
Hotchkiss ran away from the field, finishing almost 27
seconds ahead of second place in 19:25.91.
"I've never run on a Stanford relay before," Bei
said. "This was really exciting for me. I felt a huge re
sponsibility since Stanford has such a history of being
so consistent and doing so well."
In a similar manner, the distance medley team of
Hotchkiss, freshman Chinny Offor, and seniors Ma
lindi Elmore and Lauren Flesh man took home the
second relay title for the Cardinal women and set the
Drake Relays record of 11:03.59. The time also breaks
the outdoor school record in the distance medley.
The women also won the 3,200-meter relay in a
time 0f8:36.70.
For the men, the team of redshirt 112 reshman Ryan
1 lall, senior Steve Loughlin, and juniors Louis Luchi
ni and Grant Robison claimed the four-mile relay title
in 16:31.19.
The distance medley team of Hall, Robison, junior
Seth I lejny and sophomore Nick Sebes took top hon
ors as well with a time 0f9:43.33.
Loughlin led four Stanford runners in the 1,500,
finishing fourth with a time of 3:48.51.
"Stanford has such a great tradition, and we build

on it wherever we go," Robison said. "We just have to
come in and uphold that, and I guess we kind of use
that as motivation."
The sprint relays had a mixed weekend at Drake.
The men's 400-meter relay scratched and the
1,600-meter relay team failed to qualify for the finals
with a preliminary time of 3:12.82 that was more than
five seconds slower than its season best.
But the women's relay squads pulled through and
qualified to both finals. The 400-meter relay finished
fifth in 45.61 while the 1,600-meter relay team fin
ished third in 3:36.87.
Continuing her successful season, junior Lindsey
Johnson also finished a strong third in the women's
100 hurdles. Despite running into a strong headwind,
Johnson managed a solid 13.84.
Senior Milton Little flirted with 26 feet for the sec
ond weekend in the row in the longjump. 1 lis mark of
25 feet, 9.50 inches was good enough to win the event
by 1.50 inches.
Back in southern California, the Cardinal throwers
competed successfully against some of the best com
petition from around the nation.
Senior Omer Inan took 11th in the stacked discus
field that that saw Carl Brown throw an incredible
early season 222-08 and Auburn's Gabor Mate break
his own collegiate record with a toss of 219-09.
In the hammer, senior Nick Welihozkiy continued
his steady improvement with a personal-best 218-02
that jniLs him among the top collegiate hammer
throwers this season. Welihozkiy's mark gave him the
win by over 13 feet.
Welihozkiy followed the effort with another per
sonal-best, this time in the discus. His toss of 174-03
was good enough for eighth in the second Might of the
discus.
Across the bay at the Cal Invitational, competing
unattached, senior Che Banjoko claimed third in the
800, running 1:53.46 while freshman Sean Drake, also
running unattached, finished fourth in 1:53.81.
Freshman Brett Gotcher, compet ing unattached in
his first race since the world cross country champi
onships, claimed seventh in the 1,500 with a time of
3:55.70.
The Cardinal remains at home this coming week
end to host the renowned Cardinal Invitational, which

attracts elite competition from around the nation and
for the Big Meet against Cal.
The men's squad is looking to win its third-straight
Big Meet over the Bears, while the women are looking
to score more than 100 points against Cal for the third
year in a row when the teams meet on Saturday night
at (>ohb Track and Angell Field.

Junior Katie Hotchkiss won all three relays she partici
pated in this weekend — the 3,200, four-mile and the
distance medley relay — helping the Stanford women
take the Drake Relays Title.
As a warm-up for this weekend's Big Meet and Car
dinal Invitational, the Stanford track and field squads
competed across the nation this weekend at the Drake
Relays in lowa, the UC-San Diego Invitational and the
Cal Invitational.
The distance squads completed a successful week
end in lowa by claiming five of the six distance-relay ti
tles and bringing home an individual title.
Sophomore Sara Bei claimed the individual title in
the women's 1,500-meter run with a personal best
time of 4 minutes, 20.88 seconds. Bei's time qualifies
her for both the Pacific-10 Conference and West Re
gional Championships.
Sophomore JeaneGoff hit her third Pac-lOand re
gional qualifying time of the season, this time in the
5,000. Cioff set a personal best of 16:55.28 to finish
fourth in the race.
The four-mile relay team of Bei, redshirt freshman
Alicia Craig, and juniors Lindsay Hyatt and Katie
Hotchkiss ran away from the field, finishing almost 27
seconds ahead of second place in 19:25.91.
"I've never run on a Stanford relay before," Bei
said. "This was really exciting for me. I felt a huge re
sponsibility since Stanford has such a history of being
so consistent and doing so well."
In a similar manner, the distance medley team of
Hotchkiss, freshman Chinny Offor, and seniors Ma
lindi Elmore and Lauren Flesh man took home the
second relay title for the Cardinal women and set the
Drake Relays record of 11:03.59. The time also breaks
the outdoor school record in the distance medley.
The women also won the 3,200-meter relay in a
time 0f8:36.70.
For the men, the team of redshirt 112 reshman Ryan
1 lall, senior Steve Loughlin, and juniors Louis Luchi
ni and Grant Robison claimed the four-mile relay title
in 16:31.19.
The distance medley team of Hall, Robison, junior
Seth I lejny and sophomore Nick Sebes took top hon
ors as well with a time 0f9:43.33.
Loughlin led four Stanford runners in the 1,500,
finishing fourth with a time of 3:48.51.
"Stanford has such a great tradition, and we build

on it wherever we go," Robison said. "We just have to
come in and uphold that, and I guess we kind of use
that as motivation."
The sprint relays had a mixed weekend at Drake.
The men's 400-meter relay scratched and the
1,600-meter relay team failed to qualify for the finals
with a preliminary time of 3:12.82 that was more than
five seconds slower than its season best.
But the women's relay squads pulled through and
qualified to both finals. The 400-meter relay finished
fifth in 45.61 while the 1,600-meter relay team fin
ished third in 3:36.87.
Continuing her successful season, junior Lindsey
Johnson also finished a strong third in the women's
100 hurdles. Despite running into a strong headwind,
Johnson managed a solid 13.84.
Senior Milton Little flirted with 26 feet for the sec
ond weekend in the row in the longjump. 1 lis mark of
25 feet, 9.50 inches was good enough to win the event
by 1.50 inches.
Back in southern California, the Cardinal throwers
competed successfully against some of the best com
petition from around the nation.
Senior Omer Inan took 11th in the stacked discus
field that that saw Carl Brown throw an incredible
early season 222-08 and Auburn's Gabor Mate break
his own collegiate record with a toss of 219-09.
In the hammer, senior Nick Welihozkiy continued
his steady improvement with a personal-best 218-02
that jniLs him among the top collegiate hammer
throwers this season. Welihozkiy's mark gave him the
win by over 13 feet.
Welihozkiy followed the effort with another per
sonal-best, this time in the discus. His toss of 174-03
was good enough for eighth in the second Might of the
discus.
