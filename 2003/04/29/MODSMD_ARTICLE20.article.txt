Stanford came out strong when fresh
man Megan Burker netted a goal from
All-American candidate and the team's
leading scorer sophomore Kelsey Twist,
just 1:13 inlo the game. But the Cardinal
struggled in the following 10 minutes, al
lowing six unanswered Big Red goals,
two by Cornell star sophomore Lindsay
Steinberg en route to her career best per
formance of five goals and two assists.
Stanford finally responded with another
goal by Burker and two other Cardinal
scores to close the gap to two at 0-4. But
Steinberg again came through for the Big
Red, posting her third goal of the afternoon
with only six minutes remaining in the half.

The Burker-Steinberg pattern continued,
however, as Burker responded with her
third goal and the final score of the half.
Stanford left the field at halftime trailing by
two, 7-5.
The Cardinal entered the second half as
aggressively as it had the first when fresh
man Sarah Bach notched the first goal in
less than a minute, closing the gap to one at
7-6.
But again the big story for the Big Red
was Steinberg, who responded to the Car
dinal challenge with a score of her own in
one of four times Steinberg directly an
swered a Stanford goal. Hie back-and-forth
pattern continued as a score by sophomore
Claire Cal/onetti pulled the Cardinal with
in one again and Steinberg responded by
notching another goal.
But this time, with the score at 9-7,
Stanford didn't respond, and Steinberg's
goal became part of a 4-0 run after which
the Big Red lead 12-7. The Cardinal's two
goals in the remaining 10 minutes of play
were not enough, and the Cardinal lost
12-9.
Stanford will face no. 2 Colgate this af
ternoon in Hamilton, NY. The Raiders
suffered a recent 13-9 loss to Bucknell in
the Patriot League Semifinals, falling to
10-6.
