In an effort to bring a more diverse range of grad
uate students to campus, the University has hired
Stanford graduate Claudia Schweikert to be the new
assistant dean for graduate diversity. After several
weeks in her new position, Schweikert said she plans
to focus primarily on recruitment and retention of mi
nority students in all seven schools.
Schweikert said her main concern is "letting the
University community know that [diversity] is a prior
ity — not just words that are written in an affirmative
action policy.
"That it is something meaningful to everyone who
is here, something important for all of us that every
one should be focused on," she said.
Last month, Stanford announced that the appoint
ment of two other alumni, Stephanie Fryberg and
Joseph Brown, to be the assistant deans for multicul
tural graduate student services in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, where they will work on in
creasing diversity. With the same goal in mind,
Schweikert will have a broader role.
"I work in the Dean of Research [and Graduate
Policy] Office," she said. "I am focused on all of the
graduate schools. . . it's the one office that coordi
nates among all the different schools on campus," she
said.
After graduating from Stanford with a law degree
in 1995, Schweikert came back to get an MBA in 2002
because she "loved Stanford." Upon realizing that
neither legal work nor finance was for her, she said
she "started focusing on what I was passionate about,
and diversity is something I care a lot about."
Godfrey Mungal, associate dean for graduate poli
cy, told the Stanford News Service, "Our goal here is
to improve graduate diversity, similar to the under
graduate student body. We are delighted to get going
on this with Claudia. She brings a lot of enthusiasm,
and all the things from her background were very ap
pealing to us."
Among her first efforts, Schweikert wants to recruit
