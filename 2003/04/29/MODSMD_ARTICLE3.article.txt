In an effort to bring a more diverse range of grad
uate students to campus, the University has hired
Stanford graduate Claudia Schweikert to be the new
assistant dean for graduate diversity. After several
weeks in her new position, Schweikert said she plans
to focus primarily on recruitment and retention of mi
nority students in all seven schools.
Schweikert said her main concern is "letting the
University community know that [diversity] is a prior
ity — not just words that are written in an affirmative
action policy.
"That it is something meaningful to everyone who
is here, something important for all of us that every
one should be focused on," she said.
Last month, Stanford announced that the appoint
ment of two other alumni, Stephanie Fryberg and
Joseph Brown, to be the assistant deans for multicul
tural graduate student services in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, where they will work on in
creasing diversity. With the same goal in mind,
Schweikert will have a broader role.
"I work in the Dean of Research [and Graduate
Policy] Office," she said. "I am focused on all of the
graduate schools. . . it's the one office that coordi
nates among all the different schools on campus," she
said.
After graduating from Stanford with a law degree
in 1995, Schweikert came back to get an MBA in 2002
because she "loved Stanford." Upon realizing that
neither legal work nor finance was for her, she said
she "started focusing on what I was passionate about,
and diversity is something I care a lot about."
Godfrey Mungal, associate dean for graduate poli
cy, told the Stanford News Service, "Our goal here is
to improve graduate diversity, similar to the under
graduate student body. We are delighted to get going
on this with Claudia. She brings a lot of enthusiasm,
and all the things from her background were very ap
pealing to us."
Among her first efforts, Schweikert wants to recruit
current undergraduates who are
not considering graduate school.
She identified one of her main
goals as "getting students interest
ed in going to grad school. Period.
Students who didn't think a mas
ters or Ph.D. were for them."
To this end, Schweikert plans to
reach outside of Stanford to "uni
versities that maybe aren't typical
ly pipeline schools to Stanford —
not just going to the Ivies." She
plans on "going to some of the
Southwestern universities that
serve Latino students, going to
tribal colleges, black colleges, pub
lic universities — anywhere where
there are talented, bright students
but for one reason or another
don't apply to Stanford."
Including a focus on diversity

within the admissions process is
also important to the new dean.
"Admissions committees take
into account a lot of different fac
tors: life experience, work experi
ence — who the whole person is,
all the different factors that go into
making each student unique, not
just test scores and the institution
attended," Schweikert said.
In terms of retention, she
planned to focus on helping stu
dents "through whatever issues
they have so they can graduate."
While at Stanford, Schweikert
co-chaired the Latino Law Stu
dents' Association and was co
president of the Hispanic Business
Students Association. After gradu
ating from Stanford she held in
ternships at the NAACP Legal De
fense Fund and the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and Edu
cational Fund. She has also
worked in both public interest and
private law firms.
