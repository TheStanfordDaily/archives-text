### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
National Security Adviser to
former President Jimmy Carter
Zbigniew Brzezinski will be speak
ing at 7:30 p.m. tonight in Memo
rial Auditorium. The event, spon
sored primarily by the Forum for
American / Chinese Exchanges at
Stanford, is part of a three-day
campus discourse on U.S.-China
relations.
Born in Poland in 1928,
Brzezinski acted as a presidential
adviser during the administra

tions of both former Presidents
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.
Johnson. Having played an inte
gral role in relations with Eastern
Europe during the Johnson years,
he later acted as foreign policy ad
visor to former Vice President Hu
bert Humphrey during his presi
dential campaign.
In 1974, Brzezinski became
Carter's adviser on foreign affairs
during the election and was subse
quently promoted to national se
curity adviser. Strongly opposed
to the agenda of another well
known national security adviser,

Henry Kissinger, he stressed the
further development of U.S.-
China relations and discouraged
unilateral action in any decision.
Acting on anti-Soviet views, he
pursued a more ambitious arms
control agreement with Moscow.
During his career, Brzezinski
faced the Iranian hostage crisis,
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the consequences of rampant
domestic economic stagnation
with monetary inflation, known as
"stagflation." Since his term in the
NSC, he has since become a
prominent professor, writer and
government consultant.
Brzezinski's speech, titled "The
Evolving Dynamics of U.S.-China
Relations," will touch on the histo
ry of interaction and policy be
tween the two nations and address
the direction that they both are
likely to take in the years to come.
According to FACES organiz
ers, when the Bush administration
assumed office, officials cited rela
tions with China as one of the great
strategic challenges of the 21 st cen
tury. However, these concerns
rapidly took a back seat to the con
flict in Iraq and the war against ter

rorism following the Sept. 11 at
tacks.
"At the same time, the United
Slates and China have quietly
achieved a warming of relations,"
said a statement released by
FACES organizers. "The current
moment assumes additional sig
nificance when considered in his
torical context. How should the
current relationship be viewed
and what can expect for the fu
ture?"
FACES was formed in Decem
ber of 2001 by students and facul
ty members to encourage dialogue
and interaction between emerging
leaders in both American and Chi
nese communities on campus. Ac
cording to FACES President Jessi
ca Chen Weiss, a senior, the orga
nization hopes to raise public
awareness, as well as foster trust

and communication between the
two groups.
"We chose this topic because we
believe that the 9/11 incident is a
common concern of national secu
rity for both the U.S. and China,"
said FACES Programming Co-
Chair Wan-Chi So, a junior, "it is
an issue that can help the U.S. and
China put aside some of the divid
ing differences or conflict of ide
ologies and potentially unite the
two countries toward a common
goal of mutual cooperation."
FACES brought Brzezinski to
speak at Stanford via an invitation
through the Hoover Institution in
partnership with the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, the World Affairs
Council, the Commonwealth Club
and Stanford in Government. Ac
cording to FACES Programming
Co-Chair Carol Yu, a sophomore,

potential speakers are usually rec
ommended by advisers and other
foundations.
"We wanted to invite someone
who had played a pivotal role in
shaping U.S.-China relations and
had contributed significantly to
the strengthening of bilateral co
operation between the two coun
tries during the past few decades,"
So said.
Senior Anne 11(3, co-director of
the SIG Public Policy Forum, said,
"Stanford in Government has
been working with FACES in co
sponsoring the Brzezinski lecture.
SIG believes [his] commentary and
insight will draw students of di

and political experiences in critical

garding the pertinent policy area
of U.S.-China relations."
