# Prof wants spam canned
## 
### MICHAEL PABST 
At yesterday's session of the Law School's
weekly Cyberlaw discussion series, Law
Prof. Larry Lessig and Rep. Zoe Lofgren
(D-Calif.) presented a plan to reduce unso
licited commercial e-mail, commonly re
ferred to as "spam." Lessig even gambled
his professorship on the efficacy of his pro
posal: "I will quit my job if this doesn't
work," he said.
The system outlined in the bill would re
quire all spam e-mails to have "ADV:" as the
first four characters of its subject header.
Noncompliant spammers would be subject
to a fine, and the Federal Trade Commis
sion would offer a bounty for successfully

bringing spammers to justice.
Lessig volunteered to resign his profes
sorship if this bill becomes law and "does not
substantially reduce the level of spam."
Also leading the discussion were Lofgren
and computer trade journalist Declan Mc-
Cullagh, who would provide the definition
of a "substantial reduction" that would let
Lessig keep his job.
"Spam costs American business an esti
mated $10 billion a year," said Lofgren,
who noted that the U.S. Attorney General's
Office is unable to spend the resources nec
essary to control the flow of spam into in
boxes.
