# Prof wants spam canned

### MICHAEL PABST 
At yesterday's session of the Law School's
weekly Cyberlaw discussion series, Law
Prof. Larry Lessig and Rep. Zoe Lofgren
(D-Calif.) presented a plan to reduce unso
licited commercial e-mail, commonly re
ferred to as "spam." Lessig even gambled
his professorship on the efficacy of his pro
posal: "I will quit my job if this doesn't
work," he said.
The system outlined in the bill would re
quire all spam e-mails to have "ADV:" as the
first four characters of its subject header.
Noncompliant spammers would be subject
to a fine, and the Federal Trade Commis
sion would offer a bounty for successfully

bringing spammers to justice.
Lessig volunteered to resign his profes
sorship if this bill becomes law and "does not
substantially reduce the level of spam."
Also leading the discussion were Lofgren
and computer trade journalist Declan Mc-
Cullagh, who would provide the definition
of a "substantial reduction" that would let
Lessig keep his job.
"Spam costs American business an esti
mated $10 billion a year," said Lofgren,
who noted that the U.S. Attorney General's
Office is unable to spend the resources nec
essary to control the flow of spam into in
boxes.

Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) spoke at the Law School yesterday
about a new bill she is proposing in Congress that she and Law Prof. Larry
Lessig say will drastically reduce the occurrence of e-mail spam.
The natural solution, said the
presenters, is a bounty.
"It's a system that's worked well
in the United States for over a
hundred years," Lessig said.
The current draft of the bill, still
in the early stages of congressional
procedure, also requires that all
spam provide valid, sender-oper
ated return addresses and pro
hibits spammers from tampering
with routing information. Adult
spam must be labeled with
"ADV:ADLT." All spammers must
maintain and observe a do-not
send list of people who have re
quested not to receive spam. The
FTC will give 20 percent of any
civil penalties collected from a
noncompliant spammer to the

first person to positively identify
him or her.
Lessig rejected an audience
suggestion fora general ban on
spam, saying that making spam
easy fora computer program to
recognize is enough. Most current
e-mail software allows simple rules
for filtering incoming mail.
Lessig also suggested that ad
vertisers could make use of the
A1)V: tag, voluntarily extending it
with categories, such as
ADV:ADLT, to identify the type of
offer and let computer users filter
spam more selectively.
The Cyberlaw discussions, also
known as the Stanford Law
School's Center for Internet and
Society Speakers Series, is a week
ly colloquium meeting Mondays at
the Law School. The series ad
dresses the evolving application of
law and regulation to computers
and information technology.
