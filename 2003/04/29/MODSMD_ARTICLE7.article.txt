# ASSU Senate kicks off with confirmations
## 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
In the first meeting of the Fifth Undergraduate Sen
ate, the ASSU legislative body elected a new chair and
publications director, and began discussion on current
student issues.
Senator Josh Shipp, a sophomore and the only in
cumbent senator, was unanimously approved as the
next senate chair after running unopposed. The other
senators present all voted to confirm Shipp's position as
senate chair; Shipp abstained.
The chair sets Senate meeting agendas and serves as
a member of the ASSU Executive Committee.
"I think I'll do a good job as chair— I'll mainly ab
stain," Shipp quipped in his acceptance speech.
Senior Monica Henestroza, outgoing ASSU presi
dent, appeared at the meeting to express her support
for Shipp's candidacy.
"Josh's commitment and involvement with the
Fourth Undergraduate Senate was exemplary," she
said. "I just want students to know just how wonderful
it is that Josh will be leading the Undergraduate Senate
this year ... if you've worked with him, then you un
derstand [my enthusiasm]."
Sophomore Piotr Kosicki was presented as the nom
inee for the position of publications director. He was
also unanimously elected; Shipp abstained.
Kosicki, currently editor in chief of The Stanford
Review, will assume outgoing Publications Director
Steve Yelderman's position in May.
Flie publications director heads the ASSU's Publica
tion Board, which is independent of the Undergradu
ate Senate and provides funding, technical resources
and workspace at the Storke Student Publications
Building, as well governance to numerous undergrad
uate publications at Stanford.
In his recommendation of Kosicki, Yelderman's mo
tion stated, "Whereas one undergraduate has thor
oughly impressed [the current members of the Publica
tions Board], such that they are convinced that he car
ries the future of the publications on his shoulders and
furthermore has the moral fortitude to face the many
challenges awaiting the Publications Board."
In his brief speech, Kosicki said, "I have been in pub
lication fora little over a year. I definitely will be able to
come to Senate meetings, so I expect to be able to inter
act with you guys regularly."
No major business was presented this week, al
though many in the organization expressed interest in
working on two topics that the ASSU has recendy been
heavily involved in — the new Alcohol Policy regarding
alcohol restrictions in freshman dorms and the need for
a central student center.
The new ASSU executives said that a great deal of
work needs to be done by students to have an impact on
the University's new plan to ban alcohol from all-fresh
man dorm events.
"We have been meeting with various administrators
and have come to agreement that
there was not enough communica
tion with students about this issue
and a lack of understanding about
the interpretation of statistics [con
cerning unsafe alcohol-related inci
dents]," said ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, a junior.
"We're going to focus on stu
dents having input into how this
policy is implemented, because it is

ambiguous and we can affect what
shape it will take," she said.
The executives also said that any
planning fora new student center
would only yield results far into the
future.
"This is something we're work
ing hard on through our Cam
paign for Student Space, but the
reality is, this isn't something that
you will see during your time at
Stanford, even if you become a sev
enth-year grad student," said
sophomore Joey Natoli, ASSU vice
president. "We're looking at $60 to
$100 million."
