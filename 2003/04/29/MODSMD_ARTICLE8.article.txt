Dr. Bakri Musa, an author, surgeon and columnist
for Malaysia Today, lectured on affirmative action in
Malaysian education Monday afternoon as part of the
Southeast Asia Forum at the Asia / Pacific Research
Center. The talk focused on how educational ac hieve
ment in Malaysia is skewed across the Malay, Chinese
and Indian ethnic groups and how a new policy must
rely on globalization, privatization and outreach pro
grams to rural areas, instead of on affirmative action
programs that reinforce the already socially and
racially divided society.
"Here, the minorities who benefit from affirmative
action are the political minorities as well, while in
Malaysia we implicitly recognize that [the policies] af
fect a much larger socioeconomic group. In Malaysia,
it's the Malays who lag behind," Musa said.
Musa described the historical context in which af

British rule on grounds of quality and equity.
Musa said that under British rule, the education
system was characterized by the wholesale import of
British systems. While a Malay and a British educa

wealthier Chinese and Indian residents.
After the British left, attention was turned to the
need fora vast expansion of the educational system,
Musa said. However, similar expansion was not car

became highly competitive as the number of appli
cants increased; as a result, these universities drew
their students primarily from the original, established
schools because the newer Malay schools were not yet
up to par with the British schools.
In 1971, affirmative action was introduced under
the New Economic Policy of the Malaysian govern
ment in an effort to reinvigorate the socioeconomical
ly weak Malay majority.
"The very success of affirmative action relies on its
later failure," Musa said.
As a result, affirmative action policies require peri
odic assessment to watch for underlying change in the
population's educational needs. The current situation
has become questionable, Musa said.
"It is now becoming an entitlement program for the
upper middle class," Musa said. "Many of the beneficia
ries of affirmative action are questioning the program."
Musa said that increased diversity at Malay schools
coupled with privatization and globalization, which
would involve higher education opportunities out-
