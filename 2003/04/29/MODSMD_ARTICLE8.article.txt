Dr. Bakri Musa, an author, surgeon and columnist
for Malaysia Today, lectured on affirmative action in
Malaysian education Monday afternoon as part of the
Southeast Asia Forum at the Asia / Pacific Research
Center. The talk focused on how educational ac hieve
ment in Malaysia is skewed across the Malay, Chinese
and Indian ethnic groups and how a new policy must
rely on globalization, privatization and outreach pro
grams to rural areas, instead of on affirmative action
programs that reinforce the already socially and
racially divided society.
"Here, the minorities who benefit from affirmative
action are the political minorities as well, while in
Malaysia we implicitly recognize that [the policies] af
fect a much larger socioeconomic group. In Malaysia,
it's the Malays who lag behind," Musa said.
Musa described the historical context in which af
firmative action arose in Malaysia starting in the 1950s
and analyzed education programs during and after
British rule on grounds of quality and equity.
Musa said that under British rule, the education
system was characterized by the wholesale import of
British systems. While a Malay and a British educa
tion were as a result on par, these schools were main
ly only in towns and not free, thus privileging the

wealthier Chinese and Indian residents.
After the British left, attention was turned to the
need fora vast expansion of the educational system,
Musa said. However, similar expansion was not car
ried out in higher education. As a result, universities
became highly competitive as the number of appli
cants increased; as a result, these universities drew
their students primarily from the original, established
schools because the newer Malay schools were not yet
up to par with the British schools.
In 1971, affirmative action was introduced under
the New Economic Policy of the Malaysian govern
ment in an effort to reinvigorate the socioeconomical
ly weak Malay majority.
"The very success of affirmative action relies on its
later failure," Musa said.
As a result, affirmative action policies require peri
odic assessment to watch for underlying change in the
population's educational needs. The current situation
has become questionable, Musa said.
"It is now becoming an entitlement program for the
upper middle class," Musa said. "Many of the beneficia
ries of affirmative action are questioning the program."
Musa said that increased diversity at Malay schools
coupled with privatization and globalization, which
would involve higher education opportunities out-

side Malaysia, should be pivotal to
improving education in Malaysia.
Institute for International
Studies Senior Fellow Donald
Emmerson said that though the
people in attendance were pre
dominantly Malaysians from dif
ferent backgrounds, they could
discuss the issues openly in spite
of the extreme sensitivity of the
issues.
"(The talk] combined a concern
for the possibly negative implica
tions of affirmative action with
some suggestions for what could be
done," Emmerson said. "It was de

scriptive, analytic and prescriptive
all at once. 1 think Dr. Musa is in a
unique situation in that he has a
Malaysian background, history,
education and expertise but lives in
California and is able to switch back
and forth between the two worlds
to make recommendations."
Senior Terence Chia said he felt
less optimistic about the possibili
ties for change.
"I grew up understanding affir
mative action as inequitable and
lacking in quality, so this talk shed
light on the good results that affir
mative action brought about,"
("hia said. "But it seems that
there's a lot of political uncertainty
in Malaysia's future. I le's saying
'do what you can,' but I'm not sure
what you can do."
