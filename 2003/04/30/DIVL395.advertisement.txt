"The Enigmatic Treasure of Mir ZaKa"
Stanford University, Piggott Hall, Building 260, Room 113
Mir ZqKq is located about 50Km North East of Cardez in Eastern Afghanistan. There a water source delivered in
1947 and again in 1953 a considerable treasure of 12 868 coins as well as some archaeological objects made of
precious metals. About 46 years later in 1992. as the civil war was raging throughout the country one heard
again of Mir ZaKa. Once more the water source delivered as it was being excavated illegally. The rest of the
treasure was found. But this time it was not about 12 000 coins that were found but 4 tons of coins dating
from as early as the Achaemenid period (VI century B.C) up to the Kushan period (111 century A O). In addition
to this immense and fabulous treasure about SOO Kg of toreutic objects and silverware in precious metals were
unearthed.
Most of the Mir ZaKa coins were published as originating from Pakistani sites and a large part of the toreutic
treasure was published as originating from the region of the Oxus. Dr Tarzi will share with us the findings of his
research to unveil the mystery of this enigmatic and grand treasure of Gardez.

"The Diplomacy of Art: Luxury Goods and an International Style' in the
Eastern Mediterranean and Near East, 1400-1200 8.C."
Stanford University, Bldg. 380, Room 380 C (Math Corner)
Situated at the nexus of Asia, Africa, and Europe, the area of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East has
always been a mosaic of interconnected cultures. During the Late Bronze Age (1400-1200 BCE), the web of
relations reached an unprecedented extent, with rulers from the major regions (Babylonia, Assyria, Mittani,
Hatti and Egypt) corresponding with one another through the lingua franca of Acadian These letters docu
ment a system of interrelations based on reciprocity and parity, which was accompanied by the exchange of
sumptuous gifts. During this same time, an international style' of artistic production can be seen among luxury
objects from around the area This talk explores the role such an international style' played within an interna
tional realm of diplomacy, suggesting that it was consciously conceived and actively deployed by both the
greater and lesser powers of the time
(Slide-illustrated lectures free and open to the public.)
