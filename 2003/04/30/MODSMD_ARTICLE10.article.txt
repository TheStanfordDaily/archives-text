FALLUJAH, Iraq (AP) —U.S. paratroopers
fired on anti-American protesters during a night
time demonstration, and a hospital reported Tues
day that 13 Iraqis were killed and 75 wounded, in
cluding three young boys. Soldiers said armed men
had mixed into the crowd and fired at them from
nearby buildings.
T he deaths outside a school in Fallujah, a conser
vative Sunni Muslim city and Baath Party strong
hold 30 miles west of the capital, highlighted the
tense and precarious balance as Americans try to
keep the peace in Iraq.
Americans and Iraqis gave sharply differing ac
counts of Monday night's shooting. U.S. forces in

sisteel they opened fire only upon armed men — in
filtrators among the protest crowd, according to Col.
Arnold Bray, commanding officer of the Ist Battal
ion, 325 Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division,
whose troops were involved in the shooting.
"Which school kids carry AK-475?" Bray asked.
"I'm 100 percent certain the persons we shot at were
armed."
Protesters insisted their demonstration was un
armed and peaceful.
Dr. Ahmed Ghandim al-Ali, director of Fallujah's
general hospital, said the clash killed 13 Iraqis and
injured about 75. The dead included three boys ages
8 to 10, he said.

Some residents put the death toll higher, at 15.
Survivors said the dead were buried quickly Tues
day morning, in accord with Islamic custom.
No Americans were injured.
The shooting was the third reported fatal
clash involving U.S. troops and Iraqi protesters
in two weeks, underscoring the problems sol
diers face as they try to switch from fighting to
peacekeeping.
On April 15 and 16, Marines opened fire during
angry demonstrations in the northern city of Mosul.
Iraqis said 17 people were killed there, though de
tails remained unclear and the Marines insisted they
fired in self-defense.
