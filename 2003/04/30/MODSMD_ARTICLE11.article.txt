In a world where written communica
tion is exceedingly important, the
ability to construct arguments and ef
fectively and clearly communicate
through writing is an invaluable skill. A per
son's intellectual or employment capabili
ties are often judged from written docu
ments such as a personal statement in a col
lege application, a grant proposal for re
search money or a cover letter attached to a
resume.
Regrettably, this essential skill is current
ly being ignored or neglected in the educa
tion system in the United States: 75 percent
of high school seniors pass through history
classes without ever writing an essay and
only 60 percent regularly receive short
paper assignments in their English classes.
These are some of the findings released in a
recent report by the National Commission
on Writing in America's Schools and Col
leges, an 18-member panel of educators or
ganized by the College Board. Another
study conducted in 2002 found that a sub
stantial proportion of California college stu
dents could not evaluate arguments, syn
thesize facts or write essays that were gener
ally free of grammatical errors.
While many students enjoy writing, the
difficult and often-lengthy task of research
ing and constructing a term paper can be
daunting for students to undertake — and
for the teachers, professors or teaching as
sistants to grade. Thus, in many high
schools and colleges, longer papers are cut
from the curriculum because of the laige
numbers of students in the classes. Instruc
tors may be wary of assigning longer re
search papers if the student-to-teacher ratio
is large. Even if such papers are assigned,
students may receive little feedback or help
fill criticism on their work.
Students begin their Stanford educa
tions with varying levels of writing aptitude,
having taken different types and levels of
English instruction in high school. In a re
cent Faculty Senate meeting, Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education John Brav
man remarked that "Students enter [Stan
ford] whose writing, frankly, is scary," telling
die senate that "it is our job to bring them
along."
Hie University currently requires that
students take either one or two quarters of
the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
courses, PWR, depending on AP or IB En
glish scores. The small number of students
in the class allows the professor to closely
work with each pupil in developing and re
fining her or his writing skills. While these
writing classes are often helpful and essen
tial, many students and professors have re
marked that the current requirements are

not sufficient. After completing these re
quirements, students may take many cours
es before ever encountering another term
paper or liefore having the opportunity to
take another small class where they can re
ceive constant feedback and help on their
writing.
There are certainly changes in the un
dergraduate requirements University ad
ministrators can make to improve the sit
uation, thereby ameliorating the writing
skills of Stanford students. Freshman year,
students are required to take a total of 15
units of Introduction to the Humanities
courses and only four to six units of PWR
classes. While I-Hum courses do provide
opportunities to write, the focus of the
comments and grading criteria provided
by the teaching fellows is primarily on the
literary content and does not emphasize
developing writing skills. Students usual
ly write shorter papers and few courses as
sign research papers. Furthermore, stu
dents in the I-Hum courses are usually so
swamped with heavy reading assignments
that the task of writing term papers in be
tween reading 200 to 400 pages of classic
works each week can lead to hurried and
careless writing.
The University should consider increas
ing the number of required writing units
and instead only require that students take
one or two quarters of I-Hum courses. In
these smaller courses, students in the first
year would have the ability to continue to
receive feedback on their papers from pro
fessors who would have the time and ener
gy to devote a substantial amount of time to
reviewing each paper.
Additionally, aside from the WIM —
writing-in-the-major — course required by
each academic department, there are many
majors where classes offered require little
or no writing. In order for upperclassmen
to continue to refine and improve their
writing skills beyond their freshman year,
the undergraduate requirements should be
modified. General education requirement
courses could have writing requirements so
that students can practice their writing skills
in a variety of academic fields.
We realize that writing is not an easy task
for many individuals — some students
dread taking PWR or WIM courses and
would much rather work on a problem set.
However, strong writing is a requisite for
success in and outside of Stanford — from
crafting a research paper to applying to a
graduate school or perfecting cover letters
fora dream job. Increasing the writing re
quirements will help students perfect an
ability that will undoubtedly be useful
throughout their lives.

ing and constructing a term paper can be
daunting for students to undertake — and
for the teachers, professors or teaching as
sistants to grade. Thus, in many high
schools and colleges, longer papers are cut
from the curriculum because of the laige
numbers of students in the classes. Instruc
tors may be wary of assigning longer re
search papers if the student-to-teacher ratio
is large. Even if such papers are assigned,
students may receive little feedback or help
fill criticism on their work.
Students begin their Stanford educa
tions with varying levels of writing aptitude,
having taken different types and levels of
English instruction in high school. In a re
cent Faculty Senate meeting, Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education John Brav
man remarked that "Students enter [Stan
ford] whose writing, frankly, is scary," telling
die senate that "it is our job to bring them
along."
Hie University currently requires that
students take either one or two quarters of
the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
courses, PWR, depending on AP or IB En
glish scores. The small number of students
in the class allows the professor to closely
work with each pupil in developing and re
fining her or his writing skills. While these
writing classes are often helpful and essen
tial, many students and professors have re
marked that the current requirements are

not sufficient. After completing these re
quirements, students may take many cours
es before ever encountering another term
paper or liefore having the opportunity to
take another small class where they can re
ceive constant feedback and help on their
writing.
There are certainly changes in the un
dergraduate requirements University ad
ministrators can make to improve the sit
uation, thereby ameliorating the writing
skills of Stanford students. Freshman year,
students are required to take a total of 15
units of Introduction to the Humanities
courses and only four to six units of PWR
classes. While I-Hum courses do provide
opportunities to write, the focus of the
comments and grading criteria provided
by the teaching fellows is primarily on the
literary content and does not emphasize
developing writing skills. Students usual
ly write shorter papers and few courses as
sign research papers. Furthermore, stu
dents in the I-Hum courses are usually so
swamped with heavy reading assignments
that the task of writing term papers in be
tween reading 200 to 400 pages of classic
works each week can lead to hurried and
careless writing.
The University should consider increas
ing the number of required writing units
and instead only require that students take
one or two quarters of I-Hum courses. In
these smaller courses, students in the first
year would have the ability to continue to
receive feedback on their papers from pro
fessors who would have the time and ener
gy to devote a substantial amount of time to
reviewing each paper.
Additionally, aside from the WIM —
writing-in-the-major — course required by
each academic department, there are many
majors where classes offered require little
or no writing. In order for upperclassmen
to continue to refine and improve their
writing skills beyond their freshman year,
the undergraduate requirements should be
modified. General education requirement
courses could have writing requirements so
that students can practice their writing skills
in a variety of academic fields.
We realize that writing is not an easy task
for many individuals — some students
dread taking PWR or WIM courses and
would much rather work on a problem set.
However, strong writing is a requisite for
success in and outside of Stanford — from
crafting a research paper to applying to a
graduate school or perfecting cover letters
fora dream job. Increasing the writing re
quirements will help students perfect an
ability that will undoubtedly be useful
throughout their lives.
