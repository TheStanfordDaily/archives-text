## Reader indigestion 
### 
I have realized that one of the
greatest struggles in college
is finding a good place to
read. You know how it goes:
You have 100 pages to read by to
morrow, it's 10:30 p.m. and the
professor is threatening a pop qui/
on Melville.
Even worse, the book is "Billy
Budd." Suffice to say, you need a
place for intense concentration.
OK, that's a scary scenario, but
it is not completely hopeless. The
campus does offer some good
places to read, but the problem is
that these places are usually
packed with other people just like
you, seeking the perfect reading
spot. And more often than not,
these people and places are seem
ingly doing everything possible to
make your reading experience a
miserable one.
In order fora place to work as a
comfortable reading center, it
must have the right atmosphere.
Some people believe the Meyer Li
brary is such a place, but if you
can't stand the faint but incessant
tapping of computer keys (like me)
than you are SOL. Those Mac
geeks swarm into the Meyer Li
brary, ready and willing to type
away. The second floor of Meyer
has places to sit, but have you ever
noticed how uncomfortable the
seats are? The light green and
beige plastic chairs can get quite
unpleasant after a prolonged sit
ting.
Green Library is a better alter
native. There are various rooms
you can go into, and they are all
usually quiet. Then again, some
times the silence can be over
whelming and it can be so tempt
ing to simply rest your head down
on the table and .... zzzzz. Even
if you don't fall asleep, the inces
sant drone of the overhanging
lights starts to get to you, absolute

ly ruining your concentration.
You try to scan your 200-page eco
nomics article, but the dude down
on the other side of the room is
having a cough attack and all you
want to do is to walk over and slick
your day-glow blue highlighter
down his throat.
1 usually find the upstairs sec
tion of Bing Wing to be a decent
reading place, yet even this beauti-

ful locale has a
downside: You
can hear every
thing that goes on
outside because
the windows are
so thin. This can
be a good thing
when you want a
little noise instead

of the deafening silence so often
present in libraries, but when that
"little noise" consists of some guy
cursing somebody out over the
phone or some girls gossiping
about their crushes or their latest
party outfits at the top of their
lungs, it can become a bit distract
ing.
Having exhausted the library
possibilities, one place I finally
found to be nice little reading nook
was the second floor of Tresidder.
Sadly, this is no longer always
available — ever since they started
having those artistic, political or
cultural displays, the chairs have
been hard to come by. Plus, there
is always some group or club com
ing in with KFC or some other in
tensely odorous type of food, eat
ing and chatting it up and you wish
you could take one of those drum
sticks and shove it up . . . well, you
get the picture.
Of course, there is always The
Room. But even reading iu your
lovely oh-so-spacious one-room
double has its downfalls. Take, for
example, the buzzing piece of

technology know to yon as The
Computer. This seemingly inno
cent machine is a complete time
sucker; checking e-mails, down
loading music and Googling ran
dom ideas that come into your
head can easily take up hours of
your life. Before you know it, mid
night has arrived and you're delv
ing into orangutan living patterns
in Borneo.
Then there is The Roommate
— even if you're best friends, this
person lives with you night and
day. 1 le or slit' might be busy play
ing a game on the computer or
playing some incredibly lame
music (despite the fact that you
listed on that damn roommate
preference form that rap music
was not acceptable to your poor
ears), and all of a sudden you find
yourself going crazy because the
sounds of exploding tankers and
50 Cent rapping are digging into
your brain.
At least in The R<x>m 1 can avoid
those annoying übiquitous cell
phone conversations that everyone
seems to start every time I pull out
a book. The story is always the
same: You're reading and some
one's phone goes off — usually a
very irritating ring — that becomes
louder as the person pulls the
phone out from his backpack or her
purse. Then comes the decisive
moment: They will either turn the
phone off or answer it. I really don't
care to hear about some woman's
dinner plans or some guy's trauma
tizing breakup with his girlfriend,
so hopefully the person won't an
swer. But more often than not, peo
ple insist on discussing every aspect
of their personal lives in public —
anywhere, anytime — and you're
unfortunately caught up in their
conversation.
