Dining Services should provide consistent
prices throughout the year
1 was disappointed to find thai I lousing
and Dining Services raised the prices of a
significant number of the Late Night
menu items at the beginning of this week.
The cost of several hot-selling items in
creased by 20 to 25 percent. This move in
the middle of the quarter devalues stu
dents' buying power and undermines stu
dent budgeting.
Students who have the 12 meals plus
points plan are allotted a specific number of
points at the beginning of the quarter. The
services that students thought they were
buying when they paid for their meal plans
were significantly reduced weeks later.
Though this move may be allowed by
the restricting dining contracts that all res
idents of the dormitories must follow, 1 be
lieve it is an unethical business practice. I
realize that Dining Services lias to turn a
profit, but it should have raised prices
when students still bad a chance to change
their plans. Stanford students should be
afforded the rights of consumers: To
make educated choices about their ex
panses without fear that their binding con

tracts will be suddenly and quietly be
changed.

SLAC and the Coalition for Labor Justice
adopt several tactics to advocate for
living wages
In the talks were flawed" edito
rial (April 28), The Daily argued that
"labor activists" have offered "only one so
lution" to campus labor issues — "in
creased unionization." As representatives
of the Stanford Labor Action Coalition, we
would like to correct many of the mischar
acterizations of our campaign, not the least
of which is that the University living-wage
campaign represents a "resolution."
Over the last two academic years,
SLAC and the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice have urged the University to adopt a
code of conduct for labor relations on
campus. Rather than support the Uni
versity's wage policy that is restricted to
a very limited number of campus work
ers, we advocate a comprehensive ap
proach to addressing not only wage and
benefit levels, but also include assur
ances of the right to unionize, educa
tional opportunities and an end to sub

contracting, which undermines current
labor standards.
These four principles are the thrust of
our campaign. From these principles we
have drafted a proposed code of conduct
policy, but rather than advocating its im
mediate endorsement from President
John Hennessy, we have repeatedly asked
him to meet with students and workers to
work together fora comprehensive and
feasible code of conduct. Thus, contrary
to the editorial, parking passes for campus
workers are not a central demand in our
campaign.
We join The Daily in commending the
University for its first steps in acknowledg
ing the deficiencies in existing campus
labor policy. But we also agree with The
Daily that it is not enough. The University
policy is very limited in its application to
workers, restricting the "living wage" to
non-unionized workers working fora sub
contractor with a contract with the Uni
versity of over $ I ()(),()()().
But it is not clear how many workers
this policy will affect, as the University has
not released the exact number of workers
that are encompassed by the living-wage
policy. Furthermore, we fell that the Uni
versity's approach to feedback was insuffi
cient and insincere.
Again, our position is that workers and
students should fx* a part of the proc ess of

crafting campus labor policy, following the
model adopted by 1 farvard in 2001.
Most of all, labor struggles at Stanford
are not over. The janitors who clean our
academic buildings still make $ 1.50 or less
per hour than the University's living wage.
The contract of these workers expires
today. Now the University has an oppor
tunity to demonstrate its stated commit
ment to a campus living wage.
It is our belief that Stanford continues
to exploit temporary workers on cam
pus, many of whom have worked for
years at Stanford with neither benefits
nor job security. The University has not
renounced its practice of subcontracting
workers who were formerly directly
hired, which can result in sharp drops in
the wages and benefits of workers on
campus. Workers who are directly hired
by tlie University will be negotiating a
new contract this summer, working to
address the University's reliance on sub
contracted and temporary workers.
Keeping this in mind, we are at a critical
juncture for action.
Finally, while SI AC absolutely affirms
the importance of unions in advocating for
workers' tights, increased unionization is
not the solution we offer. Rather, we are
looking to Hennessy to take the lead and
commit to comprehensive labor standards
for workers on campus. We invite any in

terested students to find out more about
labor issues on campus and the code of
conduct campaign during our Labor
Awareness Days, which will begin at noon
tomorrow in White Plaza.

Gender noncomformity
a distinction between
heterosexuals and homosexuals
Northwestern University Prof. Bailey's
message discussed in Joan Roughgarden's
column "Psychology lecture lacks sensitiv
ity to sexual orientation" (April 25) may
seem to promote an inaccurate stereotype
to many people, but in my opinion, it does
accurately reflect a key difference that dis
tinguishes gays and straights: gender non
conformity. That difference between the
two sexual orientations has been repeated
ly shown in the scientific literature and
(onfiimed by researchers who are gay
themselves — including noted brain re
searcher Dr. Simon LeVay.
