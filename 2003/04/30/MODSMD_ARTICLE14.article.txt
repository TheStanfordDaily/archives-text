# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Armenian genocide an important, complicated historical event 
### KIVANC KARAMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
By the end of WWI, Eastern Anatolia,
where the Muslims and Armenians had
lived together fora thousand years, was in
ruins and the population had been deci
mated. After 85 years, the debate on the
events still continues in the public sphere,
including the Stanford campus.
Before writing this column, I went
through the articles published on behalf of
the Armenian Student Association in The
Daily over the past few years and found that
the main message is that the United States
Congress has the obligation to pass a reso
lution recognizing the Armenian Genocide
and Stanford students should take all avail
able actions to ensure that.
The Turkish Republic, founded after
the fall of the ()ttomans, expressed its grief
numerous times for the Armenians who
died during the war. The real debate is
about something that our Armenian
friends briefly touch upon; whether the Ot
toman government had an official policy of
genocide. 1 heir extensive references to the
Holocaust create the impression that the
Armenian Genocide had similar methods
and goals and is just as undisputed as the
I lolocaust, but this is not the case. Below. I

provide some historical evidence that may
enable a better assessment and will hope
fully initiate a more informed and con
structive discourse with our Armenian
friends.
When the age of empires was over, ex
cept for the Armenian empire, all Christian
nations of the Ottoman Empire gained
their independence following national up
risings. The Armenian independence
movement started somewhat later than
other nations, around (lie 1880s, mostly be
cause the former were much more inte
grated into the Ottoman society and had a
privileged position among the non-Muslim
populations of the empire. Still, the main
reason why the events did not follow the
same course was demographic. Armenians
were dispersed all over Anatolia and Istan
bul, and even in Eastern Anatolia, they
were a minority.
When WW I began, Armenians formed
troops to help the Russian advance in Ana
tolia. Large-scale uprisings in different
parts of Anatolia created panic in the rear of
the Turkish army. By February 1915, the
local Muslim and Armenian populations in
the country were in a c ivil war, and, in April,
the Ottomans were pulling back from the
Eastern front and the Armenians were in
control of certain provinces. At the end of

April, the Ottomans gave the first order for
"relocation." The following months wit
nessed the plight of Armenians: As they
were transported to Syrian provinces of the
empire, they were killed by attacks of local
Muslims, gangs, hunger and epidemics â€”
as well as the difficulties of moving through
mountains and deserts of the region. In the
provinces under Armenian control, atroci
ties of similar scale were taking place, and
the Muslim population fled in huge num
bers in order to save their lives.
Prominent historians such as Bernard
Lewis (who has suffered various insults be
cause of his scholarly opinion) and Stanford
Shaw claim there was no official policy of
genocide. The claim is based on the fact that
the comprehensive Ottoman archives con
tain no documents suggesting such a plan.
The reports of misconduct by soldiers and
civil servants almost always mention them
in the context of how such behavior should
be and is penalized; we have accounts of
1 ,397 officers being punished, highlighting
the absurdity of any comparison with the
Holocaust. Furthermore, the relocations
began only after the Russian and Armenian
armies began to move into Anatolia and
were mostly confined to the region around
the line of lighting.
After the Ottomans lost the war, the

British High Commission in Istanbul arrest
eel 144 high Ottoman officials and deported
them to Malta for trial on charges of harm
ing the Armenians. While the deportees
were interned on Malta, the British ap
pointed an Armenian scholar, I laig Kliaz
arian, to conduct a thorough examination
of the Ottoman, British and U.S. records to
substantiate the charges. Though granted
complete access to all records, Khazarian's
corps of investigators discovered an utter
lack of evidence demonstrating that the Ot
toman officials either sanctioned or encour
aged killings of Armenians. The British
Procurator Ceneral exonerated and re
leased all 144 detainees.
A state is responsible for the protection
of all its subjects, even if they are insurgent.
Moreover, many Armenians had nothing
to do with the events. The Ottoman gov
ernment deserves blame for not dealing
with the atrocities committed en route or in
providing safe passage to those it was force
fully relocating. The official Turkish argu
ment cites the conditions of the empire on
the verge of collapse. The government au
thority in most of that area was limited to a
network of alliances with Turkish and Kur
dish warlords. These and other similar facts
cannot justify the huge human toll, but give
a clearer picture of the war conditions.

The Encyclopedia Britannica reports an
estimated Armenian death toll of 600,000,
A fact that is not often publicized is that
more than a million Anatolian Muslims
perished during the events because of sim
ilar reasons: migration, disease, famine and
atrocities committed by the Armenians.
The Armenians wanted their homeland,
but so did the Muslims. When the cycle of
iuteicommunal violence ended, the whole
region was desolated.
In the words of 61 prominent academi
cians, "The weight of evidence so far un
covered points in the direction of serious
inter communal warfare (perpetrated by
Muslim and Christian irregular forces),
complicated by disease, famine, suffering
and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining
areas during the First World War."
This is not the conclusion one would
prefer to reach. The official genocide story
would be much easier to accept in terms of
the burden on our collective conscience. It
would let us put the blame on a group of
government officers who masterminded
the evil, loathe them and move on. Never
theless, the truth is rarely so simple.
