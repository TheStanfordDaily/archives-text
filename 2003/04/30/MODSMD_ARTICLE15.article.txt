## Baseball 'embarrassed' by Broncos 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While No. 9 Stanford hoped to roll
through a fairly easy April schedule, the
Cardinal's month ended just how it
began, with a disappointing — or, as head
coach Mark Marquess called it, an "em
barrassing" — non-conference loss at
Sunken Diamond.
Santa Clara held the Cardinal to just
four hits in a 2-0 victory, marking the first
time Stanford has been shut out this sea
son.
Just like the University of San Francis
co on April 1, former Stanford assistant
Mark O'Brien's Broncos (25-22, 16-5
West Coast Conference) outplayed the
Cardinal (28-14, 10-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) to beat Stanford for only the second
time in 27 tries.
Understandably, Marquess was far
from pleased with his team's lackluster
performance.
"You know what, it was just embarrass
ing," he said. "It wasn't disappointing, it

was embarrassing."
Coming 20 years to the day after for
mer Chicago Cubs manager Lee Elia
blasted fans at Wrigley Field as part of an
infamous tirade, Marquess' words were
both cleaner and shorter, but just as
damning.
1 lis players have now lost three of four
games and are reeling heading into a piv
otal conference series with Southern Cali
fornia.
After being told the night marked
O'Brien's 50th win as Santa Clara head
coach, Marquess' "embarrassment" un
characteristically kept him from even ut
tering a kind word for his former col
league.
"I don't care whose win it was, it was
embarrassing for us," he said, repeating
the sentence twice.
O'Brien's familiarity with the Stanford
program made the win even more satisfy
ing for him and his team, now surging after

a weekend sweep and last night's win.
"Any time you come into Stanford Uni
versity and Sunken Diamond and you get
a win, it's huge for your program,"
O'Brien said. "They set the standard for
college baseball, that's the bottom line."
Santa Clara ux>k advantage of Stanford's
miscues in the field and its lack of concen
tration at the plate, scoring two third-inning
runs and making them hold up with the ef
forts of eight Bronco pitchers.
With two on and two out in the top of
the third, center fielder Sam Fuld mis
played an RBI single by Santa Clara'sjack
Headley, allowing a second run to score.
Stanford starter Tim Cunningham ex
ited after just 2 2/3 innings, making way
for an effective relief corps whose solid
work came in vain.
Keeping with his visibly angry post
game tone, Marquess couldn't even take
comfort in his four relievers' three-hit
performance over the final six and one
third innings.

Junior Sam Fuld attempts to lay down a bunt in last night's 2-0 loss at home to Santa Clara. The
Cardinal was held hitiess until the sixth inning and was shut out for the first time this season.
"There is no bright side," Mar
quess said.
I he Cardinal offense could not
take advantage of eight walks through
the fii"st five innings and could not
muster a base hit until the sixth.
"To be honest with you, I was
very surprised [with Stanford's
poor offensive showing]," O'Brien
said. "That is one heck of an offen
sive team, and they are one of the
best in the country. But that was a
pretty good team effort from our
guys."
Both teams, mired in their own
tight conference races with critical
upcoming series on Friday, seemed
disinterested in the game and com
bined for just nine hits on a chilly
Tuesday night before a sparse
Sunken crowd of just a few hun

dred.
But the Broncos left with the vic
tory and Marquess with a sour taste
in his mouth.
Epitomizing his team's effort
was a disastrous double play in the
fourth. With two men on and one
out, junior Brian Hall's ground ball
to the pitcher turned into a run
down of sophomore Danny Put
nam between third and home.
Sophomore Donny Lucy raced
to take third and the bizarre play —
and the inning — came to an end
with both men on third base being
tagged out by pitcher Andrew
Slorp to complete an unconven
tional double play that had Mar
quess fuming in the dugout.
Asked what his team must do to
rebound against the Trojans in Los
Angeles this weekend, Marquess
replied:
"I don't know. I don't know.
Embarrassed, embarrassing per
formance."

Cardinal was held hitiess until the sixth inning and was shut out for the first time this season.
"There is no bright side," Mar
quess said.
I he Cardinal offense could not
take advantage of eight walks through
the fii"st five innings and could not
muster a base hit until the sixth.
"To be honest with you, I was
very surprised [with Stanford's
poor offensive showing]," O'Brien
said. "That is one heck of an offen
sive team, and they are one of the
best in the country. But that was a
pretty good team effort from our
guys."
Both teams, mired in their own
tight conference races with critical
upcoming series on Friday, seemed
disinterested in the game and com
bined for just nine hits on a chilly
Tuesday night before a sparse
Sunken crowd of just a few hun

dred.
But the Broncos left with the vic
tory and Marquess with a sour taste
in his mouth.
Epitomizing his team's effort
was a disastrous double play in the
fourth. With two men on and one
out, junior Brian Hall's ground ball
to the pitcher turned into a run
down of sophomore Danny Put
nam between third and home.
Sophomore Donny Lucy raced
to take third and the bizarre play —
and the inning — came to an end
with both men on third base being
tagged out by pitcher Andrew
Slorp to complete an unconven
tional double play that had Mar
quess fuming in the dugout.
Asked what his team must do to
rebound against the Trojans in Los
Angeles this weekend, Marquess
replied:
"I don't know. I don't know.
Embarrassed, embarrassing per
formance."
