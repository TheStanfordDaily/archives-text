# Seki leads golf into final round
## Senior tied for first, Cardinal in third at Pac-10 Championships 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After struggling throughout the regu
lar season, the Stanford men's golf team is
■adjusting quite nicely to the supposed
pressures of postseason play. The team
begins today's final round at the Paciflc
-10 Conference Championship in third
place overall, 11 strokes off the lead of
No. 5 UCLA.
The format of the championship is a bit dif
ferent from that of regular-season play. Each
team bring six players to the event (instead of
the normal five), taking the best live scores from
each round to make up the team score.
On Monday, the team started out quickly —
something it has failed to do in most of its tour
naments this year.
In the first round, the Cardinal rode the
strong play of freshman Kyle Gentry. In one of
his best rounds of the year, Gentry shot a 2-
under-par 70 to tie for the individual lead after
18 holes.
Unfortunately for Gentry and the Cardinal,
his second-round score was disqualified after
he accidentally signed an incorrect scorecard.
Although he is eliminated from the individual
competition, Gentry's scores may still be used
toward the team total.
Senior Jim Seki matched Gentry's first
round 70, following it up with a one-under-par
71 in the afternoon. The defending Pac-10
champion then fired a round of even par on

Tuesday and is currently in a familiar place, tied
for the tournament lead with UCLA's John
Merrick.
"I learned some things [during last year's
tournament]," Seki said. "I just have to stay pa
tient and play solidly."
Behind Seki's lead, the Cardinal has stuck to
gether through two days. Senior Ron Won shot
back-to-back rounds of 74 on Monday and card
ed a four-over par 76 on Tuesday. With a three
round total of 224, Won is tied for 21st place
overall.
Junior Blake Mastalir is just one shot behind
his teammate. After starting Tuesday's round
with a birdie, Mastalir was 6-over par for his
next 11 holes, ending up in 25th place at the
end of the day.
"It's playing a lot like Pasatiempo," Mastalir
said. "The greens are slick and the rough is re
ally deep."
One stroke behind Mastalir is his sopho
more teammate Kevin Blue. Blue shot a solid
round of 71 on Monday afternoon, but gave
some shots back to the field on Tuesday with
a 77. He begins today's final round in a tie for
26th place.
Rounding out the scoring for the Cardi
nal is senior George Downing. He might
be a lot happier if he didn't have to play
the par-3 14th hole, as he is a collective 4-
over par on that hole through three
rounds.
After a 75 on Tuesday, Downing is tied for
35th place individually.
"It's a course where you have to be hitting the
ball well to score," Downing said. "If you lose
your focus or hit the ball poorly, it can really pe
nalize vou."
