# Card softball feeling fresh
## Morris, Lappin are shining in their first year on the Farm 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ihe No. 15 Stanford softball team (35-
20, 5-10) started this year's season with
out some familiar faces Cardinal fans had
come to recognize and rely on to make a
clutch play or produce a key hit.
The graduation of former Stanford
stars Jessica Mendoza, Sarah Beeson,
and Robin Walker left a void that would
have to be filled if the Cardinal was to get
back to the NCAA tournament this sea
son.
Mendoza was a pioneer for the Stan
ford softball program, becoming the first
Cardinal player to become a first-team All-
American as a freshman. She went on to
repeat the feat in all four of her years in
center field.
The current National Team member
is the Stanford all-time leader in batting
average (.432), hits (321), doubles (70),
triples (9), home runs (49), runs scored
(225) and stolen bases (83).
After four years of glory, it was hard to
imagine Cardinal softball without Men
doza wielding a bat, patrolling the field
and on the base paths but as the 2003 sea
son took off, the Cardinal's fresh face in
center field started right where the old
one left off.
Freshman Catalina Morris stepped
into center field the first inning of the
first game and has played in all 55 games
since, committing just two errors.

She is also one half of the freshmen
duo t hat leads Stanford at the plate head
ing into tonight's non-conference game
with Saint Mary's (5-14) on the Farm.
The Arizona nat ive is currently hitting
.346 with 56 hits, 10 doubles, two triples,
and seven homeruns.
Morris* fellow freshman phenom is
shortstop Lauren Lappin. The Southern
California star came to Stanford as a
highly touted recruit and has not disap
pointed in her freshman campaign.
Like Morris, Lappin had some big
shoes to fill, as Walker was the stabilizing
force in the infield for the previous four
years.
The Junior National Team has been
up to the challenge and 27 has quickly
become a number for opposing pitchers
to fear. Lappin leads the Cardinal with a
.376 hitting average and .446 on base
percentage and also leads the team with
eight sacrifice bunts.
"As far as just positions being filled
Catalina and Lauren have really stepped
up," saifl coach John Kittman. "As fresh
men they have really come in and shown
that they can compete at any level."
Beyond their natural ability, the Car
dinal coaching staff has also been im
pressed with the pair's determination to
improve and succeed.
"They are two kids that come to work
every day with the same approach and
work extremely hard every day," Rittman
said. "11 icy have both had some hard times
this year, but have really bounced back in
lx>th instances."
That ability to bounce back will have to
show tonight as the Cardinal is coming
off a weekend in which it beat No. 5
Washington 8-0 before suffering two
one-run defeats at No. 2 UCLA.

Freshman shortstop Lauren Lappin leads the Cardinal in batting this season. Her
steady plav, along with the impressive statistics of fellow freshman Catalina Mor
-ris, has helped fill the void left by last year's departed seniors.
