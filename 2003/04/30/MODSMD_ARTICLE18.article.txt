# Mixing it up to get pumped up
## 
### 
Every guy has one. It's that simple. Every guy
has his own version, his own style, his own
essence. Some say it doesn't matter, that the
whole person is much more important. Some
say size matters, or how and when they use it, or how it
affects their mojo.
Personally, I'm in agreement with all the high school
English teachers around this country: it's quality, not
quantity that dictates success.
But the point is, whether in existing form, or just a
dream floating around in his mind, every male athlete,
and certainly many women, shares this commonality.
Get your mind out of the gutter, I'm not lowa State's
Larry Eustachy. (The Cyclone basketball coach got

caught in pictures at a Mizzou house
party spittin' game at 19-year-old
bombshells, holding cans of Natty
Lite)
I'm talking about pump-up mixes.
Nothing, save perhaps a slew of
other more important factors, decides
victory more than the pre-game moti
vational tape.
Seriously though, it is important

and can decide the outcome in an otherwise knotted
game. Motivation, heart and desire are all deciding fac
tors in games; the mix can get you there.
And to reference "High Fidelity" in a second column
(you know the first...), let Nick Hornby (John Cusack)
tell you about mix tapes.
"A good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard
to do and takes ages longer than it might seem. You
gotta kick off with a killer, to hold the attention. Then
you have to take it up a notch, but not blow your wad,
so maybe cool it off a notch, and you can't put the same
artist twice on the tape, except if some subtle point or
lesson or theme involved, and even then not the two of
them in a row ... oh, there are a lot of rules."
So without further ado, 1 give you my "Game Day"
mix, from start to finish.
Track 1: My Heart Goes Boom (A French Affair). This
song is all that is pure about European techno-pop.
With stunning lyrics like "I'm walking down the street
and my heart goes boom!" and an inspiring bass line,
this song gets tilings started with a bang, nay, a boom.
Track 2: Da Rockwildsr (Method Man and Redman).
This rap masterpiece takes it up a level from the inane
French affair. Make sure you yell out "DaCow" at the
wrong time and look like a total idiot. Nothing gains you
locker room respect like bad rapping.
Track 3: Ich I she Fur Hip Hop (I) J Tomekk). No, I'm
not joking. I don't care if DJ Tomekk has only done
stuff with Shaq after this song — that's irrelevant. The
point is that this (ierman rap will get you pumped up
like only incomprehensible German crowd choruses
can.
Track 4: Jurass Finish First (Jurassic 5). It's time to
bring it down a notch and put some bounce in your
step. Drop the needle on this track and you'll l)e danc
ing by the second minute. Or maybe that's just me. OK,
its just me.
Track 5: Eye of the Tiger (Survivor). It's a classic. 'Nuff
said.
Track 6: Dream (hi (Aerosmith). Don't give me any of
this "I don't wanna miss a thing" bullcrap, this is Aero
smith's best song, and certainly their most inspirational.
Learn it, Live it, Love it.
Track 7: Welcome to the Teiradottw (Public Enemy). If
you have had the pleasure of seeing Sports Center's
"Plays of the First 20,000 Sports Centers", this song will
only remind you of every great play, coach and player
that has ever occurred in the last 20 years of sports.
"Dream On" is the soundtrack on another similar
ESPN highlight reel, but "Terradome" defines the
genre. Watch the video. Listen to the song. Don't for
get to breathe.
Track 8: Ijose Yourself (Eminem). This is the most re
cent addition to the list, but it is well-deserved. If you
haven't heard this song, let me tell you about a kid
named Leßron.

Track 9: Pachabel's Canon in D
(Mo/art). Center yourself.
Track 10: J ump Around (House
of Pain). One of the hokier choic
es on this mix, but it has a special
place in my heart thanks to the
line "1 got more rhymes than the
Bible's got Psalms." But careful,
these guys are from Boston.
Track 11: Song No. 2 (Blur).
This is your last chance to get psy
ched, so get all your "whoo-hoos"

out before it all comes to a close.
Track 12: Rudy: The Final Gaiiw.
This is the single greatest instru
mental ever. No question. If this
doesn't get you pumped, stop read
ing, because nothing 1 tell you will
be of any consequence.
So there you go, my top 12
pump-up songs. Sony for the lack
of current-eventness of this column,
but that's what you get sometimes.
