team salvaged its trip to the East Coast with a
decisive 13-2 victory over Colgate yesterday
afternoon in the Cardinal's regular season fi
nale.

Tuesday: No. 15 Stanford 13, Colgate 2

Meanwhile, the Stanford offense was in
high gear from the opening faceofF. A goal by
sophomore Nina Pantano just four minutes
into the game broke a scoreless tie and started
an 8-0 Cardinal run.
The score remained that way for the next
10 minutes, as neither team was able to con
vert scoring chances into goals, before Rebec
ca Sandler finally responded with the Raiders'
only point of the half.
The Raiders' only other goal came by
virtue of a Stanford penalty. Becky Ortalano

posted the second Colgate goal on a free posi
tion shot taken eight meters from the goal.
The first half was much the same as the first
with Stanford in control. The Cardinal added
five second-half goals to close out the scoring.
Pantano and sophomore Claire Calzonetti
tallied four goals apiece for the Cardinal.
Freshman Megan Burker added three goals
and sophomore Kelsey Twist and junior Abbi
Hills each chipped in one for the Cardinal.
Stanford outshot the Raiders 35-12.
Stanford will host the MPLL tournament
this Saturday and Sunday after capturing the
regular season title with an unblemished 4-0
record in league play.
