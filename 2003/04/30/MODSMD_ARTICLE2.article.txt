## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Former National Security
Adviser /bigniew Brzezinski fo
cused on the future of U.S-
China relations last night in an
amusing and analytical speech
at Memorial Auditorium. He
addressed the stability of rela
tions between the powers in the
context of future domestic and
international conditions.
Brzezinksi broke the issue
into four components: project
ing the shape of the world in
years to come; analyzing the di
rection of current Chinese for
eign policy; discussing the do
mestic situation now faced by
China's population; and decon
structing what must be done in
order to reach slated goals for
Sino-American interaction.
" This is an enormous subject,

and with it comes enormous un
certainty about the future,"
Brzezinksi said. "This is mostly
because of the enormous con
trast between the China that ex
isted then and the China we
know now."
Many of his points rested on
the status of China 25 years ago,
when Brzezinski was President
Jimmy Carter's National Securi
ty Adviser. According to
Brzezinksi, the Cold War led the
United States to rely on China
for intelligence cooperation
against the Soviet Union, and
since that time the relationship
between the two nations has
been defined by normalcy.
Brzezinksi began by predicting
that the European Union, Japan,
Russia and India will be unable to
increase their global power in the
future relative to the U.S.
"Unless one anticipates funda
mental discontinuities, America
will still be not only a superpower,
but likely the only superpower,"
he said.
According to Brzezinksi, all
other nations in the world lack
these attributes, as well as the far
reaching influence and appeal of
the American lifestyle, something
that allows the United States to act
as an independent global authority.
"China will be a significant re
gional power, but not global," lie
said. "It will be an increasingly im
portant player, and more of an inde
pendent player than any other coun
try in the world besides tiie U.S."
While Brzezinksi placed em
phasis on China's still-antiquated
infrastructure and drastic socioe
conomic divisions, he commented
that it will likely expand its sphere
of influence into Central Asia and
the Koreas.
"The U.S.-Chinese relationship
has become nuanced, and both
sides want to infuse it with as much
normality as possible," he said.
Stating that the future of rela
tions will be defined by local con
flict in a system of overall global
stability, Brzezinksi added that the
United States and China still have
different interests on the issues of
Taiwan, human rights, trade and
arms proliferation.
Nevertheless, he stressed that
none of these minor conflicts are
extensive enough to upset the
countries' current stability.
"After 9-11, the U.S.-Chinese re
lationship developed as they real
ized they would now need to coop
erate with one another," Brzezinksi

said. "Ideological issues are no
longer central to the antagonistic
aspects of their relationship."
While he remarked that the
common threat posed by North
Korea and international terrorism
may facilitate positive interaction
between the United States and
China, Brzezinski also admitted
that it is important to acknowledge
the opposing stance assumed by
the Chinese concerning the con
flict in Iraq.
According to Brzezinksi, Taiwan
is also a sensitive area that must be
taken into account. At the current
time, he said, "China and the U.S.
are agreeing to disagree" on the
issue.
Domestically, Brzezinksi said
that "there is awareness within the
Chinese leadership of the social
and regional inequality" that exists
throughout the nation. He also
said that while the communist gov
ernment is deeply entrenched in
its own political culture, it has also
become largely symbolic.
"How can a government that
identifies itself as communist be
reconciled with widespread so
cioeconomic change based large
ly in capitalism?" he said. "It is a
crisis of self-image, and resolu
tion will require a lot of imagina
tion and skill on behalf of the
government."
Brzezinksi's speech kicked oil
three days of events addressing dif
ferent aspects of U.S.-China rela
tions presented by the Forum for
American / Chinese Exchange at
Stanford in partnership with sever
al other campus organizations.
The conference will continue
tomorrow at 10 a.m. with a panel
discussion on China's entry into
the WTO, and on Thursday with
a panel 011 the role of the media
in defining Sino-American inter
action.
