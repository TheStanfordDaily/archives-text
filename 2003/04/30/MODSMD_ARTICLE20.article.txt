Calcium-Rich Diet May Keep Away the Fat

Diets rich in calcium not only help
strengthen bones and teeth but may
also help ward off obesity. The find
ings were presented two weeks ago at
a mjut;{Ung of the American Society for
Nutritional Sciences. The study from
the (jniversity of Hawaii tracked 321
girls from the ages of 9 to 14. The
girls consuming more calcium
weighed less and had less abdominal

fat those consuming less calcium. The authors
fouiid that the source of calcium did not matter — it
couldbe from milk, cheese or just supplements. The
researchers did verity that a healthy lifestyle still mat
tered — subjects with low-calorie, balanced diets that
exercised regularly did not suffer from obesity.
Parallel Universe
Somewhere out there another exact copy of you is
reading this exact same column. At least that is what
Max Tegmark, professor pf physics and astronomy at
the University of Pennsylvania. Tegmark is a propo
nent of the multiverse theory, which claims our uni
verse is simply one of many parallel universes. These
universes are isolated bubbles in time and space and
are inaccessible to each other. Although this sounds
like science fiction, it may be closer to the truth than
one imagines. Solid physical laws allow for multiple
universes and help explain strange behaviors that
happ<sp in our own universe, according to Tegmark.
An Overview of SARS
SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
an acute infection that begins with a fever. Other
symptoms include headaches, overall feelings of dis
comjort and body aches. After two to seven days, a
SARS patient may develop a dry cough and have
trouble breathing. Laboratories around the world be
lieve the cause is a new form of corono-virus that is
transmissible upon close person-to-person contact.
The Centers for Disease Control has recommended
avoiding travel to China, Singapore and Vietnam —
where the disease is most widespread. Individuals
need to consult a doctor immediately if they suspect
they have SARS.

Predicting Supernovae
Astronomers are now able to forecast to the exact day
when a star will explode. The prediction was based on
gamma-ray bursts, or high- intensity bursts of energy
preceding a supernova. A NASA telescope observed
on March 29 a GRB at 2 billion light years away, one
of the closest ever observed. A research team quickly
published a paper claiming the star would explode on
April 8, as indeed it did. This accuracy is remarkable,
givdn that previous estimates tended to be offby a mil
lion years. A supernova is a massive star explosion that
briefly releases as much energy as an entire galaxy. In
the past, supernovae could have disrupted life on
Earth but our planet is now well-protected by its at
mosphere and distance from most of these events.
Oldest DNA Identified
A tepm of scientists has found the oldest verified I)NA
from the permafrost of Siberia. The DNA belonged to
grasses, sedges and shrubs estimated to be between
300,000 and 400,000 years old. The previous record
for plants was 20,000 years and for animals is 50,000
yeafs. DNA is not a very stable molecule and tends to
degrade quickly. The scientists drilled from 2 to 30 me
ters in depth to obtain segments of preserved DNA.
Eske Willerslev, a molecular biologist at the University
of Copenhagen in Denmark who led the study, said
"We have shown that it is not necessary to have obvious
macrofossils in order to obtain genetic information
about past ecosystems." The team now plans to repeat
the experiment in caves and other permafrost regions
before trying their luck in warmer environments.
Scientists Develop Smaller, Cheaper Solar Cells
German researchers have created a new type of solar
cell that is cheaper and smaller than current devices.
The unit consists of a light-absorbing layer on top of a
porous substrate. In most commercial solar cells, the
light-absorbing material is deposited on flat sub
strates. The advantage of the pores is that stray pho
tons are scattered back into the light-absorbing layer.
Phis also allows the device to be made from smaller
quantities of lower-quality semiconductor material,
thus reducing the cost. "These findings may open the
way to less expensive processes in photovoltaics," said
Rolf Koenenkamp, who led the study and is now at
University of Portland.
