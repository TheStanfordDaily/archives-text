# First American female astronaut and Stanford alumna talks on her experience at NASA
## Promoting Women in Science and Space 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Russian Soyuz rocket docked with
the international space station this
Monday. This was the first manned
space flight since the Columbia disaster
in February this year.
Stanford alumna Sally Ride, Class of
1973, is part of the Columbia Accident
Investigation Board overseeing the in
vestigation of the accident. She dis
cussed the future of NASA, her experi
ences as a female astronaut and the
need to encourage young girls to pur
sue careers in science and technology
during a phone interview last Friday.
Ride also served on the investigation
board of the Challenger tragedy and
commented on the two experiences.
"There are significant differences,
and there are also remarkable similari
ties too [in the two crashes]," she said.
"There are differences in the struc
ture of investigations and the techni
cal nature of the accidents. The most
obvious is the Challenger accident oc
curred on launch and within just a
couple of weeks, there was good evi
dence of the precise technical cause of
the accident. The Columbia accident
occurred during re-entry, and even
now, well over 10 weeks into the acci
dent [investigation], there is no direct
evidence that can connect all the dots
to describe the technical scenario of
what happened."
On April 17, the Board issued pre
liminary recommendations stressing
pre-flight examination and in-orbit
imaging of the shuttle. However, shut
tle flights will not resume until at least
late this summer when the Board issues
its findings.
"There is going to be vigorous de
bate over the future of the space pro
gram and that's appropriate," Ride
said. "There was [debate] immediately
after Challenger, and the space pro
gram actually emerged from that
stronger than it had been before the ac
cident. I expect that vigorous discus
sion to go on once the Board issues its
recommendations on the Columbia ac
cident.
"My expectation is that the space
program will again be strengthened as
a result of the national debate that will
go on around the board's recommen
dation and the space program in gen
eral," said Ride.
Ride made her first space flight
aboard Challenger in 1983. She was the
first American female astronaut.
"When I was brought into the astro

naut program, [it was] in an astronaut
class along with 34 other people," she
said. "Of those 35 of us, six of us were
women." NASA had already committed
with our class to bring not just one
woman, but women, into the astronaut
core."
This commitment was instrumental
in her success, Ride believes.
"All of our other classmates were
very well aware of that and very sup
portive of that [goal]," Ride said.
"NASA was committed to the idea of
not just bringing women into the as
tronaut core, but having their training
be exactly the same as the training of
the men."
While she did not set out to be an as
tronaut, Ride was interested in science
and technology from a young age. She
recognizes factors that prevent women
from entering those fields and de
scribes how she overcame them.
"I had this innate interest that I

think is independent from gender," she
said. "I think I was fortunate when I was
growing up not to run into any obsta
cles or overt discouragement. I proba
bly wasn't smart enough to recognize
some of the subtle discouragement that
a lot of my friends picked up on and
that knocked them into other fields."
Ride said that being a woman was
also difficult in the culture she faced in
the workplace.
"I think that the influence on my ca
reer has been that it has made it a little
more difficult for me going through
school and going through the profes
sional development because I was fe
male," Ride said. "It was not because
there were specific obstacles that were
put in my way. It was just because 1
found myself as one or two women in a
physics class out of sometimes 20 stu
dents.
"When I went to NASA, I joined at
the Johnson Space Center, a technical

community that was about 4,000 scien
tists and engineers strong, of which
about five were female. There's a cul
ture that builds up there that makes it
more difficult for women to break into."
Ride sees attending Stanford as a
turning point.
"Stanford really helped shape my
life and my career," she said. "Although
there was not a large percentage of
women in the physics classes, women
were encouraged to major in physics
and go on into physics."
This kind of encouragement is what
Ride finds absent for many girls in
America. Two years ago, she started
Imaginary Lines, Inc., a company that
provides programs and products to
support girls' scientific interests. The
aim is to try to support middle school
girls interested in science and engineer
ing.
