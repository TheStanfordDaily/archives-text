# Weighing it up:
## Do fad diets really help people lose weight? 
### 
Hands up if you have ever
been swayed by those TV
commercials telling you it's
easy to lose weight with a de
licious-and-nutritious shake for break
fast and lunch? Or felt compelled to buy
those diet supplements advertised in
glossy magazines, which melt away the
fat even while you sleep?
Well, you are not alone. According to
the National Eating Disorder Associa
tion (NEDA), 91 percent of female col
lege students will diet at some point dur
ing college.
The reasons why young women feel
the need to shed those extra pounds are
varied, but there is undoubtedly an ob
session with thinness pervading West
ern culture, coupled with a genuine fear
of becoming fat. According to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Pre
vention, more than six in 10 American
adults are now considered overweight.
Such statistics are a honey-trap for
companies pushing their fat-busting
"miracle" cures. Last year, Americans
spent more than $40 billion on dieting
and diet related products alone.
But are such products shaping
healthier eating habits throughout the
nation? Or are they simply eating into
our wallets?
"If it sounds too g<xxl to be true, it
generally is," said Vivian Crisman, a nu
tritionist at Vaden Student Health Ser
vices, adding that approximately one
quarter of students who visit her do so
because of weight-loss issues.
Many want to know about the effec-

tiveness of so-called
"fad diets," added
Crisman, which typi
cally involve a drastic
reduction in the
amount of calories
consumed, in order to
lose weight fast.
"The weight you
took five years to gain,

you can shed in a matter of weeks," she
said, "but you're not necessarily losing
fat."
Such diets are more likely to result in
reduced body water and muscle tissue,
explained Crisman. The weight loss
produced from such a process —
known as diuresis — gives the false im
pression that t he pounds are simply slip
ping away.
In reality, when a normal eating
regime is resumed after the dieting pe
riod, many find that the weight quickly
returns. According to NEDA, 95 per
cent of all dieters will in fact regain their
lost weight within one to five years.
"Some even find they are worse off
than if they hadn't dieted in the first
place," said Crisman.
Despite scientific evidence to the con
trary, many still believe that fad diets can
solve their weight problems in the long
term. From meal-replacement shakes to
food-combining, low-fat, low-carlx)hy
drate or high-protein regimes, dieters
today are offered a wide, if not confus
ing, range of options in their quest to
lose weight.
And while pounds are indeed lost

over time, the potential detrimental ef
fects on health cannot be ignored.
The Beverly Hills Diet, unveiled by
nutrition guru Judy Ma/el in 1981, was
deemed "the worst entry in the diet-fad
derby" by the Journal of the American
Medical Association. Many medical ex
perts condemned this food combining
diet, which relies heavily on fruits, for
being extremely low in vital nutrients
and protein. Such a regime will ulti
mately lead to the breakdown of mus
cles and vital organ tissue. But it still re
mains one of the more popular diets on
the market.
Similarly, Dr. Atkins' "Diet Revolu
tion" has consistently provided much
heated debate among medical experts
since it was conceived in 1972. More
than 15 million copies of the book have
been sold worldwide and almost double
that number of Americans have tried
the program.
With an emphasis on high protein
and low carbohydrates, critics have sug
gested that the Atkins diet could lead to
heart disease, bone loss, cancer and kid
ney damage, if followed over extended
periods of time. Last August, re
searchers at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas
reported similar findings in the Ameri
can Journal of Kidney Disease.
Moreover, Stanford University Med
ical ('.enter and Yale University recently
published a study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association that sug
gested people following stub diets do
typically lose weight, but not necessarily

because offewer carbohydrates. Rather,
weight loss occurs by lowering calories.
"You have to expend more energy
than you use," said Dr. Dena Bravata,
author of the study and a social science
research associate at Stanford's Center
for Primary Care and Outcomes Re
search.
"If you want to lose weight there's
nothing magical about it — you have to
work hard and reduce your calories."
Perhaps what is most concerning
about fad diets, regardless of whether
they work, is that they could ultimately
encourage unhealthy attitudes towards
food.
A "gradual and balanced" approach
is best for those who really want to lose
weight, said Crisman. This involves de
creased fat intake, increased amounts of
complex carbohydrates, such as whole
grains and natural wheat products and
moderate amounts of protein. Regular
aerobic exercise three to five times a
week can also help to manage weight
over time.
For those who want to know more
about nutrition, there is a weekly, stu
dent-initiated class known as FORKS,
or Fiber, Oreos, Raspberries and the
Kitchen Sink (Athletics 74). Christopher
Gardner, PhD, will present "Fad Diets:
Atkins and Beyond ... ,"at FORKS on

Framing Miller
Hands up if you have ever
been swayed by those TV
commercials telling you it's
easy to lose weight with a de
licious-and-nutritious shake for break
fast and lunch? Or felt compelled to buy
those diet supplements advertised in
glossy magazines, which melt away the
fat even while you sleep?
Well, you are not alone. According to
the National Eating Disorder Associa
tion (NEDA), 91 percent of female col
lege students will diet at some point dur
ing college.
The reasons why young women feel
the need to shed those extra pounds are
varied, but there is undoubtedly an ob
session with thinness pervading West
ern culture, coupled with a genuine fear
of becoming fat. According to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Pre
vention, more than six in 10 American
adults are now considered overweight.
Such statistics are a honey-trap for
companies pushing their fat-busting
"miracle" cures. Last year, Americans
spent more than $40 billion on dieting
and diet related products alone.
But are such products shaping
healthier eating habits throughout the
nation? Or are they simply eating into
our wallets?
"If it sounds too g<xxl to be true, it
generally is," said Vivian Crisman, a nu
tritionist at Vaden Student Health Ser
vices, adding that approximately one
quarter of students who visit her do so
because of weight-loss issues.
Many want to know about the effec-

tiveness of so-called
"fad diets," added
Crisman, which typi
cally involve a drastic
reduction in the
amount of calories
consumed, in order to
lose weight fast.
"The weight you
took five years to gain,

you can shed in a matter of weeks," she
said, "but you're not necessarily losing
fat."
Such diets are more likely to result in
reduced body water and muscle tissue,
explained Crisman. The weight loss
produced from such a process —
known as diuresis — gives the false im
pression that t he pounds are simply slip
ping away.
In reality, when a normal eating
regime is resumed after the dieting pe
riod, many find that the weight quickly
returns. According to NEDA, 95 per
cent of all dieters will in fact regain their
lost weight within one to five years.
"Some even find they are worse off
than if they hadn't dieted in the first
place," said Crisman.
Despite scientific evidence to the con
trary, many still believe that fad diets can
solve their weight problems in the long
term. From meal-replacement shakes to
food-combining, low-fat, low-carlx)hy
drate or high-protein regimes, dieters
today are offered a wide, if not confus
ing, range of options in their quest to
lose weight.
And while pounds are indeed lost

over time, the potential detrimental ef
fects on health cannot be ignored.
The Beverly Hills Diet, unveiled by
nutrition guru Judy Ma/el in 1981, was
deemed "the worst entry in the diet-fad
derby" by the Journal of the American
Medical Association. Many medical ex
perts condemned this food combining
diet, which relies heavily on fruits, for

mately lead to the breakdown of mus
