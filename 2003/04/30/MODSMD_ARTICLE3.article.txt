# Coterm applicants encounter headaches
## Students surprised that transfer credits affect class standing 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When senior Kugena Song ap
plied to the coterminal master's
program in history, the depart
ment approved her application,
she accepted the department's
offer of admission and she left for
spring break.
When she returned, she re
ceived a telephone call from the
department administrator. The
department had made a mistake,
and its offer of admission was re
scinded.
She had not failed a course. She

had not enrolled in too few classes.
She had too many units.
Because she had taken cours
es equivalent to 16.5 units of
Stanford credit at a local univer
sity while she was in high school,
she had an extra 1.1 full-time
quarters at Stanford, according
to coterminal application proce
dures. It turned out that she
had not applied in her 11th
quarter as she thought — which
would have been acceptable
under University policies. Ac
cording to the Registrar's Of
fice, winter quarter of her senior
year was her 12.15t quarter at
Stan ford.
The Committee on Graduate
Studies, the group of faculty and
graduate students charged with
supervising academic require
ments for graduate students, has
decided that students wishing to
apply for the coterminal master's
program must do so between their
eighth undergraduate quarter
and the third week of their 11th
quarter.
According to the Committee for
Graduate Studies's policy, 15 units
of transfer credit — which doesn't
include Advanced Placement
credit — is equivalent to one quar
ter of undergraduate enrollment.
When students bring in transfer
credit from summer programs or
coursework taken at other univer
sities, problems can emerge dur
ing the coterminal application
proce's^i.
Because of the policy, Song was
ineligible to apply for the cotermi
nal program.
"The policy was written at a
time when Stanford's residency
was based on the number of quar
tersi of full tuition paid," said Uni
versity Registrar Roger Printup.
"NoW the residency policy is based
on units, and we will need to ex
amine a number of requirements
in that light."
"When someone brings in a
huge chunk of units, there's always
a problem for keeping track of
class standing," Printup said.
Song, who had contacted her
department administrator and the
Registrar's Office during her ju
nior year hoping to avoid any
problems, was perturbed by the
process.
"I guess this type of thing
Could very easily be avoided by
very cleat 4 , explicit explanations
fpr these sorts of problems,"

Song said. "I think it should just
be very clear that transfer units
equal time spent at Stanford."
"One thing that was a little
surprising to me was the lack of
communication between my aca
demic department and the Reg
istrar's Office prior to me having
this problem," she continued.
"The step where they pass the
application along to the Regis
trar's Office should probably
occur before the department
tells a student he or she has been
accepted."
Though the number of stu
dents who encounter this problem
when applying for the coterminal
master's degree is relatively small,
Printun said that it occurs every
year.
"Wi • m to have this every
year, but we always find a solution
for these students," he said. "We
understand the importance and
popularity of the co-term pro
gram."
Song petitioned the decision of
the Registrar's Office, and her pe
tition was denied. However, de
partment administrators and the
Registrar's Office worked to find
an alternative for her.
Next year, she will matricu
late as a traditional (non-coter
minal) master's student in histo
ry. Although she will have to
take the GRE before next No
vember, she said that the process
to be admitted as a traditional
master's student was not signifi
cantly more difficult than the ap
plication for the coterminal pro
gram.
Although Song regained admit
tance in the end, she said the
process was trying.
"It was a stressful situation," she
said. "But I really feel like every
one involved was very helpful to
me."
