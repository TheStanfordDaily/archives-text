# Apple launches music service

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The
act of downloading music: online no
longer has to conjure up images of
someone surreptitiously getting
lioodeg digital copies of songs.
Apple Computer launched an
online music service Monday that
analysts and industry executives say
offers one of the most consumer
friendly methods yet of buying
songs electronically — at a reason
able price of 99 cents per download.
"It's a fresh start in the whole on
line music scene," Hilary Rosen,
CEO of the Recording Industry As
sociation of America said. "This
could do to music sales what the
Sony Walkman did to the cassette."
The Cupertino-based company,
which angered the recording in
dustry with its "Rip. Mix. Burn" ad
campaign two years ago, has in
stead won its cooperation by
launching iTunes Music Store, the
Internet's least restrictive commer
cial music service yet.
Apple's new venture draws from
all five major labels in offering more
than 200,000 songs — and includes
some big name artists who previ
ously shunned online distribution.
Unlike its competitors, the
Apple service has virtually no copy
protection — a major concession to
consumer demand.
Apple lets customers keep songs
indefinitely, share them on as many
as three Macintosh computers and
transfer them to any number of
iPod portable music players. No

subscriptions are necessary and
buyers can burn unlimited copies of
the songs onto CDs.
"There's no legal alternative
that's worth beans," Apple CEO
Steve Jobs told of reporters and in
dustiy analysts at San Francisco's
convention center.
Jobs has intensely courted music
industiy executives, who have been
leery of digital music downloads
and have aggressively used lawsuits
and lobbying to stem the illegal
copying and distribution of copy
right works. That wariness has
hamstrung other online music dis
tribution models, keeping most of
the best new music offline.

In contrast, Music Store already
includes music by Bob Dylan, 112,
Eminem, Sheryl Crow, Sting and
other artists previously wary about
music downloads. Eventually, mil
lions of songs will be for sale on ibe
site, predicted Doug Morris, the
chairman and CEO of Universal
Music Group.
Morris, attending Monday's
launch, called it"a defining mo
ment in the music business."
By allowing people to do pretty
much as they please with their digi
tal copies, Apple and the music in
dustry are acknowledging that, due
to digital technology, online file
swapping can't be eradicated.
