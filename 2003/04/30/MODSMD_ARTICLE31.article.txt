# Signs of life in Silicon Valley
## 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amid the ashes of the dotcom bust, there are signs of
new life being created in Silicon Valley. Like the be
ginnings of long-established giants of the Valley such as
Hewlett Packard and Apple Computer, small clutches
of engineers continue to pursue their dreams of creat
ing new software and technologies.
One such outfit is Palo Alto-based Aqua Minds, a
company founded last year by Scott Love, a long-time
Silicon Valley entrepreneur. A three-person operation,
Aqua Minds is kx)king to realize Love's dream of creat
ing a visually based organizational and outlining tool.
Rather than using common applications like Mi
crosoft Word to make lists, structure documents, collect
Web site addresses and gather odd snippets of infor
mation, Love hopes that Note Taker will (ill a niche as
an organizational tool for everyone that collects infor
mation on a computer.
Love, 40, has a long history and passion for creating
new software. After graduating in 1979 as a liberal arts
major from Stanford University and quitting law
school a week after enrolling, he was recruited by Steve
Jobs to work at Apple Computer. Soon after going to
Apple, Love moved to Jobs' pet project at the time —
the creation of a new computer called the Macintosh.
After leaving Apple just before the release of the
Macintosh — "1 decided that I didn't want to drink the
punch," he said in an interview — he moved to NeXT,
a visionary company also started by Steve Jobs that was
trying to build a next generation of computer.
Over the following years, Love worked at a string of
companies and co-founded Millennium Software,
which developed Noteßook, a product similar to Note-
Taker, for the NeXT platform. In 1995, Love co
founded Net Code, a company that developed tools for
an emerging programming language called Java, cre
ated by Sun Microsystems. Net Code was sold Netscape
a year later.
love's latest creation reflects his long involvement
with emerging technologies, such as Adobe's Display
Postscript, a technology used which allowed text to be
displayed on screen as it is on paper, and Apple's Digi
tal Librarian, a tool designed to be an online library for
students and academics.
Describing himself as a self-taught designer rather
than an engineer, Love says that Note Taker is a "think
ing platform," which allows people to organize their
thoughts and research.
The software, released in December last year, is cur
rently only available for the Apple OSX operating sys
tem, but Love says that a prototype version for Win
dows will be available by the end of this year. Ile de
scribes the number of people who have downloaded
the software being in the "tens of thousands" range.
Further down the line, lx>ve wants different versions
of his software and other applications to be able to share
files created with Note Taker, by using a tec hnology
called extensible markup language, or XML, which al
lows data to be shared on different computer programs.
But Love's small band of engineers faces challeng
ing times ahead, primarily in the form of a similar prod
uct to Note Taker currently in development at Mi
crosoft, called One Note. For this reason, Love says
there's little chance of venture capitalists being inter
ested in funding his company. Aqua Minds has been
funded by Love up until this point.
Ultimately, Love says that Note Taker is a class of
tools that will stand on its own for five or six years and
that Aqua Minds could eventually be bought by anoth
er company looking to develop the technology.
While I .ove says that the bursting of the dotcom bub
ble has in fact been somewhat helpful as Aqua Minds
has received more focus in the industry press, the cur
rent environment is very challenging.
"It's a very scary time," he said, "I won't know for
another 24 months whether we've escaped earth's
gravity."
