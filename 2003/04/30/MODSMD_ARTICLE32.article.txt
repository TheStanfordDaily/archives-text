# Elephants are focus of new study

### SRIHARI YAMANOOR 
As children, we watch circus ele
phants perform tricks, accept treats
and dutifully return any cash to their
trainers. John Hutchinson, a post
doctoral research scholar at Stanford
and fellow researchers are interested
in a totally different aspect of ele
phants — the biomechanics that af
fect and limit their locomotion.
Hutchinson's research interests
enconmass the locomotive biome-
Cnank s of large animals. Elephants,
Rlargnt land animals, are a natur
aUshoice for his research.
A potential problem in humans is
the reduced strength-to-weight ratio
and weak or paralytic muscles are a
limiting factor in the locomotion of
obese people on which very few stud
ies have taken place. Elephants move
remarkably smoothly for their size
and weight, and hence studies on
elephants could prove useful to help
obese people cope with their situa
tion.
Animals that run fast usually have
flexible ankles. The elephant has stiff
ankles, so biologists hypothesized
that the elephant cannot actually run
or move fast. An ancient dogma also
doubts whether elephants can really
run at all. The authors set out to test
this and similar hypotheses and also
to find out the actual speed that an
elephant can run.
Asian elephants, known for their
semi-domesticated life were chosen
for the study rather than African ele
phants. Biologically, there are not
many differences between Asian and
African elephants, but African ele
phants are larger and heavier.
Hutchinson and his colleague
Richard Lair traveled across Thai
land to select healthy and active ele
phants. The researchers talked to
several elephant owners and trainers
to choose 42 individuals out of 300-

odd candidates for the study.
Dots were marked on the ele
phants' sides and they were allowed
to traverse a course with ropes on
two sides forming a track. Their mo
tion was captured on video and the
distances between the dots measured
over time gives an idea of their
speed.
According to the conventional de
finition of running, an animal must
lift all its legs above the ground at any
one point in time. But a new defini
tion has arisen for both running and
walking — likening walking to a
pogo-stick motion and running to an
inverted pendulum.
The researchers found that, based

on the conventional definition, ele
phants follow a walking pattern
throughout their motion. Their
movement actually resembles the
motion of a pogo-stick, leading to
speculations that elephants might ac
tually be able to run. The speed of
the elephants has been found to be
around 25kmph from the studies.
Hutchinson's future research in
volves establishing whether ele
phants actually run. This involves
the construction of a force platform
and measuring the forces to deter
mine accelerations and the variation
of center of mass to study the motion
of the elephants. The researchers
also plan to check the speed of cer-

tain tame African elephants in
Botswana.
Computer modeling enters the
fray as a tool to examine several hy
potheses that cannot be tested exper
imentally. This includes testing
whether the muscles of elephants are
too weak to support their motion. It
is also believed that elephants are not
able to run with all (he four legs
above the ground, as the bones
would break, because they are un
able to bear the extra forces. This
theory that can be tested by extrapo
lating the forces and the speeds on
the computer models to test if the
bones break at higher loads and
speeds.
