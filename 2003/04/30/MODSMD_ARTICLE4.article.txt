# Jackson preaches justice
## 
### ERIK WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke on cam
pus yesterday and called on Stanford stu
dents to stand with I lie working poor of Sil
icon Valley and light lot social justice.
"We must make sure that Silicon Valley
for the wealthy is not Death Valley for the
poor," he said, addressing a packed
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday at noon.
Jackson was originally scheduled to ap
pear at an outdoor rally in White Plaza, but
organizers at the last minute moved the
speech indoors due to rain. As it turned
out, the event more closely resembled a lec
ture than a rally.
In just under an hour, Jackson touched
on topics as diverse as the current civil
rights struggle, war in Iraq and affirmative
action. He also repeatedly criticized Presi
dent George W. Bush and his administra
tion's policies.
"Bush should be the poster child for af
firmative action," he said. "He got into Yale
on legacy points, he got into grad school on
affirmative action points, got to be president
even when he didn't have enough points."
Jackson argued that the war in Iraq is
fought by the working poor, the same
group of people who cut the grass and
clean the dorms at Stanford.
He likened the war in Iraq to the Viet
nam War: "Some 55,000 had died in Viet
nam for values not even honored at
home."
"We all say we believe in democracy, but
we need to act like we believe in a genuine
democracy," he told The Daily after the
speech.
Jackson warned that post-war Iraq
could mirror South Africa, "where there is
a minority democracy coexisting with the
majority that's locked out."
Jackson also took time to motivate mem
bers of the audience on a personal level.
"I call you to character. I call you to clar
ity," he told them.
Following the speech, Jackson led the
audience in his characteristic chant of
"Keep hope alive."
He also stopped to point out his nephew
who was sitting in the audience, a Stanford
graduate student in mechanical engineer
ing.
Prompted by a question from the audi
ence, Jackson expressed optimism about
the Democrats' chances in the next presi
dential election, asserting that his party did
win in 2000 and that many were looking

fora "regime change in 2004."
The audience interrupted Jackson with
occasional applause, and lie received two
standing ovations.
" The speech was inspiring," said senior
Olatunde Sobomehin. "[Jackson] lias a ge
nius wit and ability to describe the current
problems of today."
Sophomore I .aura (iodine/ also reacted
enthusiastically to Jackson's speech.
"1 appreciate that lie mentioned the
workers and the role they play on this cam
pus," (iodine/, said. "Stanford would shut
down without them."
Yesterday marked Jackson's sixth visit
to campus since 1998, when he helped lead
the campaign to abolish Stanford's West
ern Culture and CIV Programs, the pre
decessors to I-Hum.
Jackson arrived in the Bay Area on
Monday, joining labor rallies in downtown
San Jose. Today he is scheduled to address
the Rainbow / PUSH Coalition Digital
Connections Conference and attend an
other rally in San Jose.
Jackson's speech at Stanford was spon
sored by the Asian American Students As
sociation, the ASSU President's Office, the
Black Student Union, MKChA, the Stan
ford American Indian Organization, the
Dean of Students Office and the Office of
the University President.
