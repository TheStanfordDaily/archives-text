third year. He also noted that the
guides were more involved in pub
licizing the application process by
going around to dorms and en
couraging others to apply.
"It was an extremely disap
pointing process in that we
couldn't offer jobs to people that
were extremely well qualified,"
Horowitz said. "The final selection
was painful."
Paz Frost echoed these com
ments, adding that she was "im
pressed with the caliber of the stu
dents" who applied.
"All I could think was that I
wished we had more spaces," she
said.
Paz Frost said that even though
many weren't selected as guides,
she felt glad that these students
were around campus because they
had so much energy and enthusi
asm for Stanford.
Freshman Derek Alley, who ap
plied to be a guide, was disappoint
ed when he was not offered a job.

"The process was intense, with
two interviews and an essay por -
tion," Alley said. "And then after
going through all that, it was dis
appointing not to get it."
Paz Frost explained that good
customer service skills and flexibil
ity were some of the traits that she
looked for in guides. She stressed
that the guides must work not only
giving tours, but also at the guide
service for the observations plat
form and reception duties for cam
pus information services.
She also noted that summer
availability was also factored into
the decision.
"It's definitely a consideration,"
she said. "Summer is our busiest
time of the year, when we have
about three times the visitor traf
fic."
She said that VIS tries to keep
the staff balanced with students
from various class years and with
various interests.
Junior Sundeep Bhat, who was
rolled out as a new guide Thurs
day morning, was excited and sur
prised by his new position.
"It was competitive," he said,
"but I didn't realize this until

Thursday morning when there
were just 25 new guides."
Currently a resident assistant in
Rinconada, Bhat said, "What got
me the most was that it was pretty
much like going through the RA
interview process all over again."
The initial process involved a
screening of the applications and a
group interview with six to seven
candidates and four current tour
guides, plus one of the VIS man
agers.
After second-round interviews
and feedback from student man
agers, the new guides were select
ed. They were officially selected
and notified Thursday. The new
guides were rolled out of their
dorm rooms at around 7 a.m. and
taken to the Quad for coffee cake
and doughnuts.
"What struck me first was that
the group of people were very en
ergetic and enthusiastic," said
Bhat of the gathering. "The old
guides were very welcoming.
"It's something I've always
wanted to do," Bhat added. "I'm
looking forward to sharing Stan
ford with people from all over the
world."
