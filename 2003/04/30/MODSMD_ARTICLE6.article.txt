# JetBlue founder shares wisdom

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
David Neeleman, founder and CEO of Jetßlue,
one of only two profitable airlines in America, is by
most ac counts an unqualified business success.
But as lie told an audience of 200 last night at Ter
man Auditorium, Neeleman didn't get where he is
today by pinching pennies and cutting corners, bui
rather through customer service and attention to def
tail.
"A lot of times in business, people are so focused on
the shareholders that they forget what drives the
business," he said.
Jetßlue saw profits grow 34 percent in the last
year, only its third year in existence. But Neeleman,
who had already built and sold Morris Air to South
west for $ 130 million by the time he was 32, said it's
not about the money.
"My feeling is, how much do you really need?" said
Neeleman, who donates his salary to the company
employee catastrophe fund and declined to have
stock options in his contract.
One of the emphases of Neeleman's talk was the
importance of treating one's employees well.
"We dec ided early on that we would not layoff
a single soul, because we're all about people" he
said. "Much is given and much is expected, and
to hold you account
oetßlue, which currently has a
eyre of\7QO,OOQ .frequent flyers,
spends ab'uut halt as much as Unit
<jd?Air lines on labor costs, despite
tfce fact that it pays its employees
liuore, according to Neeleman.
?* "We better utilize our assets,"
Ife said. "I am so paranoid that
w£'re going to become like every
-1)0(1 y else."
to Management Sci
ence and Engineering Prof. Tom
ms, who introduced Neeleman,
Jjjfetßlue's profitability has been dri
ven not just by customer loyalty
but also by a series of technological
innovations.
* "They were the first to go all
dectric-ticket," he said. "And even
the reservation agents can work at
home ... it's just an extraordinary
way of doing business."
1 Added Neeleman, "We call it
high -tech, high-touch."
i; Jetßlue's success has come de

spite what Neeleman termed as
predatory pricing by the major air
lines. But he repeatedly said that
external circumstances do not
break a good business, and that it is
possible to be very profitable in a
poor industry.
"No external force can knock us
off our track, [although] they can
slow us down from time to time,"
he said. "Jetßlue has been able to
succeed in a really bad industry,
[which has] never been profitable
[and has] probably lost more
money in the last two years than it's
made since the Wright brothers
took off."
Neeleman's talk could be sum
marized by a series of apparent
paradoxes: don't worry about
money, but lead the industry in
growth; pay your employees
handsomely but maximize mech
anization; succeed where others
fail.
Services that Jetßlue has
dropped in order to save
money — such as food service on
flights have been replaced by fea
tures such as live-reception televi
sions for every seat.
"We have signs at the gate:

'Next food 2,500 miles,' " he said.
"And the cost [of the TVs] was a
fraction of what the food would've
cost."
Neeleman said he feels that it is
the little touches, rather than air
fares and numbers of routes flown,
that makes his company a success.
"The biggest thing I worry
about at Jetßlue is dilution of the
culture," said Neeleman, who
helps the flight attendants serve
drinks and snacks to the passen
gers whenever he flies. "I believe
it's really important to set the tone
from the top."
Neeleman did not try to impart
a recipe for success to the entre
preneurially-inclined audience,
but he did share his thoughts on
what has made him successful.
"There's nothing I've told you
tonight that you couldn't read in a
business book somewhere," he
said. "It's really in the execu
tion . .. very simple concepts, but
very difficult to execute on a daily
basis."
"This is something to really
keep in mind: if [your business]
disappeared today, would anyone
miss it?"
