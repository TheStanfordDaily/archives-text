## Troops pull out of Saudi Arabia

PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia (AP)
— In a major shift in American focus in the Persian
Gulf, the United States is all but ending its military
presence in Saudi Arabia, abandoning this remote
desert air base that was built in the 1990s and made
the site of a high-tech air operations center in 2001.
Only about 400 U.S. troops will remain in the Mus
lim kingdom, most of them based near Riyadh to train
Saudi forces, American officials said yesterday.
Most of the 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia will
leave by the end of the summer.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan said the pullout is be
cause, with the war won, forces are no longer needed
for their previous mission: patrolling the no-fly zone
over southern Iraq.
But the presence of American forces here has long
been an irritant for Saudi rulers facing strong anti-
American sentiment among a growing and increas
ingly restive population. Fifteen of the 19 alleged
Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis, and Saudi-born
Osama bin Laden cites the U.S. military presence in
his homeland as a reason for his hatred of America.
About 100 U.S. planes now remain at the Saudi
base, down from about 200 during the height of the
Iraq war. All will be gone by the end of August.
The major American presence dates back to 1990,
after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Most of the 500,000 coali
tion troops that ousted Iraq from Kuwait massed in
Saudi Arabia, although then-Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney had to meet with Saudi officials in Riyadh to
arrange that.
U.S. commanders have chafed for years about re
strictions the Saudis put on the use of a base the Amer
icans practically built from scratch after 19 servicemen
were killed in a 1996 barracks bombing in Dhahran.
Prince Sultan,for example, said before the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq that he would never allow his
namesake base to be used for U.S. attacks on Arabs or
Muslims. The Saudis tried to suppress news of the
base's use in the Iraq war and limited the kinds of mis
sions that could be flown from here to Afghanistan.
