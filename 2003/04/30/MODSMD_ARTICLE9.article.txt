# Bush asks Congress to approve AIDS bill

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush asked Congress yester
day to quickly pass a $ 15 billion ini
tiative to combat AIDS in the
Caribbean and Africa, saying swift
action is needed against a disease
that is "leaving graves and or
phans across a continent."
Bush spoke as lawmakers dug
into the divisive details of a bill
whose broad goals enjoy wide
spread support. Congress is likely
to vote next month on an AIDS
bill, but has run into disputes over
sexual abstinence language.
The president said little about
those disagreements yesterday, in
stead pointing to the sweeping
goals of the bill. His initiative
would prevent 7 million new HIV
infections and treat at least 2 mil
lion people in the next decade,

Bush said. He hoped to sign the
legislation by Memorial Day.
Since he proposed the fund in
January, Bush said, an estimated
760,000 people have died of AIDS
and 1.2 million have been infected
with HIV, he said.
"Time is not on our side," Bush
told scores of people at the White
House, including lawmakers,
AIDS activists and African digni
taries. "So I ask Congress to move
forward with the speed this crisis
requires."
"There are only two possible re
sponses to suffering on this
scale — we can turn our eyes away
in resignation and despair, or we
can take decisive, historic action to
turn the tide against this disease
and give the hope of life to mil
lions," Bush said.
