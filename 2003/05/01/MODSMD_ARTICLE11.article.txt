Yesterday's story about Jesse
Jackson's visit to campus, "Jackson
preaches justice," said that Jack
son has visited campus six times
since 1998; Jackson has actually
visited six times since 1988. One of
his most notable visits included a
campaign to abolish the Western

Civilization curriculum.
The column in Monday's paper,
"A new union: now or never," in
cluded a mistake about the fund
ing of the ASSU Arts Grant pro
gram. The money for this pro
gram does not come out of a spe
cial-fee surplus but instead comes
from general fee reserves.
