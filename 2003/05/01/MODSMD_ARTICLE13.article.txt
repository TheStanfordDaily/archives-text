# Bush hires key administrator to work in Iraq

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Bush ad
ministration has chosen L. Paul Bremer, a
former head of the State Department's
counterterrorism office, to become civilian
administrator in Iraq and oversee the coun
try's transition to democratic rule.
Bremer's selection, disclosed yesterday by
a senior U.S. official, will put him in charge
of a transition team that includes retired
Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner and Zalmay
Khalilzad, the special White House envoy in
the Persian Gulf region.

Bremer left the State Department, where
he was an assistant to former secretaries
William P. Rogers and Henry Kissinger, to
join Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm
studded with both Democrats and Republi
cans that held top U.S. government posts.
Currently, Bremer serves as chairman and
chief executive of Marsh Crisis Consulting
company.
Overseeing the transition from rule by
Saddam Hussein to Iraqi opponents of the
deposed president is a tricky assignment in

which the Bush administration is playing an
aggressive role while also declaring it is up to
a wide diversity ol Iraqi groups to choose a
new government.
Newsweek first reported Bremer's selec
tion on its Web site yesterday. The report
was confirmed by a senior U.S. official who
declined otherwise to be identified.
The opposition groups have held two
meetings and after a third one are expected
to begin the process of transition at a confer
ence of all contending forces.
