# Airline OK with union
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP)—United Air
lines locked in $2.56 billion in annu
al cost savings yesterday after the last
of its unions agreed to painful cut
backs, an important step in its bank
ruptcy restructuring.
Hours after the early morning an
nouncement that mechanics and
ground workers had ratified six-year
contracts by wide margins, United
headed to bankruptcy court to make
the changes official.
With employees looking on at an
evening hearing, Judge Eugene
Wedoff approved putting the re
duced wages and new work rules
into effect starting today — signifi
cantly improving United's chances
for recovery, albeit at significant cost
to its employees.
Some workers cheered, while oth
ers were solemn.
Reaching deals with all union
groups is no small achievement for
an airline known for labor fractious
ness, even if it was made possible
largely clue to United's added lever
age in bankruptcy.
CEO Glenn Tilton, who steered
the company into Chapter 11 just
three months after assuming the top
job last September, told employees in
a taped message that the airline has
now "done something that many peo
ple thought was beyond our reach."
"It's now time for us to move
quickly as one organization to the
next phase: building a stronger,
more durable United," Tilton said.
Those changes include plans to
create a low-cost carrier that will even
tually handle as many as 30 percent of
United's now-1,500 daily flights.

Under the new, less restrictive work
rules, the plans also could include fur
ther job cuts like the 7,000 planned by
rival American Airlines.
Tilton didn't elaborate beyond
noting that pilots and (light atten
dants will fly the May schedule under
the new work rules, which are in
tended to boost productivity. "More
changes will be rolled out in the com
ing months," he said.
The $2.56 billion in lowered year
ly labor expenses amount to $7 mil
lion in savings a day, which could be
enough to put United's operations
back into the black. That prospect
helped push United's lagging stock,
which is now traded only on the
over-the-counter market, up 7 cents
to $1.08 yesterday.
But analysts said they would re
serve judgment about the airline's fi
nancial state until after they see the
contractual changes in detail and
United's first-quarter results, due to
morrow.
Joseph Schwieterman, a trans
portation expert and economics pro
fessor at DePaul University in Chica
go, said, "It could be a banner sum
mer for United, with strong demand
for air travel after the Iraqi war and a
new set of labor contracts." But he
cautioned that United's turnaround
plan can't succeed until the air travel
market regains lost ground.
Even with employees having
agreed to contract concessions,
Tilton also still faces broad skepti
cism because of the poor track
record of previous low-cost carri
ers like the one United wants to es
tablish.
