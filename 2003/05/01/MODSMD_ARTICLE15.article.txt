## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Protest promotes democracy 
### 
Last Tuesday, approximately 300
protesters — about 50 of whom
were Stanford students — gath
ered at the Sunnyvale offices of
Lockheed Martin's Space and Strategic
Missiles facility. The protesters gathered to
show opposition to the corporation's role
in the manufacture of weapons used in the
war against Iraq. Some activists blame
Lockheed Martin and other defense con
tractors for playing an indirect role in the
deaths of innocent Iraqi civilians.
However, Stanford involvement in the
protest has been criticized. In a letter to
the editor published in the San Jose Mer
cury News last Thursday, a San Jose resi
dent wrote, "It is sad to see otherwise ed
ucated and intelligent people marching
against a company whose main activity is
to produce products and services that are
designed to protect Americans and serve
our country."

Some war advocates
hold the viewpoint that
it is incorrect to ques
tion or criticize those
involved in protecting
the United States be
cause they also safe
guard our freedoms.
And without such free
doms, we would not be

able to make our voices heard in the first
place.
We believe that protests are valuable in
cultivating an active democracy and thus
consider the protest against Lockheed
Martin a valid anti-war tactic. Even
though defending America is important
for protecting everyone's freedoms, it is
important to recognize that democracies
are protected not only from the outside,
but also from within. The Lockheed Mar
tin protest is an example of an valuable,
though indirect, method of checking the
actions of the military. Employing check
ing mechanisms, including the public
voice, is how voters prevent the military
from exercising tyranny. On a theoretical
level, America can only be a democracy if
its public is empowered with its own voice
and can then question the government as
well as other aspects of society. Weapons
manufacturers can hardly be excluded
from the attention of the public eye, just as
the government and other private corpo
rations have not been.
Critics of the protest against Lockheed
Martin question the fact that the activists
blame private corporations for selling
weapons to the government because it
may seem more logical to blame the gov-

It is important to recognize

ernment for buying such weapons. These
critics believe that it it is the demand fora
product that begs its production. We rec
ognize that chastising Lockheed Martin
for the very type of business it does puts
the corporation in a difficult position, be
cause in accepting this criticism it would
have to doubt its own existence. But it also
seems unfair in a democracy to hold only
the government accountable for Ameri
ca's war, when citizens staff the corpora
tions that make weapons and citizens elect
the government representatives who de
clare war.
In the particular case of Lockheed
Martin, nearly 80 percent of the corpora
tion's business is with the U.S. Depart
ment of Defense and U.S. federal govern
ment agencies. Overall, it is the U.S. gov
ernment's largest provider of information
technology services, systems integration
and related training. Given its strong con

nection to the Depart
ment of Defense, we
cannot avoid holding
the corporation re
sponsible for provid
ing the government its
weapons. This is, in
deed, one of its prima
ry functions.
The fact that the

Lockheed Martin protest targeted a pri
vate corporation is what makes the event
notable. Taken in context with the rest of
the American anti-war campaigns, this
particular protest strategy denotes that
anti-war activists are seeking to be all-en
compassing as they deliver their message.
They are not limiting their entreaties to
the government only, but have expanded
them to include everyone they see as play
ing a role in the manufacture of war. A re
view of anti-war efforts shows that activists
have consciously diversified their anti-war
actions and messages during the last few
months. They protested the war before its
start as well as after, and they have utilized
a variety of media, including letters, In
ternet petitions, protests and radio shows.
The targets of their message have varied
from politicians and army recruitment
centers to American and world citizens.
At minimum, it seems that the Lock
heed protest should not be viewed as "un
wise" or "naive," but as an attempt by anti
war advocates to be all-inclusive in their
efforts. At maximum, critics could call
their efforts futile, but such criticism
would not dim the importance of staying
active and critical of the government in
times of peace and war.
