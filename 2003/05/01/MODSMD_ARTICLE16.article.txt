Rep. Kucinich is not too idealistic
In "Ohio congressman rails at Bush
policies" (April 28), The Daily reported
that some people, including David Aber
nethy, professor emeritus of political sci
ence, felt that Rep. Dennis Kucinich was
naive or too idealistic. To call someone
with Kucinich's life experience and con
gressional experience naive is troubling,
and it seems to be an effort to dismiss him
out ofhand.
1 believe that these comments mean
that those making them have given up
their own vision of what this country
could be and of the world we could create
if we tried.
With a military budget almost as large as
all the other countries in the world, the
United States is in clanger of becoming the
bully, instead of a shining example. The
way Kucinich would no longer be per
ceived as too idealistic is for enough people
to support him.
Don't be afraid to take the risk â€” we are
at a point of great opportunity and danger
for the future of civilization.

Psychology grad students respond to
controversial lecture
This letter is in response to Joan
Roughgarden's guest column, "Psycholo
gy lecture lacks sensitivity to sexual orien
tation" (April 25). We regret that there
were any misunderstandings on t he part of
Roughgarden regarding the Psychology
Department's colloquium. However, we
feel that her recounting of the event was in
accurate, and we would like to offer our
opinion from the perspective of graduate
students in the Psychology Department.
Roughgarden makes two claims in her
column. One, that the talk given by North
western University Michael Bailey was
pcx)rly presented and without merit. We
have no dispute with this claim. The speak
er's data were poor, and his conclusions
based on those data were severely lacking
in merit and validity. No one we spoke with
following the talk found his conclusions to
be persuasive or scientifically valid, and that
was made clear in the questions and cri
tique he received from graduate students
and faculty members following the talk.
The second point Roughgarden makes
is that the audience response was homo
phobic and supportive of Bailey's view.
She cites "peals of laughter" of the audi-
