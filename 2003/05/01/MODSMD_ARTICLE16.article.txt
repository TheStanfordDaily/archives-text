Rep. Kucinich is not too idealistic
In "Ohio congressman rails at Bush
policies" (April 28), The Daily reported
that some people, including David Aber
nethy, professor emeritus of political sci
ence, felt that Rep. Dennis Kucinich was
naive or too idealistic. To call someone
with Kucinich's life experience and con
gressional experience naive is troubling,
and it seems to be an effort to dismiss him
out ofhand.
1 believe that these comments mean
that those making them have given up
their own vision of what this country
could be and of the world we could create
if we tried.
With a military budget almost as large as
all the other countries in the world, the
United States is in clanger of becoming the
bully, instead of a shining example. The
way Kucinich would no longer be per
ceived as too idealistic is for enough people
to support him.
Don't be afraid to take the risk â€” we are
at a point of great opportunity and danger
for the future of civilization.

Psychology grad students respond to
controversial lecture
This letter is in response to Joan
Roughgarden's guest column, "Psycholo
gy lecture lacks sensitivity to sexual orien
tation" (April 25). We regret that there
were any misunderstandings on t he part of
Roughgarden regarding the Psychology
Department's colloquium. However, we
feel that her recounting of the event was in
accurate, and we would like to offer our
opinion from the perspective of graduate
students in the Psychology Department.
Roughgarden makes two claims in her
column. One, that the talk given by North
western University Michael Bailey was
pcx)rly presented and without merit. We
have no dispute with this claim. The speak
er's data were poor, and his conclusions
based on those data were severely lacking
in merit and validity. No one we spoke with
following the talk found his conclusions to
be persuasive or scientifically valid, and that
was made clear in the questions and cri
tique he received from graduate students
and faculty members following the talk.
The second point Roughgarden makes
is that the audience response was homo
phobic and supportive of Bailey's view.
She cites "peals of laughter" of the audi-
ence at several points within the
talk, as well as a lack of criticism by
those present as evidence of this
support. There was, in iact, criti
cism by both professors and stu
dents regarding the scientific va
lidity of the evidence presented.
While the criticism was limited to
the merit of the research, it was in
no way supportive, and, in our
view, was a clear indication of the
c ritical and dismissive view of the
audience toward this research. In
addition, Roughgarden made the
inaccurate assumption that the au
dience was laughing because it was

reveling in some communal ho
mophobic expression. The audi
ence's laughter was partially at e
at lion to the absurdity of some of
Bailey's claims, a reflection of em
barrassed discomfort with the glib
comments made by Bailey and un
ease about being asked to partici
pate in Bailey's guess-who's-gay
experiments.
The Psychology Department is
committed to examining scholar
ly work documenting the true ex
perience of different peoples
and, in particular, of studying the
processes that have heretofore
been in large part omitted from
psychological study, including
the study of gender, race, social
class and sexual orientation. We
have a particularly strong re

search program in questioning
stereotypes about marginalized
groups. Bailey was included as a
speaker in our colloquium series
to further our understanding of
the psychology of individuals in
the gay, lesbian and transgen
dered communities. That his talk
did nothing to elucidate our
knowledge of those processes was
extremely unfortunate, but we
fully support the process that
brought him to our campus.
