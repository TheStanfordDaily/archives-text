# THE
						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## I'm sorry, Momma 
### 
Dear Mom — I need cash.
I'm sorry Momma. I
never meant to hurt you.
I never meant to make
you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning
out your wallet.
Don't roll your eyes at me,
please. I know it's been four years
since I've been out of the house. 1
know it's time for me to start un
derstanding what concepts like
self-sufficiency, Roth-IRA and
501(c)(3) mean.
OK, maybe not that last one.
I've been trying my best, Mom.
You've got to believe me. I'm one
step short of using my cap as a beg
gar's cup and hiking down to White
Plaza to ask for change next to the
crazy-J esus-chanter-u nshaven-for
weeks-yet-somehow-still-dispens-
ing-crappy-advice guy who always
seems to be there on Fridays.
But back to my request for cash.
You see, I thought I could use the
money I earned last summer that I
didn't spend on booze to support
myself this year.
The sad reality, Ma, is that Stan
ford is too damn expensive fora
college kid like me. And Johnnie
Hennessy and the administration
either aren't aware of this fact,
don't care or won't take action —
unless they feel it'll affect some
thing important like admission
rates, publicity or maybe their
salaries.
Here's some non tax-deductible
expenses I've incurred during my
four-year escapade on the most ex
pensive farm in the world.
• $12,000: Car. Yep, either that
or you'll be forced to either bike off
campus in humility, clutching
your helmet and detachable bike
light as you try to hit on the wait

ress at Pasta? while she ignores you
since you're obviously a college kid
with no cash.
• $400: Bike. For that entire
year you couldn't get off campus
with a car.
• $250: Cheaper bike. The one
you bought freshman year got
stolen when you locked it to itself,
thereby bravely ignoring your
RAs warning to lock it to the bike

rack. Idiot.
• $190: High
priced long board.
You'll need it to
impress others
after you realize
the bike's not
doing it. But since
you're in Palo
Alto, you will pay

about $50 more compared to what
it would cost in any major city.
• $45/ year. Bowling. Rumor
has it that Stanford actually had a
bowling alley in the 19705, but
those days of fun are long gone, re
placed by "TresEx: The only bowl
ing alley that closes at 10pm." You
also can't bowl there.
• $120/ year. Parking tickets.
Like the one that you got when you
drove your car to the Tresidder
parking lot because you were too
tired to walk to the CoHo. You lazy
bastard.
• $90/ year. Internet fees. Wait!
Shouldn't these be included in the
price of tuition?
• $20: Donation requested for
the Senior Gift, to "complement"
the meager $130,000 we've
scrapped up to pay for college.
• $385: Special "discount" price
to join the Alumni Association.
Wait a minute, I thought everyone
who graduated was an alumni. I'm

still confused on this one.
• $7.95/ week: Baja Fresh burri
tos. The "Starvin' Student" burrito
at the Tree House is both over
priced and doesn't really qualify as
something that someone would
desire to eat.
• $230/ year: Good concerts, oft
campus. "The Roots" were amaz
ing my freshman year; since then,
we've had — umm, wait — I can't
remember anyone that didn't;
suck. How many one-hit wonders
came through campus as part of a
crappy Stanford Concert Network!
event? "They Might Be Giants"!
was good last weekend, hut it only;
appealed to a small audience: com
plete nerds (myself included).
• $ 1000/ year. Overpriced books!
at the Stanford Bookstore. A note!
for anyone who missed the news"
story a few years ago: The Book
store actually created its own con
sulting firm that subsequently
leased a vacation home in Tahoe
and embezzled Bookstore funds to
furnish it.
• $100,()00/year: The dotcom
job 1 never got because Stanford
grads cashed out their stock before
I could graduate.
So all in all, Stanford's really got
me spent, Mom. 1 hope you un
derstand that I wasn't able to hold
onto all my cash, but the memories
sure seem worth it. And while the
fact that 1 can put a Stanford diplo
ma on my wall in a month is a won
derful feeling, I should've just
cashed those tuition checks and
bought myself a Lamborghini —
just kidding.
