# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Speaking out against Sen. Santorum 
### HANNAH LESLIE GUEST COLUMNIST 
I support queer rights. From thelooksof
dormroom doors on campus, so do a few
other students here. Exactly what queer
rights are, however, and what it means to
protect these rights remains unclear to
many Stanford students. Essentially, those
working for queer rights simply wish for les
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender and ques
tioning people to be treated as full human
beings, accorded equal protection under
the law and respected equally in s<x:iety.
I hese are very simply goals but are far from
Ix'ing accomplished.
In a stunning display of homophobia,
U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) re
cently compared homosexual acts to
polygamy, incest and adultery. In an in
terview with the Associated Press on April
7, Santorum said, "I would argue, they
[homosexual activities] undermine the
basic tenets of our society and the family.
And if the Supreme Court says that you

have the right to consensual sex within
your home, then you have the right to
bigamy, you have the right to polygamy,
you have the right to incest, you have the
right to adultery, you have the right to
anything. Does that undermine the fabric
of our s<xiety? I would argue yes, it does."
Santorum's comments were regarding
vs. Texas, a current Supreme
Court case challenging a Texas statute
against sodomy. In the weeks since Santo
rum made those comments, the leaders of
the Republican Party have rallied to his de
fense. According to an April 24 article in
The Washington Post, Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist called Santorum, who is
the third-ranking Republican in the Sen
ate, "a voice for inclusion and compas
sion." White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer relayed President George W.
Bush's opinion that Santorum "is an inclu
sive man" in an April 2() article in The
Washington Post.
Santorum has made no gesture of apol
ogy. I le said, in The Washington Post, that

his remarks were taken out of context. It is
difficult to see how his comments from the
rest of the interview might help him avoid
charges of intolerance, lie described ho
mosexual activity as deviant behavior "an
tithetical to strong, healthy families." San
torum explained, "I have nothing, abso
lutely nothing, against anyone who's ho
mosexual. ... The question is, do you act
upon those orientations? So it's not the
person, it's the person's actions."
It seems that in Santorum's world,
queer people do not have the right to act
upon their desires while straight people
are encouraged to. Most revealing of San
torum's true opinion of queer people was
his admission that homosexual behavior is
a mere step up from bestiality and pe
dophilia: " That's not to pick on homosexu
ality. It's not, you know, man on child, man
on dog, or whatever the case may be." It is
appalling that a U.S. senator who so bla
tantly lalx*ls queer people as deviant and
