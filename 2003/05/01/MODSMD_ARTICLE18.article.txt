# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Speaking out against Sen. Santorum 
### HANNAH LESLIE GUEST COLUMNIST 
I support queer rights. From thelooksof
dormroom doors on campus, so do a few
other students here. Exactly what queer
rights are, however, and what it means to
protect these rights remains unclear to
many Stanford students. Essentially, those
working for queer rights simply wish for les
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender and ques
tioning people to be treated as full human
beings, accorded equal protection under
the law and respected equally in s<x:iety.
I hese are very simply goals but are far from
Ix'ing accomplished.
In a stunning display of homophobia,
U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) re
cently compared homosexual acts to
polygamy, incest and adultery. In an in
terview with the Associated Press on April
7, Santorum said, "I would argue, they
[homosexual activities] undermine the
basic tenets of our society and the family.
And if the Supreme Court says that you

have the right to consensual sex within
your home, then you have the right to
bigamy, you have the right to polygamy,
you have the right to incest, you have the
right to adultery, you have the right to
anything. Does that undermine the fabric
of our s<xiety? I would argue yes, it does."
Santorum's comments were regarding
vs. Texas, a current Supreme
Court case challenging a Texas statute
against sodomy. In the weeks since Santo
rum made those comments, the leaders of
the Republican Party have rallied to his de
fense. According to an April 24 article in
The Washington Post, Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist called Santorum, who is
the third-ranking Republican in the Sen
ate, "a voice for inclusion and compas
sion." White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer relayed President George W.
Bush's opinion that Santorum "is an inclu
sive man" in an April 2() article in The
Washington Post.
Santorum has made no gesture of apol
ogy. I le said, in The Washington Post, that

his remarks were taken out of context. It is
difficult to see how his comments from the
rest of the interview might help him avoid
charges of intolerance, lie described ho
mosexual activity as deviant behavior "an
tithetical to strong, healthy families." San
torum explained, "I have nothing, abso
lutely nothing, against anyone who's ho
mosexual. ... The question is, do you act
upon those orientations? So it's not the
person, it's the person's actions."
It seems that in Santorum's world,
queer people do not have the right to act
upon their desires while straight people
are encouraged to. Most revealing of San
torum's true opinion of queer people was
his admission that homosexual behavior is
a mere step up from bestiality and pe
dophilia: " That's not to pick on homosexu
ality. It's not, you know, man on child, man
on dog, or whatever the case may be." It is
appalling that a U.S. senator who so bla
tantly lalx*ls queer people as deviant and
nearly criminal was greeted with
praise from the leaders of his party
and of our country. Someone who
excludes all queer people from the
realm of moral human beings can
not possibly be inclusive.
When Trent Lott praised Strom
Thurmond's segregationist cam
paign for president, Lott was light
ly alienated by his party and re
moved from his position as majority
leader. Why has Santorum's stance
elicited not censure but acceptance
and assent? The simple and sad
dening answer isthatblatant homo
phobia, the titter condemnation of
people who engage in non-hetero
sexual behavior as not fully human,
remains a legitimate opinion in the
United Suites today. Lott's com
ments and his continued presence
in the Senate serve as a reminder of
the magnitude of racism's perni
cious influence on our society and
our government. Santorum's re
marks and the lack of widespread
condemnation indicate that homo

phobia continues to flourish in 112 ull
view, is tolerated and even praised
by our society.
Not that Santorum lias gone un
criticized — four Republicans in
Congress and many Democrats (led
by Vermont (iovernor Howard
Dean) have spoken out against the
blatant discrimination evident in
Santorum's comments. However,
there is little chance that Santorum
will actually lose any power in the
Senate. In addition, reaction here
on campus has been quite muted.
Many students remain unaware of
the debate, which has not been
mentioned in The Daily. Those
who do know might be inclined to
dismiss the issue as irrelevant to
their lives. I fowever, continuing to
ignore such blatantly biased com
ments by powerful representatives
only perpetuates the idea that ho
mophobic behavior is acceptable
and that queer people here and ev
erywhere do not enjoy the right to
legal or social equality.
Whenever homophobic com
ments are made, whether at Stan
ford or in Washington D.C., Stan
ford students should consider what
our silence conveys. We should

strive to make this campus intoler
ant of discrimination in all forms, re
gardless of the opinion of stk iety as a
whole. I he first step in making Stan
find an environment where people
of all sexual orientations feel accept
ed and where people of any sexual
orientation tan speak freely in sup
port of anyone else, is to recognize
and condemn actions such as those
of Santorum. One such action, the
insensitive speech Northwestern
University Psychology Prof. Michael
Bailey gave here at Stanford last
week, has already come under wel
come critique in The Daily.
l he second step is to take a g<x>d
look at ourselves to decide how our
actions contribute to an environ
ment where discrimination is toler
ated and inequality is the norm.
Perhaps it may remain acceptable
to Bush to demean queer people,
hnt we don't have to condone such
bias. Break the silence — support
queer rights.

Court case challenging a Texas statute
against sodomy. In the weeks since Santo
rum made those comments, the leaders of
the Republican Party have rallied to his de
fense. According to an April 24 article in
The Washington Post, Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist called Santorum, who is
the third-ranking Republican in the Sen
ate, "a voice for inclusion and compas
sion." White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer relayed President George W.
Bush's opinion that Santorum "is an inclu
sive man" in an April 2() article in The
Washington Post.
Santorum has made no gesture of apol
ogy. I le said, in The Washington Post, that

his remarks were taken out of context. It is
difficult to see how his comments from the
rest of the interview might help him avoid
charges of intolerance, lie described ho
mosexual activity as deviant behavior "an
tithetical to strong, healthy families." San
torum explained, "I have nothing, abso
lutely nothing, against anyone who's ho
mosexual. ... The question is, do you act
upon those orientations? So it's not the
person, it's the person's actions."
It seems that in Santorum's world,
queer people do not have the right to act
upon their desires while straight people
are encouraged to. Most revealing of San
torum's true opinion of queer people was
his admission that homosexual behavior is
a mere step up from bestiality and pe
dophilia: " That's not to pick on homosexu
ality. It's not, you know, man on child, man
on dog, or whatever the case may be." It is
appalling that a U.S. senator who so bla
tantly lalx*ls queer people as deviant and
nearly criminal was greeted with
praise from the leaders of his party
and of our country. Someone who
excludes all queer people from the
realm of moral human beings can
not possibly be inclusive.
When Trent Lott praised Strom
Thurmond's segregationist cam
paign for president, Lott was light
ly alienated by his party and re
moved from his position as majority
leader. Why has Santorum's stance
elicited not censure but acceptance
and assent? The simple and sad
dening answer isthatblatant homo
phobia, the titter condemnation of
people who engage in non-hetero
sexual behavior as not fully human,
remains a legitimate opinion in the
United Suites today. Lott's com
ments and his continued presence
in the Senate serve as a reminder of
the magnitude of racism's perni
cious influence on our society and
our government. Santorum's re
marks and the lack of widespread
condemnation indicate that homo

phobia continues to flourish in 112 ull
view, is tolerated and even praised
by our society.
Not that Santorum lias gone un
criticized — four Republicans in
Congress and many Democrats (led
by Vermont (iovernor Howard
Dean) have spoken out against the
blatant discrimination evident in
Santorum's comments. However,
there is little chance that Santorum
will actually lose any power in the
Senate. In addition, reaction here
on campus has been quite muted.
Many students remain unaware of
the debate, which has not been
mentioned in The Daily. Those
who do know might be inclined to
dismiss the issue as irrelevant to
their lives. I fowever, continuing to
ignore such blatantly biased com
ments by powerful representatives
only perpetuates the idea that ho
mophobic behavior is acceptable
and that queer people here and ev
erywhere do not enjoy the right to
legal or social equality.
Whenever homophobic com
ments are made, whether at Stan
ford or in Washington D.C., Stan
ford students should consider what
our silence conveys. We should

strive to make this campus intoler
ant of discrimination in all forms, re
gardless of the opinion of stk iety as a
whole. I he first step in making Stan
find an environment where people
of all sexual orientations feel accept
ed and where people of any sexual
orientation tan speak freely in sup
port of anyone else, is to recognize
and condemn actions such as those
of Santorum. One such action, the
insensitive speech Northwestern
University Psychology Prof. Michael
Bailey gave here at Stanford last
week, has already come under wel
come critique in The Daily.
l he second step is to take a g<x>d
look at ourselves to decide how our
actions contribute to an environ
ment where discrimination is toler
ated and inequality is the norm.
Perhaps it may remain acceptable
to Bush to demean queer people,
hnt we don't have to condone such
bias. Break the silence — support
queer rights.

I support queer rights. From thelooksof
dormroom doors on campus, so do a few
other students here. Exactly what queer
rights are, however, and what it means to
protect these rights remains unclear to
many Stanford students. Essentially, those
working for queer rights simply wish for les
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender and ques
tioning people to be treated as full human
beings, accorded equal protection under
the law and respected equally in s<x:iety.
I hese are very simply goals but are far from
Ix'ing accomplished.
In a stunning display of homophobia,
U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) re
cently compared homosexual acts to
polygamy, incest and adultery. In an in
terview with the Associated Press on April
7, Santorum said, "I would argue, they
[homosexual activities] undermine the
basic tenets of our society and the family.
And if the Supreme Court says that you

have the right to consensual sex within
your home, then you have the right to
bigamy, you have the right to polygamy,
you have the right to incest, you have the
right to adultery, you have the right to
anything. Does that undermine the fabric
of our s<xiety? I would argue yes, it does."
Santorum's comments were regarding
vs. Texas, a current Supreme
Court case challenging a Texas statute
against sodomy. In the weeks since Santo
