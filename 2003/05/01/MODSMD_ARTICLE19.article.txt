## Top Pac-10 prospect speaks with bat 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Many aspects of the Cardinal baseball program
have changed over the past three years, but one
constant over that time period has been No. 24 in
right field.
Carlos Quentin, or "Los" as his teammates call
him, has been the Cardinal's right fielder since he
first arrived on the Farm and has helped lead the
Cardinal to two-straight College World Series ap
pearances with his reliable glove and explosive bat.
Coach Mark Marquess had said early in
Quen tin's collegiate career that he was a great play
er who would only get better.
I lis prediction has held true, as Quentin is cur
rently in the middle of his strongest offensive cam
paign yet. I le owns a .430 batting average (cur
rently a tie for the school's single-season record)
and has hit safely in 28 out of his last 29 games.
Willi power, speed and a strong arm, Quentin
has all the tools sought by major league teams and
is currently Baseball America's top Pac-10 draft
prospect.
While the prospect of going early in the MLB
Draft would naturally occupy any player's mind,
Quentin focuses on keeping his mind on the pre
sent.

"You have to let that go and do your best to get
that out of your head," Quentin said of all the
hopes and anxieties that accompany waiting for
the drali. "It'll only mess up your game."
According to Quentin, the only way to deal the
pressure is to place the team ahead of his individ
ual statistics.
"Coach [Dean] Stotz told me when I first came
here, 'Take care of the team, and the individual ac
colades will l)e there at the end.'" Quentin said. "So
tl lat's always been my goal: to take care of the team.
I measure my success by the success of the team. If
I have a bad day but the team wins, I'm happy."
Quentin has one more way of combating nerves
and pressure: strict devotion to his routine.
Observant fans may note that Quentin goes
through the same routine before each at-bat, and
he explains that his habits extend beyond his way
of walking up to the plate.
"I'm not a superstitious person in general, but I
definitely am a little superstitious about my rou
tine," Quentin said. "I do everything the same way
before and during a game: eat the same way, get
suited up the same way, approach the batter's lx>x
the same way."
"Then I tap my cleats twice t() kmx k die dirt off ,
and I'm ready to go."
With the results he's l)een getting lately, don't

expect Quentin to change anything in his routine
any time soon.
While Quentin may fervently stick to certain
game-day habits, that doesn't mean his approach
to hitting remains fixed.
"Whereas 1 used tooverswing more often, late
ly I've just been focusing on getting the barrel of
the bat on the ball and just trying to hit the ball
hard."
The result has been slightly fewer home runs
but more base hits. Quentin's six home runs this
season put him third on the team in that category.
While that number could be higher with thi£
amount of power Quentin possesses, he says that*
trying to put the ball over the fence has not been a
specific goal of his.
The philosophy has paid off. 1 Hitting hard line
drives and ground balls has left Quentin with the
team's most doubles (21) and highest slugging per
centage (.690) — not to mention his sky-high bat
ting average.
With Quentin on such a tear and the rest of the
lineup hitting so well along with him (the team bat
ting average is .316), hopes of a fifth-straight trip to
Omaha are hard to subdue.
"It's on every college player's mind" says
Quentin of the College World Series. "It's what
everyone's working for."
