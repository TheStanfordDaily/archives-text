# Egos punished in sports world

I remember the first time 1 learned about hubris, in
some middle school literature class where we read
a toned-down version of "The Odyssey" and
learned about how hubris against the gods always
resulted in catastrophe as the gods threw their wrath
down from Mount Olympus and made mortals ciy.
Now, I can't say that I've actually seen hubris clis-

* ,VJ "> * * **- /
played the way Mrs. Eckersley de
scribed it to me years ago — but I'll tell
you this. I've seen it in sports.
And it has made me cry.
Where to begin? Looking at cur
rent events, we find a ready example in
Kevin Garnett and the Timberwolves.
Looking to make it to the second
round of the playoffs for the first time
in his career (he's currently O-fbr-7), he

led his team to an early 2-0 lead in the best of seven se
ries. In an ABC interview before Game 4, he boldly de
clared, .. if we win this game, we feel like it is over."
Uh, K.G. I think you're a fantastic bailer and hands
down this year's MVP — but don't go around saying
stuff like that.
Cue the thunderbolts and warm up Apollo's chariot —
the Lakers came out and stole Game 4 102-97 before drop
pingabomb in Gamesto the tuneof 120-90. So now K.G.,
the Big Ticket himself, finds a 3-2 deficit in place of a 2-0
lead, wondering if there will even be a Game 7.
Not convinced yet? Let's go back a few days, then —
actually let's go back a whole year, to Game 6 of the N H L
Western Conference semi-finals. The Colorado
Avalanche versus the Evil Red Menace. (That's the De
troit Red Wings, for those of you not from Colorado).
Patrick Roy, arguably the greatest big-time goalie in
the history of hockey, spears a Brendan Shanahan slap
shot and goes for his trademark "Statue of Liberty" save,
where he holds the glove hand up high, in the shooters
face.
(Picture the torch on the "Statue of Liberty" and it's
easy to understand the name).
It's an intimidating move — proving to the shooter
that the save was easy, that you're showing him up, that
he shouldn't even bother to shoot next time.
It can also be a pretty embarrassing move — when
you stand up only to have the puck fall out of your glove,
hit the ice behind you and roll into the net.
CkxKXKX)ooaaaaaaaal — and Game 7.
Apparently the puck either was never in Roy's glove
or perhaps fell out of the glove as he stood up. Either
way, his demonstration of personal pride was directly
correlated with the empty-net goal.
Roy went on to perform his best imitation of a sieve in
Game 7, allowing two goals on the first two shots and
three on the first half dozen shots en route to a 7-0
thrashing and an early exit from the game — let alone
the playoffs.
Cioing back to basketball, we can see that even the Big
Aristotle himself is not immune to the gods' wrath. After
bringing Los Angeles its third consecutive title, he in
formed the crowd in front of the Staples Center that
"Sacramento is not the capitol of California — LOS AN
GELES is the capitol of California!"
Blatant disregard for geography aside, can anyone
say that there was no relation between that statement
and the foot surgery that sidelined him for the l>egin
ningofthis season? That's what I thought.
Of course, sometimes athletes can pull it off. They can
make their bold predictions, tempt fate, taunt the cos
mos — and get away with it.
"I"he Babe did it with his famous "called shot" into
center field.
"Broadway Joe Namath" in Super Bowl 111 —guaran-
teed victory, then went out and won the M. V. P. award after
passing for 206 yards against the heavily favored (-olts.
But all too often the plans ba< kfire. In sports, predic
tions don't come true.
