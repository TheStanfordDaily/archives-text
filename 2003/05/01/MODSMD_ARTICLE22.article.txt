# Bruins top Card, Pac-10 at home
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As expected, UCLA — No. 5 in Golfweek's updat
ed rankings —showed that it is the best team in t he Pa
cific* 10 Conference, claiming top team honors at this
week's Pac-10 Men's Golf Championship. Stanford
finished in fourth place at the event, three strokes be
hind No. 10 Arizona State and 39 shots off the lead.
In the individual competition, UCLA junior John
Merrick ran away and hid from the rest of the field on
Wednesday, carding an incredible 9-under par 63 to
finish at 12-under par, 10 shots clear of his nearest
pursuers.
The event is designed to be the year's toughest test
of golf. Set at t he ()akmont Country Club in Glendale,
Calif., the tournament stretched over three days, and
the teams played four rounds of golf, rather than the
customary three fora regular-season competition.
Playing at their home course, the Bruins looked
very comfortable in the early going, carding rounds of
364 and 362 on Monday. After 36 holes, UCLA held a
seven-stroke advantage over the second-place Cardi
nal
"You can definitely tell that it's [the Bruins'] home
course," said Stanford junior Blake Mastalir. "That's
part of the reason that they've got such a big lead like
that."
After the third round of play, the outcome of the
team competition was nearly academic. Tuesday's 5-
under par round 0f355 was the lowest of the tourna
ment and catapulted the Bruins into a commanding
23-shot lead over No. 6 Arizona, which had snuck past
Stanford into second place.
By the start of Wednesday's final round, the only
action remaining iti the team competition was the race
for second place. Arizona stood in second, leading
Stanford by just five shots and No. 20 Washington
University by 10.
As Mastalir pointed out, t he separation between the
teams was even narrower than the leader board sug
gested: "Five shots [can be made up] in one hole on
this golf course. "
Hie tournament's other storyline surrounded the

individual competition. The Pac-10's bounty of talent
ed players had promised to make the race for the in
dividual crown exciting from the outset.
By the time the first groups teed oft on Wednesday,
the stage was set for last-minute drama. Merrick and
Stanford senior Jim Seki were tied for the tournament
lead at 3-under par.
However, Arizona junior Chris Nallen, the nation's
11 th-ranked golfer, wasjust seven shots off the leading
pace. Teammate Ricky Barnes, the reigning U.S. am
ateur champion, was also within striking distance.
In fact, the players at the top of the pack were
grouped so tightly that a mere six shots separated the
leaders from those in 10th place.
Stanford played solidly on the final day, paced by
the scoring of Seki. The defending Pac-10 champion,
Seki is no stranger to the pressurized atmosphere of
postseason play.
Although he was confident about his game heading
into his fitial round, Seki's health was another matter.
ITiis was the first time all year the team had played
four consecutive rounds of competitive golf, and it re
mained to Ik* seen how Seki's injured back would re
spond to the stress.
He played consistently on Wednesday, shooting a
1-over par round of 73 that included just two bogeys
and one birdie. The round left him in a tie for second
overall.
Fellow senior Ron Won recaptured a measure of
the consistency this week that was his trademark earli
er in the season. Starting out the day in a tie for 21st
place, Won posted his third 74 of the tournament on
Wednesday, moving up one spot to grab sole posses
sion of 20th place.
While it was Won's sixth top-25 performance of the
year, Wednesday was the first time he had cracked t he
top-40 since the first week in March.
Sophomore Kevin Blue, who headed into
Wednesday one shot back of Won, matched his team
mate's st ore in the final 18 holes. After an adventurous
back nine, which included two birdies, two bogeys,
and a double-bogey, Blue landed in 23rd place.
His 12-over par total of 300 secured the sopho
more's third top-25 finish of the year.
