# Pitching sparks shutout of Gaels
## 
### LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of grueling games against two of the best
in the nation in Los Angeles and Seattle, a game against the
23-22 Gaels of St. Mary's College may not have seemed like
a daunting task for No. 15 Stanford (36-20). Yet with two
outs in the top of the sixth Stanford's slim 2-0 lead looked to
be in jeopardy with Gaels on second and third. But, as she
had done all night, freshman Laura Severson was able to
reach back and snuff the rally, forcing a ground out to third.

Yesterday: No. 15 Stanford 5, Saint Mary's 0

St. Mary's pitcher Jennifer Eaton had put in a valiant ef
fort to that point, but in the bottom of the sixth an efficient
Stanford offense put the game into the comfort zone and the
Cardinal pulled away to win 5-0.
The Cardinal opened the scoring in the third, using a sac
rifice bunt sandwiched between singles by sophomore Leah
Nelson and junior Elizabeth Bendig to take a 1 -0 lead.
Junior catcher Jessica Allister continued her recent
power surge with a solo home run in the fourth to make it 2-
(). Allister has homers in three of the last four games, and has
notched nine for the season.
In the bottom of the sixth the Cardinal played small-ball
to bring home three more runs. The first five batters of the
inning reached base on three singles and two walks, bring
ing in two runs before the Gaels finally recorded an out.
Bendig's RBI single drove in the third run of the inning be
fore a line-out double play ended the rally.
Severson and senior Tori Nyberg combined on the
shutout. Nyberg pitched the first two innings, striking out
four Gaels and allowing just one hit. Severson pitched the
final five to record her fifth win of the season. Her composure
in the circle belied the relative youth of her college career.
"I really like the way she's progressing in the circle," said
head coach John Rittman. "Laura's somebody that we're
looking for big things from in the future."
Stanford returns for its final Pac-10 home series of the year
against No. 1 Arizona and No. 16 Arizona State this weekend.
