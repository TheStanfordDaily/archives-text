# Med School revamps curriculum
## 
### ILENA GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate of Stanford's
Medical School recently approved dras
tic changes to the Medical School's cur
riculum. These alterations will create a
curriculum which integrates classroom
study and clinical experience. It will also

provide students with opportunities to
focus in-depth on an area of interest.
"Some of the goals of the new cur
riculum are to better integrate basic and
clinical sciences by strengthening clinical
correlates in the first two years," said Dr.
Oscar Salvatierra, professor of surgery
and of pediatrics and chair of the Med
ical School Faculty Senate, "[The cur

riculum will also] create opportunities to
introduce or reinforce basic science con
cepts in the third and fourth years; pro
vide a stronger emphasis on develop
ment of clinical skills, clinical reasoning
and exploration of physician / patient
topics throughout the first two years."
Part of these changes include restruc
turing the way courses are taught to be
based around specific organ systems,
rather than learning about a certain as
pect of all systems. The classes will be co
ordinated so that hands-on, clinical in
struction in a specific area will occur at
the same time as instruction from books
and lectures.
"[A] student studying the heart will
learn how the heart works, what can go
wrong and how to fix it, all in one inte
grated class," said medical student and
representative of the Committee on
Courses and Curriculum Vedant Kulka
rni. "With this approach, stndents will
hopefully find that their classes help
1 hem to think more critically about prob
lems rather than relying on memorized
facts."
Kulkarni also explained, "[There will
be] [ejarlier and more comprehensive
introduction to clinical skills in the first
two years. I think students will enjoy
their early experiences in patient care
