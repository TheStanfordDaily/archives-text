# Med School revamps curriculum
## 
### ILENA GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate of Stanford's
Medical School recently approved dras
tic changes to the Medical School's cur
riculum. These alterations will create a
curriculum which integrates classroom
study and clinical experience. It will also

provide students with opportunities to
focus in-depth on an area of interest.
"Some of the goals of the new cur
riculum are to better integrate basic and
clinical sciences by strengthening clinical
correlates in the first two years," said Dr.
Oscar Salvatierra, professor of surgery
and of pediatrics and chair of the Med
ical School Faculty Senate, "[The cur

riculum will also] create opportunities to
introduce or reinforce basic science con
cepts in the third and fourth years; pro
vide a stronger emphasis on develop
ment of clinical skills, clinical reasoning
and exploration of physician / patient
topics throughout the first two years."
Part of these changes include restruc
turing the way courses are taught to be
based around specific organ systems,
rather than learning about a certain as
pect of all systems. The classes will be co
ordinated so that hands-on, clinical in
struction in a specific area will occur at
the same time as instruction from books
and lectures.
"[A] student studying the heart will
learn how the heart works, what can go
wrong and how to fix it, all in one inte
grated class," said medical student and
representative of the Committee on
Courses and Curriculum Vedant Kulka
rni. "With this approach, stndents will
hopefully find that their classes help
1 hem to think more critically about prob
lems rather than relying on memorized
facts."
Kulkarni also explained, "[There will
be] [ejarlier and more comprehensive
introduction to clinical skills in the first
two years. I think students will enjoy
their early experiences in patient care

clinical experience, as well as allow students to develop special in-depth areas of focus.
and will become more confident
with their diagnostic skills before
entering the clinics in the second
two years of medical school."
A key element of the new cur
riculum is an earlier start date for
first-year medical students. This
September, first-year medical stu
dents will begin their quarter three
weeks earlier than the rest of the
University. The year after, both
first- and second-year students will
have this earlier start date.
By starting earlier, the number
of hours of instruction a week will
be reduced in order to allow stu
dents more time to pursue their
scholarly interests. Students will
also be able to begin their clerk
ships, in the third year of medical
school, earlier than they were able
to previously.
Another of the changes will
create "scholarly concentrations,"
essentially equivalent to the un
dergraduate major, that will allow
students to pursue a specific field
of interest in-depth. These con
centrations focus on areas such as
molecular science, public and
community service, international
health and clinical research,
among others.
In the Spring 2003 Med Voice
newsletter, Senior Associate Dean
for Medical Education Dr. Julie
Parsonnet said, "The curricular ef
forts are meant to take advantage
of this enthusiasm for ideas, advo
cacy and action. Moreover, we

think we would be remiss if we
taught only the wide breadth of
medicine (the traditional 're
quired' curriculum) without pro
moting exploration of some inter
est in depth. It is in-depth learning
that provides the excitement in
any discipline. In-depth learning
also develops skills and practices
that are essential to the outstand
ing practice of medicine."
These changes have been in the
works for several months and fur
ther relatively minor changes are
possible.
"Not all changes will happen
smoothly; we expect the curricu
lum will require tweaking and
even more major revision over
time," Parsonnet said. "Nonethe
less, we are tremendously excited
and energized by the changes we
are undertaking. The new cur
riculum will bring education to
the forefront of the school and
galvanize faculties and students
together."
Overall, Medical School faculty
and students seem optimistic
about the changes and feel the ad
justments will greatly benefit the
school.
"[Ejveryone appears to be em
bracing the future changes as nec
essary for best preparing the new
physician to the new medicine of
this century, where the best prac
tice of medicine will become in
creasingly dependent on the con
tinuing integration of new basic sci
ence concepts to what happens at
the bedside," Salvatierra said. "And
there is no better place to begin this
process than at Stanford with its
strong tradition of innovation."
