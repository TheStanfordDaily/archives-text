# File-sharing policy stays
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
As music and movie corporations are tighten
ing their grip on Internet file-sharing, college stu
dents nationwide are facing the consequences.
Even with a dramatic increase in complaints re
ceived from copyright owners, Stanford comput
ing and networking personnel say that the Uni
versity's policy is likely to remain active, yet con
sistent.
Stanford's policy on file-sharing is rooted in
the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act which
requires universities to respond to complaints
from music and entertainment industry groups
such as the Recording Industry Association of
America and the Motion Picture Association.
"DMCA complaints to the University are up
over 1,000 percent from last year," said Tina Dar
mohray, computer security specialist at Stan
ford's Information Technology Systems and Ser
vices. "This could be because more folks are ille
gally downloading copyrighted material [but]

who share copyrighted material via the University's
network in response to complaints by companies.
also could be because the copy
right owners are stepping up their
efforts to look for and file com
plaints about alleged violators."
According to ITSS Director
Ced Bennett, there has been a
four-fold increase in copyright
owner complaints from just three
to five a week last year to five to
10 or more complaints each day
this year. Bennett said that the
influx may even require a full
time employee to manage indus
try grievances.
When the University receives
such a complaint, ITSS notifies the
individual who was potentially
sharing illegal tiles and asks them
to remove the offending material
by the following day.
"Nearly everyone we write to
handles it at this level and the mat
ter is closed," Bennett said. "If the
person doesn't react within the
time frame, we then are forced to
shut off their Internet connection
until they let us know that they've
fixed the problem. Then we turn it
back on."
Bennett confirmed that the
identity of offending students is
kept strictly confidential and that
fTSS does not monitor student
networking or file-sharing to any
extent unless it receives a formal
complaint.
"We have no idea if people are
copying anything from each
other's public home folders or
what that material may be," Ben
nett said. " The only way we know
of any DMCA violations is when we

receive a complaint from either the
owner of the material or an agent
acting for them."
Four lawsuits were recently
filed against college students
across the country for download
ing copyright protected material.
According to Bennett, these stu
dents were running large, local
services offering copyrighted ma
terials to many other users.
"To my knowledge, we do not
have anyone at Stanford acting the
same way as the students in these
lawsuits," he said. "Nearly all of the
DMCA violations we see are one
time occurrences [and] we very
rarely see any individual violate it
more than once."
Ethan Rikleen, a system admin
istrator at Residential Computing,
said that the University resists
shutting down student systems un
less it is absolutely necessary not
only because it disrupts student life
but also because it requires both
time and money. For this reason,
he doubts that the University will
crack down on students even with
the influx of corporate complaints.
Said sophomore Jim Rodgers,
"I hope that the current situation
will be maintained. I think it would
be unfortunate if the University
started monitoring or restricting
network use.
"In general, I think the Univer
sity is doing a pretty good job with
regulations," he added. "Obvious
ly they need to take steps to limit
the bandwidth that file-sharing
takes up so that the network is
available for other uses, too, but it
seems like they are trying to avoid
taking on the role of policing net
work use while still responding to
complaints of violations."

In efforts to solve the Universi
ty's bandwidth problem, Rikleen
developed the Stanford Gnutella
file-sharing system, which was re
cently shut down upon students'
return from winter break. The
Gnutella server was designed to
allow students to share files within
the campus network. While localiz
ing uploads and downloads
helped save bandwidth space for
other purposes, the system was
used primarily for sharing copy
righted material.
When the Motion Picture Asso
ciation was notified of the Gnutella
server, the organization contacted
the University and the system was
shut down.
"Eventually, we decided to com
ply because the general concern
was that the system set up a Uni
versity-owned machine for lile
sharing when file-sharing was
being used to violate copyright
law," Rikleen said. "It made it seem
like the University was assisting in
copyright infringement, and we
decided it wasn't a battle worth
fighting."
Although the University will not
likely strengthen its current policy
on file-sharing, Rikleen expressed
his frustration with any restriction
of networking capabilities.
"[Gnutella] was invented to en
courage creative use of computers
and the network in general," Rik
leen said. "This creativity leads to
good ideas, new technologies and,
most of all, people learning new
things, which is after all why we're
here."
According to Rikleen, Stan
ford's regulations on file-sharing
are relatively lenient in compari
son with peer institutions.

"There are some schools that
treat DMCA complaints as junk
mail, and then there are some
that immediately disconnect all
potential violators," he said.
"These complaints are just allega
tions— they can be wrong —
and schools that just shut you off
as soon as they get a complaint
are way out of line."
Res Comp will be posting a
new Web site within the next
week, to educate students on the
potential dangers and legal rami
fications of file-sharing. Accord
ing to George Wilson, program
coordinator at the Office ol Judi
cial Affairs, students who are en
gaged in criminal copying and
distribution enterprise may face
charges by the Santa Clara Coun
ty District Attorney as well as be
subject to a Fundamental Stan
dard complaint at Stanford.
"We believe that powerful
music and entertainment industry
groups will continue to bring law
suits and lobby the U.S. and state
governments relentlessly," Wilson
said. "The University, along with
other colleges and universities, will
— like it or not — have to keep 011
its toes to protect against potential
ly high-liability exposure."
Bennett agreed with Rikleen
and expressed his hope that the
University will take further steps to
inform the students of the exist ing
laws and policies.
"I worry that as the agencies get
more aggressive they will try to
make examples out of our stu
dents," he said. "When you think
about it, it is a silly thing to get sued
over an inexpensive piece of music
or movie, and 112 don't want to see it
happen to any of our students."
