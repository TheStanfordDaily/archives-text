# Law prof discovers slave's Civil War diary
## A 						STORY OF ESCAPE 
### BARRETT SHERDIAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost 150 years ago, William
B. Gould described his own es
cape from slavery under the title
"An Interesting and Romantic
Narrative" in the Anglo-African
Times. Fleeing his native Wilm
ington, N.C. on the night of Sept.
21, 1862, he and seven others
took flight down the darkened
waters of the (.ape Fear River and
reached safety on a Union navy
ship in the mouth of the river the
next day.
Gould, a rare literate slave,
recorded the next three years of
his life as a member of the Union
navy in a comprehensive diary.

Preserved for more than 150
years, his writings have recently
become available to the public,
thanks to the efforts of his great
grandson, William B. Gould IV, a
professor emeritus at the Stan
ford Law School.
Entitled "Diary of a Contra
band: The Civil War Passage of a
Black Sailor," Gould's book in
cludes pictures of his great-grand
father's Civil War artifacts, maps
and drawings of his travel areas
and the diary itself.
Forgotten for nearly a century
in the attic of his great-uncle's
home, the diary came very close to
being lost forever.
"My father was bequeathed my
great-uncle's property when he
died in 1958," Gould said. "He
went to the attic and workmen
were throwing tilings out. My fa
ther found these two volumes [of
the diary]. My father believed that
a portion of the diary was thrown
out prior to the time of his arrival
because there are four months
missing, but he was able to retrieve
the rest of it."
Written in a large, flowing, cur
sive print, the words of the diary are
still clearly legible today. While most
entries are a dry rehashing of the
day's events, the enslaved Gould
often demonstrated a cunning wit, a
well-read mind and an impressive
knowledge of current events.
"A sail was reported close under
the land right ahead," he wrote on
Nov. 17, 1862, in a description of
his first naval battle. "We gave
chase. When within range of our
Pet. we told them good morning in
the shape of A shot for her to heave
to."
Of his great-grandfather,
Gould the law professor said,
"He is a very understated, sar
donic, witty man who is a vora
cious reader and who seems to
know a great deal about what is
going on in the world around
him, not only in race relations
and in the war, but as a general
matter."
Gould, a specialist in labor
law and former chairman of the
National Labor Relations Board
under former President Bill
Clinton, said that the document
ed struggles of his great-grand
father served as a special com
fort to him during the difficult
periods.
"The greatest challenge and
the greatest peril that confront
ed me was during the period in
Washington when the extreme
right-wing Republicans seized
control of the Congress and
adopted a very hostile and ag
gressive attitude toward my
agency, and towards me as well,"
he said. "I would frequently re
read this diary and look at this
man facing far more dangerous
challenges and peril than I con
fronted. I think the diary in that
and similar situations was an in
spiration to me, and my hope is
that the diary will be a great in
spiration to others who are com
mitted to both freedom and
equality."
Gould also has other motives
for publishing the diary of his
great-grandfather. The rarity of
literate slaves, he says, leads many
to believe that they didn't exist at
all — he hopes that "Contra
band" will dispel that myth.
"All the Confederate states pro
hibited slaves 112 rom being taught to
read and write," he said. "It took a
great courage and defiance of not
only custom but law to read and
write. One of the breakthroughs
that this diary provides is that
there were, in the face of this ad
versity, a number of literate slaves
who could read and write with
great fluency and ease."
Gould also hopes that his great
grandfather's story will inform
people of the contribution that
blacks made to the Union army
during the Civil War, especially in
the navy.
"One of the points I make in
the book," he said, "is that the
early presence of blacks in the
navy helps change the course of
the war and make it a struggle for
liberty, as well as union."
