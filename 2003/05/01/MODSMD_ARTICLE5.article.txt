# Law prof discovers slave's Civil War diary
## A
						STORY OF ESCAPE 
### BARRETT SHERDIAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost 150 years ago, William
B. Gould described his own es
cape from slavery under the title
"An Interesting and Romantic
Narrative" in the Anglo-African
Times. Fleeing his native Wilm
ington, N.C. on the night of Sept.
21, 1862, he and seven others
took flight down the darkened
waters of the (.ape Fear River and
reached safety on a Union navy
ship in the mouth of the river the
next day.
Gould, a rare literate slave,
recorded the next three years of
his life as a member of the Union
navy in a comprehensive diary.

Preserved for more than 150
years, his writings have recently
become available to the public,
thanks to the efforts of his great
grandson, William B. Gould IV, a
professor emeritus at the Stan
ford Law School.
Entitled "Diary of a Contra
band: The Civil War Passage of a
Black Sailor," Gould's book in
cludes pictures of his great-grand
father's Civil War artifacts, maps
and drawings of his travel areas
and the diary itself.
Forgotten for nearly a century
in the attic of his great-uncle's
home, the diary came very close to
being lost forever.
