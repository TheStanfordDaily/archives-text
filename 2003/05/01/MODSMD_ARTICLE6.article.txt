# Harvard changes early policy
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Responding to an unparalleled 25 percent
increase in early admission applications for its
class 0f2007, Harvard has reverted back to a
single-choice Early Action program for un
dergraduate admissions.
Beginning this tall, high school seniors
apply to Harvard's early admission program
will not be allowed to apply early admission to
any other university. This change means that
Stanford, 1 larvarcl and Yale will all have iden
tical early admission policies beginning next
year.
"I think Harvard's move is precisely the
right one: the policy that Stanford, Yale and

now Harvard have adopted makes clear to
students that applying early is appropriate
when you have a clear first-choice college,"
said Dean of Admission and Financial Aid,
Robin Mamlet.
Last year, Harvard allowed students to
apply to binding Early Decision programs at
other schools, in addition to its Early Action
program. Stanford and Yale have always re
quired that students apply to only one early
admission program. Both recently changed
their policies to create non-binding programs
in which students are allowed to apply toother
schools in the regular admissions cycle and
wait until May to make their final choices.


JACOB TOKARS/The Stanford Dail^
Admits from the Class of 2007 gather around the Claw last weekend. Beginning this fall, stu
dents applying early to Stanford, Harvard or Yale will all face the same early admission policies
Harvard has always had a non
binding program.
"At Stanford, we made this
change because we wanted to con
tinue to offer an early option for stu
dents for whom Stanford was in fact
the clear first choice, and we also
wanted to ease the pressure of hav
ing to commit before May 1," Mam
let said.
According to Harvard, about 8
percent of the students accepted
early this year withdrew their appli
cations because of acceptances to
other schools with binding Early
Decision programs, creating a slight
decrease in early yield compared to
previous years.
"Our return to a single early ap
plication policy is far better for stu
dents," said Harvard President
Lawrence H. Summers in a press
release. "It is more closely aligned
with the original intent of early ad
mission programs, which are de
signed for students with a clear and
well-considered interest in a partic
ular college or university."
Stanford students have different
opinions on the Harvard change.
"I would have still applied to
Harvard early because it was my
only early application," said fresh
man Tanya Haj-Hassan, who ap
plied to Harvard early last year and
was deferred. She was accepted in
the regular application pool.
"I'm not sure what made me
choose Stanford over Harvard," she
said. "I think I based my decision on
instinct. I had never visited either
university and knew very little about
them. Something told me that I
would be happiest at Stanford so I
chose to come here."
Another freshman, Vinay Maha
gaokar, emphasized that he didn't
know where he wanted to go to
school, so applying to multiple
schools early was a good option.

"I applied to MIT and Harvard
Early Action because I didn't have a
first choice school, but I wanted to
find out if I got in anywhere in De
cember. Had this new policy been in
place when I applied, I probably
wouldn't have applied to Harvard
early because it wasn't my first
choice," Mahagaokar said.
With their prospective policy
changes, Stanford, Yale and now
Harvard are all acting in violation of
admissions guidelines set forth by
the National Association for College
Admission Counseling, which stipu
late that a student should be able to
apply to other colleges without re
strictions. Princeton and Brown are
among other universities also in
conflict with the NACAC rules, as
they have already refused to change
their one-school, binding Early De
cision programs.
In a letter to the NACAC Vice
President for Admission Martin A.
Wilder, Jr., Mamlet wrote, "I regret
very much the awkwardness of the
relationship in which we now find
ourselves, relative to NACAC. I have
only the utmost respect for this orga
nization, and would never place
Stanford in opposition to it lightly...
My belief is that, given the realities of
today's highly competitive atmos
phere, single-choice Early Action in
fact is the best practice."
The NACAC has been relatively
responsive to the violations of these
universities, issuing a statement in
dicating that the institutions will not
be sanctioned.
"Articles in the national media
have created widespread awareness
of some high-profile instances of al
leged noncompliance with
NACAC's Admission Decision Op
tions document," Wilder said. He
added, "We are facing mounting
challenges to our standards as new,
restrictive Early Action policies
emerge. Therefore, it does not ap
pear prudent to pursue sanctions
against members, at least without
first revisiting the language of our
standards."
