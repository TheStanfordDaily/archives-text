# Harvard changes early policy
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Responding to an unparalleled 25 percent
increase in early admission applications for its
class 0f2007, Harvard has reverted back to a
single-choice Early Action program for un
dergraduate admissions.
Beginning this tall, high school seniors
apply to Harvard's early admission program
will not be allowed to apply early admission to
any other university. This change means that
Stanford, 1 larvarcl and Yale will all have iden
tical early admission policies beginning next
year.
"I think Harvard's move is precisely the
right one: the policy that Stanford, Yale and

now Harvard have adopted makes clear to
students that applying early is appropriate
when you have a clear first-choice college,"
said Dean of Admission and Financial Aid,
Robin Mamlet.
Last year, Harvard allowed students to
apply to binding Early Decision programs at
other schools, in addition to its Early Action
program. Stanford and Yale have always re
quired that students apply to only one early
admission program. Both recently changed
their policies to create non-binding programs
in which students are allowed to apply toother
schools in the regular admissions cycle and
wait until May to make their final choices.
