### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
As part of Holocaust Remembrance
Week, several dozen Stanford students
and community members met last night in
White Plaza to hold a candlelight vigil for
tolerance. Participants lit candles, ex
pressed personal thoughts and shared a
few moments of reflection.
"It wasn't an ethnic group doing this to
other ethnic groups, it was humans doing
it toother humans," said Palo Alto resident
Gordon Reade about the Holocaust. "As a
human, I feel the need to accept responsi
bility for what happened . .. and also to
forgive myself."
Reade's comments characterized a
small but intimate gathering that empha
sized togetherness.
"No event affects just one group," said
the week's organizer, sophomore Sophie
Roberts. "Holocaust Remembrance YVeek
is not just for Jews."
Said vigil organizer Jonathan Elkin, a
freshman, "It can be an opportunity for all
communities to think about the injustices
that are still going on. Hopefully our

shared grief in all of our groups' experi
ences will help us work together for justice
in all our communities today."
Another vigil organizer, freshman
Adam Schwartz, spoke along similar lines.
"It doesn't matter today if you're Jewish
or not. . . because we're all victims of the
Holocaust," he said. " The smallest of small
things we can do is be together and say we
won't let this happen again."
Although the event was small and seri
ous, it was also characterized by hopeful
ness.
"Seeing everyone here tonight gives me
hope that our future will be beautiful,"
Roberts said.
Having featured a Holocaust survivor's
speech on Monday, an author's talk about
anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial on
Tuesday and the vigil last night, Remem
brance Week has two events remaining.
Today at noon in Tresidder Oak West, for
mer U.S. Ambassador to the European
Union Stuart Eizenstat will discuss the fu
ture of America and Europe in the wake of
the conflict in Iraq. "The Pianist" is being
screened Sunday in partnership with
