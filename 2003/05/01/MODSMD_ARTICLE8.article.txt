# Sweet Hall begins to charge for printing
## 
### LESLIE COHEN 
Beginning next fall, Sweet Hall
will charge for printing privileges,
removing the printing quota that
is now in place. Representatives
from Information Technology
Systems & Services say that Uni
versity budget cuts have forced the
switch; students, however, have
expressed dissatisfaction with the
decision.
Under the current University
printing system, the dormitories,
Meyer Library, Tresidder, Green
Library and the graduate schools
are all maintained by Residential
Computing. Sweet Hall is under a
separate system maintained by
ITSS. While it does not currently
charge per sheet, each user may
print 100 pages per quarter free of
charge.
Sandy Send, executive director
of technology strategy and sup
port at ITSS, which oversees Sweet
Hall functions, explained the mo
tivation behind the printing
changeover.
"The move to charged printing
in Sweet is a direct result of the
budget reductions that ITSS will
have to take in the coming fiscal
year," Senti said. "The cost reduc
tions include the hardware, paper

and toner that are used for print
ing. The charging model will be
identical to that used by Res Comp
and the libraries in their PC and
Mac labs. We will have a project
over the summer to port the soft
ware that manages the charging to
Unix and begin charging in fall
quarter."
Many students who use this re
source are frustrated with the
ITSS' recent decision.
"It's very disappointing that the
University is charging us for some
thing else, considering how much
we already pay," said freshman
Guy Shory. "Unless there are sig
nificant abuses by students, such as
wasting paper, I really feel it
should be paid for as a student and
faculty service."
Printing was free in Green Li
brary until last year. This year,
people have used Sweet Hall as an
option to circumvent the new pay
ment system. Prior to the new pol
icy at tlie libraries, Sweet Hall was
used almost exclusively by com
puter programmers, but students
of all disciplines now brave the
UNIX-based computers to use the
free printing for anything from I-
Hutn reading to hundreds of
pages of seminar readings.
According to Ethan Rikleen,
network and systems administrator
at Res Comp, when people have
free printing they tend to print
four times the amount they would
if paying per page. Students are
not forced to consider, "Do 1 really
need or want this?" when they
print, he said.
In the past, Sweet Hall simply
included the cost of paper as part

of its operating budget. Program
mers alone never used up their en
tire page quotas, but printing has
skyrocketed with the influx ol stu
dents using Sweet Hall. Rikleen
commented that, "costs are going
up without any additional source
of income; [Sweet Hall doesn't]
have any sort of means to recoup
this cost without beginning to
charge for printing."
One student, freshman
Stephanie Adamowicz, would pre
fer that the old quota system re
main in place.
"Printing at Sweet Hall is a great
resource," she said. "I feel that

there already exists a quarterly
quota that ensures that students
will not take advantage of the free
printing and therefore to do away
with it completely is unnecessary. 1
also know that many people don't
ever even take advantage of the
free printing there at all."
Other students have shrugged
off this change, feeling that the
University has not outfoxed them
yet.
"Oh well, I guess I'll have to use
the Law Library for free printing
next quarter," said Huey Leong
Kwik. "And then, I guess that'll go
away, too."
