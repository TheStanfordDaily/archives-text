## Bush says major combat is over 
### 
ABOARD THE USS ABRA
HAM LINCOLN (AP) —Presi-
dent Bush, aboard an aircraft car
rier steaming home from war, said
last night "the United States and
our allies have prevailed" against
Saddam Hussein and will confront
any nation tied to terrorists.
"Major combat operations in
Iraq have ended," Bush said from
the deck of the USS Abraham Lin
coln, which launched thousands of
airstrikes on Iraq.
Bush flew to the carrier on a
Navy jet and made a screeching
stop as his plane was snagged by a
cable stretched across the deck.
He changed out of his flight suit
to address thousands of cheering
Navy personnel dressed in yel
low, green and powder-blue crew
shirts and crowded aboard the
sun-dappled deck to hear their
commander in chief.
"The liberation of Iraq is a cru

cial advance in the campaign
against terror," the president said.
"We have removed an ally of al-
Qaida and cut off a source of ter
rorist funding. And this much is
certain: No terrorist network will
gain weapons of mass destruction
from the Iraqi regime because that
regime is no more."
Bush sought to give the nation a
closure to the fighting while avoid
ing a sweeping claim of overall vic
tory. He said much still needed to
be done, including bringing order
to the country, finding weapons of
mass destruction, creating a demo
cratic government and pursuing
leaders of the fallen regime, in
cluding Saddam.
"The battle of Iraq is one victo
ry in a war on terror that began on
Sept. 11, 2001, and still goes on,"
he said.
Bush stopped short of declaring
victory or an end to the war. Such

declarations could trigger interna
tional laws requiring the speedy re
lease of prisoners of war, limiting
efforts to go after deposed Iraqi
leaders and designating the United
States as an occupying power.
"Our mission continues," he
said. "Al-Qaida is wounded, not
destroyed. The scattered cells of
the terrorist network still operate
in many nations, and we know
from daily intelligence that they
continue to plot against free peo
ple. The proliferation of deadly
weapons remains a serious dan
ger. The enemies of freedom are
not idle, and neither are we."
While promising to be a "loyal
friend" to any nation that helps his
anti-terrorist campaign, Bush said,
"Any outlaw regime that has ties to
terrorist groups, and seeks or pos
sesses weapons of mass destruction,
is a grave danger to the civilized
world, and will be confronted."
