CELTIKSUYU, Turkey (AP) — Rescuers
dug frantically in the rubble of a middle
school dormitory Thursday, hunting for
more than 100 children believed trapped
after a powerful earthquake rumbled
through southeastern Turkey. At least 100
people were killed and 1,000 injured, officials
said.
The headmaster said 198 students —
ages 7 to 16 — were sleeping in the building
when the quake hit. Rescuers found the bod
ies of 11 children and one teacher in the flat
tened building, but 72 children were res
cued, officials said. Many others were feared
dead, but youngsters could be heard
screaming in the rubble, rescue worker

Muhsin Balgi said.
"We hope another 50 students will be
saved," Balgi said.
A civil defense official at the site said at
least eight children had been located alive.
One child's feet were crushed, but the others
were in good condition and had received
water from rescuers, the official said, speak
ing on condition of anonymity.
"My friends are waiting for help in there,"
12-year-old Veysel Dagdelen was quoted as
saying by the Anatolia news agency after he
was rescued. "They were calling for help as
they were pulling me out."
The magnitude-6.4 quake struck at 3:27
a.m. and was centered just outside Bingol.
