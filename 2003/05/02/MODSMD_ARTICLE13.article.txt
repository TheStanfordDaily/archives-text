GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” Is
raeli troops stormed a Hamas strong
hold yesterday, setting off the most in
tense gunbattle in the Gaza Strip in 2
1/2 years of fighting, just a day after me
diators presented a Mideast peace
plan. Twelve Palestinians were killed,
including two children and a top
bombmaker.
Palestinian officials and Israeli op
position leaders accused Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon of using the raid to un
dercut the new Palestinian prime min
ister, Mahmoud Abbas, before he has a

chance to fulfill a promise to disarm
militias.
However, a Sharon adviser said Is
rael would not halt its anti-terror cam
paign and would not give Abbas, sworn
in Wednesday, a grace period.
The Israeli incursion pitched more
than 200 Palestinian gunmen with anti
tank missiles, grenades and homemade
explosives against Israeli soldiers who
fired machine guns and tank shells.
Sixty-five Palestinians were wounded,
including 15 critically.
The violence came just a day after

international mediators presented a
new peace plan, the so-called "road
map" to Palestinian statehood within
three years. The Palestinians have ac
cepted the plan, while Israel has ex
pressed major reservations.
The road map starts with a Palestin
ian crackdown on terror groups and an
Israeli freeze on Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, com
bined with a gradual Israeli pullout
from the autonomous Palestinian
zones its troops have reoccupied dur
ing 31 months of fighting.
