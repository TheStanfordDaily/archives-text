## Donate blood today 
### 
Each quarter, the Stanford Blood
Center comes to campus, seeking
much-needed blood from healthy
student, faculty and Stanford com
munity donors. Sending its friendly, experi
enced staff out with the Bloodmobile, the
center offers students a sweet deal: one pint
of blood in exchange for as many cookies
and cups ofjuice as anyone could desire.
In spite of these inviting prospects, how
ever, student donation remains dismally
low. Fewer than 300 Stanford students
showed up for the center's drive last quar
ter, more than a third of whom came from
just three residences (Phi Psi, Ujaama and
Burbank). Most dorms produced dona
tions in the single digits, and five residences
(Chi Theta Chi, Durand, Mars, Kimball
and Toyon) had only one representative.
In recognition of the substantial in
equality between blood supply and de
mand, the center has responded by offer
ing additional incentives to the Stanford
community. In addition to handing out
free T-shirts to individual donors who
give blood at all three annual drives (the

average individual can give up to six times
a year), the center boasts the Crimson
Donor Competition between dorms: The
two residences with the highest percent
age of blood donors receive a foosball
table for the quarter.
Yet even after attempting to tap the pow
erful forces of foosball and Stanford dorm
spirit, these blood drives do not muster the
support they deserve. Considering the
time and sympathy that Stanford students
are currently giving to the issue of fresh
men and their alcohol, this lackluster
turnout for blood drives is disappointing.
After Sept. 11, people around the
country rushed to donate blood to help
the victims of the terrorist attacks. It is im
portant to remember, however, that blood
is quickly perishable and that many peo
ple desperately depend on blood dona
tions to stay alive every day.
The Stanford Blood Center has made
every effort to attract more student
donors to their quarterly blood drives and
we hope that students will respond —
even without the cookies and juice.
