# Library security inefficient
## 
### 
Many of Stanford's campus op
erations function on highly
advanced technology. This is
not surprising since the Uni
versity is nestled in the Silicon Valley.
Many day to day necessities of student life
have turned digital in recent years: regis
tration, most coursework, and soon, even
financial aid will be processed and accessi
ble through electronic communication. As
a result, University life is remarkably effi
cient, even making possible the rigorous
three-quarter academic year, complete
with shopping periods and deadlines for
both dropping and adding coures each
quarter.
Considering how students and admin
istrators have come to value this technolo
gy and efficiency, one aspect of the cam
pus operations seems oddly out of place:
Green Library book security.
Especially during midterm and finals
weeks, when many visit the Bing Wing or
the Lane Reading Room to study from
dawn 'til dusk, students often resent the
hassle — and near insult — of having
their bags inspected every time they exit
the building. Some type of book security is
surely justified and undoubtedly neces
sary, but the current mechanism is anti

quated and inefficient. Not only is it slow
and cumbersome to manually check each
student's bag, but in truth, the process is
defensless against a deviantly motivated
individual.
Many libraries use an electronic system
instead. Such an investment, while initial
ly costly, is simple and effective for every
one: Students don't have to wait in line or
shuffle books, library staff don't have to
look through bags, and with the technolo
gy currently available, security would be
actually be much tighter. Even if staff were
still required at library portals to register
visitors, let in students without cards and
minimally deter individuals from bring
ing in food, students and staff would both
benefit from avoiding these long and
wearisome exits from the library.
So why hasn't the University taken ac
tion? The issue is simply not a priority for
Stanford. Installing such a system would
cost upwards of $1 million; recent budget
cuts have pushed this particular proposal
even further down the list. Yet we hope
that the University will keep this in mind
when drafting the next set of campus ren
ovation proposals, as it would surely fit the
rest of the Stanford lifestyle in efficiency
and up-to-date technology.
