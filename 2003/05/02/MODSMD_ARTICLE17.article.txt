## Questioning safety at Stanford 
### 
The Daily editorial "Sex
ual assault education"
(April 29) raises some
important points about
informing students on how to
prevent unwanted sexual ad
vances on campus and made me
think about the overall safety at
our seemingly Utopian school. I
encourage you to read it if you
haven't already. Yet even this
well-intended piece misrepre
sents the issue.
The editorial states that seven
on-campus sexual assaults were
reported last year. I'm sure the
unreported number is far high
er. Within the general discussion
of sexual assault, there is a huge
gray area of how to define un
wanted sexual acts. The law says
one thing, your resident assis
tant says another and your in
stinct has yet another definition.
More ambiguous sexual viola
tion happens with startling fre
quency.
Education for freshmen must
also include information about
making healthy and good deci
sions that they can live with. This
is especially important since
freshmen year is the first time
many sheltered Stanford stu
dents experiment with alcohol,
and therefore experience the
judgment-impairing effects of a
couple of shots.
Going through RA interviews
for the past month, resident fel
lows asked me about my biggest
apprehension regarding the RA
position. My response was that I
was afraid of dealing with resi
dents who had been sexually as
saulted, an experience that can
be so destructive to students that
it must be handled delicately. I
would have no idea how to deal
with it, so the editorial really

spoke to me.
Attending the party planning
meeting for Exotic Erotic last
week, I heard from representa
tives of Residential Education
how anxious they are about the
party that boasts nudity and
promiscuity. ResEd demands
appropriate behavior to prevent
sexual assault when possible.
This meeting showed me how

conscious ResEd
and the adminis
tration are of the
dangers of being
a Stanford stu
dent.
Beyond sexu
al assault, what
are the safety
threats to mem-

bers of the Stanford community?
I can't deny that this campus
feels incredibly safe. This is one
of the greatest aspects of Stan
ford — we don't have to worry
about the dangers posed at
places like Columbia and (JSC.
We have a certain freedom here.
Girls walk home alone at night,
people keep their doors un
locked.
Sometimes people feel a little
too safe. In my experience,
drunk driving is rampant on
campus. Despite the existence of
5-SURE, the golf-cart taxi ser
vice that can get you to a party at
Suites if you aren't sober, drunk
driving — though taboo — hap
pens all the time.
I wonder if we are really as
safe as we feel. I don't want to
jump to conclusions or sound
like a paranoid freak because
honestly, I believe Stanford is a
safer campus than many. Then
again, the United States felt free
from terrorist attacks on our soil
and then Sept. 11 came along

and shattered that naivety.
Each year, the Department of
Public Safety publishes The
Stanford Safety & Security Al
manac and distributes it to every
Stanford resident. According to
this publication, 31 cars were
stolen, six hate crimes motivated
by racism were committed, 21
students were guilty of drug vio
lations and 419 bikes were
stolen.
And these are just the report
ed statistics. Think about all the
other crimes that happen that
don't seem worth reporting to
the police — your laptop being
taken out of your room, your
wallet disappearing from your
backpack, your purse suddenly
missing from the dark corner at
SAE. With more serious viola
tions, like sexual assault and
hate crimes, the fear and shame
associated with these experi
ences silence the very people
who shouldn't be silenced.
How can we eliminate future
crimes? How can we prevent
something much more catas
trophic from happening? Would
you know how to use the blue
light emergency phones on cam
pus? I know I wouldn't.
Trust and confidence are es
sential elements to living a
happy life. There is no point in
living in fear. But being aware of
the threats that do exist and try
ing your best to prevent them is
a good idea. The issue is recog
nizing places where security
could be breached and trying to
fill in these holes. Efforts like im
proving sexual assault education
are a first step towards a safer
campus.

pus? I know I wouldn't.
Trust and confidence are es
sential elements to living a
happy life. There is no point in
living in fear. But being aware of
the threats that do exist and try
ing your best to prevent them is
a good idea. The issue is recog
nizing places where security
could be breached and trying to
fill in these holes. Efforts like im
proving sexual assault education
are a first step towards a safer
campus.
