Nadinne Cruz's departure is the
'loss of a devoted and tireless member 7
from Stanford community
As an alumna who deeply benefitted
from Nadinne Cruz's mentorship and
scholarship, I read with shock and sad
ness the announcement by Provost
Etchemendy that she will be departing
next month from her position as director
of the Haas Center for Public Service.
Over the last nine years, Nadinne has
built a pre-eminent public service center
that is currently ranked first for service
learning among colleges and universities
by the U.S. News & World Report and
viewed as a model by educators and gov
ernments both in the United States and
internationally.
In addition to her distinguished
tenure at Stanford, she has touched the
lives of countless students, inspiring a
commitment for public service by acting
as a mentor, educator and adviser. She
has also anchored the Okada Asian-
American undergraduate theme house
for seven years as a resident fellow.
With Nadinne's departure, Stanford

suffers the loss of a devoted and tireless
member of the campus community as
well as a nationally renowned leader in
the field of public service and service
learning. Critically, Stanford has also lost
a high-ranking woman of color in the
leadership of the administration and yet
another exceptionally popular faculty
member of color.
As the national search committee con
cluded in its decision to promote her to
the director position three years ago,
Nadinne's leadership is irreplaceable
and it is unfortunate that the University
could not keep her.

Reader disgusted with arguments debat
ing the history of Armenian genocide
While as a lawyer, I usually adhere to
the notion that there are always two
sides to every story, I am a little sur
prised and certainly troubled by the in
clusion of two guest columns, "Armeni
an Genocide an important, complicat
ed historical event," (April 30) and
"Turkey must officially recognize the

Armenian Genocide" (April 24), cover
ing the Turkish viewpoint of the Arme
nian Genocide. It appears that the
Turkish argument now, after years of
evolution, is that the Armenians were
collaborating with the invading Rus
sians, that the Turkish authorities hon
estly saw this as a threat and therefore
the relocations were justified.
This is preposterous. Were there
some Armenians who disliked Turkey,
were disloyal and sided with the Rus
sians? Of course there were, and despite
the fact that it might be argued that this
stance was even justified, how does that
fact justify knowingly destroying a whole
race, including women, the elderly and
children?
The other current Turkish tactic
seems to be to point out the Armenian
assassinations of Turkish officials in the
1970s and 1980s. This is a tactic often
used by Genocide deniers who redirect
the discussion away from the actual
events in question. Of course, the vast
majority of Armenians do not agree with
the actions of these fanatical Armenians
and realize that the way to proper recog
nition of past Turkish crimes is through
academic and political endeavors.
In sum, if you look at the 80-odd
years of history of Turkish denial of the

Armenian Genocide (for the Turkish
government did in fact recognize these
atrocities immediately after World War
I), the Turkish stance has followed an
evolution similar to the tactic used by
many defense lawyers in our country
when defending obviously guilty crimi
nals. These tactics include, "My client
wasn't there," "If he was there, he actu
ally couldn't have done it," "OK, if he
did it, he has been charged with the
wrong crime," and finally, "It's the right
crime, but it was self-defense."
As an Armenian I am, frankly, insult
ed by Ihe Daily's inclusion of these
Turkish so-called arguments. I am in
sulted that some < ircles of the press, and
even some small circles of academia,
have allowed the Armenian Genocide to
be turned into a so-called debate.
I he simple fact that these incontro
vertible facts have been turned into a de
bate is a huge victory for the govern
ment of Turkey and other Genocide de
niers. Adding to my insult, is that this so
called debate was created in The Daily,
around April 24, the day of remem
brance for Armenians who perished in
the Armenian Genocide.
