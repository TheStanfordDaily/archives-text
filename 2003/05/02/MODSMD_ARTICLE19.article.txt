tles UC-Davis at 1 p.m.
The winners of Saturday's
games advance to Sunday's MPLL
Championship to be played at 1
p.m. The consolation final will be
played at 11 a.m.
The weekend provides two im
portant games for the Cardinal
and a great opportunity for fans to
see more top-notch competition on
the Farm.
"Stanford fans have been able to

see some really top national
lacrosse because of our schedule,"
Uhlfelder said. "I think this is an
other example of people, lacrosse
enthusiasts and kids having a great
experience on our campus. We're
excited to host it. It's been our mis
sion to promote the growth of the
game."
The Cardinal played six teams
from last year's NCAA tourna
ment, including top-ranked Loy
ola, during the regular season.
Stanford earned the top spot in
the MPLL tournament with a 14-6
victory over California in their final
home game of the season last week.
The Bears, last year's host, are the
second seed.

While the quality of play within
the league has improved, in order
for the regular season league
champion to obtain an automatic
bid to the NCAA tournament, 16
teams must constitute the league
and each member must have com
peted within it for at least two years.
Even if Stanford's league tide
had secured a birth in the NCAA
tournament, Uhlfelder says the
Cardinal's steady focus is on incre
mental gains rather than popular
hype.
"I think our players are very
much focused on improving game
to game and working on putting
together a really solid 60 minute
performance," Uhlfelder said.

"They're very level-headed
about what they want from this
weekend's challenges. They let
everyone else read into the rival
ries."
Stanford will look to build on
the lessons it learned on its most re
cent road trip.
"I think our defense has some
thing to prove coming out of the
weekend and our New York trip,"
Uhlfelder said. "Every game has
taught us a little bit more about
what we need to do to play the
game at a higher level than how we
played before. We're sort of a dif
ferent team now than we were in
the beginning of the year."
Stanford routed Colgate, 13-2

thanks to a dominating defensive ef
fort, but the Cardinal attack will focus
on problematic aspects they experi
enced in their loss 12-9 to Cornell.
"In transition, our confidence
level with moving the ball is some
thing we struggled with at Cor
nell," Uhlfelder said. "We had
some key turnovers. I think they're
going to look to approach the tran
sition with a very aggressive men
tality."
Despite the higher stakes of this
weekend's games, the Cardinal's
approach is unchanged.
"It's really important for our
team to approach every game the
same, whether we're in league or
out of league," Uhlfelder said.
