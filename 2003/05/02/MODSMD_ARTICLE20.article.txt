# Cardinal looks for jumpstart on L.A. road trip

LOS ANGELES — There's no place
like . .. the road?
Three days after what head coach
Mark Marquess called an "embarrass
ing" loss to Santa Clara on Tuesday

night and one week after a series loss to
Arizona, No. 9 Stanford embarks on its
season-long seven-game road trip be
ginning tonight at Southern California.
The Cardinal (28-14, 10-5 Pacific 10
Conference) has lost three of four
games and was shut out for the first
time this season on Tuesday night,

playing some of its poorest baseball of
the season at an absolutely critical time.
Marquess admitted after the 2-0 loss
to the Broncos that he wasn't sure what
his team must do in order to right the
ship
"1 don't know. I don't know. Embar
rassed, embarrassing performance," lie
said.
Maybe Marquess should turn to the
recent Cardinal baseball history books,
which oddly enough seem to suggest
the Cardinal is right where it wants to
be.
In 2002, the Cardinal dropped
three of four at the end of April and
bounced back to win six of its next
seven and eventually earn a trip to the
College World Series for the fourth
consecutive season.
And a year before that, Stanford
slumped in April as well, losing six of 10
contests at the end of the month and in
early May. That team lost just four
more times the rest of the year, the last
of which coming in the national cham
pionship game to Miami.
While the Cardinal's late April
swoon may be familiar territory, there
is still reason to be concerned.
USC (25-19, 9-6 Pac-10) has won 10
of its last 12 games — including live
straight — and the Trojans are just one
game behind Stanford in a tight con
ference race where four teams are with
in one game of each other with just nine
league games remaining.
Though Marquess insisted Tuesday
night "there is no bright side," Stanford
has won seven straight games away

from Sunken Diamond, a streak that
began with a pair of victories over No. 8
Arizona State in Tempe.
With Stanford's status as a top-eight
national seed in doubt (and the loom
ing possibility that it would not host a
Super Regional for the first time since
the new format was introduced in
1999) — the Cardinal must find a sense
of urgency and begin turning things
around starting tonight.
It is no surprise that junior John
Hudgins will take his usual starting spot
tonight for Marquess, but Trojan head
coach Mike Gillespie gets to see his pre
season No. 1 starter, junior Anthony
Reyes, take the mound on a Friday for
the first time since Feb. 14.
Reyes was sidelined for two full
months with an elbow injury, a devas
tating blow that dropped the Trojans
from the nation's top 25 and had them
sift ing around .500 for most of the sea
son.
USC has brought Reyes back to ac
tion carefully and Gillespie's patience
seems to have paid off. Last Saturday
against Oregon State, Reyes posted his
longest outing of the year (6 2/3 in
nings) and was impressive, allowing
just six hits and one run while fanning
six Beavers.
Hudgins took his first loss in a month
