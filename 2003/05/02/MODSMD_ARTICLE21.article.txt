You think Barry Bonds blasting splash hits into
McCovey Cove at age 38, Michael Jordan drain
ing fadeaway buzzer-beaters at 40 and Jesse
Orosco throwing, uh, junk at 108 is impressive?
Even more, you think Bonds playing through sore
hamstrings, Jordan battling weak knees and Orosco
courageously refusing the aid of a walker to get from
the bullpen to the mound is admirable?
Well then, you gotta love 56-year-old Laffit Pincay
Jr. — all five feet and 113 pounds of him.
Pincay, the winningest jockey in horse racing histo
ry with an astounding 9,530 trips to the winner's circle,
reluctantly retired Tuesday after doctors advised him
not to ride again following an accident two months ago.
Throughout his storied career, Pincay broke more

ribs than a butcher at a steakhouse,
suffered two punctured lungs, two
broken thumbs and a sprained ankle.
Oh yeah, he also broke his collarbone
—11 times.
Sadly, the announcement came
just days before he was scheduled to
ride in tomorrow's 129 th running of
the Kentucky Derby, horse racing's
most prestigious event.

But like Bonds and his bats, Jordan and his Pippen,
Orosco and his bionic arm, Pincay was only as good as
the horses he rode.
Tomorrow, one horse will gallop gallantly around
the one-and-one-quarter-mile track at Churchill
Downs for approximately two minutes, pocketing his
owner $815,200 and bettors millions more.
And what does the winning horse get?
No, not a Mr. Ed DVD collection, a helping of ge
netically engineered giant carrots or a golden trough.
Just a blanket of roses, a photo opportunity and
most importantly, his name in the record books as a
part of horse racing history.
While most people won't remember if the winning
horse was brown or black, wore blinkers or had nice
teeth, a name (as children named Biff or Gertrude can
attest) is forever.
Take Kentucky Derby record-holder Secretariat,
No. 35 on ESPN's 100 greatest athletes of the past cen
tury. The name is now synonymous with greatness.
Several of the past winners have been blessed with
some truly classic names, such as Go For Gin, Macbeth
11, Behave Yourself, Spend A Buck andTomy Lee (no,
Pamela was not his jockey).
At the same time, there are the poor horses whose
Derby-winning legacy is tainted by the absolute shame of
the names bestowed upon them: Burgoo King, Hill Gail,
Sunny's Halo and Fusaichi Pegasus to name but a few.
So, the question is, who's next?
Here's a look at some of tomorrow's neigh-sayers
(with odds for entertainment purposes only):
Peace Rules (6-1): Pure genius. Can you think of a
better way to make a political statement than with a
horse? (OK, besides forming a human chain to block
rush hour traffic on San Francisco's busiest streets).
If history were any indication, the owner would
have been much better off naming this horse Weapons
of Mass Destruction, War Rocks or Colin Powell. (Such
military-focused monikers as War Admiral, Dust Com
mander and Lieut. Gibson have all won the Derby.)
Domestic Dispute (30-1): I'm not exactly sure what
