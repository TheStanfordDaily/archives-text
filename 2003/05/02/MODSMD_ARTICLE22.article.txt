## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Elite track and field competi
tion returns to Cobb Track & An
gell Field this weekend as Stanford
plays host to the storied Cardinal
Invitational tonight and the in
tense rivalry of the Big Meet on
Saturday.
These meets are part of a series of
seven high-profile invitationals
being hosted on the Farm, including
the NC AA West Regional Champi
onships and the U.S. Outdoor Track
and Field Championships.
The Cardinal Invitational is
known for attracting some of the
best athletes in the U.S. and
around the world. This event has
seen the fall of five national records
in the last two years including the
American men's and women's
10,000 records.
This year should be no different
with names such as Mebrahtom
Keflezghi, Alan Culpepper, Abdi
Abdirahman, Benita Johnson and
Flva Dryer entered in the races this
weekend.
The featured events of the
evening are the 10,000-meter
races. The men's field will feature
Abdirahman and Culpepper, the
second- and third-place finishers in
the event at the U.S. nationals last
year. Also entered is American
5,000 record holder Bob Kennedy,
who is staging a comeback after bat
tling injuries for the last two years.

Johnson and Dryer are headlin
ing a talented women's field. Meet
planners say that Johnson may at
tempt to break the Australian
10,000 record of 31 minutes, 11.72
seconds.
There is also a strong contin
gent of Stanford runners in the
elite fields. Juniors Grant Robison
and Seth Hejny will be making
their season debuts at the 5,000 dis
tance.
Redshirt freshman Neil Davis,
junior Isaac Hawkins and sopho
mores Chris Emme and Robert
Smitson will be attempting to hit
the NCAA national automatic qual
ifying standard of 29:00 in the
10,000.
Redshirt freshman Ryan Hall
will be making his individual sea
son debut in the 1,500 after run
ning on Stanford's winning relays
last weekend at Drake.
Senior Ail-American Erin Sulli
van will be gunning for the NCAA
qualifying standard of 34:10 in the
women's 10,000.
These athletes will then turn
around and join their teammates
in battling cross-bay rival Califor
nia at the 109 th men's and 24th
women's Big Meet tomorrow
evening.
Stanford men and women have
swept Cal for the last two years.
The women have scored more
than 100 points I)oth of those years
while the men defeated Cal by a 94-
69 margin last year.

"I think the Stanford women
have one of the best dual meet
squads in the nation," Cal assistant
coach Ed Miller said. "The men's
team is very good as well. [Stanford
head coachj Vin has
done a great job of putting Stan
ford track and field on the map
again."
Since coming to the Farm,
has coached athletes to 16
individual and four NCAA team ti
tles in cross-country and track and
field. In 2001, also lead
the men's squad to its first Pacific-10
Conference title in track in 74 years.
But, the Cardinal will have its
hands full with the young and hun
gry Bears. On the men's side, Cal
freshman Teak Wilburn is one of
the top high jumpers in the nation
while sophomore Toby Atawo will
be a threat in the sprints.
leading the way for the sixth
ranked Cardinal men will be senior
Milton Little, who has been a hero
of sorts for his team in recent Big
Meets.
Little was the high scorer for the
Cardinal last year with 14 points
and his triple jump two years ago
keyed a one-point victory over Cal.
This year, Little will be competing
in the long jump, 100, 200 and
l>oth the 400- and 1,600-meter re
lays.
I he CCardinal should also be bol
stered by its stellar distance group
as well as throwers like seniors Nick
Welihozkiy and Omer Inan, who

are ranked nationally in the ham
mer and discus, respectively.
The eighth-ranked women will
benefit from depth in all event
areas. Aside from the dominant
distance squad, a corps of talented
sprinters as well as some of the
best throwers, vaulters and
jumpers Stanford has ever had
will attempt to crush the Golden
Bears once again.
"I'm not trying to get anything
out of this meet for myself," said se
nior NCAA champion Lauren
Fleshman, who will most likely run
the 1,500 and the 800 this week
end. "Beating Cal is the primary
goal."
Junior Jillian Camarena should
be a threat in the shot and discus
while the pole vault trio of senior
Kathleen Donoghue, junior Leila
Ben-Youssef and freshman
Samantha Shepard will attempt to
sweep the event for the Cardinal.
Junior Lindsey Johnson will look
to continue her hot streak in the
100-meter hurdles and defeat Cal's
Deanna Slaton at the 400 hurdles.
Both the 400- and 1,600-meter
relay teams will be looking to run
away with victories.
"It's going to be a close meet,"
Cardinal assistant coach Robert
Weir said. "It doesn't seem to mat
ter what the teams are ranked or
what performances they have done
at this meet.
"People have to be ready to
compete.
