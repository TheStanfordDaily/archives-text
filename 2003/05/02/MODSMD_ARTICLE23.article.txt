# Softball hosts No. 1 Arizona
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team enters its final
homestand of the year with one thing in mind:
upping its potential NCAA seeding.
The No. 15 Cardinal (36-20. 5-10 Pacific-10
Conference) will play host to the Arizona
schools this weekend — No. 1 Arizona and No.
11 Arizona State — and has a big chance to rack
up a few more quality wins.
"You always want to make a strong showing
before the seedings are made," junior pitcher
Dana Sorensen said.
Speaking of quality wins, Stanford has been
the only team this year to defeat the top-ranked
Wildcats (45-4, 14-1) in league play.
And there's one reason for that.
Stanford gets up for the big games.
"It's easier to play when you know you are
[going] against a good team," Sorensen said.
"We all get really pumped and are on the same
page in respect to knowing what we need to do
to win."
The last time the top-notched Wildcats and
the Cardinal faced off it was down in Arizona
territory where Stanford had the unenviable
task of facing freshman ace and NCAA Softball
Player of the Year finalist Alicia Hollowell. The
Pac-10 newcomer has been arguably the most
dominant pitcher in the league. She is third in
the league in ERA (0.76), second in innings
pitched (212.2) and first in both wins (30) and
strikeouts (289).
(Furthermore, Hollowell was named Pac-10
pitcher of the week for the second-straight
week and fifth time this spring after going 3-0

Softball
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford vs. No. 1 Arizona, 7 p.m.
Sunday: No. 15 Stanford vs. No. 1 Arizona, 1 p.m.

and pitching 23 innings with 30 strikeouts.
She's filled in for All-American Jennie Finch
quite nicely.)
But all that didn't mean much to fellow Pac
-10 freshman Gatalina Morris on April 11 in
Tucson. The Cardinal standout rocked Hol
lowell with two home-runs — including a lead
off homer — in leading her team to a big 4-3
victory.
"We came out hard from the beginning,"
Sorensen said. "It gave us a lot of confidence.
"[Now] we know, even if we don't score but
have some good at-bats and get on-base, we
know [we can break through]"
Leading the charge on the mound was
the two-time Ail-American Sorensen. She
racked up 12 strikeouts in the contest and
posted her second career win over the Wild
cats. (In fact, Sorensen's victories over Ari
zona account for two of the only three wins
that Stanford has ever recorded over the
Wildcats in the history of the softball pro
gram.)
This weekend the Cardinal will attempt to
repeat the feat twice following a nightcap
tonight against the Sun Devils.
Stanford and ASU have split a pair of
games this year, with the Cardinal winning 4-
1 as Morris hit a two-run homer and sopho
more Leah Nelson added a solo blast of her
own while Sorensen limited the Sun Devils to
two hits.
