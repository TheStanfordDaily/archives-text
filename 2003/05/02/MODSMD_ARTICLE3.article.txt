# Union, ABM contract expires
## Parties extend contract talks by two weeks 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
SEIU Local 1877, a union with
approximately 120 members work
ing on the Stanford campus, failed
to reach a setdement for renewing
its contract with American Building
Maintenance by yesterday. The
union's prior three-year contract
expired on Wednesday evening.
The University frequently sub
contracts campus cleaning duties to
ABM to complement its work force
of direcdy hired janitors.
According to Beth Trimarco,
communications coordinator for
Local 1877, a settlement was not
reached because ABM did not
make a proposal that "secured"
family health benefits for janitors.
"TTiat [request] was not met, nor
was there any move on the table that

came close to securing medical ben
efits for janitors' families," she said.
Amidst rising health care costs
and a national economic downturn,
Local 1877 janitors are facing the
prospect of having their health care
costs rise from the current $77 per
month to $144 per month, said
Flower De Leon, a union organizer.
About 500 janitors gathered in
San Jose yesterday to discuss their
next course of action. Trimarco
said that they announced at noon
their decision to continue bargain
ing with ABM for two more weeks.
The workers also established the
ultimatum that, if they do not re
ceive fully-paid family health bene
fits, they will vote on May 17
whether to strike.
Trimarco, commenting on the
tone of the gathering, said there
were "huge amounts of chanting
'huelga,' " which in Spanish means
"strike."
De Leon said that for the next
two weeks she anticipates janitors to

form picket lines in the buildings
where they work.
ABM officials could not be
reached for comment.
As Local 1877 and ABM contin
ue to debate contract details, the
University has pledged to maintain
its traditional role of non-involve
ment in negotiations between sub
contractors and their employees.
"Our experience is that the col
lective bargaining process works
best when a deal is struck between
both parties that they can live with
without interference," said Chris
Christofferson, associate vice
provost and director of Facilities
Operations, in a previous interview
with The Daily.
"We took that position pretty
firmly the last time this contract was
up for negotiation about three years
ago," he continued. "It has been a
consistent policy and it reflects im
plicitly the value we put on the
power of tools that die workers have
in terms of collective bargaining."
