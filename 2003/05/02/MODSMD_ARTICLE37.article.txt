# Watch out folks: 'A Mighty Wind' will blow you away

### PHIL FLORES 
Since the debut of the now classic
"This is Spinal Tap" in 1984, Christo
pher Guest has continually pushed the
envelope of the mockumentary genre
of film comedy. His subsequent films
(1996's "Waiting for Guffman" and
2000's "Best in Show") have established
Guest and collaborator Eugene Levy
(famous for playing the dad in the
"American Pie" movies) as filmmakers
in tune with the absurdities of Ameri
can culture. From the small-town
Broadway wannabes in "Waiting for
Guffman" to the obsessed dog owners
in "Best in Show," Guest and Levy's
films poke fun at these ignored facets of
Americana while remaining compas
sionate to its clueless cast of characters.
Their latest film, "A Mighty Wind," is
no different.
Set in the folk music scene, "Wind"
chronicles the revival of three fictitious
folk music acts as they reunite for one
final concert performance in New York
City. Like "Guffman" and "Best in
Show," the plot provides the movie

with its structure, while the heart of
the film remains its many odd-ball
characters. First and foremost are
Mitch and Mickey, the film's distort
ed version of Simon and Garfunkel,
played by Levy and Catherine
O'Hara. As in his previous films with

Guest, Levy gives a brilliant perfor
mance as Mitch, a drugged-out singer /
songwriter.
Michael McKean and Harry Shear
er, both "Spinal Tap" alums, return
with Guest as the Folksmen, a trio
whose one-word album titles belie their
serious musical subjects ("Skeletons of
Quinto" is about the Spanish Civil
War). Rounding out the folk music tri
umvirate are the New Main Street
Singers, a nine-member group that re
sembles a halfway house for orphans
more than a musical group. Among
them are Guest movie veterans Parker
Posey and John Michael Higgins.
One of the best things about Guest
movies is watching the amazing improvi
sational talent of the cast. Mainly
through one-on-one interviews, the ac
tors slide in and out of the scripted dia-

logue while
staunchly remain
ing in character.
With the way
Guest edits these
interviews, it is as if
each member of

the cast tries to outdo the other. It is a de
light to see.
Despite its resemblance to previous
Guest movies, "A Mighty Wind" takes a
more positive slant on its subject matter
and its characters. Unlike the charac
ters in "Waiting for GufFman," the mu
sical acts from Mitch and Mickey to the
Folksmen all demonstrate some sem
blance of talent. Their folk music songs
(written by Guest and Levy, among oth
ers) are pretty catchy, and you can un
derstand that there would be an audi
ence for them. Also absent from "Wind"

are truly annoying and hateful charac
ters like the J. Crew lawyer couple
(Posey and Michael Hitchcock) of "Best
in Show." This decision by Guest and
Levy is understandable, considering
the optimistic folk music subject they've
chosen.
While not as daring as Guest's previ
ous films, "A Mighty Wind" is a won
derfully funny movie in a sea of won
derfully unfunny, depressingly bad
movies. Guest and his cast are at the top
of their games, again revealing that
humor is inherent in everything.


Thie is what happens when you live too long in a bubble: It shrinks!
