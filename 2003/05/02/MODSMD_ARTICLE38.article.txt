# It's been 'Real' all rightâ€”a real disaster

HA HA. Booze, boobs and booty. This is
not high-class cinema. But I will admit, it's
been a long time since I've laughed so hard

at a movie.
Although "The Real Cancun" is being
hyped the first "Real World"-type reality
show to hit the big screen, diis movie is far

from the popular reality series. At least in
the "Real VVorld" there is some drama;
the characters interact with each other be
yond drinking and having sex

with each odier, and extremely cheesy
shots aren't added to "enhance" the
scenes. Bv contrast, diis movie feels

overproduced and even more fake,
and the characters were meticu
lously hanclpicked to ensure that
each, with the exception of one

couple, is capable of making
ridiculously stupid comments.
Let me emphasize that

"The Real Cancun" is not
for everyone. I was dis
turbed by the way the en
tire first half of the movie
centered on ridiculing
the nerdy guy that didn't
drink, and the overall
message that you can't have

fun without getting completely
wasted and hooking up with random people. I remember
thinking that the wet T-shirt contest in the first half of the
movie was straight out of a porn film. Even though I was
laughing like crazy at the trashy antics and ridiculous com
ments, I was definitely shocked.
With lines like "I just want girls around so I can butt-

fuck
em," and "If you have a

short dick, then my favorite posi
tion is with another motherfuck
er," this movie is raunchy enter-

tainment without any stops. The audience at Century 24
theater in San Jose seemed to enjoy it, cheering when the
hidden night bedroom camera showed a guy getting his
groove on and laughing at the guy who didn't have any
game. If that's what you want, then give this flick a spin;
otherwise, go watch a real movie.

"The Real Cancun" is something
like an extended bikini commer
cial crossed with "Girls Gone
Wild" and the diary of a high

school nerd. As my esteemed
critic Moon says, this is not
quality cinema. The makers of
"The Real Cancun" grouped

together some good-looking
girls and guys, set them up
in a Hugh Hefner-style
house on the sandy beach-

es of Cancun and gave
them VIP access to the
top party spots of the

legendary spring break
city. They then filmed
the ensuing drunken
hormonal rampage.

But the key to
watching a movie
like this is mood.

What type of movie are you in the mood for? If
you want a clown to earth depiction of college kids
struggling to establish meaningful relationships,
then this movie is probably not for you. But if you

want a taste of Cancun, spring break-style, with non
stop drinking, clubs full of dry-humping and the quest

for a great hook up, "The Real Cancun" can provide that.
And in the process of showing you lots of skin, the hilarious
one-liners of the movie will surely bring on tears of laughter.
Is this worth eight bucks of your money? Well, if you are
into sex, parties and a guy so nerdy that he runs away from
a blonde bombshell when she asks him to go on a midnight
skinny dip, then spend away.
