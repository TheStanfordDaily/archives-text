# San Francisco International Film Festival
## Damn good movies even without the glam 
### ANTHONY HA 
This year's 46th Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival was my first ever film
festival. I'd heard stories - the
mad excitement of Cannes, the wild par
ties at Sundance. Hell, even the Inter
mission reporters sent to the festival last
year came back buzzing about elegant

soirees and George Lucas-sightings. No such luck for me,
though. Of course, this was probably just because I didn't
go to the opening or closing night celebrations, nor did I
attend the premiere of a movie directed by Francis Ford
Coppola's son. Nope, the festival was, for me, just about
the movies. The only thing different about the experi
ence was heading over to SF's AMC Kabuki 8 (which, in
design, lies somewhere between your average soul-suck
ing multiplex and the shoeboxes that "art movies" are too
often consigned to), lining up with crowds of other excit
ed movie-goers next to walls plastered with cool-looking
posters in foreign-languages and filling out a couple of
survey cards at every screening. Luckily, the movies were
pretty damn good.
The San Francisco International Film Festival is orga
nized by the San Francisco Film Society. This year it ran
from April 17 to May 1. In addition to screening 124 films
from all over the world, the festival also included work
shops on do-it-yourself moviemaking and ceremonies
honoring veteran director Robert Altman and actor
Dustin Hoffman . What follows is a review of the minis
cule slice of programming Intermission managed to
catch:

The Century of the Self, Parts 1 and 2
Oh, great — another movie about the evils of con
sumerism. Wow, how daring and original! Except
this four-hour BBC documentary (it screened at the
festival in two two-hour blocks; I've only seen the first)
actually tries to locate the origins of America's con
sumer culture and trace its development. "The Cen
tury of the Self' argues that much of our current need
to buy! buy! buy! was fueled by the uses to which Sig
mund Freud's nephew, a pioneering advertiser, em-

ployed his uncle's ideas
about humanity's un
conscious desires and
goes on to illustrate the
other ways that Freud,
his ideas and his families
members have shaped
the world that we live in.
I wish that director
Adam Curtis had gone

for a little more depth and a little less breadth, as he
seems too intent on covering a lot of disparate topics
to examine any of them in depth (Freud's actual ideas
in particular are given short shrift). Also, I'm not sure
that a movie theater is the best place to experience this
square and rather grainy documentary, and one has
to wonder why the filmmakers are so obsessed with
American culture. Why not turn the same critical eye
on their own country? Still, there's a lot of thought
provoking material here — you'll definitely see the
world a little differently after watching.

Commandante
For his latest project, Oliver Stone spent three days
and three nights with Fidel Castro, shooting over 30
hours of his own conversations with the Cuban

leader. The men travel
around Cuba and dis
cuss the histories of
their two countries
since Castro took of
fice: the Bay of Pigs in
vasion, the Missile Cri
sis, the Elian Gonzales
case, global environ
mental problems, Che
Guevara and even
Castro's opinions on
American cinema.

Castro conies across as intellectual, deliberat
ing and witty. Some may say that Stone was
not hard enough on Castro, but the truth is

that Castro answers difficult questions with relative
ease, usually sounding truthful and only rarely eva
sive. This is a movie from which people can learn a lot
about U.S. - Cuban politics, but its best moments are
still the many unexpected ones (Castro saying
"Brigitte Bardot can count me among her admirers,"
or theorizing that a second gunman must have been
involved in the Kennedy assassination). Another mo
ment also stands out, in which the handheld camera
drifts down to Fidel's shoes; on the toes of each foot is
a little Nike swoosh.

Woman of Water

Ryo (Japanese pop
star UA), a girl whose
emotions govern the
weather (it rains whenev
er she's particularly
happy or unhappy), loses
her father and her fiance

on the same day. After a brief road-trip, she takes over
the operation of her father's bath house, where she
encounters a mysterious, fire-obsessed stranger
named Yusaku (Tadanobu Asano). Naturally, the two
fall in love, and together they struggle to escape from
personal grief and from dark pasts. This debut film
from Japanese director Hidenori Sugimori sounds like
a pretentious "art house" flick, and sure enough there
are bouts of obvious symbolism, not to mention por
tentuous shots of characters standing miserably/med
itatively in the rain. Sugimori's elliptical storytelling
style can be a bit confusing; I'm still not sure that I
completely grasp the story's plot.
However, "Woman of Water" is actually a surpris
ing, moving film. It proceeds on its own natural, un
hurried pace, taking its time to develop its characters

and their relationship and to
explore odd, seemingly ran
! dom backwaters of plot before
taking a couple of surprising
| left tnrns towards the end.
The two protagonists keep
growing in believability, hu
manity and depth as the
I movie progresses; 1 was so en-
I gaged and invested in Ryo
■ and Yusaku that when the
film's tragic ending came, I

was pretty damn close to bawling my eyes out. Both
actors give beautiful, subtle performances — UA
seems at once resigned, withdrawn and terribly sad,
while Asano's stoic exterior only barely hides a restless
anger. What really surprises, however, is how funny
"Woman of Water" can be. As with so many other el
ements of this movie, the humor seems natural and
unforced, growing out of the characters themselves.
"Woman of Water" is breathtakingly gorgeous. Cine
matographer Hiroshi Machida tints most shots with a
hint of blue and a watery distortion, giving the set
ting's lush landscapes and super-sensual sex a sense of
mystery and magic. Even if you're a little confused
about what's actually going on, the movie's imagery
still works itself under your skin and refuses to leave.

Monday Morning

In ways sort of like an admirable, soft ballad in the
middle of a CD you bought for its upbeat rock songs.
"Monday Morning" is excessively boring while man
aging an undeniable, gentle beauty. Its two hours cer
tainly felt like three or four, as we follow poor Vin-

cent, trapped in the mo
notony of a life-deflated
wife, indifferent kids
and the rusty, metallic,
m achine-groa ni n g
emptiness of the chemi
cal plant at which he
works.
We glimpse his ne
glected sensitive side at
tempting to paint water
colors while his wile de
mands he fix the gutter,
and we understand
when he takes a box of
old lire from his father
and takes a train to
Venice. Vincent pro
duces a series of exagger-

ated quotidian moments, as do his family
and co-villagers at home, represented by
French Georgian-emigre director Otar los
seliani with a certain poetic gentility. The
film becomes an exercise in the power of
artistic and cinematic abstraction; moments
and episodes in our life pass us by as mere
ly moments and episodes in our life, but
when such episodes are depicted on screen
or in a novel, they take on a certain enviable
purity, abstracted as they are into the easily
idealized world of art. Even the lonely, early
morning commute to work can assume a
positively poetic valence.
Unfortunately, the pace of the movie is
excruciatingly slow; there seem to be no
more the an a few hundred lines of dialogue
in the entire film. All told, it would be nice to
experience "the beauty of the little things in
life" in a slightly more entertaining way.

Owning Mahowny
"Please enjoy the exquisite presence of
the beautiful object commonly known as
Philip Seymour Hoffman."
I didn't think anything odd of the fact that
director Richard Kwietniowski opened the
SKIFF's showing of his film, "Owning Ma
howny," with these words. Hoffman was,
after all, the biggest draw of the film. After a
remarkable career as co-star and sidekick —
most recently as an outlaw Mormon in
"Punch-Drunk Love" and a pedophilic high
school teacher in"The 25th Hour" —
"Owning Mahowny" is Hoffman's rare step
into a leading role.
Fhe role of Dan Mahowny, a gambling
addict whose secret vice slowly bleeds into
his public life, has its pros and cons. It's not
one of those over-the-top caricatures Hoff
man's proven so good at (e.g., screaming
"No, fuck you!" at Adam Sandler at the top
of his lungs). The time bomb inside Ma
howny ticks silently and is shown best in ex
treme close-ups of the gambler at a blackjack
table blowing 500 grand. Mahowny's slow
deconstruction is not the kind of role that
will attract the popular eye, but Hoffman

proves just as
remarkable at
this unassum
ing kind of act
ing as he is at
any other.
J° h n
Hurt plays Vic
tor Foss, the
devilish, smoky
voiced casino
owner who acts
as Mahowny's
agent provoca
teur. Hurt is a
brilliant fiend,
even to the
point of stealing
scenes from the

glorified Hoffman as unnoticeably as Ma
howny steals from the bank he works at.
The film is well done, almost to the point
ofbeing scientific. It has a clean, structured
feel. Kwietniowski doesn't accomplish any
thing amazing here, but some incredible
performances propel the film into a worthy
view.

Piedras
'Tiedras" is ex
actly the type of film
one goes to the San
Francisco Interna
tional Film Festival
for. Generally fea
turing smaller and
mostly international
films, as opposed to
Sundance's medi
um-budget and
mostly domestic
films, the festival of
fers the opportunity
to see the best of
contemporary for
eign films. The pur
pose of such an op
portunity is to gain
those insights one
seeks from art about
far-off places, what
makes life the way it
is there and what are
the ways we are con
nected to such dis
tant people.
"Piedras" satisfies all
of this with grace,
beauty, intensity,
and humility.
Translated as
"Stones," the film is
the first feature
length attempt by
Ramon Salazar, who
made a highly-ac
claimed short a few
years ago called
"Hongos." Struc
turally, it is the story
of five women living
in Madrid, ranging

in ages from about 20 to 50. With buttery, al
most unfelt transitions, Salazar guides us
through moments in the lives of these loose
ly and randomly connected women. Each
deals with the birth-pains of self-revelation,
when one must squeeze out against all the
soul's and the mind's resistance the truths
about one's life, its lacks, its pains, and its
joys.
All this may sound trite enough, but
Salazar's narration makes every word, ges
ture and camera shot count to its fullest ef
fect. The cinematic style makes one feel as if

his artistic, directorial gaze and the cine
matic lens of the camera love and caress all
of the characters with tenderness. Many of
the characters are not beautiful; some are
ugly. But this tenderness is democratic;
Salazar applies it to the whole movie and all
its characters, spreading a soft hand over
the cinematic world with its Almodovar
esque balm.
This loving pathos reaches wonderful
heights with the youngest, most beautiful and
compelling protagonist, a girl named Leire.
The movie picks her up for an ending that
would seem to scream sappy: with a sunny
seascape of Lisbon in the background, Leire
gives a poetic voice-over about dreams that re
ally does manage to strike harmonious notes
in-line with the delicately scored piano ac
companiment that laced the resiol the movie.
I suffered two weeks ago through Robert
Duvall's attempt at geriatric tango, as I called
it. "Piedras" has its tango moment as well,
but try as 1 might, Salazar's film will not per
mit me any sarcasm or cynicism. Look for
ward to its wide release later this year.
