# Web site helps find Draw roommates

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
As this Sunday's deadline to
form Draw groups rapidly ap
poaches, the (<>mplel|ol l W 3 the
Rranner Hall renovation process
and the addition of a new Univer
sity Web site aiming to help stu
dents find potential roommates
are both expected to help alleviate
worries of students participating in
the Draw this year.
"Branner coming back on-line
means that we will not need to
house undergrads at Sharon

Green and Oak Creek next year
[and] they will no longer be offered
as choices in this year's Draw," said
Todd Benson, director of Housing
Assignrhent Services. "Sotf>, which
became an all-frosh residence this
year because Branner closed,
will be a four-class residence again
next year."
With 6,100 undergraduate bed
spaces on campus, the housing lot
tery has become a complicated
process, encompassing the forma
tion of Draw groups, offers of pri
ority status and two preferred
years for upperclassmen to decide

when to utilize.
According to Benson, most stu
dents choose to draw preferred
during their sophomore and se
nior years at Stanford.
"That's the general pattern,
since most students who attend an
off-campus program such as an
Overseas Studies campus do so
their junior year," Benson said.
"There are exceptions to the rule,
however, such as for students who
are planning to apply for an RA or
other staff" position their senior

year, those who decide to go over
seas their senior year instead of ju
nior year and so on."
According to Benson, a com
puter generates a list of random
numbers, which students are as
signed as they apply.
"We don't want groups to pick
members on the basis of their
Draw numbers, but on who they
want to live with," Benson said.
For students who are consider
ing drawing as singles, Housing
Assignment Services has created a
new Web site located at
http://matchmaker.stanford.edu,
designed to match people with
similar interests who could poten
tially draw together.
"The site asks you some ques
tions â€” are you neat, what hours

do you keep, what kind of music
do you like," Benson said. "You
can submit it, and students can
search it. We wanted to do some
thing for students who feel
stressed because they don't know
who to live with."
Students who do not have the
time or do not want to make the ef
fort to seek out opportunities to
gain priority at a campus residence
are often fearful that they will re
ceive low Draw numbers and in
evitably end up in a bad situation.
Yet Benson disagrees that housing
quality necessarily determines the
worth of a year at Stanford.
"The most important thing is
the community that you're with,"
he said. "Some of the most popular
houses on campus might not be
that great, depending on the com
munity there. Even if you don't
end up wit the best Draw number
or the best place, it can still work
out."
