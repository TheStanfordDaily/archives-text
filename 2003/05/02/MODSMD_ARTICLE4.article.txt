and the addition of a new Univer

worries of students participating in
the Draw this year.
"Branner coming back on-line
means that we will not need to
house undergrads at Sharon

Green and Oak Creek next year
[and] they will no longer be offered
as choices in this year's Draw," said
Todd Benson, director of Housing

became an all-frosh residence this
year because Branner closed,
will be a four-class residence again
next year."

spaces on campus, the housing lot

off-campus program such as an
Overseas Studies campus do so

however, such as for students who
are planning to apply for an RA or
other staff" position their senior
