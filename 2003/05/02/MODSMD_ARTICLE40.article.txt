# Madonna
## tells us all about this American Life' 
### JENNIE KIM 
I remember the won
der I felt when listen
ing to Madonna's last
album, "Music," in my
car on the very morn
ing of its release. I was
a senior in high
school, late to my first
period class and
threatened with de
tention as a result. No
matter, to me,
"Music" was a stun
ning example of
Madonna's ability to
transform and to
somehow always end
up a step ahead.
The same cannot be
said of "American
Life." Produced and
written with help
from Mirwais, the
trippy French house
musician who made

"Music" what it was, "American Life" shares the techno,
guitar-driven quality of its predecessor but lacks its ele
ment of spontaneity. Madonna, whose recording career
spans an incredible 20 years, has stuck around for so

long because of her knack for innovation and change.
On that level, "American Life" is disappointing.
However, the album in its entirety is far from being a
disappointment. It is almost as enjoyable and more joy
ful than "Music" — regardless of the initial controversy
of the title track, the majority of the album focuses on the
Material Mom's appreciation for all things familial, in
love and yogic and her shunning of, well, the material.
Songs like "Love Profusion" and "X-Static Process" are
odes to the ones she loves. It seems that the one-time
queen of controversy has settled down with a man and
children and, as a result, has found she no longer needs
to consume anything beyond what her macrobiotic diet
dictates.
These songs are heartfelt and sweet at the core and
are undeniably catchy, if not lyrically creative. The
album reveals more about Madonna's personal life than
any other in recent memory. In "Mother and Father"
she adopts a childish voice to mourn her mother, who
died when she was 5, and the subsequent emotional
withdrawal of her father: "Oh mother, why aren't you
here with me? / No one else could see the things that you
could see."
Her songs built with a critical message revolve around
our material and media-saturated culture. In "Holly
wood," she wryly comments, "There's something in the
air in Hollywood /1 lost my reputation, bad and good ..
. How could it hurt you when it looks so good?" More di
rectly, she talks about her growth in "I'm So Stupid" —
"I'm so stupid / Because I used to live / In a fuzzy dream
/ And I used to believe in the pretty pictures / That were
all around me."

alized, contraversy-seek
ing entertainer, but there is something awkwardly edged
about her criticizing the American life she has so indeli
bly shaped. 1 don't doubt her claims in "Nobody Knows
Me" ("I don't want no lies /1 don't watch TV / I don't
waste my time / Reading magazines"), but she must real
ize that she, herself, is what's out there. While the rest of
the country suffers from what she calls "a social disease,"
she guest stars on "Will and Grace," appears on " Total
Request Live" and is on the cover of People Magazine;
all of which erodes the sincerity of her protestations. It's
fine for her to flee to Britain to get away from it all, but
what are we to do?
In a notable experiment, Madonna's demonstrates a
charming but absurdly flawed attempt to rap — dis
played most prominently in "American Life" when she
quips "I'm drinking a soy latte /1 get a double shot /It
goes all through my body / And you know I'm satisfied."
When Madonna, a vocal fan of Eminem, is rapping
about soy and Pilates, it is clear that the genre has com
pletely filtered down; not necessarily from black to white,
but from urban to yuppie. Despite her Detroit origin.
Madonna shares none of Eminem's relevance.
Perhaps it is unfair to hold Madonna to a higher stan
dard than other pop musicians. For the rest, there's
nothing wrong with constancy. But Madonna has always
had something more, something different to say — or at
least something that mattered to the masses. That failing
in "American Life" is its insurmountable weakness.
