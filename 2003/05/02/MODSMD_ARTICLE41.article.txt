# Douglas clan can't save 'Family'
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
"It Runs in the Family" opens to happy smiling pic
tures of the Gromberg family, played by the Douglass
es. This is merely a glimpse of the nearly two hours of
self-indulgence that is to follow. Starring Michael Dou
glas as Alex Gromberg, a family man and lawyer strug
gling with all of life's difficulties: marriage, children,
work and a sarcastic father who just won't quit. Enter
Kirk Douglas, Michael's real-life father, playing
Mitchell, his aging dad.
The movie centers on Alex and Mitchell, though we
are introduced to each of the characters along with their
respective problems, one at a time, until they all run to
gether into a somewhat jumbled mess. Becky (Bernadette
Peters) is Alex's long-suffering therapist wife.
Asher (Cameron Douglas) is the couple's 21-year-old
son, a would-be hottie and wannabe playwright who
could be successful, if he weren't a DJ-ing, pot-dealing,
tattooed stoner.
Next we meet Alex and Becky's younger son, Eli
(Rory Culkin), a sixth grader also dealing with girl trou
bles. This youngest Gromberg is arguably the most like
able character in the film and the one who gets my vote
for best actor. His failing: small crush on a teenage nose
pierced punk runaway. Ah, the joys of puppy love. Eli

presents his parents with an "itemized
expense report" to ask for an advance

in his allowance (will probably someday be-

I 11 " " • I
It Runs in the Family j
. Dir. Fred Scliepisi

come a Stanford student), to which
his parents dub him "weird" and de
cide there is definitely something is
wrong with him.
Finally, the last notable charac
ter is Evelyn, Alex's elderly mother,
whose tenacity and pleasant person

ality make her the most obvious candi
date for elimination from the movie.
Thus, she dies. This is the point where
you hope it will get good. You hope that
there will be some sort of surfacing of
the pent-up hostility or resolution to the
seething passive-aggressiveness that has
been the undercurrent of the movie
thus far. We've met all the characters,
and we're ready for a full-on confronta
tion. And yet ...
The movie's failing is this: There are
too many little problems and not
enough big problems. There really
needs to be one main problem or con
flict to make a plot, and we think that
there will be a shift when we find out
about Evelyn's death, but the movie
never progresses beyond a series of
weak and predictable events. It never
resolves anything. This is a movie fea
turing lust, death, infidelity, possible jail
time and teenage runaways — yet still
manages to be boring and sappy. As far
as it is a drama it is melo at best, it could
be advertised as Dramaedy Lite (now
with extra Douglas!).

"It Runs in the Family" seems to take
pride in following a simple repetitive pattern:
Step one: Make an obvious statement.
Alex, "You know we could go to jail."
Step two: Make a sarcastic retort.
Mitchell, "If we're lucky we might be cellmates."
Step three: Cue sappy music.
It is a movie that wants to be heartfelt and cute and
milks poor Kirk for all he's worth, but just doesn't quite cut

it."It Runs in the Family" suffers because it is an "inaction"
movie. Not only are there no car chases or buildings being
blown up, there are no people exploding or getting really
angry. There is a communication breakdown that is never
resolved in the family or in the film. (Quite honestly I kept
hoping Catherine Zeta-Jones would make a cameo.) So,
your best bet in looking for a snappy family drama / com
edy — stay home and re.;t "SteDmom."
