# A 						likeable 'Love'
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
"The Guru of Love," a novel
set in early '90s Kathmandu, is
well aware of its overtures: The
title reeks of the subcontinent
and is an open invitation to cyn
icism, while the semi-spiritual sto
ryline invokes familiar themes
(cultural constipation filial fric
tion, adultery, third world de
spondency, pre-democratic un
rest, etc).
Yet, Nepali writer Samrat
Upadhyay must be credited with
potentially redefining sub-conti
nental diction. His minimalist
style and passive tone closely
mimic the characters' lives. If In
dian authors have constantly
used the English language as a
tool of condescension — a means
of turning the eloquence of Eng
lish against its colonial propri
etors, then Upadhyay is one of
the first to shed diat post-colonial
overwriting. Perhaps the reason
Upadhyay is so comfortable with
simple vocabulary is because he
has no crushing lineage to deal
with: He's the first Nepali author

to make it big in the
United States. (He
authored the criti
cally acclaimed col
lection of short sto
ries "Arresting God
in Kathmandu.")
The statutory
"bigness" of this
debut novel also
chimes with the fact
that "guru" and
"love" are essentially
exaggerations. The
central character —
Ramachandra — is

a lower-class mathematics
teacher who detests his culture,
his controlling in-laws and his
boring marriage. The plot sur
vives a series of implosions — the
major one being his affair with a
young student (Malati) — to end
in sexual joy. Still, there is noth
ing lush or lovely about Nepal or
the story, and the third person
narrator does well to keep his dis
tance.
At the very outset, the reader
is introduced to Ramachandra's
internal turmoil: "Sometimes he
found himself repeating the
word 'asthai.' until the sensation
of impermanence, of something
fleeting and flimsy, became part
of his image of himself, as if at his
birth the gods had decided to
stamp his forehead with a warn
ing to those around him —
TEMPORARY."
This turmoil is fueled by his
passive relationship with his wife,
Goma, who is clearly the most dif
ficult character in the novel and

The Guru of Love
Samrat Upadhyay

as much a victim as she is a god
dess. Shattered by Ramachan
dra's adultery, she forces Malati
to stay in her house and thus
bring shame upon her own fami
ly. She is also a dispenser — and
withholder — of spiritual solace.
"Will you forgive me, bhau
ju?" Malati asked.
"I don't have that power.
You'll have to forgive yourself,"
[said Goma].
It is this constant oscillation be
tween sexual earthiness and the
promise of solace that sustains
this 290-page novel. There are
times, however, when Upad
hyay, in an attempt to introduce
Nepal to the reader, comes across
as a well-trained docent rather
than a conscientious writer. The
delicate pre-democracy situation
is judiciously documented, but
seems like a forceful immersion

into context. ("My
personal problems
are my country's
problems," Ra
machandra retorts
at one point, uncon
vincingly.)
Further, if
Upadhyay has done
well to strip his coun
try of exoticism, he is
guilty of dousing all
his characters in an
unrealistic cynicism.
Everyone in a third
world country, it ap-

pears, is an artful dodger. More
over, there is also a fair amount of
clumsy foreshadowing in this
novel that could have been avoid
ed, and a majority of the charac
ters (especially die in-laws) are
rendered flat by their vileness.
The book's biggest success,
however, is its engrossing di
rectness. Culturally unaccept
able lines such as "His penis was
hard ..." might have a greater
effect on sub-continental litera
ture than a whole volumeful of
circuitous, poeticized writings.
In fact, fellow authors may well
take a cue to stop exploiting
their locales as crutches or
props to entice the Western
reader and instead shift their
focus on what matters: the heart
and the spirit, or at least the
promise of it. And it is for that
reason that Upadhyay must ulti
mately be congratulated for this
novel. "The Guru of Love" is
sure to be an important novel,
even if it is not a great one.

In fact, fellow authors may well
take a cue to stop exploiting

sure to be an important novel,
even if it is not a great one.
