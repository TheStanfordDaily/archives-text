Former ambassador to the European
Union Stuart Eizenstat spoke yesterday in
Tresidder Oak West about the future of Euro
pean and American relations based on current
reconstruction efforts in Iraq.
The event was co-sponsored by Hillel as
part of Holocaust Remembrance YVeek.
Eizenstat's new book, "Imperfect Justice:
Looted Assets, Slave Labor, and the Unfin
ished Business of World War II," focuses on
large reparations currently being granted to
Holocaust victims nearly 50 years after the
conclusion of the Second World War.
According to Eizenstat, many key players in
the victimization of Europe's Jewish population
still fail to admit their degree of involvement.
"The French have taught themselves that
the Vichy government was not the responsi
bility of post-war France," he said. "The Aus
trians still see themselves as the first victims of
Germany, rather than its first accomplices,
and the Swiss are still seeing themselves as
pristine neutrals when they helped Hitler fi
nance his war effort."
Using this historical analysis of the Second
World War, Eizenstat segued into the current
state of the European Union.
"With the scars of World War II healed, the
common cause that held the U.S. and Europe
together has eroded," he said. "It has become
a very clear notion that we make the rules for
ourselves. We want others to follow, but if they
don't, we will act on our own."
He went on to explain how the recent war
in Iraq has highlighted the difference between
American and European views of the world.
"We have a much different approach in how
we deal with so-called rogue nations," Eizenstat
said. "The way we've dealt with them is to iso
late them, insulate them and sanction them.
"The way the Europeans deal with them is
to negotiate with them, trade with them and

invest with them, hoping that by doing so, they
will change their conduct," he added.
Eizenstat cited the United States' willing
ness to use military force as one of the funda
mental differences dividing American and Eu
ropean interests.
"The Europeans have such an aversion
to military force that one wonders where
lies the red line that calls for its use at all,"
Eizenstat said. "We have to understand
that this aversion is very deeply rooted in
European history and recognize that this
often hobbles them from taking action
when they need to.
"[European countries] don't have enough
power individually and not enough cohesion
collectively, so they need the U.N. and other
organizations to have influence," he added.
The E.U.'s most recent project was the for
mation of common foreign security policy,
Eizenstat said. Yet, these efforts were thwarted
by the outbreak of war in Iraq as Spain, Italy and
the United Kingdom decided to support Amer
ican efforts, countering France and Germany.
He expressed his belief that a new coopera
tive policy needs to be developed in Iraq.
"Now that the war is essentially won, I think
it would be catastrophic for the U.S. to think
we can reconstruct Iraq alone," he said. "It
would be a huge economic burden to spend
$30 billion a year on reconstruction and sup
porting American troops for several years."
Eizenstat stressed that America must cooper
ate with the United Nations over Iraq's massive
debt, the oil resources and especially the struc
ture of die post-Saddam Hussein government.
"We need to do a better job of consultation
with Europe, and we need to be more sensitive
to their world view, and we need to accommo
date as much as possible," Eizenstat said. "But
Europe also has a responsibility to be willing to
use force appropriately, to build up defense
spending and to recognize that Europe and
America's futures cannot and should not be
separated."
