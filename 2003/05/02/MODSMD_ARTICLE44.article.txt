# Diamond discusses Iraq's future
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
President George W. Bush declared last night that hos
tilities in Iraq were over and that the United States will focus
on creating a representative Iraqi government. Before
Bush's speech, The Daily sat down with Larry Diamond, a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and co-editor of the
Journal of Democracy, to talk about the next steps in re
building Iraq.
The Daily: With President Bush set to declare the hostilities
in Iraq over, what do you see as the next major step?
Larry Diamond: I'd say there isn't one next major step.
Obviously, we need to give high priority to the construction
of a transitional government. This cannot for very long
simply be an American military occupation, or it's going to
quickly become illegitimate and contested on the ground.
I think there are two dimensions to the challenge that we
face in that regard. One dimension is to fairly rapidly en
courage the formations, from the ground up, of a transi
tional government that will be broadly representative of
Iraqi society and to which will be delegated increasing levels
of responsibility and authority over time.
Secondly, I think we urgendy need to internationalize
both our military presence and our political administrative
presence. The longer that we preserve our military pres
ence as purely an American presence, the greater the risk
we run that there will be violent resistance to it and that we
will be seen as a colonial occupying power.
I think the biggest mistake that the Bush administration
is making is having all of this on the international side be
American in its face and character. In the military aspect of
that I think we should move rapidly in transforming the
overwhelmingly American military presence into a NATO
presence.
I also think we don't have enough troops there on the
ground. General Eric Shinseki, chief of staff of the Army,
said weeks in advance that the postwar military peace im
plementation force in Iraq would probably require 200,000
troops.
If you're going to prevent radical clerics, backed and fi
nanced by Iran from seizing power in various places, or
thugs and warlords declaring themselves as mayor of this
city or that, you have to have adequate force on the ground,
so much that nobody even thinks of trying that sort of busi
ness. That's the lesson of many of the previous peace imple
mentation projects in postwar and post-conflict situations.
TD: It seems as though the Bush administration doesn't
want to keep troops there that long. Do you think they will
rethink that, or do you think there will be significant voic
es saying we should just get a basic government in place
and get out?
LD: It isn't clear to me what their thinking is and how
their thinking may be modified by realities over time.
I think there are very significant divisions within the
Bush administration ... So far as I can tell, Secretary
[of Defense Donald] Rumsfeld has never used the
word democracy as one of the goals of America's post
war mission in Iraq. He uses words like "representa
tive government."
I think what we're hearing from the press is that [Rums
feld] wants to see the United States get in and out relative
ly quickly, while even his own deputy secretary of defense
and some other people in the State Department and in the
Congress think that we should have the explicit goal of de
mocratic development.
So I don't know what their plans are, and I think the
first couple weeks of the postwar situation do not inspire
confidence that they had elaborate plans, but they're
going to have to prepare for, I think, a lengthy interna
tional-support presence in Iraq or risk a potential unrav
eling of everything we hoped this intervention would do.
TD: Would you say that in the face of all the challenges

that it's very likely in the end that Iraq will come out as a
democracy?
LD: I would say the odds of Iraq becoming a democracy, in
the best of circumstances, if we do everything right, are less
than 50-50, given its history, given its ethnic fractiousness,
given all of the obstacles and the lack of any of the facilitat
ing conditions for democratic development.
It's a difficult, and I think, immensely important project
in any circumstance. If we can create a context of peace
and security in which those different forces can organize
and solicit support and we stay long enough to ensure that
and to build an independent judiciary and so on, I'd say
Iraq has a fighting chance to be something like a democ
racy, maybe the first Arab democracy of our time. Maybe
a 50-50 chance.
But if we don't do any of this and our plan is just to with
draw quickly, I think it's virtually certain that Iraq will revert
to some form of authoritarian rule and possibly a fiercely
anti-American one.
TD: Would you say there are any lessons we've learned
from Afghanistan already in rebuilding that would then be
applicable to Iraq?
LD: I think there are obvious lessons. It's not clear to me to
what extent we've learned them.
One lesson that I think we've learned from Afghanistan
that has not yet seeped into American policy is ... having
sufficient force on the ground to beat back, contain, defeat
and disarm warlords, thugs, anti-democratic forces at the
local level who emerge to reassert or establish their author
ity in a non-democratic way.
We really needed to put — the experts on
Afghanistan argued at the time — something like 50,000
international peacekeeping troops on the ground in
Afghanistan. And I don't know what the number is, but I
doubt that it's much more than a quarter of that. This
means that there are large portions of Afghanistan that
are basically lawless today or have succumbed to the
"law" of a warlord.
The second lesson is that you really need to respond,
enormously rapidly to the needs for economic and social re
construction and relief. And we haven't done enough on
that front either.
The way that people feel about the United States and
what it did will be heavily shaped by what they see to be hap
pening now or not happening now, and one can see the
frustration among Iraqis with the pace of relief and recon
struction.
It isn't enough to say we're only two or three weeks into
this. People aren't looking to a several month time frame;
they're looking to the fact that they're hurting now and
need help now.
TD: Overall, would you say Iraq is in better shape now than
it was a few months ago under Saddam Hussein's dictator
ship?
r .tVMOk Mti"
LD: Yes, it has been freed of one of the most brutal dicta
torships in the modern history of the world.
But you have to weigh changes that have moved in mul
tiple directions.
The country is politically tremendously better off The
climate of pervasive fear and repression is in the process of
being lifted. And there is the opportunity now to really get
economic development going again and integrate Iraq into
the world economy.
But we also have to appreciate that there are respects in
which there's greater economic and social disruption now
than there was four months ago. Hospitals, schools and
daily economic life were not very good at the beginning of
the year and are even worse now.
I think that we need to respond very rapidly to those dis
ruptions and begin to restore services, restore daily eco
nomic life and a climate of peace on the ground and then
enable these twin processes of economic and political re
construction to go forward.
