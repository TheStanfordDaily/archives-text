## CAMPUS VIEWPOINT Students reflect on the Lockheed Martin protest 
### SHAHID BUTTAR JESSICA JENKINS GUEST COLUMNISTS 
On April 22, hundreds of activists
protested American militarism by disrupt
ing business at local corporate headquar
ters of Lockheed Martin. As the world's
largest weapons exporter, the company
profits from American military aggres
sion, culminating in over 2,000 confirmed
civilian causalities in Iraq, only one year
after leaving Afghanistan in shambles.
Both Lockheed Martin and Uncle Sam
have hands awash in blood.
Lockheed Martin contributes to viola
tions of international law according to the
Geneva Convention, by providing
weapons which directly targeted civilian
infrastructure in Iraq. The company also
produces weapons that kill indiscriminate
ly. Antipersonnel landmines claim over
15,000 victims every year and are banned
by international agreements, while
weapons systems employing AUP-3(M)
Depleted Uranium munitions have
caused birth defects, respiratory ailments,
cancers and other diseases among Iraqi
civilians as well as U.S. troops.
Defense contractors shamelessly lever
age their commercial clout to wield illegit
imate political influence over the foreign
policy agenda of the United States. The
Bush administration includes 32 major
policymakers with significant ties to the
arms industry, and Lockheed Martin

alone spent more than $9.8 million lobby
ing elected officials in 2000. The compa
ny's $3.4 million contribution to political
campaigns during the last presidential
election cycle helped secure it approxi
mately $40 billion of Pentagon contracts
since George W. Bush took office. Lock
heed Martin short-circuits the democratic
process to line the pockets of its executives
and investors, who have reaped hand
some gains from war in Iraq.
First, we implore Lockheed Martin's
leaders to redirect resources from
weapons manufacturing to developing
civilian technologies. Second, we insist
that the company stop wielding its political
power to impede the compliance of the
United States with international peace
agreements, such as the Anti-Ballistic Mis
sile Treaty and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Finally, we demand an end to the produc
tion of weapons of mass destruction by the
United States, including nuclear and bal
listic missiles, anti-personnel landmines
and depleted uranium munitions.
Rejecting the premises of U.S. mili
tarism, we unite to encourage real U.S. pa
triots to speak out in favor of peace. By
blot king the entrances to Lockheed Mar
tin's factories, we impeded the company's
ability to produce weapons of mass de
struction, while symbolically demonstrat
ing our commitment to achieving a more
just, humane and peaceful world. Stu
dents, workers, veterans and former Lock
heed Martin employees came together to

celebrate life: A brass band played peace
anthems; people danced, sang and
drummed; and protesters who sacrificed
the use of their arms for several hours re
cited poems while locked into a blockade.
By repudiating militancy in our nonvio
lent struggle to challenge the U.S. war ma
chine, we declared peace as both our
means and our end.
While our armed forces consolidate the
United States' military occupation of Iraq,
some question the relevance of our contin
ued objections. This perspective, however,
forgets that Iraq was merely the second
theatre in a series of many, starting with
our brutal devastation of Afghanistan a
year ago and seemingly including loom
ing attacks on Syria and Iran.
Nearly 60 years ago, the United States
helped create the United Nations precise
ly in order to prevent any single nation
from instigating international violence.
Now we contrive rationales to support our
flagrant violation of that principle, thereby
undermining the institution's very legiti
macy.
Meanwhile, an entire generation of fu
ture zealots glares at television screens,
harboring seething resentment as U.S.
bombs dismember Afghani and Iraqi civil
ians. Rather than diminish our vulnerabil
ity to terror, our military presence in the
Middle East simply inspires more. As the
Bush administration sets its sights on new
targets, our protest attains greater rele
vance than ever.

Our opposition is a right — and indeed
a responsibility — inherent to citizenship
in a democratic nation. Yet these rights
suffer with each passing day as our gov
ernment wages a simultaneous war on do
mestic dissent. Citizens questioning the ra
tionale for war find themselves accused of
cowardice or treason, even though the
peace movement includes scores of war
veterans. Meanwhile, thousands of civil
ians "detained" in the ongoing homeland
security sweep since Sept. 11 — including
U.S. citizens — remain deprived of even
the most basic procedural rights ensured
by our Constitution. This is not the United
States that our fathers, brothers and
grandfathers pledged their life to defend.
Our action on April 22 was an un
abashed success: We disrupted business as
usual; exposed Lockheed Martin's role in
facilitating human rights abuses and en
couraging violence; and inspired fellow
peace-loving citizens to stand against our
illegitimate international aggression. But
it was only one action. We must persist in
exposing warmongers and their perver
sion of our nation's democratic principles.
Now, more than ever, is the time to act
— and this morning may be our greatest
opportunity yet. Today, at 9:30 a.m. Pres
ident Bush will speak at United Defense
Technologies in Santa Clara — one of the
nation's biggest defense weapons contrac
tors. Today, students and community
members from a diverse coalition of orga
nizations all over the Bay Area will con

verge upon Santa Clara to say enough to
his administration's ruthless aggression
abroad, domestic spending cuts and in
fringement of civil liberties. It is long past
time for us to rise up and say, "not in our
name will you continue to wage endless
war!"
As students, we represent the class from
which every transformative social move
ment in this country has ever emerged. As
future elites, we enjoy access to — and le
gitimacy to contend within — a policy
arena from which most people are effec
tively excluded. Our unique position ob
ligates us to speak, act and agitate in de
fense of the values we once took for grant
ed.
Our forefathers and mothers joined
this country because it promised the free
dom, opportunity and peace of a democ
ratic society. Most of us who today call our
selves "American" do so because someone
left a prior life behind in order to commit
to our nation's declared principles. We are
witnessing, before our very eyes, the accel
erating erosion of these principles — and
we refuse to siand aside and bear quiet wit
ness.
