### DEVON MAYLIE STAFF WRITER 
In a room neighboring the Dean's Court
yard that was filled with white coats, blue
scrubs and suits, medical students had the
opportunity to discuss their research with
faculty and fellow students at the annual
School of Medicine Research Symposium
yesterday afternoon.
"As an administration, we are most
proud of the research our students per
form," said Dr. Julie Parsonnet, senior asso
ciate dean of medical education. "It is an in
credible testament to students, their
strengths and their ideas."
Through oral and poster presentations,

50 students presented reseach that included
investigating methods of imaging blood ves
sels, studying bacteria associated with ulcers
and stomach cancer in Papua New Guinea,
assessing the impact the Children's Health
Insurance Program has on pediatric ambu
latory care and hospitalization rates and re
searching obesity and its role in the detec
tion of prostate cancer.
Dr. Patricia Cross, organizer and associ
ate dean for medical student research and
scholarship, said the event is special because
it provides an important academic arena
outside the classroom.
"It is a form of independent scholarship
that sharpens critical reasoning
and creates an deeper understand
ing of disease," Cross said.
Ryan Louie, a student in the
M.D.-Ph.D. program with a focus
in ceil biology, agreed.
"The medical student research
symposium is a great way to share
ideas and talk science with all the
people in our school community,"
Louie said. "It serves as a wonder
ful forum to see and explore die di
versity in research topics pursued
by students here at the Medical
School."
Some of the major results dis
cussed were: a verbal-working
memory function for the cerebel
lum, an organ typically thought to
only be involved in motor coordi
nation; a study showing how audi
tory electromyographic biofeed
back can convert electrical activity
of muscles into sounds that a pa
tient can modulate; and a model in
a mouse femur to help the medical
community understand what role
inflammation plays in total joint re
placement failure.

"Research is the future of medi
cine," said Una Lee, a fifth-year
medical student studying urology.
Parsonnet emphasized that the
Medical School's curriculum pro
motes student research. A number
of students take five years, instead
of the traditional four, to allow
extra time for scientific investiga
tion.
The Medical School also offers a
Medical Scholars Grant which al
lows many students to do full-time
research.
"Stanford has provided an ex
cellent environment for medical
students to become heavily in
volved in projects of their interest
while providing the resources nec
essary to ensure that we have the
opportunity to receive a thorough
medical school education," Court
ney said.
Medical student Dustin
Bermudez is an example of Stan
ford's unique research environ
ment. He is taking five years to
complete school in order to follow
his passion for research, currendy
studying the impact of health care
policy decisions.
"If you enjoy what you do, you'll
always find time for it, in spite of a
demanding course load," he said.
