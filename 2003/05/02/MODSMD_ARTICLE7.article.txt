After nine years at Stanford, Nadinne Cruz, di
rector of the Haas Center for Public Service, will be
le&vifig the University this June.
The reasons for Cruz's departure remain unex
plained by University officials. Cruz did not return
The Daily's phone calls.
Provost John Etchemendy announced Cruz's
resignation on Wednesday.
"Under Nadinne's direction, the Haas Center
has become a pre-eminent public service center,
currently ranked No. 1 for service-learning among

colleges and universities by the U.S. News & World
Report and viewed as a model by educators and
governments both in the United States and inter
nationally," he said. j
Julie Lythcott-Haims, assistant dean for fresh
men and transfer students, said that Cruz has built
a strong program for University students.
"In her many years at Haas culminating in the
last three years as director, Nadinne has inspired
countless Stanford students to explore and commit
to lives of public service," she said "She is a vision
ary leader, a dedicated teacher and a gifted mentor
who will be missed."
Cruz first came to Stanford in
1994 as associate director of the
Haas Center. In 1999 she was
named interim director, and she

stepped into the position of direc
tor in 2000.
According to Stanford commu
nity members, her willingness to
work on the behalf of students has
made her an asset to the campus
that many will miss.
"Nadinne has been an incredi
ble influence on me," said Tim Ly,
Class of 2001. "She has just been

an incredible person in shaping
my passion for service and com
munity-oriented work at Stan
ford."
Added Abby Reyes, Class of
1996, said, "I met Nadinne as a
public service scholar in 1995 ....
Eight years later, Nadinne's teach
ings remain a central force in my
professional life."

Cruz, along with her husband
Laurence Ulrich, also served for
seven years as resident fellows in
Okada, Stanford's Asian-Ameri
can undergraduate theme dorm.
The University will soon name
an interim director and conduct a
national search for Cruz's perma
nent replacement, according to
Lythcott-Haims.
