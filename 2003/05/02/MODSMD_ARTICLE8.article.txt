# Council discusses Stanford's future
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faculty, staff and students gathered in Kresge
Auditorium yesterday afternoon for the annual
meeting of the Academic Council. University Pres
ident John Hennessy spoke of changes at Stanford
over the past year and his talk was followed by a
panel discussion concerning recent economic con
cerns for Stanford.
In accordance with last year's goal of strengthen
ing multidisciplinary incentives, Hennessy stated
that the University created a new Bioengineering
Department, the first department at Stanford joint
ly established by two schools.
He also spoke of support for efforts to enhance
the gender diversity of the faculty and the promo
tion of community outreach programs such as Com
munity Day, which attracted more than 8,000 peo
ple to campus last month.
However, Stanford's financial situation was the
predominant focus of the meeting.
According to Hennessy, the "dramatically
changed economic environment" has required the
University to consider three distinct economic is
sues: the source of financial aid for students, the
University's debt capacity and the size of its endow
ment.
Stanford's endowment ranks as the fifth-largest
among its peers overall, but it is not ranked in the
top 10 in terms of resources-per-student.
However, Hennessy affirmed that the financial
challenges would not impede the newly created five
year $1 billion campaign for undergraduate educa
tion, for which over $850 million has already been
raised.
"No institution of our size can match our combi
nation of breadth and excellence," he said. "The
leadership within the schools and departments ex
emplify the pioneering spirit that has served us so
well."
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the School of Law, stat
ed that "resources matter." She said that the Law
School, which operates with only 75 percent of Yale's
expenses, boasts the highest budget per student of

any school other than Yale.
As far as the undergraduate
budget is concerned, Psychology
Prof. Ewart Thomas explained
that it is important to examine
how much students value partic
ular programs and how budget
proposals could change the cur
riculum.
"A budget cut of 10 percent is a
very big cut, and the stakes associ
ated with it are correspondingly
high," Thomas said.
He expressed disapproval of

equal budget reductions in all de
partments.
"Across-the-board cuts are at
tractive because it is easy to think
of them as fair," he continued.
"But [they] discourage discus
sion, for example, of ways differ
ent schools and programs can use
their funds."
Provost John Etchemendy said
the meeting was successful.
"The panel was terrific," he
said. "The main purpose of the
meeting was to communicate
what has happened to the Uni
versity, but it is also important in
a time like this [to discuss] how
we're going to deal with chal
lenges like the budget."
