# Faculty Senate looks into Univ. diversity
## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hampered by a strict one
hour time limit, the Faculty Sen
ate hurriedly addressed the issue
of campus diversity before ad
journing yesterday afternoon,
enabling members to attend an
Academic Council session that
immediately followed.
The Diversity Action Coun
cil, unable to present to the sen
ate a thorough report given the
time constraints, might be al
lowed to return to the senate at
a later date in order to conclude
and address questions or con
cerns. Yesterday, they present
ed their basic findings on facul
ty diversity, including the fac
tors that have prevented the
University from increasing the
presence of tenure-line minori
ty faculty above its current level
of 5.4 percent.
University Provost John
Etchemendy prefaced the report
from the council with a bit of his
tory relevant to Stanford's com
mitment to diversity.
According to Etchemendy,
the University was originally
founded for the children of Cali
fornia. He said it is imperative
that Stanford reflect the multira
cial, multiethnic nature of con
temporary society.
"[This committee was]
charged with assessing how well
we're doing and how to make
further progress," he said, refer
ring to the problem of maintain
ing Stanford's diversity.
The council comprises four
subcommittees â€” die Commit
tee on Staff Diversity, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Di
versity, the Committee on Grad
uate Student Diversity and the
Committee on Faculty Diversity.
Each of these subcommittees has
between 11 and 17 members
and focuses on increasing diver
sity within a specific University
population.

The focus in yesterday's re
port, however, was on issues of
faculty diversity.
"Change will make more dif
ference there than anywhere
else," said Cultural and Social An
diropology Prof. Renato Rosal
do, chair of the council. "Diversi
ty is central to the University."
Psychology Prof. Claude
Steele, chair of the committee on
faculty diversity, presented his
group's findings and goals to the
senate.
He reported that faculty diver
sity has historically ebbed and
flowed and that currently minori
ties make up only 5.4 percent of
all tenure-line University faculty.
His committee's job is to en
sure a level of diversity most con
ducive to a successful academic
environment. To do this, Steele
explained that he must keep the
institution focused on the issue
and recruit from an "under-sup
ply" of minority candidates.
He said that the committee
has successfully opened lines of
communication throughout
the University, beginning with
the president, the provost and
the deans of all Stanford
schools.
According to Steele, problems
currendy feeing the committee
include the size of the minority
pool, the present legal climate
and a weak representation of mi
nority research interests, among
others.
To overcome many of these
barriers, Steele encouraged "de
centralized responsibility for di
versity," claiming that if a local
ized group were to tackle the
issue, it would be less effective
than a large, diverse group. His
goal is to achieve "maximum in
volvement of all the main author
ity lines."
Though there was no time for
discussion in the senate after the
presentation, the topic will most
likely be addressed at a session
later in the year.
