## Powell addresses Syria 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —If he had
any doubts, Syrian President Basilar
Assad now knows just what he must do
to bring his country in line with U.S.
plans for the Middle East, Secretary of
State Colin Powell said yesterday.
Powell, who met with Assad in Dam
ascus on Saturday, said the Bush ad
ministration and Congress are monitor
ing Syria's moves in the aftermath of the
U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam Hus
sein's government in neighboring Iraq.
"There are no illusions in his mind
as to what we are looking for from
Syria," Powell told NBC's "Meet the
Press."
" There was, as we put it in diplomat
ic terms, a candid exchange of views,
but it is not promises that we are inter
ested in, or assurances, but it is action.
We will see what happens in the days,
weeks, months ahead."
Powell said that's what he told Assad.
"What I said to him is that we would
be watching, and we would measure
performance over time to see whether
Syria is prepared now to move in a new
direction in light of these changed cir
cumstances," the secretary said on

ABC's "This Week."
A key question involving Iraq, Pow
ell said, is whether Syria will keep its
eastern border closed, and track clown
and surrender any Iraqi suspects who
might cross it to escape prosecution.
As of now, Syria's oil from Iraq and
other trade going both ways have been
shut off, Powell said.
If Syria follows through on those
steps and cooperates with rebuilding
Iraq, including the formation of a de
mocratic government, Powell said,
" Then that tells us one thing about
Syria's decision to move forward: that
they looking fora better relationship
with United States. If they do not, then
there will be consequences."
Powell said he emphasized in his dis
cussion with Assad that monumental
change in the Middle East has come not
only with Saddam's ouster but also with
a new prime minister, Mahmoud
Abbas, in place to represent the Pales
tinians in the peace process with Israel.
The election of Abbas, also known as
Abu Ma/en, brought the release of a
new formula to work toward Palestin
ian* Israeli peace.
