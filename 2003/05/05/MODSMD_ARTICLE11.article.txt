(AP) — The SARS outbreak is caus
ing a host of problems for academics, as
U.S. schools cancel Asian summer study
programs, researchers shelve coopera
tive projects with Chinese scholars and
Asians enrolled in American colleges
abandon plans to return home after
final exams.
Unless the flu-like illness, blamed for
more than 400 deaths in China and
Hong Kong, is contained soon, it could
effect exchange programs well beyond

summer programs, said John Holden,
president of the National Committee
on United States-China Relations, a
New York-based nonprofit.
"I am not aware of any programs
that are going forward at the moment,
or plan to go forward over the sum
mer," he said.
University of Alabama graduate stu
dent David Cao decided he couldn't
take the chance of flying home to main
land China this summer.

He forfeited his $780 nonrefundable
airline tickets.
"I decided not to go back, the SARS
situation makes it even worse," Cao
said.
At the same time, Chinese students
hoping to study in the United States
may be stuck in China. The Education
al Testing Service, at the request of
China's National Education Examina
tion Authority, last month stopped giv
ing exams there — at least

temporarily — (or English proficiency
and graduate management.
(ilobally, SARS, or Severe Acute Res
piratory syndrome, has killed at least
449 people and sickened more than
(),!M)0. China is keeping schools in Bei
jing closed, and in Taiwan, officials yes
terday warned that violators of quaran
tine orders would be punished.
The United States lias reported 54
probable cases of SARS but no deaths
from the illness.
