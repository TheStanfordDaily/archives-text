# Capsule lands safely on Earth

ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) â€” A Russian capsule
safely returned two astronauts and a cosmonaut
from the international space station yesterday, but
the landing, nearly 300 miles oil target, triggered a
nerve-racking two-hour search in the steppes of cen
tral Asia.
The three men were finally spotted in the vast,
brown, barren stretch of Kazakhstan by a recovery
plane and waved to show they were line. I lelicopters
arrived for them an hour or two later.
"I was just happy we were down, that everything
was sale," astronaut Kenneth Bowersox told The As
sociated Press while Hying back to cosmonaut head
quarters at Star City outside Moscow. "It was the
most beautiful dirt I've ever seen."
It was a dramatic end to a 5 I/2-month space sta
tion mission lor Bowersox, who served as the com
mander, astronaut Donald I'ettit and cosmonaut
Nikolai Budarin.
Because it was the first manned space landing
since the Columbia disaster and the first touchdown
by NASA astronauts in a foreign spacecraft in a for
eign land, tension was running high. It shot up when
nothing was heard from the crew following its last
radio call 16 minutes before touchdown. By coinci
dence, that was the same time communication
ceased with the Columbia astronauts over Texas on
Feb. 1.
What kept NASA officials from becoming too
frightened was the fact that the Soyuz crew had just
reported the main parachute opened normally and
the most brutal part of atmospheric re-entry was
over. Columbia was ripped apart after the scorching
heat of re-entry penetrated its damaged left wing; all
seven astronauts were killed.
Because of that accident and the indefinite
grounding of NASA's shuttle lleet, the space sta
tion residents had no choice but to return on the
Soyuz that had been docked as a lifeboat for six
months. They rocketed into orbit last November
aboard Endeavour and were supposed to return
on Atlantis in March.
