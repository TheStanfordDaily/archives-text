Only a few years ago it seemed that
California Gov. Gray Davis would
have the honor of assuming the
Chief Executive during an
epochal time in Golden State history, where
this time the gold would be silicon. The state
had unprecedented amounts of incoming
tax revenues and Davis had the cachet of
presiding over an economy that seemed to
grow money like lettuce, olives and Merlot
grapes.
Vet things change quickly, and a stagger
ing budget deficit, a legacy of poor negotia
tions with energy companies and the crash
of the once Ã¼biquitous start-ups have quick
ly turned Davis' term into a dark time in Cal
ifornia's history.
A subset of California Republicans are
seeking to put an end to Davis' governorship
by setting up an Internet petition to force a
recall vote. With approval ratings in the 20

percent range, Davis could be subject to re
call if 1.2 million petition signatures are col
lected before Sept. 2. To date, about 100,000
California voters have signed the petition. As
it is every citizen's right to redress the office
of an elected representative, particularly if
there are concerns about that person's com
petence, it is also every citizen's duty to be
come informed concerning grave civic mat
ters such as the charge of this petition.
We believe that those who wish to sign the
petition should proceed cautiously, taking
pains to learn who is collecting signatures,
whether their methods of obtaining signa
tures are legal and ethical, what their stated
and unstated purposes are and the conse
quences of a successful petition. Stanford
voters considering signing this petition must
regard their signature equivalent to a vote in
a general election, and we urge careful con
sideration of this matter.
