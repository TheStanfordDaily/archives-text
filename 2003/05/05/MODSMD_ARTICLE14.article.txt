# Editorial board explained
## 
### 
Words are often printed in this
space that cause a flurry of con
troversy, unite voices in agree
ment or promote meaningful
discussions around the Stanford campus.
On April 22, The New York Times edito
rial page editor Gail Collins addressed the
Stanford community and included a discus
sion about their editorial board. Collins'
visit provides due occasion for the editorial
board of The Stanford Daily to discuss how
it operates.
Newspaper editorial boards seek to focus
attention, sharpen public opinion and elab
orate the philosophy of its unique collection
of editors and writers. There are seven seats
on The Stanford Daily editorial board and
four of them are occupied by Daily staff: the
editor in chief, the managing editor for spe
cial sections and the two opinions editors.
The other three positions are held by Stan
ford students and include undergraduate
and graduate students, typically involved in
multiple campus activities and having
served in a leadership role on campus. Com
munity members apply to the incoming edi
tor in chief at the beginning of each new vol
ume, which changes twice a year.
Selecting eminent and worthy topics to
occupy this space is a challenging task. Top
ics are often culled from news stories ap
pearing in The Daily issues from the week,
but frequently are suggested according to a
board member's personal knowledge of an
issue. Most topics that eventually reach the
editorial pages relate to issues which impact
the Stanford community, and the edit board
takes special care to elucidate why Stanford
students should give attention to the topic

which appears in the editorial pages.
During edit board meetings, each of the
suggestions is reviewed for its relevance,
salience and timeliness. The four to seven
topics that best meet these criteria are cho
sen and The Daily's stance on the issues is
debated, concluding with consensus about
what aspects of the issue most deserve atten
tion, what angle the piece will take and
which member will write the piece.
The editorial board strives to maintain a
judicious and fair stance on each topic. In
the event that an editorial board member
has a conflict of interest relating to a particu
lar issue, that member is excused from writ
ing on that topic. Occasionally, the editorial
board fails to reach consensus, in which case
the dissenting member may choose to sub
mit a guest column, which when published
will include that member's name in an au
thor's byline. Editorial pieces, however, are
never signed, since they reflect the consen
sus of the board and not board members' in
dividual opinions.
The opinions department, including the ed
itorial board, operates separately from the news
department. The opinions represented by the
editorial board do not influence the news cov
erage and are limited to the opinions pages.
The board encourages discussion within
and outside of the Stanford community con
cerning the topics covered in this space and
welcomes letters that promote interesting
and informative dialogue. There is a finite
amount of information that the editorial
board can glean about any given topic and
alternate viewpoints are always appreciated,
either through letters to the editor or guest
columns.

Thi v editorial represents the mews of the members of The Daily's editorial hoard. The hoard consists of The Daily's editor in chief managing edi
torfor special sections, two opinions editors and three community members at-lnrge. Signed columns arid contributions are the view of the writer
and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.
