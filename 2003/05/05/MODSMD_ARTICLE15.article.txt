Free speech should be
respected, not abused
1 am a law school student at UC-Berkeley's
Boalt Hall School of Law and was appalled that
The Daily would permit the Turkish denial of the
Armenian (ienocide to be printed in your presti
gious and well-respected paper in the recent
guest column, "Armenian Genocide an impor
tant, complicated historical event" (April 30).
As a student of the law and one who has
pored over the U.S. Constitution, I would be
the first to support the right to freedom of
speech. Freedoms may be abused however,
and it must be recognized that not all things

that are legally permissible are necessarily
morally or ethically acceptable. Would any
one have allowed the publishing of a denial
of the Holocaust? Or the denial of the slavery
of African-Americans? I am sure people
would agree that doing so would have com
promised the integrity and journalistic stan
dards of the newspaper. The denial of the Ar
menian Genocide should have similarly been
unthinkable.
