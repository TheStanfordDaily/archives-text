# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Bring it on! 
### 
Who wants to go to a school with a loser
football team? More importantly, who
wants to give money to an alma mater
with a loser football team? The answers
are 6,500 of the world's best and brightest, and not
enough people to buy us a new student union.
Clearly, it is in the best interest of the University
to ascertain the source of this disparity between the
desired and actual state of affairs on the gridiron.
We can't blame it on inadequate funding: When
was the last time you saw a football player begging
for special fees? It's not like Stanford can't produce
good players (John Elway, anyone?). And since it is
not like they are all too busy having sex, smoking
pot and cheating on exams to keep their heads
(both of them) in the game, we must go deeper to
find the answer.
People like to blame our cheap, no-talent coach,
Buddy "Lost our first Big Game in eight years"
Teevens, but that answer is just too simple. The real
culprit is the unkempt, unshorn, seemingly disor
ganized Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band. This pathetic hodgepodge of tackily clad
Phi Psis, Chaparral staffers and 40-year-old alumni
have colluded so that at every football game there is
someone who plays worse than they do.
How is it that they have accomplished this con
spiracy? By inhibiting any hope of a legitimate
cheering section through their monopoly on game
time entertainment.
We need cheerleaders.
But don't we have the Dollies? Don't we have five
tiny ladies in unrevealing dresses with tired dance
moves performing to cacophonous alternative

songs? Somehow, they don't really manage to rile
up the crowd. In fact none of the band-sponsored
entertainment seems to do more than elicit a chuck
le here and there among the fans (if there are any).
Think about it: The Tree is the band's mascot, the
Dollies are the band's dancers and the Yell Leaders
are the band's embarrassment.
We don't really need to have inside-out Hawai
ian shirt-wearing, microphone-toting, Hag bear
ers who attempt to coerce the stands into partici
pating in a round of "Penetrate, penetrate! Score,
score!"

What we need
is a squad of
miniskirt-wear
ing, lip gloss-tot
ing, pom-pom
bearers; we can
hear the crowd
roaring now.
Once we have
aroused the fans,

the testosterone will be contagious. The team would
block harder, run faster and throw — to our own
team.
The Band is set in its ways, but that has never
stopped a Stanford student from trying to make a
difference.
The first route is to protest. We can see it now: ban
ners in White Plaza, lunch lime cookie giveaways,
protesters lying in the streets and marchers encircling
Hoover Tower, chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, LSJ U M IV s
got to go." If it got George W. Bush to change his
ways, it will certainly work on the Band.
In the unlikely event that this plan fails, option two
is always available: complain to the ASSU. Maybe we
should apply for an art grant to mimic the style of the
murals in Casa Zapata to create a painting that de
picts the destruction of this evil empire.
Unfortunately, $1,000 would not even cover the
cost of the stools we sit on while cleaning our paint
brushes. Nonetheless, the sure-fire bet to getting
what you want at Stanford is to throw money at the
problem, as this pitiful attempt on the part of the
ASSU to bribe the artistic community into no longer
complaining about how we are turning into Stan
ford Tech shows.

So we need to bribe the Band to reform
their counterproductive ways. They can wear
their clashing outfits, parade their non-de
ciduous mascot, engage in mischievous
conduct, be banned from stadiums, states
and airlines and even disgrace the Depart
ment of Athletics. However, we demand
that the Band learn to play at least three

songs well: the national anthem, "Hail
Stanford Hail" and "All Right Now."
In exchange for their kickbacks they
must also concede both time and
space to cheerleaders.

We need a full-time cheerleading
squad that will perform during every
minute of every important athletic
event (i.e. all basketball and football
games). Regardless of whether a cur
rent group or a new group wishes to

step up to this task, every re
source we have available should
be funneled to this cause for
recruitment, training and

preparation.

Where will we get
all this money? Tough
choices will have

to be made. We
are willing
to sacrifice

Sears Cups
for Big
Games. We
need to

focus our at
tention on football, basketball and cheerleading. If
other sports have to go, so be it. It's not like many peo
ple go to those games anyway, so let's just cut the fat
out of the budget.
After all, you have to spend money to make
money, and isn't that what the Athletics Depart
ment is here for anyway? Maybe with all the new
alumni money coming in, we'll be able to pay fora
real student union — $10,000 couches and all.

Embarrassed our mascot is a poor rip-off of Harvard's? We
are too: eym@stanford.edu and aketidall@stanford.edu.

Embarrassed our mascot is a poor rip-off of Harvard's? We

Who wants to go to a school with a loser
football team? More importantly, who
wants to give money to an alma mater
with a loser football team? The answers
are 6,500 of the world's best and brightest, and not
enough people to buy us a new student union.
Clearly, it is in the best interest of the University
to ascertain the source of this disparity between the
desired and actual state of affairs on the gridiron.
We can't blame it on inadequate funding: When
was the last time you saw a football player begging
for special fees? It's not like Stanford can't produce
good players (John Elway, anyone?). And since it is
not like they are all too busy having sex, smoking
pot and cheating on exams to keep their heads
(both of them) in the game, we must go deeper to
find the answer.
People like to blame our cheap, no-talent coach,
Buddy "Lost our first Big Game in eight years"
Teevens, but that answer is just too simple. The real
culprit is the unkempt, unshorn, seemingly disor
ganized Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band. This pathetic hodgepodge of tackily clad
Phi Psis, Chaparral staffers and 40-year-old alumni
have colluded so that at every football game there is
someone who plays worse than they do.
How is it that they have accomplished this con
spiracy? By inhibiting any hope of a legitimate
cheering section through their monopoly on game
time entertainment.
We need cheerleaders.
But don't we have the Dollies? Don't we have five
tiny ladies in unrevealing dresses with tired dance
moves performing to cacophonous alternative

songs? Somehow, they don't really manage to rile
up the crowd. In fact none of the band-sponsored
entertainment seems to do more than elicit a chuck
le here and there among the fans (if there are any).
Think about it: The Tree is the band's mascot, the
Dollies are the band's dancers and the Yell Leaders
are the band's embarrassment.
We don't really need to have inside-out Hawai
ian shirt-wearing, microphone-toting, Hag bear
ers who attempt to coerce the stands into partici
pating in a round of "Penetrate, penetrate! Score,
score!"

What we need
is a squad of
miniskirt-wear
ing, lip gloss-tot
ing, pom-pom
bearers; we can
hear the crowd
roaring now.
Once we have
aroused the fans,

the testosterone will be contagious. The team would
block harder, run faster and throw — to our own
team.
The Band is set in its ways, but that has never
stopped a Stanford student from trying to make a
difference.
The first route is to protest. We can see it now: ban
ners in White Plaza, lunch lime cookie giveaways,
protesters lying in the streets and marchers encircling
Hoover Tower, chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, LSJ U M IV s
got to go." If it got George W. Bush to change his
ways, it will certainly work on the Band.
In the unlikely event that this plan fails, option two
is always available: complain to the ASSU. Maybe we
should apply for an art grant to mimic the style of the
murals in Casa Zapata to create a painting that de
picts the destruction of this evil empire.
Unfortunately, $1,000 would not even cover the
cost of the stools we sit on while cleaning our paint
brushes. Nonetheless, the sure-fire bet to getting
what you want at Stanford is to throw money at the
problem, as this pitiful attempt on the part of the
ASSU to bribe the artistic community into no longer
complaining about how we are turning into Stan
ford Tech shows.

So we need to bribe the Band to reform
their counterproductive ways. They can wear
their clashing outfits, parade their non-de
ciduous mascot, engage in mischievous
conduct, be banned from stadiums, states
and airlines and even disgrace the Depart
ment of Athletics. However, we demand
that the Band learn to play at least three

songs well: the national anthem, "Hail
Stanford Hail" and "All Right Now."
In exchange for their kickbacks they
must also concede both time and
space to cheerleaders.

We need a full-time cheerleading
squad that will perform during every
minute of every important athletic
event (i.e. all basketball and football
games). Regardless of whether a cur
rent group or a new group wishes to

step up to this task, every re
source we have available should
be funneled to this cause for
recruitment, training and

preparation.

Where will we get
all this money? Tough
choices will have

to be made. We
are willing
to sacrifice

Sears Cups
for Big
Games. We
need to

focus our at
tention on football, basketball and cheerleading. If
other sports have to go, so be it. It's not like many peo
ple go to those games anyway, so let's just cut the fat
out of the budget.
After all, you have to spend money to make
money, and isn't that what the Athletics Depart
ment is here for anyway? Maybe with all the new
alumni money coming in, we'll be able to pay fora
