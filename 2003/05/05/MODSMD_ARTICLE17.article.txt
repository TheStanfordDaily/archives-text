## Lax crowned conference champions 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford women's lacrosse team
caused double trouble this weekend as it picked
up its second consecutive Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League Championship after victories
over UC-Davis and California.

Sunday: No. 14 Stanford 15, California 14

It was difficult to believe the difference in
matchups as Stanford routed the Aggies 19-3
but just scraped by the Bears 15-14 in the final
on Sunday — a duel that Cardinal coach
Michele Uhlfelder called a "dog fight."
Stanford came out strong in Saturday's
semifinal, controlling the board for the first 10
minutes of play with three goals before Davis
responded with a score off a penalty shot.
But one minute later, leading scorer
sophomore Kelsey Twist netted another on
an impressive turnaround shot and sopho
more Nina Pantano followed suit, with a steal
and a push down the field for another goal
that visibly lifted the team and gave Stanford
the lead at 5-1.
The Cardinal gave the Aggies little room to
respond offensively, as Stanford took the lead
by eight until Davis netted its third goal with
2:15 remaining in the half.
That goal would be the Aggies' last of the
game.
Pantano said that while her team's perfor
mance was solid in the first half, the run Stan
ford executed in the second — led by sopho
more Claire Calzonetti's two goals in the open
ing minutes after halftime — was more impres
sive.
"1 think today we were like, 'No, we're going
to score 12 more goals'," Pantano said.
The Cardinal actually scored eight goals

after the break, three of which belonged to Pan
tano. Burker and junior Tiffany Chao added
two more fora win that Uhlfelder proclaimed
"a synthesis of a season's worth of concepts."
Earlier that day, California defeated Denver
to secure a berth in the finals against Stanford
on Sunday.
" The focus is on playing as well as we can
play," Twist said Saturday regarding the up
coming game against the Bears. But against a
scrappy California team, this was easier said
than done.
Junior Abbi Hills and Pantano's early goals
were matched by two goals from the Bears in
the opening minutes of play, establishing the
first of a series of ties and traded possessions
that would continue throughout the afternoon.
Senior Kim Cahill and Claire Calzonetti
both netted goals to boost Stanford 4-3, but the
Bears bounced back to tie things up 4-4. Claire
Calzonetti then notched her second pair of
back-to-back goals in the weekend to lift Stan

ford by one, but three unanswered California
goals gave the Bears their biggest lead at 7-5.
Uhlfelder was less than pleased by her
team's play early on in the game.
"We came out very flat and not very focused
on the synthesis," said Uhlfelder, comparing
Sunday's performance with Saturday's. "I
think they [Stanford] were probably thinking
about the end of the game before they were
thinking about the beginning of the game."
A goal by Pantano was answered by Califor
nia just before the half, sending teams into the
locker room with the Bears leading, 8-(i.
Twist, held scoreless in the first half, empha
sized a new mentality coming in after the break.
"At the halftime we tried to come out fresh,"
she said.
Twist certainly did, posting the first two Car
dinal goals in the second half. Calzonetti scored
her third goal of the day to tie the game at nine

Hut the Bears refused to give
up, netting a goal with only 2:43
remaining and cutting the Cardi

surprise to Uhlfelder.

without a serious light," she said.

gressive play in the box resulted in
a whistle, and fora moment it
looked as if the Bears would have a
final chance to lie the game oil a
penalty. But the Stanford foul was
olfset by a California offsides, and

goal.

The No. 14 Stanford women's lacrosse team
caused double trouble this weekend as it picked
up its second consecutive Mountain Pacific
Lacrosse League Championship after victories
over UC-Davis and California.

Sunday: No. 14 Stanford 15, California 14

It was difficult to believe the difference in
matchups as Stanford routed the Aggies 19-3
but just scraped by the Bears 15-14 in the final
on Sunday — a duel that Cardinal coach
Michele Uhlfelder called a "dog fight."
Stanford came out strong in Saturday's
semifinal, controlling the board for the first 10
minutes of play with three goals before Davis
responded with a score off a penalty shot.
But one minute later, leading scorer
sophomore Kelsey Twist netted another on
an impressive turnaround shot and sopho
more Nina Pantano followed suit, with a steal
and a push down the field for another goal
that visibly lifted the team and gave Stanford
the lead at 5-1.
The Cardinal gave the Aggies little room to
respond offensively, as Stanford took the lead
by eight until Davis netted its third goal with
2:15 remaining in the half.
That goal would be the Aggies' last of the
game.
Pantano said that while her team's perfor
mance was solid in the first half, the run Stan
ford executed in the second — led by sopho
more Claire Calzonetti's two goals in the open
ing minutes after halftime — was more impres
sive.
"1 think today we were like, 'No, we're going
to score 12 more goals'," Pantano said.
The Cardinal actually scored eight goals

after the break, three of which belonged to Pan
tano. Burker and junior Tiffany Chao added
two more fora win that Uhlfelder proclaimed
"a synthesis of a season's worth of concepts."
Earlier that day, California defeated Denver
to secure a berth in the finals against Stanford
on Sunday.
" The focus is on playing as well as we can
play," Twist said Saturday regarding the up
coming game against the Bears. But against a
scrappy California team, this was easier said
than done.
Junior Abbi Hills and Pantano's early goals
were matched by two goals from the Bears in
the opening minutes of play, establishing the
first of a series of ties and traded possessions
that would continue throughout the afternoon.
Senior Kim Cahill and Claire Calzonetti
both netted goals to boost Stanford 4-3, but the
Bears bounced back to tie things up 4-4. Claire
Calzonetti then notched her second pair of
back-to-back goals in the weekend to lift Stan

ford by one, but three unanswered California
goals gave the Bears their biggest lead at 7-5.
Uhlfelder was less than pleased by her
team's play early on in the game.
"We came out very flat and not very focused
on the synthesis," said Uhlfelder, comparing
Sunday's performance with Saturday's. "I
think they [Stanford] were probably thinking
about the end of the game before they were
thinking about the beginning of the game."
A goal by Pantano was answered by Califor
nia just before the half, sending teams into the
locker room with the Bears leading, 8-(i.
Twist, held scoreless in the first half, empha
sized a new mentality coming in after the break.
"At the halftime we tried to come out fresh,"
she said.
Twist certainly did, posting the first two Car
dinal goals in the second half. Calzonetti scored
her third goal of the day to tie the game at nine
