### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Stanford sent the pesky Bears back to their lair in
defeat once again as the No. 6 men's and No. 8
women's track and field teams handily dispatched
their cross-bay rivals.
The Cardinal has now swept California three years
in a row. The women's score of 111-51 marks the
third-straight season scoring over 100 points in the
Big Meet, while the men's current winning streak is
the longest since 1966.
The men's 93-70 victory was clinched with a dra
matic sweep of the 5,000, which saw redshirt fresh
man Neil Davis lead the Cardinal into the top-eight
places. The men also swept the 800, 1,500 and long
jump.
