# Card bats launch 1,000 hits to crush Trojans

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES— Last Tuesday,
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said he was "embarrassed"
after his team's pitiful 2-0 loss at
home to Santa Clara.
After the No. 9 Cardinal's week
end sweep of Southern California in
Los Angeles, the embarrassment can
be safely reserved for the Trojans.
Marquess' squad outscored USC
38-16 over the three games, high
lighted by a 22-10 trouncing on Sat
urday and a pair of 8-3 wins in yes
terday's doubleheader that extend
ed its road win streak to 10 games.
Led offensively by senior Ryan
Garko, Stanford (31-14, 13-5 Pacific
10 Conference) plowed through the
Trojans (25-22, 9-9) at Dedeaux
Field to grab sole possession of first
place in-conference.
"I had this series circled on my
calendar," said Garko, who went a

remarkable 10-for-13 in the series
with three home runs and 12 RBI.
"I'm glad I could play so well in my
last regular season college series
near my home."
Garko led the Stanford offensive
barrage in all three games, over
which the Cardinal amassed 47 hits,
perhaps in response to the team's
poor showing against the Broncos at
Sunken Diamond last week.
"Obviously Tuesday was disap
pointing for us as a team because we
didn't play up to the capabilities of
this team," Garko said. "But you just
have to put that behind you."
And behind them it went.

night's game and forced a Sunday
double dip, Stanford went right to
work on Saturday, starting the se

victory.

Home the game's first run in the
second, then freshman John May
berry Jr. launched a two-run
homer — his first since March 2,
also against USC.
After a Garko homer in the fifth
and Trojan rallies in each of the
second through fifth innings, Stan
ford and USC sat deadkxked at six
runs apiece. Then the Cardinal
party got started.
Stanford batted around in both
the seventh and eighth and came
one batter short of achieving the
(jt*at again in the ninth, scoring 16
(|uns over its final nine outs.
The outburst made history at
Dedeaux Field, as Stanford scored
the most runs ever allowed by the
Trojans at their home park — the
previous record was 18, set by Ari
zona in 1982.

five hits and six RBI on Saturday
batting in the eight-spot after
struggling through the first half of
the Fat-10 season.
"The past month or so I really
haven't been swinging the bat as
bad as my numbers show, but 1 was
much more fortunate today to get
a couple lucky breaks, and I hit the
ball hard also," Mayberry said.
The Cardinal emerged with the
win despite junior John Hudgins'
shortest outing of the season. He
allowed six runs (five earned) and
nine hits over just five innings,
striking out two and walking one.
The doubleheader sweep yes
terday saw more hitting and two
solid pitching performances by
freshmen, perhaps solidifying the
starting rotation for the remainder
of the season.
In the first game, Mark Ro
manczuk earned his conference
best ninth win of the season in a
complete game, three-hit perfor
mance.
Romanczuk overcame six walks
and two shaky innings to start the
game to go the distance for the sec
ond time this season, dominating
the Trojans in one of the Cardi
nal's best pitching outings of the
season.

Romanczuk was bolstered by a
solid offensive effort led by junior
Sam Fuld's fourth four-hit game of
the season and the 13th of his ca
reer. Fuld also came around to score
four runs lor Stanford, a season
high lor the C Cardinal center fielder.
Six more Stanford players
added two hits each en route to the
8-3 victory as well.
The nightcap proved that simi
lar ingredients — hot Stanford
bats and an outstanding freshman
arm on the mound — lead to sim
ilar results, in this case another 8-3
win over Mike Gillespie's Trojans.
Matt Manship made his first col
legiate start and passed the test
with Hying colors, scattering eight
hits and three runs while lasting 7
2/3 innings for the Cardinal.
Garko belted his first career
grand slam after Stanford opened
the game with three consecutive
singles, giving his freshman bat
tery mate a 4-0 lead before he even
took the mound.
Manship has been arguably the
Cardinal's best pitcher over the last
month of the season, earning the
start last night and potentially so
lidifying a Stanford rotation that
has been inconsistent throughout
2003.
