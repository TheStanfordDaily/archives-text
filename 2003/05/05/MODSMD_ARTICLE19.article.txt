# Card bats launch 1,000 hits to crush Trojans

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES— Last Tuesday,
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said he was "embarrassed"
after his team's pitiful 2-0 loss at
home to Santa Clara.
After the No. 9 Cardinal's week
end sweep of Southern California in
Los Angeles, the embarrassment can
be safely reserved for the Trojans.
Marquess' squad outscored USC
38-16 over the three games, high
lighted by a 22-10 trouncing on Sat
urday and a pair of 8-3 wins in yes
terday's doubleheader that extend
ed its road win streak to 10 games.
Led offensively by senior Ryan
Garko, Stanford (31-14, 13-5 Pacific
10 Conference) plowed through the
Trojans (25-22, 9-9) at Dedeaux
Field to grab sole possession of first
place in-conference.
"I had this series circled on my
calendar," said Garko, who went a

remarkable 10-for-13 in the series
with three home runs and 12 RBI.
"I'm glad I could play so well in my
last regular season college series
near my home."
Garko led the Stanford offensive
barrage in all three games, over
which the Cardinal amassed 47 hits,
perhaps in response to the team's
poor showing against the Broncos at
Sunken Diamond last week.
"Obviously Tuesday was disap
pointing for us as a team because we
didn't play up to the capabilities of
this team," Garko said. "But you just
have to put that behind you."
And behind them it went.
