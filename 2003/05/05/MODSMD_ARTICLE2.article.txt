# Students protest Bush's war spending
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an action organized in part by a
group of Stanford students, more than
1,000 people from around the Bay Area
demonstrated against President George
W. Bush in Santa Clara on Friday morn
ing. While Bush addressed a private au
dience at United Defense Industries,
the protesters crowded the sidewalks on

nearby Coleman Street to voice their
opposition to the president's emphasis
on military spending over health care
and education.
"The war is not over; the second
phase of war profiteering has begun,"
said senior Valarie Kaur Brar, explain
ing her reason for participating in the
protest. "Even President Bush said in
his speech that the 'war on terror' con
tinues, a name that masks his wars of

conquest and profit."
Brar is one of several Stanford stu
dents affiliated with the South Bay Mo
bilization to Stop the War, a group that
played a key role in organizing a sit-in at
Lockheed Martin's headquarters in
Sunnyvale on April 22.
"After the success of the Lockheed
Martin action, the larger Bay Area orga-

nizations looked to the South Bay
organizations — especially Stan
ford students — to plan the
protest in response to Bush's
speech," Brar said.
Though the protesters' mes
sage centered on the negative ef
fects of Bush's policies, the mood
throughout the morning was pos
itive — almost celebratory. A
four-piece musical ensemble
called the "Brass Liberation Or
chestra" set the tone, jamming to
the rhythm of chants such as
"We've got money for war but
can't feed the poor" and "This is
what democracy looks like."
When Bush's motorcade
turned the corner onto Coleman,
a cheer went up from the rela
tively small detachment of pro-
Bush counter-demonstrators on
hand. But most of the anti-Bush
protesters were too busy chanti
ng and dancing under the cover
of a 50-foot-long inflatable mis
sile to notice the president as he
rode by.
Because a police barricade
closed the street to public traffic
and protesters were kept well
away from the path of the presi
dent, it seemed unlikely that the
protesters' message would reach a
wide audience, or even Bush him
self. But third-year Stanford law
student Shahid Buttar said he
thought that the protest was valu
able in what he called "movement
building" — establishing the mo
mentum and connections neces
sary to orchestrate future actions.
"I think it played a vital rhetor
ical role, as well," Buttar said.
"Now that the conflict is over,
being able to identify particular
individuals and institutions that
are accountable requires us to a)
educate the mainstream about
how occupation is war and then b)
seek the issues beyond the war it
self that structurally cause it — for
instance, links between the de

fense industry and the govern
ment.
"On Friday, we were narrow
ing the message to show how the
war and the costs it's imposed
upon us abroad have undermined
the domestic agenda of shoring
up the economy."
Over the course of the morn
ing, two protesters were
arrested — one for lying down in
the street and refusing to move,
the other for striking a mounted
officer's horse — though the only
serious conflict was a war of
words. On several occasions, ac
tivists from opposite sides jeered
each other's views, but the ex
changes were more often good
natured than hostile.
"I thought it was quintessential
democracy, democracy at its best,"
Brar said. "I personally went up
and thanked the pro-Bush people
for being out there, because it was
great to see people take to the
streets to express their views, es
pecially when so much of our de
mocratic process is limited right
now."
At least one member of the
Stanford community turned out
to support the president. An in
structor in the humanities who
asked not to be identified said he
attended the event in order to
"voice my support for President
Bush — he's doing a great job."
For anti-war organizers, the
event was a qualified success. The
protest proceeded peacefully,
drew a sizable crowd and gave
them a chance to connect with
other activists from around the re
gion. But whereas the Lockheed
Martin action last week received
in-depth coverage in many media
outlets, most accounts of Friday's
events downplayed the anti-Bush
presence.
"I was appalled and disheart
ened [by coverage in local news
papers and on television]," Brar
said. "How they covered our
protest was a direct way for me to
witness media bias ... It made me
realize how much work we have
ahead of us."
