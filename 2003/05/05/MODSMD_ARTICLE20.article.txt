Saturday: Stanford 0, Arizona 6

The senior ceremony reflect
ed on the accomplishments of
the foursome following their last
career game here on the Farm.
Unfortunately, the day's con
test was not as successful as these
four seniors' careers.
In the Cardinal's last homes
tand of 2003, it fell 6-0 to top
ranked Arizona over seven in
nings. The contest began like a
game should between two of the
nation's best, with a perfect
game on both sides going into
the top of the fourth.
But, the dominance was soon
lost for both squads as the Cardi
nal allowed a walk and an error
before getting out of the inning
with no runs. Stanford an
swered back with the first hit of
the game as freshman shortstop
Lauren Lappin singled to left to
ruin Wildcat pitcher Alicia Hol
lowell's no-hitter.
Lappin's hit would end up
being the only one of the day for

Stanford, while the Wildcats ex
ploded in the fifth.
The Arizona rally began with
a pair of walks and a bunt to load
the bases. The Wildcats came up
clutch with a hard-hit ball to
third that proved enough to
score the first run of the game.
Arizona kept the rally going with
an RBI single and a run scored
off a wild pitch.
With the score at 3-0, Wildcat
catcher and All-American
Mackenzie Vandergeest
stepped up to the plate and
ripped her 12th home run of the
year over the left field wall to put
the score at 6-0.
Head coach John Rittman
made a pitching change follow
ing the blast and Nyberg took
over in the circle quickly retiring
the Wildcats in order to end the
inning.
The Arizona rally in the fifth
was the only one of the game as
neither team scored following
the offensive explosion.
The game finished with the
same result for Stanford as the
two earlier weekend matchups,
but the path to Friday and Sat
urday's losses were much differ
ent.
The first two face-offs turned
into two more one-run heart
breakers the Cardinal can add to
its list.
Having upset the Wildcats al
ready once this season, Stanford
took the field on Saturday — the
first of its two matchups against
No. 1 Arizona — confident and
proved that it was more than ca
pable of competing.
Arizona first got on the board
in the third inning, when short
stop Lovie Jung singled and stole
second with two outs to put herself
in scoring position. First baseman
Wendy Allen provided the RBI
single that scored Jung and put
the Wildcats ahead 1-0.
But Stanford fought back im
mediately in the fourth inning, be
ginning with an infield single by
junior Katherine Hoffman.
Sophomore Meghan Sickler fol
lowed with a sacrifice to move
Hoffman over and Lappin
reached base by an error. Brang
ham followed Lappin with a single
to load the bases before junior
catcher Jessica Allister sent a shot
to left field scoring Hoffman and
tying the game.
With game tied, freshman
hurler Laura Severson took over
for Nyberg on the rubber and
kept the Wildcats from scoring
until the sixth when they pushed
the final run of the game across
the plate for the victory.
Friday night's game featured a
different opponent in the Sun
Devils of Arizona State, but fin
ished much the same way as Sat
urday's one-run game.
This time it was an unearned
run in the fourth that decided the
game. Sorensen took the loss for
the Cardinal despite not allowing
an earned run in seven innings.
