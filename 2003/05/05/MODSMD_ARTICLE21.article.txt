# Tide searches for new coach
## 
### 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — The post-Bear
Bryant history at Alabama includes three losing sea
sons, two major scandals and only one national title.
The firing of Mike Price on Saturday for his off
field conduct left the school searching for its sev
enth coach since Bryant retired in 1982.
Gene Stallings, who led Alabama to the 1992
title, said the program has one crucial need as it be
gins looking for Price's replacement.
"It needs some stability," Stallings said Sunday.
Less than five months after he was hired away
from Washington State, the 57-year-old Price was
dismissed after reports surfaced that he spent hun
dreds of dollars at a Florida topless bar, and a
woman charged $ 1,000 in room service items to his
hotel bill.
Bryant won five AP national championships at
Alabama, and the fact that Stallings is the only coach
since then to bring a title to Tuscaloosa is a big rea
son why many fans would like to see him return.
Stallings' presence in Birmingham over the
weekend only fueled the rumors. But he was there
to raise money for juvenile diabetes, and by Sunday
he was back home in Texas, insisting that such spec
ulation is "very premature."
"I just happened to be in the wrong place at the
right time, and people thought I was there for that
particular reason, and that's not right at all," he
said.
University President Robert Witt on Saturday
denied that Stallings was a candidate. Some possi
ble candidates include former Tide players and
NFL assistants Sylvester Croom and Mike Simla,
former defensive coordinator Carl Torbush and
former Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin.
Also, two of Price's assistants — Joe Kines and
Sparky Woods — have head coaching experience.
Ray Perkins, who followed Bryant and was coach
from 1983-86, said the coaching carousel is hurting
the program.
"We've now had one, two, three, four, five, six
head coaches since Coach Bryant," Perkins told
The Birmingham News. "Six coaches! And none of
those really gave the program long-term stability.
And I include myself."
Because of NCAA probation, Alabama can't play
in a bowl game next season, and scholarship reduc
tions could affect the program for years to come.
The punishment resulted from rules violations
under Mike Dußose, who was forced out in 2000
during a '1-8 season, two years after surviving a sex
ual harassment complaint filed by his former secre
tary.
Stallings said the Crimson connection will be im
portant in building stability.
"Personally, I think it's going to
require somebody who has a pas
sion and desire to coach at the Uni
versity of Alabama," said Stallings,
who retired alter the 1996 season.
He added that he thinks athletic

director Mai Moore "will be able to
find that person."
Moore, himself a former player
and coach under Bryant, has hired
two football coaches since he was
hired in November 1999, and both
were outsiders. Before Price there
was Dennis Franchione, who came
over from TCU but left after his
second season for Texas A&M.
Witt said he hoped Alabama's

rich tradition would convince the
current Tide players to stay with the
program and play for the new coach.
"You worry about the players,"
Stallings said. "The game's for the
players, it's not for the coaches.
Some of the present players have
been under several coaches in the
past three or four years, and they
need to get somebody who's going
to be there fora while."
