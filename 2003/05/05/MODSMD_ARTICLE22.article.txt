SARS outbreak
threatens China's abil
ity to host in 2008
BEIJING (AP) â€” China was
counting on a series of major
sporting events to prove to the
world it's ready to stage the 2008
Summer Olympics.
The SARS outbreak changed
those plans.
The mysterious virus has
killed nearly 200 people in China
and infected thousands of others.
And one by one, it has taken a toll
on the long list of tournaments
China was hoping to use as prac
tice runs for the Olympics.
The latest blow came Saturday
when FIFA, soccer's governing
body, announced that the
Women's World Cup would be
moved from China because of se
vere acute respiratory syndrome.
The United States, Australia,
Brazil and Sweden have ex
pressed interest in hosting the
tournament.
Also over the weekend, Liver

pool's soccer team said it proba
bly would cancel its postseason
tour of Hong Kong and China,
and an international fencing
competition in Japan was can
celed.
On Friday, the International
Cycling Union announced plans
to move the world track cycling
championship to Europe from
Shenzhen in the Guangdong
province, where the SARS out
break is believed to have started.
Another sports casualty was
the women's ice hockey world
championships, which was can
celed four days before its sched
uled April 3 opener in Beijing.
A spokesman for the All China
Sports Federation told The Asso
ciated Press that the Beijing
Games would not be affected. But
Xu Shaolian, a reporter for the
Nanfang Sports newspaper in
Guangdong, acknowledged that
the cancellations will be a setback.
"Holding these events would
be a big help to our Olympic
plans, because holding them is a
good way to prepare," he said.
"But the Olympics is still live

years away, so I don't think there
will be too much damage."
Although Chinese officials
have been relatively quiet about
losing the events, scrapping
them must deeply wound the na
tion's pride.
In recent years, as communist
ideology lost some appeal among
the masses, the government has
tried to lill the void with patrio
tism. Success in sports has been
one of the government's best
ways to pump up the nationalis
tic fervor.
Missing the opportunity to
put on the events could also hurt
China's Olympic efforts, because
international competitions are
giant projects. Pulling them oil
requires a lot of practice, and
China is a relative newcomer in
the club of global sports hosts.
China has a lot to do and learn
in the next live years, but there
will be opportunities: FIFA
awarded the 2007 Women's
World Cup to China on Satur
day, even as it was announcing
that this year's tournament
would be relocated.
