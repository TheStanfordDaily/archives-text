# May Day festivities focus on Stanford workers

### RAGHAV THAPAR 
From Thursday to Saturday, the Stanford
community celebrated May Day by holding
events and festivities to recognize the hard work
of the campus' own laborers.
Stanford's labor appreciation weekend com
bined the historical elements of May Day with the
current labor situation facing the University.
"The major goals we had were to educate stu
dents and make them aware about some of the
issues that have and still are confronting work
ers," said junior Sophia Lee, who organized and
coordinated the events.
May Day originated in 1886 when American
workers in various cities demanded eight-hour
workdays. The internationally recognized holiday
is now mainly a commemoration of the 1886 Hay
market Riots. Three years after the riots, the In
ternational Working Men's Association declared
May 1 an international working-class holiday. The

symbol of the holiday is a red flag which represents
the blood of working-class people in their fight for
better workers' rights.
On Thursday and Friday, the Stanford Coali
tion for Labor Justice, an association of 13 stu
dent groups all in support of the Code of Con
duct campaign, manned a table in White Plaza
where students could write thank-you cards to
Stanford workers and read fliers about workers'
rights and past labor situations.
Also on Thursday, the coalition screened a
short movie made by sophomore Anna Mum
ford, a co-coordinator of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, which gave watchers a sarcastic
view of Stanford. Mumford described the movie
as a "quick educational feature that shows Sum
ford is not as angelic as people think it is."
At night, the coalition showed the movie
"Bread and Roses," starring Adrien Brody,
which dealt with the Justice for Janitors cam
paign a few years ago in Los Angeles.

However, the coalition made sure to use the
weekend as a platform for addressing the issue of
Bon Appetit workers who may lose their jobs
when Stanford Dining takes over operation of
food service in Tresidder Union next year.
Last Friday, the coalition dropped off a peti
tion of over 400 signatures, accumulated before
and during the weekend, to University Presi
dent John Hennessy. The petition aimed to en
sure that Bon Appetit workers keep their jobs,
that workers hired by any restaurants in Tresid
der will receive the same benefits as workers
hired directly by the University and that admin
istrators meet with the coalition to discuss these
issues. The coalition also spoke briefly with Hen
nessy about the Bon Appetit situation.
On Saturday, the coalition organized a soccer
game and barbecue for students and workers.
The goal of the events was to "build a relation
ship between students and workers, two groups
that usually do not interact much," Mumford said.
