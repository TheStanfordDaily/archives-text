# Bush gives talk in Santa Clara

### ERICA O'YOUNG 
Having declared the military phase of the war in
Iraq over, President George W. Bush made a strate
gic return to California Friday to address the nation's
economic concerns in a liberal-leaning, resume
clenching Silicon Valley.
In a 40-ininute address before a crowd of 1,800 at
the Santa Clara division of United Defense L.P.—
developer of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Her
cules tank recovery vehicle, which was used in Iraq to
topple statues of Saddam Hussein — Bush touted a
decade-long $550 billion tax-cut plan that he said
would help revive the economy despite a predicted
$400 billion-plus deficit this year.
"We need a bold economic recovery package so
people can find work," Bush stressed, against the
backdrop of a looming armored vehicle. His "pro
growth jobs package" will create one million new jobs
by 2004, he said.
The Daily and several other news organizations
were not allowed to attend the speech, but transcripts
and broadcasts were available afterward.
This topic was particularly pertinent to the Silicon
Valley region which, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, has seen lf> percent of its work force
lose jobs. Earlier Friday morning, the Department of
Labor reported that unemployment reached 6 per
cent in April, a figure unmatched since 1994.
"That 6 percent number should say loud and clear
to members ofboth political parties in the United States
Congress, we need robust tax relief so our fellow citi
zens can find a job," Bush declared. He has proposed
measures ranging from advancing individual income
tax rate cuts to eliminating the corporate dividends tax.
Congress has moved to trim down the package,
however. In the Senate, Democrats as well as moder
ate Republicans capped tax relief at $350 billion,
though Bush's $550 billion goal is already a cut from
his original push for $726 billion.
In addition, critics, including Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, are highlighting the con
cern of a long-term national deficit, warning that tax
cuts followed by large shortfalls spike interest rates.
Bush, however, plans to avoid this problem by cut-
ting spending.
"The way to deal with the deficit is
to have a robust enough growth
package so we get more revenues
coming into the federal treasury, and
then ... make sure we don't over
spend the people's money in Wash
ington, D.C.," Bush said, according
to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The trip was the sixth of Bush's

relatively scarce visits to
California — a Democratic strong
hold where he lost by 11 percent
age points to A1 Gore in 2000.
His speech at United Defense
was diminished by hundreds of
anti-Bush protesters chanting out
side the building.
"The Bay Area is the most pes
simistic area of the state," ex
plained Mark DiCamillo, Director
of the Field Poll, to The White
House Bulletin. "The bursting of
the dotcom bubble has really had
an impact."
