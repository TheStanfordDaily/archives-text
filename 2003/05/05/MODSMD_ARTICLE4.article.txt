More than 300 students from five
Bay Area elementary schools gath
ered on campus Saturday to partici
pate in Exploring New Worlds, an
annual outreach program hosted by
the Stanford Society of Women En
gineers to introduce youth to scien
tific and technological design.
" Hie goal is to expose elementary
school kids, many of whom are un
derprivileged, to science and engi
neering and have a fun, interactive

day," said junior Sushila Murthy,
one of the coordinators of the event.
Exploring New Worlds, which
organizers have been planning since
November, is SWE's biggest event of
the year.
Since 1995, it has offered fourth
and fifth grade students an opportu
nity to explore science through in
teractive activities led by Stanford
faculty, graduate students and stu
dent groups, including Stanford
Biodesign, Solar Car Team, Chem
istry Club and Alpine Club.
This year, the students began the

day by participating in three of the
15 different workshops that took
place in the Science and Engineer
ing Quad. Workshops included
"Shake, Rattle and Roll: the Science
of Earthquakes" and "Stretchy and
Bouncy Polymers," a hands-on les
son using silly putty.
Afterward, the students moved to
the Main Quad fora contest to de
sign a car based on the well-known
I fogwarts Express train in the I fairy
Potter series. Groups of students
