# SAE receives temporary sanctions from Stanford
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Temporary sanctions" were placed on
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity on Fri
day as a result of a recent incident involving
a pledge celebrating his 20th birthday and
drinking beyond his limit. The student spent
about three hours in the hospital and was re
leased in good health.
SAE members are trying to put a stop to
the many rumors that have been circulating
on campus, including rumors that SAE will
lose their house next year, as the fraternity is
already on housing probation.
"SAE requests that members of our com
munity use common sense and disregard
any exaggerated rumors that may be circu
lating the campus," the fraternity said in an
official statement to The Daily.
When asked about losing the house, SAE
president Jared Parker, ajunior, answered, "It
is a possibility, but not one that we anticipate."
The Office of the Dean ofStudents is look
ing into the situation, conducting interviews
and gaining further information about the
incident. SAE will have a hearing with the
Organizational Conduct Board before the
end of the quarter to determine whether
University policy has been broken.
If the Board recommends that housing sanc
tions be placed on the fraternity, it will refer the
case to the Greek I lousing Review Board, who
will have to conduct another set of interviews
and investigations before making a decision.
"[Losing the house] is a possibility, but at this
point I cannot say yes or no," said Joey Green
well, assistant director of student activities and
fraternity adviser. "We deal with these issues all
the time and it is still too early in the process to
make speculations about losing housing. SAE is
working with the University to clear this up."

The University imposed the sanctions
through an e-mail to Parker on Friday from
Morris Graves, the associate dean of students.
Graves wrote, "The Dean of Students has estab
lished the practice of imposing temporary sus
pensions on organizations when the seriousness
of an alleged incident has threatened the 'health
and safety' of member(s) of the University com
munity. In this case ... it has been reported that
alcohol was allowed to be consumed by under
age minors. It has also been reported that ac
tives conducted improper pledge activities."
Nanci Howe, assistant dean and director
of Student Activities said, "The University
does not place temporary sanctions lightly.
The health and safety of students are of con
cern to us. Hut we want to ensure that SAE
has a fair and thoughtful process."
As a result of the sanctions, which preclude
any gatherings in the house of more than five
people with alcohol present, SAE was forced
to cancel its annual Roman Bath Party, which
had been scheduled for Saturday.
"There is enough evidence to substanti
ate that the safety of members of the com
munity has been threatened," explained
Graves, who also called the incident at the
fraternity, "fairly egregious."
SAE has been working hard for the Uni
versity to end its housing probation.
"This has been a hallmark year for SAE,
one in which we have revamped our commu
nity service efforts, Residential Education
programming, alumni relations, new mem
ber recruitment effort and of course main
tained our commitment to providing the
school with a social outlet," the statement said.
"This incident is a small blemish on what
has been an impressive record over the past
year. It would be a shame to let the hard
work of our house be overshad
owed by this episode."
Student opinions favored more le
nient responses from the University.
"I think, it's unfortunate that one

of SAL's pledges was hospitalized,
but I think the retraction of their
housing could be taking it too far,"
said freshman Maneesh Singh. "If
anything, I could see the Universi
ty punishing them in other ways,
but taking away their house would
be unfair to the new pledges who
did nothing wrong."
The last time a Stanford fraterni

ty lost its house was October 1998,
when Phi Delta Theta violated the
terms of its alcohol probation and an
intoxicated fraternity member fell
off a balcony at the former Phi Delta
Theta house â€” currently the 680
Lomita house. The fraternity, which
had been housed since 1891, was
evicted and its official Greek charter
was revoked in March 1999.
