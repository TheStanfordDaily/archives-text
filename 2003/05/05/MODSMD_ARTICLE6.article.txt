Dispelling myths about the Greek origins of math
and science, Paramount KingShekhem UrShekhem
Ra Un Nefer Amen 1 spokeatTresidderon Friday af
ternoon. The talk, inspired by his new book "Not Out
of Greece: The Origins of Logic, Mathematics, and
Science," focused on the achievements often attrib
uted to Greek philosophers that actually emerged
from Africa and the Middle East.
Shekhem Ur Shekhem — whose name means
King of Kings and Priest of Priests — governs the
Ashanti tribe in the Agogo province of Ghana, West
Africa. Residing in New York, he visits his tribe twice
annually, serving as ambassador for the nation and
communicating with ancestral Ghanaians currently
living in the United States.
l he event was sponsored by the Black Student
Union, in cooperation with several other campus or
ganizations, and Nile Valley Mall, the world's first
completely black-owned herbal supplement and vit
amin company.
"He's a very humble man, a gracious man, a heal
er, a historian, a father and a king," said Ser-t Hri-
Samenab of Shekhem Ur Shekhem. Hri-Samenab, a
representative from Nile Valley Mall, who follows the
ancient tradition of Kamit, or Egypt. Her name
means "one who follows a sage with a stable heart."
"There's a lot of information out there, and the
more we can communicate to the people, the greater
their perspective of the whole picture," she said. "We
want to open their mind's eye."
Shekhem Ur Shekhem began his speech with an
introduction of his topic and a discussion of what has
become known as the "Greek Miracle." He said that,
under this idea, the Greeks were the first to address
mathematics, science and logic.
"In this theory, between 000 B.C. and 200 A.I),
was the first time in the history of mankind that peo
ple started to think in this way, and before that no
one was able to approach ideas scientifically and log-
ically," he said.
Emphasizing his unique ap
proach, Shekhem Ur Shekhem
said he attacks the issue not only
from an historical perspective, but
by evaluating the writings and
achievements of Greek philoso
phers and culture.
"I wanted to go about this by
diving into the Greek writings
themselves," he said. "In their
writings, they showed themselves
not to be leaders in logic, mathe
matics and science, a notion that
universities and professors world
wide have universally accepted."
The speech centered on refut
ing scholarly claims and teaching
methods that are rooted in the
idea of Greek dominance.
"There were certain errors that
the Greeks made that are still
being neglected in the scholastic
system we have today," Shekhem
Ur Shekhem said. "There is a lot
of science and mathematics that
should be and needs to be taught

differently, not from the usual
Greek perspective."
He used the renowned exam
ple of Pythagoras to support his
argument and said that Pythago
ras spent time traveling through
Egypt and Persia before returning
to the Greek and Italian regions to
teach his theorems. With these de

tails, Shekhem Ur Shekhem sug
gested that Pythagoras drew his
discoveries from the works of oth
ers in what were viewed as primi
tive nations.
"T here is a very racist element
about the issue," he said. "They
claim that before the Greeks came,
that before Greek civilization was

on the rise, nobody else in the
world thought scientifically or log
ically and that no other nations
even had the capability ofthinking
this way."
Shekhem Ur Shekhem related
his topic to current affairs, draw
ing a link between the necessity to
recognize cultural contributions
and recent developments in Iraq.
He described the U.S. troops' re
cent failure to protect one of Iraq's
oldest museums as indicative of an
alarming trend of cultural annihi
lation.
"Today we find a strong move
ment toward monoculture, a
Western, predominantly Ameri
can culture," he said. "We must re
alize that there are different pat
terns of thinking and cultural ex
pression that enrich the planet.
"People become upset when
they hear that flora and fauna are
becoming extinct, but they have
no idea that entire cultures are be
coming extinct everyday because
people do not show proper care
and respect," he added. "They
just assume these cultures are
primitive and therefore not worth
preserving."
