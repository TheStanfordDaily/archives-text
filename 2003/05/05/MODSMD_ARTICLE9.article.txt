Pakistani graduate student to show documentary
Sharmeen Obaid, a 24-year-old graduate student in international
policy studies, recently created a documentary about Afghan refugee
children in Pakistan. Entitled" Terror's Children," the documentary was
made for Discovery Times, a new digital cable channel partially owned
by The New York limes.
The documentary follows eight Afghan refugee children living
around Karachi, Pakistan last summer. Many children have fled the
country after the fall of the Taliban.
Obaid made the documentary because she wanted to portray the
plight of a country in the aftermath of war.
"How often do you see anything in the news about Afghan refugees
or even Afghanistan?" she said. "Refugee problems, people fighting,
people dying — it's still going on."
Obaid will return this summer to Pakistan to film a new documentary
about female politicians for Discovery 1 imes. "Terror's Children" will be
screened at 7 p.m. tonight and May 7 at Bechtel International Center.
Obaid will answer questions after tonight's screening.
