# Survey gauges interest in grad school
## Advising center survey gets low response, but indicates undergrads curious about grad school 
### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN 
The Undergraduate Advising Center has
been conducting a survey on how best to pro
vide resources for undergraduates interested
in going to graduate school. While only 119
students have responded so far, causing the
center to keep the online survey running until
May 21, respondents have indicated that they
would like to learn more about a wide range
of topics related to graduate school.
The survey asks students about their grad
uate school areas of interest, such as what pro
fessional schools students are considering ap
plying to and what aspects of the process stu
dents want more information about.
The results of the survey thus far indicate
that students' interest in graduate school is
fairly evenly distributed among several gener
al areas: 16.7 percent wanted more informa
tion about the application process itself, 14.46
percent wanted to know about which graduate
schools to apply to, and 15.99 percent were in
terested in finding fellowships and grants.
Just under 10 percent wanted financial
aid infc-mation, 15.99 percent were inter

ested in learning about how to get strong let
ters of recommendation, 10.37 percent
wanted to learn more about graduate life,
15.99 percent were interested in learning
how to write high-quality personal state
ments, while 0.68 percent did not respond to
this section of the survey.
The center sent out the survey on Tues
day, April 22, to sophomore and junior e
mail lists. The survey was to end on April 30,
but the center has decided to keep the Web
site open until late May.
Sally Mentzer, the advising consultant at
the center who sent out the survey, said it was
designed to accomplish several goals. She
said that the center wants to utilize the re
sults to design programs and resources for
students interested in graduate school.
These programs would be aimed at helping
students decide whether or not to go to grad
uate school, which school to choose, where
and how to apply and how to finance their
education. Developing e-mail lists specific to
graduate school interest and advertising
programs of interest to all students were also
some of her primary goals.
"We wanted to know where students were
clustered," Mentzer explained, "so we could
develop specific programs to best help
them."
The center has previously organized sev
eral panels for students interested in gradu

ate school and has several more already
planned. Upcoming panels include "Pre-
Med Application Process," "Considering
Business School?" and "Considering Law
School?" They will host admissions officers
from graduate schools across the country.
Although the survey was sent out to
sophomore and junior lists, not all the tar
geted students were familiar with the survey.
Amanda Pettit, a sophomore, said she did
not receive the survey from the sophomore
mailing list. Expressing doubts that the sur
vey could be very useful she said, "It wasn't
very detailed, and I am consequently uncer
tain as the substantiality of the conclusions
that the center will be able to draw from it."
Junior Beatrice Kim, who said she did
not receive the link through the junior e
mail list, said that the survey results could
lead to programming that is beneficial to
students.
"I think it is admirable of the UAC to try
to help undergrads with tough decisions like
graduate school," Kim said.
She was hesitant about the extent to their
overall effect, however.
"More funding for information on gradu
ate schools would be a waste of money," she
said. "If I was curious about it, I could search
for [information] myself."
