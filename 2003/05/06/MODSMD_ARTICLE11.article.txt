# Students decipher the Draw
## Beating the numbers game 
### GENEVIEVE GUZMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Alex Mainiero, now a
sophomore, woke up last year to
find her drawmate yelling the
number 1971 over and over, she
thought he had come from a histo
ry test.
"Nope," Mainiero said. "Turns
out that was our Draw number.
And I was really convinced that
everything was going to go fine."
With their hopes of living in
Bob or Xanadu dashed due to
poor luck in the spring housing
lottery, the group went to check
out some of the housing on East
Campus: Mirrielees Apartments.
"Myth No. 1 about the Draw,"
said Lizzie Epstein, a junior, "is
that Mirrielees is an undesirable
place to live." While these apart
ments were once coveted living
arrangements, the housing
crunch forced the addition of a
third roommate into one of two
single bedrooms. The Draw cutoff
for Mirrielees went up into the
2,000s after the switch.
But fortunately enough for
Mirrielees residents, stereotypes
don't always have substance, cur
rent residents say.
" 1 like cooking and having lots of
space and having freedom," reflect
ed Epstein, who lives in Mirrielees
this year. "We're definitely going to
live here again next year, even
though we have preferred draw."
Good Draw numbers don't al
ways make friends of the system in
their recipients, either. Joe Yu, a
sophomore who this year drew
into La Maison Francaise, doesn't
look smilingly upon the Draw de
spite the fact that he lives in a Row
house.
"It's pretty scary that a randomly
assigned number will probably af
fect your enjoyment of the next year
of your life," Yu said, "especially if

you're drawing unpreferred."
However, University officials
urge students to remember that a
house isn't going to make a college
experience.
"The most important thing is
the community that you're with,"
said Todd Benson, director of
Housing Assignment Services.
"Even if you don't end up with the
best Draw number or the best
place, it can and does still work out,
depending on the community."
So are there any tricks of the
trade in relation to getting a good
Draw number? Epstein claims that
the trick is the disability Draw.
"Freshman year, one of my
drawmates was eligible to draw
disability, so we put down all stuff
like Lambda Nu, 680, etc.," she ex
plained. "But we didn't get that
great a number so they put us in
Toyon."
Furthermore, the assignment
of Draw numbers really is ran
dom â€” although numbers are
given out in the order in which
people sign up for housing, this
random list has been generated in
full before the first group hits
Axess.
So, is it possible to bribe Hous
ing Assignment Services to get a
good Draw number? Benson said
that often times, drawmates pick
group names like "IloveHAS," or
"HASNumber lor "Love-
Todd 1," to gain favor with the au
thorities. "We enjoy this," said
Benson, "but it doesn't make any
difference."
Freshman Alice Chow, living
this year in the Freshman / Sopho
more College, still entertains
hopes of May field Avenue.
"We're looking at Row houses
and self-ops right now," Chow
said. "Unfortunately there's not
that many people in each house,
which makes for smaller odds of
getting in."
