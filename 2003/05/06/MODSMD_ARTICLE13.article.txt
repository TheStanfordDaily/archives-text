# Freshmen dean begins campaign of kindness

### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting this quarter, a new program orga
nized by the Office of Freshmen and Transfer
Students aims to improve life on campus by en
couraging students to live by the wisdom of the
popular mantra and bumper sticker "Practice
random acts of kindness and senseless acts of
beauty"
For students who have already received a
random act of kindness and an accompanying
journal with the stories of other such acts, the
Pay It Forward program has already been a
success.
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students
Julie Lythcott-Haims, who founded the pro
gram where freshmen circulate journals
recording benevolent acts, said, "While we may
have no control over world events, we can all
control how we treat others. In this context, to
encourage people to do acts of kindness or
goodwill toward others seemed like a good
idea."
Since she works most closely with the Frosh
Council, Lythcott-Haims decided to start Pay It
Forward with the students she advises. To
begin the chain of goodwill, she offered to drive
students to the airport before spring break.
Thirteen students ended up accepting the
rides.
"When the kids thanked me for the ride, I
told them I wanted them to pay the favor for
ward. This was the unofficial start of the pro
ject," she said.

When the Frosh Council reconvened at the
beginning of spring quarter, she officially an
nounced the program and enlisted 26 fresh
men, including those she drove, plus three
other students.
Each student was given a journal, which they
are supposed to pass on after completing a ran
dom act of kindness. In the journal they de
scribe what kindness someone did for them.
The 10th person who receives the journal is
supposed to return it to Lythcott-Haims' office
in Meyer 123.
While she expects that all of the original
holders will have already passed it on, some say
that performing a good deed worthy of the
journal is more difficult than they expected.
Freshman Liz Li said, "It was more difficult
than I thought it would be to do nice things be
cause it seemed like only a nice deed of a certain
magnitude warranted my giving the booklet
away, if that makes sense."
When she managed to pass on the journal, a
week after she had done a friend's laundry, it
was greeted with a bit of confusion.
"My friend said thanks, and she was a little
surprised when I handed her the booklet be
cause admittedly it's a little odd to give someone
a booklet in response to her gratitude."
When freshman Rachel Urbina gave hers to
her dorm's head house host after he thanked
her for helping with Admit Weekend activities,
he also was a bit perplexed. Urbina thought
that the journal required a lot of explanation so
that people actually continued to pass it on.
Students may also be a bit skeptical about the

intentions of the Pay It Forward Program.
"In general, I've heard a few people say that
they thought it was just an excuse to get people
to do nice things for each other," Urbina said.
"I've tried to get the word out that it's aimed at
recognizing the good deeds we do everyday
and trying to spread the wave of kindness
around campus. I believe people are kind to
each other but just need to recognize and ap
preciate others more for it."
Still, the program has had difficulty getting
off the ground, evidenced by the students fail
ing to continue to pay it forward and comments
received by Lythcott-Haims.
She explained, "People tend to say things
like, 'This is really, really cool,' even if they
haven't yet performed a random kind act."
The journals have only been in circulation
for just over 20 days, but none have been re
ceived back yet. When they are turned in, Lyth
cott-Haims plans to offer rewards to the 10 peo
ple who write in the first journal to arrive, as
well as those students with the most interesting
acts of kindness. She said she may decide to
throw a party for all the participants in the Pay
It Forward program and once she has read the
journals, there is also the possibility that some
or all of them will be published.
While no other plans are final, Lythcott-
Haims is planning to release more journals and
hopes that students will be interested enough to
seek them out from the Office of Freshmen and
Transfer Students.
Lythcott-Haims exclaimed, "I'd love it for
these things to be everywhere."
