## Freak storms kill at least 38 in Midwest 
### 
PIERCE CITY, Mo. (AP) — Searchers using
dogs and heavy equipment went from one crum
bled home to another yesterday after tornado
packed storms flattened communities in four Mid
western states and killed at least 38 people. Ten
people were missing, including eight in this south
western Missouri town.
It was"the most devastating series of tornadoes
we've ever had in the state of Missouri," Gov. Bob
Holden said after walking the rubble-strewn streets
of Pierce City.
The storms were blamed for at least 18 deaths in
Missouri, seven in Kansas and 13 in Tennessee,
where a single tornado carved a 65-mile path of de
struction. The storms also brought hail and heavy
rain; three of the victims drowned trying to drive on
a flooded road near Nashville, Tenn.
"It's worse than a nightmare," said Stacy Silver
wood, whose grandparents were killed by a twister
that blew part of their Camden County, Mo., house
down a hill and into a pond a half-mile away.
The storms were part of a huge weather system
that also spawned twisters Sunday and early yester
day in Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, South
Dakota and Nebraska. The National Weather Ser
vice posted new tornado warnings in Kentucky and
Tennessee as the storm system moved eastward.
One of the hardest hit areas was Madison Coun
ty, Tenn., where 10 people were killed. Rescue
crews with cadaver dogs were searching a small lake
fora father and son who were missing.
In Jackson, the county seat, streets were blocked
by fallen trees, twisted sheets of metal, power lines
and bricks. Officials said at least 70 homes east of
downtown Jackson were destroyed and streets were
littered with snapped trees and utility poles.
Among the survivors in Jackson was retiree T.E.
White, 69, who huddled in a closet with his three
young grandchildren while a tornado ripped off the
front porch and part of his roof.
"I didn't have time to be scared," White said.
"When I came out and saw what happened, then
I got scared."
In Pierce City, where Sunday's storms killed two
people and struck nearly every home and business
in the town of 1,400, Mayor Mark Peters said torna
do warning sirens sounded in advance.

A hand-scrawled list on the door of City Hall
listed eight townspeople as "possibly missing."
Several other names had been marked through,
replaced by reassuring entries about those peo
ple's whereabouts.
Officials initially feared the missing were dead in
the rubble of the National Guard Armory, where
several townspeople took shelter as the storm ap
proached. Two bodies were pulled from the nearly
leveled building during the night.
But after searchers accompanied by dogs dug
through the debris, regional emergency official
Glenn Dittmar said he was nearly certain no one
else would be found. Many residents checked on
their neighbors and hugged when they found
each other.
Richard and Darlene Young had been talking
about having a tree removed from their front yard
in Pierce City when the storm struck. "Me and the
wife and the little dog got in the bedroom closet,"
Richard Young said.
When the Youngs emerged, they found that
tree was unharmed, but it had been joined in their
yard by the bell tower from the neighboring First

Congregational Church.
In Jackson, a tornado warning was issued 22
minutes before the twister hit. That gave lawyer
Joe Byrd and law clerk Jen Free plenty of time to
get from his office to a concrete storage area in the
basement.
"It's like downtown Baghdad," Byrd said of the
destruction he found when they emerged from the
shelter. Free, 24, said she ran to a nearby hotel to
help get the elderly out of their apartments.
"I was knocking on doors, yelling to everyone
they needed to get out," Free said. "They were
walking down the stairs holding hands and being
amazingly calm."
In Kansas, 80 homes were damaged or de
stroyed in Crawford County, at least 20 of them in
the Franklin area.
"It wiped out a third of the town, I hate to say it,"
said Edlon Bedene, the county emergency manage
ment director. "The trees are like somebody came
in and cut them off 10 feet above the ground."
President Bush, visiting Little Rock, Ark., said
the government would move as quickly as possible
to help the storm-damaged areas.

Five people were killed in Wichita and Haysville, Kansas, where homes in Lakeshore trailer park were hurled
into a nearby lake by furious winds of more than 200 miles-an-hour. Dozens of people were killed and many
more went missing or were injured after three dozen tornadoes slammed into Oklahoma and Kansas with sucn
savage force that entire communities were wiped out.
