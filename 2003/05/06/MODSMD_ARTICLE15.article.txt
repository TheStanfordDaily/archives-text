# Bush statement commemorates Cinco de Mayo

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush, who presided over lively Cinco
de Mayo celebrations at the White
House two years in a row, observed the
Mexican celebration with a half-page
written statement yesterday.
White House officials have denied
speculation in Mexico that the failure
to celebrate the event in person was a
snub of Mexican President Vicente
Fox for opposing the U.S.-led war
with Iraq.
The administration's relations with
Mexico have been cool since the two
leaders parted ways over the war.
Officials said yesterday it was too

soon to know whether Bush would
meet with Fox on the sidelines of an
economic summit of wealthy democra
cies next month in France. News re
ports in Mexico said Fox was seeking
such a session.
Fox is one of several war critics that
French President Jacques Chirac —
who led the anti-war opposition within
the United Nations — has invited to at
tend the Group of Eight economic sum
mit as observers. Chirac also invited
China's president, Hu Jintao.
Leaders of the so-called Group of
Eight — the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan

and Russia — are scheduled to meet
June 1-3 in Evian, France.
"The French have invited a number
of other nations to the G-8," said White
House spokesman Sean McCormack.
He said that was France's prerogative as
this year's host.
As for Cinco de Mayo, Bush said the
observance provided an opportunity
"for the United States to recognize the
invaluable contributions of Mexican-
Americans to this country."
Cinco de Mayo — in English, "the
fifth of May" — celebrates the victory of
Mexican soldiers over the French at the
1862 Battle of Puebla.

"This example of courage and sac
rifice continues to inspire us today, as
we are reminded that people of every
culture, of every race, and every back
ground, yearn to be free," Bush's
statement said.
White House officials have said the
war in Iraq had forced Bush to curtail
many public appearances that might
have otherwise been scheduled, and
that no affront to Mexico was intended.
The White House issued the Cinco
de Mayo statement after Bush re
turned from a campaign-style speech
promoting his economic agenda in
Little Rock, Ark.
