# Senate closer to tax cut approval
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee said yesterday he will
draft a bill to reduce taxes on dividends paid to cor
porate shareholders.
The decision by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-lowa,
moves the GOP-led Senate a step closer to support
ing the centerpiece of President Bush's tax cut, al
though the president's position would eliminate
taxes on dividends altogether.
"We're going to have a very aggressive dividend
part of our package tomorrow," Grassley said on
CNN's "Moneyline." "And it won't be exactly the
way the president had it, but I think it will be very,
very aggressive and will send a strong signal that we
in the majority party feel that there's a great deal of
anxiety about the economy."
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said after a meeting of
Senate Republicans that lawmakers want the provi
sions in the bill from the beginning, believing its
chance of survival would drop dramatically if the
committee doesn't find a way to squeeze it in.
"The dividend has to be in there," Lott said.
"That's the main point, and 1 think the chairman
heard that clearly."
Bush pushed for the elimination of taxes on div
idends as part of a $726 billion tax cut over the com
ing decade aimed a stimulating the economy. The
Senate slashed the tax cut back to $350 billion, forc
ing Senate tax writers to find a way to rewrite the
dividend policy for much less than the $400 billion
version designed by the White House.
Grassley plans to disclose his version of the legis
lation today. Most Republicans on his committee
support the dividend plan, but moderate Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, remains undecided.
GOP leaders and the president's conservative al
lies in the Senate want to reduce the dividend tax to
zero, even if the policy has to be phased in slowly
and ended prematurely, called "sunsetting," to re
duce the cost to the Treasury. The idea may have
too little support to survive committee debate, said
GOP aides trying to count votes.
"1 would assume that it would be an expensive
proposition, and sunsetting 1 think, again, it could
be viewed as a gimmick in this process," Snowe said.
Republicans may opt instead to allow taxpayers to
exclude from taxation half their dividends, which cur
rently are taxed as earned income at rates as high as
38.6 percent. Some moderates, including Snowe,
favor giving taxpayers $ 1,500 in tax-free dividends.
The party also breaks over whether to grant help
to financially strapped states, including money for
Medicaid. Snowe and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., want
the bill to include $20 billion in aid.
Senate Democrats planned to bring out their eco
nomic growth plan today as well. The plan includes
tax relief for workers, parents and married couples, as
well as extended unemployment assistance for those
who have exhausted their jobless benefits. Democrats
also intend to propose roughly $40 billion in aid to
states and local governments, according to sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Democratic proposal will include a one-time
tax cut of $300 per child for up to two children in a
family, as well as a one-time tax credit per worker of
$300, these officials said.
Additionally, the child tax credit, currently $600,
would rise to $700 in 2003 and $800 in 2004. Other
elements of the plan provide relief from the so
called marriage penalty, both for low-wage earners
and for couples that use the standard deduction to
calculate their taxes.
Overall, the plan is expected to cost $185 billion
over the next 10 years.
