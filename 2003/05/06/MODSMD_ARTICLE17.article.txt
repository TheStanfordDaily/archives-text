YOKOSUKA NAVAL BASE,
Japan (AP) — Thousands of
wives, husbands, daughters and
sons lined the piers of this U.S.
naval base to greet the USS Kitty
Hawk, which returned today
after four months supporting the
war in Iraq.
"It's my third time welcoming
him home. But this time it has
special meaning, because he went
to war," said Arkila Campbell,
waiting with her four small chil
dren. Her husband, Marcus, of
Sandersville, Miss., is a petty offi
cer aboard the the ship.
A loud welcome party ashore
featured rock bands, hamburger
stalls and free cake, and VIPs on
hand included U.S. Ambassador
to Japan Howard Baker.
Also returning to port today
were the USS Cowpens and the
USS John S. McCain. Both ships
also played an active role in the
war. The Cowpens was the fist
ship to fire Tomahawk missiles at
Iraq from the Arabian Gulf.
"Excited is not the word," said

Aubrey Stalcup, from Wood
bridge, Va., whose husband,
Petty Officer 2nd Class Rick Stal
cup, returned aboard the Mc-
Cain. "It's complete euphoria.
They left so quick. When the war
actually statrted it was scary. I'm
just thrilled."
The Kitty Hawk and its strike
group left this port just south of
Tokyo on Jan. 20 to join opera
tions in the Gulf. Two other ships
in the five-vessel force remain
deployed.
Yokosuka, which also has a
base for the Japanese navy, is
home port to the Kitty Hawk and
other ships in the U.S. Seventh
Eleet, the largest forward de
ployed fleet in the Navy.
While the Kitty Hawk was in
the Gulf, another carrier, the
USS Carl Vincent, was deployed
to the western Pacific to keep
watch over North Korea amid
heightened tensions over that
country's suspected develop
ment of nuclear weapons and
long-range ballistic missiles.
