## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Universal print quotas needed 
### 
Last September, in an effort to re
duce spending, the University
decided to eliminate free printing
privileges at Green Library for all
students. In contrast to previous years, stu
dents are now limited to printing 100
pages each academic quarter at Sweet
Hall. In addition, the University raised the
price of printing at other locations — such
as in Meyer Library and in the dorms — to
10 cents per page, up from seven cents.
Next year, students will no longer be able
to print free of charge at Sweet Hall, either.
Access to free printing is a necessity to stu
dents who need to print papers, problem
sets and reading assignments.
While the reasoning behind this change
is understandable — all aspects of the Uni
versity will be affected by the budget cuts
— the method of application is impractical
and discriminatory. Students will find ways
to evade, rather than obey, these policies.
For example, many undergraduate stu
dents have found other locations at which
printing is still free of charge: the Law
School and Business School both offer un
restricted amounts of free printing, and
many undergrads have simply resorted to
printing there. Rather than reduce these
students' printing, the new policy has sim
ply shifted the cost disproportionately to

graduate schools.
In addition, eliminating public access to
free printing will hurt certain students
more than others, because free printing
will still be available at certain residences.
Specifically, many Row houses offer free
printing, whereas not all dorms do; as a re
sult, students who live in dorms will be at a
greater disadvantage. Such unequal access
is unfair and absurd.
If the University administration wishes
to regulate printing fairly and effectively,
it would do much better to instate a print
ing system that tracks and provides free
printing quotas regardless of location.
For example, printing could be tracked
through a campus-wide system similar to
meal plans; every student would be al
lowed a certain number of free pages to
print, whether they chose to print at a
dorm or a library. By standardizing the
policy according to student accounts —
rather than printing location — stu
dents would have no way to "cheat,"
which raises costs for both the University
and students.
Just as meal plans are usable at all din
ing halls, free printing quotas should be
applicable everywhere on campus. Any
thing else threatens to backfire on princi
ple and in practice in the long run.
