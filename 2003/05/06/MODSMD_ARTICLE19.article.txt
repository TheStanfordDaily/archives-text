# Finding the ideal drawmate
## 
### 
The deadline to form Draw
groups has already passed, but a
useful addition to this year's
housing lottery process requires
recognition: the new Web site, matchmak
er.stanford.edu.
As its name cheekily suggests, the site is
like a "matchmaker" by helping to connect
students with others who have compatible
living arrangement habits. Interested stu
dents set up a private, non-Stanford e-mail
account, fill out an online profile about
their messiness, study and sleep habits and
then search the database for students with
similar preferences.
Fortunately, unlike other types of
matchmaking, the Draw-matching pro
cess is fully non-binding: Students
choose whether or not to contact other
students, and profiles, which are filled
out anonymously under an alias, can be
changed or deleted at any time. The Web
site only provides a directory of potential
roommates or drawmates — students
must take the initiative to e-mail each
other to get more information and ar
range meetings.
Finally, the process is independent of

the Draw itself; "matched" students must
therefore submit a regular Draw applica
tion to Housing Assignment Services and
are subject to normal deadlines.
In past years, sometimes students were
forced into a dilemma; they could risk get
ting stuck with the dreaded overly-sensi
tive / overly-insensitive random room
mate, or they could draw with friends who
had completely incompatible living habits.
This situation has given rise to a num
ber of urban legends on campus, involving
everything from broken friendships to ru
inous random roommates.
Whether or not these situations are re
alistic, the Draw matchmaker quickly and
simply eliminates the threat by allowing
students to select their Draw group based
on living arrangements and similar pref
erences. Efficient and effective, the new
system brings new meaning to "match
making": For at least as far as the housing
Draw goes, matchmaking promises to be a
progressive and egalitarian process.
We appreciate the forethought behind
the new Web site and we strongly urge the
University to utilize the site every quarter
a students search for housing.
