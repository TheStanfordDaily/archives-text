# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Mama's boy 
### 
Dear Mom — I know I'm
pretty bad about remem
bering birthdays and
other important dates.
But this year I remembered Moth
er's Day — five days early! I once
read that the U.S. president, the
most powerful man in the world,
takes his feet off the table when his
mother tells him to. Unlike the U.S.
president, I can't topple a foreign
government to show my apprecia
tion for you and Dad, so I figure
writing you this letter is the least I
could do.
For nine months, I stole your
food, water and air — not to men
tion caused you unending dizzy
spells. Finally, three weeks past my
due date (I like showing up fash
ionably late) I popped out after a
full day of labor. Yet all the media
that should've been present at my
birth were elsewhere, to cover the
birth of the heir to some family sur
named Windsor. Obviously influ
enced by the media blitz sur
rounding Prince William's en
trance into the world, you named
me after his elephant-eared father,
Prince Charles. To be honest, I
would've preferred being named
after William, who's tall and dash
ing, like a true prince should be.
Dad says I cried too much and
demanded round-the-clock atten
tion, so any thoughts of adding an
other hellraiser to your brood
made you shudder. As a result, I'm
an only child, and all your hopes
and aspirations lie with me. As for
the daughter that you sometimes
long for, well, blame Dad and his
aggressive Y chromosome-baring
bandits. Besides, who knows,
maybe a granddaughter is some
where far, far down the road.

I remember reading the Roald
Dahl classics together and cram
ming in multiplication tables the
night before a quiz. To get me out
of your hair, you occasionally
plopped me in front of the televi
sion set, where my tastes changed
from He-Man to Transformers to
Tiny Toons. But my fondest mem
ories were when I pretended to be
Mario and you were Bowser, and,

after chasing me
around the
house, I ultimate
ly vanquished you
with a flurry of in
visible fireballs.
We argued a
lot — over seem
ingly trivial things
now, such as cur
fews, car privi-

leges and allowance — but a com
promise over piano practice
would've saved both of us a lot of
wasted time and energy. I blew
thousands of dollars and hours so I
could get a "Certificate of Merit,"
the trivial pinnacle of my musical
accomplishments. Now I don't
know where the certificate is, and I
forgot Fantasie Impromptu, your
favorite song, years ago. But the
verbal sparring surely improved
my mental agility.
My bottom also remembers the
occasional spankings, though I'm
sure they were deserved. I do re
call one time when, in the heat of
an argument, I inadvertently
swore at you. In a split second,
your furious scowl turned doe
eyed, and you cast your head
downward. After you made your
way upstairs, you quietly locked
the door. Then you didn't speak to
me for two weeks; I'd rather have

taken a thousand slaps across the
face.
Now that I'm in college, our re
lationship is a bit different. My side
of the telephone conversations is
peppered with monosyllabic re
sponses. Yes, I eat fruit everyday;
no, I don't waste too much time
Googling people on the Internet.
Weeks go by and as I experience
the joys and tribulations of college,
of independence in a world that is
the polar opposite of our quaint life
at home, the gutted summary you
get is, "Everything's good."
Though I sometimes appear
aloof, you should know that I'm re
ally thankful. For packing my lunch
every morning and getting me to
class just before the bell rang. For
being the first to revel in my suc
cesses and the last to leave when I'm
down. For being my primary
source of cold cash.
If my Mother's Day memories
serve me correctly, I took you to
dinner at Kentucky Fried Chicken
in junior high and stepped it up to
fancy Chinese restaurants in high
school. Now I throw in a bouquet of
flowers and the occasional music
box. If I ever make enough dough,
I promise you that I'll one day pull
up in a brand-new Jaguar, in the
fire-engine red that you love so
much.
You've whooped Dad, just as
Grandma controlled Grandpa in
their day, so please don't be sur
prised or upset when you see my
wife bossing me around. I'm only
upholding the family tradition of
men having the utmost respect for
the wondrous women in the house
hold.
