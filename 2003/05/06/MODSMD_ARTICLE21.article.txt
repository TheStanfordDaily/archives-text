SAE must abide by University rules
I was surprised to read in the article,
"SAE receives temporary sanctions from
Stanford" (May 5), that "student opinions
favored more lenient responses from the
University"; a representative from the
Dean of Students office said that the loss of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house was a pos
sibility. Receiving a house from the Uni
versity is a huge privilege, and it is also a
huge responsibility. I think that SAE de
serves a strong response from the Univer
sity when dealing with an underage stu
dent's hospitalization due to drinking dur
ing pledge activities. Considering the cur
rent housing situation on campus, I would
be glad to see the SAE house enter the
Draw, increasing prime housing for non
fraternity students, and especially women.
If SAE and other fraternities cannot abide
by the rules that the University gives them
in exchange for great houses, then they in
deed deserve to have their houses taken
away and given to other students who will
respect and appreciate them.

Dollies are 'everything that's
right about Stanford'
Poking fun at everything from the
ASSU to the football team, Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's column,
"Bring it on!" (May 5), intrepidly embarks
on the journalistic equivalent of a drunken
frisbee-golf tour of the Stanford campus.
Far be it from me to condemn such an
evening of revelry (when carried out re
sponsibly and legally, I hasten to add), but
good frisbee-golf and journalistic etiquette
demand that one take care to hit the tar
get, not some innocent bystander. The col
umn tosses a few ridiculous jibes at the
Stanford Band (what do we have to do
with the Chappie?) and lands at least one
solid comment about our music (we're al
ways working on that). But these are not
the problem.
I'm writing because one of the column's
frisbees, in attempting to hit Stanford's
football woes, strayed dangerously close to
the Dollies. I'm hoping that the column
was in jest (in which case the bumbling at
tempt at humor more than qualifies the
writers to apply to write field shows next
fall), but lest the casual reader get the
wrong idea, I'd like to reaffirm in public
the simple fact that the Dollies are every
thing that's right about Stanford. Skilled,

spirited and dedicated, their level of mas
tery and finesse is something we, in the
Band, can only hope to match. Sexy but
not too much so, balancing sophistication
and whimsy as well as balancing their bod
ies in motion, the Dollies represent the
best possible solution fora school that
wishes to display its pride without under
mining its values. The debate about the
objectification and unrealistic role-model
effect of the stereotypical cheerleader is for
others to hash out. Certainly, cheerlead
ing is a skill of its own but the image that
the Dollies project is so positive, healthy
and representative of Stanford as a whole
that we, in the Band, hope others share
our opinions: We'd much rather have our
Dollies.

ASSU Arts Grant Program fills a void
on campus by providing artists
witti financial support
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Mad
jlessi's column, "Bring it On!" (May 5),
started off bashing Stanford football and
continued to illogically meander, laying
waste to the Stanford Band, Yell Leaders

and Dollies and finally settled its sights on
the ASSU Arts Grant Program. I'm not en
tirely sure how our brand-spankin' new
program ended up grouped with such dis
tinguished and long-standing Stanford in
stitutions, but we're flattered — we think.
Let me provide a little background:
The ASSU Arts Grant Program is a brand
new initiative sponsored by the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate to address the lack of
monetary support for the arts at Stanford.
As it stands, there are very few resources
available to non-majors in the Art, Music,
Dance and Drama Departments. As stu
dents, we feel the need for increased sup
port for the arts from the University to
achieve this end.
Until this happens, however, the stu
dents of the ASSU are doing what we can
to increase the presence of art on our cam
pus in its many diverse forms. The ASSU
Arts Grant Program is a step toward that
goal. We recently completed interviews of
over 50 artists (the majority of which are
non-majors in their respective art form)
who are vying for parts of a total of
$15,000 in funding. These artists would
wholeheartedly disagree with the colum
nists' characterization of the Arts Grant
Program as a "pitiful attempt on the part
of the ASSU to bribe the artistic communi
ty into no longer complaining." Since

when has tilling a gap fora large commu
nity on campus been considered bribery?
While we realize that our efforts alone can
not solve this problem, we hope that the
Arts Grant Program will help to increase
interest and raise awareness about the lack
of monetary support for the arts at Stan
ford.
The columnists also severely underesti
mate the depth of Stanford students.
There are so many individuals who con
tribute back to the community in a variety
of ways, including Stanford's many artists
of all kinds. We have an incredibly talent
ed and motivated artistic community here
at Stanford, which is something we're try
ing to encourage to grow through any
support we can offer, which is the exact
goal of the ASSU Arts Grant Program.

Columnists 'lowered standards'
of The Daily
In my Program in Writing 8c Rhetoric
class today, we discussed Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth s Madjlessi's col
umn, "Bring it on!" (May 5). After class, I
re-read the column and found that the
tide suggests the actual tone of the column
— petty belittling of the Stanford band.
While the columnists' original intent
may have been to poke fun at the football
team vis-a-vis poking fun at the Band as a
"causal excuse" for recent losses, the
columnists lowered the standards for po
litical satire befitting The Daily by includ
ing cheap shots and airing what may be
personal venoms — out of place — partic

ularly situated where it is in the paper, op

Kendoll and Madjlessi should head
campaign fora new student union
This letter is in response to Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's past few
columns. They claim that the ASSU Arts
Grant Program is a "pitiful attempt on the
part of the ASSU to bribe the artistic com
munity into no longer complaining." I'd
like to point out that some of the art grants
critique very important issues facing the
Stanford community, a community

formed by students, staff, faculty and
workers alike. The complaining that these
columnists have been doing in their
columns resides almost entirely on their
pen-and-ink campaign fora new student
union, a place for students to come sit on
expensive couches and bowl together in
colorblind harmony, while a Mexican
waiter serves them drinks, I presume.
In my opinion, complaints fora new stu
dent union represent the wish by some stu
dents to make this campus even more of a
Stanford bubble than it already is. Of
course the Stanford bubble myth is only an
illusion. Stanford is an immense center of
power, with many policy levers connecting
it to the entire world. Places like the Hoover
Institution, which helped manufacture
consent for this heroic colonial relationship

we just entered with Iraq is a prime exam
ple. But on a more everyday level, the peo
ple who serve us food and clean the plates
from our dorm halls come from all over the
world and they live in neighborhoods like
Kast Palo Alto and Redwood City. We are
anything but a bubble.
Pan of the mission of the ASSU Aits
Grant Program this year is to give artists a
chance to redefine how we imagine this Stan
ford community. Who do we ignore when
we allow ourselves to imagine this campus as
existing within a so-tailed bubble? I must say
that I am excited about this first year of the
ASSU Aits Grant Program. I believe that
many of the projects submitted will address
this question in very powerful ways.
As for the new student union, I would
like to nominate our brave and outspoken

columnists to he the co-organizers of a stu
dent movement to achieve this goal. For it
to happen however, they might have to or
ganize an occupation of the office of the
president, or at least a rally. Good luck,
and let's see if they won't need some artsy
activist types to actually bring this about.
The problem is, they might go and ask for
a worker-student union, a place where the
entire Stanford community can truly in
teract. I think El Tony, former Zapata Res
ident Fellow who included workers in his
Stanford murals, would be proud of this.

Until this happens, however, the stu
dents of the ASSU are doing what we can
to increase the presence of art on our cam
pus in its many diverse forms. The ASSU
Arts Grant Program is a step toward that
goal. We recently completed interviews of
over 50 artists (the majority of which are
non-majors in their respective art form)
who are vying for parts of a total of
$15,000 in funding. These artists would
wholeheartedly disagree with the colum
nists' characterization of the Arts Grant
Program as a "pitiful attempt on the part
of the ASSU to bribe the artistic communi
ty into no longer complaining." Since

when has tilling a gap fora large commu
nity on campus been considered bribery?
While we realize that our efforts alone can
not solve this problem, we hope that the
Arts Grant Program will help to increase
interest and raise awareness about the lack
of monetary support for the arts at Stan
ford.
The columnists also severely underesti
mate the depth of Stanford students.
There are so many individuals who con
tribute back to the community in a variety
of ways, including Stanford's many artists
of all kinds. We have an incredibly talent
ed and motivated artistic community here
at Stanford, which is something we're try
ing to encourage to grow through any
support we can offer, which is the exact
goal of the ASSU Arts Grant Program.

Columnists 'lowered standards'
of The Daily
In my Program in Writing 8c Rhetoric
class today, we discussed Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth s Madjlessi's col
umn, "Bring it on!" (May 5). After class, I
re-read the column and found that the
tide suggests the actual tone of the column
— petty belittling of the Stanford band.
While the columnists' original intent
may have been to poke fun at the football
team vis-a-vis poking fun at the Band as a
"causal excuse" for recent losses, the
columnists lowered the standards for po
litical satire befitting The Daily by includ

personal venoms — out of place — partic

Kendoll and Madjlessi should head
campaign fora new student union
This letter is in response to Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's past few
columns. They claim that the ASSU Arts
Grant Program is a "pitiful attempt on the
part of the ASSU to bribe the artistic com
munity into no longer complaining." I'd
like to point out that some of the art grants
critique very important issues facing the
Stanford community, a community

formed by students, staff, faculty and
workers alike. The complaining that these
columnists have been doing in their
columns resides almost entirely on their
pen-and-ink campaign fora new student
union, a place for students to come sit on
expensive couches and bowl together in
colorblind harmony, while a Mexican
waiter serves them drinks, I presume.
In my opinion, complaints fora new stu
dent union represent the wish by some stu
dents to make this campus even more of a
Stanford bubble than it already is. Of
course the Stanford bubble myth is only an
illusion. Stanford is an immense center of
power, with many policy levers connecting
it to the entire world. Places like the Hoover
Institution, which helped manufacture
consent for this heroic colonial relationship

we just entered with Iraq is a prime exam
ple. But on a more everyday level, the peo
ple who serve us food and clean the plates
from our dorm halls come from all over the
world and they live in neighborhoods like
Kast Palo Alto and Redwood City. We are
anything but a bubble.
Pan of the mission of the ASSU Aits
Grant Program this year is to give artists a
chance to redefine how we imagine this Stan
ford community. Who do we ignore when
we allow ourselves to imagine this campus as
existing within a so-tailed bubble? I must say
that I am excited about this first year of the
ASSU Aits Grant Program. I believe that
many of the projects submitted will address
this question in very powerful ways.
As for the new student union, I would
like to nominate our brave and outspoken

columnists to he the co-organizers of a stu
dent movement to achieve this goal. For it
to happen however, they might have to or
ganize an occupation of the office of the
president, or at least a rally. Good luck,
and let's see if they won't need some artsy
activist types to actually bring this about.
The problem is, they might go and ask for
a worker-student union, a place where the
entire Stanford community can truly in
teract. I think El Tony, former Zapata Res
ident Fellow who included workers in his
Stanford murals, would be proud of this.

SAE must abide by University rules
I was surprised to read in the article,
"SAE receives temporary sanctions from
Stanford" (May 5), that "student opinions
favored more lenient responses from the
University"; a representative from the
Dean of Students office said that the loss of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house was a pos
sibility. Receiving a house from the Uni
versity is a huge privilege, and it is also a
huge responsibility. I think that SAE de
serves a strong response from the Univer
sity when dealing with an underage stu
dent's hospitalization due to drinking dur
ing pledge activities. Considering the cur
rent housing situation on campus, I would
be glad to see the SAE house enter the
Draw, increasing prime housing for non
fraternity students, and especially women.
If SAE and other fraternities cannot abide
by the rules that the University gives them
in exchange for great houses, then they in
deed deserve to have their houses taken
away and given to other students who will
respect and appreciate them.

Dollies are 'everything that's
right about Stanford'
Poking fun at everything from the
ASSU to the football team, Alexander
Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's column,
"Bring it on!" (May 5), intrepidly embarks
on the journalistic equivalent of a drunken
frisbee-golf tour of the Stanford campus.
Far be it from me to condemn such an
evening of revelry (when carried out re
sponsibly and legally, I hasten to add), but
good frisbee-golf and journalistic etiquette
demand that one take care to hit the tar
get, not some innocent bystander. The col
umn tosses a few ridiculous jibes at the
Stanford Band (what do we have to do
with the Chappie?) and lands at least one
solid comment about our music (we're al
ways working on that). But these are not
the problem.
I'm writing because one of the column's
frisbees, in attempting to hit Stanford's
football woes, strayed dangerously close to
the Dollies. I'm hoping that the column
was in jest (in which case the bumbling at
tempt at humor more than qualifies the
writers to apply to write field shows next
fall), but lest the casual reader get the
wrong idea, I'd like to reaffirm in public
the simple fact that the Dollies are every
thing that's right about Stanford. Skilled,

spirited and dedicated, their level of mas
tery and finesse is something we, in the
Band, can only hope to match. Sexy but
not too much so, balancing sophistication
and whimsy as well as balancing their bod
ies in motion, the Dollies represent the
best possible solution fora school that
wishes to display its pride without under
mining its values. The debate about the
objectification and unrealistic role-model
effect of the stereotypical cheerleader is for
others to hash out. Certainly, cheerlead
ing is a skill of its own but the image that
the Dollies project is so positive, healthy
and representative of Stanford as a whole
that we, in the Band, hope others share
our opinions: We'd much rather have our
Dollies.

ASSU Arts Grant Program fills a void
on campus by providing artists
witti financial support
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Mad
jlessi's column, "Bring it On!" (May 5),
started off bashing Stanford football and
continued to illogically meander, laying
waste to the Stanford Band, Yell Leaders

and Dollies and finally settled its sights on
the ASSU Arts Grant Program. I'm not en
tirely sure how our brand-spankin' new
program ended up grouped with such dis
tinguished and long-standing Stanford in
stitutions, but we're flattered — we think.
Let me provide a little background:
The ASSU Arts Grant Program is a brand
new initiative sponsored by the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate to address the lack of
monetary support for the arts at Stanford.
As it stands, there are very few resources
available to non-majors in the Art, Music,
Dance and Drama Departments. As stu
dents, we feel the need for increased sup
port for the arts from the University to
achieve this end.
Until this happens, however, the stu

this question in very powerful ways.
As for the new student union, I would
like to nominate our brave and outspoken

columnists to he the co-organizers of a stu
dent movement to achieve this goal. For it
to happen however, they might have to or
ganize an occupation of the office of the
president, or at least a rally. Good luck,
and let's see if they won't need some artsy
activist types to actually bring this about.
The problem is, they might go and ask for
a worker-student union, a place where the
entire Stanford community can truly in
teract. I think El Tony, former Zapata Res
ident Fellow who included workers in his
Stanford murals, would be proud of this.
