## A
						great week in sports for Ryan 
### 
After watching my two favorite teams dig
themselves into deep holes last week, I was
pleasandy relieved to avoid seeing their
"c ningly imminent implosions, while I
was pleasantly surprised to witness one from a team
for which I have long wished I could dig a hole about
six feet deep.
The Detroit Pistons, following the lead of their star
defensive machine Ben Wallace, became only the
seventh team in NBA history to come back from a 3-
1 deficit in a best of seven playoff series to win. Watch
ing my favorite team plod up and down the court in
those three losses was a painful experience I hope I
never have to repeat. With Tracy McGrady torching
the hoops like they were Iraqi oil fields, the Pistons
played with all of the desire of a group of Castrati
fresh off the operating table, but without the har
monic pre-pubescent voices and eventual sense of ex
treme regret.
But with their backs against the wall, something

inside of Big Ben and the Pistons
woke up and realized that the Or
lando Magic have no business pre
tending to be among the elite bas
ketball teams, even in the weak
Eastern Conference. So after pun
ishing the Magic in games five and
six by a combined 46 points, the
newest version of the Bad Boys shut
down McGrady and got Herculean

efforts from Wallace, Chauncey
Billups, and rookie Tayshaun Prince to send the
Magic back to their golf courses and retirement
homes for the summer.
In the Western Conference, my hometown team,
the Mavericks, faced the opposite side of the melt
down coin. The Mavs found themselves on the verge
of becoming the first team in NBA history to blow a
3-0 series lead.
But Pordand, whom everyone had left for dead
after they lost game three at home, decided it was time
to put down the bongs, postpone the domestic vio
lence, bail their teammates out of jail and play some
defense. After inserting Zach Randolph into the line
up, the Blazers ran off an impressive three-game win
streak against the team tied for the best record in the
NBA, including a 22-point thrashing of the Mavs that
actually had me wondering if maybe Dallas could pry
the crack pipe out of old Roy Tarpley's hands long
enough to get them a rebound or two.
But alas, it was not meant to be. In the end the
Mavs had a little too much Dirk and a little too much
Van Exel, and the Blazers didn't have quite enough
Arvydas to go around. But even in losing, Portland
has several reasons to be proud of their performance
in this series. They battled hard despite overwhelm
ing odds and devastating injuries, their coach made
countless highlight shows by coming to the rescue of
the poor girl who forgot the national anthem, and
they now have five lull months to get all of their crim
inal behavior out of the way before the start of next
season.
And all of this mediocrity only cost them the high
est payroll in the league. This is how you know it's a
sweet life for Blazers owner and Microsoft co-
