At the helm of the No. 6 Stanford women's gym
nastics team, coach Kristen Smyth's second-year
effort has been anything but sophomoric.
"She has really brought Stanford gymnastics to
a new level," junior Lindsay Wing said. "I have
never enjoyed the sport as much as I have these
past two years, working with Kristen and the rest of
our coaching staff."
While only four universities have ever won na
tional team titles in the history of NCAA women's
gymnastics, the skill level across the country has
been increasing in parity. In the midst of this con
tradiction, Smyth has managed to push the Cardi
nal onto a trajectory toward perennial stardom.
" Kristen is the most amazing supporter and mo
tivator," said freshman Natalie Foley, a three-time
Ail-American and part of the powerful trio that
forms Smyth's first recruiting class on the Farm.
"She cares so much about us as people in addition
to our gymnastics."
In just two seasons, Smyth has led the squad
where the Cardinal had never ventured before.
Last year Stanford reached the Super Six for the
first time in school history and this year's season
culminated in eight All-America honors — the
most ever garnered in a single season in program
history — being brought back to the Farm.
According to the Stanford roster, it is Smyth's
love for the sport that leaves an indelible mark on
her athletes.
"She is the most committed coach I have ever
had and is always striving to be better," Wing said.
Foley added, "She is really passionate about us
having fun and cherishing every moment of being

a collegiate athlete."
Smyth's own collegiate career — spent across
the Bay with the Golden Bears — was laden with
accolades. She distinguished herself as a three-time
Ail-American and three-time Academic All-Ameri
can and was named the Golden Bears' Gymnast of
the Decade.
Stressing the importance of team unity, she cites
Cal's first-ever trip to nationals during her senior
as the highlight of her NCAA campaign.
"Qualifying for nationals as a team my senior
year was the first and only time Berkeley has ever
been to NCAAs," Smyth said. "That feeling of
achieving something together as a team for the first
time was a great way to cap my career."
After a hiatus from the sport after graduation,
Smyth was offered the position of assistant head
coach at Arizona State University — the school
where she had originally intended to matriculate be
fore being offered a gymnastics scholarship at Cal.
"I was planning to walk-on to ASU's team at 17
and the chance to work there was giving me the
best of all worlds — I could make a living working
in the sport I love.
"I was so grateful for that chance because al
though I always wanted to coach and couldn't see
myself doing anything else, it wasn't in my original
plan after college," Smyth said.
Despite being named 1998 Regional Assistant
Coach of the Year and helping to guide the Sun
Devils to three Super Six appearances during her
tenure in the desert, Smyth was looking fora
chance to return home to the Bay Area when the
position at Stanford became vacant.

best and the brightest at such a
prestigious university. You

Smyth hasn't squandered a
minute since her arrival on the
Farm. En route to last year's Super
Six, the Cardinal defeated power
house Georgia for the first time
and finished the regular season
13-5 overall. Sophomore Mandy
Delgado won Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year honors with Smyth's

help, and Stanford chalked up
four All-America honors in 2002 as
well. Smyth's first recruiting class
(Foley, Glyn Sweets and Jessica
Louie) has added indispensable
power and depth to the squad on
each event this season.
Although the Cardinal record
books have been rewritten under
her guidance, Smyth hopes the
Stanford program will reach new
heights nationally over the years.
"I have this incredible opportu
nity and want to help create a tra
dition and a history here," Smyth
said. "There are so many success
ful programs at Stanford and I
want to contribute to that and to
help build something great here."
