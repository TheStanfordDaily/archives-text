### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
The Air Force Academy dominated the
Rugby National Championship games at
Stanford's new Steuber Field this week
end — winning both the men's and
women's national tides. With over 5,000
fans in attendance, the new rugby pitch
proved the perfect testing ground for
competition, with close matches all week
end long.
On the women's side, the semifinal
game between Penn State and Air Force
came down to the v» ire. Air Force scored in
the first half and Penn State rallied back to
narrow the lead, but a missed conversion
kick proved fatal to Penn and, with a score
of 12-10, the victory went to Air Force.
ITie University of Illinois women domi
nated their semifinals, taking UC-San
Diego with a score 0f56-20.
I n the men's competition, the Harvard
men squeaked to a narrow victory over
Army with a 27 to 26 win after Army
missed two penalty kicks.
Perhaps the biggest upset of the week
end, however, was the Air Force men's
team win over reigning champions, UC-
Berkeley, in the semifinals.
The game l)egan with Air Force scoring
a five-point try, but the Bears answered
back, gaining a five-point try and a three
point conversion kick to take the lead.
With 17 minutes left in the first half, the
score was Bears 7, Zoomies 5. As Air Force
drove the ball downfield, a hard tackle by

Bears defense kncx ked Air Force player
Mark Ward unconscious. Trainers imme
diately rushed onto (he field and both
teams were given an extended time out
and retreated to the l<x:ker rooms. Ward
meanwhile regained consciousness, but
remained on the ground and was trans
ported by ambulance to the hospital. Doc
tors later reported Ward to be in stable
condition and is expected to make a full
recovery.
Ward's injury marked a turning point
in the semifinal game. Air Force seemed to
rally after the time out. The Z<x>mies
quickly pulled even and, with 23 minutes
left in the second half, were ahead by a
score of 27-21. After the Zoomies scored
again with 10 minutes left in the game —
bringing the score to 32-21 — the Air
Force coaches paced the side-lines saying,
"We need another one, we need another
one."
ITiey got it and the Zoomies were then
up by 18 points.

With six minutes and 30 seconds left,
the Bears broke through Air Force de
fenses, reducing the advantage to 39-28.
Air Force replied with yet another try
and with three minutes to go the score was
Cal 28, Air Force 44. With only a few min
utes left, the Bears had neither the time or
the strength to regain their early lead and
the Zoomies moved on to the finals.
The Air Force triumph marks the
first time in 12 years that the Bears have
lost the rugby championships, and the
first time in seven years that the Cal
team has lost a game. The last time was
in 1996 when Stanford took the victory
over Cal.
Although the Stanford women lost to
Air Force during the Sweet 16 this year,
the team was on hand this weekend to
show off the home turf, which was pro
claimed by U.S. Rugby officials as the best
pitch in the nation.

Stanford hosted Rugby National Championship games this weekend saw the Air Force
come out on top in both the men's and women's competitions.
The women's head coach
Philippe Farner said the team was
disappointed that they weren't play
ing, but said most of the squad had
come to help out.
"I've played for the U.S. Nation
al team and we've never played on a
pitch like this," said Farner, who
noted that the goalposts had to be
specially made in England and
shipped over.
The Steuber Field is different
from the facilities that most rugby
teams have, because it was specifi
cally designed for the sport.
"Sometimes you have to play on
football fields," said Cathy Wu, a se
nior and scrumhalf on the Stanford
team. "No one has a field like this."
The field, including the club
house, cost $2.5 million to build,
and is equipped with a special
drainage system so that play can
continue even during rainstorms.
"One of the terms of the gift was,
this is for rugby, so even if it rains
they get to play on it," said Denis
Shanger. A Stanford alumn, Shang
er was a member of the board of di
rectors for the field.
"It's the best rugby field in the
U.S. in terms of drainage, the size of
the field and standards," he said.
In the consolation games, Cal
defeated Army, 75-3 for third place
in the championship. The Penn
State women also took third place
over the University of California,

San Diego with a score of 19-12.
The women's championship
game started slowly, with both
teams playing for position. Illinois
maintained control through the
first half, which ended with a score
of 15-5, but in the second half Air
Force brought the score closer, to
15-10. Both teams held solid until
the last five minutes of the game,
when an interception gave Air
Force the try. Air Force fullback
Breanna McNair then kicked the
conversion to pull her team ahead,
17-15 in the last two minutes of play.
The Zoomies then held off Illinois
attacks for the win.
In the final match of the day be
tween Harvard and Air Force, the
Zoomies dominated the first half,
but Harvard was not about to let the
championship go quiedy, and came
back in the second half, tying the
game at 37-37 with 13 minutes to
go. Two minutes later, Air Force
had another try followed by a penal
ty kick. For Harvard, there wasn't
enough time left. The final score
was 45-37.
"All season long we worked on
overcoming adversity," said Air
Force men's team head coach, Rob
Holder as people swarmed around
congratulating the team. "When
they came back to tic it — that was
an adverse moment."
