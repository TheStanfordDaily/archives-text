# Eustachy goes down in flames
## 
### 
Larry Eustachy clrank too much and kissed a
few co-eds — something that plenty of col
lege students do each weekend.
Eustachy, though, was not a college student. He
was the highest-paid employee of the state of lowa,
coach of the lowa State men's basketball team.
What does a 47-year-old married man with two
kids have in mind when he repeatedly goes to parties
at other universities, not only drinking with the stu
dents but also hitting on them? Could he possibly
have thought that his conduct was acceptable or even
permissible?
ISU Athletic Director Bruce Van De Velde cer
tainly did not think it was, having recommended Eu
stachy's dismissal to University President Greg Geof
froy on Wednesday. Eustachy agreed to resign yes-

terday after negotiating a $960,000
settlement from the university.
The whole scenario is a nightmare
for lowa State. The Des Moines Reg
ister broke the story by publishing
photos from a Jan. 21 University of
Missouri party last week, showing
Eustachy drinking and kissing a fe
male student.
If one is to judge from the highly

questionable medium of sports talk radio, the state of
lowa largely supports Eustachy's dismissal. He had
been under contract with the state of lowa through
2010-2011, with a record of 101-59 as the Cyclones'
coach and the 2000 Associated Press National Coach
of the Year award to his credit.
However, he was 17-14 last year and doesn't have
the talent he once did.
The school can hire Tim Floyd and never really
miss a beat, basketball-wise. But the embarrassment
will go down in history — few things outlast the tragi
comic — and that's bad news fora school that already
has enough trouble keeping up with the in-state rival
University of lowa.
Eustachy's actions have shamed him personally,
but the program honestly had nothing to do with his
indiscretions. Meanwhile, Jan Van Breda Kofi at St.
Bonaventure and Jim Harrick at Georgia have re
cently committed recruiting and academic violations
involving themselves, staff and administrators, yet
their serious rules violations will fade from memory
much faster than Eustachy's non-criminal actions.
Harrick and Van Breda Kofi aren't as interesting
as Eustachy because their stories are not unique.
Coaches break the rules for professional or personal
reasons all the time in very conventional manners.
Mike Price, whose four-month reign as Alabama's
football coach ended on Saturday before he ever
coached a game, is the most timely example of this.
Price, 57, was repeatedly warned during his short
tenure by Alabama about "inappropriate" behavior.
Repeated, involved visits to strip clubs and $1,000-
worth of room service charges made at his hotel by a
woman who was not Mrs. Price cemented his firing.
Yet there he was on Saturday, asking fora "second"
chance, wholly unremorseful and downright angry at
having been terminated. That's not funny — it's sad,
and it's disgusting. But it is far from unique.

Eustachy, though, boldly broke
new ground, and it is because of
the novel nat ure of his actions that
he has garnered so much atten
tion. ISU admitted over the week
end that the coach had also given a
couple of players 20 bucks for
making clutch free throws, but
that snippet hasn't garnered much
attention — after all, that sort of
thing happens all the time.
Unfortunately for Eustachy,
there is a lot of humor in an out-of
place middle-aged man, clad in a
characteristic turtleneck, holding
a can of Natty Light and kissing a
querulous co-ed.
I do feel sorry for the man. Not
because I think what he did was ac
ceptable or that it wasn't in ISU's
best interest to force him out. But
rather because it is going to be aw
fully hard for him to get his life up

and running again.
He has admitted his alcoholism
and vows to change his ways. Con
quering his addiction will not
prove the only obstacle for him,
though, as he will discover when
he hits the job market.
Coaches who sometimes abuse
their power — such as Bobby
Knight — may inspire a lot of ani
mosity, but at the end of the day,
some schools can justify their hir
ing because such anger can be
characterized as a desire to win, as
good old-fashioned toughness.
Most schools would have
tougher time justifying the em
ployment of Eustachy — who is a
proven winner and whose players
vouched en masse for him last
week — only because, in the end,
nobody wants to be laughed at.
