When senior Ryan Garko blasts a home
run over the scoreboard at Sunken Diamond,
fans cheer and teammates race to greet him at
home plate. To most people at the yard, the
run is in the bank.

Baseball
at San Jose St., Today, 7 pm

But Joe Ritzo, scoreboard operator since
1999, watches him round the bases intently.
Only when Garko's foot hits home plate does
Ritzo mark the run in lights, exemplifying the
professionalism and pride the college fresh
man puts into keeping the Sunken Diamond
scoreboard no less than 100 percent accurate.
"You've got to pay attention at all times,"
said Ritzo, 19, now finishing his first year at
Santa Clara University. "You can't presume
anything, or else you're bound to mess up."
While Ritzo's dedication to scoreboard
perfection may seem a bit extreme, it pales in
comparison to his devotion to Stanford base
ball. As a teenager growing up in Palo Alto,
Ritzo's father Dale — a former ballplayer at
rival Southern California — often took him to
watch the Cardinal teams of the 19905. Since
attending his first Stanford baseball game in
1992, Rit/.o developed a connection with the
team and the program that has made him a
well-known fixture at Sunken Diamond in
2003.
For Ritzo's 13th birthday in 1997, Dale
arranged for his son to sit in the press box with

former sports information director Scott
Leykam as a unique gift. After three hours of
rapping Stanford baseball with the youngster,
was so impressed that he invited
Ritzo bat k to join him in the box any time he
wished. Two years later, Leykam asked Rit/.o

devoted fans, but now also works the Sunken
Diamond scoreboard with constant dedication
to perfection.
to join the program in an official ca
pacity — as Sunken Diamond's
scoreboard operator.
"It was a little intimidating when
I first started," Ritzo said. "I was 15,
and everyone else in the press box
was either in college or members of
the press."
But his reputation for astute
commentaries on Stanford players
and team history, as well as his care
for the job, helped him integrate
fairly quickly with the press box reg
ulars.
"Now that I've gotten to know
everyone and I've been around for
a while, we have a lot of fun up
there," he said.
While Ritzo's official duties

stopped in the Stanford press box,
his interest in and support for the
team did not. In both 1997 and
2000, Ritzo traveled to Omaha for
the College World Series with his
mother and stayed with family in
the area.
But in 2001, his role began to
grow.
"That year, my mom wasn't
going to go to Omaha, so 1 had to
look fora different way to get out
there," Ritzo said. "Then Chad
Goldberg of KZSU dubbed me
'post-game show coordinator' so
that I could get a press pass, and I
was luckily able to be there all week
in the press box doing absolutely
nothing but watching college base
ball."
The following season, Ritzo
made it back to Omaha with KZSU
and the Cardinal. This time, how
ever, Goldberg put him in charge of

the post-game highlight package
and asked him to come on-air lor
the pre- and post-game shows from
Omaha.
But don't think the communica
tions major only sees Stanford's
road jerseys during the team's an
nual June pilgrimage to Nebraska.
In 2003, Ritzo has made every Car
dinal road trip but two, staying in
team hotels and helping Goldberg
broadcast the games on KZSU.
The on-air experience Ritzo has
gained over the past two seasons
has led him to seek a career broad
casting baseball games, and he is
now one of three broadcasters for
the minor league San Jose Giants.
"I am very fortunate at my age to
have any type of job calling baseball
games anywhere," he said.
The new job — which currently
consists of weekday night, Internet
only broadcasts — is just about the

only thing that keeps him away
from Sunken Diamond when there
is a game.
"My Spanish professor doesn't
believe that I really work lor Stan
ford baseball, so she insisted that I
get a note from my boss," he said. "I
got one, so now I don't even get
docked for missing class for road
trips on the weekends."
Ritzo also secured an internship
in the broadcasting department of
the Oakland Athletics, helping pro
duce the post-game call-in show
"Extra Innings" on KFRC 610 AM.
With plenty of experience, con
nections and — perhaps most im
portantly — knowledge of the
game, Ritzo seems well on his way
to fulfilling his dream of becoming a
big league broadcaster.
But, like a Sunken Diamond
homer, Ritzo won't count it before
he steps on the plate.

But Joe Ritzo, scoreboard operator since
1999, watches him round the bases intently.
Only when Garko's foot hits home plate does
Ritzo mark the run in lights, exemplifying the
professionalism and pride the college fresh
man puts into keeping the Sunken Diamond
scoreboard no less than 100 percent accurate.
"You've got to pay attention at all times,"
said Ritzo, 19, now finishing his first year at
Santa Clara University. "You can't presume
anything, or else you're bound to mess up."
While Ritzo's dedication to scoreboard
perfection may seem a bit extreme, it pales in
comparison to his devotion to Stanford base
ball. As a teenager growing up in Palo Alto,
Ritzo's father Dale — a former ballplayer at
rival Southern California — often took him to
watch the Cardinal teams of the 19905. Since
attending his first Stanford baseball game in
1992, Rit/.o developed a connection with the
team and the program that has made him a
well-known fixture at Sunken Diamond in
2003.
For Ritzo's 13th birthday in 1997, Dale
arranged for his son to sit in the press box with

former sports information director Scott
Leykam as a unique gift. After three hours of
rapping Stanford baseball with the youngster,
was so impressed that he invited
Ritzo bat k to join him in the box any time he
wished. Two years later, Leykam asked Rit/.o

Joe Ritzo, a freshman at Santa Clara Universi
ty, is not only one of Stanford baseball's most
devoted fans, but now also works the Sunken
Diamond scoreboard with constant dedication
to perfection.
to join the program in an official ca
pacity — as Sunken Diamond's
scoreboard operator.
"It was a little intimidating when
I first started," Ritzo said. "I was 15,
and everyone else in the press box
was either in college or members of
the press."
But his reputation for astute
commentaries on Stanford players
and team history, as well as his care
for the job, helped him integrate
fairly quickly with the press box reg
ulars.
"Now that I've gotten to know
everyone and I've been around for
a while, we have a lot of fun up
there," he said.
While Ritzo's official duties

stopped in the Stanford press box,
his interest in and support for the
team did not. In both 1997 and
2000, Ritzo traveled to Omaha for
the College World Series with his
mother and stayed with family in
the area.
But in 2001, his role began to
grow.
"That year, my mom wasn't
going to go to Omaha, so 1 had to
look fora different way to get out
there," Ritzo said. "Then Chad
Goldberg of KZSU dubbed me
'post-game show coordinator' so
that I could get a press pass, and I
was luckily able to be there all week
in the press box doing absolutely
nothing but watching college base
ball."
The following season, Ritzo
made it back to Omaha with KZSU
and the Cardinal. This time, how
ever, Goldberg put him in charge of

the post-game highlight package
and asked him to come on-air lor
the pre- and post-game shows from
Omaha.
But don't think the communica
tions major only sees Stanford's
road jerseys during the team's an
nual June pilgrimage to Nebraska.
In 2003, Ritzo has made every Car
dinal road trip but two, staying in
team hotels and helping Goldberg
broadcast the games on KZSU.
The on-air experience Ritzo has
gained over the past two seasons
has led him to seek a career broad
casting baseball games, and he is
now one of three broadcasters for
the minor league San Jose Giants.
"I am very fortunate at my age to
have any type of job calling baseball
games anywhere," he said.
The new job — which currently
consists of weekday night, Internet
only broadcasts — is just about the

only thing that keeps him away
from Sunken Diamond when there
is a game.
"My Spanish professor doesn't
believe that I really work lor Stan
ford baseball, so she insisted that I
get a note from my boss," he said. "I
got one, so now I don't even get
docked for missing class for road
trips on the weekends."
Ritzo also secured an internship
in the broadcasting department of
the Oakland Athletics, helping pro
duce the post-game call-in show
"Extra Innings" on KFRC 610 AM.
With plenty of experience, con
nections and — perhaps most im
portantly — knowledge of the
game, Ritzo seems well on his way
to fulfilling his dream of becoming a
big league broadcaster.
But, like a Sunken Diamond
homer, Ritzo won't count it before
he steps on the plate.
