When senior Ryan Garko blasts a home
run over the scoreboard at Sunken Diamond,
fans cheer and teammates race to greet him at
home plate. To most people at the yard, the
run is in the bank.

at San Jose St., Today, 7 pm

But Joe Ritzo, scoreboard operator since
1999, watches him round the bases intently.
Only when Garko's foot hits home plate does
Ritzo mark the run in lights, exemplifying the
professionalism and pride the college fresh
man puts into keeping the Sunken Diamond
scoreboard no less than 100 percent accurate.
"You've got to pay attention at all times,"
said Ritzo, 19, now finishing his first year at
Santa Clara University. "You can't presume
anything, or else you're bound to mess up."
While Ritzo's dedication to scoreboard
perfection may seem a bit extreme, it pales in
comparison to his devotion to Stanford base
ball. As a teenager growing up in Palo Alto,
Ritzo's father Dale — a former ballplayer at
rival Southern California — often took him to
watch the Cardinal teams of the 19905. Since
attending his first Stanford baseball game in
1992, Rit/.o developed a connection with the
team and the program that has made him a
well-known fixture at Sunken Diamond in
2003.
For Ritzo's 13th birthday in 1997, Dale
arranged for his son to sit in the press box with

former sports information director Scott
Leykam as a unique gift. After three hours of
rapping Stanford baseball with the youngster,
was so impressed that he invited
Ritzo bat k to join him in the box any time he
wished. Two years later, Leykam asked Rit/.o

to perfection.
