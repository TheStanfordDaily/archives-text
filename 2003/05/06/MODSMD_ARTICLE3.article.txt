During his 10th reunion, Jude Shao, who graduat
ed from the Graduate School of Business in 1993, was
in prison in Shanghai â€” but his absence did not go
unnoticed. At the Business School reunion on Satur
day, Shao was the subject of a discussion panel featur
ing John Kamm, founder and director of the Dui Hua
Foundation, which has successfully intervened on be
half of about 250 political prisoners in China.
Alter graduation, Shao created China Business

Jude Shao campaign, the evidence against him con
sisted of a fabricated confession.
In March 2000, the court returned a guilty verdict,
sentencing Shao to Shanghai's Qing Pu Prison where
foreign nationals are held and where Shao is today.
Chuck Hoover and Caroline Pappajohn, former
classmates of Shao, organized the panel to educate
interested Stanford alumni of Shao's situation and
explain how Shao was abused by the Chinese justice
system.
"Shao had no meaningful defense because he was
not allowed to review the evidence before the trial, and
he was not able to meet with an attorney," Hoover said.
Kamm, the human rights specialist who is working
to free Shao, explained that Shao is one of about 50 to
