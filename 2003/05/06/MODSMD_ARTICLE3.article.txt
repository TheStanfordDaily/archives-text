# GSB grad held in Chinese jail

During his 10th reunion, Jude Shao, who graduat
ed from the Graduate School of Business in 1993, was
in prison in Shanghai — but his absence did not go
unnoticed. At the Business School reunion on Satur
day, Shao was the subject of a discussion panel featur
ing John Kamm, founder and director of the Dui Hua
Foundation, which has successfully intervened on be
half of about 250 political prisoners in China.
Alter graduation, Shao created China Business
Ventures, which exported American medical equip
ment to China. In 1997, tax auditors confiscated
CBV's books, claimed that CBV underpaid its taxes
and offered Shao the opportunity to post a $60,000
bond.
Shao refused to pay what he interpreted as a bribe.
"I told him to get lost," he wrote a classmate five
years later, according to a Stanford Business article. "I
had set up the company's policy not to bribe any gov
ernment officials in China. I am a Stanford MBA. I
wasn't interested in unethical business practice."
Although he was carrying an American passport,
Shao was detained when he went to Shanghai in April
1998 and held incommunicado for 26 months.
Shao said that he got to meet with his attorney only
10 days before his trial in Shanghai No. 1 Intermedi
ate Court on June 16-18, 1999. According to the Free
Jude Shao campaign, the evidence against him con
sisted of a fabricated confession.
In March 2000, the court returned a guilty verdict,
sentencing Shao to Shanghai's Qing Pu Prison where
foreign nationals are held and where Shao is today.
Chuck Hoover and Caroline Pappajohn, former
classmates of Shao, organized the panel to educate
interested Stanford alumni of Shao's situation and
explain how Shao was abused by the Chinese justice
system.
"Shao had no meaningful defense because he was
not allowed to review the evidence before the trial, and
he was not able to meet with an attorney," Hoover said.
Kamm, the human rights specialist who is working
to free Shao, explained that Shao is one of about 50 to
60 American c itizens in prison in
China. Like Shao, a majority of
those American citizens are in
prison for economic crimes and
are ethnic Chinese.
"You don't hear about a Bill
Cunningham or a Dick Smith
being arrested in China," Kamm
said.
Kamm listed the ways to get
Shao out of jail. Shao can file an un
limited number of petitions, but
Kamm said that in his experience a
petition has never been granted.
According to Kamm, the Chinese
government has never admitted
that it made a mistake in its lower
courts.
However, overturning the
lower court's decision is not the

only way to get Shao out of prison.
In other cases, the Chinese govern
ment has granted sentence reduc
tions of two to three years. With
multiple sentence reductions, Shao
could leave prison.
According to Kamm, parole is
Shao's last get out of jail card. In
China, there are three kinds of pa
role — medical, good behavior
and special circumstances.
In order for Shao to be released,
Kamm said that the Chinese gov
ernment has to want to let Shao go
and that people can write letters to
their elected representatives to
pressure the Chinese government
into releasing Shao.
Although Shao's release could
be a long time in coming, Kamm
said that people should not be dis
couraged.
"The art of the moral universe is
long, but it bends towards justice,"
Kamm said.
