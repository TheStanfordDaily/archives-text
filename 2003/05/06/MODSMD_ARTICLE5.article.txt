# Hoover study grades testing
## Research by Fellows indicates that 'accountability' may improve test scores 
### MICHAEL K. PABST 
Supporters of stronger standardized
tests in schools are citing a recent study by
Hoover Fellows Eric Hanushek and Mar
garet Raymond that finds a small but sig
nificant improvement in test scores in
states that implement such policies.
Their paper, "Improving Educational
Quality: How Best to Evaluate our
Schools?" examines the performance of
various test-related "accountability" mea
sures implemented throughout the Unit
ed States. These include publishing
schools' aggregated scores in local papers
and such carrot-and-stick approaches as

exit exams and funding schools based on
test performance.
Recent polls have shown that school
teachers generally dislike high-stakes test
ing, with a large majority reporting that
such testing encourages teaching contrary
to good educational practice.
Responding to the criticism that stan
dardized exams encourage "teaching to
the test," Raymond said, "You say, 'Here's
what we want, and we want it implement
ed in a responsible way.' Why not?"
Raymond warned of the need for fur
ther research, specifically citing how her
study looks at results "on average, and
not at the distribution," and the need to
look at how accountability systems affect
students at the tails of the bell curve â€”
"the kids we worry about the most," she
said.
