# Hoover study grades testing
## Research by Fellows indicates that 'accountability' may improve test scores 
### MICHAEL K. PABST 
Supporters of stronger standardized
tests in schools are citing a recent study by
Hoover Fellows Eric Hanushek and Mar
garet Raymond that finds a small but sig
nificant improvement in test scores in
states that implement such policies.
Their paper, "Improving Educational
Quality: How Best to Evaluate our
Schools?" examines the performance of
various test-related "accountability" mea
sures implemented throughout the Unit
ed States. These include publishing
schools' aggregated scores in local papers
and such carrot-and-stick approaches as

exit exams and funding schools based on
test performance.
Recent polls have shown that school
teachers generally dislike high-stakes test
ing, with a large majority reporting that
such testing encourages teaching contrary
to good educational practice.
Responding to the criticism that stan
dardized exams encourage "teaching to
the test," Raymond said, "You say, 'Here's
what we want, and we want it implement
ed in a responsible way.' Why not?"
Raymond warned of the need for fur
ther research, specifically citing how her
study looks at results "on average, and
not at the distribution," and the need to
look at how accountability systems affect
students at the tails of the bell curve —
"the kids we worry about the most," she
said.
Still, Raymond says schools
should "give these policies a
chance."
Another recent study, by Edu
cation Prof. Martin Carnoy and
Asst. Education Prof. Susanna
Loeb, asserts that incentive sys
tems correlate with an improve
ment in the scores of minority stu
dents on a nationwide math exam.
Moreover, the improvement in
creased with the severity of the re
wards and consequences attached
to the exam. There was, however,

no significant change in the scores
of white students.
Hanushek and Raymond's study
was funded by the Hoover Institu
tion and the Center for Research on
Education Outcomes at the Univer
sity of Rochester. CREDO is funded
in part by the Packard Humanities
Institute, a philanthropic founda
tion directed by Hewlett-Packard
heir David Packard Jr. Neither the
Hoover Institution, CREDO nor
the Packard Humanities Institute
claim a position on the issue.
Carnoy and Loeb's study was
funded by the federal government
and will be published in the next
issue of Educational Evaluation
and Policy Analysis.
