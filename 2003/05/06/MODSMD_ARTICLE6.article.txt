# Blood center open on Friday
## 
### 
After a large blood drive scheduled
for this week was cancelled, the Stanford
Blood Center has decided to extend its
hours of operation to 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
Friday. The center is normally closed on
Fridays.
Without the drive and with an already
low blood supply, the center hopes that
the extra day will help to maintain the
flow of blood from donors through the
center to hospital patients in need.
"We do have [another] blood drive
on Wednesday at Governor's Corner
from 3 to 7 p.m.," said Michele Gas
saway, media relations coordinator for
the center. "We would encourage stu
dents to donate at the drive, or if
they're not able to make it then, to
please come into our center sometime

this week."
Donors may call (650) 723-7831 or
toll-free (888) 723-7831 to make an ap
pointment and get directions. To donate
blood, donors should be in good health
with no cold or flu symptoms. They must
eat well prior to donation, drink fluids
and also present photo identification at
the time of donation. The process takes
about an hour.
The center is located at 1800 Welch
Road, across the street from the Stan
ford hospitals.
