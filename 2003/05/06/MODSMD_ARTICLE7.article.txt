### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Twelve John S. Knight Fellow
ships were awarded to U.S. jour
nalists last week for the 2003-2004
academic year. The new fellows,
who were chosen from an appli
cant pool of 135 U.S. journalists,
will spend a year at Stanford tak
ing classes and participating in
specially-designed seminars.
The Knight Fellowship pro
gram gives journalists a chance to
take a year off from their positions
at various publications and pursue
academic interests at Stanford
while they are free of the pressure
of deadlines.
"The program's been around
for 38 years, and this year we had
the largest number of applicants
we've ever had," said Director of
the Knight Fellowships Jim Bet
tinger, professor of communica
tion.
Because the program has an
increasingly strong reputation
that attracts the best journalists
at a variety of different posts, ap
plications have increased, he
said.
"We were looking for people
who are already accomplished as
journalists and who aren't satisfied
with that," Bettinger said. "They
want to spend a year at Stanford so
they can turbo-charge the rest of
their careers."
The U.S. fellowships were an
nounced last week, and the inter
national recipients will be an
nounced by next week. For the in
ternational fellowships, approxi
mately 118 journalists applied for
seven positions.

The U.S. recipients spanned a
broad range of journalists, from
editors to columnists to foreign
correspondents and photojour
nalists.
"Being a foreign correspon
dent is exhausting work," said Eric
Weiner, a foreign correspondent
for National Public Radio and a
member of the new class. "Being a
journalist is not like making pas
tries. We have to constantly make
use of all we know and think on
our feet, and I hope to come out of
the year as a better thinker."
Weiner, currently on assign
ment in Jakarta, said the Fellow
ship "allows me to study in depth
what we do on a day to day basis
under the tyranny of deadlines."
Kay Johnson, Time Magazine's
contract correspondent for Viet
nam, said, "Stanford is a near
ideal place for me to study how
globalization of trade has helped,
or maybe hurt, the movement to
wards international justice. I'm
thrilled to be able spend a year
with some of the country's most
knowledgeable experts in both
economics and law."
Mostly aimed at mid-career
journalists, the fellowship is de
signed such that the fellows not
only take classes but also are active
in the community by lecturing in
classes, dorms and departments
on campus.
"Last year's Knight Fellowship
class spoke more than 75 times
during the academic year at Stan
ford and in the surrounding
community," said Dawn Garcia,
deputy director of the Knight
