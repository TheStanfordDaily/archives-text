# Stanford not immune to petty crime
## Theft, vandalism on the Farm 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
I heft and vandalism may
be more common at Stanford
than the average student sus
pects — this past year there
were a total of 745 reported
thefts on campus along with
110 reported cases of vandal
ism. In the last weekend in
April alone there were two re
ported cases of vandalism, one
involving a student's comput
er and a second graffiti on a
wall by the Stanford I iospital.
Junior Felix Lam has had
his car vandalized twice this
year. The first time, eggs were
thrown at his car. The second
time, a person or a group of
people intentionally smeared
chocolate syrup and sprinkles
over each of the windows and
driver's side door handle while
the car was parked in the
Wilbur lot.
"Now on the surface, this
may seem funny, but as of
right now, I am really angered
and hurt by this inappropriate
and juvenile act," wrote Lam
in an e-mail to his dorm list.
"Not only is it disgusting and
embarrassing, it is also expen
sive, in terms of multiple failed
car wash attempts to get the
sprinkles off, and dangerous,
since 1 couldn't see out of my
windows when I was driving to
a car wash ."
The police have been un

able to find the culprits.
"1 contacted the police the
first time, although they
weren't that much help be
cause they informed me that
there didn't appear to be any
major damage to the car,"
Lam said. "My friends and I
were joking that the police are
more worried about ticketing
people for bike lights than
catching vandals."
The last weekend in April
also saw over $2,000 worth of
damage at Mirrielees after
parties that took place on Sat
urday, April 26. The house
must now pay for tampering
that was done to fire safety
equipment, lights and wind
signs, as well as holes in walls.
"Because some of these
fines are so steep, the house
staff is considering offering re
wards for those that have in
formation that would help us
track down who is responsible
for these damages," said Mir
rielees Resident Assistant Greg
Long. "The stall is not interest
ed in getting people in trouble;
they simply want to pass the
bills to the responsible individ
uals."
The Stanford Police advo
cates preventive measures in
dealing with crime on campus.
"Report suspicious activi
ty," advised Stanford Sergeant
Rick Tipton. "We depend on
people to be our eyes and ears.
We can't be everywhere. Se

cure your property and lock
your doors and bikes."
Lam also had some advice
to prevent crime on campus.
"I suggest people to just be
come more aware of their sur
roundings and to report any
thing unusual right away,"
Lam said. "Also it wouldn't
hurt to place cameras in the
parking lots — expensive yes,
but it might help to deter
crime."
Of the 110 cases of vandal

ism reported in 2002, approx
imately one third of the cases
involved vehicle damage, in
cluding paint scratches, bro
ken windows and slashed tires.
Another significant portion of
the cases involved damage to
structures, for example, graffi
ti on walls. An activity is only
considered vandalism if it in
volves permanent damage,
thereby excluding cases like
the syrup and sprinkles on
Lam's car.

A Stanford version of how stop signs are used by people across the
country to make political statements, this act of vandalism also serves
as an example of the sorts of low-intensity crimes against public and
private property that occur regularly around campus.
