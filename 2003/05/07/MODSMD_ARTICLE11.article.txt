# Etchemendy, Long coveted by Duke
## 
### 
In a speculative article last month, the Duke
Chronicle, the university's student newspaper,
identified 24 possible candidates to replace Duke
University President Nan Keohane, who will re
tire at the end of the next academic year. Among
the possible candidates listed in the article were
Stanford Provost John Etchemendy and Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Sharon Long, who
have both said they are not candidates.
The article was constructed by examining other
universities' presidential searches to pinpoint dif
ferent categories of appointments. Possibilities in
cluded presidents of small liberal arts schools — like

Wesleyan, where Keohane was president before
moving to Duke — insiders and big names like Bill
Clinton and Condoleezza Rice.
When contacted by The Daily, both Etchemendy
and Long said through representatives that they
are not candidates for the job at Duke.
The search for Keohane's replacement is just be
ginning, and a search committee has been formed
but will have only its first meeting on Saturday. The
search committee plans to finish its search by Feb
ruary 2004.
