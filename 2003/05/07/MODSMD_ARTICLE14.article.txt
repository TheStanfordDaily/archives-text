## Columbia shuttle investigation: Tiles led to crash 
### 
HOUSTON (AP) — Colum
bia accident investigators an
nounced yesterday they have
concluded that damaged thermal
tiles allowed superheated gases
inside the space shuttle's left wing
as it re-entered the atmosphere,
leading to its destruction.
"We have a very good under
standing of what happened," in
vestigation board chairman
Harold Gehman said at a news
conference. "The orbiter (space
shuttle) was returning with a
pre-existing tlaw in the wing . . .
The wing got heated from the
inside."
However, Gehman said how
the wing was damaged remains
unproven, although a collision
with foam insulation from the
shuttle's external fuel tank dur
ing launch remains the most
likely cause.
The shuttle came apart over
Texas on Feb. 1 while streaking
toward a planned landing at the
Kennedy Space Center in Flori

da. Seven astronauts were killed
and the shuttle fleet was
grounded while investigators
looked for the cause of the acci
dent.
The board for weeks was un
willing to take a firm position on
what happened even as evi
dence mounted that a hole in
the left wing was at the heart of
the disaster. Even Tuesday, the
board called its conclusions a
"working scenario."
But Gehman said "we made
sure that there were no facts that
contradicted our scenario."
"We now know enough," he
said. "We're at the point where
we should focus our efforts."
He said the board will be able
to make a broad range of rec
ommendations this summer to
make the shuttle program safer.
Gehman said the board may
never be able to prove the wing
was damaged by the foam insu
lation, though technicians next
month will test that idea.
