# Ninth Democrat enters pres. race

### 
MIAMI LAKES, Fla. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob
Graham, an unbeaten 37-year veteran of Florida politics,
launched his presidential campaign yesterday by accusing
President Bush of retreating from the war on terrorism to
"settle old scores" between the Bush family and Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.
The ninth addition to the Democratic field, Graham
confronted Bush on the president's most potent political
issue — national security — while suggesting that his
party rivals are not fighting hard enough against White
House tax cuts.
"It is painfully clear that this president has no eco
nomic policy other than granting tax cuts to the wealth
iest Americans," Graham told hundreds of supporters
gathered beneath a blazing midday sun in his home
town.
Graham, 66, who served eight years as Florida gover
nor before being elected to the Senate 16 years ago, cast
himself as the Democrats' most experienced and electable
presidential candidate. Florida, with 27 electoral votes,
determined the last presidential election after an agoniz
ing recount — and will likely be a battleground again in
2004.
Even Republican Gov. Jeb Bush called Graham a for
midable candidate, but said the president can win Florida
again. "My brother can beat him — can whip them all,"
the governor said. A Mason-Dixon poll in Florida found
Bush would beat Graham handily if the election were held
today — 53 percent to 38 percent.
