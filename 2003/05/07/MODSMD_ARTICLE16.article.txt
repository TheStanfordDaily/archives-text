# Gary Hart says he won't make bid for office
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gary Hart, the
1988 Democratic front-runner who was forced
to abandon his presidential bid due to scandal,
said yesterday he will not try to make another
run for the White House.
"I've concluded that I do not have sufficient
enthusiasm for the mechanical side of cam
paigning, the money, the media and the polling
and so forth to go forward with a campaign,"
Hart said in a telephone interview.
The 66-year-old former Colorado senator,
who sought his party's nomination in 1984 and
1988, had been weighing a bid for the Democ
ratic nod since January. During the last four
months, Hart has been meeting with Democra
tic activists, delivering policy speeches and trav
eling to key early states while nine other De
mocrats entered the race.
Since leaving politics, Hart has been busy
practicing law, writing more than a dozen
books — both fiction and nonfiction — and of

fering his expertise on the military and nation
al security.
Hart said recently that he remained very in
terested in finding a way to serve his country,
though he acknowledged "15 years is a long
time" to be out of politics.
Hart's prescient assessment of the terrorism
threat and his ahead-of-the-curve recommen
dations on reconfiguring the military into a
more agile, mobile force similar to Defense Sec
retary Donald H. Rumsfeld's blueprint helped
fuel interest in his potential candidacy.
As Hart emerged from private life this
year, he has been frequently confronted by
questions about his departure from the race
in early 1987 because of his involvement with
model Donna Rice. He rejoined the race later
that year before dropping out in early 1988.
Asked recently what effect the scandals of the
19905, including President Clinton's involve
ment with intern Monica Lewinsky, would

have on public interest in his exit from politics
in the late 1980s, Hart said simply: "I don't
know."
Hart and wife Lee remain married after 44
years, living in Colorado.
In the 1980s, Hart was the Democrats' in
surgent newcomer, boasting of new ideas and
a centrist approach that he said could revive
the struggling party. In 2003, the gray-haired
Hart hoped to be more of a Democratic senior
statesman.
In recent years, Hart was co-chair of the U .S.
Commission on National Security, which fore
cast the new age of terrorism, and he served on
a task force on homeland security for the Coun
cil on Foreign Relations.
Hart has long had a reputation as one of the
most creative and thoughtful of politicians,
earning a doctorate of philosophy at Oxford
University in 2001 and has law and divinity de
grees from Yale.
