## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Hopes for a better union 
### 
Stanford students have been cam
paigning for several years to in
crease student space and renovate
the student union. This year, the
University took several important steps
toward granting students these requests.
Alter working with the ASSU to investi
gate student priorities, the University has
decided to drop the surcharge previously
assessed to student groups for use of cam
pus facilities, plan a centralized student
union, bring new Tresidder food vendors
and start plans on other student space ini
tiatives.
Vice President of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni's efforts to listen and work with
students on these matters is admirable.
Striking a balance between the University's
limitations of space and funding and di
verse student preferences is certainly a chal
lenge, and the progress made this year is
commendable.
Regarding specific future plans for

Tresidder, the ef
forts to bring the
CoHo and new food
vendors under Stan
ford Dining Services
will allow students
greater utility of the
union. We are also
supportive of the
University's endeav
ors to cater to stu
dent preferences as

it negouates which restaurants will be se
lected for Tresidder.
Residential and Dining Enterprises re
cendy chose to cancel Bon Appetit Manage
ment Company's lease in Tresidder Union
for next year. In place of Bon Appetit, the
University plans to award vendor contracts
to several nationally recognized restaurants
in which students have expressed interest,
possibly including In-N-Out Burger,
Krispy Kreme Donuts and California Pizza
Kitchen. Additionally, the changeover of
management may enable students to use
their dining plan meal points for food pur
chases at Tresidder, a prospect that would
allow students to have greater flexibility
and accessibility.
But the choices involved in the plans to
renovate Tresidder have not been simple.
A significant number of workers will dis
missed as Bon Appetit loses its lease. Such
layoffs will affect student employees and
non-students alike. Workers will be able to
re-apply for new positions through Din
ing Services. However, employees cannot
be ensured their jobs back. Any decision
that affects so many people's lives should

not be taken lightly.
In addition to labor considerations in the
Tresidder improvement plans, the Univer
sity and student committees should careful
ly think about the type of atmosphere the
campus' main gathering locale needs. For
example, while many are excited by the
prospect of having a fast-food vendor or
two on school grounds, it is doubtful that
anyone wants our student union to look like
an airport food court. And while some stu
dents have expressed interest in having a
nicer restaurant around campus to which
they could take their parents or perhaps a
date to dinner, the student union should
prioritize affordable options.
Another important issue to keep in mind
is the new union's open hours; many stu
dents would appreciate later and longer
hours. Students are ever in need of 24-hour
facilities or late-night restaurants and coffee
shops, and Palo Alto is certainly not the
place to find them. Students' needs would
be better met and the

union would be better
received and utilized
if the hours accommo
dated students'
lifestyles.
Additionally, in
corporating new
food options into stu
dents' current meal
plans is an excellent

idea. A primary goal
of the new union is to function as a central
gathering place for all students, and shar
ing meals is a good way to bring people to
gether. However, most college students do
not have much pocket change. Thus, the
University could invite the most popular
food vendors to Tresidder and still not be
serving a significant segment of the stu
dent body. Many could simply not afford
to buy a meal twice, purchasing a meal at
Tresidder having already paid for the re
quired dorm meal plan. By integrating
the new food choices into the current
meal plans, Dining Services can lessen
these extra costs.
Overall, it is clear that future plans for
Tresidder have been well-developed. Dia
logues about Iresidder's transformation
have been going on for years, and the Uni
versity and the ASSU have employed task
forces, surveys and other research tactics to
better size up conflicting needs for this cen
tral space. We appreciate the time and care
that administrators and students have
spent on this issue, and we hope they take
the same care while developing the new stu
dent union's atmosphere.

be better met and the

union would be better
received and utilized
if the hours accommo
dated students'
lifestyles.
Additionally, in
corporating new
food options into stu
dents' current meal
plans is an excellent

idea. A primary goal
of the new union is to function as a central
gathering place for all students, and shar
ing meals is a good way to bring people to
gether. However, most college students do
not have much pocket change. Thus, the
University could invite the most popular
food vendors to Tresidder and still not be
serving a significant segment of the stu
dent body. Many could simply not afford
to buy a meal twice, purchasing a meal at
Tresidder having already paid for the re
quired dorm meal plan. By integrating
the new food choices into the current
meal plans, Dining Services can lessen
these extra costs.
Overall, it is clear that future plans for
Tresidder have been well-developed. Dia
logues about Iresidder's transformation
have been going on for years, and the Uni
versity and the ASSU have employed task
forces, surveys and other research tactics to
better size up conflicting needs for this cen
tral space. We appreciate the time and care
that administrators and students have
spent on this issue, and we hope they take
the same care while developing the new stu
dent union's atmosphere.
