HawaL i club photo depicted a
traditional Tahitian aance
On behalf of the Stanford
Hawai v i Club, I'd like to say thank
you, first of all, to The Daily for
coming out to cover our event.
The photograph, printed on the
front page of The Daily on May 5,
provided a nice glimpse of the
dance portion of our lu'au for
those who could not make it on
Saturday.
However, I'm writing to make a
correction to the caption of the
photo, which read, "Get your hula
on." "Hula" is a Hawaiian word
which literally means "dance."
While our lu'au did showcase sev
eral hula, or Hawaiian dance num
bers, we also performed cultural
dances from other Polynesian is
lands including Samoa, Tahiti and
Aotearoa (New Zealand).
The photograph published by
The Daily actually portrays one of
our Tahitian numbers â€” not a
hula number. I feel that it's impor
tant to make this distinction in

order to respect and recognize
these different cultural traditions
and also to prevent further stereo
typing and confusion of Polyne
sian dance traditions.
Lastly, thanks to everyone who
braved the weather and came to
the annual Stanford Hawai" i Club
lu v au last weekend. We look for
ward to celebrating with the com
munity again next year.

Daily allows both sides to
represent different perspectives
I can't believe I am writing this
letter, but The Daily got one right.
Congratulations for not letting any
group dictate what The Daily may
publish. Free speech means exactly
that, and The Daily has the right to
publish whatever perspective it be
lieves will best inform its reader
ship.
People are intelligent enough
to see through the holes in argu
ments denying the Armenian

Genocide, but ignoring their posi
tion does not bring us any closer to
a common understanding of histo
ry than political stonewalling helps
to solve the question of a divided
Cyprus.
The issue of contested memory
is politically flammable as repre
sentation of the past has major
consequences in how both sides
portray themselves today. The
debate needs to be open to en
courage the development of a
common narrative regarding past
injustices. Unlike the Holocaust
or slavery in the United States,
where a common narrative is ac
cepted throughout society, the
Armenian Genocide has re
mained disputed much longer
than necessary.
Let each side present their ev
idence and if the Armenian case
is as strong as I believe it is, it will
be fairly easy for people to un
derstand that major atrocities oc
curred, but no one is well repre
sented by imposing a limit on
what opinions the press may
print.
