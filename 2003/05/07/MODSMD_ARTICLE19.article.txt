## Camp Nowhere 
### 
Going off to camp is a com
mon childhood ritual.
No matter where you go
— tennis camp, comput
er camp or origami camp — it is an
experience many of us partake in at
least once in our lifetimes. The
quintessential camp is a place
where you can escape reality for
several weeks or months and live in
a manufactured safe and comfort
able environment with other peo
ple roughly the same age who share
similar interests.
Hmmm . .. Does this sound fa
miliar? Stanford, while not neces
sarily a camp in the traditional
sense, operates much in the same
way. It is where the best students
from all over the world (who didn't
get into Harvard) gather to develop
their educational inclinations and
learn how to become successful,
contributing members of society.
Quite simply, Stanford is like a glo
rified, multifaceted, multinational
academic camp.
And while Stanford does a good
job of giving its customers, err . . .
students, a great education, it
might be too good at fostering a
permanent "camp mentality."
This state of mind, also referred to
as the "college mentality," can give
us a world view that is very differ
ent from that of the general popu
lation. And this phenomenon —
this skewed view of reality — is no
more apparent than when it comes
to political awareness and activism
here at the Farm.
Take, for example, the campus
response to the recent war in Iraq.
Walking around White Plaza and
attending various protests along
with Stanford students in San
Francisco, one would get the im
pression that the whole country
was against this war. But in reality,
nearly three-quarters of the coun
try was in support of George W.
Bush and the attack on Iraq, and
this approval has increased

throughout the course of the war.
Here at Stanford, you would be
hard pressed to find even a hand
ful of students who were in sup
port of the war (or who at least said
they were), unless they wrote for
The Stanford Review.
And in the real world, who has
time to go to all the protests any
way? It's primarily the students
who have too much free time on

their hands that
attend most ral
lies. Political ac
tivism is institu
tionalized at
Camp Stanford.
Various clubs
sponsor trips to
San Francisco or
even go as far

away as Washington I).C. How
many times have people come to
your house meetings to ask for do
nations for these various trips?
These excursions seem like ex
tracurricular activities, something
to put on a resume or graduate
school application.
And once we enter the real
world, where family and job com
mitments settle in, who is going to
be flying to D.C. for the next
protest? I bet most of us will prob
ably not be hopping on that next
bus rushing to the nearest airport.
College life can afford us these lux
uries of a so-called political life.
The notion of the liberal, political
ly active college student is a self-ful
filling prophecy, handed down to
us by the Vietnam-era college stu
dents, the real trailblazers of polit
ical awareness and activism.
As for the discrepancy between
support for the war outside of
Stanford and support within the
campus: How many of us were re
ally against the war? How many of
us were for it? How many of us just
didn't care? I've realized that
many students were either not
sure or were quite indifferent. In

deed, it almost seemed like it was
the voice of an active minority that,
due to the lack ofan impressive op
positional stance, was able to speak
for the entire Stanford student
population and say that we were all
against attacking Iraq.
I wonder how students protest
ed simply because it seemed like
the "college" thing to do. After all,
isn't it cool to go to skip class, put
on face paint and go to a rally to
chant "Books not bombs!" It sure
seemed cool to me.
Here in the bubble, I sometimes
feel removed from the realities of
the world. And this feeling is most
apparent whenever I go home or
visit family. Nobody really wants to
discuss Shakespeare or Bush's for
eign policy when everyday con
cerns such as paying bills, finishing
work and taking care of a house
hold are the more immediate con
cerns of those around me.
Camp Stanford is great, but we
do not live in the real world; most
of us do not have a clue of what life
is really like. What is the point of
being of able to recite Hamlet's so
liloquies verbatim or decode bina
ry when some of us cannot even
balance a checkbook or drive a
car? How does a degree from Stan
ford suddenly make us ready to
break outside of the bubble?
When the traditional camps of
our childhood years came to a
close, we got to go back to our
families and our everyday worries
while still living in a nurturing,
protective environment. But
when we leave Camp Stanford,
we're going to be propelled into
the real world — a place filled
with real problems and real re
sponsibilities. And the value of a
Stanford education will finally
make itself known.

Going off to camp is a com
mon childhood ritual.
No matter where you go
— tennis camp, comput
er camp or origami camp — it is an
experience many of us partake in at
least once in our lifetimes. The
quintessential camp is a place
where you can escape reality for
several weeks or months and live in
a manufactured safe and comfort
able environment with other peo
ple roughly the same age who share
similar interests.
Hmmm . .. Does this sound fa
miliar? Stanford, while not neces
sarily a camp in the traditional
sense, operates much in the same
way. It is where the best students
from all over the world (who didn't
get into Harvard) gather to develop
their educational inclinations and
learn how to become successful,
contributing members of society.
Quite simply, Stanford is like a glo
rified, multifaceted, multinational
academic camp.
And while Stanford does a good
job of giving its customers, err . . .
students, a great education, it
might be too good at fostering a
permanent "camp mentality."
This state of mind, also referred to
as the "college mentality," can give
us a world view that is very differ
ent from that of the general popu
lation. And this phenomenon —
this skewed view of reality — is no
more apparent than when it comes
to political awareness and activism
here at the Farm.
Take, for example, the campus
response to the recent war in Iraq.
Walking around White Plaza and
attending various protests along
with Stanford students in San
Francisco, one would get the im
pression that the whole country
was against this war. But in reality,
nearly three-quarters of the coun
try was in support of George W.
Bush and the attack on Iraq, and
this approval has increased

throughout the course of the war.
Here at Stanford, you would be
hard pressed to find even a hand
ful of students who were in sup
port of the war (or who at least said
they were), unless they wrote for
The Stanford Review.
And in the real world, who has
time to go to all the protests any
way? It's primarily the students
who have too much free time on

their hands that
attend most ral
lies. Political ac
tivism is institu
tionalized at
Camp Stanford.
Various clubs
sponsor trips to
San Francisco or
even go as far

away as Washington I).C. How
many times have people come to
your house meetings to ask for do
nations for these various trips?
These excursions seem like ex
tracurricular activities, something
to put on a resume or graduate
school application.
And once we enter the real
world, where family and job com
mitments settle in, who is going to
be flying to D.C. for the next
protest? I bet most of us will prob
ably not be hopping on that next
bus rushing to the nearest airport.
College life can afford us these lux
uries of a so-called political life.
The notion of the liberal, political
ly active college student is a self-ful
filling prophecy, handed down to
us by the Vietnam-era college stu
dents, the real trailblazers of polit
ical awareness and activism.
As for the discrepancy between
support for the war outside of
Stanford and support within the
campus: How many of us were re
ally against the war? How many of
us were for it? How many of us just
didn't care? I've realized that
many students were either not
sure or were quite indifferent. In

deed, it almost seemed like it was
the voice of an active minority that,
due to the lack ofan impressive op
positional stance, was able to speak
for the entire Stanford student
population and say that we were all
against attacking Iraq.
I wonder how students protest
ed simply because it seemed like
the "college" thing to do. After all,
isn't it cool to go to skip class, put
on face paint and go to a rally to
chant "Books not bombs!" It sure
seemed cool to me.
Here in the bubble, I sometimes
feel removed from the realities of
the world. And this feeling is most
apparent whenever I go home or
visit family. Nobody really wants to
discuss Shakespeare or Bush's for
eign policy when everyday con
cerns such as paying bills, finishing
work and taking care of a house
hold are the more immediate con
cerns of those around me.
Camp Stanford is great, but we
do not live in the real world; most
of us do not have a clue of what life
is really like. What is the point of
being of able to recite Hamlet's so
liloquies verbatim or decode bina
ry when some of us cannot even
balance a checkbook or drive a
car? How does a degree from Stan
ford suddenly make us ready to
break outside of the bubble?
When the traditional camps of
our childhood years came to a
close, we got to go back to our
families and our everyday worries
while still living in a nurturing,
protective environment. But
when we leave Camp Stanford,
we're going to be propelled into
the real world — a place filled
with real problems and real re
sponsibilities. And the value of a
Stanford education will finally
make itself known.
