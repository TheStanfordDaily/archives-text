## Palestinians massacred in 1948 war 
### AMMAR MUNIR NAYFEH GUEST COLUMNIST 
Theodor Herzl wrote in his di
aries about how to bring about the
exodus of the native Palestinians,
which would enable the Zionists to
create a purely Jewish state. In his
June 12, 1085 entry, Herzl wrote:
"We must expropriate gently the
private property on the estates as
signed to us. We should try to spir
it the penniless Arab population
across the borders by procuring
employment for it in the transit
countries, while denying it any
employment in our country."
Herzl's statement seems to be
mild, but the principle of evicting
the Palestinian population in the
future Jewish state was already
stated.
The process of expropriating
the property of the Palestinians,
however, was carried out during
and in the aftermath of the war of

-1948, which was accompanied by
a large number of massacres.
These massacres were the main
instrument for forcing the Pales
tinians to leave and then expro
priating their properties under
the 1950 Absentee Property Law.
The Israeli newspaper Ha'ir
had an article titled "Massacres of
Palestinians in 1947-49: During
the War, Many Arabs Were Mas
sacred by Jews Not Only in Deir
Yassin," published May 6, 1992,
on the eve of Israel Independence
Day and included details of previ
ously unreported massacres. In
the article, the Israeli historian
Aryeh Yitzhaki concludes that "at
least 20 large massacres of Arabs
took place during the War of In
dependence (defined as over 50
murdered in each massacre) and
about 100 small massacres (de
fined as of individuals of small
groups). These massacres had a
profound effect on the fleeing of

Arabs from the country."
Yitzhaki points out that "for
many Israelis it was easy to cling to
the safe claim that the Arabs left
the country because that was what
their leaders ordered. That is a
total lie. The fundamental cause
for the flight of the Arabs was their
fear of Israeli violence and that
fear had a basis in reality. From al
most every report which appears
in the [Israeli] army's archives
about the occupation of Arab vil
lages from May to July in 1948,
the height of confrontations with
the Arab villagers, there comes the
smell of a massacre." People may
wonder: Why massacre the Arabs?
In 1947, the United Nations
voted to partition Palestine into
two states: one Arab state and one
Jewish state, and it was clear to
the Zionist Jews that the Jewish
state would have an equal num-
