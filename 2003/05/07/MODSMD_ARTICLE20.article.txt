## Palestinians massacred in 1948 war 
### AMMAR MUNIR NAYFEH GUEST COLUMNIST 
Theodor Herzl wrote in his di
aries about how to bring about the
exodus of the native Palestinians,
which would enable the Zionists to
create a purely Jewish state. In his
June 12, 1085 entry, Herzl wrote:
"We must expropriate gently the
private property on the estates as
signed to us. We should try to spir
it the penniless Arab population
across the borders by procuring
employment for it in the transit
countries, while denying it any
employment in our country."
Herzl's statement seems to be
mild, but the principle of evicting
the Palestinian population in the
future Jewish state was already
stated.
The process of expropriating
the property of the Palestinians,
however, was carried out during
and in the aftermath of the war of

-1948, which was accompanied by
a large number of massacres.
These massacres were the main
instrument for forcing the Pales
tinians to leave and then expro
priating their properties under
the 1950 Absentee Property Law.
The Israeli newspaper Ha'ir
had an article titled "Massacres of
Palestinians in 1947-49: During
the War, Many Arabs Were Mas
sacred by Jews Not Only in Deir
Yassin," published May 6, 1992,
on the eve of Israel Independence
Day and included details of previ
ously unreported massacres. In
the article, the Israeli historian
Aryeh Yitzhaki concludes that "at
least 20 large massacres of Arabs
took place during the War of In
dependence (defined as over 50
murdered in each massacre) and
about 100 small massacres (de
fined as of individuals of small
groups). These massacres had a
profound effect on the fleeing of

Arabs from the country."
Yitzhaki points out that "for
many Israelis it was easy to cling to
the safe claim that the Arabs left
the country because that was what
their leaders ordered. That is a
total lie. The fundamental cause
for the flight of the Arabs was their
fear of Israeli violence and that
fear had a basis in reality. From al
most every report which appears
in the [Israeli] army's archives
about the occupation of Arab vil
lages from May to July in 1948,
the height of confrontations with
the Arab villagers, there comes the
smell of a massacre." People may
wonder: Why massacre the Arabs?
In 1947, the United Nations
voted to partition Palestine into
two states: one Arab state and one
Jewish state, and it was clear to
the Zionist Jews that the Jewish
state would have an equal num-
ber of Arabs and Jews. The Zionist Jews
wanted a purely Jewish state with a deci
sive Jewish majority. This could have
been accomplished through a massive
and forceful expulsion of Palestinians
from the Jewish state. In fact, this expul
sion was planned before the war started.
This plan was brought out by Sir John
Bagot Glubb of England who relates in
his book "A Soldier With the Arabs," an
encounter between a British officer and
a Zionist officer before the war in De
cember 1947. When asked about the
United Nations' partition plan and the
fact that the Jewish state would have in
ternal problems from a large Arab popu
lation, the Zionist officer responded:
"That will be fixed. A few calculated
massacres will get rid of them!"
The massacre of Deir Yassin was the

darkest stain on the Jewish record
throughout all the fighting. It is histori
cally important because it was to become
the beginning of a second legend with
which Israeli terrorists sought to serve
their cause and justify their deeds. Just as
they claimed credit for the British deci
sion to leave Palestine as the result of the
terrorists attacks on British troops, they
later justified the massacre of Deir Yassin
because it led to the panic flight of the re
maining Arabs in the Jewish state and less
ened the Jewish casualties.
The intent and systematic and delib
erate nature of this massacre in this case
is very important and relevant to the
main study of this topic. Crimes against
humanity are those acts that are commit
ted by anyone or any group against a
civilian population who act intentionally,
deliberately and systematically. The in
tent was to inflict upon the Palestinian
civilian population a major blow that
would result in a psychological edge
gained by the Israeli forces. This psy

chological weapon, coupled with a mas
sive media campaign, focused on the
civilian population and made fleeing the
only logical option.
The use of terror on the civilian popu
lation was neither an isolated incident nor
some soldiers acting illegally. On the con
trary, it was the norm and the understood
mode of operation. The strategic goal of a
majority Jewish state was to be accom
plished â€” even to the point of commit
ting acts of genocide against a defenseless
civilian population. What is far more re
markable is the ability of the Israeli society
to collectively participate in a successful
worldwide campaign of disinformation
and obfuscation of the facts of the 1948
record of genocide.
What makes 800,000 civilians flee their
country in a short period of time without
carrying any belongings? The late
William Zukerman, editor of the Jewish
Newsletter, concluded that "the flight of
the Palestine Arabs, which created the
Arab refugee problem, was not a sponta

neous act, nor due entirely to the propa
ganda call of the Arab leaders as the Zion
ists have claimed all along. It was a coldly
calculated plan executed by the Irgun,
but with the knowledge of the Hagana
and the Jewish Agency of the time."
In the aftermath of the 1948 war, the
newly formed Israeli government em
barked on a massive program of confisca
tion of Palestinian properties and lands.
Fully furnished Palestinian houses, large
farms and lands were given to Zionist
Jews to live in and own. The Israeli gov
ernment then issued the 1950 Absentee
Property Law which labeled the property
of the Palestinians expelled by force as ab
sentee property. Moreover, the Israeli
government issued the Land Acquisition
Law of 1953, which transferred the ab
sentees' properties into the hands of the
Jewish National Fund. These laws com
pleted the process of the dispossession of
the Palestinians. It started with their
forced expulsion, considered them absent
from their property and finally took all

their properties.
To compare these events to a more re
cent occurrence, one can recall Bosnia
and the massive campaign of ethnic
cleansing directed at the Bosnian civilian
population to comprehend what took
place in 1948 in Palestine. Certainly, the
Bosnian civilians did not leave their
homes in the thousands on their own,
rather they were forced out by the Serbs.
Our perceptions of what took place in
1948 are constructed to fit the accepted
world view that considers the establish
ment of the State of Israel as a positive de
velopment.
If one admits that the state was found
ed on the principle of genocide and eth
nic cleansing, then the need to remedy
the injustices becomes more compelling.
