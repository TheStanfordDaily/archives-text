## Celebrating freedom, progress on Israel Independence Day 
### DAN KAGANOVICH GUEST COLUMNIST 
Today is Israel's Independence Day, Yom
Ha'atzmaut, when the Jewish people cele
brate their return to their ancient homeland
and the birth of the State of Israel. Fifty-five
years ago today, Israelis realized their age-old
dream to live as a free people in their own
land. Yom Ha'atzmaut is a celebration of
freedom, falafel and an assertion of the right
of thejewish people, like every people, to self
determination.
The Jewish people have a long history of
celebrating freedom. In thejewish tradition,
there is a commandment that on Passover,
(which comes shortly before Yom Ha'atz
maut and celebrates the freedom of the Jew
ish people from slavery in Egypt) each Jew
must see himself as though he had personal
ly been freed from slavery. To me, this par
ticular commandment was never difficult to
observe, nor was it even a matter of allegory.
When I was 10 years old, my family and I fled
from the Estonian Republic of the Soviet
Union, a place where the word "Jew" was it
self a grossly derogatory term and where af
filiation with a Jewish national or religious

movement — even the mere study of our
Hebrew language — was punishable by im
prisonment. Along with a group of other
refugees, we left with the few belongings that
could fit into a small suitcase and a duffel bag
(which sometimes doubled as a bed for me
and my five-year-old brother when we were
stranded at various train stations in Austria,
Hungary and Italy).
Thus, despite the obvious way in which I
can see myself as having been personally
freed from slavery, it occurs to me that there
are two radically different ways to view and
commemorate that freedom. Either, as Jews,
we can remember our release from slavery by
viewing ourselves as victims of teirible op
pression, or we can celebrate our miraculous
passage from slavery to freedom as the ulti
mate affirmation of human dignity, a pinna
cle of human achievement.
Yom Ha'atzmaut is a celebration of the
Jewish people's refusal to see themselves as
victims. In one of the bloodiest centuries in
history, during which a large population was
brutally victimized, the Jewish people pro
duced one of history's great achievements on
the heals of their biggest tragedy. Whereas
many people have come to worship victim

hood, the Jewish people, with most of the
world united against them, revived their na
tion, resurrected a dead language and built a
thriving country where much of the terrain
was once swamp and desert.
In its first 55 years of existence, Israel has
become a major player in the world's econo
my. Israel is a center of high-tech industry
and scientific innovation. Many regard Is
rael's scientific research community as sec
ond only to that of the United States. In ad
dition to its national achievements, Isiael is at
the forefront of economic and technical de
velopment in struggling countries around
the world. Having accomplished the un
precedented re-forestation of Israel, Israeli
engineers have aided in agricultural devel
opment in India, several of the former Soviet
Republics, as well as in other countries. Israel
has also fostered a liberal and tolerant democ
racy in a region where such a system of self
government is extremely rare.
Despite Israel's obvious success and its
radically positive contribution to the world,
many of my friends find it challenging to
truly celebrate its Independence Day because
of the massive and united front against the
nation and what it stands for. I suggest that

one of the reasons that the propaganda
against Israel and the Jewish people is so
übiquitous and overwhelming is that Israel
poses an existential challenge to ideologies
diat identify themselves primarily with vic
umhood.
How else does one explain that while the
Jews claim only die smallest of lands as dieir
own, they are accused of wanting too much
— merely a piece of real estate the size of New
Jersey? How else could a country which has
been attacked by every nation around it —
and despite Uiis aggression has often sought
peace with its neighbors — be blamed for all
violence perpetrated against it?
A few years ago, I listened to the prime
minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, speak to a
group of young people at the Maccabi Games
in Tel Aviv. Echoing one of die founders of
the State of Israel he told diem, "Everything
is in our hands." The people of Israel have
looked at every tragedy that has befallen the
Jewish people and have said, "We and we
alone can make die world safe for thejewish
nation." And in diis victory of self-determina
tion over oppression there is something to
celebrate for everyone: Jews, Muslims and all
people who value freedom and tolerance

over tyranny.
Holocaust survivor and author Elie
Wiesel once said, "No one has a monopoly on
suffering. The question is what you do with
it." While, several societies have historically
used the tart that many of their people are
refugees as an excuse for failure and belliger
ence, Israel has absorbed over a million
refugees from the former Soviet Union and
another million from surrounding Middle
Eastern countries in less than a generation.
While in the past some societies have used
their ethnic diversity to excuse totalitarian
ism, Israel's vibrant democracy is home to
people of all ethnic backgrounds and creeds,
from over 50 different countries, including
Morocco, England, Russia, Ethiopia, Yemen,
Germany and even the United States. In the
eyes of many, Israel has succeeded where ide
ologies of victimhood have failed. It is time for
everyone to celebrate Israel: a small country
with wonderful food, music and culture, that
gives all of us, Jews and non-Jews, so much
hope for the future.

Today is Israel's Independence Day, Yom
Ha'atzmaut, when the Jewish people cele
brate their return to their ancient homeland
and the birth of the State of Israel. Fifty-five
years ago today, Israelis realized their age-old
dream to live as a free people in their own
land. Yom Ha'atzmaut is a celebration of
freedom, falafel and an assertion of the right
of thejewish people, like every people, to self
determination.
The Jewish people have a long history of
celebrating freedom. In thejewish tradition,
there is a commandment that on Passover,
(which comes shortly before Yom Ha'atz
maut and celebrates the freedom of the Jew
ish people from slavery in Egypt) each Jew
must see himself as though he had personal
ly been freed from slavery. To me, this par
ticular commandment was never difficult to
observe, nor was it even a matter of allegory.
When I was 10 years old, my family and I fled
from the Estonian Republic of the Soviet
Union, a place where the word "Jew" was it
self a grossly derogatory term and where af
filiation with a Jewish national or religious

movement — even the mere study of our
Hebrew language — was punishable by im
prisonment. Along with a group of other
refugees, we left with the few belongings that
could fit into a small suitcase and a duffel bag
(which sometimes doubled as a bed for me
and my five-year-old brother when we were
stranded at various train stations in Austria,
Hungary and Italy).
Thus, despite the obvious way in which I
can see myself as having been personally
freed from slavery, it occurs to me that there
are two radically different ways to view and
commemorate that freedom. Either, as Jews,
we can remember our release from slavery by
viewing ourselves as victims of teirible op
pression, or we can celebrate our miraculous
passage from slavery to freedom as the ulti
mate affirmation of human dignity, a pinna
cle of human achievement.
Yom Ha'atzmaut is a celebration of the
Jewish people's refusal to see themselves as
victims. In one of the bloodiest centuries in
history, during which a large population was
brutally victimized, the Jewish people pro
duced one of history's great achievements on
the heals of their biggest tragedy. Whereas
many people have come to worship victim

hood, the Jewish people, with most of the
world united against them, revived their na
tion, resurrected a dead language and built a
thriving country where much of the terrain
was once swamp and desert.
In its first 55 years of existence, Israel has
become a major player in the world's econo
my. Israel is a center of high-tech industry
and scientific innovation. Many regard Is
rael's scientific research community as sec
ond only to that of the United States. In ad
dition to its national achievements, Isiael is at
the forefront of economic and technical de
velopment in struggling countries around
the world. Having accomplished the un
precedented re-forestation of Israel, Israeli
engineers have aided in agricultural devel
opment in India, several of the former Soviet
Republics, as well as in other countries. Israel
has also fostered a liberal and tolerant democ
racy in a region where such a system of self
government is extremely rare.
Despite Israel's obvious success and its
radically positive contribution to the world,
many of my friends find it challenging to
truly celebrate its Independence Day because
of the massive and united front against the
nation and what it stands for. I suggest that

one of the reasons that the propaganda
against Israel and the Jewish people is so
übiquitous and overwhelming is that Israel
poses an existential challenge to ideologies
diat identify themselves primarily with vic
umhood.
How else does one explain that while the
Jews claim only die smallest of lands as dieir
own, they are accused of wanting too much
— merely a piece of real estate the size of New
Jersey? How else could a country which has
been attacked by every nation around it —
and despite Uiis aggression has often sought
peace with its neighbors — be blamed for all
violence perpetrated against it?
