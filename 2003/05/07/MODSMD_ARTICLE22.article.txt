## Lee twists and twirls to nationals 
### ALISON PIERCE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jason Lee admits it's a little weird that
he doesn't like to talk about his sport very
much. Alter all, it's a sport he spends
three hours a day training for and thou
sands of dollars a year supporting.
But Lee, a champion baton twirler
since he was an adolescent, says that
when he does mention it, people think
parades or cheerleading â€” and that's
just not the case.
"Imagine dance and gymnastics while
twirling a 30-inch rod with routines like
ice skating," Lee said.
The 21-year-old Lee, a junior double
major in communication and drama,
started twirling at age 11 when his
younger sister brought home a baton set
from Toys 'R' Us. Lee's sister Monica,
who now attends UCLA, also competes
and her ranking hovers around No. 30 in
the nation.
"I was a competitive little boy and
looked at her practicing and said, 'I can
do that,'" Lee said. "I just wanted to beat
the girls," he went on, acknowledging
that there are far more females that com
pete in twirling than males.
Lee is currently ranked No. 5 in the
world. Over spring break, Lee competed
in pairs with his sister at the U.S. Twirling
Trials and he often travels to contests
sponsored by the United States Twirling
Association throughout California on the
weekends.

Lee has traveled to world champi
onships in Hawaii, Switzerland, Italy,
Holland, France twice, Canada, and the
U.S. twice. Twenty different countries
compete in baton twirling today.
All the traveling and practice has taken
a toll on Lee's social life.
"No one really knew me in high school
except as the baton guy, which I really
tried to avoid at Stanford because then
your self confidence is all in how well
you're twirling," Lee said.
Lee points out that twirlers work hard
for very little prestige because you won't
see baton twirling on ESPN or other
sports networks and there are not
enough countries that compete in
twirling for it to be considered an
Olympic sport.
Because baton twirling is not consid
ered a "real sport," Lee struggles not only
with the amount of time that he puts into
twirling, but with finding a rehearsal
schedule that works around every otlier
sport or class.
Lee often finds time in between classes
to practice in Roble gym but he's some
times exiled to the basketball court in
front of Casa Zapata.
"One day these guys came and kicked
me off because they wanted to play full
court," Lee said. "Sometimes I wish I
could just throw it in their face: 'You
know what you are playing for fun and I
am practicing for the national champi
onships here.'"
To compete successfully in baton

twirling you need a choreographer, a
place to train and money to travel, enter
contests and buy costumes, said Lee.
Lee's family has always been very sup
portive despite the financial burden of a
sponsor-less sport.
A few years ago, when his family could
no longer support his twirling, Lee start
ed working 17 to 18 hours a week at the
FloMo dining hall.
"I feel like I have it so much harder
than every other athlete at Stanford," Lee
said. "They get everything free and I
have to work so I can pay for plane tickets
and costumes and everything."
So why does he do it?
"I love showing off for people," Lee
said. "I walk into a competition and I'm a
different person."
Lee is considered a legend in the baton
twirling circle, he admitted. He hasn't lost
in the men's division since 1996.
"There just isn't a man that can chal
lenge me right now," Lee said.
Lee doesn't perform very often at
Stanford because there just aren't the op
portunities. His last performance was at
An Art Affair.
Lee said that the Stanford Band ap
proached him once about twirling with
them at football games and one year he
twirled on the sidelines at Big Game.
"They told me 1 was a little too serious
and couldn't 1 just act wacky," Lee said.
"But after so many years of serious
