# When good coaches get down and dirty
## 
### 
Imagine this scenario: Stan
ford football coach Buddy
Teevens is fired for commit
ting an egregious crime on
campus: running a stop sign at
2:35 a.m. after leaving Arrillaga
Family Sports Complex.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
commented on the disappointing
episode fora coach well-liked in
the Department of Athletics.
"We find it difficult to under
stand how such an upstanding, re
spected coach could sink so low as
to commit a crime so heinous as
this one. It is ironic that he had
just left the Arrillaga Family
Sports Complex, because this is an
incident that shows no regard to
traditional family values ... we
here at Stanford aren't mad with
Mr. Teevens, we are just disap-

pointed with his
judgment. We
feel that we can
not entrust our
student-athletes
with a coach who
uses such poor
judgment as Mr.
Teevens showed
us he is capable
of."

Teevens, surrounded by a
smorgasbord of players, assistant
coaches, and family, delivered a
tearful apology to "my players,
family, alumni, students, faculty,
and friends of Stanford Universi
ty"«
"I admit making mistakes and
at times inappropriate behavior,
but I also ask for your forgiveness .
. . I don't think the punishment
fits the crime. I strongly feel that I
was the man that could have put
this behind us. I think [President
Hennessy] is making a mistake. "
Quarterbacks Kyle Matter,
Chris Lewis, and Trent Edwards
all came to the aid of their fallen
coach, each with a similar message
of "I'm the No. 1 QB, and, oh
yeah, Buddy, I got much love for
you, dog."
Sharing similar sentiments
once solely reserved fora ca
nine-like marijuana-smoking
West Coast rapper, the Band,
with the help of the Yell Leaders
on lead vocals, sang a rendition
of "My Buddy." A collective, dis
appointed sigh was heard as the
impromptu group delved into
an encore of "Kid Sister," re
minding the audience of those
unlovable plush toys from yes
teryear.
Disregarding journalistic objec
tivity, this writer feels he must in
terject his own views here on the

rash of recent firings in the colle
giate coaching ranks.
I first want to say that this whole
hubbub, much like the lack of a
grocery store on campus, is just
plain ridiculous.
If you are like 90 percent of
Stanford and don't know about
what's been going on in collegiate
coaching, let me educate you.
There have been two incidents
in the past week of high-profile
coaches engaged in questionable
behavior that got them removed
from office. First was lowa State
men's basketball coach Larry Eu
stachy, when pictures of him at a
Missouri house party boozin' it up
and kissing 19-year-olds surfaced
in lowa. Eustachy, the highest
paid public official in lowa (which
really tells you something about
the Midwest), recently resigned
with some severance pay.
Most recently, Alabama football
coach Mike Price was fired for at
tending a strip club. Reportedly, a
guest in his hotel room the next
morning ordered $1,000-worth of
room service. Price is married and
let's just say his wife wasn't the one
who was hungry.
While yes, I agree that these two
incidents show questionable be
havior from a collegiate coach who
is supposed to be a role model, I
heartily disagree that their behav
ior deserves a pink slip.
I'll start with Price. Riddle me
this: Is there a law against strip
clubs? Is there a law against a
grown man visiting strip clubs? Is
there anyone in Alabama who
hasn't been to a strip club? I think
not. While perhaps frowned upon
by the most righteous among us, it
would be a shame to condemn a
man who showed good behavior at
a place of business. Get over it.
And as for his "infidelity," it is
appalling that a school has the
right to delve into a man's person
al life with such audacity. I'm
going to go ahead and argue that
someone's sex life has very little to
do with their performance as a
football coach.
As for Eustachy, it's a bit more
complicated. He has admitted
that be is an alcoholic and that he
has begun his own road to recov
ery.
There is no doubt in my mind
that his players and school would
have rallied around him after his
recovery. Basically, I just hate to
see someone kicked while he's
down.
If there is one thing that Amer
