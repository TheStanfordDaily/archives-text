### MICHAEL O'BANION 
Since being shutout at home by
Santa Clara a week ago, the No. 7
Stanford baseball team (32-14, 13-
5) has rebounded quite nicely.

Baseball
Tuesday: No. 7 Stanford 3, San Jose
State 0

After sweeping USC over the
weekend, the Cardinal was on the
opposite end of a shutout last
night, blanking San Jose State 3-0
on the road.
Stanford, which owns a one
and-a-half game lead over Arizona
State in the Pac-1() standings, is
now in the midst of a four-game
winning streak heading into this

weekend's series at California.
Willi just six conference games
to play, the Cardinal has seeming
ly picked a good time to get hot.
While the Stanford bats did
most of the damage at USC over
the weekend to the tune of 38
runs, pitching was the difference
last night, as the Cardinal staff fol
lowed up two strong perfor
mances at USC to earn its third
shutout of the year.
Seven Cardinal pitchers com
bined to limit the Spartans to just
four hits. Senior Tim Cunning
ham had a very promising start in
his effort to come back from in
jury, facing only 10 batters in three
innings and giving up no hits.


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Tim Cunningham pitched three scoreless innings to earn his first win
since Jan. 26 and No. 7 Stanford extended its road win streak to 11 games
with a 3-0 shutout at San Jose State.
"Both pitching staffs did a great
tonight, and it was a well-played
game," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "That was the best out
ing Tim Cunningham has had
since he returned from his injury

and everybody pitched well."
Cunningham's infrequent
starts this season since breaking a
finger in his throwing hand have
been marked by a lack of control.
He averaged close to two walks
per inning in his previous three
starts but last night appeared to
have regained the form that made
him a 10-game winner a year ago,
walking only one batter and pick

ing up his first win since Jan. 26.
"Today was a step in the right
direction for me,"Cunningham
said.
Stanford wasted no time getting
the only run it would need on an
RBI single by junior Carlos
Quentin in the top of the first in
ning.
On another promising note,
sophomore Chris Carter earned a

start at designated hitter last night
and responded with a single and
an RBI. Like Cunningham, Carter
has seen limited action this year
due to injury.
Senior Ryan McCally picked up
his second save of the season by
striking out the only batter he
faced in the bottom of the ninth.
Sophomore Danny Putnam
added two hits and an RBI for the

Cardinal.
Quentin was named one of five
finalists for the 2003 Golden
Spikes Award, given annually to
the top amateur baseball player.
The veteran rightfielder be
came the 10th Cardinal to be
named a finalist for the award,
which will be announced on July
15 in conjunction with the 2003
Major League Baseball All-Star

Game.
The injury-plagued Cardinal
team seems to be returning to
health rather nicely with the
strong pitching performances of
junior Drew Ehrlich and sopho
more Billy Paganetti, who each
threw an inning of scoreless work
after spending weeks on the
bench nursing their arms back to
health.
Since being shutout at home by
Santa Clara a week ago, the No. 7
Stanford baseball team (32-14, 13-
