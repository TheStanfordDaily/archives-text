Since being shutout at home by
Santa Clara a week ago, the No. 7
Stanford baseball team (32-14, 13-
5) has rebounded quite nicely.

Baseball
Tuesday: No. 7 Stanford 3, San Jose
State 0

After sweeping USC over the
weekend, the Cardinal was on the
opposite end of a shutout last
night, blanking San Jose State 3-0
on the road.
Stanford, which owns a one
and-a-half game lead over Arizona
State in the Pac-1() standings, is
now in the midst of a four-game
winning streak heading into this

weekend's series at California.
Willi just six conference games
to play, the Cardinal has seeming
ly picked a good time to get hot.
While the Stanford bats did
most of the damage at USC over
the weekend to the tune of 38
runs, pitching was the difference
last night, as the Cardinal staff fol
lowed up two strong perfor
mances at USC to earn its third
shutout of the year.
Seven Cardinal pitchers com
bined to limit the Spartans to just
four hits. Senior Tim Cunning
ham had a very promising start in
his effort to come back from in
jury, facing only 10 batters in three
innings and giving up no hits.

Senior Tim Cunningham pitched three scoreless innings to earn his first win
since Jan. 26 and No. 7 Stanford extended its road win streak to 11 games
with a 3-0 shutout at San Jose State.
