Tuesday: No. 17 Stanford 1, San Jose
State 0 (Game 1)
Stanford 4, San Jose State 2 (Game 2)

The Cardinal earned a bit of re
venge from last season when the
Spartans split a doubleheader be
tween the teams in San Jose. Last
night's games were a makeup of a
doubleheader originally scheduled
for April 16.
Stanford received strong pitch
ing performances from junior
Dana Sorensen and senior Tori
Nyberg, but the star of the night
was junior catcher Jessica Allister.
Allister drove in four of the five
Cardinal runs scored in the dou
bleheader, giving her sole posses
sion of the team lead in RBI at 38. .
Sorensen picked up her 18th
win of the season in the first game,
a 1 -0 Cardinal victory.
Stanford's lone run came in the
first inning. Sophomore outfielder
Katherine Hoffman opened the
game with a single and made her
way to third with two outs following
a stolen base and a fielder's choice

ground out. Allister then drove in
what would prove to be the decid
ing run with a single to right field.
The rest of the work in putting
away the victory was up to
Sorensen.
Sorensen struck out eight Spar
tans in six innings, while allowing
only four baserunners. Freshman
Laura Severson closed out the
game with a scoreless seventh in
ning.
The second game of the evening
was a similarly dramatic affair, as
the Cardinal came from behind to
win 4-2.
San Jose State took the lead in
the second thanks to some lack
adaisical Stanford defense. The
Spartans put runners on first and
second with none out with a single
followed by a hit batsman.
The Spartans' rightfielder
Courtney Lewis then dropped a
bunt that dribbled just a few feet in
front of the plate. Lewis reached
first thanks to an off-line throw and
picked up an RBI when the hard
charging runner from second base
went unnoticed by the Cardinal
and was able to cross the plate.
To make matters worse, the
runners still on base advanced to
second and third on the belated
throw to the plate.
Nyberg remained calm, howev
er, and induced three straight
groundouts to stifle the rally and
leave the inning with only a two

run deficit.
Stanford looked to have an an
swer in the bottom of the second
when senior Kira Ching blasted a
triple to the base of the center field
wall with one out, but the Spartans
retired the next two Cardinal bat
ters to strand Ching.
Ching would help put a run on
the board in the bottom fourth as
Stanford closed the gap to one with
a walk by Allister and singles by
Ching and senior Cassi Brangham.
The Cardinal bats stayed hot in
the bottom of the fifth. Junior Eliz
abeth Bendig and Hoffman sin
gled to open the inning. With one
out Brangham blooped the ball to
left field with what looked like it

would be hit to load the bases.
But pinch-runner Meghan
Sickler was forced to play it safe on
the lazy bloop and was forced out at
third base.
With two outs and the rally
seemingly losing steam, things
began to look grim for the Cardi
nal. But Allister rocketed the very
next pitch over the center field wall
to put the Cardinal up for good, 4-
2.
The win was Nyberg's 15th of
the season and Severson once
again pitched the seventh to earn
her second save of the day and
third of the season.
Stanford returns to action Fri
day afternoon in Corvallis, Ore.
