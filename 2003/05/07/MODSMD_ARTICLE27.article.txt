Next Major San Francisco Quake 'Inevitable'

According to the United State Geo
logical Survey, San Francisco has a
good chance at witnessing a major
earthquake sometime in the next 30
years. The study found a 62 percent
probability of a quake of magnitude
6.7 or higher and 80 to 96 percent
probability of an earthquake be
tween 6.0 and 6.6. "This is [a] very
high probability," said Paul Raisen-

berg, a seismologist and one of the investigators in
volved in the study. "It means that it is almost in
evitable that there will be such an earthquake." Prob
abilities were calculated using data accrued from cur
rent and historical geological tensions. The last major
earthquake to hit San Francisco was the 1989 Loma
Frieta quake, which resulted in 62 deaths — remark
ably low fora 7.1 earthquake — but caused $10 bil
lion in damage.
Mercury Anyone?
Today about half of the Earth will be able to witness
the passage of Mercury in front of the Sun. Such a
rare event is called a transit and is exclusive to Mer
cury and Venus. Venus' transit occurs twice a century
and Mercury's is approximately once every seven
years. During transit, the planet will appear as a black
dot in front of the sun. In the U.S. locations east of
Michigan will be able to witness the event —the West
Coast will be left out. If you are planning to watch
Mercury's transit, astronomers recommend not look
ing directly at the sun but projecting its image onto a
lightly colored surface.

Quorn Can Make You Sick
More than 550 Americans and Britons have become
sick after eating Quorn, which is a meat substitute
made from vat-grown fungus. Despite being adver
tised as having mushroom origins, Quorn is made
from mold. Reported symptoms include nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. The Food and Drug Admin
istration, which has been investigating Quorn, has
found an adverse reaction rate of 5 percent, which is
much higher than the 0.001 percent claimed by the
manufacturer. A letter from a consumer safety group
has urged the FDA to order Quorn be removed from
the market.
Earth Getting Even Hotter
Speaking of global warming, of the hottest 10 years
in record, all have occurred in the past 16 years.
Global warming, arguably a product of the green
house effect, is the result of carbon dioxide released
into the atmosphere. Scientists have been debating
whether the greenhouse effect is man-made or one
of Earth's natural cycles. One thing is for certain:
Global weather has been getting hotter. Recently, a
panel of experts predicted that global temperatures
will rise as much as two degrees Celsius within 25
years and possibly 6 degrees by the year 2100. This
would trigger planetary havoc — ice caps will melt,
sea levels will rise, coasts will be flooded and ecosys
tems will be disrupted. Now that you are (rightfully)
worried, something as seemingly insignificant as
turning off the light can help. Studies suggest that a
100-watt light bulb left on for 10 hours causes 1.1 kg
of carbon dioxide to be released in the atmosphere.
If 50 million American households replaced two
100-watt bulbs with 18-watt fluorescent lamps, we
could prevent the release of 150 million tons of car
bon dioxide every year!
Longest Half-Life Measured
French physicists have measured a radioactive life for
bismuth-209 of over 2 billion billion years, the longest
fora natural element. Half-life is the number of years
it takes for half of the amount of a radioactive element
to decay into another element. They found that bis
muth emitted alpha particles (helium nuclei) and de
cayed into thallium-205. Bismuth-209 is thought to be
the heaviest stable isotope in nature.
Stanford Research Expo Showcases Ph.D. Work
On Thursday, April 24 graduate students held a Re
search Expo and Reception at the Arrillaga Alumni
Center. Seventy-three students presented their
Ph.D. research, with topics such as improving fiber
optics by parameterizing amplification, creating bio
magnetic sensors for detecting DNA fragments and
an atomic-scale investigation of hydrogen atoms on a
nickel surface. Aside from a showcase of research, the
event was intended to help prospective students
learn more about research opportunities available on
campus. Another major research conference coming
up is the Biomedical Computation @ Stanford
(BGATS) in October.
