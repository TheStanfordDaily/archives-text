# Creating an underwater world on a computer screen:
## The
						Science Behind Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the animators and computer
scientists at Pixar began work on their
latest movie, "Finding Nemo," they
found themselves spending a lot of
time in the bathroom.
Their challenge: to simulate the

complex ebbs and flows of moving
water on a computer screen.
For Pixar Animation Studios — the
creator of "Toy Story," "A Bug's Life"
and "Monster's Inc." — the movie is its
first attempt at creating a believable
computer-generated underwater envi
ronment, complete with fish, whales
and surfing turtles.

"One of the trickiest things to do is
to develop a vocabulary to describe a
splash," says Oren Jacob, the film's su
pervising technical director. "We start
ed by going to the bathroom and flush
ing the toilet a lot."
The story follows the adventure of
two fish, Marlin and his son, Nemo,
who become separated in the Great
Barrier Reef when Nemo was trans
planted from the sea into a fish tank in
a dentist's office overlooking Sydney
Harbor.
Creating a world where fish swim
convincingly and splashes look realistic
presented artistic and computational
challenges to the team of animators
and computer scientists.
Jacob, an engineering graduate
from UC-Berkeley, says that the
physics of water surface tension, gravi
ty and viscosity make it a very complex
physical phenomenon to model using
a computer.
"It's not just about making water
splash, but to make it splash the way the
director wants it to splash," says Jacob.
"To be able to direct those things is
where it gets very tricky."
After graduating from the bath
room, the team made field trips to
Point Reyes, accompanied by oceanog
raphers, geologists and computational
fluid dynamics professors to observe
life in the ocean. The team also made a
half-week diving trip to the Kona coast
of Hawaii. One of the tasks for the trip
was to develop a workable vocabulary
to describe the complex math and
physics of different types of splashes.
To model the movements of indi
vidual fish in the movie, the team ana
lyzed hours of video footage of fish
swimming under controlled condi
tions.
It was "graduate level research to
staring at fish in a tank," says Jacob, re
ferring to the specially installed fish
tank in Pixar's lobby, which the anima
tors used for inspiration. In addition to
this research, the team observed how
others had animated fish by watching
films such as "The Little Mermaid,"
"Pinocchio" and "Fantasia."
A Stanford computer science gradu
ate, Lisa Forssell, helped create some of
most complex scenes in the movie.

Forssell supervised the "ocean unit,"
which created all footage shot in open
water.
Forssell graduated from Stanford in
1992, staying to complete a master's
degree in 1994. She enrolled in the
computer science Ph.D. program, but
dropped out to work at Pixar. She has
been at Pixar for eight years and
worked previously on the "Toy Story"
movies and"A Bug's Life."
In a particularly challenging scene,
Forssell describes the two main charac
ters encountering a forest of jellyfish.
The scene is technically challenging
because jellyfish are semi-transparent,
she says. "We had a handful of see
through things before [in past Pixar
movies], but we weren't focused on
them," she says. Part of the challenge
with jellyfish is that they are semi-trans
parent, so objects and other jellyfish be
hind them need to look blurred.
The scene was also a cinematic chal
lenge: Unlike in land environments
where characters are constrained by
floors and objects, in the open sea
everything is moving and changing
constantly.
While Forssell says that these are
not entirely new challenges in comput
er graphics, they require a lot of
painstaking work. "It wasn't a question
of inventing a whole new algorithm,
but we had to do it in a reasonable
amount of time," she says.
In computer animation, not only
does it take a long time to create sets,
colors, character movement and light
ing for complex scenes, but they also
take longer to render — the process of
translating all the information in the
animation files that make up a shot into
a single frame of film. Pixar's Render
farm, a vast computer system, com
putes and creates each of the final 1/24
of a second shots, which each take
around six hours to render.
The Renderfarm used for "Finding
Nemo" had the same computing
power as the system used in Pixar's
previous movie, "Monsters Inc.," ac
cording to Jacob. It is his job as techni
cal director to set priorities on who gets
to use the Renderfarm's computing
