# Fun in the sun?
## Too much exposure, too little protection 
### 
With the summer months
fast approaching, young
adults are no doubt sali
vating at the prospect of
sun, sea and .. . skin protection? Ac
cording to a recent survey by the
American Academy of Dermatology
(AAD), nothing could be further from

the truth.
Somewhat worry
ingly, only 34 percent
of young people
under 25 — the age
group sun protection
is most important for
preventing future
cancers — say they
use sunscreen regu
larly. Moreover, the

results show a 15 percent drop since
1996, suggesting that young people
are increasingly unlikely to heed warn
ings against overexposure to the sun.
"There is clearly a disconnect," said
Dr. Darrell Rigel, a dermatologist at the
New York University Medical ("enter.
"The message is out there that sun is
bad for you, but people still think they
look better and healthier with a tan."
Speaking last week at an AAD press
conference, Rigel made his remarks
prior to the 2003 Melanoma/Skin
Cancer Detection and Prevention
Month, which began Monday.
Melanoma, the most deadly form of
skin cancer, can appear anywhere on
the body and up to 20 years after sun
exposure. This delayed reaction un
fortunately lessens the potential threat
in the minds of young people.
"They're not going to get skin can
cer until they're 50 or 60, and when
you're 16, you're not worried about

what's going to happen when you're
60 .. . kids feel immortal," Rigel said.
Dr. Susan Swetter, director of the
Pigmented Lesion and Cutaneous
Melanomic Clinic at Stanford, attrib
uted much of the problem to cultural
trends in fashion, which can leave mid
drifts bare and skin exposed to the
damaging effects of the sun. Also prob
lematic are perceived notions of
tanned skin as "healthy."
"All the celebrities today have nice
tans," Swetter said. "Whether they are
using artificial tans or not, young peo
ple are being given the impression that
tanned skin is good."
For those who believe tanning sa
lons offer a safer alternative, it may be
wise to think again. According to Swet
ter, many tanning beds have a high
wave UVA light, are not regulated by
the Food and Drug Administration,
can cause damage to the skin and per
manent damage to the eyes, contribut
ing to cataracts and eyelid cancers.
"There is no safe tan that individu
als can get," Swetter added. "That is a
fallacy."
According to the AAD, use of tan
ning salons by those under the age of
25 has risen dramatically, from eight
percent in 1996 to 26 percent in 2003.
Statistics also show that women use sa
lons far more than men.
These findings are of concern in
light of the fact that skin cancer is ris
ing, Rigel said.
"This is the only major cancer that is
still increasing, with incidence increas
ing at 6 percent a year and the death
rate rising 2 percent annually," he said.

More worrying still, it is estimat
ed that people get up to 80 percent
of their sun damage by the age of
20, Swetter explained. As such,
young adulthood is "the most cru
cial period for melanoma preven
tion efforts."
Melanoma generally begins as
an irregularly shaped blemish, no
larger than the size of a pencil eras

er. It can manifest itself in various
shades of tan, black, red, white or
blue and may bleed or itch.
Those who are light-skinned,
have a family history of
melanoma, who have been ex
posed to too much sun as a child
or teenager, or who have numer
ous moles, are at greater risk of
developing the disease.
The best way to protect your
skin is by staying out of the sun be
tween 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., wearing
protective clothing, such as long
pants, long-sleeved shirts, broad

brimmed hats and UV sunglasses,
as well as wearing sunscreen with a
sun-protection factor of 15 or
higher.
Stanford University Medical
Center's Dermatology Department
is offering free skin cancer screen
ing on Saturday May 10, from 9
a.m. to noon, at the Stanford
Health Library, located in Stanford
Shopping Center.
