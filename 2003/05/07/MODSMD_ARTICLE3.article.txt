# Former Athens mayor talks
## Avramopoulos discusses 2004 Olympic Games, globalism and U.S.-Europe relations 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Former Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos
highlighted the 2004 Olympic Games and a new
concept ot city diplomacy last night in a lecture to
a crowded Kresge Auditorium. The event, cospon
sored by the Stanford Classics Department and the
Alexander Onassis Foundation, stressed innova
tive plans to foster international cooperation.
In addition to Avramopoulos, the lecture, titled
"Athens: A Global City," was attended by former
Greek Ambassador to the United States and cur
rent Executive Director of the Onassis Founda
tion Loucas Tsilas, who had worked closely with

the mayor on the Olympic Bidding committee.
"The Onassis Foundation has spent $ 1 billion
in promoting humanistic value and Hellenistic
civilization," Tsilas said. "Hellenistic culture is an
integral part of the American way of life. It is West
ern culture, a common heritage."
Introducing Avramopoulos as a "rising star" in
Greek political life, Tsilas said, "He is a man com
mitted to our values. Athens is a difficult city, not
only due to environmental, economic and other
problems, but because it has a very heavy culture."
Avramopoulos served as the Athenian mayor
from 1995 to 2002. During his term, he pointed
out, the deficit shrunk, taxes were lowered, met
ropolitan infrastructure was improved and a new
institution of international mayors was born.
"In the past we tended to think globally but act
locally," Avramopoulos said. "But modern devel
opments in communication and transportation
have changed the world dimensionally.

Dimitris Avramopoulos, former mayor of Athens, spoke last
night to an enthusiastic Kresge Auditorium. His talk attracted
an audience largely composed of people with Greek heritage.
"Boundaries are yielding, and
more than ever, cities are becom
ing commercial, social and cultur
al centers."
Currently, 80 percent of the
world's population are city dwellers,
and according to Avramopoulos,
this demographic has demanded
transitions in political infrastructure
and challenged the traditional role
of managerial politics.
"When you consider Athens,
you need to address three things:

history, position and present,"
Avramopoulos said. "Right now,
Greece is still a hub of Mediter
ranean trade. The country was
just reborn during the last centu
ry when it gained its indepen
dence, and now Greece now holds
the presidency in the E.U."
According to Avramopoulos, it
is vital for Greece to remain
deeply involved in developing
peace, prosperity and stability
within southeastern Europe. Yet
this goal is subordinate to his larg
er cause in uniting the major
cities of the world in global part
nership. As mayor, he signed over
75 friendship pacts in other world

capitals, from Havana to Beijing.
"It is my strong belief that cities
play a vital role in international
diplomacy," Avramopoulos said.
"It is the mobilization of cities on a
global level which will most direct
ly serve the citizens.
"Globalization can be viewed as
an opportunity if we put citizens back
in the center," he added. "Peace can
be built from the bottom up."
Athens will be hosting the first
Olympic games of the new millen
nium, which has increased both
social and political pressure.
"It is true that the experience of
organizing the games is unique for
every city," Avramopoulos said.

"But wherever we dig, we find at
least three levels of civilization,
which makes it difficult. The coor
dination requires all different lev
els of administration to cooperate.
"Now it's on track and every
thing will be ready in time," he con
tinued. "We're doing it in the Greek
tradition — all at the last minute."
An audience member asked
Avramopoulos his opinion of the
current situation in Iraq and how
it feeds into his hopes fora metro
politan network of peace.
"I believe the U.S. should dis
engage as soon as possible, as well
as develop a new concept of its
mission," he said. "Right now they

need to pledge full support to de
mocratization and good relations
with Europe especially."
Avramopoulos stressed these
goals as common to both global
and local conflicts alike. Referring
to this mentality as a "glocal" atti
tude, he said that multilateralism
and egalitarianism will become es
sential in the future.
"The divided nations of the
past are coming together to devel
op a united vision of the world we
all can fight for," Avramopoulos
said. "This planet is heading to
ward global democracy, and man
must build new institutions, but
cities will always be there."

"I believe the U.S. should dis
engage as soon as possible, as well
as develop a new concept of its
mission," he said. "Right now they

need to pledge full support to de
mocratization and good relations
with Europe especially."
Avramopoulos stressed these
goals as common to both global
and local conflicts alike. Referring
to this mentality as a "glocal" atti
tude, he said that multilateralism
and egalitarianism will become es
sential in the future.
"The divided nations of the
past are coming together to devel
op a united vision of the world we
all can fight for," Avramopoulos
said. "This planet is heading to
ward global democracy, and man
must build new institutions, but
cities will always be there."
