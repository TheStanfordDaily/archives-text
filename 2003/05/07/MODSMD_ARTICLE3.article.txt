### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Former Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos
highlighted the 2004 Olympic Games and a new
concept ot city diplomacy last night in a lecture to
a crowded Kresge Auditorium. The event, cospon
sored by the Stanford Classics Department and the
Alexander Onassis Foundation, stressed innova
tive plans to foster international cooperation.
In addition to Avramopoulos, the lecture, titled
"Athens: A Global City," was attended by former
Greek Ambassador to the United States and cur
rent Executive Director of the Onassis Founda
tion Loucas Tsilas, who had worked closely with

the mayor on the Olympic Bidding committee.
"The Onassis Foundation has spent $ 1 billion
in promoting humanistic value and Hellenistic
civilization," Tsilas said. "Hellenistic culture is an
integral part of the American way of life. It is West
ern culture, a common heritage."
Introducing Avramopoulos as a "rising star" in
Greek political life, Tsilas said, "He is a man com
mitted to our values. Athens is a difficult city, not
only due to environmental, economic and other
problems, but because it has a very heavy culture."
Avramopoulos served as the Athenian mayor
from 1995 to 2002. During his term, he pointed
out, the deficit shrunk, taxes were lowered, met
ropolitan infrastructure was improved and a new
institution of international mayors was born.
"In the past we tended to think globally but act
locally," Avramopoulos said. "But modern devel
opments in communication and transportation
have changed the world dimensionally.
