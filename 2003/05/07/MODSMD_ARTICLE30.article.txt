# Iventure's David speaks up
## New technology firm takes on the big guys 
### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
In the technology version of David
versus Goliath, you don't need a
slingshot and a stone, Paul Mercer
discovered. Just have your small
company run circles around huge,
lumbering competitors and the gi
ants of computing will fall down on
their own.
A veteran of both Apple Computer
and a previous start-up called Pixo,
Mercer's most recent venture is called
Iventure. As the company is so new,
Mercer said the current name is a
"working title." In Iventure, there are
"three guys in a little office," Mercer
said. "[lt] is a little bootstrap organiza
tion."
Iventure may be small, but Mercer
is hoping the company will be able to
provide software for the growing
hand-held wireless device market.
This software market is one Mercer be
lieves larger companies, such as Apple,
have overlooked.
"We're way ahead of the market,"
Mercer said. "There's an inability for
the incumbent players to deliver the
software."
The threat of small organizations
with the mobility to take over niche
markets is nothing new. IBM expe
rienced the threat of small compa
nies at the dawn of the personal
computer when the technology
giant was too focused on hulking
giant computers and nearly missed
the PC revolution.
In Mercer's personal experience,
the same model has held true. Small
teams with a vision, and the mobility to
execute that vision, can create prod
ucts ready for the market place much

faster than large groups can operate.
A prime example of how the mo
bility of a small group can function
comes directly from Mercer's past. In
1991, when Mercer worked there,
Apple had two groups working on a
handheld Apple computer. Over 100
people, divided equally between
hardware and software, had been
working on the mini computer called
Newton since the late 80s.
They had managed to produce a
wooden model with plastic film fora
screen. Without widely publicizing
the information, Mercer formed a
team of three people to attack the
same problem. In a year they had a
working prototype, called the Swatch,
that Mercer presented to the Apple
board of directors.
"I hadn't briefed any of the rest of
the company," Mercer said. He
brought out the original prototype,
bright yellow and the size of a paper
back book, to show. "This actually
turned on and made a happy little
chirp. The room went crazy, everyone
wanted to play with it."
Instead of heralding the ability of
small units of engineers to advance
technology rapidly and at low cost,
Apple convinced Mercer to join the
Newton group. Dissatisfied with the
bureaucracy, Mercer ultimately struck
out on his own.
"This is really the blind spot for the
entire business," he said. "These com
panies cannot execute fast enough."
Confidenl in the abilities of Iven
ture to move quickly and produce soft
ware for new devices well ahead of
other large, well-funded research and
development teams, Mercer said his
start-up is positioned to ride the wave
of the new economy.
"You'll see little companies break
ing in because the economy is shifting
that way," Mercer explained. "It really
is inevitable."
