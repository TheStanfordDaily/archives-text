Last year, NASA's TRACE spececraft captured images of dark features resembling Earth-sized tadpoles that
were seen swimming in the atmosphere of the sun following an enormous explosion. The explosion produced a
powerful X-class solar flare, packed with enough energy to match a billion one-megaton nuclear bombs. The
tadpoles are believed to be superheated magnetic voids at the surface of the sun.
