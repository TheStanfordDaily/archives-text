# Undergraduate Senate names new deputy chair
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Nicole Mazanitis was
elected ASSU Undergraduate Senate
deputy chair at last night's meeting.
Mazanitis, who served as a senate asso
ciate this past year, will shoulder re
sponsibilities such as organizing the
Senate associate program, standing in
for the Senate chair when he is unable
to fulfill his duties, and serving on the

legal council policy board.
"Introducing [the Senate associates]
to the Senate will be a great thing and I
really look forward to doing it,"
Mazanitis said.
The three other candidates were
Senators George Hill, Stanley Wilson
and Sandeep Wasan. Hill and Wasan
had also served as Senate associates. All
the candidates had suggestions on how
to improve the Senate associates pro
gram.

The Senate also discussed possible
avenues of funding for Full Moon on
the Quad in order to avoid the troubles
incurred earlier this year due to the ter
mination of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation's funding the event two years
ago. The Senior Class sponsored the
event two years ago, but the budget for
the Senior Class this year was tighter
than it was last year and it is seeking
funds from the ASSU to cover the costs.
Due to miscommunications, the

group's request was not processed until
now. The issue was sent to committee
for further discussion and it will come
to a decision next week.
Another issue that was postponed
for further examination and discussion
was the overexpenditures of Stanford
in Government, which requested a
transfer of funds to cover the $50 per
person spent for food on former Attor-
ney General Janet Reno and 50
students and community mem
bers during Reno's recent visit to
campus. Fifty dollars per person is
exorbitant compared to what is al
lowable for special fee groups by
ASSU rules.
The Nominations Committee
brought a bill to approve their
nominations of students to serve
on University and Board of
Trustee Committees, which the
Senate approved.
"It was a very competitive ap
plicant pool and deliberations
were not easy" said committee
Chair Hunter Hargraves, a
sophomore.
The Senate also confirmed
the appointments of the ASSU
president and vice president to
the 2003-2004 ASSU Executive
Cabinet.
