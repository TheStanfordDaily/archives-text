### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Itzolin Garcia, a doctoral candidate in
Spanish and Portuguese, passed away Fri
day morning in San Francisco. Garcia,
who was active in Stanford's Chicano com
munity, lived in the Mission district.
The San Francisco Police Department
would not release (he cause of Garcia's
death, and friends of Garcia declined to
comment out of respect for Garcia's family.
On Monday night, approximately 25
students who had known Garcia gathered
at El Gentro Chicano to mourn and re
member his life.
"People were really struck by his sin-

cerity and his hunger to
learn and to listen, as if
what you were saying at
that moment was the
most important thing,"
said Micaela Diaz-
Sanchez, a graduate stu
dent in drama. "It's been
hard fora lot of us who
were really close to him."

Despite being a graduate student and
commuting to school from the Mission,
Garcia was involved in campus life. In the
months prior to his death, he focused in
creasingly on artistic endeavors, said
Gabriela Rico, an undergraduate who first
met Garcia at a MEChA meeting in 2001.

"His art was really amazing," she said.
"He was working on a book of poetry and
artwork and hoped to get it published."
The son of parents actively involved in
the Chicano community in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, Garcia's academic and artis
tic endeavors reflected similar interests.
"Itzolin came from a family that was
very much involved with the Chicano
movement, and he brought that dedica
tion with him when he came to Stanford,"
said doctoral candidate Michelle Zamora.
"He was very rooted in that struggle as
an intellectual and an academic," Rico
said.

Diaz-Sanchez was a playmate
of Garcia's as a young child in Al
buquerque.
"Our parents all knew each
other as artists and activists," she
explainea. in the last year I
got to know him again ... he was
just the most amazing person."
Rico added, "A lot of people felt
very touched by him because he
was always willing to listen . . . He
became a confidant and a friend,
someone very generous."
The sudden loss of Garcia has
been a trial for those close to him,
who remember Garcia for his zest
for life and care for not only his
friends but for every individual.
Rico related a story about a
time she, Garcia and some friends
were headed to a conference in
San Jose when Garcia ran into a
gas station convenience store to
get some snacks.
"He was in there for 45 min
utes," she said. "It turns out he
was talking to the store clerk, who
was Japanese . . . asking them
about the language and their cul
ture. He was just very curious
about other people."
Garcia was a 1998 graduate of
Yale University and won an An
drew Mellon Fellowship in Hu
manistic Studies in 1999.
Today, in addition to a service
in Albuquerque, there will be a
memorial at 7:30 p.m. at Sullivan
Funeral, 2254 Market Street in
San Francisco.
