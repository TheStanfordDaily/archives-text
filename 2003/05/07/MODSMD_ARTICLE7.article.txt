# Profs discuss U.S. and U.N.

### FRANCES LEWIS 
The title of last night's Bursting the Bubble panel,
"Allies Divided: Post War U.S. / UN / World Rela
tions" certainly didn't limit the discussion, which
touched on issues ranging from World War II to
Afghanistan and the future of North Korea.
The panel consisted of Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin, Assoc. Political Science Prof, and Hoover Fellow
Michael McFaul and special guest Michele Griffin, ad
viser at the office of the Under-Secretary-General for
political affairs in the United Nations Secretariat.
Okin opened the talk by discussing the principle of
self-rule for every country.
"International law is based on the principle of a
state's right to sovereignty," she said, "except in the
case of self-defense or genocide [because] sovereign
ty is supposed to be respected by other countries."
She then began to read statements of the Bush ad
ministration's foreign policy that she deemed "con
tradictory."
"We expect all other countries to live in a world
where one country's military might clearly out num
bers their own, [but] we reserve the right to fight any
nation that tries to obtain military power that might
match or exceed our own," she said.
In regards to relations with U.S. allies in Europe,
she brought up what she perceived as a biased slant in
the American media.
"In all other parts of the world, the French and
German [anti-war] position was seen as far more rea
sonable," Okin said. She was unsure as to the reper
cussions this would have within NATO and the E.U.
