# Profs discuss U.S. and U.N.

### FRANCES LEWIS 
The title of last night's Bursting the Bubble panel,
"Allies Divided: Post War U.S. / UN / World Rela
tions" certainly didn't limit the discussion, which
touched on issues ranging from World War II to
Afghanistan and the future of North Korea.
The panel consisted of Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin, Assoc. Political Science Prof, and Hoover Fellow
Michael McFaul and special guest Michele Griffin, ad
viser at the office of the Under-Secretary-General for
political affairs in the United Nations Secretariat.
Okin opened the talk by discussing the principle of
self-rule for every country.
"International law is based on the principle of a
state's right to sovereignty," she said, "except in the
case of self-defense or genocide [because] sovereign
ty is supposed to be respected by other countries."
She then began to read statements of the Bush ad
ministration's foreign policy that she deemed "con
tradictory."
"We expect all other countries to live in a world
where one country's military might clearly out num
bers their own, [but] we reserve the right to fight any
nation that tries to obtain military power that might
match or exceed our own," she said.
In regards to relations with U.S. allies in Europe,
she brought up what she perceived as a biased slant in
the American media.
"In all other parts of the world, the French and
German [anti-war] position was seen as far more rea
sonable," Okin said. She was unsure as to the reper
cussions this would have within NATO and the E.U.
However, Griffin did have an
opinion as to the future of the U.N.
and responded to accusations that
its actions leading up to the war
with Iraq would render it "irrele
vant."
"We will see relations begin to
settle back to a less passionate and
less heated state of affairs," she
said.
As for relations between the
U.S. and countries like France, she

said, "While the Iraq issue domi
nated headlines, it was by no
means the only issue France and
the U.S. have had to work togeth
er on on a day-to-day basis."
McFaul spoke last and generat
ed quite a response from the audi
ence. He emphasized the inconsis
tency of the Bush administration's
attempts to garner support for the
war. He called the tactic "bait and
switch."
"We go in there in the name of
weapons of mass destruction, but
once in there, baby, we ain't leav
ing until we get a regime change,"
he said.

During the question-and-an
swer session that followed, he was
peppered with heated questions
from members of the audience.
John Martin, who received his
doctorate from Stanford in 1988,
commented, "The U.S. does not
want a democracy in Iraq, they
want a Rumsfeld democracy."
McFaul's reply was, "How do
you know, have you polled Iraqi
citizens?"
A mini-debate ensued when
Martin asked for an opinion from
someone unaffiliated with the
Hoover Institution and McFaul
replied with outrage that his poli

cies were still aligned with the left
and that he was insulted at the
generalization of his politics as
right-wing.
Martin afterward commented
about his concern about the shift of
U.S. politics.
"Forty years ago, McFaul would
have been seen as a right-wing ex
tremist," Martin said. "These days,
he's a moderate."
Anthony Lee, a senior political
science major in the audience, was
largely supportive of McFaul's
words.
"It was inspirational the way he
challenged people to protest for

democracy in Afghanistan rather
than criticize [the Bush adminis
tration]," he said.
The panel was the last of the
year for Bursting the Bubble, a stu
dent group founded this year by
six students who met while attend
ing Sophomore College early last
fall.
"Tonight was like the pri
maries, not a general election,"
said founder Chloe Rothstein
about the opinionated nature of
the audience. "People who cared
turned out."
Bursting the Bubble plans to re
sume its discussion panels next fall.
