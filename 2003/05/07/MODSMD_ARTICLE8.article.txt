# Cantor exhibit tackles cultural definitions
## Idealizing the body 
### SARAH PAPÉ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In "Ideal Figure," a new exhibition at
the Cantor Center for the Visual Arts, art
and media come together to pose ques
tions about the various cultures' defini
tions of physical beauty — and rather
than providing answers, the exhibit leaves
individuals with the task of answering the
question themselves.
The exhibition, which opens today
and runs through Aug. 17, centers
around five sculptures from five different
parts of the world that date from antiqui
ty to modernity. The sculptures,
arranged in a circle, are conversing with
one another about their various ideal fig
ures. A spotlight in the middle of the cir
cle invites people viewing the exhibition
to step inside the circle and become a part
of the conversation.
"This is very experimental and very
exciting," said exhibition co-organizer
Lauren Silver, associate curator for edu
cation at Cantor. "We want to really en
gage people and not tell them what the
ideal is."
The exhibition is a collaborative effort
between all the curators at the museum to
highlight various items from the collec
tion, but also to unite the different works
of art in the museum in presenting a
cross-cultural perspective on ideals of
physical beauty.
Silver hopes people will take the ques
tions posed in this exhibit and ask them of
other pieces of art as well. Throughout
Cantor, observations by the public about
specific objects have been added to the
displays.
"The exhibit is interactive and partici
patory," Silver said, emphasizing the
heavy educational component of the ex
hibit. "We want to generate discussion of
what the ideal is."
A coffee table and chairs in one corner
of the gallery invite people to sit down
and discuss the ideas offered by the dif
ferent elements in the exhibition. On the
wall next to the table, people can write
down their thoughts on sticky notes for
others to read.
In addition to the sculptures, the ex
hibit features a magazine rack full of cross
cultural periodicals such as Fitness, Shape,

Weightlifting USA, Marie Claire, People
En Espanol, American Photo — all placed
with the intention of contributing to the
discussion on the ideal.
"There is no absolute ideal," said
Manuel Jordan Perez, Cantor's curator of
arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
"There is lots of freedom within the
gallery to think."
Next to the magazines is a couch and a
television, featuring a documentary
made by a professor in the Communica
tion Department and another documen
tary by two students in the documentary
film program.
Quotes pulled from different books,
ranging from medicine to social science to
popular culture, are placed around the
gallery to generate more questions of
physical beauty across cultures.
"We want to saturate the exhibition
with images just like your everyday life is
saturated," Silver said. "The exhibit is flex
ible and accessible. You can take it in the
way you want to take it in."
Silver hopes that when faced with the
various images of beauty in this setting,
people will re-evaluate their definition of
what the ideal figure is.
Jordan Perez added that while the
sculptures are the centerpiece, the maga
zine racks, the quotes and the video all
help people think about this idea and how
it can relate to them.
"The question here is how do we use art
to address contemporary issues," Jordan
Perez, said. "There are no labels explain
ing what is going on, there is simply a pres
ence in the gallery."
On Saturday, July 12 and Sunday,
July 13 at 2 p.m., Big Moves modern
dance ensemble will perform in the Can
tor auditorium and will hold a discussion
after the show. Big Moves is an organiza
tion dedicated to educating the public
about issues relating to body image and
size acceptance.
"We're excited to see what happens,"
Silver said. "This exhibition is different
than most in that the public is invited to in
teract and they will add to it."
The exhibition is funded by the
Halperin Exhibition Fund. The exhibit is
free to the public and is open Wednesday
to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., with extend
ed hours until 8 p.m. on Thursdays.
