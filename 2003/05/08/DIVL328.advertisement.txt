Toumai: The Earliest Hominid?
The new hominid, Sahelanthropus tchadensis, nicknamed Toumai, recovered by Michel
Brunet's team in the Djurab desert of Chad has been dated biochronologically to nearly 7
million years ago. This hominid fossil displays unique combination of primitive and
derived characters that suggest it is a very early human ancestor, and probably temporal
ly close to the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. The geographic location
of Toumai, along with its great antiquity, suggests an early widespread hominid distribu
tion and a somewhat earlier chimpanzee-human divergence than previously indicated by
many molecular studies. Dr. Brunet's lecture will focus on Toumai and its implications for
human evolution.
