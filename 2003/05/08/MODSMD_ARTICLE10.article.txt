# Tornadoes leave 2 dead

### 
I)E SOTO, Mo. (AP) —Tornadoes
swept across the Midwest and South
overnight and early today, killing two peo
ple in Illinois and battering a region still try
ing to recover from deadly twisters that
struck over the weekend.
A junior high gymnasium in this com
munity 35 miles southwest of St. Louis was
destroyed in Tuesday night's twister but
25 young track athletes and their coaches
were spared because they had fled the
gym just in time.
"Chairs started flying. Everything start
ed shaking. It was scary," Travis Shores, 14,
said as he visited the ruins yesterday.
Said Grant Gannon, also 14: "I kept
hearing the wind, then there was a loud
boom like a bomb went off."
At least four tornadoes hit southern Illi
nois overnight, killing two people, injuring
at least 20 and destroying or damaging
scores of homes. In Mermet, the trailer of
Mariam Houchins, 65, was wrapped
around tree trunks; her body was found in
a ravine. Steve Kohn, 53, was killed in near
by Grand Chain.
Brenda Crockett of Mermet had climbed
out of her basement after the first tornado
struck and was surveying the rubble of her
house when she saw a second twister bear

ing down on her.
"There was nothing for me to do except
lie down and grab the grass," said Crockett,
who spent yesterday looking for family
photographs and other treasures to save.
Tornadoes also damaged more than a
dozen trailer homes northeast Mississippi
and Downsville, La., but no serious injuries
were reported. High wind and heavy rain
also hit parts of Arkansas and Alabama,
where officials closed schools and some
churches canceled midweek services.
In eastern Tennessee, which has been
drenched by rain since Sunday, flooding
forced Chattanooga residents to take emer
gency shelter as the Tennessee River rose to
ward its highest level in nearly 30 years. The
Tennessee Valley Authority said some 300
homes and other structures could be flood
ed and damages could reach $7 million.
"We've been through this before," said
Liz Foster, manager of a complex that emp
tied 64 downstairs apartments because of
the high water. "Can I cry?"
The heavy rain and wind had many in
Pierce City, Mo., hit hard by Sunday's tor
nadoes, fearing damaged historic buildings
would simply collapse.
"This we didn't need," Lawrence Coun
ty Sheriff Doug Seneker said.
