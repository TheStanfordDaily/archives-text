WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Senate's Republican
tax writers struck an agreement yesterday on a divi
dend tax cut, ensuring that a scaled-back version of
President Bush's call to eliminate such taxes entirely
for shareholders will win support in the Senate Fi
nance Committee.
The propositi combines elements favored by GOP
moderates and conservatives. Shareholders would
not pay taxes on the first $500 of dividend income.
Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-lowa said
that covers the 86 percent of taxpayers who receive

dividend income.
Shareholders with more than $500 in dividend in
come will get an additional percentage tax-free. For
roughly five years, an extra 10 percent will be tax
free. For the following five years, an extra 20 percent
will be tax-free.
The dividend tax cut will amount to roughly $80
billion over a decade. Its cost will be offset by $80 bil
lion to $85 billion in new revenue sources, Grassley
said. Lawmakers worked through yesterday evening
finishing details of the bill. The Finance Committee is

scheduled to vote on it today.
The redrafted dividend tax cut won support from
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who had forced Re
publicans to bargain fora smaller dividend tax cut. It
is still opposed by Democrats on the panel.
Senators didn't eliminate taxes on dividends with
in the outline of $350 billion in tax cuts over the com
ing decade. Conservatives who had made eliminating
dividend taxes entirely for shareholders their top pri
ority said they will support the smaller cut for now
but will try to reshape it during later debate.
