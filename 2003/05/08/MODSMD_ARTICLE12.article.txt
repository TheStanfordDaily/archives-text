## The

On a campus as wired as Stan
ford's, students, faculty and
administrators often receive
an overwhelming number of
e-mails every day. Along with personal
e-mails, class messages and announce
ments about campus events, Stanford
community members — like most e
mail users — also receive an unwanted
an highly annoying type of e-mail:
spam. But help may be on the horizon:
A new law proposed recently by Stan
ford Law Prof. Larry Lessig and Rep.
Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) would force ad
vertisers to label spam e-mails with a
subject header "ADV."
In recent years, spam has become in
creasingly prevalent, cluttering in-boxes
and tricking people with deceptive sub
ject lines. In March, approximately 45
percent of all e-mail sent was spam, ac
cording to Brightmail, a San Francisco

phone registry service will illustrate
whether federal efforts to clamp down
on unwanted advertising can be effec
tive.
On April 28, Lessig and Lofgren dis
cussed their new anti-spam proposal at
the Law School's weekly Cyberlaw discus
sion. The law would impose fines on com
panies that failed to place the "ADV" sub
ject header on their bulk mailings, and a
bounty totaling 20 percent of civil penal
ties would be offered to anyone who could
identify the spammer. In his talk, Lessig
felt so confident about the new law's po
tential that he proclaimed he would quit
his job if it didn't work out.
Several e-mail providers will soon
begin implementing this type of program:
AOL, Yahoo! and Microsoft have recendy
announced a joint initiative to fight spam
by marking the subject headers. The ini
tiative will be important in both protecting

January 2002, this
figure was just 16
percent. The Fed

mission recently
held a three-day
conference ad
dressing the prob
lem, responding to
the alarming in

received from com
plaining Internet
users. Two years
ago, the FTC re

have e-mail ac
counts through
these services and
serving as trial sys

lation.
The new law pro
posed by Lofgren
and Lessig is an im
portant first nation
wide step toward
helping consumers
recognize spam.
However, the prob
lem will not be
solved overnight.

ceived about 10,000 complaints per day.
Today, that number has increased to
nearly 130,000.
Consumers and organizations have
been persistendy trying to battle the bulk
mail for several years. Yet no method has
proven entirely effective. Spam-taggers
currendy available — such as Stanford's
Information and Technology Systems
and Services filtering program, imple
mented on Dec. 19 — sometimes mistak
enly tag non-spam e-mail, leading many
individuals to erroneously delete impor
tant messages.
Others, such as Sen. Charles Schumer,
(D-N.Y.), have put forward the idea fora
nationwide "do-not-spam" e-mail reg
istry. This e-mail registry would function
like the FTC phone registry that, when it
comes into effect this autumn, will block
unsolicited telemarketing calls. While re
ducing or eliminating junk e-mail will
pose different complexities, the FTC

The idea of the bounty is attractive, yet
companies could still send spam from
overseas, where federal laws would have
no jurisdiction. Moreover, advertisers are
resourceful and will find ways to avoid the
"ADV" designation if people start deleting
all e-mails that bear this tag.
The fight against spam will likely be a
long and arduous one that will require in
ternational legislation and several years of
careful lawmaking. Sustained efforts from
dedicated lawmakers and experts will be
essential throughout this process.
For now, we urge students, faculty
and Stanford community members to
continue to send complaints to the FTC
and to use spam guards in accounts of
fered through AOL, Yahoo! and Mi
crosoft and the Stanford e-mail system.
While these programs are not foolproof,
they will reduce the many headaches
and lost time associated with crammed
and messy in-boxes.
