High school students need prepared
teachers and high standards for writing
I was glad to see the editorial "The write
stuff?" (April 30) that mentioned the re
port of the College Board National Com
mission on Writing this week. Their em
phasis on more time for writing echoes the
findings of the History Research Paper
Study done last September, with funding
from the Albert Shanker Institute, for The
Concord Review by the Center for Survey
Research and Analysis at the University of
Connecticut. The report may be found at
www.tcr.org.
In addition to too little time, many teach
ers have not had experience with writing
long, serious academic research papers
themselves, and so are little prepared to give
students the coaching they need to develop
those skills for college, even if they had time.
High school students are capable of
truly exemplary academic writing if we
take the time with them and take care to set
good standards for them to meet.

man confusion and shaky self esteem, it is
refreshing to encounter two individuals so
resolutely convinced that they are better
than everyone else. Keep leading us to
ward the light.

Columnists should not have attacked
arts grants and protests
Kendall and Madjlessi's column "Bring
it on!" (May 5) poses as a clever and hu
morous remonstration, couched in face
tiousness, against the idea of the Universi
ty uselessly pouring money into f<x)tball to
win alumni donations. Though swathed in
slick rhetoric and lurid descriptions, the
column's content amounts to a fractured
