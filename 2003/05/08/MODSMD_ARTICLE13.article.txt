High school students need prepared
teachers and high standards for writing
I was glad to see the editorial "The write
stuff?" (April 30) that mentioned the re
port of the College Board National Com
mission on Writing this week. Their em
phasis on more time for writing echoes the
findings of the History Research Paper
Study done last September, with funding
from the Albert Shanker Institute, for The
Concord Review by the Center for Survey
Research and Analysis at the University of
Connecticut. The report may be found at
www.tcr.org.
In addition to too little time, many teach
ers have not had experience with writing
long, serious academic research papers
themselves, and so are little prepared to give
students the coaching they need to develop
those skills for college, even if they had time.
High school students are capable of
truly exemplary academic writing if we
take the time with them and take care to set
good standards for them to meet.

Kendall and Madjlessi
'refreshing'
In light of the recent attacks on Alexan
der Kendall and Elizabeth Madjlessi's col
umn "Bring it on!" (May 5), I would like to
come to their defense. On an editorial
page all-too-often rendered unbearable by
hackneyed, mawkish musings on fresh
man confusion and shaky self esteem, it is
refreshing to encounter two individuals so
resolutely convinced that they are better
than everyone else. Keep leading us to
ward the light.

Columnists should not have attacked
arts grants and protests
Kendall and Madjlessi's column "Bring
it on!" (May 5) poses as a clever and hu
morous remonstration, couched in face
tiousness, against the idea of the Universi
ty uselessly pouring money into f<x)tball to
win alumni donations. Though swathed in
slick rhetoric and lurid descriptions, the
column's content amounts to a fractured
menagerie of cheap potshots and
pointless putdowns.
The sources of complaint seem,
at first, to be primarily focused on
Stanford football — the coach,
the Band, the Yell Leaders and
the Dollies — which the colum
nists bash mercilessly, apparently
to make the point that the alumni
dollars funneled into football are
being wasted. But the point is lost
when they throw in unrelated
(and unfunny) jabs at too-easy tar
gets: anti-war protesters and the
ASSU's new arts grant program.
Both subjects are tender for many
students; both are methods of at
tempting to make a difference in a
situation hostile to change.

1 he direct positive effects of the
anti-war protests are, of course,
questionable. Nevertheless, the
least a protest tan do is make a
symbolic statement, apparently
strong enough to warrant these
columnists' poor jokes. And the
arts grant program, which pro
vides student artists with $15,000
of ASSU surplus funds, may not
change the future of student art at
Stanford, but it will at least allow a
handful of students to work on
projects with less of a financial bur
den.
Kendall and Madjlessi sacri
fice coherence and credibility
with their puerile attacks. The
real butt of their jokes — at least
for this reader — is the authors'
own respectability.
