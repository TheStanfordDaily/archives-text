# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Life's rains 
### 
Allow me to frame your
reference. The rain —
we all went through it
last week. The spring
threw us a curve ball. The rain
seeped through the zippers of our
backpacks, wet our homework and
ruined our chance to show our
bikini tans. Thankfully, that last
one wasn't really a problem for
me.
Right about now, I know you're
thinking: "Wait a minute, this kid
isn't going to write his damn col
umn about rain. I want sex or at
least something funny that I can
talk about with the TA I'm hitting
on." But another columnist wrote
about finding a reading spot on
campus, so I figure I can write
about the rain. Here goes.
Answer me seriously now: How
did the rain affect your psyche last
week? Did it rub you the wrong
way, or did you get past it?
Psychologists who subscribe to
the behaviorist school of thought
contend that our minds are noth
ing but black boxes. This means
that the effect of last week's rain on
your outlook is identical to the ef
fect it had when you were just a
child, scampering naked on the
coast of Cape Cod as Daddy
napped nearby.
Thankfully, the majority of con
temporary psychologists agree
that behaviorists are full of it. What
was it that caused some of your
drawmates to make it through the
seemingly endless storm of rain
last week while you sat in the stacks
of Green library curled up in the
fetal position?
Frame of reference, my friend.
We all go through the same expe
rience, but our experiences are far
from the same. An idiot could tell
you that, but how often do you re
ally think about it? When was the
last time a late-night conversation

with buddies allowed your mind to
contemplate something other than
supply and demand? When was
the last time you lifted your face
from life's endless to-do list?
When was the last time you re
membered that you really only
exist inside of your own mind?
When it comes down to it, hap
piness in this world — beginning
with happiness right now as a stu-

dent at
Stanford —is lit
tle more than
your outlook on
how things are
shaping up. We
all know that the
effects of money,
leadership posi
tions and fancy

cars are fleeting at best.
As graduation creeps ever clos
er, it seems to be metaphorically
raining on many of my close
friends who have been dry for
quite a while. Much of this down
pour comes a as a result of unsuc
cessful job searches, summer in
ternships included.
So how can we light life's rain?
Nothing is more damaging to
an ego than a crushing rejection
letter. For us seniors, it's even
worse. This ego has been fed since
we first received our Stanford ac
ceptance letters. Family members
praised us constantly. So why the
hell won't anyone hire some of us?
I mean, umm, I'm a Stanford stu
dent, which makes me in, umm,
the top 2 percent of the world, so
you should be throwing, umm, a
lot of money at me.
Shut up already. No one owes
us anything. The sooner we realize
this, the sooner we can start mak
ing a change. It's raining outside,
alright, so what are you going to
do?
Might as well put a raincoat

on — begin by changing your
frame of reference.
I first realized that my frame of
reference could change during my
sophomore year. First, I went
from living in Branner to drawing
1882 and living in a SLE dorm. In
the course of just three quarters,
many of the close friendships I had
developed my freshman year had
come crashing down, and I had
never felt more alone. This rain
propelled me to take a break from
both my major and my friends for
a year. When the sky had cleared
and I returned to campus, I decid
ed to change my major and started
building friendships again slowly.
Today, I am happy with both my
friends and my course of study.
My reference had changed.
My next realization took place
last summer in a lonely snow-cov
ered Indian village six hours from
the Chinese border. The course of
my travels had somehow led me
here in search of a snowboarding
resort, but instead I found myself
alone, without food, heat or trans
portation back to New Delhi. I had
discovered the meaning of Utter
Loneliness. In the heart of a cold
Himalayan night, I rekindled my
love for writing and produced a 40-
page story in just one night. The
story was terrible, but I couldn't
have been happier with myself. My
reference had changed.
Lastly, the murder of my gr eat
aunt last year brought more rain
splashing down into my life. It
wasn't her murder, per se, but the
shiveringly depressing time 1 spent
with my grandmother — her sister
— just a few days after. We
hugged, and she showed me the
picture of her sister as her hands
trembled. She tried to speak, but
could only cry. That night we

shared our support and love with
each other. And I've never lelt clos
er to a family member since then.
My reference had changed.
OK, let's recap: sophomore
slump, Himalayan night alone,
death in the family. So that brings
us to downpour number four: 6
percent unemployment in our na
tion. But in the end, 1 did find a

job. It's just rain after all, isn't it?
If I've learned anything from
these experiences, it's that storms
will always be here, but they always
clear up. We might as well realize
that if we're going to get wet, we
ought to put it in perspective, or at
least make the best of it.
So what will you do the next
time it rains? I hope we remember
that clouds are too high to touch,
but our minds are ours to manipu
late. Grab a raincoat.
