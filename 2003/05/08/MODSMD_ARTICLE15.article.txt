# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford social life on probation 
### LAUREN FRIEDMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
With the Draw and housing for next
year looming over all our heads, it is un
derstandable that there is buzz about the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon house possibly en
tering the Draw. I can understand that
some people might want to live in a house
that has been inhabited by fraternity boys
fora few years. Kind of. But to say that
making another house available to the
general community somehow gives
women and students a better chance at
nicer housing is wrong. The fraternity
houses on campus are definitely not any
more exclusive than the ethnic theme
houses, sororities or couple housing.
More than any other student organiza
tion on campus this year, SAfc has sus
tained social life on campus by throwing
numerous open-campus events under
safe conditions. The members of SAE,
should be commended for the incredible
effort they have put into maintaining the

condition of their house, participating in
community-wide service projects, and im
proving relations with other organiza
tions and offices on campus, like the Office
of Student Affairs, the Intersorority
Council and the Interfraternity Council.
To put it bluntly, the guys have sucked it
up and done everything they can to im
prove.
No one changes overnight: I think the
University administration has recognized
this fact by extending the housing proba
tion. One isolated incident cannot be the
criterion for judgment — there is always
going to be a mess-up or a mistake in an or
ganization. Within an entire fraternity,
which is rambunctious and defiant by na
ture, there are always going to be a few
members who do not respect the organi
zational integrity or reputation. More im
portantly, newly accepted members may
not realize the implications of their actions.
Asst. Director of Student Activities and
Fraternity Adviser Joey Greenwell did a
fantastic job in expressing to the 2003

Greek pledge class the enormity of the re
sponsibility it is to belong to a greek orga
nization. This is the first year that this fact
has been emphasized — it has not been so
clear in the past. There is immeasurable
responsibility involved in belonging to a
housed fraternity, but students must re
member that fraternity members are col
lege students, too. Remember when some
kid threw a chair through your dorm win
dow? Remember when someone stole
something from your dorm lounge?
These are issues with housing in
general — they are not unique to the fra
ternity houses. When Sophomore Suzy
breaks a window in Toyon because she is
drunk, it is unfortunately viewed differ
ently than when Fraternity Joe drunkenly
punches a hole in a wall.
Of course, the issue is not all about hous
ing. Its about alcohol abuse and hazing. Is
hazing acceptable? Most definitely not. Is
hazing what occurred? Who knows. That's
what the Organizational Conduct
Board is for, and what the Greek
Housing Review Board decides.
Students should let them do the
work and stop speculating. I think
the student body has a lot more to
figure out — like which fraternity is
going to step up and fill the party
vacuum that now exists.
Let's stop criticizing has-beens
and stop proposing could-haves,
and figure out what we can do
now. From an outside prospective,
what might or could have hap
pened in the SAE house in regard

to hazing is nothing compared to
what might and does occur among
Stanford athletic teams. Let's be
realistic — it we're going to start
now with the fraternities, athletic
teams should also fall under scruti
ny. Hazing exists not just in the
Greek community. Have you even
seen how hazing is being defined
these days? Pan Hellenic defines it
as "any action or situation with or
without consent which recklessly,
intentionally or unintentionally
endangers the mental or physical
health or safety of a student, or cre
ates risk of injury, or causes dis
comfort, embarrassment or ha
rassment." Let's be honest: By this
definition, almost everything stu
dents do could be considered haz
ing. It's how Stanford defines it

that matters to us. Where do we
draw the line? At what point do fun
and games turn into danger?
Again, let's hope that Stanford'sju
dicial process determines what is
best for all of us.
With all the hoopla about fra
ternities, probation and alcohol,
we might forget a few things. First,
have you ever been on another col
lege campus on a weekend? Fra
ternity parties are only for the fra
ternity members and members of a
sorority. No one else is invited, and
no one else is admitted into the fi
esta. Stanford is one of the few
schools at which fraternity parties
are relatively all-inclusive. Here is
a question for freshmen boys: Do
you think that you'd ever get into a
party at another campus? Think

again. The all-embracing Stanford
fraternity and row-house parties
are a rare phenomenon in modern
college life.
Campus-wide parties are great
because they foster a great sense of
community among students. They
also keep students from drinking
and driving — there's no need to
drive from the Row to Wilbur. Are
there other ways to have fun and
interact with other students with
out alcohol? Yes. But we have yet
to come up with other alternatives
that are successful. At some point,
we have to acquiesce to the fact that
college kids drink.
