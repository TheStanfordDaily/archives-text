## Fleshman excelling one stride at a time 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
As the Stanford track and field
squad heads into the champi
onship portion of the season, its
seniors will be in the final home
stretch of their collegiate careers.
And if history repeats itself, se
nior Lauren Fleshman will be in
the lead.
The two-time defending
champion of the outdoor 5,000
will be looking to win a remark
able third consecutive title and
lead the women's squad to its
first team championship ever.
"I love the thrill and challenge
of competition," Fleshman said.
"It's always great to know that
you are one of the main players
in a team's championship goals."
But Fleshman faces a very dif
ferent race this year than the last
two. Traditionally, collegians
run tactical races where they
maintain a strong but slow pace
for the majority of the race and
then kick hard in the last couple
laps. Recently, this has been
changing to all-out races.
"You've got to feel like you are
the fittest person at the starting
line," Fleshman said. "If you
aren't, you won't win."
Fleshman and teammate Ali
cia Craig learned this the hard
way at the Indoor National
Championships, where Flesh
man placed fourth, her lowest in
a collegiate 5,000 ever. Craig, a
redshirt freshman, placed third.
"You try to prepare mentally
for anything," Fleshman said.
"But I really thought it would be
a sit-and-kick race. I didn't know
the twins would push the pace
that hard from the start. I was le
gitimately beaten on that day by
three other people.
"It's exciting, though, because
I would love to see how fast I can
go. I would be extremely thrilled

to run 15 minutes, 7 seconds
even if I didn't win."
But Fleshman rebounded the
following day with a close run
ner-up Finish in the 3,000 and
helped the women to a sixth
place Finish as a team.
Fhe experience forced Flesh
man to rethink her training as
she prepares to defend her na
tional title. She has the chance to
become only the second woman
in history to win three consecu
tive championships in the 5,000.
In April at the Mt. San Anto
nio College Relays, Fleshman
avenged her loss to the indoor
national champion, Sara Gorton
of Colorado. In doing so, Flesh
man ran 15:23.94, a school and
Pacific-10 Conference record
and the third-fastest in-season
collegiate time ever.
"Mt. SAC is always a good indi
cator of your fitness," Fleshman
said. "We do mostly endurance
and aerobic stuff up to that point.
Then, after Mt. SAC, we focus on
speed and turnover to sharpen
for the end of the season."
Despite her incredible indi
vidual success on the track, it is
the team atmosphere that really
motivates Fleshman.
While a freshman in high
school, Fleshman began her run
ning career as a member of a
state championship cross coun
try team and chose Stanford in
large part because of its strong
distance team.
"I thought it would be best to
go to an environment where you
are pushed by your teammates,"
Fleshman said. "It's great to have
teammates like Alicia to train and
race with.
"We use that to our advan
tage. We don't get competitive
with each other."

Before turning her sights on professional running, senior Lauren Fleshman must look to win both
a Pacific-10 Conference championship and tfie NCAA title in the 5,000.
ing the Uig Meet, when three
Stanford women, including
Fleshman, jogged in and crossed
the finish line nearly simultane
ously fora sweep of the event.
As Fleshman moves on to pro
fessional running, she hopes to
carry some of that team experi
ence with her despite the individ
ual emphasis (hat elite runners
normally face.
Although her post-collegiate
plans are not finalized, Fleshman

recognizes how important find
ing a good training environment
is in helping her compete at the
international and Olympic level.
"Lauren has an innate enjoy
ment for athleticism," said Vin
Lananna, director of track and
field. "I am not sure where her
future will lead her, but I do
know that she will accomplish
her goals. That is the way she is.
"She runs because she likes to
compete and is not afraid of test
ing the limits."
ttut first, her attention must
turn to her final collegiate cham
pionships and the team goal of
winning the Pac-10 Champi

onship and an NCAA title. Flesh
man knows that the professional
circuit can wait.
"This is my final track season
in a Stanford uniform, and I
have a fantastic team with awe
some opportunities that most
World Champions probably
can't say they had the opportuni
ty to experience 01 be a part of
when they were in college.
"It would be a terrible mistake
for anyone to sacrifice experi
ences now in a hurry to reach the
next level."
Fleshman will be looking to
garner big points for the team at
Pac-lOs by doubling in the 1,500

and 5,000 but will focus solely on
winning the 5,000 for the Cardi
nal at the NCAA Championships
in Sacramento.
This weekend, Stanford will
host the Cardinal Qualifier to
give many athletes from around
the U.S. a final chance to qualify
for the NCAA Regional Champi
onships before conference action
gets underway.
While Fleshman and most of
the distance runners will rest, a
host of jumpers, throwers, and
sprinters are expected to repre
sent the Cardinal at the meet as
everyone sharpens for the Pac-10
Championships next weekend.
