### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Play will heat up on the Farm this weekend as
the Stanford women's tennis team begins its
quest fora third-consecutive NCAA title.
Two weeks after winning its 16th consecutive
Pacific-10 Conference championship, the Cardi
nal (20-1), ranked No. 1 nationally, will be the top
seed in the tournament and host two rounds on
its home courts. After the first two rounds at 16
local sites, the tournament will move to the Uni
versity of Florida for the concluding four rounds.

Women's Tennis
Friday: Michigan vs. Colorado, 10 a.m.
No. 1 Stanford vs. Louisiana-Monroe, 2 p.m.
Saturday: Michigan / Colorado winner vs. Stanford /
Louisiana-Monroe winner, 2:30 p.m.

The Cardinal will bring its regular-season
lineup to face the NCAA field, with freshman
Amber Liu at No. 1 singles, followed by junior
co-captain Lauren Barnikow, sophomore Erin
Burdette, freshman Alice Barnes, junior co-cap
tain Emilia Anderson and sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates.

In addition, Barnikow and Burdette will look
to continue their doubles dominance with sup
port from Barnes and Liu at No. 2 doubles and
Anderson and Tweedie-Yates at No. 3.
The Cardinal will begin play on Friday
against Louisiana-Monroe (20-3), while No. 42
Michigan (13-9) will meet No. 37 Colorado (14-
8). The two winners will compete on Saturday
fora chance to travel to Florida.
Louisiana-Monroe won an automatic bid by
winning the Southland Conference and is mak
ing its first NCAA appearance. Either Colorado
or Michigan will likely pose a greater challenge
to the Cardinal in the second round, as both
teams compete in major conferences (the Big 12
and the Big 10, respectively).
The fact that the first two rounds of the tour
nament will be played at theTaube Family Ten
nis Center will greatly aid a squad that has not
lost at home all season. In addition, the Cardinal
freshmen will be exposed to an NCAA tourna
ment environment while still playing on the
comfort of their home courts.
"It definitely changes, because all ofa sudden
you've got the NCAA banners up and stands
down on Court Five," said Stanford assistant
coach Frankie Brennan. "You definitely get the
feel that you're at the National Championships,
so it doesn't feel like just another dual match."
Flic team knows that homecourt familiarity
does not assure victory, though.
"The home court advantage is always nice be
cause you are in your comfort zone and have a
lot of support, but that can only take a team so
far," Liu said.
Added Barnes: "Not only will these teams have
nothing to lose, but they know that this is it — like
us, this is what they have been working for all year,
and we must respect that and be prepared.
"The main goal of course is to qualify for
Florida and hopefully play well while doing so."
After winning 18 straight matches and the
Pac-10 championship to conclude the season,
the Cardinal has spent the last week recovering
from the toils of conference play.
"You're not going to get much better between
now and this weekend," Brennan said. "What
you're going to do is maintain and keep muscle
memory intact — we'll work a lot on repetition,
but there is nothing drastic that we're going to
throw in."
Added head coach Lele Forood: "We've been
resting a lot, because we've had a lot of people

dinged up. This week has really
been kind of maintenance."
Although Stanford has won the
tournament the past two seasons,
this year will be a clean slate. Liu
and Barnes will be competing at the
NCAAs for the first time, while No.
2 seed Florida (24-2) will pose a stiff
challenge on its home courts.
"Personally, I don't even think
about the fact that we are defending
champions, because we are a totally
different team this year playing
against other new teams," Barnikow
said. "Our team mindset is that we
have to beat six teams to win NCAAs,
and that's what we will focus on."
Added Barnes: "It helps as a

freshman to know that I am on a
team with five NCAA champions,
so I know they know how to do it."
Considering Stanford's domi
nance during Pac-10 play, howev
er, the top seed was well-deserved.
The hard work of the Cardinal
was reflected in the Pac-10 confer
ence awards. Liu won First Team
All Pac-10 honors, and Barnikow
and Barnes were named to the Sec
ond Team, while Burdette was
picked as Honorable Mention.
I n addition, Liu was chosen as the
Freshman of the Year, and
Barnikow and Burdette were tabbed
as the Doubles Team of the Year.
Still, an NCAA championship
has been and st ill is t he ultimate sea
son goal for the team.
"Hopefully we will be the last
ones standing on the final day,"
Barnikow said.
