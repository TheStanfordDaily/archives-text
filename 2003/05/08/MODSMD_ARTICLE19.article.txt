# Risk, defeat go hand in hand
## 
### 
I had the distinct pleasure to spend last
weekend in Vancouver, British Columbia
(yes, that's in Canada), where I went to
compete in Regionals with the rest of the
Stanford Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team.
(We're called S.M.U.T., for short. Sorry, just
had to throw that in there.)
Anyway, we arrived just after the Canucks beat
the Wild in overtime. Now, considering the events
of last month, when my beloved Colorado

Avalanche were so ungraciously
ushered out of the playoffs by the
upstart Wild, I'm all for celebrat
ing their losses. Even if that means
I have to celebrate a Vancouver
victory.
Taking one for the team, you
know.
I love Canada, even with its
quirks. I love the loonie, the two-

nie, and the favorable exchange rate. I love fresh
salmon, 5 percent alcohol (by volume) glacier
beer, and Tim Horton's donuts. I love the ac
cents, the patches on backpacks and the übiqui
tous Roots clothing.
This time, however, the visit was somewhat
less than spectacular. For our trip up north to the
51st state was stopped short, with a loss to the
University of Oregon in the semifinals.
They will go on to Nationals in Austin with the
northwest region's only bid, and we will go
home.
(And yes, this column will now, for the first
time in it's history, get serious fora little bit.)
Going up to Vancouver, our team was slightly
favored. We knew were in fora battle, and were
certainly not expecting to breeze through the
weekend. I think we felt that if we played our
game, played well and caught a few breaks, vic
tory was a definite possibility.
We had the misfortune to run into another
highly talented team that, for one hour and 40
minutes, didn't make any mistakes. Call it bad
luck, chance, fate, whatever you will. Their
throws went just over our defenders, their bids
just got to the disc. It wasn't our day, it was theirs.
Defeat in sports, one can say, is common. It
happens everyday, and every game. There is a
winner and a loser. Half of the teams that play on
any day lose — it's a mathematical fact.
But a defeat in sports that ends a season —
that's a different beast altogether.

There is not one athlete, at
any level, who wants to end a
season with a loss. It is not the
memory that one wants to take
into the off-season, if there is
one. It is not the last experience
one wants to share with team
mates on the field.
I think this is especially true in
college sports, where you fre
quently live with the same people
you play sports with. My room
mate is also on the team. The Ul
timate team isn't just a group of
guys that I spend 15 hours a week
at practice with —it's a group of
guys with whom I spend 15 hours
a week at practice and countless
hours eating, drinking, laughing
and c basing girls.
Maybe this was amplified by
my feelings of being a senior
and leaving college in a little
K)ver a month. I didn't want the
♦last memory I had of playing
Jtliis great game with some of my
Reanimates who are leaving to be
•of the feeling I felt that rainy af
ternoon in Canada. Hut I think
iit's easy to get so caught up in
'the moments and activities that
we're in that we do not realize
how far along we are.
(Bear with me; I'm a nostal
gic senior.)
It's easy in sports — just like
in the rest of life — to forget to
take a pause and remember how
we got to where we are.

Hut this, I think, is what
keeps athletes going. It's the
feeling of loss and the desire to
replace it with something else
the feeling of victory. Having
tasted both, that's what makes
sports the joy they are. It's
knowing how bad losing feels
that makes victory so sweet. It's
remembering what it was like to
feel on top, and wanting to get
back there.
I don't think this is a feeling
confined to West ('.oast Ultimate
Frisbee, either — if I did, I
wouldn't be writing about it.
In sports, like in life, you have
to be willing to take risks to get
rewards. (See Mom and Dad, the
economics classes have paid off.)
And, as is the case with every
risk, there is the possibility that
things won't go according to
plan, that things won't turn out
as you would have liked or
would have hoped.
But does that mean that we
should avoid the risks in the
first place, that we should avoid
taking chances and putting
ourselves on the line? Hardly.
We should jump into the fray
and give it our best. We should
enter the arena and face the
opposition.
The credit, after all, belongs
to the man in the arena.
