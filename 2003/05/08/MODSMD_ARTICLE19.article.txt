# Risk, defeat go hand in hand
## 
### 
I had the distinct pleasure to spend last
weekend in Vancouver, British Columbia
(yes, that's in Canada), where I went to
compete in Regionals with the rest of the
Stanford Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team.
(We're called S.M.U.T., for short. Sorry, just
had to throw that in there.)
Anyway, we arrived just after the Canucks beat
the Wild in overtime. Now, considering the events
of last month, when my beloved Colorado

Avalanche were so ungraciously
ushered out of the playoffs by the
upstart Wild, I'm all for celebrat
ing their losses. Even if that means
I have to celebrate a Vancouver
victory.
Taking one for the team, you
know.
I love Canada, even with its
quirks. I love the loonie, the two-

nie, and the favorable exchange rate. I love fresh
salmon, 5 percent alcohol (by volume) glacier
beer, and Tim Horton's donuts. I love the ac
cents, the patches on backpacks and the übiqui
tous Roots clothing.
This time, however, the visit was somewhat
less than spectacular. For our trip up north to the
51st state was stopped short, with a loss to the
University of Oregon in the semifinals.
They will go on to Nationals in Austin with the
northwest region's only bid, and we will go
home.
(And yes, this column will now, for the first
time in it's history, get serious fora little bit.)
Going up to Vancouver, our team was slightly
favored. We knew were in fora battle, and were
certainly not expecting to breeze through the
weekend. I think we felt that if we played our
game, played well and caught a few breaks, vic
tory was a definite possibility.
We had the misfortune to run into another
highly talented team that, for one hour and 40
minutes, didn't make any mistakes. Call it bad
luck, chance, fate, whatever you will. Their
throws went just over our defenders, their bids
just got to the disc. It wasn't our day, it was theirs.
Defeat in sports, one can say, is common. It
happens everyday, and every game. There is a
winner and a loser. Half of the teams that play on
any day lose — it's a mathematical fact.
But a defeat in sports that ends a season —
that's a different beast altogether.
