# Festival marks Israeli independence
## Pro-Palestinian students respond with silent protest 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Amid wafting scents of falafel and the
sounds of Israeli dance music, about 200
people representing a dozen organizations
gathered in White Plaza at noon to cele
brate Israel Independence Day. The Coali
tion for Justice in Israel / Palestine, a pro-
Palestinian student group, held a silent
protest near the rally.
Yom Ha'atzmaut, the Hebrew name for
Israel Independence Day, commemorates
the May 1948 founding of the Israeli state
and is intended to be a festive occasion, in
marked contrast to Holocaust Remem
brance Week, which precedes it.
Yesterday's event exhibited this celebra
tory mood as Jewish students wearing blue
and white waved flags, sang songs and
browsed the goods and pamphlets offered
at booths sponsored by groups such as the
Stanford Israel Alliance, the Zionist Orga
nization of America, and Jews Indigenous
to the Middle East and North Africa.
"Only in the land of Israel do I feel whole
as a Jew," said law student Amichai Magen.

" I am proud to Wong to the only democra
cy in the Middle East. Yet our indepen
dence will not be complete until we achieve
comprehensive peace and security."
This reference to the violence in the
Middle East struck a chord, as the silent
protesters watched the Jewish celebrations.
Pro-Palestinian demonstrators wore black
and waved the Palestinian colors in mute
but nonetheless conspicuous protest. They
did not disrupt the planned activities but
handed out fliers and stood in front of signs
with messages such as "Middle East Peace
Requires Justice â€” End the Occupation."
"We're protesting a celebration of Is
rael's independence because Israel estab
lished itself as a Jewish suite in Palestine in
1948 by ethnically cleansing over 750,000
Palestinians, which is no reason for celebra
tion," said Yael Ben-Zvi, a graduate student
in cultural and social anthropology and
modern thought and literature. "We
would like to remind the Stanford commu
nity that when Israel says it wants peace, it
has to create the conditions for it first, by
ending the occupation of the Palestinian
territories it conquered in 1907 and by
bringing closure to the bleeding wound of
the 1948 ethnic cleansing.
"Israel's compliance with [these condi
tions) is the key to peace and prosperity for

all peoples in the Middle East. We want to
emphasize the urgent need to respect
human rights and equality for all."
The rally included a series of short
speeches, including ones by keynote speak
ers Yossi Amrani, consul general of Israel
for the Pacific-Northwest region, and Den
nis Prager, a nationally syndic ated radio talk
show host, author and theologian. Each
spoke positively about the meaning of Yom
Ha'atzmaut.
"This is one of the great days in world
history, one of the most optimistic in
human history," Prager said.
Not everyone in White Plaza yesterday
agreed with Prager's assertion.
"We feel like when they celebrate Israel's
independence, they are missing the point,
because it's not independence, its creating a
country over someone else's country," said
a protester who wished to remain anony
mous. "Any celebration should be joined by
remembering what came before the Pales
tinians were driven out of their homes."
Response to the protest was varied.
"I was pretty upset that there were peo
ple who don't believe in my country's right
to exist and that they came out when we
were not making a statement about any-
