# Flyers top BYU for NCAA title
## Lewis' historic upset 
### 
ROMEOVILLE, 111. (AP) —
Dude, Lewis University's volley
ball team isn't a bunch of tall,
blond California kids. They don't
have the cash or the fancy facili
ties like the big schools.
There's not even a beach in
sight of this tiny suburban Chica
go campus, where snowsuits are
fin more useful than swimsuits.
Yet here the Flyers are, cult
heroes going prime time after be
coming the first Division II team
ever to win a national collegiate
tournament.
just how big a deal is this?
Think "Hoosiers" with
kneepads.
"To be not only the first team
from the Midwest, but also the
first Division II team to win, that
just makes the story that much
better," said Ryan Stuntz, a sec
ond team Ail-American.
"You couldn't write it any bet
ter as far as a Cinderella story."
Fhe rest of the country agrees.
Since beating Brigham Young
for the title Saturday night in
Long Beach, Calif., the Flyers
have gotten hundreds of con
gratulatory e-mails and phone
calls — many from people they
don't even know.
And everyone wants a piece of
them. Hie players are trying to
cram interview requests in
among those pesky final exams.
They were honored guests at
Wrigley Field on Wednesday,
getting choice seats and an ova
tion when they were introduced
on the field before the game.
Fven Chicago Cubs manager
Dusty Baker came out to say
hello.
There's also talk about getting
a photo with President Bush.
"It's unbelievable," coach
Dave Denser said. "People that
weren't even volleyball fans or

didn't even know about Lewis
were drawn to the drama of it all.
"I think we made some fans
out of people."
Think of volleyball, and Divi
sion I schools in California come
to mind. UCLA, of course, with
its 18 national titles. Pepperdine.
Southern California. UC-Santa
Barbara.
In fact, before this year,
there'd been a California school
in every national championship
match since the NCAA tourna
ment began in 1970. And the title
went to a California school all but
four times.
But that's only part of what
makes story so appealing.
Because there are only 39 Di
vision I and 11 schools with men's
volleyball programs, the NCAA
allows competition between the
divisions. Fencing, rifle, women's
ice hockey, and men's and
women's gymnastics, skiing, and
water polo also have open tour
naments.
That means Lewis has to com
pete against behemoths like
UCLA. Or Ohio State, a rival in
the Midwest Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association.
Talk about an uneven playing
field.
"This sport is dominated by
Division I schools," said Stuntz,
from Redondo Beach, Calif., one
of only two California natives on
the 16-player team. "They com
bined the Division II schools to
get more teams. But they proba
bly thought they'll never really
have a chance to win."
How'd Lewis do it? The school
recruits internationally and goes
after U.S. players ignored by top
programs. The team features
players from Brazil, Mexico and
Puerto Rico, along with Ameri
cans looking to prove something.
