# Sunny NCAA Regional beckons Stanford
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The entire year boils down to this week for
(lie Stanford women's golf team as it travels to
Valley of the Sun in Tempe, Arizona for the
NCAA West Regional championship. The
three-day, 54-hole tournament begins today at
the Karsten Golf Course, and the event will be
hosted by Arizona Suite.
I he Cardinal is the seventh seed in a group of
21 at the Western Regional and will l<x)k to finish
somewhere in the top eight. At the tournament's
end, the top eight teams from each of the three re
gional competitions (Western, Central, Eastern)
will advance to the NCAA championships in West
Lafayette, fnd.
Stanford caught a break this week, as No. 6
Arizona and No. 8 California are playing in
other regional tournaments. However, earning
its 15th consecutive national championship
berth will not be easy.
The Cardinal will have to contend with three
teams (Pepperdine, Oklahoma State and South
ern California) ranked in Golfweek Magazine's
top five, and six teams in the top 25 overall.
No. 2 Pepperdine l<x>ks to l>e the favorite head
ing into this event, lhe Waves have been domi
nant this year, recording five consecutive tourna
ment victories entering this week's championship.
Pepperdine last foiled to win a tournament in
November and hasn't finished out of the top three
since the year's first event in September. Ilie
Waves' last outing was a romp at the West Coast
Conference Championships, where they cleared
second-place San Francisco by 10 shots.
No. 13 UCLAshould provide some competi
tion for Pepperdine. l he Bruins finished sec
ond in last year's Western Regional at the Stan
ford Golf Course and returned four of their five
starters this year, including eighth-ranked
Charlotte Mayorkas.

In the individual competition, the action
should be even more heated. Pepperdine's
Katherine Hull and Lindsey Wright are ranked
second and fourth in the country, respectively.
USC's Mikaela Parmlid is No. 3, and took sec
ond-place honors at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championship.
Stanford enters the Western Regional just
out of the top 25, officially No. 28, according to
Colfweek's updated rankings.
The Cardinal is led by its only senior, Kim
Rowton. Rowton has collected five top-10 fin
ishes this year, and her stroke average is the best
on the team.
Her solid play during the regular season
earned Rowton a place on the All Pac-10 Second
Team for the second year in a row. Rowton em
phasized the importance of feeding on momen
tum as the Cardinal enters the most critical part
of its year.
"We had a solid performance as a team dining
the last round of the [Pac-10 Championship],"
Rowton said. "Now we am hopefully use that to
fuel our efforts going into Regionals."
Junior Angela Rho comes off a 19th-place fin
ish at the Pac-10 Champkmship, her fourth top-20
performance of the year. She played solidly in last
year's Western Regional, closing with a round of
72 to finish in 25th place overall, just a single shot
back of Rowton's team-leading performance.
Fellow junior Kim Kouwabunpat will try to im
prove on her result at last year's Western Region
id. A round of 83 on the second day of the tourna
ment stifled Kouwabunpat's chances, and forced
her into a tie for 55th place.
litis year, she has been plagued by a lack of
consistency. Her two top-10 finishes, at the ASU
Invitational and the Peg Barnard California Col
legiate, came in consecutive weeks.
Aside from these moments of brilliance, she
has failed to crack the top 25 in any tournament
this year.
