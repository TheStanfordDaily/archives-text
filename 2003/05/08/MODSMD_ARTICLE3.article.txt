Attendees donned their finest attire for the Fourth
Annual Stanford Asian American Awards, held yes
terday evening in a candlelit Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The awards, created by the Asian American Ac tivi
ties Center Advisory Board in 2000, do not have set
categories. According to senior Linda Tran, an advi
sory board member at the center, the awards are
"given to celebrate passionate individuals who have
taken that unique step beyond the call of
duty . . . taken it upon themselves to challenge, ad
dress and redefine issues facing the Asian-American
community."
She believes the wide age range in recognition
makes this awards ceremony unique.
"It's really cross-generational; it brings both the
young and old together so that you get a whole sense
and greater understanding of history, legacy and fu
ture," she said.
Honored graduating seniors were Kuusela Hilo,
Filamer Kabigting, Meera Kotagal, Michelle Leung,
Owen Li and Amanda Rang.
Li regretted that not all community members re
ceive sufficient recognition.
"The thing 112 don't like about awards is that they
differentiate between people who should be recog
nized and who are recognized," he said. "They create
hierarchies, and I don't like that."

Also honored were law students Shahid Buttar and
Jennifer Chang. Faculty and staff members recog
nized were Dr. Samuel So, director of the Asian Liver
Center, Haas Center Director Nadinne Cruz, Lin
guistics Administrative Associate Natalie Mendoza,
Asian American Activities Center Asst. Director (finely
Ng and Assoc. Director of Residential Education Eliz
abeth Hiyama. Law School alumnus Delbert Wong
was also honored at the event.
