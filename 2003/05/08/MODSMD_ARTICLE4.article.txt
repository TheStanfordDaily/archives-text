# Alums discuss new Alcohol Policy
## Meeting proceeds well; Town Hall scheduled for next Tuesday 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
A group of four students and
alumni met with Vice Provost tor
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni,
Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman and Ralph Castro of
Vaden Student Health Service
yesterday to voice concerns about
the University's new Alcohol Poli
cy.
Last month, Jeff Cooper, Class
of 2001, organized a petition with
other students and alumni that
questioned the role of resident as
sistants in the new Alcohol Policy,
which prohibits drinking at all
freshman dorm events, and the
lack of student input in the deci
sion-making process.
Cooper, author of the widely
circulated petition, stressed why
he thought the meeting was nec

essary.
"We've always believed that it's
safer to have students drinking in
an environment that's comfort
able to them and filled with com
munity members and trained
RAs, not behind closed doors," he
said. "It makes a lot more sense
for students to be drinking under
the eyes of a community that
knows them.
"It's true that many freshmen
come to campus with some expe
rience with alcohol," Cooper con
tinued. "But they're not used to
living away from home and may
feel lonely and homesick. They
don't have experience with high
risk drinking activities."
While no major changes will be
made to the Policy as students and
alumni originally hoped, both
sides are pleased with the way dis
cussion is progressing.
"The meeting was very en
couraging," Cooper said. "It was a
good step forward. We're quite
happy with the reception from
the administration as well as with
the way things are moving for
ward."
Administration members also

felt the meeting had been worth
while.
"We had a really good discus
sion," Bravman said. "The two
alums and two current students
presented concerns and issues ef
fectively."
Administration members ex
plained the motivation behind
this particular policy change.
"Every year several students at
this university and many others
come close to death," Bravman
said. "I used to think Stanford was
a no pressure culture when it
came to alcohol. Things aren't the
way they were eight years ago.
The intensity of the issues has
risen dramatically.
"Drunk students can engage in
dangerous behavior," Bravman
continued. "They can cause dam
age to public property, damage to
the community and damage to
themselves. If the University
judges the situation to be suffi
ciently serious, then it is its role to
intervene. If students cross the
line, we have to get involved."
Bravman compared "crossing
the line" to driving down the free
way at 100 miles per hour on a
rainy day.
"At a certain point, we have to
step in to prevent human
tragedy," he said.
Bravman emphasized that ad
ministrators don't want to intervene.
" The students are the ones who
must take ownership of the issue,"
he said. "No policy change by it
self will do that much. If the stu
dents take control, we'll be hands
off. Stanford is very lenient. Peo
ple know that in their heads but
forget it in their hearts. Students
have to remember that tremen
dous freedom and tremendous
responsibility go hand in hand."
RAs won't become enforcers
and police under the new policy,
according to Bravman.
"We don't want to see the rela
tionship between RAs and stu

dents damaged or changed," he
said. "We didn't specify certain as
pects of the policy too precisely for
a reason: we want to leave things
to the discretion of the RAs."
Camarillo made it clear that the
yesterday's discussion was not in
tended to lead to specific answers.
"There was no expectation to
resolve anything in an hour meet
ing," she said. "As with any
change, this is a work in progress,
and I, along with my colleagues,
embrace the opportunity to plan
the implementation with people
who are committed to make
progress in support of the Uni
versity and the health and well
being of our students."
Cooper agreed that "there's
still a lot to be done." He appreci
ated how responsive the adminis
tration members have been to stu
dent complaints.
"They've all been very respect
ful and have shown tremendous
generosity with their time," he
said. "They realize that it's of crit

ical importance to have students
buy into the Alcohol Policy.
They're worried about the way al
cohol is tied into the student cul
ture and want to curb irresponsi
ble and dangerous drinking"
ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a junior, was also
pleased the meeting took place.
"We're happy the way the ad
ministration has listened to stu
dents' concerns," she said. "Stan
ford students love the fact that
they are trusted. We all believe
that it's important to preserve this
culture. Right now we need to ed
ucate students about what is
wrong with the current situation."
Next Tuesday at 7 p.m. there
will be an Alcohol Policy Town
Hall featuring the vice provost for
Student Affairs, director of Resi
dential Education, director of
Health Promotion Services, alco
hol and drug abuse director and
dean of Freshmen and Transfer
Students. Figueroa strongly en
couraged all students to attend.
