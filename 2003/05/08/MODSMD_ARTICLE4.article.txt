## Meeting proceeds well; Town Hall scheduled for next Tuesday 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
A group of four students and
alumni met with Vice Provost tor
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni,
Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman and Ralph Castro of
Vaden Student Health Service
yesterday to voice concerns about
the University's new Alcohol Poli
cy.
Last month, Jeff Cooper, Class
of 2001, organized a petition with
other students and alumni that
questioned the role of resident as
sistants in the new Alcohol Policy,
which prohibits drinking at all
freshman dorm events, and the
lack of student input in the deci
sion-making process.
Cooper, author of the widely
circulated petition, stressed why
he thought the meeting was nec

essary.
"We've always believed that it's
safer to have students drinking in
an environment that's comfort
able to them and filled with com
munity members and trained
RAs, not behind closed doors," he
said. "It makes a lot more sense
for students to be drinking under
the eyes of a community that
knows them.
"It's true that many freshmen
come to campus with some expe
rience with alcohol," Cooper con
tinued. "But they're not used to
living away from home and may
feel lonely and homesick. They
don't have experience with high
risk drinking activities."
While no major changes will be
made to the Policy as students and
alumni originally hoped, both
sides are pleased with the way dis
cussion is progressing.
"The meeting was very en
couraging," Cooper said. "It was a
good step forward. We're quite
happy with the reception from
the administration as well as with
the way things are moving for
ward."
Administration members also

felt the meeting had been worth
while.
"We had a really good discus
sion," Bravman said. "The two
alums and two current students
presented concerns and issues ef
fectively."
Administration members ex
plained the motivation behind
this particular policy change.
"Every year several students at
this university and many others
come close to death," Bravman
said. "I used to think Stanford was
a no pressure culture when it
came to alcohol. Things aren't the
way they were eight years ago.
The intensity of the issues has
risen dramatically.
"Drunk students can engage in
dangerous behavior," Bravman
continued. "They can cause dam
age to public property, damage to
the community and damage to
themselves. If the University
judges the situation to be suffi
ciently serious, then it is its role to
intervene. If students cross the
line, we have to get involved."
Bravman compared "crossing
