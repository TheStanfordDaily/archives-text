# Zionist lectures on difficulties of peace
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Peace between the Arabs and Israelis
will never be possible because of the
Palestinian unwillingness to accept an Is
raeli state, Zionist Organization of Amer
ica President Morton Klein concluded
lasi night in a speech to (>() middle- to
upper-age audience members that coin
cided with Israel Independence Day.
Klein's talk, "Israel and the Arabs: Is
Peace Possible?" was one of the speeches
sponsored by the Stanford-Israel Al
liance in a week-long Israeli Indepen
dence commemoration. Klein has lec
tured at Stanford in the past and was
well-received by last night's pro-Israeli
audience.
Klein compared Palestinian Libera
tion Organization President Yasser
Arafat to Hitler and argued that Arafat
was heading a terrorist regime, which he
compared to the Nazis. I le pointed to ap
peasement's ineffectiveness in combat
ing Hitler's aggression and preventing
the Holocaust and concluded that force
would be the only solution to ending

Palestinian terrorism.
"Israel should use massive arms to
crush this [Palestinian] regime, which
they've been prevented from doing by the
U. 5.," Klein said. "We need to gel rid of the
oppressive governments and outlaw the
1 lamas and jihads."
The fundamental problem, according
to Klein, is that Arab nations do not accept
Israel's riglu to exist. He noted that
Nazism and slavery were both eradicated
by war, not peace and negotiation.
According to organizers, Klein repre
sents a conservative viewpoint within the
pluralistic pro-Israel movement. His
speech discussed one of a myriad of per
spectives that the Stanford Israel Alliance
offered lo the Stanford community.
"We want Stanford students to be
aware of the broad range of perspectives
within the Jewish community, which
wants to see Israel continue to exist and
prosper as a Jewish state," said senior lali
Golan, co-president of the Stanford Israel
Alliance. "Therefore, we are giving them
the opportunity I his week to hear many of
those perspectives."
On Tuesday, Dr. Shlomi Ravid, execu

tive director of the Israel Center of the
Jewish Community Federation of San
Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin and Sono
ma Counties, offered a more liberal view
point in his speech, "Perspectives for Peace
in the Middle East in Light of Rabin's
Legacy."
Though the Stanford-Israel Alliance
made an effort to educate the Stanford
community, Klein's audience lacked Stan
ford students. The crowd was composed
largely of Bay Area residents with prior
knowledge of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
"/Ml the representations Klein men
tioned were well-argued and factual," said
San Jose resident Thayer Brickman after
the speech. "The Palestinian Authority has
one goal — not to accept Israel — and
Klein presented this in a well-connected
way."
Klein also argued that the escalation of
terrorism over the past decade has come at
a time when Israel has made the most con
cessions. He warned against the United
States overlooking Arab hostility and
made references to deficiencies by b< »th the
Clinton and Bush administrations in rep
rimanding Palestinian violence.
