The Stanford Shakespeare Society will present the romantic comedy
"Much Ado About Nothing" today, tomorrow and Saturday in Memor
ial Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
The show will combine traditional Shakespeare with music by Gersh
win and 1940s style dancing. The show features original choreography
and the accompaniment of a live jazz band.
"The Stanford Shakespeare Society ensemble brings new life to
Shakespeare's classic romantic comedy in an exciting new adaptation
featuring the songs of the Gershwin brothers," said senior Ed Iskandar,
director of the show." It is a joyous celebration of love and laughter in the
springtime."
The Stanford Shakespeare Society is a new, student-run organization
that trains members in Shakespearean-style acting.
"Much Ado is special because it will be entertaining theater for the au
dience combining Shakespeare's most popular comedies with Gersh
win's songbook," said Anne Gregory, a senior who will play Hero in the
show.
