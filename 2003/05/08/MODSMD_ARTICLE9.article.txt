## U.S. sanctions lifted from Iraq 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —President Bush lifted
U.S. sanctions against the old government of Iraq yes
terday and prodded the U.N. Security Council to do
the same.
"No country in good conscience can support using
sanctions to hold back the hopes of the Iraqi people,"
Bush said.
At a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar, Bush said that the United States,
Britain and Spain would introduce a U.N. resolution
"soon" that would lift sanctions imposed in 1990 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
" The regime that the sanctions were directed
against no longer rules Iraq," Bush said.
Such a resolution could be introduced before the 15-
member council as early as Friday or Monday, a senior
State Department official told The Associated Press.
U.S. efforts to lift the sanctions has met resistance
from veto-wielding Russia and France.
But after meeting with Aznar, Bush said he senses
there is now "a mood to work together" on a sanctions
resolution despite earlier objections that divided the
Security Council over whether to go war in Iraq.
Aznar agreed.
"Absolutely. I hope it's true," he said. "Everyone
needs to contribute to it within the Security Council."
Bush also announced that he was removing U.S.
sanctions imposed on Iraq under a 1990 law. He said
he was doing so to allow certain equipment needed for
Iraq's reconstruction to be sent to the country.
This was in addition to a lifting of most U.S. eco
nomic sanctions on Iraq, also ordered by Bush and
announced earlier in the day by Treasury Secretary
John Snow. Snow said the move would "bring much
needed aid and humanitarian relief' to Iraqis.
France and Russia have voiced objections to aban
doning the sanctions until the United Nations certifies
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
There were indications yesterday, however, that
France was softening its position, and so was Ger
many, a Security Council member without veto power
and a strong critic of the war.
