## Senate ratifies NATO expansion 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Sen
ate unanimously endorsed the addition
of seven former communist nations to
NATO yesterday in what would be the
largest expansion of the alliance
formed as a bulwark against Soviet mil
itary power.
With the vote, the United States be
comes the third NATO member to
have approved the expansion, joining
Canada and Norway. Senators said
the new members would boost the al
liance, strengthen American security
and encourage democracy through
out Europe.
The 16 remaining NATO must also
endorse the expansion for Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia to be admitted to
the alliance.
President Bush hailed the expan
sion in a White House ceremony at
tended by the expansion nations' for
eign ministers, who had looked on
from the Senate gallery during the
earlier vote.
Noting that yesterday was the 58th

anniversary of the allied victory over
Germany in World War 11, Bush said,
"Today on V-E day, we mark another
kind of victory in Europe."
"These heroic nations have survived
tyranny, they have won their liberty
and earned their place among free na
tions," Bush said. "America has always
considered them friends and we will al
ways be proud to call them allies."
The president also took the oppor
tunity to press for NATO to develop
new military capabilities "to confront
the emerging dangers of a new era" —
primarily terrorism.
The Senate's unanimous vote came
despite doubts by many lawmakers
about the future of the alliance, follow
ing a rift over the Iraq war.
"This is historic for these seven
countries, vital in continuing to
strengthen the North Atlantic alliance
and central to U.S. security and rela
tionships in the world," said Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman
Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
The 96-0 vote contrasted with the

heated debate that surrounded the last
round of expansion five years ago,
when the Senate voted 80-19 to add the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
A two-thirds vote is needed for treaty
ratification.
It was also the second time in two
months that the Senate unanimously
endorsed an international treaty deal
ing with an issue that had once been
contentious. In March, it approved an
agreement calling fora reduction in
U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.
Bush administration officials have
cited the difficulty of winning congres
sional votes as potential obstacles on
some major foreign policy issues, such
as nuclear talks with North Korea and
immigration talks with Mexico.
"I hope that we have a very affirma
tive message today that our committee
is effective and thorough," said Lugar.
Antanas Valionis, Lithuania's for
eign minister, said at a joint news con
ference that the expansion "marked
another step in the creation of a Europe
whole and free."
