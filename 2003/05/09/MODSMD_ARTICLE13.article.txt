# U.S. proposes to run Iraq for a year
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —The United States and
Britain are seeking U.N. approval to run Iraq for at least a
year in an American proposal that also limits the United Na
tions' role in the country, council diplomats said yesterday.
The long-awaited U.S. draft resolution, to be intro
duced at the U.N. Security Council today, outlines a U.S.
vision for postwar Iraq sharply at odds with that of several
Security Council members, particularly Russia.
It would end U.N. control over Iraq's oil revenue and let
the U.S.-led coalition use the country's vast oil wealth to help
finance its reconstruction — with international oversight.
The U.S. proposal calls for the immediate lifting of
sanctions against Iraq and would phase out over a four
month period the oil-for-food humanitarian program,
which has been feeding 90 percent of Iraq's 24 million
people. It does not mention any role for U.N. weapons in
spectors, whose return to Iraq Washington opposes.
The resolution would also approve a "coalition provi

sional authority," run by Washington and London, to gov
ern Iraq — and it apparently foresees a lengthy stay.
Under the proposal, the 12-month initial authorization
would be automatically renewed unless the Security
Council decided otherwise, the council diplomats said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Since the United
States and Britain have veto power in the council, they
could block any attempt to get them to leave Iraq — which
is likely to be unacceptable to some council members.
The United States could also face opposition from
council members that want the world body to be a major
player in creating an interim government for Iraq. The
draft resolution does not define the makeup or duties of a
provisional government, which if approved would effec
tively leave it up to the United States and Britain to decide.
The United States and Britain sent a letter to the coun
cil president late yesterday outlining their role as the
"coalition provisional authority" in Iraq.
