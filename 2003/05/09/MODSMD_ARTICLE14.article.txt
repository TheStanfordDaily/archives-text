# Stem cell shortage reported

WASHINGTON (AP) —Only 11 human
stem cell lines are available for research, far
fewer than originally estimated, the director of
the National Institutes of Health reports.
The finding led to a call for lifting the re
striction that President Bush placed on stem
cell research.
NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, writing in
today's edition of the journal Science, says his
agency is giving a high priority to research using
stem cells because of the potential for treatment
of diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson's.
But Zerhouni's review of the status of work
supported by the NIH also shows that initial
reports of more than 70 stem cell lines eligible
for research were optimistic.
Donald Kennedy, editor in chief of the jour
nal, contends in an accompanying editorial
that development of new cell lines for research
is necessary. "It is plainly not sound policy to

retain the current restrictions on work" with
human embryonic stem cells, he said.
The president has ordered that that stem cell
research can continue but scientists receiving
federal funds can use only cell lines that were
available on Aug. 9, 2001. The Health and
Human Services Department reported at the
time that more than 70 cell lines — continuous
ly propagating cell colonies — were available.
But Zerhouni says in his paper that many of
those cell lines were in the early stages of devel
opment and were not to the point where they
could be distributed for use. To overcome this,
he reports, the NIH provided grants to bring
the cell lines to the point where they can be used.
"As a consequence of this support, the num
ber of cell lines available for widespread distri
bution has grown from a single cell line in the
spring of 2002 to 11 cell lines at present," Zer
houni wrote.
