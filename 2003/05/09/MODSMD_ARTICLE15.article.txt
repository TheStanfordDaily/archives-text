## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Questioning beauty ideals 
### 
Children are often taught that
beauty is in the eye of the be
holder. Yet the photographs
that grace the covers of mod
ern magazines seem to tell a different
story; our youth- and aesthetics-crazed
society does indeed define beauty in a
very particular way. For instance, People
magazine annually selects the 50 most
beautiful people in the world.
But the magazine isn't the only cul
prit. Every day, mass media drives the
public's conception of beauty. Instead of
questioning and defining for themselves
what true beauty is, many Americans
often accept and strive for the media's
grossly unrealistic interpretations.
Some individuals then try to mold
themselves to fit this perceived manu
factured concep
tion of ideal beauty.

The problems that
result from this
kind of behavior
range from fad
diets to eating dis
orders, both of
which currently
plague millions of
men and women
around the world.
While there is no
easy way to change
the way that our so
ciety thinks about
beauty, a key first
step toward doing so
is through open dis
cussion about what
beauty and ideals

about body image
represent to different individuals. That is
the goal of a recent exhibition at the Can
tor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford.
Described as a "cross-cultural per
spective on ideals of physical beauty,"
the exhibition, entitled "The Ideal Fig
ure," opened to the public on Wednes
day. Lauren Silver, co-organizer of the
exhibition and associate curator for ed
ucation at the center, said that the exhi
bition addresses "profound ideas and
attitudes prevalent in cultures' views of
the ideal human body."
"The Ideal Figure" features art and
media to question the way that most
Americans define physical beauty. The

Roman torso of Doryphorus and an
African mask with full costume from the

Luvale culture — are arranged in a cir
cle, "conversing" with one another
about their figures. Exhibition-goers are
invited to stand in the middle of the cir
cle to participate in the "discussion."
Visitors to the center can also view doc
umentary films and read cross-cultural
magazines, such as Fitness and People
En Espanol.
What maft.es this exhibition particu
larly unique is that it challenges its at
tendants to think about and respond to
the visual and intellectual experience of
the exhibit: There are Post-it Notes
available for viewers to make comments
about what they see and feel. Quotations
from various publications, ranging from
medicine to popular culture, have been
placed around the gallery to further

stimulate thought
and discussion.
Living in a cul
ture that has become
obsessed with physi
cal appearance — as
evidenced by the
popularity of shows
like Fox's "Extreme
Makeover" and
"The Bachelor" —
provides a danger
ous setting for indi
viduals struggling
with body and beau
ty issues.
We encourage
the Stanford com
munity to attend this
invaluable exhibit
and take a moment

to ponder how the
idea of beauty has been overemphasized
and unrealistically constructed in our
society.
At elite universities such as Stanford,
the women with disordered
eating is often between 20 and 25 per
cent — a distressingly high figure. We
hope that by promoting these discus
sions, the exhibit will serve to help the
community rethink the importance of
addressing such a relevant topic.
Rather than looking at the photo
graph of a model on the cover of Vogue
and wishing to be that thin, people
should question why women with fig
ures like these models, who make up
only a small percentage of American fe
males, have set the bar for what is
thought to be the "ideal."
