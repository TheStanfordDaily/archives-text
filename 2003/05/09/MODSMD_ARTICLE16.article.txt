Hyphen in "Asian-American" studies implies
negative underlying connotations
1 would like to point out to the editorial staff of The
Daily that placing a hyphen in terms such as "Asian-
American Studies" is no longer common practice. Al
though it might seem like a tedious exercise in se
mantics or political correctness, most scholars today
no longer hyphenate the term "Asian American" be
cause of its underlying connotations.
The hyphenated term "Asian-American" implies
that Americans of Asian descent are not fully Ameri
can— that the two are equally interchangeable in
both meaning and significance. Although this may be
the case for some, most Asian Americans identify first
as an "American" and second as an "Asian" (of what
ever ethnicity). Thus, many Asian American organi
zations and student groups at Stanford, including the
Program in Asian American Studies, do not use the
hyphen in the term "Asian-American Studies."

Valuing Stanford
I am responding to columnist Jim Mosqueda's
column "Camp Nowhere" (May 7). Simply put,
maybe he didn't get into Harvard.

Some of us had the choice and are here because we
like this school better. 1 really hope he was kidding and
likes this school more than he implied. I feel sorry for
him if Stanford has proven to be disappointing.

Printing at Law Library not free for non-law students
The Law Library welcomes undergraduates and
all Stanford non-law students. However, the library
does not provide free printing for non-law students.
Our computers are primarily for law students, law
faculty and law staff. Others who have a legitimate
need to use our electronic resources — such as non
law students taking a law course or those working as
research assistants to law professors — should seek
login assistance from the reference librarian.
Also, I have an additionally note for non-law stu
dents: The law library is undergoing a major reno
vation this summer. The bulk of our collection is
being placed in remote storage; this is happening
right now. Non-law students who are doing re
search would be wise to plan far ahead as to what
books they may need and then seek alternative ways
to obtain them if need be, because many won't be
available here.
