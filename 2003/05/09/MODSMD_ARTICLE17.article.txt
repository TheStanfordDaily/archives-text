## What's your number? 
### 
I am going to address a tired
subject, but one that's on
every student's mind: the
Draw. I know you are sick of
it. I'm sick of it too.
Wednesday morning, the
dreaded Draw numbers came out.
The results of this event either
ruined your day or made you ex
cited for next year. One number
— or two or three or four —
makes such a difference in a Stan
ford student's life.
Residential Education prides it
self on the centrality of a student's
dorm in his or her educational ex
perience. Unfortunately, the Draw
is the one time of year when a ma
jority of students actually care.
Most people can deal with their
Draw numbers. But then there are
the extreme cases.
People who get good Draw
numbers — like that friend of
yours who got 171 and now faces
the difficult choice between
Xanadu and Lamda Nu — are
happy, but never off-the-wall ec
static. Somehow it just feels right;
they knew they would get a good
number. They don't feel incredi
bly fortunate, and it's clearly not a
mistake.
Notice that I use the third per
son in this case, because I cannot
count myself in this group of the
lucky. This year I escaped the hell
of the draw by applying to be on
staff. Thank God.
But to console all of you out
there with numbers that will have
you unpacking in the basement
of Crothers next year, my fresh
man year I drew a 1909. I know
how it feels. It doesn't get much
worse than that.
It's you, my friends, the ones who
got terrible Draw numbers, who are
the interesting people to study.
There's a certain pattern that
emerges from people who re

ceived the awful Draw numbers.
You check on Axess or on that
dreaded list. You go into shock at
first. You feel detached from life.
Then you start to think about the
implications of this terrible num
ber on your future: What life will
be like in Burbank, or a Mirrielees
triple or (dare I say it?) West Lag.
With a little distance — time to
mull over the number — comes

the anger. The
defensiveness.
The injustice of it
all. This is a com
mon phe
nomenon. Stu
dents who are
unlucky in the
Draw begin to
think: How dare

housing give me a bad number? I
don't deserve this, I deserve to
live in Bob.
Then the complaining begins.
Every person you meet, you ex
plain your crisis, the hate-crime
that has been committed against
you. You want their sympathy.
You want their support. You des
perately need a shoulder to cry on.
But to be honest, I don't care. I
honestly do not care about your
shitty Draw number.
You didn't care about my Draw
number when I got a 1909.
That's the thing about Draw
numbers: no one cares about any
one else's. Sure, you get pangs of
jealousy when you hear about a
good one, but you don't sympa
thize with anyone who gets
screwed in the Draw.
And I especially don't care,
since my preferred Draw number
from freshman year was worse
than yours.
So don't come complaining to
me about the fact that you can't
live in a Row house and you might
actually have to live in Manzanita

as a senior. I had nothing to do
with it. I don't think of you as less
of a person. I'm laughing with
you, not at you.
You're not laughing?
Well it looks like the Draw-god
who granted you this horrific
number doesn't seem to care ei
ther. I'm not even entirely sure
who hands out the Draw numbers.
I think they like to stay anonymous
out of self-defense, a sort of Draw
Protection Program. Despite our
pleas, our Opinions pieces in The
Daily and our heated discussions,
these all-powerful people do noth
ing to change the system.
I've heard about simple solu
tions to the awful Draw system, like
having a guaranteed year on the
Row. What about implementing
two different levels of preferred
housing so that you won't end up
with two numbers in the thou
sands in your Stanford career?
These are easy changes that don't
seem like they would take that long
to put in place, so why must the
Draw-gods punish us and keep
this obsolete system in place?
Despite all the complaining,
we should be thankful this is only
a Draw for housing, not a draft
for military service in Vietnam,
which our parents experienced
just a few decades ago. The patri
arch's draft number has become a
part of many families' folklore.
Will you be telling your kids what
your 2003 Draw number was?
Probably not.
Draw numbers, as annoying
and frustrating as they are, are just
numbers, and these numbers are
just for housing.
And I heard Gavilan throws
the best parties.

number? Don't e-mail me at ccic
