# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Alcohol policy arguments examined 
### ROBERT WEISBERG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Recent graduate Jeff Cooper, '01, is quoted in
"Alums discuss new Alcohol Policy" (May 8) for his
criticism of the newly proposed freshmen dorm Al
cohol Policy. His words almost perfectly echo a
number of letters The Daily has published in recent
weeks. And all of these echo the almost mechanical
remarks that Stanford students seem almost pre
programmed to utter. I suggest that to save space
and ink, The Daily should simply have a line saying,
"Insert generic student response here."
Stanford undergraduates come here hardwired
to utter a fixed, ritualized statement about alcohol
and dormitory life. Whether written or oral, the
statements are always cast in a rhetoric suggesting
deep and worried insight and wisdom, but they al
ways say the same thing, and they seem immune to
self-criticism. Mere is the gist of the script:
First, restricting alcohol consumption in any way
is very dangerous, because it will force students to
drink in their rooms, where their dangerous behav
ior may not get observed, or way off-campus, where
they might risk drunk-driving accidents.
Second, any alcohol enforcement policy will in

evitably put resident assistants in the role of "po
lice," thereby destroying that special relationship of
trust and empathy between RAs and students.
Third, if students drink in public spaces in their
dorms, resident staff can not only ensure their safe
ty but also c an assist them in the process of "accept
ing responsibility for their actions." Students pro
claim they came to Stanford precisely because it was
different from all other campuses. Here, students
learn to "accept responsibility for their actions,"
rather than have to worry about being sanctioned
for violating arbitrary rules. Stanford students thus
become better educated and more mature citizens.
Yet there are some inherent problems with the
typical script so often perpetuated in letters, article
quotations and guest columns.
Apparently some staff in the Alcohol Policy com
mittee have found studies daring to find evidence
that alcohol enforcement might actually reduce the
harmful consequences of alcohol. But when Stan
ford students write their generic letters, they always
claim high empirical authority, based on the expe
rience of having been a high school and college stu
dent that supposedly moots any need to actually
