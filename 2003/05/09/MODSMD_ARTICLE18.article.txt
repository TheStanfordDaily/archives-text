# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Alcohol policy arguments examined 
### ROBERT WEISBERG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Recent graduate Jeff Cooper, '01, is quoted in
"Alums discuss new Alcohol Policy" (May 8) for his
criticism of the newly proposed freshmen dorm Al
cohol Policy. His words almost perfectly echo a
number of letters The Daily has published in recent
weeks. And all of these echo the almost mechanical
remarks that Stanford students seem almost pre
programmed to utter. I suggest that to save space
and ink, The Daily should simply have a line saying,
"Insert generic student response here."
Stanford undergraduates come here hardwired
to utter a fixed, ritualized statement about alcohol
and dormitory life. Whether written or oral, the
statements are always cast in a rhetoric suggesting
deep and worried insight and wisdom, but they al
ways say the same thing, and they seem immune to
self-criticism. Mere is the gist of the script:
First, restricting alcohol consumption in any way
is very dangerous, because it will force students to
drink in their rooms, where their dangerous behav
ior may not get observed, or way off-campus, where
they might risk drunk-driving accidents.
Second, any alcohol enforcement policy will in

evitably put resident assistants in the role of "po
lice," thereby destroying that special relationship of
trust and empathy between RAs and students.
Third, if students drink in public spaces in their
dorms, resident staff can not only ensure their safe
ty but also c an assist them in the process of "accept
ing responsibility for their actions." Students pro
claim they came to Stanford precisely because it was
different from all other campuses. Here, students
learn to "accept responsibility for their actions,"
rather than have to worry about being sanctioned
for violating arbitrary rules. Stanford students thus
become better educated and more mature citizens.
Yet there are some inherent problems with the
typical script so often perpetuated in letters, article
quotations and guest columns.
Apparently some staff in the Alcohol Policy com
mittee have found studies daring to find evidence
that alcohol enforcement might actually reduce the
harmful consequences of alcohol. But when Stan
ford students write their generic letters, they always
claim high empirical authority, based on the expe
rience of having been a high school and college stu
dent that supposedly moots any need to actually
conduct research on this emi
nently researchable issue. I have
no idea who is correct on this
stance, yet a research university
such as Stanford ought to be
more curious to find out.
In reference to the second
point in the repeated student
rhetoric, "RAs will be polic ing the
halls" is a soundbite. Many alco
hol enforcement policies do not
require RAs to do any monitoring
of individual students. If a fresh
men dorm is not allowed to serve
alcohol at a party, the resident
fellow or RA simply has to request
that party organizers do not put
alcohol out in their public serving
places. This says nothing about
individual students walking

around with their own beers.
This is how pervasive and ill-ex
amined the "we don't want to po
lice" soundbite is: When 1 was an
resident fellow, the University
general counsel, in light of new
federal regulations, instructed
the RFs (not even the RAs) of all
of the freshman dorms that they
were not allowed to buy beer or
rent kegs for the students. The
simple reason? Those acts by RFs
are misdemeanors under the Cal
ifornia Penal Code. At an RF
meeting to discuss this policy,
some RFs lamented, that the Uni
versity was forcing them to be
come policemen. And many of
these individuals are tenured
professors. They were just per
forming the soundbite.
Finally, in response to the third
part of the student concerns, sure
ly RAs need to have an eye out for
dangers to student safety and

health. But the image of RAs float
ing around the dorms during par
ties acting simultaneously as moral
tutors to students engaged in
philosophical self-exploration and
nurses to the self-destructively
drunk ones is a curious one. More
over, the "learn-to-take-responsi
bility for one's conduct" soundbite
is so vague and incoherent as to be
useless. What are the conse
quences and how does one take re
sponsibility? One of the conse
quences of living in a world where
you can be outvoted on matters of
social policy is that you are stuck
with numerous arbitrary and ar
guably ill-conceived laws. Stan
ford students always take a sancti
monious pose of Stanford moral
exceptionalism on this issue, as if
existential heroism and ethical ed
ucation are achieved by a kind of
civil disobedience toward alcohol
laws. Civil disobedience is a great

principle, but its high-minded
promotion perhaps ought to be re
served for more serious issues.
The alcohol age limit laws may
be all wrong, much effort at en
forcement may be futile, and I can
sympathize with students who bla
tantly say that they want to drink
and will always seek to evade the
underage drinking laws. But can
we be spared further repetitions of
the soundbites?
Additionally, Cooper's re
marks do vary the script in one
amusing way. He describes the
people surrounding and gener
ously mentoring the drinker as
"community members." I think
this means "other students," but
the halo is made brighter by this
new phrase.

Recent graduate Jeff Cooper, '01, is quoted in
"Alums discuss new Alcohol Policy" (May 8) for his
criticism of the newly proposed freshmen dorm Al
cohol Policy. His words almost perfectly echo a
number of letters The Daily has published in recent
weeks. And all of these echo the almost mechanical
remarks that Stanford students seem almost pre
programmed to utter. I suggest that to save space
and ink, The Daily should simply have a line saying,
"Insert generic student response here."
Stanford undergraduates come here hardwired
to utter a fixed, ritualized statement about alcohol
and dormitory life. Whether written or oral, the
statements are always cast in a rhetoric suggesting
deep and worried insight and wisdom, but they al
ways say the same thing, and they seem immune to
self-criticism. Mere is the gist of the script:
First, restricting alcohol consumption in any way
is very dangerous, because it will force students to
drink in their rooms, where their dangerous behav
ior may not get observed, or way off-campus, where
they might risk drunk-driving accidents.
Second, any alcohol enforcement policy will in

evitably put resident assistants in the role of "po
lice," thereby destroying that special relationship of
trust and empathy between RAs and students.
Third, if students drink in public spaces in their
dorms, resident staff can not only ensure their safe
ty but also c an assist them in the process of "accept
ing responsibility for their actions." Students pro
claim they came to Stanford precisely because it was
different from all other campuses. Here, students
learn to "accept responsibility for their actions,"
rather than have to worry about being sanctioned
for violating arbitrary rules. Stanford students thus
become better educated and more mature citizens.
Yet there are some inherent problems with the
typical script so often perpetuated in letters, article
quotations and guest columns.
Apparently some staff in the Alcohol Policy com
mittee have found studies daring to find evidence
that alcohol enforcement might actually reduce the
harmful consequences of alcohol. But when Stan
ford students write their generic letters, they always
claim high empirical authority, based on the expe
rience of having been a high school and college stu
dent that supposedly moots any need to actually
conduct research on this emi
nently researchable issue. I have
no idea who is correct on this
stance, yet a research university
such as Stanford ought to be
more curious to find out.
In reference to the second
point in the repeated student
rhetoric, "RAs will be polic ing the
halls" is a soundbite. Many alco
hol enforcement policies do not
require RAs to do any monitoring
of individual students. If a fresh
men dorm is not allowed to serve
alcohol at a party, the resident
fellow or RA simply has to request
that party organizers do not put
alcohol out in their public serving
places. This says nothing about
individual students walking

around with their own beers.
This is how pervasive and ill-ex
amined the "we don't want to po
lice" soundbite is: When 1 was an
resident fellow, the University
general counsel, in light of new
federal regulations, instructed
the RFs (not even the RAs) of all
of the freshman dorms that they
were not allowed to buy beer or
rent kegs for the students. The
simple reason? Those acts by RFs
are misdemeanors under the Cal
ifornia Penal Code. At an RF
meeting to discuss this policy,
some RFs lamented, that the Uni
versity was forcing them to be
come policemen. And many of
these individuals are tenured
professors. They were just per
forming the soundbite.
Finally, in response to the third
part of the student concerns, sure
ly RAs need to have an eye out for
dangers to student safety and

health. But the image of RAs float
ing around the dorms during par
ties acting simultaneously as moral
tutors to students engaged in
philosophical self-exploration and
nurses to the self-destructively
drunk ones is a curious one. More
over, the "learn-to-take-responsi
bility for one's conduct" soundbite
is so vague and incoherent as to be
useless. What are the conse
quences and how does one take re
sponsibility? One of the conse
quences of living in a world where
you can be outvoted on matters of
social policy is that you are stuck
with numerous arbitrary and ar
guably ill-conceived laws. Stan
ford students always take a sancti
monious pose of Stanford moral
exceptionalism on this issue, as if
existential heroism and ethical ed
ucation are achieved by a kind of
civil disobedience toward alcohol
laws. Civil disobedience is a great

principle, but its high-minded
promotion perhaps ought to be re
served for more serious issues.
The alcohol age limit laws may
be all wrong, much effort at en
forcement may be futile, and I can
sympathize with students who bla
tantly say that they want to drink
and will always seek to evade the
underage drinking laws. But can
we be spared further repetitions of
the soundbites?
Additionally, Cooper's re
marks do vary the script in one
amusing way. He describes the
people surrounding and gener
ously mentoring the drinker as
"community members." I think
this means "other students," but
the halo is made brighter by this
new phrase.
