## Softball hits final season stretch 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the NCAA Tournament just
around the corner, the Stanford women's
softball team has one last shot at making a
mark on the selection committee this
weekend in Oregon.

Softball
Friday: No. 15 Stanford at Ore. State, 2 p.m.
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford at No. 18 Ore., noon
Saturday: No. 15 Stanford at No. 18 Ore., 6 p.m.

The No. 17 Cardinal (38-23, 5-13 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will play at Oregon
State on Friday at 2 p.m. and travel to
Oregon fora doubleheader on Saturday
at noon.
On Sunday, Stanford will learn its
seeding and regional site location when
they are announced on ESPNews at 7
p.m.
The Cardinal currently sits in seventh
place in the conference, but that's not re

ally telling the whole story. The Pac-10
boasts seven of the nation's top 20 teams,
including No. 1 Arizona and the defend
ing NCAA champion, California.
Last weekend, the league's quality was
on display at Stanford's expense, as the
Cardinal lost three times: twice to the top
ranked Wildcats and once to Arizona
State.
Stanford rebounded with a double
header sweep of San Jose State on Tues
day. The Cardinal won the first game 1-0
behind brilliant pitching from Dana
Sorensen and followed with a 4-2 victory
as junior catcher Jessica Allister launched
a three-run homer in the fifth inning to
boost the offense.
This weekend, the team starts in Cor
valis, Ore., with a game against the
Beavers (31-27, 4-14). OSU enters the
game on a high after notching a huge
upset of then-No. 5 Washington and is
looking to secure its fifth consecutive
NCAA Tournament appearance.
If that happens, the Pac-10 would

place an unprecedented eight teams in
the postseason.
Following the battle with the Beavers,
the Stanford squad will travel to Eugene
fora Saturday doubleheader against the
Ducks (30-16,8-10).
Oregon upset Stanford on the Farm
on April 4 in a thrilling 3-2 victory in 10
innings. The Ducks also come in on a
high of their own, having beaten the
Huskies last weekend for the first time
since April 1999.
Unlike in previous years, the NCAA
Division I softball committee has released
the locations of the Regional Tourna
ments prior to (he final seedings.
This year's Regional Tournaments will
be played at Alabama, Arizona, Cal-State
Fullerton, Flordia, Fresno State, Michi
gan, Nebraska and Texas.
Stanford dropped two spots in the na
tional rankings this week, which means
Stanford will enter postseason play with
the lowest ranking any of the current Car
dinal players have ever faced.
