# XX factor (Scott's mom) talks sports
## 
### 
The X factor. You hear about it a lot dur
ing the NBA playoffs. Kobe Bryant has
it. Some sixth man off the bench could
be it. Offensive rebounding is it.
In sports, it's the often-unquantifiable ingre
dient that sets a player or team apart from all oth
ers — usually the difference in a game between
winning and losing.
By definition, only a select few have the X fac
tor but everyone, athletes and otherwise, possess
the XX factor.

With Mother's Day ap
proaching, it's only right that I
turn to my XX factor — chro
mosomally speaking — for her
take on the hottest issues in the
sports world.
I interrupted my mom dur
ing a busy day at work to talk
sports in this exclusive inter
view:

Me: The Wizards' front office cut ties with
Michael Jordan earlier this week. Good decision?
Mom: Well, he's been playing basketball for
the past two years and I don't know what that has
to do with his ability in a management position. 1
think they're all a bunch of overpaid spoiled guys
anyway. There are plenty of places that would
love to have Michael and I wouldn't want to stay
in Washington if I were him. 1 don't think the
team's going anywhere.
Me: No kidding. I know you're not a big bas
ketball fan, but everyone is talking about whether
the Spurs can knock off the Lakers, winners of
the past three NBA titles. Think it can happen?
Mom: I don't even know where the Spurs are
from but I hope they can beat the Lakers. No
team should win that many years in a row. Is that
the New Jersey Lakers?
Me: No.
Mom: Oh. Chicago?
Me: Nope.
Mom: California.
Me: Close enough. Los Angeles. What do you
think of high school players like Leßron James
passing up college and entering the NBA Draft?
Would you let me?
Mom: I guess it depends on what's most im
portant to you. If you're really honestly doing it
because your family is desperate for the money
that's fine, but if you're just using that as an ex
cuse to earn a pile of money then you don't have
anything to fall back on. I would want you to go
to college anyway. I'd figure you could make a
name for yourself in college, still make it in the
N BA and then do something with the rest of your
life.
Me: I guess it's a good thing I never had the
skills to be the next Kevin Garnett, huh?
Mom: Yeah it is. How do you get someone to
say no to a million dollars?
Me: When did you know you could stop wor
rying about that — that I wasn't going to be a
professional athlete?
Mom: I think I knew when you were in mid
dle school.
Me: Ouch. Moving on, what do you think of
the way lowa State and Alabama handled the
Larry Eustachy and Mike Price situations?
Mom: I think the universities did the right
thing. I think there should be standards of con
duct for the coaches if they expect their players to
abide by that conduct, too.
Me: Do you think their parents, specifically
