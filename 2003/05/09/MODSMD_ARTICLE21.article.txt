# Stanford baseball heading in right direction
## With pitching rotation in gear, Cardinal begins push for conference title 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Talk about a turnaround.
Since losing three of four games
two weeks ago to then-unranked Ari
zona and Santa Clara and looking like
a team headed nowhere but down,
the Stanford baseball team rebound
ed in style.

Friday: No. 7 Stanford at Cal, 2:30 p.m.
Saturday: No. 7 Stanford at Cal, 1 p.m.
Sunday: No. 7 Stanford at Cal, I p.m.

Alter pounding Southern California
in Los Angeles for three straight wins
and then shutting out San Jose State on
the road Tuesday night, the No. 7 Car
dinal (32-14 overall, 13-5 Pacific 10
Conference) seems to be rolling at just
the right time.
While junior John Hudgins (7-3,
3.29 ERA) and freshman Mark Ro
manczuk (9-0, 3.63) have been rocks
at the top of the Cardinal rotation
since March, the roles of third and
fourth starter have been the two ques
tion marks casting a dark shadow
over any Stanford national champi
onship dreams for 2003.
However, freshman Matt Man
ship's impressive collegiate starting
debut against USC, coupled with se
nior Tim Cunningham's encouraging
performance against the Spartans,
have given a sudden and much-need
ed confidence boost to the Cardinal.
Manship allowed three runs in 7
2/3 innings, while Cunningham sur
rendered just one hit in three superb
innings that marked his best outing
since returning to the team from a
February pinky injury.
This weekend in Berkeley, Stan
ford continues its season-long seven
game road trip and puts its 11-game
road winning streak on the line

against California (27-24, 10-11 Pac
-10), a team fighting for NCAA tourna
ment consideration and hoping to
avenge the Cardinal's Sunken Dia
mond sweep of the Bears in a March
non-conference series.
If both Manship — Stanford's best
pitcher over the last month and a half

— and Cunnigham can continue
their success in the season's final two
months, the Cardinal seems quite ca
pable of punching its fifth consecutive
ticket to Omaha for the College
World Series.
Stanford sits one-and-a-half games
ahead of No. 6 Arizona State and two

games in front of No. 21 Arizona, with
both schools out of conference action
this weekend.
While the Cardinal has the oppor
tunity to open a three-game league
lead by Sunday evening, the Sun Dev
ils, tied with Stanford in the loss col
umn, play six conference games in
eight days beginning Monday due to
a Pac-10 scheduling error.
ASU could catch up with difficult
but possible sweeps of Oregon State
and Washington on the road in the
Northwest.
Like the Wildcats, Stanford hasjust
six Pac-10 games remaining while
ASU has nine. However, both Arizona
schools will play conference games in
the season's final weekend at the same
time.
Stanford hosts Cal Poly in a non
conference set, potentially taking the
league race out of the Cardinal's
hands if the team happens to slip up
at all between now and then.
If Stanford manages sweeps of the
Bears at Evans Diamond this week
end and over UCLA at home the
next, it will lock up its first Pac-10
championship since sharing it in the
2000 season due to its tie-breaking se
ries win over ASU in Tempe earlier
this year.
Stanford's four impressive victories
since last Saturday —in which the
Cardinal outscored its opponents 41-
16— were not the only good news
for the program this week.
Junior Carlos Quentin, batting
.416 with six home runs and 37 RBI
in 2003, became the 10th Stanford
player to be named a finalist for the
prestigious Golden Spikes Award,
given to the nation's best player every
season.
The Cardinal is tied with Miami for
the most players that have earned one
of the five finalist spots in the award's
26-year history.

best nine wins and holding hitters to a
league-low .226 average in his out

Junior Brian Hall and the Stanford baseball team are all finding it easier to focus on the
ball these days. With the emergence of freshman Matt Mansnip, the No. 7 Cardinal
may now have three top-quality starting pitchers to help it win the Pac-10 title.
Ed Thursday to the 2003 USA
Baseball National Team Trials to

The National Freshman Play
er of the Year candidate was one
of 18 new invitees announced
Thursday and one of 26 already
made public, with 10 additional
selections forthcoming.

The news came as a follow-up
to Monday's announcement of a
Stanford sweep of the weekly
conference awards, with Ro
manczuk earning his third Pac
-10 Pitcher of the Week award in
the last five weeks and senior
Ryan Garko taking home his
first-ever conference Player of

The award sweep was Stan
ford's first since battery-mates
Jason Young and Damien Al

made public, with 10 additional
selections forthcoming.

The news came as a follow-up
to Monday's announcement of a
Stanford sweep of the weekly
conference awards, with Ro
manczuk earning his third Pac
-10 Pitcher of the Week award in
the last five weeks and senior
Ryan Garko taking home his
first-ever conference Player of
the Week honor.
The award sweep was Stan
ford's first since battery-mates
Jason Young and Damien Al
varado turned the trick in April
of 1999.
Talk about a turnaround.
Since losing three of four games
two weeks ago to then-unranked Ari
zona and Santa Clara and looking like
a team headed nowhere but down,
the Stanford baseball team rebound
ed in style.

Alter pounding Southern California
in Los Angeles for three straight wins
and then shutting out San Jose State on
the road Tuesday night, the No. 7 Car
dinal (32-14 overall, 13-5 Pacific 10
Conference) seems to be rolling at just
the right time.
While junior John Hudgins (7-3,
3.29 ERA) and freshman Mark Ro
manczuk (9-0, 3.63) have been rocks
at the top of the Cardinal rotation
since March, the roles of third and
fourth starter have been the two ques
tion marks casting a dark shadow
over any Stanford national champi
onship dreams for 2003.
However, freshman Matt Man
ship's impressive collegiate starting
debut against USC, coupled with se
nior Tim Cunningham's encouraging
performance against the Spartans,
have given a sudden and much-need
ed confidence boost to the Cardinal.
Manship allowed three runs in 7
2/3 innings, while Cunningham sur
rendered just one hit in three superb
innings that marked his best outing
since returning to the team from a
February pinky injury.
This weekend in Berkeley, Stan
ford continues its season-long seven
game road trip and puts its 11-game
road winning streak on the line

against California (27-24, 10-11 Pac
-10), a team fighting for NCAA tourna
ment consideration and hoping to
avenge the Cardinal's Sunken Dia
mond sweep of the Bears in a March
non-conference series.
If both Manship — Stanford's best
pitcher over the last month and a half

— and Cunnigham can continue
their success in the season's final two
months, the Cardinal seems quite ca
pable of punching its fifth consecutive
ticket to Omaha for the College
World Series.
Stanford sits one-and-a-half games
ahead of No. 6 Arizona State and two

games in front of No. 21 Arizona, with
both schools out of conference action
this weekend.
While the Cardinal has the oppor
tunity to open a three-game league
lead by Sunday evening, the Sun Dev
ils, tied with Stanford in the loss col
umn, play six conference games in
eight days beginning Monday due to
a Pac-10 scheduling error.
ASU could catch up with difficult
but possible sweeps of Oregon State
and Washington on the road in the
Northwest.
Like the Wildcats, Stanford hasjust
six Pac-10 games remaining while
ASU has nine. However, both Arizona
schools will play conference games in
the season's final weekend at the same
time.
Stanford hosts Cal Poly in a non
conference set, potentially taking the
league race out of the Cardinal's
hands if the team happens to slip up
at all between now and then.
If Stanford manages sweeps of the
Bears at Evans Diamond this week
end and over UCLA at home the
next, it will lock up its first Pac-10
championship since sharing it in the
2000 season due to its tie-breaking se
ries win over ASU in Tempe earlier
this year.
Stanford's four impressive victories
since last Saturday —in which the
Cardinal outscored its opponents 41-
16— were not the only good news
for the program this week.
Junior Carlos Quentin, batting
.416 with six home runs and 37 RBI
in 2003, became the 10th Stanford
player to be named a finalist for the
prestigious Golden Spikes Award,
given to the nation's best player every
season.
The Cardinal is tied with Miami for
the most players that have earned one
of the five finalist spots in the award's
26-year history.

Junior Brian Hall and the Stanford baseball team are all finding it easier to focus on the
ball these days. With the emergence of freshman Matt Mansnip, the No. 7 Cardinal
may now have three top-quality starting pitchers to help it win the Pac-10 title.
