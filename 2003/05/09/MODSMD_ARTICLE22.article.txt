# Gould won't let Cardinal tennis get complacent
## Stanford men's tennis squad aims for national record 18th NCAA title 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
It's that time again. Time for anoth
er near-fortnight of Stanford men's
tennis domination.
The No. 4 Cardinal (21-3, 7-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) starts its quest fora
record 18th NCAA title when it hosts
the first and second rounds of the
NCAA Team Championships at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
The Pac-10 champion Cardinal, the
fifth national seed in the tournament,
will square off against Oral Roberts (8-
14-1) Saturday at noon. In the first
match of the day, Arizona State (9-11)
plays Fresno State (17-8) at 9 a.m.
The winners of Saturday's matches
will play at noon on Sunday for the

right to travel to Athens, Ga. for the 16-
team NCAA Team Championships
held May 17 to 20.
"From now on we'll need to play like
our life depends on it," coach Dick
Gould said. "But that's the way this
team has played all year."
"I have a lot of confidence in what
our guys can do this weekend and be
yond."
None of this weekend's opponents
seem to pose much of a real threat to
the Cardinal. Oral Roberts is un
ranked, but secured its automatic bid
after winning the Mid-Continent Con
ference.
Stanford has already defeated Fres
no State once and Arizona State twice
this season.
Rut Gould won't let his team get
overconfident in the least. Not after
what transpired last spring.
Stanford breezed through the first
day, setting up a contest with confer
ence foe Washington, a team the Car
dinal had defeated 7-0 during the reg

ular season.
Cakewalk, right?
Not exactly.
The Cardinal came out uninspired
and took a bitter 4-3 loss, bowing out in
the first weekend one year after
outscoring its opponents 24-1 en route
to the NCAA title.
"We need to concentrate on getting
through this weekend first before we can
even think about the rest of the tourna
ment," Gould said. "If we l<x)k beyond
past the first one, then we're not going to
be in the second one, and so on."
If the Cardinal advances deep into
the tournament, potential opponents
include No. 7 California in the quarter
finals and No. 1 Illinois in the semifi
nals.
"The draw is what you make of it,"
Gould said. "The selection committee
seeded us fairly, where we deserved.
"It's not an easy draw, but it's certain
ly one we can work with."
A little time of! before the tourna
ment didn't hurt, either.

"We've had three weeks to regroup
from the end of the dual-match sea
son," Gould said. "We're building and
I'm very enthusiastic about our
chances.
"We ended the regular season on a
high. Hopefully we can start off on
that same high and even get a little
better."
A key to Stanford's strength this sea
son has been their dominance at the No.
3, No. 4 and No. 5 singles positions.
Freshman K.C. Corkery (49th in the na
tion), sophomore Sam Warburg (63rd)
and freshman James Fade (114 th) have
combined to post a 60-6 singles record
in dual matches.
"The middle of the lineup has been
really good all year and hopefully we can
get the bookends to come together,"
Gould said. " The sign of a champion is
to have all the cogs in the wheel churn
ing in the right way."
Gould was named the Pac-10
