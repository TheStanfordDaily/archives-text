# Card looking to repeat
## History says No. 1 Stanford water polo will probably have to take down UCLA 
### FELIPE VALDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Can they break the trend?
Can Stanford defy history and find a way
to secure both a league title and an NCAA
crown in the same season?
Each of the last two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation champions have failed to
do so. Both the Cardinal (2001) and UCLA
(2002) have finished as runner-ups in the
NCAA title game after winning the confer
ence tournament.

Ironically, the MPSFsecond-place finish
er captured the NCAA title each year: UCLA
in 2001, Stanford in 2002.
In the third installment of the Women's
Water Polo Final Four, something's got to give.
The top-ranked Cardinal (20-2) begins
its defense of the NCAA title against
fourth-seeded Indiana (26-9) tomorrow
afternoon in San Diego at 1:30 p.m. In the
second semifinal, No. 2 UCLA (21-4) will
square off against No. 3 Loyola Mary
mount (23-8) at 3 p.m.
The winners will play in the champi
onship game on Sunday at 3 p.m.
Stanford beat the Hoosiers once this sea
sonâ€” 15-3 in the Stanford Invitational in
early February.
