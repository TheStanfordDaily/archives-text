# Card looking to repeat
## History says No. 1 Stanford water polo will probably have to take down UCLA 
### FELIPE VALDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Can they break the trend?
Can Stanford defy history and find a way
to secure both a league title and an NCAA
crown in the same season?
Each of the last two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation champions have failed to
do so. Both the Cardinal (2001) and UCLA
(2002) have finished as runner-ups in the
NCAA title game after winning the confer
ence tournament.

Ironically, the MPSFsecond-place finish
er captured the NCAA title each year: UCLA
in 2001, Stanford in 2002.
In the third installment of the Women's
Water Polo Final Four, something's got to give.
The top-ranked Cardinal (20-2) begins
its defense of the NCAA title against
fourth-seeded Indiana (26-9) tomorrow
afternoon in San Diego at 1:30 p.m. In the
second semifinal, No. 2 UCLA (21-4) will
square off against No. 3 Loyola Mary
mount (23-8) at 3 p.m.
The winners will play in the champi
onship game on Sunday at 3 p.m.
Stanford beat the Hoosiers once this sea
son— 15-3 in the Stanford Invitational in
early February.

Senior Julie Gardner and the Stanford women's water polo team head to San Diego for the
Final Four this weekend. The Cardinal will be gunning for its second consecutive NCAA title.
"They were really disheveled,"
coach John Tanner said. "They re
ally hadn't had much time to come
together as a team."
Tanner also acknowledged that
Indiana has come a long way since
then.
"They've started playing really
well," he said. "They're doing great
on defense."
Indeed, the Hoosiers held offen
sive powerhouse Princeton to one
goal in an Eastern Championship
semifinal in on April 26.
The real story, however, should
be the Cardinal-Bruin clash.
The Cardinal and Bruins have
established quite a rivalry in the first
two years of the NCAA women's
water polo championships.
In 2001, Stanford lost the first

ever NCAA title 5-4 to UCLA —
ending the Cardinal's dream of a
perfect season and their eight-game
winning streak over the Bruins.
Last year, Stanford avenged that
loss with an 8-4 victor)' over UCLA.
This time, the Cardinal was the at
large team and ruined UCLA's bid
fora title.
Stanford and UCLA have al
ready faced each other four times
this year, with the Cardinal winning
three of their meetings.
The series hasn't always been so
even-handed though, relatively
speaking.
Women's water polo got its big
push in 1996 — also the year the
sport came to the Farm. For the first
five years, UCLA won four Nation
al Collegiate titles while the Cardi
nal never finished below fifth in the
nation.
But there was still an emptiness
for Stanford since it lacked the
hardware.

Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 4
Indiana at NCAA Final Four
Sunday: NCAA Title Game, 3 p.m.

"[lt seemed like] they were the
team that always won," said junior
driver Brenda Villa, who was
named MPSF Player of the Year last
week. "[But] it has shifted."
After their close meetings in the
past and the most recent nail-biter
— the MPSF title game — Tanner
is very cognizant of both team's tal
ent.
"UCLA has a great program,
wonderful players and just a great
water polo tradition," said Tanner,
who was named the MPSF Coach of
the Year. (Senior goalie Jackie
Frank was also named MPSF Goalie
of the Year.)
Several of the Stanford players
have participated on various U.S.
national teams with UCLA players

(and also know each other from
high school, club and youth nation
al teams), creating an intense yet re
spectful environment.
"They're friends and competi
tors," Tanner explained. "It
makes fora great atmosphere
where it's extremely intense but
there's a huge amount of mutual
respect."
That doesn't mean Stanford is
lacking in confidence.
"With us, everything comes
from defense," Villa said. "If we
play great defense that will give us
the opportunities we need on the
offensive end."
It's the last hurrah for Stanford
seniors Villa, Frank, Julie Gardner
and Nicole Huszcz and they want to
go out in style.
"This is it. This is the way we are
going to finish our senior year,"
Frank said. "The NCAA champi
onship... it's the ring ... It's every
thing."
