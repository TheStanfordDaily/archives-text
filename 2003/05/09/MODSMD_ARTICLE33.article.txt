# 'Appetites' gets to the heart of hunger

These last two years at Stanford have taught me a
few things about young women and their weight: The
freshman 15 is a real and actually occurring phenom
enon; five to 10 pounds of relationship flab are gained
with a long-term boyfriend; and, in stark contrast to
those observations, eating disorders are dispropor
tionately high here. College seems to be a breeding
ground for anorexia and bulimia, but is our environ
ment really to blame?
Caroline Knapp, the acclaimed feminist author
who died last year of lung cancer, answers this ques
tion and many others in her final book, "Appetites:
Why Women Want." Knapp developed anorexia as a
senior at Brown, then struggled with it for years after
ward, yet she believes that college culture alone is not
the real problem. Instead, she suggests, "We are all in
scribed ... We may be naturally fragile or resilient, nat
urally heavy or thin, inherently beautiful and distinc
tive or inherently ordinary and plain. These qualities
bump up against circumstance, family, temperament,
transforming us over time, shaping either resistance to
societal mandates or vulnerability."
Her recollection of first developing anorexia in col
lege is marked by cottage cheese. In an analysis that
hundreds of Stanford females can surely relate to, she
writes, "Cottage cheese is one of our culture's most vis
ible forms of self-denial ... on some semi-conscious
level, I knew the essential truth about cottage cheese
— it was a diet food — and on some even less conscious
level, I was drawn to it."
"Appetites" explores the myriad of confusing, often
conflicting symbols women attach to food to help un
cover why eating disorders develop. Instead of relying
on medical or social statistics to explain this complex
terrain, Knapp discusses the emotional and psychic
reasons why women feel the need to suppress their ap
petite for food and other pleasures in the first place.
Writing in an intensely personal yet never uncon
trolled style, Knapp breaks down the situation for

women — from seemingly mundane details to sweep
ing cultural judgments — so achingly well.
These personal observations achieve Knapp's goal
to find "the core, the underlying drive, the sensation
that not only made anorexia feel so seductively viable
for me some two decades ago but that also informs the
central experience of appetite for so many women, the
first feeling we bring to the table of hunger: anxiety, a

sense of being over
whelmed."
In order to discover
what drives this anxiety,
Knapp targets the usual
culprits: fashion maga

eral, Madison Avenue. However, she acknowledges,
"The truth seems to reach way past culture... down into
less visible internal corridors in which much more com
plicated interactions take place." Knapp refuses to put
the blame squarely on a single external element, diving
into areas and experiences that are difficult to translate
and easy to sentimentalize fora less skillful writer.
Knapp explores how appetite is shaped by mother
daughter relations, social lessons learned early on and
the equal-opportunity landscape many women both
relish and fear. In the end, she realizes that all these
conditions made her crave love in the misplaced form
of recognition: "Being known. This, of course, is the
goal, the agenda so carefully hidden it may be un
known even to the self. . . The anorexic starves to
make manifest her hunger and vulnerability. The ex
tremes announce, This is who I am, this is what I feel,
this is what happens when I don't get what I need."
Her explanations of the crucial why behind eating
disorders are brilliantly and beautifully constructed,
but her proposed solutions feel incomplete. Knapp re
covered through therapy, loving relationships and by
attaining a life too full to stay sick. She does not lay out
a clear formula to recovery, but perhaps this incom
pleteness is an honest reflection of how enduring neg
ative attitudes towards eating are and will be.
This book is a rare find, one of eloquence and im
portance — Knapp puts the most delicate of situations
and feelings into words that too many women will
identify with. Both sexes should read it to understand
how the female appetite has been bent to standards
outside our own and to uncover many of the reasons
why eating disorders are now the third most common
chronic illness among women in the United States.
