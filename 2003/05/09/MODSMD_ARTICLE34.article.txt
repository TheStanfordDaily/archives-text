# Ciao, bella! This girl's off to Rome
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
"Where are yon going? Why are you wearing pig
tails? Where is that cherry Lip Smacker smell coming
from?" This is probably what my roommates were
wondering when 1 headed out the door on Saturday
morning. So maybe I didn't want to admit that I was
going to see "The Lizzy McGuire Movie," but I
thought it was right to look the part. I was quite prob
ably the oldest person there (save the parents who
had brought their daughters), and 1 sat behind a
group of curly-haired cuties all decked out in tiaras.
This brings me to a second point I'm not sure I
want to admit: I kind of liked the movie. True, the
90-minute pre-teen girly-girl fantasy that is "The
Lizzy McGuire Movie" is a lot of fluff, but there's
something fresh and naive about it that makes it
worth watching.
Starring Hillary Duff, the movie is based on the
Disney Channel series about a 13-year-old middle
schooler dealing with all the heavy issues middle
schoolers deal with: boys, popularity, embarrass
ment and clothes. The beginning of the movie sees
Lizzy graduating from middle school and getting
ready fora big summer trip to Rome.
After the school graduation, where we meet
Lizzy's archenemv Karen Sanders (who dubs Lizzy

an "outfit repeater" — gasp!) and a valedictorian
speech disaster caught on tape by Lizzy's younger
brother, Matt, Lizzy and her class are on their way
to Rome. Led by Ms. Undermire, their soon-to-be
high school principal, Lizzy and her best friend
Gordon, a curly-haired do-gooder, make a pact to
"find adventures." Then it's not long before adven
ture finds Lizzy, in the form of Paolo, a 17-year-old
Italian dreamboat / recording artist superstar. Lizzy
is mistaken for Paolo's recording partner, Isabella,
who she is said to bear a strong resemblance to, ex
cept that Isabella has long black tresses, compared
to Lizzy's blonde waves.
So, right now you may think this plot sounds a lit
tle far-fetched. Well, you haven't seen anything yet.
Not only is Lizzy mistaken for an international su
perstar (which happens to me every time I go to Eu
rope . . .), not only does she romp around Rome
strutting this funky bohemian chic that makes her
look about 23 (what is this girl's wardrobe bud
get?!), not only does she sneak away from her tour
group to meet up with Paolo and hop on the back
of his Vespa scooter, but she's also asked to perform
on the International Video Music Awards, pretend
ing to be Isabella. This offer leads to more singing,
dancing and yes, wardrobe.
Lizzy has to learn Isabella's song and choreogra-

phy and gets fit
ted for the
awards show —
resulting in a

fashion show of a barrage of
gowns that would make
Alexander McQueen cringe.
This is where "The Lizzy
Maguire Movie" really takes off.
Lizzy has been sneaking away
from her school group, and the
watchful eyes of Ms. Under
mire to rendezvous with Paolo,
with Gordon covering for her.
But wait ... is Paolo to be
trusted? Would Gordon be
willing to risk being sent home
to save Lizzy? Will Hillary Duff
look really ridiculous in a black

wig and way too much mascara? The plot (and the
movie does have one), actually unfolds quite nicely.
There are a few surprises, and even a satisfying end
ing. What "The Lizzy McGuire Movie" lacks in sub
stance, it more than makes up for in lip gloss. So,
maybe I bought it, gloss and all, or maybe I'd like to
think I could go to Rome and "have adventures"
too. It's cute.



Don't you wish you had a Vespa? And a
Paolo?
