# Animation comes alive:
## Intermission talks with the creators of homestarrunner.com 
### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
You may have seen them around a
campus: a cup in Dolores 717 with
drawings of a one-armed dragon
and the words "Trogdor, The
Burninator," a sweatshirt with a squashed,
anvil-shaped cheetah named "The
Cheat," a temporary tatt(X) on the arm of
an aero-astro graduate student of a squat
character with a Mexican wrestling mask
and boxing gloves, or — the source of it all
— a bookmark in someone's browser to
www.homestarrunner.com.

The site is a compilation of animation
shorts based on a cast of about 12 original
animated characters (Homestar, Marzi
pan, Strong Bad, Strong Sad, Strong
Mad, The Cheat and Horn Sar are a few).
Shorts can vary from parodies of music
videos, games and, the most popular of all:

Strong Bad at his computer responding to
a new (real) fan's e-mail every Monday.
The site now gets 200,000 to 250,000
visitors a day, plus 3,000 to 4,000 e-mails
sent to its now main attraction, the love
ably wry, dry-mouthed, Mexican
wresding mask-wearing Strong Bad. Ju
nior Katie Buchanan says, "If I can get
Strong Bad to answer one of my e-mails, it
will be die capstone of my junior year."
Graduate student David Ngo agrees,
"It's like winning the lottery."
In arguably the most popular e-mail,
"Dragon," Strong Bad responds to a re
quest for instructions on how to draw a
dragon. His instructions include: "Draw
an'S,' then draw a more different'S.'" The
short then morphs into a parody of a
heavy metal musical video about Trogdor
(the dragon) burninating the country
side.
A reconstruction of the brilliant humor
that inspires such remarks and the several
100,000-strong fan base of the site would
be weak; a quick glance at a few of Strong
Bad's best e-mails will do you far better
(http://www.homestarrunner. com/sbe
mail.html). Some of the best are titled
"Dragon" (the home of the famous Trog
dor), "Japanese .Animation," "Flag Day"
and "Guitar." If necessary, go watch a few

of them now (they are only one to five min
utes in length), and then keep reading.
Intermission had the opportunity to
talk to the site s creators, the Chapman
brothers: Mike, 29, and Matt, 26. Beyond
the 3,000 to 4,000 e-mails Strong Bad gets
each day (of which, unfortunately, they
can only read several hundred), the broth
ers have received: pictures of a girl who
tattooed Trogdor onto her butt, pictures
of a guy who had his car repainted with a
reproduction of Trogdor and the words
"The Burninator" along the side, pictures
of a kid who made a Cheat pinata lor his
Spanish class and numerous songs in
which fans have rewritten pop songs with
Homestar tribute lyrics — "There's a
Trogdor remix that sounds like Trent
Reznor made it," Matt says,"and one guy
made a weird disco song about Homes
tar."
The brothers live in Adanta, now work
ing full-time on the site thanks to the pro
ceeds from T-shirt sales. Both studied art
in college and went on to graduate school
in the arts — Matt in film and Mike in
photography. After a few years of working
unsatisfying desk jobs, the site began to
take off in 2000, and they were able to quit
their old jobs. "That's the goal from now
on, to be employed by doing stuff that's
creative and fun," Matt says.
"We weren't trying to get fans or be
come an Internet cult thing, people just
started going to the site without us asking

them. We're not trying to make it big,
we're just trying to keep doing cool stuff
diat people like."
Mike gives the classic childhood story:
"We were both interested in animation as
kids. We did claymation and stuff when
we were 10 with our dad's camera. But
when Flash came out it gave us all sorts of
new ways to do things. You can use the

same graphics from previous cartoons."
The site is written entirely in Macrome
dia Flash, a multimedia Web authoring
tool. "With the Internet and Flash, it got so
much easier to produce a much higher
quality product — so much easier than
distributing indie comics yourself," Mike
says.
The brothers' sources of artistic inspi
ration, include, of course, "The Simp
sons," but also "Ren and Stimpy," "The
Loooney Toons," "Monty Python,"
"Spinal Tap" and, notably, the original
"Batman." "There's this one episode of
the 'Batman' '60s TV show called The
Joker Goes to School.' We just watched it
like a million times and picked apart
everything," says Matt. He also mentions
"an awesome band called 'Butch Willis
and the Rocks' who made music back in
the '70s. It's awful, but great — the so
bad-it's-good kind of stuff."
As for the actual process of working on
the side, most of the work is shared; al
though Matt does all the voices and Mike
does more of the graphics. "We're pretty
much working all the time. People have to
kind of call us and remind us to hang out,"
says Matt.

Mike says that Strong Bad definitely
gets the lion's share of the work now. They
generally run through ideas most of the
week, and then start working on the e
mail on Sunday until it's done. They de
cided to have a new Strong Bad e-mail
every Monday. "We thought it would be
easier on the tans if they knew every Mon
day there would be new stuff. [When I'm
recording Strong Bad], I kind of hunch
up, and I'm probably scowling," says Matt.
"I'm smiling with that big open mouth
when I do Homestar."
The site started with Homestar, an ex
cessively good-natured, naive, and more
or less stupid character. But gradually
Strong Bad, mostly due to the popularity
of his e-mails, became the focus. Explain
ing Strong Bad and his appearance, Mike
says,"He was originally supposed to be
the bad guy. He was the evil guy. We just
thought, wrestling mask, boxing gloves,
bad sports guy. Originally the stories were
supposed to revolve around sports races.'
The site's humor is a brilliant exercise
in satire and randomness, and its building
on the characters and their relations is the
same way one gets attached to a television
series. "We've built in idiosyncrasies,'
says Matt. "It just makes it interesting if he
[Strong Bad] is a big contradiction. And
he's a stickler for grammar. He's the most
well-rounded."
As for the future of the site, Matt says,
"One person from AOL Kids wanted to buy
Teen Girl Squad," a comic strip that ap
pears on the site making fun of stereotypical
teenage girls. "We were like, 'NO! Leave us
alone! They're ours!' They didn't even want
to pay to have us write the comic for them,
they just wanted to buy it outright."
But the brothers are not pushing right
now for anything much beyond the site as
it is. "Eventually, yeah, TV would proba
bly make sense," says Mike. "But there's
an immediacy and spontaneity to the writ
ing that I don't think you'd ever see with a
TV show that gets pnxluced six months
before it goes on the air. We'll do DVDs
and other cool stuff to continue to ex
pand."
