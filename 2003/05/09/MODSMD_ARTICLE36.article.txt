# Concerts and hippies and beer — oh my!
## Intermission's take on Coachella 
### ILYA BEYLIN 
Once a year, thousands of teens and 20-somethings
descend into Southern California for the Coachella
Valley Music and Arts Festival. They put on clothes
that would upset their mothers, wait fora few hours in
the parking lot traffic before presenting their tickets
and entering the gates to 78 acres of pristine lawn,
which they then ecstatically trample to the festival's
contemporary beats. Rolling Stone dubbed it"the best
American festival," and the British music magazine
NME called it "probably the best festival in the world."
This year was no exception. On April 27 and 28, an es
timated 70,000 attendees came to the Coachella Festi
val to hear the Beastie Boys, Ben Harper, The Lib
ertines, Blur, Talib Kweli, Underworld, Jack Johnson,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Stripes, Fischerspoon
er, G Love and Special Sauce, Peanut Butter Wolf,
Blue Man Group and over 60 other bands.
Though officially it's a music and art festival, few come
for die bric-a-brac booths and hologram paintings. This
year there was even a "film festival" — or a small tent
with a projector playing bandograpies and other videos
shot with hand-helds. Unfortunately, since the days were
hot and the tent had little ventilation, the film festival
smelled like one rank accident. Fortunately, this encour
aged many to remember the bands.
The Beastie Boys headlined on Saturday. Perhaps
too much was expected from these four middle-aged
men wearing sweatshirts who once inspired middle
school suns to shine and boys to scrawl in restrooms.
After a heartbreakitigly nostalgic rendition of "Sabo
tage," the group that once fought for our right to party
stopped the set to mumble about the president's ter
ror. A girl from the front row shrieked approval and
waved a Swedish flag. Close to her, a boy imagined
these people in voting booths and shuddered. Then,
20 seconds into "Brass Monkey," they taunted, "You
want to hear more, don't you?" and switched to a new
song. However frustrating it must be fora group to be
identified with their past style and accomplishments,
they can not expect audience appreciation unless they
either innovate or play their singles.
Two bands stood out on Saturday's main stage: 'Hie
Hives and Blur. The Hives performance mocked the
best in autocratic rock. Lead vocalist Howlin Pelle,
dressed like Bowie, seemed totally unembarrassed to be
the center of massive attention. He splashed water and
teased "the California hippies," playfully antagonizing
the crowd while the band played tunes more catchy
than severe acute respiratory syndrome hysteria.
While The Hives performed, Blur made music.
Lead singer Damon Albarn had returned from Mali
with new energy and influence, adding a strand a funk
to their wound and frayed noise rock. The way Blur
evolves music from a primordial discord and the way
their noise on stage becomes a melody, allow the audi
ence a glimpse of that creative moment which sepa
rates spectacle from art. Backed by a rhythmically
screeching chorus, Albarn sustained that moment for
an hour. Blur's performance exposed the failure of the
many noise bands that fail to achieve that moment and
never move beyond sound. On Sun
day, the German electronic rebels Mouse on Mars ri
valed the Blue Man Group for the concert's most un
usual performance. Jan St. Werner and Andi Thorn
brought out a table, a laptop and a feast of buttons,
knobs and wires that they mangled for an hour while
revealing the complexity behind what's otherwise
known as synthetic crap. There was a lot of other elec
tronic music at the concert, though only Jan and Andi
succeeded in performing it as an act of human expres
sion. The piano plays as loud as the key is pressed, the
guitar string can reverberate the finger's angst or
anger, but the button does not register intent.

Perry Farrell of Porno for Pyros and Jane's Addic
tion fame made a surprise appearance on Sunday. In
the two years since he's left Jane's Addiction, Farrell
has abandoned his guitar and showmanship fora
turntable and a 7-year-old dancing princess. His audi
ence was small, and he seemed delighted that anyone
at all was there to groove and listen.
Whatever the relationship between Meg and Jack
White of the White Stripes, they made some great music
together on Sunday. They played guitar and drummed
loud and hard, combined blues, punk and classic rock
and sang about how hard it is to love. Somehow they
addedjust enough frustration and sarcasm to sentiment
to make their plaintive pop OK to like. Musically, they
were entwined and radiated ajuvenile delight in the at
tention of the stage — a gratitude the autocratic Hives
denied and the Beastie Boys lost years ago. An audience
member described them as "fucking awesome."

Fischerspooner gave the concert's most fabulous
performance while the Red Hot Chili I'eppers closed
out the main stage. Inspired by the best in exhibition
ism, the synth-rock duo of Warren Fischer and Casey
Spooner brought stunning cabaret girls, fog machines,
giant fans, strobes, a rainbow of lights, sequin bombs,
bubble blowers, a convulsing man who spat blood at the
audience, all sorts of revealing costumes and an epic

synthesizer sound. After
they opened with "Invisi
ble," Fischer launched
himself into the crowd,
surfing 20 yards in before
turning around. Though
there was litde to listen to
besides "Emerge," which
they played twice, there
was much to see. Fischer
unabashedly changed
from costume to costume
on stage and their melo
dramatic choreography
was grand.
The most striking
thing about Coachella is
neither the weird desert
terrain nor the amazing
music — it's standing in a
field surrounded by
70,000 young people. It's
an odd feeling being one
in a mob of thousands —
one concertgoer de
scribed it as "tribal." In
side the festival it's just
like MTV.
But those who made it
through the gates already

left some of the freakiest freaks behind. The freaks are
easily distracted. They cannot navigate the endless
parking lot to some promised concert arena. Freaks get
lost in the stacks of rotting cars. Hoards of them wander
through the massive lots selling and buying used snake
oils. Car alarms shriek, RVs blare music, hippies sell
beers and baked goods, and men train cameras on rev
elers hoping for indiscretions. In line, a stranger sug
gested: "A man can survive for two days on protein
powder and smokes," though at the gate his powder was
confiscated and his opened cigarette pack emptied. The
man was seen later, clutching his abdomen and eating a
taco.
Inside the festival it's calmer. If one can only come
one day, miss Saturday. By Sunday, all those who take
too much, who had the grandest prank, who wanted
to expose themselves to thousands, have finished
doing what they came to do. Everything seems calmer
then and smoother — except the beer garden.
If the inside of Coachella is like MTV, the inside of
the beer garden is like "The Real Cancun." Toffee
Dawson, a loyal beer garden patron and Stanford
alumni, described it as "a paradise to rival Paradise."
At 6:05 p.m. on Sunday, paradise ran out of Heineken.
Then the world became more muted — lost all its yel
lows, oranges and reds — before collapsing. Nobody
wanted to pay $6 dollars fora Bud; grown men began
to cry, and boys began to grumble revolution. This
lasted for about two minutes, after which the frat party
roared back into full gear. "It was a tragedy, but one
must learn to forgive," remembers Dawson. At mid
night the beer garden closed its plastic gates, and peo
ple's wristbands turned back into pumpkins. They say
that some never left that beer garden. Some are still
searching fora way back.


The lovely, lovely ladies of the Fischerspooner show


Meg and Jack, fresh off their week-long stint on "Conan
O'Brien," thrill the crowd with their weirdness.

NME called it "probably the best festival in the world."
This year was no exception. On April 27 and 28, an es
timated 70,000 attendees came to the Coachella Festi
val to hear the Beastie Boys, Ben Harper, The Lib
ertines, Blur, Talib Kweli, Underworld, Jack Johnson,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Stripes, Fischerspoon
er, G Love and Special Sauce, Peanut Butter Wolf,
Blue Man Group and over 60 other bands.
Though officially it's a music and art festival, few come
for die bric-a-brac booths and hologram paintings. This
year there was even a "film festival" — or a small tent
with a projector playing bandograpies and other videos
shot with hand-helds. Unfortunately, since the days were
hot and the tent had little ventilation, the film festival
smelled like one rank accident. Fortunately, this encour
aged many to remember the bands.
The Beastie Boys headlined on Saturday. Perhaps
too much was expected from these four middle-aged
men wearing sweatshirts who once inspired middle
school suns to shine and boys to scrawl in restrooms.
After a heartbreakitigly nostalgic rendition of "Sabo
tage," the group that once fought for our right to party
stopped the set to mumble about the president's ter
ror. A girl from the front row shrieked approval and
waved a Swedish flag. Close to her, a boy imagined
these people in voting booths and shuddered. Then,
20 seconds into "Brass Monkey," they taunted, "You
want to hear more, don't you?" and switched to a new
song. However frustrating it must be fora group to be
identified with their past style and accomplishments,
they can not expect audience appreciation unless they
either innovate or play their singles.
Two bands stood out on Saturday's main stage: 'Hie
Hives and Blur. The Hives performance mocked the
best in autocratic rock. Lead vocalist Howlin Pelle,
dressed like Bowie, seemed totally unembarrassed to be
the center of massive attention. He splashed water and
teased "the California hippies," playfully antagonizing
the crowd while the band played tunes more catchy
than severe acute respiratory syndrome hysteria.
While The Hives performed, Blur made music.
Lead singer Damon Albarn had returned from Mali
with new energy and influence, adding a strand a funk
to their wound and frayed noise rock. The way Blur
evolves music from a primordial discord and the way
their noise on stage becomes a melody, allow the audi
ence a glimpse of that creative moment which sepa
rates spectacle from art. Backed by a rhythmically
screeching chorus, Albarn sustained that moment for
an hour. Blur's performance exposed the failure of the
many noise bands that fail to achieve that moment and
never move beyond sound. On Sun
day, the German electronic rebels Mouse on Mars ri
valed the Blue Man Group for the concert's most un
usual performance. Jan St. Werner and Andi Thorn
brought out a table, a laptop and a feast of buttons,
knobs and wires that they mangled for an hour while
revealing the complexity behind what's otherwise
known as synthetic crap. There was a lot of other elec
tronic music at the concert, though only Jan and Andi
succeeded in performing it as an act of human expres
sion. The piano plays as loud as the key is pressed, the
guitar string can reverberate the finger's angst or
anger, but the button does not register intent.

Perry Farrell of Porno for Pyros and Jane's Addic
tion fame made a surprise appearance on Sunday. In
the two years since he's left Jane's Addiction, Farrell
has abandoned his guitar and showmanship fora
turntable and a 7-year-old dancing princess. His audi
ence was small, and he seemed delighted that anyone
at all was there to groove and listen.
Whatever the relationship between Meg and Jack
White of the White Stripes, they made some great music
together on Sunday. They played guitar and drummed
loud and hard, combined blues, punk and classic rock
and sang about how hard it is to love. Somehow they
addedjust enough frustration and sarcasm to sentiment
to make their plaintive pop OK to like. Musically, they
were entwined and radiated ajuvenile delight in the at
tention of the stage — a gratitude the autocratic Hives
denied and the Beastie Boys lost years ago. An audience
member described them as "fucking awesome."

Fischerspooner gave the concert's most fabulous
performance while the Red Hot Chili I'eppers closed
out the main stage. Inspired by the best in exhibition
ism, the synth-rock duo of Warren Fischer and Casey
Spooner brought stunning cabaret girls, fog machines,
giant fans, strobes, a rainbow of lights, sequin bombs,
bubble blowers, a convulsing man who spat blood at the
audience, all sorts of revealing costumes and an epic

synthesizer sound. After
they opened with "Invisi
ble," Fischer launched
himself into the crowd,
surfing 20 yards in before
turning around. Though
there was litde to listen to
besides "Emerge," which
they played twice, there
was much to see. Fischer
unabashedly changed
from costume to costume
on stage and their melo
dramatic choreography
was grand.
The most striking
thing about Coachella is
neither the weird desert
terrain nor the amazing
music — it's standing in a
field surrounded by
70,000 young people. It's
an odd feeling being one
in a mob of thousands —
one concertgoer de
scribed it as "tribal." In
side the festival it's just
like MTV.
But those who made it
through the gates already

left some of the freakiest freaks behind. The freaks are
easily distracted. They cannot navigate the endless
parking lot to some promised concert arena. Freaks get
lost in the stacks of rotting cars. Hoards of them wander
through the massive lots selling and buying used snake
oils. Car alarms shriek, RVs blare music, hippies sell
beers and baked goods, and men train cameras on rev
elers hoping for indiscretions. In line, a stranger sug
gested: "A man can survive for two days on protein
powder and smokes," though at the gate his powder was
confiscated and his opened cigarette pack emptied. The
man was seen later, clutching his abdomen and eating a
taco.
Inside the festival it's calmer. If one can only come
one day, miss Saturday. By Sunday, all those who take
too much, who had the grandest prank, who wanted
to expose themselves to thousands, have finished
doing what they came to do. Everything seems calmer
then and smoother — except the beer garden.
If the inside of Coachella is like MTV, the inside of
the beer garden is like "The Real Cancun." Toffee
Dawson, a loyal beer garden patron and Stanford
alumni, described it as "a paradise to rival Paradise."
At 6:05 p.m. on Sunday, paradise ran out of Heineken.
Then the world became more muted — lost all its yel
lows, oranges and reds — before collapsing. Nobody
wanted to pay $6 dollars fora Bud; grown men began
to cry, and boys began to grumble revolution. This
lasted for about two minutes, after which the frat party
roared back into full gear. "It was a tragedy, but one
must learn to forgive," remembers Dawson. At mid
night the beer garden closed its plastic gates, and peo
ple's wristbands turned back into pumpkins. They say
that some never left that beer garden. Some are still
searching fora way back.


The lovely, lovely ladies of the Fischerspooner show


Meg and Jack, fresh off their week-long stint on "Conan
O'Brien," thrill the crowd with their weirdness.

Once a year, thousands of teens and 20-somethings
descend into Southern California for the Coachella
Valley Music and Arts Festival. They put on clothes
that would upset their mothers, wait fora few hours in
the parking lot traffic before presenting their tickets
and entering the gates to 78 acres of pristine lawn,
which they then ecstatically trample to the festival's
contemporary beats. Rolling Stone dubbed it"the best
American festival," and the British music magazine
NME called it "probably the best festival in the world."
