# Baby, Evan Dando is back
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
The awkward teenage years — which I suffered through
with gusto — were distinguished by three Avril Lavigne-ap
proved activities: vandalizing property with comely anarchy
signs, scowling and tearing pictures of my favorite bands out
of Rolling Stone magazine. The weekly rag was the only
thing we could get our hands on in the old country and
whenever it appeared in our meager school library — once
a month at most, due to an ever-efficient German postal sys

tem — my angsty friends

and I would descend
upon it like vultures. The
more obscure the band,

the more likelv we were to

attach great importance to

them, even if we never actually listened to their music. We
made covert pilgrimages to the record shop to buy albums
by bands called Sleepyhead and Wool, never admitting that
their status might have remained underground fora rea
son. A band like the Lemonheads was absolutely unthink
able. To us, they were worse sell-outs than Green Day. Sev
enteen magazine — a magazine that unapologetically used
the word hunk before irony became hip — had gone so far
as to auction off prom dates with the Lemonheads' dashing
front-man, Evan Dando, who looked like he actually
washed his hair. I didn't even need to listen to their music to
know that it was really, really uncool.
Years later — anarchy si n r ns now replaced with preten
tious poetry quotations — a friend re-introduced me to
the Lemonheads and I realized, rather predictably, that I
had been wrong all along. Dando's voice — that voice —
sweet and delicious, yet absolutely resolute, the lyrics near
ly perfect in their loopy lucidity. But by this point, the
Lemonheads had fizzled out: Their last album "Car But
ton Cloth" was released in 1996, and there would be no
more. Dando had gone off the deep end, and that was that.
No one seems to be able to speak about the Lemon
heads without referring heavily to Dando's antics —
drugs, Courtney Love, canceled performances, Bijou
Phillips, arrests, drugs, drugs and more drugs. To be fair,
there doesn't appear to be much of a gap between the
singer's personal life and his songs — he seemed to have
no control over exposing his vulnerability through his

music. The press lapped up the details of his happily
decadent existence only to lynch him later by the same
token. Ynd while Dando claims to have learned a little cir
cumspection these days, he's not the type of self-flagellat
ing rocker regretting "Behind the Music"-style the foot
loose and fancy-free "impatience fora new sensation" of
yesteryear. Even on "Baby I'm Bored," it is clear that his
excesses were less about escaping from than lusting after
life: "I can't believe how far I slipped, but secretly I'm glad
I did," he sings in "All My Life."
It's been a bloody long time. Seven years to be exact,
and we've been waiting for exactly this — "Baby I'm
Bored" — all the while. Dando started work on his solo
project nearly four years ago: There were entire acoustic
country albums that were thrown out before this gem
emerged. One of this album's best, "Waking Up," a bril
liant nonsensical piece featuring a wailing Royston Lang
don and a great deal of clapping in the background, was
recorded and completed in the spring of 2000, but it took
three more springs for the rest to come together as it has.
Dando is helped along by a number of brilliant collabora
tors, most notably Ben Lee, the original Dando minion
who wrote the song "I Wish I Was Him" of the Lemon
heads as a teenager and is now responsible for two of the
best songs on "Baby I'm Bored" — "All My Life" and
"Hard Drive."
"Baby I'm Bored" is the album we expected Dando to
make, the songs he was always supposed to sing. They seem
eerily familiar — not in their lack of originality or pre
dictability — but in the way they perfectly and simply fit.
Happily married and allegedly sober, this is a calmer and
grown-up Dando, one who is more than usually reflective.
The songs themselves are sharp, raucous and lovely. But
most importantly, they are still full of mischief.


He washes his hair? Are you sure about that?
