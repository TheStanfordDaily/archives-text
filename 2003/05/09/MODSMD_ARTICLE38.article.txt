# NY trio good enough for all their 'Yeahs'

OK, so I'm as tired of hearing and reading
about the "garage rock revival" (or, even more
ridiculously, the "rock revival") as anyone else —

' . ' . . 1
hell, I'm already as bored with the inevitable

Strokes backlash as I am with the band itself. But al
though it feels (as many have noted) a little odd to
group bands as wildly disparate in purpose and
background as The White Stripes, The Vines and
The Hives under the heading of one movement, it's
nice to see that no-frills, low-tech rock has come
back into fashion. It is pretty damn cool that the
mass media are lavishing praise on artists that would
have been labeled hopelessly noncommercial a few
years ago, and if nothing else, the "revival" has re
minded us how much ass a band can kick with just
drums and a guitar.
Case in point: "Fever to Tell," the first full
length album from New York trio The Yeah Yeah
Yeahs. Together, singer Karen O, guitarist Nick
Zinner and drummer Brian Chase probably com
prise the best of the bands to have risen to promi
nence on The Strokes / White Stripes media wave.
They're smarter than The Hives, more visceral
than The Strokes and, when everything clicks (as it
does on the first half of "Fever to Tell," which is
much faster and harder rocking than the tracks on
the band's self-titled EP), The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are
absolutely shit-hot, with songs that burn with tran
scendent energy and excitement.
Much of the credit for the beautiful ruckus that
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs create must go to Zinner and
Chase, who play their instruments with wild, frantic
desperation — as with The White Stripes, the band's

small size hasn't caused any weak
ness in sound. However, the spotlight
clearly belongs to O. I think the band
leader she most closely resembles isn't
Julian Casablancas or Jack White, but
the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten —
both singers fronted formidably tal
ented bands but managed to domi
nate the music with their "fuck you"
attitudes and utterly distinctive voic
es.
Where Rotten's lyrics dripped with
contempt for both himself and his au
diences, O is way more conflicted —

he's like a manic depressive, alternately teasing and
taunting. But whether boasting "I gotta man who
makes me wanna kill," cooing / shrieking "You make
me wanna 100-hoo-hoo-hoose" or playfully sneering,
"Boy you just a stupid bitch and girl you just a no good
dick," O never sounds bored, and she attacks every
line with an almost terrifying intensity.
Although the album starts off with "Rich," which is
(fora Yeah Yeah Yeahs song) kind of slow, things re
ally kick into gear with the second track, "Date With
the Night." There's a five-song stretch of high speed
and spirits — each track starts off at a drunken dash
for the finish line and never lets up; only two of those
five songs even cross the two-minute mark.
Unfortunately, things get more somber in the sec-

ond half of "Fever to Tell," and the band turns re
flective. While I'm glad that The Yeah Yeah Yeahs
are trying to stretch themselves, the sad fact is they
haven't figured out how to make their slower songs
distinctive — there's nothing that violendy seizes
your attention and burns itself onto your brain the
way, say, earlier tracks "Tick" or "Black Tongue" do.
Plus, even when the band is at the absolute top of its
form, I still get the sneaking suspicion that we're not
hearing anything we haven't heard before.
But such reservations can seem almost irrelevant:
When you're listening to the loud, infectious master
piece "Date With the Night," you'll be too busy shak
ing your ass (or, at the very least, bobbing your head)
for any doubts to cross your mind.


Anthony thinks that chick is a real pistol.
