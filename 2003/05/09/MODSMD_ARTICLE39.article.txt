# Yorn's latest is worth remembering
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
Oh how I love love love Pete
Yorn's debut album, "music
forthemorningafter," which I af
fectionately call "theCDthat
changedmylife." I have physical
ly forced friends to listen to it, to
be bewitched by Yorn — in my
fondest vision, I deliver burned
copies of the disc to deserving
outstretched hands, and all are
forever grateful as strains of
"Life on a Chain" weave pat
terns in the sky.
So I was understandably
eager, in a gently obsessive way,
to hear Yorn's follow-up album,
"Day I Forgot." After many-a
spin, it is safe to say that my life
remains unchanged. But hey, I
have a real nice life. Sure, it's not
as tenaciously compelling as
"musicforthemorningafter," but
it's a solid effort nonetheless.
"Day I Forgot" cements Yorn's
artistic style and talent and
proves that he's no fluke, a wor
thy achievement for any sopho
more effort.
Yorn, my personal favorite
among Winona Ryder's string of
musically gifted exes, sticks to his
previous formula in"Day I For
got" — songs driven by acoustic
and electric guitars, the beat
punctuated keenly by drums all
the while. It sounds very dull, I
know, but it's his voice that ele
vates it all. Yorn's voice is lazy,
shadow)' and enticing all at once
— it's Jordan Catalano in vocal
form. It borders on despondent,
but never quite gets there be
cause somehow you can tell that
he still gives a damn.
"Long Way Down" is a prime
example of how heartwrench
ingly convincing Yorn can be.
After hearing him peel off the
opening lines: "I don't love you /
So why should I compete with

Day

other guys?" I
quickly became entranced by his
downcast frankness and
thought: Yeah . .. why should /
compete with other guys ? I don't love
you either, you know.
The brief but elegant "Turn
of the Century" is one of Yorn's
sparest and finest tracks with the
great intro, "Saw my reflection,
covered in glass / How it re
minds me of you / Broken like a
vision, an unfinished season."
His voice is weightiest in this
song, close to palpably stream
ing from the speakers.
Other, less contemplative
songs like "Carlos (Don't Let it
Get to Your Head)" and "Burri
to" are the most energetic that
Yorn has performed yet. "Burn
to" has a weird quasi-emo charm
that manages to succeed as Yorn
asks, "Do you want to take a walk
outside? / If you want a burrito /
You can have another bite of
mine / It could last you forever."
Both songs work well in feverish
bursts, injecting the album with
an upbeat sound that his previ
ous effort lacked.
However, the harsh truth is
that "musicforthemorningafter"
didn't need any breaks from the
formula. It was a more cohesive
disc, one where track after track
melted and swirled into each
other with delicious ease and an
absence of monotony. Unfortu
nately, "Day I Forgot" isn't as
complete. There are tracks here
that are fairly indistinguishable
from one another and choruses
that remain forgettable. When
the album ended, I didn't feel
satisfied, I felt surprised. Did
(Mlbody actually he'.. / / tracks?
Wfwedidthn go?
Par' of the problem is
that the lyrics don't deliver a
consistent impact song after
song. The same emotions
seem to be evoked, leaving
; tiie listener pining and remi
. rusting over and over again.
;; v Still, "Day I Forgot" shows a
;§ lot of promise from this twen-
K|y-something singer. Thus,
Ijpiy visions of Yorn-topia live
l&n, with this album serving as
pit sturdy building block to a
