## New director formerly worked for HR in private sector 
### GENEVIEVE GUZMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Diane Peck, a University of Southern Cal
ifornia graduate, will start at Stanford as the
new executive director of human resources
on May 19.
During the nationwide effort to fill the po
sition, Randy Livingston, the University vice

president for business affairs and chief finan
cial officer, explained that the University
"went through a very comprehensive
search" fora qualified candidate.
Livingston said that Peck's dedication to
professional growth and staff development is
part of what made her a unique candidate.
"We interviewed at least 13 or 14 different
candidates for the position," he said.
"[Peck's] values are a wonderful match for
Stanford."
Peck said that she was told about
the job by a colleague with whom
she had worked.
"I was looking fora position in
the non-profit sector," she said.
"This opportunity came up while
networking with people I'd
worked with in the past."
At Stanford, Feck's responsibili
ties will include compensation and
benefits, training and organization
al development, staffing, human re
sources client services and informa

tion systems, and employee and
labor relations for the approximate
ly 13,000 employees of the Stanford
campus and the Stanford Linear-
Accelerator Center.
Livingston said that Feck, who
was senior vice president of
human resources at Safeway Inc.
for nine years, has had a broad
range of experience overseeing
complex organizations. She has
worked for four retail companies,
in both the private and public sec
tors, during her career in human
resources before accepting the
position at Stanford.
In discussing how her human
resources work at a company will

relate to her work at Stanford, Peck
said, "There will be some similari
ties in the areas of how you recruit
and retain a really first-class group
of people for the work that needs to
be done."
However, Peck noted an impor
tant contrast, in that the objective
of a large corporation is reporting
earnings to shareholders every
quarter, whereas a university
thinks in the long term.
"The focus and mission of uni
versity is very different," she said.
"Retail companies ... all have the
same focus of meeting sales and
profit targets. I wanted an experi
ence in which the contribution

that's being made lias a purpose
that is for nie more fulfilling anci
makes me feel that I'm giving back.
"In a university environment,
there will be a focus on the things
that will be right for today as well
as for many tomorrows, because
this is a legacy we're leaving be
hind," she continued. "It's not just
a job."
