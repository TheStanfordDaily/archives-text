# 'X2' exceeds expectations

### CHRIS LEE 
Those folks at Marvel Comics must be be
side themselves. Keepers of a waning comic
book industry just a few years ago, they ve
suddenly exploded into the hottest thing this
side of the movie business." Blade," "Spider-
Man" and even "Daredevil" have all opened
number one at the box office, with Ang Lee's
"Hulk" (a juxtaposition that will have to be
seen to be believed) waiting in die wings.
So it might be a moot point that "X2: X-
Men United" is actually a good movie; mil-

lions will see it regardless

of the reviews,,
drawn in by the
fantastic world of
mutant super
heroes and their
equally scaled dra
mas. But good it is,
and arguably the
cream of the comic

book crop, thanks to Bryan Singer's as
sured direction of the film.
What stalled 2000 s "X-Men" was a
transparent need to juggle mainstream ap
peal with its inherendy cheeky source ma
terial. The result was an entertaining but
muted effort focused on introducing the
main characters and die world they inhab
ited in as inoffensive a manner as possible.
"X2" is a bold step in the right direction.
Gone is the sense that we're still stuck in pro
logue; this moviejumps right into the action
from the beginning, exposing its predeces
sor for the thin one-act it was. The plot re
volves around a vengeful military comman
der named William Stryker (Brian Cox)
who, after a mutant assassination attempt
on the president, takes it upon himself to
cleanse the world of mutant kind. To do
this, he will need to use lan McKellan s Mag
neto (still trapped in his plastic prison from
the first movie), as well as harness the pow
ers of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart).
The rest of the huge cast is back as well, with
perennial favorite Wolverine (the charis
matic Hugh Jackman) taking center stage.
The ingenious twist of the movie is to
bring both sides of mutants together to
combat the threat of Stryker and his assis
tant Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a female

version of Wolverine. This allows us to root
for the cool baddies (Magneto and Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos's Mystique) just as much as
the X-Men.
If the film has one major failing, though,
it's the endless deluge of characters and
subplots it has to work with. Singer suc
ceeds in incorporating every character into
the story, but it does feel ready to burst at
the seams. Halle Berry as Storm still gets lit
tle more to do than sit pretty and channel
lightning, and the younger generation of
X-Men (led by Anna Paquin s Rogue) seem
like they could use their own movie. Toss in
more new characters like Nightcrawler,
Iceman and Pyro and you can see how the
film might be spinning too many plates at
the same time. By the end of it all, you'll still
feel like you re just getting started.

Even so, Singer's strategy is winning, es
chewing flagrant style to play the story as
straight as possible, and his confident pa
tience with die mythology of the characters
is something other franchises could learn
from (ahem, Mr. Lucas). The entire cast
turns in good performances, and the script
never gives you an opportunity to cringe.
Many will applaud the increase in action se
quences — particularly a piercing en
counter between Wolverine and Death
strike that 11 leave you wincing for hours —
but it's the human themes that give the
movie real heft. That love triangle between
Wolverine, Jean Grey and Cyclops will get
you every time (maybe even more this time),
and the franchise's noble message — to not
fear those who are different — remains as
simple as it is true.


Marsden's Cyclops sees the light.
