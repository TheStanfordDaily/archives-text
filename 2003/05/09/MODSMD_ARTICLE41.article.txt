# Malkovich directs a graceful 'Dancer'
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
John Malkovich's directorial
debut is so self-assured that one
wonders why he bothers acting. Au
diences have grown to love his
brooding and skulking meany ways,
and more than one film was spared
total humiliation by his schemish
charm, but frankly I've always
found it a bit tiresome: too camp
and repetitive. Of course, most of
what we readily associate with his
work is not really testament to his
broader capacities. Trained as a
stage actor, he spent most of the '70s
and '80s directing and acting with
the Steppenwolf Theatre Compa
ny, thankfully doing none of the
complex character work displayed
in films like "Con Air." But such is
the film industry: You can complain
about being typecast, or you can get
paid. So Malkovich wisely took the
reigns himself and turned out a qui
etly powerful film that took eight
years to land on our screens — and
the Spanish production company
that paid for it still hates it.
"The Dancer Upstairs" tells the
story of Augustin Rejas, a lawyer
turned-policeman (he wanted to
practice a more honest version of
the law ) and his 12-year hunt fora
guerrilla leader who goes by Eze

quiel. The story, taken from

Nicholas Shakespeare's
eponymous book, is loosely V
based on the Maoist Shin
ing Path movement in Peru
and its founder, Abimael
Guzman, who was arrested
in 1992 above a Lima b;illet
studio. Both the book and

film (with a script also by Shake
speare) however, maintain the no
tion that the story could have taken
place anywhere in Latin America;
the first frame refers to "a city in a
country in South America."
Malkovich calls it"the country of
don't know—a gray place where we
don't know if it is sunny or cloudy,
or who is good or bad. If it's raining
on our heads, we don't know."
Apart from attaching the original
author to the project, Malkovich
achieved a great coup in landing
Javier Bardem as his leading man,
Rejas. Bardem, indisputably one of
the best actors around, is notorious
ly picky. Unwittingly then, "The
Dancer Upstairs" becomes an ode to
Bardem, who carries the whole
world in his soft eyelids. Even as his
squad swan about in Hawaiian
shirted glory, Rejas insists on wear
ing a suit in the sweltering heat. He
hunches over into his large frame,
vainly attempting to blend into the

background, observing
calmly, speaking only
when he must Shake
speare's quipped and
comically British dia
logue in his gentle All
- growl. He his
an awkward confidence
— a center that does

not sway. Neither insecurity nor
pomposity propels him.
In a particularly telling sceoe that
opens with four gorgeous Amazoiu
ans in school uniforms wielding
Uzis, Malkovich (and Shakespeare)
show us their notion of modern
heroism. By accident, Rejas has wit
nessed a horrific bloodbath which
leaves several dead and one assassin
with her face shot off. He knows he
is risking his life to follow these girls
to their hideout, but he also knows
they will bring him closer to his tar
get, so he stumbles after them. Qui
etly, he shunts the young children
playing outside to safety and finds
himself doing a one-man razzia. He
pulls out his gun to enter the house,
but the weapon shakes visibly in his
hand: His courage wavers. He could
be responsible for killing a child who
did not know any better but to be
swept up in Ezekiel s rhetoric or be
killed himself. Rejas' heroism is full
of fear and sorrow but driven by

deep conviction. Not moralistic, not
a cowboy guided by automatic trig
gers; he doesn t have all the answers,
but gets on with it because he some
how senses that it's right.
The title is misleading, because it
suggests the story is about the rene
gade guerrilla leader rather than his
pursuant. Despite the fact that Rejas
is unreasonably obsessed with cap
turing Ezekiel, we are never given
enough information on the leader
to understand why he inspired so
many to kill and wreak havoc on his
behalf. This is a story of corruption

along all lines — in the government,
in the police force, Ezekiel's own
and Rejas' drive to avoid it. But it is
also a story of loss: Rejas makes the
decision to fall in love, and it turns
out to be the wrong one.
This is a serenely beautiful film:
Malkovich captures all the right de
tails without insisting on them ex
cessively. It moves at a steady pace,
gathering momentum delicately as
it swoops towards die final appre
hension. Let us hope it won't take
another eight years before
Malkovich's follow-up.
