Students will have the op
portunity tonight to dance the
night away at the 10th annual
Big Dance. The event, held in
both Roble gyms and the adja
cent courtyard, is expected to
draw about 500 people.
Those who are able to make
it through the night — the
dance runs from 9 p.m. to 6
a.m. — will get to write their
names on an "all-nighters" list
and be in a group photo taken
in the morning.
Students who attend a total
of three big dances are reward
ed with the "triple crown
award."
"Many students do it year
after year," said senior Evan
Parker, the publicity director
of the event. "Each year we
get about 40 triple crowners. I
believe we have three people

this year who will have attend
ed all 10 years since it began.
Many people keep coming
back after graduating from
Stanford, Hying in from all
over the country."
The theme this year is "Big
Dance Dance Revolution," for
which the dance will have four
Sony Playstations with sensor
pads set up for people to
dance on while playing the
video game "Dance Dance
Revolution."
According to Parker, a final
competition to determine the
best "Dance Dance Revolution"
players will be shown on a pro
jection screen.
As for actual dancing, the
event will feature many types,
including swing, waltz, salsa,
night-club two step, disco, hus
tle, polka and line dancing.
