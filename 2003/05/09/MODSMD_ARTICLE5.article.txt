# Annual Big Dance starts this evening
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students will have the op
portunity tonight to dance the
night away at the 10th annual
Big Dance. The event, held in
both Roble gyms and the adja
cent courtyard, is expected to
draw about 500 people.
Those who are able to make
it through the night — the
dance runs from 9 p.m. to 6
a.m. — will get to write their
names on an "all-nighters" list
and be in a group photo taken
in the morning.
Students who attend a total
of three big dances are reward
ed with the "triple crown
award."
"Many students do it year
after year," said senior Evan
Parker, the publicity director
of the event. "Each year we
get about 40 triple crowners. I
believe we have three people

this year who will have attend
ed all 10 years since it began.
Many people keep coming
back after graduating from
Stanford, Hying in from all
over the country."
The theme this year is "Big
Dance Dance Revolution," for
which the dance will have four
Sony Playstations with sensor
pads set up for people to
dance on while playing the
video game "Dance Dance
Revolution."
According to Parker, a final
competition to determine the
best "Dance Dance Revolution"
players will be shown on a pro
jection screen.
As for actual dancing, the
event will feature many types,
including swing, waltz, salsa,
night-club two step, disco, hus
tle, polka and line dancing.
However, Parker stressed
that there is "no experience neces
sary."
Social Dance Instructor
Richard Powers, Class of'7o, said
that he started the first Big Dance
10 years ago to re-create tradition
al dance marathons. Originally,
the Big Dance was 13 hours long
and more structured around
competition.
"During the night there were a
host of competitions, perfor
mances and games," said Ryan
Knotts, Class of '96, one of the
three people who have attended
all of the Big Dances. "Entrants
were numbered and there were
referees on rollerblades to enforce
the rules for competitors. Since
the first Big Dance was a
marathon competition, the idea
was to invite a team from Berke
ley. Thus, like 'Big Game' and 'Big
Swim,' we got the name 'Big
Dance.' "
Miriam Attia, Class of '02
added, "One of the great things
about dancing here at Stanford is
that it is so easy to get into. Every

year, many people come to Big
Dance as their first experience
with dancing, dragged along by a
significant other or a group of
friends, and end up loving it and
getting into it later."
Three bands will be at the Big
Dance. The Backswing Big Band"
will play classic swing songs from
the 19205. The other two groups,
Calliope House and The Guppies,
will perform contra dance music.
Attia described contra as a
dance in which "partners stand in
long lines and dance a pattern of
weaving figures around each
other as they are called [out over a
microphone]."
In addition to the bands, 10
Stanford dance groups will per
form during the evening — Al
liance, Cardinal Whirlwinds,
decadence, Double or Nothing,
dVB, L@s Salser@s, Martial Arts
Tango, Radical Vintage, Swing
time and TapDance@Stanford
Proceeds from the event will
help support the Stanford Dance
Division and also the Boys' and
Girls' Club of the Peninsula.
Tickets are on sale everyday in
White Plaza from Noon to 1 p.m
and will also be available at the
door.
