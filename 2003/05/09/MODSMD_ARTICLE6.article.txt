### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today through Sunday, more than
30,000 people are expected to attend
the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation's 32nd annual Stanford Pow
wow, the largest powwow organized by
students in the United States. The
event will feature Native American
dancers, singers artists, vendors and
other participants from across the
country.
The purpose is "to provide an event
tor the Native American community in
the greater Bay Area to get together and
to promote awareness of this communi
ty," said powwow Co-Chair Juliette
Jeanne, a coterminal student in earth
systems.
The theme for this year is "Honoring
Our Mothers," as the powwow will end
on Mother's Day. The newest addition to
the annual event's list of activities will be
a concert featuring Native Roots, an Al
buquerque-based Native American reg
gae band, along with the Bay Area band
Diskarte Namin and local hip-hop artist
Ras Kidee.
Eric Manolito, a junior who is part of
the concert committee, said the powwow
"is a lot of fun, but it's a lot of work."
"There's a big payoff though, seeing
all the families who come out," he added.

Manolito said the powwow committee
is group of 20 students who have been
preparing for the event since last fall.
"For me, [being part of the powwow
committee] is more about giving back to

the Hay Area community," Jeanne said.
"I come from a tribe that doesn't do pow
wows, so my first one was at Stanford.
