### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today through Sunday, more than
30,000 people are expected to attend
the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation's 32nd annual Stanford Pow
wow, the largest powwow organized by
students in the United States. The
event will feature Native American
dancers, singers artists, vendors and
other participants from across the
country.
The purpose is "to provide an event
tor the Native American community in
the greater Bay Area to get together and
to promote awareness of this communi
ty," said powwow Co-Chair Juliette
Jeanne, a coterminal student in earth
systems.
The theme for this year is "Honoring
Our Mothers," as the powwow will end
on Mother's Day. The newest addition to
the annual event's list of activities will be
a concert featuring Native Roots, an Al
buquerque-based Native American reg
gae band, along with the Bay Area band
Diskarte Namin and local hip-hop artist
Ras Kidee.
Eric Manolito, a junior who is part of
the concert committee, said the powwow
"is a lot of fun, but it's a lot of work."
"There's a big payoff though, seeing
all the families who come out," he added.

Manolito said the powwow committee
is group of 20 students who have been
preparing for the event since last fall.
"For me, [being part of the powwow
committee] is more about giving back to

the Hay Area community," Jeanne said.
"I come from a tribe that doesn't do pow
wows, so my first one was at Stanford.

This year's powwow will run from today until Sunday. More than 30,000 people from all
over the United States are expected to attend. A committee of 20 students has worked
since last fall to prepare for the campus event.
One reason I came to Stanford was
that 1 was drawn to the sense of
family away from home. This is
just one way to get involved, and
seeing the actual powwow really
fills you with a sense of pride."
According to Jeanne, the most
exciting moments of the powwow
are the Grand Entries, which sig
nal the beginning of dance ses
sions.
Junior Jasmine Lopez, who will

be volunteering at the powwow
this weekend, said she got in
volved last year "as sort of a fluke."
"I got to cook the elders' supper
and cook over an open fire," she
continued. "It was pretty fun, and
1 got to stay and watch the dances
and singing groups. I think it's an
awesome event that everyone
should try to go to."
The powwow is free of charge
and will be held in the Eucalyptus
Grove, across from the Stanford
Stadium. The Native Roots con
cert takes place tonight at 10 p.m.
in the ballroom above the Native
American Cultural Center.
