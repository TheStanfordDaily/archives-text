# Prager argues against anti-Zionism
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER STAFF WRITER 
Asserting that the United States is
currently experiencing an ideological
civil war, conservative and controver
sial radio talk-show host Dennis
Prager spoke to a standing-room
only crowd last night. His lecture, en
titled "The Pathology of Anti-Ameri
canism and Anti-Zionism," analyzed
the causes of sentiment against the
United States and Israel.
Prager, an author, scholar, teacher
and theologian, was brought to Stan
ford by a coalition of student and Bay
Area groups, including the Stanford
Jewish American Alliance, Chabad at
Stanford, the Stanford College Re
publicans, the Taube Foundation for
Jewish Life and Culture, the Israeli
Peace Initiative, the Hoover Institu
tion and the Bay Area Chapter of the
Republican Jewish Coalition.
Junior Andy Clavin, founder and
president of the Jewish American al
liance, introduced Prager as "an
amazingly gifted, charming, elo

quent, and intelligent man .... Very
rarely, if ever, will you find tremen
dous wisdom. Dennis has tremen
dous wisdom."
Prager began his lecture by ad
dressing what he called the illogical
nature of anti-American and anti-Is
raeli sentiment.
"Of all the groups in the world,
the most hated seem to be Ameri
cans and Jews," he said. "It needs to
be explained."
Prager pointed out that after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Euro
pean world as well as American intel
lectuals responded by wondering
what the United States did wrong to
deserve the aggression it received.
"We live in an upside-down
world," he said.
Prager described Israel as a tiny
country — the size of New Jersey —
that is one of the most developed, and
one of the most self-critical, in the
world.

in Israeli history was made against
itself," Prager noted. "The two
most hated countries are the ones
with the most vociferous self-ha
tred," he said.
Prager then turned his attention
to Israel which, he said, consumes
Arab life. He also spoke about the
refusal to recognize the legitimacy
of an Israeli state.
"There is no acknowledgment,
none, that Jews have claims to the
Middle East," he said. "The new
leader of the Palestinian Authority
wrote a book denying the Holo
caust. An entire world of lies in the
Arab world has been built about
Jews.
"To know the Arab-Israeli dis
pute takes 60 seconds," he contin
ued. "The Jews overwhelmingly
believe that the Palestinians have a
right to Palestine; it is not the same
the other way around."
Anti-Zionism is intrinsically re
lated to anti-Semitism for Prager.
He asked why the existence of Pak
istan or Panama have never been in

question, although they were also
carved out of previously-existing
countries.
"Of all the states on Earth, every
one of which was created in blood
shed, only one has its existence
constantly challenged," he said.
"And then we wonder why people
equate anti-Zionism with anti-
Semitism."
Prager pointed to Tuesday's Is
rael Independence Day celebra
tion and the accompanying
protests by advocates for Palestini
ans as an example of the injustice
that Israel faces.
"Can you imagine if we had a
July 4 celebration but,there was
a counter demonstration show
ing how many British were killed
in 1776?" he asked. "One side
wants the other dead and not the
other way around. The head of
Hamas often says, 'We love
death more than the Israelis love
life.' "
Prager then tackled the issue of
anti-Americanism, identifying two
groups that are primarily responsi
ble for its spread: the Arab world
and the European left.
"The United States is the obsta
cle to the spread of leftist ideas and

Islam," he said. "The world will be
dominated in your lifetime by one
of three ideologies: Islam, leftism
socialism, like in Europe, or Amer
icanism.
"[ln Europe] a person should be
taken care of from cradle to
grave .... They resent us for capi
talism," he added.
Another source of European re
sentment is that the United States is
the most religious of the world's in
dustrialized nations, while Europe
is relatively secular, Prager said.
"That's America: God and liber
ty," he added.
Prager went on to describe
what he called the the United
States' "civil war." The ideological
battle in the United States is be
tween European elements and
traditionally American elements.
All colleges, he asserted, repre
sent the European influence.
"For all intents and purposes,
you are living in Europe," he pro
claimed. "Go 100 miles south and
you start to enter the U.S."
He described leftism as a prod
uct of modern alienation.
"What the left has created is a
huge body of people alienated
from national, religious and even

sexual identities," he said. "You are
to be utterly unrooted.
"There isn't right or wrong," he
added. "You're not rooted even
there in a moral foundation."
Prager concluded by emphasiz
ing the divide between Americans
and "European leftists."
"There are two separate Ameri
cas," he said. "Who we agree with
and who wins will determine how
our children will live."
Students at the talk said they ap
preciated Prager's unique perspec
tive.
"He challenged many of the
thoughts so frequently voiced at
Stanford," said junior Megan
Richer.
"At Stanford we're never ex
posed to speakers like this," com
mented junior and Hollywood
actor Ben Savage. "His views and
people who share his views are
drowned out on college campuses."
Said senior Jake Gardener, "I
came in here very critical and
very skeptical, but I agree with
the underlying themes he was
talking about. Maybe he takes
them to an extreme, but in the
end a lot of what he said resonat
ed with me."

United States and Israel.
Prager, an author, scholar, teacher
and theologian, was brought to Stan
ford by a coalition of student and Bay
Area groups, including the Stanford
Jewish American Alliance, Chabad at
Stanford, the Stanford College Re
publicans, the Taube Foundation for
Jewish Life and Culture, the Israeli
Peace Initiative, the Hoover Institu
tion and the Bay Area Chapter of the
Republican Jewish Coalition.
Junior Andy Clavin, founder and
president of the Jewish American al
liance, introduced Prager as "an
amazingly gifted, charming, elo

quent, and intelligent man .... Very
rarely, if ever, will you find tremen
dous wisdom. Dennis has tremen
dous wisdom."
Prager began his lecture by ad
dressing what he called the illogical
nature of anti-American and anti-Is
raeli sentiment.
"Of all the groups in the world,
the most hated seem to be Ameri
cans and Jews," he said. "It needs to
be explained."
Prager pointed out that after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Euro
pean world as well as American intel
lectuals responded by wondering
what the United States did wrong to
deserve the aggression it received.
"We live in an upside-down
world," he said.
Prager described Israel as a tiny
country — the size of New Jersey —
that is one of the most developed, and
one of the most self-critical, in the
world.
"The largest Israeli demonstration

in Israeli history was made against
itself," Prager noted. "The two
most hated countries are the ones
with the most vociferous self-ha
tred," he said.
Prager then turned his attention
to Israel which, he said, consumes
Arab life. He also spoke about the
refusal to recognize the legitimacy
of an Israeli state.
"There is no acknowledgment,
none, that Jews have claims to the
Middle East," he said. "The new
leader of the Palestinian Authority
wrote a book denying the Holo
caust. An entire world of lies in the
Arab world has been built about
Jews.
"To know the Arab-Israeli dis
pute takes 60 seconds," he contin
ued. "The Jews overwhelmingly
believe that the Palestinians have a
right to Palestine; it is not the same
the other way around."
Anti-Zionism is intrinsically re
lated to anti-Semitism for Prager.
He asked why the existence of Pak
istan or Panama have never been in

question, although they were also
carved out of previously-existing
countries.
"Of all the states on Earth, every
one of which was created in blood
shed, only one has its existence
constantly challenged," he said.
"And then we wonder why people
equate anti-Zionism with anti-
Semitism."
Prager pointed to Tuesday's Is
rael Independence Day celebra
tion and the accompanying
protests by advocates for Palestini
ans as an example of the injustice
that Israel faces.
"Can you imagine if we had a
July 4 celebration but,there was
a counter demonstration show
ing how many British were killed
in 1776?" he asked. "One side
wants the other dead and not the
other way around. The head of
Hamas often says, 'We love
death more than the Israelis love
life.' "
Prager then tackled the issue of
anti-Americanism, identifying two
groups that are primarily responsi
ble for its spread: the Arab world
and the European left.
"The United States is the obsta
cle to the spread of leftist ideas and

Islam," he said. "The world will be
dominated in your lifetime by one
of three ideologies: Islam, leftism
socialism, like in Europe, or Amer
icanism.
"[ln Europe] a person should be
taken care of from cradle to
grave .... They resent us for capi
talism," he added.
Another source of European re
sentment is that the United States is
the most religious of the world's in
dustrialized nations, while Europe
is relatively secular, Prager said.
"That's America: God and liber
ty," he added.
Prager went on to describe
what he called the the United
States' "civil war." The ideological
battle in the United States is be
tween European elements and
traditionally American elements.
All colleges, he asserted, repre
sent the European influence.
"For all intents and purposes,
you are living in Europe," he pro
claimed. "Go 100 miles south and
you start to enter the U.S."
He described leftism as a prod
uct of modern alienation.
"What the left has created is a
huge body of people alienated
from national, religious and even

sexual identities," he said. "You are
to be utterly unrooted.
"There isn't right or wrong," he
added. "You're not rooted even
there in a moral foundation."
Prager concluded by emphasiz
ing the divide between Americans
and "European leftists."
"There are two separate Ameri
cas," he said. "Who we agree with
and who wins will determine how
our children will live."
Students at the talk said they ap
preciated Prager's unique perspec
tive.
"He challenged many of the
thoughts so frequently voiced at
Stanford," said junior Megan
Richer.
"At Stanford we're never ex
posed to speakers like this," com
mented junior and Hollywood
actor Ben Savage. "His views and
people who share his views are
drowned out on college campuses."
Said senior Jake Gardener, "I
came in here very critical and
very skeptical, but I agree with
the underlying themes he was
talking about. Maybe he takes
them to an extreme, but in the
end a lot of what he said resonat
ed with me."
Asserting that the United States is
currently experiencing an ideological
civil war, conservative and controver
sial radio talk-show host Dennis
Prager spoke to a standing-room
only crowd last night. His lecture, en
titled "The Pathology of Anti-Ameri
canism and Anti-Zionism," analyzed
the causes of sentiment against the
United States and Israel.
