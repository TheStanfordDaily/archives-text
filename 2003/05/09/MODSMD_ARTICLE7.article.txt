Asserting that the United States is
currently experiencing an ideological
civil war, conservative and controver
sial radio talk-show host Dennis
Prager spoke to a standing-room
only crowd last night. His lecture, en
titled "The Pathology of Anti-Ameri
canism and Anti-Zionism," analyzed
the causes of sentiment against the
United States and Israel.
Prager, an author, scholar, teacher
and theologian, was brought to Stan
ford by a coalition of student and Bay
Area groups, including the Stanford
Jewish American Alliance, Chabad at
Stanford, the Stanford College Re
publicans, the Taube Foundation for
Jewish Life and Culture, the Israeli
Peace Initiative, the Hoover Institu
tion and the Bay Area Chapter of the
Republican Jewish Coalition.
Junior Andy Clavin, founder and
president of the Jewish American al
liance, introduced Prager as "an
amazingly gifted, charming, elo

quent, and intelligent man .... Very
rarely, if ever, will you find tremen
dous wisdom. Dennis has tremen
dous wisdom."
Prager began his lecture by ad
dressing what he called the illogical
nature of anti-American and anti-Is
raeli sentiment.
"Of all the groups in the world,
the most hated seem to be Ameri
cans and Jews," he said. "It needs to
be explained."
Prager pointed out that after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Euro
pean world as well as American intel
lectuals responded by wondering
what the United States did wrong to
deserve the aggression it received.
"We live in an upside-down
world," he said.
Prager described Israel as a tiny
country — the size of New Jersey —
that is one of the most developed, and
one of the most self-critical, in the
world.
