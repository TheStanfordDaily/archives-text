# Students provide homeless with food
## Helping others out of a jam 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
A new program led by Neged Ra'av, a student group affil
iated with Stanford Hillel, aims to show people that helping
the homeless can be as simple as making a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich.
As part of the program, called "PB-Jam," dorms agree to
make 100 to 150 peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunches for
the Palo Alto Drop-In Center, where unemployed, homeless
and hungry clients come to get a meal.
Neged Ra'av, which focuses its efforts on homelessness
and community service, finds students who are willing to or
ganize the event in their dorms and then funds the project.
Neged Ra'av covers the costs of $f>o to $75 per event for the
sandwiches, raisins and cookies that go into each lunch.
"PB-Jams are a way to get people involved in community
service by making it easy for them," said senior Morris
Cohen, co-president of Neged Ra'av. "The events are a great
success, especially in the freshman dorms where there is a
very social atmosphere. People don't just sit there and make
sandwiches; it's a social event as well — at Otero last week,
they were singing Disney songs during the PB-Jam."
So far, Cedro, Potter, Junipero, Otero and
Kairos have held the events, and Slavianskii
Dom, EAST and Trancos are scheduled to
hold PB-Jams in the coming weeks. Dorms
have learned of the program through word of
mouth and announcements from resident as
sistants.
"It seemed like a good way to help people
in need and not very difficult or time consum
ing," said freshman Aaron Sunshine, who or
ganized a PB-Jam in Otero. "I thought, 'How
can I refuse to spend a few hours of my time
to help give a little to people who have noth
ing when I have so much?' "
The Sigma Nu fraternity has also become
involved with the program. They held a PB-
Jam before their annual Sunsplash party in
the beginning of the quarter as a way to inte
grate community service into the event.
"It was very fun and really popular," said
event organizer Michael Scrafford, a junior.
"It gave us the opportunity to show that we're
not only about parties."
He added, "We want to try doing it again."
Neged Ra'av tried to make the lunches
themselves in the winter, but "it turned out to
be a lot of time and effort for us to go out, buy
the food, publicize and run the event every
week," Cohen said.
Flie current program works well for the
group because they have been able to expand
their reach without a significant time commit
ment, organizers said. Each dorm's event or
ganizer buys the food and coordinates mak
ing the lunches, while Neged Ra'av represen

tatives pick up the lunches and deliver them
to the Palo Alto Drop-In Center the next
morning.
"The goal is to teach people how easy and
fun it can be to do community service,"
Cohen said. "I see no reason why the PB-
Jams can't — if they get encouraged fora
few years — become a Stanford dorm tradi
tion, just like the scavenger hunt, assassins,

ski trip, etc."
Sunshine considered the project to be a
success in his dorm.
"I was very pleased with the outcome," he
said. "We had a great turnout and finished
faster than I thought we would. People
seemed to enjoy themselves, and we prepared
over a hundred meals. I look forward to doing
this again, if possible."
