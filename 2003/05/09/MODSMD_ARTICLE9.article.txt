# Students provide homeless with food
## Helping others out of a jam 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
A new program led by Neged Ra'av, a student group affil
iated with Stanford Hillel, aims to show people that helping
the homeless can be as simple as making a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich.
As part of the program, called "PB-Jam," dorms agree to
make 100 to 150 peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunches for
the Palo Alto Drop-In Center, where unemployed, homeless
and hungry clients come to get a meal.
Neged Ra'av, which focuses its efforts on homelessness
and community service, finds students who are willing to or
ganize the event in their dorms and then funds the project.
Neged Ra'av covers the costs of $f>o to $75 per event for the
sandwiches, raisins and cookies that go into each lunch.
"PB-Jams are a way to get people involved in community
service by making it easy for them," said senior Morris
Cohen, co-president of Neged Ra'av. "The events are a great
success, especially in the freshman dorms where there is a
very social atmosphere. People don't just sit there and make
sandwiches; it's a social event as well â€” at Otero last week,
they were singing Disney songs during the PB-Jam."
