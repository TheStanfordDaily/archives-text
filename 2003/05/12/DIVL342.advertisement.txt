Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation by Olivia Judson
Finally, a how-to guide, in the guise of a Q&A advice column, for marching, (lying, or slithering into the battle of the sexes, whatever your specics. In this entertaining and informative book, evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson presents "letters"from sexually
frustrated animals, birds, and insects who ask "Dr. Tatiana" to explain some sexual oddity. For example, "Don't Wanna Be Butch in Botswana" writes, "I'm a spotted hyena, a girl. The only trouble is, I've got a large phallus. I can't help feeling that this is unladylike.
What's wrong with me?" Each question leads Dr. T. into a fascinating explanation about the sex life of this species, sprinkled with sprightly stories about other species with similar attributes or behavior. You'll learn why one stick-insect copulation lasts for 10 weeks
(to prevent other males from gaining access to the fertile female) and why the black-winged damselfly's penis has bristles (to scrape out his rival's sperm). You'll learn that male and female orangutans masturbate with sex toys fashioned from leaves and twigs, that
slugs are hermaphrodites with penises on their heads, and that females in more than 80 species eat their lovers before, during, or after sex. You'll also ponder human sexuality when you learn that "monogamy is one of the most deviant behaviors in biology" (although
jackdaws, chinstrap penguins, California mice, and some termites swear by it) and "natural selection, it seems, often smiles on strumpets."

Stegner Fellow Reading - The Darker Fall: Poems by Rick Barot, Stanley Plumly
In his astonishingly assured debut volume. Rick Barot brings the reader the news that stays news, as Found wished it for poetry. But his is not the tired history of another isolate self—it is news of the world, transformed by individual presence. With an eye and ear so
finely tuned we are reminded of Elizabeth Bishop, Barot's poems convince us that philosophy and landscape are inseparable from human vision. Painters like Miro. Bonnard, Rembrandt, and the ideas of Wittgenstein and others are caught in Barot's line of sight, but
so are alleyway shards of glass. These poems are tilled with the pleasures ol vivid language, yes. but they are more than that. Rick Barot reminds us of the forgotten dimensions of meaning present in our modest, all-too-human gestures: I remember my mother
planting roses/ as one way the mundane gets brought into/ sacredness, though it was simply a thing she liked/ to do.

Stegner Fellow Reading - Notes from the Divided Country: Poems by Suji Kwock Kim
The four parts of Kim's impressive first collection contain poems of family, history, love, and vision, respectively. The first part is punch-in-the-guts powerful. After opening with the spiritually virtuosic "Generations," tracing the poet's journey from before
conception to implantation in the womb, the poems lay out a painful familial scenario, the soul-searing climax of which comes in"ST RAGE," in which sadistic white boys torture the poet's handicapped brother. Anguish also pervades the second section's
preoccupation with the half-century of horror Kim's ancestral homeland. Korea, endured, first under Japanese occupation, then in the Korean War; members of Kim's family played historic roles then, and they figure as actors and dedicatees here. The third IHHUBIHyKBIHBSH
section's poems on love are analytic, personal, and sensual, though seldom all at once; whereas pain predominated in the first two sections, emotional intensity preoccupies these poems. In the last section, Kim applies that intensity to observation of art and
nature, so strikingly that, for instance, having read "On Sparrows," you may never regard those common birds as commonplace again.

B Learning to Pray: How We Find Heaven on Earth by Wayne Muller
In northern California, there is fog in the morning. Slowly, it clears. We know that the mountains, the trees, the sky are there, behind the fog, but we cannot see them with our eyes. Instead, we know them in our bodies; we know them for having seen them, felt them,
watched the fog lift again and again... This is prayer. This is deep, faithful listening, waiting for what is hidden to be revealed. Prayer is not words; prayer is what happens when you listen and wait, beneath the words, for the outline of heaven to emerge. -From the
Introduction Learning to Pray Many who seek comfort and healing from prayer are unsure about how to pray. They feel awkward or uncomfortable, not knowing the "right" way to pray. What should prayer feel like, and what is it supposed to accomplish? In this
illuminating book, Wayne Muller offers simple yet profound guidance based on the Lord's Prayer. It is the prayer most prayed in our culture-included in countless services, private devotions, and twelve-step meetings. Yet in its very familiarity we may underestimate
i Mum its power to heal and transform our lives today. Now, in the same ecumenical spirit with which he approached the Sabbath. Muller gives us a fresh, new vision of this timeless prayer. "Every word, every phrase," he says, "reveals some potent teaching about prayer."
/ Starting with the word "our." which reminds us that we never pray alone, and continuing phrase by phrase, Muller leads us into the heart of the prayer, to the assurance of a heaven available to us here and now. He explores how God responds to our needs and wants.
vve can seek protection in a world full of danger and evil, and how we are called to forgiveness. He also gently confronts the difficulties that some people have experienced with the prayer. Each short section ends with a Prayer Practice to bring these simple teach
ings alive in our hearts and lives.

And the Passenger Was Death: The Drama and Trauma of Losing a Child by Douglas Daher
On Juny 19, 1999. at 3:00 a.m.. Dr. Douglas Daher received a phone call informing him that his twenty-two-year-old son, Andrew, was dead. And the Passenger Was Death: The Drama and Trauma of Losing a Child chronicles this tragedy, from the initial delivery
of the news and the first night of loss through the funeral, in a timeless encounter that tightly bound together friends and extended family. This memoir explores the emotional and cognitive terrain of grief for those who loved and were loved by Andrew. Topics
focus on the family's necessary engagement with institutional tasks and requirements; the bureaucracy of insurance claims, bank accounts, and a lawsuit. Few commentaries disclose in this way the frustrations and resentments that result from the clash of intense
grief with systems poorly designed to accommodate unusual circumstances. Two years after his son's death, the author only begins to emerge from grief. He describes the relationships that supported him through his journey and reviews some helpful resources. As a
therapist. Dr. Daher offers this firsthand account as a special resource for professionals, to frame the grief process and to note critical themes and paradoxical opportunities for healing.

Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation by Olivia Judson
Finally, a how-to guide, in the guise of a Q&A advice column, for marching, (lying, or slithering into the battle of the sexes, whatever your specics. In this entertaining and informative book, evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson presents "letters"from sexually
frustrated animals, birds, and insects who ask "Dr. Tatiana" to explain some sexual oddity. For example, "Don't Wanna Be Butch in Botswana" writes, "I'm a spotted hyena, a girl. The only trouble is, I've got a large phallus. I can't help feeling that this is unladylike.
What's wrong with me?" Each question leads Dr. T. into a fascinating explanation about the sex life of this species, sprinkled with sprightly stories about other species with similar attributes or behavior. You'll learn why one stick-insect copulation lasts for 10 weeks
(to prevent other males from gaining access to the fertile female) and why the black-winged damselfly's penis has bristles (to scrape out his rival's sperm). You'll learn that male and female orangutans masturbate with sex toys fashioned from leaves and twigs, that
slugs are hermaphrodites with penises on their heads, and that females in more than 80 species eat their lovers before, during, or after sex. You'll also ponder human sexuality when you learn that "monogamy is one of the most deviant behaviors in biology" (although
jackdaws, chinstrap penguins, California mice, and some termites swear by it) and "natural selection, it seems, often smiles on strumpets."

Stegner Fellow Reading - The Darker Fall: Poems by Rick Barot, Stanley Plumly
In his astonishingly assured debut volume. Rick Barot brings the reader the news that stays news, as Found wished it for poetry. But his is not the tired history of another isolate self—it is news of the world, transformed by individual presence. With an eye and ear so
finely tuned we are reminded of Elizabeth Bishop, Barot's poems convince us that philosophy and landscape are inseparable from human vision. Painters like Miro. Bonnard, Rembrandt, and the ideas of Wittgenstein and others are caught in Barot's line of sight, but
so are alleyway shards of glass. These poems are tilled with the pleasures ol vivid language, yes. but they are more than that. Rick Barot reminds us of the forgotten dimensions of meaning present in our modest, all-too-human gestures: I remember my mother
planting roses/ as one way the mundane gets brought into/ sacredness, though it was simply a thing she liked/ to do.

"Barter exchanges history for myth, direct speech for epistles, activity for observation breathtaking." - Claudia Rankine Felix the Rat's hind feetcould be Barbie hands - same pink, same injection-molded seaming from "Electronica'The poems in Barter, Monica
Youn's exciting first collection, negotiate transactions between scarcity and excess, pornography and abstraction, the thing and the thing seen. Rendered with a dazzling array of structures and allusions, these poems describe - and become - a strange gallery of
paintings and portraits. She offers a Polaroid left on a windshield, step-by-step instructions for "Drawing for Absolute Beginners," a stereoscope with a box of slides. Both an homage to and a warning against nonexistent things. Barter introduces a vibrant new voice

Stegner Fellow Reading - Notes from the Divided Country: Poems by Suji Kwock Kim
The four parts of Kim's impressive first collection contain poems of family, history, love, and vision, respectively. The first part is punch-in-the-guts powerful. After opening with the spiritually virtuosic "Generations," tracing the poet's journey from before
conception to implantation in the womb, the poems lay out a painful familial scenario, the soul-searing climax of which comes in"ST RAGE," in which sadistic white boys torture the poet's handicapped brother. Anguish also pervades the second section's
preoccupation with the half-century of horror Kim's ancestral homeland. Korea, endured, first under Japanese occupation, then in the Korean War; members of Kim's family played historic roles then, and they figure as actors and dedicatees here. The third IHHUBIHyKBIHBSH
section's poems on love are analytic, personal, and sensual, though seldom all at once; whereas pain predominated in the first two sections, emotional intensity preoccupies these poems. In the last section, Kim applies that intensity to observation of art and
nature, so strikingly that, for instance, having read "On Sparrows," you may never regard those common birds as commonplace again.

B Learning to Pray: How We Find Heaven on Earth by Wayne Muller
In northern California, there is fog in the morning. Slowly, it clears. We know that the mountains, the trees, the sky are there, behind the fog, but we cannot see them with our eyes. Instead, we know them in our bodies; we know them for having seen them, felt them,
watched the fog lift again and again... This is prayer. This is deep, faithful listening, waiting for what is hidden to be revealed. Prayer is not words; prayer is what happens when you listen and wait, beneath the words, for the outline of heaven to emerge. -From the
Introduction Learning to Pray Many who seek comfort and healing from prayer are unsure about how to pray. They feel awkward or uncomfortable, not knowing the "right" way to pray. What should prayer feel like, and what is it supposed to accomplish? In this
illuminating book, Wayne Muller offers simple yet profound guidance based on the Lord's Prayer. It is the prayer most prayed in our culture-included in countless services, private devotions, and twelve-step meetings. Yet in its very familiarity we may underestimate
i Mum its power to heal and transform our lives today. Now, in the same ecumenical spirit with which he approached the Sabbath. Muller gives us a fresh, new vision of this timeless prayer. "Every word, every phrase," he says, "reveals some potent teaching about prayer."
/ Starting with the word "our." which reminds us that we never pray alone, and continuing phrase by phrase, Muller leads us into the heart of the prayer, to the assurance of a heaven available to us here and now. He explores how God responds to our needs and wants.
vve can seek protection in a world full of danger and evil, and how we are called to forgiveness. He also gently confronts the difficulties that some people have experienced with the prayer. Each short section ends with a Prayer Practice to bring these simple teach
ings alive in our hearts and lives.

And the Passenger Was Death: The Drama and Trauma of Losing a Child by Douglas Daher
On Juny 19, 1999. at 3:00 a.m.. Dr. Douglas Daher received a phone call informing him that his twenty-two-year-old son, Andrew, was dead. And the Passenger Was Death: The Drama and Trauma of Losing a Child chronicles this tragedy, from the initial delivery
of the news and the first night of loss through the funeral, in a timeless encounter that tightly bound together friends and extended family. This memoir explores the emotional and cognitive terrain of grief for those who loved and were loved by Andrew. Topics
focus on the family's necessary engagement with institutional tasks and requirements; the bureaucracy of insurance claims, bank accounts, and a lawsuit. Few commentaries disclose in this way the frustrations and resentments that result from the clash of intense
grief with systems poorly designed to accommodate unusual circumstances. Two years after his son's death, the author only begins to emerge from grief. He describes the relationships that supported him through his journey and reviews some helpful resources. As a
therapist. Dr. Daher offers this firsthand account as a special resource for professionals, to frame the grief process and to note critical themes and paradoxical opportunities for healing.
