## Franks says Baath Party is eliminated 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —
The United States declared
Saddam Hussein's Baath Party
dead yesterday, dispatching the
war's commander to tell Iraqis
that the instrument of their de
posed dictator's power was dis
solved and promising to purge
its influence from the country it
dominated for 35 years.
Gen. Tommy Franks' mes
sage, delivered in Arabic by an
announcer for the coalition's In
formation Radio, broadcast a
clear message over the AM radio
waves across postwar Iraq: Any
activity by Baath Party holdouts
who oppose U.S. occupation will
not be tolerated.
"The Arab Baath Socialist
Party is dissolved," Franks said,
but high difficulties remain in
genuinely eliminating it.
American administrators are
struggling to balance the need
fora fresh start with an unwel
come reality — that thousands

of Iraq's civil servants had
Baath affiliations.
Franks' order came a month
after American troops invaded
Baghdad and drove out Sad
dam's regime, which used in
trigue and terror to make sure
the minority Sunni Muslim
dominated party extended its
reach and control into all cor
ners of Iraqi society.
The statement told Iraqi citi
zens to collect and turn in any
materials they had relating to
the party and its operations. It
called them "an important part
of Iraqi government docu
ments."
Unseating the Baath, which
advocated Arab unity but be
came a personal tool of Saddam
and his lieutenants, was consid
ered a top priority of American
military planners in the run-up
to the Iraq war, which began
March 20 and largely ended by
mid-April.
