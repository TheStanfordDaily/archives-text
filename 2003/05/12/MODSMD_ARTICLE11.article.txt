# Powell meets to talk peace

JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian gun
men killed an Israeli motorist in the West
Bank and Israeli troops raided a Palestinian
town yesterday as Secretary of State Colin
Powell urged both sides to take concrete
steps toward Mideast peace.
Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian group
led by Yasser Arafat and new Palestinian
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, and die
Popular Front group, a radical member of
the PLO, claimed responsibility for the
roadside ambush.
Later yesterday, three Islamic Jihad
members surrendered to Israeli troops
after tanks and armored personnel carriers
surrounded a building in the West Bank
town of Jenin while helicopters provided
cover fire from machine guns, residents
said. The army said troops were looking for
suspected militants.
Yesterday's raid came as Powell met
Abbas as part of U.S. efforts to get started on
a new peace plan, the so-called "road map"
to Palestinian statehood.
The plan calls for the Palestinians to
rein in militants while Israel eases its grip
on the Palestinian areas. The Palestinians

have demanded that Israel halt military
strikes and targeted killings of suspected
militants to improve the atmosphere and
allow Palestinian security forces to assume
control.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon has said Israeli troops would not let
up in their campaign against militants re
sponsible for scores of shootings and bomb
ings in the past 31 months of fighting.
Powell said yesterday the United States
expects "rapid and decisive actions by the
Palestinians" to dismantle terror groups
and he has discussed "a number of specific
actions" Israel can take to move the process
forward.
Powell's meeting with Abbas was held in
the West Bank town of Jericho, underscor
ing the U.S. intention to exclude Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat from the process. Israel
has confined Arafat to the West Bank town
of Ramallah. Both the United States and Is
rael have accused Arafat of encouraging
and aiding terrorism.
Powell backed Israel's insistence that
Abbas take strong action to crack down on
militant groups.
