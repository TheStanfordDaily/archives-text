# Cal lifts SARS ban for some

### 
SAN JOSE (KRT) — The University of California-
Berkeley, facing intense criticism that it overreacted
to the potential health risks of SARS, announced over
the weekend that it will allow about 80 students from
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to attend summer
classes.
Nearly 30 students, most of whom attend the Chi
nese University of Hong Kong, are scheduled to ar
rive by May 27, when the first summer session begins.
University officials in Hong Kong will monitor the
health of the students before they leave Asia. After ar
riving in Berkeley, the students will be in close contact
with campus health officials.
Last week, UC-Berkeley became the first universi
ty in the country to cancel summer programs for stu
dents from the countries hardest hit by SARS. Nearly
600 Asian students — many more than the campus
anticipated — had enrolled in either summer courses
or English language classes through UC Berkeley Ex
tension.
Campus officials worried that they could not safely
meet the health needs of the students if there were a
SARS outbreak, but Asian-American advocacy groups
cried foul, and San Francisco's Asian Law Caucus
called the policy racial profiling.
The changes were made because the university
created special housing for any student who may be
infected with SARS. And by limiting the number of
students enrolled — with the idea that 80 is far more
manageable than 600 — the university feels it can
manage potential risks.
The 80 students who are enrolled in summer
courses may attend classes as planned, but at least 500
students who wanted to take English language classes
must wait and hope that UC-Berkeley makes further
revisions to its policy.
Chancellor Robert Berdahl stressed that the uni
versity was not reversing its decision but modifying it,
and said the policy has been in constant flux because
new information about SARS surfaces daily. But he
acknowledged that the original policy created the im
pression that UC-Berkeley was "banning" students.
"We are very concerned that our decision to limit
enrollment in our summer programs has created the
impression here and abroad that UC-Berkeley was
actually banning students from here, or was not wel
coming Asian students at all," said Berdahl.
