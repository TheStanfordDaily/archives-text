## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial File-sharing policy fair 
### 
Earlier this month The Daily re
ported that, despite an increase
in complaints related to copy
righted material being distribut
ed over University computing networks,
the University would maintain its current
file-sharing policy. .Aligned with Title 11 of
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
Stanford's policy establishes a protocol for
responding to copyright infringement
complaints. The University's current file
sharing policy affirms Title II of the
DMCA, which also releases network ser
vice providers from legal liability relating
to the potential copyright infringements
by its subscribers. We believe the Univer
/
sity has implemented its file-sharing poli
cy with a keen understanding of the com
plexities involved and is correct in leaving
its policy unaltered.
While file sharing — essentially an in
formal electronic network for distributing

sound and video files
— is illegal because it
violates copyright
laws, few people who
engage in file sharing
are aware of the illicit
nature of their ac
tions. Most people do
not think twice be
fore downloading a
song or a movie onto
their computers.
Even those who are
aware that file-shar
ing is illegal justify

their actions by claiming that the prices of
music or video recordings include a mar
gin for corporate losses due to piracy.
Thus, those who do not share at least
some files are getting ripped off, and
those who do are simply getting what they
have already paid for.
The entertainment industry, however,
sees things differently. Dr. Dre and Metal
lica, with all their vitriolic tirades against
file-sharing, seem rather tame when com
pared to Hollywood and Madison Avenue
lawyers, who are aggressively litigating al
leged copyright violations in courts across
the nation. College students, perhaps the
largest consumers of CDs and DVDs,
seem to be favorite targets. With little re
gard for its best customers, the entertain
ment industry is quick to attribute sharply
reduced CD sales in the past year to illegal
copying on college campuses, braying be
fore judges about unrestrained file-shar
ing causing untold millions of dollars in
losses to media conglomerates.
Amidst all this drama, universities have

found themselves in a unique spot. By
providing access to inexpensive T1 or T3
networks, university campuses are
hotspots for file-sharing. A bonanza for
students, file-sharing is no less trouble
some for universities, including Stanford,
where administrators complain about re
duced bandwidth; increased server de
mands, and the ambiguous roles of being
an Internet service provider; a communi
ty for free inquiry, and the foremost re
specter of intellectual property.
Title II of the DMCA benefits the Uni
versity by resolving some of this ambigui
ty, yet it holds a less evident advantage for
students. By setting the University and its
network users as separate entities, stu
dents enjoy greater online privacy. The
University is neither compelled to moni
tor its users' activities, nor is it in the posi
tion of having to invade student privacy or
enforce laws while having no enforcement

power. With such a
level of separation,
records of user activi
ty are less readily
available to would-be
interested parties,
with inspection re
quiring a judge's
order rather than the
importuning words
of a corporate attor
ney.
By upholding its
file-sharing policy,
the University also af

firms the robustness of Title II of the
DMCA, which establishes an effective
means for resolving on-campus copyright
violations. Thus, Title II provides a bal
ance between interests, which in practice
allows the University to avoid bad public
ity, involves minimal transaction costs and
upholds a unique intellectual property
rights tradition, dating back to the fram
ing of the Constitution.
We support an environment in which
the University strongly affirms intellectu
al property rights, yet one that is protect
ed from liability relating to the exchange
of ideas and works by means of electronic
networks. Though the University cannot
antecedently prevent illegal file-sharing,
it can and ought to cooperate with copy
right owners' demands for violators on
campus to cease and desist. We urge all
Stanford students to respect others' intel
lectual property as their own and affirm
Title II of the DMCA by complying with
University requests to remove copyright
ed material from file sharing availability.
