# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Living in a material world 
### 
One of the main objectives of
the University is to pro
duce well-rounded, intel
lectually vibrant students. That's
why we have general education re
quirements, right? VVe all have to
take I-Hum and PWR, which are
the bane of every freshman's exis
tence — unless, of course, you
read our column in class. But that's
just the beginning. Soon you find
yourself taking such advanced
GERs as "Ki hoialu: The New Re
naissance of a Hawaiian Musical
Tradition" or "Poetess: The Gram
mar of the Self When the Poet is a
Woman." Shockingly enough, the
GERs fail to require the one course
that they should.
No, it's not "Heretics, Prosti
tutes and Merchants: Venice and
its Empire"; it's "Econ 1: Elemen
tary Economics." We propose
moving this class into a new catego
ry of its own: Area 0, so it will be im
possible to graduate without taking
this course. Bear in mind, we
would never make such a sugges
tion unless we felt a pressing need
on campus for such measures.
For example, consider the woe
fully misguided attempts of certain
student groups to institute a living
wage for workers on campus. Be
sides the fact that people do not die
from lower wages, proponents of
this policy would do well to attend
Econ 1 and learn why such a living
wage is detrimental to the workers
they claim to be helping because it
reduces their employment and in
creases deadweight loss.
Speaking of calling for policies
that screw over workers, students
receiving passing grades in Econ 1
will know precisely to leave when
crazy people like Rep. Dennis
Kucinich come to campus to argue
for the abolition of North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement and
the World Trade Organization.
If all goes according to plan, fa
natical "fill in your favorite inane
cause" protesters may realize that
their actions are an inefficient
waste of resources. Instead of lying
in the streets, protesters should be
making widgets. At the very least,

their understanding of the prison
er's dilemma will help them when
they get arrested, after good
protests go bad.
Most of you are probably think
ing, "Yeah, those people are crazy,
but 1 am a fully rational human
being, so why do I need to take
Econ 1 ?" Well, odds are if you are
fully rational, you probably already

have taken it, but for those of you
somewhere in between being a
member of the Young Communist
League and the Stanford Eco
nomics Association, Eton 1 is just as
important for you. Without the
knowledge garnered in this course,
becoming a sentient human being,
fully aware of his or her environ
ment, is next to impossible.
Everyone should know what
the definition of a recession is or
that having zero pollution is nei
ther cost-effective nor what is best
for humanity. You can never reach
your full professional potential
without this kind of knowledge,
but the most important reasons to
take Econ 1 are right here on the
Stanford campus.
Economics is the fundamental
building block of every social sci
ence. It is the most basic model of
human behavior that gives people
the ability to conceptualize the
world within an analytic frame
work. It is a travesty that many so
cial science majors — especially
Political Science and Sociology —
do not require Econ 1.
Pragmatic engineers and pre
meds are focused enough on the
real world to the see the merits of
learning the basic tools of econom
ic analysis, so we probably don't
have to put too much effort into
convincing them, but what about

those other majors?
Language majors could benefit
from exposure to simple cost-ben
efit analysis. They would come to
realize that consolidating all the
different languages into one de
partment is the only cost-effective
alternative for the University.
Even Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity and Feminist
Studies majors would have the
capacity to pursue their disci
plines intelligently if they knew
why certain groups earn 75 cents
on the dollar.
However, the only way to truly
impact the academic community is
to target the problem at its source.
The Area 0 requirement would
apply to all members of the Stan
ford community, professors in
cluded. In fact, this group proba
bly needs an Econ 1 requirement
more than any other.
Professors would benefit from
the aforementioned reasons in
much the same way as students do,
but more importantly, it is their
moral responsibility to understand
how economic concepts work be
fore they conduct any research
and especially before they get up
in front of a classroom of students.
Any remotely reasonable aca
demic idea about human or group
behavior should be capable of
being reduced to a theory ground
ed in explicit economic concepts.
If the theory can't be so explained
then it must be illogical, nonsensi
cal or simply wrong. Such ideas are
an inefficient waste of ink and even
more abominable when they are
fed to impressionable students.
One such group of students
may be realizing the error of their
ways as graduation draws near.
For seniors majoring in English, a
little economic knowledge would
let them know why there is no de
mand for the skills they have accu
mulated in the last four years. Too
bad you can't co-term in econ!

One of the main objectives of
the University is to pro
duce well-rounded, intel
lectually vibrant students. That's
why we have general education re
quirements, right? VVe all have to
take I-Hum and PWR, which are
the bane of every freshman's exis
tence — unless, of course, you
read our column in class. But that's
just the beginning. Soon you find
yourself taking such advanced
GERs as "Ki hoialu: The New Re
naissance of a Hawaiian Musical
Tradition" or "Poetess: The Gram
mar of the Self When the Poet is a
Woman." Shockingly enough, the
GERs fail to require the one course
that they should.
No, it's not "Heretics, Prosti
tutes and Merchants: Venice and
its Empire"; it's "Econ 1: Elemen
tary Economics." We propose
moving this class into a new catego
ry of its own: Area 0, so it will be im
possible to graduate without taking
this course. Bear in mind, we
would never make such a sugges
tion unless we felt a pressing need
on campus for such measures.
For example, consider the woe
fully misguided attempts of certain
student groups to institute a living
wage for workers on campus. Be
sides the fact that people do not die
from lower wages, proponents of
this policy would do well to attend
Econ 1 and learn why such a living
wage is detrimental to the workers
they claim to be helping because it
reduces their employment and in
creases deadweight loss.
Speaking of calling for policies
that screw over workers, students
receiving passing grades in Econ 1
will know precisely to leave when
crazy people like Rep. Dennis
Kucinich come to campus to argue
for the abolition of North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement and
the World Trade Organization.
If all goes according to plan, fa
natical "fill in your favorite inane
cause" protesters may realize that
their actions are an inefficient
waste of resources. Instead of lying
in the streets, protesters should be
making widgets. At the very least,

their understanding of the prison
er's dilemma will help them when
they get arrested, after good
protests go bad.
Most of you are probably think
ing, "Yeah, those people are crazy,
but 1 am a fully rational human
being, so why do I need to take
Econ 1 ?" Well, odds are if you are
fully rational, you probably already

have taken it, but for those of you
somewhere in between being a
member of the Young Communist
League and the Stanford Eco
nomics Association, Eton 1 is just as
important for you. Without the
knowledge garnered in this course,
becoming a sentient human being,
fully aware of his or her environ
ment, is next to impossible.
Everyone should know what
the definition of a recession is or
that having zero pollution is nei
ther cost-effective nor what is best
for humanity. You can never reach
your full professional potential
without this kind of knowledge,
but the most important reasons to
take Econ 1 are right here on the
Stanford campus.
Economics is the fundamental
building block of every social sci
ence. It is the most basic model of
human behavior that gives people
the ability to conceptualize the
world within an analytic frame
work. It is a travesty that many so
cial science majors — especially
Political Science and Sociology —
do not require Econ 1.
Pragmatic engineers and pre
meds are focused enough on the
real world to the see the merits of
learning the basic tools of econom
ic analysis, so we probably don't
have to put too much effort into
convincing them, but what about

those other majors?
Language majors could benefit
from exposure to simple cost-ben
efit analysis. They would come to
realize that consolidating all the
different languages into one de
partment is the only cost-effective
alternative for the University.
Even Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity and Feminist
Studies majors would have the
capacity to pursue their disci
plines intelligently if they knew
why certain groups earn 75 cents
on the dollar.
However, the only way to truly
impact the academic community is
to target the problem at its source.
