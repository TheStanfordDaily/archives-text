Stanford's excellence cannot be
measured merely by numbers
This letter is addressed to all of the
columnists of The Daily: Please immedi
ately stop belittling Stanford and glorify
ing Harvard.
Time after time, I come across columns
in which the authors make the simplistic
assumption that Harvard surpasses Stan
ford as an educational institution. For ex
ample, Uri Pomerantz's "Overcoming the
Harvard Complex" (March 6) puts Har
vard on a pedestal. Pomerantz contends
that more famous people attend Harvard,
that Harvard is more difficult to get into
than Stanford and that Harvard Student
Agencies possess more money than Stan
ford Student Enterprise.
Since when have we decided that the
quality of an educational institution can be
accurately gauged solely on the basis of
such superficial numbers as acceptance
rate and endowment size? Is the American
corporate culture so influential that we
now regard Stanford as nothing but a
business enterprise, whose mission is to es
tablish a profitable image and bring in
more wealth?

Most students come to Stanford for the
purpose of receiving a good education
within a superb academic setting. Unfor
tunately, the quality of education cannot
be honestly reflected by numerical figures
on paper. If we, Stanford students, adopt
the commonplace practice of looking at
any given institution through this numer
ical frame, then we will never fully appre
ciate the many wonderful and unique re
sources Stanford has to offer — the con
stant, informal interactions between stu
dents and faculty and the support for un
dergraduates who want to conduct re
search, to name just two. These attributes
speak to Stanford's excellence as a univer
sity much more substantively and accu
rately than do extraneous figures like the
acceptance rate.
Jimmy Mosqueda is wrong by writing
in"Camp Nowhere" (May 7) that Stanford
is a collection of students who didn't get
into Harvard. Many of us are here pre
cisely because we looked beyond the num
bers and concluded that Stanford affords
us a better opportunity to develop our
scholarship and to realize our potentials.
When we come to realize that we
should feel fortunate for being able to
study at Stanford, how many applicants
Harvard accepts in the spring or how
much money Harvard Student Agencies
have will become irrelevant. The success of

our academic career at Stanford is depen
dent on the extent to which we make the
best use of all the resources and opportu
nities available here, not on the extent to
which Stanford outdoes other universities
in fundraising.

Students, faculty staff must all become
educated on alcohol abuse
It's not clear to me why Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg assumes in his guest col
umn, "Students' arguments against alco
hol policy deconstructed" (May 9), that
those voicing concerns about the new Alco
hol Policy are completely ignorant about
college drinking research. His assumption
that our worries have no grounding in em
pirical studies seems to belie a curious lack
of respect for the critical thinking skills of
Stanford's student body.
The National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (www.collegedrink
ingprevention.gov), among other organi
zations, maintains a large library of reports
and studies about campus alcohol abuse.
Fifteen minutes of research on this Web
site would have shown Weisberg that many
experts believe resident assistants

shouldn't be involved in alcohol enforce
ment and that most successful programs to
reduce campus alcohol abuse are educa
tional, not regulatory. I can assure Weis
berg that I, many staff members at the Of
fice of Residential Education and Vaden
Health Center, and many of the current
students and recent alumni involved in this
debate have reviewed this literature much
more thoroughly than he seems to believe.
I would strongly encourage anyone in
terested in this subject to review that liter
ature themselves and draw their own con
clusions. Alcohol abuse is a problem at
every college in the country, including
Stanford, and only when students, faculty
and staff become educated and get in
volved can a university take serious steps
to find solutions to that problem.

Schools and departments should
welcome undergrad and grad students
1 am disappointed that Paul Lomio, as
sistant director for information services at
the Library, wants to further schisma
tize the University by banning non-law
students from l.aw Library computers, ac
cording to his letter to the editor, "Print

ing at Law Library not free for non-law
students" (May 9).
Cross-disciplinary interaction doesn't
necessarily happen when there is a "legiti
mate need." It happens when the oppor
tunity appears, and this opportunity
should not be discouraged. Why should
access to electronic Law Library collections
be restricted to those who are taking law
classes or working for law professors —
and then only with special permission?
Certainly, having to justify oneself to a li
brarian before undertaking research does
not facilitate a climate of free inquiry.
Although 1 do not represent the School
of Engineering, or any library or comput
ing organization for that matter, I would
like to note that law students — and any
other Stanford students — are welcome to
use the Engineering Library, including
any computers and online resources, as
well as the Engineering Computer Cluster
and Sweet Hall.
Let us hope that schools and depart
ments within the University make an effort
to welcome undergraduates as well as grad
uate students and faculty from all areas,
while encouraging cross disciplinary inter
action in general. It will make Stanford a
friendlier — and better — university.
