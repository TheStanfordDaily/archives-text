Women's Water Polo
NCAA Championship Title Match
Sunday: UCLA 4, Stanford 3

It was UCLA that emerged as
the best team in the nation this
time around.
After both squads struggled to
find the net in the first quarter, ju
nior Wendy Watkins capitalized
on a six-on-live situation to put the
Cardinal on the board 1-0.
Stanford extended its lead to 2-0
in the second period when senior
co-captain Julie Gardner found the
net with help from teammate Bren
da Villa. At the half, the score was 2-
0.
Fhe Cardinal's lead was quickly
erased after halftime. UCLA's
Kelly Rulon posted the Bruins'
first goal less than a minute into
the third quarter.
The Bruin's Jessica Lopez took
advantage of the momentum shift
as she notched another bucket for
UCLA, off a pass from Rulon, tying
the game at 2-2.
UCLA stepped things up in the
fourth period when Lauren Hei
neck pummeled a shot into the back
of the net off a pass, as the Bruin's
took their first lead of the day.
Robin Beauregard extended
UCIA's lead to 4-2, netting her first
goal of the day with a little under

three minutes remaining in the game.
Stanford hung tight as Villa
brought the ball up the length of
the pool and connected with
sophomore Kelty Luber, who tal
lied her first goal of the day and
brought Stanford within one.
As the clock ran down, the
Cardinal failed to capitalize on a
six-on-five opportunity. UCLA
then stole a pass and controlled
possession until only seven sec
onds remained in the game. Stan
ford still had a chance but Villa's
final attempt went wide of the
cage and sealed the victory for
the Bruins.
"I was pleased with our play in
the first half, but I think we had
our failings in the second half,"
Tanner said. "After the first half,
the way [senior goalie Frank] and
our defense has played all year, I
felt we could shut them out.
"In the second half, they cut
down our frontcourt movement
and we made some critical mis
takes to let them back in the
game."
Villa added, "A team like
UCLA, if you make mistakes,
they'll capitalize."
Since the 2001 season, the Car
dinal leads the all-time series
against UCLA 11-4. In 2001, the
single loss to the Bruins cost Stan

ford the national title; last season
saw the Cardinal drop the MPSF
laurels to UCLA.
Both coaches recognize the
great rivalry that has developed

over the years and had nothing but
respect for each other's team.
"They have wonderful athletes,
a great coach and program. It
would be an honor to play [UCLA]

for the national championship,"
Tanner said.
UCLA coach Adam Krikorian
added, "This is a great rivalry that
brings out the best in the best."
