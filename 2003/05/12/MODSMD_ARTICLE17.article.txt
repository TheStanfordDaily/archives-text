Women's Tennis
NCAA Tournament (1 stand 2nd rounds)
Friday: Stanford 4, Louisiana-Monroe 0
Saturday: Stanford 4, Michigan 0

The top-seeded and twice-defending NCAA
champion Cardinal (22-1) began its weekend of dom
ination with a 4-0 victory over No. 64 Louisiana-Mon
roe (19-5) on Friday.
Although Louisiana-Monroe hails from a small
conference and was the lowest-seeded team in the
NCAA tournament, the Cardinal did not want to take
the duel lightly.
Stanford bolted to a lead in doubles with a vic
tory at No. 1 from junior Lauren Barnikow and
sophomore Erin Burdette. The duo, top-ranked
nationally, beat Nataly Ostrovska and Anna
Yenyk, 8-4.
Junior Emilia Anderson and sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates then clinched the point for the Cardi
nal at No. 3 doubles with an 8-4 win over Kelly
Bucewicz and Diana Espinal.
In singles, only one word was apt to describe the
Cardinal performance â€” impressive. Stanford
dropped only four games in its three victories as it
claimed the match win, 4-0.
Burdette turned in the first win of the day with a
routine 6-1, 6-1 victory over Bucewicz.
At No. 6 singles, the match was over before it
