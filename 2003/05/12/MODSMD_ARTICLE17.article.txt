Women's Tennis
NCAA Tournament (1 stand 2nd rounds)
Friday: Stanford 4, Louisiana-Monroe 0
Saturday: Stanford 4, Michigan 0

The top-seeded and twice-defending NCAA
champion Cardinal (22-1) began its weekend of dom
ination with a 4-0 victory over No. 64 Louisiana-Mon
roe (19-5) on Friday.
Although Louisiana-Monroe hails from a small
conference and was the lowest-seeded team in the
NCAA tournament, the Cardinal did not want to take
the duel lightly.
Stanford bolted to a lead in doubles with a vic
tory at No. 1 from junior Lauren Barnikow and
sophomore Erin Burdette. The duo, top-ranked
nationally, beat Nataly Ostrovska and Anna
Yenyk, 8-4.
Junior Emilia Anderson and sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates then clinched the point for the Cardi
nal at No. 3 doubles with an 8-4 win over Kelly
Bucewicz and Diana Espinal.
In singles, only one word was apt to describe the
Cardinal performance — impressive. Stanford
dropped only four games in its three victories as it
claimed the match win, 4-0.
Burdette turned in the first win of the day with a
routine 6-1, 6-1 victory over Bucewicz.
At No. 6 singles, the match was over before it
began. As she has done all year,
Tweedie-Yates dominated her op
ponent, Zamambo Mhkize, in a 6-
0, 6-0 shutout.
Freshman Amber Liu ended
the match with a 6-1,6-1 beating of
Matilde Taborda.
The win over Louisiana-Mon
roe marked to 22nd-straight open
ing-round victory for the Cardi
nal.
On Sunday, the Cardinal con
tinued its home court dominance
with a 4-0 beating of Michigan (14-
10). The Wolverines had beaten
Colorado 4-0 on Friday to ad
vance.
The defeat of 42nd-seeded
Michigan capped a perfect season at
theTaube Family Tennis Center for
Stanford and highlighted the
squad's dominance when sur
rounded by the comfort of the
Farm.
"I like where we're at right
now," Stanford coach Lele Forood
said. "Our top singles players are
really on their games, and I
thought we were better today in
doubles than we were yesterday."
Stanford jumped to an early 1-
0 lead in the match with always
strong doubles play from fresh
men Alice Barnes and Liu at the
No. 2 spot and Anderson and
Tweedie-Yates at No. 3 doubles to
secure the point.

Both quickly overpowered
their respective Wolverine oppo
nents— a good sign, as doubles
competition will increase greatly in
later rounds.
In singles, the Cardinal carried
over its control of Michigan while
cruising to the victory.
Tweedie- Yates led the charge at
No. 6 singles with a 6-2, 6-1 win

over Debra Streifler. The sopho
more used powerful ground
strokes to demonstrate the great
depth that the Cardinal possessed
over its Big-10 opponent.
Burdette then gave the Cardi
nal a 3-0 lead with a 6-2, 6-3 beat
ing of Leanne Rutherford at No. 3
singles.
Liu clinched the match with a 6-

1,6-0 victory over Michelle DaCos
ta. The Cardinal freshman exer
cised total control over the match,
often forcing DaCosta into errant
mishits in her quick win.
Stanford has not dropped an
NCAA tournament match since
2001, a streak that has extended
over 14 matches and has seen the
Cardinal grab two national titles.
