### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After the No. 4 Stanford (23-3, 7-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) men's tennis team's sec
ond round NCAA match on Sunday after
noon, the Taube Family Tennis Center loud
speakers blared "Georgia on my mind."

Men's Tennis
NCAA Tournament (1 stand 2nd rounds)
Saturday: Stanford 4, Oral Roberts 0
Sunday: Stanford 4, Fresno State 0

Head coach Dick Gould only plays that
song on one particular occasion -when one
of his teams qualifies for the NCAA Round
of 16, which takes place in Athens, Georgia.
The Cardinal advanced with emphatic 4-
0 victories against Oral Roberts (7-16-1) on
Saturday and Fresno State (18-9) on Sun
day.
Against Fresno State, Stanford dominat
ed the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles matches to
take a 1-0 lead.
Freshmen KC Corkery and James Pade
controlled the action from the start in an 8-
3 victory over Stefan Suta and Greg Shearer
on court two.
Sophomore Sam Warburg and junior
Carter Morris trounced Nima Roshan and
Andy Sinn 8-0 on court three.
"We came out with lots of energy and en
thusiasm," Morris said. "Sam was on fire, he
was hitting winners left and right. I just fed
off of him."
"Sam and Carter are playing really well
right now," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "They won the invitational
flight at the Pac-lOs in Ojai and they won
both their matches this weekend 8-0."
Senior Ail-Americans David Martin and
Scott Lipsky (No. 4 in the nation) were knot

ted at 5-5 with No. 21 Hector Almada and
Sergui Modoc when the Cardinal had se
cured the doubles point with victories on
courts two and three.(In NCAA tourna
ment play, once the fate of the dual-match is
decided, the remaining matches are aban
doned)
In singles, the first match to finish was at
the No. 4 position. Warburg posted a 6-4,6-
4 decision over Marc Schaerer to put the
Cardinal up 2-0.
"My opponent was a counter-puncher
for the most part," Warburg said. "I was dic
tating most points, either hitting a winner or
making an error. I definitely didn't play my
best, but the key was being patient and look
ing for the right ball to attack on."
Corkery secured the Cardinal's third
point by beating Shearer 6-4, 6-2. He has
not lost a singles match since Feb. 1.
"KC struggled in his first set today,"
Gould said. "He wasn't as sharp today as he
normally is, but it's a good thing to get our
bad matches out of the way early."
Martin, who along with Lipsky was play
ing in the last home match of his Stanford
career, clinched the victory by defeating Al
mada 6-4, 6-4.
"Almada is a really streaky player," Mar
tin said. "He's capable of hitting some huge
winners, but at the same time he misses a lot.
At the beginning of the second set I lost the
rhythm on my serve and went down a
break.
"After I got down 3-0, I focused on hit
ting the ball solidly and keeping it in the
court because he was so erratic. I got some
momentum back and then rode it for the
rest of the match.
While Stanford won 4-0, the remaining
matches were all close.
