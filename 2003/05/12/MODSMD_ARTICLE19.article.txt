# Baseball secures hat trick against Bears

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend's dominating sweep of
Southern California in Los Angeles showed
everyone in college baseball that No. 7 Stan
ford has both the bats and the arms to head
back to the College World Series Omaha for
the fifth consecutive season.

This weekend's sweep of rival California in
Berkeley showed the Cardinal also has the
heart to go with them.
Three times, Stanford (35-14, 16-5 Pacific
10 Conference) took an early lead at Evans
Diamond. Three times, the Golden Bears (27-
27, 10-14 Pac-10) responded, overtaking the
Cardinal to lead once in the eighth and twice
in the ninth. And, — in a display of resiliency
unlike any other this season — three times,
Stanford rallied in its final at-bat to win im
portant conference ballgames.

The sweep put the Cardinal three full
games ahead of No. 6 Arizona State in the con
ference standings, with the two clubs tied in the
loss column. Stanford has just one Pac-10 series
remaining — next weekend at home against
UCLA —while the Sun Devils have nine more
games to play on their league schedule.
Stanford's trio of come-from-behind wins in
Berkeley made it 14 consecutive road wins for
the team and seven straight victories overall. It
was also the Cardinal's third consecutive sweep
of, and 10th straight victory over, the Golden
Bears.
"It's a testament to our confidence and abil
ities to come back and win a game like this,"
Fuld said after Saturday's victory, though his
comments applied to all three games. "We
have the ability to fight and battle back, and
the more we do it, the better we get."
Friday afternoon's contest proved to be the
tone-setting affair of the series, a roller-coaster
ride of a ballgame that saw a 6-0 Stanford lead
after the game's first seven batters.
Bears third baseman Conor Jackson
capped a four-run fifth-inning with a three
run homer off junior David O'Hagan, who
had relieved Stanford starter John Hudgins

with one out after junior Carlos Quentin
dropped a fly ball in right.
Hudgins lasted just 4 1/3 innings, allowing
seven runs (five earned) and walking four
against just one strikeout. The outing was the
second consecutive shaky sun t for the poten
tially tired Cardinal ace, who has logged more
than 108 innings this season.
The Bears took the lead in the next frame
after O'Hagan surrendered another blast -
this time of the two-run variety - and Stanford
trailed until a clutch two-out RBI triple in the
eighth by junior Brian Hall made it 8-8.
Senior Ryan Garko, who hit his team-lead
ing 14th homer in the first, singled in the win
ning run with two outs in the ninth for the 9-8
win.
Freshman reliever Kodiak Quick earned
his second career win, holding California
scoreless over his 3 2/3 innings with a fine
two-hit, three-strikeout performance. Matt
Manship, the Cardinal's closer-turned
starter-turned-closer-again, got the Bears'
final hope to ground into a fielder's choice,
ending the game and giving the freshman
