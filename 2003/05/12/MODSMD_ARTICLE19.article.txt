### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend's dominating sweep of
Southern California in Los Angeles showed
everyone in college baseball that No. 7 Stan
ford has both the bats and the arms to head
back to the College World Series Omaha for
the fifth consecutive season.

This weekend's sweep of rival California in
Berkeley showed the Cardinal also has the
heart to go with them.
Three times, Stanford (35-14, 16-5 Pacific
10 Conference) took an early lead at Evans
Diamond. Three times, the Golden Bears (27-
27, 10-14 Pac-10) responded, overtaking the
Cardinal to lead once in the eighth and twice
in the ninth. And, — in a display of resiliency
unlike any other this season — three times,
Stanford rallied in its final at-bat to win im
portant conference ballgames.

The sweep put the Cardinal three full
games ahead of No. 6 Arizona State in the con
ference standings, with the two clubs tied in the
loss column. Stanford has just one Pac-10 series
remaining — next weekend at home against
UCLA —while the Sun Devils have nine more
games to play on their league schedule.
Stanford's trio of come-from-behind wins in
Berkeley made it 14 consecutive road wins for
the team and seven straight victories overall. It
was also the Cardinal's third consecutive sweep
of, and 10th straight victory over, the Golden
Bears.
"It's a testament to our confidence and abil
ities to come back and win a game like this,"
Fuld said after Saturday's victory, though his
comments applied to all three games. "We
have the ability to fight and battle back, and
the more we do it, the better we get."
Friday afternoon's contest proved to be the
tone-setting affair of the series, a roller-coaster
ride of a ballgame that saw a 6-0 Stanford lead
after the game's first seven batters.
Bears third baseman Conor Jackson
capped a four-run fifth-inning with a three
run homer off junior David O'Hagan, who
had relieved Stanford starter John Hudgins

with one out after junior Carlos Quentin
dropped a fly ball in right.
Hudgins lasted just 4 1/3 innings, allowing
seven runs (five earned) and walking four
against just one strikeout. The outing was the
second consecutive shaky sun t for the poten
tially tired Cardinal ace, who has logged more
than 108 innings this season.
The Bears took the lead in the next frame
after O'Hagan surrendered another blast -
this time of the two-run variety - and Stanford
trailed until a clutch two-out RBI triple in the
eighth by junior Brian Hall made it 8-8.
Senior Ryan Garko, who hit his team-lead
ing 14th homer in the first, singled in the win
ning run with two outs in the ninth for the 9-8
win.
Freshman reliever Kodiak Quick earned
his second career win, holding California
scoreless over his 3 2/3 innings with a fine
two-hit, three-strikeout performance. Matt
Manship, the Cardinal's closer-turned
starter-turned-closer-again, got the Bears'
final hope to ground into a fielder's choice,
ending the game and giving the freshman

yet another save out of the bullpen
- the first of two on the weekend.
On Saturday, Stanford fell be
hind 4-2 entering the ninth after
taking a first-inning 1 -0 lead. After
freshman Jed Lowrie and sopho
more Chris Carter both doubled
to lead off the inning, Hall pinch
ran for Carter and stole third
without so much as a throw. A wild
pitch by the Bears' Matt Brown al
lowed him to score to tie the game,
and juniors Sam Fuld and
Quentin came up with RBI singles
to complete Stanford's four-run,
game-winning rally.
Freshman hurler Mark Ro
manczuk gave the Cardinal 7 1/3
quality innings in the 6-4 win but
finished with a no-decision, allow
ing four runs (three earned) and
scattering six hits. Senior Ryan
McCally recorded two outs in the
bottom of the eighth in relief of
the freshman left-hander, picking
up his fourth win of the season.
Manship stepped into a tie for the
Pac-10 lead in saves (7) after pitch
ing the ninth.
Stanford's heroics in Sunday's
series finale belonged to sophomore
Danny Putnam, who sprinted from
first to home on an errant throw by
California's pitcher in the top of the
10th, scoring the eventual winning
run for the Cardinal with two outs.
"I saw the ball thrown away, and

1 was just going to keep running
until somebody stopped me," Put
nam said after beating a close play at
the plate to secure the 5-4 win.
The man in charge of sending
Putnam, Cardinal associate head
coach and third base coach Dean
Stotz, barely entertained the
thought of holding Putnam at third.
"1 have to make them make a
play," Stotz said. "I'm a veiy aggres
sive base coach and with two outs
you need to really force the issue. I
was thinking about bringing him
home the whole way."
Brian Hall's defensive gem in
the ninth — an unassisted double
play that ended a Bears threat -
led to a raucous celebration by the
Cardinal players, who at that
point were without head coach
Mark Marquess, ejected for argu
ing a reversed call earlier in the
inning.
The excitement of Putnam's
game-winning slide followed a
blown Cardinal lead in the eighth
when Jackson homered to tie it at 4-
4.
O'Hagan earned his sixth win
with 2 2/3 hidess innings to close out
the contest, bouncing back from his
rough outing on Friday. Senior
starter Tim Cunningham put forth
another encouraging performance,
allowing just two runs in his six in
nings of work.
"Today was an unbelievable fin
ish to a crazy weekend of good base
ball,"said Putnam. "Nobody on this
team likes to lose, and we're going to
do anything we can do not to."
