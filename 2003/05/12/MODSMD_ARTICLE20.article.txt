this weekend during its last series of conference play.

Friday: No. 17 Stanford 9, Oregon State 3
Saturday: No. 18 Oregon 7, Stanford 0
Sunday: Stanford 5, Oregon 1

The Stanford bats turned on the power to bring two
convincing victories over the three-game series back to the
Farm, posting a 9-3 win over Oregon State (31-28,4-15)
and earning another victory against No. 18 Oregon (32-
17, 10-11). The Cardinal dropped the opener of its dou
bleheader with the Ducks, but was able to bounce back in
the 5-1 win to end the regular season with a victory.
The battles began in Corvallis, Ore. on Friday night,
in what became an epic comeback.
Junior hurler Dana Sorensen, after allowing three
OSU runs in the first, began to quell the Beaver bats and
shut diem out for the next four innings of the game.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the offensive tables
began to turn, and this time it was OSU pitcher Mon
ica Hoffman who was unable to hold off the Stanford
hitters.
The Cardinal offense broke through in the fifth in
ning, stringing together six hits and scoring five runs.
Senior second baseman Kira Ching initiated the rally
with a leadoff single. Sophomore third baseman Eliza
beth Bendig followed Ching's lead with another single
up the middle, opening the door for senior first base
man Maureen LeCocq. LeCocq's double off the left field
wall brought Ching home for the first Cardinal run.
With the tying run on second base, sophomore des
ignated player Leah Nelson stepped up with a two-run
single to tie the game at 3-3.
But the singles kept on coming, with the next pair
from sophomore right fielder Katherine Hoffman and
freshman shortstop Lauren Lappin. Following four
consecutive base hits, senior left fielder Cassi Brang
ham's shallow fly ball to left field was mishandled and
Stanford increased its lead to 5-3.
Fhe fifth inning rally ended there and, when the

Beavers came back to the plate, senior pitcher Tori Ny
berg was in the circle. Nyberg retired OSU in order in
the fifth and continued to shut them out for remainder
of the game.
And the Cardinal bats continued to rally.
Stanford sealed the win with four insurance runs in the
seventh, as junior catcher Jessica Allister cleared the bases
with her 11th home run of the year after two runs came
home thanks to Brangham.
The 9-3 win over the Beavers was followed by a trip
to Eugene to take on the Ducks and end the Pac-10
season.
The opener did not go as the Cardinal had hoped, as
Oregon took the first game with a convincing 7-0
shutout.
Nyberg started in the circle and allowed die first run of
the game, giving the Ducks an early lead. Oregon would
continue to produce at the plate for the following five in
nings of play and take advantage of the long ball as the
Ducks sent four homers over the fence in their win.
But, the Cardinal bounced back in the second half of
the twin-bill, as it pounded out eight hits and scored live
runs in a 5-1 win.
The Ducks were on the boards early again but Stan
ford answered back in a hurry. The Cardinal scored its
first two runs of the day in the top of the second-arid
each run was chalked up with two outs.
The inning would end with Stanford up one, but
even that was too close for comfort for the Cardinal.
Stanford increased its lead in the third when
Bendig's base hit plated Allister. While the Cardinal bats
kept swinging, Sorensen continued to shut down the
Ducks for the final six innings of the face-off.
The final Cardinal attack came in the top of the sev
enth, when Ching sent a double down the right field line
for the 5-1 win.
The Cardinal hopes that it can continue to rack up wins
in the next couple of weeks as the postseason takes off.
"We got a couple wins going into postseason which is
good," Brangham said. "I think we are finding ways to
win even when everything is not clicking. I think it is
promising that we can win in a lot of different ways,
something we will probably have to do in the postseason.
"Coming back in the double header to win was also
big, because it is definitely something we might have to
do in regionals."
