# Women's golf prepares to tee off at nationals
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the performance of the
Stanford women's golf team was
anything but dominant this week
end, it was good enough to secure
the eighth and final national cham
pionship berth. It will be the Cardi
nal's 15th consecutive NCAA ap
pearance.
Southern California won this
year's NCAA Western Regional by 10
shots, firing a 6-over-par 870 over 54
holes.
Stanford finished with a three
round total of 905, and UNLV's
Sunny Oh took home the individual
crown, shooting a five-under par
211.
Play began on Thursday at the
par-72, 6256-yard Karsten Golf
Course in Tempe, Ariz., and Arizona
State played host at its home track.
Through the first two rounds,
(JSC built itself a large lead in the
team competition, thanks to a combi
nation of youth and experience.
Freshman Tanya Dergal, who had
never won a collegiate event, stood in
second place at two strokes under par

through 36 holes.
Dergal was just four shots otf Oh's
leading pace. At 2-over-par 146, Der
gal's senior teammate and first-team
All-American Mikaela Parmlid was
tied for fifth place overall.
Parmlid has a pair of collegiate vic
tories to her credit, and finished in a
tie for second place at last year's West
ern Regional.
While the Trojans were pulling
out to a comfortable nine-stroke lead
in the first two rounds, the Cardinal's
existence was anything but comfort
able, as the team battled the cut line
all weekend.
In order to qualify for the upcom
ing NCAA Championship, Stanford
needed to finish in the top eight in a
field of 21.
During the first two days of com
petition, the team was led by fresh
man Kelly Husted.
She followed up an even-par 72 in
the first round with a 77 in the sec
ond, and found herself in 17th place
individually after 36 holes.
Stanford's senior leader Kim Row
ton was just two shots back of her
teammate on Friday night, carding
scores of 76 and 75 to place 31st.

Rowton led the Cardinal with a
19th-place finish at last year's West
ern Regional.
Juniors Kim Kouwabunpat and
Angela Rho followed different paths,
but found themselves tied for 47th
place after two rounds of play.
Kouwabunpat, who struggled to a
55th-place finish at last year's event,
opened with a 4-over-par 76, follow
ing it up with a 79 in the second
round.
Coming off a top-25 performance
a year ago, Rho exchanged scores
with her teammate, shooting 79-76
fora 13-over-par total going into the
final day.
The recent struggles of sopho
more Wendra Liang continued, as
she shot 77-81 to land in 67th place.
After two rounds, the Cardinal was
perched rather precariously, clinging
desperately to the final championship
berth in eighth place.
While Stanford was just five shots
behind seventh-place Washington
State, the Cardinal also stood clear of
ninth-place Illinois by the same slim
margin.
The Cardinal needed a solid final
round to secure its spot in the NCAA

Championship and got it, recording
its best score of the tournament — a
9-over-par 297.
Husted refused to fade on the
third day, posting a 77.
Although she was not as sharp as
she had been the first two days, the
freshman hung tough, battling to a
25th-place finish.
"It can be easy to think too much
about the importance of the tourna
ment and put pressure on yourself,"
Husted said. "I just tried to stay real
ly focused on every shot."
Rowton's experience, on the other
hand, shined through on Saturday.
On a day when many at the top
of the leader board were headed in
reverse, she carded a solid round
of even par, moving up to 20th
place.
It was Rowton's third top-20 per
formance in four career appearances
at the West Regional.
Kouwabunpat also played well on
Saturday, shooting a 73, and moving
up to a tie for 34th.
Rho carded a final-round 75,
wrapping up the event in 43rd place.
A final-round 81 dropped Liang to
79th place overall.

ing it up with a 79 in the second
round.
Coming off a top-25 performance
a year ago, Rho exchanged scores
with her teammate, shooting 79-76
fora 13-over-par total going into the
final day.
The recent struggles of sopho
more Wendra Liang continued, as
she shot 77-81 to land in 67th place.
After two rounds, the Cardinal was
perched rather precariously, clinging
desperately to the final championship
berth in eighth place.
While Stanford was just five shots
behind seventh-place Washington
State, the Cardinal also stood clear of
ninth-place Illinois by the same slim
margin.
The Cardinal needed a solid final
round to secure its spot in the NCAA

Championship and got it, recording
its best score of the tournament — a
9-over-par 297.
Husted refused to fade on the
third day, posting a 77.
Although she was not as sharp as
she had been the first two days, the
freshman hung tough, battling to a
25th-place finish.
"It can be easy to think too much
about the importance of the tourna
ment and put pressure on yourself,"
Husted said. "I just tried to stay real
ly focused on every shot."
Rowton's experience, on the other
hand, shined through on Saturday.
On a day when many at the top
of the leader board were headed in
reverse, she carded a solid round
of even par, moving up to 20th
place.
It was Rowton's third top-20 per
formance in four career appearances
at the West Regional.
Kouwabunpat also played well on
Saturday, shooting a 73, and moving
up to a tie for 34th.
Rho carded a final-round 75,
wrapping up the event in 43rd place.
