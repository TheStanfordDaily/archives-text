Union Local 1877 marched clown University Avenue
in Palo Alto on Friday to protest the refusal of many
Silicon Valley institutions to pay tor their janitors'
health insurance. About 300 people attended, in
cluding several Stanford workers and students.
"Surrounded by the affluence of Palo Alto, it's
ridiculous that these families can't afford health in
surance," said sophomore Antonio lannarone, carry
ing a sign that said "Health, food, or rent?"
Most janitors employed by high-tech companies in
the area are under a contract that pays them $10.04
per hour, but also requires them to pay $77 per
month for health insurance. This expense is sched
uled to rise to $145 per month on June 1. Most of
these janitors take home about $1,400 per month.
SEIU is pressuring large employers in the area to
cover part of their janitors' health insurance bill. The

union local will strike on May 17 if workers are not
guaranteed fully-paid family health benefits.
Most janitors are employed by one of around 70
different maintenance subcontractors, but the union
is directing its efforts against the high-tech companies
that hire these subcontractors because of their higher
public profile and greater ability to cover health-care
costs.
The approximately 120 janitors, who are mem
bers of Local 1877 and work at Stanford, are em
ployed through the subcontractor American Build
ing Maintenance.
The union's contract with ABM expired on May 1,
when the two sides were not able to agree on the issue
of health benefits. They decided to extend contract
talks for two weeks when the contract expired.
The University has a long-standing policy of non
intervention in negotiations between unions and sub
contractors and has not involved itself in the current
round of negotiations between Local 1877 and ABM.
Stanford SEIU organizer Flor de Leon explained
that, despite the recession, Bay Area institutions can
afford to be "responsible community members" and
meet the union's demands.
