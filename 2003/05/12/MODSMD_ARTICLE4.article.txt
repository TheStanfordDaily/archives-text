# Thousands flock to annual Powwow
## Weekend event celebrates Native-American culture 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ululating voices, the jingle of bells
and the sweet scent of incense lingered
in the air of the 32nd annual Stanford
Powwow, a community-wide event
hosted by the Stanford American Indi
an Organization that attracted nearly
30,000 people to campus over the
weekend.

"It's one of the larger powwows in
California," said Juliette Jeanne, a coter
minal student in earth systems and one
of the co-chairs of the organizing com
mittee. "The sense that I get from a lot
of people is that it's just a place that they
know they're going to run into a lot of
family and friends."
The powwow included a diverse col
lection of performances whose roots lie
in the culture of various Native Ameri
can tribes.
"It's not all dancing," Jeanne said.
"There's singing, drum contests, and we
also have hand-drum contests, which is

just an individual singer. You use a
small drum with it."
The dances, however, were the most
crowd-pleasing performances. Be
decked in the traditional regalia of
tribes from across the United States, the
performers took part in dances like
Grass, Fancy, Southern Straight and
Northern Traditional.
"We've got some other things,"
Jeanne said. "[There's] switch dance,
where girls dress up as guys and guys
dress up as girls and kind of clown
around, have fun. The audience
gets to pick the winner on that —
whoever's the funniest."
Benjamin Zatith, an event par
ticipant from Los Angeles, took
part in the Teen Boys' Fancy
Dancing.
"Fancy dance is the evolu
tion," said Zatith, dressed in re
galia replete with leather,
feathers and bells. "It's time.
It's how we evolved. We didn't
have [these elaborate outfits] a
long time ago — it's modern
times."
Zatith's outfit itself is part of
the tradition. His brother first
made it years ago and Zatith has
performed in it for the last three
years in the Fancy Dance event,
which was the last of the night.
"They put us last because we're
the big show," he said.
The circular performance area

was ringed by a collection of ven
dor booths — some housed in
teepees — selling food, art, jewel
ry and other hand-crafted goods.
"My favorite [event] is buy
ing stuff," said 9-year-old Brit
tany from Pleasant Hills, Calif.
Her cherished acquisition from
the day was a small, two-sided
drum.
Her mom, Sue, focused on the
performances, instead.
"I like seeing the costumes,"
she said. "My favorites are the
ones with all the feathers on
them. And then 1 like looking at
the jewelry and how everything
was hand-made."
Brandon Adams, another 9-
year-old, liked the dances as
well, especially 'the one with jin
gles,' he said. He came to the
powwow with his mother from
San Jose.
"It means a lot for the Bay Area
community," Jeanne said. "They
know they're going to see family
or friends — people they haven't
seen in a long time."
