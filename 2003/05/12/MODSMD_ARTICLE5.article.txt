Last night marked the eighth consecutive sold-out
Mela — a showcase of South Asian culture and its di
verse heritage. The three-hour show featured various
dances from the region, as well as a cappella and violin
performances.
"It was really fun to see the different dances," said
sophomore Kasey Alderete. "There were so many dif
ferent energy levels and it was very fun to see people on
campus dressed up their cultural clothing."
Dances included fast-paced bhangra, Bollywood
numbers and classical Odissi and Bharat Natyam per
formances.
Sanskriti Treasurer Nithya Vaduganathan and
event organizer Shalini Ahmed, both sophomores, said
that they felt very positively about the show.
"The audience loved the diversity of performances,"
Vaduganathan said on behalf of Mela's organizers. "It's
been a great bonding experience. And being on stage
was amazing."
There was also a Tarangum dance, in which sopho
more Shilpi Agarwal displayed complicated footwork
by locking her toes in place and balancing on the edges
of a brass plate.
"It was lots of hard work, but also lots of fun," Agar
wal said. "I'm relieved that it's over, but I'm also very
glad that I did it. It's been a great experience."
Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian society, orga
nized the show. This is the 11th annual Mela —
meaning "festival" or "celebration" — that Sanskri
ti has organized in its 14-year existence. It's been ad
vertised as "a celebration of South Asian arts and
culture."
"It was an awesome show — one of the best Melas
I've seen," said Mamta Mehta, Class of 2002, who came
back to campus to watch her friends perform. "It beats
Berkeley's show by far this year."
The event also attracted many people from outside
the Stanford community. Ram Kumar Das of San Jose
came to watch the daughter of a family friend perform.
He described the show as "excellent."

Students perform in Mela 2003, an annual showcase of South Asian music and
dance, last night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The more than 100 performers
have been practicing for about
three hours a day for the last few
weeks.
"I have had so much fun doing
this that the number of hours just

disappeared," said freshman Jay
Pandit, who was in three perfor
mances, including an a cappella
performance by the newly
formed South Asian group
named Browntown. "I have been
doing something that I really love
to do."
Mela also featured some fusions
between South Asian and Western
music, including a Raas dance fi

nale that was set to rapper 50
Cent's "In Da Club."
"These last several weeks, day
and night, we've been working to
ward this climax," said senior Surag
Mantri on behalf of himself and ju
nior Shalin Mantri. "Hopefully, it's
been enjoyable for the audience —
as well as a treat for mothers on
Mother's Day — and an eclectic dis
play of South Asian culture."
