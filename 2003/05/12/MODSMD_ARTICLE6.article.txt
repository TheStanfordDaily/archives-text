# Travel policy to halt alumni study in Cuba
## 
### ERICA O'YOUNG 
Stanford and Cuba won't be exchang
ing students and faculty anymore, after
the University's government-issued li
cense to send travelers expires on May Sl.
On March 24, the U.S. Treasury De
partment's Office of Foreign Assets Con
trol eliminated the special licenses educa
tional travel program, originally promot
ed by the Clinton administration. An
nounced in October 1995, the "people
to-people exchange" granted an educa
tional license to freelance journalists and
persons traveling for professional re
search, educational, religious or humani
tarian reasons. The license exempted
them from the U.S. embargo on trade
and financial relations with Cuba.
In August 1999, the Stanford Alumni
Association's Travel / Study Program was
granted its first special license to visit
Cuba. Upon approval of academic credit
and faculty endorsement, any Stanford
student, alumni or employee could visit
Cuba on an individual visit or along with
other participants in annual trips orga
nized by Stanford's Travel/Study Pro
gram. Last month, the Treasury Depart
ment notified the program that Stan
ford's current license, which expires May
31, will not be renewed. Stanford's Trav
el / Study Program annually supports
160 to 180 Stanford affiliates in individ
ual and group-organized trips to Cuba.
"It makes me really sad," commented
Whitney Stull, '99, a member of the
Young Alumni Association who visited

Cuba from March '29 to April 17 through
the program. "I don't think I've ever
learned so much before ... It was just a
really amazing combination of having
our [accompanying] professor's lectures
fora macro-level view and the people we
talked to in Cuba fora micro-level view,"
he said.
The elimination of the educational li
censes is part of the Bush administra
tion's tightening of its Cuba policy, in
light of Cuban President Fidel Castro's
April crackdown on Cuban dissidents
and heightened U.S. suspicions about
Cuba's biological weapon capabilities.
Another reason for ending the educa
tional licenses is the Bush administra
tion's belief that travelers often used them
for vacation, not education.
"The license was being abused," Tay
lor Griffin, spokesman for the U.S. Trea
sury Department, told The New York
Times last week. "It undermined the in
tention of the U.S. sanctions against
Cuba, which are to deprive the Castro
regime of the financial wherewithal to
continue to oppress its people."
The nation's prominent cultural insti
tutions are expected to be the hardest hit
by the new regulations. Hie Metropoli
tan Museum of Art, the American Muse
um of Natural History, the Harvard Uni
versity Art Museums and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation regularly
organize trips to Cuba for their members.

A group of alumni visited this tobacco farmer in Vinalles, Cuba during spring break as part
of a University-sponsored travel / study program. This was the last trip of its kind.
Stanford's Travel/Study Pro
gram, expressed his frustration
at the loss of what he believes is an
invaluable learning experience.
"The greatest value was that
anybody in the Stanford com
munity was given the opportu
nity to experience Cuba and . . .

reach their own conclusions
about the people in Cuba, about
communism, et cetera," Beard
sley said. "And more important
than anything they would learn
about Cuba is what they would
learn about the U.S."
He added, "I'm a little frustrat
ed that our government is taking
the opportunity away from us, and
I'm wondering what they have to
hide."
Participants of Stanford's T rav

el / Study program conveyed
their disappointment in seeing
the Cuba trips end.
"Travel is one of the most in
credible educational opportu
nities anyone can have," Stull
emphasized. "It's a shame that
people won't be able to have
that incredible educational ex
ploration. It goes a long way to
ward discovering what it means
to be American in the world
context."
