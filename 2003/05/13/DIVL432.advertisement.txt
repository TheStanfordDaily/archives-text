Gorgeous Dre — don't
start any beefs!
I am calling you out for
calling me a cheat in
yesterday's (May 12)
classifieds. Even if I did
spend time faking a liigli
score at Zookeeper, would
I be so dumb as to end it in
an eight? I think not.
Even though you may
have never seen a score end
in anything but a 0, I stand
by my reputation — I did
not cheat at Zookeeper. If
you'd like to make
something of it, the gauntlet
will be thrown down at
XOX any time you desire an
asswhoopin'.
Keep my name out yo'
mouth and we'll keep it
the same.
