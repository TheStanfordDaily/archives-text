WHAT HAPPENED TO PALESTINE?
The Stanford Community Remembers Palestine
Before 1948 y there was a country called Palestine. What happened?
Theodor Herzl wrote in his diaries about how to bring about the exodus of the native Palestinians, which
would enable the Zionists to create a purely Jewish state. Herzl's entry in his diary for June 12, 1895 was:
"We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us. We should try to spirit the
penniless Arab population across the borders by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while
denying it any employment in our country."
The process of expropriating the property of the Palestinians was carried out during and in the aftermath
of the war of 1948. Large-scale massacres were the instrument for forcing the Palestinians to leave and then
seizing their properties under the 1950 Absentee Property Law.
"The compulsory transfer of the [Palestinian] Arabs from the valleys of the proposed Jewish state could give
us something which we never had, even when we stood on our own during the days of the first and second
Temples... We are given an opportunity which we never dared to dream of in our wildest imaginings. This
is more than a state, government and sovereignty—this is national consolidation in a free homeland"
David Ben-Gurion, 1937
