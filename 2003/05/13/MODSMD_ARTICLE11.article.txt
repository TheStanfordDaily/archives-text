## U.S. holds talks with Iran 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —With
American troops dug in for long
stays in Afghanistan and Iraq, the
United States has been holding
unannounced talks with Iran, a
country that shares long borders
with both, officials said yesterday.
The discussions began not
long after the Afghan war started
in the fall of 2001 and initially
were largely limited to develop
ments in Afghanistan. They have
been expanded recently to in
clude exchanges on Iraq, with
which Iran fought an eight-year
war in the 1980s.
The talks have been held in
Geneva, under auspices of the
United Nations.
"This is not somehow a new
opening of diplomatic relations.
This is an opportunity to deal with
some issues," State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said.
The two countries broke diplo
matic relations after the takeover
of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in

November 1979.
Iran has seemed inflexibly op
posed to reopening normal rela
tions, although Hashemi Rafsan
jani, Iran's still-influential former
president, raised eyebrows recent
ly when he suggested a referen
dum on whether to improve rela
tions with the United States.
Reeker said the United States
has used the Geneva channel to
reaffirm U.S. concerns about Iran
ian involvement with groups re
garded as terrorist as well as the
country's alleged development of
weapons of mass destruction and its
opposition to efforts to bring peace
between the Israelis and the Arabs.
U.S. officials involved in the
Geneva talks include Ryan Grock
er, a top official in the State De
partment's Middle East Bureau;
and Zalmay Khalilzhad, a White
House diplomatic troubleshooter
in the region.
On Iraq, American irritation
with Iran grew from the ethnic

Persian state's dispatch of Shiite
militants into Arab Iraq to boost
the fortunes of Iraqi Shiites as the
post-Saddam transition proceeds.
For its part, Iran is worried that
the United States may install an anti-
Iranian administration in Baghdad.
On Afghanistan, the United
States wants to keep political med
dling in that country to a mini
mum. Iran has exerted influence
in across its border in western
Afghanistan for years.
The discussions in the Geneva
channel fall far short of the new re
lationship that the former Clinton
administration eagerly sought
with Iran after the election of a
moderate president in 1997.
Iran's conservative clerics, who
are in charge of security, rebuffed
the U.S. overtures of that era, and
Bush has shown little interest in fol
lowing his predecessor's initiative.
He put Iran in the "axis of evil"
camp with Iraq and North Korea
in Jan. 2002.
