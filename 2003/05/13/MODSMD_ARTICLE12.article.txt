VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) — Suicide
bombers exploded a truck laden with explo
sives at a government compound in northern
Chechnya yesterday, reducing eight buildings
to rubble and killing at least 41 people.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the
attack was aimed at derailing a resolution of the
3 1/2-year-old war.
Three suicide-bombers, including one
woman, carried out the attack in the town of
Znamenskoye, Russian Deputy Prosecutor
General Sergei Fridinsky told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.

The explosion, which had the force of at
least 1.3 tons of TNT, wounded more than 110
people, 57 of them critically, said Maj.-Gen.
Ruslan Avtayev. Nearly all the dead were civil
ians, including six children under the age of 12.
No one claimed responsibility, but officials
immediately blamed Chechen rebels.
"All such actions are aimed at one thing:
stopping the process of the settlement of the sit
uation in Chechnya, the process of political set
tlement," Putin told Cabinet members in tele
vised comments. "We cannot and will not allow
anything of the kind."

Chechen voters in March overwhelmingly
approved a Kremlin-promoted constitution
that cements the region's status as part of Rus
sia.
Moscow, which has refused to negotiate with
rebel leaders, has called the referendum a key
step on the road to peace and said it proves the
situation in Chechnya is stabilizing.
But yesterday's blast underlined the vio
lence that continues to roil Chechnya. In De
cember, a truck bomb killed at least 70 people
at the headquarters of the Moscow-backed
Chechen administration in the capital, Grozny.
