### 
CLENVIEW, 111. (AP) — A sub
urban high school yesterday sus
pended several seniors involved in
a brutal off-campus hazing melee
and will recommend the girls be
expelled.
Principal Michael Riggle of
Glenbrook North High said he
took the steps after the district's
lawyer advised him that the school
had broader powers to discipline
students for the videotaped inci
dent than he had thought.
The 10-day suspensions are the
longest the school can mete out,
Riggle said. It would be up to the
district to decide whether to expel
the students, which would bar them
not only from campus but from the
prom and graduation ceremonies.
"We have never tolerated ac
tions of this nature within our
school or by our students within
the community, nor will we now or
in the future," Higgle said.

Junior girls from the school were
beaten and showered with mud,
feces and garbage by seniors on
May 4 at a Cook County park. Five
girls were injured seriously enough
that they had to go to the hospital.
The video has been shown on
national television, to the embar
rassment of the well-to-do Chicago
suburb of Northbrook.
Riggle wouldn't say how many
students were suspended, citing the
privacy of educational records. He
said only senior girls who participat
ed in the hazing were suspended,
not other students who watched.
All those suspended will be rec
ommended for expulsion, he said.
Expulsion from the school
would not prevent seniors from
graduating. Those seniors who
have not yet earned enough cred
its to graduate will be sent to "al
ternative education" to complete
their studies, Higgle said.
