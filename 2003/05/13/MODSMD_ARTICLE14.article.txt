# Saudi Arabia attack:
## At least 50 injured

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
(AP) â€” Hours before a visit by
the American secretary of suite,
attackers shot their way into
three compounds housing
Westerners and Saudis and set
off car bombs, officials said. At
least 50 people were injured, a
hospital official said.
The string of attacks oc
curred in quick succession,
capped by a fourth explosion
early today outside the head
quarters of a joint U.S.-Saudi
owned company in Riyadh.
U.S. and Saudi officials said
they suspected the al-Qaida ter
ror network was behind the
bombings.
"We don't know how many
are injured, but we received 50
and the number is growing," an
official at the National Guard
Hospital in Riyadh told The As
sociated Press by telephone,
without identifying himself.
"We're very busy, we are receiv
ing a lot of casualties."
Smoke rose into the night sky
from one of the attacked com
pounds, located in the Garnata
neigborhood in eastern Riyadh,
and a helicopter circled over
head, scanning the ground with
a searchlight. Hundreds of anti
riot police and members of the
elite National Guard were evac
uating the area and sealing it off
as ambulances rushed in.
The compounds are upscale
gated communities housing cor
porate executives and other

professionals. About half of
them are Westerners, mostly
British, Italian and French but
also some Americans, and the
rest Saudis and other Arabs, a
Saudi official said.
Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell will go to Saudi Arabia today
as scheduled, a U.S. official trav
elling with him said on condi
tion of anonymity. Powell, who
is currently in neighboring Jor
dan, is seeking the Saudis' help
in harnessing militant groups
and in promoting Palestinian
reform in the latest stop on a
Mideast tour that has already
taken him to Israel, the West
Bank and Egypt.
At the White House,
spokeswoman Ashley Snee
said, "The State Department is
gathering information on the
ground and will continue to
monitor the situation."
State Department press offi
cer Nancy Beck said she could
not confirm if there were any
American casualties. "We are
advising American citizens to re
main at home until we ascertain
the nature of any ongoing
threat," she said.
A counterintelligence official
in Washington said intelligence
from the past two weeks indicat
ed al-Qaida was close to launch
ing a strike in Saudi Arabia. The
State Department advised Amer
icans earlier his month against
travel to Saudi Arabia because of
increased terrorism concerns.
