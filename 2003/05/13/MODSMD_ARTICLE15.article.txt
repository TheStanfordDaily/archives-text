### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On April 17, Prof. On in Robin
son, the director of the Intro
duction to the Humanities
program, presented a 1,234-
page self-study to the Faculty Senate.
Begun in fall quarter of 2001, the report
looks at all aspects of the program, from
student culture to faculty diversity.
The report, which is available at ihum
study.stanford.edu, was accepted by the
Senate with no objection. Faculty praised
the self-study and the effort of the com
mittee that conducted the study.
At the meeting, Drama Prof. Marry
Elam, a former director of the program,
said, "The level of work that the committee
puts into it is incredible."
However, the predominantly positive
tone of the short executive summary and
core report does not reflect the fact that
many of the student comments about the
program were negative. The fact that the
report was conducted by the program ad
ministrators has also caused some to ques
tion its validity.
Methodology of the self-study
The Faculty Senate legislation that es
tablished I-Hum calls fora self-study at the
five-year mark in its life.
In consultation with Ann Porteus, a lec
turer at the School of Education and a spe
cialist in assessment, the program set up
focus groups with students and wrote stu
dent surveys to gather input. Porteus'
graduate students were fielded to lead the
focus groups.

The data was compiled largely by
Robinson, who placed himself under the
supervision of the I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee â€” an ad-hoc group he ap
pointed to supervise his conduct during
the study. In compiling the data, the Advi
sory Committee acted as a referee to en
sure that Robinson was fair in reporting I-
Hum's strengths and weaknesses.
During the process, Robinson consult

ed with the Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Advisory Committee on Curricu
lum, which, according to Robinson, was
mainly concerned with the impact I-Hum
has on departmental programs. Because
I-Hum can lure faculty away from teach
ing more advanced classes that lead to
ward departmental majors, programs of
study for advanced students can suffer.
Finally, the I-Hum Governance Board

signed oft on the report, which was then
presented to the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy. That com
mittee accepted the report, and from
there it was presented to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"I was pleased, and I guess you never
know with the Faculty Senate," Robinson
said. "Even though our names are on the
cover of the report, we tried to make it as

impartial as possible."
Cheri Ross, associate director of I-
Hum, added that Robinson had been
careful in compiling student, teaching fel
low, and faculty comments that the I HUM
Review Advisory Committee had com
mended him.
