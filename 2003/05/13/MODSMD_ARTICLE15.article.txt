# A 						closer look at
## The 						freshman experience Self-study on I-Hum downplays concerns 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On April 17, Prof. On in Robin
son, the director of the Intro
duction to the Humanities
program, presented a 1,234-
page self-study to the Faculty Senate.
Begun in fall quarter of 2001, the report
looks at all aspects of the program, from
student culture to faculty diversity.
The report, which is available at ihum
study.stanford.edu, was accepted by the
Senate with no objection. Faculty praised
the self-study and the effort of the com
mittee that conducted the study.
At the meeting, Drama Prof. Marry
Elam, a former director of the program,
said, "The level of work that the committee
puts into it is incredible."
However, the predominantly positive
tone of the short executive summary and
core report does not reflect the fact that
many of the student comments about the
program were negative. The fact that the
report was conducted by the program ad
ministrators has also caused some to ques
tion its validity.
Methodology of the self-study
The Faculty Senate legislation that es
tablished I-Hum calls fora self-study at the
five-year mark in its life.
In consultation with Ann Porteus, a lec
turer at the School of Education and a spe
cialist in assessment, the program set up
focus groups with students and wrote stu
dent surveys to gather input. Porteus'
graduate students were fielded to lead the
focus groups.

The data was compiled largely by
Robinson, who placed himself under the
supervision of the I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee — an ad-hoc group he ap
pointed to supervise his conduct during
the study. In compiling the data, the Advi
sory Committee acted as a referee to en
sure that Robinson was fair in reporting I-
Hum's strengths and weaknesses.
During the process, Robinson consult

ed with the Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Advisory Committee on Curricu
lum, which, according to Robinson, was
mainly concerned with the impact I-Hum
has on departmental programs. Because
I-Hum can lure faculty away from teach
ing more advanced classes that lead to
ward departmental majors, programs of
study for advanced students can suffer.
Finally, the I-Hum Governance Board

signed oft on the report, which was then
presented to the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy. That com
mittee accepted the report, and from
there it was presented to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"I was pleased, and I guess you never
know with the Faculty Senate," Robinson
said. "Even though our names are on the
cover of the report, we tried to make it as

impartial as possible."
Cheri Ross, associate director of I-
Hum, added that Robinson had been
careful in compiling student, teaching fel
low, and faculty comments that the I HUM
Review Advisory Committee had com
mended him.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Concerns about the study
The study followed the regula
tions set up by the Faculty Senate,
and Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman
noted that curricular require
ments such as I-Hum do not nor
mally undergo outside reviews.
However, some objected that the
report should be entirely indepen
dent because the program com
prises such a large and important
part of the undergraduate experi
ence at Stanford.
When departments and schools
are reviewed, outside experts are
brought in to conduct the assess
ment. Arguing that I-Hum is at
least as large a component of the
University as some departments,
the Freedom Forum — a Stanford
organization dedicated to the re
form of I-Hum — called on the ad
ministration to conduct an entirely
independent review last year.
On Feb. 4, 2002, Joshua Haw
ley, Class 0f2002, and Rachel Scar
lett-Trotter, currently a doctoral
student in history, published a
guest column in The Daily advo
cating for independence in the 1-
Hum review.
"A senior faculty member who
is not associated with either Area
One or the University administra
tion should head the review," they
wrote.
"The Faculty Senate, no less
than the student body, deserves a
report that is impartial, thorough
and objective. Members of the
Area One administration, with a
vested interest in I-Hum as it now
exists, are not in a position to pro
vide such impartiality."
Days later, The Daily published
an editorial echoing the senti
ments of Hawley and Scarlett-
Trotter's column. The editorial
noted that Bravman is the admin
istrator under whom the report
would be conducted. In a Jan. 31,
2002 article — as the study was

just beginning — Bravman told
The Daily that I-Hum was an un
qualified success.
"I'm sure this will guarantee
howls of laughter in some quar
ters, but it is absolutely a success,"
he said. "That's a statistical fact,
knowing that there are some real
critics."
Today, Bravman said he re
mains pleased with I-Hum.
"I'm fairly happy with the pro
gram," he said. "I've talked to a lot
of students, I try to listen to con
cerns and critiques and criticisms,
to separate out legitimate and ille
gitimate concerns.
"Given that this is a required
course ... I don't know that we
could do this much better," he con
tinued.
Responding to concerns that
the review would not be impartial,
Robinson said, "The reason the re
port was conducted this way is that
it simply wasn't supposed to be run
by an outside group. It was man
dated by the Faculty Senate to be a
self-study."
Discrepancies in student
concerns
In the 24 pages of the executive
summary and main report, only
six lines of text are dedicated to
student complaints. The longer of
the two entries — one dealing with
the program's hope to change stu
dent culture — is just three sen
tences long.
"We would like to change the
student culture that views I-Hum
as bad precisely because it is re
quired," reads the report. "The
new structure, which reduces the
burn-out associated with a three
quarter sequence, has helped in
this regard, as have our efforts in
satisfying student choice. As the
program has grown and years
have passed, we have seen some
improvement in this area, but not
enough."
Other portions of the 24-page
core deal indirectly with student
concerns, such as diversity of
course offerings. However, in con
trast to the three sentences devot

ed to student concerns in one sec
tion of the main report and the two
sentences in the executive summa
ry, 18 sentences are devoted to
budget concerns.
Additionally, during fall quar
ter Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
freshmen and transfer students,
conducted a survey on the fresh
man experience at Stanford. The
November 2002 draft of the sur
vey noted that "With the exception
ofl-Hum, there is little actual dis
satisfaction with the freshman
year."
Because of the generally posi
tive responses about freshman
year, the data were grouped into
two categories — responses of a 6
or 7 on a seven-point scale were
considered "very satisfied" while
responses of 1, 2 or 3 were consid
ered "dissatisfied."
The survey indicated that stu
dents are more likely to be dissatis
fied with I-Hum than very satisfied
with the program. Twenty-five
percent were characterized as
"very satisfied" while 32 percent
were "dissatisfied."
However, in subsequent edi
tions of the survey, all questions re
lated to I-Hum were removed and
folded into the I-Hum self-study.
In the I-Hum self-study, the valid
ity of the freshman survey results
were c hallenged because of vague
ness of the term "satisfaction."
"We also find the adjective 'sat
isfied' a little ambiguous for our
purposes; a student's level of satis
faction with I-Hum may have at
least as much to do with the grade
received as with the quality of the
course" reads the I-Hum program
self-study.
In self-study, the results of the
freshman survey were regrouped
into three categories — 5, 0 and 7
being "satisfied," 4 being "neutral"
and 1, 2 and 3 being "dissatisfied."
By their results, 48 percent of
freshmen were satisfied with I-
Hum overall while 31 percent
were dissatisfied. The overall chart
included in the I-Hum self-study
did not agree with the break-down
graph, where the total was 102

percent, with an additional 1 per
cent as satisfied and an additional 1
percent dissatisfied.
Bravman explained the reason
ing behind moving the results.
"What I told Julie was that 1
believe questions on 1-1 him were
the only academic questions in
the survey, so I believe they were
out of place," Bravman said.
"The fact that (hey were not de
signed by a specialist in acade
mics troubled me."
While there were no other
questions about specific academic
programs on the freshman survey,
there were general questions
about academic rigor and intellec
tual growth.
Student complaints
Although course evaluations for
the program have improved since
I-Hum was introduced — placing
the average overall course evalua
tion at 3.8/5.0 according to the
Registrar's Office — student feed
back in focus groups was not as
positive.
One complaint students had
was that sections were forced to be
artificially long — greatly exceed
ing the length of time students
could discuss the assigned works.
"Last quarter, my section was
too long," agreed Robert Buch, a
first-year teaching fellow. " The
problem was the difference be
tween committed and invested stu
dents and those who suffered
through it.
"A pedagogue who observed my
classes told me to do group activi
ties," he continued. "I've aban
doned class activity because it's just
painful. Now about half of class is
discussion, the rest of the time, I
talk."
Blain Neufeld, also a first-year
fellow, said that he thinks that the
length of section can be handled
best by incorporating a break into
the section structure from day one.
"The meetings don't last too
long," he said. "Usually enough
people — about two-thirds of the
c lass — have done the readings to
carry on a discussion."

In another one of the focus
groups used by the program to
gather student input, eight out of
10 students said they thought that
paper and exam grading was en
tirely arbitrary, and students gen
erally agreed that little or none of
what they learned in fall quarter
carried over into the
winter / spring sequence.
Neufeld said he was also some
what concerned with the articula
tion of the purpose of fall-quarter
I-Hum classes.
"The fall courses are intended
to expose students to different dis
ciplines in the humanities," he
said. " That goal is accomplished
unevenly from course to course.
"The fall courses generally
aren't as well thought-out as the
winter / spring courses," he con
tinued.
And in a third focus group,
when the question "Do you feel the
sections relate well to the lec
tures?" was posed, students re
sponded even more distressingly.
"Few of the students in the
group felt comlortable answering
this question because they had
stopped attending or rarely at
tended lecture," said the focus
group reporter. "Of those who did
attend lecture, they found that it
became a substitute for doing the
course readings — they would use
comments from lecture in section
discussions. Few of the TFs for the
group made a point of addressing
points from the lecture in section."
Only two students of the 10 in
that focus group reported 100 per
cent attendance of lectures — and
one of the two of them commented
that he regularly slept through the
lecture.
Ross noted that one of the pro
gram's components that tradition
ally hurts it is the large lecture for
mat.
"I-Hum is the only freshman
program that has the large lecture
component," she said. "It is one of
the least popular ways of
teaching — but not one of the least
effective ways."
She also attributed student (lis

satisfaction to underlying culture
at Stanford.
"It's kind of an intractable prob
lem," she said. "It's been charac
teristic of Western Culture, CIV
and then I-Hum. I'm not sure if
you could ever get over that stu
dent culture or change it."
Goals for the future
More encouraging is the report
from one focus group that stu
dents found that "the texts are the
strength of the program," and
many students said that they en
joyed their section. Section evalua
tions generally ranged in the mid
four range out of five.
Additionally, a study of student
writing conducted by experts from
the Writing Center found that stu
dents' written work in I-llum im
proved as the year went on.
However, student culture re
mains a problem for the program.
Buch, who is joining the Ger
man Department at the University
of Chicago next year, noted that
Chicago's tradition of a core cur
riculum with strong student sup
port stands in contrast to the cul
ture at Stanford, where one of his
students sports an anti-I-Hum pin
during section.
"The question is, and the ques
tion l-Hum tries to take on, is how
to spark interest in the humani
ties," he said. "I don't know how to
save the humanities."
The report outlined no line
item changes, but rather preferred
to speak in more philosophical
terms about long-term change.
"There are no particular goals
for change right now, we're oper
ating under a 10-year mandate,"
Bravman said.
I lowever, Robinson said that he
did hope to increase course diver
sity and to encourage more non
humanist faculty to participate in
the program in order to increase
its popularity.
"At base, we really have to get
good classes and terrific teachers,"
he said. "Within that context, the
courses w ill become more popular
every year."

MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Concerns about the study
The study followed the regula
tions set up by the Faculty Senate,
and Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman
noted that curricular require
ments such as I-Hum do not nor
mally undergo outside reviews.
However, some objected that the
report should be entirely indepen
dent because the program com
prises such a large and important
part of the undergraduate experi
ence at Stanford.
When departments and schools
are reviewed, outside experts are
brought in to conduct the assess
ment. Arguing that I-Hum is at
least as large a component of the
University as some departments,
the Freedom Forum — a Stanford
organization dedicated to the re
form of I-Hum — called on the ad
ministration to conduct an entirely
independent review last year.
On Feb. 4, 2002, Joshua Haw
ley, Class 0f2002, and Rachel Scar
lett-Trotter, currently a doctoral
student in history, published a
guest column in The Daily advo
cating for independence in the 1-
Hum review.
"A senior faculty member who
is not associated with either Area
One or the University administra
tion should head the review," they
wrote.
"The Faculty Senate, no less
than the student body, deserves a
report that is impartial, thorough
and objective. Members of the
Area One administration, with a
vested interest in I-Hum as it now
exists, are not in a position to pro
vide such impartiality."
Days later, The Daily published
an editorial echoing the senti
ments of Hawley and Scarlett-
Trotter's column. The editorial
noted that Bravman is the admin
istrator under whom the report
would be conducted. In a Jan. 31,
2002 article — as the study was

just beginning — Bravman told
The Daily that I-Hum was an un
qualified success.
"I'm sure this will guarantee
howls of laughter in some quar
ters, but it is absolutely a success,"
he said. "That's a statistical fact,
knowing that there are some real
critics."
Today, Bravman said he re
mains pleased with I-Hum.
"I'm fairly happy with the pro
gram," he said. "I've talked to a lot
of students, I try to listen to con
cerns and critiques and criticisms,
to separate out legitimate and ille
gitimate concerns.
"Given that this is a required
course ... I don't know that we
could do this much better," he con
tinued.
Responding to concerns that
the review would not be impartial,
Robinson said, "The reason the re
port was conducted this way is that
it simply wasn't supposed to be run
by an outside group. It was man
dated by the Faculty Senate to be a
self-study."
Discrepancies in student
concerns
In the 24 pages of the executive
summary and main report, only
six lines of text are dedicated to
student complaints. The longer of
the two entries — one dealing with
the program's hope to change stu
dent culture — is just three sen
tences long.
"We would like to change the
student culture that views I-Hum
as bad precisely because it is re
quired," reads the report. "The
new structure, which reduces the
burn-out associated with a three
quarter sequence, has helped in
this regard, as have our efforts in
satisfying student choice. As the
program has grown and years
have passed, we have seen some
improvement in this area, but not
enough."
Other portions of the 24-page
core deal indirectly with student
concerns, such as diversity of
course offerings. However, in con
trast to the three sentences devot

ed to student concerns in one sec
tion of the main report and the two
sentences in the executive summa
ry, 18 sentences are devoted to
budget concerns.
Additionally, during fall quar
ter Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
freshmen and transfer students,
conducted a survey on the fresh
man experience at Stanford. The
November 2002 draft of the sur
vey noted that "With the exception
ofl-Hum, there is little actual dis
satisfaction with the freshman
year."
Because of the generally posi
tive responses about freshman
year, the data were grouped into
two categories — responses of a 6
or 7 on a seven-point scale were
considered "very satisfied" while
responses of 1, 2 or 3 were consid
ered "dissatisfied."
The survey indicated that stu
dents are more likely to be dissatis
fied with I-Hum than very satisfied
with the program. Twenty-five
percent were characterized as
"very satisfied" while 32 percent
were "dissatisfied."
However, in subsequent edi
tions of the survey, all questions re
lated to I-Hum were removed and
folded into the I-Hum self-study.
In the I-Hum self-study, the valid
ity of the freshman survey results
were c hallenged because of vague
ness of the term "satisfaction."
"We also find the adjective 'sat
isfied' a little ambiguous for our
purposes; a student's level of satis
faction with I-Hum may have at
least as much to do with the grade
received as with the quality of the
course" reads the I-Hum program
self-study.
In self-study, the results of the
freshman survey were regrouped
into three categories — 5, 0 and 7
being "satisfied," 4 being "neutral"
and 1, 2 and 3 being "dissatisfied."
By their results, 48 percent of
freshmen were satisfied with I-
Hum overall while 31 percent
were dissatisfied. The overall chart
included in the I-Hum self-study
did not agree with the break-down
graph, where the total was 102

percent, with an additional 1 per
cent as satisfied and an additional 1
percent dissatisfied.
Bravman explained the reason
ing behind moving the results.
"What I told Julie was that 1
believe questions on 1-1 him were
the only academic questions in
the survey, so I believe they were
out of place," Bravman said.
"The fact that (hey were not de
signed by a specialist in acade
mics troubled me."
While there were no other
questions about specific academic
programs on the freshman survey,
there were general questions
about academic rigor and intellec
tual growth.
Student complaints
Although course evaluations for
the program have improved since
I-Hum was introduced — placing
the average overall course evalua
tion at 3.8/5.0 according to the
Registrar's Office — student feed
back in focus groups was not as
positive.
One complaint students had
was that sections were forced to be
artificially long — greatly exceed
ing the length of time students
could discuss the assigned works.
"Last quarter, my section was
too long," agreed Robert Buch, a
first-year teaching fellow. " The
problem was the difference be
tween committed and invested stu
dents and those who suffered
through it.
"A pedagogue who observed my
classes told me to do group activi
ties," he continued. "I've aban
doned class activity because it's just
painful. Now about half of class is
discussion, the rest of the time, I
talk."
Blain Neufeld, also a first-year
fellow, said that he thinks that the
length of section can be handled
best by incorporating a break into
the section structure from day one.
"The meetings don't last too
long," he said. "Usually enough
people — about two-thirds of the
c lass — have done the readings to
carry on a discussion."

In another one of the focus
groups used by the program to
gather student input, eight out of
10 students said they thought that
paper and exam grading was en
tirely arbitrary, and students gen
erally agreed that little or none of
what they learned in fall quarter
carried over into the
winter / spring sequence.
Neufeld said he was also some
what concerned with the articula
tion of the purpose of fall-quarter
I-Hum classes.
"The fall courses are intended
to expose students to different dis
ciplines in the humanities," he
said. " That goal is accomplished
unevenly from course to course.
"The fall courses generally
aren't as well thought-out as the
winter / spring courses," he con
tinued.
And in a third focus group,
when the question "Do you feel the
sections relate well to the lec
tures?" was posed, students re
sponded even more distressingly.
"Few of the students in the
group felt comlortable answering
this question because they had
stopped attending or rarely at
tended lecture," said the focus
group reporter. "Of those who did
attend lecture, they found that it
became a substitute for doing the
course readings — they would use
comments from lecture in section
discussions. Few of the TFs for the
group made a point of addressing
points from the lecture in section."
Only two students of the 10 in
that focus group reported 100 per
cent attendance of lectures — and
one of the two of them commented
that he regularly slept through the
lecture.
Ross noted that one of the pro
gram's components that tradition
ally hurts it is the large lecture for
mat.
"I-Hum is the only freshman
program that has the large lecture
component," she said. "It is one of
the least popular ways of
teaching — but not one of the least
effective ways."
She also attributed student (lis

satisfaction to underlying culture
at Stanford.
"It's kind of an intractable prob
lem," she said. "It's been charac
teristic of Western Culture, CIV
and then I-Hum. I'm not sure if
you could ever get over that stu
dent culture or change it."
Goals for the future
More encouraging is the report
from one focus group that stu
dents found that "the texts are the
strength of the program," and
many students said that they en
joyed their section. Section evalua
tions generally ranged in the mid
four range out of five.
Additionally, a study of student
writing conducted by experts from
the Writing Center found that stu
dents' written work in I-llum im
proved as the year went on.
However, student culture re
mains a problem for the program.
Buch, who is joining the Ger
man Department at the University
of Chicago next year, noted that
Chicago's tradition of a core cur
riculum with strong student sup
port stands in contrast to the cul
ture at Stanford, where one of his
students sports an anti-I-Hum pin
during section.
"The question is, and the ques
tion l-Hum tries to take on, is how
to spark interest in the humani
ties," he said. "I don't know how to
save the humanities."
The report outlined no line
item changes, but rather preferred
to speak in more philosophical
terms about long-term change.
"There are no particular goals
for change right now, we're oper
ating under a 10-year mandate,"
Bravman said.
I lowever, Robinson said that he
did hope to increase course diver
sity and to encourage more non
humanist faculty to participate in
the program in order to increase
its popularity.
"At base, we really have to get
good classes and terrific teachers,"
he said. "Within that context, the
courses w ill become more popular
every year."
On April 17, Prof. On in Robin
son, the director of the Intro
duction to the Humanities
program, presented a 1,234-
page self-study to the Faculty Senate.
Begun in fall quarter of 2001, the report
looks at all aspects of the program, from
student culture to faculty diversity.
The report, which is available at ihum
study.stanford.edu, was accepted by the
Senate with no objection. Faculty praised
the self-study and the effort of the com
mittee that conducted the study.
At the meeting, Drama Prof. Marry
Elam, a former director of the program,
said, "The level of work that the committee
puts into it is incredible."
However, the predominantly positive
tone of the short executive summary and
core report does not reflect the fact that
many of the student comments about the
program were negative. The fact that the
report was conducted by the program ad
ministrators has also caused some to ques
tion its validity.
Methodology of the self-study
The Faculty Senate legislation that es
tablished I-Hum calls fora self-study at the
five-year mark in its life.
In consultation with Ann Porteus, a lec
turer at the School of Education and a spe
cialist in assessment, the program set up
focus groups with students and wrote stu
dent surveys to gather input. Porteus'
graduate students were fielded to lead the
focus groups.

The data was compiled largely by
Robinson, who placed himself under the
supervision of the I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee — an ad-hoc group he ap
pointed to supervise his conduct during
the study. In compiling the data, the Advi
sory Committee acted as a referee to en
sure that Robinson was fair in reporting I-
Hum's strengths and weaknesses.
During the process, Robinson consult

ed with the Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Advisory Committee on Curricu
lum, which, according to Robinson, was
mainly concerned with the impact I-Hum
has on departmental programs. Because
I-Hum can lure faculty away from teach
ing more advanced classes that lead to
ward departmental majors, programs of
study for advanced students can suffer.
Finally, the I-Hum Governance Board

signed oft on the report, which was then
presented to the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy. That com
mittee accepted the report, and from
there it was presented to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"I was pleased, and I guess you never

said. "Even though our names are on the

The Daily that I-Hum was an un
qualified success.
"I'm sure this will guarantee
howls of laughter in some quar
ters, but it is absolutely a success,"
he said. "That's a statistical fact,
knowing that there are some real
critics."
Today, Bravman said he re
mains pleased with I-Hum.
"I'm fairly happy with the pro
gram," he said. "I've talked to a lot
of students, I try to listen to con
cerns and critiques and criticisms,
to separate out legitimate and ille
gitimate concerns.
"Given that this is a required
course ... I don't know that we
could do this much better," he con
tinued.
Responding to concerns that
the review would not be impartial,
Robinson said, "The reason the re
port was conducted this way is that
it simply wasn't supposed to be run
by an outside group. It was man
dated by the Faculty Senate to be a
self-study."
Discrepancies in student
concerns
In the 24 pages of the executive
summary and main report, only
six lines of text are dedicated to
student complaints. The longer of
the two entries — one dealing with
the program's hope to change stu
dent culture — is just three sen
tences long.
"We would like to change the
student culture that views I-Hum
as bad precisely because it is re
quired," reads the report. "The
new structure, which reduces the
burn-out associated with a three
quarter sequence, has helped in
this regard, as have our efforts in
satisfying student choice. As the
program has grown and years
have passed, we have seen some
improvement in this area, but not
enough."
Other portions of the 24-page
core deal indirectly with student
concerns, such as diversity of
course offerings. However, in con
trast to the three sentences devot

ed to student concerns in one sec
tion of the main report and the two
sentences in the executive summa
ry, 18 sentences are devoted to
budget concerns.
Additionally, during fall quar
ter Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
freshmen and transfer students,
conducted a survey on the fresh
man experience at Stanford. The
November 2002 draft of the sur
vey noted that "With the exception
ofl-Hum, there is little actual dis
satisfaction with the freshman
year."
Because of the generally posi
tive responses about freshman
year, the data were grouped into
two categories — responses of a 6
or 7 on a seven-point scale were
considered "very satisfied" while
responses of 1, 2 or 3 were consid
ered "dissatisfied."
The survey indicated that stu
dents are more likely to be dissatis
fied with I-Hum than very satisfied
with the program. Twenty-five
percent were characterized as
"very satisfied" while 32 percent
were "dissatisfied."
However, in subsequent edi
tions of the survey, all questions re
lated to I-Hum were removed and
folded into the I-Hum self-study.
In the I-Hum self-study, the valid
ity of the freshman survey results
were c hallenged because of vague
ness of the term "satisfaction."
"We also find the adjective 'sat
isfied' a little ambiguous for our
purposes; a student's level of satis
faction with I-Hum may have at
least as much to do with the grade
received as with the quality of the
course" reads the I-Hum program
self-study.
In self-study, the results of the
freshman survey were regrouped
into three categories — 5, 0 and 7
being "satisfied," 4 being "neutral"
and 1, 2 and 3 being "dissatisfied."
By their results, 48 percent of
freshmen were satisfied with I-
Hum overall while 31 percent
were dissatisfied. The overall chart
included in the I-Hum self-study
did not agree with the break-down
graph, where the total was 102

percent, with an additional 1 per
cent as satisfied and an additional 1
percent dissatisfied.
Bravman explained the reason
ing behind moving the results.
"What I told Julie was that 1
believe questions on 1-1 him were
the only academic questions in
the survey, so I believe they were
out of place," Bravman said.
"The fact that (hey were not de
signed by a specialist in acade
mics troubled me."
While there were no other
questions about specific academic
programs on the freshman survey,
there were general questions
about academic rigor and intellec
tual growth.
Student complaints
Although course evaluations for
the program have improved since
I-Hum was introduced — placing
the average overall course evalua
tion at 3.8/5.0 according to the
Registrar's Office — student feed
back in focus groups was not as
positive.
One complaint students had
was that sections were forced to be
artificially long — greatly exceed
ing the length of time students
could discuss the assigned works.
"Last quarter, my section was
too long," agreed Robert Buch, a
first-year teaching fellow. " The
problem was the difference be
tween committed and invested stu
dents and those who suffered
through it.
"A pedagogue who observed my
classes told me to do group activi
ties," he continued. "I've aban
doned class activity because it's just
painful. Now about half of class is
discussion, the rest of the time, I
talk."
Blain Neufeld, also a first-year
fellow, said that he thinks that the
length of section can be handled
best by incorporating a break into
the section structure from day one.
"The meetings don't last too
long," he said. "Usually enough
people — about two-thirds of the
c lass — have done the readings to
carry on a discussion."

In another one of the focus
groups used by the program to
gather student input, eight out of
10 students said they thought that
paper and exam grading was en
tirely arbitrary, and students gen
erally agreed that little or none of
what they learned in fall quarter
carried over into the
winter / spring sequence.
Neufeld said he was also some
what concerned with the articula
tion of the purpose of fall-quarter
I-Hum classes.
"The fall courses are intended
to expose students to different dis
ciplines in the humanities," he
said. " That goal is accomplished
unevenly from course to course.
"The fall courses generally
aren't as well thought-out as the
winter / spring courses," he con
tinued.
And in a third focus group,
when the question "Do you feel the
sections relate well to the lec
tures?" was posed, students re
sponded even more distressingly.
"Few of the students in the
group felt comlortable answering
this question because they had
stopped attending or rarely at
tended lecture," said the focus
group reporter. "Of those who did
attend lecture, they found that it
became a substitute for doing the
course readings — they would use
comments from lecture in section
discussions. Few of the TFs for the
group made a point of addressing
points from the lecture in section."
Only two students of the 10 in
that focus group reported 100 per
cent attendance of lectures — and
one of the two of them commented
that he regularly slept through the
lecture.
Ross noted that one of the pro
gram's components that tradition
ally hurts it is the large lecture for
mat.
"I-Hum is the only freshman
program that has the large lecture
component," she said. "It is one of
the least popular ways of
teaching — but not one of the least
effective ways."
She also attributed student (lis

satisfaction to underlying culture
at Stanford.
"It's kind of an intractable prob
lem," she said. "It's been charac
teristic of Western Culture, CIV
and then I-Hum. I'm not sure if
you could ever get over that stu
dent culture or change it."
Goals for the future
More encouraging is the report
from one focus group that stu
dents found that "the texts are the
strength of the program," and
many students said that they en
joyed their section. Section evalua
tions generally ranged in the mid
four range out of five.
Additionally, a study of student
writing conducted by experts from
the Writing Center found that stu
dents' written work in I-llum im
proved as the year went on.
However, student culture re
mains a problem for the program.
Buch, who is joining the Ger
man Department at the University
of Chicago next year, noted that
Chicago's tradition of a core cur
riculum with strong student sup
port stands in contrast to the cul
ture at Stanford, where one of his
students sports an anti-I-Hum pin
during section.
"The question is, and the ques
tion l-Hum tries to take on, is how
to spark interest in the humani
ties," he said. "I don't know how to
save the humanities."
The report outlined no line
item changes, but rather preferred
to speak in more philosophical
terms about long-term change.
"There are no particular goals
for change right now, we're oper
ating under a 10-year mandate,"
Bravman said.
I lowever, Robinson said that he
did hope to increase course diver
sity and to encourage more non
humanist faculty to participate in
the program in order to increase
its popularity.
"At base, we really have to get
good classes and terrific teachers,"
he said. "Within that context, the
courses w ill become more popular
every year."
On April 17, Prof. On in Robin
son, the director of the Intro
duction to the Humanities
program, presented a 1,234-
page self-study to the Faculty Senate.
Begun in fall quarter of 2001, the report
looks at all aspects of the program, from
student culture to faculty diversity.
The report, which is available at ihum
study.stanford.edu, was accepted by the
Senate with no objection. Faculty praised
the self-study and the effort of the com
mittee that conducted the study.
At the meeting, Drama Prof. Marry
Elam, a former director of the program,
said, "The level of work that the committee
puts into it is incredible."
However, the predominantly positive
tone of the short executive summary and
core report does not reflect the fact that
many of the student comments about the
program were negative. The fact that the
report was conducted by the program ad
ministrators has also caused some to ques
tion its validity.
Methodology of the self-study
The Faculty Senate legislation that es
tablished I-Hum calls fora self-study at the
five-year mark in its life.
In consultation with Ann Porteus, a lec
turer at the School of Education and a spe
cialist in assessment, the program set up
focus groups with students and wrote stu
dent surveys to gather input. Porteus'
graduate students were fielded to lead the
focus groups.

The data was compiled largely by
Robinson, who placed himself under the
supervision of the I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee — an ad-hoc group he ap
pointed to supervise his conduct during
the study. In compiling the data, the Advi
sory Committee acted as a referee to en
sure that Robinson was fair in reporting I-
Hum's strengths and weaknesses.
During the process, Robinson consult

ed with the Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Advisory Committee on Curricu
lum, which, according to Robinson, was
mainly concerned with the impact I-Hum
has on departmental programs. Because
I-Hum can lure faculty away from teach
ing more advanced classes that lead to
ward departmental majors, programs of
study for advanced students can suffer.
Finally, the I-Hum Governance Board

signed oft on the report, which was then
presented to the Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy. That com
mittee accepted the report, and from
there it was presented to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"I was pleased, and I guess you never
know with the Faculty Senate," Robinson
said. "Even though our names are on the
cover of the report, we tried to make it as

cial projects, each devoted to examining in

impartial as possible."
Cheri Ross, associate director of I-
Hum, added that Robinson had been
careful in compiling student, teaching fel
low, and faculty comments that the I HUM
Review Advisory Committee had com
mended him.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Concerns about the study
The study followed the regula
tions set up by the Faculty Senate,
and Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman
noted that curricular require
ments such as I-Hum do not nor
mally undergo outside reviews.
However, some objected that the
report should be entirely indepen
dent because the program com
prises such a large and important
part of the undergraduate experi
ence at Stanford.
When departments and schools
are reviewed, outside experts are
brought in to conduct the assess
ment. Arguing that I-Hum is at
least as large a component of the
University as some departments,
the Freedom Forum — a Stanford
organization dedicated to the re
form of I-Hum — called on the ad
ministration to conduct an entirely
independent review last year.
On Feb. 4, 2002, Joshua Haw
ley, Class 0f2002, and Rachel Scar
lett-Trotter, currently a doctoral
student in history, published a
guest column in The Daily advo
cating for independence in the 1-
Hum review.
"A senior faculty member who
is not associated with either Area
One or the University administra
tion should head the review," they
wrote.
"The Faculty Senate, no less
than the student body, deserves a
report that is impartial, thorough
and objective. Members of the
Area One administration, with a
vested interest in I-Hum as it now
exists, are not in a position to pro
vide such impartiality."
Days later, The Daily published
an editorial echoing the senti
ments of Hawley and Scarlett-
Trotter's column. The editorial
noted that Bravman is the admin
istrator under whom the report
would be conducted. In a Jan. 31,
2002 article — as the study was

just beginning — Bravman told
The Daily that I-Hum was an un

year, the data were grouped into
two categories — responses of a 6
or 7 on a seven-point scale were
considered "very satisfied" while
responses of 1, 2 or 3 were consid
ered "dissatisfied."
The survey indicated that stu
dents are more likely to be dissatis
fied with I-Hum than very satisfied
with the program. Twenty-five
percent were characterized as
"very satisfied" while 32 percent
were "dissatisfied."
However, in subsequent edi
tions of the survey, all questions re
lated to I-Hum were removed and
folded into the I-Hum self-study.
In the I-Hum self-study, the valid
ity of the freshman survey results
were c hallenged because of vague
ness of the term "satisfaction."
"We also find the adjective 'sat
isfied' a little ambiguous for our
purposes; a student's level of satis
faction with I-Hum may have at
least as much to do with the grade
received as with the quality of the
course" reads the I-Hum program
self-study.
In self-study, the results of the
freshman survey were regrouped
into three categories — 5, 0 and 7
being "satisfied," 4 being "neutral"
and 1, 2 and 3 being "dissatisfied."
By their results, 48 percent of
freshmen were satisfied with I-
Hum overall while 31 percent
were dissatisfied. The overall chart
included in the I-Hum self-study
did not agree with the break-down
graph, where the total was 102

percent, with an additional 1 per
cent as satisfied and an additional 1
percent dissatisfied.
Bravman explained the reason
ing behind moving the results.
"What I told Julie was that 1
believe questions on 1-1 him were
the only academic questions in
the survey, so I believe they were
out of place," Bravman said.
"The fact that (hey were not de
signed by a specialist in acade
mics troubled me."
While there were no other
questions about specific academic
programs on the freshman survey,
there were general questions
about academic rigor and intellec
tual growth.
Student complaints
Although course evaluations for
the program have improved since
I-Hum was introduced — placing
the average overall course evalua
tion at 3.8/5.0 according to the
Registrar's Office — student feed
back in focus groups was not as
positive.
One complaint students had
was that sections were forced to be
artificially long — greatly exceed
ing the length of time students
could discuss the assigned works.
"Last quarter, my section was
too long," agreed Robert Buch, a
first-year teaching fellow. " The
problem was the difference be
tween committed and invested stu
dents and those who suffered
through it.
"A pedagogue who observed my
classes told me to do group activi
ties," he continued. "I've aban
doned class activity because it's just
painful. Now about half of class is
discussion, the rest of the time, I
talk."
Blain Neufeld, also a first-year
fellow, said that he thinks that the
length of section can be handled
best by incorporating a break into
the section structure from day one.
"The meetings don't last too
long," he said. "Usually enough
people — about two-thirds of the
c lass — have done the readings to
carry on a discussion."

In another one of the focus
groups used by the program to
gather student input, eight out of
10 students said they thought that
paper and exam grading was en
tirely arbitrary, and students gen
erally agreed that little or none of
what they learned in fall quarter
carried over into the
winter / spring sequence.
Neufeld said he was also some
what concerned with the articula
tion of the purpose of fall-quarter
I-Hum classes.
"The fall courses are intended
to expose students to different dis
ciplines in the humanities," he
said. " That goal is accomplished
unevenly from course to course.
"The fall courses generally
aren't as well thought-out as the
winter / spring courses," he con
tinued.
And in a third focus group,
when the question "Do you feel the
sections relate well to the lec
tures?" was posed, students re
sponded even more distressingly.
"Few of the students in the
group felt comlortable answering
this question because they had
stopped attending or rarely at
tended lecture," said the focus
group reporter. "Of those who did
attend lecture, they found that it
became a substitute for doing the
course readings — they would use
comments from lecture in section
discussions. Few of the TFs for the
group made a point of addressing
points from the lecture in section."
Only two students of the 10 in
that focus group reported 100 per
cent attendance of lectures — and
one of the two of them commented
that he regularly slept through the
lecture.
Ross noted that one of the pro
gram's components that tradition
ally hurts it is the large lecture for
mat.
"I-Hum is the only freshman
program that has the large lecture
component," she said. "It is one of
the least popular ways of
teaching — but not one of the least
effective ways."
She also attributed student (lis

satisfaction to underlying culture
at Stanford.
"It's kind of an intractable prob
lem," she said. "It's been charac
teristic of Western Culture, CIV
and then I-Hum. I'm not sure if
you could ever get over that stu
dent culture or change it."
Goals for the future
More encouraging is the report
from one focus group that stu
dents found that "the texts are the
strength of the program," and
many students said that they en
joyed their section. Section evalua
tions generally ranged in the mid
four range out of five.
Additionally, a study of student
writing conducted by experts from
the Writing Center found that stu
dents' written work in I-llum im
proved as the year went on.
However, student culture re
mains a problem for the program.
Buch, who is joining the Ger
man Department at the University
of Chicago next year, noted that
Chicago's tradition of a core cur
riculum with strong student sup
port stands in contrast to the cul
ture at Stanford, where one of his
students sports an anti-I-Hum pin
during section.
"The question is, and the ques
tion l-Hum tries to take on, is how
to spark interest in the humani
ties," he said. "I don't know how to
save the humanities."
The report outlined no line
item changes, but rather preferred
to speak in more philosophical
terms about long-term change.
"There are no particular goals
for change right now, we're oper
ating under a 10-year mandate,"
Bravman said.
I lowever, Robinson said that he
did hope to increase course diver
sity and to encourage more non
humanist faculty to participate in
the program in order to increase
its popularity.
"At base, we really have to get
good classes and terrific teachers,"
he said. "Within that context, the
courses w ill become more popular
every year."
