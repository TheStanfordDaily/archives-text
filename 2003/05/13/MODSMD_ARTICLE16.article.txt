# Freshman advising receives poor marks in survey
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
According to "The Freshman Year at
Stanford" survey conducted last fall,
students from the Class of 2005 were
highly dissatisfied with advising on the
Farm — both the Academic Advisors
and the Peer Academic Advisors pro
grams.
Out of the nine different questions
specifically asking about academic ex
periences, students expressed the
greatest disapproval regarding fresh
man academic advising — 39 percent
ranked themselves as "dissatisfied," rat
ing advising as a 1, 2 or 3 on a seven
point scale, while only 31 percent were
"very satisfied" and rated it a 6 or 7.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation John Bravman warned that the
freshman survey was trying to deter
mine the nature of a "complex situa
tion" from only a few questions.
"[Other] surveys suggest that advis
ing is not as seen negatively as this fresh
man survey suggests, which is no denial
that real issues exist," he said. "My im
pression is that it is quite variable across
student experiences."
Varied experiences with the faculty
advising program
The mean score of student respons
es to the faculty advising program was
4.15 — the lowest of any academic
question listed on the survey. Individ
ual responses regarding academic ad
vising varied widely.
Rachel Cook, a sophomore, de
scribed her academic advisor — also
known as an AA — as "incredible."
"She has gotten to be one of my real
ly close friends in the past couple years,"
Cook said. "She isn't my adviser any
more but I meet her every week or so
anyway. She was really good at pointing
toward resources and people who could
answer my specific questions."
Sophomore Jack Chung said his AA
was helpful, but noted that his academ
ic interests did not match up with those
of his adviser.
"It seems that a lot of the advisers are
from random areas — mine was from
an Asian think-tank and I know a friend
of mine whose faculty member was a li
brarian," he said.
Other students commented that dis
similar interests between advisers and

advisees played a part in undermining
the potential effectiveness of the AA
program.
Gina Hsieh, a sophomore majoring
in management science and engineer
ing, said she would be have benefited
from having a freshman adviser specifi
cally focused on engineering.
"1 was really behind during fresh
man year and took fewer classes than 1
should, which put me at a disadvan
tage," she said. "I felt like my adviser
gave me more general advice, rather
than specific."
Bravman emphasized that many ad
vising questions can be answered
through resources available at the Un
dergraduate Advising Center or on
many of Stanford's Web sites.
"I am more concerned with develop
ing mentoring relationships beyond
giving advice," he said.
However, other students also ex
pressed doubt that the advising system
could adequately assist students with
out some form of major structural revi

sion.
"It seemed like most of the people
that had 'good' advisers got a dinner
out every month or so, whereas people
with 'bad' advisers didn't, but that was
the extent of the difference," said
sophomore Bobby Williams. "I haven't
heard of anyone getting really good ad
vice or helpful information from their
advisers. Granted, I don't know per
fectly what the intention of the program
is — if it is just to help freshmen make a
faculty friend, then maybe they
achieved that. But if it is to develop a
substantive or meaningful support net
work, I'd say not."
However, administrators noted that
students have a responsibility to con
tribute to their advising as well.
" There's a recognition that we need
to set up the expectations significantly
right from the start, and students need
to know what's expected of them to be a
good advisee," said Chip Goldstein, in
terim director of the UAC. "Some of the
information that's going to be in Ap

proaching Stanford [the summer orien
tation materials] this year will be set up
differently from the past."
According to Bravman, the Universi
ty is currently searching fora UAC fac
ulty advising director in an effort to ap
prove advising. Upon implementation
of the new position, future oversight of
the AA program would be in the hands
of faculty, operating in a manner simi
lar to Introduction to the Humanities
and the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric.
"It's been a slow search that's been
going on over the course of the year,"
Goldstein said. "It has to be somebody
who knows advising here, who's inter
ested in working with advising . . . One
of the charges to that person will be to
look at the whole advising structure and
see how we can improve, [which is]
specifically related to how faculty can be
involved in that."
