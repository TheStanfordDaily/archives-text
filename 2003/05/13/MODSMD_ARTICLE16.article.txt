# Freshman advising receives poor marks in survey
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
According to "The Freshman Year at
Stanford" survey conducted last fall,
students from the Class of 2005 were
highly dissatisfied with advising on the
Farm — both the Academic Advisors
and the Peer Academic Advisors pro
grams.
Out of the nine different questions
specifically asking about academic ex
periences, students expressed the
greatest disapproval regarding fresh
man academic advising — 39 percent
ranked themselves as "dissatisfied," rat
ing advising as a 1, 2 or 3 on a seven
point scale, while only 31 percent were
"very satisfied" and rated it a 6 or 7.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation John Bravman warned that the
freshman survey was trying to deter
mine the nature of a "complex situa
tion" from only a few questions.
"[Other] surveys suggest that advis
ing is not as seen negatively as this fresh
man survey suggests, which is no denial
that real issues exist," he said. "My im
pression is that it is quite variable across
student experiences."
Varied experiences with the faculty
advising program
The mean score of student respons
es to the faculty advising program was
4.15 — the lowest of any academic
question listed on the survey. Individ
ual responses regarding academic ad
vising varied widely.
Rachel Cook, a sophomore, de
scribed her academic advisor — also
known as an AA — as "incredible."
"She has gotten to be one of my real
ly close friends in the past couple years,"
Cook said. "She isn't my adviser any
more but I meet her every week or so
anyway. She was really good at pointing
toward resources and people who could
answer my specific questions."
Sophomore Jack Chung said his AA
was helpful, but noted that his academ
ic interests did not match up with those
of his adviser.
"It seems that a lot of the advisers are
from random areas — mine was from
an Asian think-tank and I know a friend
of mine whose faculty member was a li
brarian," he said.
Other students commented that dis
similar interests between advisers and

advisees played a part in undermining
the potential effectiveness of the AA
program.
Gina Hsieh, a sophomore majoring
in management science and engineer
ing, said she would be have benefited
from having a freshman adviser specifi
cally focused on engineering.
"1 was really behind during fresh
man year and took fewer classes than 1
should, which put me at a disadvan
tage," she said. "I felt like my adviser
gave me more general advice, rather
than specific."
Bravman emphasized that many ad
vising questions can be answered
through resources available at the Un
dergraduate Advising Center or on
many of Stanford's Web sites.
"I am more concerned with develop
ing mentoring relationships beyond
giving advice," he said.
However, other students also ex
pressed doubt that the advising system
could adequately assist students with
out some form of major structural revi

sion.
"It seemed like most of the people
that had 'good' advisers got a dinner
out every month or so, whereas people
with 'bad' advisers didn't, but that was
the extent of the difference," said
sophomore Bobby Williams. "I haven't
heard of anyone getting really good ad
vice or helpful information from their
advisers. Granted, I don't know per
fectly what the intention of the program
is — if it is just to help freshmen make a
faculty friend, then maybe they
achieved that. But if it is to develop a
substantive or meaningful support net
work, I'd say not."
However, administrators noted that
students have a responsibility to con
tribute to their advising as well.
" There's a recognition that we need
to set up the expectations significantly
right from the start, and students need
to know what's expected of them to be a
good advisee," said Chip Goldstein, in
terim director of the UAC. "Some of the
information that's going to be in Ap

proaching Stanford [the summer orien
tation materials] this year will be set up
differently from the past."
According to Bravman, the Universi
ty is currently searching fora UAC fac
ulty advising director in an effort to ap
prove advising. Upon implementation
of the new position, future oversight of
the AA program would be in the hands
of faculty, operating in a manner simi
lar to Introduction to the Humanities
and the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric.
"It's been a slow search that's been
going on over the course of the year,"
Goldstein said. "It has to be somebody
who knows advising here, who's inter
ested in working with advising . . . One
of the charges to that person will be to
look at the whole advising structure and
see how we can improve, [which is]
specifically related to how faculty can be
involved in that."

the Class of 2005 reported being the least satisfied.
Doubts about the peer advising
program
Another area in which students
ranked the University poorly was
the PAA program — 36 percent
were "dissatisfied" while only 35
percent were "very satisfied."
Similar to freshman academic
advisers, many students said that
their PAAs had little or no experi
ence in the academic fields they
were interested in, which limited
the usefulness of the program.
"If you are thinking about a
specific major, they should refer
you to someone who is already de
clared," Hsieh said. "Then they
could tell you which classes are
good or what classes not to take to
gether. My neighbors in my
upper-class dorm this year have
offered me better advice than my
PAA ever did."
Senior Lynn Yee, PAA program
coordinator, said that although ef
forts are made to match PAAs with
students who have similar academ
ic focuses, such interests cannot al
ways be perfectly accommodated.
"There is not enough diversity
in PAAs to match an English PAA
with English freshmen all in that
same dorm," she said. "In most
cases, we don't match anyone up
who will be grossly unable to ad
vise their freshmen. It is a hand
matching process; there is a lot of
consideration there."
Goldstein explained that, while
predominantlyjuniors and seniors
held the position in the past,
sophomores now make up the ma
jority of PAAs.
"There are questions about
whether a student who's only been

here one year can be a good advis
er," he said.
"We would welcome more ju
niors applying for PAA positions,"
Goldstein added. "And perhaps we
in the UAC need to do a better job
at making it known that PAA posi
tions are not just for sopho
mores .. . Juniors would bring an
additional year's worth of experi
ence with campus life and a fuller
understanding of academic pro

grams."
Yee confirmed that the PAA
program, in addition to holding an
extra series of winter training ses
sions introduced this year, will try
to attract more upperclassmen
next year.
"Surveys show that upperclass
men PAAs know more about cam
pus and are more involved with
their frosh," she said. "But again,
vear to year, there are a lot of PAAs

who are very strong and then
there are some who drop off . And
it is hard to do something about
that when there are 300 of them."
She also explained that since
being a PAA is a volunteer position,
it is difficult to bring about dramat
ic change in PAA responsiveness.
"You can tell them you would
like them to do a better job, but
there is only so much you can do,"
she said.

Goldstein underscored that the
student also should take on an ac
tive role in any advising relation
ship.
"Advising is a two way street, if
students aren't responsive we can't
force them," he said. "We often
find that some of the students that
complain down the road were the
ones who didn't really take advan
tage of the opportunities that were
offered to them."

A peer academic adviser meets at the Undergraduate Advising Center. The peer academic advising program specifically and freshman advising in gener
al were among the least highly ranked aspects of the freshman experience in a recent survey. Freshmen said they were frustrated by advisers who did not
have enough knowledge about their potential majors and classes.
According to "The Freshman Year at
Stanford" survey conducted last fall,
students from the Class of 2005 were
highly dissatisfied with advising on the
Farm — both the Academic Advisors
and the Peer Academic Advisors pro
grams.
Out of the nine different questions
specifically asking about academic ex
periences, students expressed the
greatest disapproval regarding fresh
man academic advising — 39 percent
ranked themselves as "dissatisfied," rat
ing advising as a 1, 2 or 3 on a seven
point scale, while only 31 percent were
"very satisfied" and rated it a 6 or 7.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation John Bravman warned that the
freshman survey was trying to deter
mine the nature of a "complex situa
tion" from only a few questions.
"[Other] surveys suggest that advis
ing is not as seen negatively as this fresh
man survey suggests, which is no denial
that real issues exist," he said. "My im
pression is that it is quite variable across
student experiences."
Varied experiences with the faculty
advising program
The mean score of student respons
es to the faculty advising program was
4.15 — the lowest of any academic
question listed on the survey. Individ
ual responses regarding academic ad
vising varied widely.
Rachel Cook, a sophomore, de
scribed her academic advisor — also
known as an AA — as "incredible."
"She has gotten to be one of my real
ly close friends in the past couple years,"
Cook said. "She isn't my adviser any
more but I meet her every week or so
anyway. She was really good at pointing
toward resources and people who could
answer my specific questions."
Sophomore Jack Chung said his AA
was helpful, but noted that his academ
ic interests did not match up with those
of his adviser.
"It seems that a lot of the advisers are
from random areas — mine was from
an Asian think-tank and I know a friend
of mine whose faculty member was a li
brarian," he said.
Other students commented that dis
similar interests between advisers and

advisees played a part in undermining
the potential effectiveness of the AA
program.
Gina Hsieh, a sophomore majoring
in management science and engineer
ing, said she would be have benefited
from having a freshman adviser specifi
cally focused on engineering.
"1 was really behind during fresh
man year and took fewer classes than 1
should, which put me at a disadvan
tage," she said. "I felt like my adviser
gave me more general advice, rather
than specific."
Bravman emphasized that many ad
vising questions can be answered
through resources available at the Un
dergraduate Advising Center or on
many of Stanford's Web sites.
"I am more concerned with develop
ing mentoring relationships beyond
giving advice," he said.
However, other students also ex
pressed doubt that the advising system
could adequately assist students with
out some form of major structural revi

sion.
"It seemed like most of the people
that had 'good' advisers got a dinner
out every month or so, whereas people
with 'bad' advisers didn't, but that was
the extent of the difference," said
sophomore Bobby Williams. "I haven't
heard of anyone getting really good ad
vice or helpful information from their
advisers. Granted, I don't know per
fectly what the intention of the program
is — if it is just to help freshmen make a
faculty friend, then maybe they
achieved that. But if it is to develop a
substantive or meaningful support net
work, I'd say not."
However, administrators noted that
students have a responsibility to con
tribute to their advising as well.
" There's a recognition that we need
to set up the expectations significantly
right from the start, and students need
to know what's expected of them to be a
good advisee," said Chip Goldstein, in
terim director of the UAC. "Some of the
information that's going to be in Ap

proaching Stanford [the summer orien
tation materials] this year will be set up
differently from the past."
According to Bravman, the Universi
ty is currently searching fora UAC fac
ulty advising director in an effort to ap
prove advising. Upon implementation
of the new position, future oversight of
the AA program would be in the hands
of faculty, operating in a manner simi
lar to Introduction to the Humanities
and the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric.
"It's been a slow search that's been
going on over the course of the year,"
Goldstein said. "It has to be somebody
who knows advising here, who's inter
ested in working with advising . . . One
of the charges to that person will be to
look at the whole advising structure and
see how we can improve, [which is]
specifically related to how faculty can be
involved in that."

A student consults an adviser at the Undergraduate Advising Center. Faculty and peer advising were among the programs with which
the Class of 2005 reported being the least satisfied.
Doubts about the peer advising
program
Another area in which students
ranked the University poorly was
the PAA program — 36 percent
were "dissatisfied" while only 35
percent were "very satisfied."
Similar to freshman academic
advisers, many students said that
their PAAs had little or no experi
ence in the academic fields they
were interested in, which limited
the usefulness of the program.
"If you are thinking about a
specific major, they should refer
you to someone who is already de
clared," Hsieh said. "Then they
could tell you which classes are
good or what classes not to take to
gether. My neighbors in my
upper-class dorm this year have
offered me better advice than my
PAA ever did."
Senior Lynn Yee, PAA program
coordinator, said that although ef
forts are made to match PAAs with
students who have similar academ
ic focuses, such interests cannot al
ways be perfectly accommodated.
"There is not enough diversity
in PAAs to match an English PAA
with English freshmen all in that
same dorm," she said. "In most
cases, we don't match anyone up
who will be grossly unable to ad
vise their freshmen. It is a hand
matching process; there is a lot of
consideration there."
Goldstein explained that, while
predominantlyjuniors and seniors
held the position in the past,
sophomores now make up the ma
jority of PAAs.
"There are questions about
whether a student who's only been

here one year can be a good advis
er," he said.
"We would welcome more ju
niors applying for PAA positions,"
Goldstein added. "And perhaps we
in the UAC need to do a better job

program, in addition to holding an
extra series of winter training ses

to attract more upperclassmen
