# Satisfaction differs among ethnic groups
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
The most ethnically diverse class to attend
Stanford in the history of the University will
flock to campus in September. According to
"The Freshman Year at Stanford," a survey ad
ministered by the Office of Freshman and
Transfer Students, these students' ethnicities
could have a significant impact on their satisfac
tion at Stanford, with Latino/a and Caucasian
students showing the highest level of satisfaction
and Asian Americans the lowest.
The survey, which was administered to cur
rent sophomores during fall quarter of 2002,
also reported that very few students became in
volved in community centers in their first year.
However, the majority of students who did par
ticipate said they were satisfied with their expe
riences.
El Centro Chicano Director M. Frances
Morales attributed Latino satisfaction to com
munity outreach efforts, noting that much of the
center's success comes from introducing fresh
men to ethnic resources when they first arrive
on campus.
"I know we do our best job in term of reach
ing out to the incoming students during Stan
ford Admit Weekend and then also during wel
come events in September," Morales said. "It's a
gradual process: first [freshmen] become aware,
then they attend programs, then they start vol
unteering."
latino and Caucasian students are more like
ly than their Asian-American peers to recom
mend Stanford to others or to say that they
would have chosen Stanford again if given the
opportunity.
"This survey conducted was a good first at
tempt at assessing the needs and satisfaction
level of freshmen [but] I think it is premature to
say that Asian students and alumni are not satis
fied with their Stanford experience based solely
on this particular survey," said Richard Yuen,
director of the Asian American Activities C Center.
"Some of the findings that are being posed from
the freshman survey were not meant to be con
clusive."
Although sophomore Tim Lu, co-chair of the
Stanford Asian American Activism Coalition,
also cautioned against placing too
much significance in the survey, he
acknowledged, "An often dis
cussed source of dissatisfaction is
the lack of a sense of community
among Asian Americans.
Morales concurred with Yuen's
sentiments.
"My colleagues at the A3C are
doing an excellent job, and these
numbers are not indicative of the
level of quality of programming
out of the A3C," she said. "They're
indicative of the complexity of the
Asian-American population."
The admitted Class 0f2007 is 13
percent African-American, 25 per
cent Asian-American, 11 percent
Mexican-American, 3 percent
Latino/a and 3 percent Native-
American or Native-Hawaiian.
While the community center
staff members said they want to
make sure students are aware of
the ethnic resources available, they
acknowledged that not all fresh
men will want to participate in cul
tural organizations.
"Much of a freshman's identifi
cation witli their ethnic group de
pends on their personal history,"
said junior Lauren Rhue, a coordi
nator for community services at
the Black Community Services
Center. "There is not one univer
sal black experience or Asian expe
rience or Latino experience."
Results of the freshman survey
reported that while only 9 percent
of first-year respondents live in
ethnic theme houses, these stu
dents appear to be satisfied with
their residence, well-acquainted
with a faculty member and are
more likely to feel they are a part of
the Stanford community at large.
Junior Jordan Peralta said that
he did not identify with his Filipino-
American heritage upon his arrival
at Stanford, yet through staffing at
Okada, he found that he was able to
learn more about his ethnicity.
"In my particular case, the pur
pose of ethnic theme housing, eth
nic centers, ethnic programming
and groups is to provide a resource
in which one may safely explore his
or her identity," Peralta said.
"More generally, these resources
are open to everyone who seeks to
learn more about a particular cul

ture."
Many freshmen have difficulties
in making friends when they first
arrive on campus, but ethnic
theme dorm and community cen
ter administrators said cultural
communities are instrumental in
smoothing this process.
"When I got to campus, I found
I made many Asian-American
friends just because I had so much
in common with them and we just
clicked," said freshman Florence
Lee, an administrative assistant at
the Asian American Activities Cen
ter.
Although black students split on
many of the survey's questions, re
sults indicated strong solidarity
with the Class of 2005.
Jan Barker-Alexander, director
at the BC.SC, expressed her belief
that this class affinity probably
originated with the Partners for
Academic Excellence, a freshman
program created within the black
community that caused students to
come together within their class.
According to Rhue, some fresh
men may feel pressured to fit into
specific ethnic groups when they
first arrive due to the University's
focus on diversity and minority
representation.
"Students of all ethnicities,
some trying to be sensitive, ques
tion people about their racial cate
gory and its influence on their his
tory without reflecting on the true
variety of backgrounds possible,"
Rhue said.
In order to reduce the stress
surrounding ethnic identification,
community centers and other cul
tural organizations on campus em
phasize the voluntary nature of
their events, as well as the idea that
they are open to any student who
wishes to explore a culture in more
depth.
"Usually students who live in
[ethnic theme houses] are those
who do wish to be involved in the
ethnic community, but the dorms
are open to anyone who wishes to
connect more or identify more
with the ethnicity of that dorm,"
said junior Prisilla Juarez, a resi
dent assistant in Casa Zapata. "Al
though some students may feel
that this dorm is only for Latinos
because of the strong emphasis on
culture and events, we constantly
remind people that this isn't the
case."
According to senior Anna

Minta, head peer academic coordi
nator at Ujamaa, ethnic theme
dorms exist to both celebrate cul
ture within an ethnic or racial
group as well as to foster cross-cul
tural exchange with members of
other groups.
"In Ujamaa, there are theme
programs every week that discuss
various aspects of either black cul
ture or black culture and its simi
larities to other cultures," Minta
said.
Many ethnic community cen
ters support a big-sib, little-sib pro
gram that matches freshmen with
upper-classmen who can help
them become oriented both social
ly and academically on campus, in
addition to other programming.
Yet despite the assortment of
ethnic resources, some freshmen

still say they feel isolated from stu
dents of other ethnicities and even
intimidated by those outside of
their own cultural communities.
This sentiment has led to reports
of voluntary segregation perpetu
ated by ethnic theme housing and
campus community centers.
"I would say that fora lot of stu
dents of color there is an experi
ence of isolation and alienation in
the rest of campus because in the
classroom there are so few people
of color and even in many of Stan
ford's activities there is little repre
sentation of students of color,"
Juarez said. "For many students
it's an important factor in feeling
comfortable. Ultimately though,
people are always intimidated by
other people regardless of race
and ethnicity."

Staff members in ethnic theme
dorms feel that accusations of vol
untary segregation are misplaced
since 50 percent of every theme
dorm on campus is comprised of
students who do not belong to the
ethnic group the house represents.
According to Minta, Ujamaa
staff members make a large effort
to encourage cross-cultural dia
logue, and the results have been
mostly positive.
"It's a shame that people con
demn ethnic theme houses and or
ganizations without taking the time
to learn about their mission and
purpose in the community," Rhue
said. "Usually these students have
made false assumptions about the
different ethnic communities.
"While four ethnic centers and
other resources cannot represent

every ethnicity on campus, they
provide valuable support to the stu
dents who use them," she added.
"Attending events held by these
centers despite discomfort would
open people's eyes and minds, and
possibly help this campus get past
the same debates and assumptions
every year about the validity of the
ethnic communities on campus."
Peralta emphasized the feeling
of safety and connection that most
students derive from their experi
ences in ethnic theme residences.
"There is comfort in seeing
your reflection in the people
around you," he said. "After a dif
ficult midterm or an excruciating
presentation, it's a comfort to be
with people who remind you of
your family and give you a sense of
home."

at the BC.SC, expressed her belief
that this class affinity probably
originated with the Partners for
Academic Excellence, a freshman
program created within the black
community that caused students to
come together within their class.
According to Rhue, some fresh
men may feel pressured to fit into
specific ethnic groups when they
first arrive due to the University's
focus on diversity and minority
representation.
"Students of all ethnicities,
some trying to be sensitive, ques
tion people about their racial cate
gory and its influence on their his
tory without reflecting on the true
variety of backgrounds possible,"
Rhue said.
In order to reduce the stress
surrounding ethnic identification,
community centers and other cul
tural organizations on campus em
phasize the voluntary nature of
their events, as well as the idea that
they are open to any student who
wishes to explore a culture in more
depth.
"Usually students who live in
[ethnic theme houses] are those
who do wish to be involved in the
ethnic community, but the dorms
are open to anyone who wishes to
connect more or identify more
with the ethnicity of that dorm,"
said junior Prisilla Juarez, a resi
dent assistant in Casa Zapata. "Al
though some students may feel
that this dorm is only for Latinos
because of the strong emphasis on
culture and events, we constantly
remind people that this isn't the
case."
According to senior Anna

Minta, head peer academic coordi
nator at Ujamaa, ethnic theme
dorms exist to both celebrate cul
ture within an ethnic or racial
group as well as to foster cross-cul
tural exchange with members of
other groups.
"In Ujamaa, there are theme
programs every week that discuss
various aspects of either black cul
ture or black culture and its simi
larities to other cultures," Minta
said.
Many ethnic community cen
ters support a big-sib, little-sib pro
gram that matches freshmen with
upper-classmen who can help
them become oriented both social
ly and academically on campus, in
addition to other programming.
Yet despite the assortment of
ethnic resources, some freshmen

still say they feel isolated from stu
dents of other ethnicities and even
intimidated by those outside of
their own cultural communities.
This sentiment has led to reports
of voluntary segregation perpetu
ated by ethnic theme housing and
campus community centers.
"I would say that fora lot of stu
dents of color there is an experi
ence of isolation and alienation in
the rest of campus because in the
classroom there are so few people
of color and even in many of Stan
ford's activities there is little repre
sentation of students of color,"
Juarez said. "For many students
it's an important factor in feeling
comfortable. Ultimately though,
people are always intimidated by
other people regardless of race
and ethnicity."

Staff members in ethnic theme
dorms feel that accusations of vol
untary segregation are misplaced
since 50 percent of every theme
dorm on campus is comprised of
students who do not belong to the
ethnic group the house represents.
According to Minta, Ujamaa
staff members make a large effort
to encourage cross-cultural dia
logue, and the results have been
mostly positive.
"It's a shame that people con
demn ethnic theme houses and or
ganizations without taking the time
to learn about their mission and
purpose in the community," Rhue
said. "Usually these students have
made false assumptions about the
different ethnic communities.
"While four ethnic centers and
other resources cannot represent

every ethnicity on campus, they
provide valuable support to the stu
dents who use them," she added.
"Attending events held by these
centers despite discomfort would
open people's eyes and minds, and
possibly help this campus get past
the same debates and assumptions
every year about the validity of the
ethnic communities on campus."
Peralta emphasized the feeling
of safety and connection that most
students derive from their experi
ences in ethnic theme residences.
"There is comfort in seeing
your reflection in the people
around you," he said. "After a dif
ficult midterm or an excruciating
presentation, it's a comfort to be
with people who remind you of
your family and give you a sense of
home."


ANDREA COX/The Stanford Daily
Students gather in the Black Community Services Center in November to request more student space. Black freshmen were more satisfied with their commu
nity center than any other ethnic group, according to a recent survey on the freshman experience. They were also the most likely to feel a strong connection
with their class.
The most ethnically diverse class to attend
Stanford in the history of the University will
flock to campus in September. According to
"The Freshman Year at Stanford," a survey ad
ministered by the Office of Freshman and
Transfer Students, these students' ethnicities
could have a significant impact on their satisfac
tion at Stanford, with Latino/a and Caucasian
students showing the highest level of satisfaction
and Asian Americans the lowest.
The survey, which was administered to cur
rent sophomores during fall quarter of 2002,
also reported that very few students became in
volved in community centers in their first year.
However, the majority of students who did par
ticipate said they were satisfied with their expe
riences.
El Centro Chicano Director M. Frances
Morales attributed Latino satisfaction to com
munity outreach efforts, noting that much of the
center's success comes from introducing fresh
men to ethnic resources when they first arrive
on campus.
"I know we do our best job in term of reach
ing out to the incoming students during Stan
ford Admit Weekend and then also during wel
come events in September," Morales said. "It's a
gradual process: first [freshmen] become aware,
then they attend programs, then they start vol
unteering."
latino and Caucasian students are more like
ly than their Asian-American peers to recom
mend Stanford to others or to say that they
would have chosen Stanford again if given the
opportunity.
"This survey conducted was a good first at
tempt at assessing the needs and satisfaction
level of freshmen [but] I think it is premature to
say that Asian students and alumni are not satis
fied with their Stanford experience based solely
on this particular survey," said Richard Yuen,
director of the Asian American Activities C Center.
"Some of the findings that are being posed from
the freshman survey were not meant to be con
clusive."
Although sophomore Tim Lu, co-chair of the
Stanford Asian American Activism Coalition,
also cautioned against placing too
much significance in the survey, he
acknowledged, "An often dis
cussed source of dissatisfaction is
the lack of a sense of community
among Asian Americans.
Morales concurred with Yuen's
sentiments.
"My colleagues at the A3C are
doing an excellent job, and these
numbers are not indicative of the
level of quality of programming
out of the A3C," she said. "They're
indicative of the complexity of the
Asian-American population."
The admitted Class 0f2007 is 13
percent African-American, 25 per
cent Asian-American, 11 percent
Mexican-American, 3 percent
Latino/a and 3 percent Native-
American or Native-Hawaiian.
While the community center
staff members said they want to
make sure students are aware of
the ethnic resources available, they
acknowledged that not all fresh
men will want to participate in cul
tural organizations.
"Much of a freshman's identifi
cation witli their ethnic group de
pends on their personal history,"
said junior Lauren Rhue, a coordi
nator for community services at
the Black Community Services
Center. "There is not one univer
sal black experience or Asian expe
rience or Latino experience."
Results of the freshman survey
reported that while only 9 percent
of first-year respondents live in
ethnic theme houses, these stu
dents appear to be satisfied with
their residence, well-acquainted
with a faculty member and are
more likely to feel they are a part of
the Stanford community at large.
Junior Jordan Peralta said that
he did not identify with his Filipino-
American heritage upon his arrival
at Stanford, yet through staffing at
Okada, he found that he was able to
learn more about his ethnicity.
"In my particular case, the pur
pose of ethnic theme housing, eth
nic centers, ethnic programming
and groups is to provide a resource
in which one may safely explore his
or her identity," Peralta said.
"More generally, these resources
are open to everyone who seeks to
learn more about a particular cul

ture."
Many freshmen have difficulties
in making friends when they first
arrive on campus, but ethnic
theme dorm and community cen
ter administrators said cultural
communities are instrumental in
smoothing this process.
"When I got to campus, I found
I made many Asian-American
friends just because I had so much
in common with them and we just
clicked," said freshman Florence
Lee, an administrative assistant at
the Asian American Activities Cen
ter.
Although black students split on
many of the survey's questions, re
sults indicated strong solidarity
with the Class of 2005.
Jan Barker-Alexander, director
at the BC.SC, expressed her belief
that this class affinity probably
originated with the Partners for
Academic Excellence, a freshman
program created within the black
