The most ethnically diverse class to attend
Stanford in the history of the University will
flock to campus in September. According to
"The Freshman Year at Stanford," a survey ad
ministered by the Office of Freshman and
Transfer Students, these students' ethnicities
could have a significant impact on their satisfac

on campus.
"I know we do our best job in term of reach

gradual process: first [freshmen] become aware,
then they attend programs, then they start vol
unteering."
latino and Caucasian students are more like

would have chosen Stanford again if given the
opportunity.
"This survey conducted was a good first at
tempt at assessing the needs and satisfaction
level of freshmen [but] I think it is premature to
say that Asian students and alumni are not satis

on this particular survey," said Richard Yuen,
director of the Asian American Activities C Center.
"Some of the findings that are being posed from
