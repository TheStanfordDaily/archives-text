# Students praise Res Ed, call for faculty contact
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
-1 he recent survey on freshman life con
ducted for Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims report
ed largely positive responses to the dormi
tory experience — arguably the most
meaningful part of freshman life. Overall,
63 percent of respondents were "very sat
isfied" with their residential life, meaning
they ranked it a 6 or 7 on a seven-point
scale. While most students said they were
happy with their resident assistants, they
were more critical of faculty involvement
in the dorms and of the Draw.
Regarding the survey as a whole, Direc
tor of Residential Education Jane Camar
illo said, "In an institution such as ours, we
often look for ways to improve. But I
would be very cautious not to discount that
the majority of freshman are satisfied with
the freshman experience at Stanford and
we will likely never achieve 100 percent
satisfaction."
The survey found that nearly seven in
10 students were "very satisfied" with their
RAs, who were rated by students as the
most positive aspect of freshman residen
tial life. Eleven percent of respondents
said they were dissatisfied with their RA
and ranked them a 1,2 or 3.
"I think the RAs in my dorm are all
great — genuine people who really care
about the residents and have worked hard
to make everyone enjoy the dorm experi
ence," said freshman Matt Stolzar.
Freshman Justin Liszanckie agreed.
"The entire residential staff, not just the
RAs, is, for the most part, excellent," he
said. "They are always there to meet your
needs and listen to your problems and
questions, and their enthusiasm is unpar
alleled."
Opinions varied a bit more when it
came to roommate compatibility. The sur
vey showed that 57 percent of students
were satisfied with their roommate com
patibility, while 21 percents were dissatis
fied.
Involvement of resident fellows got
positive views from the students inter
viewed, although RFs often have differing
ideas of their role in the dorm.
"There are some RFs who walk
through dorm halls making sure that
everything is OK," said Otero Resident
Fellow Jed Black. "Rut we feel that too
much interference can be counterproduc

tive and inhibitory. The frosh don't feel
like it's their place. They feel like they have
to watch what they're doing."
Responding to the survey's 20 percent
dissatisfaction rate with "the support and
responsiveness of the RF," Black said,
"Frosh often feel that there should be
more interaction with the RFs, not realiz
ing that is not our role. First and foremost,
we are mentors for the staff. VVe let the RAs
take a leadership role and help them with
whatever they are planning."
On par with the results of the survey,
the lowest student satisfaction came from
"faculty involvement (not including RFs)
at the residence" and"the Draw process."
"Faculty involvement sucks," Liszanck
ie said. "They show up once a quarter for
faculty nights, which is a nice idea, but un
less you ask them to show up, you won't
see them around the dorm."
While 30 percent of respondents said
they were "very satisfied" with non-RF fac
ulty involvement in their residences, 31
percent were "dissatisfied."
Otero RAand I lead Peer Academic Co
ordinator Nic Kanaan, a junior, said, "Of
course residents are going to feel lower sat
isfaction with faculty involvement. It is not
that there isn't an effort made by the staff
to bring in faculty and create a connec
tion — it is more so that it is not as highly
received. Academic programs are some of
the least highly received programming by
the residents. When only a handful of res
idents show up, the staff no longer at
tempts a similar program."
The Draw process also drew some neg
ative reviews.
"It seems unfair that a lottery deter
mines your number, in that you can get
screwed every year, but I can't think of an
alternative," said freshman David Oleson.
Students and staff had a lot to say about
the differences between four-class and all
frosh dorms, in response to the survey re
sults, which showed that students who
lived in an all-frosh dorm were more like
ly to be very satisfied with their residence
(69 percent versus 53 percent), with the
Residential Education program (40 per
cent versus 31 percent) and with the cam
pus environment overall (69 percent ver
sus 62 percent).
"I think an all-frosh dorm is far superi
or to a four-class clorm," said Liszanckie,
who lives in Roble, a four-class dorm. "The
spirit in an all-frosh dorm is something
that everyone should be able to experi

ence, and knowing that everyone is in the
exact same position as you are makes it
more fun for everyone."
Oleson, who lives in an all-frosh dorm,
agreed and said, "I think that all-frosh
dorms are much more social because
everyone living in them is looking to be so
cial and make friends, which is not always
the case with upperclassmen who have es
tablished their friends at Stanford."
Camarillo offered a different interpre
tation of the increased dissatisfaction with
four-class dorms.
" 'Satisfaction' may be dramatically af
fected by whether or not someone got
what they wanted . . . not getting what one
wants might actually have an effect on how
they rank everything about their first-year
experience," Camarillo said, calling this a
"halo effect."
"My suggestion is that if we are better
able to meet the demand for types of hous
es, satisfaction will go up rather than as

sume lhat everyone wants all-frosh houses
or that those who do not want an all-frosh
houses but get assigned there would be
very satisfied on the constructs reported in
this survey."
These results and responses seem to
suggest that expanding the amount of all
frosh housing on campus would be benefi
cial to the student body. Whereas 75 per
cent of incoming freshmen request all
frosh housing, the current dorm situation
only allows 55 percent of students to live in
all-frosh dorms. Students in all-frosh
houses were also more likely, by significant
margins, to be very satisfied with their
freshman year overall ((i7 percent versus
59 percent), to feel that Stanford exceeded
their expectations (52 percent versus 39
percent) and to feel "a great deal of pride
in their Stanford affiliation" (76 percent
versus (il percent). There were no mea
sures on which students in four-class
dorms responded more favorably than

students in all-frosh dorms.
"We have made changes to better meet
the demand for all-frosh housing," Ca
marillo said. "Our major constraint at this
time for making more progress is the
amount of housing that we have to fulfill
our four-year housing guarantee. If we
had approximately 300-400 additional
spaces in the housing system (in particu
lar, upper-class houses), we might first
begin to unstuff the spaces desirable to
upper-class students and, then, create one
more 100 person all-frosh house."
Students residing in
Freshman / Sophomore College and eth
nic theme houses were excluded from
these conclusions, and the small sampling
sizes of both of these groups makes it hard
to construct reliable inferences about them
as a group. Only 6 percent of respondents
lived in Freshman / Sophomore College
and 9 percent of those surveyed lived in an
ethnic theme dorm.

the majority of freshman are satisfied with
the freshman experience at Stanford and
we will likely never achieve 100 percent
satisfaction."
The survey found that nearly seven in
10 students were "very satisfied" with their
RAs, who were rated by students as the
most positive aspect of freshman residen
tial life. Eleven percent of respondents
said they were dissatisfied with their RA
and ranked them a 1,2 or 3.
"I think the RAs in my dorm are all
great — genuine people who really care
about the residents and have worked hard
to make everyone enjoy the dorm experi
ence," said freshman Matt Stolzar.
Freshman Justin Liszanckie agreed.
"The entire residential staff, not just the
RAs, is, for the most part, excellent," he
said. "They are always there to meet your
needs and listen to your problems and
questions, and their enthusiasm is unpar
alleled."
Opinions varied a bit more when it
came to roommate compatibility. The sur
vey showed that 57 percent of students
were satisfied with their roommate com
patibility, while 21 percents were dissatis
fied.
Involvement of resident fellows got
positive views from the students inter
viewed, although RFs often have differing
ideas of their role in the dorm.
"There are some RFs who walk
through dorm halls making sure that
everything is OK," said Otero Resident
Fellow Jed Black. "Rut we feel that too
much interference can be counterproduc

tive and inhibitory. The frosh don't feel
like it's their place. They feel like they have
to watch what they're doing."
Responding to the survey's 20 percent
dissatisfaction rate with "the support and
responsiveness of the RF," Black said,
"Frosh often feel that there should be
more interaction with the RFs, not realiz
ing that is not our role. First and foremost,
we are mentors for the staff. VVe let the RAs
take a leadership role and help them with
whatever they are planning."
On par with the results of the survey,
the lowest student satisfaction came from
"faculty involvement (not including RFs)
at the residence" and"the Draw process."
"Faculty involvement sucks," Liszanck
ie said. "They show up once a quarter for
faculty nights, which is a nice idea, but un
less you ask them to show up, you won't
see them around the dorm."
While 30 percent of respondents said
they were "very satisfied" with non-RF fac
ulty involvement in their residences, 31
percent were "dissatisfied."
Otero RAand I lead Peer Academic Co
ordinator Nic Kanaan, a junior, said, "Of
course residents are going to feel lower sat
isfaction with faculty involvement. It is not
that there isn't an effort made by the staff
to bring in faculty and create a connec
tion — it is more so that it is not as highly
received. Academic programs are some of
the least highly received programming by
the residents. When only a handful of res
idents show up, the staff no longer at
tempts a similar program."
The Draw process also drew some neg
ative reviews.
"It seems unfair that a lottery deter
mines your number, in that you can get
screwed every year, but I can't think of an
alternative," said freshman David Oleson.
Students and staff had a lot to say about
the differences between four-class and all
frosh dorms, in response to the survey re
sults, which showed that students who
lived in an all-frosh dorm were more like
ly to be very satisfied with their residence
(69 percent versus 53 percent), with the
Residential Education program (40 per
cent versus 31 percent) and with the cam
pus environment overall (69 percent ver
sus 62 percent).
"I think an all-frosh dorm is far superi
or to a four-class clorm," said Liszanckie,
who lives in Roble, a four-class dorm. "The
spirit in an all-frosh dorm is something
that everyone should be able to experi

ence, and knowing that everyone is in the
exact same position as you are makes it
more fun for everyone."
Oleson, who lives in an all-frosh dorm,
agreed and said, "I think that all-frosh
dorms are much more social because
everyone living in them is looking to be so
cial and make friends, which is not always
the case with upperclassmen who have es
tablished their friends at Stanford."
Camarillo offered a different interpre
tation of the increased dissatisfaction with
four-class dorms.
" 'Satisfaction' may be dramatically af
fected by whether or not someone got
what they wanted . . . not getting what one
wants might actually have an effect on how
they rank everything about their first-year
experience," Camarillo said, calling this a
"halo effect."
"My suggestion is that if we are better
able to meet the demand for types of hous
es, satisfaction will go up rather than as

sume lhat everyone wants all-frosh houses
or that those who do not want an all-frosh
houses but get assigned there would be
very satisfied on the constructs reported in
this survey."
These results and responses seem to
suggest that expanding the amount of all
frosh housing on campus would be benefi
cial to the student body. Whereas 75 per
cent of incoming freshmen request all
frosh housing, the current dorm situation
only allows 55 percent of students to live in
all-frosh dorms. Students in all-frosh
houses were also more likely, by significant
margins, to be very satisfied with their
freshman year overall ((i7 percent versus
59 percent), to feel that Stanford exceeded
their expectations (52 percent versus 39
percent) and to feel "a great deal of pride
in their Stanford affiliation" (76 percent
versus (il percent). There were no mea
sures on which students in four-class
dorms responded more favorably than

students in all-frosh dorms.
"We have made changes to better meet
the demand for all-frosh housing," Ca
marillo said. "Our major constraint at this
time for making more progress is the
amount of housing that we have to fulfill
our four-year housing guarantee. If we
had approximately 300-400 additional
spaces in the housing system (in particu
lar, upper-class houses), we might first
begin to unstuff the spaces desirable to
upper-class students and, then, create one
more 100 person all-frosh house."
Students residing in
Freshman / Sophomore College and eth
nic theme houses were excluded from
these conclusions, and the small sampling
sizes of both of these groups makes it hard
to construct reliable inferences about them
as a group. Only 6 percent of respondents
lived in Freshman / Sophomore College
and 9 percent of those surveyed lived in an
ethnic theme dorm.
