# Survey reveals students want to feel 'valued as people' by the University
## Tackling the intangibles 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
With a perceived emphasis on high
SA T scores, impressive high school GPAs
and similar statistics, Stanford's admis
sions process can make it difficult for in
coming freshmen to see themselves de
fined by anything more than a set of num
bers. New Student Orientation and Resi
dential Education try to combat this think
ing by fostering communities upon the ar
rival of new students on campus.
Nonetheless, when 49 percent of the
sophomore class was surveyed this fall
about their freshman experience, many
respondents indicated that they were dis
satisfied with the extent to which Stanford
"valued [them] as a person."
According to Jerold Pearson, the direc
tor of market research at the Alumni As
sociation, "That [valued as a person] is a
very intangible concept, and I think it's
harder for people to give superlatives to
something like that," Pearson said.
While the concept may be rather
vague, the survey's questions about being
valued as a person centered around five
concrete categories — independence,
support in times of need, faculty interest
in students, administrative interest in stu
dents and the University's response to stu
dent concerns.
The report also included a leverage
analysis by the Pacific Consulting Compa
ny, which said that increasing the feelings
in students that they are valued as people
would lead to the greatest increase in sat
isfaction with freshman life.
According to the survey, freshmen
tended to be very satisfied with the Uni
versity trusting them with independence
and adult responsibilities, even to the ex
treme of believing they had too much in
dependence and not enough direction —
a fact that encouraged Dean of Freshman
and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-
Haims.
"I think these numbers are great," she
said. "I'm actually surprised we didn't get
a higher number who feel we don't give
them enough independence. I certainly
wouldn't want the pendulum to swing
back in that direction. Independence can
be scary and overwhelming, which may
account for the feeling behind the 25 per
cent who feel they have too much of it."
Student approval of the freedom
granted to them was the only criterion
that the majority of surveyed sophomores
said thev were very satisfied with. Consid

erably fewer students were content with
the degree to which the "University pro
vides support and help in time of need"
and to which "faculty care about and take
an interest in you."
This year's freshmen seemed sympa
thetic to these results, but the general re
action was that the University did a better
job than the survey suggested.
"I think that there are always plenty of
resources for students who are having
problems or want to get in touch with fac
ulty members, but you have to take the
initiative yourself to reap their benefits,"
said freshman Sarah Carroll. "For exam
ple, talking to professors is obviously a
great opportunity, and in my experience,
they're always incredibly eager to meet
with students, but they can't come to you
— you have to make an effort and go to

their office hours. Likewise, a student who
feels like he or she needs some kind of
emotional support should be aware that
there are countless University resources
available, but again, it would be impossi
ble to take advantage of them without ac
tively pursuing them."
Vet not all students find these re
sources that accessible. One freshman
who wished to remain anonymous scoffed
at the idea of seeking out her academic ad
visers for help.
"The academic advisory program is a
joke," she said. "It gives me no direction,
and my [academic adviser] wouldn't
know if I were having academic problems
or not."
In fact, only a third of students re
sponding claimed to l>e very satisfied with
the Undergraduate Advising Center. Sat

isfaction with all student services tended
to be low, with an overall 34 percent satis
faction rate for centers ranging from the
Bursar's Office to Cowell — now
Vaden — Student Health Service to the
Career Development Center.
Satisfaction was lowest with the extent
to which "the University is responsive to
student concerns" and "administrators
and staff care about and take an interest in
you."
Lythcott-Haims, while admitting that
the University has made some mistakes in
its day-to-day operations, said that admin
istrators are trying to improve the situa
tion by granting students more participa
tion and a larger voice in University deci
sions. The primary medium for this input
is in student membership on University
committees.

"As a rule, we care a great deal about
students' involvement in decision-mak
ing, and committee work is a great way to
make a student's voice heard," Lythcott-
Haims said. "Of course, we don't always
get it right, as was demonstrated by the
process we just went through surround
ing revisions to the Alcohol Policy. I think
we learned a lot from that experience, and
we're all committed to doing things better
next time around."
Students interviewed expressed over
all contentment with the administrative
system, despite its problems.
"People here just want so much free
dom," said freshman Noah Lang. "But
the University is just like a small city, so of
course it's going to have its problems with
bureaucracy and administration."
University President John Hennessy
said he was aware of these problems and
that he hopes to improve the administra
tion's services.
"It's clear that we know that we have
challenges making it easy for students to
deal with all of the standard issues at the
University — paying your bills, getting
something fixed with the registrar — but
clearly what 1 think the survey told us is
when you do a lousy job on those things,
students don't feel like they're being treat
ed well," he said. "It's a reminder that
when you run into the relentless bureau
cracy, it comes back in other ways, and
people don't feel good about it."
Lythcott-Haims is in the process of con
vening an Advisory Group on the Fresh
man Experience at Stanford of about 60
people to review and possibly revamp the
traditional freshman programs for the in
coming Class of '07, in order to increase
student satisfaction with their sense of
being valued.
A primary way in which the University
endeavors to make freshmen feel valued
is through the Approaching Stanford pro
gram and New Student Orientation.
"The moment a student returns her in
formation forms in the summer before
coming to Stanford, she ceases to be a de
mographic and becomes a person with
hopes, fears and a personality," said New
Undergraduate Housing Coordinator
Emil Martinsek, a junior. "Throughout
the summer, the Approaching Stanford
program is in charge of handling infor
mation exchange between freshmen,
transfers and the University .. . We at-

tempt to humanize students in all
steps of this process so that the
transition to Stanford is as smooth
as possible. The folly is to believe
that a dean will actually sit down
and do all the assignments and an
swer all the phone calls individual
ly. That is simply impossible."
Another important means of
reaching out to freshmen, accord
ing to Lythcott-Haims, is the Resi
dential Education program, which
seeks to ease the transition for in
coming freshman and increase
their sense of belonging.
"The Res Ed system strives to
create a community of students
who care about one another," she
said. "From RFs to RAs to RDs, if a
student is in some kind of predica
ment, they are willing and able to
help. In my office, we try to carry
this philosophy through to the end
of the freshman year, by having
meaningful person-to-person in
teractions and thoughtful, respon
sive and encouraging conversa
tions. 1 never miss an opportunity
to tell the '06ers just how special
they are to us. I hope these good
feelings are making a difference in
their freshman experience."
