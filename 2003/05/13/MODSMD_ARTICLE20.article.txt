Editorial

Every day, in a box to the left of its
masthead, 1 he New York Times
publishes its motto: "All the News
1 hat's l it to Print." But the news
paper reported on Sunday that one of its
own had failed to live up to this principle.
"A staff reporter for The New York Times
committed frequent acts of journalistic
fraud while covering significant news
events in recent months," the story began.
1 he article revealed that over the course of
seven months, Jayson Blair fabricated
quotations and scenes — he claimed to
have been in places he had never been and
to have interviewed people he had never
spoken to — and plagiarized information
from other newspapers and news services
in at least 36 articles. The New York Times
described the incident as a "profound be
trayal of trust and a low point in the 152-
year history of the newspaper."
While Blair no longer works for The
New York limes — he resigned on May
1 — his actions continue to have an im
pact on those who work to publish one of
the most respected and prestigious news
papers in the country. "Just about every
one at this newspaper is sick at heart at
the way one Times reporter betrayed
our readers and all of us with his sus
tained deceit and plagiarism," wrote
William Safire, an Op-Ed columnist for
The New York Times. Arthur Sulzberger
Jr., chairman of The New York Times
Company and publisher of the newspa
per, called it"a huge black eye" and "an
abrogation of the trust between the
newspaper and its readers."
One woman who was falsely quoted in
one of Blair's articles — she had never
spoken to him — said, "The New York
limes. You would expect more out of
that." The newspaper cannot undo the
harm that Blair has caused; instead, it
must work to restore the faith that its
readers used to have in the publication.
The article publicly acknowledging Blair's
activities was the necessary first step in re
building the newspaper's relationship
with its readers.
In the coming weeks. The New York
rimes must commit itself to explaining
how Blair was able to lie for so long. The
answer, as reported by The New York
limes, was a lack of communication
among the editors at the newspaper. As a
result, Howell Raines, the executive direc
tor of The New York limes, said that he
will "assign a task force of newsroom em

ployees to identify lessons for the newspa
per." Once the task force convenes and be
gins to assess what went wrong at The New
York Times, it is important that the pro
cess and the findings are made public. The
New York Times placed tremendous im
portance in revealing Blair's mistakes —
the article appeared on the front page
and on four inside pages in its Sunday edi
tion, which has the highest circulation —
and it must devote the same kind of atten
tion to what the task force discovers.
What The New York Times chooses to
do from this day forth will be crucial not
only for the newspaper but also for jour
nalists across the nation. This incident has
brought into question the work that all re
porters and editors do, and The New York
limes recognizes this fact. In an editorial
that was also published Sunday, the edito
rial staff wrote that the newspaper apolo
gizes "to those whose work was purloined
and to all conscientious journalists whose
professional trust has been betrayed by
this episode." It is unfortunate that the
thoughtless and irresponsible actions of
one reporter have had this kind of effect.
But journalists everywhere can also take
this opportunity to critically examine their
responsibilities and roles in society.
Like all those who read about Blair's his
tory at The New York Times, we at The
Daily were shocked. Moreover, as student
journalists, we were dismayed and disap
pointed. A position as a reporter for The
New York Times is a highly coveted one;
many of us who spend days and nights in
the Storke Publications Building aspire to
be a reporter for the newspaper one day.
Thus it is confusing to us why a reporter
who seemed to have a job that he had
wanted for so long — Blair first began
writing for his high school newspaper —
and worked so hard for — he interned at
The Boston Globe and at The New York
Times as a college student — would do
what Blair did.
At the same time, we are also glad that
The New York Times has shown that it is
determined make right what has gone
terribly wrong. By doing so, The New
York limes has once again demonstrated
why it has been, and will continue to be,
an example of journalistic excellence. If
the No. 1 rule at a newspaper is to accu
rately report the truth, then the No. 2
rule is that when it fails to do, it must cor
rect any false information that has been
passed for the truth.

per, called it"a huge black eye" and "an
abrogation of the trust between the
newspaper and its readers."
One woman who was falsely quoted in
one of Blair's articles — she had never
spoken to him — said, "The New York
limes. You would expect more out of
that." The newspaper cannot undo the
harm that Blair has caused; instead, it
must work to restore the faith that its
readers used to have in the publication.
The article publicly acknowledging Blair's
activities was the necessary first step in re
building the newspaper's relationship
with its readers.
In the coming weeks. The New York
rimes must commit itself to explaining
how Blair was able to lie for so long. The
answer, as reported by The New York
limes, was a lack of communication
among the editors at the newspaper. As a
result, Howell Raines, the executive direc
tor of The New York limes, said that he
will "assign a task force of newsroom em

ployees to identify lessons for the newspa
per." Once the task force convenes and be
gins to assess what went wrong at The New
York Times, it is important that the pro
cess and the findings are made public. The
New York Times placed tremendous im
portance in revealing Blair's mistakes —
the article appeared on the front page
and on four inside pages in its Sunday edi
tion, which has the highest circulation —
and it must devote the same kind of atten
tion to what the task force discovers.
What The New York Times chooses to
do from this day forth will be crucial not
only for the newspaper but also for jour
nalists across the nation. This incident has
brought into question the work that all re
porters and editors do, and The New York
limes recognizes this fact. In an editorial
that was also published Sunday, the edito
rial staff wrote that the newspaper apolo
gizes "to those whose work was purloined
and to all conscientious journalists whose
professional trust has been betrayed by
this episode." It is unfortunate that the
thoughtless and irresponsible actions of
one reporter have had this kind of effect.
But journalists everywhere can also take
this opportunity to critically examine their
responsibilities and roles in society.
Like all those who read about Blair's his
tory at The New York Times, we at The
Daily were shocked. Moreover, as student
journalists, we were dismayed and disap
pointed. A position as a reporter for The
New York Times is a highly coveted one;
many of us who spend days and nights in
the Storke Publications Building aspire to
be a reporter for the newspaper one day.
Thus it is confusing to us why a reporter
who seemed to have a job that he had
wanted for so long — Blair first began
writing for his high school newspaper —
and worked so hard for — he interned at
The Boston Globe and at The New York
Times as a college student — would do
what Blair did.
At the same time, we are also glad that
The New York Times has shown that it is
determined make right what has gone
terribly wrong. By doing so, The New
York limes has once again demonstrated
why it has been, and will continue to be,
an example of journalistic excellence. If
the No. 1 rule at a newspaper is to accu
rately report the truth, then the No. 2
rule is that when it fails to do, it must cor
rect any false information that has been
passed for the truth.
