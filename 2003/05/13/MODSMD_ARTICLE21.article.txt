# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Being John Hennessy 
### 
Last Saturday, University
President John Hennessy
presided over Stanford
Day in Sacramento — lit
erally, as Stanford graduates in the
state legislature signed a resolu
tion officially welcoming him to
the capitol. That day, the Capitol
Building, with an exterior reminis
cent of a discolored White House,
was the locale where Stanford ad
ministrators and alumni could run
amok in the labyrinth of state
power. Governor Gray Davis,
Class of 1964, was the honorary
chair, but didn't show up. It's just
as well; if he did attend, some other
people would not have.
The formula for Stanford Day
was simple. Round up some high
powered alumni — that's hopeful
ly us a few years down the line —
and have them mingle with some
eminent professors. Lecturers in
cluded Hennessy; Sharon Long,
dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences; Pamela Matson,
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences; and Channing Robertson,
associate dean of the School

of Engineering.. Even
though cumulus clouds satu- "
rated the sky that day,
Robertson, a pilot, still flew
all the panelists from Stan
ford to Sacramento in a small
airplane.
"I could've ended this
thing right here," Robertson
noted during a panel discus
sion, referring to their flight.
Prospects of death
notwithstanding, such a col
lusion of intellect and money
must be fora worthy cause.
Indeed, besides the usual
networking, the purpose of
the event was to promote the •
Campaign for Undergradu
ate Education (CUE), which

provides money for financial aid
and programs like I-Hum and
Stanford Introductory Seminars.
Fortunately, things are going ac
cording to plan: To date, with
Hennessy at the helm, Stanford
has raised $839 million of its $ 1 bil
lion goal.
Before Stanford Day in Sacra
mento, I saw the elusive Universi
ty president exactly twice: fresh
man convocation, and walking by
the Claw, when I stared and he
kindly pretended not to notice. So
when we met up this time (I was of
ficially shadowing him for the day)
I had to ask: After a hard day of
work, surely you must secretly
enjoy a glass of— oh, 1 don' t
know — Hennessy cognac?
"I have a bottle, but I have no
great taste for high proof liquor,"
he said with a laugh. Instead, he
prefers a glass of wine.
His Irish heritage (hence, his
surname Hennessy) melds well

with the Italian-American back
ground of his wife, Andrea. Never
theless, in the president's house
hold, he admits that Mrs. Hen
nessy's extended "family of nine
dominates my family of six.." Pret
ty humble fora guy who's written
two seminal text books and found
ed MIPS Technologies, a multi
million dollar company.
Of course, naturally there are

perks with being
the University
president. In the
Capitol Building,
Hennessy was
whisked to the
second floor in a
secret elevator
usually reserved
for state repre-

sentatives. And when we passed
through the legislators' parking
garage, he casually noted that the
cars of the congressmen in Wash
ington, D.C. are much nicer.
At Stanford, Provost John
Etchemendy is largely responsible
for the day-to-day operations.

These days, university presidents,
finding it difficult to cope with the
long hours and perpetual duress of
such a position, We increasingly
shorter tenures. Nevertheless, fores
hoping that Hennessys boundless
energy will continue to light this
university for years to come.

Hennessy's primary role, on the
other hand, is to act as the Stanford
ambassador to the world beyond
Palm Drive. The great thing is that
he fulfills that role with unbridled
enthusiasm, as if it were his first
day on the job.
Over lunch, in a brick basement
tucked beneath the Capitol Build
ing, Hennessy gave his first speech
of the day. Upon being introduced,
Hennessy got up from his chair,
put his neatly folded napkin be
sides a half-eaten salad and made
his way to the podium. Embla
zoned on the wall behind him was
the California state seal, along with
the word "Eureka" printed in bold
face, a few feet above his head. A
couple of minutes into his speech, I
put my fork down to listen to his
New York-tinged voice; when I
looked around, I noticed that he
also had the undivided attention of
everyone else in the room. I think
we were drawn in by the melodic

ebb and flow of his words.
During a meet-and-greet fol
lowing Hennessy's speech, people
gravitated toward him. Leaning
casually on a railing, with one foot
perched on top of a wastebasket,
Hennessy fielded a medley of
questions — some intelligent, oth
ers not so penetrating — and
whatever reply Hennessy gave al
lowed the person to walk away
with a smile on his or her face.
With a wealth of knowledge and a
touch of wit, his off-the-cuff re
marks pierced through the air and
entranced listeners all around.
Such eloquence is accompanied
by, or perhaps derived from, his
honesty — his willingness to not
let political correctness stifle his
thought. He deadpanned the rea
son housing is so expensive in the
area: "We're letting Silicon Valley
tank." Moreover, noting that the
Medical Center isn't turning over
huge profits, Hennessy jokingly
welcomed people to stay at the
hospital.
The day concluded with some

casual lectures from profes
sors — something that
alumni readily look forward
to. "After spending time in
the real world, you'll miss the
intellectual atmosphere at
Stanford," an alumnus told
me. After one lecture, about
tiles falling off the space shut
tle Columbia, Hennessy
asked questions as eagerly as
any first-quarter freshman.
Once class was over, Hen
nessy made some small talk,
picked up a forgetful man's
umbrella off the floor for
him and briskly made his
way out the door. In the hall
way, he caught up with an
older alumnus, a tall man

with arrow-straight posture.
I thought nothing of it at the time.
Later on I discovered the man was
Peter Bing, one of Stanford's
biggest benefactors.
I got back to Stanford from
Sacramento around 9 p.m. Satur
day night. I can only imagine Hen
nessy arrived a lot later. When I
woke up Sunday afternoon, I saw
an e-mail in my inbox, time
stamped 7 a.m. It was from Hen
nessy, a reply to something I had
sent the night before.
These days, university presi
dents, finding it difficult to cope
with the long hours and perpetual
duress of such a position, have in
creasingly shorter tenures. Never
theless, here's hoping that Hen
nessy's boundless energy will con
tinue to light this university for
years to come.
