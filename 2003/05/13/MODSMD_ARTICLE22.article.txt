# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## N. Korean Human Rights Week promotes education, discussion 
### SUNG LEE GUEST COLUMNIST 
There has been an upsurge of interest
in North Korea after the Stalinist country
disclosed last October that it had renewed
efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Since
then, it seems as if not a single day goes by
without Pyongyang carrying out more
reckless deeds to escalate the crisis or ex
changing hostile threats with Washington
D.C.. With a recent trilateral talk in lk'i
jing dissolving without any tangible agree
ments made, the current nuclear standoff
seems poised to continue, if not deterio
rate. Many people point out, and correct
ly so, the need for more scholarship on the
nuclear threat that North Korea poses not
only to East Asia but also to the world.
The sad truth, however, is that amid
the discussion of regional security and nu
clear nonproliferation for South Korea,
Japan and China, as well as the war against
terrorism for the United States, a central
part of this issue has been neglected: the
human rights of North Koreans.
As the security concerns dominate
headlines of all U.S. and international
news media, the sufferings of 22 million

North Koreans are missing from public
awareness. Even at Stanford, a place filled
with some of the most highly educated
people in the world, you would be hard
pressed to find many students knowledge
able about this situation or even aware that
there is far more occurring in North
Korea than the nuclear crisis.
It is in recognizing this desperate need
for more awareness of the North Korean
human rights situation that the Korean
American Student Association and
Hwimori are holding North Korean
Human Rights Week.
According to the U.S. State Depart
ment, North Korea has one of the worst
human tights records in the world. Last
month, the U.S. envoy to the United Na
tions Commission on Human Rights,
Jeane Kirkpatrick, stated that North
Korea was "hell on earth" and that "it is
hard to imagine the possibility of a country
whose citizens endure a worse or more
pervasive abuse of every human right."
The government prohibits freedoms of
speech, press, assembly, association, reli
gion, movement and more. The draconi
an penal code stipulates capital punish
ment and confiscation of assets fora wide

variety of "crimes against revolution," in
cluding defection, attempted defection,
slander of the policies of the state, listening
to foreign broadcasts and possessing "re
actionary" printed matter.
Experts say that the Orwellian political
system is mainly responsible for the recent
famine that has killed at least 2 million
people, 10 percent of the population. Ac
cording to the World Food Program, 57
percent of the population is malnour
ished, including 45 percent of children
under five. From any perspective, North
Korea is, as Human Rights Watch calls it,
a "human rights disaster."
Those who escaped political concentra
tion camps tell stories of horror beyond
imagination. Prison guards kill newborn
babies in front of their mothers. A female
prisoner dies after being beaten by prison
guards like a soccer hall, with her wounds
filled with maggots. Molten metal is
poured on Christians who refuse to dis
avow their faith. The open goal of these
camps, detaining political dissidents
whose loyalty to the Party is "beyond re
covery," is to eradicate three generations
of their inmates. An estimated 1.5 million
prisoners have been killed in the camps.

Approximately 200,000 are currently im
prisoned.
Those who risk their lives and succeed
in escaping to China to find food and
freedom there are not better off. The
Chinese government continues to violate
refugees' rights and repatriates them to
North Korea, where they will most likely
face persecution; North Korean refugees
are exploited by those around them who
threaten to report them to the authori
ties. The sexual slavery of North Korean
refugee women in China is an urgent
human rights issue that has yet to attract
the attention of the international com
munity.
North Korean Human Rights Week
will provide an opportunity for members
of the Stanford community to learn more
about this situation. Following last night's
talk by Douglas Shin, a prominent activist
involved in organizing "underground
railroads" to help North Koreans escape
from their country, tonight there will be a
showing of an award-winning documen
tary tracing the life of North Korean
refugees lead in China. There will also be
a dialogue for all of us to ask questions and
discuss the issue, as well as a benefit con

cert by Hwimori on Friday night on behalf
of North Korean refugees. The events are
open to everyone in the Stanford commu
nity and in Bay Area who believe in the
primacy of human rights and dignity.
KASA and Hwimori implore everyone to
come out and learn about this human
rights tragedy that is occurring right this
minute.
Looking back at history, we have
learned to question the contemporaries of
infamous human rights fiascos. We have a
hard time accepting their excuses that
they could not believe what they were
hearing, although the stories of cannibal
ism and other inhumane acts of cruelty
and desperation in North Korea could be
only described as unbelievable.
It is time to shake ourselves off of
shocked disbelief. And it is time to break
out of apathy and ignorance, because
North Korea is our Pol Pot, our Pinochet.
It is our Holocaust.
