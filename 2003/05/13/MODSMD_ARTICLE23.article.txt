### DAN URBAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One of only four seniors on the Cardi
nal baseball roster, catcher Ryan Garko
has made his last year at Stanford one to
remember.
No bat in the Cardinal lineup produces
more for the team than Garko's, and op
posing base runners likely think hard be
fore attempting to steal off his strong arm.
The combination of his explosive bat and
solid work behind the plate has made

Garko the team's most distinguished vet
eran.
While his season stilts are impressive,
Garko's Pacific-10 Conference numbers are
otherworldly—he leads the team in batting
average (.434), home runs (10), RBI (37)
and slugging percentage (.880).
Garko's 2003 season is a fitting end to
four years of exceptional play at Stanford
that has helped lead the team to three
straight College World Series.
With a collegiate career as distin
guished as Garko's, there are bound to be

some stellar highlights. Garko points to
the 2002 College World Series as one of his
most memorable experiences in a Cardi
nal uniform.
"[Cal State] Fullerton was ranked No. 1
and we beat them, plus I got to catch the
first pitch from [President George W.
Bush]; that whole series was just incredi
ble."
While catching a pitch from the presi
dent was a great honor, Garko has caught
the heat of some much stronger arms.
Garko says catching for some of the na

tion's best pitching talent has been one of
the most rewarding aspects of his time at
Stanford.
"I look back at the guys I've caught,
first-rounders like Jeremy Guthrie and
Jason Young," he said. "It was unbeliev
able working with those guys, seeing how
they approach the game and go after hit
ters. I'm hoping to pass that on to the
freshmen."
Whether he'll have one more memo
rable trip to Omaha is yet to be deter
mined. The Cardinal has all the tools, but
with a young and often inconsistent pitch
ing staff that lacks the depth of years past,
Stanford's margin of error in t he postsea
son will be very slim.
"I think we have to play up to our full
capabilities as a team. Before we could
get away with a couple mistakes, because
our team was that good, but we have less
breathing room now. We're relying on a
couple of young pitchers," said Garko of
freshmen Mark Romanczuk, Matt Man
ship and Kodiak Quick, all of whom
have provided fantastic performances
on the mound this year, but whose rela
tive inexperience will be fully tested in
the playoffs.
While their performance will be crucial,
Garko doesn't place the burden of the
team's chances on the young hurlers'
shoulders.
"As the older guys, the nucleus of the
time, guys like Sam [Fuld], Brian [Hall],
Carlos [Quentin], John [Hudgins] and I —
we have to play well behind them. It's our
job to step up."
In addition to his CWS experiences,
Garko says he'll always remember the last
two weekends, in which the Cardinal

swept its rivals USC and Cal.
"If I could've picked a way to end my
Stanford career, sweeping USC and Cal
would have been it. I couldn't write a bet
ter way to go out."
Not only did the team get the two
sweeps, but Garko shined in both series.
Garko said g(x>d-bye to the Trojans with 12
RBIs and three home runs, including one
grand slam. His effort at USC earned him
Pac-10 Player of the Week. Garko took the
spotlight again against Cal, driving in the
winning run in the ninth inning of Friday's
game with a two-out single.
The game-winning hit at Cal was only
typical of Garko, who has earned his rep
utation as a clutch hitter. His numbers
speak for themselves, but a less tangible
strength of Garko's has been his consis
tent delivery of hits in high-pressure sit
uations.
Garko will catch his last Pac-1() series
this weekend as the Cardinal takes on
UCLA at Sunken Diamond, and while
there's no telling how much further the
Cardinal's season will proceed, Garko con
siders his four years at Stanford time well
spent.
"I've really enjoyed being a part of
Stanford baseball. I've had a great time
playing for Coach Marquess, and I'm a
better player and a better person than I
was the day 1 got here because of him. He's
a great coach, and above that he's a good
person. He does things the right way and
expects us to do the same."
Garko has more than done his part in
making sure the Cardinal gets things done
the right way, and his bat, his leadership
and his presence behind the plate will all
be missed.
