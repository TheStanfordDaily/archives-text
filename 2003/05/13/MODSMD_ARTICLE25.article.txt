# A
						call to sports fans to get out of the closet

### BRIAN DUNNE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Alright, hypothetical situa
tion. It's the seventh game
of the ALCS, and the Yan
kees are trailing t he Red Sox
3-2. Bottom of the ninth, two outs,
and the Yankees have loaded the
bases against the Red Sox closer.
(Granted, this calls for some group
visualization thanks to Theo Ep
stein's "ingenious" closer-by-com
mittee, which reduces workload on a
single player by divvying up the
blown saves to several middle reliev
ers/setup men. But for the moment,
just imagine a closer-Antonio "Shifty
six-finger" Alfonseca, say) Anyway,
"Of Shifty" stares off the mound at
Jason Giambi at the plate, bathing as
the series hangs in the balance. But
hold on just a second-time fora quiz.
While this very at-bat is happening,
YOU are:
A) Hoping fora Yankees victory.
B) Hoping fora Red Sox victory.
G) Reading about trivial, non base
ball-related things like "political sci

ence." (Let's see how much this helps
you when you're staring down the
barrel of a 101-mph fastball in beau
tiful, spacious Comerica Park in the
heart of downtown Detroit, you ig
norant s<x:ial scientist, you.)
I)) Watching the game and swearing
constantly under your breath —
which may or may not reek of the
cheap scotch you've been belting
since the Tigers were mathematically
eliminated from playoff contention.
Hie [x>int of this quiz? Baseball,
like all sports, is a matter of perspec
tive. I lere at Stanford, there are a lot
of CWants and A's fans due to the prox
imity of our university to these teams'
home stadiums. In addition, you have
your Yankees fans, your Red Sox fans,
your I>xlgers fans and even your
(sympathetic sigh) Mets fans.
But these are all "big-market"
teams with fairly large national fal
lowings. How many people, howev
er, do you see sporting a new Garl
Crawford-model Devil Rays replica
jersey in I-Hum section? Or Rocco
Baldelli, Aubrey Huff or Victor Zam
brano, for that matter? Would it mat

ter if I told you that Zambrano has
more home runs so far this season
than Sammy Sosa and Giambi com
bined? Well, he doesn't; he's actually
a starting pitcher. But I gave you
pause, because you probably
wouldn't know Zambrano from a
small duck that walked up and uri
nated on your ftxit.
The point is, what we really lack
here at Stanford is diversity. That's
right, Robin Mamlet — start
squirming. The Office of Admis
sions loves to proclaim that each
year's admitted class is "the most di
verse ever", but if this is so, then how
come I can't subscribe to "Garlos-
Delgadochat@lists.stanford.edu?"
Where is the diversity among our
sports fans?
Let's get some variety, people.
R(X)ting for your hometown profes
sional sports teams is the perfect way
to present some regional pride.
You don't see enough I winkie
shirts and baseball caps swimming
through the sea of bikers at the clock
tower on your average weekday
morning — and it makes me sad, the

kind of hollow cold you read about in
g(x)d literature but can only em
pathize with after sitting through
three hours of rain delays before a
Toledo Mud Hens playoff game only
to find out that your teams ace has
been recently called up to "the show"
on the first day of t he playoffs.
So I guess this is a call for sports
fens all around campus to "sac up"
and show your colors. Since this cam
pus is the location for the Martin
Luther King, Jr. papers project, I
proclaim that "I have a dream." It is
a dream that one day I will show up
for lecture and, I will come face to
face with a a Jeremy Bonderman jer
sey being worn proudly by my pro
fessor, a closet Tigers fan. Is this t<x>
much to hope for?
So swallow your pride, get out
that old Pittsburgh Pirate flag from
the Bonds/Ron ilia era, and hang it
out your dorm window. A campus of
sports fans is counting on you.
