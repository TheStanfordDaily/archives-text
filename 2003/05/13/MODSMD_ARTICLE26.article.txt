# Not to be like Mike
## 
### 
You know it's a bad econ
omy when Michael Jor
dan gets downsized. Jor
dan was recently fired
from his front office position by the
Washington Wizards and owners
Abe Pollin and Ted Leonsis.
Even I have to feel just a little bit
sorry for Jordan in this case. He
single-handedly made one of the
most abominable franchises of the
last decade and a half into the
league's top road draw. The Wiz
ards sold out in every single venue
in which they played, as fans clam
ored to get a last glimpse of the six
time champion before he went into
retirement. Again.
Other teams even began offering
special ticket packages to include
the Wizards among their big draw
games, alongside teams such as the
leakers, Kings and Mavericks.
Last year, NBC even went so far
as to alter their Sunday television
basketball lineup to give fans the
opportunity to see his Airness suit
up for Washington. Jordan's pres
ence brought in an estimated $30
million to the Wizards coffers this
year alone, and that is only a frac
tion of what his return did for the
league as a whole. The chances of
any of this happening without Jor
dan in the lineup were slightly bet
ter than John Ashcroft becoming
head of the ACLU, but not nearly
as good as Ashcroft burning down
ACLU headquarters and spitting
on the ashes.
So as his final coming out of re
tirement stint has now come to a
close, it's clear that Jordan got
straight up used. But how bad
should we really feel for the guy?
In many senses, he brought all of
this upon himself.
First of all, he had the opportu
nity to finish his playing career in
remarkable fashion. He could
have chosen to let the sweet
rhythm of his clutch jumpshot that
sealed the 1999 NBA Finals serve
as the ultimate sporting swansong.
He could have chosen to let his sec
ond run of three straight titles be
his last. Instead, he chose Wash
ington. He chose wrong. So wrong
that crack addicts have better sense
of when to say enough is enough.
Secondly, he was a lousy Presi
dent of Basketball Operations/Per
sonnel Manager. In his tenure, he
managed to trade away Juwan
Howard, Richard Hamilton and
Courtney Alexander, who all went
to be productive members of play
off teams. And while there are
probably few fans in Washington
mourning these losses, there are
even fewer celebrating their re
placements â€” Jerry Stackhouse,
Christian Laettner, Hughes.
Jordan even managed to squander
the No. 1 overall pick on high

school phenom Kwame Brown,
whose development in the past
two years resembles that of the
North Korean free market econo
my. Though I really shouldn't in
sult the North Korean economy
like that.
Even with Jordan in the lineup,
this roster wasn't strong enough to
finish in the top eight in the weak
Eastern Conference. Even the tal
ent-deficient Knicks managed to
match Washington in the standings.
With Jordan's third retirement
and a low likelihood of a high draft

pick, the future of
Capital City is
eerily following a
doomsday trajec
tory, that of the
"12 Monkeys" va
riety, rather than
the fun and effi
cient Jetsons-style
future. Except the

Wizards won't have Brad Pitt or a
horrible disease to wipe out the fu
ture of man (here's hoping that
SARS doesn't make me a liar).
I mean, Kwame Brown is bad
and all, but he's not "contaminate
the-population-of-the-earth-thus-
forcing-humankind-to-live-in-the
sewers" bad.
And finally, do you know how
much money Michael Jordan has?
It's not as if this guy is living pay
check to paycheck. Somehow, 1
think Mikey's going to be OK living
off of the endorsement money he
gets from Nike, Gatorade, Hanes,
Wheaties, McDonald's, Warner
Bros., Rayovac batteries, Oakley
Sunglasses and pretty much any
other company that makes goods
which can be exchanged for cash.
And that's not to mention his cloth
ing line, cologne, restaurants and
businesses he owns.
There are so many products
bearing his likeness that econo
mists sometimes to refer to them
collectively as the Jordan industry.
If there were a comparable Ryan
Stewart industry, it would be limit
ed to my pitching wedge, my 1992
Honda and that DVD that my
friend borrowed and still hasn't re
turned to me.
And to conclude my Jordan
bashing, I leave you with Jordan's
famous phrase made to justify his
refusal to endorse the Democratic
opponent of bigoted North Caroli
na Senator Jesse 1 lelms: "Republi
cans buy shoes too." I think I'll re
serve my tears for the next guy
who gets a raw deal.
