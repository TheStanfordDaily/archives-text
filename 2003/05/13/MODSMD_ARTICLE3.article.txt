# Schultz talks on war, reconstructing Iraq
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN STAFF WRITER 
The Daily sat down with
Hoover Fellow George P. Shultz
last week to discuss current issues
in Iraq as well as U.S. foreign poli
cy. Shultz spoke from his experi
ence as secretary of state and his
time with Bechtel Group, where
he is currently a board member.
Bechtel Group has been awarded
a contract worth up to $680 mil
lion over the next 18 months to aid
in the reconstruction of Iraq.
In the 61 years since graduat
ing from Princeton with a degree
in economics, Shultz has amassed
a resume spanning successful ca
reers in academia, business and
government. Secretary of state
under President Ronald Reagan

from 1982-1989 and president
and director of Bechtel Group
from 1974-1982, Shultz holds
honorary degrees from 17 univer
sities and won the nation's highest
civilian honor, the Medal of Free
dom, in 1989.
Before becoming president of
Bechtel Group, Shultz was dean of
the University of Chicago's Grad
uate School of Business and secre
tary of labor and secretary of the
Treasury under President
Richard Nixon. He is now the
Thomas W. and Susan B. Ford
distinguished fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
Current Deputy Secretary of
State Paul Wolfowitz said last May
that "George Shultz has made

more than his share of history,
guided by wisdom, unshakable in
tegrity, vision and a great ability to
read people and judge character.
His legacy to our nation will be
measured in lives saved, prosperi
ty achieved, alliances forged and
peace secured."
Shultz has been a strong sup
porter of the war in Iraq and of a
more aggressively preventative
U.S. foreign policy, arguing that
strong measures are necessary to
safeguard U.S. interests at home
and abroad. The interview
touched on the topics of Iraq,
Afghanistan, the Hoover Institu
tion, Bechtel Group and the direc
tion of U.S. foreign policy.
The Daily: What are your senti
ments about the war in Iraq?
George Shultz: No one likes to
have a war, but I think this war is
made necessary to prevent Iraq
from supplying terrorists with
weapons that could do us great
damage. We had around 11 years
of effort through the United Na
tions Security Council to produce
that result and it became fruitless,
particularly after the French made
it clear they would not authorize
the Security Council [to use] any
force.
TD: No weapons of mass destruc
tion have yet been found in Iraq.
W r as this a failed premise of the
war?
GS: It seems to me pretty clear that
they have weapons of mass de
struction in Iraq and we now have
an opportunity to find them.
They're probably in deep caves or
caverns . . . and we'll find them.
TD: What's the general process
that a firm like Bechtel goes
through to get a contract to rebuild
Iraq?
GS: In this case, as I understand it,
the agency for international devel
opment, USAID, saw that it was
going to be responsible for re
building a lot of the Iraqi infra
structure. Fora broad assessment
of infrastructure problems and the
start of doing something about
them, they identified [some] firms
who they thought were competent
to do that, and they invited those
firms to make a proposal. And so
Bechtel was invited to do that,
and . . . was selected as best suited.
TD: Do you buy into criticism that
companies that were given con
tracts in Iraq were unfairly U.S.-
based and that those that were
chosen had close ties to the Bush
administration?
GS: No, I don't buy that at all. First
of all, in the legislation, the USAID
is required to select U.S. firms;
that's the law. Now as far as Bech
tel is concerned, we are not under
restrictions to select only U.S.

firms. I know of two U.K. firms
that have already been selected to
do certain things, and Bechtel will
look hard particularly within Iraq
[for foreign firms to subcontract].
We will try to get as much work
done by Iraqis for Iraq as we can,
so the outcome will be internation
al but it will be supervised by Bech
tel.
TD: As you said, USAID is only al
lowed to give contracts to Ameri
can companies. Do you think it
would have been fairer to allow the
inclusion of international firms in
the awarding of the initial con
tracts?
GS: Don't forget that this is U.S.
taxpayer money we're talking
about that is being spent on recon
struction. There will come a time
when things get up and running
when presumably there is Iraqi
money or when some other coun
try wants to collect money.
TD: In recent weeks and months
there have been a couple of stu
dent organizations that have start
ed speaking out against the
Hoover Institution because they
claim it is a politically conservative
think-tank. Has it been hard at
times to reconcile the fact that you
work and do research in a politi
cally-oriented organization that is
afFiliated with a broader academic
institution that does not really es
pouse any particular political
ideals?
GS: Well, Hoover as such doesn't
have a point of view about
things — individuals do. I think
it's a good thing for the Stanford
campus because we believe in di
versity, don't we? Everybody
shouldn't think left-wing - there
should be some argument. I mean,
after all, the country has voted
more in-line with the kind of
thinking that we see at least in the
many Hoover scholars, and so it's
not a bad thing for students to be
exposed to that.
TD: But overall is it a more conser
vative-minded think tank than the
general mood of the institution?
GS: Well, yes, 1 suppose you could
say that, but it depends on what
you mean. Do you mean advocacy
of freedom? Is that conservative?
Advocacy of the use of freedom in
markets and in politics, advocacy
of being strong militarily, advocacy
of open trading systems, advocacy
of improved education in K
through 12 settings, particularly
where the income per capita area
is low and where we know the edu
cation is poor. Now is that a con
servative ideal? I think it's com
mon sense, myself.
TD: Were there indications at the
end of your term as secretary of
state that led you to believe that the
first confrontation with Iraq was
going to happen in the near fu
ture?
GS: Not particularly, although you
could see that Saddam Hussein

was capable of the use of weapons
of mass destruction. In this case,
against his own people, he used
gas against the Kurds. And we de
nounced that when I was in office.
He [also] used gas against the Ira
nians. We did make a major effort,
with some success, to get the Iran-
Iraq war stopped, largely because
of the humanitarian dimension of
it. Probably a million to a million
and a half people were killed dur
ing the war. So we thought that,
while we had no particular friend
ship with either side, it was a blot
on the humanitarian conscience of
the world.
TD: Do you think that the U.S. has
given up a lot of international pres
tige in pursuing this war against
Saddam Hussein?
GS: I think we've gained . . . be
cause we've shown that we mean
what we say [and] the credibility is
high. We have taken on a tyrant,
[and] cleared everybody of the re
ally awful pattern of government
[in Iraq]. Of course we have a
major challenge in seeing if there
can be put together a system of
government in Iraq that's reason
ably representative and which re
spects the rights of the various
groupings in Iraq.
TD: How would you characterize
the success of rebuilding the gov
ernment in Afghanistan after the
United States went in there, and
do you think there are any partic
ular lessons from that process that
the administration should apply
now in Iraq?
GS: They're very different, and I
suppose the only lesson is that it's
hard, so you have to be ready to
stick at it fora while. But the dif
ferences between Afghanistan and
Iraq are huge. Afghanistan is a
very tribal country . .. and it has
no natural wealth. So, you have to
have a pattern of governance that
is loose, I would say. I think the
process has been rather impres
sive, and it's been prompt in
putting a person, an Afghan, back
in charge. Their economy is very
degraded, so you have to work on
that and that's a hard thing to do.
Iraq has a different situation —
it has immense resources and it
has, I think, a relatively big core of
people who are professionally
trained. And so you have a lot to
work with in terms of human capi
tal, you have natural wealth, and of
course you have these major divi
sions that are stemming from the
Shiites, the Kurds and others. And
so that means you have to take that
into account as you arrange an in
stitutional system so that you can't
have an outcome that causes the
country to be dominated forever
by one of those groups.
TD: Do you think that the U.S. has
shifted toward a more preventa
tive foreign policy since your term
as secretary of state?
GS: We have become very conscious
of the problem of terrorism. I

worked on it hard when I was secre
tary of state, but the American peo
ple were not as concerned about it.
We also see by the scale of 9 /11 that
if you contemplate a terrorist attack
using biological weapons or chemi
cal weapons, or nuclear weapons or
even other kinds of weapons, that
you could have damage of huge
proportions. Then you have to say
to yourself,
"The object has to be to prevent
that" There was a time when peo
ple said the right approach is what
they call a law enforcement ap
proach — you wait for something to
happen and then you find the per
son that did it, you try that person
and you put them in jail.
That's not a satisfactory way to go
about countering a threat that could
cause huge amounts of damage. So
your policies now are geared very
much toward prevention.
TD: Do you think that this more
aggressive and more active pre
vention will create further anti-
American sentiment and a greater
risk of terrorism, especially in Mid
dle Eastern countries?
GS: There may be some. On the
other hand, if we sit back as a coun
try and allow ourselves to be wiped
out, I don't think people respect
that very much either. I think it's
the other way around. I think that
a willingness to sit back and let it
happen, which is what we've done
over the last 25 years, only encour
ages terrorists to believe they can
get away with anything. And if they
find out that what happens to
them is they get caught before they
can do anything, they're frustrat
ed. And if states find out that when
they harbor terrorists and supply
them with weaponry they're going
to pay a price for that, and that we
have a capacity to know what's
going on and a capacity to do
something about it, and we have
allies who are with us in that re
gard, then I think that will dimin
ish the problem of terrorism. In
fact I don't think any other way
could get at them better than to be
aggressive and to be preventive in
your outlook.
TD: Do you think in retrospect
there's anything the U.S. could
have done better in its foreign pol
icy 30-40 years ago that would
have helped avoid the current
problems with terrorism?
GS: I don't think you should think
of terrorism as something that can
be stopped by addressing whatev
er cause it is that some terrorists
say they are worried about and say,
"It's my fault because I didn't do
something about that." Everybody
has grievances; there are griev
ances all over the place. And you
can't say that that is a reason to en
gage in terrorism. You have to say
terrorism is a tactic — a weapon —
that we're ruling out. It's not a le
gitimate form of expression. Obvi
ously there are problems around
the world, and there isn't any
doubt at all that the country that
has done the most about that is the
United States, by far.
