# Union wins favorable Tresidder offer
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
University Residential and Dining Services
has announced that all workers now employed
by Bon Appetit at Tresidder Union will be given
preference in re-hiring when Stanford Dining
assumes control of the facilities on June 18 and
begins implementing plans for improving avail
able food service options.
The decision comes after two weeks of meet
ings between University Human Resources and
Dining Services, SKIU Local 715 representatives
and union stewards concerning the future of
Bon Appetit workers at Tresidder.
Current workers will receive preference for
jobs created when Dining Services and associat
ed vendors open for business next fall. Stanford
Dining employees will also be eligible to apply for
these jobs.
While current staffing levels have not yet been
determined, if there are too many ex-Bon Ap

petit employees for the positions that will be
available, those that are not immediately re-em
ployed will receive preference for other Dining
Services jobs that open up within the next year.
"I think we have a very good team working to
gether," said Nadeem Siddiqui, the executive di
rector for University Dining Services. "Last Fri
day, we came to a resolution that takes care of
Tresidder employees."
Union representatives were pleased with
Stanford Dining's response to student and work
er efforts for the retention of the employees.
"What is most notable about this is the move
ment that the University made," said union rep
resentative Roxana Rivera. "It was definitely
great movement in regard to giving preference
for Bon Appetit employees in the re-application
process."
When negotiations first began, the University
was considering having a strictly open applica
tion process, in which current employees would
not be given priority based on previous work ex

perience at Tresidder.
During the last weeks, Bon Appetit workers
and students of the Stanford I .abor Action Coali
tion and Coalition for Labor Justice collected
around 800 signatures online from students and
at 'Tresidder from customers supporting a deci
sion on the part of the University to give these
workers preference.
"We're really glad that the University and
Dining Services responded to the outpouring of
community concern, and we're glad that they've
taken leadership in respecting workers and their
years of service," said junior Sofia Lee, a SLAC
representative." But a code of conduct would re
solve issues like this for all Stanford workers."
On May 23, an open meeting will be held by
the union and the University to discuss the
changes with the Tresidder employees.
"The point that is so important to me is that
we can do what we do honestly and fairly — I
don't know any other way," Siddiqui said. "We
want to be the role model for the nation."
