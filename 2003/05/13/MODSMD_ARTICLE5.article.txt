# Survey indicates high freshman satisfaction
## I-Hum, advising rated lowest; Asian Americans least satisfied ethnic group 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
According to the recently re
leased results of a comprehensive
survey completed by almost half of
last year's freshman class, most stu
dents are very satisfied with the
freshman experience. The survey
asked questions on nearly all as
pects of student life, including res
idential life, academics, campus
environment and personal growth
and satisfaction.
Residences and the University
environment rated especially
high, while how much the Uni
versity valued each student as a
person rated relatively low. The
survey showed that a sizeable mi
nority of students are dissatisfied
with the Introduction to the Hu
manities Program and freshman
advising.
The survey also reported sub
stantial variance in the quality of
the freshman experience for stu
dents of different races, with
Latino / a students especially
pleased with Stanford and
Asian-American students the
least satisfied.
Conducted for Dean of Fresh

man and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims, the survey was
online from Oct. 31 to Nov. 18 in
2002 and roughly 49 percent of
the current sophomore class re
sponded.
Overall satisfaction was high,
with 64 percent of respondents
"very satisfied" with their fresh
man year as a whole and 6 percent
"dissatisfied."
Most administrators said they
were not surprised by the results.
"It was along the lines of things
we probably knew in our minds
would be true," said University
President John Hennessy.
However, many administrators
highlighted such issues as fewer stu
dents knowing a faculty member
than desired, and others considered
low satisfaction with presentation
skills, advising and staff responsive
ness to be somewhat interesting or
surprising.
Members of the sophomore
class answered questions based
only on the freshman year, not
their experience since then.
Seven hundred seventy-nine stu
dents responded, giving the re
sults a confidence interval of 95
percent and a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.5 percent.
Ihe survey's creator, Jerold
Pearson, the director of market re
search for the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, also wrote the report.
Much of the report was presented to
focus on the students who were "very sat
isfied," which included ratings of 6 or 7 on
a seven-point scale — 7 being very satis
fied and 1 being very dissatisfied — com
pared to students who were "dissatisfied,"
which included ratings of 1, 2 or 3.
Results were constructed this way to
emphasize the differences between those
areas that students were very satisfied with
and those that students were only some
what satisfied with or neutral toward. Also,
Pearson explained that if ss, "somewhat
satisfied," were included with 6s and 7s,
satisfaction would be extremely high and
the results would be less meaningful.
"What one would certainly expect at a
place like Stanford is that there's very little
dissatisfaction with anything— a lot of stu
dents are in the middle," Pearson said. "I
think these numbers are very respectable,
but one would think there's some room for
improvement."
He added, "A place like Stanford,
which demands excellence of their stu
dents, should be concerned with those
who are very satisfied."
Creating a survey to define the role of a
new office
Lythcott-Haims said that the survey
was one of her first major actions in her
new position.
"I was a freshman here back in 1985,
but 1 wouldn't presume that my experi
ence mirrors that of students today," she
said. "Consequently I have spent a great
deal of time in this first year on the job try

my experience mirrors that of students today. Consequently I
have spent a great deal of time in this first year on the job trying
to learn what the freshmen experience is."

ing to learn what the freshman experience
is. For starters, I turned to the experts on
what the freshman experience actually
is — the Class of 2005 — whose freshman
experience had just come to a close."
Lythcott-Haims and Pearson began
working on the survey questions in Au
gust, at which point Lythcott-Haims also
sought input from the offices of the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education and
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
"The study was designed to see how we
can make the freshman year better — how
satisfied are students to also see what dri
ves satisfaction to see how we might im
prove it," Pearson said.
The data was at least partially compiled
by Feb. iO when Lythcott-Haims present
ed a report to the Board of Trustees, but
the actual report went through numerous
drafts before being released.
"Obviously, Julie wanted to digest it
and deal with it internally before she re
leased it to the public," Pearson said.
In order to further investigate fresh
man issues, Lythcott-Haims has formed
an Advisory Group on the Freshman Ex
perience, composed of roughly 60 faculty
members, staff and students. Their first
meeting is tomorrow. The survey results
will be given to them in order to direct
their discussion. Both the survey and the
advisory group are part of Lythcott-
Haims' efforts to shape her new role.
Increasing students' sense of value:
'We will provide a helping hand'
According to the report accompanying
the survey results, the extent to which stu
dents feel valued as a person has the great
est impact on how they feel about their
overall freshman experience.
Lythcott-Haims said that increasing
students' feelings of worth within the Uni
versity is a major issue for her new role,
and that she plans to use the findings of

the survey to help set the agenda for the
new Office of Freshman and Transfer Stu
dents.
"Interestingly, I took this on as a man
date for my office even before seeing the
survey results, as we had intuited that it
was an important area of focus," she said.
"Our office plays a critical role in shaping
the first impression a student and his or
her parents have of Stanford."
She noted that valuing someone as a

there's very little dissatisfaction with anything — a lot of students
are in the middle. I think these numbers are very respectable, but

person is difficult to define, so she aims to
use a variety of approaches.
"We tackle it in a number of ways, from
being very responsive to concerns, to hav
ing warm and meaningful person-to-per
son interactions, to taking an interest in
each individual and his or her situation,"
she said.
In terms of the "valued as a person" rat
ings, students were most dissatisfied with
staff care and responsiveness.
Another major finding was that 64 per
cent of respondents would definitely
choose Stanford again and 29 percent
would probably choose Stanford again.
Forty-six percent said Stanford exceeded
their expectations, and 35 percent said it
met their expectations.
New Student Orientation also received

relatively high marks, with 78 percent rat
ing it good or excellent overall, although
only 17 percent rated it excellent. High
ratings on Orientation also correlated with
high ratings of overall experience — 86
percent of students who rate Orientation
as excellent are very satisfied with their
freshman year. However, only 63 percent
of those who rate Orientation as simply
"good" are very satisfied with their fresh
man year and 45 percent of those who rate
it fair or poor are very satisfied.
Lythcott-Haims noted that she aims to
improve New Student Orientation further

In terms of overall experience, 68 percent of Latino respondents
and 69 percent of white respondents described themselves as
"very satisfiedwhile 58 percent of African-American respon
dents and 55 percent of Asian-American respondents put them
selves in this category.

by focusing on enthusiastic Orientation
volunteers and giving more attention to
transfer arrival.
"What we got out of the survey is that
the better we do with NSO, the better a
student feels about his or her whole fresh
man year," she said.
Other results indicated that 25 percent
of students thought Stanford didn't pro
vide enough direction, with 58 percent
thinking it struck a good balance between
direction and independence.
Lythcott-Haims hopes to address this
with the philosophy she stated at this Sep
tember's Orientation: "We won't hold
your hand, but we will provide a helping
hand when you need it."
"We want to help freshmen better nav
igate their way through Stanford," she
said. "When they are unsure where to go

for help, we can point them in the right di
rection."
Satisfaction with Introduction to the
Humanities
An earlier draft of the report included
results of a series of questions regarding
the I-Hum program. These results were
later removed from the freshman survey
and moved into an appendix of the I-
Hum self-study that was being conducted

fora report to the Faculty Senate. In the
earlier draft, I-Hum was the area of the
freshman experience with which students
expressed the most dissatisfaction.
The I-Hum data in the draft survey re
port showed that 32 percent of students
were "dissatisfied" with I-Hum and gave it
a rating of 1, 2or 3, while 25 percent were
"very satisfied" and rated it a 6 or 7.
These ratings would have placed I-
Hum at the lowest end of the aspects of the
freshmen experience that were measured.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman explained that he
thought the report on the freshman expe
rience was not the appropriate place for
the I-Hum results as it included no other
in-depth questions about academics.
Lythcott-Haims said that she had sent
Bravman an e-mail on Aug. 14, 2002 ask
ing if he wanted her to include any further
academic questions, but received no re
sponse. The survey included broad ques
tions on academic matters including the
general rigor of courses, quality of classes
and advising.
Bravman said that the ratings were re
arranged in the appendix of the I-Hum
self-study, grouping 1 through 3 as "dis
satisfied," 4 as "neutral" and 5 through 7
as "satisfied" to display the results more
symmetrically. This time, the analysis
showed that 48 percent of respondents
were "satisfied" with I-Hum and, accord
ing to the I-Hum self-study, 31 percent of
respondents were "dissatisfied."
Discrepancies in satisfaction among
ethnic groups
An additional significant finding was
that Asian-American students were least
satisfied with their freshman year, while
Latino / a students were most satisfied.
In terms of overall experience, 68 per
cent of Latino respondents and 69 percent
of white respondents described them

selves as "very satisfied," while 58 percent
of African-American respondents and 55
percent of Asian-American respondents
put themselves in this category. Within the
subcategories of satisfaction with resi
dences, personal and intellectual growth
and academics, Latino students were con
sistently the most likely to rate themselves
as "very satisfied." The percentage of re
spondents considering themselves "very
satisfied" in each of these categories was at
least 10 points lower for Asian-American
students than for Latino and white stu
dents.
"Interestingly, we have seen similarly
disparate results when Asian alumni and
Asian parents are surveyed," Lythcott-
Haims said. "So we are now trying to dis
cern whether Asian-Americans truly are
less satisfied with their experiences at
Stanford and why that may be, or whether
they simply are more conservative when
reporting their feelings."
Assistant Dean Jan Barker-Alexander,
director of the Black Community Services
Center, explained that she feels that the
numbers are not the fault of the Asian
American Activities Center.
"My colleagues in the A3C are doing an
excellent job, and these numbers are not
indicative of the level of quality of pro
gramming out of the A3C — they're in
dicative of the complexity of the Asian-
American population," she said.
African-American students were shown
to be most satisfied with their community
centers, which Barker-Alexander ex
plained as resulting from the Partners for
Academic Excellence advising program,
which originated in the black community,
and the '00 chants that started with the
Class of 2000 in the black community.
Seventy percent of African-American
students said they were "very satisfied" with
the community centers; white students
showed the next highest degree of satisfac

tion, with 53 percent "very satisfied."
As far as the high level of Latino satis
faction, Assistant Dean M. Frances
Morales, director of El Centro Chicano,
noted outreach efforts.
"1 know we do our best job in terms of
reaching out to the incoming students
during Stanford Admit Weekend and
then also during the welcome events in
September," she said. "VVe do as much
outreach as we can to the freshmen com

munity.
African-American students were also
shown to be the least likely to take an in
troductory seminar. While between 62
and 64 percent of white, Latino and Asian-
American students had taken a freshman
seminar, only 39 percent of African-Amer
ican students had.
Sharon Palmer, director of Freshman
and Sophomore Programs, noted that the
difference was smaller, but still present in
her statistical analysis of introductory
seminar enrollment data.
"Hie African-American population is the
one where there is a slight discrepancy [ fr< >m
the general population]," she said. "We have
not found, however, the difference to be as
great as that seen in the survey."
Palmer said that she will continue to
speak at community centers and dormito
ries to encourage applications to introduc
tory seminars, but hasn't devised specific
plans to deal with the African-American
enrollment issue.
Success at academic growth,
questions about advising
As far as how Stanford helped with
"personal and intellectual growth," stu
dents rated highly its role in helping them

understand people and understand them
selves. They rated its help with presenta
tion skills lower, with 20 percent "dissatis
fied" as compared to 29 percent "very sat
isfied."
Bravman noted that these results are
corroborated by reports from graduate
schools.
"We've heard from graduate schools
that we've got these bright students who
don't know how to present," he said.

To address this issue, a new two-quar
ter Program in Writing and Rhetoric cur
riculum will be implemented next year.
"Everyone will be required to take two
classes," Bravman said. "The second quar
ter speaks particularly to research data
and results."
In terms of academics, dissatisfaction
was relatively high with peer academic ad
visers; 36 percent of respondents were
"dissatisfied" compared to 35 percent who
were "very satisfied." With academic ad
visers, 39 percent of students were "dissat
isfied" while 31 percent "very satisfied."
Student opinion on faculty involve
ment outside class was also relatively neg
ative, with 31 percent of students "dissatis
fied" and only 23 percent "very satisfied."
Bravman said that advising often re
ceives criticism which varies in its legitimacy.
"Advising is akin to dorm food in that
it's an easy target for complaint," Bravman
said.
I Ie did said that the University is trying
to find a faculty director for advising to
complement the current staff director of
advising.
"I felt we needed that level of faculty en
gagement at the top of advising," Brav
man said.
