# Survey indicates high freshman satisfaction
## I-Hum, advising rated lowest; Asian Americans least satisfied ethnic group 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
According to the recently re
leased results of a comprehensive
survey completed by almost half of
last year's freshman class, most stu
dents are very satisfied with the
freshman experience. The survey
asked questions on nearly all as
pects of student life, including res
idential life, academics, campus
environment and personal growth
and satisfaction.
Residences and the University
environment rated especially
high, while how much the Uni
versity valued each student as a
person rated relatively low. The
survey showed that a sizeable mi
nority of students are dissatisfied
with the Introduction to the Hu
manities Program and freshman
advising.
The survey also reported sub
stantial variance in the quality of
the freshman experience for stu
dents of different races, with
Latino / a students especially
pleased with Stanford and
Asian-American students the
least satisfied.
Conducted for Dean of Fresh

man and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims, the survey was
online from Oct. 31 to Nov. 18 in
2002 and roughly 49 percent of
the current sophomore class re
sponded.
Overall satisfaction was high,
with 64 percent of respondents
"very satisfied" with their fresh
man year as a whole and 6 percent
"dissatisfied."
Most administrators said they
were not surprised by the results.
"It was along the lines of things
we probably knew in our minds
would be true," said University
President John Hennessy.
However, many administrators
highlighted such issues as fewer stu
dents knowing a faculty member
than desired, and others considered
low satisfaction with presentation
skills, advising and staff responsive
ness to be somewhat interesting or
surprising.
Members of the sophomore
class answered questions based
only on the freshman year, not
their experience since then.
Seven hundred seventy-nine stu
dents responded, giving the re
sults a confidence interval of 95
percent and a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.5 percent.
Ihe survey's creator, Jerold
Pearson, the director of market re
search for the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, also wrote the report.
