# Human rights activist speaks on North Korea
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stories of rape by soldiers, dis
embowelments in prisons and
kangaroo courts have leaked from
the well-guarded confines of
North Korea for years. These and
other issues will be addressed dur
ing North Korean Human Rights
Week, which began last night with
a speech by activist Doug Shin.
A pastor for the past eight
years, Shin has spent six of those
years working on North Korean
human rights issues, helping

refugees to places of haven.
"In October of 1997 I went to
North Korea for the first time to
deliver some food," Shin said, "be
cause back then there was a great
famine going on."
Though he was optimistic at
first, Shin said disillusionment
quickly set in.
"I was fooled by the Worker's
Party because they had told me I
would be in charge of distributing
the food stuff." Instead, he got
only a receipt upon delivery of the
food. Angry and frustrated, Shin
showed his contempt by disobey
ing rules and handing out money
to North Koreans.
The money had to be wrapped
in candy so that the Koreans
would not be seen accepting
money.
"It's treason to accept money
from foreigners," Shin said.
On his second visit, Shin was ar
rested by the government for en
gaging in the same activity. He
barely escaped imprisonment.
"I will never go back," Shin
said.
Since then, he has worked to al
leviate the plight of North Korean
refugees from outside the coun
try, helping to set up escape routes
from the country.
"[The goal of the refugees] is
called the Korean dream," Shin
said. "There are more dreams in
the world than just American
dreams."
Most refugees follow pre-estab
lished routes, such as the one that
travels through Laos and on to
Thailand.
"I am known as one of the first
builders of the Mongolian route,"
said Shin, referring to a recently
created underground railroad
that delivers refugees to South
Korea via Mongolia.
"It's about 75 percent com
plete," he added. "The capacity,
to begin with, will be about 300
North Korean refugees."
Shin framed the issue of
human rights abuses in North
Korea by noting some of the atroc
ities reported by its citizens.
"When there is a public execu
tion, there is a pool of blood and
inmates are lined up to dip their
hands in the pool of blood to make
sure they were there," he said.
Brainwashing, he argued, was
a human rights abuse in itself.
"Over the past five decades [the
North Korean people] have devel
oped a counterfeit Christianity,"
he said. The holy trinity of this

Christianity, Shin said, is made up
of Kim II Sung, the former leader
of North Korea, Kim Jong 11, his
son and current leader, and their
philosophy.
"[Kim's] a demigod," Shin said.
"He's the god that bestows upon
you the food. That's how people
die of starvation â€” the public sys
tem of distribution.
"That's the ultimate human
rights abuse."
Aside from increasing the reach
of Radio Free Asia, Shin had few
solutions for the problem.
"When this regime has col
lapsed, perhaps even a worse mon
ster will be born out of the chaos,"
he said. "We have witnessed this
recently with Iraq. My mission is to
bring about the opening and
change without bloodshed."
North Korean Human Rights
week is sponsored by a diverse
group of organizations including
Korean American Students Asso
ciation, Stanford Hwimori and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
"Our mission is twofold: to cre
ate awareness and a space for re
sponse," said Sarah Ihn, one of
the week's organizers. Ihn also
framed the week as a reaction to
what some perceived as silence on
the topic of human rights abuses
on the peninsula.
"The Daily had gotten com
ments from the College Republi
cans and Stanford Community
for Peace and Justice, but neither
group really showed any interest
or expertise on human rights in
North Korea," Ihn said. "[We]
decided that we needed to start
something up collectively since
mainstream campus groups were
not interested in the human
rights situation at all."
The week continues today with
a documentary viewing at 8 p.m.
and concludes on Friday with a
Stanford Hwimori benefit con
cert. On Thursday, there will be
an informal discussion, entitled
"Rights and Ramen," with anoth
er activist.
"It's the good stuff," Ihn said of
the ramen that will be served. "It's
not the 25-cent Maruchan cup of
noodles. It's the Korean kind."
