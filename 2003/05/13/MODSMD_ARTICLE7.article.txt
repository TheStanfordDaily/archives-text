# Faculty join science academy
## Stanford faculty in the National Academy of Sciences rises to 133 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seven Stanford faculty members were
elected late last month to the National Acad
emy of Science, bringing the total of number
of Stanford faculty members in the academy
to 133. Being elected the academy is consid
ered to be one of the highest honors for sci
entists and engineers.
Stanford's Psychology Prof. Brian Wan
dell, who studies brain development and
the visual pathways necessary for reading,
was one of the seven new members.
"Of course it was an honor," Wandell said
of his election. "The award offered me the
opportunity to remember how much I have
enjoyed working with my students and col
laborators. At this moment I am keenly
aware that this honor is not to an individual
but to a group of peo pie."

Chemistry Prof. Paul A. Wender agreed
that many people had been a part of making
his research so successful. Wender designs
molecules and molecular transporters used
to help treat diseases like breast and ovarian
cancer.
"This is obviously both a special honor
and a special responsibility," Wender said of
his new membership. "Ii is also a most posi
tive reflection on our students, colleagues,
(acuity, staff, administrators and institution
al vision."
The other honored Stanford researchers
include Mathematics Prof. Yakov Kliash
berg, Anthropological Sciences Prof.
Richard Klein, Materials Science and Engi
neering Prof. William Nix, Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele and I lelen Quinn, assistant to
the director for education and public out
reach at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. The Stanford faculty members will
be joined by medical and geological re
searchers as well as professors from institu
tions such as Vale and MIT.
