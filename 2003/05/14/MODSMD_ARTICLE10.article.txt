Stanford Student Enterprises launched its
fourth annual Stock Market Challenge compe
tition on May 5. The competition, which runs
until June 4, was created as an interactive and
entertaining way for participants to learn about
the stock market.
The contest takes place online at the Virtual
Stock Exchange Web site. Each participant is
given a $100,000 virtual portfolio to invest in a
variety of stocks. Co-sponsored by CNBC,
Blockbuster, Circuit City and Handspring,
among others, the contest will award prizes to
those who demonstrate the best investment
performance.
Junior Jason Lee sees the challenge as "a
chance to see if I can beat the market, have
some fun, test my market intuition and maybe
make some real cash as a bonus."

Prizes to be awarded are varied and include
gift certificates to the Stanford Store, tickets to
CNBC investing seminars and cash prizes.
Each week prizes will be awarded to partici
pants whose portfolios had the greatest return
the previous week. Additionally, the top five
winners at the end of the competition will re
ceive cash prizes with a first prize of $200, sec
ond and third prizes of $ 100 and fourth and
fifth prizes of $50.
"The competition has been very successful in
the past," explained senior Ben Carlson. "Last
year, the competition drew just over 300 par
ticipants."
Carlson, the investments director of SSE and
the person heading the Challenge, said that
150 participants have entered the contest thus
far, and the competition is still open to interest
ed students.
Freshman Tim Chen currently has the
best performing portfolio with a total return

of 40.74 percent. He was awarded a $50 gift
certificate to Left at Albuquerque's for his
first week's performance.
SSE organized the competition in part to in
troduce students to the fundamentals of invest
ing in the stock market and also to educate stu
dents about the stock market and investing re
sources open to them in the SSE Investments
Division.
Fontaine Lam, a sophomore, agreed that
the challenge "can really open the eyes of peo
ple who know next to nothing about trading."
Lam, who is participating in the challenge,
noted that the contest was"a good way to be
more aware of the U.S. economy and its mar
kets [and] get some hands-on experience, risk
free."
While students who have entered the contest
after May 12 are not eligible for some prizes, all
participants are eligible for weekly and random
prizes.
