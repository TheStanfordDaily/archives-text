# Consoling cancer victims
## Mensola mentors 
### ANNA GALAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Aiming to help children deal
ing with cancer in their families,
Mensola, a new campus organi
zation, is currently seeking vol
unteer mentors. The program,
in its initial stages of recruitment,
hosted an information session
last week. Applications are due by
5 p.m. in the Haas center today.
Senior Amit Modi and junior
Noah Barish worked together to
create the program. Modi had
the idea to help Bay Area youths
who have a parent who suffers
from cancer or have recently ex
perienced the death of a parent
due to cancer. He contacted
Barish, who works with Camp
Kesem, a camp for children
whose parents have cancer.
Modi said that he and Barish
started a discourse with local
grief support organizations Kara
and Kids Helping Kids. After
Mensola established the guide
lines for their program, they
began working with these orga
nizations to form a partnership.
Modi and Barish said that once
the program is underway, local
organizations would start refer
ring patients to Mensola.
"I wanted to be a part of an
outreach project and help stu
dents for an extended amount
of time," Modi said.
Mensola volunteers will be
required to commit to a mentor
ing relationship for at least six
months.
"We wanted to start modest
ly, knowing these limitations,"
said Barish. "We're hoping fora
core group of 10-15 mentors for
the first rotation, a manageable
group size."
Barish, who is the education
al coordinator for Camp Kesem,
said he used several techniques
employed in his experience at
the camp to guide the planning
of Mensola.
"We are planning to develop a

community of peers who are all in
the same situation. llle model
has been used effectively in Camp
Kesem, where they can be kids,
have fun, but also learn from oth
ers," Barish said. "There is a huge
need for these services in the area,
especially for older kids that often
get overlooked."
Both Modi and Barish
stressed the importance of se
lecting and training volunteers.
" There's a lot of training that
has to go into child care," Barish
said. "Anytime you work with
kids, you need to have your vol
unteers trained well, especially
when there's some upheaval for
the family."
Sophomore lan Dobson, who
attended the information ses
sion last week, said he heard
about the program through his
dorm e-mail list and, after talk
ing about it with his roommates,
decided to apply.
"From the sound of it, it will
be somewhat of a long-term pro
gram where there is really an
opportunity to make a differ
ence," Dobson said.
Dobson said he hoped to cre
ate a relationship with his
mentee that they both could
benefit from. He said he has
wanted to get involved with vol
unteer work fora while, and the
Mensola program looked like a
good opportunity.
"It deals with a problem that
most of us don't talk about
much," Dobson said.
The next steps for Barish and
Modi, who have been working
with oncology social workers at
the Stanford Medical Center to
recruit children who may bene
fit from a mentoring relation
ship, involve interviewing appli
cants and getting more people
involved organizationally.
"We want to help as many
children as possible," Modi said.
"We're starting small, but I'm
envisioning the program, a year
from now, getting bigger."
