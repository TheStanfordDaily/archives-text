### JANICE SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Historical Soci
ety sponsored a presentation on
the history of Stanford's endow
ment fund yesterday afternoon at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center. En
titled, "Evolution of Endowment
100 years of Trusteeship," the
presentation was given by Bob
Augsburger, the Society's vice
president and former vice presi
dent for business and finance of
the University. The talk recapitu
lated of all the important financial
developments that have made ed
ucation possible at Stanford.
Augsburger, who has been re
searching the endowment for the
last three years, broke down the
history of Stanford's endowment
into four generations.
The first period, 1903-1935,
consisted of the transfer of power
from the University to the Board
of Trustees in the form of a $24.2
million founding grant. Most in
vestments of this time were in
bonds, and this was a period of or
ganization and restructuring.
The second period, 1936-
1968, mostly focused on bonds,
stock and the development of the
Stanford Shopping Center and
other lands. The endowment had
$268 million of total assets in
1968.
The third period, 1969-1991,
dealt with the passing of the Uni
form Management of Institution
Funds Act by the government.
The endowment totaled $2.3 bil
lion in 1991.
Fhe fourth and current period
has seen the boom and crash of
the high-tech bubble. The en
dowment reached $7.6 million in
2002, only $1.9 billion of which
was acquired from gift aid.
The 27-year-old society is com
prised of volunteers, a great deal
of whom are Stanford alumni,
and current or retired faculty and
staff. Over the course of the year
they sponsor six or seven public

programs regarding Stanford's
history. The purpose of the pro
grams, as formulated by the orig
inal founders in 1976, is "to col
lect and preserve the history of
the . . . University and to encour
age knowledge and understand
ing of [that] history."
"The long view is really impor
tant â€” some got in trouble by
only [looking] at the short term
and got influenced by market
psychology, and you normally
make bad decisions during those
periods," Augsburger said of the
post-Depression strategy of en
dowment management. "The im
portant thing, when there are ob
stacles, for example the Court De
cree and Uniform Management
of Intuition Funds Act, is working
to bring about change."
Augsburger stressed the need
for forward-thinking invest
ments.
"At the turn of the century, 62
percent of the equity markets
were railroad corporations, so
there wasn't much else to do," he
said. "In the fifties, it was really
bonds and stocks. Now, today,
you've got all of these myriads
that they call alternative invest
ments to choose from, and I think
asset allocation is really nothing
more than diversification."
The sizable audience at the
talk was primarily composed of
Society members and other
alumni.
"It helped put into perspective
a lot of the things we were raising
funds for during that time and
where and how the money was
getting put into the investment
side of Stanford," said Joe
Rodgers, Class of 1951. "It was
very informative from that stand
point, for me personally."
The two undergraduate win
ners of the society's second annu
al essay contest were announced.
Juniors Katherine Buchanon and
Kathryn Gin were honored for
submitting essays from their his
tory classes.
