made rocket fired from Gaza hit a nearby Israeli
town, the military said.
In diplomacy, a top European Union leader
met with Yasser Arafat on Tuesday, rejecting a
joint U.S.-Israeli decision to boycott the embat
tled Palestinian leader.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon seemed to back away from more mod
erate statements by staking out a tough stand on
settlements and suggesting he will try to hold on
to much of the West Bank's heartland in the
peace process that aims to create a Palestinian
state in three years.
Sharon's comments to the Jerusalem Post
newspaper came days before a crucial weekend
meeting with his new Palestinian counterpart
Mahmoud Abbas and ahead of next week's
meeting with President Bush.
