# Al-Qaida linked to Riyadh carnage

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi authorities
linked a 19-member al-Qaida team yesterday to car
nage at three foreign compounds in the capital — mul
tiple, simultaneous car bombings that killed at least 30
people, including eight Americans.
Nine attackers were among the dead. Another 194
people were wounded, most of them not seriously, ac
cording to Saudi officials; 40 were said to be Americans.
"These despicable acts were committed by killers
whose only faith is hate, and the United States will find
the killers, and they will learn the meaning of American
justice," President Bush said.
In a statement posted on the Saudi Press Agency Web
site, the Interior Ministry described the attacks as "sui
cide operations" and said the nine bodies found in the lo
cation of the explosions were those of "the terrorists."
The FBI said it would send agents to join the inves

tigation. Though no one claimed responsibility for the
attacks, Secretary of State Colin Powell, who arrived in
Saudi Arabia for an official visit hours after the blasts,
said they had "the fingerprints of al-Qaida."
Saudi authorities made a direct connection between
the attacks and a May 6 gunfight between police and 19
al-Qaida operatives in the same part of Riyadh where
the bombings occurred.
"The only information we have is that some of them
were members of the group that was sought a few days
ago, the 19 fellows whose pictures came out in the
press," Prince Turki al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's ambas
sador to Britain and a former Saudi intelligence chief,
said in London.
The 19 escaped. Among them were 17 Saudis, a
Yemeni, and an Iraqi with Kuwaiti and Canadian
citizenship.
