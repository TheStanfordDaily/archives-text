# House Dems continue Texas standoff

### 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” Democrats who fled to a
Holiday Inn in Oklahoma to thwart a Republican
drive to redraw the state's congressional districts
spent their second day on the lam yesterday talking to
jovial constituents who made the trek across the state
line to show their support.
The constituents brought fruit baskets, balloons
and cookies for the House Democrats, two days after
they sneaked out of Austin amid a heated battle over
a GOP redisricting plan.
Three Democrats returned to the Capitol yester
day, but Republicans were still denied a quorum
needed to conduct business.
The mood was subdued in the historic chamber
Tuesday, with Republicans pleased to see a few De
mocrats stream in. One legislator had organized a
"behind-the-scenes" tour of the Bob Bullock Texas
History Museum, not far from the Capitol.
Republicans had constructed signs and gimmicks
ridiculing their colleagues. They plastered the De
mocrats' faces on milk cartons, and Susan Wed
dington, chairwoman of the Republican Party of
Texas, borrowing from the "most wanted Iraqi"
cards, announced she had playing cards featuring
the missing legislators.
The defiant Democrats remained at the hotel in
Ardmore, Okla., about 30 miles north of the Texas
border and about 270 miles due north of Austin. 'They
met privately in a hotel conference room to discuss
school financing, homeowners insurance, the state
budget and other issues.
Democrats blame the standoff on the GOP's at
tempt to redraw the congressional districts. The plan
could add five to seven GOP House seats to the 15 it
already has. The state has 32 congressional districts.
States must redraw their congressional districts
every 10 years to reflect population shifts found in
the U.S. Census.
