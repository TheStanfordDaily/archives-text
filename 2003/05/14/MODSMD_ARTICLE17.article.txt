## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Inhumane violations 
### 
On a patch of grass near White Plaza
stand a series of fences covered with
symbolic items and informative
fliers, hanging heavy with the words
and feelings relating the anguish and suffering
of political prisoners in North Korea. This sym
bolic display is part of North Korean Human
Rights Week, aimed at educating the Stanford
community about the atrocities currendy com
mitted in that country.
As the spotlight slowly dims from the events
in Iraq, and the stories in the media begin to
focus on North Korea, too often the threats of
nuclear weapons and pending military action
overshadow the repeated human rights viola
dons inflicted on North Korea's citizens by their
own leader.
According to the U.S. Department of State
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,
released on March 4, 2002, "[The Democratic
People's Republic of Korea] government's
human rights record [has] remained poor, and
[the government has] continued to commit nu
merous serious abuses. Citizens do not have the
right [to] peacefully change their government.
There [have] continued to be reports of extraju
dicial killings and disappearances. Citizens are
detained arbitrarily and many are held as politi
cal prisoners; prison conditions are harsh."
Even more striking, however, is that the re
port was released a year ago — and numerous
reports issued by the United Nations and many
countries have confirmed these human rights
violations — and yet no major action has been
taken to stop or further prevent these abuses.
Only when North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong
11, announced recendy that the country had a
nuclear weapons program did world leaders,

including George W. Bush, turn their heads.
For this reason — and, more importantly,
for the sheer depravity of the inhumane prac
tices being committed by the North Korean
government — as a society, we have a responsi
bility to become informed and take action
against such blatant human rights violations.
At Stanford, we fully endorse the organizers
of this week's events — the Korean American
Students Association and Stanford Hwimori —
for impressing upon the Stanford community
the immediacy and significance of this matter.
The planners of the events have aimed at "bal
ancing the week between 'education' through
the speakers and the documentary, and 'ac
tion,' through the benefit concert and the let
ter-writing ... providing a tangible way for
people to take action," according Michelle Jo,
Korean American Student Association chair.
Whether or not the United States takes mil
itary action against North Korea, we urge the
Stanford community to become educated
about the human rights violations occurring in
this part of the world. Education and under
standing is the first important step toward fur
ther action.
Take a moment from your week to walk
through the fences near White Plaza and learn
just how many hours each prisoner is forced to
work in one day, see the meager food rations al
lowed to these starving individuals and read the
frightening accounts of sexual and physical as
sault. These are certainly difficult sights and
facts to swallow under the bright California sun,
but one cannot simply ignore the prolonged
suffering of an entire country under such abso
lute rule and action must be taken to stop the
reign of terror of Kim 11.

This editorial refnesenls the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing edi
tor for spec uil sections, two opinions editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer
