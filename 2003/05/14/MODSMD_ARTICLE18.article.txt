Recently, there have been
questions from readers
regarding my apparent
lack of school spirit. I
admit I have taken a critical eye at
Stanford more than once in my
columns this year and I am certain
ly not the only one. Many of my fel
low columnists have questioned
Stanford institutions, such as the
ASSU, Admit Weekend, the Stan
ford Band and ethnic theme
dorms. We see these establishments
as an important parts of the Stan
ford experience, but we also recog
nize flaws within these hallmarks of
the Farm.
But does pointing out the short
comings of Stanford mean we lack
school spirit? Or is it that we love
this damn place so much we cannot
help but point out its faults, in
hopes of opening a discussion and
possibly bringing about some form
of change?
We all like Stanford. I like Stan
ford. If that weren't the case, I
wouldn't be writing this column
here. I'd be working for The Daily
Californian instead and yelling
"Go Bears!"
Contrary to popular belief, I
am not bitter about not getting
into Harvard — I actually never
applied. In my last column, I stat
ed that Stanford was the place for
all the world's greatest students
who did not get into Harvard, but
I was merely jesting. I was simply
referencing the playfully antago
nistic nature that exists between
these two excellent institutions
and the "second-best mentality"
that, like it or not, sometimes man
ifests itself among a few students
on campus in relation to the Crim
son kids back east.
Uri Pomerantz, my fellow
columnist at The Daily, addressed
this "second-best mentality" that
pervades the Stanford student pop

ulation in his column "Overcoming
the Harvard complex" (March 6).
Pomerantz never said Harvard was
indeed "better" than Stanford in
any way, shape or form; instead he
used "Ivy-envy" as a platform to ad
dress what he saw were the short
comings of the Stanford education
al system.
Nothing is perfect, even Stan
ford's excellent academic program.

A few columns
back, I criticized
the General Edu
cation Require
ments for not ad
dressing the needs
of students on our
campus. In regard
to both cases of
criticism, Pomer-

ant 2 and I want Stanford to be the
best place it can be, and we both see
faults in the system. And rather
than sitting back and complaining
to our roommates or friends, we
want to provide a forum for discus
sion on these matters.
Sometimes it takes a person out
side a particular institution to rec
ognize a fault within the organiza
tion. Kendall and Madjlessi's recent
column, "Bring it on!" (May 5) took
a lighthearted look at the Stanford
Band and elicited strong, negative
reactions from several people I
know. Interestingly enough, all of
these people are affiliated with the
Band. It makes sense that they
would be defensive about what was
said, and it makes more sense that
many Stanford students (and facul
ty for that matter) would be defen
sive about any grievances lobbied
against their beloved school. Some
times these complaints may be com
pletely warranted, and it would be
unfortunate if they were shot down
or brushed aside because of our
own biased viewpoints. Yet there is
nothing wrong with wanting things

to be better — even if that means
being critical of the things we love.
Often times what is written by
the columnists in the Opinions sec
tion does not fly well with the read
ers of The Daily. In another
provocative column, "Voluntary
segregation" (April 17), Pomerantz
voiced his criticisms of ethnic theme
dorms. He elicited so many impas
sioned responses that he followed it
up with another column comment
ing on the strong reactions that re
verberated across the campus.
The issue is not whether you
agree or disagree with him. The im
portant part is that Pomerantz
stirred up a dialogue on campus
about the issues that students face
when they make housing choices.
The column opened up the door
for more discussion on a topic that
is apparendy divisive. Had he not
written the piece, would there have
been such important discussions
occurring on campus? I seriously
doubt it. Imagine other important
issues, either taken for granted or
simply bubbling right below the
surface, aching to be discussed, yet
neglected due to a lack of an impe
tus or awareness of the situation.
If anything, it would take some
one with a serious lack of school
spirit not to express what he or she
thought was wrong and could be
improved. How many of us have
noticed something that needed im
provement on campus? How
many of us would do something
about it? Clearly, Stanford is not a
Utopia and we all have ideas on
how things on the Farm can be im
proved. But as long we keep our
mouths shut and train ourselves to
look the other way, we will only be
hindering the University and its
goal to be a world-class institution.

We got spirit, how 'bout you ? Tell me
about it: viosqueda@stanford.edu.

We all like Stanford. I like Stan
ford. If that weren't the case, I
wouldn't be writing this column
here. I'd be working for The Daily
Californian instead and yelling
"Go Bears!"
Contrary to popular belief, I
am not bitter about not getting
into Harvard — I actually never
applied. In my last column, I stat
ed that Stanford was the place for
all the world's greatest students
who did not get into Harvard, but
I was merely jesting. I was simply
referencing the playfully antago
nistic nature that exists between
these two excellent institutions
and the "second-best mentality"
that, like it or not, sometimes man
ifests itself among a few students
on campus in relation to the Crim
son kids back east.
Uri Pomerantz, my fellow
columnist at The Daily, addressed
this "second-best mentality" that
pervades the Stanford student pop

ulation in his column "Overcoming
the Harvard complex" (March 6).
Pomerantz never said Harvard was
indeed "better" than Stanford in
any way, shape or form; instead he
used "Ivy-envy" as a platform to ad
dress what he saw were the short
comings of the Stanford education
al system.
Nothing is perfect, even Stan
ford's excellent academic program.

A few columns
back, I criticized
the General Edu
cation Require
ments for not ad
dressing the needs
of students on our
campus. In regard
to both cases of
criticism, Pomer-

ant 2 and I want Stanford to be the
best place it can be, and we both see
faults in the system. And rather
than sitting back and complaining
to our roommates or friends, we
want to provide a forum for discus
sion on these matters.
Sometimes it takes a person out
side a particular institution to rec
ognize a fault within the organiza
tion. Kendall and Madjlessi's recent
column, "Bring it on!" (May 5) took
a lighthearted look at the Stanford
Band and elicited strong, negative
reactions from several people I
know. Interestingly enough, all of
these people are affiliated with the
Band. It makes sense that they
would be defensive about what was
said, and it makes more sense that
many Stanford students (and facul
ty for that matter) would be defen
sive about any grievances lobbied
against their beloved school. Some
times these complaints may be com
pletely warranted, and it would be
unfortunate if they were shot down
or brushed aside because of our
own biased viewpoints. Yet there is
nothing wrong with wanting things

to be better — even if that means
being critical of the things we love.
Often times what is written by
the columnists in the Opinions sec
tion does not fly well with the read
ers of The Daily. In another
provocative column, "Voluntary
segregation" (April 17), Pomerantz
voiced his criticisms of ethnic theme
dorms. He elicited so many impas
sioned responses that he followed it
up with another column comment
ing on the strong reactions that re
verberated across the campus.
The issue is not whether you
agree or disagree with him. The im
portant part is that Pomerantz
stirred up a dialogue on campus
about the issues that students face
when they make housing choices.
The column opened up the door
for more discussion on a topic that
is apparendy divisive. Had he not
written the piece, would there have
been such important discussions
occurring on campus? I seriously
doubt it. Imagine other important
issues, either taken for granted or
simply bubbling right below the
surface, aching to be discussed, yet
neglected due to a lack of an impe
tus or awareness of the situation.
If anything, it would take some
one with a serious lack of school
spirit not to express what he or she
thought was wrong and could be
improved. How many of us have
noticed something that needed im
provement on campus? How
many of us would do something
about it? Clearly, Stanford is not a
Utopia and we all have ideas on
how things on the Farm can be im
proved. But as long we keep our
mouths shut and train ourselves to
look the other way, we will only be
hindering the University and its
goal to be a world-class institution.

We got spirit, how 'bout you ? Tell me
about it: viosqueda@stanford.edu.
