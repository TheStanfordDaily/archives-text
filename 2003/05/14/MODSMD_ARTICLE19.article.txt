# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## I-Hum self-study explained 
### ROB ROBINSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
As Faculty Director of I-Hum, I felt that it was im
portant to respond to some of the issues raised in
"Survey indicates high freshman satisfaction" and
"Self-study on I-Hum downplays concerns" (May 13)
dealing with the I-Hum self-study.
I do not want to deal at length with the concern
that it was a self-study. It was supposed to be so and
the existence of an earlier editorial written by the
Freedom Forum is not in and of itself a reason to
make it an "outside" study. But such a suggestion be
trays a lack of understanding of how such "outside"
reviews work. In all such reviews that I am aware of,
almost all of the work is done by the organization
being reviewed, and the "outside" authorities devote
at most a couple of days to reading the internally
generated documents, interviewing a few selected
groups of people and then writing some kind of sum
mary report with suggestions. The result of such a
process would not have been much different than

what happened here; certainly the Committee on
Undergraduate and Standards and Policy, whom we
reported to, as well as other groups which read our
self-study, has no particular self-interest in I-Hum
the way it is.
I can't understand how the article about I-Hum
states that "in the 24 pages of the executive summary
and main report, only six lines of text are dedicated
to student complaints." This is simply not true. I n ad
dition to the three sentences quoted in the article
which deal with changing the student culture, the en
tire section on "Cultivating Consistency in Student
Learning Experiences," under External and Internal
Challenges, addresses directly several of the student
complaints later mentioned in the article as if we
hadn't heard them, plus some he doesn't list. Other
sections also mention student concerns.
The 24-page main document was meant to be an
overview of accomplishments and challenges, and I
believe that we got it right. But it bears pointing out
that the report as a whole makes
public all of the data we gathered,
both negative and positive, and
yet the article only made selective
use of it. We really did try to give
as fair a picture as possible of the
strengths and weaknesses of the
program.
I do feel that I need to give the I-
Hum perspective on the report re
cently released by the Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students,
entided "The Freshman Year at
Stanford." The Daily has made an
issue of the fact that the public ver
sion of that report omits the re
sponses to the I-Hum section of the
original questionnaire, and instead
refers readers to the I-Hum self
study available on the Web. There
are a few things I would like to clear
up concerning these matters:
First of all, the I-Hum program
participated in this questionnaire
(as did other freshman-year pro
grams) in an attempt to gather
useful data concerning the pro
gram. Given that this was the year
of the I-Hum self-study, we were
eager for data to include in our re
port. It was certainly our under

standing that the data would be
made available to the programs in
question, and of course to the
Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students, but it was certainly not
our understanding that the whole
report would be released publicly.
Somehow, of all the freshman
academic programs participating,
the I-Hum program was the only
one to end up in the draft version
of the report. At that point, the
program was listed alongside
campus environment, residential
life, personal growth, community
centers, how one feels valued as a
person and student services, plus
the extremely abstract "aca
demics," as a comparison set.
The first draft of this report was
sent to us on March 4 of this year,
when I-Hum was effectively wind
ing up its own rather extensive
self-study. It became clear to us at
that point that the I-Hum pro
gram stuck out like a sore thumb,
especially in a report written by a
director of market research.
In a report geared to identify
ing "the biggest bang for the
buck" — certainly not our objec
tive — several important deci
sions were made, even if they were
negative for the I-Hum program.
The most important, perhaps, was
to withhold the actual responses

concerning "satisfaction," for
which a seven-point scale was set
up, and only contrast "extremely
positive" responses with "nega
tive" ones. I-Hum was then
ranked lowest against all other cat
egories as having the most nega
tives against very positives. The
results published stated that stu
dents were 31 percent "dissatis
fied" against 24 percent "very sat
isfied" with the program. These
figures sound terrible, until one
realizes that the same data can be
stated as 48 percent "satisfied" vs.
19 percent "very dissatisfied."
The problem is, of course, that
both statements leave out from 45
percent to 33 percent of the re
spondents, who felt neither very
negative nor very positive. This is
rectified in the summary on our I-
Hum self-report Web site.
The Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students agreed with the
directors of I-Hum that the draft
report should be revised to ex
clude the I-Hum data, given the
objections discussed above, but
that the 1-Hum data should be in
cluded in full in the I-Hum self
study, as they currently are.

The most important, perhaps, was
to withhold the actual responses

concerning "satisfaction," for
which a seven-point scale was set
up, and only contrast "extremely
positive" responses with "nega
tive" ones. I-Hum was then
ranked lowest against all other cat
egories as having the most nega
tives against very positives. The
results published stated that stu
dents were 31 percent "dissatis
fied" against 24 percent "very sat
isfied" with the program. These
figures sound terrible, until one
realizes that the same data can be
stated as 48 percent "satisfied" vs.
19 percent "very dissatisfied."
The problem is, of course, that
both statements leave out from 45
percent to 33 percent of the re
spondents, who felt neither very
negative nor very positive. This is
rectified in the summary on our I-
Hum self-report Web site.
The Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students agreed with the
directors of I-Hum that the draft
report should be revised to ex
clude the I-Hum data, given the
objections discussed above, but
that the 1-Hum data should be in
cluded in full in the I-Hum self
study, as they currently are.

As Faculty Director of I-Hum, I felt that it was im
portant to respond to some of the issues raised in
"Survey indicates high freshman satisfaction" and
"Self-study on I-Hum downplays concerns" (May 13)
dealing with the I-Hum self-study.
I do not want to deal at length with the concern
that it was a self-study. It was supposed to be so and
the existence of an earlier editorial written by the
Freedom Forum is not in and of itself a reason to
make it an "outside" study. But such a suggestion be
trays a lack of understanding of how such "outside"
reviews work. In all such reviews that I am aware of,
almost all of the work is done by the organization
being reviewed, and the "outside" authorities devote
at most a couple of days to reading the internally
generated documents, interviewing a few selected
groups of people and then writing some kind of sum
mary report with suggestions. The result of such a
process would not have been much different than

what happened here; certainly the Committee on
Undergraduate and Standards and Policy, whom we
reported to, as well as other groups which read our
self-study, has no particular self-interest in I-Hum
the way it is.
I can't understand how the article about I-Hum
states that "in the 24 pages of the executive summary
and main report, only six lines of text are dedicated
to student complaints." This is simply not true. I n ad
dition to the three sentences quoted in the article
which deal with changing the student culture, the en
tire section on "Cultivating Consistency in Student
Learning Experiences," under External and Internal
Challenges, addresses directly several of the student
complaints later mentioned in the article as if we
hadn't heard them, plus some he doesn't list. Other
sections also mention student concerns.
The 24-page main document was meant to be an
overview of accomplishments and challenges, and I
believe that we got it right. But it bears pointing out
that the report as a whole makes
public all of the data we gathered,
both negative and positive, and
yet the article only made selective
use of it. We really did try to give
as fair a picture as possible of the
strengths and weaknesses of the
program.
I do feel that I need to give the I-
Hum perspective on the report re
cently released by the Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students,
entided "The Freshman Year at
Stanford." The Daily has made an
issue of the fact that the public ver
sion of that report omits the re
sponses to the I-Hum section of the
original questionnaire, and instead
refers readers to the I-Hum self
study available on the Web. There
are a few things I would like to clear
up concerning these matters:
First of all, the I-Hum program
participated in this questionnaire
(as did other freshman-year pro
grams) in an attempt to gather
useful data concerning the pro
gram. Given that this was the year
of the I-Hum self-study, we were
eager for data to include in our re
port. It was certainly our under

standing that the data would be
made available to the programs in
question, and of course to the
Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students, but it was certainly not
our understanding that the whole
report would be released publicly.
Somehow, of all the freshman
academic programs participating,
the I-Hum program was the only
one to end up in the draft version
of the report. At that point, the
program was listed alongside
campus environment, residential
life, personal growth, community
centers, how one feels valued as a
person and student services, plus
the extremely abstract "aca
demics," as a comparison set.
The first draft of this report was
sent to us on March 4 of this year,
when I-Hum was effectively wind
ing up its own rather extensive
self-study. It became clear to us at
that point that the I-Hum pro
gram stuck out like a sore thumb,
especially in a report written by a
director of market research.
In a report geared to identify
ing "the biggest bang for the
buck" — certainly not our objec
tive — several important deci
sions were made, even if they were
negative for the I-Hum program.
The most important, perhaps, was
to withhold the actual responses

concerning "satisfaction," for
which a seven-point scale was set
up, and only contrast "extremely
positive" responses with "nega
tive" ones. I-Hum was then
ranked lowest against all other cat
egories as having the most nega
tives against very positives. The
results published stated that stu
dents were 31 percent "dissatis
fied" against 24 percent "very sat
isfied" with the program. These
figures sound terrible, until one
realizes that the same data can be
stated as 48 percent "satisfied" vs.
19 percent "very dissatisfied."
The problem is, of course, that
both statements leave out from 45
percent to 33 percent of the re
spondents, who felt neither very
negative nor very positive. This is
rectified in the summary on our I-
Hum self-report Web site.
The Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students agreed with the
directors of I-Hum that the draft
report should be revised to ex
clude the I-Hum data, given the
