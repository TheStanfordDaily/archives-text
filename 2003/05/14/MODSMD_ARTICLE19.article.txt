# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## I-Hum self-study explained 
### ROB ROBINSON GUEST COLUMNIST 
As Faculty Director of I-Hum, I felt that it was im
portant to respond to some of the issues raised in
"Survey indicates high freshman satisfaction" and
"Self-study on I-Hum downplays concerns" (May 13)
dealing with the I-Hum self-study.
I do not want to deal at length with the concern
that it was a self-study. It was supposed to be so and
the existence of an earlier editorial written by the
Freedom Forum is not in and of itself a reason to
make it an "outside" study. But such a suggestion be
trays a lack of understanding of how such "outside"
reviews work. In all such reviews that I am aware of,
almost all of the work is done by the organization
being reviewed, and the "outside" authorities devote
at most a couple of days to reading the internally
generated documents, interviewing a few selected
groups of people and then writing some kind of sum
mary report with suggestions. The result of such a
process would not have been much different than

what happened here; certainly the Committee on
Undergraduate and Standards and Policy, whom we
reported to, as well as other groups which read our
self-study, has no particular self-interest in I-Hum
the way it is.
I can't understand how the article about I-Hum
states that "in the 24 pages of the executive summary
and main report, only six lines of text are dedicated
to student complaints." This is simply not true. I n ad
dition to the three sentences quoted in the article
which deal with changing the student culture, the en
tire section on "Cultivating Consistency in Student
Learning Experiences," under External and Internal
Challenges, addresses directly several of the student
complaints later mentioned in the article as if we
hadn't heard them, plus some he doesn't list. Other
sections also mention student concerns.
The 24-page main document was meant to be an
overview of accomplishments and challenges, and I
believe that we got it right. But it bears pointing out
