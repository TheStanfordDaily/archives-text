Economics theories only meaningful in an
ethical context
Let's do a simple cost-benefit analysis of
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Madj
lessi's "Living in a material world" (May
12). Cost to the reader: approximately 180
seconds. Benefit: nil, because of the mis
leading conclusions derived from a misap
plication of economic theory. I agree it
may be useful for my peers to understand
economics. However, it perpetuates a mis
understanding of the discipline to suggest
they should apply theoretical principles
without considering their empirical validi
ty or ethical consequences. Any Econ 1
student will tell you the models are de
signed to simplify reality, not to provide a
basis for making normative claims about
the world.
Consider the columnists' contention
that a living wage "is detrimental to the
workers [proponents] claim to be help
ing because it reduces their employment
and increases deadweight loss." The un
derlying logic is that living wages in
crease labor costs and firms respond by
cutting jobs. In reality, however, the rate
of employment stays the same. As Nobel

laureate Robert Solow remarked, "the
main thing about this research [on living
wages] is that the evidence of job loss is
weak." Firms probably save money
through lower turnover, vacancy and ac
cident rates and productivity improve
ments. In the extreme, no one loses their
job, but everyone is better off.
But there is a more fundamental prob
lem with the column. By deriding social
activism, the columnists would have us be
lieve that Econ 1 concepts are the final au
thority for discussing social issues. This
overlooks the increasing sophistication of
the economics discipline as it incorporates
explanations based on institutional struc
ture, power and politics.
Moreover, market models don't help us
make decisions about how to improve
their situation of the underprivileged. It's
only within an ethical context that eco
nomic pronouncements have any real
meaning. This underscores the impor
tance of all University departments, con
trary to the monopoly of economic con
cepts over all "human and s<x:ial behavior"
that the columnists suggest. They would
have us believe that English majors lack
common sense for not taking Econ 1, but
it looks like the columnists need to take a
refresher. Perhaps such drivel was meant
to inspire discussion, but there's no substi

tute fora well-written column.

New York Times should not hove priori
tized diversity over quality
In editorial "Journalistic integrity,"
The Daily failed to both identify and ad
dress the core problem that underlies the
Jayson Blair situation - The New York
Times' belief that diversity is a higher ideal
than accurate journalism and credibility.
I hat Jayson Blair was in the role he had
was, in large part, the result of the New
York limes placing diversity above merit
in evaluating him, doing both itself and
Mr. Blair a great disservice.
There is clear evidence that the Times
values diversity above quality. In 2001,
Howell Raines, executive editor of The
New York limes, spoke to the convention
of the National Association of Black Jour
nalists. In his remarks, he specifically men
tioned Blair as an example of the type of
diversity the Times was seeking. " This
campaign has made our staff better and,
more importantly [emphasis added],
more diverse," Raines said.
When asked by National Public Radio if

he learned anything from this incident
that might force him to rethink diversity as
being more important than a better staff,
Raines said: "No, I do not see it as an illus
trating point. I see it as illustrating a
tragedy for Jayson Blair...a tragedy of fail
ure on his part."
Obviously it is a failure by Blair. But
The limes' own investigation reveals it
did not pay attention to the warning signs.
It did not pay attention to poor perfor
mance reviews by editors and it did not
scrutinize his track record of mistakes
needing published corrections. Instead,
he was promoted - despite a plea by his
own editor to fire him.
The Times understands that studies
have shown that diverse teams typically
outperform when compared to a homoge
neous team. What they forgot is that in
those studies the teams had the same skill
level. Diverse or not, teams with lower
skills levels will rarely outperform com
pared to teams with higher skill levels.
I support diversity, but only as long as
it is a means to an objective and not an
objective in and of itself, and certainly
never more important than quality and
integrity.
The Times forgot that its objective is to
publish "All the News Iliat's Fit to Print"
and to do it better than anyone else. It's

clear that diversity can help it do that bet
ter, but only if it has diverse journalists
who possess the requisite skills to do it in
the first place. Clearly Blair did not fit the
bill. Unfortunately Raines has not learned
this important lesson.
The Daily correctly cites the first and
second rules regarding journalistic in
tegrity when it congratulates the Times
for airing its dirty laundry. Unfortunate
ly, the editorial forgot to mention the
third important rule: To figure out why
the error was made and take the neces
sary steps to reduce the likelihood of its
recurrence.
The Daily should have blasted the New
York Times for not learning its lesson. In
stead it coddled it. The Daily praised the
Times for acknowledging the error, when
it should have ripped it for not taking
steps to reduce the chances of having
more Jayson Blairs. The Times needs to
review its diversity program and make the
necessary changes to ensure, first and
foremost, that promotions are done on
the basis of merit. That the Daily's editori
al board misses that important next step
leaves it vulnerable to the making the
same mistake.

in evaluating him, doing both itself and
Mr. Blair a great disservice.
There is clear evidence that the Times
values diversity above quality. In 2001,
Howell Raines, executive editor of The
New York limes, spoke to the convention
of the National Association of Black Jour
nalists. In his remarks, he specifically men
tioned Blair as an example of the type of
diversity the Times was seeking. " This
campaign has made our staff better and,
more importantly [emphasis added],
more diverse," Raines said.
When asked by National Public Radio if

he learned anything from this incident
that might force him to rethink diversity as
being more important than a better staff,
Raines said: "No, I do not see it as an illus
trating point. I see it as illustrating a
tragedy for Jayson Blair...a tragedy of fail
ure on his part."
Obviously it is a failure by Blair. But
The limes' own investigation reveals it
did not pay attention to the warning signs.
It did not pay attention to poor perfor
mance reviews by editors and it did not
scrutinize his track record of mistakes
needing published corrections. Instead,
he was promoted - despite a plea by his
own editor to fire him.
The Times understands that studies
have shown that diverse teams typically
outperform when compared to a homoge
neous team. What they forgot is that in
those studies the teams had the same skill
level. Diverse or not, teams with lower
skills levels will rarely outperform com
pared to teams with higher skill levels.
I support diversity, but only as long as
it is a means to an objective and not an
objective in and of itself, and certainly
never more important than quality and
integrity.
The Times forgot that its objective is to
publish "All the News Iliat's Fit to Print"
and to do it better than anyone else. It's

clear that diversity can help it do that bet
ter, but only if it has diverse journalists
who possess the requisite skills to do it in
the first place. Clearly Blair did not fit the
bill. Unfortunately Raines has not learned
this important lesson.
The Daily correctly cites the first and
second rules regarding journalistic in
tegrity when it congratulates the Times
for airing its dirty laundry. Unfortunate
ly, the editorial forgot to mention the
third important rule: To figure out why
the error was made and take the neces
sary steps to reduce the likelihood of its
recurrence.
The Daily should have blasted the New
York Times for not learning its lesson. In
stead it coddled it. The Daily praised the
Times for acknowledging the error, when
it should have ripped it for not taking
steps to reduce the chances of having
more Jayson Blairs. The Times needs to
review its diversity program and make the
necessary changes to ensure, first and
foremost, that promotions are done on
the basis of merit. That the Daily's editori
al board misses that important next step
leaves it vulnerable to the making the
same mistake.

Economics theories only meaningful in an
ethical context
Let's do a simple cost-benefit analysis of
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Madj
lessi's "Living in a material world" (May
12). Cost to the reader: approximately 180
seconds. Benefit: nil, because of the mis
leading conclusions derived from a misap
plication of economic theory. I agree it
may be useful for my peers to understand
economics. However, it perpetuates a mis
understanding of the discipline to suggest
they should apply theoretical principles
without considering their empirical validi
ty or ethical consequences. Any Econ 1
student will tell you the models are de
signed to simplify reality, not to provide a
basis for making normative claims about
the world.
Consider the columnists' contention
that a living wage "is detrimental to the
workers [proponents] claim to be help
ing because it reduces their employment
and increases deadweight loss." The un
derlying logic is that living wages in
crease labor costs and firms respond by
cutting jobs. In reality, however, the rate
of employment stays the same. As Nobel

laureate Robert Solow remarked, "the
main thing about this research [on living
wages] is that the evidence of job loss is
weak." Firms probably save money
through lower turnover, vacancy and ac
cident rates and productivity improve
ments. In the extreme, no one loses their
job, but everyone is better off.
But there is a more fundamental prob
lem with the column. By deriding social
activism, the columnists would have us be
lieve that Econ 1 concepts are the final au
thority for discussing social issues. This
overlooks the increasing sophistication of
the economics discipline as it incorporates
explanations based on institutional struc
ture, power and politics.
Moreover, market models don't help us
make decisions about how to improve
their situation of the underprivileged. It's
only within an ethical context that eco
nomic pronouncements have any real
meaning. This underscores the impor
tance of all University departments, con
trary to the monopoly of economic con
cepts over all "human and s<x:ial behavior"
that the columnists suggest. They would
have us believe that English majors lack
common sense for not taking Econ 1, but
it looks like the columnists need to take a
refresher. Perhaps such drivel was meant
to inspire discussion, but there's no substi

tute fora well-written column.

New York Times should not hove priori
tized diversity over quality
In editorial "Journalistic integrity,"
The Daily failed to both identify and ad
dress the core problem that underlies the
Jayson Blair situation - The New York
Times' belief that diversity is a higher ideal
than accurate journalism and credibility.
I hat Jayson Blair was in the role he had
was, in large part, the result of the New
