## Remembering the tragic loss of Palestinian homeland 
### RULA RAZEK THE COALITION FOR JUSTICE IN ISRAEL/PALESTINE 
I oday, the Coalition for Justice in Is
rael / Palestine invites .ill students, lac nit y
and stall to gather in White Plaza at noon
to commemorate and learn about al-
Nakba, the catastrophe of 1948, in which
the Palestinians lost their homeland.
I know why I will be there.
I will be there because my father's
family was among the 700,000 Palestini
ans who fled in feat or were forcibly ex
pelled from their homes and lands by
Zionist militias in Palestine in 1948. I will
be there because the Palestinian loss and
exile and their tragic condition today —
living in exile or under Israeli military
occupation — continues to he threat
ened with historical erasure. And 1 will
be there because as an American and as
the wife of an American Jew, I believe
that the responsibility for ending the
continuing violence in the region and
the current devastation of Palestinian

society lies with all of us: Arabs, Jews and
all Americans alike.
Ignorance and distortion of the histo
ry and origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict
is endemic in the American media and
among analysts of the conflict. It contin
ues to threaten a just peace in the region.
I his distortion perpetuates the continu
ing marginalization of the physical pres
ence and political legitimacy of the Pales
tinian people, inaugurated by the events
that led to the establishment of Israel as a
Jewish state 55 years ago.
One of the earliest and most endur
ing slogans of the Zionist movement
with regards to their aspirations in
Palestine was:"A Land without a People
fora People without a Land." Histori
cally, we know this was far from the
case. At the beginning of the 20th cen
tury, Palestine was home to approxi
mately 500,000 indigenous Arabs and
60,000 Jews. Historical sources state
that by 1947, Palestine was populated
with approximately 1.2 million Arabs
and 600,000 Jews.

Despite this population ratio of 2:1,
and despite the fact that the distribution
of land ownership was approximately 92
percent Palestinian Arab to 8 percent
Jewish, the United Nations on Nov. 29,
1947 adopted Resolution 181 partition
ing Palestine into two states, one Jewish
and one Arab. This partition plan called
fora Jewish state on 56 percent of historic
Palestine and a Palestinian Arab state on
44 percent of the land.
According to the United Nations'
partition plan, therefore, a significant
amount of Arab-owned land was to be
designated as part of the Jewish state.
As such, it is hardly surprising that
Palestinian Arabs at the time rejected
the loss of significant chunks of their
homeland.
Rising out of this context, a civil war
ensued between Jews and Palestinian
Arabs from November 1947 until May
1948. During these hostilities, over 400
Palestinian communities were depopu
lated by Zionist forces who forcibly ex
pelled and led to the flight of over

700,000 Palestinians. In some cases,
Zionist forces carried out massacres of
civilians in order to induce the popula
tion to flee. These new refugees hoped
they could soon return from Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan or Iraq.
In total, over 250 Palestinian villages
were then repopulated with Jewish im
migrants and all traces of the Palestini
ans' past was erased from these villages.
The State of Israel was unilaterally de
clared on May 15, 1948. By the final
cease-fire in July 1949, Israel had
forcibly acquired approximately 78 per
cent of Palestine, in violation of the U.N.
mandate. Needless to say, a Palestinian
state never materialized, nor did the
promised return and compensation of
the Palestinian refugees under U.N.
Resolution 194.
This history of 1948 is not simply the
"Palestinian version of the story." It has
come to light thanks to the pioneering
empirical scholarship of the so-called
"new Israeli historians" such as Benny
Morris, Avi Shlaim, Simha Flapan and

Ilan Pappe, who have debunked myths
about the pristine nature of Israel's
founding.
Despite the emergence of this critical
body of history, the Palestinian experi
ence of loss, dispersion and exile re
mains a taboo topic in contemporary
American political culture. Today we
stand in White Plaza to affirm this histo
ry, to commemorate the tragic loss of
Palestinian homes, property and home
land, to support the political aspirations
of the Palestinian people and to advo
cate for the resolution of the conflict
through the implementation of existing
United Nations resolutions and inter
national law. Now more than ever, it is
crucial to keep this history and hope
alive.
