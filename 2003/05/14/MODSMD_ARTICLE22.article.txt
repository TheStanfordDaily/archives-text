## Strong season puts lacrosse on the map

Who says lacrosse isn't a West Coast
sport?
The No. 14 Stanford women's
lacrosse team (14-4, 4-0 Mountain Pa
cific Lacrosse league) did its part to de
feat the stereotype this season by play
ing— and beating — several of the
East Coast teams it faced.
The Cardinal's season ended May 4
with a thrilling 15-14 win over Califor
nia in the championship game of the
MPLL tournament. The victory gave
Stanford its second consecutive MPLL
title, capping off another strong sea
son.
Cardinal coach Michele Uhlfelder is
proud of the improvement her team
made in her third season at the helm.
"We put the program on the map
this year," Uhlfelder said. "That has
been a result and build up of a lot of
coaches', administrators' and players'
determination over the last couple
years."
Stanford did not receive an at-large
bid to the NCAA Tournament despite
an impressive resume that included
wins over tournament-bound UMBC
and Ohio State.
Most teams in the tournament re
ceived an automatic win by virtue of
winning their respective league cham
pionships. The four-team MPLL, how
ever, is not yet large enough for its win
ner to claim an automatic bid.
"We are not going to let the com
mittee's decision have the power to
take away from the kind of season we
had," Uhlfelder said. "At the end of a
season, it's always appropriate to look

back, look around and look ahead."
The Cardinal has many high points
to look back upon. In addition to its
wins over UMBC and Ohio State, the
Cardinal also defeated traditionally
strong teams from Notre Dame, Har
vard and Northwestern.
The victories against then-No. 11
Ohio State and then No. 15 Notre
Dame were especially impressive.
The Cardinal faced the Buckeyes in
early April, coming back from a 5-4
halftime-deficit to win 11-10 behind
sophomore Kelsey Twist's three goals.
"We had equally distributed scoring
and played a sharp, stick-to-stick de
fensive game," said T wist, who led the
Cardinal in scoring this season with 43
goals.
Sophomore Claire Calzonetti also
pointed to the significance of the Car
dinal's triumph in Columbus.
"We showed ourselves that we
could compete with anyone then and
that was really important for the rest of
our season," Calzonetti said.
Uhlfelder is not surprised that her
players recall this moment as one of the
defining points of the season.
"Most people would remember the
Ohio State game and feel that that was
a highlight and important step for our
team," Uhlfelder said. "That gave a lot
of momentum to us in the beginning of
the year."
The Cardinal's return to the Mid
west later in the season to face the Irish
was no less exciting.
The game went into double over

2:35 remaining to give Stanford the
