# Meet the parents fiasco leads to touching insight
## 
### 
Go ahead, laugh at me. Your
personal laughingstock is
writing again, and God knows
he has an embarrassing story
for all of you.
This past Sunday was Mother's Day
of course, and being the wonderful son
I am, I went to San Francisco to meet up
with my family and have a day of rever
ie in the city.
The idea was that we were going to
see a play and go to dinner, but my par
ents got an extra ticket for the play, so
they asked me to invite someone along.
I brought the girlfriend (referred to
as "Hot Stuff' — at her request — from

now on).
Hot Stuff had never
met the parents before,
but that possible awk
wardness wasn't going
to stop me from enjoy
ing mom's day with my
family and her.
So here you go, the
minute to minute

breakdown of the day.
9:30 a.m. — I wake up on the floor
next to my lied, and wonder how I
ended up there. I drowsily remember
that I went to sleep on the floor thanks
to a combination of desperately needing

a shower, but being much too tired to at
tempt a shower.
Hence, like Vin Baker holding a bas
ketball, I was confused and flustered
and just fell over.
9:33 a.m. — I fall back asleep. I am a
waste.
10 a.m. — 1 wake up again and by
looking in a mirror, realize that male
genitalia has been drawn on my neck.
My friends are hilarious. Good joke,
guys. I desperately wash most of it off in
the shower, hoping to the god of Moth
er's Day that my mom doesn't notice the
sharpie marks.
11 a.m. — I pick up Hot Stuff. By

"pick up", I mean bike together to the
Caltrain station because Spencer has no
car.
Five minutes into our journey, Hot
Stuff gets into a bike accident with an el
derly biker on Palm Drive. It was like the
"If pissing your pants is cool, consider
me Miles Davis" grandma fi-om Billy
Madison was trying to run Hot Stuff off
the road.
12 p.m. — We arrive in San Francis
co. I call mom only to find out that the
family is predictably 45 minutes late.
12:15 p.m. — Hot Stuff and I stum-


Sp«m«r Porter
ble upon Yerba Buena Gardens
(Spanish for " The (i<xxl 1 lerb Gar
dens") and go ice-skating.
I warn Hot StufT that the only
thing I suck at is ice-hockey, thanks
to the ice. I lot Stuff replies "Oh,
don't sell yourself short, you suck at
a lot more than just ice hockey."
12:10 — The scoreboard lights
up: I lot Stuff 1, Idiot Boyfriend 0.
5:00 — We all go oil to dinner
at a lovely little cafe on Russian
Hill. My mom and Hot Stuff hit it
off magnificently, leaving me to
deal with my two brothers and fa
ther. This is the situation that
weirded me out.
With my mom and Hot Stuff
chatting away, presumably about
clothes, perfume, and (insert fe
male conversation topic stereotype
here), the guys all started talking
about Little League, Bob Ryan and
soccer.
We were having our monthly
talk about sports, assured that the
two women would have little inter
est in our arguments over the mer
its ofCarmelo Anthony, the Boston
Celtics and Robb Nen.
But later that night, Hot Stuff
told me that after the obligatory talk
about each other's shoes, they
talked about sports. I was befud
dled. Actually, I just really like the
word "befuddled," and wanted to
get it in a column.
But really, they spent the night
talking about running, crew and
the Daily's sports section. They
talked about how Hot Stuff didn't
realize that she was dating the guy

that wrote the field hockey column
until a month into things.
They talked about strategies for
running sprints vs. distance races.
They talked about how lightweight
crew isn't all about weighing in.
Now, I have never thought that
I was very different from my moth
er — maybe we all feel that way.
But the one thing that separated us
was sports.
While my brother and I quoted
Kenny Mayne's Sports Center clips,
my mom would just semi-politely
roll her eyes. While we played a
menagerie of sports indoors, my
mom was the one who shuttled us
out. And while we played baseball
in the garden, it was my mother
who refused to trim the shrubbery.
But this Mother's Day was in
triguing. My mom was talking
about how athletes train, how they
find the will to win, and how glam
our sports get too much recogni
tion. She was dead on. She sur
prised me.
So while we may not love the
same sports, or watch the same TV
shows, the spirit of competition,
and the motivation that drives
athletes to do their best is inherent
in both of us.
I began the day thinking that
sports was the one venue that
separated me from my mother. In
the end, it was sports that made me
think we were a lot more similar
than I thought.
Well, there is one difference: her
friends tend not to draw male geni
talia on her.

talk about sports, assured that the
two women would have little inter
est in our arguments over the mer
its ofCarmelo Anthony, the Boston
Celtics and Robb Nen.
But later that night, Hot Stuff
told me that after the obligatory talk
about each other's shoes, they
talked about sports. I was befud
dled. Actually, I just really like the
word "befuddled," and wanted to
get it in a column.
But really, they spent the night
talking about running, crew and
the Daily's sports section. They
talked about how Hot Stuff didn't
realize that she was dating the guy

that wrote the field hockey column
until a month into things.
They talked about strategies for
running sprints vs. distance races.
They talked about how lightweight
crew isn't all about weighing in.
Now, I have never thought that
I was very different from my moth
er — maybe we all feel that way.
But the one thing that separated us
was sports.
While my brother and I quoted
Kenny Mayne's Sports Center clips,
my mom would just semi-politely
roll her eyes. While we played a
menagerie of sports indoors, my
mom was the one who shuttled us
out. And while we played baseball
in the garden, it was my mother
who refused to trim the shrubbery.
But this Mother's Day was in
triguing. My mom was talking
about how athletes train, how they
find the will to win, and how glam
our sports get too much recogni
tion. She was dead on. She sur
prised me.
So while we may not love the
same sports, or watch the same TV
shows, the spirit of competition,
and the motivation that drives
athletes to do their best is inherent
in both of us.
I began the day thinking that
sports was the one venue that
separated me from my mother. In
the end, it was sports that made me
think we were a lot more similar
than I thought.
Well, there is one difference: her
friends tend not to draw male geni
talia on her.

Go ahead, laugh at me. Your
personal laughingstock is
writing again, and God knows
he has an embarrassing story
for all of you.
This past Sunday was Mother's Day
of course, and being the wonderful son
I am, I went to San Francisco to meet up
with my family and have a day of rever
ie in the city.
The idea was that we were going to
see a play and go to dinner, but my par
ents got an extra ticket for the play, so
they asked me to invite someone along.
I brought the girlfriend (referred to
as "Hot Stuff' — at her request — from

now on).
Hot Stuff had never
met the parents before,
but that possible awk
wardness wasn't going
to stop me from enjoy
ing mom's day with my
family and her.
So here you go, the
minute to minute

breakdown of the day.
9:30 a.m. — I wake up on the floor
next to my lied, and wonder how I
ended up there. I drowsily remember
that I went to sleep on the floor thanks
to a combination of desperately needing

a shower, but being much too tired to at
tempt a shower.
Hence, like Vin Baker holding a bas
ketball, I was confused and flustered
and just fell over.
9:33 a.m. — I fall back asleep. I am a
waste.
10 a.m. — 1 wake up again and by
looking in a mirror, realize that male
genitalia has been drawn on my neck.
My friends are hilarious. Good joke,
guys. I desperately wash most of it off in
the shower, hoping to the god of Moth
er's Day that my mom doesn't notice the
sharpie marks.
11 a.m. — I pick up Hot Stuff. By

"pick up", I mean bike together to the
Caltrain station because Spencer has no
car.
Five minutes into our journey, Hot
Stuff gets into a bike accident with an el
derly biker on Palm Drive. It was like the
"If pissing your pants is cool, consider
me Miles Davis" grandma fi-om Billy
Madison was trying to run Hot Stuff off
the road.
12 p.m. — We arrive in San Francis
co. I call mom only to find out that the
family is predictably 45 minutes late.
12:15 p.m. — Hot Stuff and I stum-


Sp«m«r Porter
ble upon Yerba Buena Gardens
(Spanish for " The (i<xxl 1 lerb Gar
dens") and go ice-skating.
I warn Hot StufT that the only
thing I suck at is ice-hockey, thanks
to the ice. I lot Stuff replies "Oh,
don't sell yourself short, you suck at
a lot more than just ice hockey."
12:10 — The scoreboard lights
up: I lot Stuff 1, Idiot Boyfriend 0.
5:00 — We all go oil to dinner
at a lovely little cafe on Russian
Hill. My mom and Hot Stuff hit it
off magnificently, leaving me to
deal with my two brothers and fa
ther. This is the situation that
weirded me out.
With my mom and Hot Stuff
chatting away, presumably about
clothes, perfume, and (insert fe
male conversation topic stereotype
here), the guys all started talking
about Little League, Bob Ryan and
soccer.
We were having our monthly
talk about sports, assured that the
two women would have little inter
est in our arguments over the mer
its ofCarmelo Anthony, the Boston
Celtics and Robb Nen.
But later that night, Hot Stuff
