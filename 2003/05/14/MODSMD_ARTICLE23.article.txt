# Meet the parents fiasco leads to touching insight
## 
### 
Go ahead, laugh at me. Your
personal laughingstock is
writing again, and God knows
he has an embarrassing story
for all of you.
This past Sunday was Mother's Day
of course, and being the wonderful son
I am, I went to San Francisco to meet up
with my family and have a day of rever
ie in the city.
The idea was that we were going to
see a play and go to dinner, but my par
ents got an extra ticket for the play, so
they asked me to invite someone along.
I brought the girlfriend (referred to
as "Hot Stuff' — at her request — from

now on).
Hot Stuff had never
met the parents before,
but that possible awk
wardness wasn't going
to stop me from enjoy
ing mom's day with my
family and her.
So here you go, the
minute to minute

breakdown of the day.
9:30 a.m. — I wake up on the floor
next to my lied, and wonder how I
ended up there. I drowsily remember
that I went to sleep on the floor thanks
to a combination of desperately needing

a shower, but being much too tired to at
tempt a shower.
Hence, like Vin Baker holding a bas
ketball, I was confused and flustered
and just fell over.
9:33 a.m. — I fall back asleep. I am a
waste.
10 a.m. — 1 wake up again and by
looking in a mirror, realize that male
genitalia has been drawn on my neck.
My friends are hilarious. Good joke,
guys. I desperately wash most of it off in
the shower, hoping to the god of Moth
er's Day that my mom doesn't notice the
sharpie marks.
11 a.m. — I pick up Hot Stuff. By

"pick up", I mean bike together to the
Caltrain station because Spencer has no
car.
Five minutes into our journey, Hot
Stuff gets into a bike accident with an el
derly biker on Palm Drive. It was like the
"If pissing your pants is cool, consider
me Miles Davis" grandma fi-om Billy
Madison was trying to run Hot Stuff off
the road.
12 p.m. — We arrive in San Francis
co. I call mom only to find out that the
family is predictably 45 minutes late.
12:15 p.m. — Hot Stuff and I stum-
