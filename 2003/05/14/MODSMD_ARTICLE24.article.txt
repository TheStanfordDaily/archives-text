### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While many predicted April to
be the month No. 7 Stanford
blazed past its competition, the
Cardinal continued its flawless run
through May with its eighth con
secutive victory by beating St.
Mary's 10-1 last night at Sunken
Diamond.

Basebaul
Tuesday. No. 7 Stanford 10, St. Mary's 1

The win opened a seven-game
homestand on the heels of a per
fect 7-0 road trip for Stanford (36-
14, 16-5 Pacific 10 Conference),
who thoroughly dominated the
overmatched Gaels (18-33-1,8-18-
1 West Coast Conference) from
the start. It also continued the mo
mentum the Cardinal has rebuilt
after a home series loss to No. 18
Arizona and an embarrassing
home loss to Santa Clara two
weeks ago.
As a bonus, Stanford seemingly
got two wins on Tuesday as it
watched No. 6 Arizona State drop
the second game of its league se
ries with Oregon State, reducing
the Cardinal's magic number to
two games fora co-conference title
and to three games for the out
right title.
With the Sun Devils' loss, Stan
ford can clinch its first Pac-10
championship since 2000 by
sweeping UCLA at home this
weekend in its final league series of

the year — or by getting any com
bination of Stanford wins and ASU
losses that adds up to three.
The Sun Devils have seven con
ference games remaining, includ
ing four in the next six days.
Last night, however, Stanford
went about its business the way a
conference champion would. Get
ting a quality start from sopho
more Mark Jecmen, who scattered
three hits and allowed just one run
in three innings, the Cardinal
rolled over the Gaels immediately
and then seemed to call off the
dogs after the fifth.
Jecmen set the tone, striking out
four against just one walk and left
the game with a 5-1 lead after three.
Stanford scored twice in the
first on an RBI single by senior
Ryan Garko — the first of four
RBI on the night for the catcher
and an RBI double off the bat of
freshman Jed Lowrie. The Cardi
nal added three in the second,
getting help from St. Mary's as
sophomore Donny Lucy — start
ing in right field in place of junior
Carlos Quentin, who missed his
first game in two years —
reached on a throwing error to
lead off the inning.
Four batters later with die bases
loaded, junior Brian Hall deliv
ered a two-run double down the
left field line to score Lucy and se
nior Tobin Swope. Then Garko
added a sacrifice fly, putting Stan
ford safely ahead for the remain
