# Kings return to their roots
## 
### 
As the Kings collapsed yesterday against the
Mavericks, falling behind 3-2 in the confer
ence semifinals, I couldn't help thinking of
how it used to be.
Growing up a Bulls fan, I experienced entirely too
much winning. 72-10? Six NBA Championships?
Being in the United Center for the Game Six victory
over Utah in 1997?
In the midst of all that winning, I had to find some
way to mitigate all that joy and celebration.
So, back in my junior-high heyday (tell me I did
not just say that), in addition to watching all the Bulls
games, I started following the Vancouver (now Mem-

phis) Grizzlies and the Sacramento
Kings, because they had cool players
and because it would actually sur
prise me when they won.
I own a Bobby Hurley Sacramen
to Kings jersey only because I
couldn't get Lionel Simmons'. It cost
me $9.99. I also tried to get Duane
Causwell's, but to no avail.
Say what you will about those truly

horrendous Kings teams, but you must admit they
had some terrifically entertaining players. L-Train
Simmons? Bobby Hurley? Tyus Edney? Mahinoud
Abdul-Rauf? Olivier Saint-Jean (aka Tariq Abdul-
Wahad)? Olden Polynice? These guys are priceless
characters, if not especially good at basketball.
Sports Illustrated's 1997 NBA Preview offers this
incomparable gem: "Bolstering the shooting-guard
and small-forward spots will be first-round pic k Olivi
er Saint-Jean, the first French national to play in the
NBA. At San Jose State last year, Saint-Jean led the
Western Athletic Conference in scoring, with 23.8
points per game.
'We've probably never had a player with his explo
sivenessand athleticism here,' [director of player per
sonnel Jerry] Reynolds says."
The Kings were horrible, but they were always
amusing. The modern-day Denver Nuggets are even
worse than those old Kings teams, but they don't ap
peal to me, because they have no style. The old Kings
teams, man, they were losers, but they were losers in
an anachronistic sort of way. It was refreshing.
Every year they'd throw together a mish-mash of a
roster, which was guaranteed to be horrible, but
they'd put a new spin on it, hoping that change for
change's sake would alter the franchise's fate.
Head coach Eddie Jordan, when asked by a re
porter what fans could expect from the 1997-1998
Kings (who finished 27-55), said that the half-court of
fense would be "a combination of old Knicks, old
Celtics, new Bulls and new Jazz." You can't make this
stuff up.
And the modern Kings, while they are very good,
still have the old-school Sac-town spirit. Without
Chris Webber on the court, you get a little better sense
of what a wacky bunch of losers this team could be.
Don't tell me you can't see Hedo Turkoglu, Scot Pol
lard, ever-"injured" Brent Price and Damon Jones


Mark Thoma
suiting up alongside Duane
Causwell and Terry Dehere back
iu the day. Heck, current bench

warmer Lawrence Funderburke
did suit up with those guys once
upon a time. If Vlade Divac wasn't
such an unstoppable ground
bound force, he'd be on that list
too.
But maybe you're not con
vinced. Maybe you think this

Kings team has moved on and has
forgotten its wacky past. Maybe
you think I'm grasping at straws,
bagging on a now-professional
Kings franchise that has moved be
yond all that nonsense.
For you, sir, 1 have only one
thing to say.

Decorative point guard Mateen
Cleaves, out on injured reserve,
wearing his Michigan State
warmup suit on the bench and
waving a towel like his career de
pends on it (which it does).
Yeah, this team knows it roots.
Even in defeat, without their best

player, they are still, undeniably
Kings.
