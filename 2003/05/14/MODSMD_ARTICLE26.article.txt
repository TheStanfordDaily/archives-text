Freshman Amber Liu helped me No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
power past Louisiana-Monroe and Michigan in the first two rounds of the
NCAA Championships, clinching both Cardinal victories. Liu, currently
ranked No. 4 in the nation, has won 13 of 16 matches heading into Thurs
day's Round of 16 match against Harvard and was recently named the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.

Junior Jonny Ash was named Pac-10 Player of the Week after hitting
.545 (6-for-11) in No. 7 Stanford's three-game sweep at California
last weekend. Ash, who grew up in Oakland, enjoyed a nice home
coming of sorts, ripping Cal pitching for two doubles, a triple and two
RBI while getting on base at a .643 clip in the series. Ash was also
flawless defensively at third base, handling five chances.
