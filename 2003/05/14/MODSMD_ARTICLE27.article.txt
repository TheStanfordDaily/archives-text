Lack of Sleep is as Dangerous as Driving Drunk

Have trouble falling asleep? Feel
ing sleepy all day (not just during
lecture)? If you suffer from these
or any chronic sleeping disorders,
Stanford provides valuable re
sources at the Stanford Sleep Clin
ic. The first of its kind, it was estab
lished in the early 1970s by Dr.
William Dement, who is known by
undergrads for his course "Sleep

and Dreams." According to the clinic, 40 percent
of adults are so sleepy during the day that their
daily activities are affected, and at least 18 percent
experience this on a regular basis. Studies have
shown that sleep deprivation is as dangerous as
driving drunk. With impending midterms and
problem sets, a good night's sleep is key to being
healthy and productive, as doctor mom would say.
A Sun with Two North Poles?
Almost three years ago, for almost a month, the
sun had two North poles. "It sounds impossible,
but it's true," said space physicist Pete Riley. Nor
mally our star has a south and a north pole. How
ever the sun goes through an 11-year cycle in
which its magnetic field reverses. The March 2000
event was part of that upheaval. Using a super
computer named Blue Horizon and data from a
spacecraft, investigators are studying how these
changes affect life on earth. Changes in the sun's
magnetic field can potentially cause solar flares,
which can disrupt communication satellites on
Earth.
More Anticancer Drugs on the Horizon

The good news:
at present there
are almost 10
times as many
anticancer
drugs in clinical
trials than there
were 15 years
ago. The bad
news: many of
these agents are
targeted super
ficially toward
subpopulations
of patients or tu-

mors and ineffective for the general cancer popu
lation and sometimes dangerous when combined
with other agents. According to a review published
in Nature, the Food and Drug Administration has
been hard-pressed in establishing safety and effi
cacy, since companies and patients are very inter
ested in having the drugs reach the market. More
over, targeted therapies have not always been suc
cessful because of faulty models. The review called
fora coherent policy to coordinate basic and clini
cal trials and allow all sides to benefit fully from
better research.
Tasting Red?
Synesthesia is the blending of different senses, like
tasting a color or seeing a smell. What sounds like
pieces from a poem is a real phenomenon. For
decades scientists thought the phenomenon was
fakery or due to one's misinterpretation of his or
her feelings. Current research, which includes
brain MRIs, has shown that in some individuals
the sensory perceptions actually get mixed up.
The most accepted theory is that a sensation caus
es cross-activation, that is, two normally separate
areas of the brain elicit activity in each other. Stud
ies of synesthesia are providing clues on how the
brain works and how thought and language may
have evolved.
Material that Responds to Light
Here is something about the phenomenon known
as the photocoustic (or optocoustic) effect. If you
shine light on some materials, they make an audi
ble sound. There are materials at the nanometer
scale that will not only sound off but actually ignite
when illuminated with light. Due to their enhanced
photothermal properties, these materials pose
many interesting applications. A group of investi
gators at the University of Science and Technology
in Hong Kong published a study in Nano Letters
describing silicon wires. They believe such wires
can be used in smart ignition systems, self-destruc
ting systems for electronic devices, nanosensors,
and nanostructural or nanophase reformation.
Super Alloys
Japanese researchers have developed alloys with
superior properties. Interestingly, they used
computers to predict the properties of the mate
rials before making them. Alloys are composites
of different elements — steel is an alloy of iron
and carbon. The investigators made a super alloy
consisting of titanium, tantalum, niobium, zirco
nium, vanadium and oxygen, the composition of
which was determined via software. These super
alloys have properties ranging from ultra-high
strength to super elasticity. They can potentially
be useful for high-precision instruments and
medical equipment.
