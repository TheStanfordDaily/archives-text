# Are the days of free music numbered?
## Apple seeks to revolutionize online music 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the recording industry continues
to clamp down on users of music-shar
ing programs such as KaZaA and Mor
pheus, Apple Computer introduced a
new service at the end of last month
that makes downloading songs from
the Internet both easy and legal.
The iTunes Music Store, which is
part of Apple's new iTunes 4 software,
offers a selection of 200,000 songs cost
ing 99 cents each to download. Unlike
services set up by the major recording
labels, such as Pressplay, Rhapsody
and Music Net, Apple's service doesn't
work on a subscription basis. Once you
buy a song, it's yours to keep.
One of the best things about Apple's
music service is its simplicity. To begin
shopping for songs, you click on a new
tab in iTunes labeled music store. This
brings up the home page of the service
in the adjacent panel. You can browse
through music by genre, and there are
lists of new releases, exclusive tracks,
pre-releases and staff favorites. Lists of
the top 10 songs and album downloads
are on the right hand side of the page.
Browsing through the screens is simi
lar to using a Web browser: there are
buttons for forward, back and home.
There's also a search box that allows
you to look for specific artists, songs or
album titles.
Click on an album title and iTunes
displays a list of songs on the album
and a photo of the album cover. Dou
ble-clicking song names gives you a 30-
second, high-quality excerpt. To actu
ally buy music, you need to sign up for
an account and give Apple your credit
card details. After that, a "buy song"
button downloads the song straight
into iTunes. On a network or cable
modem connection, it doesn't take
more than five or 10 seconds for songs
to download, a far cry from free music
services like KaZaA.
It's easy to see how you could easily
become addicted: once your details are
stored in the system, the process of
buying music requires almost no
thought at all. Although the flat price
per song makes the service easy to use,
there's no difference in price between
songs that are short or long. For ex
ample, "Hurricane," by Bob Dylan, at
eight-and-a-half minutes costs the
same as the three-minute-long "In
God's Country" by U2. There's also 110
difference in price between current hits
and older classics.

You can also purchase music al
bums, which generally cost $9.99. One
snag here is that if you've bought one or
two songs from an album, and want to
buy the complete album later on, you
still have to shell out the full cost.
With 200,000 songs, the iTunes li
brary is big enough to keep most peo
ple going fora while. Many of the big
names are there, including Coldplay,
Eminem, Bob Dylan, The Eagles and
U2. Some artists also have specially cre
ated homepages within iTunes, with
exclusive tracks and videos.
Despite the selection, there are still
popular artists that are nowhere to be
found, including The Beatles, Britney
Spears, Madonna and the Rolling
Stones. The selection of soundtracks is
also somewhat limited.
Instead of using the MP3 standard,
files in the iTunes store are encoded
using the ACC standard, which is said
to be higher quality than MP3 and have
smaller file sizes. But in practice, there
seems to be little difference in the qual

ity of MP3 and ACC.
The way iTunes manages copy pro
tection is more liberal than current
music subscription services. Once
you've bought a song, there's no sub
scription to pay. iTunes also allows you
to burn CDs of a song as many times as
you like. But there's a limit of burning
10 CDs of an identical playlist — a pre
caution to stop people from mass dis
tributing albums. Downloaded music
can also be played on up to three dif
ferent Macs and it's an easy process to
authorize and deauthorize the comput
ers songs can be played on. The service
can't stop you from burning your songs
onto CD and then ripping them back
off the same CD to create MP3 files,
however.
Finally, one of the most fun things
about the new version of iTunes is that
you can publish your play list, allowing
other Macs on the network to access
your music. If you are sharing music in
the ACC format, those other Macs will
need to be authorized by you to play

the music. In libraries and depart-'
ments on campus, the sharing of music
using the new version of iTunes has al-i
ready begun.
Three new models of Apple's popu-j
lar iPod player accompanied the
launch of iTunes: a 10GB model thatj
stores around 2,500 songs for $299, a
15 GB model that stores around 3,700
songs for $399 and a 30GB model that!
holds 7,500 songs for $499. The new
iPods are compatible with PGs as well
Macs.
A major downside of iTunes at pre-t
sent is that it's only available on the;
Mac, though Apple plans to roll out aj
Windows version of iTunes and thei
Music Store later in the year, reports inj
The New York Times said.
Although Apple claims that its Music
Store sold over 1 million songs during
its first week, it is difficult to tell whether
it will catch on with students as long as
free services such as KaZaA stick;
around. But it looks like Apple's offer-;
ing could be a model for the future.

ble-clicking song names gives you a 30-
second, high-quality excerpt. To actu
ally buy music, you need to sign up for
an account and give Apple your credit
card details. After that, a "buy song"
button downloads the song straight
into iTunes. On a network or cable
modem connection, it doesn't take
more than five or 10 seconds for songs
to download, a far cry from free music
services like KaZaA.
It's easy to see how you could easily
become addicted: once your details are
stored in the system, the process of
buying music requires almost no
thought at all. Although the flat price
per song makes the service easy to use,
there's no difference in price between
songs that are short or long. For ex
ample, "Hurricane," by Bob Dylan, at
eight-and-a-half minutes costs the
same as the three-minute-long "In
God's Country" by U2. There's also 110
difference in price between current hits
and older classics.

You can also purchase music al
bums, which generally cost $9.99. One
snag here is that if you've bought one or
two songs from an album, and want to
buy the complete album later on, you
still have to shell out the full cost.
With 200,000 songs, the iTunes li
brary is big enough to keep most peo
ple going fora while. Many of the big
names are there, including Coldplay,
Eminem, Bob Dylan, The Eagles and
U2. Some artists also have specially cre
ated homepages within iTunes, with
exclusive tracks and videos.
Despite the selection, there are still
popular artists that are nowhere to be
found, including The Beatles, Britney
Spears, Madonna and the Rolling
Stones. The selection of soundtracks is
also somewhat limited.
Instead of using the MP3 standard,
files in the iTunes store are encoded
using the ACC standard, which is said
to be higher quality than MP3 and have
smaller file sizes. But in practice, there
seems to be little difference in the qual

ity of MP3 and ACC.
The way iTunes manages copy pro
tection is more liberal than current
music subscription services. Once
you've bought a song, there's no sub
scription to pay. iTunes also allows you
to burn CDs of a song as many times as
you like. But there's a limit of burning
10 CDs of an identical playlist — a pre
caution to stop people from mass dis
tributing albums. Downloaded music
can also be played on up to three dif
ferent Macs and it's an easy process to
authorize and deauthorize the comput
ers songs can be played on. The service
can't stop you from burning your songs
onto CD and then ripping them back
off the same CD to create MP3 files,
however.
Finally, one of the most fun things
about the new version of iTunes is that
you can publish your play list, allowing
other Macs on the network to access
your music. If you are sharing music in
the ACC format, those other Macs will
need to be authorized by you to play

the music. In libraries and depart-'
ments on campus, the sharing of music
using the new version of iTunes has al-i
ready begun.
Three new models of Apple's popu-j
lar iPod player accompanied the
launch of iTunes: a 10GB model thatj
stores around 2,500 songs for $299, a
15 GB model that stores around 3,700
songs for $399 and a 30GB model that!
holds 7,500 songs for $499. The new
iPods are compatible with PGs as well
Macs.
A major downside of iTunes at pre-t
sent is that it's only available on the;
Mac, though Apple plans to roll out aj
Windows version of iTunes and thei
Music Store later in the year, reports inj
The New York Times said.
Although Apple claims that its Music
Store sold over 1 million songs during
its first week, it is difficult to tell whether
it will catch on with students as long as
free services such as KaZaA stick;
around. But it looks like Apple's offer-;
ing could be a model for the future.

Shopping for songs with Apple's iTunes is a snap. You can browse through music by genre, lists of new releases, exclusive tracks,
pre-releases and staff favorites. Navigating the screens is similar to using a Web browser, and a search box allows you to look for
specific artists, songs or album titles. At 99 cents per song, iTunes is in a likely position to become an online favorite.
As the recording industry continues
to clamp down on users of music-shar
ing programs such as KaZaA and Mor
pheus, Apple Computer introduced a
new service at the end of last month
that makes downloading songs from
the Internet both easy and legal.
The iTunes Music Store, which is
part of Apple's new iTunes 4 software,
offers a selection of 200,000 songs cost
ing 99 cents each to download. Unlike
services set up by the major recording
labels, such as Pressplay, Rhapsody
and Music Net, Apple's service doesn't
work on a subscription basis. Once you
buy a song, it's yours to keep.
One of the best things about Apple's
music service is its simplicity. To begin
shopping for songs, you click on a new
tab in iTunes labeled music store. This
brings up the home page of the service
in the adjacent panel. You can browse
through music by genre, and there are
lists of new releases, exclusive tracks,
pre-releases and staff favorites. Lists of
the top 10 songs and album downloads
are on the right hand side of the page.
Browsing through the screens is simi
lar to using a Web browser: there are
buttons for forward, back and home.
There's also a search box that allows
you to look for specific artists, songs or
album titles.
