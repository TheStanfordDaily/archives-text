# Women working toward a better health:
## Health awareness week begins 
### 
While students are notorious for
putting aside health concerns,
millions of young women are
being encouraged this week to
listen to their bodies and visit their health
care provider as part of National Women's
Health Week, which

began last Sunday.
Each year, healthcare
organizations across the
nation work to raise
awareness about simple
ways in which women can
improve their emotional
and physical well being.
According to Secretary
of the Department of

Health and Human Services (HHS),
Tommy G. Thompson, the awareness week
gives "a perfect opportunity for women to
talk to a doctor or health care professional
about their health and get the information
and care that they need."
Although most young women are in rea
sonably good health, research shows that
adopting a healthy regime can help to pre
vent ailments affecting women in later years,
such as arthritis, osteoporosis and diabetes.
Surgeon General Richard Carmona says
regular visits to the doctor must be a top pri
ority.
"While medical research and treatment
are enabling women to live longer and
healthier lives than ever before, far too many
women die each year of diseases that could
be treated if detected early on," he said.
What you can do to stay healthy
• Balanced and nutritious diet — Eat a va

riety of foods, including fruit, vegetables,
animal or vegetable protein (such as meat,
chicken, fish and soya) and complex car
bohydrates (wheat pasta and whole grain
products). Limit saturated fats and try to
include dairy products, such as milk,
cheese and yogurt to boost your body's cal
cium intake. This will help to strengthen
bones and teeth, and can offset the devel
opment of osteoporosis (thinning of the
bones) in later years.
• Regular exercise — Research shows 30
minutes or more a day can help to reduce
stress and depression as well as improve
overall physical health. Good cardiovascu
lar exercises include walking, running, cy
cling and swimming.
• Quit smoking — Women who smoke
have increased risk of developing liver,
colorectal and cervical cancer, as well as
coronary heart disease and stroke. Lung
cancer is currently the top cancer killer
among American women. There were an
estimated 65,000 deaths in 2002 from
lung cancer, according to the HHS.
Smoking can also increase the risk of in
fertility, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage
and early menopause, while pregnant
women who smoke can cause harm to
their unborn child.
• Drink in moderation — According to
the American Institute for Cancer Re
search, women should limit their alcohol
intake to no more than one drink per day
— and strongly advises against binge


Frondn* Miller
drinking. Research suggests that
increased alcohol consumption
puts women at higher risk of de
veloping breast cancer and cirrho
sis of the liver.

• Regular check-ups — Women
should have a pap smear every one
to three years if sexually active or
older than 21. Health practition
ers also advise tests for chlamydia
and other sexually transmitted dis
eases if you are 25 or younger and
sexually active. Your physician can
also provide information on differ
ent contraceptives useful toward

practicing safe sex.
• Immunizations — Stay up to date
with vaccinations and remember to
have a tetanus-diphtheria shot every
10 years. You can also talk to your
doctor about whether you need He
patitis B shots.
