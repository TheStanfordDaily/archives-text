# What it takes to be an Olympic athlete

### GOLNAZ ALEMI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hopefully, the next battle the
world will be involved in will be
the 2004 Olympics. Set to occur
in Athens, the 2004 Olympics
promises to be a spectacle not to
be missed. From August 13 to
the 29, 28 sports — ranging
from archery to wrestling —
will be showcased at 37 venues.
Not everyone can compete in
the Olympics. And those who
can, or have, will confess that it
takes more than just good genes
or natural athletic inclinations to
make it big. One such Olympian
and a Stanford graduate student
granted us an interview to reveal
what it really takes to be compet
itive at the most anticipated
sports program ever.
While a master's student in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, Rikki Rikardsson, now 25,
competed in the 2000 Olympics
in the 100-meter fly and freestyle
for his native Iceland. Although
he did not earn a gold medal, he
came out of the competition with
lessons and experiences that
outweighed the honor of one
medal.
"It was a huge honor for me
to represent my small country
and to get a chance to re-evalu
ate my goals and achievements

in light of standing competi
tion," he said.
Rikardsson has been swim
ming since 1988 but the bulk of
his hard work came after he re
ceived a call from the Olympic
Committee notifying him of his
invitation to compete in the 2000
Olympics. By this time he was in
the U.S. but still maintained con
tact with his mentor and coach
from Iceland, Petteri Laine.
From overseas, Laine
coached Rikardsson via e-mail.
Rikardsson did not have the ad
vantage of having a live coach
motivate him while he was train
ing in the pool, so he had to find
other ways to motivate himself
and to track his progress.
Needless to say, Rikardsson
found the inspiration and dedi
cation to put in four-hour prac
tices a day in addition to keeping
up with his studies.
Training
The basic strategy Rikardsson
used to prep himself for the
Olympics was to follow a strict
training regiment consisting of
exercises as well as rest periods
to lessen the chance of injury.
The following is a sample train
ing cycle that Rikardsson ad
hered to.
