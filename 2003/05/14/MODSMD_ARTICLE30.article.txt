# What it takes to be an Olympic athlete
## 
### GOLNAZ ALEMI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hopefully, the next battle the
world will be involved in will be
the 2004 Olympics. Set to occur
in Athens, the 2004 Olympics
promises to be a spectacle not to
be missed. From August 13 to
the 29, 28 sports — ranging
from archery to wrestling —
will be showcased at 37 venues.
Not everyone can compete in
the Olympics. And those who
can, or have, will confess that it
takes more than just good genes
or natural athletic inclinations to
make it big. One such Olympian
and a Stanford graduate student
granted us an interview to reveal
what it really takes to be compet
itive at the most anticipated
sports program ever.
While a master's student in
electrical engineering at Stan
ford, Rikki Rikardsson, now 25,
competed in the 2000 Olympics
in the 100-meter fly and freestyle
for his native Iceland. Although
he did not earn a gold medal, he
came out of the competition with
lessons and experiences that
outweighed the honor of one
medal.
"It was a huge honor for me
to represent my small country
and to get a chance to re-evalu
ate my goals and achievements

in light of standing competi
tion," he said.
Rikardsson has been swim
ming since 1988 but the bulk of
his hard work came after he re
ceived a call from the Olympic
Committee notifying him of his
invitation to compete in the 2000
Olympics. By this time he was in
the U.S. but still maintained con
tact with his mentor and coach
from Iceland, Petteri Laine.
From overseas, Laine
coached Rikardsson via e-mail.
Rikardsson did not have the ad
vantage of having a live coach
motivate him while he was train
ing in the pool, so he had to find
other ways to motivate himself
and to track his progress.
Needless to say, Rikardsson
found the inspiration and dedi
cation to put in four-hour prac
tices a day in addition to keeping
up with his studies.
Training
The basic strategy Rikardsson
used to prep himself for the
Olympics was to follow a strict
training regiment consisting of
exercises as well as rest periods
to lessen the chance of injury.
The following is a sample train
ing cycle that Rikardsson ad
hered to.
Macro cycle
The macro cycle was formed
from several seven week-long meso
cycles. The aim was to qualify to tfie
2000 European Olympics Champi
onships in Helsinki.
The seven-week cycle ended
with a meet or a time trial. Even
though every week had its main
goal, time was allocated for race
pace and speed work. The training
cycle also consisted of weight lifting
was also present every week all the
way to the main competition. The
last weight training was done two to
three days before the meet. Here is
the meso cycle in general:

week I i Busk- aerobic work, technique and weights,
! busy.- endurance
week 2 Aerobic endurance, weights basic endurance
week 3 AnaerTh, weights, maximum eodsiraosc
week 4 V02 mux weights, specific JX'»v.r
week 5 Lactate tolerancc weights, maximum power
week 6 Lactate peak weights,
week 77 Taper nnd meet weights, ijjht weight)

Micro cycle
A week formed from two micro
cycles. One started from Monday
morning to Wednesday evening
and another from Thursday morn
ing to Saturday morning. Saturday
afternoons and Sundays were off.
Pool training lasted usually from 45
to 90 minutes. The total yardage
was quite low, between 1,500 to
4,000 yards per training. A weekly

program looked something like the
following:

Morning Evening
mon Weights Medium
intensity
tue Speed High intensity
wed Weights Low intensity
thu Medium intensity Speed
fri High intensity Low intensity
sat Weights Rest
sun Rest Rest

In addition to these cycles,
Rikardsson also weight trained.
Basic endurance weight training
was used to increase core body
strength, maximum endurance
weight training was used to increase
size. The last weight training set,
specific power, was geared toward
mimicking the 50-meter freestyle
and fly pace.

Nutrition
While training for the (Mympics,
Rikardsson ate anything and every
thing. His low-fat diet also consisted
of vegetables and fruits.
"It's important to be balanced
and not to cut out any food groups
like meats," he said.
Words of wisdom
Four years have passed since
Rikardsson's stint at the Olympics.
However, he is still very much ac
tive, playing sports and clocking in
hours at the gym. His training at the
Olympics provided him good
lessons for making sure that his ac
tivities do not put his body at risk of
injury.
"I try to alternate my workouts,
especially weight training workouts,
because it is important to give your
body adequate time for rest and
healing," he said. As a rule of
thumb, he said, one should never
do two lifting sessions within 24
hours.
He mentioned that many ath
letes put themselves at risk by not
following their doctor's orders of
resting and stretching.
"Your doctor tells you to rest for
a reason and your trainer tells you
to stretch to protect yourself from
injuries," he said. "They aren't stu
pid."
Rikardsson emphasized that to
succeed, one must be faithful to his/
her own goals as well as have disci
pline and focus. Additionally, one
must have confidence to persevere.
"I always believe that it is better
to try and fail then to fail to try."
