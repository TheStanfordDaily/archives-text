# Survey: students rate academics highly
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In the University's recently re
leased survey on "The Freshman
Year at Stanford," students re
sponded in a largely positive light
when asked about their academic
experiences. Scoring particularly
high were academic rigor, intel
lectual stimulation and quality of
teaching by professors. Students
were less satisfied with faculty
contact outside the classroom and
with the quality of teaching assis
tants.
More faculty-student
interaction desired
In regards to faculty contact,
31 percent of students said they
were "dissatisfied," while 23 per
cent said they were "very satis
fied."
Sophomore Bobby Williams
said, "Since the faculty are in a po
sition of power and superiority,
they are already a bit threatening,
in the sense that freshmen, or any
students for that matter, are un
likely to feel welcome to freely ap
proach them."
Sophomore Tom Hanada dis
agreed, saying that he thought
faculty members were very ap
proachable.
"The only real problem I've
ever had meeting with faculty
were when they had hours that
were at times I just could not
meet," he said.
Director of Freshman and
Sophomore Programs Sharon
Palmer acknowledged that there
was some dissatisfaction among
students in this area of Stanford
life.
"One of the things we're trying
to do with all of our programs is to
help build relationships between
faculty and students that are on
going," Palmer said.
She added, "I would expect
that students who get to know a
professor well through a seminar
and then feel comfortable going
to that person later for advice in
office hours or at other
times .. . probably feel that their
•satisfaction with academics is

high," she continued. "This is one
of those areas that our programs
are really targeting."
Sophomore Gina Hsieh con
curred with Palmer's outlook on
the situation and commented
that, until taking her first intro
ductory seminar this quarter, she
had "not really interacted with
faculty."
"My classes were bigger and 1
did not feel inspired to approach
the professors," she said. "In
generic classes like physics, all you
can really ask about are problems,
for which you can go to the TA."
However, John Bravman, vice
provost for undergraduate edu
cation and dean of
Freshman / Sophomore College,
explained how faculty could take
the initiative to increase their in
teraction with undergraduates.
"I know the hallmark of many
small schools is faculty / student
interaction," he said. "It is a fact
of life that we are a medium
sized research university ... I
would like to see us utilizing our
residents more for this, which is
why I started Freshman /
Sophomore College four years
ago. We did that to demon
strate, under the right circum
stances, it is another way for stu
dents to meet faculty and that
you can interact with them in a
comfortable way."
According to Beatriz Maga
loni, an assistant professor of po
litical science, faculty-student in
teraction inside the classroom
due to seminar-size classes might
make the need for outside inter
action less pressing.
"The dynamics of the [semi
nars are] focused more on class
participation and discussion, and
students get to interact much
more with the professors and
classmates," she said. "I have not
had too much interaction with
the students outside of class, how
ever. The in-class interaction I be
lieve is good, and I believe this in
itself is sufficient."
University President John
Hennessy brought up the con
cern that faculty interaction
through programs such as semi

nars might not equally affect stu
dents in all academic fields.
"When you look at the data,
you see that [participation] is not
uniformly distributed across dis
ciplines, so we may need to do a
better job on ensuring that [sci
ence and engineering] students
understand the importance of
participating in those seminars,"
he said.
According to the survey, 75
percent of those in the humani
ties and 65 percent of natural sci
ences students took a freshman
seminar, while only 56 percent of
those in the social sciences stu
dents and 56 percent of engineer
ing students did.
A more striking disparity man
ifested in terms of ethnicity, as
over 60 percent of Asian Ameri
can, Latino and white students
took seminars, while only 39 per
cent of African American students
did.
"The statistic from the survey
is a self-selected sample, and thus
not necessarily reflective of actual
applications and enrollments,"
Palmer said. "Our historical data
shows that while a lower percent
age of African Americans in a par
ticular class at Stanford took in
troductory seminars or Sopho
more College when compared to
percentages of other ethnic
groups, the overall representa
tion of each ethnic group in the
population of all students who
took seminars or Sophomore
College has been close — and is
getting closer — to the represen
tation of each group within the
entire class."
In terms of working to remedy
any identified disparities in the
distribution of seminar participa
tion, Palmer said that her office
would "work with various advis
ing constituencies — AAs,
HPACs, PAAs, PAE mentors,
etc. — to make sure both that we
understand their concerns and
they understand the seminar
programs and to work with facul
ty to address known issues relat
ing to things like scheduling or
student interests in planning our
curriculum."

Mixed reactions to TAs
Another significant area of
concern was instruction by teach
ing assistants, in which 20 percent
of students expressed they were
"dissatisfied" and 27 percent
were "very satisfied."
Students particularly noted
troubles with TAs in math and sci
ence classes.
"I think the TAs in the fuzzi
er classes have been a lot bet
ter," said Rachel Cook, a
sophomore. "I have also run
into a lot of problems with TAs
who don't speak English or
have trouble communicating
the materials to the students,
especially in math and sciences.
But I have had other courses
where the TAs were great, so it
is definitely dependent on the
course."
Bravman said that Stanford
has made efforts in recent years to
address the concerns of students
about TAs, but that it has no spe
cific changes that it plans to im
plement for the future.
"The University has devel
oped in concert with department
chairs and deans a series of efforts
to train TAs and let them know
how critically important their
work is and how we depend on
them," Bravman said. "We have
made progress there, but as new
generations of graduate students
come in, we must renew our ef
forts."
While Stanford students have
voiced concerns over certain
areas of their academic experi
ence, many areas, such as acade
mic rigor, intellectual stimulation
and quality of teaching by profes
sors have overwhelmingly been
approved.
"I'd say that the current situa
tion in other areas sounds about
right," said Jack Chung, a sopho
more. "In terms of stimulation
and rigor, I feel that is really up to
the individual. If you really want
to improve on areas, Stanford has
the resources to help you out. If
you are not feeling it in these
areas, then that is largely your
problem."
