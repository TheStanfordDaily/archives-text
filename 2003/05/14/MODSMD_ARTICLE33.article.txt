# Preparation for scholarships starts early
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
Late last fall, senior Alison Kamhi found
herself in a small room in Oregon playing
Taboo with a roomful of strangers. A state fi
nalist for the Rhodes Scholarship, Kamhi and
the 12 others were waiting fora committee to
decide who amongst them would progress to
the national level, a decision that Kamhi
found as predictable as a horse race.
"It's so arbitrary we decided we might as
well play Taboo for it," Kamhi said.
Her journey to this point had been, not by
chance but by months of work and prepara
tion.
Kamhi, like so many other students think
ing about applying for the Rhodes and similar
scholarships, began the application process
months earlier when she began drafting her
essays.
But even before Kamhi had decided to
apply fora Rhodes, Stanford staff at the Over
seas Resource Center office had started getting
ready for her and the other potential appli
cants by making students aware of the scholar
ship opportunities.
"We do a lot of outreach to faculty saying
'Please give us names [of potential appli
cants],' " said John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center.
Fora Rhodes hopeful, it is never too early
to start thinking about the application
process. The campus deadline for the
Rhodes, Mitchell and Marshall scholarships
is Sept. 24 at 4 p.m.
"We're at a disadvantage because we're on

a quarter system," Kamhi said. "By the time
school starts, it's all due."
Every year the Overseas Resource Cen
ter will receive 200-300 names of potential
applicants. On average, 35 to 40 people will
end up applying for the Rhodes. According
to students and administrators, the applica
tion process is an experience in itself with a
workload comparable to a class.
"We make it worse," laughed Pearson
when asked about the workload. "If you
come in and start talking about the Rhodes,
we say, 'Why aren't you talking about the
Marshall?' "
After submitting completed applications in
the fall, applicants then have to go through an
intensive process that includes asking the cam
pus Rhodes committee to endorse the applica
tion.
It was the campus interview that Kamhi
found otle ofthe most difficult.
"The questions they ask you â€” I don't
know where they came from," she said.
Pearson noted, however, that the intense
interview is to prepare the students, as few ap
plicants are rejected at the campus level.
Applications that don't make it past campus
endorsement tend to come from students who
appear very late in the process and don't have
a clear idea of what they are going to do with
the scholarship, he said. Even then, few people
are turned away.
"The most we've rejected is three," Pearson
said.
Preparations have already begun, even
more so this year than in the past. During the
height of the Silicon Valley tech boom, the

number of applicants dropped to under 20,
the lowest number since the late 70s. But this
year roughly 30 pre-applications have already
been turned in.
Junior Dave Kale is one of the students al
ready looking ahead to the fall. He said the
process has already helped him think about
his future.
"This is starting to get me thinking about
grad school and what I want to do with my de
gree," he said.
According to Kale, one of the most useful
parts of the application process so far has sim
ply been to visit the Overseas Resource Center.
"Pearson was really easy to talk to, very sup
portive and knows anything you want to
know," Kale said.
When Kale asked what he should be doing
during the spring quarter, Pearson told him to
get references and to start looking at pro
grams.
"Just a lot of little things 1 wouldn't have
thought of on my own," Kale said.
Although Kale said he finds the experience
humbling and the competition fierce, he
thinks the Rhodes presents a chance to meet
amazing people.
"Win or lose, I'll still feel like it was a good
experience," Kale said. "It's the kind of honor
you shouldn't feel bad if you don't get."
As for Kamhi, the senior did not win Taboo
or the Rhodes. Instead, she will be studying in
Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship next
year.
Her advice to next year's applicants?
"Go for it, because you never know what
you might get," she said.
