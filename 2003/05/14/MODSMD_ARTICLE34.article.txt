# Legendary photographer showcased at Cantor

### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Although Eadweard Muybridge is
primarily known as a major force in in
stantaneous photography, his pho
tographs have contributed to a variety
of fields.
"Muybridge has often been talked
about as though he was three differ
ent people because he's got multiple
bodies of work that have been treated
in different ways," said scholar Re
becca Solnit, author of "River of
Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and
the Technological Wild West" in the
lecture "Muybridge: The Motion
Studies and Other Experiments with
Time — Panoramas, Sequences, Se
ries and those Clouds," delivered at a
recent Muybridge symposium.
The Cantor Arts Center is current
ly showing an exhibition on Muy
bridge, entitled, "Time Stands Still:
Muybridge & the Instantaneous Pho
tography Movement." It features a
plethora of photographs from Muy
bridge's motion work as well as at
tempts by other photographers of the
late 19th century to create instanta
neous photography.
Muybridge has garnered this
much of the University's attention in
part because a great deal of his
groundbreaking work was closely
connected to Leland Stanford. The
relationship between Muybridge and
Leland Stanford, known to some de
gree by many Stanford students,
began with a bet. Leland Stanford
hired Muybridge in order to prove,
through his photography, that at
some point in its gallop, all four of a
horse's hooves are off the ground.
Muybridge used Leland Stan
ford's horses in many of his motion
studies at his motion studio in Palo
Alto, including one series of pho
tographs featuring Leland Stanford
Jr. riding, which was chosen as the
image used on publicity for the exhi
bition.
The relationship between Muy
bridge and Stanford was tumul
tuous. Leland Stanford hired an au
thor to write a book based on Muy
bridge's motion studies, the out
come of which caused strife between
Muybridge and Leland Stanford.
Eventually, Muybridge left Palo
Alto, moved to the East Coast and
continued his work at the University
of Pennsylvania.
Despite his contributions to a va
riety of other fields, Muybridge's
most famous works are his motion
studies, many of which he completed
in his motion studio in Palo Alto. He
developed a technique whereby he
could photograph events occurring
faster than is visible to the human
eye — such as the moment in which

all four of a horse's hooves do not
touch the ground. His motion stud
ies, several of which are on display at
Cantor, feature a variety of animals t
and humans in motion,
walking or engaging in other physKJ
cal activity.
Besides an extensive presentation
of Muybridge's motion studies, the ex
hibition includes information on the
different techniques used by the pho
tographers like the use of albumen, or
egg whites, as a key element of the
photographic process.
The exhibition also includes some
of Muybridge's equipment, or replicas
of it. One of his inventions, the
zoopraxiscope, spun a wheel of images
around, creating something similar to
a short film clip or animation. Hj*.
work in motion study has been hailf&sj
as a precursor to modern motion pic
tures. '
The ability to take pictures of events!
happening faster than the eye can see
also had important ramifications for
science. On display is a copy of Dar
win's last book on evolution, which
used instantaneous photography to,
capture images of facial expressions
signifying human emotions, which
Darwin posited were closely connect-,
ed to animal behavior.
"Muybridge was fascinated with sci
entific phenomena for their own
sake," Solnit said. While Muybridge's
motion work positively impacted sci
ence, he was involved in nature-ori
ented scientific work even before his
motion studies. Solnit explained thatj
Muybridge had spent several months
in Yosemite taking pictures of the land
and especially some of the glacial for
mations there.
"I think the kind of science he was
doing was science for arts' sake," she
added.
Besides his famous work with mo
tion, Muybridge was also an important
contributor to landscape photography
and fie did watershed work in panora
mas as well.
"If you wanted to treat each of Muy
bridge's genres as a different project,
he'd have to be a lot more than
different people" Solnit added refer
ring to his involvement in commercial
and ethnographic photography as
well.

and humans in motion,
walking or engaging in other physKJ
cal activity.
Besides an extensive presentation
of Muybridge's motion studies, the ex
hibition includes information on the
different techniques used by the pho
tographers like the use of albumen, or
egg whites, as a key element of the
photographic process.
The exhibition also includes some
of Muybridge's equipment, or replicas
of it. One of his inventions, the
zoopraxiscope, spun a wheel of images
around, creating something similar to
a short film clip or animation. Hj*.
work in motion study has been hailf&sj
as a precursor to modern motion pic
tures. '
The ability to take pictures of events!
happening faster than the eye can see
also had important ramifications for
science. On display is a copy of Dar
win's last book on evolution, which
used instantaneous photography to,
capture images of facial expressions
signifying human emotions, which
Darwin posited were closely connect-,
ed to animal behavior.
"Muybridge was fascinated with sci
entific phenomena for their own
sake," Solnit said. While Muybridge's
motion work positively impacted sci
ence, he was involved in nature-ori
ented scientific work even before his
motion studies. Solnit explained thatj
Muybridge had spent several months
in Yosemite taking pictures of the land
and especially some of the glacial for
mations there.
"I think the kind of science he was
doing was science for arts' sake," she
added.
Besides his famous work with mo
tion, Muybridge was also an important
contributor to landscape photography
and fie did watershed work in panora
mas as well.
"If you wanted to treat each of Muy
bridge's genres as a different project,
he'd have to be a lot more than
different people" Solnit added refer
ring to his involvement in commercial
and ethnographic photography as
well.
