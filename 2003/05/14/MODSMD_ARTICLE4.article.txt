# 33 films in three days
## Film festival shows off student talent 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Thirty-three original films, ranging in length from 10 to 20
minutes, will be shown on three consecutive nights in Cubberley
Auditorium starting tomorrow as part of the Stanford Student
Film Festival. This annual event highlights (he work of student
filmmakers and has traditionally drawn substantial interest from
students.
The festival has been a regular event for the past four years
and has grown in size each year. Stanford Film Scx iety members
had been hosting screenings of original films independently since
1995, although not under the auspices of a festival.
"It [the festival | has changed and grown in many ways over just
the past few years," said Kirk Shimano, a senior and co-president
ofSFS." 11 really is a great event and I'm hoping t hat we can match
last year's unprecedented success."
This success can be measured by the festival's attendance. I-ast
year, Cubberley was filled on each of the three nights of screen
ing. Another gauge of the festival's popularity is the large number
of Stanford students who are involved with the festival.
"I haven't calculated the actual probability [because] I'm a
fuzzy, but I bet that almost every Stanford student — whether
they realize it or not — knows someone who was involved in the
production of a film," said senior and SFS Co-President Ben
Dudek.
The featured films come from three sources: the Student Film
makers Workshop, the SFS Film Grant program and open sub
missions.
"A third of the films come from SFW, a yearlong program in
which the more experienced members of the SFS mentor new
filmmakers, teaching them how to use the filming equipment and
apply the basic ideas of film theory," said Shimano, who assisted
in organizing the workshop.
"The next third of the films come from the SFS Film Grant
program. Film Grant recipients use the same equipment as SFW
members and are encouraged to participate in some community
building events, but they tend to be more experienced and pro
duce the majority of the film on their own."
The final portion of the festival comes from open submissions.

These films were made without any assistance from die SFS and
were submitted to a jury early last month.
Mike Pappas, a senior, was awarded one of the SFS giants
along with his film partners early this year by submitting a script
idea and then going-through an interview process. The gi ant cov
ered filming costs and guaranteed a spot in the festival. Pappas
said the filmmaking process was grueling but well worth it.
"It took us probably about 15 hours to write most of the
movie," he said. "The bulk of the filming was done over five days
during spring break, and editing and post-production has taken
a long time — about a month of sessions twice a week from three
to six hours each. But we are very happy with how it turned out."
Students sometimes hope to use the festival as a springboard
for entry into other festivals or for adaptation into a feature
length film. Some Stanford graduates whose work was entered in
the festival have gone on to pursue film school or a career in the
industry.
Hie festival itself, however, is not competitive.

"We're not out to find the 'best'
film or to single out one film above
everything else," Shimano said.
Rather, the goal of the festival is to
provide both the means to create and
an outlet to showcase student film.
Junior Meredith Narrowe,
this year's festival coordinator,
pointed to the variety of films of
fered and the rare opportunity to

see the work of student filmmak
ers as compelling reasons to at
tend the event.
"The festival is a unique oppor
tunity to see student film on the
Stanford campus," she said. "This
year's directors have put a lot of
time into their films, and the results
.. . include documentaries, dra
matic pieces, animated works,
comedic farces, music videos and
experimental films."
The event begins at 7:30 tomor
row and continues on Friday and
Saturday night. Admission is free.
