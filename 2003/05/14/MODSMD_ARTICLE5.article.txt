# Town Hall addresses Alcohol Policy
## 
### ERIK WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of five key Stanford administra
tors took the hot seat yesterday evening at a
special ASSU Town Hall meeting about the
University's new Alcohol Policy.
It was an effort on the part of the Uni
versity to reach out to students about the re
cently announced decision to ban alcohol at
events in all-freshman residences.
Over a dozen concerned students con
vened in Tresidder Union last night for the
Town Hall meeting. The list of panelists in
cluded Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, Director of Residential Ed
ucation Jane Camarillo, Director of Vaden
Health Promotion Ser-vices Carole Pertof
sky, Manager of Alcohol and Substance

Abuse Education Ralph Castro and Dean
of Freshman and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims.
"11 became clear since the University an
nounced the new Alcohol Policy that there
needed to be greater dialogue between stu
dents and administrators," said ASSU Vice
President Joey Natoli, a sophomore, who
co-organized the meeting with ASSU Pres
ident Nadiya Figueroa, a junior.
At the meeting, administrators attempt
ed to set the record straight regarding the
changes to the University Alcohol Policy
and answer student concerns that they had
been left out of the decision-making
process.
Pertofsky was first to acknowledge that
"the policy change occurred in a process
that was not preferable," referring to the

small level of student involvement in the
process of reviewing and changing the Al
cohol Policy.
According to Pertofsky, eight student
members of the Campus Alcohol Advisory
Board were consulted about the decision.
Other panelists agreed that changes to
University policy merit a process that in
cludes the involvement of the general stu
dent body.
However, in the case of the recent
changes to the University Alcohol Policy,
Camarillo says there were a number of is
sues that pressured the University into
streamlining student input out of the deci
sion-making.
"Timing did not allow us to consult with
students on a broader level," Ca
marillo said. "It's not a great excuse,
but it's what really happened."
She cited the need to act imme
diately, a decision based on the ur
gency of the health risks posed by
excessive drinking and on the need
to inform next year's residential
staff of the changes before they
made commitments to uphold the
policy.
Administrators have been dis
puting claims that residential staff
will be called upon to enforce the
new policy by searching for alcohol
in their dorms and reporting viola
tions.
"We don't have the resources to
put an Alcohol Policy enforcer in
every dorm," Lythcott-Haims said.
"We wouldn't want to, even if we
did have the resources."
Camarillo clarified the role that
residential staff would be asked to
play under the new policy, main
taining that enforcement will not be
emphasized over education.
"It is not the expectation that the
role of the RA is to seek out students
violating the alcohol policy," Ca
marillo said.
She added that residential staff
would be expected to intervene in
threatening or predictably dan
gerous behavior and have "a seri
ous conversation with someone
who has clearly made a bad deci
sion about the role alcohol plays in
their lives."
"We made a decision that we
would not cross the threshold into

monitoring drinking in the privacy
of one's room," Awakuni said.
Panelists also fielded questions
from the audience in a subsequent
question-and-answer session.
Responding to a question about
whether there were more changes
on the horizon and whether the
University could be expected to ex
pand the policy to apply to other
residences, Camarillo said, "As long
as students self-regulate, there
won't be a need for the University to
regulate."
Castro, whose work involves ed
ucating students on the responsible
use of alcohol, stressed, "We want
students to think critically about
what they do."
Pertofsky added, "At the same
lime we have seen a rise in the
number of non-drinkers at Stan
ford, we have noticed a minority of
students who engage in reckless
drinking, and those students are
enabled by every other student
around them who chooses not to
intervene."
Administrators also acknowl
edged there were steps the Univer
sity could take to mitigate excessive
student drinking, among them en
hancing student spaces for social
events and sponsoring more alter
natives to parties where alcohol was
a focus.
Camarillo says there is interest
among students in designating sub
stance-free housing that would be
modeled after University theme
houses â€” however, there are cur
rently no plans for this.
The Campus Alcohol Advisory
Board will spin off a new subgroup
specifically overseeing the new Uni
versity Alcohol Policy.
