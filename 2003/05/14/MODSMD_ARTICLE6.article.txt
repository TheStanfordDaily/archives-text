Dr. Robert Gould, president of Physicians
for Social Responsibility, gave a talk yester
day designed to look at war and foreign poli
cy from a public health and environmental
standpoint, addressing how war damages in
frastructures such as water treatment and af
fects mortality and morbidity rates as well as
pollution.
The talk, entitled "The Health and Envi
ronmental Effects of U.S. Military and Foreign
Policy," covered issues spanning from World
War 11 to the war in Iraq. He spoke to a packed
auditorium in Jordan Hall.
Gould has been president of the San Fran
cisco-Bay Area Chapter of Physicians for So
cial Responsibility since 1989 and has been
active in the Peace Caucus of the American
Public Health Association since 1986. He has
co-authored numerous books on the environ
mental and health effects of war and U.S. for
eign policy.

stance to bear witness and speak
on behalf of those who are af
fected by war, and to acknowl
edge the health consequences
and tragedies of the policies of
governments," said medical stu
dent and president of Physicians
for Human Rights Mina Matin,
who was one of the event's orga
nizers.
A major component of Gould's
talk focused on issues related to
nuclear weapons, nuclear testing
and the effects of radioactive
waste — from the dropping of
nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki to current debates on
missile defense systems. Gould
stressed fears of entering into a
new period of nuclear testing.
"The aggressive posture of
building new nuclear weapons is
accompanied by missile defense,"
said Gould, arguing that the
money spent on nuclear testing
could be used on much-needed
public health funding in the Unit
ed States and abroad.
He said that the U.S. has spent
$90 billion since 1983 on missile
defense and that during the Cold
War alone, the U.S. spent an av
erage of $344.1 billion on the mil
itary per year. The current in
crease in military expenditure, he
argues, could instead be used to
remove land mines, improve ac
cess to clean water and fund
health care programs such as
AIDS control and prevention.
These programs, he said, would
cost $2 billion, $10 billion and $21
billion, respectively, and are only
a fraction of America's military

expenditures.
Gould also addressed the af
fects of Agent Orange on both
U.S. veterans and the Viet
namese, the biological weapons
threat, the existence of land
mines in 64 countries and the
short- and long-term outcomes
on health and the environment of
war in Iraq — both during the
first Gulf War and now as a result
of the recent military action in
Iraq.
"Bombs may not kill a lot of
people in the short run, but long
term damage to infrastructures is
a major humanitarian crisis," he
said.
Gould also said that there were
pressing issues within the United
States' borders.
"It doesn't make sense as
physicians that basic health is not
being paid for here and abroad,"
he said.
"Dr. Gould's lecture was perti
nent because it took a look at the
hidden costs of war and foreign
policy that are virtually never ad
dressed by the American media,"
said medical student Navaz
Karanjia, president of the Stan
ford Medical School student
chapter of Physicians for Social
Responsibility, which helped
bring Gould to campus.
"It is important for people to
know how important it is to con
tinue to discuss these issues of
human rights and the effects of
war on our societies in this coun
try and around the world," Matin
said. "By continuing to discuss,
we can move toward real action
and change. We must take the
blindfolds off and really look at
the ugly face of war and the mis
ery that will afflict the injured na
tions for decades afterward."
