### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
New Student Orientation, which has tra
ditionally suffered from a dearth of volun
teers, saw a 75 percent increase in appli
cants this year, thanks to heightened re
cruitment efforts and the presence of the
new dean of freshman and transfer stu
dents, Julie Lythcott-Haims.
"When we counted the names, we
thought we'd done something wrong," said
Lauren Friedman, the head orientation co
ordinator. "We had no idea why we had so
many applicants."
NSO received 215 applications for 125

positions, according to Director of New
Student Orientation Jared Scherer.
"I think a lot of it has to do with Julie,"
Friedman said. "She's had a lot of interac
tion with freshmen and encouraged them
to apply."
Friedman also credited 2002's Orienta
tion for the application surplus.
"I think that this year's orientation was
phenomenal and a lot of freshmen had
great experiences and wanted to come back
and do it again," she said.
The NSO office is also pleased with the
windfall.
