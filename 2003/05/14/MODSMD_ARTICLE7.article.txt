# Record number of students volunteer for Orientation
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
New Student Orientation, which has tra
ditionally suffered from a dearth of volun
teers, saw a 75 percent increase in appli
cants this year, thanks to heightened re
cruitment efforts and the presence of the
new dean of freshman and transfer stu
dents, Julie Lythcott-Haims.
"When we counted the names, we
thought we'd done something wrong," said
Lauren Friedman, the head orientation co
ordinator. "We had no idea why we had so
many applicants."
NSO received 215 applications for 125

positions, according to Director of New
Student Orientation Jared Scherer.
"I think a lot of it has to do with Julie,"
Friedman said. "She's had a lot of interac
tion with freshmen and encouraged them
to apply."
Friedman also credited 2002's Orienta
tion for the application surplus.
"I think that this year's orientation was
phenomenal and a lot of freshmen had
great experiences and wanted to come back
and do it again," she said.
The NSO office is also pleased with the
windfall.
"We're thrilled," Scherer said.
"It's great news for the University,
it's great news for NSO and we just
hope that enthusiasm for the stu
dents who applied continues
through to the fall."
NSO will select 125 Orientation
volunteers and place the rest on a
wait-list.
"We've had quite a few students
apply from Sophomore College,
so the numbers might well fluctu
ate," Scherer said. "They might
pull their names out of the pool."

Due to financial constraints,
NSO can only accommodate a
certain number of volunteers,
who arrive on campus about a
week ahead of the start of Orien
tation.
"We provide housing and food
for all our volunteers, and our
budget only allows for us to bring
back 125 Orientation volunteers
and about 20 community orienta
tion volunteers."
Community Orientation vol
unteers deal specifically with in
troducing students to communi
ty centers on campus, while Ori
entation volunteers are charged
with orchestrating the general
Orientation.
