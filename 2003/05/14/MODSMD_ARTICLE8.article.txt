### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
During last night's ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate meeting, Senator lan
Carmichael, a junior, was elected treasur
er. His responsibilities will include han
dling the Senate's funds that are not des
ignated for the individual Senate com
mittees, including monies used for pro
gramming and the Senate's operating
costs, as well as keeping track of reim
bursements and other financial concerns.
The Senate approved a bill confirming
the Nominations Committee's nomina
tions of students fora variety of commit
tees.
Although the Committee for Student
Life will examine how to keep Full Moon
on the Quad sustained in the future, the

Senate also passed a bill approving fund
ing for this year's incarnation from its dis
cretionary fund.
A representative from Stanford in
Government, Alice Siu, explained the or
ganization's expenditures surrounding
Janet Reno's visit to campus. The organi
zation has been questioned by the ASSU
for exceeding its allotted meal expendi
ture per person. With this new informa
tion, the Senate will propose a bill and
come to a decision next week.
"We didn't anticipate having someone
of that magnitude come in [to speak],"
Siu said in explaining why the organiza
tion deviated from its approved budget.
A comment Dean of Students Morris
Graves made during the Report of the
Deans represented the tone for the meet
ing: "Tilings are winding down."
