## Korea to be 'nuke free' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Bush and newly elected South Korean
President Roll Moo-hyun agreed yester
day that the Korean Peninsula should be
nuclear-weapons free and that the cur
rent standoff with North Korea should be
resolved through peaceful means.
"We're making good progress to
ward achieving that peaceful resolution
... in regard to North Korea," Bush said
in a Rose Garden statement with Roll by
his side.
Roh, who in the past has urged the
United States against slapping economic
sanctions on the North or considering
military force, said that he came to his
meeting with Bush with "both concerns
and hopes in my mind," but that Bush
had dispelled the concerns.
"Now I return to Korea with only
hopes in my mind," Roh said.
The two presidents issued a joint state
ment asserting that their countries "will
not tolerate" nuclear weapons in North
Korea and invited other nations in the re
gion and Russia to help defuse the cur
rent nuclear standoff. The leaders stated
their confidence that peaceful resolution
is possible "while noting that increased
threats to peace and stability on the
peninsula would require consideration of
further steps."
"Escalatory moves by North Korea will
only lead to its greater isolation and a
more desperate situation in the North,"
their statement said.
The "further steps" mentioned in the
joint statement could mean military ac
tion as well as "a lot of things in the tool
box," said a senior administration official
who briefed reporters after the meeting
on condition of anonymity.
The South Koreans, who have wary of

more aggressive action toward North
Korea, accepted that vaguely worded ref
erence because Bush and Roh also agreed
that diplomacy and increasing isolation of
Not th Korea are the preferred tactics, the
official said.
It was the first time the two leaders
had met face to face, after four previous
phone conversations. Their time to
gether included a private tour for Roh
of the White House with an emphasis on
Abraham Lincoln, one of the South Ko
rean leaders' favorite historical figures,
the official said.
Bush said he found Roh "to be an easy
man to talk to. He expresses bis opinions
clearly and he's easy to understand."
The two leaders spoke briefly from the
Rose Garden, which was bright with late
day sunlight, then turned without taking
questions to the residence portion of the
White House for dinner.
Earlier, Roh appealed to the United
States not to rush to a decision to reposi
tion the 36,000 U.S. troops now stationed
in South Korea. His office said in a state
ment that Vice President Dick Cheney
told Roh over lunch that "U.S. troops
should stay in South Korea because they
guarantee security in the region."
U.S. officials did not dispute the account.
Years ago, Roh demanded that U.S.
troops leave but now he is seeking to
delay U.S. proposals to move troops away
from the Demilitarized Zone, which sepa
rates the two Koreas.
Roh told Cheney, "I understand the
principle and necessity of relocation of
American forces in South Korea." But,
be added, such a "realignment of U.S.
forces affects Korean politics and the
economy," according to the South Ko
rean statement.
