NEAR MERIT, Iraq (AP) — Heavily armed U.S.
Army forces stormed into a village near the northern
city of Tikrit in the pre-dawn darkness today, seizing
more than 65 prisoners in a hunt for two "most-want
ed" former Iraqi officials and 13 others.
No one shot at U.S. forces during the raid, U.S.
military officials said.
It was not clear whether the two targets — one of
them in the U.S. "top 55" list and the other in the top
20 — were among those rounded up as some of more
than 500 soldiers involved sealed off the town and
went house to house. The targets were not identified.
"We either surprised them or they're not here
anymore. Hopefully, we surprised them. It still
could be hours before we sort everybody out," said
Maj. Mike Silverman, operations officer for the Ist
Brigade of the 4th Infantry, the Army division that
staged the raid.
The operation had been planned fora week after
U.S. officials received a tip the men were in the area,
known as a hotbed of Baath Party supporters and for
mer high-ranking military officials.
Tikrit is the hometown of deposed Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, and the city and the area around it
are considered strongholds of his support.
Seventeen bricks of plastic explosive were seized
from one house, military officials said, and one man
was apprehended in a sniper's perch toting an AE
-47 assault rifle.
Among those taken into custody were teenage
boys. Each was zip-cuffed and ordered to sit or kneel
on the roads outside their homes.
Eighteen Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 12 How
itzers and 35 armored Humvees secured the area as
forces moved in. Six boats patrolled the nearby
Tigris river during the maneuver, and Apache he
licopters hovered overhead.
Under military rules, the name of the village can
not be released by reporters accompanying U.S.
forces until the operation is over.
