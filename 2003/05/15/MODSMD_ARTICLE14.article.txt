Editorial

Overflowing with dreams and expec
tations — partly due to glory sto
ries from older siblings and teen
movies — each fall a new genera
tion of high school graduates enters coMege
for the first time. With so many hopes and so
much enthusiasm, students are bound to be
disappointed with some aspects of college.
But, other aspects of college may exceed their
imaginations.
Recognizing how much is at stake during a
student's first year of college, Stanford has
committed itself toward ensuring an incredi
ble freshman experience. In order to track its
success, last fall Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims commis
sioned a survey of the Class of 2005. Covering
topics such as personal, social and academic
life and residential and campus environment,
the survey asked the newly-minted sopho
mores how satisfied they were with their first
year at Stanford.
According to the results of the survey, the
University has invested its energy well: 64 per
cent of the students

were "very satisfied"
with their overall ex
perience and rated
it a 6 or 7 out on a
seven-point scale.
Although many fac
tors influence indi
vidual responses to
an opinion poll,
these results still
imply that the Uni
versity is doing a
pretty good job of
keeping freshmen
happy. Such a con
clusion should not

shock anyone, con
sidering the amount of work and innovation
the University has put into this task, especially
in recent years.
The survey did, however, uncover a few
disconcerting developments. For example, al
though a majority of students indicated they
were "very satisfied" in regard to almost all
categories of student life, less than half of stu
dents reported this way when asked if they felt
Stanford "values them as a person." The cre
ator of the survey, Jerold Pearson, who usual
ly works as director of market research at the
Alumni Association, says of the "valued as a
person" category, "[lt's] a very intangible con
cept, and I think it's harder for people to give
superlatives to something like that."
Nevertheless, Lythcott-Haims has said she
plans to make this a key priority for the Office
of Freshman and Transfer Students. Outlin
ing her goals for the future, she states that the
office will work on a range of issues, from
"being very responsive to concerns, to having
warm and meaningful person-to-person in
teractions, to taking an interest in each indi
vidual and his or her situation."
Such a plan is commendable, especially in

Recognizing how much is at stake

their overall experience.

context of the larger picture. After all, the "val
ued as a person" category was not the only blem
ish found in the generally positive results of the
survey. Only 35 percent of the students were
"very satisfied" with faculty advising / involve
ment and I-Hum. In addition, Asian Americans
were approximately 20 percent less likely than
white and Latino / a students to answer that t hey
were "very satisfied" with the overall experience
during their first year at Stanford.
In the categories that need improvement,
there seems to be a common thread: increased
communication. For example, the relation
ship between students and their resident fel
lows is not clearly defined or made known to
students. Otero Resident Fellow Jecl Black
states, "Frosh often feel that there should be
more interaction with the RFs, not realizing
that is not our role. First and foremost, we are
mentors for the staff. We let the resident assis
tants take a leadership role and help them
with whatever they are planning."
In regards to I-Hum, Vice Provost of Un
dergraduate Education John Bravman states,
"Given that this is a

required course...l
clon't know that we
can do much bet
ter." In fact, he
views it to be "a sta
tistical fact" that I-
Hum is "absolutely a
success."
He's half tight. Un
fortunately, the fact
that I-Hum is re
quired does subtract
from its appeal, and
a great deal of stu
dent resistance stems
from this principle.
But by framing his

case thus, Bravman overlooks a key point: de
spite the fact that I-Hum is a required course,
the University can, indeed, do much better to
make I-Hum more appealing to students.
As it stands, many students have little
idea as to why I-Hum is enstated. Whereas
PWR wields a specific agenda and involves
constant student-instructor feedback, the
goals and direction of I-Hum are fuzzy at
best. Lectures sometimes relate only ob
scurely to texts and section, while sections
sometimes relate only obscurely to papers
and tests. I-Hum lacks communication and
interplay between professors, students and
teaching fellows, as well as between lectures,
sections and papers. Its required status only
adds insult to injury.
Freshman year is an important time for col
lege students. Whether students enjoy their
first year can influence and shape their entire
undergraduate lives. Thus, the Office of
Freshman and Transfer Students' proactive
effort to help students make the most of their
freshman year is one that will benefit each in
coming class and, in the long run, Stanford as
a whole.

Editorial

Overflowing with dreams and expec
tations — partly due to glory sto
ries from older siblings and teen
movies — each fall a new genera
tion of high school graduates enters coMege
for the first time. With so many hopes and so
much enthusiasm, students are bound to be
disappointed with some aspects of college.
But, other aspects of college may exceed their
imaginations.
Recognizing how much is at stake during a
student's first year of college, Stanford has
committed itself toward ensuring an incredi
ble freshman experience. In order to track its
success, last fall Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims commis
sioned a survey of the Class of 2005. Covering
topics such as personal, social and academic
life and residential and campus environment,
the survey asked the newly-minted sopho
mores how satisfied they were with their first
year at Stanford.
According to the results of the survey, the
University has invested its energy well: 64 per
cent of the students

were "very satisfied"
with their overall ex
perience and rated
it a 6 or 7 out on a
seven-point scale.
Although many fac
tors influence indi
vidual responses to
an opinion poll,
these results still
imply that the Uni
versity is doing a
pretty good job of
keeping freshmen
happy. Such a con
clusion should not

shock anyone, con
sidering the amount of work and innovation
the University has put into this task, especially
in recent years.
The survey did, however, uncover a few
disconcerting developments. For example, al
though a majority of students indicated they
were "very satisfied" in regard to almost all
categories of student life, less than half of stu
dents reported this way when asked if they felt
Stanford "values them as a person." The cre
ator of the survey, Jerold Pearson, who usual
ly works as director of market research at the
Alumni Association, says of the "valued as a
person" category, "[lt's] a very intangible con
cept, and I think it's harder for people to give
superlatives to something like that."
Nevertheless, Lythcott-Haims has said she
plans to make this a key priority for the Office
of Freshman and Transfer Students. Outlin
ing her goals for the future, she states that the
office will work on a range of issues, from
"being very responsive to concerns, to having
warm and meaningful person-to-person in
teractions, to taking an interest in each indi
vidual and his or her situation."
Such a plan is commendable, especially in

context of the larger picture. After all, the "val
ued as a person" category was not the only blem

survey. Only 35 percent of the students were
"very satisfied" with faculty advising / involve
