# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Stanford vs. fun 
### 
Can you feel it? It's that in
cessant groping again.
All you can see is visions
of hot flesh exposed
through the darkness of the
crowded room where the DJ's
tense turntable gyrations send
waves of sounds that pound off
walls and resonate against your
hot chest. You wish you could take
your clothes off.. . wait, looks like
you already have.
Yes boys and girls, it's the party
known as "Exotic Erotic." Girls,
grab your two articles of clothing
(or less, hopefully); guys, grab
your sock if you think you can fill it.
In case you're completely clue
less or have never attended a Stan
ford party before, Exotic Erotic is
the party to end all parties (680
Lomita, this Saturday, 10 p.m.).
Some quick background: It's the
best party Stanford throws all year,
making it the best party anywhere
south of San Francisco all year. No
more waiting in guest lines for
Hawaiian-themed fiat parties and
cheap beer — it's the only Stanford
party that has been featured in Cos
mopolitan magazine.
Yes, it's time to step away from
the books fora night and give into
that sexual energy that's been
building for ohhhh so long. Exotic
Erotic is not only the most sought
after party of the year, but it is also
one of the best planned and orga
nized college parties in the year.
680 has been saving funds and
planning for this event all year and
is devoting almost $15,000 of
house funds for your pleasure.
According to senior Jesse San
doval, "If you can't get your
groove on at Exotic Erotic, then
there's little hope for you in life."

Senior Brent Schulkin recalls
fondly, "1 thought the only painful
thing about Exotic Erotic was re
moving my 3-inch duct tape skirt
freshman year, but now that the
hair has finally grown back I have
to witness the far worse pain of
hormone-numbing sabotage."

Unfortunately, all is not well in
the Stanford social scene this year.
This "sabotage" Schulkin is allud
ing to is, sadly, our very own Uni
versity administration and Office
of Residential Education's alarm
ingly draconian series of new
"party policies."
Those who have spent at least
one year on campus know that the
party scene sure seemed painfully

dry the last three
quarters. What
exactly hap
pened?
If you haven't
noticed, the ad
ministration and
Res Ed have
moved to fill the
gaps in the Uni-

versity's legal policy (i.e. "covering
their asses to avoid liability"). The
result? Campus social life that has
begun to resemble that of Cal
Tech's.
Allow me to illustrate. The head
honchos horn Res Ed gathered at
680 one night to describe "the
terms" of throwing Exotic Erotic.
After more than an hour and a half
of lecture, we had a list of "require
ments" that lias made the party the
world's most exotic headache.
Members of house staff' had to
write up a 15-page "vision" docu
ment describing how the party
should go. They had to hire over
15 private security guards. They
have to distribute three different
types of wristbands — one for
VI Ps, one for those who are over
21 and one for those who are not.
The party must end precisely at 1
a.m. It was suggested that all resi
dents of 680 remain sober and that
each resident is only allowed two
VIP guests (in our own house!).
Perhaps most humiliating of all
is the fact that all party ideas as well
as advertisements must be pre-ap
proved by the University adminis
tration, which has the right to can
cel the party altogether if they're
not happy.

Do you recall last year when a
huge 20-foot video screen played
cartoon porn? 1 thought it was in
decent but livened up the party.
This year, the University has in
stead requested that we "apply for
such privileges"; and when we sent
a written request, the University
denied it.
It is this attitude the Stanford
administration carries toward its
students — treating us like chil
dren who need to have their ideas
"approved" by someone older —
that makes this year's party life on
campus akin to a Saudi desert.
SAE is on probation, Kappa Sig is
forced to have esoteric guest lists
and strange security, Sigma Chi
parties have been quiet and God
knows what KA is doing over there
at the end of the lake. The point is:
The Stanford administration, by
trying to limit their liability has
transformed a once lively campus
into a miserable place for students
who want a real social life. After all,
you shouldn't be happy to move
away after graduation, right?
Make a change. Take this article
as a starting point to write letters to
editors and talk to people at Res
Ed (Director Jane Camarillo, Resi
dence Deans Anne Dowd and Jim
Cadena and others).
It is our collective responsibility
to create the college social environ
ment we want by letting the ad
ministration know that legalities or
not, its policies are truly affecting
student morale for the worst.
And though I won't be around
next year, I hope to hear good re
ports that the Farm is becoming the
healthy, social and happy place I re
member it being my freshman year.
Whatever you do, don't pass up
the chance to make your presence
felt at Exotic Erotic this Saturday.
And please, try to keep as much as
vou can at home.

gaps in the Uni-

versity's legal policy (i.e. "covering
their asses to avoid liability"). The
result? Campus social life that has
begun to resemble that of Cal
Tech's.
Allow me to illustrate. The head
honchos horn Res Ed gathered at
680 one night to describe "the
terms" of throwing Exotic Erotic.
After more than an hour and a half
of lecture, we had a list of "require
ments" that lias made the party the
world's most exotic headache.
Members of house staff' had to
write up a 15-page "vision" docu
ment describing how the party
should go. They had to hire over
15 private security guards. They
have to distribute three different
types of wristbands — one for
VI Ps, one for those who are over
21 and one for those who are not.
The party must end precisely at 1
a.m. It was suggested that all resi
dents of 680 remain sober and that
each resident is only allowed two
VIP guests (in our own house!).
Perhaps most humiliating of all
is the fact that all party ideas as well
as advertisements must be pre-ap
proved by the University adminis
tration, which has the right to can
cel the party altogether if they're
not happy.

Do you recall last year when a
huge 20-foot video screen played
cartoon porn? 1 thought it was in
decent but livened up the party.
This year, the University has in
stead requested that we "apply for
such privileges"; and when we sent
a written request, the University
denied it.
It is this attitude the Stanford
administration carries toward its
students — treating us like chil
dren who need to have their ideas
"approved" by someone older —
that makes this year's party life on
campus akin to a Saudi desert.
SAE is on probation, Kappa Sig is
forced to have esoteric guest lists
and strange security, Sigma Chi
parties have been quiet and God
knows what KA is doing over there
at the end of the lake. The point is:
The Stanford administration, by
trying to limit their liability has
transformed a once lively campus
into a miserable place for students
who want a real social life. After all,
you shouldn't be happy to move
away after graduation, right?
Make a change. Take this article
as a starting point to write letters to
editors and talk to people at Res
Ed (Director Jane Camarillo, Resi
dence Deans Anne Dowd and Jim

It is our collective responsibility
to create the college social environ
ment we want by letting the ad
ministration know that legalities or
not, its policies are truly affecting
student morale for the worst.
And though I won't be around
next year, I hope to hear good re
ports that the Farm is becoming the
healthy, social and happy place I re
member it being my freshman year.

Can you feel it? It's that in
cessant groping again.
All you can see is visions
of hot flesh exposed
through the darkness of the
crowded room where the DJ's
tense turntable gyrations send
waves of sounds that pound off
walls and resonate against your
hot chest. You wish you could take
your clothes off.. . wait, looks like
you already have.
Yes boys and girls, it's the party
known as "Exotic Erotic." Girls,
grab your two articles of clothing
(or less, hopefully); guys, grab
your sock if you think you can fill it.
In case you're completely clue
less or have never attended a Stan
ford party before, Exotic Erotic is
the party to end all parties (680
Lomita, this Saturday, 10 p.m.).
Some quick background: It's the
best party Stanford throws all year,
making it the best party anywhere
south of San Francisco all year. No
more waiting in guest lines for
Hawaiian-themed fiat parties and
cheap beer — it's the only Stanford
party that has been featured in Cos
mopolitan magazine.
Yes, it's time to step away from
the books fora night and give into
that sexual energy that's been
building for ohhhh so long. Exotic
Erotic is not only the most sought
after party of the year, but it is also
one of the best planned and orga
nized college parties in the year.
680 has been saving funds and
planning for this event all year and
is devoting almost $15,000 of
house funds for your pleasure.
According to senior Jesse San
doval, "If you can't get your
groove on at Exotic Erotic, then
there's little hope for you in life."

Senior Brent Schulkin recalls
fondly, "1 thought the only painful
thing about Exotic Erotic was re
moving my 3-inch duct tape skirt
freshman year, but now that the
hair has finally grown back I have
to witness the far worse pain of
hormone-numbing sabotage."

Unfortunately, all is not well in
the Stanford social scene this year.
This "sabotage" Schulkin is allud
ing to is, sadly, our very own Uni
versity administration and Office
of Residential Education's alarm
ingly draconian series of new
"party policies."
Those who have spent at least
one year on campus know that the
party scene sure seemed painfully

dry the last three
quarters. What
exactly hap
pened?
If you haven't
noticed, the ad
ministration and
Res Ed have
moved to fill the
gaps in the Uni-

versity's legal policy (i.e. "covering
their asses to avoid liability"). The
result? Campus social life that has
begun to resemble that of Cal
