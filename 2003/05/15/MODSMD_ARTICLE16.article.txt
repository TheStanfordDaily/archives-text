The Daily's lack of coverage of ABM jani
tors' rally reflects 'classism and racism'
I was shocked by The Daily's lack of
coverage of the noon time rally by Ameri
can Building Maintenance janitors and
students that took place this past Monday.
Over 70 janitors and students gathered to
demand that University President John
Hennessy take a leadership role in insur
ing the ABM janitors, who clean the aca
demic buildings at Stanford, receive af
fordable healthcare. These workers, on
whom we all depend, are considering
going on strike if their requests for afford
able healthcare are not met.
The Daily was notified of the event with
sufficient lime to send a reporter and fail
ure to even mention this event in Tues
day's paper appears to be more than a case
of negligence, but also a manifestation of
classism and racism within The Daily's ed
itorial staff. The Daily did not consider the
issues facing workers at Stanford signifi
cant enough to warrant sending a re
porter.
I understand that The Daily is a stu
dent-run newspaper and that occasionally
errors are made. But in light of the recent

national controversy over journalistic in
tegrity, it would he in The Daily's interest
to send reporters to cover majot; campus
events.

Editor's Note: The Daily was notified of the
event late Sunday night. This was not sufficient
time to assign the story to a reporter.

Guest column fails to acknowledge plight
of Jewish refugees from Arab countries
In Rula Razek's guest column, "Re
membering the tragic loss of Palestinian
homeland" (May 14), much attention was
brought to the plight of Palestinian
refugees from 1948. However, what she
failed to mention was the plight of Jewish
refugees from Arab countries. With sty
dent groups and the media giving con
stant attention to the Palestinian refugees,
the fact that almost 900,000 jews were ex
pelled from their homes in the Middle
East and North Africa during the same.
time period has been overlooked. Hun
dreds more were murdered in govern
ment-organized rioting. The Arab gov
ernments stripped the Jews of their citi
zenship and confiscated their land and

possessions. The Jewish refugees and their
descendants make up more than half of Is
rael's population today.
In framing the birth of Israel in 1948
exclusively as a Palestinian tragedy, Razek
ignores the suffering of Jewish refugees,
who actually outnumber the Palestinian
ones. I look forward to a day when a Jew
ish and Palestinian state will coexist peace
fully, and people will remember the stories
of both Palestinian and Jewish refugees. II

Middle East's "forgotten" refugees, visit

In the guest column, Razek also un
wittingly makes reference to the
apartheid policies of Palestinians before
the creation of Israel. As she herself
states, though Jews made up 33 percent
of the population, they only had owner
ship over 8 percent of the land, since laws
restricted the location and amount of
land that Jews could buy. Furthermore,
while mentioning that the United Na
tions' partition plan allotted 56 percent of
the British Mandate to Israel, Razek does
not include that 60 percent of this land
consisted of the Negev Desert, inhos
pitable to settlement and agriculture.
Finally, Israel was not declared unilat
erally; the United Nations had earlier ex
plicitly called for the creation of both a

Jewish and Palestinian state. The only rea
son a Palestinian state was not created is
because Jordan and Egypt invaded the
area the United Nations set aside for this
purpose, with Jordan officially annexing
the West Bank in 1950. While the fate of
Palestinians in 1948 is tragic, it is impor
tant to remember the role the Arab coun
tries played in creating this tragedy.

Visits to Cuba are not open to all
It was reported in "Travel policy to halt
alumni study in Cuba" (May 12) that Dun
can Beardsley, director of Stanford's Trav
el/Study Program, said, "The greatest
value was that anybody in the Stanford
community was given the opportunity to
experience Cuba." Beardsley's statement
is not accurate. Only those individuals
judged by the Castro regime to be harm
less or helpful are allowed to visit Cuba.
Human rights activists, labor organizers,
advocates of press freedom, etc. are de
nied visas.
A case in point: Two years ago, Stan
ford planned to have a distinguished aca
demic lead a group to Cuba but the Cuban

regime turned him down because of his
political views. I( is still possible to travel to
( üba under a variety of licenses. Once
there, I would encourage individuals to
get off the "kumbaya" tour and interact
with the victims of Castro, not with his
agents.
