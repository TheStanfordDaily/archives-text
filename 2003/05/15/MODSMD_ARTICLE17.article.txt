pionship as it travels to Gainesville for the
final four rounds of the NCAA team
championship and the NCAA singles
tournament.
Less than a month after capturing the

Pacific-10 Conference regular season title
with a win over rival California, Stanford

the first round, the Crimson pulled off an
upset in defeating 16th-seeded Arizona

Looking down the road, Stanford
could meet one of two Pac-10 conference
foes — fourth-seeded California or fifth
seeded USC - in the semifinals.
While some of the other competitors
are familiar with Florida's humidity, Stan
ford may be facing one of the biggest
physical challenges of the season this
weekend.
Don't tell that to t he Cardinal coaching
staff, though, who feel the heat won't be a
large factor fora team that has been prac

— it's more the humidity that we have to
acclimate to," Stanford head coach Lele
