## Card tennis continues title run 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During the entire season only one
thing has been on the minds of the Stan
ford women's tennis players — winning
another national title.
The top-seeded Cardinal (22-1) will get
the chance to win its third-straight cliam-

pionship as it travels to Gainesville for the
final four rounds of the NCAA team
championship and the NCAA singles
tournament.
Less than a month after capturing the

Pacific-10 Conference regular season title
with a win over rival California, Stanford
swept Louisiana-Monroe and the Univer
sity of Michigan to advance to the third
round and earn a trip to Florida.
The Cardinal will open play today in
the 10-day tournament today at 2 p.m
against No. 17 Harvard. Assuming it ad
vances, Stanford would play the winner of
the quarterfinal contest between No. 9
seed, Kentucky, and the No. 8 seed, Geor
gia, in its quarterfinal match on Saturday.
Harvard (19-3) has been a dominant
force on the East Coast all season long,
beating I'enn for the Ivy League Title a
month ago. The Crimson will carry a
10-match winning streak into the con
test after posting two wins in Tucson to
advance to the third round of the tour
nament.
After beating Oklahoma State 4-1 in
the first round, the Crimson pulled off an
upset in defeating 16th-seeded Arizona
on its home courts in Cambridge, Massa
chusetts last week.
Looking down the road, Stanford
could meet one of two Pac-10 conference
foes — fourth-seeded California or fifth
seeded USC - in the semifinals.
While some of the other competitors
are familiar with Florida's humidity, Stan
ford may be facing one of the biggest
physical challenges of the season this
weekend.
Don't tell that to t he Cardinal coaching
staff, though, who feel the heat won't be a
large factor fora team that has been prac
ticing under a cover of Bay Area clouds
for (lie past months.
"We'll have two full days to acclimate
— it's more the humidity that we have to
acclimate to," Stanford head coach Lele
Forood said. "We've never had problems
in the past because we always remember

to hydrate."
Stanford also fates t he problem
of a somewhat-intimidating atmos
phere surrounding Florida's King
Tennis Complex.
"Florida has a neat little stadi
um, so when you get t here you def
initely feel that you're going to a
big event," assistant coach Frankie
Brennan said.
Obviously, the intensity of
competition Stanford will en
counter will be something wholly
unfamiliar fora team that only
lost once all year long.
But regular season wins mean
nothing in the do-or-die situations
of tournament play.
"It's the old proverbial 'one
match at a time down there' be
cause the seeds don't always hold
up," Forood said. "You can't look
too far ahead."
The conclusion of the team
competition on Sunday will mark
the beginning of the individual
tournaments in singles and dou
bles.
Representing Stanford in the
64-player singles field will be ju
nior Lauren Barnikow, sopho
more Erin Burdette and fresh
men Alice Barnes and Amber
Liu.
The only Cardinal doubles
team in competition will be the tan
dem of Barnikow and Burdette,
which finished 16-1 in conference
play and is currently ranked No. 1
in the country.
One factor that the Cardinal
must contain is the presence of
adrenaline as a result of the cham
pionship setting.
"It's going to be hard to contain
these girls — when you get to
Florida, you start to feel [the ex
citement) by Tuesday," Brennan
said. "You're going to a new place,
so you get excited right way."
Stanford will be even more ex
cited if it emerges with its 13th na
tional title on Sunday.
