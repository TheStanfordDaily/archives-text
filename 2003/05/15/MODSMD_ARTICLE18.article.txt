# Softball opens regional in Alabama
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball coach John Rittman
has been here before with his club. And he
knows what it takes to win.

Softball
Today: No. 17 Stanford vs. UT-Chattanooga in
Auburn, Alabama, 2 p.m.

"You need to pitch well, play tight de
fense, and get the timely hit," he said.
As he's seen over the years, that is ex
actly what the No. 15 Cardinal (40-24) will
need to consistently accomplish starting
this week if its going to find its way back to
the College World Series.
Second-seeded Stanford begins that

quest with a game today against No. 7
seed UT-Chattanooga (35-28) at 2 p.m.
PST in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
This past Sunday, the No. 17 Cardinal
learned of its fate — a trip to the regional
hosted by first seed and No. 16 overall Al
abama.
The Cardinal knows things could have
turned out much worse.
Stanford was sent to what was consid
ered the toughest regional (Fresno State)
in the nation last spring — a site that fea
tured five of the top 17 teams in the nation,
including eventual national champion and
No. 3 seed California. The second-seeded
Cardinal went 1 -2 and was eliminated after
losing to Cal State-Fullerton.
This year, obviously, things are a little
different.

Not only is Alabama the lowest No. 1
seed of all eight regionals, but Stanford
has also already beaten two teams in the
region (No. 4 seed Illinois and No. 3 seed
Massachusetts). They've seen Alabama
and Chattanooga play in person at other
tournaments. And there's only one other
team ranked in the top-25, too (No. 24
Southern Illinois).
Stanford hopes it can take advantage
of what seems to be the easiest road of any
team to Oklahoma City.
"We had no idea what to expect and we
were preparing ourselves for every
thing," senior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"Hut we were happy with where we
ended up and we are just ready to get
going.
The postseason field was ex
panded this year to 64 teams
(rather than the former 48), and
the Pac-10 took advantage.
All eight teams from the confer
ence received bids, including three
No. 1 seeds (Arizona, UCLA and
Washington) two No. 2 seeds (Stan
ford and California), two No. 3
seeds (Arizona State and Oregon)
and one No. 6 seed (Oregon State).
The dominance of the league
created such problems for the
NCAA committee that it was
forced to put one Pac-10 team at
each of the eight regional sites.
"This is a lot better this year,"
Ritter said. "Splitting up the con
ferences obviously helps to create a
fair bracket."
Stanford's regional includes the
Crimson Fide (45-19), Minute
women (36-13), Illini (38-15), No.
5 seed Georgia Tech (36-23), the
No. 6 Salukis (36-12), and No. 8
seed Southern University (19-10).
The Cardinal beat U Mass 2-1 in
the first round of the ASU Fiesta
Bowl Tournament earlier in the
season. Nyberg went the distance
and allowed only five hits.
In early March, Stanford also
defeated Illinois in a thrilling 7-6
victor) - as freshman Catalina Mor
ris hit a go-ahead double in the top

of the seventh and senior pseudo
closer Maureen LeCocq pitched
the final inning for the save.
Stanford plans on using these
close wins as a lesson heading into
the tournament.
"I remember that both teams
gave us really close games," Ny
berg said. "That just reminds us
that anything can happen and we
need to be ready for every game
we play."
Ritter knows he won't be taking
anything for granted.
"In my seven years at Stanford
we have been a No. 1 seed three
times, a three seed once, and a two
seed three times," Rittman said.
"No matter what, you are going to
have to beat some really good
teams to get to the College World
series — that is just a fact."
Morris, meanwhile, has been
out with a stress fracture in her rib
since May 3. Ritter still isn't sure
whether his star center fielder will
be able to play this week. She's
Stanford's sparkplug as the leadoff
hitter and is batting .335 with
seven homers and 11 stolen bases.
If Morris is unable to go, Stan
ford will need to look to its other
freshman standout, shortstop
Lauren Lappin, who is hitting .335
with two home runs and 15 RBI.
Another likely candidate for in
creased production might be ju
nior catcher Jessica Allister, who
leads the Cardinal with 11 homers
and 40 RBI heading into the
weekend.

has also already beaten two teams in the
region (No. 4 seed Illinois and No. 3 seed
Massachusetts). They've seen Alabama
and Chattanooga play in person at other
tournaments. And there's only one other
team ranked in the top-25, too (No. 24
Southern Illinois).
Stanford hopes it can take advantage
of what seems to be the easiest road of any
team to Oklahoma City.
"We had no idea what to expect and we
were preparing ourselves for every
thing," senior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"Hut we were happy with where we
ended up and we are just ready to get
going.
The postseason field was ex
panded this year to 64 teams
(rather than the former 48), and
the Pac-10 took advantage.
All eight teams from the confer
ence received bids, including three
No. 1 seeds (Arizona, UCLA and
Washington) two No. 2 seeds (Stan
ford and California), two No. 3
seeds (Arizona State and Oregon)
and one No. 6 seed (Oregon State).
The dominance of the league
created such problems for the
NCAA committee that it was
forced to put one Pac-10 team at
each of the eight regional sites.
"This is a lot better this year,"
Ritter said. "Splitting up the con
ferences obviously helps to create a
fair bracket."
Stanford's regional includes the
Crimson Fide (45-19), Minute
women (36-13), Illini (38-15), No.
5 seed Georgia Tech (36-23), the
No. 6 Salukis (36-12), and No. 8
seed Southern University (19-10).
The Cardinal beat U Mass 2-1 in
the first round of the ASU Fiesta
Bowl Tournament earlier in the
season. Nyberg went the distance
and allowed only five hits.
In early March, Stanford also
defeated Illinois in a thrilling 7-6
victor) - as freshman Catalina Mor
ris hit a go-ahead double in the top

of the seventh and senior pseudo
closer Maureen LeCocq pitched
the final inning for the save.
Stanford plans on using these
close wins as a lesson heading into
the tournament.
"I remember that both teams
gave us really close games," Ny
berg said. "That just reminds us
that anything can happen and we
need to be ready for every game
we play."
Ritter knows he won't be taking
anything for granted.
"In my seven years at Stanford
we have been a No. 1 seed three
times, a three seed once, and a two
seed three times," Rittman said.
"No matter what, you are going to
have to beat some really good
teams to get to the College World
series — that is just a fact."
Morris, meanwhile, has been
out with a stress fracture in her rib
since May 3. Ritter still isn't sure
whether his star center fielder will
be able to play this week. She's
Stanford's sparkplug as the leadoff
hitter and is batting .335 with
seven homers and 11 stolen bases.
If Morris is unable to go, Stan
ford will need to look to its other
freshman standout, shortstop
Lauren Lappin, who is hitting .335
with two home runs and 15 RBI.
Another likely candidate for in
creased production might be ju
nior catcher Jessica Allister, who
leads the Cardinal with 11 homers
and 40 RBI heading into the
weekend.
