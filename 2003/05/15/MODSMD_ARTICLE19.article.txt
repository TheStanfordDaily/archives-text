# Young rises to the top
## 
### 
Jason Young got his first taste
of The Show Monday night,
when the Colorado Rockies
called him up from AAA affil
iate in Colorado Springs.
He pitched five innings against
the lowly New York Mets, givng up
eight hits, five runs and two walks
whilte striking out five — includ
ing Timo Perez to strand runners
at the corners in the third inning.
Yeah, he got saddled with the

loss, but he
pitched a good
game.
None of the
stats mentioned
above are that
amazing, I under
stand. But Mon
day night, you
see, was the first

time a friend of mine made it to the
major leagues — and he made it in
my hometown.
That's the amazing part.
I met Jason Young in the fall of
my sophomore year, when he was
finishing up his last courses here.
I le had just signed a contract with
the Rockies a few days before the
start of school, before the team lost
his rights. Another friend of mine
was on the baseball team and in
troduced us.
We joked around briefly about
the Rockies — I had worked for
the team during my high school
years as an usher and a member of
the grounds crew that ran the tarp
out for rain delays.
Needless to say, we were on

quite different paths as to our base
ball futures — mine had reached
its peak as an avid fan while his ca
reer was really only beginning.
As the Rockies' top pick, he was
invited to Denver that winter to
work out with members of the
team and to have some rehab work
on his shoulder. He asked for my
phone number and said he'd give
me a call when he had some free
time.
1 gave him the number but
didn't really expect anything to
come of it. Yet I had hardly been
home fora day when he called me
up —he needed to get some
Christmas gifts for his folks but
didn't know where to go in Den
ver.
1 picked him up and took him
downtown. Along the way he told
me stories of Pedro Astacio's club
house antics, of Todd Helton's
practical jokes, of all the things
about professional sports that you
imagine but never really know
about.
(OK, not all the things. But you
get the idea).
It was a glimpse of a world that
I, like every other kid that plays
Little League, had imagined my
self in years ago, but rarely since.
We walked around downtown
as he looked fora gift for his dad
and I looked for something for my
sister. He tried to help me out,
though his selections were always a
bit too generous.


Matt Babin
(Much as 1 love my sister, I
don't have the giant signing bonus
to pay tor gifts with).
We hung out a few other times
over the vacation, with the last time
being a dinner at my house for the
Duke-Stanford basketball game.
I invited over a few other
friends from school and a friend of
mine who goes to Duke. (So we
would have someone to heckle, ob
viously). That friend plays soccer
for Duke, and she started talking
to JY about collegiate athletics as I
went up to c heck on dinner.
A few minutes later she came
storming up the stairs, glaring at
me.

"You didn't tell me lit* was here
with the Rockies!" she shouted at
me.
Apparently their conversation
had gone something like this:
Margaret: "So, you played
sports at Stanford?"
JY: "Yeah, I played baseball."
Margaret: "I love college athlet
ics — 1 mean I've loved sports for
ever. So what are you here tor?"
JY: "Well, I'm here to get some
work done for rehab on my shoul
der."
Margaret: "Ah. So what are you
looking at doing now that you're
out of school?"
JY: "Well if the rehab goes al
right I'd like to keep playing base
ball."
It was at that point that she un
derstood what was going on, I
think.

And it seems that on Monday
night his dream to keep playing
baseball was kept alive.
The Rockies' current manager,
(Hint 11 urdle, was quoted in a Den
ver paper as saying," 1 told him not
to go house-hunting, but if he does
well tonight, he gets the ball
against the Expos on Saturday."
For people who have followed
him from Stanford to Salem to
Asheville to Colorado Springs to
Denver, that's good to hear.
And with enough good outings,
who knows how far the dream
could go.

my sophomore year, when he was
finishing up his last courses here.
I le had just signed a contract with
the Rockies a few days before the
start of school, before the team lost
his rights. Another friend of mine
was on the baseball team and in
troduced us.
We joked around briefly about
the Rockies — I had worked for
the team during my high school
years as an usher and a member of
the grounds crew that ran the tarp
out for rain delays.
Needless to say, we were on

quite different paths as to our base
ball futures — mine had reached
its peak as an avid fan while his ca
reer was really only beginning.
As the Rockies' top pick, he was
invited to Denver that winter to
work out with members of the
team and to have some rehab work
on his shoulder. He asked for my
phone number and said he'd give
me a call when he had some free
time.
1 gave him the number but
didn't really expect anything to
come of it. Yet I had hardly been
home fora day when he called me
up —he needed to get some
Christmas gifts for his folks but
didn't know where to go in Den
ver.
1 picked him up and took him
downtown. Along the way he told
me stories of Pedro Astacio's club
house antics, of Todd Helton's
practical jokes, of all the things
about professional sports that you
imagine but never really know
about.
(OK, not all the things. But you
get the idea).
It was a glimpse of a world that
I, like every other kid that plays
Little League, had imagined my
self in years ago, but rarely since.
We walked around downtown
as he looked fora gift for his dad
and I looked for something for my
sister. He tried to help me out,
though his selections were always a
bit too generous.

(Much as 1 love my sister, I
don't have the giant signing bonus
to pay tor gifts with).
We hung out a few other times
over the vacation, with the last time
being a dinner at my house for the
Duke-Stanford basketball game.
I invited over a few other
friends from school and a friend of
mine who goes to Duke. (So we
would have someone to heckle, ob
viously). That friend plays soccer
for Duke, and she started talking
to JY about collegiate athletics as I
went up to c heck on dinner.
A few minutes later she came
storming up the stairs, glaring at
me.

"You didn't tell me lit* was here
with the Rockies!" she shouted at
me.
Apparently their conversation
had gone something like this:
Margaret: "So, you played
sports at Stanford?"
JY: "Yeah, I played baseball."
Margaret: "I love college athlet
ics — 1 mean I've loved sports for
ever. So what are you here tor?"
JY: "Well, I'm here to get some
work done for rehab on my shoul
der."
Margaret: "Ah. So what are you
looking at doing now that you're
out of school?"
JY: "Well if the rehab goes al
right I'd like to keep playing base
ball."
It was at that point that she un
derstood what was going on, I
think.

And it seems that on Monday
night his dream to keep playing
baseball was kept alive.
The Rockies' current manager,
(Hint 11 urdle, was quoted in a Den
ver paper as saying," 1 told him not
to go house-hunting, but if he does
well tonight, he gets the ball
against the Expos on Saturday."
For people who have followed
him from Stanford to Salem to
Asheville to Colorado Springs to
Denver, that's good to hear.
And with enough good outings,
who knows how far the dream
could go.
