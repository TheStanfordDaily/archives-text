# Stanford soccer grads starting to progress in MLS
## Making their mark 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
When your team reaches the College
Cup two years in a row, you know you've
got some talented players. Such is the
case for Stanford soccer — and the rest
of the international soccer community is
starting to take notice.
The Major League Soccer draft was
held in early February, and four play
ers instrumental in the Cardinal's run
to the 2002 NCAA title game were se
lected.
The nearby San Jose Earthquakes
rounded up three of those four in draft
ing Todd Dunivant (first round), Roger
Levesque (third round) and Johanes
Maliza (fifth round). Taylor Graham was
picked up by the Kansas City Wizards in
the fourth round.
This talented group brings the total
number of Stanford alumni in the MLS
to six. The other two active athletes in
the league are Simon Elliot and Ryan
Nelson, who play for the Los .Angeles
Galaxy and D.C. United, respectively.
While midfielder Maliza and forward
Levesque have begun their pro careers
on the injured list for the Earthquakes,
defender Dunivant has had an immedi
ate impact.
The ex-Stanford captain scored in his
first-ever MLS game against the Col
orado Rapids in the 22nd minute — a
goal which turned out to be the game
winner.
Dunivant (who was selected sixth

overall) has been a fixture in the Earth
quakes' lineup thus far; he has started all
five games-and is one of the team's cor
ner-kick specialists.
"Dunni has the skill and composure to
be an international level player," said
Dunivant's ex-coach at Stanford, Bret
Simon. "He has made a remarkably
smooth transition to the pros, though
few who have seen him play over the last
few years are surprised."
That no one is surprised with Duni
vant's quick ascension at the profession
al level is something of an understate
ment. The MLS came calling after his
junior season but Dunivant opted to
stay in school — with the dream of
bringing a first-ever national champi
onship to Palo Alto.
"I believed that with a good senior sea
son, I would have even more options of
playing professionally," he said. "Re
gardless, I owed too much to my team
mates and coaches to ever leave them.
"I never even considered it."
Dunivant's unwavering loyalty was re
warded earlier this year when the he led
Stanford to its second-consecutive Col
lege Cup appearance. He also garnered
All-America honors and finished fourth
on the Cardinal's all-time list in games
played (81).
Meanwhile, Graham is trying to work
his way into the Kansas City lineup.
"It is extremely difficult to get playing
time in this league and right now my goal

is to get into a couple of games," he
said.
And if there's anyone that
won't doubt Graham's persever
ance, it's Simon. He watched
Graham develop from a college
walk-on to one of the best players
in the nation and expects to see a
stellar professional career unfold
for another one of Stanford's Ail-
Americans.
"[Graham] is a great leader who
improved every year on the Farm,"
Simon said. "[llis] concentration,
self-discipline and effort levels are
exceptional."
When Levesque and Mali/a
heal up and find a spot on the
Quakes' active roster, the trio of
former Card players should try to
make their mark in the profession
al ranks together.
Levesque, who is recovering
from ACL surgery at the mo
ment, was the 2001 Pat-10 Player
of the Year. In his four years on
the Farm, he racked up Stan

ford's third-highest career assist
total (30) and sixth-highest point
total (88).
Mali/a was Stanford's second
leading scorer this past fall (22
points) and was a third-team
All-American himself. He was
just as durable as Levesque as
well, leaving Stanford having
played 79 games (sixth-best in
school history).
.All four newly enshrined mem
bers of the professional soccer
ranks attribute their successes to
Stanibrd's burgeoning soccer pro
gram.
"My Stanford experience meant
everything for my development as
a soccer player," Dunivant said. "I
was very fortunate to have two of
the greatest coaches in all of college
soccer—Bobby Clark and Bret
Simon.
"They are the big reasons for
any individual success and obvi
ously for the team's recent accom
plishments."
Now, these four get to do what
they love best at the highest level.
"Being able to wake up every
morning excited for the day ahead
is a rarity," Dunivant said.
