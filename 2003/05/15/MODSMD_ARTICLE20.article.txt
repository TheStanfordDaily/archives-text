# Stanford soccer grads starting to progress in MLS
## Making their mark 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
When your team reaches the College
Cup two years in a row, you know you've
got some talented players. Such is the
case for Stanford soccer — and the rest
of the international soccer community is
starting to take notice.
The Major League Soccer draft was
held in early February, and four play
ers instrumental in the Cardinal's run
to the 2002 NCAA title game were se
lected.
The nearby San Jose Earthquakes
rounded up three of those four in draft
ing Todd Dunivant (first round), Roger
Levesque (third round) and Johanes
Maliza (fifth round). Taylor Graham was
picked up by the Kansas City Wizards in
the fourth round.
This talented group brings the total
number of Stanford alumni in the MLS
to six. The other two active athletes in
the league are Simon Elliot and Ryan
Nelson, who play for the Los .Angeles
Galaxy and D.C. United, respectively.
While midfielder Maliza and forward
Levesque have begun their pro careers
on the injured list for the Earthquakes,
defender Dunivant has had an immedi
ate impact.
The ex-Stanford captain scored in his
first-ever MLS game against the Col
orado Rapids in the 22nd minute — a
goal which turned out to be the game
winner.
Dunivant (who was selected sixth

overall) has been a fixture in the Earth
quakes' lineup thus far; he has started all
five games-and is one of the team's cor
ner-kick specialists.
"Dunni has the skill and composure to
be an international level player," said
Dunivant's ex-coach at Stanford, Bret
Simon. "He has made a remarkably
smooth transition to the pros, though
few who have seen him play over the last
few years are surprised."
That no one is surprised with Duni
vant's quick ascension at the profession
al level is something of an understate
ment. The MLS came calling after his
junior season but Dunivant opted to
stay in school — with the dream of
bringing a first-ever national champi
onship to Palo Alto.
"I believed that with a good senior sea
son, I would have even more options of
playing professionally," he said. "Re
gardless, I owed too much to my team
mates and coaches to ever leave them.
"I never even considered it."
Dunivant's unwavering loyalty was re
warded earlier this year when the he led
Stanford to its second-consecutive Col
lege Cup appearance. He also garnered
All-America honors and finished fourth
on the Cardinal's all-time list in games
played (81).
Meanwhile, Graham is trying to work
his way into the Kansas City lineup.
"It is extremely difficult to get playing
time in this league and right now my goal
