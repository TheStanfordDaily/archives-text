### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At last year's NCAA Western Re
gional, the Stanford men's golf team
turned in a disappointing 17th
place performance, and the Cardi
nal failed to earn a spot at the N( AA
Championship Tournament.

Men's Golf
Regional in Auburn, Washington

This year, Stanford hopes to
write a new story as the team begins
play at the Regional iti Auburn,
Wash.
A talented field of 27 teams and
six individuals will try to tame the
lengthy Washington National Golf
(Hub. I lie par-72 track measures an
impressive 7,304 yards and should
present a championship-caliber test
for the players this week.
"'Hie course is playing pretty
long," senior Jim Seki said. "The
fairways aren't too wide, and the
greens are definitely pretty undu
lating."
Stanford enters this week's Re
gional ranked 65th in the nation by
Golfweek magazine. However, the
team is showing signs of warming
up at just the right time of year.
'Ilie Cardinal has finished sev
enth or better in its last three tour
naments and has claimed a spot in

the top 10 in five of its last six events.
In addition to the added consisten
cy, Stanford has demonstrated an
ability to withstand the pressures of
postseason competition.
The team's best finish in more
than two months came at last week's
Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onship, where they claimed fourth
place, competing well with a num
ber of top-25 teams. Stanford will
try to transform that momentum
into a strong finish at this week's
event.
As it has all year, the team will
look to Seki for leadership. A man of
few words on the golf course, Seki
has let his scores do the talking the
entire year.
He has recorded six top-10 fin
ishes in 10 events, including a pair
of runner-up performances. In his
most recent outing, Seki paced the
Cardinal by tying Arizona State's
Brady Stockton for second place at
1 he Pac- 10CChampionship.
His strong play has not gone un
noticed. Seki plays his final Western
Regional having just l)een named to
the All Pac-10 Second Team.
In addition to Seki, coach Jeff
Mitchell has selected an experi
enced group to represent Stan
ford in Washington. Senior Ron
Won will look to duplicate his suc
cess from last week's Pac-10
