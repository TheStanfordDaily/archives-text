# Nakba Day remembers Palestine
## 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pro-Palestinian students and curious
passersby assembled in White Plaza yesterday at
noon in commemoration of Nakba Day, a day to
remember the 1947-1948 Palestinian exodus
from what is now Israel. They talked in small
groups while viewing photos of pre-1948 Pales
tine.
Nakba Day is considered the most important
date on the Palestinian calendar. "Nakba,"
which means "catastrophe" in Arabic, is ob
served throughout the world on May 15.
The day is meant to be a time to learn the his
tory of Palestine and its people and to remem
ber the period when 700,000 Palestinians left Is
rael during Israel's war for independence in
1947-1948. While Israelis claim Palestinians fled
on their own accord or were encouraged by
other Arabs, Palestinians maintain that Zionist
forces expelled them.
"[Nakba is] the word is used to refer to the
devastation of Palestinian society and the dispos
session of the Palestinian people resulting from
the ethnic cleansing conducted by Zionist forces
during 1947-48," said Yael Ben-zvi, a graduate
student in cultural and social anthropology and
modern thought and literature and a member of

the Coalition for Justice in Israel / Palestine, the
group that organized the event.
The gathering featured a display of pho
tographs from before Nakba and during the ex
odus. Fliers and a Palestinian dessert were also
distributed.
"Our main goal is to educate people of the
history," said Ammar Nayfeh, a doctoral candi
date in electrical engineering on the board of
the coalition. "Before 1948, a country was called
Palestine. Today that country is erased from the
map but not from our hearts."
This is the second year the day has been com
memorated in White Plaza.
"We felt it was important to get this informa
tion out to the Stanford community, especially
in light of the current situation," said Rula
Razek, a graduate student in modern thought
and literature, member of the coalition and an
organizer of the event. "We are keeping the his
tory alive and putting it out there for people
who do not know the history and what really
happened."
Most felt that the event was informative and
a success, while other remarked on the low
n umber of atten dees.
"I would think the most discussed-about con
flict in the past five decades would have a better
turnout," said Basil Hantash, a resident in der

inatology. "It is disconcerting especially in light
of recent events."
Joel Beinin.a professor of Middle Eastern his
tory who came to express his solidarity with the
coalition, said, "I think the pictures are very force
fill and give people a good sense of Palestinians as
actual human beings, which is something they do
not always get."
Susumu Harada, a graduate student in com
puter science, said, "I think it's great to be able to
explore the background, because usually in the
media we just get the surface issue. It's really
helpful to learn both sides"
Maham Mela, a freshman from Pakistan, said
she was pleased that not only Muslims but also
Jews and people of other backgrounds were pre
sent.
"I came because I'm Muslim and to show sup
port and to find out more," she said. "Even being
a Muslim, 1 don't know a whole lot."
Kathleen Namphy, a lecturer emerita in Eng
lish affiliated with the coalition, said the event was
both educational and instructive. She taught for
10 years in Beirut and had many students who
were Palestinian refugees.
"I feel the urgency of a peaceful reconcilia
tion and final ending to a century of conflict be
tween two communities of people of the ancient
and modern Middle East," Namphy said.
