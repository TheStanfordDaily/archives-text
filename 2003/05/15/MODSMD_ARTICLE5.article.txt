# New auxiliary library to host 3 million books
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University Libraries
sent a letter on Tuesday to all grad
uate students informing them that
over the next few years, 3,000,000
volumes — most of which are now
stored in Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary 1 or II or in rented off-cam
pus storage — would be moved to
the new SAL 111 facility in Liver
more.
Thirty-three miles from the
Stanford campus, the Livermore
facility lies safely above the 500-
year flood plane. Catherine Tier
ney, associate librarian for techni
cal services, noted that Stanford's
collection of books is one of its most
valuable assets — rivaling the Uni
versity's buildings in worth. SAL
Ill's location will put the books out
of the way of many natural disas
ters and will ensure that these col
lections will be available to future

generations of Stanford students.
"The library collections are irre
placeable— you can't buy these
books again," Tierney said.
"We will be putting our lowest
use books at SAL III," said Assun
ta Pisani, associate librarian for li
brary collections and services.
"We have materials in rented
space right now. We're going to
get those out first.
"My to}) priority is to move those
materials out that are costing us a
lot to store," she said.
Pisani noted that some materials
in other University libraries may be
moved, but that a collections spe
cialist is checking each item to make
sure that it doesn't need to be ac c es
sible to open-shell browsing.
In addition to books, the facility
will also store films, audio materials,
papers and maps.
"We're also looking to enhance

the bibliographic information avail
able online," she said. "We are
going to put tables of contents of
journals online, for example."
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the new library is the system
being used to shelve t he materials.
"Books and other materials will
be shelved by height so that we
conserve space," Tierney said.
"The items will not be shelved by
subject matter, but completely by
height and size."
Tierney noted that the facility
would not use robotic retrieval, be
cause the items stored there are
low-use, but all items stored in the
facility will be organized by a bar

code system.
"Everything that goes in has a
bar code on the cover, the trays in
which we are storing the books all
have bar codes, and all the shelves
have a bar code," she said. "We're
inventorying just by bar code."
The shelves will be 30 feet high,
and each shelf will be about twice
as deep as traditional library shelv
ing. The temperature in the facili
ty will be maintained at 50 de
grees, and the humidity at 35 — a
climate that extends the life of
paper by 244 years over normal
room temperature and humidity.
Requested materials will be
delivered to campus overnight,
and the University Libraries are
working to ensure that students,
faculty and staff will be able to
pick up requested material at any
campus library.
