# Faculty salaries rise 3 percent
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Though faculty salaries are
frozen for the next academic year,
the Provost's Office released a re
port yesterday that indicated that
salaries rose approximately 3 per
cent this year, in line with the na
tional average.
Median salaries rose almost
across the board, with the excep
tion of the School of Engineering,
where median salaries fell by be
tween 1 and 6 percent among pro
fessors with differing lengths of ser
vice. In fiscal year 2002-2003, the
median salary for an engineering
professor with at least 21 years
spent at Stanford was $126, HIS,
while the median salary for an as
sistant professor was $80,200.
The largest salary increases came
in the School of Earth Sciences,
where the median salary for profes
sors rose between 6 and 8 percent.
I "lie median salary was $ 1 12,250 for
professors who had spent one to 12
years at Stanford and $133,850 for
those who had spent 13 or more
years.
I he salary data, released annual
ly by the University, only provides a
rough estimate of how Stanford

compensates its faculty. Various fac
tors such as the tenure rate and fluc
tuatingexperience level ofthe facul
ty can change the median reported
salaries.
Stanford ranked fourth in the
nation for salaries for full professors,
according to a report released last
month by the American Association
of University Professors. The report
also concludes that professor
salaries rose 3 percent before infla
tion, but that adjusted for inflation
the increase was just ().(> percent.
Among all the schools in the Uni
versity, the lowest median salary for
professors was in Humanities and
Sciences, where the median salary

for professors who have worked in
natural sciences at Stanford for be
tween one and 10 years is .$ 104,420.
The highest median salary for pro
fessors was $295,361 for medical
professors in the Range A salary
range.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, spe
cial assistant to the provost for facul
ty recruitment and retention, noted
that Stanford's position in the rank
ings is not an important factor in de
cisions about salaries.
"It only comes up indirectly," he
said.

other universities could become a
factor.
"If there is competition fora par
ticular candidate .. . then we have
to acknowledge the market forces,"
he said.
Weisberg added that salaries
could come to the forefront if t here
was a certain category of faculty
where salaries were much too low.
"A few years ago, this occurred
with assistant professors in the Busi
ness School," he said. "It was just
clear the market price was rising. A
structural adjustment had to be
made."
The median salaiy for assistant
professors at the Graduate School of
Business was $119,625 in fiscal year
2002-2003.
The lowest disclosed median
salaiy for assistant professors was in
the Humanities and Sciences,
where the median salary for those
working in the humanities is
$61,000. Assistant professors in the
Business st h(x>l had the highest me
dian salary.
Beyond salaries, the cost of living

at Stanford is a much more impor
tant issue for recruiting and retain
ing professors, according to Weis
berg.
He said that even if Stanford and
Yale offered similar salaries —
which they do — the difference in
cost of living could make it difficult
to attract faculty to Stanford.
"Buying a home in New Haven is
like buying a phone booth in Cali
fornia," he said.
To combat this issue, Stanford
has a complicated system of home
equity shares and zero-interest
loans.
" This makes it very difficult to
compare overall financial pack
ages," he concluded.
Next year, salaries are frozen due
to the University budget crunch.
Weisberg said he doubted this
would hurt faculty recruitment in
the immediate future.
"It's hard to believe the economy
isn't hurting other universities as
well," he said. "If people want to
make a career decision, they're not
going to choose based on one year."
Weisberg also noted that there
will bo exceptions made for certain
faculty members, so the salary freeze
would not probably be a significant
factor in any important case.
