Though faculty salaries are
frozen for the next academic year,
the Provost's Office released a re
port yesterday that indicated that
salaries rose approximately 3 per
cent this year, in line with the na
tional average.
Median salaries rose almost
across the board, with the excep
tion of the School of Engineering,
where median salaries fell by be
tween 1 and 6 percent among pro
fessors with differing lengths of ser
vice. In fiscal year 2002-2003, the
median salary for an engineering
professor with at least 21 years
spent at Stanford was $126, HIS,
while the median salary for an as
sistant professor was $80,200.
The largest salary increases came
in the School of Earth Sciences,
where the median salary for profes
sors rose between 6 and 8 percent.

professors who had spent one to 12

those who had spent 13 or more

professors was in Humanities and
Sciences, where the median salary

for professors who have worked in
natural sciences at Stanford for be
tween one and 10 years is .$ 104,420.
The highest median salary for pro
fessors was $295,361 for medical
professors in the Range A salary
