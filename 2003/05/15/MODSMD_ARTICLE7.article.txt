# Stanford dorms take on The Game challenge
## Bring it on 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Many miles, two gas tanks and 23
hours later, the three freshmen in team
"Bitch 'em" parked their rented Dodge
Durango outside the Freshman / Sopho
more College and collapsed in the back
seat. I he students had been participants
in The Game, a complex scavenger bunt
that requires a sturdy car, a few avid
minds and a lot of caffeine.
A long-standing Stanford tradition,
The Game takes members to obscure
sites such as Chuck-E-Cheese, Pulgas
Water Temple, Half Moon Bay and
fenced-off areas at Berkeley. The main
objective is to collect all of the clues in the
shortest amount of time possible — in
some cases within a 24-hour period.
Game organizers often treat the winning
team to dinner at a nice restaurant.
Game players receive a list of essential
items to bring on their adventure. They
go equipped with Stanford Directories,

Bulletins, time schedules, Freshman
Facebooks, chemistry books, laptops and
cell phones — and of course the num
bers of loved ones and friends who
wouldn't mind being awakened at all
hours to help decipher clues.
Roble Game Organizer Evan Kirby, a
junior, told participants in his hunt to
bring bulletproof vests as well. He ex
plained how he had fooled one team into
believing they were essential.
"I told one group, 'This is the time
you're going to want to get out your bul
let proof vests, guys,' when they called for
the next clue," he said. " I hey were stand
ing outside a house they'd never seen be
fore. and I really think the) believed me."
learns in distress can call Game Con
trol for assistance with clues — but with a
penalty of 15 minutes for each phone call.
Kirby stressed the importance of starting
off with fully charged cell phones.
" I I lis year one team's cell phone died
and it was impossible for us to com
municate with them. It was really a
shame, because they were in the
lead for the first two-thirds of the
game."
Dying cell phones weren't the
only obstacles Game players en
countered. Some of the numerous
set-backs they met along the way
included traffic jams, road blocks,
wrong directions and run-ins with
ferocious dogs and park rangers.
Freshman Joseph Yoon dis
cussed some of the problems that
had affected his group.
"Game control sent us on the
opposite freeway once," he said.
"We got wrong directions numer
ous times. At one of the sites a park

ranger had removed the bag of
clues.
"By the time we hit a traffic jam
in Vallejo, we were pissed off and
frustrated. At that point we just
threw in the towel," he continued.
Freshman Victor Schorn, a
member of Yoon's group, said that
he was still in "high spirits" when
they reached Half Moon Bay
around midnight and were faced
with the task of deciphering "the
Morse code in orgasmic noises."
"By the middle of the night, our
driver J.D. was going crazy,"
Schorn said. "He started driving
the opposite way on a one-way
street. The whole experience was
like 'Heart of Darkness' — the fur
ther we went, the crazier we got."
Planning The Game also came
close to driving its creators to in
sanity at times.
"It was a lot of work," Kirbv said.

" There were points a few months
ago when all 1 did was work on The
Game and spent hardly any time
on schoolwork.
"I started preparing for The
Game in January and did the bulk
of the work over spring break,"
Kirby continued. "It really took a
lot of time. I'd say the longest it
took me to prepare one clue was 10
hours. In the end, the work was
worth it, though. We put together a
highly polished game."
Game players in other dorms
complained that the hunt had been
targeted towards students with spe
cific interests and talents.
"I felt that it was biased towards
people who know lots about com
puter science and biology," Schorn
said.
Kirby emphasized that with his
game at least, that hadn't been the
intention.

"We try hard not to bias it to
wards math and CS majors," he
said.
Kirby's 13-clue game involved
breaking open clay tablets and
Wack-a-Mole at Chuck-E-Cheese.
It led participants as far north as
the Golden Gate Bridge, as far east
as Berkeley and as far south as San
Jose. The first team was back in just
12 hours and 55 minutes.
"I was really proud that the win
ning group was four-fifths fresh
men," Kirby said. "Teams are
cranky and groggy when they get
back. But in the end, it's a great
bonding experience."
Participants agreed that the
sleepless night had been worth
while.
"It's one of the most memorable
things I've done here at Stanford,"
Schorn said. "I'd certainly do it
again next year."

learns in distress can call Game Con
trol for assistance with clues — but with a
penalty of 15 minutes for each phone call.
Kirby stressed the importance of starting
off with fully charged cell phones.
" I I lis year one team's cell phone died
and it was impossible for us to com
municate with them. It was really a
shame, because they were in the
lead for the first two-thirds of the
game."
Dying cell phones weren't the
only obstacles Game players en
countered. Some of the numerous
set-backs they met along the way
included traffic jams, road blocks,
wrong directions and run-ins with
ferocious dogs and park rangers.
Freshman Joseph Yoon dis
cussed some of the problems that
had affected his group.
"Game control sent us on the
opposite freeway once," he said.
"We got wrong directions numer
ous times. At one of the sites a park

ranger had removed the bag of
clues.
"By the time we hit a traffic jam
in Vallejo, we were pissed off and
frustrated. At that point we just
threw in the towel," he continued.
Freshman Victor Schorn, a
member of Yoon's group, said that
he was still in "high spirits" when
they reached Half Moon Bay
around midnight and were faced
with the task of deciphering "the
Morse code in orgasmic noises."
"By the middle of the night, our
driver J.D. was going crazy,"
Schorn said. "He started driving
the opposite way on a one-way
street. The whole experience was
like 'Heart of Darkness' — the fur
ther we went, the crazier we got."
Planning The Game also came
close to driving its creators to in
sanity at times.
"It was a lot of work," Kirbv said.

" There were points a few months
ago when all 1 did was work on The
Game and spent hardly any time
on schoolwork.
"I started preparing for The
Game in January and did the bulk
of the work over spring break,"
Kirby continued. "It really took a
lot of time. I'd say the longest it
took me to prepare one clue was 10
hours. In the end, the work was
worth it, though. We put together a
highly polished game."
Game players in other dorms
complained that the hunt had been
targeted towards students with spe
cific interests and talents.
"I felt that it was biased towards
people who know lots about com
puter science and biology," Schorn
said.
Kirby emphasized that with his
game at least, that hadn't been the
intention.

"We try hard not to bias it to
wards math and CS majors," he
said.
Kirby's 13-clue game involved
breaking open clay tablets and
Wack-a-Mole at Chuck-E-Cheese.
It led participants as far north as
the Golden Gate Bridge, as far east
as Berkeley and as far south as San
Jose. The first team was back in just
12 hours and 55 minutes.
"I was really proud that the win
ning group was four-fifths fresh
men," Kirby said. "Teams are
cranky and groggy when they get
back. But in the end, it's a great
bonding experience."
Participants agreed that the
sleepless night had been worth
while.
"It's one of the most memorable
things I've done here at Stanford,"
Schorn said. "I'd certainly do it
again next year."
