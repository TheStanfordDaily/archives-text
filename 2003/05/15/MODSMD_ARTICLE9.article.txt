# Online calendar profiles campus events

### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lectures, dorm speakers, religious affairs, dr
ama productions and activities from over 500
student groups on campus are just some of the
more than 10,000 events that take place at Stan
ford each year. I lowever, there has been no sys
tematic source to share all these activities with
students — until now.
The launch ofevents.stanford.edu earlier
this month organizes all the happenings at
Stanford in one comprehensive Web site.
This daily calendar, known as Events at Stan
ford, includes browsing options for activities
by category.
"The project provides a convenient way for
anyone to quickly learn about event details
while offering event organizers a pervasive
means to publicize their events," said senior
Scott Cannon, one of the collaborators for the
calendar. "We hope that Events at Stanford
will ultimately serve as a diverse destination
for anyone to learn about events of individual
interest."
Cannon is the spokesperson for Innovative
Student Information Services, a student group
working in conjunction with University Com
munications in spreading event news to indi
viduals. ISIS is also planning to install plasma
screens in key points on campus next year, giv
ing groups the opportunity to make videos to
share with the public.
Events at Stanford provides an alternative
method to disseminating event information

from conventional fliering and e-mail. Though
groups have posted events through the Stan
ford Report weekly calendar in the past, ISIS
and University Communications hope to solicit
even more organizations for the Web site.
"We are recruiting calendar administrators
from University departments and offices via
phone and e-mail contact," said calendar editor
and project manager Courtney Young. "We've
had more than 30 people contact us, asking to
become a calendar administrator for their de
partment. We are also expanding the group of
student organizations eligible to participate in
the pilot launch from 60 to 120."
Every group that posts must designate a cal
endar administrator who can submit events
pre-approved by the University to the site. All
calendar administrators must complete train
ing on how to post appropriate events before
they can use the Web site, according to Young.
"We're now offering online training for
those groups invited to participate ... it takes
about 15 minutes," she said.
Though the calendar is still a work in
progress, it has begun advertising in The Stan
ford Daily and the Stanford Report and will
present a full-scale marketing project next fall.
The pilot launch of May 1 included 00 student
and 20 staff group submissions.
Events at Stanford has not yet analyzed the
usage statistics for the pilot Web site.
With the breadth of opportunities Stanford
has to offer, the only downside has been stu
dent unawareness or late notice of activities, or
ganizers said. The online events calendar is de

signed to expand the amount of information
that reaches students while notifying them of
events beforehand.
Although many students seem unaware of
the new Web site's existence, freshman Greg
Laughlin, who recently saw the Web site for the
first time, found it helpful.
"I don't think anyone really knows about it,
but from what I've heard, it seems like a great
idea," he said. "I was really surprised that there
were a lot of events going on here everyday t hat
people might not be aware of."
