## 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students will have the opportunity to play
their favorite arcade games while helping to
fight honielessness at "Arcade Night," an event
sponsored by the community-service dorm
Lantana. The proceeds from the fundraiser
will go toward the construction of the Oppor
tunity Center, a facility that will provide hous
ing and other services to the homeless and
those at risk of honielessness in the mid-Penin
sula region.
I he center is being built by the Commu
nity Working Croup, Inc., a non-profit or
ganization formed in 1998 whose goal is to
alleviate the homeless crisis in the mid-
Peninsula region, in collaboration with the
Urban Ministry of Palo Alto and the Clara-
Mateo Alliance.
Don Barr, associate professor of sociology
and human biology and president of the Com
munity Working Croup, said his impression of
the fundraiser was "absolutely fabulous," espe
cially because of the initiative on the part of the
involved students.

"This is really great for those of us working
on the project to confirm what we had faith in
all along — that Stanford students really care
about the issue of honielessness in the commu
nity," he said.
Barr said that the Opportunity Center will
provide basic services such as food and cloth
ing, as well as services to help the transition to
become homeowners, such as a library, infor
mation center and career and health counsel
ing.
Both Barr and the Stanford students who
organized the fundraiser said they hope the
center's proximity to campus — the facility will
be located on Encina Way next to the Town and
Country Shopping Center — will encourage
Stanford students to get involved.
"The goal of the arcade night is to raise
awareness so people know this is going to be
built right next to us in our community," said
sophomore Jacqueline Hoang, a co-organi/er
of the event
The fundraiser will be held tonight from 8
p.m. to midnight at the Manzanita Dining
Commons. Activities will include arcade games
such as Dance Dance Revolution, Hi-player

Halo, air hockey and electronic basketball as
well as a karaoke competition judged by Stan
ford professors. The entrance fee is $2 for un
limited playing time.
The organizers said they hope to make this
an annual event. The community-service focus
group in Lantana is also trying to raise addi
tional money by requesting donations from
other dorms.
"We would like to educate the Stanford com
munity about the issue of homelessness," said
sophomore Crystal Garland, an event co-orga
nizer and Lantana focus assistant. "This is an
important issue that the Stanford community
should be considering."
Ban said he hoped the presence of the
Opportunity Center will encourage stu
dents to become more involved in service
on an ongoing basis by both understanding
the root causes of homelessness and help
ing people move to self-sufficiency and in
dependence.
He added, " The fundraiser is going to be
symbolic: that [students will become involved]
and that [ t hey] are going to play an ongoing key
role in this."
