After having their question
and-answer session cut short at
the last Faculty Senate meeting,
the Diversity Action Council was
able to field senate members'
questions regarding strategies
for improving campus diversity
yesterday afternoon.
Cultural and Social Anthro
pology Prof. Renato Rosaldo,
chair of (he Diversity Action
Council, set the stage for the
discussion by reminding the
senate of his council's current
focus, which is improving facul

"We believe that diversity is
central to the mission of the Uni
versity," he said. "We conclude
that the number one priority is
increasing faculty diversity."
According to Rosaldo, im

staff, thus affecting the Univer

ond, the University is currently

"facing a crisis of colored facul
ty," as many are lost each year
to retirement and not necessar
ily replaced.
A "concerted effort" needs to
be made to adequately replace
lost faculty of color, Rosaldo
said.
Psychology Prof. Debra Satz
asked Claude Steele, chair of
the Committee on Faculty Di
versity and also a professor of
psychology, whether his focus
should be on improving diversi
ty among the junior faculty or
among the more established
"superstars."
"There are a limited num
ber of diversity stars," Sat/
said. She also noted that the
level of diversity among newer
faculty members is much
higher.
Satz's comment launched
the senate into a discussion
about the benefits of recruit
ing more diverse junior facul
ty vs. more diverse senior fac
ulty.
Steele, a professor of psychol
ogy, argued that gaining diverse
