# FacSen addresses faculty diversity

### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After having their question
and-answer session cut short at
the last Faculty Senate meeting,
the Diversity Action Council was
able to field senate members'
questions regarding strategies
for improving campus diversity
yesterday afternoon.
Cultural and Social Anthro
pology Prof. Renato Rosaldo,
chair of (he Diversity Action
Council, set the stage for the
discussion by reminding the
senate of his council's current
focus, which is improving facul
ty diversity.
"We believe that diversity is
central to the mission of the Uni
versity," he said. "We conclude
that the number one priority is
increasing faculty diversity."
According to Rosaldo, im
proving faculty diversity is crit
ical for two reasons. First, he
said that faculty diversity has
the greatest impact on pro
grams affecting students and
staff, thus affecting the Univer
sity's entire community. Sec
ond, the University is currently

"facing a crisis of colored facul
ty," as many are lost each year
to retirement and not necessar
ily replaced.
A "concerted effort" needs to
be made to adequately replace
lost faculty of color, Rosaldo
said.
Psychology Prof. Debra Satz
asked Claude Steele, chair of
the Committee on Faculty Di
versity and also a professor of
psychology, whether his focus
should be on improving diversi
ty among the junior faculty or
among the more established
"superstars."
"There are a limited num
ber of diversity stars," Sat/
said. She also noted that the
level of diversity among newer
faculty members is much
higher.
Satz's comment launched
the senate into a discussion
about the benefits of recruit
ing more diverse junior facul
ty vs. more diverse senior fac
ulty.
Steele, a professor of psychol
ogy, argued that gaining diverse
senior faculty members is impor
tant because of "leadership rea
sons and the other things they
bring [into the community]."
However, he established his top
priority when he remarked that
there should be "a great emphasis
on junior faculty."
Dean of Humanities and Sci

ences Sharon Long agreed that it is
more important to recruit diverse
junior faculty members.
"It is a better way to build the
community of a department," she
said.
Her opinion was echoed by sev
eral other senate members, includ
ing Andrea Goldsmith, a professor
of electrical engineering.
"[Recruiting junior faculty] has
a lot more potential impact lor sev
eral reasons," she said.
Goldsmith proceeded to list two

reasons: the existence of a bigger,
more diverse pool of candidates
and the fact that junior faculty
members are closer to graduate
students. She added that she
thought it was a mistake that (lie
University does not hire more of its
own graduate students.
Education Prof. Arnetha Ball
questioned whether the rate of
tenure is lower for minority fac
ulty than it is for non-minority
faculty.
Steele reported in response that

the rates of tenure are the same for
l)oih groups and Stanford boasts a
"high rate" when compared to
other institutions of its caliber.
Long called attention to a need
for improvement in faculty diversi
ty in the areas of science and engi
neering. According to Long, there
is currently a relative absence of
underrepresented minorities in
these fields.
She noted, "We need to diversi
fy the areas where we may have no
body, vet."
