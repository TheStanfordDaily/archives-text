## U.S. and Saudis debate security 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —U.S.-Saudi differences
over the kingdom's willingness to curb terrorists
deepened yesterday when a State Department official
challenged a Saudi claim that (he United States
sought only limited security enhancements prior to
Monday's attack.
The department official said the United States
asked for increased security at all Western facilities in
the country weeks before the suicide attacks at com
pounds in Riyadh.
The official, a Middle East expert who asked not to
be identified by name, said the Saudi response fell
short of the U.S. request.
Security issues continue to dog U.S.-Saudi rela
tions. The State Department warned late yesterday of
a possible terror attack in the Saudi city ofjiddah, a
busy Red Sea port.
The warning said the city's U.S. consulate received
unconfirmed information of a planned attack in the
city's /VI I lamra district. "Some consulate families resi
dent in the district temporarily relocated to different
quarters," said the alert, which was valid until June 15.
The earlier comment from the State Department
official buttressed a statement on Wednesday by U.S.
Ambassador Robert Jordan and appeared to contra
dict an account by Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the
United States, Prince Bandar.
Bandar suggested that Jordan sought security for
only one compound — and that Saudi security suc
cessfully protected foreigners there.
"He asked for increased security at a certain com
pound," Bandar told CBS News. "We have passed it
to the right authority, and that compound that he was
concerned about was the only place that the evil peo
ple who did this attack did not cause injuries except
killing the Saudi guards."
Appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America,"
Bandar said, "Our security agencies,. . . the air force
came to the conclusion there were adequate mea
sures there."
The U.S. official said the request for Saudi cooper

ation was relayed by "VII' visitors" to Saudi Arabia last
month, including the State Department's anti-terror
ism chief, Cofer Black.
Another official said the Saudis asked for specifici
ty about potential targets but the United States lacked
such details.
The American sense of unease increased sharply
two weeks ago. This was reflected in a public state
ment warning that terrorist groups might be in the
final phases of planning attacks against U.S. interests
in Saudi Arabia.
Stephen Hadley, deputy national security adviser
for President Bush, visited Riyadh this past weekend
to convey the administration's fears.
I ladleytold the Saudis, according to a senior official,
that there was a threat they needed to take seriously.
Attorney General John Ashcroft offered a some
what upbeat view of Saudi cooperation.

"We believe we've had very good cooperation
We believe we want to upgrade our cooperation," he
said at a news conference.
The adequacy of Saudi security measures should
become clearer in the coming days with the arrival in
the kingdom on Thursday of a six-member FBI team,
which will work with Saudi officials.
More investigators and forensic experts will join
the FBI team later. The Americans will seek Saudi co
operation in such key areas as interviewing witnesses
and processing evidence.
That cooperation was slow in coming or nonexis
tent following the 1996 bombings of the Khobar low
ers dormitory that killed 19 U.S. service personnel.
" They don't have a particularly good track record
at cooperating," said retired FBI deputy director
Weldon Kennedy. "They don't really follow through.
They give lip service to cooperation."
