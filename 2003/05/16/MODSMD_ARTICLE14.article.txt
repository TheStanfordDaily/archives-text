# Senate passes tax cut 51-49

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate revived (lie
backbone of President Bush's formula lor stimulating
a laggard economy yesterday, narrowly passing a
$-150 billion package of tax cuts that would suspend all
taxes on stock dividends (or three years.
The Republican bill, passed on a5l -4 ( .) mostly party
line vote, is less than half the size Bush sought but one
that advances previously scheduled reductions in in
come tax rates, provides $20 billion in new aid to state
and local governments and raises taxes fora few.
Ii also would increase the child lax credit from
$600 to $1,000, gradually eliminate the marriage
penalty and encourage new investment by small busi
nesses by allowing them to write oil $100,000 in new
equipment purchases.
But its biggest feature by far is suspending taxes on
stock dividends, a provision added earlier yesterday
only after Vice President Dick Cheney was called to
break a 50-50 tie on the issue.
Treasury Secretary John Snow called the Senate's
action on dividends a "bold step," saying it "will have
a profoundly positive effect on job creation, corporate
governance and the well-being of all Americans."
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-lowa, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, said he hoped to begin
negotiations next week with the House, which this
month passed its own package of $550 billion in tax
cuts through 2013.
Bush had asked Congress to abolish taxes on divi
dends paid to investors at a cost of $400 billion over
the next decade, arguing that corporate profits are
now effectively taxed twice, once at the corporate level
and again by stockholders on the dividends paid to
them.
The I louse instead voted to reduce the top rate on
them, as well as capital gains, to 15 percent. Dividends
and capital gains are now taxed at a maximum rates
of 38.6 percent and 20 percent respectively.
The Senate bill chops dividend taxes in half this
year, suspends them entirely in 2004, 2005 and 200(5,
and restores them in 2007, at a total cost of $124 billion.
