## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Study list reminders 
### 
Once a new student arrives on
the Stanford campus, she or
he will likely be overwhelmed;
countless events take place
every day and there are numerous
groups students can become involved in.
One could get involved in the ASSU,
service groups, activist organizations,
community centers, all while juggling a
full class schedule. And then there is the
arduous quarter system, where a
semester's (or more) worth of work else
where is packed into 10 quick weeks.
With all of these activities competing for
a student's attention, it is likely that up
dating the Axess study list whenever
changes are made — classes and units
dropped or added — can be easily ne
glected.
Recognizing this fact, the Registrar's
Office has implemented a convenient au
tomated e-mail message system, which re
minds students of critical deadlines and
contains a statement of one's current
study list. An e-mail message arrives well
before a deadline and contains relevant
information to assist the recipient in what

ever action is required.
As students, we are grateful for the im
plementation of this convenience, as it
represents an inventive and elegant solu
tion to a persistent problem. Instead of a
punishment system of fines and petitions,
the registrar's message system makes
good use of technology, while directing
students' attention to a matter at the pre
cise time when action is necessary
In an institution that highly values aca
demics, attending classes is a fundamental
part of the Stanford experience. Proper
bookkeeping for 14,000 students, their in
structors, unit and grading preferences,
and classroom locations is a mammoth
task for the Registrar's Office. However, it
is easy for students to forget their respon
sibility to keep their study lists updated. In
the past, consequences for such neglect
were costly and frustrating, as resolving a
missed deadline involved negotiating for
several weeks. We anticipate the regis
trar's e-mail system will substantially re
duce the number of missed deadlines, sav
ing money and time for both students and
the Registrar's Office.
