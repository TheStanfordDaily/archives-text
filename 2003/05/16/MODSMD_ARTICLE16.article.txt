As the conflict in Iraq winds down,
President George W. Bush has
turned some of his attention back
to national affairs, working on re
fining his tax cuts and struggling to save the
sputtering economy. In building up the ju
dicial branch, Bush has encountered major
roadblocks in making judicial appoint
ments. Bush is faulting Senate Democrats
for filibustering some of his judicial nomi
nations, including Priscilla Owen and
Miguel Estrada. Owen, a Texas Supreme
Court Justice, and Estrada, a native Hon
duran currently in private practice, carry
with them extremely conservative records,
raising strong objections among Senate
Democrats.
President Bush has joined the Senate
Republicans' endorsement for "filibuster
reform." Initiated by Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), such reform
would successively reduce the majority
needed to block a filibuster as each vote is
taken. Democrats have insisted that the Re
publicans are approvingjudiciary nomina
tions too rapidly, with judiciary vacancies
l)eing at their lowest in a decade.

The act of filibustering — using pro
longed speechmaking — for the pur
pose of delaying legislative action has his
torically been used substantially by both
parties.
Although frustrating to those who claim
it slows efficiency in our government, fili
bustering is a part of the checks and bal
ances system that militates against power
being concentrated in one part, or one per
son, in the government. Disputes concern
ing judicial nominations stretch back to
Congress' rejection of John Rutledge,
nominated by George Washington, for
chief justice of the United States. The con
stitutional system of checks and balances
that permits filibustering has benefited
both parties in past decades and Bush's at
tempts to remove this check would only
serve a short-term benefit for the Republi
can party.
Judiciary votes and filibusters are
both grave matters which ought to be
conducted by the Senate without presi
dential influence, in the spirit of what is
best for the country and not for tempo
rary gain.
