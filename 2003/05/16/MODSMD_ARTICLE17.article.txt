## Bang for your buck 
### 
I can't help but think some
times that my Stanford edu
cation isn't worth the large
sum of money it costs to get
it. One morning as I was guiltily
printing lecture notes fora class 1
hadn't attended in weeks, I could
remember that the times that I did
go to lecture, I simply ended up
working on The Daily crossword
puzzle. The lecture was less than
engaging.
It's times like these that I wonder
why I'm not saving tens of thou
sands of dollars by going to a well
respected state school that would
probably pay me to be there.
Is Stanford worth it?
It's like grocery shopping.
You're buying peanut butter and
yon have the choice of Safeway Se
lect or | if. Are you a brand whore
who goes for Jif? ()r do you go with
the much cheaper generic
Safeway Select? After scarfing
down that sandwich — which will
end up in your stomach and else
where — will you be able to tell the
difference?
If you are one of those students
who takes big lecture classes and is
here for the social life, please, go to
UCLA. You're wasting your
precious time and money.
Yeah, the social life isn't great
here anymore, but have no fear.
You're at Stanford, and you will
get something exceptional out of
the whole experience. You just
have to know how to get the most
for your money by looking for all
of the deals. And if you are really
good, you might even be able to
get cash back from the University.
I fere are a couple of ways that I've
found will make your time and
money at Stanford worth it. Some
of the experiences can be quite ex
ceptional.
First there are the Mrs. Bing
events — anything involving the
Bings will be great. For you athe

ists out there, I urge you to recon
sider. Mrs. Bing might actually be
God. The Bings have done a lot for
the University, like building a wing
of the library and paying for music
groups to travel around the world.
In my opinion, Bing cultural
events are what make Stanford
Overseas Centers better than
study abroad programs offered by
other colleges. In a place like

Chile, where I
studied earlier
this year, these
events were
worth a good
amount of
money, despite
the exchange rate
ofl 2,993,829,289
pesos to the dollar

— or something like that. In Eu
rope, I've heard the events paid
for by the Bings are extravagant
and amazing. So go on the Stan
ford Overseas Programs and savor
the experience.
The Freshman and Sophomore
Introductory Seminars: The sin
gle best way to get to know senior
faculty members. If you take a lec
ture class with these famous aca
demics, forget about contact with
Professor Joe Smith. In other class
es, you'll likely be talking to your
teaching assistant, who may or
may not be worth the time you'll
waste in section. But in a seminar,
the professor is there for you.
There are lots of little perks to
these seminars as well, like a free
dinner or ...
Trips! Classes with mandatory
field trips are the way to go. I took
a sophomore seminar where part
of the required coursework was a
trip to Cancun. And Stanford paid
for it. No joke. It was an educa
tional trip, I must admit, but I still
managed to rally after the field
work to hit Senor Frogs. Thank
you, Stanford!

And another great opportunity:
Sophomore College. Structured
much like a seminar, SoCo classes
match up approximately 15 sopho
mores with a super-star faculty
member. The Monterey course, so
I hear, involves ridiculous amounts
of catering and a trip to a Zen
monastery. Political Science Prof.
Coit Blacker's SoCo class goes to
Washington D.C. to rub shoulders
with the people who run the world.
This is education at its greatest.
And if you are no longer a wise fool,
you can always be a sophomore as
sistant fora SoCo class, planning
trips to the Oasis for your little
sophomores to enjoy.
Speaking of traveling, Overseas
Seminars are yet another way for
Stanford students to get their
money's worth. A new program,
these seminars take that pointless
month of September and send you
to some exotic locale with a faculty
member to explore vastly different
culture. Stanford's world-wide
hook ups make this program
worth your while.
()n another note, attend speaker
events and lectures. So many fa
mous people come to Stanford to
speak, something I didn't realize
until 1 spent some time abroad. I
would get e-mails all the time about
how Mr. President of some second
tier country was coming to speak.
Great speakers I have seen include
Maya Angelou and Janet Reno.
Speakers I'm really mad I missed
— Condoleezza Rice and Jimmy
Carter. Don't miss out on these
amazing — and free — speakers.
Finally, there's one more way to
get the most out of Stanford: Try
to become a Stanford athlete on
scholarship. This one's a little
more complicated. I understand
the commitment, effort and sacri


Caroline Ciccone

fices that go into being a world
class athlete at Stanford. Some
might even argue that the athlete
is an employee of the University,
so that's why she gets paid to he
here. But let's take a look at it from
the perspective of the person who
is trying to extract resources from
Stanford. Full scholarship? That's
a hell of a lot of money any way
you slice it. You can pat yourself
on the hack for being highly
evolved physically, and saving
over a hundred grand in the pro
cess. And that's not even taking
into account all of the traveling (I
heard the sailing team went to
Hawaii last year) and free Nike
gear these athletes accrue.
Basically, Stanford knows that
the way to get people to go — and
stay — here is to flash big names
and free food.
You know what? It works.
And if you don't take advan
tage of all this stuff, you might as
well be at that school across the
bay, because the in-class education
you are getting here isn't worth
the hefty price tag.

Know another wax to milk the system?
E-mail vie so I ran do it at
