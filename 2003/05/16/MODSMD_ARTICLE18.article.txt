Exotic Erotic party planning done with
cooperation of administration
I am writing in to Ur i Pomerantz's col
umn "Stanford vs. fun" (May 15) concern
ing the party Exotic Erotic . I would like to
begin by saying that his opinions are en
tirely his own and does not necessarily rep
resent the opinions of the house staff of
680 Lomita.
I can only speak for myself in saying
that the University administration has
been mostly cooperative and that they are
not trying to sabotage our party. Rather,
they are protecting us and themselves
from the liability inherent in a party of this
I size.
Although I do not agree with every bit
of policy the administration has imposed
• upon us, I do agree with their goal: safety.
As far the wrist bands and VII' guest poli
l cy, that has been in place for at least three
years. It merely helps residents of 080
maintain a reasonable control over the
«crowd.
v My second to Pomerantz's column is to
correct his facts. We are not spending
$15,(KX)on this party. That would be more
Than was ever spent on the party or will ever

be spent on the party, adjusting for inflation,
of course. 1 am not sure where that figure
comes from. I fowever our budget for this
year's Exotic: Erotic is large and we have
been saving. The exact amount we are
spending is information we choose not to
publish, although any of our residents are
welcome to look over the budget.

Freshman survey reveals work needed on
advertising advising, promoting Stanford
Introductory Seminars to all students
Now that the kudos have been given to
the Office of Freshman and Transfer Stu
dents' survey on the freshman year, at
least two caveats and one urging need to
be added, in my opinion.
The saddest result of the survey is the
negative report on advising. This is sad be
cause it is one more reiteration of a seem
ingly relentless narrative about advising
failures. Earlier this academic year, The
Daily featured another c ritic ism-laden ed
itorial titled "Helpful advice," (Feb 18).
Something is wrong here. Advising in the
last five years has really hit its stride. But, 1
fear that the LJACI has not gotten the word

out about its own excellence, in particular
about the specific areas that it does well in.
After all, let's face the facts: Today, success
at Stanford in the undergraduate sector
depends not only on doing well, but ad
vertising that excellence.
I also fear that sometimes students who
were unwilling to participate in advising
arrangements take it out on advising when
evaluating it. In a way, their objections are
factual, they did not use advising, there
fore, it was not useful. Stanford is in many
ways a village, and its village stories often
are mind-numbingly uni-directional. We
need to release advising from this stale
negative village story and begin to hear of
and appreciate its high caliber.
My second caveat is that I worry that the
frosh survey might become the grounds
for demanding more work from the resi
dence staff in dorms. Wielding the results
from the survey (and the proposals from
such new bodies like the Freshman (Coun
cil) might becomea fiituretactic in pressing
residential stalls into new and heavier work
loads. Students, faculty and staff working
in the residences have always been re
markably willing to take on each new chal
lenge. They have also been willing to learn
of their shortcomings. Fven so, there are
limits to the amount of work these groups
can and should do. In my view, no person
on a residential staff should be a subordi

nate to student groups. It is good to see
many students liking their first-year resi
dential experience. If this can continue to
be the case without over-burdening every
one, then this is a good thing.
My one final urging: The fact that only
39 percent of African-American students
took a frosh introductory seminar, as com
pared to over 60 percent for white, Latino
and Asian American students, should be
deeply worrying. If possible, we should
find out why this is the case. It was good to
see that 58 percent of African American
students were satisfied with Stanford in
general — a solid base from which to
build. Still, Stanford Introductory Semi
nars represent some of the best 1990s un
dergraduate ideas. For any group of stu
dents not to take advantage of them is a
loss. I would urge recruiting more of the
senior African-American faculty for offer
ings. Perhaps, this would help, as well ex
pose these faculty to all students as they
start their Stanford education.

Invitation to make students feel valued at
Stanford
I am grateful for the confidence The

Daily has shown in our new office of
Freshman and Transfer Students, as
was reflected in the editorial, "First
Year on the Farm" (May 15). As (he
Class of 2006 winds up its freshman ex
perience, I hope many will choose to
join me and my staff fora fireside chat
to discuss how we can make our incom
ing students feel we value them. The
event will be held on Wednesday, May
28, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. in the Toyon
Lounge. The thoughts and advice of the
current freshman class will help us
shape our efforts going forward.

Economic models are a 'gross' simplifica
tion of real world labor scenarios
Elizabeth Madjlessi and Alexander
Kendall may have taken Econ 1, but did
they pay attention? After reading their
column, "Living in a material world"
(May 12) I suspect that they missed the
professor's warnings that all models used
were grossly simplified. Although I
found many problems with their reason-
