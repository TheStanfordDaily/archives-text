### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
Within the next five days the No. 4 Stanford (23-3,
7-0 Pacific-10 Conference) men's tennis team's eight
month season will be over. The only question is
whether an unprecedented 18th national title lies at
the end of the road.

Men's Tennis
Saturday: No. 5 Stanford vs. No. 12 Tulane,
in Athens, Georgia, 3 p. m.

The Cardinal is in Athens, Ga. right now to com
pete in the 2003 NCAA Team Championships. The
16-team event takes place Saturday through Tuesday
at the University of Georgia.
In the round of 16 on Saturday the No. 5 seeded
Cardinal takes on 12th seeded Tulane (21-5). Stan
ford already faced the Green Wave once this season,
posting a 7-0 victory on March 5 at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
"We beat them pretty badly in the regular season,"
said associate head coach John Whitlinger. "After that

match the Tulane coach came up to me and said,
'What just happened?' because he was shocked that it
hadn't been closer."
Whitlinger cautions that the Cardinal should not
expect to win so easily this time around.
"It'll be a whole different deal here," Whitlinger
said. "They're a very good team. I don't want our guys
to think it's going to be a cake-walk because if they do,
then we'll run into some problems."
The Cardinal has been in Athens since Tuesday.
Georgia is familiar territory for Stanford, as the NCAA
Championships have been held in Athens in 23 of the
last 27 years.
"We got here early to acclimatize," Whitlinger said.
"You never know what to expect from the weather
here. A lot of the time the heat can be really oppressive
and the humidity here is something that we don't see
back at Stanford, so it takes some getting used to."
Regardless of the Cardinal's success on the courts
this weekend, the team is sure to enjoy itself amidst the
fanfare of college tennis' premiere event.
"The town gets behind it. It's on the front page of
the local newspaper every day," Whitlinger said. "The
people here really enjoy watching good tennis. They
do it right here, that's for sure. This really is a special
place to play."


JACOB TOKARS/The Stanford Daily
With the help of freshman K. C. Corkery, the Stanford men's tennis team has a strong chance to capture the nation
al title when it begins championship play this weekend.
II the Cardinal gets past Tulane,
it will most likely face No. 4 seed
California in the quarterfinals on
Sunday. Stanford and Cal split a
pair of matches during the regular
season with the Hears winning 4-3
iu Berkeley Feb. 1 and the Cardi
nal winning 4-3 at home on April 8.
No. I Illinois looms in the
semifinal round for the Cal-Stan
ford winner. The Fighting Illini

are undefeated and have not
been seriously threatened in any
match this season. Illinois has not
lost more than two points in any
dual match.
Before the Cardinal can worry
about Cal and Illinois, though, it
has to fix us on its Saturday match.
'Illlane advanced to the round
of 16 with 4-0 and 4-1 wins over
Southern University and Southern
Alabama. This is the first time that
Tulane has advanced to the final 16
in the school's history.
The Green Wave is led by its top
singles player, No. 1 1 Michael

Kogan. I le has accumulated an im
pressive 21-2 record in dual matt li
es this season. One of his two losses
came at the hands of senior All-
American Scott I ,ipsky.
This time around, Kogan will
face the (Cardinal's other senior All-
American, No. 8 David Martin.
Kogan also makes up half 'of one
of the nation's top doubles teams
along with Victor Romero. Kogan
and Romero (No. 5 nationally) will
have to contend with No. 4 Lipsky
and Martin. When the duos met on
March 5, Kogan and Romero es
caped with a narrow 9-8 victory.
