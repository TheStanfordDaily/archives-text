# Madsen earning keep as a Laker
## 
### 
Yesterday I wrote about the Kings, and
since so many Stanford students are from
the Los Angeles area, 1 feel compelled to
talk about the Lakers.
Now, plenty of people dislike or utterly detest
the Lakers. 1 can certainly understand this senti
ment. However, even the most die-hard Kings fan
should be able to appreciate the awe-inspiring

Mark Madsen. |
This Stanford alumnus is such a
good guy that even three years on
the end of the Lakers' bench
haven't spoiled his good spirits.
Now, I am not old enough to
have been in the stands when Mad
Dog and Arthur Lee terrorized col
lege basketball.
So, I won't focus on Madsen's

dominance here but rather on his uncanny success
as an NBA role player.
I will admit it. Halfway through this season — as
Madsen was playing less than Jannero Pargo and
shooting free throws at a percentage that would
make a sorry batting average — I was afraid he was
going to be the next "three strikes and you're out"
beneficiary of the NBA's labor agreement. That
bogus compact gives first-round draft picks three
year contracts, (foe Forte is a great example of a
sure-fire "three strikes" player.)
After all, as a Bulls fan — and a lifelong devotee of
former Bulls, Warriors and Hawks power forward
Dickey Simpkins — I know all too well the fickle way
Lakers coach Phil Jackson handles his bench.
Hustle in practice, do your job in garbage time
and he'll suddenly thrust you into important game
situations and keep using you until you fail or he
loses interest.
But if you slack off or don't perform, you find
yourself relegated to the end of the bench, out of
sight and out of mind until another whim should
seize him.
Simpkins, a renowned defensive whiz with an
array of decent but clumsy offensive moves, wasted
away what could have been a Dale Davis-like career
in the deep recesses of Phil's oversized doghouse.


Mark Thoma
He'd finally got in the game
late in some blowout, make a lew
nice stops on deiense, make some
nice passes, finish a fast break —
and then he'd throw up an awk
ward brick or dribble the ball oil
his foot. Next whistle, he'd be
called back to the bench fora
long, long time.
1 his was the kind of career
track Madsen seemed to be on
over the past two seasons. Great
guy, hard worker, but never real
ly given a chance and unable to
impress in meaningless, inconsis
tent playing time.
Alter three months of sporadic
and ineffective playing time this
year, though, he went off on a tear.
On Feb. 18, Mad Dog torched
the Blazers for nine points, five
rebounds and four blocks in a
season-high 28 minutes.
He has played in every game
since.
This season he set career highs
for points per game (3.2) and re
bounds per game (2.9).
OK, James Worthy he's not.
But he takes minutes away from
Samaki Walker and Slava Medve
denko, and that can only be a good

thing.
Madsen has drawn a lot oi
praise in the past for being a con
summate team player— a towel
waver rivaled only by Mateen
Cleaves. But this season, Mad
Dog has come into his own on the
basketball court.
Finally given consistent play
ing time, he's shown that he's a
tireless worker, a dictionary-de
finition garbageman willing to
do anything and everything to
harass the other team's post
players.
Sure, we've all seen Madsen get
frozen and then absolutely torched
when he steps out of the paint to try
to cut off a driving guard. But try to
post him up on the low block, and
lie will scrap for every inch of hard
wood, until you either heave up a
jump hook out of frustration or
pass the ball back out.
On-the-ball defense may take
quick eyes, hands and legs, but
post defense is all about size and,
more importantly, desire. 1 like
to think of it this way: a great post
player can always score on you, if
they are willing to expend
enough time and energy.
But with the 24-second shot
clock and the fatigue of running
up and down the court for 40
minutes a game, a much more tal
ented player can be shut down by

a guy like Madsen simply
through sheer force of will.
Unfortunately, Madsen's offen
sive skill set can best be described
as unfortunate. 1 just about fell oil
my couch when he drained an 18-
looter at the end of regulation in
the Laker's Game Three victory
over the Spurs. Deep within Mad
Dog, there is a decent offensive
player. It's just that he just gets too
nervous on offense and ends up
looking awkward. It will take time
lor him to improve.
But, thanks to his late-season
and playoff performances on de
fense, there will be time for Mad
sen to do that.
If he took two strikes his first
two years, this season he lined a
single into right field. (I ( this hor
rible mixed metaphor continues,
we might just see him strolling
into second base with a stand-up
double of a season next year.)
I never enjoy seeing the Lak
ers win an NBA Championship,
but should they win again, there
will be one big consolation: Mark
Madsen, dancing.
