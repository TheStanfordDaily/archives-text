# Madsen earning keep as a Laker
## 
### 
Yesterday I wrote about the Kings, and
since so many Stanford students are from
the Los Angeles area, 1 feel compelled to
talk about the Lakers.
Now, plenty of people dislike or utterly detest
the Lakers. 1 can certainly understand this senti
ment. However, even the most die-hard Kings fan
should be able to appreciate the awe-inspiring

Mark Madsen. |
This Stanford alumnus is such a
good guy that even three years on
the end of the Lakers' bench
haven't spoiled his good spirits.
Now, I am not old enough to
have been in the stands when Mad
Dog and Arthur Lee terrorized col
lege basketball.
So, I won't focus on Madsen's

dominance here but rather on his uncanny success
as an NBA role player.
I will admit it. Halfway through this season — as
Madsen was playing less than Jannero Pargo and
shooting free throws at a percentage that would
make a sorry batting average — I was afraid he was
going to be the next "three strikes and you're out"
beneficiary of the NBA's labor agreement. That
bogus compact gives first-round draft picks three
year contracts, (foe Forte is a great example of a
sure-fire "three strikes" player.)
After all, as a Bulls fan — and a lifelong devotee of
former Bulls, Warriors and Hawks power forward
Dickey Simpkins — I know all too well the fickle way
Lakers coach Phil Jackson handles his bench.
Hustle in practice, do your job in garbage time
and he'll suddenly thrust you into important game
situations and keep using you until you fail or he
loses interest.
But if you slack off or don't perform, you find
yourself relegated to the end of the bench, out of
sight and out of mind until another whim should
seize him.
Simpkins, a renowned defensive whiz with an
array of decent but clumsy offensive moves, wasted
away what could have been a Dale Davis-like career
in the deep recesses of Phil's oversized doghouse.
