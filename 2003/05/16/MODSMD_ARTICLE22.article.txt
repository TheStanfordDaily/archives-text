# Deja vu as Cardinal faces Bruins
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Haven't we been here before?
In the 2000 season, then-No. 2
Stanford played host to an un
ranked UCI A team in the final Pa
cific-10 Conference series of the
year with the chance to claim a
league crown of its very own with a
sweep of the Bruins.

Today: No. 7 Stanford vs. UCLA, 6 p.m.
Saturday. Stanford vs. UCLA, 1 p.m.
Sunday: Stanford vs. UCLA, 1 p.m.

Beginning tonight, the sevent h
ranked Cardinal welcomes the
Bruins yet again with the same
simple equation on the line: one
sweep equals one outright Pac-10
title.
Of course, that year Stanford
dropped the series opener to
UCIA after a self-destructing ninth
inning—with four walks and a wild

pitch — forcing the Cardinal to set
tle fora three-way tie atop the con
ference standings. Stanford did re
spond, however, scoring 38 runs
over the next two days against the
Bruins and driving all the way to
the national championship game.
But this season's version does
have its differences from the run
ner-up squad's experience three
years ago. This Cardinal (36-14,
16-5 Pac-10) is not chasing the
Bruins (25-28, 8-10), as it was in
2000, but controls its own destiny
with a 2 1/2 game lead over No. 6
Arizona State and a magic number
of three.
Any combination of three Stan
ford wins during its final Pac-10 se
ries this weekend and Sun Devils
losses over its last six league games
will make the Cardinal the lone
Pac-10 champs for the first time
since the first year of league re
alignment in 1999.
With a perfect 8-0 mark in May,
Stanford seems to be hitting its

stride as tlie NCAA Tournament
approaches. Next weekend, the
Cardinal will take on Cal Poly in a
final non-conference tune-up se
ries at Sunken Diamond.
Rut the focus is clearly on a Pac
-10 championship, business Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
would love to take care of by Sun
day instead of having to wait and
watch while Arizona State finishes
its league slate.
Tonight, senior John Hudgins
takes the hill looking to reverse his
recent troubles as the Cardinal's
Friday night starter. The
righthander played the part of the
ace for his first 13 starts in 2003,
going 7-3 in 99 innings with 94
strikeouts and just 20 walks.
Rut since an 150-plus pitch out
ing against Arizona on April 25,
Hudgins has struggled somewhat
for the first time all season. It
seems that his large workload —

season title outright against UCLA this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
