# Deja vu as Cardinal faces Bruins
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Haven't we been here before?
In the 2000 season, then-No. 2
Stanford played host to an un
ranked UCI A team in the final Pa
cific-10 Conference series of the
year with the chance to claim a
league crown of its very own with a
sweep of the Bruins.

Baseball
Today: No. 7 Stanford vs. UCLA, 6 p.m.
Saturday. Stanford vs. UCLA, 1 p.m.
Sunday: Stanford vs. UCLA, 1 p.m.

Beginning tonight, the sevent h
ranked Cardinal welcomes the
Bruins yet again with the same
simple equation on the line: one
sweep equals one outright Pac-10
title.
Of course, that year Stanford
dropped the series opener to
UCIA after a self-destructing ninth
inning—with four walks and a wild

pitch — forcing the Cardinal to set
tle fora three-way tie atop the con
ference standings. Stanford did re
spond, however, scoring 38 runs
over the next two days against the
Bruins and driving all the way to
the national championship game.
But this season's version does
have its differences from the run
ner-up squad's experience three
years ago. This Cardinal (36-14,
16-5 Pac-10) is not chasing the
Bruins (25-28, 8-10), as it was in
2000, but controls its own destiny
with a 2 1/2 game lead over No. 6
Arizona State and a magic number
of three.
Any combination of three Stan
ford wins during its final Pac-10 se
ries this weekend and Sun Devils
losses over its last six league games
will make the Cardinal the lone
Pac-10 champs for the first time
since the first year of league re
alignment in 1999.
With a perfect 8-0 mark in May,
Stanford seems to be hitting its

stride as tlie NCAA Tournament
approaches. Next weekend, the
Cardinal will take on Cal Poly in a
final non-conference tune-up se
ries at Sunken Diamond.
Rut the focus is clearly on a Pac
-10 championship, business Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
would love to take care of by Sun
day instead of having to wait and
watch while Arizona State finishes
its league slate.
Tonight, senior John Hudgins
takes the hill looking to reverse his
recent troubles as the Cardinal's
Friday night starter. The
righthander played the part of the
ace for his first 13 starts in 2003,
going 7-3 in 99 innings with 94
strikeouts and just 20 walks.
Rut since an 150-plus pitch out
ing against Arizona on April 25,
Hudgins has struggled somewhat
for the first time all season. It
seems that his large workload —

Sophomore hurler Mark Jecmen and the No. 7 Cardinal baseball team will look to capture the Pacific-10 regular
season title outright against UCLA this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
after the start against the Wildcats,
he led the Pac-10 conference in in
nings pitched — has caught up
with him, at least for the moment.
Against Southern California in Los
Angeles and California in Berke
ley, Hudgins allowed 16 hits and
11 runs (nine earned) in 9I / 3 in
nings, striking out just four and
walking two.'
Things won't be easy for him
against the Bruins, who hit .283 as
a team and have seven players
with at least six home runs. They
are led by freshman Brett McMil
lan, batting a team-best .351 with
six homers and 27 RBI in a solid
rookie campaign in Los Angeles.

Facing Hudgins tonight will be
reigning Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Week Casey Janssen. Janssen
fanned a season-high 11 batters in
seven innings of work against
Washington last week in a 5-4 vic -
tory, earning his fifth win for the
Bruins.
Saturday, Freshman Pitcher of
the Year candidate Mark R<>-
manczuk heads back out looking
to improve to a flawless 10-0 on the
year for the Cardinal. Stanford has
won an unbelievable 15 of the 10
games — including 15 in a row —
in which the lefthander has ap
peared in 2003, with Romanc/uk
earning nine wins and two saves
aside five no-decisions.
UCLA's Wes Whisler, a two
way player that is the only Bruin to
play in each of the team's 53
games, will start on Saturday

against the Cardinal freshman.
Whisler has been ranch more im
pressive at the plate than on the
mound this season, batting .291
with seven homers while going 3-6
with a 5.22 ERA as a pitcher.
Sunday's potential Pac-lOclinch
er should see senior lefty Tim Cun
ningham start for the third time in
13 days. Cunningham has allowed
just two runs and seven hits over his
last nine innings and has avoided
trouble despite issuing five walks
and striking out none.
The Bruins' Sunday Hurler is
yet to be decided.
If this weekend the Cardinal
can get the sweep over UCLA that
it sought in 2000, giving it a perfect
9-0 record over its last nine Pac-10
games, it will avoid repeating his
tory and celebrate a conference
title on Sunday — by itself.
