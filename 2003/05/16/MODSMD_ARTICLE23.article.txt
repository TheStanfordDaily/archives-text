# Shorthanded track in search of Pac-10 title
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Last year, there was little doubt that the
Stanford men's track and field team could
win its second Pacific-10 championship be
hind the unbelievable depth of its distance
squad.
1 his year, however, the Cardinal re
turns without three NCAA champions and
several key players who combined for 74
of Stanford's 151 points at last year's Pac
-10 championships.
Still, the No. 1 0 men's squad enters the
meet looking to upend the favored No. 3
USC trojans on their home turf and hold
off the quickly rising No. 17 Oregon
Ducks to claim its third consecutive Pac
-10 title.
And again, the (Cardinal will he led by its
dominant middle- and long-distance run
ners.
Junior Louis Luchini currently leads
the conference in the 5,000 and should be
a contender in the 10,000 as well.
While sophomore lan Dobson holds
the Pac-10's fastest 10,000 time, he will
move down to the 3,000 steeplechase,
where he is currently ranked third, toearn
extra points for the Cardinal.
Despite losing junior Don Sage, the de
fending national champion in the 1,500,
to injury this season, the Cardinal still has
the top three 1,500 times in the conference
and seven of the top nine.
Junior Grant Kobison leads the confer
ence in the event with a time of 3 minutes,
43.07 seconds.
"With no time qualification to NCAAs
this year, we are just looking to place as
high as possible," Kobison said. " The team
aspect is at its peak for the Pac-10s, so we'll
really be. focusing on contributing as many
points as possible by running the best races
we can."

The men will have to turn to their tal
ented field squad and relays to pic k up ad
ditional points.
In the long jump, senior Milton Little
will be looking to defend his Pac-10 title
and topple the 2003 indoor triple jump
champion, Allen Simmsof USC.
Seniors Nick Weliho/.kiy and Onier
I nan will be looking for upset victories in
the hammer and discus, respectively, as
both are ranked second in the Pac-10.
Both the 400 and 1,600-meter relay
teams have posted solid times that rank
fourth and third in the Pac-10.
The women's side is no less competitive
as the Pac-10 boasts three top-10 teams in
No. 4 UCLA, No. 6 USC, and No. 7 Stan
ford.
Last year, UCLA and USC staged the
closest Pac-10 battle in history, with the
Bruins claiming the title 160-157 over
USC. The Cardinal finished third with
121 points.
This year, UCLA is again the favorite
with seven Pac-10 leading performances
and impressive depth in the field events.
However, the Trojans boast one of the
fastest sprint corps in the nation and have
strength in the field events as well.
Leading the way for the Cardinal will be
senior Lauren Flesh man, the four-time
NCAA champion running in her final Pac
-10 championship.
Fleshman will be looking to defend her
Pac-10 title in the 5,000 and contribute
points in the 1,500.
Sophomore Jeane Goff is ranked sec
ond in the Pac-10 in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase and will challenge Arizona
State's Lisa Aguilera for the title.
"We're really excited going into this
weekend," Goff said. "We have the most
complete team we've ever had.
"The coaches are telling us to 'put our
selves in a position' to race well, and let the

score take care of itself."
The women's sprint squad began the
season with a bang, breaking school records
and leading (he women's team to the In
door Mountain Pacific Conference tide.
But NCAA indoor provisional quali
fiers Ashley Purnell and Jakki Bailey suf
fered season-ending injuries.
Then, after a record-breaking year, ju
nior I .indsey Johnson fell over a hurdle in
the final stretch of the 400 hurdles at the
Big Meet, injuring her knee and finishing
her season.
Still, the women's sprint squad looks to

contribute strongly to the team's title run.
Freshman Nashonme Johnson has
posted the Pac-10's fourth-fastest time in
the 200 and boasts a 51.3 second relay split
during the 1,600-relay at the Texas Re
lays.
Sophomore Christine Moschella is
looking to improve on her eighth-place
finish at last year's championships and
help pull the second-ranked 1,600-relay
team to a victory.
Senior Kim Stone has slowly been
creeping up toward the 6-foot barrier in
the high jump during the season. She is

looking to break that mark and take home
the title from the defending champion,
Whitney Evans of Washington State.
"My goal is to jump as high as I can, and
higher than everyone else," Stone said. "1
think t hat 1 can jump 6 feet. I have gotten
really close before and now have the confi
dence to know that physically I can do it."
Events begin with the women's ham
mer at 9 a.m. Saturday, while running
events begin with the preliminary heats of
the 400-meter relay at 1 p. m. at USC's
Katherine B. Locker Stadium. Finals will
run on Sunday.
