# Washington woes for Card
## Men's golf shoots poor round through rail, hail at postponed NCAA Western Regional 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This was not the kind of start the Stanford men's
golf team had in mind. During the first day of com
petition at the NCAA Western Regional on Thursday,
the Cardinal dug itself an enormous hole by getting
off to its slowest start in several weeks.
Rain and hail delayed the start of the tournament
at the Washington National Club and halted play
again at 3:30 p.m. The Cardinal was one of only six
teams to complete the day, and Stanford finished at
the bottom of this group with a 28-over-par 316.
Sophomore Kevin Blue led the Cardinal on the
first day. After a solid front side, he struggled a bit in
his second nine holes, but was able to avoid the blow
up holes and carded a 5-over-par 77.
Junior Blake Mastalir opened his round with a
double bogey, which typified a forgettable day.
He was 7-over par in his first nine holes of play,
eventually struggling into the clubhouse with a

12-over par 84.
Senior Ron Won had similar difficulties during his
opening round. The first nine holes left Won six shots
above par, and he eventually finished with a 9-over
par 81.
Fellow senior George Downing also seemed to
have trouble getting comfortable in the early going.
Downing collected a series of early bogeys that de
railed his chances fora low score.
Although his play improved over the second nine
holes, Downing could only manage a 79. The usually
reliable Jim Seki showed little of the magic from his
second-place finish at the Pat-10 Championship. He
also shot 79.
In the team competition, it is unclear exactly
how badly Stanford's first-round woes will hurt
hopes of qualifying for the NCAA Championship.
What is clear, however, is that the Cardinal will
need to play its best golf of the year in the next two
days to even have a shot at securing a champi
onship berth.
Six teams were not able to begin their first rounds,
and others such as No. 11 UCLA and No. 7 Arizona
finished only the first few holes. Stanford must count
on high scores from these teams and a huge im
provement in its own performance if it hopes to finish
in the top-10 and earn a NCAA berth.
