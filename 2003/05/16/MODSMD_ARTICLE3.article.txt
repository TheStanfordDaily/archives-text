# Union weighs strike option
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Seventy-five members of
SEIU Local 1877 protested by
marching from White Plaza to
the President's Office yesterday
evening in anticipation of a strike
of 5,000 Silicon Valley janitors —
including those who work at
Stanford via subcontractor
American Building Maintenance
— that could begin this Satur
day. ABM janitors have been told
that the co-pay on their health
insurance will double to $144 on
June 1, an increase the union
says is unaffordable.
"Today we want to send the
message to ABM and Stanford that
if they're not willing to give health
care, we will strike," said union or
gan i/.er Flor de Leon before lead
ing the janitors, clad in purple
"Justice for Janitors" T-shirts and
carrying signs and banners, from
White Plaza to the President's Of

lice and the Oval.
The Silicon Valley employees of
the massive Service Employees In
ternational Union are presently in
last-minute negotiations with
ABM and many other janitorial
companies about a new contract.
"On Saturday in San Jose, we're
going to take a vote on whether or
not we're going to strike," de Leon
said.
The union protested at Stan
lord both on Monday and yester
day because it believes Stanford
should ensure that everyone
working on campus be provided
with adequate and affordable
health care.
"Stanford needs to take a step
[like] Genentech and eßay did,"
de Leon said, referring to two Sili
con Valley companies that agreed
to cover the rise in their subcon
tracted janitors' co-pays.
The University has remained
firm in its resolve not to get in
volved in labor issues related to

subcontracted workers. Although
Stanford did agree earlier this year
to establish living-wage guidelines,
these do not apply to workers who
are directly paid by the University,
temporary workers or workers be
longing to a union.
Local 1877 members expressed
unhappiness with the way Stan
ford has chosen not to get in
volved, at one point chanting,
"Hey, Stanford — shame on you."
The protest, while serious and
vigorous, was hopeful in nature
rather than angry. Some union
members brought their children
and others socialized as the jani
tors gathered after work at El C Cen
tra Chicano.
The protest began at 5:15 p.m.
and completed its circuit less than
an hour later, passing the (Hock
lower as it struck six o'clock.

The janitors chanted in English

their protest. They also carried
banners and signs reading

Chants included, "Co-pay? No
way. ABM, you pay," as well as
ABM escucha, estamos en la
I u( ha."

For now, the janitors must
await word on whether a new con
tract agreement has been reached
by union and corporate negotia
tors. Such an agreement would
forestall the need for Saturday's
strike vote.
"We won't know until tomorrow
or Saturday," de Leon explained,
saying that the union has been un
able to make progress with ABM
despite a month of negotiations.
"They've not I met union de
mands] until now because they
blame the economy," de Leon
said.
Looking around White Plaza,
she added, "But we know that there
is profit over here at Stanford."
