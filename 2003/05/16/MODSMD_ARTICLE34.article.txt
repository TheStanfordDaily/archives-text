1 his Saturday, students from around the coun
try will present their research at the Third Annu
al Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Confer
ence, which will feature a keynote address by Psy
chology Prof. Phillip Zimbardo. All proceeds from
the event will be donated to a class of students
studying psychology al East Palo Alto High
School.
According to senior Michael Osofsky, the pro
gram every year selects a high school psychology
program to financially support. This year, East
Palo Alto I ligh School will receive money collected
in the conference's raffle, which will include facul
ty-authored books and donations from the local
community.
"The high school was selected due to the nature of
their current program," Osofsky said. "They are in
the beginning stages of forming a humanities pro
grain that includes core psychological principles, and
we see Stanford as I lie ideal resource to get it off the
ground."
High school students have been encouraged to
participate and have been able to attend free of
charge since the conference was founded. In previous
years, these students were allowed to present during
the conference as well.
"We're going to guarantee at least .$l,OOO to the
program even if we end up losing money on the con
ference," ()sofsky said. "We want this conference to be
a springboard to develop smaller high school psy
chology curricula."
He also underscored the importance of research in
psychology and the ability of undergraduates to con-

tribute to that research.
"Research is the cornerstone of psychology, and
conferences provide a unique forum for the exchange
of ideas," he said. "Hosting an undergraduate re
search conference is unique from just about any other
type of research in that student presentations are the
focus of the conference."
Gregory Larkin, Class 0f2002 and an associate di
rector of the conference, said it will focus on under
graduates rather than graduate students and faculty.
"Stanford is known nationwide and international
ly for its psychology department, but most of the
recognition highlights the research efforts of Ph.D.
candidates and faculty," he said. " This conference
puts the undergraduates in the Psychology Depart
ment at Stanford on the map as well."
Junior Felicity Miao, one of the associate directors
of the conference, explained the chance that the con
ference offers for students to meet those with similar
interests.
"I think this is a wonderful opportunity for like
minded students to connect with one another, and
what better place is there for an undergraduate psy
chology conference other than the best psychology
department in the nation?" she said.
Psychology Prof. Gordon Bower, who is partici
pating in a panel at the conference and was Zimbar
do's graduate school roommate, thinks the confer
ence will provide undergraduates with valuable ca
reer experience.
"This is my first year of involvement," he said. "I
believe the conference will be useful for introducing
undergraduates to peers who may have the same ca
reer aspirations and give some practice at speaking
about their research before a group of interested
peers."
