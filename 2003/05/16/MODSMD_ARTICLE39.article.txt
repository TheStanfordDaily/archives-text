# 'Reloaded' could use another shot
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
The audience has been restless for weeks.
I hey've pored over the pictures, down
loaded the trailers and read the magazine
articles, eagerly anticipating the May 15 re
lease date trumpeted on all of those slick
posters. It's the box office equivalent of The

I
Second Coming, fitting fora movie fran-

chise that centers 011 a hero

known as "The One" and 1
prides itself 011 pseudo-reli
gious mysticism.
So why then, oh why, when
those glorious snippets of Ma
trix code flew across the screen
again for the first time in four
years on Wednesday night, was
I faced with such an insur-

mountable feeling of dread?
I mean, the Matrix is something special,
right? Those Wachowski brothers are pure
gold, weaving threads of ridiculously styl
ish action with spools of metaphysics and
philosophy that we can hide behind to jus
tify our interest in what's otherwise a cine
matic orgy of violence and destruction. If
anyone can make the Hollywood block
buster sequel seem a respectable endeavor,
it's them, right?
The answer is: yes and no. "The Matrix
Reloaded" actually delivers what every
successful sequel should: more of the stuff
that made the original great, on an even
higher level. And yet there appears to be
something missing.
The plot is simple: alarmed by the grow
ing strength of the human rebels (only
aided by Neo's emergence in the first
movie), the machines that run the Matrix

have dispatched thousands of
Sentinels and are drilling down
to the center of the earth to once
and for all destroy the free city
of Zion. Of course, this threat is
really just a pretext for sending
Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity

(Carrie-Anne Moss)

and Morpheus (Lau
rence Fishburne)

back into the Matrix so

that they can kick
some computer
generated ass.
But the first half
hour of the movie is
downright lethal —
lethally boring. In
troducing 11s to the

0 —
city of Zion and its way of life, the

Wachowskis succeed only in pro
viding terrifying echoes of "Star
Wars: Episode II" as our heroes
are thrust in front of too many
blue-screen backdrops while the

plot stays mired in governmental bureaucra
cy. One inexplicable tribal dance party by the
people of Zion and a gratuitous sex scene
later, we're ready to jump ship before the
party's even started.
And to call the subsequent action a
party feels like a generous oversimplifica
tion. Visceral assault of the senses is more
like it. True, the Wachowskis live up to
their billing as visual wunderkinds, but
there's a certain blase quality to the action
here as even the film's big setpieces feel
more like done deals than dynamic events.
The very idea of Neo fending off hundreds
of Agent Smiths at once smacks of sequel

desperation, and for all its ballet prowess
even Yuen Wo Ping's fight choreography
is starting to feel a little stale.
Despite the deadpan seriousness, it's the
philosophical waxings of the plot that sal
vage the movie. Thankfully there are
more ideas to go along with all that ac
tion, including another visit from The
Oracle (Gloria Foster) and a new pres
ence in the Matrix that will redefine
Neo's status as "The One." For some odd
reason the Wachowskis continue to insist
that "love" should play a crucial role in
their epic, but to me the themes of the
Matrix have alwavs functioned well

enough on their own without the tacked
on romance between Neo and Trinity.
Take another look at that sex scene and
you'll know what I mean.
What I experienced Wednesday night
was undoubtedly the product of too much
hype. And yet as the film played out be
fore us, what I felt instead of effortless ab
sorption was a slow, begrudging accep
tance of "Reloaded" for what it is. There's
a lot to enjoy here — those breathtaking
images from the trailers do not lie — but
there's also a lot to wonder about, includ
ing how this ride might've been a more
compelling one.
