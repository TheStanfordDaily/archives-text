# 'Love' is stylish and funny

### NICOLE BECKLEY 
Picture this: New York City,
1962. The swinging singles scene
and a place to "make your dream"
— that is, if your dream is to re
duce men to mere sex objects in
the name of female equality. Here

we meet aspiring best-selling self
help she-woman, Barbara Novak
(Renee Zellweger), clad in a Jackie
O. pink and white suit complete
with pill-box hat and purse. De
scribed as a "farmer's daughter li
brarian from Maine," Barbara hits
the big city to help promote her

book "Down with
Love."

With the help of her
editor, Vikki (Sarah
Paulson), Barbara's
book claims women
won't be happy until
they're equal with men.
And the way to accom
plish this equality? Get

rid of love. There is. however, a
clarification between love and sex,
and Barbara clearly states that
"love is a distraction, not sex." She
encourages having sex like a man,
and gives three stages to equality:
Level 1: "Up with chocolate" —
substitute for sex.
Level 2: Take on new chal-

lenges.
Level 3:
Become
■equal in
workplace,
enjoy sex "a

la carte."
While all this sounds great, like
something "Sex and the City's"
Carrie would heartily approve of,
there's always a "Mr. Big." Enter
Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor).
As a free-loving freelance writer

for Know (a men's

magazine), Catcher is as-

signed to do a story
about Barbara so
that the magazine's
owner, Peter (David
Hyde Pierce), can
score a date with her
editor, Vikki.
Though at first

Catcher does everything (and
everyone) he can to avoid the in
terview, he eventually becomes in
trigued as "Down with Love"
shoots to the top of the best seller
list (after Judy Garland sings
"Down with Love" on " The Ed Sul
livan Show"). Soon there's not a
woman who doesn't love Barbara,
and not a man that does.
Catcher's curiosity drives him
to want to write an expose of Bar
bara after she shuns him on na
tional television and threatens
his "ladies' man, man's man, man
about town" status. Catcher de
vises a plan to make Barbara fall
in love, as he assumes the identi
ty of humble gentleman astro
naut Zip Martin. Zip and Bar
bara start seeing each other a lot,
which gives Catcher the chance

to gather information about Bar
bara; at least until she learns who
Zip really is.
To the movie's credit, the inter
play between Barbara and Catcher
is extremely well-constructed with
playful dialogue, a horde of sexual
innuendoes and a very suggestive
telephone conversation in a cer
tain "Austin Powers'' tradition that
ends with a perfectly lit cigarette.
Zellweger and McGregor nail the
Doris Day / Rock Hudson dynam
ic they are trying to replicate; Zell
weger with a host of
ridiculous outfits and a lot of hip
swaying, and McGregor with his
James Bond-wannabe chauvinism.
Hyde Pierce is also excellent as
McGregor's neurotic sidekick.
With its tongue-in-cheek look at
'60s flicks like "Pillow Talk,"
"Down with Love" creates a farce
that is both entertaining and in
triguing. It has likeable characters,
interesting transformations and
just a bit of role reversal. It also
keeps you guessing: What hap
pens if Barbara falls in love? What
if there's deception? What if
there's trickery? Well, then there's
always Vegas, baby!


'The Rules" were meant for breaking . . .
