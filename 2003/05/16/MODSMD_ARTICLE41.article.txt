# Farewell to 'Buffy'
## An obsessed fan says goodbye 
### ANTHONY HA 
I guess I should be happy that "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" is ending. 1 mean, it's definitely time —
seven years is a damn respectable run, and I'd hate
to see "Buff}" reduced to the suite of "The X-Files"
in its final years, ridiculously drawing itself out just to

milk a few more dol
lars from the
premise. "Buffy" is
starting to show its
age, so it was defi
nitely a good idea for
the series to go out
with a bang.
But it just feels so
weird to think that
after this Tuesday
(when the series fi
nale "Chosen" airs),
there'll be no new
"Buffy." That char
acters and stories
that have been a
part of my life for
seven years will sud
denly be gone .. .
well, they won't be
GONE, but you
know what I mean.
No more anxiously
waiting for the next
episode to come
around. No more
angrily defending
both the artful com
bination of silliness
and emotional truth
underlying the best
show on television,
or loving "Buff) " all
the more because so

few people seemed to "get it." No new stories.
No new "Buffy." Holy shit.
Sure, it's a little weird to be this upset about the de
parture of a television show; especially one that many
of you probably didn't even know was still on. But
Buffy, Willow, Xander.. . these guys have gotten
under my skin. For seven years, their adventures and
tragedies have formed some kind of demented coun
terpoint to my own journey through adolescence and
college. Unlike most television shows, "Buffy" has
brilliantly used the medium to tell epic stories and to
allow its characters to actually grow and develop.
As many have observed before, "Buff)'" works be
cause it mythologizes the pains of growing up, blowing
them up to an epic, fantastic and horrific scale, but at
the same time never losing that core of emotional
truth. Sometimes, especially in the show's early sea-

sons, the "high school as horror movie" conceit led to
episodes that were gimmicky and superficial, but more
often the stories cut deeply — now, going back and
watching these early episodes on DVD brings back the
pain, alienation and insecurity of high school.

And the show con
tinues to push for
ward into darker ter
ritory. Sure, there
have been some mis
steps along the way
(many episodes of
the current season,
for example, feel so
packed with charac
ters and subplots that
they come off as ur
gency-deficient and
overstuffed), but
overall, series creator
Joss Whedon and his
writers have been
able to explore the
fears of encroaching
adulthood with
panache and insight.
Ultimately, howev
er, what will stay in
my mind are mo
ments; touching mo
ments, scary mo
ments, funny mo
ments: the heart
break of Buffy's
doomed relationship
with the soulful vam
pire Angel, the terror
of seeing the grin
ning, demonic Gen-

tlemen of the silent
episode "Hush," the alternating glee and grief of the
musical episode "Once More With Feeling," the hor
ror of watching once-mousey Willow slowly torturing
the man responsible for the murder of her lover,
Tara.
Most of all, I will never forget my favorite episode,
"The Gift," an action-packed, epic masterpiece. Buffy
learns that in order to save the world, she may have to
kill her little sister, and she despairingly says,"I don't
understand. I don't know how to live in this world if
these are the choices. If everything just gets stripped
away. I don't see the point. I just wish that... I just
wish my mom was here." Eventually, Buffy sacrifices
herself for the greater good, and the episode's final
shot is of her tombstone:
"Buffy Anne Summers. 1981-2001. Beloved Sister.
Devoted Friend. She Saved The World A Lot." ■
