# Joss Whedon on life, love and leaving 'Buffy' behind
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Joss Whedon is the creator of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and its spinoff
"Angel." has attracted a cult following — it's a funny, scary and
moving show that tells the story of Buffy Summers, the "Chosen One" and
her battles against a wide range of supernatural evils. At its heart, "Buffy"
used horror as a metaphor for the pains of growing up.
Whedon wrote and directed many of "Buffy "s finest episodes, including
the almost entirely silent "Hush," the musical "Once More With Feeling" and
the series finale, "Chosen," which airs this Tuesday at 8 p.m. 1 spoke with
Whedon earlier this week about the finale, "Buffy "s legacy and his plans for
the future
INTERMISSION: Is the "Buffy" finale pretty much completed?
JOSS WHEDON: Yeah, we've edited it and are putting the finals touches in
now.
INT: What are your plans for the immediate future?
JW: C loma, followed by some sleeping. Obviously, "Angel" is coining back
next year, so I'm going to be working on that. Maybe

develop a film, maybe develop the next project.
INT: What would you like "Buffy" to be remem
bered for?
JW: Well, the main thing is just the one — the strong
female heroine, who hopefully empowered a lot of
people.
INT: I read an interview with "Angel" co-creator
David Greenwalt saying that the "Buff)" finale will
compare to "The Lord of the Rings" in its scale and
epicness — was he exaggerating?
JW: Actually, I think he meant the excellent animat
ed movie from the 19705. I mean, the finale is similar
in its ambition, and there is a big-ass battle, but we ob
viously had a much smaller budget.
INT: What was writing and shooting the finale like
for you?
JW: Well, it was hard to write, because it's the last one
ever, so the pressure is a little bit large. It was hard to
shoot, because, again, it was kinda like "The Lord of
the Rings" without the budget.

INT: How much were the plot and content of these last few episodes affect
ed by the knowledge that you were so close to the end?
JW: Um, very much. We knew from the beginning of this season that it was
going to be the last season of "Buffy," and we've been gearing towards this
one episode for the whole year. It caps off the whole show and it says a lot of
things that I wanted to deal with.
INT: In the recent episode "Empty Places," the Scoobies [Buffy's friends] and
the Slayers-in-Training basically rebelled and kicked Buffy out of her home.
Do you think they made the right decision?
JW:T hat's an interesting question. You know, it's not one that we really ever
answered, because things just kind of take their own course. The fact of the
matter is, I'd say yes, Buffy needed the time off. She needed a reality check.
But at the same time it also allows her to be the kind of hero she hasn't been
in a while.
INT: What do you think of season seven as a whole? Has it differed from what
you originally planned?
JW: No. Again, we had a very specific mandate about where we were going.
There were a couple of episodes which we spent just advancing the arc, which
made me sad, because I like every episode to be more completely contained.
I think it was really exciting to see the quality of the last few scripts, because
the writing staff knew that these would be the last few episodes, so they just
worked overtime to do their absolute best work.
INT: Some fans have complained that the show's core characters have be
come less likeable in recent seasons. Do you agree?
JW: I think it's probably just taste in some respect, because when you have
characters over several years, you want to avoid the "MASH" syndrome of
everybody being so likeable. A lot of times, the most interesting drama comes
from when there are two people with totally valid perspectives who can't
agree ... I think things have gotten tougher over the last few years, but we
want to challenge the characters so that we can examine what's so important
about them.

INT: What has surprised
you the most abotit the
show and its reception?

JW: Well, the recep
tion, mainly. That's
what I never expect
ed —to get critical
acclaim. I expected
to make good TV
and fly under the
radar. It's been a
huge surprise and a
delight, although it
increased pressure a
lot. I would say I
never understood
the depths and
breadth to which
this show would take
me as a writer and
director and creator.
I thought this show
would be a good ve
hicle as a story, but
art is the thing that
becomes larger than
the person who
makes it — that's
what happened with
"Buffy."
I'm a better
writer now, and I
understand people
better because of
what "Buffy" has
taught me. I also at
tribute that to the ac-

tors, they were so talented and could go anywhere that we wanted, anywhere
that we could find in ourselves, things that we never dreamt of. Sure, we
didn't do everything right, but I've learned more about life and art from
"Buffy" than I will from anything else.
INT: How do you feel when an episode gets fans really mad, i.e. killing Tara
[whose romance with Willow was one of the most sympathetic portrayals of a
homosexual relationship on television] in the episode "Seeing Red"?
JW: Obviously, I'm not out there to make people angry. But if they feel pas
sionately about the show, they're going to be angry every once in a while. If
they don't ever get angry, then I get worried. About Tara's death, it was and
is very controversial, but I stand by it. I do understand a little better now
about why people were so upset, and I regret that it hurt some people the way
that it did.
INT: You've said before that you give audiences what they need and not what
they want. What do you mean by that?
JW: What I mean, and I got a little shit for saying that after Tara's death
— fans thought it was demeaning, but it's not; I am a fan, I watch the
show every week to see what will happen — but the fact of the matter is,
no one wants to see Romeo and Juliet die happily married. Everybody
feels terrible for them, wishes they could get away, but if they did, people
wouldn't remember the damn play as much ... 1 think that people need
two kinds of fulfillment — one in which you give and one in which you
hold back.
Part of fulfillment is need, is longing, is being unfulfilled, that's the na
ture of tragedy and a lot of drama. Very often, what the fans want, they
get. But very often, what they want, they can't quite have, because we
want them to feel the way our characters felt, we want them to feel how
Willow felt after Tara died. Some people will never forgive me for mak
ing that statement, but I'm not saying I know better, I'm saying that the
narrative exists beyond me. ■

JW: No. Again, we had a very specific mandate about where we were going.
There were a couple of episodes which we spent just advancing the arc, which
made me sad, because I like every episode to be more completely contained.
I think it was really exciting to see the quality of the last few scripts, because
the writing staff knew that these would be the last few episodes, so they just
worked overtime to do their absolute best work.
INT: Some fans have complained that the show's core characters have be
come less likeable in recent seasons. Do you agree?
JW: I think it's probably just taste in some respect, because when you have
characters over several years, you want to avoid the "MASH" syndrome of
everybody being so likeable. A lot of times, the most interesting drama comes
from when there are two people with totally valid perspectives who can't
agree ... I think things have gotten tougher over the last few years, but we
want to challenge the characters so that we can examine what's so important
about them.

INT: What has surprised
you the most abotit the
show and its reception?

JW: Well, the recep
tion, mainly. That's
what I never expect
ed —to get critical
acclaim. I expected
to make good TV
and fly under the
radar. It's been a
huge surprise and a
delight, although it
increased pressure a
lot. I would say I
never understood
the depths and
breadth to which
this show would take
me as a writer and
director and creator.
I thought this show
would be a good ve
hicle as a story, but
art is the thing that
becomes larger than
the person who
makes it — that's
what happened with
"Buffy."
I'm a better
writer now, and I
understand people
better because of
what "Buffy" has
taught me. I also at
tribute that to the ac-

tors, they were so talented and could go anywhere that we wanted, anywhere
that we could find in ourselves, things that we never dreamt of. Sure, we
didn't do everything right, but I've learned more about life and art from
"Buffy" than I will from anything else.
INT: How do you feel when an episode gets fans really mad, i.e. killing Tara
[whose romance with Willow was one of the most sympathetic portrayals of a
homosexual relationship on television] in the episode "Seeing Red"?
JW: Obviously, I'm not out there to make people angry. But if they feel pas
sionately about the show, they're going to be angry every once in a while. If
they don't ever get angry, then I get worried. About Tara's death, it was and
is very controversial, but I stand by it. I do understand a little better now
about why people were so upset, and I regret that it hurt some people the way
that it did.
INT: You've said before that you give audiences what they need and not what
they want. What do you mean by that?
JW: What I mean, and I got a little shit for saying that after Tara's death
— fans thought it was demeaning, but it's not; I am a fan, I watch the
show every week to see what will happen — but the fact of the matter is,
no one wants to see Romeo and Juliet die happily married. Everybody
feels terrible for them, wishes they could get away, but if they did, people
wouldn't remember the damn play as much ... 1 think that people need
two kinds of fulfillment — one in which you give and one in which you
hold back.
Part of fulfillment is need, is longing, is being unfulfilled, that's the na
ture of tragedy and a lot of drama. Very often, what the fans want, they
get. But very often, what they want, they can't quite have, because we
want them to feel the way our characters felt, we want them to feel how
Willow felt after Tara died. Some people will never forgive me for mak
ing that statement, but I'm not saying I know better, I'm saying that the
narrative exists beyond me. ■


Hey, who's that guy nestled among the Scoobies? Oh wait — that's Joss


Joss Whedon is the creator of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and its spinoff
"Angel." has attracted a cult following — it's a funny, scary and
moving show that tells the story of Buffy Summers, the "Chosen One" and
her battles against a wide range of supernatural evils. At its heart, "Buffy"
used horror as a metaphor for the pains of growing up.
Whedon wrote and directed many of "Buffy "s finest episodes, including
the almost entirely silent "Hush," the musical "Once More With Feeling" and
the series finale, "Chosen," which airs this Tuesday at 8 p.m. 1 spoke with
Whedon earlier this week about the finale, "Buffy "s legacy and his plans for
the future
INTERMISSION: Is the "Buffy" finale pretty much completed?
JOSS WHEDON: Yeah, we've edited it and are putting the finals touches in
now.
INT: What are your plans for the immediate future?
JW: C loma, followed by some sleeping. Obviously, "Angel" is coining back
next year, so I'm going to be working on that. Maybe

develop a film, maybe develop the next project.
INT: What would you like "Buffy" to be remem
bered for?
JW: Well, the main thing is just the one — the strong
female heroine, who hopefully empowered a lot of
people.
INT: I read an interview with "Angel" co-creator
David Greenwalt saying that the "Buff)" finale will
compare to "The Lord of the Rings" in its scale and
epicness — was he exaggerating?
JW: Actually, I think he meant the excellent animat
ed movie from the 19705. I mean, the finale is similar
in its ambition, and there is a big-ass battle, but we ob
viously had a much smaller budget.
INT: What was writing and shooting the finale like
for you?
JW: Well, it was hard to write, because it's the last one
ever, so the pressure is a little bit large. It was hard to
shoot, because, again, it was kinda like "The Lord of
the Rings" without the budget.

INT: How much were the plot and content of these last few episodes affect
ed by the knowledge that you were so close to the end?
JW: Um, very much. We knew from the beginning of this season that it was
going to be the last season of "Buffy," and we've been gearing towards this
one episode for the whole year. It caps off the whole show and it says a lot of
things that I wanted to deal with.
INT: In the recent episode "Empty Places," the Scoobies [Buffy's friends] and
the Slayers-in-Training basically rebelled and kicked Buffy out of her home.
Do you think they made the right decision?
JW:T hat's an interesting question. You know, it's not one that we really ever
answered, because things just kind of take their own course. The fact of the
matter is, I'd say yes, Buffy needed the time off. She needed a reality check.
But at the same time it also allows her to be the kind of hero she hasn't been
in a while.
INT: What do you think of season seven as a whole? Has it differed from what
you originally planned?
JW: No. Again, we had a very specific mandate about where we were going.
