# Smiley puts the real in real estate
## 
### ANNA NORTH 
Jane Smiley's "Good Faith" is so im
mersed in the culture of the 1980s, with
its junk bonds, fancy BMW's and casual
infidelities, that I kept waiting for the
characters to snort some coke. They fi
nally did, around page 350, but before
that they had to sell a lot of real estate.
"Good Faith" is no "American Psy
cho," and Smiley is no Bret Easton Ellis.
She's more like a conscientious mom —
for every little bit of debauchery she
serves us; she makes us swallow a lot of
good, serious business. And just like veg
etables, this can be good and bad.
Joey Stratford is a Realtor; you can
tell he's serious because his job title has
a capital R.' With a fast-growing econo
my and a booming housing market,
he's doing quite well for himself. But
things can always get better: Barely 10
pages go by before the beautiful Felici
ty Ornquist — married daughter of
Joey's benefactor Gordon Baldwin —
spots Joey in a bar and practically
jumps onto his dick.
This is not the only big lifestyle

change in store for Joey. There's also
Marcus Burns, a former IRS agent who,
it appears, just wants to help Joey and
all his friends get rich. \ lis plan is to buy
up a huge estate called Salt Key Farm
and develop it into a thriving commu
nity of 400 houses with a sewage treat
ment plant and a world-class golf
course, all while playing the gold mar
ket on the side.
Of course, the money for all this
has to come from somewhere, but
Marcus has no problem borrowing it,
and, once swept off his feet by Mar
cus' can-do charm, neither does Joey.
This is the '80s, after all, and the ris
ing tide of inflation will carry every
one to El Dorado provided they know
how to play the game of supply-side
economics.
If you're looking for games, though,
there are more fun ones out there. Real
estate developing, despite its promise of

easy millions, involves a lot of very real
work. Some of this is glamorous wheeling
and dealing made possible by Marcus' fi
nancial sleight-of-hand but most is pretty
mundane.
Smiley has done her research, and she's
not above telling us so through the vacil
lations of a balky seller or the minute con

ditions of a zoning contract. Reading
"Good Faith" is at times like being a Re
altor, which is not, no matter what Mar
cus would have Joey think, exactly a
roller coaster ride.
Not to say Joey's life is without ex
citement. There's the cocaine, of
course, and then there's Felicity, who is
by far Smiley's most interesting charac
ter. Sex with her, when Joey can get it
— she's married, after all — is hot
enough to wake even the sleepiest read
er out of a real estate slumber. And it's
fascinating to watch her hand Joey his
soul, transforming him from a compla
cent loner into a man capable of sorrow
and love.
Perhaps it's Felicity who finally saves
"Good Faith" from ordinariness. Smiley
is good at realism — she has a flawless ear
for dialogue, a keen eye for detail and a
marvelously light touch with character.
But an author's job is not only to copy
life. It's also to find the beautiful, the im
portant, and to make it stand out. .Amid
Smiley's offers and counter-offers, her
plans and deeds and tax returns, beauty
almost gets lost. Lucky for us, Felicity is
there to make sure it doesn't.
