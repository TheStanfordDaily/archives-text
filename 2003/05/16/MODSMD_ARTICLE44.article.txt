# Jack Johnson rides the same, mellow wave
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
See those three stars up there? I'm
not specifically sure why they're there.
Let me explain: Jack Johnson's new
album, "On and On," has very few
specific characteristics whatsoever.
None of the songs stand out remark
ably from the rest, with similar instru
mentation and arrangements for
each, tempos that range from mellow
to mellower and vocals on each song
that lilt along with the same lazy sum
mer day quality.
Yet somehow the lack of definition
from one song to the next does not
make "On and On" unenjoyable —
far from it. While there are no tracks
that immediately jump out like
"Flake" and "Bubble Toes" (the two
radio singles from Johnson's previous
(ID, "Brushfire Fairytales"), "On and
On" plays like a 45-minute suite of
musical variations on only a few
themes. Much of the music begins to
sound the same, but damn — that
sound is sure fun to listen to. It's timed
perfectly to come out just before sum
mer, when most people will find it
hard to resist the fuzzy-relaxing vibe
that music like Johnson's brings.
While the music sticks to self-con-

tained familiar territories

the lyrics continue John
son's tradition of laid
back, slightly enigmatic,

subtle kookiness prevalent

on "Brushfire Fairytales."

An interesting juxtaposition occurs
with the song "Taylor," a modern-day
"Eleanor Rigby." In the song, John
son tells the story of a woman driven to
prostitution and loneliness, all over
one of the most cheerful instrumental
foundations on the album.
Sweet harmonies come in on the
chorus as Johnson sings "She just
wanders around, unaffected by/ The
winter winds and she'll pretend that /
she's somewhere else, so far and clear
/ about 2000 miles from here." This
strange dichotomy among lyrics,
music and sweet harmony, is almost
reminiscent of The Tony Rich Project
from the mid-'9os. It also makes this
song come as close to standing out
from the rest of the "On and On" pack
as possible.
While there are no ballads here
comparable to the simplistically gor
geous "Fortunate Fool" from "Brush
fire Fairytales," there are two very cool
love songs here — "Tomorrow Morn
ing," written to Johnson's wife Kim,
and the slightly darker "Wasting

©OUST

Time," on which
Johnson received
writing help from
his bassist, Merlo
Podlewski, and
drummer, Adam

Topol.
Here, Johnson begins with the lines
"I'm just wasting her energy, and she's
just wasting my time / So why don't we
get together, and we could waste every
thing tonight," before charming us
with some of his trademark lyrical
wordplay on the refrain: "But every
body thinks that everybody knows /
About everybody else but nobody
knows / Anything about themselves,
because they're all worried about
everybody else." The lilting, lazy and
hypnotic way that Johnson delivers this
type of refrain is one of the main rea
sons why this music is so hard to resist.
While I may not remember any
specific song from "On and On" a cou
ple of months from now, I will not be
able to forget the smile it brings to my
face every time 1 give it a spin. And
who knows, since all the cuts sound so
similar on the surface, maybe I will, in
time, discover a wealth of subtleties
from song to song that have not yet be
come apparent. Either way, I'll be en
joying "On and On."
