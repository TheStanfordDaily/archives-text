# The 						Flaming Lips sync well
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
For years, The Flaming Lips were semi-puckered blips
on the rock landscape: They only showed up on my re
spectability radar when "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"
pipped everyone on the critical "Best of the Year" charts.
Now, outtakes from my dead-week study sessions (winter
quarter, 2(X)3) feature me and my roommate reclining on
our chairs, staring at the ceiling and swallowing warm heli
um from balloons as Wayne Coyne sings cheerfully about
Yoshimi's ceaseless dueling with man-eating robots. Man,
it felt like being sun-tanned by a light saber, it felt like the
Beach Boys in a laundry machine.
For the uninitiated: The Flaming Lips won incredi
ble critical acclaim for 1999's "The Soft Bulletin" and
2002's Nintendo memoir cum Pet-Sound Study, the
previously mentioned "Yoshimi." "The Fight I est EP
is a natural extension of that album and contains seven
remixes, covers and roadside ditties.
The EP also marks the first step the band has taken in
identifying artists who would occupy the roster fora
Lips tribute album: They cover Radiohead and Beck
and win relevance with "Thank You Jack White (For the
Fiber Optic Jesus that You Gave Me)." Still, there is
something particularly disturbing about the Lips identi
fication of such a standard alt-rock lineage: 1 hey're
even more predictable than Spin and Rolling Stone. In
deed, they'd be seeing the soles of my shoes if they
hadn't brilliantly offset it all with a cover of Kylie
Minogue's "Can't Get You Out of My Head."
The Lips take this techno hit and slow it down from
obnoxious disco-throbbing to cautious, funereal bob
bing: "1 can't get you out of my head / Boy, your love is
all I think about" is delivered in a morning-sickness
voice, with cinematic strings foreshadowing the sparse
verses. If you're wondering why these men are singing
about "boys," don't forget that The Lips played their

first show in a transvestite club.
The cover of Beck's "Golden Age," however, is less in
teresting (and more loyal), if only for historical reasons
— they were the wiry tunesmith's back-up band on his
last tour and really have no right to fuck with their mas-

ter's work. But in rock

point: They take the rather ductile guitar parts on Ra
diohead's "Knives Out" and plot it out on a piano.
Meanwhile, the title song, "Fight Test," inhabits the
same sprawling, sun-drenched courtyard of major
chords that The Lips occupied in their last album. In an
age when everyone is working to make their electronica
inconspicuous, the Lips' tendency to overstate their syn
thesizer sections wins my applause.
The only glaring failure on this album — "Do Yon
Realize" — is remixed with an insistent Mario-brothers
techno-beat: Even The Lips can't get away with lines like
"Do you realize we're floating in space" if they don't
work to be earnest. And really, no nine-minute avatar
can claim innocence.
After you're thanking your stars that the song's over,
The Lips drop "Thank You jack White..." — a de
lightful tongue-in-cheek tour diary entry. Like all things
Lips-ian, the lines — "Brother and sister playing rock
'n' roll and doing it 011 the road /1 bet that van began to
stink / then I wonder what Christ would think?" are de
livered without forceful irony, and this guitar-led hoe
down is an effective closer for this album.
Unfortunately, soaking in this pleasant El' has not
furthered my understanding of the Lips' motives. The
sound adheres to the wide-eyed style of "Yoshimi," and
if El's are institutionalized insinuations for where a
band's heading, then we're all out of clues. Indeed, this
album is simply a bonus package for "Yoshimi" — much
like buying a Microsoft update, a purchase isn't depen
dent 011 how much you need it but how much money
you can afford to cough up.
