# Roxy talks The Talk
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
There is less than a month left in the school year. It is
time for The Talk. Now, now, stop your whimpering.
Roxy hates this as much as you do, but some things can
not be avoided.
All couples, love-struck as they may be during quarters
past, know that The Talk looms ahead, waiting for them
as sure as the top step of a staircase. They end up feeling
like contestants on some warped psychic game show:
"You've made it this far, Zack and Kelly, but can you last
through ... summer?"
Sometimes referred to as a DTR (Determining the Re
lationship), the objective of The Talk is to either confirm
or squash the endurance of the relationship you have
spent many months cultivating. By now you should know
what your boyfriend or girlfriend is doing over the sum
mer, information that is vital in your decision: If he or she
is spending three months testing water quality in a re
mote Siberian village, chances are staying together
sounds just fine. But if they're off to intern at some start
up in the city, surrounded by hot young people with stu
dio apartments, a reprieve from monogamy is damn
tempting.
Once summer plans are divulged, you should be bet
ter prepared for the outcome of The Talk. \'ow is the
time to first broach the subject if you haven't already. It
may not be fun, but you can do it without making a huge
production. Segue into the topic by remarking on how
quickly this year has gone by and how summer is just
around the corner! Then casually ask how you are going
to deal with the separation.
If you're gunning to stay together, use the pronouns
"we" and "us," as in: "What are we going to do over the

summer?" or "What do you
think will happen to us?" If
you're yearning for freedom on
summer nights, stick to "I"and
"you," as in: "Just curious about
how you feel about taking a
break this summer. I think it
would be a good idea."
Whether you decide to stay
together or have a three-month
change of heart, you can make
the most of the situation if
you're prepared. Staying to
gether can work out well, espe
cially if you can manage to visit
each other at least once. Re
union sex ranks second only to
make-up sex. If visitation isn't
possible, keeping in touch

somehow — through phone, AIM or even snail mail — is
crucial. Otherwise you start to forget that he or she exists
which doesn't help the relationship any.
If you decide to take a break over the summer, you
can use it as a way to figure out if you really want to be
with him or her at all. If you find yourself happier sin
gle or if you meet someone else, you will probably be re
luctant to jump into commitment full-force once you get
back to school. However, if you surprise yourself with
how much you miss your former mate, the two of you
have a good chance of getting back together in the fall.
And that could be fantastic — remember what Roxy
said about make-up sex.
Really, The Talk isn't as bad as it seems. As long as the
two of you are in agreement of where you stand before
summer hits, there are lessons to be learned all around.

Roxy remembers her first DTR — it caused a great deal
of heartache at the time, but the memory has long since
been defanged, tucked away innocuously in the mind,
enveloped by the bittersweet. It was about this time last
year, late at night after a painfully protracted dinner date.
Roxy reluctantly agreed to a break, which, as she feared,
turned into a break-up as the summer progressed. And
yet, when this school year began, Roxy realized that, mag
ically, The Talk had led her here, and it was all just fine.
So don't be distressed if the outcome of The Talk isn't
what you had originally hoped for. Keep in mind that, in
the long run, your worst day can be for the best — it's just
a matter of perspective.
