# Blahnik's 'Drawings' will tickle footwear fetishists

A new idea.
A new look.
A new sex.
A new pair.
— Andy Warhol

The cover art alone sends chills up my
spine.

Whenever I wear my pink, kid leather,
pointy-toed pumps with the four-inch stilet
to heels, I am frequently asked, "Don't your
feet hurt?" This always annoys me. What an
inane question — of course my feet hurt!
What those people don't get is that you
don't wear shoes for comfort-. Sometimes a
shoe wears you.
Don't underestimate the power of shoes.
The right shoe — an S&M-inspired black
gladiator sandal or a sky-high red patent
babydoll pump — can transform the foot
into an erogenous zone. The wrong shoe —
flat-soled suede ankle boots or anything on
a white foam platform — can ruin an other
wise perfect outfit.
Blessed with Asian genes, 1 barely clear
5'4" — which may be a good three inches
above the national average in Korea, but
not here, where every pair of pants I buy
has to be hemmed. Yet amazingly, with my
favorite heels on, 1 can pass for 5'8." This is
a significant difference. So really, shoes ele
vate me both physically and psychologically.
An especially beautiful pair functions as
wearable art —just looking at them makes
my day.
That's why I love "Manolo Blahnik
Drawings," a combination sketchbook and
coffee table book that reads like a shoe

horse's wet dream. Blahnik understands
the passionate relationship between a
woman and her shoes. Illustrated in gleam
ing color, the book is a collection of the de
signer's best sketches, from the fantastic (a
pointy-toed mule laced with budding bam
boo shoots perched upon a five-inch heel
made of a vine) to the downright wearable
(a classic platform sandal crafted in a leop
ard print).
This book was written for women who
have consciously planned outfits to match
her shoes and, therefore, has little text and
lots of pictures. The foreword by Anna Win
tour eloquently tells the reader the basics:
Manolo Blahnik is a Spaniard, has been a
famed designer for 30 years and is an un
contested genius.
Divided by the decade, from the 1970s to
the 2000s, each chapter is a collection of
about 30 gorgeous sketches that embody
the spirit of each respective era. From mod,
geometric-patterned disco platforms to
simple, delicately corseted stiletto pumps,
the drawings are a valuable chronological

casebook of footwear trends. My favorite
decade is the '80s, where neon-colored
knee-high boots and Lncite heels flour
ished.
What really stands out in this stellar
collection are the common features ex
pressed in each drawing: the graceful flu
idity of the arch of the foot, the delicacy of
the ankle as it postures for balance, the
ambition of a row of toes propelled for
ward. This quality best explains Blahnik's
continuing success. He respects the sub
tlety in the form of a woman's foot and
caters his designs to this image. His shoes
evoke a kind of sexiness that makes little
logical sense but is felt vicariously
through stylistic elements: the sharpness
of a pointy-toe, the mock innocence of a
rounded one, the curviness of a sculpted
wedge, the unspoken domination of a
spiky steel stiletto heel.
Blahnik takes Warhol's vision and
turns it into reality. He not only sprinkles
his sandals with Warhol's diamond dust,
he dots them with gems and encrusts them
in 24 karat gold. His designs represent a
merging of fantasy and function that
thrills shoe lovers everywhere, making
perfect sense of Madonna's seemingly out
rageous claim, "Manolo Blahnik's shoes
are as good as sex . , . and they last
longer."
