### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Attending more classes is probably among the
last things many students want to, but Stanford
alumni are expected (o flock to campus tomorrow
to attend lectures and panels by Stanford profes
sors during the annual Alumni Day.
The event, intended to attract Bay Area alumni, is
the second-largest gathering ofStanford graduates on
campus each year. This year, organizers expect 1,000
attendees, up significantly 112 rom the 600 who came the
last time Alumni Day was held two years ago. List
year, the Think Again ftindraising tour brought 1,400
alumni to campus and another 1,200 to a gathering in
San Francisco, replac ing Alumni Day as the important
Alumni Association spring event.
"The goal is to allow alumni to reconnect with
Stanford and each other," said Michelle ( line,
co-director of regional outreach for the Alumni
Association.
She said the faculty classes and panels are high
lights for most alumni. There will be four academ

ic sessions during the day, ranging from Biological
Sciences Prof . Paul Khrlicli speaking on the current
state of global population to Drama Prof. Harry
Elam explaining how the American family is por
trayed in drama.
Lunch will feature an address by University
President John 1 lennessy.
Though alumni are charged $50 a person to at
tend the event, the day is not a fundraiser for the
University, according to (-line. Recent graduates
are only charged $25.
Cline said that organizers have been impressed
by the wide range of alumni who are planning to
attend.
"It's a really pretty even distribution across class
years," she said.
Though Alumni Day is much smaller than Re
union Weekend each year, the Alumni Association
sees it as an important way to remind alumni of the
faculty resources at Stanford.
Cline stated that there has been discussion of
combining the day's events with
Reunion Weekend in the fall.
However, she said, "Everyone
likes the fact that we tan have a
great event in the spring."

will hold its fourth annual engi
neering "Entrepreneurs Day" to
morrow. Ihe clay features infor
mational panels on information
technology and bioengineering,
