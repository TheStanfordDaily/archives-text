of students affairs and assistant
director of the Graduate Life Of
fice, has been selected to replace
Tommy VVoon as associate dean
of students and multicultural ed
ucator. Upon being appointed
by a selection committee of staff
and students, he said that he
hopes to bring his passion for
culture and his desire to expand
Stanford's current diversity edu
cation program to his new posi
tion.
"Thom has done work help
ing people develop a sense com
munity and understand differ
ences and diversity for many
years here," said Christine Grif
fith, acting dean of students. "I le
has done a tremendous amount
of work here with ethnic organi
zations, international students,
even working as a resident fellow
in Naranja."
Massey first arrived at Stan
ford as a student where he re
ceived a bachelor's in psychology
and a master's in administration
policy analysis in higher educa
tion.
"1 will be responsible for in

fusing the community with more
m ulticult u r al aw are ness,"
Massey said. "1 will be providing
information on racial and even
international history as well as is
sues dealing with gender, dis
ability, sexual orientation and
anything else that adds to cam
pus culture and how it all mixes
together."
Having spent most of his ca
reer on campus, Massey ex
pressed his hope that his experi
ence with the University and
close ties to student and diversity
groups will help him achieve his
larger goals.
Massey's position exists in
joint cooperation with the Dean
of Students Office and Residen
tial Education. He will be in
volved in developing ethnic and
diversity programs in the dorm
environment through race dia
logues and other activities in co
operation with resident assis
tants, resident fellows and the
Multicultural Education Train
ing Organization.
"At the beginning of the year,
Thom plans to do a lot of out
reach in collaboration with col
leagues and METrO," Griffith
said. "I think he will benefit from
being at Stanford for such a long
time and has become familiar
with student groups and of
course the graduate community.
Basically, I think he will just try to
get out into the dorms and talk
with people."
According to Griffith, the mul
ticultural educator provides a
valuable resource to the Universi
ty as an official "expert on diversi
ty," training both students and
staff to manage diversity issues
and also working to report on and
prevent acts of intolerance.
"[Massey] has worked closely
with resident staff in the gradu
ate area and served as residence
dean, helping students deal with
a variety of issues," Griffith said,
"lie helped develop student
leadership and instituted a con
flict mediation program as well."
Griffith said that he believes
this experience and expertise in
conflict mediation will serve

Massey well in managing campus
intolerance and potential hate
crime.
Before his departure, Woon
expressed his hopes to expand
the scope of multicultural educa
tion efforts, and Massey ex
pressed his desire to continue in
(his direction as well.
"We are the most ethnically
diverse institution of this kind in
the country, it not the world,
which means that we often have
to deal with not only local Stan
ford issues, but also broader Cal
ifornia and even global issues,"
Massey said. "Fora very long
time multicultural education ex
isted only at entry level, but now
we are starting to see it as a step
to the future, something as en
demic to Stanford as public ser
vice, a real University value."
According to Massey, he aims
to turn students into world citi
zens, aware and appreciative of
surrounding diversity.
Griffith said, "Thom is differ
ent in that he puts his passion
into action, taking it to the level of
actually implementing important
ideas."
