"We're moving pretty fast but
not unduly so," said Vice Provost

who is heading the selection com
mittee. "1 think we've done a thor
ough job of reviewing applicants.
"()ne of the main reasons we're
tiding to complete the search be
fore the end of spring quarter is to
ensure that students have an op
portunity to meet the candidates
before they leave for the summer,"
he continued. "Because the clean of

students is so vital to student life on
campus, we wouldn't want to make
our decision without students hav
ing a chance to give us their input
about the candidates."
Henestroza, a senior, agreed
that il was important for the selec
tion lo be made before the end of
the academic year.
"Assuming that [the administra
tion] did want to hire someone be
fore fall quarter, it'd be really hard
for them lo hold the events that
they want to bold [allowing stu
dents to meet the candidates] dur
ing the summer, when there aren'l
any students on campus," she said.
VVais left Stanford on March 28
to become vice president of student
affairs ai New York University.
Christine Criffith, asscxiate dean
and direc tor of graduate life, has
been serving as acting clean since
his departure.
The search for the new dean
began shortly after VVais first an
nounced his decision on Jan. 22.

"The process started with ads
placed iti the Chronicle of Higher
Education and other national pub
lications," Awakuni said. "I also
wrote to the chief student affairs
officers of over 700 colleges and
universities."
The selection committee in
cludes administrators, students,
faculty and staff.
According to Henestroza, the.
committee, which first met on May
1, chose seven candidates from ap
proximately 100 applic ants in a pe
riod of 10 clays. Following reference
checks, the group was narrowed to
the c urrent four. Although I lene
stro/.a acknowledged that the
process look place very quickly, she
said Iliat she was comfortable with
the thoroughness of the search.
When the four c andidates come
to Stanford, their activities will in
clude meetings with administra
tive staff, meetings with select stu
dent leaders and forums open to
all students. All hough the final
dates have yet to be confirmed, the

education — will be held on sepa
rate clays in El Centre) Chicano
from 1:3() to 2:45 p.m.

committee does not have final ap
pointment power — it can only ad
vise Awakuni, who will make the de
cision with the consultation of Uni
versity President John Hennessy
and Provost John Etchemendy.
"We're looking for someone
with a proven track record as a stu
dent affairs administrator, some
one who has an ability to establish
st k>ng relations!lips with students,"
Awakuni said. "The individual
must also be able to work well with
faculty and staff and quickly grasp
the Stanford culture."
