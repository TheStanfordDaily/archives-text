# Professor discusses forest management
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Approximately 125 members
o! ilit* Stanford community gath
ered yesterday to hear Dr. Barry
Noon, a professor of wildlife ecol
ogy at Colorado State University,
give the 15th Annual Boething
Lecture on Forests and the
1 hi man Predicament.
At a time when laws such as the
Clean Water Act are being criti
cally re-examined in Congress,
Noon's lecture, "Ecological Sus
tainability: A New Paradigm for
Forest Management," empha
sized the importance of viewing
ecological sustainability as a
means of ensuring social and eco
nomic sustainability.
1 he Boething Lecture series
addresses forest resources,
processes and their relationships
to human populations. It is spon
sored by the Biology Department's
Center lor Conservation Biology
and longtime donors John and
Susan Boething.
"[Noon's] lecture is very time
ly," said Carol Boggs, the director
of the Center for Conservation Bi
ology. "There are proposals right
now in Congress that relate to for
est management."
Noon shared in his lecture the
results of his time spent on a scien
tific committee during the Clinton
administration. The committee —
formed to look at issues of ecologi
cal, social and economic sustain
ability — issued a report in which
he said that "ecological sustainabil

ity took a precedent."
"But this shift [in the govern
ment] towards a focus on ecologi
cal sustainability only lasted about
five months," he added.
Noon explained that the Multi
ple-Use Sustained Yield Act has
had a tremendous impact on for
est management. 1 le said, though,
that it is time to change the Multi
ple-Use paradigm, citing as one
reason the fact that "the rate of de
pletion for many of our natural re
sources exceeds the rate of renew
al"
Noon also stressed that the im
portance of sustaining the ecosys
tem must be conveyed to the pub
lic.
"I think most of us in here are
aware of the hand-in-glove rela
tionship between human welfare
and ecological integrity," Noon
said. "Yet, often people don't real
ize that connection, and somehow
we need to make it clear."
Noon said that the public has a
responsibility to be informed of
environmental issues and vote for
representatives who will address
them appropriately.
"When I was in Washington, 1
did have a sense that people who
actually write letters as opposed to
e-mails or signing lists have a much
greater impact on congressmen,"
he said when addressing the
power of the public.
Noon also stressed, however,
that it is up to environmental sci
entists to conduct policy-relevant
research and to communicate
their findings to the public and

politicians.
"If you look at any of the goods
and services provided by a func
tional ecosystem, they're not going
to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange," Noon said. "We're not
devoting resources to monitoring
the use of these goods."

In reaction to the lecture, se
nior Scott Stephenson said lie
agrees that "public dissemination
of this knowledge is very impor
tant. People need to understand
that the science of sustainability is
a very hopeful, forward-thinking
science."
