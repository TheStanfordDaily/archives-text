The Wed. comics this
week (May 7) really
sucked. I hope you're not
paying these people,
because they were totally,
utterly unfunny. They
made me groan in the
way that one would in
embarrassment not only
for the reader himself,
but also for the writer. 1
mean . . . how could they,
with good consciences,
have put those images out
there for the general
public? It was. . . vomit
inducing, a complete
[expletive] joke on the
writers. Please do not
belittle your readers
anymore with that tripe.
