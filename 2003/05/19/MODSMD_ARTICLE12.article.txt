what we believe," he said.
Students were offered an op

ment on individual lifestyles.
"Senator Santorum and I are at
completely opposite ends of the
spectrum," said graduate Sara
Foglesong, among those who
walked out. "I am not incestuous. I

am not a bigamist. I just happen to
be bisexual. It offended me."
Across the street, Dennis Hef
fernan led a group of three
counter-demonstrators. "I belong
to a pro-life group, and Rick is a
pro-life person," said Heffernan,
of Philadelphia.
In another commencement
speech yesterday, Vice President
Dick Cheney told University of
Missouri graduates to look for"the
unexpected opportunities" in life.
Before graduates of the Colum
bia school's College of Agriculture,
Food and Natural Resources, Ch
eney said he had retired from pub
lic service when he agreed to head
Ceorge W. Bush's search fora
running mate.
