# Voters select modernization of armed forces, civil defense
## Swiss choose national reforms 
### 
GENEVA (AP) — In a marathon day of referen
dums, Swiss voters yesterday agreed to modernize
their armed forces, overhaul the country's civil de
fense and keep nuclear energy.
They turned down proposals for four car-free
Sundays a year, universal disabled access to public
buildings, changes in health insurance funding,
tenants' rights, more apprenticeship places.
The nine separate votes — with two on nuclear
energy — left even ardent fans of people power
gasping for breath.
"It's simply far too much," complained Maurice
Castella, an artist and handicrafts teacher, who said
he only cast his ballot on the subjects he under
stood. "Many people are completely confused."
Switzerland's 4.7 million electorate go to the
polls three or four times a year under their system

of direct democracy. Under it, 1 ()(),()()() signatures
on a petition can force a national vote on amending
the constitution, and 50,000 signatures can chal
lenge proposed government laws.
Opinion polls published before the vote indicat
ed that the majority questioned couldn't name a sin
gle subject on the ballot. Voter turnout was 48.3 per
cent — higher than many people had predicted.
Swiss authorities had to squeeze all the votes into
one day because of national elections this October,
which means there are fewer days allocated in the
calendar for referendums.
Proposals by environmentalists to scrap nuclear
power proved to be the most emotive. A majority of
58.4 percent rejected proposals to impose a 10-year
moratorium on new atomic plants and require ex
isting ones to be closed after 40 years of service.
