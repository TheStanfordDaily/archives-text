# Agency calls Iraqi future grim

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — The
U.N. agency that cares for the
world's children warned yesterday
that postwar Iraq could slip into a
"major crisis" without quick action to
meet its urgent humanitarian needs.
UNICEF's executive director
Carol Bellamy, on a four-day visit
to Iraq, said her agency was press
ing to get more children back to
school, deal with a worsening sani
tation problem and remove poten
tially lethal ordnance left over
from the U.S.-led war on Iraq.
She said UN RTF has secured
pledges of's7o million for an emer

gency, six-month program to help
provide Iraqi children with food
and clean drinking water and to
stave off disease. The funds, she
added, were promised in response
to an appeal made by the agency
for $165 million for Iraq.
Underscoring the magnitude of
the problems facing Iraqi children
after the war, Bellamy pointed out
that, before the conflict, one in
every eight Iraqi children died be
fore age five and a quarter of Iraqi
children were malnourished and
did not attend school.
"If action is not taken very fast,"

she warned, "this country will end
up in a major crisis."
Bellamy cited a recent surge in
cases of diarrhea among children in
Iraq as a source of particular concern.
"The areas of sewage and solid
waste management are more dan
gerous than the water situation,"
she said, citing poor sanitary con
ditions as the primary reason be
hind diarrhea. Clean water, she
added, was more of a problem in
rural Iraq than in cities.
She said a lack of security con
tinued to impede UNICEF opera
tions.
