## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Commodifying human life 
### 
Over the last few years the classi
fied section of The Daily has
seen a string of advertisements
from couples or organizations
seeking egg donors. The donor specifica
tions in the ads target the female Stanford
community and are usually highly de
tailed. Requested traits of egg donors in
clude a high GPA and high SAT scores,
athletic and musical ability, a certain eth
nicity and specific height and weight
preferences. In return for egg donations,
the advertisements offer great remunera
tions — up to $80,000.
The Daily's advertising and editorial
sections are separate departments that
function independently. Though these
types of advertisements are printed in
many issues of the paper, we chose to dis
cuss the ethical implications of egg
donorship.
If one justly considers the physical and
legal risks associated with donating eggs,
making the decision to do so will never be
easy. But given the size of the rewards
being offered today, sensibly weighing the
risks involved in egg donorship becomes
increasingly difficult. College students
often incur high debts, such as paying for
tuition and running up high credit card
bills, that make these high rewards very
tempting.
However, as medical technology
rapidly develops, it is essential that we, as
a society, take responsibility for protect
ing women from the harms of the repro
% technologies we develop anci use.
In the case of egg donorship, it is ethical
ly imperative that our society prioritizes
removing eggs from the commodities
market, as has been done with organs, so
that access to fertility in society does not
become a question of riches. Moreover,
while some couples would prefer a child
possessing a similar appearance, it is
questionable whether couples should re
quest an athletically talented, highly at
tractive and intelligent donor. Not only
does making such specifications verge on
eugenics, but also will the results of the
process remain highly uncertain. The re
lationship between nature and nurture
has not been disentangled fully, and sev
eral factors, including the pre-natal envi
ronment, nutrition, family and social en
vironments can all contribute to the de
velopment of a person.
The history of egg donorship is brief,
made possible in 1983, well after organ
and sperm donorship began. Women's
reasons for needing an egg donation vary,
but they typically revolve around infertili

ty, risk of passing on a serious genetic dis
ease and advanced age. Motivations for
donating include the altruistic goal of
helping others to bear children as well as
the desire to receive large monetary pay
ments.
When a female weighs the possibility of
donating an egg, she has many factors to
take into account. Her decision must re
flect physical, psychological, legal and eth
ical considerations.
Physically, the process for donation can
last up to four months, beginning with in
depth pre-screening procedures. The
basic requirements for an egg donor are
age (21 to 35 years), a lack of hereditary
disease and no predisposition for abusive
behavior, but as has been seen in classified
pages of The Daily, screening standards
can be quite involved. After pre-screen
ing, the donor must pass blood tests, psy
chological tests and finally enter into the
egg donation cycle process. This entails
various ovary stimulation injections, time
for egg maturation, and eventually the
egg retrieval operation and follow-up
stages. All in all, the process is time-con
suming and risky, though most doctors
cite the serious complication rate to be
only 1 percent.
Psychological deliberation often deals
with the prospect of creating unknown
progeny in the world, and legal consid
erations comprise issues of legally absolv
ing one's self from any ownership over
one's eggs.
The looming ethical issues remain
whether eggs should be transferable at
all and whether they should be bought
and sold on the market. The United
States' ethical precedent maintains, as in
the case of organ donorship, that scarce
medical resources should not be avail
able on the general buy-and-sell market.
This decision incorporates two major
priorities. One is that of protecting po
tential donors so that no one is exploited
because of his or her need for the poten
tial monetary reimbursement. This issue
is particularly relevant to the egg donor
ship opportunities presented to female
students, who confront ever-growing tu
ition payments and related educational
expenses.
The second priority is to keep vital
health care opportunities from being sole
ly available to those who can afford them.
It hardly seems fair that only wealthy cou
ples should have access to certain infertil
ity treatments.

While George Orwell's fiction
al dystopia - where the society is
controlled by the technologies it
has created — is far from reality,
there is a hint of truth to his real
ization. While biotechnology has
offered infertile couples another

way to have children of their own,
ethical and equity issues should
be carefully considered: Egg
donorship must actually reflect
donating, not selling. Although
receiving egg donations is consid
ered more optional than receiv
ing blood donations, and thus
lacks the same grade of standard
ization, the ethical repercussions
of selling such a resource require
its donorship to function at the
same altruistic level. Egg dona

tions should be distributed based
on need and waiting time, not
ability to pay.

never be given a price.

ical considerations.
Physically, the process for donation can
last up to four months, beginning with in
depth pre-screening procedures. The
basic requirements for an egg donor are
age (21 to 35 years), a lack of hereditary
disease and no predisposition for abusive
behavior, but as has been seen in classified
pages of The Daily, screening standards
can be quite involved. After pre-screen
ing, the donor must pass blood tests, psy
chological tests and finally enter into the
egg donation cycle process. This entails
various ovary stimulation injections, time
for egg maturation, and eventually the
egg retrieval operation and follow-up
stages. All in all, the process is time-con
suming and risky, though most doctors
cite the serious complication rate to be
only 1 percent.
Psychological deliberation often deals
with the prospect of creating unknown
progeny in the world, and legal consid
erations comprise issues of legally absolv
ing one's self from any ownership over
one's eggs.
The looming ethical issues remain
whether eggs should be transferable at
all and whether they should be bought
and sold on the market. The United
States' ethical precedent maintains, as in
the case of organ donorship, that scarce
medical resources should not be avail
able on the general buy-and-sell market.
This decision incorporates two major
priorities. One is that of protecting po
tential donors so that no one is exploited
because of his or her need for the poten
tial monetary reimbursement. This issue
is particularly relevant to the egg donor
ship opportunities presented to female
students, who confront ever-growing tu
ition payments and related educational
expenses.
The second priority is to keep vital
health care opportunities from being sole
ly available to those who can afford them.
It hardly seems fair that only wealthy cou
ples should have access to certain infertil
ity treatments.

While George Orwell's fiction
al dystopia - where the society is
controlled by the technologies it
has created — is far from reality,
there is a hint of truth to his real
ization. While biotechnology has
offered infertile couples another

way to have children of their own,
ethical and equity issues should
be carefully considered: Egg
donorship must actually reflect
donating, not selling. Although
receiving egg donations is consid
ered more optional than receiv
ing blood donations, and thus
lacks the same grade of standard
ization, the ethical repercussions
of selling such a resource require
its donorship to function at the
same altruistic level. Egg dona

tions should be distributed based
on need and waiting time, not
ability to pay.
Director of the University of
Minnesota's Center for Bioethics
Dr. Jeffrey Kahn outlines the deci
sion well, stating, "the price to be
paid by cominodifying human
body parts is even higher than the
price of an organ shortage." This is
an important point to keep in
mind — the human body should
never be given a price.
Over the last few years the classi
fied section of The Daily has
seen a string of advertisements
from couples or organizations
seeking egg donors. The donor specifica
tions in the ads target the female Stanford
community and are usually highly de
tailed. Requested traits of egg donors in
clude a high GPA and high SAT scores,
athletic and musical ability, a certain eth
nicity and specific height and weight
preferences. In return for egg donations,
the advertisements offer great remunera
tions — up to $80,000.
The Daily's advertising and editorial
sections are separate departments that
function independently. Though these
types of advertisements are printed in
many issues of the paper, we chose to dis
cuss the ethical implications of egg
donorship.
If one justly considers the physical and
legal risks associated with donating eggs,
making the decision to do so will never be
easy. But given the size of the rewards
being offered today, sensibly weighing the
risks involved in egg donorship becomes
increasingly difficult. College students
often incur high debts, such as paying for
tuition and running up high credit card
bills, that make these high rewards very
tempting.
However, as medical technology
rapidly develops, it is essential that we, as
a society, take responsibility for protect
ing women from the harms of the repro
% technologies we develop anci use.
In the case of egg donorship, it is ethical
ly imperative that our society prioritizes
removing eggs from the commodities
market, as has been done with organs, so
that access to fertility in society does not
become a question of riches. Moreover,
while some couples would prefer a child
possessing a similar appearance, it is
questionable whether couples should re
quest an athletically talented, highly at
tractive and intelligent donor. Not only
does making such specifications verge on
eugenics, but also will the results of the
process remain highly uncertain. The re
lationship between nature and nurture
has not been disentangled fully, and sev
eral factors, including the pre-natal envi
ronment, nutrition, family and social en
vironments can all contribute to the de
velopment of a person.
The history of egg donorship is brief,
made possible in 1983, well after organ
and sperm donorship began. Women's
reasons for needing an egg donation vary,
but they typically revolve around infertili

ty, risk of passing on a serious genetic dis
ease and advanced age. Motivations for
donating include the altruistic goal of
helping others to bear children as well as
the desire to receive large monetary pay
ments.
When a female weighs the possibility of
donating an egg, she has many factors to
take into account. Her decision must re
flect physical, psychological, legal and eth
ical considerations.
Physically, the process for donation can
last up to four months, beginning with in
