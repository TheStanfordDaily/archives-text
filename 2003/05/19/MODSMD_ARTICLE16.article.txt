# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## E-mail my heart 
### 
It's 10 p.m. on Saturday night
and Elizabeth (lips on her
computer and signs on AIM
to chat with her fellow
columnist — and current
boyfriend — Alexander.
e11e7782: So . . . should we start
this column the way we usually do
and choose which group we are
going to piss off this week?
Alßrentl: Sounds like a plan, but
who is left? Certainly not the Left.
e11e7782: Since we are nearing
the end, we could be all-inclusive
and talk about all the people who
wrote us letters. My policy against
responding to letters prohibited
us from personally reacting to all
of our "fans." You know, letting
them in on how we felt about
their adulation or "constructive
criticism."
Alßrentl: Yeah . . . why did you
foist that constraint upon me? I re
ally wanted to write to the guy who
sent us a letter complaining about
how we don't respond to letters.
That was his fifth letter.
e11e7782: Well, it makes us look
cooler, like we don't spend 99.9
percent of our free time checking
e-mails Monday afternoons. Plus, 1
hate to give the mean people the
satisfaction of knowing I actually
did read their spiteful garbage.
Alßrentl: Why do you care? Isn't
that the whole point? Don't you
love being infamous? I certainly
do. That's why we title columns
"Bring it on!"
e11e7782: It makes me sad . . . like
they missed the point of our col
umn. I truly believe that the fact
that we love Stanford and want
what's best for the majority of the
community makes us good people,

paragons of civic virtue. Or maybe
I just don't like being told that I
wasn't loved enough by my moth
er, which makes me write evil
columns.

Alßrentl: Maybe there is a
Freudian interpretation to why we
want so much attention? Except
for the fact that we weren't the kids
who were dragged to protests be
cause we were play date-deprived
social outcasts.
e11e7782: Do you think people
care about how we actually write
our columns, managing to put 900
words down and agree on each
one every week?
Alßrentl: Well, 1 don't know if we
agree on EVERYTHING. I've no
ticed that somewhere between
"transcribing" the column and
sending it to our editor from your
personal e-mail, several tilings get
deleted and changed .... But I
would doubt people care. Al
though, if we write about the pro
cess, 1 am sure we will get angry e
mails about how we are elitists who
do evil things like listen to each
other. Which brings me to another
point: 1 think that all of those peo
ple who write us and hate us must
actually secretly love us.
e11e7782: Exactly! Why do they
keep reading our columns? If they
really hated us, why would they

take the time to read our stuff —
and write back — giving you some
sort of sick satisfaction?
Alßrentl: Well, I have a theory of
how it happens that people read
and reply. I bet that every Monday
all the hippies are hanging around
in Columbae, reading The Daily
before turning it into lunch, and
one of them is reading our col
umn. The other people see him
enjoying our column, so he tries to
cover his ass and sends us a
"mean" letter.
e11e7782: That makes perfect
sense.
Alßrentl: But you know what re
ally confuses me?
e11e7782: Capri pants?
Alßrentl: Yeah, what's the deal?
Are they long shorts or short
pants? They are in some sort of un
godly nether region. But actually,
it's how many letters we get from
people who aren't undergradu
ates.
e11e7782: Everyone knows gradu
ate students are the primary read
ership of The Daily, but what
about the letters from "other" peo
ple?
Alßrentl: Yeah, what about alum
ni and faculty, why do they care?
Don't they have more important
things to do than write to us?
Aren't we paying PWR lecturers
to, I don't know, teach writing or
something? 1 hated VVCT. I wish I
had Daniel Contreras like some
people. But I know what you're
thinking: I'm Elizabeth; I'm spe
cial; I got an A+ from the one
WCT instructor everyone liked.
e11e7782: Perhaps my greatest re
gret should be not becoming an


Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi

English major ... it would have
been so easy.
AlBrentl: Are you sure? I thought
the French I took was way hard.
But then again, you already speak
English, don't you?
e11e7782: Hey, that reminds me
of my favorite transition: "speak
ing of." For example, speaking of

your awkward attempts at
humor, isn't it hilarious how ev
eryone thinks you are a conser
vative? You would think that you
— the communications director
for the Stanford Democrats, who
annoys hundreds of people on
the e-mail list with weekly re
minders of their activities —
would not be mistaken fora
Bible-belt Republican.
AlBrentl: 1 would hope that peo
ple would not mistake crazy Left
ists for Democrats.
e11e7782: Yeah, or confuse our

column for something that isn't
100 percent sarcastic!! But any
way, it's time to be erotically exotic.
Alßrentl: Hope to see you there .
. . How much of you will I be see
ing?
Auto Response from e11e7782:
e11e7782: Trying to avoid being
accosted by half-naked angry Daily
readers.

Are you that guy who yelled at us at Ex
otic Erotic? Why don't you write us a
letter? eym@stanford.edu and ak
erulall @ Stanford, ed u.
