Columnists' view of the applications of
economics is unreal, simplistic
To the conservative mindset, universi
ties do not exist to deepen the horizon of
human understanding; they should be
called glorified trade schools pumping out
technocrats primly emblazoned with the
mantras deemed proper by their classes.
Predictably in this vein comes Elizabeth
Madjlessi and Alexander Kendall's inane
"Living in a material world" column (May
12). They protest students and anyone else
with a social conscience, claiming they are
just ignorant hippies without practical
common sense. Unfortunately, their own
writing reveals that it is Madjlessi and
Kendall who are lacking in thatcommodi
ty>
They write that "a living wage is detri
mental to workers . .. because it reduces
their employment and increases dead
weight losses." If they had been paying at
tention in lecture instead of listening to
Rush Limbaugh on their CD players, they
might have clued in to the fact that dead

weight loss is a consequence only of invol
untary, legislated minimum wages. Stan
ford's living-wage policy is a voluntary one
laid down by the employer itself. As the
professor would say in Econ 1, the supply
curve is shifted to the right. Deadweight
loss does not apply.
The columnists go on to claim that "any
remotely reasonable academic idea about
human or group behavior should be capa
ble of being reduced to a theory grounded
in explicit economic concepts." This is res
onant of Marxist historical materialism —
and like many Marxist ideas, it fails the re
ality test. Can economic ideas explain psy
chological phenomena, like memory or
learning? Can economic notions alone ex
plain conflicts between cultures or reli
gions? Was Sept. 11 entirely economic in
cause? To say that any contrary notions
are a "waste of ink" or "abominable" shows
the columnists' shallowness.
Tucked inside their words are the usual
digs at the humanities disciplines as being
unworthy, social science professors as
being ignorant — and economics (or
rather, the writers' warped view of it) as
being the foundation of all knowledge
with any relevance. In fact, the very great
est economists knew well the importance

of other disciplines and motivations.
Adam Smith wrote on moral theory and
philosophy as well as economics. Fried rich
Hayek published books on history, psy
chology and law. John Maynard Keynes
spent many years exploring literature and
art with the Bloomsbury Group.
The columnists are merely attempting
to dress up their ideological drivel with the
respect of academic scholarship.

Palestinians were 'encouraged to leave
Israel* in 1948
Regarding Rula Ra/ek's letter, "Re
membering the tragic loss of Palestinian
homeland" (May 14).
I have done interviews with nine rela
tives and close friends (who were Israelis).
They were eye witnesses in the 1948
events, which I know they won't lie to me
about.
I still have to summarize it and translate
it, but here is a summary I wrote:
In 1948 the Arab refugees were en
couraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders,

promising to purge the land of Jewish
people. They were told that more than 80
percent left by themselves, without any Is
raeli involvement; 68 percent left without
ever seeing an Israeli soldier.
Arab leaders called the Palestinian peo
ple (on Arab Radio stations) to leave their
homes and land. Also, Arab armies which
invaded and took over part of Israel in
1948, convinced the Palestinians to leave
their home and land, in order to make the
full invasion of Israel easier for the Arab
armies (their explanation convinced most
of the Palestinian to run away).
My explanation, based on my inter
view: In 1948, the Arab leaders wanted to
free the land for themselves and their peo
ple from the surrounding countries.

Stanford fortunate to have 'students of
conscience'
I read with great interest the story
about the commemoration of Nakba Day
in White Plaza ("Nakba Day remembers
Palestine," May 15). I am pleased that

Stanford has such students of conscience
willing to buck the Israeli government's
decades-old campaign of lies concerning
the forced migration of the Palestinian
people from their homeland in 1947-48.
Despite the dispossession of the Palestini
ans then and now, justice shall be theirs in
the end.
