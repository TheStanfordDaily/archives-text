and California (21-5) yesterday in
Athens, Georgia. The Cardinal's
reward is tomorrow's semifinal
matchup with undefeated No. 1
Illinois — but it will come when
Stanford is playing its best tennis
of the year.
The Fighting Illini are 29-0 and
have not lost more than two points
in any dual match.
"Illinois's never been this far in
the tournament before, so I'm
sure they'll be nervous," senior

Scott Lipsky said. "They have a ton
of fans here, but we can't let that
bother us.
The best evidence of Stanford's
rapid improvement is yesterday's
shutout of the Golden Bears.
Since the 2002 season, the last
four matches between Cal and
Stanford had been decided by 4-3
scores. This season, the squads
split their regular season series —
the Bears won in Berkeley on Feb.
1 and the Cardinal emerged victo
rious on the Farm on April 10.
Stanford broke the tradition this
time around, demolishing the
Bears 4-0.
The Cardinal's run in NCAA
tournament play has been perfect,
as the team has yet to lose a point
and has won all four of its matches
4-0.
Senior Ail-Americans David
Martin and Lipsky led the charge
in the Round of 16.
In doubles, Martin and Lipsky,
the fourth-ranked tandem in the

nation, destroyed Cal's No. 8 duo
of Robert Kowalcyzk and Steve
Berke 8-1. The drubbing was even
more impressive considering
Kowalcyzk and Berke had beaten
Martin and Lipsky 8-6 only five
weeks previously.
"We played really well in dou
bles," Lipsky said. "They won the
first game and then we won eight
games in a row. And they weren't
playing badly, we were just doing
everything right."
Stanford clinched the doubles
point on the second court. Fresh
men KC Corkery and James Fade
went down a break of serve early
on, but battled back to post an 8-6
win over John-Paul Fruterro and
Mik Ledvanova.
The Cardinal kept things
rolling in singles. Corkery put
Stanford up 2-0 when he closed a
6-2, 6-1 beating of Or Dekel on
court three. Next up was No. 8
Martin, who beat the serve-and
volleving Fruterro 6-3, 6-2 on

court one to put the Cardinal with
in one point of victory.
All eyes turned to court two
where Lipsky was closing in on the
win against Cal's Conor Niland.
This was the third meeting be
tween the two this season. In both
of the previous matches, Lipsky
won the first set only to have Ni
land come from behind to win in
three.
It looked as though history
might repeat itself. Lipsky won
the first set 6-3 and led 4-1 in the
second, only to have Niland
claw his way back to take a 6-5
lead. Lipsky won the next game
to force a tiebreaker, but the sit
uation looked dire for the Car
dinal as Niland led 6-3 in the
tiebreaker.
Lipsky simply refused to lose.
"It was the same thing that hap
pened the last two times," Lipsky
said. "I was up a set and a break
