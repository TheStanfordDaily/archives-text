# Baseball clinches Pac-10 crown outright

### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With no Pacific-10 Conference
title hopes of their own, the UCLA
Bruins seemed bent on ruining
the Cardinal's hopes this weekend
at Sunken Diamond.
While Stanford (38-15, 18-6
Pac-10) rolled over the Bruins 9-1
on Friday, UCLA (26-30, 9-12)
fought back with a 12th-inning

grand slam to claim Saturday's
contest. Sunday's rubber game
was to determine far more than
the series victory: the Cardinal
needed a win to claim outright
possession of the Pac-10 title, and

that's just what they got with a 9-8,
10-inning decision.
Deja vu crept in as Sunday's
game went into extra innings. This
time, however, the home-run hero
was a Cardinal, as sophomore
Donny Lucy led off the bottom of
the 10th with a walk-off shot over
the left field wall.
"I'm on cloud nine right now,"
said Lucy after the game-winning
homer. "It felt like I was floating

around the bases."
While Sunday's game certainly
ended in the Cardinal's favor, a
seesaw battle between the two
teams gave Sunken Diamond pa
trons their money's worth.
When UCLA's Billy Susdorf
knocked a two-run homer off
Stanford senior Tim Cunningham
in the top of the first inning, it be
came apparent that the Cardinal
was in fora hard battle for its con
ference crown.
Sophomores Chris Carter and
Danny Putnam answered with
back-to-back home runs in the sec
ond inning.
Cunningham's numerous
three-ball counts gave Cardinal
fans plenty to be nervous about,
but the veteran battled his way out
of jams and kept the Cardinal in
the game for five innings. He left
the game after giving up a solo
homer in the top of the sixth and
freshman Kodiak Quick took the
hill with a 5-4 Cardinal lead.
Quick's control seemed perfect
as he fanned the first two batters
he faced, but he then lost the
strike zone, walking two in a row.
Two hits and two runs later, he
handed the ball to junior David
O'Hagan with runners on second
and third.
O'Hagan put out the fire by
forcing a fly-out to center field, but
gave up a two-run homer in the
next inning to extend the Bruins'
lead to 8-5.
The third pitching change was
the charm for the Cardinal.
Senior Ryan McCally replaced
O'Hagan and shut down the
Bruin offense, allowing just two
hits and no runs while striking out

day helped the Cardinal tie things up in the eighth and marked the senior's 74th RBI of the season.
