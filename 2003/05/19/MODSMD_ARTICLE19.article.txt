# Baseball clinches Pac-10 crown outright
## 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With no Pacific-10 Conference
title hopes of their own, the UCLA
Bruins seemed bent on ruining
the Cardinal's hopes this weekend
at Sunken Diamond.
While Stanford (38-15, 18-6
Pac-10) rolled over the Bruins 9-1
on Friday, UCLA (26-30, 9-12)
fought back with a 12th-inning

grand slam to claim Saturday's
contest. Sunday's rubber game
was to determine far more than
the series victory: the Cardinal
needed a win to claim outright
possession of the Pac-10 title, and

that's just what they got with a 9-8,
10-inning decision.
Deja vu crept in as Sunday's
game went into extra innings. This
time, however, the home-run hero
was a Cardinal, as sophomore
Donny Lucy led off the bottom of
the 10th with a walk-off shot over
the left field wall.
"I'm on cloud nine right now,"
said Lucy after the game-winning
homer. "It felt like I was floating

around the bases."
While Sunday's game certainly
ended in the Cardinal's favor, a
seesaw battle between the two
teams gave Sunken Diamond pa
trons their money's worth.
When UCLA's Billy Susdorf
knocked a two-run homer off
Stanford senior Tim Cunningham
in the top of the first inning, it be
came apparent that the Cardinal
was in fora hard battle for its con
ference crown.
Sophomores Chris Carter and
Danny Putnam answered with
back-to-back home runs in the sec
ond inning.
Cunningham's numerous
three-ball counts gave Cardinal
fans plenty to be nervous about,
but the veteran battled his way out
of jams and kept the Cardinal in
the game for five innings. He left
the game after giving up a solo
homer in the top of the sixth and
freshman Kodiak Quick took the
hill with a 5-4 Cardinal lead.
Quick's control seemed perfect
as he fanned the first two batters
he faced, but he then lost the
strike zone, walking two in a row.
Two hits and two runs later, he
handed the ball to junior David
O'Hagan with runners on second
and third.
O'Hagan put out the fire by
forcing a fly-out to center field, but
gave up a two-run homer in the
next inning to extend the Bruins'
lead to 8-5.
The third pitching change was
the charm for the Cardinal.
Senior Ryan McCally replaced
O'Hagan and shut down the
Bruin offense, allowing just two
hits and no runs while striking out

six in four innings.
McCally's dominance on the
mound gave the Cardinal of
fense a chance to rally. Putnam
blasted a two-run opposite-field
homer in the bottom of the sev
enth — his second of the day —
to bring the Cardinal within one
run.
Senior Ryan Garko, who had
not appeared in the game while
Lucy was behind the plate, was
brought in to pinch-hit in the
eighth after junior Sam Fuld
legged out a triple.
As he has delivered in the clutch
so many times before, Garko lifted
a long fly ball to left field that gave
Fuld more than enough time to
tag up from third to tie the score at
eight apiece.
A scoreless ninth frame took the
game into the l()th inning, when
UCLA continued to be stifled by
McCally and Lucy blasted his
game-winner.
"We just wanted to win really
bad today," Putnam said. "Nobody
wanted to share a title."
Saturday and Sunday may

have produced long battles, but
Friday's contest belonged to the
Cardinal the whole way as junior
John Hudgins dominated on the
hill.
Hudgins' previous two starts
were rather shaky, with a com
mon theory being 1 that his'arni
was tired from his hefty workload
this year.
This may have been the case,
but if Hudgins had lost any en
durance for awhile, he found it on
Friday. Throwing his fifth com
plete game of the season, Hudgins
tossed a four-hitter over nine in
nings, striking out 10.
"Personally, my mentality was
to come into tonight's game just to
have fun playing baseball and be a
little looser," Hudgins said.
The .Cardinal offense likewise
did its part, as every member of the
lineup had at least one hit and
Stanford won 9-1.
In Saturday's contest, freshman
starter Mark Romanczuk deliv
ered another solid performance,
leaving the game with the Cardi
nal leading 5-3. When Romanczuk
gave up a single to start the ninth,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
brought in freshman Matt Man
ship.
Manship gave up two runs to

even the score but settled and shut
out the Bruins for the next two in
nings. However, the Cardinal of
fense was also unable to produce a
run in this time.
Two fielding errors and an in
tentional walk loaded the bases in
the 12 th, tfYid UCIA's grafi'd-slam
home run gave them a 9-5 lead
that would hold through the bot
tom of the inning to end the
game.
Despite only one of his runs
being earned, Manship took the
loss, and Romanczuk's no-decision
keeps him at 10-0.
"We had a lot of opportunities
to win today, but UCLA won the
big spots," Marquess said.
Arizona State also lost on Satur
day, meaning the Cardinal was
guaranteed at least a share of the
Pac-10 title.
With Sunday's dramatic victo
ry, however, it proved to be a moot
point.
Winning the Pac-10 is more im
portant than the mere title, ac
cording to Marquess.
"To win the Pac-10 outright is
huge in terms of our chances to
host an NCAA regional," Mar
quess said. "I can't remember the
last time a Pac-10 winner that has
put in a bid hasn't hosted."

keeps him at 10-0.
"We had a lot of opportunities
to win today, but UCLA won the
big spots," Marquess said.
Arizona State also lost on Satur
day, meaning the Cardinal was
guaranteed at least a share of the
Pac-10 title.
With Sunday's dramatic victo
ry, however, it proved to be a moot
point.
Winning the Pac-10 is more im
portant than the mere title, ac
cording to Marquess.
"To win the Pac-10 outright is
huge in terms of our chances to
host an NCAA regional," Mar
quess said. "I can't remember the
last time a Pac-10 winner that has
put in a bid hasn't hosted."
With no Pacific-10 Conference
title hopes of their own, the UCLA
Bruins seemed bent on ruining
the Cardinal's hopes this weekend
at Sunken Diamond.

Pac-10) rolled over the Bruins 9-1
on Friday, UCLA (26-30, 9-12)
fought back with a 12th-inning

grand slam to claim Saturday's
contest. Sunday's rubber game
was to determine far more than
the series victory: the Cardinal
needed a win to claim outright
possession of the Pac-10 title, and

that's just what they got with a 9-8,
10-inning decision.
Deja vu crept in as Sunday's
game went into extra innings. This
time, however, the home-run hero
was a Cardinal, as sophomore
Donny Lucy led off the bottom of
the 10th with a walk-off shot over
the left field wall.
"I'm on cloud nine right now,"
said Lucy after the game-winning
homer. "It felt like I was floating

around the bases."
While Sunday's game certainly
ended in the Cardinal's favor, a
seesaw battle between the two
teams gave Sunken Diamond pa
trons their money's worth.
When UCLA's Billy Susdorf
knocked a two-run homer off
Stanford senior Tim Cunningham
in the top of the first inning, it be
came apparent that the Cardinal
was in fora hard battle for its con
ference crown.
Sophomores Chris Carter and
Danny Putnam answered with
back-to-back home runs in the sec
ond inning.
Cunningham's numerous
three-ball counts gave Cardinal
fans plenty to be nervous about,
but the veteran battled his way out
of jams and kept the Cardinal in
the game for five innings. He left
the game after giving up a solo
homer in the top of the sixth and
freshman Kodiak Quick took the
hill with a 5-4 Cardinal lead.
Quick's control seemed perfect
as he fanned the first two batters
he faced, but he then lost the
strike zone, walking two in a row.
Two hits and two runs later, he
handed the ball to junior David
O'Hagan with runners on second
and third.
O'Hagan put out the fire by
forcing a fly-out to center field, but
gave up a two-run homer in the
next inning to extend the Bruins'
lead to 8-5.
The third pitching change was
the charm for the Cardinal.
Senior Ryan McCally replaced
O'Hagan and shut down the
Bruin offense, allowing just two
hits and no runs while striking out

six in four innings.
McCally's dominance on the
mound gave the Cardinal of
fense a chance to rally. Putnam
blasted a two-run opposite-field
homer in the bottom of the sev
enth — his second of the day —
to bring the Cardinal within one
run.
Senior Ryan Garko, who had
not appeared in the game while
Lucy was behind the plate, was
brought in to pinch-hit in the
eighth after junior Sam Fuld
legged out a triple.
As he has delivered in the clutch
so many times before, Garko lifted
a long fly ball to left field that gave
Fuld more than enough time to
tag up from third to tie the score at
eight apiece.
A scoreless ninth frame took the
game into the l()th inning, when
UCLA continued to be stifled by
McCally and Lucy blasted his
game-winner.
"We just wanted to win really
bad today," Putnam said. "Nobody
wanted to share a title."
Saturday and Sunday may

have produced long battles, but
Friday's contest belonged to the
Cardinal the whole way as junior
John Hudgins dominated on the
hill.
Hudgins' previous two starts
were rather shaky, with a com
mon theory being 1 that his'arni
was tired from his hefty workload
this year.
This may have been the case,
but if Hudgins had lost any en
durance for awhile, he found it on
Friday. Throwing his fifth com
plete game of the season, Hudgins
tossed a four-hitter over nine in
nings, striking out 10.
"Personally, my mentality was
to come into tonight's game just to
have fun playing baseball and be a
little looser," Hudgins said.
The .Cardinal offense likewise
did its part, as every member of the
lineup had at least one hit and
Stanford won 9-1.
In Saturday's contest, freshman
starter Mark Romanczuk deliv
ered another solid performance,
leaving the game with the Cardi
nal leading 5-3. When Romanczuk
gave up a single to start the ninth,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
brought in freshman Matt Man
ship.
Manship gave up two runs to

even the score but settled and shut
out the Bruins for the next two in
nings. However, the Cardinal of
fense was also unable to produce a
run in this time.
Two fielding errors and an in
tentional walk loaded the bases in
the 12 th, tfYid UCIA's grafi'd-slam
home run gave them a 9-5 lead
that would hold through the bot
tom of the inning to end the
game.
Despite only one of his runs
being earned, Manship took the
loss, and Romanczuk's no-decision
keeps him at 10-0.
"We had a lot of opportunities
to win today, but UCLA won the
big spots," Marquess said.
