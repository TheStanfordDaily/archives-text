Even an excellent final round

youth topped experience for
the Stanford team. Sophomore
Kevin Blue continued to lead
the Cardinal, following up his
first-round 77 with a 1-under
par 71.

rain, Blue was able to move up
the leader board into a tie for
37th place individually.

avoid the meltdowns that pro
