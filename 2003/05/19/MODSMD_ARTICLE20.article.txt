# Regional's traps prove too much for men
## Golf strokes to 15th 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even an excellent final round
at t his weekend's NCAA West
ern Regional was not enough to
qualify the Stanford men's golf
team for the national champi
onship. The Cardinal finished
strong, but only managed to tie
for 15th out of a field of 27, far
behind victorious No. 11 UCLA.
After a slow start on Thurs
day, Stanford was hard-pressed
to climb back into contention for
a championship berth. At par 72
and 7,304 yards, the Washing
ton National Golf Club was a se
vere test of golf, and low rounds
were few and far between.
"Probably the most difficult
part was that the greens were
firm, making the pins hard to

get at," senior Jim Seki said. "If
you were going to make a birdie,
it was going to be a putt from 30
feet away."
For the second day in a row,
youth topped experience for
the Stanford team. Sophomore
Kevin Blue continued to lead
the Cardinal, following up his
first-round 77 with a 1-under
par 71.
With much of the field strug
gling to negotiate the tough ter
rain, Blue was able to move up
the leader board into a tie for
37th place individually.
Cardinal junior Blake
Mastalir matched Blue's 71. Al
though Mastalir's round was a
bit up-and-down, he was able to
avoid the meltdowns that pro

duced his opening-round 84. His
solid play sent him soaring past
many other competitors to a tie for
89th plate.

George Downing posted a 77 on
Friday, settling into 94th place.

The most surprising round of
the day was turned in by Seki.
The team's leader throughout the
year self-destructed on the sec
ond day, shooting 84 — his worst
round of the season. After his 79
on Thursday, he sank to 125 th
place overall.
As the Cardinal slipped fur
ther away from the leaders,
UCIA showed why it has been
one of the strongest squads in the
country this year. With all five
players on the team shooting par
or better on the day, Bruin John
Merrick went low, posting a
course-record 67.
At the end of Friday's round,
UCLA was the only team under
par, and the Bruins held a nine
shot lead over No. 7 Arizona. Stan
ford, on the other hand, was 43
shots off the Bruins' leading pace.
More importantly, the Cardinal
needed to make up 20 shots to
move into the top 10 and secure an
NCAA berth.
With an uphill battle ahead,
Stanford responded admirably,
playing its best round of the tour
nament.
"I think that the weather and a
lot of early adversity took a lot out
of us," coach Jeff Mitchell said. "I
was, though, very proud of the
way everyone came together and
played with a lot of heart and pride

on the second and third days."
Blue continued to lead the
team, carding a 2-over par 74 on
the final day. I lis play allowed him
to move up just a single spot on the
leader board, finishing the event
in a tie for 36th place overall.
Mastalir came down the home
stretch playing some of his best
golf in recent weeks. He backed up
his 71 in the second round with a
matching score on Saturday, con
cluding the event in a tie for 67th
place.
Downing regained a measure
of the consistency that served him
well earlier in the year, shooting a
1-over par 73 and finishing in a tie
for 78th place in his first career
western regional.
Won also rediscovered some
early-season consistency. Just
three bogeys marred his final
round scorecard as he posted a 72
on Saturday.
This score propelled him up
the leader board, although he
could only manage a lie for 98th
place overall.
Seki looked more like himself
on Saturday, posting a 71. Despite
his strong finish, Seki wrapped up
the tournament in 106 th place. It
was his worst performance of the
year.
Despite a late charge by Michael
Putnam of Pepperdine, who shot a
course-record 64 on Saturday,
New Mexico's Michael Letzig took
home top individual honors with
his 8-under-par total.
Although the team failed to
qualify for the national champi
onship, Mitchell had nothing but
praise for his trio of seniors:
"I couldn't be prouder than to
have coached Jim Seki, Ron Won
and George Downing," Mitchell
said. "I am excited about my se
niors beginning a new chapter in
their lives and the prospect of get
ting ready for next year."

praise for his trio of seniors:
"I couldn't be prouder than to
have coached Jim Seki, Ron Won

said. "I am excited about my se
niors beginning a new chapter in
their lives and the prospect of get
ting ready for next year."
Even an excellent final round
at t his weekend's NCAA West
ern Regional was not enough to
qualify the Stanford men's golf
team for the national champi
onship. The Cardinal finished
strong, but only managed to tie
for 15th out of a field of 27, far
behind victorious No. 11 UCLA.
After a slow start on Thurs
day, Stanford was hard-pressed
to climb back into contention for
a championship berth. At par 72
and 7,304 yards, the Washing
ton National Golf Club was a se
vere test of golf, and low rounds
were few and far between.
"Probably the most difficult
part was that the greens were
firm, making the pins hard to

get at," senior Jim Seki said. "If
you were going to make a birdie,
it was going to be a putt from 30
feet away."
For the second day in a row,
youth topped experience for
the Stanford team. Sophomore
Kevin Blue continued to lead
the Cardinal, following up his
first-round 77 with a 1-under
par 71.
With much of the field strug
gling to negotiate the tough ter
rain, Blue was able to move up
the leader board into a tie for
37th place individually.
Cardinal junior Blake
Mastalir matched Blue's 71. Al
though Mastalir's round was a
bit up-and-down, he was able to
avoid the meltdowns that pro

duced his opening-round 84. His
solid play sent him soaring past
many other competitors to a tie for
89th plate.
A shot back of Mastalir, senior
George Downing posted a 77 on
Friday, settling into 94th place.
Fellow senior Ron Won continued
to struggle with his game, carding
a 79 to tie for 114 th.
The most surprising round of
the day was turned in by Seki.
The team's leader throughout the
year self-destructed on the sec
ond day, shooting 84 — his worst
round of the season. After his 79
on Thursday, he sank to 125 th
place overall.
As the Cardinal slipped fur
ther away from the leaders,
UCIA showed why it has been
one of the strongest squads in the
country this year. With all five
players on the team shooting par
or better on the day, Bruin John
Merrick went low, posting a
course-record 67.
At the end of Friday's round,
UCLA was the only team under
par, and the Bruins held a nine
shot lead over No. 7 Arizona. Stan
ford, on the other hand, was 43
shots off the Bruins' leading pace.
More importantly, the Cardinal
needed to make up 20 shots to
move into the top 10 and secure an
NCAA berth.
With an uphill battle ahead,
Stanford responded admirably,
playing its best round of the tour
nament.
"I think that the weather and a
lot of early adversity took a lot out
of us," coach Jeff Mitchell said. "I
was, though, very proud of the
way everyone came together and
played with a lot of heart and pride

on the second and third days."
Blue continued to lead the
team, carding a 2-over par 74 on
the final day. I lis play allowed him
to move up just a single spot on the
leader board, finishing the event
in a tie for 36th place overall.
Mastalir came down the home
stretch playing some of his best
golf in recent weeks. He backed up
his 71 in the second round with a
matching score on Saturday, con
cluding the event in a tie for 67th
place.
Downing regained a measure
of the consistency that served him
well earlier in the year, shooting a
1-over par 73 and finishing in a tie
for 78th place in his first career
western regional.
Won also rediscovered some
early-season consistency. Just
three bogeys marred his final
round scorecard as he posted a 72
on Saturday.
This score propelled him up
the leader board, although he
could only manage a lie for 98th
place overall.
Seki looked more like himself
on Saturday, posting a 71. Despite
his strong finish, Seki wrapped up
the tournament in 106 th place. It
was his worst performance of the
year.
Despite a late charge by Michael
Putnam of Pepperdine, who shot a
course-record 64 on Saturday,
New Mexico's Michael Letzig took
home top individual honors with
his 8-under-par total.
Although the team failed to
qualify for the national champi
onship, Mitchell had nothing but
praise for his trio of seniors:
"I couldn't be prouder than to
have coached Jim Seki, Ron Won
and George Downing," Mitchell
said. "I am excited about my se
niors beginning a new chapter in
their lives and the prospect of get
ting ready for next year."
