This season the No. 17 Stanford
Softball team (41-26) upset a few of
the big dogs (namely, No 1. Arizona
and No. 8 Washington), but this
past weekend the Cardinal learned
how it feels to be on the other side
when it counts.

Saturday: Georgia Tech 1, Stanford 0

Stanford's season ended early
when the second-seeded Cardinal
fell in two consecutive contests to
Southern Illinois and Georgia
Tech.
"We are definitely disappointed
at the outcome, but in looking at the
entire year I think we have a lot to
be proud of," Cardinal coach John
Rittman said. "Certainly we would
have liked to have gone farther in
the tournament."
The battle with UT-Chat
tanooga began with four scoreless
innings and two dominant pitchers
in the circle.
Chipping away at the Lady Mocs
was the hot bat of senior second
baseman Kira Ching. The Pacific
-10 Honorable Mention infielder
earned the title of Stanford's all
time career leader in triples with
her 1 0th career triple in the bottom
of the second.
Then rest of the Cardinal would
follow Ching's lead as she initiated a
rally in the bottom of the fifth with a
single.
Sophomore third baseman Eliz
abeth Bendig stepped up with a sin
gle of her own before Chattanooga
pitcher Awberey Winckler got two

outs for her side.
But, the Cardinal kept fighting
and broke through with two outs
and runners on second and third.
Freshman center fielder Catali
na Morris drove in the first run of
the inning with a base-hit to center
field when sophomore Meghan
Sickler came up in the clutch as a
pinch-hitter and delivered another
RBI single up the middle.
The 2-0 advantage proved to be
enough as senior pitcher Tori Ny
berg stepped in for the remaining
two innings to close out the game
and shut out the Lady Mocs.
Sorensen posted her 71 st career
win, putting her at the top of Stan
ford's all-time career win list.

Friday did not bring a similar fate.
The first contest of the day fea
tured No. 6 seeded Southern Illi
nois. The Salukis were on a mission
that began with an upset of three
seed Massachusetts the day before,
continued with the Cardinal, and
led them to the tournament's
championship game.
Southern Illinois got on the
boards first in the bottom of the sec
ond. Before the advantage turned
into a rally, freshman Laura Sever
son took over the rubber and shut
down the following two batters to
end the inning.
But the Salukis kept on charg
ing, adding three more runs in the
third on the combination of two

doubles.
Hie Cardinal did not go down
without a fight as it narrowed the
lead to 4-1 in the top of the fourth
when freshman shortstop Lauren
Lappin drove in senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham.
This would be the only run of the
game for the Stanford offense, but
Southern Illinois did not stop until
it widened the gap to 6-1 on 11 hits.
The Cardinal was only able to
pound out three hits, one each from
Brangham, Ching, and Lappin.
The loss sent Stanford to the
loser's bracket of the tournament
and a game against seven-seed
Georgia Tech.
Sorensen led the Cardinal from
the circle and dominated the Yel
low Jackets, striking out the first
four consecutive batters and eight
of the first 11 to step into the box.
The Cardinal was unable to
jumpstart its offense and the first
eight innings of the fight remained
scoreless.
Then, in the top of the ninth in
ning the Yellow Jackets got on the
board when Geogia Tech's Lind
say Wood delivered an RBI dou
ble to post the first and final run of
the game. Sorensen quickly re
tired the next batter, but the Car
dinal was incapable of recording a
hit or pushing a single run across
the plate.
The heartbreaker signaled the
end of the Cardinal season, but
Stanford is trying to maintain some
perspective on its 2003 effort.
"Our goal was to get to the Col
lege World Series and make a play
for the national championship, but
as time goes by we can look back at
the many accomplishments this
team had over the course of the sea
son," Rittman said. "But right now
it is still kind of fresh and it hurts."
