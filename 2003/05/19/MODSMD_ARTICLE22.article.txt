## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Both the men's and women's
track and field squads came on
strong down the stretch at the Pa
cific- 10 Conference Champi
onships, but neither team had
enough to upset the favorites as
both settled for second.
The No. 10 men scored 27
points in the penultimate event,
the men's 5,000, vaulting the team
from fourth to second. But it was
not enough to catch No. 3 USC as
the Trojans defeated the two-time
defending champion Cardinal
139-128. No. 17 Oregon, who led
after the first day, finished third
with 127 points.
The Cardinal tied with USC for
the most individual Pac-10 titles as
each squad took home five.
All t he winners came from Stan
ford's famed distance squad,
which took top honors in every
event from 800 to 10,000 meters,
including the 3,000 steeplechase.
Junior Louis Luchini led the way,
sweeping the 10,000 and 5,000 in
close tactical races. This is the sec
ond consecutive year that a Cardinal
runner has swept those events.
Luchini led Stanford runners to

1-3-5-7 and 1-3-4-5-7 finishes in
the 10,000 and 5,000, respectively.
Sophomore lan Dobson upset
Oregon's Brett Holts for the
steeplechase title in a personal-best
8 minutes, 50.59 seconds.
When Stanford freshman Ryan
Hall, who had the fastest prelimi
nary time, fell half-way through
the race, junior Grant Robison
stepped up to overcome USC's
Tomasz Babiskiewiecz to win the
1,500 in 3:44.42. Robison raced
again, just three hours later, finish
ing third in the 5,000.
The biggest surprise of the dis
tance races was redshirt freshman
Justin Romaniuk's victory in the
800 with a personal-best 1:49.86.
Overall, the men scored 88 of
their 128 points in the distance
events.
The field events also produced
big marks this weekend. Competing
in his first Pac-10 meet, freshman
Solomon Welch performed ad
mirably, finishing fourth in the
triple jump and setting a freshman
school record of 50 feet, 9.50 inches.
In the hammer, senior Nick
Welihozkiy finished a close second
to Oregon's Adam Kir/. Kirz

221-1. I'he mark is a personal-best

for Welihozkiy and No. 3 all-time
at Stanford.
The No. 7 women beat No. 6
USC but fell to the defending
champions, No. 4 UCLA. The Bru
ins scored 155 points to the Cardi

secutive year that Stanford has
scored more than 100 points at the
Pac-10 (championships.
The women were also led by
their strong distance contingent
and four-time NCAA champion,
senior Lauren Fleshman.
Fleshman took second in the
1,500 in a personal best 4:14.68
and won the 5,000 for the second
consecutive year in 16:37.52. She
led a 1-2-3 sweep in the 5,000 for
the Cardinal, vaulting the squad
comfortably into second.
Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
won the 10,000 in 33:42.29 and
sophomore Sara Bei took second
in 33:58.06. Both marks are auto
matic NCAA qualifying times.
Freshman Nashonme Johnson
came back strong after a disap
pointing seventh in the 100 to fin
ish second in the 200 to USC's
Natasha Mayers, one of the fa
vorites for the NCAA title in June.
Johnson also anchored the
1,600-meter relay team to an upset

victory as the Cardinal out-sprint
ed Arizona State and Washington
State for the title in 3:35.10.
I lie Cardinal got a clutch per
formance from junior Lillian Bush
in the long jump as she finished
second in 19-11.75; this comes on
the heels of Hush's runner-up fin
ish and NCAA automatic qualifica

tion in the heptathlon.
The women's throwing team
was off its game this weekend as
only juniot jillian Camarena pro
duced a finish better than eighth.
Camarena finished second to
UCLA's Jessica Crosby, the de
fending NCAA champion, with a

Senior Nick Welihozkiy finished second in the hammer throw at Pac-lOs this weekend with a 221-01, marking a
personal best to cap the senior's collegiate career. The throw now stands as the third-best all-time mark for Stanford.
Both the men's and women's
track and field squads came on
strong down the stretch at the Pa
cific- 10 Conference Champi
onships, but neither team had
enough to upset the favorites as
both settled for second.
The No. 10 men scored 27
points in the penultimate event,
the men's 5,000, vaulting the team
from fourth to second. But it was
not enough to catch No. 3 USC as
the Trojans defeated the two-time
defending champion Cardinal
139-128. No. 17 Oregon, who led
after the first day, finished third
with 127 points.
The Cardinal tied with USC for
the most individual Pac-10 titles as
each squad took home five.
All t he winners came from Stan
ford's famed distance squad,
which took top honors in every
event from 800 to 10,000 meters,
including the 3,000 steeplechase.
Junior Louis Luchini led the way,
sweeping the 10,000 and 5,000 in
close tactical races. This is the sec
ond consecutive year that a Cardinal
runner has swept those events.
Luchini led Stanford runners to

1-3-5-7 and 1-3-4-5-7 finishes in
the 10,000 and 5,000, respectively.
Sophomore lan Dobson upset
Oregon's Brett Holts for the
steeplechase title in a personal-best
8 minutes, 50.59 seconds.
When Stanford freshman Ryan
Hall, who had the fastest prelimi
nary time, fell half-way through
the race, junior Grant Robison
stepped up to overcome USC's
Tomasz Babiskiewiecz to win the
1,500 in 3:44.42. Robison raced
again, just three hours later, finish
ing third in the 5,000.
The biggest surprise of the dis
tance races was redshirt freshman
Justin Romaniuk's victory in the
800 with a personal-best 1:49.86.
Overall, the men scored 88 of
their 128 points in the distance
events.
The field events also produced
big marks this weekend. Competing
in his first Pac-10 meet, freshman
Solomon Welch performed ad
mirably, finishing fourth in the
triple jump and setting a freshman
school record of 50 feet, 9.50 inches.
In the hammer, senior Nick
Welihozkiy finished a close second
to Oregon's Adam Kir/. Kirz
through 221-5 to Welihozkiy's
221-1. I'he mark is a personal-best

for Welihozkiy and No. 3 all-time
at Stanford.
The No. 7 women beat No. 6
USC but fell to the defending
champions, No. 4 UCLA. The Bru
ins scored 155 points to the Cardi
nal's 140. This marks the sixth con
secutive year that Stanford has
scored more than 100 points at the
Pac-10 (championships.
The women were also led by
their strong distance contingent
and four-time NCAA champion,
senior Lauren Fleshman.

1,500 in a personal best 4:14.68
and won the 5,000 for the second
consecutive year in 16:37.52. She
led a 1-2-3 sweep in the 5,000 for
the Cardinal, vaulting the squad
comfortably into second.
Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
won the 10,000 in 33:42.29 and
sophomore Sara Bei took second
in 33:58.06. Both marks are auto
matic NCAA qualifying times.
Freshman Nashonme Johnson
came back strong after a disap
pointing seventh in the 100 to fin
ish second in the 200 to USC's
Natasha Mayers, one of the fa
vorites for the NCAA title in June.
