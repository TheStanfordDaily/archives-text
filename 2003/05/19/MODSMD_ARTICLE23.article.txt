# Panelists discuss global development
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Can genuine independence be
achieved in developing countries,
especially in poor rural communi
ties? That was the question posed
at the second annual Stanford As
sociation for International Devel
opment conference, and the an
swer that speakers and panelists
presented was remarkably hope
ful.
The keynote speaker and a
panel of six international develop
ment experts related how their
work helped third-world commu
nities achieve self-reliance.
The SAID conference also fo
cused on students, bringing 14 stu
dent panelists to share their expe
riences in topics from internation
al research to graduate student

perspectives on international de
velopment.
"The idea is to bring in people
who have dedicated their lives to
[international development]," said
senior Jessica Mantooth, one ofthe
organizers, "but it can also be
something people are doing in
summers â€” that's why we have
the student sessions."
Organizers saw the conference
as a networking tool and a way to
expose students to the amazing
things other students have done.
Keynote speaker Robson
Zimuto, who grew up on a small
farm in Zimbabwe, explained
how Heifer International,
where he works, promotes self
reliance by not just giving ani
mals to communities but also by
training the communities to care
for the animals and requiring

the recipients to pass on one of
the offspring.
"You might be able to under
stand from our experience
whether self-reliance is possible,"
he said.
He then went on to explain how
he has seen "more animals and im
provements in ownership ... and
increased agricultural produc
tion."
"Some recipients become
donors themselves," he added, re
lating how the walls in the head
quarters had been donated by vil
lagers who had once received gifts.
"1 think self-reliance is being
achieved and independence is
possible," he concluded.
Panelist April Watson, who
works with World Neighbors, ex
plained how her non-governmen
tal organization worked with local

groups to help them become self
sufficient in funding.
Balu Iyer, another panelist,
said that "self-reliance comes
down to economic justice" and ex
plained how self-reliance needs to
occur not just at local community
levels but also at the level of creat
ing a sustainable support organi
zation.
David Werner, author of
"Where There Is No Doctor,"
summed up the panel with a sim
ple statement: "You have to figure
out what self-reliance means," he
said. "We have to be self-reliant in
humanity.
"We as Americans can learn a
lot from poor communities about
coming together in times of need,"
Werner added. "We've lost a lot of
that today."
In one panel on international
research, one student had found
ed a health care group in rural
Mexico, another had interviewed
genocide victims and perpetrators
in Rwanda and a third had studied
forest growth in rural India.
The students spoke not only
of the rewards of research but
also of the challenges. They all
echoed the necessity of learn
ing the local language, under
standing the limits of what is
possible and building trust.
Each one could pinpoint a
time where his or her research
became overwhelming. How
ever, every student echoed a
positive result.
"Students have a lot to add,"
said senior Alyson Thomas, anoth
er organizer. "They can say, 'This
is what matters to me,' and 'I've
done it.'
"They can answer what it is like
for someone from the first world to
go give supplies to someone in
Ghana," she explained.
"These people are so lucky to
have this opportunity," said senior
Anamaria Nino-Murcia. "There
was no conference like this before
1 traveled to India."
