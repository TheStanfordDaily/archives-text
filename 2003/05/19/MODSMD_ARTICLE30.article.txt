# Reports spur SARS criticism
## 
### PAUL THORTON DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. â€” A Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention report released
Wednesday spurred further criticism of the UC-
Berkeley's far-reaching SARS policy.
The CDC report advised against quarantining stu
dents from SARS-affected countries and canceling
classes in which they are enrolled.
Although the report does not directly mention UC-
Berkeley's controversial policy of banning most summer stu
dents from SARS-affected countries, opponents of the ban
point to it as an indirect criticism of the university's policy.
"In many ways [Chancellor Robert Berdahl] has
sought to justify UC-Berkeley's policy by citing the
CDC directly," said Diane Chin, executive director of
Chinese for Affirmative Action. "I think the new CDC
guidelines provide us with greater support."
The CDC does recommend, however, that institu
tions should exclude ill persons from classes and practice
"stringent control measures," including the isolation and
quarantine of SARS patients and their exposed contacts.
The report also recommends education efforts to
combat SARS, such as providing students with infor
mation about hand hygiene.
University Health Services and UC-Berkeley
spokespersons were unavailable to comment on the
new CDC guidelines.
Dr. Peter Dietrich, director of University Health
Services, said in a San Francisco Chronicle article yes
terday that UC-Berkeley's modified policy is in line
with the CDC's new guidelines, which encourage
"rapid detection and isolation."
Dietrich said the concern is that UC-Berkeley does
not have adequate facilities to quarantine students,
according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The CDC's new guidelines come on the heels of
Berdahl's May 5 announcement that all students
from SARS-stricken Asian countries will be denied
enrollment in UC-Berkeley summer courses.
The ban would have turned away about 600 for
eign students from the English as a Second Language
program, costing the university up to $2 million.
After a week of backlash, Berdahl announced on
May 10 that the university rolled back restrictions, al
lowing about 80 students from SARS-affected coun
tries to attend summer classes.
But the university tightened restrictions on UC
students abroad. UC canceled its fall Education
Abroad Program in Beijing, university officials an
nounced Monday.
