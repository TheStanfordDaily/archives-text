# Apple founder talks in San Jose
## Computer gurus share success stories 
### MIKE CORPOS SPARTAN DAILY (SAN JOSE STATE U 
(U-WIRE) SAN JOSE, Calif. - Apple Com
puter co-founder Steve Wozniak and Greg
Galanos, founder of software and program
ming tool maker Metrowerks, spoke about
"the Birth of a Startup," Thursday in the
Student Union's Unumhum room.
The pair spoke at the semester's final
presentation by the San Jose State Univer
sity Entrepreneurial Society.
About 80 people attended the event
where Wozniak and Galanos, currently ex
ecutive director of Mobius Venture Capital,
shared their stories about starting their re
spective companies and what it took for
them to become successful.
Wozniak kicked off the event by sharing
the story of how he first got interested in de
signing computers and how that eventually
led him to pursue his love of engineering
and use it to join Steve Jobs in founding
Apple Computer.
"Apple is an extreme example of what
entrepreneurs should expect when first
starting out," he said. "People were saying
this market is not going to go anywhere."
Wozniak, known affectionately to many as
"Woz," said his path to entrepreneurship
began with a love of math, and with his fa
ther who taught him his early electronics
skills.
"I wanted to work on normal stuff for
normal people," Wozniak said of his early
ideas for designing computers and other
technological devices.
Wozniak said that early in his life he
wanted to be an engineer like his father,
and also a fifth grade teacher, "like those
who had helped me so much early in my
life."
.As he got through his first three years of
college at SJSU, the University of Colorado
and I)e Anza College in the late 19705, Woz
niak said he continued to design computers
always trying to outdo his previous design.
Wozniak said he and Jobs began build
ing smaller, more efficient computer
boards and selling them at a modest profit.
"I said to Steve (Jobs), 'What if we don't

make our money back?' and he responded,
'Maybe we won't make our money back, but
we'll have a company,' " Wozniak mused.
That was the beginning of Apple Computer.
Wozniak said that as the company grew,
he and Jobs sought out investors to help
them launch Apple on a larger scale.
"When you're that small, it is simple,
easy and a lot of fun," Wozniak said of the
early stages of building a company. "The
key is — are you willing to take a risk?"
After Wozniak's story was cut short be
cause of time constraints, Galanos, who
had been sitting quietly, said jokingly,
"this is what (venture capitalists) do. We
give money to entrepreneurs and shut
U P" . . I
Galanos' story began similarly to Wozni
ak's. The Australian-born would-be entre
preneur left home at age 17 and traveled
the world until he arrived in Montreal,
Canada.
At the University of Montreal, Galanos
said he started programming by stealing
computer time late at night in the universi
ty's lab.
In 1984, Galanos said he built the largest
Macintosh network in Canada. Shortly
after, in 1985, he wrote the first computer
code compiler program for the Macintosh
platform.
He built his first company, Metrowerks,
on the compilers and developer tools he
created for different computer platforms.
In the late 19905, his company was
bought by chip maker Motorola."After a
few months at Motorola I decided that was
enough, and I retired," Galanos said.
In 2000, Galanos joined Mobius Venture
Capital as a general partner, and he is now
the executive director of the company.
After the two speakers finished their sto
ries they took questions from the audience
and encouraged the students who were
present to keep trying.
"You always learn from your failures,"
Galanos said to one audience member who
asked how failures might affect an entre
preneurial business. Wozniak added to
Galanos' answer.
"Don't think all the solutions are in engi
neering — make sure you have a good
team," he said. "If we didn't have all the
right people (at Apple), we wouldn't have
gotten as far as we did."
