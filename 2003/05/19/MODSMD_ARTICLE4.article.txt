Ozomatli, a Los Angeles-based salsa and
hip-hop band, will perform in Frost Am
phitheater on June 1. Organizers from the
Stanford Concert Network, which is spon

expect nearly 2,000 Stanford students,
alumni and staff to attend the free show.

salsa with hip-hop and funk into a totally

at this price."
Senior Eric Blackerby, the concert net

lead to more big shows.

we have not done a show in Frost this year,"
Blackerby said. "Students complain how
come we don't get MTV tours and things

like that. We're getting closer and closer to
getting the University to letting us have
more shows like that."
Tsai added, "Not only do they combine sev

Concert network Assistant Director
Michael Kaufman, a senior, said, "The
best thing about [Ozomatli] is their live
shows. I've had the chance to see them a
couple times and it's an experience you
wont forget ... I don't think I know any-
