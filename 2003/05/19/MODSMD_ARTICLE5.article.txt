# Gators chomp through Card's title hopes
## Women finish second 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Gainesville has been the site of
immense success for the Stanford
women's tennis team in past
decades, including three NCAA
team titles.
But on Sunday the Cardinal
(25-2) suffered an emotional defeat
at the hands of feisty hometown
Florida (31-2), which dethroned
the two-time defending national
champions by snatching a 4-3 nail
biter from Stanford's hands at the
Ring Tennis Complex.
The win capped a magnificent
season for Florida, which won
both its 12th Southeast Confer
ence Championship and fourth
national title.

Although top-seeded Stanford
challenged No. 2 Florida and
nearly claimed its third straight
title, it could not overcome a loss of
the doubles point to begin the
match.
The Gator team of Lindsay
Dawaf and Julia Scaringe beat ju
nior Emilia Anderson and sopho
more Story Tweedie-Yates, 8-3,
while Jennifer Magley and Zerene
Reyes upset junior Lauren
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette, the No. 1 team in the na
tion, 8-5.
As is often the case, the doubles
point proved crucial as the teams
split the singles matches at three
apiece.

Junior Emilia Anderson lost her doubles match with teammate Story Tweed
ie-Yates against Florida. The Cardinal dropped the doubles point for just the
third time this season and couldn't come back to win the NCAA title.
After the doubles play, the teams were
able to maintain focus despite the 95-de
gree heat and the hour-and-a-half delay
due to lightning.
Shortly after the delay ended, the Car
dinal found itself in a two-point hole after
Tweedie-Yates was forced to retire at No.
6 singles, but Burdette dispatched Dawad,
6-1, 6-4 at No. 3 singles to inch Stanford
closer.

Anderson then fell to Alexis Gordon at
No. 5 singles, 6-5, 7-5, which placed Flori
da one match from victory at 3-1.
Stanford fought back, however, and
was able to even the match score at 3-3
after wins from its freshmen. Amber Liu
continued her recent success by crushing
Scaringe, 6-2,6-1 and the consistent fresh
man Alice Barnes finished an impressive
season with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Reyes.
Shortly thereafter, the Gators were able
to clinch the championship at No. 2 sin
gles, where Barnikow was unable to re

bound from a tough first set and fell to
Julie Rotundi, 6-0, 7-5.
Although the Gators featured a nearly
weakness-free lineup — the squad had six
singles players and two doubles teams
ranked in the top-100 nationally — Stan
ford was clearly evenly matched.
"It's not a matter of ranking at that
point," Stanford coach Lele Forood said.
"We played a lot of their players last year
so it's a matter of coming out and seeing
who the better players are."
The Cardinal's road to the final was cer
tainly not easy. After breezing past
Louisiana-Monroe, Michigan and Har
vard in the first three rounds, Stanford
found itself pitted against Georgia (19-5),
a premier team and the No. 7 seed in the
tournament.
Led by strong doubles play and a com
petitive fire, though, the Cardinal was able
to dispatch the Bulldogs, 4-0, while mov
ing into the semifinals without having
dropped a single point in the tournament.
Barnes, Burdette and Anderson also post
ed singles victories
"We played them twice last year, so they
are a very familiar opponent," said
Forood. "We have a good rivalry with the
Bulldogs, and we were ready to play them
and we just came out and played really
well."

In the semifinals on Saturday, Stanford
met another familiar opponent in confer
ence foe California (23-6). The Bears were
ranked No. 4 and had handed the Cardi
nal their only defeat of the season up until
that point at the Team Indoor Champi
onships on February 7.
The NCAA matchup was the fourth
time that the teams had competed, as
Stanford beat the Bears 6-1 on February
the Farm and 4-3 in Berkeley on April 22.
"It starts with familiarity of your oppo
nent, which works both ways in that situa
tion," Forood said. "It was key to get the
doubles point because it was one of those
tight ones, like the last time we were at Cal.
"So after we got the point we came out
fired up in the singles, and we got some
quick leads."
File leads were essential for the Cardi
nal as it battled both a strong Pacific-10
Conference opponent and temperatures
that reached 105 degrees.
After claiming the doubles point with
victories at No. 1 and 2 doubles, Burdette
and Barnes quickly overwhelmed their re
spective opponents to put the Cardinal up
3-0. Burdette shut out Catherine Lynch,
6-0, 6-0 at No. 3 singles, while Barnes beat
Jieun Jacobs, 6-0, 6-1 at No. 4. Anderson
sealed the match with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
Jody Scheldt at the No. 5 position.

A very impressive performance was
contributed by Liu, who was leading
Raquel Kops-Jones at No. 1 singles, 7-5,4-
3 when the match was won by the Cardi
nal. The match displayed the great im
provement of Liu throughout the season,
as the powerful Kops-Jones had beaten
her three times throughout the regular
season, including a 6-1, 6-2 defeat at Stan
ford on Feb. 22.

"That was a huge first set for her to win,
since Raquel has been playing great ten
nis," Forood said. "She [Liu] was down 2-
0 in the second and she was really able to
rally and get it to 4-3."
Liu will look to continue that success as
she and teammates Barnikow, Burdette
and Barnes compete in the NCAA Indi
vidual Singles Championships, which
begin tomorrow in Gainesville.

sealed the match with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
Jody Scheldt at the No. 5 position.

A very impressive performance was
contributed by Liu, who was leading
Raquel Kops-Jones at No. 1 singles, 7-5,4-
3 when the match was won by the Cardi
nal. The match displayed the great im
provement of Liu throughout the season,
as the powerful Kops-Jones had beaten
her three times throughout the regular
season, including a 6-1, 6-2 defeat at Stan
ford on Feb. 22.

"That was a huge first set for her to win,
since Raquel has been playing great ten
nis," Forood said. "She [Liu] was down 2-
0 in the second and she was really able to
rally and get it to 4-3."
Liu will look to continue that success as
she and teammates Barnikow, Burdette
and Barnes compete in the NCAA Indi
vidual Singles Championships, which
begin tomorrow in Gainesville.

Freshman Amber Liu hopes to continue her explosive rookie campaign at the NCAA Indi
vidual Singles Championships, beginning tomorrow. Liu has been performing well at the No.
1 singles spot for the Cardinal all season and hopes to bring a title back to the Farm.
Gainesville has been the site of
immense success for the Stanford
women's tennis team in past
decades, including three NCAA
team titles.
But on Sunday the Cardinal
(25-2) suffered an emotional defeat
at the hands of feisty hometown
Florida (31-2), which dethroned
the two-time defending national
champions by snatching a 4-3 nail
biter from Stanford's hands at the
Ring Tennis Complex.
The win capped a magnificent
season for Florida, which won
both its 12th Southeast Confer
ence Championship and fourth
national title.

Although top-seeded Stanford
challenged No. 2 Florida and
nearly claimed its third straight
title, it could not overcome a loss of
the doubles point to begin the
match.
The Gator team of Lindsay
Dawaf and Julia Scaringe beat ju
nior Emilia Anderson and sopho
more Story Tweedie-Yates, 8-3,
while Jennifer Magley and Zerene
Reyes upset junior Lauren
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette, the No. 1 team in the na
tion, 8-5.
As is often the case, the doubles
point proved crucial as the teams
split the singles matches at three
apiece.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Junior Emilia Anderson lost her doubles match with teammate Story Tweed
ie-Yates against Florida. The Cardinal dropped the doubles point for just the
third time this season and couldn't come back to win the NCAA title.
After the doubles play, the teams were
able to maintain focus despite the 95-de
gree heat and the hour-and-a-half delay
due to lightning.
Shortly after the delay ended, the Car
dinal found itself in a two-point hole after
Tweedie-Yates was forced to retire at No.
6 singles, but Burdette dispatched Dawad,
6-1, 6-4 at No. 3 singles to inch Stanford
closer.

Anderson then fell to Alexis Gordon at
No. 5 singles, 6-5, 7-5, which placed Flori
da one match from victory at 3-1.
Stanford fought back, however, and
was able to even the match score at 3-3
after wins from its freshmen. Amber Liu
continued her recent success by crushing
Scaringe, 6-2,6-1 and the consistent fresh
man Alice Barnes finished an impressive
season with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Reyes.
Shortly thereafter, the Gators were able
to clinch the championship at No. 2 sin
gles, where Barnikow was unable to re

bound from a tough first set and fell to
Julie Rotundi, 6-0, 7-5.
Although the Gators featured a nearly
weakness-free lineup — the squad had six
singles players and two doubles teams
ranked in the top-100 nationally — Stan
ford was clearly evenly matched.
"It's not a matter of ranking at that
point," Stanford coach Lele Forood said.
"We played a lot of their players last year
so it's a matter of coming out and seeing
who the better players are."
The Cardinal's road to the final was cer
tainly not easy. After breezing past
Louisiana-Monroe, Michigan and Har
vard in the first three rounds, Stanford
found itself pitted against Georgia (19-5),
a premier team and the No. 7 seed in the
tournament.
Led by strong doubles play and a com
petitive fire, though, the Cardinal was able
to dispatch the Bulldogs, 4-0, while mov
ing into the semifinals without having
dropped a single point in the tournament.
Barnes, Burdette and Anderson also post
ed singles victories
"We played them twice last year, so they
are a very familiar opponent," said
Forood. "We have a good rivalry with the
Bulldogs, and we were ready to play them
and we just came out and played really
well."

In the semifinals on Saturday, Stanford
met another familiar opponent in confer
ence foe California (23-6). The Bears were
ranked No. 4 and had handed the Cardi
nal their only defeat of the season up until
that point at the Team Indoor Champi
onships on February 7.
The NCAA matchup was the fourth
time that the teams had competed, as
Stanford beat the Bears 6-1 on February
the Farm and 4-3 in Berkeley on April 22.
"It starts with familiarity of your oppo
nent, which works both ways in that situa
tion," Forood said. "It was key to get the
doubles point because it was one of those
tight ones, like the last time we were at Cal.
"So after we got the point we came out
fired up in the singles, and we got some
quick leads."
File leads were essential for the Cardi
nal as it battled both a strong Pacific-10
Conference opponent and temperatures
that reached 105 degrees.
After claiming the doubles point with
victories at No. 1 and 2 doubles, Burdette
and Barnes quickly overwhelmed their re
spective opponents to put the Cardinal up
3-0. Burdette shut out Catherine Lynch,
6-0, 6-0 at No. 3 singles, while Barnes beat
Jieun Jacobs, 6-0, 6-1 at No. 4. Anderson
sealed the match with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of
Jody Scheldt at the No. 5 position.
