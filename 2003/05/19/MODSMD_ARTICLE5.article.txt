# Gators chomp through Card's title hopes
## Women finish second 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Gainesville has been the site of
immense success for the Stanford
women's tennis team in past
decades, including three NCAA
team titles.
But on Sunday the Cardinal
(25-2) suffered an emotional defeat
at the hands of feisty hometown
Florida (31-2), which dethroned
the two-time defending national
champions by snatching a 4-3 nail
biter from Stanford's hands at the
Ring Tennis Complex.
The win capped a magnificent
season for Florida, which won
both its 12th Southeast Confer
ence Championship and fourth
national title.

Although top-seeded Stanford
challenged No. 2 Florida and
nearly claimed its third straight
title, it could not overcome a loss of
the doubles point to begin the
match.
The Gator team of Lindsay
Dawaf and Julia Scaringe beat ju
nior Emilia Anderson and sopho
more Story Tweedie-Yates, 8-3,
while Jennifer Magley and Zerene
Reyes upset junior Lauren
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette, the No. 1 team in the na
tion, 8-5.
As is often the case, the doubles
point proved crucial as the teams
split the singles matches at three
apiece.
