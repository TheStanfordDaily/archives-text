### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Blackfest 2003 attracted students
and community members to Wilbur
Field yesterday afternoon with music,
soul food, performances and sun
shine. Renaming the annual Black
Family Gathering, members of the
Black Community Services Center,
which coordinated the event, offered
spectators a look into the diversity of
black culture.
Blackfest catered to families by otter
ing games, a jump house and ponies as
young children playing basketball and
football-shooting games took over the

field. The stage acts, including a Greek
step show and music performances, ac
commodated older Blackfest partici
pants.
"We were blessed in having many
performances and being able to bring so
many groups of people together," said
junior Donielle Newell, coordinator for
community service and special projects
at the center. "The name'Blackfest' lias a
more community, all-encompassing feel
that represents the diversity of the events
ottered here."
Vendors selling jewelry, clothing
and accessories were also a big attrac
tion at Blackfest. Many of the items
were paintings and carpets designed
with an ethnic theme. Vendors sold

African garments and hand-crafted
jewelry. Homemade soul food was also
a big attraction, as participants lined up
for catfish and pie. A three-on-three
basketball tournament and a DJ booth
run by 106 KMEL provided hip-hop
music and entertainment to the festival
participants.
"I'm very optimistic about the event;
it's sunny and [there's] a good turnout,"
said senior Jessica Benford, while par
taking in the day's festivities. "It's also a
nice balance between on- and off-cam
pus participation."
The four-hour event worked in con
junction with the Stanford Concert
Network to bring in acts from Stanford,
such as the dance group dVB and hip

hop musicians ONE, as well as acts
from outside of Stanford, such as
Goapele, a rising Bay Area star.
Though there were originally chairs set
up, the crowd grew so large that the en
tire audience was standing around the
stage, listening to and cheering during
the performances.
"It was really awesome that Black
fest got so many amazing perfor
mances," said freshman Ratul Narain.
"Goapele sang 'Closer to My Dreams'
and other hit songs that completely
pumped up the audience. It was a nice
addition to the many other aspects of
this community dav."
The participants of Blackfest
were an eclectic mix of Stanford stu
dents and families with younger
children. The kids played with
hula-hoops and games while par
ents and students browsed the

vending areas and watched perfor
mances.
"It's,my first time, and I real
ly like it [Blackfest]," said
Jerome Carrier, a Mountain
View resident, while walking by
the vendors with his wife and
child. "I really like the commu
nity aspects, the vendors and
the overall positive happy envi
ronment."
