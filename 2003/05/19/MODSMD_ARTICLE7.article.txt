# Walkin' on chalk
## Students beautify WHITE PLAZA 
### PRITI SANGHANI 
A relic of 16th-century Italian culture came to
campus Friday with the second annual Stanford
Chalk Festival, held in White Plaza. Five groups of
students who signed up each received a square in
which they had the opportunity to transform bare
concrete into a unique work of art.
The art of street painting, with chalk as the
medium, originated in Italy where street painters,
or madonnari, would spend days or even weeks
creating a temporary but stunning patchwork of
different drawings in the village square. The idea
of bringing together the talents of both accom
plished and aspiring artists quickly spread world
wide.
This year's coordinator at Stanford, senior Alicia
Grattan, was inspired by the huge yearly "I Madon
nari" festival in her hometown of Santa Barbara.
