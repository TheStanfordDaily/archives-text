# Walkin' on chalk
## Students beautify WHITE PLAZA 
### PRITI SANGHANI 
A relic of 16th-century Italian culture came to
campus Friday with the second annual Stanford
Chalk Festival, held in White Plaza. Five groups of
students who signed up each received a square in
which they had the opportunity to transform bare
concrete into a unique work of art.
The art of street painting, with chalk as the
medium, originated in Italy where street painters,
or madonnari, would spend days or even weeks
creating a temporary but stunning patchwork of
different drawings in the village square. The idea
of bringing together the talents of both accom
plished and aspiring artists quickly spread world
wide.
This year's coordinator at Stanford, senior Alicia
Grattan, was inspired by the huge yearly "I Madon
nari" festival in her hometown of Santa Barbara.

event to bring to Stanford," she
said.
Friday's chalk festival attract
ed a diverse group of students
with varying artistic experience.
Together, seniors Tiffany Hum
bert-Rico and Mark Gebhard il
lustrated artist Toulouse
Lautrec's "Moulin Rouge," which
depicts the cabaret entertain
ment of late 19th-century
Parisian night life.
"Since it was our first time
chalking a square, we didn't want
to do something really complex
like Matisse or Picasso," Hum
bert-Rico said. "We picked
'Moulin Rouge' because it had a
lot of bright colors and it looked
like it would be fun to draw. Be
cause Lautrec made many differ
ent versions of the same painting,
we had a lot of artistic freedom
with color."
Another square was created by
an ambitious team of students
from Kimball who chose a work
by abstract artist Kandinsky
called "Gelb Rot Blau," which
means "Yellow Red Blue" in Ger
man. This group was led by chalk

artist veteran Jen McDonald, a
junior, who not only participated
in the Stanford Chalk Festival last
year but also has been creating
chalk drawings ever since she was
in the eighth grade.
"Chalking is so different from
any other art because it is a tem
porary form," McDonald said. "I
especially enjoy the huge draw
ings â€” they really make the peo
ple in them come to life."
As an experienced chalk artist,
McDonald is very familiar with
the dedication it takes to create a
masterpiece.
"One year, I got really enthu
siastic about a chalk drawing and
worked on it for an entire week,'
McDonald said.
In only its second year of exis
tence, the Stanford Chalk Festi
val has already inspired several
impressive pieces. In last year's
event, one of the entries was Bot
ticelli's extremely graceful and
intricate "Birth of Venus."
Although Grattan is graduat
ing, she hopes that the annual
tradition of the Stanford Chalk
Festival will be carried on next
year.
"Chalk art is great for anyone
who loves to make and share
their art with other people," she
said.
