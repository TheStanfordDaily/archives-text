# Univ. excepts only sex crimes
## Policies protect accused students 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
When Stanford Police Deputy Eric Fenton
knocked on the door of junior Justin Davis and sopho
more Josh Childress' Mirrielees apartment last month
and asked for the whereabouts of their former room
mate, Davis said he had never heard that name before
and shut the door.
The next day, when the police returned, Davis and
Childress said they grew suspicious. Their ex-room
mate, whom the residents knew as "Ronnie," had a dif
ferent real name â€” and a criminal record.
Neither of them had been informed of the former
roommate's real name when he moved into Mirrielees
in the middle of fall quarter, and neither of them knew
about his criminal record until the police came looking
for him, due to the protection of privacy given to stu
dents by the University's Fundamental Standard.
According to the Fundamental Standard, the rights
of an accused Stanford community member include
complete confidentiality, except in the case of a sexual as
sault. This strict confidentiality also means that Stanford
residents can often remain unaware of people living in
the same community who have criminal records that are
serious, but do not include sexual offense crimes.
According to the 2002 amended version of the Stu
dent judicial Charter of 1997, accused lawbreakers at
Stanford have the right "to be assured that their iden
tity and the circumstances of allegations against them
will be kept confidential, except in specific circum
stances identified in the by-laws of the Board on Judi
cial Affairs."
Dividing crimes between sexual assault and non-sex
ual assault, the Disciplinary and Other Administrative
Actions for Students section of the Stanford University
Administrative Guide states that the University "will
maintain the confidentiality of students involved in dis
ciplinary cases; in situations involving the allegation of
sexual assault, however, the reporting individual and
the accused student may choose to be- accompanied by
a person of his or her choice at all stages of the discipli
nary process."
Because the University docs not publicize the crimes
of accused people, this means that students possibly
won't even lie informed of their roommate's criminal
