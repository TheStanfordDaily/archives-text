# Univ. excepts only sex crimes
## Policies protect accused students 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
When Stanford Police Deputy Eric Fenton
knocked on the door of junior Justin Davis and sopho
more Josh Childress' Mirrielees apartment last month
and asked for the whereabouts of their former room
mate, Davis said he had never heard that name before
and shut the door.
The next day, when the police returned, Davis and
Childress said they grew suspicious. Their ex-room
mate, whom the residents knew as "Ronnie," had a dif
ferent real name — and a criminal record.
Neither of them had been informed of the former
roommate's real name when he moved into Mirrielees
in the middle of fall quarter, and neither of them knew
about his criminal record until the police came looking
for him, due to the protection of privacy given to stu
dents by the University's Fundamental Standard.
According to the Fundamental Standard, the rights
of an accused Stanford community member include
complete confidentiality, except in the case of a sexual as
sault. This strict confidentiality also means that Stanford
residents can often remain unaware of people living in
the same community who have criminal records that are
serious, but do not include sexual offense crimes.
According to the 2002 amended version of the Stu
dent judicial Charter of 1997, accused lawbreakers at
Stanford have the right "to be assured that their iden
tity and the circumstances of allegations against them
will be kept confidential, except in specific circum
stances identified in the by-laws of the Board on Judi
cial Affairs."
Dividing crimes between sexual assault and non-sex
ual assault, the Disciplinary and Other Administrative
Actions for Students section of the Stanford University
Administrative Guide states that the University "will
maintain the confidentiality of students involved in dis
ciplinary cases; in situations involving the allegation of
sexual assault, however, the reporting individual and
the accused student may choose to be- accompanied by
a person of his or her choice at all stages of the discipli
nary process."
Because the University docs not publicize the crimes
of accused people, this means that students possibly
won't even lie informed of their roommate's criminal
record, as was the case with Davis
and Childress and their former
roommate.
"I feel kind of weird not knowing
much about [our former room
mate]," Childress said, describing
how he felt when he did not receive
any notices from Housing about his
record. "I was actually scared when
I found out his past, because I
thought that he could have done
something to us.
"I feel that I should have
known," Childress added. "If some
one is going to be living with me for
two quarters, I should be able to
know what kind of a person he is."
Referring to privacy issues and
confidentiality, Director of Housing
Assignment Services Todd Benson
said that "we do not interrogate stu
dents about their possible criminal
past nor require them to reveal that
information to us or to their fellow

students or residential communi
ties.
"If the University is made aware
of any student presenting a possi
ble safety risk to a residential com
munity, or the campus at large,
whether based on a criminal con
viction or a problematic situational
behavior while at Stanford, it
would take appropriate steps, as
necessary, based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular sit
uation; one such step could in
clude notifying roommates," Ben
son added.
Benson offered no explanation
of how the University could be
made aware, especially since Hous
ing does not interrogate students,
and also because the University's
Fundamental Standard calls for
"complete confidentiality" of the ac
cused person, except in sexual of
fense cases.
Davis said he felt that, while he
would have liked more information
about his former roommate, he un
derstood the University's need to
protect his privacy.

"He moved out right before
spring break," Davis added. "He
said he was going home. The police
came by April 22 and the 23. They
asked if we had seen [our former
roommate] and if we knew of his
whereabouts."
According to Davis, he and his
roommates knew so little about their
former roommate, who they say
called himself "Ronnie" — which
they later learned was not his real
name — that when the police ques
tioned them about him by using his
actual name, they said they did not
know him.
Fenton confirmed that "[the for
mer roommate] did commit a
crime," but added that "officers
can't disclose anything." Fenton
added that he still lias not been able
to contact the student.
The arrest record of the student
could not be found at the Stanford
Police Station. It is likely that he
committed the crime off campus,
since all on-campus crimes must be
on record at the station.
According to Vice President and

General Counsel Debra Zumwalt,
students can protect themselves if
they suspect that their roommate is
a lawbreaker.
"If [students] believe their room
tnate has a criminal conviction,
again, that would depend on the sit
uation, but they would probably
want to start by talking to the resi
dence fellow or residence dean,"
Zumwalt said. "You might want to
ask the police or student services
what their advice would be."
Zumwalt also remarked on Sum
lord's policy with regard to appli
cants who have criminal records.
"Stanford does ask questions on
the application whether they have
been convicted of any crime and, if
so, for an explanation," she said.
"It is my understanding that it is
rare that a student with a criminal
conviction would be admitted to
Stanford and, in that event, the
University would look at the indi
vidual circumstances and decide
what, if anything, to do on a case
by-case basis to assure the safety of
all of our students."
