### JULIE PATEL 
San Francisco Chronicle Vice
President and Executive Editor Phil
Bronstein lashed out journalists at a
dinner meeting of the Special Li
braries Association on Friday at the
California Culinary Academy in San
Francisco.
He addressed recent debates in
the press about the press — includ
ing the Jayson Blair scandal, sensa
tionalism in covering the war in Iraq
and the resurgence of "interpretive
journalism."
Before guests could hear Bron
stein speak, they had to make their
way through a crowd of about sev
eral dozen demonstrators blocking
the entrance of the academy in
protest of the firing of personal
technology columnist Henry Non
after he took a sick day to attend an
anti-war rally. The protesters
walked in and out of a construction
walkway with Norr himself.
Meanwhile, Bronstein mingled
with corporate librarians over din
ner in the basement of the acade
my. He laughingly dismissed the
protesters by saying, "They're
demonstrating the firing of Henry
Norr, the Spanish-American War
and the fact that we wrap our pa
pers in plastic."
After Norr was fired, manage
ment at the Chronicle circulated
memos emphasizing the impor
tance of the "appearance of objec
tivity" in maintaining a newspaper's
credibility.
Bronstein used his speaking en
gagement, in part, to uphold the
value of reporters not merely creat
ing an illusion of neutrality but of ac
tually practicing it in their work.
Bronstein called for journalists to
stick to their traditional — and
some say outmoded — role of

being objective and simply "telling
what happened."
He criticized the punditry and
interpretive role journalists are
now playing, calling it "narcissism"
and the "all-about-me factor in
journalism."
He said t<x> many reporters cov
ering the war were inserting them
selves in stories, saying things like,
"Here I am in the desert..."
Bronstein said the lack of gen
uine inquiry involved reminded
him of being a correspondent in El
Salvador in the early 19905. One
day, he had just witnessed the ex
humation of the mutilated bodies of
four activists.
I le "got back to the house with
the wretched smell of death still on
me," flipped on the television and
saw Robert Novak claiming the
death Salvadoran squads were just
"liberal myths."
"I had just seen these dead
guys," Bronstein said. "Here was
this guy with power and presence
talking about something he would
have discovered was wrong had he
done the 'slightest bit of inquiry.'
"There ought to be some kind of
journalism jail for people like
Novak," he said.
The war in Iraq could have used
more inquiry, Bronstein said, con
ceding that there were moments of
the war that were well done. He re
called an exchange between Wolf
Blitzer and Christiane Amanpour
on CNN:
"So what's going on in Basra?"
Blitzer asked.
'"I don't know. We can only tell
you what we see," she said.
Bronstein called this a "stunning
moment of honesty" and said the
exchange had none of the hyper
bole or speculation he has gotten
used to seeing on TV news.
He said it's true that mere facts
don't get at the truth of an issue, but
that's not a journalists role. They
don't have the resources, time or in
frastructure to reflect seriously
about issues of public concern in the
way academics might.
"Journalists probably don't
know what really happened in
Iraq," he said. "VVe should leave it to
history, fiction, poetry to get at the
truth of things and just report what
we know."
He said thejayson Blair incident
demonstrated the "hubris of The
New York limes" and said thev

"present themselves as more than
they can be."
"When they have bad practition
ers, they need to tell them to follow
another career path," he said.
I le said he's not worried about
audience demand for sensational
journalism and said people are
going through a "Roman am
phitheater phase" and that the
"pendulum will swing back" soon
enough.
Bronstein disagreed with the
fuss journalists created when NBC
was considering dropping "the seri
ous face of Nightline" for the better
rated David Letterman show.
Bronstein recalled a friend say
ing, "I'll believe there's a big differ
ence between Nightline and Letter
man if someone on the show says,
That's an intellectual question. Let
me get back to you.' "
