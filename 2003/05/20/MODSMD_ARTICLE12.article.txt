## Saudi leader warns of more attacks 
### 
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saucli Ara
bia's U.S. ambassador warned Monday that in
telligence suggests there could be more terror
attacks in Saudi Arabia or the United States,
while an American official said al-Qaida has a
presence in the royal kingdom.
Prince Bandar bin Sultan also said the king
dom received warning before the May 12
bombings that killed 34 people, including eight
Americans, at three housing compounds out
side of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
"Yes, we had warning, yes we had height
ened alert but we never had a specific time and
place designated," Prince Bandar told re
porters in Riyadh.
Other attacks were possible, he said, based
on new intelligence.
"There is chatter, a high level of chatter re
gionally and in other international spots" about
possible attacks in Saudi Arabia or the United
States, Prince Bandar said.
The FBI warned Monday that al-Qaida could
mount new attacks in the United States as well as
target American and Western interests overseas.
Other U.S. officials said Monday that Saudi
and U.S. investigators are fully cooperating in
the probe into the Riyadh attacks, though an
FBI team is not interrogating suspects.
Meanwhile, a man standing with a gun out
side the U.S. Consulate in Dhahran, 300 miles
east of Riyadh, was arrested Monday and was
being questioned by Saudi police, a U.S. Em
bassy official said.
U.S. diplomats said no one was injured or
threatened in the incident, but that the con
sulate was closed until further notice. In 1996,
a truck bombing killed 19 Americans at the

Khobar Towers barracks near Dhahran.
A U.S. official said Monday that al-Qaida has
some presence in the royal kingdom.
"We don't believe there are tens of thou
sands of al-Qaida members in Saudi Arabia but
we believe the al-Qaida presence is more than a
single cell or two," the official in Riyadh said on
condition of anonymity.
On Sunday, Saudi Interior Minister Prince
Nayef said authorities have arrested four suspects
apparently linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network over the car bombings. Asked whether
the four men in custody belonged to al-Qaida,

Nayef said, ".All indications point to that."
Nayefs comments were the strongest sign
yet that bin Laden's terrorists — who have car
ried out deadly strikes from Nairobi, Kenya, to
New York — may have played a part in the
bombings in the Saudi capital.
But Prince Bandar, who is known for han
dling some of his country's most delicate diplo
matic tasks, told reporters after returning to
Saudi Arabia from Washington that Saudi au
thorities had obtained information during re
cent months that al-Qaida had been wracked by
internal divisions.
