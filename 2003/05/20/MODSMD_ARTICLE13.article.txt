# Phillipine president pledges partnership

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush toasted Philippine Pres
ident Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's
"unwavering" partnership in the
war on terrorism yesterday, and
rewarded her with a promise of a
reciprocal visit.
White House officials said Bush
was likely to add the Philippines to
an Asia trip he has planned for this
fall.
The toasts culminated an offi
cial state visit by Arroyo — an
honor Bush has been stingy in dol
ing out during his 28-month pres
idency. She was just the third for
eign leader to be honored in such
a fashion.
Bush reminded 130 dinner
guests that Arroyo was among the
first to call him after Sept. 11,
2001. And, Bush said, "You have
not wavered."
"For your leadership and
friendship, I thank you," Bush
said. He promised a visit "later this
year, with you as my host."
Bush nodded as Arroyo said:
"In a time of crisis, friends do not
ask why, they ask how."
Arroyo, considerably shorter
than Bush, stood on a box at his
lectern in the State Dining Room
to return the toast. "We've stood
side by side at every crucial point
in modern history," she said.
Bush held a morning news con
ference and an Oval Office meet
ing with Arroyo, At dusk, she and
her husband, lawyer Jose Miguel
T. Arroyo, glided up to the north

entrance of the White House in a
limousine, where Bush and first
lady Bush formally greeted
them.
The two couples posed for pho
tos, then walked slowly into the
East Room as the President's Own
U.S. Marine Band played "Hail to
the Chief." President Arroyo wore
a purple dress with a lime-green
sash, Laura Bush a shimmering
golden gown. The men were clad
in tuxedos, with Bush sporting a
vest.
Opera singer Susan Graham
warmed up in the East Room as
the White House put the finishing
touches on the State Dining Room.
Graham later capped the night
with selections from Mozart,
Gershwin and Copeland.
Bouquets of pink and white pe
onies graced each table and
flanked a portrait of Abraham Lin
coln. Beneath Lincoln were the
two head tables — one Laura
Bush and Jose Miguel T. Arroyo,
one for the presidents. Each set
ting had four glasses: two for wine,
two for water. President Bush's set
had just one glass. He led the toast
with water in his glass.
Assistant White House chef Cris
Comerford, born in the Philip
pines and now a U.S. citizen, said
she sought common ground be
tween the two nations as she pre
pared the menu. "It was like a
marriage of the two countries,"
she told reporters before the din
ner.
