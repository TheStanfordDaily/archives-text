## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Pitfalls of reality TV 
### 
Millions of people tuned into
"The Bachelor" on Sunday
night to see who would leave
empty-handed and broken
hearted and who would receive the final
rose and an engagement ring. The buzz
yesterday morning was that Andrew had
chosen Jen, not Kirsten, and whether the
two would really get married. ("The
Bachelor: After the Final Rose" airs to
morrow night on ABC.) "The Bachelor"
is only one of the many reality television
shows that dominate the major television
networks. Tomorrow night, the second
American idol will be crowned, and this
fall, 16 Americans

will, once again, see
if they can outwit,
outplay and outlast
one another for 1
million dollars in the
next "Survivor."
If the 1960s is re
membered for its
family sitcoms, the
first decade of the
new millennium will

be defined by its reality television shows.
There have been many explanations for
the interest in participating in and watch
ing these shows. The most popular, per
haps, is that it gives Average Andrew or
Anne an opportunity to fulfill a life-long
dream — whether it is to be a spouse, a
performer or a millionaire. And for those
who watch these shows week after week, it
isn't far-fetched to think, "Hey, I could do
that."
While the Stanford community is
often unaffected by what goes on in the
rest of country, reality television fever has
hit the Farm. Gathered in dorm lounges
on Sunday night to watch "The Bache
lor," Stanford students made predictions
and placed bets on who would be the last
one standing. Earlier in the weekend, a
number of Stanford students attended
MTV's open casting call for "Made," a
show that promises to "give [partici

students wanted to be figure skaters, Los
Angeles Lakers girls and World
Wrestling Federation wrestlers.
Although working to realize one's
goals is a commendable act, we question if
doing so through reality television shows
is the appropriate way to do so. Our main
concern about reality television shows
that promise one thing after another —
even the opportunity to create a whole
new self on "Extreme Makeover" —is
that these shows transform real-life im
portant events into spectacles for enter
tainment. Finding someone to marry, for

example, should be a
personal, intimate
process — not one
that is controlled by
television viewers, as
is the case in the show
"Married by Ameri
ca."
We recognize that
only a small percent
age of Americans ac

tually participate in
these reality television shows. But week
after week, tens of millions of people tune
in to watch the dozens of reality televisions
shows that are on air — and we question
what our culture's fascination with these
shows means. Are people too busy to pur
sue separate goals and dreams, and the
only way that they will do so is if given the
chance by a television show?
Another concern is that while these
shows are called "reality television
shows," they are far from what they claim
to be. Yes, the people "starring" in the
shows are normal people and there are
no scripts. But there is a lot of behind-the
scenes editing that creates the kind of "re
ality" that is most interesting for viewers
and, consequently, will boost ratings for
the show.
Whether the popularity of reality tele
vision shows may or may not be a fad, we
hope that viewers are mindful of the not
so-glamorous side of reality television.
