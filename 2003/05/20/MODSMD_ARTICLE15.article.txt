Masse/s history at Stanford shows
he is qualified for new position as
dean, multicultural educator
In 1970, Thom Massey, who has
just been appointed the new associ
ate dean of students and multicultur
al educator, asked my wife and me to

be the resident fellows at the first
freshman dorm to have a concentra
tion of any minority group; in this
case African Americans. Thom and
Grace Carrol (doctoral degree, Class
of 1975) were the resident assistants.
Doug McHenry, now a movie pro
ducer ("New Jack City," "Jason's
Lyric"), Bill Durham (Stanford pro
fessor of anthropology), and Henry

Sayers (professor of art history at
Oregon State) were among the spon
sors. Out of this dorm came Drs.
Woody Meyers and Joy Simmons
(Stanford trustees) and other nota
bles. Thom is definitely an excellent
choice for this position.
