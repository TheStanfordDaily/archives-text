# LYING IN THE GRASS
## History 101: EPA and Palo Alto 
### 
Like the unfortunately
named state "West Vir
ginia," the city of East
Palo Alto lacks identity,
except in relation to a more
prominent locale. The greenery
on the Palo Alto side demarcates
the border with the concrete
sprawl of EPA, and the roads are
riddled with potholes once your
car passes the dividing line. Stan
ford and Palo Alto are the shining
orbs of Silicon Valley, brimming
with wealth and prosperity. Yet
EPA, a city only two miles oil cam
pus, is often viewed as the black
sheep of the Peninsula — even
though Palo Alto and, by exten
sion, Stanford, have had a long
history of evolving together, al
beit in opposite directions.
The intertwining of EPA and
its namesake go back to the turn
of the 20th century. The Prohibi
tion-era bans currently pervad
ing campus, for example, are
only manifestations of similar re
strictions a century ago, when a
conservative Jane Stanford, not
wanting any brouhahas at her
beloved university, actually
banned all alcohol within Palo
Alto city limits. So our hooligan
predecessors went to a place
called Whiskey Gulch — now
EPA —to carry on their de
bauchery, setting the tone for the
perceived bad vibes that have
been emanating from EPA's
streets ever since.
Back when Charlie Chaplain
was still king of the golden
screen, EPA was a quintessential
American suburb: San Francis
cans would come down to their
weekend cottages to garden.
After World War 11, however, a
large number of blacks moved
into the Bay Area, lured by its
growing industrial might. Due to
the minority influx, white people
fled, and seemingly overnight,
the demographics of the commu
nity drastically changed. The
1980s witnessed another shift in
the population, when a large
number of Hispanics, many from
a rural Mexican town called
Aguililla, moved into the town.
EPA was incorporated as a city
in 1983. Before then, it was in ge
ographical limbo, a no-man's lo
cale whose most pristine land was
annexed by Menlo Park and Palo
Alto. So it's been a media darling
all these years, becoming the
focal point whenever newspapers
wanted to run a übiquitous story

on destitution amidst wealth.
Analysis of the situation often
reeks of academic mumbo-jumbo
("socioeconomic disparity"
comes to mind), leaving what re
ally matters, the citizenry of EPA,
in the dust.
Nowadays, EPA residents go
grocery shopping in Palo Alto be
cause the city lacks its own super
market, and the city only recent-

ly acquired a
bank of its own.
Moreover, a
number of EPA
residents work in
Palo Alto behind
the-scenes, wash
ing dishes, scrub
bing toilets and
mowing lawns.

Of course, not all Palo Alto peo
ple are rich and, conversely, not
all EPA people are poor. But
given a choice, a homeless guy
would choose Palo Alto: Its ar-

East Palo Alto has
come a long way since
1992 when it was
dubbed the murder
capital of the world.
This progress, however;
now comes with a
new set of circumstances
that must
be addressed.

mada of police officers makes it a
far safer place to spend a wind
chilled night.
Fortunately, the Stanford
community is doing its part to
help out EPA residents. EPA has
been a major drug portal — not
the pharmaceutical kind, mind
you — for illegal substance afi
cionados for decades. It's also a
romping ground for students,
playing host to numerous cam
pus groups, including East Palo
Alto Tennis and Tutoring
(EPATT for the acronym in
clined) and Ravenswood Reads.
These clubs are integral for re

ducing the city's 50 percent high
school drop out rate. And law
school students, through the EPA
Community Law Project, dis
pense pro bono advice to nearby
residents. But don't let this be a
case study of socially aware young
people helping out the poor mi
norities. There's a difference,
however fine, between pity and
sympathy.
Right now, EPA is undergoing
massive reconstruction, tearing
down low-income housing in
favor of spanking new shopping
centers. Home Depot has already
been around, with IKEA and
Four Seasons just around the cor
ner. Obviously EPA residents
won't be shopping for overpriced
furniture or staying at swanky
hotels. Instead, they'd prefer
something far more basic: a su
permarket. So when IKEA's con
struction was being considered,
the residents mobilized and con
tested its erection, forcing IKEA
to launch a $ 147,000 campaign to
sway the hearts of EPA residents
young and old. Their publicity
campaign was successful. Al
though residents obtained some
minor concessions, IKEA's con
struction began without much
fuss, leaving some residents with
the unenviable choice of getting
bulldozed or moving elsewhere.
Now that the crime has been
cleaned up a bit, affluent people
are slowly trickling back into
EPA, jacking up house prices in
the process. As a result, the
poorer people in EPA, whom
these revitalizing projects are
supposed to help, are being
forced to relocate, perhaps aid
ing in the creation of another
EPA-like situation somewhere
else in California.
Maybe this process — in with
the new, out with the old — is in
evitable. Regardless of what the
talking suits say about job cre
ation and community improve
ment, companies like IKEA, with
dollar signs in their eyes, will win
out over people lacking a cogent
political voice. EPA has come a
long way since 1992, when it was
flubbed the murder capital of the
country. This progress, however,
now comes with a new set of cir
cumstances that must be ad
dressed.
