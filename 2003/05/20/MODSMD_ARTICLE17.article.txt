"If we were going to lose, I
wanted it to be to the best team,"
associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "But at least we
got a crack at them.
"They're undefeated and
they're the No. 1 seed" he contin
ued. "They've never been this far
in the tournament before and
had such a strong chance to win it
all, so they've got a ton of fans
here who are all smelling blood.
They're all here to crown them
national champions."
Illinois will have its chance to
do just that when it meets sur
prise finalist Vanderbilt today for
the title. No. 7 seed Vanderbilt
edged No. 6 seed UCLA 4-3 in
Monday's other semifinal.
The match got off to a promis
ing start for the Cardinal as it
won the doubles point. It was
only the third time all year that
the Fighting Illini lost the dou
bles point, but like the previous
two times, they came back to win.
"The doubles point was im
portant to us," Whitlinger said.
"We knew that if were going to

have a chance against such a good
team, we would have to win that
first point."
In a matchup of two of the top
doubles duos in the nation, No. 4
senior All-Americans David Mar
tin and Scott Lipsky were beaten
8-5 by No. 11 Amer Delic and
Michael Calkins.
But the Cardinal fought back,
winning both of the remaining
doubles matches. Freshmen KC
Corkery and James Pade upset
No. 9 Brian Wilson and Rajeev
Ram 9-8 on court two.
Sophomore Sam Warburg
and junior Carter Morris
clinched the doubles point with a
9-7 win on court three over Phil
Stolt and Chris Martin (Cardinal
senior David's younger brother).
In singles, Illinois' formidable
lineup proved to be too much for
the Cardinal. The Fighting Illi
ni's top four players are all
ranked among the top 22 players
in the nation.
Illinois came out firing, win
ning the first set in five of the six
singles matches. It quickly
wrapped up victories on courts
one and two to go up 2-1.
"We felt pretty confident after
winning the doubles, but they
came out and jumped on us in
the singles," Whitlinger said.
"Illinois didn't lie down, that's for
sure."
No. 8 Martin lost 6-2, 6-4 to
No. 3 Delic on court one while
Lipsky lost 6-2, 6-2 to No. 12 Wil
son on court two. Warburg tied
the match at 2-2 when he posted
an impressive 6-2, 6-2 victory
over No. 20 Stolt on court four.
With the dual match knotted
at 2-2, rain delayed the match for
more than an hour before play

was moved indoors. The situa
tion seemed dire for the Cardinal
as it trailed by a set in all the re
maining matches. Stanford was
not yet ready to concede victory
as it battled back to win the sec
ond set in all three matches.
On court three, Corkery, who
was riding a 22-match win streak,
lost the first set 7-5 to No. 22 Ram
but rallied to win the second by
the same score. On courts five and
six, Pade and Morris both lost the
first sets of their matches 6-4 be
fore recovering to win their sec
ond sets 6-3 and 6-4, respectively.
The comeback was not meant
to be.

"We battled back and put our
selves in a position to have a shot
at it and it just didn't happen."
Pade was the first to go down,
losing the third set 6-3 to put
Illinois up 3-2. The clincher came
on court six as Morris fell 6-3 in
the deciding set to Chris Martin.
Corkery and Ram were tied at
2-2 in the third when their match
was halted. Despite the disap
pointing end to its season, the
Cardinal was gracious in defeat.
"I've got a lot of respect for
[Illinois coach] Craig Tiley,"
Whitlinger said. "He's put to

would have thought Illinois of all
places fora top tennis school? It's
amazing what they've been able
to do."
Whitlinger chose to focus on the

positive side of the loss. "I'm very

said. "I think a lot of people count

the team in February, but we've

On court three, Corkery, who
was riding a 22-match win streak,

Pade was the first to go down,

on court six as Morris fell 6-3 in

Corkery and Ram were tied at

The No. 4 Stanford (25-4)
men's tennis team's run in the
NCAA Tournament ended Mon
day when the Cardinal lost in the
semifinals 4-2 to top-ranked and
undefeated Illinois (31-0) in
Athens, Ga.
The Cardinal can take conso
lation in the fact that it came clos
er to beating the Fighting Illini
than any other team this season.

"If we were going to lose, I
wanted it to be to the best team,"
associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "But at least we
got a crack at them.
"They're undefeated and
they're the No. 1 seed" he contin
ued. "They've never been this far
in the tournament before and
had such a strong chance to win it
all, so they've got a ton of fans
here who are all smelling blood.
They're all here to crown them
national champions."
Illinois will have its chance to
do just that when it meets sur
prise finalist Vanderbilt today for
the title. No. 7 seed Vanderbilt
edged No. 6 seed UCLA 4-3 in
Monday's other semifinal.
The match got off to a promis
ing start for the Cardinal as it
won the doubles point. It was
only the third time all year that
the Fighting Illini lost the dou
bles point, but like the previous
two times, they came back to win.
"The doubles point was im
portant to us," Whitlinger said.
"We knew that if were going to

have a chance against such a good
team, we would have to win that
first point."
In a matchup of two of the top
doubles duos in the nation, No. 4
senior All-Americans David Mar
tin and Scott Lipsky were beaten
8-5 by No. 11 Amer Delic and
Michael Calkins.
But the Cardinal fought back,
winning both of the remaining
doubles matches. Freshmen KC
Corkery and James Pade upset
No. 9 Brian Wilson and Rajeev
Ram 9-8 on court two.
Sophomore Sam Warburg
and junior Carter Morris
clinched the doubles point with a
9-7 win on court three over Phil
Stolt and Chris Martin (Cardinal
senior David's younger brother).
In singles, Illinois' formidable
lineup proved to be too much for
the Cardinal. The Fighting Illi
ni's top four players are all
ranked among the top 22 players
in the nation.
Illinois came out firing, win
ning the first set in five of the six
singles matches. It quickly
wrapped up victories on courts
one and two to go up 2-1.
"We felt pretty confident after
winning the doubles, but they
came out and jumped on us in
the singles," Whitlinger said.
"Illinois didn't lie down, that's for
sure."
No. 8 Martin lost 6-2, 6-4 to
No. 3 Delic on court one while
Lipsky lost 6-2, 6-2 to No. 12 Wil
son on court two. Warburg tied
the match at 2-2 when he posted
an impressive 6-2, 6-2 victory
over No. 20 Stolt on court four.
