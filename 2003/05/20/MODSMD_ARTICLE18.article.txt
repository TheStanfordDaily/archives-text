# Forood, Liu earn respective honors
## Coach honored the same day women begin NCAA singles tourney 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
One a day after her team fell
one match short of a third straight
NCAA title, head coach Lele
Forood was honored as the Na
tional Coach of the Year by the
ITA.
The third-year leader of the
Cardinal owns an impressive 82-3
record and nearly claimed her
third national title in as many years
on Sunday. In addition, Forood
and her squads are 17-1 in NCAA
play.
Eighth-year assistant coach
Frankie Brennan was also recog
nized as the Assistant Coach of the
Year.
As a duo, Forood and Brennan
guided a relatively inexperienced
yet very talented Cardinal squad to
a Pacific-10 Conference title and
the NCAA finals, where it fell to the
Florida Gators, 4-3.
Freshman Amber Liu, the Car
dinal's top singles player through
out the season, rebounded from
the disappointing team loss on
Sunday to win her first-round
match at the NCAA Women's Ten

nis Singles Championships in
Gainesville, Florida.
Liu — the No. 5 seed and
ranked No. 4 nationally — beat
Julie Rotundi of Florida, 6-4, 6-3.
The victory was a bit of revenge
for the freshman and the Cardi
nal, as Rotundi sealed the cham
pionship for Florida a day earlier
with a 6-0, 7-5 defeat of junior
Lauren Barnikow.
Later in the day, Liu was
named 2003 Rookie of the Year
by the ITA. In addition, she
helped lead the Cardinal to the
conference championship with
her strong singles play, earning
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
award.
Liu was the only Stanford com
petitor to advance past the first
round of the 64-player tourna
ment.
Freshman Alice Barnes was
edged by fellow Pac-10 participant
Dea Sumantri of Washington, 7-6
(5), 6-3. Barnikow fell, 6-0, 6-1, to
Mira Radu of Mississippi, while
sophomore Erin Burdette
dropped a 6-2, 6-2 decision to
Christina Fusano of California.
The two will now compete as the
top seed in the doubles tourna
ment, which begins today.
Liu will continue her run for the
individual title today, when she
faces Jessica Roland of Texas
A&M.
