ATHENS, Ga (AP) â€”Chad Har
ris battled for four hours and 42
minutes, fighting off two match
points to lead Vanderbilt into the fi
nals of NCAA Men's Tennis Tour
nament Monday with a 4-3 win over
UCLA.
The Commodores (27-3) will
play the winner of the Illinois-Stan
ford semifinal match for the cham
pionship. Vanderbilt will be trying
to win the school's first national title
in any sport.

Flaying at No. 2 singles, Harris
beat Marcin Matkowski 5-7, 7-6 (7-
2), 6-4 to give Vanderbilt the semifi
nals victory.
Even nature seemed to be against
Harris when his serve killed a bird at
5-5 in the first set.
"It was a huge point," Vanderbilt
coach Ken Flach said. "Of course,
Chad told me he hit the perfect
serve."
"I thought I aced him," Harris
said. "I thought the ball exploded at

first. I feel horrible for the bird."
Matkowski won the replayed
point and the first set, then served
for the match at 5-4.
"Marcin had two match points on
his serve, and that is his big
weapon," said UCIA Coach Hilly
Martin, "and we didn't get it."
Matkowski lost badly in the sec
ond-set tiebreaker and fell behind
two breaks in the third set.
"His whole body looked like he
personally fell apart," said Martin.

"He was so down on himself for not
pulling Ihe match away. After the
second break, he had his mind back,
but I guess we dug too deep a hole."
The match was twice interrupted
when light rain made the courts slick.
Vanderbilt won the doubles
point and took a 2-0 lead when
Bobby Reynolds won at No. 1 sin
gles over UCLA's Tobias Clemens,
6-3, (i-4. But UCLA's Erfan I)ja-
