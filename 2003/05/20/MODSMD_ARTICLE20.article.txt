# Texas basketball reins supreme this season
## 
### 
California may have more
electoral votes, better
beaches and a bigger bud
get crisis, but two things
that it does not have over Texas this
year are the number of teams in the
Western Conference finals of the
NBA playoffs. All year long, the ex
perts have been predicting that it
would once again come down to a
Kings-Lakers matchup to deter-

o
mine the Western
Conference
championship.
But as the dust
settled on a wild
week of basket
ball, the only two
teams left stand
ing in the only
conference that

really matters in
basketball both hailed from the
Lone Star State.
The Dallas Mavericks and San
Antonio Spurs tipped off their best
of-seven series last night in what
promises to be an exciting and
hard-fought semifinal. And unfor
tunately for Californians, what was
supposed to be an Interstate 5 semi
final matchup will be taking place
along 1-35 instead.
Few things have given me such
immense pleasure as watching the
Lakers get absolutely dismantled
on their home floor by Tim Duncan
and company. And the fact that
Rick Fox's broken foot caused him
great physical pain for the entirety
of the series made watching the
Lakers get eliminated that much
sweeter.
The Spurs were clearly the deep
er and more talented team, but few
gave them much of a chance of
overcoming the Lakers' champi
onship aura. But after losing games
three and four and then trying des

perately to lose game five, the Spurs
put it all together in game six and
routed the three-time defending
champs.
San Antonio residents should all
send a nice thank you card to
Robert 1 lorry for hand-delivering
the series to the Spurs. Usually
money in die clutch, Horry missed
a potential game-winning three that
would have broken the backs of the
Spurs. He was so broke during the
entire series that retardetl kids with
fatal diseases were sending him get
well soon cards.
Mavericks fans have plenty of
thank you cards to send out as well.
The biggest should go to the GM of
the Denver Nuggets, who was gen
erous enough to ship Nick Van Exel
to Dallas last season. Nick the Quick
absolutely put on a show for the
Sacramento fans, drawing them out
of their double-wides just long
enough to see him embarrass Mike
Bibby, Bobby Jackson and Doug
Christie time and time again. Van
Exel and Steve Nash more than
made up for their dismal perfor
mances in last year's playolfs against
Sacramento by torching the Kings'
backcourt with regularity.
I for one am disappointed that
the series is over, because none
that will follow will even come
close to the entertainment value of
watching these two teams race up
and down the court and rain down
threes. Game two was without
question the single greatest offen
sive display in the history of the
modern NBA (and I never speak
in superlatives, they're the simple
tools of weak minds. Just listen to
Bill Walton for 10 seconds and
you'll see what I mean). The Kings
scored 63 points in the first half

and still trailed by 20. The Mavs'
83 point first-half outburst was
one of the most incredible sport
ing spectacles I've seen in a long
time. The combined 146 points
tallied by these teams in two quar
ters was only 4 points shy of the
final score of game one of the East
ern Conference finals.
So now we're down to two. The
two teams that tied for the best
record in the N BA during the reg
ular season going head to head for
state supremacy. So for the dura
tion of the series, cast your George
Bush bashing and your NRA com
ments aside. Eschew you jokes
about death row, cattle ownership,
Texas A&M, and Enron. And for
get about the recent failures of the
Stars, Cowboys, Rangers and As
tros. Because for the next few
weeks, Texas is the indisputable
king of sports, and Californians
will just have to hope that the Gi
ants and Angels will be around
come October.
My prediction: Mavs in seven,
Pistons in seven. In the finals, Mav
ericks over Pistons in five. And just
as I wrote back when the season
began, the Mavs will win it all.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in eco
nomics, and he would appreciate it if
Kings fans umdd stop making excuses
about Webber being injured. You have the
next five months to deal with it. He can be

With only one senior on the team, junior Kim Kouwabunpat — who finished
34th in the regional competition — will have to help lead the women in the
NCAA tournament.
