# Women's golf begins NCAAs

### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After doing battle with a talented field at last week's
NCAA Western Regional, the Stanford women's golf team
has been rewarded for its solid play with an even stiller test
this week. The Cardinal tees off tomorrow at the NCAA
Championship in West Lafayette, Ind. and will compete
for four days against the best female golfers in the country.
The 72-hole event — the longest of the year — will take
place at the Kampen Course of the Birck Boilermaker Coif
Complex, one of two full-length tracks on the Purdue cam
pus. When Stanford sets foot on the par-72 6,225-yard lay
out, the atmosphere of postseason play will be nothing
new.
The Cardinal is making its 20th appearance at the
NCAA Championship tournament overall, and its 15th in
a row. It represents the longest current streak of any team
in the country.
In the past, Stanford has been right at home on the pres
sure-packed national stage, finishing in the top 10 in seven
of the last eight years. This year's starting unit should be
well prepared for the demands of championship competi
tion, as freshman Kelly Husted is the only starter without
NCAA championship experience.
The Cardinal brings a measure of momentum into this
week's event, as it comes off a strong final round at the
Western Regional that clinched the championship berth.
Stanford was able to respond to the pressure of possible
elimination last week, shooting 9-over par — the team's
best score of the week — in the event's last 18 holes.
Stanford's starting six will need all the momentum they
can muster, because the field at this week's tournament is
one that befits a national championship. After a round of
elimination tournaments at the regional level, almost any
member of the 23-team field in West Lafayette has the abil
ity to take home the title if things go right.
Among the favorites, however, are No. 1 Duke and No.
3 Southern California. The Duke Blue Devils are the de
fending national champions and are led by junior Virada
Nirapathpongporn, the defending individual champion.
The Blue Devils come off their third consecutive NCAA
Eastern Regional victory and look to have very few weak
nesses coming into this event.
"We are going into nationals with five golfers all of
whom can all finish very high at the championship," Duke
coach Dan Brooks said. "That is exciting."
Southern California also appears to have the talent to
contend fora national title. The Women of Troy would
seem to be due fora strong performance in the champi
onship, having reached the final event 15 times in the last
21 years without claiming victory.
