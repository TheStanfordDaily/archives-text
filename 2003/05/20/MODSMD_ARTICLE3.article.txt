# Janitors ratify new contract
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS JENNIFER GRAHAM STAFF WRITERS 
Over the weekend, janitors of the Ser
vice Employees International Union ap
proved a new contract with maintenance
subcontractors, avoiding a strike and low
ering the monthly premiums SEIU Local
1877 workers pay for health care.
As a result of the new contract, the
more than 100 janitors subcontracted by
American Building Maintenance who
work at Stanford — as well as the nearly
7,ooojanitors from Silicon Valley and the
East Bay represented by SEIU 1877 —
will now pay $30 a month for the next
four years as a contribution to their
health care coverage; the payment will go
down to $20 per month in the contract's
fifth and final year.
The janitors currently pay $77 per
month and had threatened to strike
when, due to rising health care costs, the
subcontractors had planned to raise the
janitors' monthly co-pay to $145 per
month, effective June 1.
"The workers ratified the contract

three to one," said Beth Trimarco, com
munications coordinator for SEIU Local
1877. "There were about a thousand peo
ple there. People brought their families,
and there was a big celebration."
She added, "They were very happy,
but this is just a step out on the path our
of poverty."
In addition to reducing the janitors'
monthly health-care contribution, the
new contract also granted a $1 per hour
wage increase to be implemented over
the life of the contract and granted work
ers seniority, meaning that laid-off work
ers are the first on the list to receive jobs
when a new account opens.
The previous contract between ABM
and the union expired on the evening of
April 30 when the two parties were not
able to come to an agreement on health
care costs. The union argued that dou
bling the monthly health care co-pay
would be unaffordable for the janitors,
who make between $9.64 and $10.64 an
hour. Negotiations were extended for
two weeks, at which point the union said
it would vote on whether to strike if an
agreement was not reached.

On Friday, students of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition presented Uni
versity President John Hennessy with a
petition asking for his support in the
drive for the SEIU Local 1877 workers to
lower their health care costs. The peti
tion, complete with 584 signatures, asked
the University to guarantee a positive
outcome to negotiations.
The coalition's petition urged the Uni
versity to become more involved in em
ployee contracting issues, citing the recent
Silicon Valley examples of Genentech and
eßay, companies that have agreed to help
pay for rising health care costs.
Throughout the process, Stanford
maintained its policy of not interfering in
the collective-bargaining process be
tween the subcontractors and the union.
After meeting with SI AC members on
Friday, Hennessy released a statement ac
knowledging the immediacy of rising
health-care costs and pledging financial
support from the University for workers it
employs directly, but reiterating Stanford's
policy toward subcontracted workers.
"The University has maintained and
will continue to maintain a policy of non

interference with regard to workers em
ployed by sub-contractors," Hennessy
said in the statement. "At the same time,
we recognize the critical importance of
access to health care for workers during
the current economic downturn.

"This recognition has led to Stanford's
efforts to moderate the rise in cost of
health care for our own employees," he
continued. "Despite the challenging fi-

nancial atmosphere and a cam
pus-wide salary freeze, the Uni
versity will contribute additional
funds in the next year to lessen
the impact of those increases, par
ticularly for those employees who
earn the least."
Hennessy also expressed his
belief that ABM and the union
would be able to come to an
agreement.
"We encourage the compa
nies with which we contract to
help ensure that health insur
ance remains affordable for all
workers on the Stanford cam
pus," he said.
After meeting with Hennessy,
members of SLAC released a
press release praising the Univer
sity for taking on some degree of
financial responsibility for the
health-care costs of ABM-subcon
tracted janitors.
"This is a huge victory, as Stan

ford has never taken direct respon
sibility for the working conditions
of subcontracted workers in a pub
lic statement before," SLAC repre
sentatives stated in an official press
release. "This is also a tremendous
victory for students, as we have
demonstrated our commitment to
Stanford workers through peti
tions, rallies and persistence."
However, Chris Christoffer
son, associate vice provost and di
rector of Facilities Operations,
said that he was unaware of any
involvement on the University's
part in the negotiations and that
the University had maintained its
policy of non-interference.
Regarding settling negotia
tions with the subcontractors, Tri
marco praised the efforts of jani
tors to fight for better benefits.
"As the janitors have shown,
we've beaten back a bad economy,
we've beaten back the health-care
crisis and, most importantly, beat
en back the cynicism that says the
basic needs of working people
could not be met in this economic
climate," she said.
