# Groups target Hoover
## 
### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, the Hoover Coali
tion, a student group that believes
that the Hoover Institution is in
appropriately biased politically
and in need of reform, held a town
hall meeting at Tresidder Union
to outline their goals.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice
and Elevated Minds Embracing
Righteousness and Gaining
Equality, the meeting consisted of
four undergraduate speakers
who, after giving their presenta
tions, formed a panel to discuss
change-related issues in a question
-and-answer session.
The speakers listed changes
that they wanted to see in four
areas and called for the Institution
to comply with Stanford's Acade
mic Freedom Policy, change hir
ing policies so as to diversify facul
ty, submit its publications to peer
review and change its mission

statement.
Panelist /Mien Beye Riddell, a
senior, said, "Stanford University,
in the sense that it lends credibility
to the Hoover Institution, plays a
huge role in how it is perceived in
the country and around the
world."
The Academic Freedom Policy
assures the full protection of free
dom of inquiry and thought at
Stanford, which the panelists
claimed contradicted the Hoover
Institution's mission statement.
"Hoover is overtly political —
you can see it in their documents,
you can see in their mission state
ment," said freshman panelist
Joanna Fiduccia.
Hoover's mission statement
says that the government should
only become socially or economi
cally involved if the people and the
local government are unable to do
so themselves.

the hiring and those fellows [who
are nominated] do not fall under
the same scrutiny as faculty hiring
does," said senior Angad Bhalla,
one of the panelists. "The Hoover
Institution technically doesn't ad
vocate anything, but it is driven by
its mission statement and individ
uals within the institution put out
policies that should not be coming
out of an institution that is con
nected to a university that up
holds Stanford's standards of aca
demic freedom."
The panelists also discussed
how diversifying hiring practices
would change some of the policies
that are coming out of it.

According to freshman Mojan
Movassate, though the fellows
hired by Hoover are not re
quired to pass the scrutiny of the
Advisory Board, the University
still has final say and appoints a
committee to oversee each hiring
decision.
"Since the University makes the
final decision on whether or not a
candidate can be given an appoint
ment at Hoover, this end of the
route provides yet another check
in assuring that candidates have
not been chosen based on their po
litical views," Movassate said.
Panelist Kalonji Nzinga, a fresh
man, said that the results of reform
would significantly alter how
Hoover affects policy.
"The Hoover Institution has a
lot of influence on a lot of other
institutions in our country,"

Nzinga said. "How they view race
has a lot to do with how other
agencies within the government
view race . . . Six out of six affir
mative action experts that
Hoover claims to have are against
affirmative action. We believe in
the coalition that more diversity
in the institution would change
some of the policies that are com
ing out of it."
According to Public Affairs
Manager of the Hoover Institution
Michele Horaney, "The students
are certainly free to discuss the
issue and make their opinions. We
have had the utmost close relation
ship with the University and it has
been made clear that the Hoover
Institution received the full sup
port of the administration, and
that the administration received
the full support of Hoover."
