# Police boost role at Exotic Erotic
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 680 Lomita's "Exotic Erotic" party on Saturday,
officers from the Stanford Police Department video
taped students for evidence of underage drinking,
handed out at least two minor in possession citations
to students inside 680 and threatened to arrest bar
tenders serving minors, representing a stark depar
ture from the normally hands-off role of the police at
Stanford parties.
Police allege that lax security at the event necessi
tated their presence. House staff claim that the police
actually made the fete less safe due to their lack of fa
miliarity with the event's party plan.
During the event, neither Residential Education
nor the Office of Student Act ivities was contacted by
the police, house staff or the hired security firm.
Months before the first party flier went up and the
first shirt came off for Exotic Erotic, house staff at 680
met with Joey Greenwell, assistant director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, and representatives from
Residential Education. They out
lined a 1,161-word party plan,
contracted with an outside security
firm to provide 15 officers, con
tacted the Department of Public
Safety to have two off-duty police
men on site, erected temporary
fencing and had the fire marshal
inspect the house.
However, despite careful plan
ning, police officers were still
called to the scene of Exotic Erotic
before the official start of the party.
At 9:50 p.m., the two off-duty offi
cers who were supervising the
party noticed that the 15 security
officers contracted from Luce En
tertainment had not yet arrived.
Students were entering and exit
ing the house without going
through a security check. The offi
cers called the Stanford Police De
partment to bring in reinforce
ments.
Shortly thereafter, three police
officers arrived. They took control
of the party and supervised en
trances and exits until the security

officers arrived.
But it was not until after 10:15,
when the private security officers
had shown up and guests were al
lowed into the party, that house
stall members and police officers
began to disagree about what hap
pened Saturday night.
The police say that when they
arrived, several hundred people
had entered the party without ID
verification, creating a situation in
which it was impossible to enforce
the legal drinking age.
"That caused a lot of problems,"
said Captain Nick Brunot of the
Stanford Police. "People without
wristbands were getting inside. No
one knew who was supposed to be
able to drink."
However, Nirav Patel, 680's so
cial manager, said that the action
ol police officers on the scene may
have made the party less safe for
attendees. Because the police were
unfamiliar with the party plan —
which included four different
kinds of wristbands to identify mi
nors and regulate drinking —
they did not know how to proper
ly handle the situation.
Patel said that the Stanford
Event Patrol officers at the party,

both of whom were off-duty Stan
ford deputies, were unable to give
crowd estimates and control the
crowd properly, which was their
intended role. When reinforce
ments arrived, he said that the sit
uation worsened.
"The bartenders were forced to
defend the bar from guests that
were over 21 and wanted drinks,"
reads a complaint Patel is filing
with the University. "They were
asked to perform a security role
that they were not trained or pre
pared to do. Moreover, the bar be
came a safety hazard as guests, who
could not be informed that alcohol
service had stopped, piled up
against the bar in hopes of getting
a drink."
A bartender, in an anonymous
e-mail attached to Patel's state
ment, complained that the police
threatened to arrest residents if
they served alcohol to minors.
"[He] told us repeatedly and
quite forcefully that they would ar
rest us if we served to anyone
under 21 and who did not have an
ID," he said. "We asked if we could
serve to those who had wristbands,
and they said no, that everyone
had wristbands and that we had to

check IDs at the bar."
Additionally, Patel complained
that the videotaping of the event
by the police — a measure that po
lice said was undertaken to docu
ment underage drinking — made
residents and guests feel uncom
fortable.
"I don't think videotaping was
appropriate," he said. "They want
ed to document alcohol being
served to minors. But in the con
text of Exotic Erotic it makes a lot
of people uncomfortable — it's
not an appropriate measure."
Junior Jordan Miller, a party
goer, complained that the video
taping made his friends uncom
fortable.
"I know that the girls I was with
were very nervous about the man
videotaping the party," he said. "We
didn't know who that guy was."
Patel complained that the plain
clothes officer who handed out ci
tations to minors in possession of
alcohol inside the party acted in an
arbitrary and unpredictable man
ner.
"I didn't know the plainclothes
officer was there until well into the
party," he said. "[He] watched
people being served until two

women were served, lie pulled
them aside and asked for 11).
"He was serving MIPs in the
VIP room. If he were in uniform,
behavior of people would be very
different," Patel continued.
Although the police stopped
bar service at 12:15 a.m., they al
lowed the party to go on until 1
a.m., as was originally proposed in
the party plan.
Three individuals are being in
vestigated for possible charges, two
of whom for public intoxication
and one of whom for threatening a
private security officer.
"One individual threatened a
security officer with a knife,"
Brunot said. "But when we
reached him and searched him, he
didn't have a knile."
Two party attendees were hos
pitalized that night for alcohol
abuse. One was taken to the hospi
tal by his friends, and another was
taken by the police.
"A third individual was found
on the ground throwing up," said
Brunot. "To my knowledge, she
was not a Stanford student. Final
ly, at 2 a.m., she gave us her mom's
name, and we called her."
Director of Residential Educa

lion Jane Camarillo said that Uni
versity aims to take an "education
al response" to the actions of Sat
urday night, but that students who
acted inappropriately will be held
accountable.
"Each time we sponsor a large
scale event, there are bound to be
unanticipated occurrences, and I
am confident that the student staff
at 680 Lomita and the stall of the
Department of Public Safety all
ac ted in a way that prioritized not
only the health and safety of our
students but also focused on having
a successful safe event," she said.
Camarillo added, "As a matter
of course, Residential Education
will always take steps to have an ed
ucational response in the actions
that the stall take in response to
misconduct. However, students
will be expected to clearly accept
the consequences of their actions,
particularly if they clearly violate
University policy or the residence
agreement."
Although the party did not go
exactly as planned, one party-goer
said he still enjoyed himself.
"1 think the party was well run,
and everyone had a good time,"
said senior Claudio Storelli.

But it was not until after 10:15,
when the private security officers
had shown up and guests were al
lowed into the party, that house
stall members and police officers
began to disagree about what hap
pened Saturday night.
The police say that when they
arrived, several hundred people
had entered the party without ID
verification, creating a situation in
which it was impossible to enforce
the legal drinking age.
"That caused a lot of problems,"
said Captain Nick Brunot of the
Stanford Police. "People without
wristbands were getting inside. No
one knew who was supposed to be
able to drink."
However, Nirav Patel, 680's so
cial manager, said that the action
ol police officers on the scene may
have made the party less safe for
attendees. Because the police were
unfamiliar with the party plan —
which included four different
kinds of wristbands to identify mi
nors and regulate drinking —
they did not know how to proper
ly handle the situation.
Patel said that the Stanford
Event Patrol officers at the party,

both of whom were off-duty Stan
ford deputies, were unable to give
crowd estimates and control the
crowd properly, which was their
intended role. When reinforce
ments arrived, he said that the sit
uation worsened.
"The bartenders were forced to
defend the bar from guests that
were over 21 and wanted drinks,"
reads a complaint Patel is filing
with the University. "They were
asked to perform a security role
that they were not trained or pre
pared to do. Moreover, the bar be
came a safety hazard as guests, who
could not be informed that alcohol
service had stopped, piled up
against the bar in hopes of getting
a drink."
A bartender, in an anonymous
e-mail attached to Patel's state
ment, complained that the police
threatened to arrest residents if
they served alcohol to minors.
"[He] told us repeatedly and
quite forcefully that they would ar
rest us if we served to anyone
under 21 and who did not have an
ID," he said. "We asked if we could
serve to those who had wristbands,
and they said no, that everyone
had wristbands and that we had to

check IDs at the bar."
Additionally, Patel complained
that the videotaping of the event
by the police — a measure that po
lice said was undertaken to docu
ment underage drinking — made
residents and guests feel uncom
fortable.
"I don't think videotaping was
appropriate," he said. "They want
ed to document alcohol being
served to minors. But in the con
text of Exotic Erotic it makes a lot
of people uncomfortable — it's
not an appropriate measure."
Junior Jordan Miller, a party
goer, complained that the video
taping made his friends uncom
fortable.
"I know that the girls I was with
were very nervous about the man
videotaping the party," he said. "We
didn't know who that guy was."
Patel complained that the plain
clothes officer who handed out ci
tations to minors in possession of
alcohol inside the party acted in an
arbitrary and unpredictable man
ner.
"I didn't know the plainclothes
officer was there until well into the
party," he said. "[He] watched
people being served until two

women were served, lie pulled
them aside and asked for 11).
"He was serving MIPs in the
VIP room. If he were in uniform,
behavior of people would be very
different," Patel continued.
Although the police stopped
bar service at 12:15 a.m., they al
lowed the party to go on until 1
a.m., as was originally proposed in
the party plan.
Three individuals are being in
vestigated for possible charges, two
of whom for public intoxication
and one of whom for threatening a
private security officer.
"One individual threatened a
security officer with a knife,"
Brunot said. "But when we
reached him and searched him, he
didn't have a knile."
Two party attendees were hos
pitalized that night for alcohol
abuse. One was taken to the hospi
tal by his friends, and another was
taken by the police.
"A third individual was found
on the ground throwing up," said
Brunot. "To my knowledge, she
was not a Stanford student. Final
ly, at 2 a.m., she gave us her mom's
name, and we called her."
Director of Residential Educa

lion Jane Camarillo said that Uni
versity aims to take an "education
al response" to the actions of Sat
urday night, but that students who
acted inappropriately will be held
accountable.
"Each time we sponsor a large
scale event, there are bound to be
unanticipated occurrences, and I
am confident that the student staff
at 680 Lomita and the stall of the
Department of Public Safety all
ac ted in a way that prioritized not
only the health and safety of our
students but also focused on having
a successful safe event," she said.
Camarillo added, "As a matter
of course, Residential Education
will always take steps to have an ed
ucational response in the actions
that the stall take in response to
misconduct. However, students
will be expected to clearly accept
the consequences of their actions,
particularly if they clearly violate
University policy or the residence
agreement."
Although the party did not go
exactly as planned, one party-goer
said he still enjoyed himself.
"1 think the party was well run,
and everyone had a good time,"
said senior Claudio Storelli.
At 680 Lomita's "Exotic Erotic" party on Saturday,
officers from the Stanford Police Department video
taped students for evidence of underage drinking,
handed out at least two minor in possession citations
to students inside 680 and threatened to arrest bar
tenders serving minors, representing a stark depar
ture from the normally hands-off role of the police at
Stanford parties.
Police allege that lax security at the event necessi
tated their presence. House staff claim that the police
actually made the fete less safe due to their lack of fa
miliarity with the event's party plan.
During the event, neither Residential Education
nor the Office of Student Act ivities was contacted by
the police, house staff or the hired security firm.
Months before the first party flier went up and the
first shirt came off for Exotic Erotic, house staff at 680
met with Joey Greenwell, assistant director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, and representatives from
Residential Education. They out
lined a 1,161-word party plan,
contracted with an outside security
firm to provide 15 officers, con
tacted the Department of Public
Safety to have two off-duty police
men on site, erected temporary
fencing and had the fire marshal
inspect the house.
However, despite careful plan
ning, police officers were still
called to the scene of Exotic Erotic
before the official start of the party.
At 9:50 p.m., the two off-duty offi
cers who were supervising the
party noticed that the 15 security
officers contracted from Luce En
tertainment had not yet arrived.
Students were entering and exit
ing the house without going
through a security check. The offi
cers called the Stanford Police De
partment to bring in reinforce
ments.
Shortly thereafter, three police
officers arrived. They took control
of the party and supervised en
trances and exits until the security

officers arrived.
