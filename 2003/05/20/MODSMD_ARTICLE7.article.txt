## Debra Feldstein will continue to fundraise 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Debra Feldstein has announced her de
cision to step down as the executive direc
tor of Hillel, the independent organiza
tion on campus representing the Jewish
community. She maintains that although
the job has been "extremely demanding,"
her decision to leave is a personal one.
"Working as the executive director of
Hillel at Stanford has been one of the most
rewarding professional experiences that I
can imagine," she said. "However, I am
entering a new chapter in my life and the
time has come for me to focus on some ex
citing new opportunities."
Feldstein moved to her position as ex
ecutive director of Hillel at Stanford four
years ago from her former job as the di
rector of development for the I lillel Foun
dation at Tufts University.
"This position was so interesting to me
because it was an opportunity for me to
combine my skills and experience along
with my commitments to supporting the
Jewish community, promoting activism
and awareness of social justice issues, cre
ating opportunities for dialogue and
working with college-age students," she
said.
Most students credit Feldstein with

making a significant difference in Jewish
life on campus since her arrival.
"Debra came to Stanford with a vision,"
said freshman Carla Fenves, a member of
Hillel. "And she's really transformed Hil
lel into a welcoming community for so
many Jewish students on campus."
Feldstein still plans to remain active in
the organization by heading Hillel's
fundraising, the area to which she believes
she can contribute the most.
"While we have been very successful on
multiple fronts, raising funds to support
the operations and programs that serve
thousands of individuals every year re
mains as our greatest challenge, especially
in the current economic environment,"
she said.
Because Hillel does not receive any
funding from Stanford, almost all of its
financial support comes from alumni,
faculty, parents and local community
members.
One of Feldstein's primary goals next
year is to continue to raise funds for the
completion of the Harold and Libby Ziff
Center for Jewish Life, which will house Hil
lel's programs and activities in the future.
Though a new executive director has
yet to be named, Feldstein said she is con
fident that the Hillel staff will have no dif
ficulty running the organization while the
Executive Committee of the Jewish Lead
ership Council, in cooperation with the
representatives of the 22 student groups
served by Hillel, search fora replacement.
