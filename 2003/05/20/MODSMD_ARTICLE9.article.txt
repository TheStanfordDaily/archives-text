## AASA hosts fundraiser 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Willi rock music blaring in the background,
six habit-clad Stanford men busted a move on
die runway in Tresidder Oak Lounge on Sat
urday night. The "monks" were part of the
opening act to Reconstyle, an annual fashion
show hosted by the Asian American Student
Association. Proceeds from this year's show will
go to the Jade Ribbon Campaipn s»~
launched by the Asian center in May
2001 aimed at promoting awareness about
liver cancer and chronic hepatitis B.
Called "the silent Asian epidemic," hepati
tis B affects as many as one in 10 Asian and Pa
cific Islander Americans. Asians are 10 times
more likely than Caucasians to die of liver
cancer.
Head Coordinator Ilaria Chan, a sopho
more, deemed the show a big success. Both
performances Saturday night were "packed,"
in Chan's words, and the event raised just
under $2,000.
Chan stressed that the event had attracted
a diverse audience.
"There were a lot of non-Asians, as well as
Stanford staff and faculty," she said. "The
show itself exhibited a variety of styles, and
the group of models was made up of many
different races."
The 23 models who performed in the show
walked "theT" in everything from sportswear
to formal attire. In some acts they participat
ed in complex, choreographed dance moves;
in others they strutted down the runway in
the traditional manner, pausing frequently to
strike poses.
Chan called the show "magical."
"It was definitely a really great experience.
All of the hard work paid off in the end."
"Hard work" certainly was invested in the
project. Along with coordinators Jane Feng
and Cheryl Lam, Chan started preparing for
the event back in November. Rehearsals with
models started in winter quarter but didn't
get into full swing until spring, according to
model Justin Carl, a freshman.
Chan described the ups and downs of
preparing for the show.
"The coordination was really stressful at
times," she said. "It's hard to have to work in
tensively for something that is supposed to be
fun. It was very moving in the end when
everything was finally over."
Carl agreed that the show had sapped a lot
of energy.
"I didn't realize how much work it would
take to put on our show, but in the end it was
worth it,"he said. "Practice until 4:30 a.m. in
the morning the night before the show and
then having to be there for more rehearsal the

next morning at 8:45 a.m. — wow, that was
insane. I guess the delirium from lack of sleep
made it even better because I had such an
amazing time."
Audience members also enjoyed the show.
"I was impressed by all of the clothes, par
ticularly the clothes made by the student de
signers," said Miklos Raibon, a freshman. "1

thought they put the show together really
well."
Carl summed up the experience:
"I met some remarkable people that I feel
genuinely lucky to get to know. The show it
self was an adrenaline rush. It was nerve
wracking, exciting, hilarious, rushed and
crazy fun."
