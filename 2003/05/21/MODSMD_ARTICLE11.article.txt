## To the color orange: Terrorism alert level rises 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Bush administra
tion, concerned that a wave of attacks overseas
could spread to the United States, raised the ter
rorism alert level to orange yesterday and called for
increased security nationwide.
Authorities described the intelligence pointing
to a domestic attack as general in nature, with noth
ing credible suggesting a time, location, method or
target. They pointed to last week's bombings in
Saudi Arabia and Morocco as part of a coordinated
series that could spread.
"The U.S. intelligence community believes that
al-Qaida has entered an operational period world
wide, and this may include attacks in the United
States," Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge
said.
Ridge warned of attacks similar to those in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where gunmen fought with
guards before suicide bombers detonated truck
bombs at several lightly defended residential com
plexes.
State and local authorities began reacting after
yesterday's announcement. Police in California
began working 12-hour shifts. National Guard

troops in New York were called up to protect sub
ways and bridges. In Washington, the Capitol po
lice SWAT team prepared to conduct random pa
trols.
The decision to raise the national alert to or
ange, signifying a "high" risk of attacks, from yel
low, meaning an "elevated" risk, came after a re
view of intelligence information by President
Bush's homeland security council yesterday, White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. Orange is the
second-highest on the five-color alert scale.
Federal law-enforcement officials said that
among the intelligence picked up recently were
two electronic transmissions that discussed the pos
sibility of an attack on New York, Washington,
Boston and more broadly the U.S. coastlines. The
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there were doubts about the credibility of the
threats and stressed that they were not the driving
factors in the decision to raise the threat level.
Ridge encouraged governors and mayors to de
ploy extra police and take other precautions, par
ticularly at large public gatherings during the up
coming Memorial Day weekend.
