BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip
(AP) — Hundreds of Palestinians
demonstrated yesterday after a
five-day Israeli invasion damaged
farms and buildings, but in a rare
twist, their wrath was directed at
Palestinian militants for inviting
the attack by firing rockets from
their property.
Two hours after Israeli troops
left, about 600 angry residents of
the town of 35,000 took to the
streets in a spontaneous protest,
complaining that the militants had
caused Israel to destroy 15 houses
and uproot thousands of olive, cit
rus and date palm trees. It was a
rare outburst; most Palestinian
demonstrations are aimed at Israel.
The protesters blocked a main
road with trash cans, rocks and
burning tires in a show of outrage
against the militants. Most of the
rockets are launched at towns in
side Israel by members of the mili
tant Islamic movement, Hamas.
"They (the militants) claim they
are heroes," said Mohammed Zaa
neen, 30, a farmer, as he carried
rocks into the street. "They
brought us only destruction and
made us homeless. They used our
farms, our houses and our chil
dren ... to hide."
Israeli forces pulled back to the
edge of the town, Beit Hanoun, a
letup that came despite a wave of
five Palestinian suicide bombings
that killed 12 people in Israel in
addition to the attackers. The pull
back suggested Israel might not
undertake a large-scale punitive
military operation, as it has in the
past, so as not to weaken the new
Palestinian prime minister, Mah
moud Abbas.
