# U.S. bans all beef from Canada

### 
TORONTO (AP) â€” The Unit
ed States banned all beef imports
from Canada after a lone case of
mad cow disease was discovered in
the heart of Canada's cattle coun
try yesterday.
The discovery raised concern
because Canada and the United
States had put in place feeding
practices authorities thought
would prevent the infection from
spreading in North America.
Still, officials stressed it was an

isolated case.
"Information suggests that risk
to human health and the possibili
ty of transmission to animals in the
United States is very low," U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Ann Vene
man said in a statement.
The infected cow, an 8-year-old
from a farm in northern Alberta,
was slaughtered on Jan. 31, Cana
dian Agriculture Minister Lyle
Vanclief told a news conference in
Edmonton. He said it was killed

because it was believed to have
pneumonia, and testing in Eng
land confirmed yesterday it had
bovine spongiform encephalopa
thy, or BSE.
It was the first case of BSE in
North America in a decade.
He stressed the diseased animal
never reached human or animal
consumption, the known method
of spreading the infection. It can
not be transmitted between live
animals.
