Editorial

In a move that surprised the world,
the United States decided to offer its
support fora global anti-smoking
treaty on Sunday. The world-wide
treaty, which was approved on a prelimi
nary basis by the World Health Organiza
tion yesterday, would ban all forms of to
bacco advertising, increase the size and
number of tobacco health warnings, imple
ment stricter consequences on tobacco
smuggling and ban cigarette sales to mi
nors in countries that do not have these
laws in effect. The United States' recent
stated support for the treaty comes as a
shock to many world leaders because only
a couple of months ago, the Bush adminis
tration said it would not sign the treaty un
less it included a provision that any country
could opt out of a condition if the country
deemed it objectionable.
In April of this year, the administration
stated that it had reservations about ap
proving a treaty that could impinge on
U.S. constitutional rights, but the fact that
the United States is one of the largest ex
porters of tobacco — controlled by the to
bacco giant Phillip Morris — to developing
nations might have something to do with
these "reservations." In March, when the
treaty was well-received at the Geneva con
vention, only two countries were reluctant
to sign it: the Dominican Republic and the
United States.
Yet apparently these reservations have
been quelled, and U.S. Health Secretary
Tommy Thompson has expressed strong
support for the treaty, promising that the
United States will be one of the signatures
on the treaty. Forty countries are needed
for ratification and the treaty will go to a
full session of the 192-member World
Health Assembly today, where the voting is
formal.
Considering the United States' history
of international treaties in the past — par
ticularly those that restrain the economy of
the country — the vote today will be a true
test of whether the Bush administration
can place the nation and world's health
above the interests of a few powerful tobac
co companies. In 2001, the United States,
much to the disappointment of nations
around the world, withdrew its approval
from the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to
reduce international greenhouse gas emis
sions.
The Bush administration needs to be
held accountable for the promises the
United States makes to other nations and
international organizations. Moreover, as a
powerful and influential nation, the Unit
ed States needs to set an example for other

countries. Health experts estimate that
over 5 million people die from cigarette-re
lated related causes each year — up to 70
percent of these deaths are from people in
developing countries. In this country, we
are fortunate to have the technology and
funds to help those who have made the
choice to smoke help recover some of their
health, but in less aflluent nations, this is
not an option.
Smoking is a pressing health concern
that needs to be addressed. In the United
States, smoking-related health costs force
people to spend an astounding $ 130 billion
each year. Smokers are not the only ones af
fected by cigarettes; mothers who light up
raise their children's risk for abnormal
lung function, which could persist
throughout life.
In California and other regions of the
country, non-smokers are protected from
many of the harms of cigarette smoke
through strict smoking restrictions; people
are not allowed to smoke in public build
ings or workplaces and an overwhelming
number of flights are stringently non
smoking. But in other areas of the world,
these laws simply do not exist. People who
work in areas where smokers frequently
light up, such as waitresses or bartenders,
are surrounded by secondhand smoke for
hours on end, slowly and indeliberately in
haling the carcinogenic compounds pre
sent in the air. While the treaty may not ban
smoking in its entirety, eliminating the ad
vertisements that often prompt young peo
ple to smoke is an important first step.
Thus the war against smoking will need
to be fought on two fronts: through inter
national agreements such as the anti-smok
ing treaty and on the local and immediate
level through education and smoking pre
vention programs.
At Stanford, the feasibility of influencing
international treaties is quite a challenge,
something that will be left to our graduates
in the years to come. But there are changes
that can be made on a smaller scale that are
as important as those taking place in the
global realm. Support and volunteer for
health and anti-smoking programs at local
schools. Set an example for younger kids
— and directly prevent personal health
problems later on — by making the choice
not to smoke. Smoking is the single most
important preventable cause of death in
the United Suites and the choice to start
smoking now can reduce your life ex
pectancy by 10 to 25 years.
We would be wise to keep in mind Ma
hatma Gandhi's words: "We must be the
change we wish to see in the world."
