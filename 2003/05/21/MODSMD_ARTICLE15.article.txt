Publishing Armenian Genocide denial columns is
not responsible journalism
I am disheartened to learn that The Daily pub
lished a guest column this volume denying the occur
rence of the 1915 Armenian Genocide. I add my
voice to the many who believe The Daily has acted in
gross error.
The Armenian Genocide is simply historical fact.
In 1915, the Ottoman Turkish government planned
and executed horrific: atrocities against its Armenian
citizens. One and a half million Armenians were
slaughtered systematically or placed in barbaric
death marches into the Syrian desert. More than
500,000 others were forced into exile and stripped of
their possessions, never to return to their ancient
homeland.
Although the state of California and 30 other
states, dignitaries ranging from Pope John Paul II
to Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Klie
Wiesel, current Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha
Power, numerous countries and a near-unanimous
academic community have acknowledged the Ar
menian Genocide, The Daily has asserted that it has
a "right and responsibility to share a variety of views
with the Stanford community" about the Genocide.
Given the content of these past viewpoints, I can
only infer this to mean that The Daily will allow fu-
ture Genocide denials to appear
on its pages.
A denialist "view" of the Geno
cide, which the paper defends as
lit to print, is not a balancing po
sition. It is the falsification and re
pression of a historical record
that has been borne out by count
less eyewitnesses and survivors,
discovered in the communiques
that have escaped the Turkish
government's ongoing suppres
sion of the matter and agreed
upon by historians and academics
the world over.
1 have met with actual sur
vivors of the Genocide. 1 have
seen in their faces the anguish
that comes from having had their
lives decimated, their loved ones
butchered and their world up
ended through no personal fault,
i o allow even one wholesale de
nial to appear in the paper only
days alter April 24, the day on
which Armenians formally re
member their slaughtered family
members, is nothing short of
greatly insensitive.
To exercise The Daily's jour
nalistic "rights and responsibili
ties," as the editor's note states,
does not require The Daily to
publish "both sides of the story."
In fact, when one side is demon
strably false, a responsible jour
nalist has a greater obligation not
to publish that side, or to indicate
the fallacy of that claim. A respon
sible journalist must not rely on
what each side says, but must look
into the facts and make an in
formed decision on the elfects of
what is being published.
I truly hope The Daily will re
consider its position and do what
is right: Never again allow The
Daily to be co-opted by those who
knowingly engage in deceit and
no longer publish blanket denials
of the Armenian Genocide.
