## Surveys, sex and togas 
### 
As anyone with a Stanford
e-mail account knows,
surveys are a big deal on
campus, lake this sur
vey! Win a brand-new car! Every
department and organization on
campus wants to know what you
think of them: Dining Services,
Housing Services, Drug Services;
it seems like everyone is making
sure to ask we students what we
think of them and how they can
better serve us. Each time I com
plete as survey, I hope that I'll be
one of the lucky students that gets
that $100 gift certificate to the
Stanford mall. No luck so far.
Recently, the Office of Fresh
man and Transfer Students re
leased the results of the compre
hensive freshman satisfaction sur
vey, completed by the freshmen
last year. Nearly half of the current
sophomore class answered ques
tions regarding academics, cam
pus life, freshman advising and
overall feelings of satisfaction. In
my opinion, however, there were a
few things they forgot to publish
regarding other important parts
of student life.
Here are the results 1 suspect
were missing:
Who's the smart one? 42 per
cent of students said they felt
"smarter" by the end oft heir fresh
man year; 25 percent said they
were at the same intellectual level
as when they entered Stanford; 20
percent filled in sketches of phallic
symbols and wrote "Pee Wee
Rocks" and 12 percent said they
felt dumber by the end of their first
year. (Incidentally, all those who
felt dumber took "Serious Laugh
ter" for I-Hum.)
Thirty-three percent of fresh
men still couldn't believe they were
accepted to Stanford, while anoth
er 31 percent said tliey couldn't be

lieve the dude in room 318 ac tual
ly got in.
Is it all about sex? Obviously not,
according to these results: 58 per
cent of freshmen were not able to
get laid this year, 43 percent of those
checked the box that said "Not
much different from home anyway,
so who cares?" Twenty-four per
cent said they got some over the
course of the year, but half of those

later marked the
"1 lied" box; 18
percent believed
they had sex, but
weren't entirely
sure.
Twenty-seven
percent of fresh
man admitted to
having sexual at-

traction toward a professor; 22
percent said they would sleep with
a professor in order to earn a bet
ter grade and 25 percent said they
never got close enough to an actu
al tenured professor to see if he or
she was attractive or not.
Ahhh, good of freshman year
memories . . . There's the joyful
experience of sharing your life
with a complete stranger: 55 per
cent said they had no ill will toward
their roommate; almost 30 per
cent thought of taking a Paper
Mate pen and sticking it in their
roommate's eye; 14 percent actu
ally did take a Paper Mate pen and
stuck it in their roommate's eye
and 1 percent drained the ink
from their Paper Mate pen, mixed
it in a cocktail of Jack Daniels, Pine
Sol and Cheer laundry detergent
and gave it to their roommate as a
special birthday drink.
Then there's the magic word:
diversity. We celebrate it, flaunt it
and overanaly/e it. Sixty-three
percent of freshmen were "satis
lied" with the amount of diversity

on campus; the other 37 percent
wanted to see more diversity on
the Farm, with 52 percent of those
people indicating they want to see
some more theme houses. The
most desired house was the albino
/ transsexual / vegetarian / women
ofcolor / NRA theme house.
The Scandinavian / one-armed
/ dyslexic / BBC-watching theme
house was a close second.
Food in college is an important
part of life, but our current sopho
mores weren't too pleased. Seven
ty-live percent said they had got
ten sick from at least one meal at
Stern Dining. A whopping 25 per
cent of students surveyed said they
enjoyed the food in the dining
halls, but 99.99 percent of these
students also admitted to having a
congenital disorder where they
lack taste buds.
In terms of opinions about
party life on campus, 78 percent
attended at least one party during
their freshman year. Eighty per
cent of guys waited at least an hour
before getting into the party,
while girls reported an average
waiting time of five minutes. The
same statistics applied when wait
ing for beer at the kegs. Once
these kids got into the party, 59
percent reported they had fun,
but couldn't stand watching their
sketchy RAs hook up with their
freshman residents.
Some kids were apparently dis
illusioned with the "real college ex
perience": 41 percent of freshmen
thought college life would be like
the movie "Animal House;" 25
percent of those went to a party
dressed in a toga at one point and
started chanting "toga, toga" and
15 percent of those who did
stopped once they realized how


Jim Mosqueda
stupid they looked. The 10 per
cent that didn't realize this? I hey
also reported rushing a fraternity.
Hey, you're a pre-med, too?
Apparently, 50 percent of incom
ing students decided they would
take the pre-med track at Stan
ford. Then they took Client 31.
Need 1 say more?
As you can tell from reading
the above — previously unpub
lished— statistics, the freshman
experience is a varied one. So
don't believe everything you read.
After all, haven't you always heard
the line about how you can lie with
statistics? They can only tell so
much about a place and how peo
ple feel about it. Hopefully these
newly discovered facts will help
the University better address the
needs of the incoming Class of
2007. And please — no togas.
