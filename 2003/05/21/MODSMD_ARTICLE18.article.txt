# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Egg donorship should continue, with restriction 
### JOSEPH SHAPIRO GUEST COLUMNIST 
I am responding to the editorial "Corn
modifying human life," (May 19). The edi
torial states that selling human eggs is ethi
cally troublesome because that saleeugeni
< ally selects offspring, offends dignity, in
volves improper acceptance of risk and dis
proportionately benefits wealthy couples.
Hie Daily's advertising department could
reasonably respond to these arguments by
refusing to include requests of race, intelli
gence, appearance and other donor traits
in egg donor advertisements. But I believe
I lie Daily should continue to print egg
donor advertisements.
The editorial first criticizes ttait-based
egg selection and the sale of body parts as
the same problem of "commodification."
Kugenics and commodification are sepa
rate problems that merit separate treat
ment.
Moreover, the editorial suggested a
concern over whether egg sale advertise
ments allow eugenic selection of offspring.

Such advertisements announce in 40-
point bold font that a taller, whiter, SAT
high-scoring, sport-starring child has
more worth than an that of the average
child. While dollars poorly indicate worth,
dollars do represent America's standard
measure of value. If the prominence of
those ads promotes inequality between
races and socioeconomic groups, The
Daily could refuse to print egg advertise
ments that specify race, intelligence, athlet
ic potential and other such requirements of
donors. Infertile couples might still screen
potential donors based on those traits. But
such a policy would keep The Daily from
promoting egg selection based on buyer
bias and would therefore keep The Daily
from condoning eugenic announcements
of egg seekers.
Second, the editorial criticizes the sale of
any human body pait and concludes that
"the human Imklv should never be given a
price." Most Americans accept the sale of
dead hair or toenails but squirm ;it the sale
of eggs. An average American might argue
that the sale of most body parts under

mines human dignity. That claim is
strange, because no property of an arm
severed in a car accident or blood spilled in
a fight appears to endow the arm or blood
with dignity.
A person only undermines dignity, I
think, when she sells body parts tlnit help
the human body operate. After all, those
body parts enable a person to live and so
enable her to have dignity. Furthermore, a
person identifies those parts with herself.
Witness, "I had a heart attack" vs. "My
heart stopped," or "I le hit me" vs. "I le hit
my arm." Because a person's organs are in
tertwined with the person's identity, if sell
ing a whole person offends dignity, then
selling a person's organs should equally of
fend dignity. But an egg is not an organ. It
plays no role in the workings of the
woman's body, and so I believe the sale of
eggs should not offend dignity.
Third, the editorial board worries that
deeply indebted college students may see
only payoff and ignore the risks that egg
donation entails. That concern could rea
sonably inspire the state policy require-

ment that a donor pass a regimen enc
aging informed consent before she
nates an egg. But a large payoff in re
for slight risk rarely merits treatment c
than provision of informed consent, a
should not do so here. Should Califc
prohibit an indebted boxer from ris
his health to earn a large purse? Every
son exchanges risk for time, pleasure
income. While we might worry that s
of those exchanges should be informec
should not for that reason forbid thos<
changes.
Fourth, the editorial argues that "sc
medical resources should not be avai
on the general buy-and-sell market."
principle most worries me. Should h<
tals deny expensive new surgery t
niques to wealthy patients? Should cl
refuse to purchase expensive me<
equipment until the price of that ec
ment has fallen to a generally afford
level.'' Surely not. While we should cl
that health care be accessible to all, the
lubitive cost of some practices
should not make us deny those
practices to everyone.
The sale of eggs may offend The
Daily's editorial board, but mere of
fense is unreasonable justification
fora prohibition on the sale of eggs
or for the ceasing to print advertise
ments for eggs. But the promi
nence of those advertisements in
America's elite universities, pro
moting the message that light
skinned, tall, intelligent, athletic hu
mans embodying the advertised
traits have more value than other
children, may by itself create harm.
And that harm could be good rea
son for The Daily to stop printing
such traits in advertisements for egg
donors.
