He was 5-foot nuthin',
100 and nuthin' and
had maybe a speck of
athletic ability. But like
Rudy, the famed Notre Dame
football walk-on who surmounted
incredible odds to play for the
most storied franchise in collegiate
sports, Jon Heller was a warrior.
This is a story of a high school
student who made the most out of
his four years, never passed up an
opportunity and ended his career
as an accomplished high school

athlete. This is a
story of athletic
triumph, but it is
also a story that is
rarely seen at
Stanford. We are
worse off for not
knowing the tri
umph Jon feels.
This is his story.

Jon Heller moved from Chica
go to the North Bay in the summer
after eighth grade, coming into a
new school with new faces and new
groups. There was no ice hockey
team, no Cubs fans and no up
and-coming Ditkas. We were all
Marin hippy kids, some of us for
mer classmates of Taliban fighter
John Walker Lindh. This wasn't
Chicago.
But he made his friends and
participated in activities. As an
avid fan of pro wrestling (he
bawled like a baby when Triple H
made his return to the ring after a
devastating quadricep injury),
"creeking" (basically like
canyoneering for the unskilled),
and sports in general, Jon was a
very active individual, and, before
growth spurts, separated his 5-
foot-10-inch frame from the bas
ketball crowd — he was a bailer.
He was an athletic kid — always
running, always in shape, always
outdoors. The problem was that
he just wasn't that skilled at most
California sports. He didn't have
the foot skills for soccer or the
height for basketball or the affinity

for baseball. He was a JV super
star, a jack of all trades, but a mas
ter of none.
But that was all changed when
the swimming team, a team that
dominated the local high school
league for years, announced that
they needed swimmers during the
second semester of our senior
year.
In a school of only 360, this was
a common problem among sports
teams. It wasn't unheard of to
show up to an athletic event as a
fan and find yourself competing
midway through. Especially with
varsity-only, unlimited-roster
sports like swimming and cross
country, our high school teams ac
cepted all comers with open arms
So in the hot and balmy spring
semester of 2001, five of my
friends, including myself, decided
to swim for our high school, for
each other and for ourselves. Actu
ally, you're right, we just really
wanted to wear Speedos and shave
our legs.
Two of us had been swimming
for years and would go on to colle
giate success in the pool. But Jon,
Preston and I — three newcomers
whose previous experience in the
water involved rafts, wings and
water weenies — were ready for
the challenge.
Predictably, I was the first —
and only, to fail — remembering
that I have a phobia that I like to
call Spencer-likes-to-breathe-pho
bia that the state of being under
water triggers severely.
Also, I burp. Every lap, in the
middle of the pool, I burp. Loud
ly. It isn't funny, it isn't goofy. It is
a violent, turbulent, painful and
chlorinated explosion from within
my chest that makes me look like a
total idiot.
But Jon stuck with it. He wasn't
great, he didn't have particularly
good technique, and he didn't
have a lot of power, but he did

have heart. God knows lie had heart.
And let me tell you — heart wins cham
pionships.
In fact, that's what it came down to,
the championships. We knew it would be
a close meet, a meet attended by all
schools in one major melee. At this point
I was the team's No. 1 fan, in charge of
playing the "Game Day" mix tape I
wrote about a couple weeks ago.
Jon jumped in for his 100 meter
breaststroke, having gotten through the
first heat. Eight people were racing, and
Jon was predicted to finish in eighth
place. Every point was crucial in this
meet. We needed Jon to do well.
As if answering a call from above, Jon
burst off the start with a flourish. With
his Happy Gilmore-esque "I'm really a
hockey player but I'm swimming today"
style, Jon seemed impassioned about this
race.
Unfortunately, tragedy struck on the
flip-turn. Halfway through the race, as
he neared the wall, Jon began his turn,
but due to the slickness of his freshly
shaven legs, his Speedo made a beeline
for his toes.
The pool, in fact, had pantsed him.

Jon struggled on the next lap, his
legs struggling against his Speedo as
he mooned the greater part of the
crowd. He was presented with a dilem
ma: should*he stop his momentum,
pull up his speedo and save some em
barrassment, or should he just muscle
it out and still have a chance to place in
the race, letting the crowd enjoy his
shaved ass?
It was a no-brainer for Jon. Undoubt
edly aided by his unfortunate penchant
for exhibitionism, he kicked his heart
out, losing the Speedo entirely with
about 20 meters left in the race, and leav
ing me with a mental image 1 will not
soon forget.
But by this time the nudist had
dropped into fourth place, with first
place certainly out of reach. But here is
where he dug deep. Well, he dug as
deep as a short, naked-but-for-a-swim
cap and shaven high school senior
could dig.
With five feet left in the race, second
place was up for grabs with three swim
mers dead even. With one last, violent
and naked struggle, Jon reached as far as
his heart could take him, reaching the
wall for second place, scoring our high
school two points for his efforts.
It wasn't a lot of points, and it was just
one race, but it certainly embodies all
that is wonderful about high school ath

letics. Taking advantage of competitive
athletic opportunities for regular stu
dents at Stanford is just something that
doesn't happen, as these opportunities
just don't exist. There are no JV pro
grams, only a few student-led ASSU
groups that meet for the love of the
game. No competition, just play. And
while these efforts are truly excellent,
there is just no way for the Jon Hellers of
Stanford to make an impact on their own
or anyone else's life.
So maybe you'll write (his column off,
say that it is too trite, too emotional and
too unrealistic. You'll think, "So what?
What's the point? So one kid came in sec
ond place in a crappy league after his
speedo fell off. So he tried hard. Big
freaking deal. It didn't matter. It was a
nice story, but the fact that Jon swam
made no difference to me, or anyone but
himself."
Jonathan Alexander Heller scored
two points for Marin Academy High
School in the championship meet of the
Bay Counties League in the spring of
2001.
Marin Academy won the meet by one
point.

Spencer Porter, a sophomore, wants to know if
your Speedo fell off at Exotic Erotic and
whether it was caught on camera by the police.
