He was 5-foot nuthin',
100 and nuthin' and
had maybe a speck of
athletic ability. But like
Rudy, the famed Notre Dame
football walk-on who surmounted
incredible odds to play for the
most storied franchise in collegiate
sports, Jon Heller was a warrior.
This is a story of a high school
student who made the most out of
his four years, never passed up an
opportunity and ended his career
as an accomplished high school

athlete. This is a
story of athletic
triumph, but it is
also a story that is
rarely seen at
Stanford. We are
worse off for not
knowing the tri
umph Jon feels.
This is his story.

Jon Heller moved from Chica
go to the North Bay in the summer
after eighth grade, coming into a
new school with new faces and new
groups. There was no ice hockey
team, no Cubs fans and no up
and-coming Ditkas. We were all
Marin hippy kids, some of us for
mer classmates of Taliban fighter
John Walker Lindh. This wasn't
Chicago.
But he made his friends and
participated in activities. As an
avid fan of pro wrestling (he
bawled like a baby when Triple H
made his return to the ring after a
devastating quadricep injury),
"creeking" (basically like
canyoneering for the unskilled),
and sports in general, Jon was a
very active individual, and, before
growth spurts, separated his 5-
foot-10-inch frame from the bas
ketball crowd — he was a bailer.
He was an athletic kid — always
running, always in shape, always
outdoors. The problem was that
he just wasn't that skilled at most
California sports. He didn't have
the foot skills for soccer or the
height for basketball or the affinity

for baseball. He was a JV super
star, a jack of all trades, but a mas
ter of none.
But that was all changed when
the swimming team, a team that
dominated the local high school
league for years, announced that
they needed swimmers during the
second semester of our senior
year.
In a school of only 360, this was
a common problem among sports
teams. It wasn't unheard of to
show up to an athletic event as a
fan and find yourself competing
midway through. Especially with
varsity-only, unlimited-roster
sports like swimming and cross
country, our high school teams ac
cepted all comers with open arms
So in the hot and balmy spring
semester of 2001, five of my
friends, including myself, decided
to swim for our high school, for
each other and for ourselves. Actu
ally, you're right, we just really
wanted to wear Speedos and shave
our legs.
Two of us had been swimming
for years and would go on to colle
giate success in the pool. But Jon,
Preston and I — three newcomers
whose previous experience in the
water involved rafts, wings and
water weenies — were ready for
the challenge.
Predictably, I was the first —
and only, to fail — remembering
that I have a phobia that I like to
call Spencer-likes-to-breathe-pho
bia that the state of being under
water triggers severely.
Also, I burp. Every lap, in the
middle of the pool, I burp. Loud
ly. It isn't funny, it isn't goofy. It is
a violent, turbulent, painful and
chlorinated explosion from within
my chest that makes me look like a
total idiot.
But Jon stuck with it. He wasn't
great, he didn't have particularly
good technique, and he didn't
have a lot of power, but he did
