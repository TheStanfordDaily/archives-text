### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
Jason Biltz is going off to join the
circus.
A recent Stanford graduate,
Biltz was hired by Cirque du Soleil,
a Canada-based performance
troupe. But Cirque is not just any
circus, and Biltz is not just any per
former.
Biltz as a gymnast ranked
among the collegiate elite. At the
2002 USA Gymnastics Champi
onships in Cleveland, Ohio, he
placed 15th, one place off a spot on
the national team. Biltz also trained
in dance and theater and double
majored in economics and drama
while at Stanford. 'The Stanford

gymnastics coaches describe him as
having the unique combination of
supple power.
"He's one of those freak of na
ture gymnasts who can do flexibili
ty and strength," said men's coach
Thorn Glielmi. "Usually gymnasts
are flexible but not strong, or strong
but not flexible. But he's both."
Biltz graduated last spring but
has been working with Glielmi as an
assistant coach this year. To get the
chance to train with Cirque, Biltz
submitted an audition tape with
highlights of his past competitions.
He was then invited to partici
pate in an intensive auditioning
process in Los Angeles in Decem
ber. As part of the process, Biltz had
to complete several exercises in im

provisation. Volunteering for one
of the first exercises, Biltz was told to
climb to the top of a rope and sit
there fora minute.
"They said, 'Are you comfort
able up there? Then go, sing us a
song,'" recalled Biltz. "1 sang Old
Mac Donald."
The rendition must have been a
good one, as the talent scouts from
Cirque were impressed not only
with his gymnastic skill, but also
with his theatrical capacity.
"Taking part in characters, that
is what is interesting with him.
We're not always getting that," said
Cirque du Soleil talent scout Fab
rice Becker. "It's very unusual on a
high level gymnast and a very good
surprise."

Biltz has been a gymnast since he
was seven and has been on stage al
most as long. When he was 12, Biltz
was featured on "Star Search" as
part of a dance troupe. They won
the contest and Biltz said he has
looked for ways to get back into per
forming ever since.
But Biltz's interest specifically in
Cirque du Soleil began several
years later, when he first went to
one of their performances.
"My junior year in high school I
saw 'Mystere' in I,as Vegas," he
said. "I knew then that 1 wanted to
be a part of it."
In terms of gymnastic move
ment, Biltz seems destined fora
