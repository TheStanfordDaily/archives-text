# Card gymnast adopted by Cirque troupe
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
Jason Biltz is going off to join the
circus.
A recent Stanford graduate,
Biltz was hired by Cirque du Soleil,
a Canada-based performance
troupe. But Cirque is not just any
circus, and Biltz is not just any per
former.
Biltz as a gymnast ranked
among the collegiate elite. At the
2002 USA Gymnastics Champi
onships in Cleveland, Ohio, he
placed 15th, one place off a spot on
the national team. Biltz also trained
in dance and theater and double
majored in economics and drama
while at Stanford. 'The Stanford

gymnastics coaches describe him as
having the unique combination of
supple power.
"He's one of those freak of na
ture gymnasts who can do flexibili
ty and strength," said men's coach
Thorn Glielmi. "Usually gymnasts
are flexible but not strong, or strong
but not flexible. But he's both."
Biltz graduated last spring but
has been working with Glielmi as an
assistant coach this year. To get the
chance to train with Cirque, Biltz
submitted an audition tape with
highlights of his past competitions.
He was then invited to partici
pate in an intensive auditioning
process in Los Angeles in Decem
ber. As part of the process, Biltz had
to complete several exercises in im

provisation. Volunteering for one
of the first exercises, Biltz was told to
climb to the top of a rope and sit
there fora minute.
"They said, 'Are you comfort
able up there? Then go, sing us a
song,'" recalled Biltz. "1 sang Old
Mac Donald."
The rendition must have been a
good one, as the talent scouts from
Cirque were impressed not only
with his gymnastic skill, but also
with his theatrical capacity.
"Taking part in characters, that
is what is interesting with him.
We're not always getting that," said
Cirque du Soleil talent scout Fab
rice Becker. "It's very unusual on a
high level gymnast and a very good
surprise."

Biltz has been a gymnast since he
was seven and has been on stage al
most as long. When he was 12, Biltz
was featured on "Star Search" as
part of a dance troupe. They won
the contest and Biltz said he has
looked for ways to get back into per
forming ever since.
But Biltz's interest specifically in
Cirque du Soleil began several
years later, when he first went to
one of their performances.
"My junior year in high school I
saw 'Mystere' in I,as Vegas," he
said. "I knew then that 1 wanted to
be a part of it."
In terms of gymnastic move
ment, Biltz seems destined fora
performance arena such as Cirque. Former
men's coach Sadao Hamada has been work
ing with the gymnast since the summer of
Biltz'sjunior year in high school and says that
Biltz has a unique style that is aesthetically
pleasing to watch.
"He was pretty solid all around, stylish, el
egant," Hamada said. "He's beautiful to
watch, everything is technically correct and
it's very crowd pleasing."
Biltz is not the first Stanford student to join
Cirque du Soleil. In 1996, gymnast Jamie
Ellis joined "Mystere." Ellis is now retired.
For his part, Biltz said it was just time to
move to the next stage in his career. He had
been preparing for Cirque fora long time by
focusing on dance and theater at Stanford,
and a back injury last year made him certain
that performance, not competition, was the
logical next step.
Although Biltz has now made it past the au
ditioning process, he is not yet guaranteed a
spot in one of the shows. In June, Biltz will trav
el to Montreal, where he will join 60 other per
formers fora 16-week training session. 'Hie
training will test how each person learns and
evolves. It will also prepare them as replace
ments for current performers. Most people
eventually secure the initial two-year contract.

but Biltz could return home for several months
before he is selected to join a show.
"Jason has many possibilities, if not
(at the Bellagio in Las Vegas) maybe some
thing else," said Becker. "I'm sure he will end
up on one of our shows"
In Montreal, Biltz will train initially for the
Bateau act in "O." Bateau consists of a huge
metal frame, shaped like a ship, which swings
20 feet over a pool of water. As the boat
swings back and forth, eight gymnasts per
form on an apparatus embedded in the ship's
frame. Biltz's part in the act would consist of
performing on parallel bars and high bar. He
would then drop through the frame of the
boat to be caught by a man hanging upside
down underneath.
"I was brought out to see the show two
months ago," Biltz said. "I sat third row center,
it was amazing."
Biltz is aware that the training will be de
manding and that there is a possibility he will
not get a job in the end but is much more ex
cited than daunted by the process.
"It's the culmination of everything I've
ever done in my life," he said.
As for the costume aspect of the show, Biltz
said there is only one tiling that makes him
hesitate.
"I'd like to stay away from thongs as much
as possible."

Cirque du Soleil began several
years later, when he first went to
one of their performances.
"My junior year in high school I
saw 'Mystere' in I,as Vegas," he
said. "I knew then that 1 wanted to
be a part of it."
In terms of gymnastic move
ment, Biltz seems destined fora
performance arena such as Cirque. Former
men's coach Sadao Hamada has been work
ing with the gymnast since the summer of
Biltz'sjunior year in high school and says that
Biltz has a unique style that is aesthetically
pleasing to watch.
"He was pretty solid all around, stylish, el
egant," Hamada said. "He's beautiful to
watch, everything is technically correct and
it's very crowd pleasing."
Biltz is not the first Stanford student to join
Cirque du Soleil. In 1996, gymnast Jamie
Ellis joined "Mystere." Ellis is now retired.
For his part, Biltz said it was just time to
move to the next stage in his career. He had
been preparing for Cirque fora long time by
focusing on dance and theater at Stanford,
and a back injury last year made him certain
that performance, not competition, was the
logical next step.
Although Biltz has now made it past the au
ditioning process, he is not yet guaranteed a
spot in one of the shows. In June, Biltz will trav
el to Montreal, where he will join 60 other per
formers fora 16-week training session. 'Hie
training will test how each person learns and
evolves. It will also prepare them as replace
ments for current performers. Most people
eventually secure the initial two-year contract.

but Biltz could return home for several months
before he is selected to join a show.
"Jason has many possibilities, if not
(at the Bellagio in Las Vegas) maybe some
thing else," said Becker. "I'm sure he will end
up on one of our shows"
In Montreal, Biltz will train initially for the
Bateau act in "O." Bateau consists of a huge
metal frame, shaped like a ship, which swings
20 feet over a pool of water. As the boat
swings back and forth, eight gymnasts per
form on an apparatus embedded in the ship's
frame. Biltz's part in the act would consist of
performing on parallel bars and high bar. He
would then drop through the frame of the
boat to be caught by a man hanging upside
down underneath.
"I was brought out to see the show two
months ago," Biltz said. "I sat third row center,
it was amazing."
Biltz is aware that the training will be de
manding and that there is a possibility he will
not get a job in the end but is much more ex
cited than daunted by the process.
"It's the culmination of everything I've
ever done in my life," he said.
As for the costume aspect of the show, Biltz
said there is only one tiling that makes him
hesitate.
"I'd like to stay away from thongs as much
as possible."

The multi-talented Jason Blitz, who finished a storied gymnastics career on the Farm in 2002, will look to secure a spot on a Cirque du
Soleil performance during training this summer.
Jason Biltz is going off to join the
circus.
A recent Stanford graduate,
Biltz was hired by Cirque du Soleil,
a Canada-based performance
troupe. But Cirque is not just any
circus, and Biltz is not just any per
former.
Biltz as a gymnast ranked
among the collegiate elite. At the
2002 USA Gymnastics Champi
onships in Cleveland, Ohio, he
placed 15th, one place off a spot on
the national team. Biltz also trained
in dance and theater and double
majored in economics and drama
while at Stanford. 'The Stanford

gymnastics coaches describe him as
having the unique combination of
supple power.
"He's one of those freak of na
ture gymnasts who can do flexibili
ty and strength," said men's coach
Thorn Glielmi. "Usually gymnasts
are flexible but not strong, or strong
but not flexible. But he's both."
Biltz graduated last spring but
has been working with Glielmi as an
assistant coach this year. To get the
chance to train with Cirque, Biltz
submitted an audition tape with
highlights of his past competitions.
He was then invited to partici
pate in an intensive auditioning
process in Los Angeles in Decem
ber. As part of the process, Biltz had
to complete several exercises in im

provisation. Volunteering for one
of the first exercises, Biltz was told to
climb to the top of a rope and sit
there fora minute.
"They said, 'Are you comfort
able up there? Then go, sing us a
song,'" recalled Biltz. "1 sang Old
Mac Donald."
The rendition must have been a
good one, as the talent scouts from
Cirque were impressed not only
with his gymnastic skill, but also
with his theatrical capacity.
"Taking part in characters, that
is what is interesting with him.
We're not always getting that," said
Cirque du Soleil talent scout Fab
rice Becker. "It's very unusual on a
high level gymnast and a very good
surprise."

Biltz has been a gymnast since he
was seven and has been on stage al
most as long. When he was 12, Biltz
was featured on "Star Search" as
part of a dance troupe. They won
the contest and Biltz said he has
looked for ways to get back into per
forming ever since.
But Biltz's interest specifically in
Cirque du Soleil began several
years later, when he first went to
one of their performances.
