The Stanford women's golf team got off to a
solid start on Tuesday, as play began at the
NCAA Championship in West Lafayette, Ind.
Playing in its 15th consecutive championship,
the Cardinal looked a bit shaky in the early
going, but eventually settled down, carding a
28-over par 316 in its first round.
With that score, Stanford moved into a tie
for seventh place in a field of 24. The Cardinal
is looking to improve on last year's 1 lth-place
finish, the first time in eight years that the team
had missed the top 10.
Southern California jumped out to a three
stroke lead over second-place Oklahoma State
with a 17-over par 305, 11 strokes ahead of the
Cardinal. Duke, the defending NCAA champi
on, finished the day in a tie for 12th place.
Duke's Virada Nirapathpongporn, the
reigning NCAA champion, was up to her old
tricks and is tied for the tournament lead with
OSU's Annie Thurman at even par.
Senior Kim Rowton led Stanford out of the
gates, firing a 2-over par 74. On the demand
ing Kampen Course at the Birck Boilermaker
Golf Complex, her round was one of the day's
best and moved her into a four-way tie for third
place overall.
Junior Angela Rho was five shots off Row
ton's pace, recording a 79 in her opening
round. After struggling a bit in her first nine
holes, Rho got sharper as the day wore on, and
she currently stands tied for 36th place individ
ually.
Freshman Kelly Husted, the only member
of Stanford's starting six without NCAA cham
pionship experience, showed some youth in
her first few holes, stumbling out of the gate.
However, she appeared to get more comfort
able with her surroundings and finished strong
with a pair of birdies in her final three holes to
card an 81.
While Husted tied for 64th place after the
first day, junior Kim Kouwabunpat was just a
shot behind her. Kouwabunpat, in contrast to
her teammates, never seemed to find her
rhythm and went to the clubhouse tied for
75th.
Sophomore Wendra Liang rounded out the
scoring for Stanford, shooting 12-over par 84.
Although she played a bit better in her second
nine, Liang could only manage a tie for 93rd
place at the end of the day.
