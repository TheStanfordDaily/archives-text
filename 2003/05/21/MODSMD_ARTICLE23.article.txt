# Crew defeats Huskies for first Pac-10 title
## 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
The Washington Huskies have
spent years making their mark on
women's crew, rounding up titles
in eveiy level of collegiate competi
tion, including three NCAA titles.
But at this weekend's Pacific-10
Championships (which is typically
a perennial showcase of Washing
ton dominance — the Huskies
have won 19 Pac-10 titles), it was
Stanford's turn to charge into con
ference history.
The then-No. 6 Cardinal
brought the Huskies' 11-year win
ning streak in the varsity eight to a
halt, and in the process earned
Stanford's first-ever conference
title in the event.
"There has never been a Pac-10
rowing title for Stanford on either
the men's or women's side, so
coming across the line first was an
unbelievable feeling," senior team
captain Laurie Benson said.
The Cardinal boat was in sec
ond place early in the race, behind
NCAA defending champion
Washington, but after some ag
gressive rowing in the first 1,000
meters, Stanford pulled ahead of
the pack. The squad increased its
lead with every stroke until sweep
ing over the finish with a time of
6:30.3 minutes — 4.4 seconds
faster than the second-place
I luskies.
Stanford also finished the varsi
ty eight ahead of other tough com
petitors, including No. 3 Califor
nia and No. 8 Southern California.
The entire season for the Card
has been sprinkled with what
coach Aimee Baker calls "glimpses
of greatness," but a dramatic win
over some of the best rowers in the
country was definitely not some

thing that anyone predicted.
In fact, the performance proba
bly surprised everyone except for
the Stanford women themselves,
according to Benson.
The varsity eight race capped
an already successful weekend for
the Cardinal.
In earlier competition, the sec
ond Stanford varsity eight secured
a bronze medal with a time of
6:46.5, coming in just behind the
Cal and Washington boats.
The varsity four began its race
in sixth place, but displayed ex
ceptional endurance and pulled
into fifth ahead of USC.
Stanford's performances in all
three races were by far the best of
the season for the team.
Baker points out that this kind
of success is extraordinary, consid
ering that when the seniors en
tered the program, the team could
barely compete with Division II
boats. The Card rose in national
polls every year and maintained a
top-five rat ing for most of this sea
son.
"I am very proud and pleased
that [our seniors] can reap the
benefits of their dedication, loyalty
and hard work." Baker said.
The good news continues to
pour in for the crew program, as it
was announced Tuesday that
Stanford will compete in the 2003
NCAA Championships in Indi
anapolis later this month.
The NCAA bid was something
that Baker expected after the
weekend's tremendous perfor
mances made the Cardinal the No.
2 team in the West.
"We raced some of the best
teams in the country on Sunday,"
said Benson, "It will be exciting to
see how all of the West Coast boats
finish at the national level."
