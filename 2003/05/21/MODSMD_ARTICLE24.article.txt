New Rocks Discovered Orbiting Jupiter

Astronomers have discovered rocks
as small as 10 meters and no larger
than a few kilometers near Amalthea,
one of Jupiter's moons. It is not clear
whether the rocks are orbiting
Jupiter or the moon itself. These
rocks are the smallest yet discovered
orbiting a distant planet but as
tronomers have been discovering
many similar bodies in recent years.
The number is expected to skyrocket

with the Cassini mission to Saturn in 2004. In light of
recent findings, many astronomers are advocating a
revision of the exact definition of a moon. Some, like
Stanford physics Prof. Roger Romani, choose to clas
sify moons as any object orbiting a planet that is rocky
and roughly spherical.
50th Anniversary of DNA
2003 has been a key year in biology because it marks
the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure
of DNA. Though credited to James Watson and Fran
cis Crick, the discovery of the structure of DNA was
built upon almost a century of work by other scien
tists. In 1869 Friedrich Meischer observed "a large
molecule in the nucleus of cells" that he referred to as
nuclein. Meischer proposed that this molecule car
ried genetic information but his theory was not wide
ly accepted. In the 1930s Linus Pauling discovered
the alpha helix. In the 1940s Oswald Avery observed
that a bacteria could acquire another's properties via
the transfer of DNA. Soon after Erwin Chargaff dis
covered that DNA had four bases which paired ac
cording to specific rules. In the 1950s Rosalind
Franklin and Maurice Wilkins made X-ray crystallo
graphs of DNA that Watson and Crick used to assess
the double helix.
Gene Sequencing Sheds Light on SARS
Since the human genome was sequenced in 2001, the
pace of discovery has been accelerating at an un
precedented rate. Take SARS for instance. Thirteen
laboratories around the world collaborated to deci
pher its gene sequence, a process that took three
weeks. The project, led by the World Health Organi
zation, aims toward a greater understanding of the
virus and developing better diagnostic techniques. A
decade ago no single organism had its genome fully
sequenced. Now, there are over 100 organisms —
among which are E. coli, malaria and rice — that have
been sequenced.
Are the Days of the Dingo Numbered?
Dingoes, Australia's native dogs, are at risk of becoming
extinct in 50 years, says Gisela Kaplan, professor at the
University of New England. Farmers, suspecting the
dogs kill their cattle, have been exterminating the wild
dogs. Kaplan believes the true culprits are feral domes
tic dogs, or dog / dingo hybrids. The Australian gov
ernment's Biodiversity Audit issued a formal report
warning that nearly 3,000 biologically diverse systems
in the country were threatened. The report came after
a leaked internal communication, claiming that thou
sands of Australian species could become extinct.

Innovations in Rocket Propulsion
One of the biggest problems in spaceflight is weight
— approximately 90 percent of a rocket's weight is
fuel. Japan's space agency is developing a technology
that would eliminate that extra weight. The idea is to
have rockets use microwaves as propulsion. A ground
station could generate microwave beams to boost a
100 kilogram rocket into space. The problem is creat
ing the ground station since generating the mi
crowaves would require several gigawatts of power.
In the United States researchers are working on a
similar technology that uses laser beams instead. "It's
an attractive idea on paper . . . but I think it's a long
way off," said Hiroshi Maeda, a professor emeritus of
aeronautical engineering at Kyoto University.
Stanford Addresses E-mail Spam
Are you sick and tired of e-mail spam? Stanford re
sponded in fall 2002 by implementing the spam filter.
It scans e-mails being downloaded to your Leland ac
count (but not if you forward them to a non-stanford
account). The system marks each message with a
probability based on heuristic matching a number of
rules — does the subject line contain certain key
words, is it from a seemingly valid address, etc. Stu
dents may have noticed the system is not foolproof
and tends to give more false positives and less false
negatives. I I SS is considering an improved spam fil
ter. Meanwhile, AOL has issued a billion dollar law
suit against spammers and anti-spamming coalitions
are trying to unite under a common registry.
