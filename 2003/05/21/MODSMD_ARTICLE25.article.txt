# Technology on the move for summer:
## A
						Roundup of the Latest Laptops 
### JOHN SHAPIRO ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITERS 
In recent months, the introduction of Intel's Cen
trino mobile technology, featuring the Pentium-M
processor, has redefined computer speeds: bigger
numbers no longer give you a faster computer. In
fact, a 1.6 GHz Pentium-M chip is roughly equivalent

to a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4-M processor.
While somewhat confusing when
trying to purchase a computer, this
move by Intel will result in faster lap
tops running at cooler tempera
tures. It will also increase battery life
because these chips require less

power.
However, the Pentium-M is not
the only processor available on

cutting-edge laptops. We
looked at a Sharp Actius

UM32W with a 1.0
GHz Pentium 111 - M
processor, a Dell In
spiron 600m laptop
_ -1/2 nTT.. II a.'

with a 1.6 GHz Pentium-M proces
sor , and a Fujitsu S2OOO with a 1.7 GHz AMD
Athlon XP-M processor.

The Sharp Actius UM32W was the smallest and
lightest of the three, but several technical sacrifices
were made to trim it down. The processor is about a
year old, which is pretty significant in an industry

where speed doubles every 18 months. Also, there is
only a CD-ROM drive at a time when most mid-level
laptops have DVD and/or CD-RW drives.
The CD-ROM drive on the Sharp is external,
which is an extra thing to lug around, but if portabil
ity is your main concern, the Actius is a hands-down
winner. At just over 3 pounds and less than an inch
thick, it's hard to imagine a smaller computer.

While everything on the system isn't top
of-the-line, they did

manage to cram quite
a bit into a tinv case.

/
It comes with 256
MB of RAM (expandable to 512

MB), a 40 GB hard drive, a Firewire
port, a type 11 CF card slot (for easy
transfer of photos from many digital
cameras), and a VGA output port.
The screen is 12.1-inch display and
remarkably sharp. The unit also ships
with Windows XP Professional, which
is somewhat unusual — but much ap-

* predated — considering most other
units come with the toned-down XP
Home edition.

But, perhaps the most useful feature is the
exclusive Sharp retractable keyboard. What

this means is the keyboard retracts when the top is
closed for portability, but when open, offers an amaz
ing typing experience. This was quite a pleasant sur
prise considering the small size of the unit.
The Dell Inspiron 600m was the system featuring

Intel Gentrino mobile tech
nology. While slightly
heaver at just under 5
pounds, the 600m packs
quite a punch. The 1.6 GHz
Pentium-M processor is the

fastest currently
available, and the |
model we looked '
at had 512 MB of '
RAM and a 40 GB

hard drive. \
The 600 m's 14.1-
inch screen and ATI
64 M B video card de
liver a pretty astonish
;— „i : „

ing visual experience.
The Dell has* a l)Vl)/
CD-RW drive built in.
Another defining char-

actenstic is the amount or in
cluded software. It comes
with McAfee virus protec
tions and Internet security,
Music Match Jukebox, Quick
en 2002 and WordPerfect Of
fice 2002. Such a wide assort
ment is becoming exceeding
rare.
However, the Dell was also
the most expensive of the
three, which just shows that

you get what
you pay for.
Also, while
there were

two security
slots — one on

each side —
they were incon
venient to use be-

cause they were to
far near the front of
the machine.
As power and

portability are key fac
tors in determining the

: "'W right notebook, the lightweight
Fujitsu S2OOO promises to give you bang for your
buck.
Weighing in at 4.5 pounds, the S2OOO is packed with
a low-voltage AMD Athlon XP-M 1700+ processor,
512 MB of ram (expandable to 1 GB) and a3O GB hard
drive (40 and 60 GB are also available). Its 16 \IB A TI
Radeon graphics accelerator, which brings life to the
units 13.3-inch XGATFT display, is dedicated to make
your computing experience a visually pleasant one.
The S2ooo's bundled software includes Microsoft
Works, though serious users will ultimately seek
more sophisticated packages like Microsoft's Office
Suite.
As battery life is always an issue with portables, the
S2ooo's low battery life, has room for improvement.
Fujitsu gave the unit a 3.5 hour battery life, though the
"juice" on the one we tested lasted fora bit over two
hours on full charge while running common applica
tions. If you're planning on running processor-inten
sive applications, plan on having your power cord.
The unit's dual 1)VI) / CD-RW drive allows you to
watch DVDs and eliminate measly

floppies in one shot. You can save
your files to a CD-RW disk with ca
pacity up to 700 MB. The includ
ed DVD software allows you to
turn the S2OOO into a mini theatre
in a snap.

For those looking fora
light notebook PC that's quite
capable of meeting today's
software demands,

the S2OOO is
definitely

mf one to be
considered,
though low bat-

tery life may give some
second thoughts. Whether

the S2OOO will survive the recent Centrino craze re
mains to be seen.
All three systems have built-in Ethernet and
modem ports, and if you find yourself at Starbucks
on occasion, are Wi-Fi ready. Starbucks is among sev
eral retailers that recently announced Wi-Fi service
in their facilities.
Whether you need portability, power, or a combi
nation of the two, today's laptops have you covered.
