# Keeping your laptop safe
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
After spending hundreds of
dollars on a brand new laptop, the
last thing you're thinking about is
security. Yet, laptop theft is one of
the fastest growing crimes in the
U.S. Imagine having your entire
Stanford career wiped out —
every I-HUM paper, every CS
program lost.
Everyone needs to consider
laptop security, and Targus and
Kryptonite provide several inter
esting options.
In terms of basic, on-the-go se
curity, a good cable lock is best.
Both vendors provide key and
combination cable locks. These
lock into a security slot found on al
most every laptop sold. Targus also
has a video port cable lock that con
nects into the video port. 'Hie idea
behind this is that while breaking
off the security slot is feasible, try

ing to forcibly remove this lock will
result in significant damage to the
computer, rendering it useless to a
potential thief.
The Kryptonite cable was thicker
and seemed more of a deterrent,
though given enough time, a sea
soned thief can cut any cable. This is
why Kryptonite has the Vault Ijxk.
This device slips over the laptop and
secures it into place. It would be an
extraordinary challenge to attempt
to disable the unit once locked.
The Targus DEFCON motion
data protection card doesn't try to
lock down a computer. Rather, it
features a motion detector that
sounds an alarm and prevents ac
cess to the laptop's data when it en
counters unauthorized motion.
Whether you use a cable lock in
the library or airport, a Vault Lock
at home or in the office, or a mo
tion detector on the go, keep one
thing in mind: laptop security is a
must.
