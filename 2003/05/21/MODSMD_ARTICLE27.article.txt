# A 						Bug's Life:
## Unearthing the secret workings of ant colonies 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Ants. We see them streaming
through our gardens and our kitchens,
almost like an army or organism mov
ing as one. When we were younger we
watched intently as they built civiliza
tions and empires, forged for food and
claimed their territory.
Or at the very least, we played
Sim Ant.
How can these tiny creatures be so
smart, so organized? New research
from a Stanford biology lab attributes
ants' amazing organizational capabili
ties to their acute sense of smell, rather
than their brainpower.
When you see an army of ants, it's
hard to imagine that each individual is
involved in a very specific task that has
been assigned to them through smell
and chemical communication.
These findings were recently pub
lished in a study by Stanford biologists
Deborah Gordon and Mike Greene in
Nature magazine. Hie research stands
to change the way the scientific commu
nity analyzes the workings of ant
colonies.
Antennae play a prime role in the
communication process. Ants exchange
information by making contact with
each other's antennae and alternating
tasks accordingly.
"Ants communicate through trans
lating the chemical signatures present
on the other ant's antennae or cuticle
(outermost layer)," said Bob Schafer, an
undergraduate working in cooperation

with Gordon and Greene. "The inter
esting part is that these signatures can
identify what colony an ant is from, and
even what task it's currendy doing, like
foraging or patrolling."
The vast majority of an ant colony is
made up of worker ants, which do the
grunt work in making the colony work.
Worker ants are all born the same, but
can perform one of four tasks at any
given time, including patrolling, forag
ing, nest maintenance and garbage re
moval.
Forager ants are exclusively engaged
in collecting food and carrying it back to
the colony, whereas patroller ants start
off each morning and determine the lo
cation of food before foragers leave the
nest.
"It's tough to tell how an individual
ant knows exactly what task to perform
on any given day, but it looks like inter
actions between workers performing
these different tasks plays a big part,"
Schafer said.
"On a bigger scale, it's just what the
nest needs more of—for example, if
there's a lot of food one day, then more
workers will become foragers."
Ants use their antennae to detect and
react to chemical information from their
environment and from one another.
They can sense volatile chemicals in the
air, such as alarm pheromones that can
warn the colony of approaching danger.
Antennae can also be used to collect in
formation about other ants they come
into contact with.
"An ant can recognize a memlx'r of
its own species, or what particular task

another ant is performing based on
these chemical interactions," Greene
said. "The surface of an ant is covered by
a thin film of oils — like our own finger
prints — that are composed mainly of a
mixture of hydrocarbon molecules."
"The hydrocarbons on the ants differ
from each other in chain length, the
presence of double bonds and in the
presence of branches," he added.
When patrollers return to the nest,
they direct the foragers to the food
through chemical communication. II

no patroller ants return to the nest,
foragers will not emerge to collect
food.
There is no central force telling each
ant what to do in a harvester ant colony,
according to Greene. Instead, each
worker makes decisions about what ac
tivity to perform based on a set of simple
rules. These decisions are largely based
on the detection of local information
that somehow reflects the global needs

According to a new study by Stanford biologists Deborah Gordon and Mike Greene,
ants communicate through translating the chemical signatures of hydrocarbons pre
sent on other ants' antennae or cuticles.
of the colony. Overall these individual
decisions determine colony behavior.
A a unique hydrocarbon signature
determines whether an ant is a forager
or a patroller, and the abundance of
specific kinds of hydrocarbons varies
according to the task the ant is current
ly engaged in. During antennal contact,
ants sense these task-specific hydrocar
bon profiles, which they use to make de
cisions about what chore they should
do.
In their experiment, the team used
foragers and patrollers to collect infor
mation about their habits and interac
tions. They wanted to show that for
agers have the ability to recognize pa
troller-specific hydrocarbons, and that
the detection of these hydrocarbons is
what stimulates foragers to go to work.
"To start the experiment we collect
ed patrollers, which inhibited foraging
by the colony," Greene explained. "We
then added ant mimics to the nest —
small glass beads coated with patroller
hydrocarbons — to simulate the return
of patrollers to the nest."
When the patroller hydrocarbons
were reintroduced, forging activity was
resumed as if the patroller ants had re
turned from their expedition. Howev
er, the research found that forging was
not stimulated by uncoated beads or
those coated with hydrocarbons specif
ic to maintenance worker ants.
From this, the team concluded that a
sense of smell is vital in the daily opera
tions of an ant colony.
Gordon, Greene and Schafer con
ducted fieldwork on the Arizona-New
Mexico border in August last year on a
plot of land containing hundreds of red
harvester ant colonies.
Schafer followed individual foragers
to the food source, sometimes for up to
an hour, timing their searches and in
teractions with other workers.

"Using the data collected, I found
that interactions make the foragers will
ing to search for food fora longer peri
od of time before giving up," he said. "I
observed that they tend to drift away
from the nest as they search, and if you
put these two very simple behaviors to
gether, you get a network that can ex
pand."
Schafer conducted the second half
of his research on campus where he
created a computer simulation of a
day of foraging fora single colony. He
found that even though the daily rou
tines of ants are fairly simple and no
single ant knew what was happening
on a larger scale, the colony as a whole
is able to adapt to its environment.
"This illustrates how something as
complex as a network of foraging
ants, which can be very efficient, flex
ible, and apparently highly orga
nized, can emerge from a group of ex
tremely simple units with very limited
information," Schafer explained.
According to Greene, the results of
the experiment helped develop a so
phisticated understanding of the mech
anisms by which the complex system of
task assignment operates in harvester
ants. He drew parallels between the
harvester ant system and other com
plex systems, relating the lab's work to
research in neuroscience, computer sci
ence and artificial intelligence.
In computer networks, for example,
Greene said that instead of detailing ex
actly what's going on at. every point in
the network, you can get an efficient,
flexible network by giving each individ
ual computer a few basic rules on how
to respond and change functions ac
cording to information received," he
added.
Schafer said that the research might
even change the way people think
about information sharing within
human communities.
"In general, it's the idea that you
don't necessarily need to engineer pre
cisely from the top down in order to get
good results," he said.
