# Probing research, policy and ethics
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
What can be characterized as an intellec
tual quest, the Stanford Scientific Review is a
new magazine that seeks to probe science,
policy and ethics. The student-run journal
published its first issue less than a month ago.
Stanford Scientific Review Editor in Chief
Jonathan Olsen, a junior in human biology,
and Executive Editor Farzad Soleimani, a se
nior in chemistry' and health research policy,
spoke on their motivation in making what
was once conceptually based a reality.
"We saw a gap," Olsen said. "There was no
forum for students to relate ethics and policy
to science."
According to Olsen and Soleimani, the
publication has two goals: to serve as a forum
for discussion on topics that relate to ethical
and policy implication of recent scientific ad
vances, and to connect students with faculty
and research at Stanford.
"The magazine would not have been pos
sible without the network it was built on,"
Soleimani said. "This network enabled our
dedicated and talented writers to cross acad
emic boundaries and experience the excite
ments of scientific journalism."
The network consisted of faculty, under
graduate and graduate students from vari
ous disciplines across campus, including
chemistry, chemical engineering, biology
and the medical school.
Among the journal's goals are enabling
students and readers to come to grips on re
cent scientific breakthroughs and, if relevant,
any ethical issues that may underlie these
noteworthy achievements. Among the topics
covered in the first issue were the Gravity
Probe B Project, which seeks to probe the va
lidity of Einstein's theory of general relativity,
and the newly announced institute for cancer
and stem cell research at the medical school,
which was recently in the media spotlight.
"The stem cell debate had been misinter-

preted by the press," Olsen re
marked, adding that the story
in the Scientific Review gave
writers the opportunity to rec
tify common misconceptions
surrounding the issue.
Publication of the first
issue was a collaborative effort
between the editors, writers
and professors.
" lake an idea that you
have, express it in an article
that is scientifically accurate,
and explore the policy and
ethics components as well,"
Olsen said.
An article featuring Chem
istry Prof. Eric Kool ad
dressed overcoming obstacles
researchers face at the outset
of their academic career.
"1 thought the article was
well written, and I got a num
ber of favorable comments on
it from other faculty," Kool
said. "The journal had a pret
ty professional look fora new
publication."

"The profs were very willing to help with
the stories," Soleimani said. "This was veiy
encouraging and hopefully the beginning of
a long-lasting relationship between our staff
and the faculty."
Olsen indicated that the journal seeks to
highlight research and related topics that oc
casionally go unnoticed.
"We want to highlight research that is
overshadowed by big topics," Soleimani
agreed. "[The journal] provides an opportu
nity for esoteric topics to come to the surface."
Aside from the ethical and scientific as
pects of research, the journal focuses on the
humanitarian side
"I think it's important for scientists to real
ize that science is a humanitarian effort that
can fall short of its goals if it does not consider

the social, ethical and policy side," Olsen said.
For instance, famed scientist Linus Paul
ing's efforts in the field of chemistry were
complemented by his contributions to hu
manity, Olsen said. Pauling sought to raise
the public's awareness about the dangers in
volved in the testing of nuclear bombs.
"Linus Pauling was a humanitarian and a
scientist ... he won the Nobel Peace Prize
and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry," Olsen
added.
Publication of the journal was made possi
ble by the Bingham Fund for Student Inno
vation in Human Biology, the Dean of Stu
dents Office, the New Initiative Fund and the
ASSU Publications Board.
