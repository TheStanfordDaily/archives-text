### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL. STAFF 
The Cardinal's lone competitors in the
women's tennis NCAA Individual Singles
and Doubles Championships picked up vic
tories on Tuesday, moving them four
rounds from national titles.
In the singles competition, freshman
Amber Liu advanced to the round of 16 by
winning her second match in as many days,
a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Jessica Roland of
Texas A&M.
"I played a lot against her in juniors, so I
was kind of used to how she played," Liu
said. "I used the three-minute warmup be
fore the match to feel her out and see see
what balls she liked."
Liu, the No. 5 seed and Stanford's top sin
gles competitor throughout the season, fin
ished 17-6 in dual matches and was named
both the Pacific-10 Conference Freshman of
the Year and the ITA Rookie of the Year.
Kentucky's Sarah Witten, who knocked
off Sara Riske of Vanderbilt, 6-3,7-6 (3), now
awaits Liu in her third round match today at
the University of Florida campus in

Gainesville.
Although the contest will be the seventh
match that Liu has played in the past week in
temperatures that have reached the hun
dreds, the freshman does not anticipate fa
tigue.
"For the first week they suspend matches
after a team reaches four, so even though I
had some tough matches I had some
stopped early," Liu said.
"Also, playing at No. 1 has been really
helpful because I've learned to bounce back,
because if you don't you can get into a rut
and snowball into worse and worse situa
tions."
In the doubles competition, the Cardinal
duo of junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Erin Burdette — who were both elim
inated from the singles competition on Mon
day — won their opening round match, 6-3,
6-4 over Jennifer Tuchband and Henriette
Williams of Virginia.
The Pac-10 doubles team of the year
faced a challenge in the second set but was
able to break at 5-4 for the victory.
Next up for the Cardinal will be the
Miami doubles team of Melissa Applebaum
and Megan Bradley, who upset the No. 8
team of Julie Deßoo and Amanda Johnson
of Duke, 6-3, 6-4. If Barnikow and Burdette
can post another win today, they will enter
the quarterfinals and be three wins from the
championship.
