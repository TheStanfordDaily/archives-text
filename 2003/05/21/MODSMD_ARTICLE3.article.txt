# Panel considers Islamic reaction
## 
### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four academics discussed "The
Reaction in the Islamic World to
Iraq" last night at Tresidder in an
effort to understand and interpret
how Muslim nations have re
sponded to the American-led mili
tary intervention in Iraq.
"The expectations prior to the
war that there would be a massive
and consequential reaction from
the Muslim world, I would argue,
have not been met," said Institute
for International Studies Senior
Fellow Donald Emmerson.
Speaking primarily with re
spect to Indonesia, Emmerson
added, "The people who have op
posed the war have done so for di
verse reasons in response to local
agendas."
In light of polling in Southeast
Asian countries indicating that
overwhelming majorities are op
posed to the American presence in

Iraq, Emmerson outlined four
reasons why an overt anti-Ameri
can response has been limited.
These included the United
States' hegemony as a global su
perpower and the fact that coun
tries in this region are all develop
ing and interested in encouraging
foreign investments. Additionally,
the Muslim communities are di
verse, which inhibits a unified
Muslim response, and the fact that
the short war in Iraq was thou
sands of miles away limits how
pressing countries such as I Indone
sia perceive the American pres
ence in Iraq to be.
Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Jackie Armijo-Hussein spoke on
Islam in China and Chinese reac
tions to the war.
"There have been a few reports
in the Chinese press of Hans sup
porting the war, especially when
they saw the statues [of Saddam

A student talks at last night's panel on 'The Reaction in the Islamic World to
Iraq" in Tresidder. Four academics offered explanations for the lack of "mas
sive and consequential" reactions by Muslims to American action in Iraq.
Hussein] fallingâ€”it reminded
them very much of life under Mao,"
Armijo said. "On the other hand,
most Chinese people have seen this
as the Unites States doing some
thing unforgivable and unjust."
Hoover Fellow Abbas Milani
spoke about Iran's tenuous posi
tion in relation to American forces
in Iraq.
"Iran is now literally surround
ed by American forces," Milani
said. "At the same time, the Amer
icans, by attacking Iraq and
Afghanistan, were doing all the
work that Iran could have hoped
to have accomplished."

Milani argued that though Iran
has been pliant and cautious in its
dealings with the United States,
the government still retains the
ability to instigate a Shi'ite reaction
against the United States.
"I think they're hoping to trade
this ability to influence the Shi'ites
in Iraq for some sort of bargain
with the United States," Milani
said.
UC-Berkeley Near Eastern
Studies Prof. Hatem Bazian ad
dressed the dominant concerns in
Middle Eastern media and among
the peoples and governments of
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
other nations.
"There is still fundamental dis
cussion about the causes of the
war," Bazian said.
Bazian's concerns included

what happened during the war as
well as what kind of government
will be set in place, if the Americans
will betray any agreements with
groups and how much oil interests
will shape American actions.
Several dozen students and
community members attended
the talk and participated in the
subsequent question-and-answer
session.
"I was really impressed by the
speakers," said junior Ariege
Misherghi. "They presented and
made clear to us a lot of viewpoints
that weren't apparent."
