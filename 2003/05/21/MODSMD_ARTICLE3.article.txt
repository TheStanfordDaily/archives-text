# Panel considers Islamic reaction
## 
### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four academics discussed "The
Reaction in the Islamic World to
Iraq" last night at Tresidder in an
effort to understand and interpret
how Muslim nations have re
sponded to the American-led mili
tary intervention in Iraq.
"The expectations prior to the
war that there would be a massive
and consequential reaction from
the Muslim world, I would argue,
have not been met," said Institute
for International Studies Senior
Fellow Donald Emmerson.
Speaking primarily with re
spect to Indonesia, Emmerson
added, "The people who have op
posed the war have done so for di
verse reasons in response to local
agendas."
In light of polling in Southeast
Asian countries indicating that
overwhelming majorities are op
posed to the American presence in

Iraq, Emmerson outlined four
reasons why an overt anti-Ameri
can response has been limited.
These included the United
States' hegemony as a global su
perpower and the fact that coun
tries in this region are all develop
ing and interested in encouraging
foreign investments. Additionally,
the Muslim communities are di
verse, which inhibits a unified
Muslim response, and the fact that
the short war in Iraq was thou
sands of miles away limits how
pressing countries such as I Indone
sia perceive the American pres
ence in Iraq to be.
