## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
The alphabet soup of the Un
dergraduate Advising Center —
AAs, PAAs and HPACs — gath
ered together yesterday at this
year's advising recognition recep
tion to be honored for their com
mitment to undergraduate coun
seling.
Sitting in the expanse of the Ar
rillaga Alumni Center's McCaw
Hall, whose cream-colored walls
defy depth perception, adminis
trators welcomed the collection of

advisers and handed out awards
for long-standing service, out
standing performance and more.
"How many of us would be in
this room this afternoon if we
weren't convinced our dedication
pays dividends?" asked Chip
Goldstein, the interim director of
the UAC, in his welcoming speech.
Provost John Etchemendy, in
troduced by Goldstein as "the best
friend an adviser could have," de
livered the opening remarks.
"Students and faculty and staff
advisers play an incredible role
here at Stanford," he said. He went

on to jest about the UAC's fond
ness for acronyms.
"What you have before you is a
VAP: a very appreciative provost,"
Etchemendy said. After exchang
ing "very" fora variety of other ad
verbs, he added, "Just don't call me
a seriously appreciative provost."
Melissa Wong, a PAA from Rin
conada, won an award for Out
standing Peer Academic Adviser.
"It doesn't matter how many
questions my freshmen ask or how
much time they need," Wong said.
"As long as they use some part of
the information or perspectives

that I offer to realize their own per
sonal goals, I'm thrilled."
The reception focused on this
kind of selfless, dedicated attitude
that is pervasive among the hon
ored advising teams.
"This year I've gotten to know
an incredible group of freshmen,"
said Christina Jung, who took
home the Outstanding Advising
Team award along with her acade
mic adviser, Eugene Yang, "and
have had so much fun hanging out
with them, eating buckets of Cold-
stone ice cream with them, joking
about going to Yellowstone and
just helping them through their
freshman year."

The evening also honored Stan
ford's head peer academic coordi
nators, who live with their fresh
men year-round and provide aca
demic advice. Iman Ahmad was
recognized as the Outstanding
HPAC of the year.
"Looking back I'd say [the
freshmen] are the ones who really

made it worth it," she said.
Other honorees included
Laura Selznick, the associate di
rector of Undergraduate Re
search Programs, who has served
as an AA for 25 years. The Com
puter Science Department was
recognized for Outstanding De
partmental Major Advising.
