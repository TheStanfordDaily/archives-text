# Banquet fights global hunger
## 
### RAGHAV THAPAR 
Stanford students were exposed to the prob
lems of global hunger first-hand last night at the
third annual Oxfam hunger banquet.
"The goal of the banquet is to combine broad
goals of making people aware of hunger problems
and specific goals like making them aware of cer
tain organizations that can help," said senior
Avinash Kaza, co-director of the banquet for the
third consecutive year.
The banquet, hosted by SPOON, the Stanford
Project on Hunger, used a program from Oxfam,
one of the world's largest non-profit organizations
dedicated to reducing world hunger, to demon
strate the dire situation of world hunger.
As the 10 students who participated in the
event entered the Donald Kennedy room in the
Haas Center, they received a card describing the
living situation of a person in a low-, middle- or
high-income bracket and a flier
describing both the world's prob
lem with hunger and methods
students can use to help this
cause.
Meals were given out to repre
sent the proportion of the world's
population that each one of the
brackets represented. Fifty-five
percent of students were desig
nated to receive low-income
meals, 30 percent to receive mid
dle-income meals and 15 percent
of students were lucky enough to
have received high-income
meals. The food given to each

student was donated by the Tree
house and was representative of
what people in all three of these
income divisions eat on a daily
basis.
High-income students were
served a chicken burrito, rice,
beans, an assortment of drinks
and a granola bar for desert. Mid-t
die-income students, who repre
sented people who made approx
imately minimum wage, received
a plate of rice and beans and a
glass of water. Low-income stut
dents, who represented people
making about $2 a day, received a
scoop of rice.
To represent the living condi
tions of each strata, students in
the high-income bracket sat on
chairs with tables in front of them,

while students in the middle class
sat on chairs and students in the
low stratum ate on the floor.
After students were situated,
they read the living situations des
ignated by their cards. An exam
ple of a middle-income person
was a man who lived with his par
ents in a small apartment in Hong
Kong, hoping to become a lawyer.
A plantation worker in Haiti hop
ing to someday save enough to
buy his own farm was an example
of a low-income individual.
After students read their cards,
Kaza read off statistics about glob
al hunger and had students go
through a variety of scenarios that
showed how the fortunes of peo
ple in all income brackets are con
nected. A discussion between stu

dents ensued, touching upon is
sues such as U.S. farm policy,
world food policies, third-world
subsistence programs and even
food wasted in the Stanford din
ing halls.
Ka/a admitted that this year
had a "slightly lower turnout"
than usual, but was similar to past
years' events as it combined a
"mix of discussion and script."
SPOON hopes to expand the
hunger banquet to make more
students aware of global hunger
problems.
Sophomore Ziv Tepman, who
coordinated the event with
Kaza, said, "We hope to establish
connections with RAs so that we
can make the banquet part of
dorm programming."
