# Trails have a long, contentious history
## 
### EVAN BERGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two years of dispute, the
University and members of the
community remain entangled in a
battle over Stanford's proposed
construction of recreational trails
on its property â€” trails whose lo
cations Stanford and the commu
nity have not been able to agree
upon, but that Santa Clara County
insists must be constructed as part
of a land-use agreement.
Stanford agreed to build the two
trails in 2000 w hen it negotiated the
General Use Permit, a deal with
Santa Clara County allowing Stan
ford to develop nearly 5 million
square feet of its property.
Yet in the years since, neither trail
has been built. Stanford's proposed
eastern trail, named SI, remains
under consideration by the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors,
while the proposed western trail, Cl,
is the subject of both a lawsuit and
bitter opposition from community
and campus organizations.
The SI route is still undefined;
though it is supposed to follow
Matadero Creek and Page Mill
Road, it may eventually take a slight
ly different path if built. The C 1 trail,
known to some as Cl-C, hugs the
western boundaries of the campus,
proceeding alongside Alpine Road
past the golf course and running ad

jacent to San Francisquito Creek.
Local groups claim that CI is unsafe,
environmentally unsound and un
appealing for recreation.
Ginger Holt, a resident of Stan
ford Weekend Acres neighborhood,
said that the high volume of traffic at
Alpine Road makes the site of C> 1
dangerous and unsuited for leisure.
She described Alpine Road, which
accommodates as many as 31,000
cars per day, as so loud that "you
can't even talk to the person next to
you." I'he close proximity of the
path to the road would pose a safety
threat for runners and bicyclists, she
added.
Stanford and Santa Clara County
began negotiating the GUP in 1998,
when the University's endowment
was considerably larger and the
sch<x)l aimed to expand. At the time,
Stanford planned to build 3,000
housing units and various spoiling
and academic facilities.
Its previous agreement with
Santa Clara County had expired,
though, and Stanford once more
needed the county's approval to de
velop. After two years of tense de
bate, the county gave Stanford per
mission to expand in exchange for
101 conditions, including a guaran
tee that Stanford would not build on
the Foothills for 25 years and that it
would construct the CI and SI trails

Because of budget constraints,
Stanford never began building its
planned facilities. As Director of
Community Relations Andy Coe
said, "Stanford has developed mini
mally on the GUP, mainly because
the economy slowed down and se
curing financing became much
tougher."
Even so, the University was still
bound to dedicate two trails by the
end of 2001. When Stanford an
nounced the location of the pro
posed trails in 2001, it was met with
backlash from community members
and a harshly critical editorial in the
San Jose Mercury News. To many,
Stanford's proposed paths seemed
unfit and peculiar; one of the trails,
the CI, even strayed into San Mateo
County.
But Stanford's proposed routes
met the conditions it had agreed to
in 2000. The GUP stipulates that CI
be a "connector route [that]... gen
erally follows the creeks and Alpine
Road;" Stanford's proposal is consis
tent with those guidelines and is
nearly identical to the route that the
county mapped out in the GUP.
Larry Morton, associate vice pres
ident and director of government
and community relations, defends
Stanford's proposal, emphasizing
that the University followed the
county's demands and that the
Parks Department has deemed the
paths suitable.
An assortment of groups repre

senting neighbors, environmental
ists and Stanford students oppose
the University's routes and have pre
sented a number of alternative possi
bilities.
In September 2(M)2, Stanford re
jected requests by community mem
bers to reconsider the trails and an
nounced that it would continue with
its plans. By April 2003, 13 commu
nity and campus groups endorsed
an alternate trail, called Cl-B. The
alternate route moves slightly east of
CI, passing through the cow tunnel
under 280 and running by the east
ern side of the golf course.
Sophomore Tim Telleen-Law
ton, president of the Stanford Green
Party, said that the community-en
dorsed trail is far less ecologically
damaging than Stanford's CI. C 1 -B,
he said, prevents the removal of 40
old oaks, protects the fragile ecosys
tem of San Francisquito Creek and
keeps trailgoers away from danger
ous intersections. Telleen-Lawton
said that the Greens are "glad to
show our support on the issue,"
adding, "it's important to show that
not all people on campus agree with
Stanford's stance on the trails."
Stanford has deemed Cl-B unac
ceptable because it veers from the
campus's periphery.
"We would never have accepted a
trail that went through the interior
of our land," Horton said, "because
it would limit forever the ability of
the University to build to its needs."
But any trail on the periphery of
Stanford's land will have limited
recreational value, opponents
argue.
Peter Drekmeier, director of the
Stanford Open Space Alliance, a

local group, argues that Stanford's
Cl-C would be neither sale nor fun.
Trail goers "would be sucking in
fumes from Alpine Road," he said.
John Nagle, Class of 1985, said
that Cl-C would be nothing but "a
paved bike path that won't get used
much." Holt echoed these com
ments, lamenting, "This is supposed
to be a gilt back to the community,"
but that the unappealing roadside
trail will bring far more harm than
good.
The issue is likely to remain con
tentious for some time. The C 1 trail
remains tied up in litigation, while
the S1 is awaiting a supplemental en
vironmental impact review by the
Santa Clara Board of Supervisors, a
process that will take more than 18
months.
To some it is a dead issue, be
cause, as Nagle said, "Stanford
doesn't have the money to build in
the Foothills anymore."
But the matter remains impor
tant to Stanford and the community.
Horton, who calls Stanford "the best
stewards of land in Santa Clara
County," believes it is crucial for
everyone to understand that the
University "is keeping the pledges it
made to the community."
At the same time, the issue of
open space has become more con
tentious than ever in densely popu
lated Santa Clara County.
Telleen-Lawton said, "To the
community [the Foothills] become a
special resource because Stanford
owns the county's only open space."
For this reason, he continued, the
community has a special interest in
making sure that Stanford lives up to
its promises.
