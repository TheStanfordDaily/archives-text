# Trails have a long, contentious history
## 
### EVAN BERGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two years of dispute, the
University and members of the
community remain entangled in a
battle over Stanford's proposed
construction of recreational trails
on its property â€” trails whose lo
cations Stanford and the commu
nity have not been able to agree
upon, but that Santa Clara County
insists must be constructed as part
of a land-use agreement.
Stanford agreed to build the two
trails in 2000 w hen it negotiated the
General Use Permit, a deal with
Santa Clara County allowing Stan
ford to develop nearly 5 million
square feet of its property.
Yet in the years since, neither trail
has been built. Stanford's proposed
eastern trail, named SI, remains
under consideration by the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors,
while the proposed western trail, Cl,
is the subject of both a lawsuit and
bitter opposition from community
and campus organizations.
The SI route is still undefined;
though it is supposed to follow
Matadero Creek and Page Mill
Road, it may eventually take a slight
ly different path if built. The C 1 trail,
known to some as Cl-C, hugs the
western boundaries of the campus,
proceeding alongside Alpine Road
past the golf course and running ad

jacent to San Francisquito Creek.
Local groups claim that CI is unsafe,
environmentally unsound and un
appealing for recreation.
Ginger Holt, a resident of Stan
ford Weekend Acres neighborhood,
said that the high volume of traffic at
Alpine Road makes the site of C> 1
dangerous and unsuited for leisure.
She described Alpine Road, which
accommodates as many as 31,000
cars per day, as so loud that "you
can't even talk to the person next to
you." I'he close proximity of the
path to the road would pose a safety
threat for runners and bicyclists, she
added.
Stanford and Santa Clara County
began negotiating the GUP in 1998,
when the University's endowment
was considerably larger and the
sch<x)l aimed to expand. At the time,
Stanford planned to build 3,000
housing units and various spoiling
and academic facilities.
Its previous agreement with
Santa Clara County had expired,
though, and Stanford once more
needed the county's approval to de
velop. After two years of tense de
bate, the county gave Stanford per
mission to expand in exchange for
101 conditions, including a guaran
tee that Stanford would not build on
the Foothills for 25 years and that it
would construct the CI and SI trails
