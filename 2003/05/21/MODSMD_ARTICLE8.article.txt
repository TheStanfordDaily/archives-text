### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Last night's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting was replete with discus
sion regarding internal Senate policies
as well as plans for future Senate pro
jects.
The Senate addressed how to ap
proach issues of making changes to the
constitution, ex-officio members of the
Senate, University policies that need or
should undergo review and how to in
crease communication between the Sen
ate and the student body. Particular at
tention was paid to increasing the partic -

ipation of new students.
The Senate passed the Nominations
Committee's final bill for the spr ing cycle,
approving its nominations for the Board
of Trustees committees.
Also discussed was the upcoming
deadline for applications for early discre
tionary funding. This funding provides
money lor groups in the first five weeks
of fall quarter, partially to alleviate the
burden of dealing with a Hood of student
groups seeking funds at the beginning of
the school year and also because the
money dispensed by the Senate must first
be collected from the student body at the
beginning of the year through ASSU

fees. The deadline to apply for early dis
cretionary funding is tomorrow.
Former ASSLI President Monica
Henestroza brought to the Senate's at
tention that there are three open forums
in the next week, one with each of the
three remaining candidates for the dean
of students position recently vacated by
Marc Wais. These forums will be held in
El Centro Chicano and will take place
today, May 28 and May 30 from 1:30 to
