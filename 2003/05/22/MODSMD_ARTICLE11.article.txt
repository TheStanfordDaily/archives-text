The headline "600 protest Is
raeli invasion" on yesterday's
World and Nation page should
have rellected the unusual news
event in the story. The Palestini
ans who demonstrated were not
protesting Israel; instead they di
rected their anger at Palestinian
militants who they said had caused
Israel to destroy houses and up
root fruit and nut trees.
