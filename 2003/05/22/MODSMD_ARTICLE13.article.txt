## Explosive goes off at Yale law school 
### 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) —An
explosive device went off in an empty
classroom at the Yale University law
school yesterday, sending debris flying
and students scrambling for safety. No
injuries were reported and the damage
was minor.
"We understand there was a device
and it went off," Yale spokeswoman
Karen Peart said. Authorities said it
might take two or three days to find out
what type of device was used.
The law school also houses a day
care and some residences, but it was
not clear whether any children or resi
dents were inside at the time. The law
school is holding final exams through
tomorrow, and officials said tests were
given in the building earlier yesterday.
There were no initial indications
that an international terrorist organi
zation set off the device, according to
two U.S. officials who are familiar with
intelligence information. They spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
"We have not received any threats
prior to the incident today, and we've
received no claims of responsibility,"
said Michael J. Wolf, special agent in
charge of the EBI in Connecticut.
Acting Police Chief Francisco Ortiz
said the explosion was being treated as
a criminal matter, but no possibility
had been ruled out. He said damage
was limited to the ceiling and a parti
tion in the classroom.
Some students who were in the
building when the device went off said
they were being called for questioning
by the FBI yesterday night. Explosive
sniffing dogs were being used to check
the law school and other buildings, the
New Haven Register reported.
The explosion happened about 5
p.m., sending smoke rising above

downtown New Haven.
"I saw a huge fireball come out to
the middle of the hallway," said law stu
dent Bob Hoo, who was on the ground
floor of the law school. "It was there
and then it was gone."
The university said the law school
will be closed today and tomorrow and
its commencement, scheduled for
Monday, will likely be moved to anoth
er building.

The incident came one day alter the
government raised the alert level for
possible terrorist attacks and several
hours after President Bush spoke at the
Coast Guard Academy graduation cer
emony in New London, 50 miles away
east of New Haven.
Yale is Bush's alma mater and one of
his daughters, Barbara, is finishing her
junior year at the university. Secret
Service spokesman John Gill said the ,

younger Bush "was not in danger at
any time, and she was not in the vicini
ty" of the blast.
In 1993, a bomb exploded in the
Yale office of professor David Gelern
ter, seriously injuring him. Un
abomber Theodore Kaczynski was
later sentenced to prison for that at
tack and others that killed three peo
ple and injured more than 20 from
1978 to 1995.
