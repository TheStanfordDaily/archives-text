# At least 509 reported dead:
## Quake strikes Algerian capital 
### 
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) â€” A powerful earthquake
shook (he Algerian capital region yesterday night,
killing at least 509 people and injuring more than
4,700, the state-run news agency said.
The report quoted the Interior Ministry.
Rescuers feared families were buried in the wreckage
as apartment building walls collapsed, trees crushed
cars and weeping survivors walked amid debris.
"This is a misfortune that has struck the Al
gerian people," Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia
said on television.
The Interior Ministry was quoted by the APS news
agency as saying the death toll could rise as rescuers
find more buried in rubble.
It said 4,737 were injured.
The quake was deadliest in towns in the vicinity of
Thenia, near the epicenter. Thenia is about 40 miles east
of Algiers, the capital of this North African nation.
The prime minister said whole families may be
buried under collapsed homes and so the initial death
toll may be "unfortunately partial."
The quake hit about 7:45 p.m., cutting electricity in
some neighborhoods of Algiers and causing panic
throughout the city. About 10 aftershocks rippled
through the area in the hours that followed.
The U.S. Geological Survey, which monitors
quakes around the world, said the temblor had a pre
liminary magnitude of 6.7. Algerian officials put it
much lower at 5.2.
The state-run APS agency said most of the deaths
occurred near the epicenter, including 261 in
Boumerdes, about six miles from the epicenter.
Numerous towns throughout the Boumerdes dis
trict were hard hit by the quake, and residents of the
region were swarming to area hospitals with injuries
or to seek news of loved ones.
In Algiers, several building collapsed. People
thronged the streets, preferring to be outdoors for
fear of another temblor.
