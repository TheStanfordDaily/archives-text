## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Excessive security 
### 
This past weekend, hundreds of
Stanford students — both from
the graduate and undergraduate
classes — attended one of the
campus' most notorious and popular par
ties: Exotic Erotic. This party is not the av
erage Stanford event — widely attended,
the dress code is minimal, in the most liter
al sense. The University was very cautious
regarding the organization and details of
the night, calling for appropriate security
measures to be made ahead of time. The
party organizers were asked to hire several
security guards in advance and to organize
wristband lists in order to control access. Al
cohol consumption was carefully enforced
by the bartenders and students checked
IDs before filling each red cup with foamy
beer. Yet despite all of these cautionary
measures, students found themselves con
fronted by police officers throughout the
night, from a police car parked in front of
680 Lomita restricting driving access, to
the videotaping of half-dressed students
standing in line. Exotic Erotic is certainly a

party that requires extra attention, yet we
believe that the police officers' presence
and actions this year were superfluous —
and to many — offensive.
Due to the very nature of the party,
where students are scantily-clad, many felt
very uncomfortable at the police officers'
use of video cameras. .Although ensuring
the security of the party revelers is impor
tant, we wonder whether this type of secu
rity measure was really necessary. More
over, because there were already several se
curity measures and guards in place, we
believe that the presence of so many police
officers at a well-planned and managed
party on Saturday night is not the best use
of taxpayers' money. There are surely
more pressing needs that police officers
should attend to on a Saturday night —
and if not, then perhaps fewer officers need
to be on the job on weekend nights. Stan
ford is not a university particularly known
for wild and uncontrollable parties and
more acrimonious use of police force and
time would be more fitting.
