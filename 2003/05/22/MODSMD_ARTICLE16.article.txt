# Health care subsidies
## 
### 
When the economy of the Unit
ed States takes a dive, every
sector and individual is af
fected in some way. Not only
has Stanford's budget been strained by
the recent downturn, but student budgets
have been affected as well, particularly
those of graduate students, who depend
largely on University stipends and the
University's comprehensive health insur
ance plan, Cardinal Care, to meet living
and medical costs.
Amid particular concerns over the rising
price of medical care throughout the na
tion, University administrators have met
with leaders of the graduate student com
munity to discuss mitigating the impact of
rising health care costs on new Cardinal
Care premiums for 2003-2004.
This week, the University released the
results: on average, students using Cardinal
Care — about 77 percent of the graduate
community and 38 percent of undergradu
ates — will face a 17.4 percent increase
from this year in the cost of their premiums'.
Continuing the subsidy program began
this year, the University will also subsidize
insurance costs for graduate students re
ceiving at least $ 1,000 stipend each quarter.

While subsidies for students are based on
a percentage of health care costs, which
may be up to 50 percent, subsidies for
their dependents and spouses will stay set
at the monthly rates determined this year.
As a result, those students with families
will be hardest hit —on average, these
families will experience a 21 percent in
crease in overall costs.
Although the University does not set
up the premiums — they are estab
lished by the health care provider with
whom Stanford negotiates — the in
crease in premiums to these students
and their families is concerning. In re
quiring its students to have health insur
ance the University bears a responsibili
ty to offer an affordable, reasonable
plan. Health insurance subsidies should
be among the last expenditures in the
cuts; especially amid current tight eco
nomic times. To be sure, such a policy
may be difficult to implement in light of
skyrocketing medical costs — many pri
vate companies will be increasing their
premiums by over 20 percent this year
— but the University ought to continue
to recognize and accept the financial sit
uation of the students nonetheless.
