Ethical concerns also apply to
sperm donation
Reading Monday's editorial criticizing
egg donation, "Commodifying human
life" (May 19), I was surprised to find no
references whatsoever to sperm dona
tion. After all, both practices involve the
sale of reproductive cells for the purpose
of creating a child. Does The Daily edito
rial board believe that these ethical ques
tions apply only to women? Sperm dona
tion also involves donor screening for de
sirable and undesirable traits; when my
mother's lesbian friend decided to have a
baby, she was given a catalog of potential
donors to choose from, all of whom had to
go through a rigorous screening process.
She chose a tall, athletic, blond, blue-eyed
medical student.
As for the contention that egg dona
tion should be like blood or organ dona
tion, with no compensation for the
donor and distribution based on need,
am I the only one who found this idea
laughable? Donated blood and organs
are needed to save lives; donor eggs are
only one way of having a child. As much
as the Daily editorial board may hate to
admit it, lifestyle choices like this are —

and should be — dependent on one's
ability to pay.

Far be it for me to quibble over seman
tics, but I found one of the stylistic decisions
in "Police Boost role at Exotic Erotic" (May
20) to be personally offensive. In what was
generally a well-written and informative
story, the author's superfluous introduction
of mots e.tranges made me pine for my early
days of illiteracy.
I am referring to the second paragraph,
which reads: "Police allege that lax security
at the event necessitated their presence.
House staff claim that the police actually
made the fete less safe due to their lack of fa
miliarity with the event's party plan."
I see no reason why the word "party"
wouldn't have worked in place of the French
term "fete." The context does not call fora
synonym, nor does the word "fete" serve the
purpose of some ill-conceived consonance.
