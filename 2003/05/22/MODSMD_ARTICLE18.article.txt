# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Double bourbon jolt 
### 
Dear God (or equivalent
metaphysical power of
choice), I'm in need of
your help because I feel
the world is turning cold around
me and all I can do is live an amaz
ingly pleasant existence.
Across the globe fellow human
beings are so busy killing each
other that I can barely keep up
with the news. "Did you hear
about the suicide bombing in Is
rael?" a friend asked me today.
"Yeah, nine people died," I re
sponded.
"No, no, not the fourth one this
weekend, where that pregnant
mother was murdered . . . I'm
talking about the fifth one, which
took place at a mall. Hey, while
we're counting, wasn't there one in
Saudi Arabia, too? No wait — was
that Bali? No, 1 think it was in
Kuwait? No, maybe it was Spain?
Morocco?"
I'm all confused; I guess I
should just stop wondering about
such things and try to get really
drunk at that frat party tonight.
You see, it seems difficult to feel
part of the world when I'm sleep
ing surrounded by the radiant
beauty of Stanford's palm trees
under a warm California sun. 1
need your help to get myself and
some of my friends motivated to
engage issues larger than campus
trails.
It's been said again and again,
but perhaps this echoes of some
deep truth we all fail to admit: all
we can think about is ourselves.
Money: how much? Cars: which
edition? Midterms: what grade
d'ya get? Bragging rights, ego
boosters and self-directed praise.
There's so much thought about
ourselves it's a wonder we ever get
around to making friends. Then
again, maybe we're just doing that
for networking.

But some of us have made it,
I'm telling ya. Last weekend I had
lunch with John Hatch, the
founder of FINCA microlinance,
down in L.A.
"How'd ya do it, John? How'd
you create the second largest de
velopment lending institute in the
world? What was your first year

like?"
He laughed. "I
was sitting on a
plane, finishing a
double-bourbon,
when a lightening
bolt from God hit
me. It was then
that I came up
with the concept I

needed to create FINCA. It was
then that my life began."
And boy, did his life begin!
Thirty years, a couple billion dol
lars and operations in over 32
countries later, old Johnny was sit
ting here looking at me, a naive
college kid soaking up his every
word on a cool L.A. afternoon.
God — why can't you light
ning-bolt me and a couple of
friends, for heaven's sake? Give us
a wake up call. All we talk about is
Goldman Sachs and Porsches.
Meanwhile, over 3 billion people
in the world live on less than $2
per day.
You know exactly what I'm
talking about.
VVe fly down to Gabo, Hawaii,
Cancun (or fill in the blank) with
our significant others or family
and reflect upon the beauty of life;
just blocks away from the walls that
keep us happy and safe are the
shanty towns whose inhabitants
service our holiday needs and con
veniences with a smile and nod.
This type of inequality' holds
true around the world. When a
flight I was on last year ended up
stranding me and some friends in

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia lor a week,
I realized what $2 a (lay leels like. 1
saw $2 a clay in the piss, blood and
sweat of a malnourished nation in
dire need of international aid that
always seemed to arrive too little
and too late.
I saw flies, AIDs, tents in streets
and outdoor Ilea markets where
villagers threw their bodies in
front of taxis in hopes of a dime of
charity. And where were the
Americans? Safely nestled within
the 20-foot high walls of a five star
Hilton, rubbing elbows with State
Department diplomats and the
press, all while on the personal tab
of Uncle Sam, who so graciously
apologized for having stranded us
here in this "God forsaken land."
So God, why have you taken so
much away from so many, yet left
me here in the sunshine? When's
my lightning bolt going to arrive?
What will it take for me to look be
yond JobTrak, northern (Califor
nia's warm sun and the sports page
and begin to confront some of the
issues in this world? Wasn't Sept.
II enough? When will I become a
global citizen, one who doesn't
maximize personal assets, but
rather personal empathy? How
many more news stories will it take
for me to realize that I could have
just as easily been born into misery
as I did into plenty?
When, for your sake, will I use
the resources I've acquired at
Stanford for something other than
cocktail parties and professional
connections?
Here's what I think:
Watching a rape occur and re
maining silent is against the law.
Knowing that a crime is happen
ing and not reporting it is similar
ly reprehensible. Many of us will
eventually possess the money and


Uri Pomerantz

resources to ailect far more people
than our immediate families. Not
doing so — knowing that others
will suifer — should indeed he
considered criminal.
It should he a crime to remain
idle to pivotal world issues when
you have the resources to ailect
change. Anyone who attends Stan
ford needs to devote at least a por
tion of their lives toward affecting
the world, whether it's making
your voice heard to colleagues at
your future company or creating
organizations with the intent pur
pose of bettering lives.
Throw out the hippie crap:
I'm not talking about human
shields, llower chains or mid
night poetry jam sessions against
war. I'm talking about tangible
change using techniques that
you've learned in school. I'm
urging you to use your resources
— both money and time —to
make a positive impact in some
part of the world. It doesn't need
to be international; it can be as
close as East Palo Alto.
Remember the double bour
bon and the lightning-bolt. Re
member that you could have been
born into a life of $2 a day. For
heaven's sake, remember to do
something meaningful and to do it
today.

Need a wake up call? E-mail me, I got
plenty: pomerantz@stanford.edu.

doing so — knowing that others
will suifer — should indeed he
considered criminal.
It should he a crime to remain
idle to pivotal world issues when
you have the resources to ailect
change. Anyone who attends Stan
ford needs to devote at least a por
tion of their lives toward affecting
the world, whether it's making
your voice heard to colleagues at
your future company or creating
organizations with the intent pur
pose of bettering lives.
Throw out the hippie crap:
I'm not talking about human
shields, llower chains or mid
night poetry jam sessions against
war. I'm talking about tangible
change using techniques that
you've learned in school. I'm
urging you to use your resources
— both money and time —to
make a positive impact in some
part of the world. It doesn't need
to be international; it can be as
close as East Palo Alto.
Remember the double bour
bon and the lightning-bolt. Re
member that you could have been
born into a life of $2 a day. For
heaven's sake, remember to do
something meaningful and to do it
today.

Need a wake up call? E-mail me, I got
plenty: pomerantz@stanford.edu.
Dear God (or equivalent
metaphysical power of
choice), I'm in need of
your help because I feel
the world is turning cold around
me and all I can do is live an amaz
ingly pleasant existence.
Across the globe fellow human
beings are so busy killing each
other that I can barely keep up
with the news. "Did you hear
about the suicide bombing in Is
rael?" a friend asked me today.
"Yeah, nine people died," I re
sponded.
"No, no, not the fourth one this
weekend, where that pregnant
mother was murdered . . . I'm
talking about the fifth one, which
took place at a mall. Hey, while
we're counting, wasn't there one in
Saudi Arabia, too? No wait — was
that Bali? No, 1 think it was in
Kuwait? No, maybe it was Spain?
Morocco?"
I'm all confused; I guess I
should just stop wondering about
such things and try to get really
drunk at that frat party tonight.
You see, it seems difficult to feel
part of the world when I'm sleep
ing surrounded by the radiant
beauty of Stanford's palm trees
under a warm California sun. 1
need your help to get myself and
some of my friends motivated to
engage issues larger than campus
trails.
It's been said again and again,
but perhaps this echoes of some
deep truth we all fail to admit: all
we can think about is ourselves.
Money: how much? Cars: which
edition? Midterms: what grade
d'ya get? Bragging rights, ego
boosters and self-directed praise.
There's so much thought about
ourselves it's a wonder we ever get
around to making friends. Then
again, maybe we're just doing that
for networking.

But some of us have made it,
I'm telling ya. Last weekend I had
lunch with John Hatch, the
founder of FINCA microlinance,
down in L.A.
"How'd ya do it, John? How'd
you create the second largest de
velopment lending institute in the
world? What was your first year

like?"
He laughed. "I
was sitting on a
plane, finishing a
double-bourbon,
when a lightening
bolt from God hit
me. It was then
that I came up
with the concept I

needed to create FINCA. It was
then that my life began."
And boy, did his life begin!
Thirty years, a couple billion dol
lars and operations in over 32
countries later, old Johnny was sit
ting here looking at me, a naive
college kid soaking up his every
word on a cool L.A. afternoon.
God — why can't you light
ning-bolt me and a couple of
friends, for heaven's sake? Give us
a wake up call. All we talk about is
Goldman Sachs and Porsches.
Meanwhile, over 3 billion people
in the world live on less than $2
per day.
You know exactly what I'm
talking about.
VVe fly down to Gabo, Hawaii,
Cancun (or fill in the blank) with
our significant others or family
and reflect upon the beauty of life;
just blocks away from the walls that
keep us happy and safe are the
shanty towns whose inhabitants
service our holiday needs and con
veniences with a smile and nod.
This type of inequality' holds
true around the world. When a
flight I was on last year ended up
stranding me and some friends in

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia lor a week,
I realized what $2 a (lay leels like. 1
saw $2 a clay in the piss, blood and
sweat of a malnourished nation in
dire need of international aid that
always seemed to arrive too little
and too late.
I saw flies, AIDs, tents in streets
and outdoor Ilea markets where
villagers threw their bodies in
front of taxis in hopes of a dime of
charity. And where were the
Americans? Safely nestled within
the 20-foot high walls of a five star
Hilton, rubbing elbows with State
Department diplomats and the
press, all while on the personal tab
of Uncle Sam, who so graciously
apologized for having stranded us
here in this "God forsaken land."
So God, why have you taken so
much away from so many, yet left
me here in the sunshine? When's
my lightning bolt going to arrive?
What will it take for me to look be
yond JobTrak, northern (Califor
nia's warm sun and the sports page
and begin to confront some of the
issues in this world? Wasn't Sept.
II enough? When will I become a
global citizen, one who doesn't
maximize personal assets, but
rather personal empathy? How
many more news stories will it take
for me to realize that I could have
just as easily been born into misery
as I did into plenty?
When, for your sake, will I use
the resources I've acquired at
Stanford for something other than
cocktail parties and professional
connections?
Here's what I think:
Watching a rape occur and re
maining silent is against the law.
Knowing that a crime is happen
ing and not reporting it is similar
ly reprehensible. Many of us will
eventually possess the money and

resources to ailect far more people
than our immediate families. Not
doing so — knowing that others
will suifer — should indeed he
