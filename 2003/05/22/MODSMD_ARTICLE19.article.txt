# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Relay for Life to fight cancer 
### MYKEL KOCHENDERFER GUEST COLUMNIST 
Before coming to Stanford, my dad
was diagnosed with melanoma cancer. I le
has been struggling with this difficult con
dition these past five years. He has under
gone countless surgeries, chemotherapy,
radiation, vaccine therapy and various
other treatments. It has been a very dilli
cult time for my family, making it chal
lenging sometimes to concentrate on my
work at Stanford.
I know that others in the Stanford
community have been deeply affected by
cancer. The first girl who I talked to at
Stanford, who I later married, had kidney
cancer as a child. She had one of her kid
neys removed and underwent
chemotherapy. Fortunately, her hair
grew back in its beautiful curly fashion
and today she is left only with memories of
doctor visit sand a foot-long scar.
We lost one of our beloved Kimball
Hall dormmates, known for his kindness
and music, to bone cancer a couple years

ago. Countless other Stanford students,
faculty and staff have also been personally
affected by cancer, either directly or indi
rectly. Cancer is one of the few things that
does not discriminate.
Last year, my wife and I decided to
found Colleges Against Cancer, a volun
tary student organization with the mission
to light cancer through awareness, advo
cacy, service and research. A committee of
a dozen students organized the Relay For
Life held at Gunn High School. (Of
course, UC-Berkeley had to copy us, and
so they held their own relay in Edwards
Stadium!) This year, a stellar committee
of 25 students has been organizing the
Relay For Life to be held in Stanford Sta
dium this Friday and Saturday, from 6
p.m. to 12 p.m., which is free and open to
the entire University population and sur
rounding community.
The Relay For Life consists of many
different aspects rolled into one. It is an
opportunity to promote health'and edu
cate the community about cancer issues
â€” such as prevention, early detection,

treatment and ongoing research. It is also
a time when we can honor those who are
fighting cancer and remember those who
we have lost to cancer. Any money raised
during the relay goes to benefit the Amer
ican Cancer Society, the most experi
enced cancer control organization in the
world and the largest private nonprofit
source of funding for scientists studying
cancer. The Relay For Life is also de
signed to be fun, with various forms of en
tertainment and activities, including per
formances by Stanford a cappella groups,
bands and dance troupes. Teams camp
out overnight in tents on Foster Field in
the Stanford Stadium.
We have over 40 committed teams
composed of Stanford undergraduate
and graduate residences, fraternities and
sororities, local high schools, faculty and
staff, oncologists and surgeons, athletic
teams, student groups, survivors, and
community members. These teams have
been involved in finding sponsors and
