## Softball season a success 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the graduation of the most success
ful class to pass through the Cardinal softball
program at the end of last season and the ar
rival of some highly-touted but unproven re
cruits, neither the fans nor the Stanford play
ers knew what to expect at the start of this
season.
Stanford didn't miss a beat. After a gruel
ing 65-game regular season of games and
tournaments, all of which revealed a little
more about the make-up of this year's team,
the No. 17 Cardinal (41-26, 7-14 Pacific-10
Conference) headed into the postseason
having reached the 40-win mark for the sixth
straight season.
Following an opening round win over
UT-Chattanooga as the No. 2 seed at the re
gional tournament in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the
Cardinal's tournament-run ended prema
turely after two consecutive losses to South
ern Illinois and Ceorgia Tech.
The 2003 season was full of highlights, in
cluding a win over No. 1 Arizona, but the
Cardinal had hopes of getting back to the
Women's College World Series as it did for
the first time in 2001.
"We are disappointed that we didn't go
farther than we did, but I am still proud of
the way we competed this year even if we
didn't meet all of our goals," said senior sec
ond baseman Cassi Brangham.
What defined this year's squad was a de
termination to keep fighting and a confi
dence that it could win no matter who was in
the other dugout.
"I'm proud of the way that we had a lot of
newcomers and we had some injuries that we
had to deal with and we still felt at the end of
the season that we could beat any team in the
nation," Brangham said. "I think we could
have thrown in the towel a lot of times this
season, but we didn't. We kept on fighting."
The Pac-10 conference committee recog
nized the fight in the Cardinal — naming
eight of its players to the First, Second and
Honorable Mention All-Conference teams.
Four Stanford seniors, Brangham, pitch
er Tori Nyberg, first baseman Maureen

LeCocq, and second baseman Kira Ching,
led the young team after experiencing three
seasons in the relentless Pac-10 and four
trips to the postseason.
Brangham, Nyberg and Ching were all
given a nod by the Pac-10 committee as Hon
orable Mentions in their final seasons on the
Farm.
While junior Dana Sorensen was named
to the First Team for the second time in her
career, freshmen centerfielder Catalina
Morris and shortstop Lauren Lappin were
both awarded spots on the Second Team.
Sorensen finished the regular season with
a 20-10 record, bringing her career victory
total to 70 wins — tied with former Cardinal
Becky Blevins for the most in school history.
Sorensen also posted a 1.13 ERA and record
ed 312 strikeouts.
Lappin, who had 18 multiple-hit games,
led the team with a .339 batting average and
58 hits. She also tallied 31 runs, eight dou
bles, two homeruns and 15 RBIs.
Fellow freshman phenom Morris led the
squad with 38 runs scored, 92 total bases and
11 stolen bases. She batted .335 with 10 dou
bles, seven homeruns and 27 RBIs.
Morris also shined with the glove, com
mitting just two errors in center field fora
.960 fielding percentage.
Junior catcher Jessica Allister and sopho
more third baseman Elizabeth Bendig also
garnered Honorable Mention accolades.
Although the Cardinal finished tied for
sixth in the eight-team Pac-10 conference,
eight of its conference losses were one-run
decisions to No. 1 Arizona, No. 2 UCLA or
No. 9 California. All three teams are current
ly in the Women's College World Series.
"It makes you wonder, 'what if that bloop
er dropped or that ball was called a strike?'"
said coach John Rittman. "The good news is
we are right in those games but the bad news
is that we need to learn how to win those
games."
But the Cardinal are still letting this sea
son sink in before turning the focus to next
season.
"We are still kind of reflecting on this
