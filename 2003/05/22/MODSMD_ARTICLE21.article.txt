# Rocket still has Red Sox fans burning with ire
## 
### 
Ah, I've been waiting weeks for
this fortnight of the baseball sea
son.
Red Sox vs. Yankees.
Good vs. Evil.
Right vs. Wrong.
The two teams tied for first place in
the A.L. East wrapped up the first of two
series last night in a stretch of six games
against each other in 10 days.
The Yankees took the series opener,
sprinting out to a five-run lead in the first
and never looked back. The Red Sox an
swered with a 10-run explosion Tuesday
night, including a five-run beating of
rookie Jose Contreras, who turned down
the Red Sox for the Yankees. The rubber

match was played last
night and was set to be
the emotional battle of
the series.
Roger Clemens, Red
Sox ace of seasons past,
was returning to the
Fens to seek his 299 th
career victory (having
lost the opportunity to

get No. 300 in Boston after losing last
week in Texas).
The fireballer was released by the Red
Sox after the 1996 season when then-GM
Dan Duquette proclaimed him to be in
"die twilight of his career."
He went on to win three Cy Youngs
and two World Series.

We should all have such twilights.
But such is life fora Red Sox fan. It
burns. Granted, the Olde Towne Team
has had their revenge on Clemens since
then, from time to time.
They roughed him up in the 1999
ALCS, when lie was knocked out of
Game 3 and rabid fans tore down the
banner hung on the outfield fence com
memorating his 20-strikeout game
against the Mariners so many years ago.
I remember the first time I saw Roger
Clemens pitch â€” I was nine years old. It
was October 10, 1990. I was in the Bay
Area visiting my aunt and uncle and the
Red Sox were playing the Athletics in the
ALCS.
My uncle got tickets to Game 4, with

the Red Sox down three games to none.
We rode the BART to the Coliseum and
made our way to the seats, proudly sport
ing all the Red Sox gear we had.
Clemens, unfortunately, blew up.
Not like "blew up the spot," but more just
like "blew his top." He didn't have great
stuff and got in such a heated argument
over a c all that he cursed at home plate
umpire Terry Cooney and was thrown
out of the game. Not exactly the best first
impression.
My uncle had gotten the seats for the
game from his office, great seats right be
hind the Boston dugout. As Clemens
and Cooney stomped angrily away from
