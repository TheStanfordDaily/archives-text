# Rocket still has Red Sox fans burning with ire
## 
### 
Ah, I've been waiting weeks for
this fortnight of the baseball sea
son.
Red Sox vs. Yankees.
Good vs. Evil.
Right vs. Wrong.
The two teams tied for first place in
the A.L. East wrapped up the first of two
series last night in a stretch of six games
against each other in 10 days.
The Yankees took the series opener,
sprinting out to a five-run lead in the first
and never looked back. The Red Sox an
swered with a 10-run explosion Tuesday
night, including a five-run beating of
rookie Jose Contreras, who turned down
the Red Sox for the Yankees. The rubber

match was played last
night and was set to be
the emotional battle of
the series.
Roger Clemens, Red
Sox ace of seasons past,
was returning to the
Fens to seek his 299 th
career victory (having
lost the opportunity to

get No. 300 in Boston after losing last
week in Texas).
The fireballer was released by the Red
Sox after the 1996 season when then-GM
Dan Duquette proclaimed him to be in
"die twilight of his career."
He went on to win three Cy Youngs
and two World Series.

We should all have such twilights.
But such is life fora Red Sox fan. It
burns. Granted, the Olde Towne Team
has had their revenge on Clemens since
then, from time to time.
They roughed him up in the 1999
ALCS, when lie was knocked out of
Game 3 and rabid fans tore down the
banner hung on the outfield fence com
memorating his 20-strikeout game
against the Mariners so many years ago.
I remember the first time I saw Roger
Clemens pitch — I was nine years old. It
was October 10, 1990. I was in the Bay
Area visiting my aunt and uncle and the
Red Sox were playing the Athletics in the
ALCS.
My uncle got tickets to Game 4, with

the Red Sox down three games to none.
We rode the BART to the Coliseum and
made our way to the seats, proudly sport
ing all the Red Sox gear we had.
Clemens, unfortunately, blew up.
Not like "blew up the spot," but more just
like "blew his top." He didn't have great
stuff and got in such a heated argument
over a c all that he cursed at home plate
umpire Terry Cooney and was thrown
out of the game. Not exactly the best first
impression.
My uncle had gotten the seats for the
game from his office, great seats right be
hind the Boston dugout. As Clemens
and Cooney stomped angrily away from


Matt Babin
the mound and towards the dugout,
my 9-year-old ears learned all sorts
of new words (Both from Clemens
and from the rabid Oakland fans
that surrounded us).
My team was going down and my
favorite player was out of the game
(Not to mention the fact that he
would later be suspended for the

first five games of the next season as
well).
Boston lost the game 3-1 and
Oakland went on to their third
straight World Series.
See, I told you — it burns.
Of course Boston took him back
— he was too g(x>d not to. In Febru
ary of 1991 they signed him to a new
deal that made him the highest-paid
player in baseball, averagingjust over
$S,(X)(),(XK) a year. Clemens respond
ed by winning his third Cy Young.
But over the next few seasons his

stats came down — he spent more
time on the disabled list, his ERA
rose, he seemed to have lost some
thing.
And so, in 1996, Boston made it
clear they wouldn't re-sign the
Rocket.
Looking back, Boston should
have seen a premonition of what
was to come in the second half of
that season — Clemens went 6-2
with an ERA just over two and tied
his own major league record by
striking out 20 batters in one game

on Sep. 18.
But no —he left. Went to
Toronto to spend his "twilight" -
and promptly won his first 11 starts
with nine complete games and three
shutouts.
Cue the violins.
Boston never forgave him.
Clemens did get the win last
night — No. 299. He scattered nine
hits over six innings, giving up two
earned runs and striking out seven.
Bastard.
But oh, what a tangled web the

fates weave — Clemens' next start
will come on Memorial Day, when
the Yankees opponent is, yes, the
Red Sox. He gets another chance
for win No. 300 against his old team
while the entire city of Boston gets
another chance for revenge.
I can't wait.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in eco
nomics and Italian who thinks the. Yan
kees suck and that Clemens unit get lit up
for six runs in two innings on Monday.
