### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three days after a disappoint
ing loss to eventual champion No.
1 Illinois in the semifinals of the
NCAA Team Championships,
three members of the No. 4 Stan
ford men's tennis team still have
something to play for at the Uni
versity of Georgia.
The NCAA Singles Champi
onships began yesterday and the
NCAA Doubles Championships
get underway today.
Senior All-American David
Martin and freshman KC Corkery
won their opening round matches
yesterday in the 64-player tourna
ment.
No. 8 Martin, playing in his last
collegiate tournament, got off to a
slow start before rallying to win
against 56th-ranked David
Loewenthal of Wake Forest 2-6,6-
3, 6-4. Last year, Martin advanced
all the semifinals of the tourna
ment before losing to eventual
winner Mattias Boeker of Georgia.
Martin will next face 42nd
ranked Oliver Maiberger in
today's second round.
In a matchup between two of
only six freshmen in the draw,
Corkery posted a solid 6-3, 6-4
win over Virginia's Doug Stew

art.
The victory improved Cork
ery's stellar season record to 30-4.
His 21-1 record in dual matches
ranks as the seventh best in Stan
ford tennis history in terms of win
percentage. Corkery has now won
22 straight singles matches since
losing to Cal's Robert Kowalcyzk
on Feb. 1.
Corkery has a tougher assign
ment in the second round as he
takes on No. 9 Jesse Witten, last
year's finalist.
Martin will pull double duty
today as he and senior All-Amer
ican Scott Lipsky will play their
first-round doubles match after
Martin's singles match. The pair
is the No. 4 seed in this year's 32-
team draw and will take on New
Mexico's Brent Salazar and
Ryan Stotland in the opening
round.
Martin and Lipsky have per
formed well at NCAAs in the past,
losing in the semifinals as sopho
mores and reaching the finals last
year as juniors.
"For us to break through and
win NCAAs this year, it will take
consistency," Lipsky said. "We
can't afford to be complacent. If
we play as well as we're capable, we
definitely have a chance of win
ning it."
