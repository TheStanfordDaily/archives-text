# Court shortage constricts ballers

Yesterday, Spencer Porter wrote about
sports at a small high school and the op
portunity they gave for an ordinary person
to shine. While 1 intend to remain fully
clothed throughout this column, I do want to con
tinue in a similar vein.
I'm going to tackle a topic I've avoided fora long
time — pick-up games.
For those of us who aren't in the 99th percentile
athletically, it is our only recourse — grab the rock,
call your buds and hit whatever passable but gener-

ally run-down public facility is avail
able for those people who play the
games that no one watches.
1 think most people will agree
that the most frustrating part about
being a "recreational player" (a
term I'm sure we all hate) is having
to wait or travel long distances to get
your game on.
Where I'm from (suburban
Chicago), there are so many tennis

courts you'd think the park districts were expecting
the ATP tour to show up unannounced.
But basketball courts? Few and far between —
and you better have a car, because it's going to take
a while to get there.
Stanford University has over 13,000 students and
a grand total of two basketball courts that are open
at night. It's a little better during the daytime, but
unless you want to shoot around on a screwed-up
basket, chances are you're going to be waiting 45
minutes for your turn at the Schwab courts.
I think conditions like these — while certainly not
unique to Stanford — prevent people from being as
athletic as they would like to be. I don't even know
how many times I've wanted to play ball but didn't
do so at the time because I didn't want to endure a
long wait just to get in a game or two.
When I do play, I often go right when the gym
opens, play until my squad loses and then head
home because I don't want to wait half an hour to
play again. Or, I play at off-peak hours (weekend
nights or early weekday afternoons) when I know
there won't be too many people around. It's a de
pressing state of affairs.
I think it is an absolute shame that so many peo
ple who were dedicated and practiced athletes as
kids and adolescents end up sitting on their couches
as adults, watching it all on TV. Maybe they go jog
ging now and then, or coach their kid's soccer team
or they play golf.
But where is it written that the people who obses
sively watch eight hours of NFL football every Sun
day can't play football themselves? More people
need to decide that it's OK to keep playing as an
adult. Sports shouldn't be consigned to the young
or the exceptionally talented. Yes, it sometimes takes
a lot of effort to find a court or a league, but it's worth
the time.
Too often, sports leagues are treated like they are
only around to provide a training ground for pre
sent or future collegiate and professional athletes. I
could play all the sports I wanted 10 years ago, be
cause back then everyone has a chance to be great,
and everyone is encouraged to give it a try. But by
the time high school begins, the weeding process is

in full swing, and you are no
longer asked, "Do you want to
play?" but rather "Are you good
enough to compete at the next
level?"
Sure, I still fantasize about
playing pro sports. Yeah, the
fame, money and groupies would
be nice. But when I dream about
being a professional athlete, the
one and only thing I ever think
about is what I would be doing on
the field of play.
People watch sports in large
part because they wish they were
the ones out there playing the
game they love.
Well, you know what? They
can, in fact, play the game they
love.
They can be the old grayhair
playing pick-up games, the old
timer who's seen better days but
is still out there putting up a fight
simply because he loves doing it.
So the next time you feel like
playing a sport, go play it. Take
that step. And if you're lucky,
you won't have to drive for half
an hour and sneak onto the
grounds of a juvenile detention
facility to find a lighted court.
