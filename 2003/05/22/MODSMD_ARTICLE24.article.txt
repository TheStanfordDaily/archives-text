# Women's golf drops to 19th place at NCAAs
## Rowton remains tied for 8th overall 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After starting out solidly in
Tuesday's opening round of the
NCAA Championships in West
Lafayette, Ind., the Stanford
women's golf team struggled on
Wednesday, shooting a 33-over
par 321. The score dropped the
team down the leaderboard into
19th place out of 24 teams.
While the Cardinal struggled,
No. 3 Southern California main
tained its narrow lead on the rest
of the field. The Trojans, who
led No. 2 Oklahoma State by a
mere four shots after the fist day
of competition, fired a solid
round of 303 on Wednesday.
Oklahoma State, however,
was up to the task, shooting
302,and narrowing the gap to
just three strokes. The rest of the
top five teams are tightly packed
with No. 4 Pepperdine just five
shots off the lead and No. 17
Ohio State just eight back.
No. 8 Auburn and No. 10
Florida are tied for fifth place, 12
shots behind front-running
use.
In the individual competition,
()k!ahoma State's Annie Thurman

showed that her first-round 73 was
no fluke, as she backed it up with a
74 on Wednesday. At 3-over par
for the tournament, Thurman
leads Washington State's Kim
Welch by just a single shot.
Duke's Virada Nirapathpong
porn, the first-day leader and de
fending national champion, shot 77
on the second day, dropping back
into a tie for eighth place overall.
For Stanford, senior Kim
Rowton led the way again, firing
a 77. She slid back a bit from her
early perch in third place, end
ing Wednesday's round in the
six-player logjam at eighth place.
Sophomore Wendra Liang
made a nice comeback after a
rough first round. Her 79 on
Wednesday moved her up from
the depths of 92nd place into a
tie for 83rd.
Junior Angela Rho shot 82,
dropping precipitously from
36th place to a tie for 72nd. Ju
nior Kim Kouwabunpat record
ed an 83, and currently stands at
94th place overall.
Freshman Kelly Husted
matched Kouwabunpat's score,
losing ground and landing in a
tie for 85th place.
This year's championship has
been marked by unusual contro
versy, as the NCAA has tried to
enforce a pace-of-play rule. Cali
fornia's Ria Quiazon was given a
one-stroke penalty for slow play
during Wednesday's round.
It is the only event of the year
that is governed by such a rule.
"I think it's ridiculous that
we have to go around in really
windy conditions playing in
four hours," said Mikaela
I'armlid of Southern Califor
nia. "I never read putts from
both ways, because you have 40
seconds."
The event continues today,
with Stanford teeing off during
the morning tee times.
