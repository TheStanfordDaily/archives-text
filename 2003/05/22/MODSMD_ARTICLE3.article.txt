# Cruz discusses life, service
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Speaking yesterday afternoon to a crowd
of well over 100 students, faculty and staff,
Nadinne Cruz, director of the Haas Center
for Public Service and a Filipina-American
educator, concluded the 2002-2003 series
of What Matters to Me and Why. In a talk
held in Memorial Church, Cruz told the au
dience about her family's history, her role
as resident fellow of Okada and her philos
ophy behind community service at an insti
tution like Stanford.
Kumar Narayanan, Class of 2000 and
member of the Okada staff in 1999, intro
duced Cruz, who recently announced her
retirement from the University.
"First, what a great loss it will be. She
gave us so much," Narayanan said. "Sec
ond, how did she have the time to do all the
things she did?"

Cruz tried to avoid any mention of the
reasons behind her decision to retire from
the University as she took the podium.
"I'm not going to talk about political is
sues," she began.
She reminded the listeners of her posi
tion as a resident fellow in Okada, the
Asian-American theme dorm, a job often
overshadowed by her position as director of
the Haas Center for Public Service.
"I haven't had the chance to tell why I
spent seven years in a dorm with my hus
band, two kids and a dog," she said.
She shared her family's history with the
audience. Her mother, a nurse during
World War 11, ran through gunfire to drag
her boyfriend's body back to the hospital
after fie had been shot by American sol
diers. Cruz' father was saved by her moth
er's brothers during the Bataan Death

Nadinne Cruz spoke to a large audience yesterday afternoon in Memorial Church. She was the
final lecturer of tne What Matters to Me and Why series sponsored by the Office of Religious Life.
March.
Her mother went to medical
school and she and Cruz' father
set up a clinic in a remote area of
the Philippines inhabited by in
digenous loggers and miners.
Cruz said her father enjoyed the
company of the locals and would
often spend time in the camps.
His murder was one of her first
experiences in political rela
tions.
"When I was three years old,
someone came up to our house
and gunned him down," she said.
"[When I was 18] I realized my fa
ther being populist but not politi
cal crossed the line by spending
nights in the camps. They must
have suspected he was organiz
ing."
Her mother decided to be
come a neurologist and moved to
the United States with her two
children. Cruz said she was"a
latch-key kid before latch-key kids
existed." When her mother
moved back to the Philippines,
Cruz remained in a convent
school in Indianapolis.
Within a year of starting at the
University of the Philippines,
Cruz dropped out of school and
began to work with peasants.
"I traveled, slept in camps for
sacadas [migrant farmers], saw
how they lived, saw how the chil
dren of asenderos [plantation own
ers] would go to Hong Kong shop
ping for the weekend," she said.
When her children were born,
Cruz came to a new understand
ing about the importance of fami
ly, which she attempted to show
her students and staff in Okada.
"In my family, across ideologi
cal lines, there was a sense of un

conditional, loving acceptance,"
she said. "I tried to replicate that
in Okada, to liberate everyone to
speak across differences of opin
ions because they felt they be
longed."
She went on to emphasize her
commitment to experiential edu
cation, which arose through her
work in the Philippines.
"Academic scholarship is insuf
ficient," she said. "[Service is] not
in textbooks, but from the 'per
sonal authority as experience.' "
Cruz paused fora moment,
choked with emotion.
"I do love this place," she said.
"For nine years I have met staff,
faculty and students, and every
where I turned I found people
who hunger and thirst. [They ask]
how do I lead my life? . . . How do
I provide for people who have the
least? That thirst is so deep, a lot
of people do community service
without saying a word about it."
She addressed the issue of priv
ilege raised so often at the Uni
versity.
"Privilege is not empower
ment," she said. "It requires a lot
of work . . . and it doesn't mean
that you're liberated. It doesn't
mean having answers."
She likened the dichotomy be
tween the sources of power and
the desire to serve the community
to the relationship between Le
land and Jane Stanford.
"It's a contest for Stanford's
soul, supported by a system of
politics and wealth," she said.
"Each one of us has a part to play
in the contest for its soul."
The audience gave Cruz a
standing ovation to loud ap
plause. Afterwards, she answered
questions from the crowd.
When asked if she had ever
struggled to continue in public
service, she related the advice
given to her by a Filipino peasant

organizer in 1967 as they watched
his village razed by bulldozers.
"Some things are not for you to
chose," Mang Ando told her.
"They are chosen for you."
To this day, Cruz said she has
followed his advice.
"It's not a passive situation, but
about being open to the possibili
ties that come our way," she said.
A Jamaican student asked her
about the balance between privi
lege and returning to one's home
land. Cruz responded that she
never forgets the tension between
the halls of privilege and her work
as an activist.
She concluded her analogy
with this lesson.
"Don't spend that much time
worrying about privilege when in
fact you're not that empowered,"
she said to applause.
A group of students led by Cari
Chen, Class of 1997, presented
Cruz with a lei and a book con
taining over 150 responses in her
honor.
Cruz, in tears, told the crowd,
"You should live your life in a way
that makes you proud."
Senior Jay Trinidad, a staff
member at Okada, praised her
speech.
"Nadinne is an absolutely mov
ing speaker," he said. "I love to
serve because she loves to teach . .
. It's rare to find someone who
can convince your mind, talk to
your heart and inspire your soul,"
he said.
"Nadinne is one of the most in
spiring people at Stanford, and
there will be many people sad at
her departure and situations
within the University that have
led to that," said Marisha Banis
ter, a coterminal student in earth
cciences. "She's one of the most
incredible people. She's able to
have her heart and mind in the
same place."
