### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Speaking yesterday afternoon to a crowd
of well over 100 students, faculty and staff,
Nadinne Cruz, director of the Haas Center
for Public Service and a Filipina-American
educator, concluded the 2002-2003 series
of What Matters to Me and Why. In a talk
held in Memorial Church, Cruz told the au
dience about her family's history, her role
as resident fellow of Okada and her philos
ophy behind community service at an insti
tution like Stanford.
Kumar Narayanan, Class of 2000 and
member of the Okada staff in 1999, intro
duced Cruz, who recently announced her
retirement from the University.
"First, what a great loss it will be. She
gave us so much," Narayanan said. "Sec
ond, how did she have the time to do all the
things she did?"

Cruz tried to avoid any mention of the
reasons behind her decision to retire from
the University as she took the podium.
"I'm not going to talk about political is
sues," she began.
She reminded the listeners of her posi
tion as a resident fellow in Okada, the
Asian-American theme dorm, a job often
overshadowed by her position as director of
the Haas Center for Public Service.
"I haven't had the chance to tell why I
spent seven years in a dorm with my hus
band, two kids and a dog," she said.
She shared her family's history with the
audience. Her mother, a nurse during
World War 11, ran through gunfire to drag
her boyfriend's body back to the hospital
after fie had been shot by American sol
diers. Cruz' father was saved by her moth
er's brothers during the Bataan Death
