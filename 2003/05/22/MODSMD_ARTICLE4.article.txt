The Hoefer Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate
Writing was awarded to six students during a special
ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Faculty Club. The
prizes were granted as part of the University's effort to
acknowledge the achievement of students in Writing in
the Major programs.
Established in 1996, the prizes are funded by mone
tary contributions from Alan Hoefer and alumnus Kurt
Hoefer, Class of 1987, through the Hoefer Family
Foundation. The awards are open to students in any
discipline, and winners receive a certificate, inscribed
book and $350 monetary award.
The winners reflected an array of majors, including
technical sciences as well as the humanities. This year,
prizes were given to senior Trevor Sutton in the Histo
ry Department, senior management science and engi
neering major Jose Mariano Resendix, junior Niki
Carelli in political science and to three students who co
authored a paper: junior chemistry major Brian Faulk
and sophomores Genevieve Guzman and Kristin Schle
icher.
"I had no idea the award existed until 1 was notified,
about a year after I'd written the paper," Sutton said.
"It's very flattering, especially considering how many
talented writers we have at Stanford
Sutton expressed his enthusiasm for the topic of his
paper, which was titled, "The Penitent's Pulpit: Alexan
der Radishchev and the French Enlightenment."
"I've always been interested in Russian history, al
though most of my studies have focused on early mod
ern Western Europe," he said. "This was an unusual op
portunity to draw parallels between the two fields.
"I was fortunate enough to find a topic that I enjoyed
and that allowed fora lot of original analysis," he added.
The prize winners' topics were very diverse ranging
