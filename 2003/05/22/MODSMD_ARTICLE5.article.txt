### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
The cost of Cardinal Care insurance
premiums for students will increase 17.4
percent for 2003-04 from $368 to $432
per quarter, continuing a pattern of rising
premiums. Although the rise merely par
allels the national trend of increasing in
surance premiums, rising health care costs
remain an issue for many students at a
time when around 41 million Americans
are uninsured.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, said, "Cardinal Care has
not been sheltered from the double-digit
health cost increases that are occurring na
tionwide and especially in the San Francis
co Bay Area."

Close to 55 percent of all Stanford stu

Stanford students. This number has been
growing slowly over the past few years and

teaching assistantships and fellowships of
at least $2,000 per quarter with a 50 per

funded between $ 1,000 and $2,000 are el

igible fora 25 percent subsidy.
It also provides a $150 per month per
dependent subsidy for eligible graduate
students. The unsubsidized cost for insur
ing a spouse will rise from $334 to $402
per month. The cost of insuring one de
pendent child will rise from $244 to $299
per month and, for two or more children,
from $448 to $539 per month.
Jay Bhattacharya, assistant professor of
medicine who teaches and does research
in the field health economics, agreed that
the Cardinal Care premium increases are
typical of national patterns.
"My first reaction is that the situation is
very similar to trends happening nation
wide," Bhattacharya said. "The Bay Area is
