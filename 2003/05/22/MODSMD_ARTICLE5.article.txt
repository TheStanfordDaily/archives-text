# Cardinal Care costs increase

### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
The cost of Cardinal Care insurance
premiums for students will increase 17.4
percent for 2003-04 from $368 to $432
per quarter, continuing a pattern of rising
premiums. Although the rise merely par
allels the national trend of increasing in
surance premiums, rising health care costs
remain an issue for many students at a
time when around 41 million Americans
are uninsured.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, said, "Cardinal Care has
not been sheltered from the double-digit
health cost increases that are occurring na
tionwide and especially in the San Francis
co Bay Area."

Close to 55 percent of all Stanford stu
dents have Cardinal Care, the health in
surance plan the University offers for
Stanford students. This number has been
growing slowly over the past few years and
includes 77 percent of the graduate stu
dent population and 38 percent of under
graduates.
Benefits are staying the same and the
University will continue the subsidy pro
gram it began this year to help graduate
students cover the cost of insurance, in
cluding the cost of insuring spouses and
dependents. The benefit provides gradu
ate students with research assistantships,
teaching assistantships and fellowships of
at least $2,000 per quarter with a 50 per
cent subsidy. Craduate students who are
funded between $ 1,000 and $2,000 are el

igible fora 25 percent subsidy.
It also provides a $150 per month per
dependent subsidy for eligible graduate
students. The unsubsidized cost for insur
ing a spouse will rise from $334 to $402
per month. The cost of insuring one de
pendent child will rise from $244 to $299
per month and, for two or more children,
from $448 to $539 per month.
Jay Bhattacharya, assistant professor of
medicine who teaches and does research
in the field health economics, agreed that
the Cardinal Care premium increases are
typical of national patterns.
"My first reaction is that the situation is
very similar to trends happening nation
wide," Bhattacharya said. "The Bay Area is
just reflecting the national trend to
ward increased premiums for insur
ance and increased cost-sharing."
Bhattacharya said that the main
debate over the trend of rising pre
miums is how much of premiums
are paid by employers vs. employ
ees. The heart of the question is why
medical services' costs are increas
ing, a controversial discussion in
health economics. The question is if
quality of care is increasing and thus
the cost of services is increasing as
well, or if premiums are increasing
without services improving.
This year's rise in premiums fol
lows a string of sharp increases for
Cardinal Care. In 2001-2002, Cow
ell Student Health Services an
nounced a 50 to 60 percent increase
for students to insure their spouses
and dependents. However, this re
sulted in a student outcry and stu
dents convinced the University to
offer a subsidy that decreased this to
around 20 percent. This year, sin
gle-student coverage increased 66
percent to $368 per quarter while
insurance for dependents again in
creased about 50 to 60 percent.
Mark Smith, a graduate student
and part of the Graduate Health
Care Task Force, said that he feels
health care costs are too high for stu
dent budgets. The task force pro
pelled the effort that convinced the
University to offer the subsidy that
later became institutionalized.
According to Friedman, the rise
in premiums next year will have its
greatest impact on students with
families, as subsidies covering
spouses and dependent children
are not increasing, while the cost of
insurance for dependents will rise
an average of 21 percent.
"I am pleased that the Universi
ty's subsidy for funded graduate stu
dents will continue to make the costs
affordable," Friedman told Stan
ford News Service. "On the other
hand, the rates of the dependent
plan will increase more and I am

very concerned about the impact on
enrolled families."
Smith cited the graduate student
subsidy as demonstrative of the Uni
versity's responsiveness to students'
health care issues and said that its
commitment to continuing the sub
sidy program is encouraging.
"Rising health care costs are a
glowing problem that is not unique
to Stanford," Smith said. "It is a very
difficult problem with no clear solu
tions at this point. Even though the
costs do in fact stretch students' bud
gets beyond die limit, we are not
being left out in the cold by the Uni
versity."
The University has limited con
trol over premium prices, as Cardi
nal Care is run by Health Net, a pre
ferred provider organization, and it
sets the cost of its plans.
"We are doing our best annually
to negotiate with the carriers the
most cost-effective plan for stu
dents," Friedman said.
Smith said, "Ideally, we would
like to see a variety of plan options
that provide different benefits de
pending on how much the student
is willing to pay in premiums."
While this year's rise is steep,
compared to an average 11 percent
increase in premiums nationally for
2001-2002, Friedman said that Car
dinal Care is still a high-value alter
native to other insurance carriers.
"The fact that it is a student plan
gives it inherently better rates due,
in insurance language, to the favor
able experience of the group," fie
said.
Bhattacharya and Smith also
agreed that Cardinal Care is a rela
tively good deal for students com
pared to other insurance companies.
"Cardinal Care may be more ex
pensive than some individual plans
purchased through another
provider," Smith said. "On t he other
hand, outside plans may or may not
provide access to Stanford clinics."
Most people anticipate Cardinal
Care premiums to continue to rise.
Bhattacharya said that fie suspects
premiums nationally to continue
rising rapidly but that this cannot
last for more than a few years.
