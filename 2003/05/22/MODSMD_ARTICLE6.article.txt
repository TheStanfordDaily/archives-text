# Robot helps to digitize library
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University libraries have recently acquired a new
robot, the Digitizing Line, which will drastically advance their dig
itization efforts by scanning bound materials at approximately
five times the rate of scanning books manually. Although Green
Library has been scanning its collection for some time, this new
technology will greatly increase the library's ability to digitize its
holdings.
The Digitizing Line was created by a Swiss company, 4Digital-
Books, and was acquired by the University in October.
"We're still in the early stages, and we're just now getting a
sense of what our capacity is and what we will be able to do" said
Stuart Snydman, digital library projects manager.
Up until February, the library's Media Preservation Depart
ment had been evaluating the robotic scanner's capabilities in
terms of what kinds of materials it could work with and analyzing
the stress it placed on the books it scanned. Now that the Digitiz
ing Line has been approved for use, the library is undertaking a
variety of projects.
One of the major projects is the digitization of all titles print
ed by the Stanford University Press. Another is to digitize the
most popular materials that are not under copyright, which
consist of reading matter published prior to 1923. Future goals
may include the digitization of newspapers, dissertations and

government documents.
"We want to provide access, we want to digitize content that's
going to support teaching and research on campus," Snydman
emphasized.
He added, "The two main goals of acquiring the technology
and using it are providing access and preservation. The Stan
ford Libraries are an amazing resource. We have amazing col-
