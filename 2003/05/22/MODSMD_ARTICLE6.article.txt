# Robot helps to digitize library
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University libraries have recently acquired a new
robot, the Digitizing Line, which will drastically advance their dig
itization efforts by scanning bound materials at approximately
five times the rate of scanning books manually. Although Green
Library has been scanning its collection for some time, this new
technology will greatly increase the library's ability to digitize its
holdings.
The Digitizing Line was created by a Swiss company, 4Digital-
Books, and was acquired by the University in October.
"We're still in the early stages, and we're just now getting a
sense of what our capacity is and what we will be able to do" said
Stuart Snydman, digital library projects manager.
Up until February, the library's Media Preservation Depart
ment had been evaluating the robotic scanner's capabilities in
terms of what kinds of materials it could work with and analyzing
the stress it placed on the books it scanned. Now that the Digitiz
ing Line has been approved for use, the library is undertaking a
variety of projects.
One of the major projects is the digitization of all titles print
ed by the Stanford University Press. Another is to digitize the
most popular materials that are not under copyright, which
consist of reading matter published prior to 1923. Future goals
may include the digitization of newspapers, dissertations and

government documents.
"We want to provide access, we want to digitize content that's
going to support teaching and research on campus," Snydman
emphasized.
He added, "The two main goals of acquiring the technology
and using it are providing access and preservation. The Stan
ford Libraries are an amazing resource. We have amazing col-

lections and we can collaborate
with our peers to help other insti
tutions that might not have the re
sources [that we do]. [We are]
building the corpus of digital con
tent that's available online."
By scanning the books, the li
brary will create TIFF files for
archival and preservation purpos
es and PDF files for general access.
Storing scans of whole books, par
ticularly images that are of preser
vation quality, brings up issues of
available hard disk space. Com
pression techniques will be used to
minimize the vast amount of space
the files will occupy.
This new technology has many

positive ramifications, including
faster scanning of books and high
quality scanned images. Other
methods of scanning include slicing
through the binding of a book and
feeding the sheets through a scan
ner. The Digitizing Line provides
an alternative that does not harm
the bound materials, providing for
their preservation. Because the Dig
itizing Line is currently located in
Green Library, the library can scan
a book and have it back on the
shelves in a short time, preferable to
sending the materials off-campus to
be scanned.
The machine requires compara
tively little human intervention to op
erate as opposed to the man-power
needed to scan a book manually.
"The amount of human work
needed depends on the condition of
the original book and the particular

requirements of the project" Snyd
man explained. "Fora more recent
book [of about 300 pages] in reason
ably good condition, very little
human intervention is required. It
will take approximately three to five
minutes for the operator to load the
book, then 30 minutes to scan. Dur
ing this 30 minutes, the operator
rarely needs to intervene, but does
have the capability to stop the ma
chine and make an adjustment."
A person checks the images for
quality once scanning is complete,
a process that can be as fast as 10
minutes.
Snydman added that the li
braries will be working towards
putting the Digitizing Line into "hill
production," running the machine
for up to 14 hours a day, which
could result in thousands of books
being scanned every year.
