# Programs help transfers adjust
## 
### ERICK FLORES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every year, the Stanford community welcomes ap
proximately 1,600 freshmen and 80 transfer students.
Though the experiences of these two groups during
their first year on the Farm — with issues ranging from
housing to s(x :ial activities to advising — can be very dif
ferent, the University seeks to welcome both equally.
Stanford takes care to offer short- and long-term
programs in order to facilitate the adjustment to cam
pus culture and administrative procedures, beginning
with New Student Orientation. However, with transfers
substantially outnumbered by freshmen, Orientation
tends to fcx:us on the concerns of freshman who are en
tirely new to college life. This has prompted the Uni
versity to find other ways to integrate transfers into Stan
ford.
Ben Huston, a sophomore transfer from the Uni
versity of Arizona, feels that Stanford does cater more to
the incoming freshmen than to other new students, but
has few complaints about that approach.
"The start of college wasn't a new thing for me — it
was something I had already been through," he said. "I
wasn't looking for someone to hold my hand when I got
here, but freshmen might need more help since they
are new to the experience."
Unlike freshmen, transfers normally have few events
held specifically for them throughout the rest oftheyear
to keep them in consistent contact with other transfers.
Some feel that recurring programs might lx- excessive
and prefer to assimilate directly into Stanford life
through complete immersion.
"I don't want to have the transfer label attached to
me," said Ryan Huss, a sophomore transfer from
Florida State University. "It's been very easy to adjust
to Stanford, to make new relationships and to get in
volved."
Like other transfer students, he
cites his luck with housing and a
great residential staff as primary
aids in making his transition
smooth.
"At Toyon, I got to know a lot of
people from my class, and it was
definitely comforting that my RAs
were approachable and knew my
name from the start," Huss said.
The administration monitors
the satisfaction of transfer stu
dents with a survey similar to the
one administered to freshmen at
the end of the year. Jared Scherer,
the director of New Student Ori
entation, claims that the com
plaints of transfers do not differ
very much from those of other
students on campus — perhaps
an indication that their problems
are less related to their transfer

status than to the fact that they're
Stanford students.
However, some transfers agree
that the quality of advising could be
significantly improved, a complaint
commonly voiced by freshmen in
the 2002 freshmen survey.
"The last time 1 met with my ad
viser was during Orientation," i luss
said. "I've had a huge problem with
transfer credit. Stanford's a really
particular bureaucracy, so I'm still
trying to figure out what GERs I've
completed."
Julie Lythcott-Haims was ap
pointed earlier this year to the new
administrative position of dean of
freshmen and transfer students in
order to address new student con
cerns. Both she and Scherer voiced
their desire to constantly improve
the experiences of all new students,
particularly the transfers, who may
have traditionally received less at
tention in their reception than first
year students.
"We want to ensure that the

transfers get the same warm wel
come to Stanford our freshmen
gel," Lythcott-Haims said.
As part of these new efforts to
maximize contentment with the
transfer experience, new programs
and ideas are in the works for next
year. A new Transfer Buddies pro
gram will match returning transfers
with new transfers, the C)utdoor Ed
ucation Program will be tested to ac
quaint new transfers with each
other during a camping flip before
the start of school and the recently
implemented transfer community
coordinator position, currently held
by junior Mike I iipolito, will ensure
that the student voice is present in
the planning process.
Scherer concluded, "We're cur
rently in the process of assessment
and definition in terms of where we
want to go with the restructuring of
our program and resources. We're
trying to figure out the needs of
transfers and how we can best meet
those needs."
