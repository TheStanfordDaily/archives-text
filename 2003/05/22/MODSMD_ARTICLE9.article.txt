# Programs help transfers adjust
## 
### ERICK FLORES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every year, the Stanford community welcomes ap
proximately 1,600 freshmen and 80 transfer students.
Though the experiences of these two groups during
their first year on the Farm — with issues ranging from
housing to s(x :ial activities to advising — can be very dif
ferent, the University seeks to welcome both equally.
Stanford takes care to offer short- and long-term
programs in order to facilitate the adjustment to cam
pus culture and administrative procedures, beginning
with New Student Orientation. However, with transfers
substantially outnumbered by freshmen, Orientation
tends to fcx:us on the concerns of freshman who are en
tirely new to college life. This has prompted the Uni
versity to find other ways to integrate transfers into Stan
ford.
Ben Huston, a sophomore transfer from the Uni
versity of Arizona, feels that Stanford does cater more to
the incoming freshmen than to other new students, but
has few complaints about that approach.
"The start of college wasn't a new thing for me — it
was something I had already been through," he said. "I
wasn't looking for someone to hold my hand when I got
here, but freshmen might need more help since they
are new to the experience."
Unlike freshmen, transfers normally have few events
held specifically for them throughout the rest oftheyear
to keep them in consistent contact with other transfers.
Some feel that recurring programs might lx- excessive
and prefer to assimilate directly into Stanford life
through complete immersion.
"I don't want to have the transfer label attached to
me," said Ryan Huss, a sophomore transfer from
Florida State University. "It's been very easy to adjust
to Stanford, to make new relationships and to get in
volved."
