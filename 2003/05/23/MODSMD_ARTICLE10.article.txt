fraternities, sororities, athletics
teams, oncologists and surgeons,
survivors, alumni, and local high

derfer said.
"The Relay For Life is just a lot

the Stanford Football Stadium
with your friends? When else do

cause while enjoying great music,
entertainment, and food for free?"
Students have chosen to partici
pate in the Relay For Life fora va
riety of reasons.
"I'm doing this for my wife, who
I fell in love with on the first day of
freshman year. She survived child
hood cancer thanks to research
done ten years prior to her birth
that was funded by the American
Cancer Society," Kochenderfer
said. "I'm doing this for my dad
who is struggling with stage IV
melanoma. I'm doing this for my
grandfather who I lost to prostate
cancer."
"I participate in the Relay as a
tribute to my mom and grand
mother, both of whom I lost to
cancer," said sophomore Frin
Gleason, publicity committee
chair for the event."I want to help
other people who are currently
going through what I experi
enced, and I want to make sure
that my children won't have to
watch me or anyone else in my
family battle (his horrible disease
in the future."
Junior Jonathan Olsen, the
Stanford Co-Liaison, said that he
enjoys the gratification of uniting
with community members fora
worthwhile cause.
"Cancer touches all of our lives
whether it affects a relative, a friend,
or someone you have never met,"
Olsen said. "It is also a wonderful
opportunity to support and reach
out to those in our community who
are struggling to find faith and hope
that they can beat cancer."
