## US sanctions ended in Iraq 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Putting aside bitter
divisions over the Iraqi war, the U.N. Security Coun
cil gave the United States and Britain a mandate yes
terday to govern Iraq and use its oil riches to rebuild
the country. The resolution opened the door to a
quick resumption of oil exports.
The 14-0 vote was a victory for the Bush adminis
tration, which won the backing of the chief opponents
to the Iraq war — France, Russia and Germany —
even though those nations felt the United Nations
wound up with too little say in shaping Iraq's future.
Syria, the sole Arab country on the council, was ab
sent during the vote.
But Syria's deputy U.N. ambassador Fayssal Mek
dad announced in the council yesterday afternoon
that his government would have voted in favor of the
resolution if the vote had been delayed fora few
hours as he requested. He said he wanted the record
to reflect that the vote would have been unanimous.
The resolution immediately ends economic sanc
tions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, opening the country to international trade
and investment.
"It's a wonderful day for the Iraqi people," Secre
tary of State Colin Powell said in Paris. "Now they can
see the benefits of liberation as other nations come to
help with restoring stability, peacekeeping operations
and reconstruction."
With passage of the resolution, the following steps
are expected:
Iraq can resume oil exports, halted since before
the war. There are 8 million barrels of Iraqi oil in
storage tanks at the Turkish port of Ceyhan that can
be sold immediately, diplomats said.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will appoint a
special representative to work with U.S. and British
administrators on humanitarian aid, reconstruction
and the creation of a new Iraqi government. Specula
tion for Annan's choice centered on U.N. High Com
missioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello

of Brazil, who has Washington's support.
Governments must freeze Iraqi assets belonging
to Saddam Hussein or his government and transfer
them to the fund unless they are subject to legal
claims. The oil-for-food program, which required
Iraqi oil revenues to be used primarily to buy hu
manitarian supplies, will be phased out over the next
six months.
Annan will review $10 billion worth of contracts
existing under the program to decide whether they
are still needed. These contracts, many of them with
Russian companies, range from food and medicine to
plumbing and sanitation equipment, oil spare parts,
and trucks.
The resolution grants immunity from lawsuits in
volving future oil and natural gas sales until Dec. 31,
2007, to allow Iraq temporary relief from paying its
estimated $400 billion debt and time to restructure
the debt.
The resolution ends sanctions without that certifi

cation. But it reaffirms that "Iraq must meet its disar
mament obligations" and says the council will discuss
the inspectors' mandate later. It gives no time frame.
Many council members had complained the reso
lution set no end to the U.S. and British occupation of
Iraq. Though Washington rejected any time limits, it
made a key concession, agreeing to let the Security
Council review implementation of the resolution
after a year and "consider further steps."
After two weeks of negotiations, the final resolu
tion also didn't give the United Nations the lead role
in putting together a new Iraqi government, as Rus
sia, France and Germany pushed for, or set a definite
time limit for the occupation of Iraq to end.
Still, France, Russia and Germany — which
months ago blocked U.S. efforts to win U.N. approval
for an invasion of Iraq — said that at least the United
Nations now has its loot in the door.
French Ambassador Jean-Marc de la Sabliere said
the final version "is not perfect."
