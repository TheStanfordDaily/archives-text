# Tax cut to boost worker income
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Congress finished
putting together a tax cut yesterday less than half
what President Bush wanted but still big enough to
send 25 million families rebates of at least $400 this
summer and boost middle-income workers' pay
checks about 4 percent the rest of the year.
"The more money people have in their pockets,
the more likely there is somebody that's going to be
able to find work in America," Bush said in praising
the package, even though its $330 billion in tax cuts
over the next decade is less than what was in a Senate
plan he dismissed last month as "little bitty."
Most workers would see bigger paychecks begin
ning in July, and many parents would get an advance
refund worth $400 for each child late this summer.
Bush said he would sign it after votes are completed
today by the House and Senate.
The last sticking point was how to distribute $10
billion in new Medicaid assistance. The money is half
the $20 billion in new aid going to fiscally strapped
state and local governments over the next two years,
bringing the total cost of the package to $350 billion,
the maximum that moderate Senate Republicans
would allow.
"Sometimes I get everything I want, sometimes I
don't," Bush told lawmakers at a private meeting at
the Capitol, according to White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer.
The president originally sought $726 billion in tax
cuts, an amount that a majority in the Senate said was
too expensive when the government is expecting to
run up a deficit of at least $300 billion, and possibly
$400 billion, this year.
"The conference agreement has more stimulative
impact than either the president's original proposal
or the original House or Senate bill," said Fleischer. In
the final years of the bill's 10-year life, "the president
is getting less than he would have liked. He recognizes
that. He wishes it could be more. But he is pleased
nevertheless."
