Last week the nation was shocked
to view the now-familiar hazing
video footage from Glenbrook
North High School in North
brook, Illinois, a suburban neighborhood
north of Chicago. What began as an an
nual Powderpuff football game between
junior and senior girls — which usually
involves an initiation ofjuniors to their se
nior year — quickly erupted into a melee
in which senior girls beat and humiliated
junior girls in plain view of at least 50 on
lookers. The victims were beaten, choked,
dowsed in paint, human waste and animal
entrails, and, according to some reports,
forced to eat mud. A long standing tradi
tion, Powderpuff football games usually
involve practical jokes and humiliation.
Yet, the junior girls of Glenbrook North
High School could not have imagined

that they would ex
perience a form of
cruelty that would
cause five of the vic
tims to be hospital
ized.
Though not the
cause of this hazing
event, the Powder
puff football game
nevertheless set the
stage for dehumaniz
ing behavior. Per
haps a form of clever
amusement to a pre
vious generation,

of femininity. Exaggerating various body
parts using balloons and pillows, males
often wear clothing and accessories that
embellish the most sexual aspects of the
female posture. So costumed, males then
prance about whorishly, completing the
reduction of the female sex to caricatures.
Female participants in the PowderpufT
tradition, as evidenced by the events in
Northbrook, are not faultless either. Fe
male participants often verbally abuse
both their competitors and game officials,
who are usually teachers within the
school. Violence between junior and se
nior girls is disturbingly common during
and after Powderpuff games. Competi
tors deliver cheap shots in plain view of
spectators. Gang fights have broken out as
a direct result of on-field behavior of fe
male Powderpuff competitors. Clearly,

Gang fights have broken out

competitors. Clearly; males

on burlesque portrayal of
the opposite sex

has no place in a society that respects gen
der identity, and as such ought neither be
sponsored by schools, nor maintained as a
hazing ritual in deference to "tradition."
In its most common form, PowderpufF
football is an annual event that occurs at
high schools wherein junior and senior
girls compete in a game of flag football,
while junior and senior boys dress up as
cheerleaders and dance team members,
arousing the crowd by performing stunts,
routines and often salacious sketches.
Though sometimes a part of homecoming
week, PowderpufF football often serves as
an informal initiation for juniors into the
senior class and as a fund-raising event for
school activities or charities. Glenbrook
North High School, however, has not
sanctioned PowderpufF football since
1979, and the events leading up to and in
cluding the debacle took place at an ofF
campus location.
The PowderpufF football tradition re
quires males to dress up as females ac
cording to an adolescent understanding

males do not have the
monopoly on bur
lesque portrayal of
the opposite sex.
It is not surprising
that sexuality and vi
olence should play
on the same field.
Freud even suggest
ed that the two major
life urges are Eros
and Thanatos —
sexuality and death.
Nor should it be sur
prising that when
sexuality is travestied
in real life, the out-

come is violent. Failure to respect a per
son's sexuality and gender identity is also
a denial of his or her personhood. In the
case of PowderpufFFootball, gender rever
sal is an occasion fit for mockery and
hence no one respected themselves or
each other.
Those who First began the tradition of
PowderpufF football were confined to
rigid gender identities — the Football
game served as a mockery oF gender re
versal. However, persons in our time are
Freer to explore and question the inherit
ed notions of masculinity and Femininity.
In our current society, a sport should not
dictate how one views his or her masculin
ity or Feminitiy. We believe males and Fe
males ought to be able to choose their gen
der identities and have their respective
graces honored by their peers rather than
lampooned. PowderpufF Football, by its
disparagement oF gender, sets the perfect
stage For violent encounters, and no
longer belongs as a rite oF passage in the
high school experience.
