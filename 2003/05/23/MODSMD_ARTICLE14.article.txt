## Progressive technology? 
### 
Ihave noticed recently that I
am very easily distracted. I
can't help but stare out the
window during lecture. 1 watch
people at the library when I
should be doing my reading. I go
out to parties every opportunity
I get. Worst of all, I check my e
mail incessantly.
It has become somewhat of an
obsession. I close Eudora on my
laptop when I leave my room.
This way I can check my e-mail at
Meyer when I walk by.
I have my cell phone with me
at all times. I, like most students,
no longer have a land-line in my
dorm room. I check for missed
calls in between classes, even
though there is no way that I can
return the call or do anything
about the message.
I'm not big into text messag
ing, but I know plenty of people
who are. Quick little sentences
can be sent — even during
class — just to say hi to a friend.
No real content in the message.
Because of this habit, I am
fearful of the new technological
capability that will pretty much
destroy my fragile ability to con
centrate — wireless internet.
Think about the girl who
brings her laptop to lecture. You
might think she does this just to
have neat, typewritten notes. She
is so responsible, you jealously
think. However, looking over
her shoulder, you realize that
during the lulls in lecture she is
playing solitaire.
But it's gotten even worse
since wireless internet has come
on the technological scene.
With the introduction of wire
less internet to the Stanford cam
pus, students will be able to be

fully connected to the black hole
of the world wide web, e-mail,
and, worst of all, instant messen
ger. I once sat behind a guy who
was IM-ing during lecture. Not
only was he distracted, but I
couldn't stop watching him in
stant message, so I was distracted
too!
These examples make me
think about technology and

when enough is
enough. Do I re
ally need to have
access to my e
mail 24 hours a
day? Do I really
need to be acces
sible to my
friends at all
times of the day?

Do I want my dad calling me on
my cell phone when I'm at a frat
party?
I just don't know if this con
stant connection is that neces
sary. It can become so distract
ing that all that concerns me is
keeping up with other people.
I'll admit that e-mail is the best
invention known to man - save
fire, electricity and sliced bread.
But I'm sure that it has taken a
lot out of my life as well. Think
of how many hours you spend
checking and responding to e
mails every day. Think of all
the pointless e-mails you send
to other people. Many of the e
mails I receive are forwards
from my friends making fun of
other e-mails. But if these e
mails are so stupid, why pass
them on to me? Even worse,
why am I addicted to reading
them?
Since our society has become
so connected, I feel like we try

harder and harder to temporar
ily escape all of this. Vacations
to remote spots, like a campsite
at Tahoe. Hours spent at the
spa just to avoid the hassle of
daily communication. It has
gotten so extreme that adven
ture vacations have caught on.
Trips to Patagonia, the
Serengeti, and even Mount
Everest attract us in part be
cause they remove us from the
fast-paced, highly connected
and wired lives that we lead. It's
like we need a break from our
lives, from our reality, from our
world. Our society can be very
tiring after a while.
And these instant connections
don't always provide closer con
tact with other people. Many
times I e-mail a friend to invite
her to dinner. I do this in part be
cause if I call her, Ill have to talk
to her for an indefinite amount
of time, while if I e-mail her, it's a
succinct message, no frills at
tached. And I'm on my way.
Would it really be that bad to call
my friend up?
I know I will succumb to wire
less internet and whatever other
technological toys come out over
the summer. And 1 will enjoy
them next year. But for now I'm
thankful that I don't have wire
less internet and these other new
distractions while finishing up
my work and studying for finals.
The sun, the mid-week parties,
my e-mail - all of these distract
me enough as it is. I already have
enough technology getting in the
way of my education. And my
sanity.

ing that all that concerns me is
keeping up with other people.
I'll admit that e-mail is the best
invention known to man - save
fire, electricity and sliced bread.
But I'm sure that it has taken a
lot out of my life as well. Think
of how many hours you spend
checking and responding to e
mails every day. Think of all
the pointless e-mails you send
to other people. Many of the e
mails I receive are forwards
from my friends making fun of
other e-mails. But if these e
mails are so stupid, why pass
them on to me? Even worse,
why am I addicted to reading
them?
Since our society has become
so connected, I feel like we try

harder and harder to temporar
ily escape all of this. Vacations
to remote spots, like a campsite
at Tahoe. Hours spent at the
spa just to avoid the hassle of
daily communication. It has
gotten so extreme that adven
ture vacations have caught on.
Trips to Patagonia, the
Serengeti, and even Mount
Everest attract us in part be
cause they remove us from the
fast-paced, highly connected
and wired lives that we lead. It's
like we need a break from our
lives, from our reality, from our
world. Our society can be very
tiring after a while.
And these instant connections
don't always provide closer con
tact with other people. Many
times I e-mail a friend to invite
her to dinner. I do this in part be
cause if I call her, Ill have to talk
to her for an indefinite amount
of time, while if I e-mail her, it's a
succinct message, no frills at
tached. And I'm on my way.
Would it really be that bad to call
my friend up?
I know I will succumb to wire
less internet and whatever other
technological toys come out over
the summer. And 1 will enjoy
them next year. But for now I'm
thankful that I don't have wire
less internet and these other new
distractions while finishing up
my work and studying for finals.
The sun, the mid-week parties,
my e-mail - all of these distract
me enough as it is. I already have
enough technology getting in the
way of my education. And my
sanity.
