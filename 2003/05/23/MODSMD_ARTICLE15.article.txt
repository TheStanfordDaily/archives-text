Stanford strangely reluctant to pursue a
solution to labor debates
In following the twists and turns of
campus labor debates and policies, it
seems that what is at stake is more funda
mental than even living wages and health
care benefits. Where the university so
often makes forthright efforts to attain
other challenging goals, in the case of
labor, the approach is very different.
In manifold other ways, Stanford Uni
versity has sought out faculty, staff, and
student perspectives and recommenda
tions and undertaken difficult implemen
tation of new programs and reforms of ex
isting ones. The strength of Residential
Kducation, the alcohol policy, and Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs speak to
Stanford's past and present enthusiasm to
burnish its education and reputation even
when there were potentially short-term
costs in finances and energy.
I know very little of the economics be
hind increasing the "living wage" or de
manding that subcontractors provide
health care for all temporary workers. Yet
it seems evident that there is a dissonance
between the administration's enthusiasm

for other difficult projects and its passivity
toward the task of improving the lives of
campus custodians, cooks, and other staff
members.
The discourse on labor on campus ex
ists not on the level of integrated action to
ward a unified goal, but rather between
advocacy on the part of students, and ei
ther resistance to that advocacy or hard
won small steps on the part of the admin
istration.
How is this explained? Does racism or
classism play a factor? Are employees seen
not as potential researchers or donors on
the university's behalf? Does Stanford
truly believe increased workers' rights will
lead to financial mayhem? Does Stanford
fear a backlash from other reluctant uni
versities if it is to lead the way? Reflecting
on these questions — and their potential
answers — may shed light on the frustrat
ing labor discourse and dissonance at
Stanford.

Ambassador supports different points of
view on the Armenian genocide issue
My purpose in writing this letter is not
to convey the Turkish approach to the so

called Armenian genocide. That is well
known. It is rather to emphasize how dis
heartened I am to see that an unjust pres
sure is being exerted on The Daily not to
let them publish what Turkish students
have to say about the matter. This abso
lutely does not match with the spirit of the
First Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States of America. It is very un
fortunate that some do not even have the
minimum degree of tolerance to a view
not identical to theirs.
I support The Daily in its efforts to give
room to both sides of the story and I have
tolerance to hear the Armenian point of
view.

The New York Times scoops The Daily on
its own turf
Now is a delicate time for newspapers.
The New York Times recently admitted
("Correcting the Record," May 11, in that
publication) to a large scandal that result
ed in at least 36 falsified articles. As a result,
many people have questioned their faith
of not only the Times spec ifically but print
journalism in general.

The Stanford News Readership Pro
gram can reassure us that The Daily is tak
ing no shortcuts and is instead sticking to
its century-old traditions. Take, for in
stance, the May 22 article "Robot helps to
digitize library" as compared to the New
York limes' May 12 article "The Evelyn
Wood of Digitized Book Scanners," both
dealing with the same robot at Stanford li
braries. The New York Times scored an
interview with the head librarian of Stan
ford University in an article written by-
John Markoff (certainly no slouch in the
writing field). The Daily, on the other
hand, managed to get scooped by 10 days,
even with 3000 fewer miles to travel.
The Daily has been committed to pro
moting extraneous filler, poorly written
articles, and irresponsible journalism since
long before the Jayson Blair affair was
even a gleam in Affirmative Ac tion's eye.

Yeldermon foils to grasp the true nature
of Englisn
In his letter to the editor, "Writers
should stick to the English language" (May
22), Steve Yelderman advises that The
Daily editors should stick to writing in En

glish, complaining that "fete" is French
and not English. Sorry, Steve, "fete" is in
deed an English word — go check a dic
tionary. It's one of the many French words
adopted by our language, along with so
many other words from many different
languages. So, unless Steve is loco or a
dumbkopf, or if he simply does not enjoy
mo' bettah lingo mix-mix, he should re
sign from his post as language guru and
return to the ranks of the shmutzig with
the rest of us peons.
