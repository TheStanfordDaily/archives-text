## Pac-10 champs face Cal Poly 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While most teams will be sweating out
their final weekend series of the year
hoping to win conference tournaments
— or at least brighten their resumes for
the NCAA tournament selection com
mittee— the No. 5 Stanford Cardinal
will play a non-conference home series
lacking almost any sense of drama
against Cal Poly beginning tonight at
Sunken Diamond.
The Pacific 10 Conference champion
Cardinal (38-15, 18-6 Pac-10) has little to
play for against the Mustangs (27-25-1,9-12
Big West Conference), as even one win over
the visitors will very likely secure a national
seed — and, thereby, the right to host the
regional and super regional playoff rounds
— for the fifth consecutive season.
With a top-five ranking in each of the
four national polls, an 11-1 May record
and hosting experience in each of the four
years of the current NCAA postseason for
mat, Stanford does not seem to be in dan
ger of falling out of the top eight seeds
when they are announced on Monday.
"I think winning the Pac-10 title and
playing the non-conference schedule that
we did along with the facility we have
bodes well for us," said head coach Mark

Marquess. "There are no guarantees but I
would think we would be able to host."
Excelling against the difficult non-con
ference slate that Marquess schedules
each year — which in 2003 included cur
rently ranked No. 1 Florida State, No. 3
Cal State Fullerton and No. 9 Texas — in
addition to competing in the always chal
lenging Pac-10 gives Stanford loads of na
tional respect each year come tournament
time.
In 2001 and 2002, the selection com
mittee awarded the Cardinal with nation
al seeds on the strength of its solid record
and quality scheduling despite Stanford's
failure to capture even a share of those
seasons' conference crowns.
This year, with a Pac-10 title in hand al
ready, the Cardinal host Cal Poly, hoping
only to prevent rust and avoid a late sea
son letdown.
The Mustangs, however, see the series
as a chance to salvage their mediocre sea
son. One win at Sunken Diamond this
weekend would secure a winning season
for Cal Poly, but a Cardinal sweep would
end the Mustangs' season one game below
the .500 mark.
Taking a game from Stanford, howev
er, will be no easy task. The Cardinal has
dominated the Mustangs in their series
history, winning 40 of 45 games including

a 2002 sweep in which Stanford outscored
them 37-14.
Cal Poly did pull out a surprising 12-in
ning 6-5 win to open the 2001 season in
San Luis Obispo, but there is little doubt
about the Cardinal's supremacy in the all
time series.
Nevertheless, many times in sports the
team with more to play for comes out on
top, and the Mustangs will be hoping that
adage proves true at least once over the
weekend.
While cognizant of his opponents' in
centives, Marquess will play the series con
servatively, using the weekend as a final
tune-up before the postseason begins in
one week at Sunken Diamond.
"We want to continue to play well," he
said. "We won't let our starting pitchers go
too long or play somebody who might be
banged up, but we still want to win the
games. The main thing is that we're play
ing games this weekend instead of being
off."
Tonight, there will be fireworks at
Sunken Diamond regardless of the action
on the field, as the wildly popular annual
pyrotechnics show will follow the 6 p.m.
game.
Sunday's contest will be preceded by a
short Senior Day ceremony honoring the
team's four seniors.
