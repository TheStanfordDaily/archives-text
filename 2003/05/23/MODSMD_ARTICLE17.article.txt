# Frosh stands alone at NCAA tourney
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amber Liu continued her quest
for an NCAA singles champi
onship with unwavering play over
the last two days.
Yesterday at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, the fifth
seeded freshman advanced to the
semifinals of the tournament by
pulling out a 1-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory
over Pennsylvania's Alice Pirsu in
the quarterfinal face-off.
The three-set match was long
and hard fought — it lasted over
two hours — which was a factor
for the battle-weary Liu, who has
now played eight matches in as
many days.
"My legs just weren't moving
like they usually do," Liu said.
"She's a grinder and couldn't put
[my usual game] together.
"Mentally I was more aggressive
and put more pressure on her,
and came to the net more than I
usually do."
Liu will meet No. 8 seed Jewel
Peterson of Southern California
tomorrow in the semifinals. Al
though she has defeated Peterson
twice this year with scores of 6-2,6-
2, and 6-1, 5-7, 6-4, she does not
expect a walkover.
"It's a whole new tournament,

and every place we play has new cir
cumstances," Liu said. "I know how
she plays and 1 know what I need to
do to win, but I'm not going in
thinking I'm going to win."
In the other semifinal, top
seeded Vilmarie Castellvi of Ten
nessee will compete with Georgia's
No. 4 Agata Cioroch fora spot in
the final.
Liu reached the quarterfinals
by beating Sarah Witten of Ken
tucky, 6-2, 6-4 on Wednesday.
In Thursday's doubles match,
however, Witten and partner Amy
Trefethen turned the tables on the
Cardinal, upsetting the top-seed
ed juniors Lauren Barnikow and
Erin Burdette, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a
nearly three hour slugfest.
The loss eliminated the only
Cardinal doubles team entered in
the tournament. It also concluded
a successful campaign for both
players, as they nearly guided the
Stanford squad to a national team
title last Sunday before it fell to
Florida, 4-3.
Liu now stands as the only re
maining Cardinal competitor in
the NCAA competition and is at
tempting to push the team losses
from her mind.
"I watched the doubles match
and I was definitely unhappy that
they lost, but I have to still stay in it

emotionally," Liu said. "The team
event was a really tough loss, but
I'm going to try not to let it affect
my play."
The Cardinal freshman may
have an advantage over Peterson
in today's match.
In addition to finishing the year
31-10 during her first year of colle
giate competition, Liu has been ex
tremely strong of late and finished

the NCAA team competition un
defeated in singles.
"I just try to take it one match at
a time and try to stay mentally
tough," Liu said. "I really haven't
thought about how matches I've
played, but it's the end of the sea
son so it's kind of the final push.
"I worked really hard before I
came out [to Florida] so hopefully
that will pay off ."
