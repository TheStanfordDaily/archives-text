## Women turn around after rough second round 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team
showed determination this week, refus
ing to roll over in its third round at the
NCAA Championship in West
Lafayette, Indiana.
After a disappointing second round,
the Cardinal came out and played its best
golf yet, recording a 19-over-par 307.
However, the team was only able to move
into 18th place out of 24.
In the team race, N0.3 Southern Cali
fornia increased its lead over the rest of
the pack. The Trojans took a seven
stroke lead over No. 4 Pepperdine into
Thursday's final round.
The day also brought drastic realign
ment in the battle for top individual hon
ors in the tournament.
Annie Thurman of Oklahoma State,
who led the competition for the first two
rounds, slipped back to third as USC's
Mikaela Parmlid and Florida's Andrea
Vander surged into a two-way tie
for the lead.
Parmlid, the nation's No. 3 player,
shot a 70, and Vander Lende shot an
electric 3-under-par 69, the event's best
round so far.

Cardinal senior Kimmy Rowton strug
gled throughout the day, shooting a 7-
over-par 79.
Although the All-Pacific-10 performer
started the Thursday in a tie for eighth
place overall, she slipped down the leader
board and heads into Friday's final round
tied for 25th.
Junior Angela Rho played her best
round of the tournament so far, record
ing a 4-over-par 76. A birdie on her final
hole of the day capped off a solid second
nine, and Rho moved up into 68th place.
The Cardinal's star on Thursday,
however, was junior Kim Kouwabunpat.
After scuffling through her first two
rounds, she turned things around in dra
matic fashion, posting a 1-over-par 73.
After a topsy-turvy back nine that in
cluded four birdies, three bogeys, and
only two pars, Kouwabunpat will begin
Friday's final round tied for 72nd place.
Sophomore Wendra Liang fired her
second consecutive 79, dropping back in
the standings to 86th place overall.
Rounding out Thursday's scoring for
Stanford was freshman Kelly Husted.
The only starter without postseason ex
perience, she has struggled a bit this
week, turning in rounds of 81 and 82 on
the first two days.
Her 11-over-par 83 on Thursday sent
her sliding down the leader board once
again, and she ended the flay in a tie for
105 th place.
