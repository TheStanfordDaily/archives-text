# The
						real reason to attend MLB games this summer
## 
### 
One man's trash is an
other man's treasure.
Visit my dorm room
and you'll agree. For
as long as I can remember, I've
collected all things sports: action
figures posters, mini-helmets,
pennants, bumper stickers and
cards.
I'm now 20 and still ask for
"toys" for Christmas.
I learned at a very young age
that the coolest collectibles are
often the cheapest, whether
they are newspaper clippings,
ticket stubs, programs, souvenir
cups or pocket schedules.
To this day, I often pick out
cereal at the grocery store based
on the prize — or lack thereof
— inside.
Raisin Bran's got mini-bob
blehead dolls? 800-yah.
And then there is the pinna
cle of any sports collector's quest:
the free stadium giveaway.
Nothing enhances a trip to
the ballpark like a promotional
sports bag, replica jersey, bob
blehead or Babooshka doll.
Here are some upcoming
promotions you don't want to
miss.
Sunday, June 1: Resigned to
their ineptitude, the Tigers
take the age-old "Kids run the
bases" promotion to new
heights with the advent of
"Kids do everything" day. The
first 25 kids 14-and-under suit
up and live out their major
league dreams — running the
bases, hitting, pitching and
fielding against the visiting
Yankees — while manager
Alan Trammell and the Detroit
regulars enjoy a much needed
day off by serving as bat boys,
grounds crew members and
ushers.
Friday, June 6: Come join the
Mets for Mo Vaughn talking
bobble-belly night at Shea. The
first 20,000 overweight fans re
ceive this gem to remind them
that things could be worse —
you could be fat, slow as mo
lasses and batting .190 fora
team 11 games out of first place.
Friday, June 13: Don't walk
under a ladder on your way to
the Great American Ballpark for
Ken Griffey Jr. rehabilitation
night. All fans in attendance will
receive a Cincinnati Reds hospi
tal smock compliments of the
Cincinnati Hospital.
Saturday, June 21: The first
20,000 fans 18-and-over receive
a complimentary Carl Everett ti
tanium alloy cell phone case.
Guaranteed to prevent poten
tial damage to your phone upon
contact with the back of some

unsuspecting outfielder's head.
Thursday, July 10: All fans 4-
feet and under receive a David
Eckstein growth chart at Edison
International Field.
Friday, July 11: Tired of sit
ting in the Olympic Stadium
bleachers all alone? Then be

you better an
tonight's game
antl receive a
free Expos in

serve as great

dummy passengers for those
wishing to utilize the HOV
lanes for the morning com
mute.
Tuesday, July 29: The
Toronto Blue Jays ask you to
join them on "I survived SARS"
t-shirt day at Sky Dome.
Friday, August 1: Legends
Day at Tropicana Field. The
Devil Rays celebrate the sixth
year of their storied franchise
with teal throwback uniforms
honoring the days when it was
acceptable and expected for
them to be the worst team in the
league.
Tampa Bay greats of the past
such as Wade Boggs, Jose
Canseco and Mike DiFelice will
be in attendance and a highlight
video featuring all seven of the
greatest plays in Devil Ray histo
ry —including the 1998 debut of
Raymond, the team mascot —
will be shown during the sev
enth inning stretch, for all of
those dumb enough to stick
around that long.
Tuesday, August 5: To cele
brate the start of the Packers
preseason — and the ever-near
ing end of the Brewers season
— all fans in attendance at
Miller Park will receive a Green
Bay Packers countdown to kick
off calendar. It can't come soon
enough.
Thursday, September 25: It's
Bill Buckner glove day at Fen
way Park. Don't miss this pro
motion in conjunction with CPR
awareness week. All fans in at
tendance will receive a team

choke-job.

The last one's real. I got my
tickets. Got yours?
