# Ambassador speaks on future Korean relations
## Kim addresses U.S. involvement, military action and nuclear crisis 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Kyung-Won Kim, the former Ambassador of the
Republic of Korea to the United States, spoke in front
of approximately 50 people yesterday on the topics of
proliferation, anti-Americanism and the two Koreas.
Kim said that a "kinder, gentler approach" from the
United States towards North Korea would bring
about changes that would be favorable for both the
Korean Peninsula and the United States.
"From the point of view of North Korea — a state
ment from the U.S. is the minimum they need to sur
vive [in the current economy]," Kim said. "They feel
terribly vulnerable, I'm sure. We need to think of a
way to provide that security in a way that is not linked
to the nuclear search. In providing a commitment, we
are actually endangering their survival. I don't think
North Koreans understand this."
Kim acknowledged that the current U.S. adminis
tration would consider discussion of economic aid for
North Korea to be rewarding the country's build-up
of nuclear armaments.
"I too feel that rewarding bad behavior is not a
good policy," Kim said. "Yet it is
possible for [the United States and
South Korea] to design a package
which is not linked to the nuclear
issue."
The Bush administration has
made it clear that its main objec
tive in its relations with North
Korea is disarming the country of
its nuclear weapons. Nevertheless,
Kim said that "like most govern
ments, the Bush administration
has people who disagree with each
other," and that President Bush
has yet to take a firm stance with
North Korea.
"So far we have been respond
ing to North Korean action rather
than taking initiative," Kim said.
An offering of economic assis
tance from the United States on
the condition that North Korea
disarms would integrate the Unit
ed States' goal of non-prolifera
tion with South Korea's objective
of conflict-avoidance with North
Korea.
"I would say there is a nation
al consensus in South Korea
against military action [in North
Korea]," Kim said. "That is not
to say I am against other sanc
tions."

Kim further explained how
South Korea has come to engage
in more dialogue with the United
States, such as the May 15 summit
meeting held in Washington be
tween President Bush and South
Korean President Roh Moo
hyun.
"As you know, until recently
there was a gap in the U.S. posi
tion and the South Korean posi
tion on the ROK nuclear poli
cy — but the summit meeting in
Washington was a success and
changed the government posi
tion," he said.
Kim said the shift in relations
between the United States and
South Korea has left the nation di
vided.
"Conservatives approve of
the change, but there is protest
and resentment by the so-called
Progressives," he said. "This di
vision coincides quite remark
ably with the generational di
vide. The younger people are
quite against improving rela
tions with the U.S. Though if we
think about it, North Korea's
weaponry affects us more than
the U.S."
Kim went on to describe how
the North Korean possession of
nuclear weapons posed a threat to
Japan. That threat could lead to
the nuclear buildup of Japan,
which could then lead to an arms

race with China.
"It is difficult to believe that the
Japanese will not do anything,"
Kim said.
Regarding the political divide,
Kim continued, "Those in their
2()'s and 30's have not experi
enced the Korean War. They do
not see North Korea as a threat —
and are all too happy to join in the
current trend of anti-American
ism."
Kim added that the presence of
the United States military on the
Korean peninsula is opposed by
younger South Koreans, and they
"can argue there is no longer a
need for U.S. troops" if a coopera
tive aid package is presented by
the United Sates.
"My suggestion," Kim said in
response, "is go ahead and sign
the [package], but maintain troops
because North Korea still remains
a threat.
"The reason 1 say a kinder,
gentler approach will be more
likely to bring the collapse of the
North Korean regime is that the
regimes that go on and on and on
are the regimes against which the
U.S. takes a hostile stance," Kim
added.
Kim said he is unsure how
things will be resolved and then
added, "All I know is that North
Korea will be an interesting coun
try to watch."
