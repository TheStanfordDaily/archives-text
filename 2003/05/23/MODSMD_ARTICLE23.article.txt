Todd & Penguin is the absolute
worst. Some of the others suck, but are
redeemed by ocassional wit. Not T & P.
I would like to mention that I really
enjoyed the episodic adventures of Sander
the guy with the Beetle and the
basset hound from F;dl Quarter. That was
good stuff, although my ownership of a B
h< )und and status as a self proclaimed i < )gue
of sorts hardly qualify me as a disinterested,
unbiased party.

Pendex is by far the worst. It's not ever
funny and often insulting.

So, which comics do you want to keep?
Which ones should gel the shaft? You do
not care about this important issue in the
least. Gorgeous Dre thinks we should
keep "Calvin and Hobbes" and
"Sherman's Lagoon," but drop "Cathy."
Aaack! At least Gorgeous Dre was joking,
and the Glassies page doesn't carry
"Cathy." Then nobody would advertise.
