## Corkery garners a win, All-American honors 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times.
Day two at the NCAA sin
gles championships saw one of
the Stanford men's tennis
team's All-Americans play in
his final collegiate singles
match while another gained
All-American status for the
first time.
Senior All-American and
eight-ranked David Martin
bowed out in the second
round while freshman KC
Corkery advanced to the third
round by destroying Ken
tucky's Jesse Witten, last year's
finalist.
Any player who reaches the
third round of NCAAs earns the
title of All-American.
"That was the nice thing
about KC's win," associate head
coach John Whitlinger said.
"Now we have three All-Ameri
cans — Dave, [Scott] Lipsky and
KC.
"It's pretty cool to get All-
American status as a freshman.
It's great for our program and
KC feels good about it. He had
to earn it. He had to beat a very
good player to get it."
The 49th ranked Corkery
dropped only one game to No. 9
Witten, posting a surprisingly
easy 6-1, 6-0 victory.
"KC just played great,"
Whitlinger said. "He controlled
the points, he stayed with what
he could do, worked the ball
and didn't give Witten any
chance to get back into the
match.
Next up for Corkery v/ill be
an even more daunting task —

taking on No. 2 Benedikt
Dorsch from Baylor.
"It'll be interesting to see
what happens tomorrow,"
Whitlinger said. "I've seen
Dorsch play some great tennis.
He's been ranked No. 1 and No.
2 for the majority of the year.
Dorsh hits a much heavier ball
than Witten, so it'll be a tough
one."
No. 8 Martin was upset 6-1,
6-3 by San Diego State's Oliver
Maiberger.
"Maiberger is tough match
up for Dave," senior All-Ameri
can Lipsky said. "He struggles
against guys like Maiberger who
make a lot of balls and don't at
tack."
"Dave got to a little bit of a
slow start," Whitlinger said. "He
almost got back into it, but
Maiberger played a very good
match."
The NCAA doubles tourna
ment also got underway yester
day. Lipsky and Martin, the No.
4 seeds, defeated New Mexico's
27th ranked Brent Salazar and
Ryan Stotland 7-6, 6-2 in the
opening round.
"Dave and Lip played okay,"
Whitlinger said. "The first set
they weren't returning very
well.
"You give the opponents
more confidence the longer you
let them stay in the match. Then
anything can happen in a
tiebreaker. Luckily, Dave and
Lip won the breaker and started
rolling after that."
Today Lipsky and Martin
take on the winner of the match
between Old Dominion's Zoltan
Csanadi and Izak Van der
Merwe and Georgia's Nicholas
Boeker and Bo Hodge.
