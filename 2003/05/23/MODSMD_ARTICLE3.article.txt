# Alums meet online
## Make me a MATCH 
### ANNA GALAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Some students might remember the days when
their in-boxes were flooded with e-mails prompting
them to join Club Nexus, which was launched in full
force over a year ago. An on-line network designed to
enhance relationships among students in the Stan
ford community, Club Nexus gained many new
members before its creators went on to conceive the
successful inCircle, part of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation's efforts to enhance virtual interaction among
Stanford graduates.
So whatever happened to Club Nexus? According
to Orkut Buyukkokten, one of the site's creators who
finished his graduate work in computer science at
Stanford last spring, the server was attacked by a
hacker, temporarily turning it into a pornography
site. He stressed however, that the set-back was only
temporary and he still works on maintaining the site.
Buyukkokten said that publicity for the site has de
creased because everyone involved in the program is
no longer attending Stanford.
Buyukkokten, who now works at Google full time,
said there were seven people working on the project:
three graduate students and four undergraduates, all
of whom graduated last year.

Buyukkokten had the idea for Club Nexus when
he noticed how hard it was for people, especially grad
uate students, to meet new people.
"People seemed to have made most of their friends
in their freshman year," he said. "I thought it would
be nice to have an on-line Web site. Initially, we had
50 people sign up, who were mostly our friends."
I le said that six weeks after the launch, there were
already 1,500 members.
"It became extremely vital," Buyukkokten said.
"The surprising thing was that it was [used by] mostly
undergrads."
He said he had been expecting most of the users to


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
be graduate students. However,
80 percent of users ended up
being undergraduates, with the
other 20 percent of users graduate
students.
Tyler Ziemann, who also
worked on the project as an un
dergraduate in political science, is
now president and CEO of Affinity
Engines, which runs and main
tains Club Nexus.
"The summer 0f2002 we all got
together and thought it would be a
fun idea to map the social network
of Stanford students," Ziemann
said.
As project manager, creative di
rector and overall director of the
project, Ziemann also looked for
ways to expand Club Nexus.
"We talked to people at the ven
ture company, Concept2Compa
ny, and that's when we began
working with the Alumni Associa
tion."
Affinity Engines' first project
was turning the ideas and experi
ences from Club Nexus into inCir
cle lor the Alumni Association.
"The online community has a
lot more use value there," Zie
mann said. "As an undergrad,
most of your friends live across the
hall — you see them on a frequent
basis. For alumni, it's a great facili
tator of reconnecting with lost
friends.
He stressed that inCircle was
also good for finding useful busi
ness connections, and that with the
Alumni site, the "utility value is
greater."
Buyukkokten said thai inCircle
has become "extremely successful

and vital." An off-shoot of stan
fordalumni.org, the site gets be
tween 800 and 2,000 unique log
ins per day.
"All the seniors who graduated
last year started using the Web
site," Buyukkokten said. "It was
simply a transition for them."
Ryan Barrett, who is coterming
in computer science, said he uses
both Club Nexus and inCircle.
"The core idea of it is really
useful," Barrett said in an article
appearing in Stanford Magazine.
"It gives you a good context to
know who someone is when you
know who their group of friends
is."
Barrett said he would like to see
Club Nexus as popular as what it
once was. He still uses the site for
the "random, fun" community
type aspects like Karma Net. How
ever, he said that inCircle has more
users and lists more events.
Club Nexus currently has 2,200
members. Three and a half weeks
after inCircle launched in January,
10,652 alumni had logged in.
Coterminal student in Sociolo
gy, Caroline Campbell, who was
part of the team that got Club
Nexus up and running, said that
she gave input on design decisions
and helped brainstorm ways to
market it to the Stanford commu
nity.
Though she is no longer a part
of the team, Campbell said it was
unfortunate that Club Nexus
wasn't as popular as it once was.
"I still believe in the basic idea of
Club Nexus, but I think a lot of
work would need to be done to
give it widespread appeal and
make it part of the campus scene,"
Campbell said.
Some of the most popular as
pects of Club Nexus site were

"Hot or Not," which received
picture submissions, and
"Karma Net," which allowed
users to rate their friends based
on how nice, sexy, cool or trust
worthy they were. These ratings
were eventually turned into a
top-10 list.
"We launched it thinking it
would be super fun," Ziemann
said. "Initially we had 40 people,
and we sent an e-mail to the people
they had ranked warning them
that if they didn't rank people,
they would be ranked poorly."
Ziemann said they hacked Stan
ford. Who to better facilitate the site.
"We had to hack the Stanford

database to get every student's e
mails," Ziemann said. "It made it
so people, when adding friends to
the database, didn't have to look
up their e-mails. Orkut wrote a
script that would query the Stan
ford.Who database every five sec
onds. I don't think they ever found
out."
Kristin Ducrest, ajunior, signed
up for Club Nexus last year after
receiving a "barrage of e-mails."
"I signed up because I was curi
ous," Ducrest said. "However, it
was a disappointment."
She added that in her dorm,
"People talked about it a lot, but
then it just kind of fizzled."

to Orkut Buyukkokten, one of the site's creators who
finished his graduate work in computer science at
Stanford last spring, the server was attacked by a
hacker, temporarily turning it into a pornography
site. He stressed however, that the set-back was only
temporary and he still works on maintaining the site.
Buyukkokten said that publicity for the site has de
creased because everyone involved in the program is
no longer attending Stanford.
Buyukkokten, who now works at Google full time,
said there were seven people working on the project:
three graduate students and four undergraduates, all
of whom graduated last year.

Buyukkokten had the idea for Club Nexus when
he noticed how hard it was for people, especially grad
uate students, to meet new people.
"People seemed to have made most of their friends
in their freshman year," he said. "I thought it would
be nice to have an on-line Web site. Initially, we had
50 people sign up, who were mostly our friends."
I le said that six weeks after the launch, there were
already 1,500 members.
"It became extremely vital," Buyukkokten said.
"The surprising thing was that it was [used by] mostly
undergrads."
He said he had been expecting most of the users to

be graduate students. However,
80 percent of users ended up
being undergraduates, with the
other 20 percent of users graduate
students.
Tyler Ziemann, who also
worked on the project as an un
dergraduate in political science, is
now president and CEO of Affinity
Engines, which runs and main
tains Club Nexus.
"The summer 0f2002 we all got
together and thought it would be a
fun idea to map the social network
of Stanford students," Ziemann
said.
As project manager, creative di
rector and overall director of the
project, Ziemann also looked for
ways to expand Club Nexus.
"We talked to people at the ven
ture company, Concept2Compa
ny, and that's when we began
working with the Alumni Associa
tion."
Affinity Engines' first project
was turning the ideas and experi
ences from Club Nexus into inCir
cle lor the Alumni Association.
"The online community has a
lot more use value there," Zie
mann said. "As an undergrad,
most of your friends live across the
hall — you see them on a frequent
basis. For alumni, it's a great facili
tator of reconnecting with lost
friends.
He stressed that inCircle was
also good for finding useful busi
ness connections, and that with the
Alumni site, the "utility value is
greater."
Buyukkokten said thai inCircle
has become "extremely successful

and vital." An off-shoot of stan
fordalumni.org, the site gets be
tween 800 and 2,000 unique log
ins per day.
"All the seniors who graduated
last year started using the Web
site," Buyukkokten said. "It was
simply a transition for them."
Ryan Barrett, who is coterming
in computer science, said he uses
both Club Nexus and inCircle.
"The core idea of it is really
useful," Barrett said in an article
appearing in Stanford Magazine.
"It gives you a good context to
know who someone is when you
know who their group of friends
is."
Barrett said he would like to see
Club Nexus as popular as what it
once was. He still uses the site for
the "random, fun" community
type aspects like Karma Net. How
ever, he said that inCircle has more
users and lists more events.
Club Nexus currently has 2,200
members. Three and a half weeks
after inCircle launched in January,
10,652 alumni had logged in.
Coterminal student in Sociolo
gy, Caroline Campbell, who was
part of the team that got Club
Nexus up and running, said that
she gave input on design decisions
and helped brainstorm ways to
market it to the Stanford commu
nity.
Though she is no longer a part
of the team, Campbell said it was
unfortunate that Club Nexus
wasn't as popular as it once was.
"I still believe in the basic idea of
Club Nexus, but I think a lot of
work would need to be done to
give it widespread appeal and
make it part of the campus scene,"
Campbell said.
Some of the most popular as
pects of Club Nexus site were

"Hot or Not," which received
picture submissions, and
"Karma Net," which allowed
users to rate their friends based
on how nice, sexy, cool or trust
worthy they were. These ratings
were eventually turned into a
top-10 list.
"We launched it thinking it
would be super fun," Ziemann
said. "Initially we had 40 people,
and we sent an e-mail to the people
they had ranked warning them
that if they didn't rank people,
they would be ranked poorly."
Ziemann said they hacked Stan
ford. Who to better facilitate the site.
"We had to hack the Stanford

database to get every student's e
mails," Ziemann said. "It made it
so people, when adding friends to
the database, didn't have to look
up their e-mails. Orkut wrote a
script that would query the Stan
ford.Who database every five sec
onds. I don't think they ever found
out."
Kristin Ducrest, ajunior, signed
up for Club Nexus last year after
receiving a "barrage of e-mails."
"I signed up because I was curi
ous," Ducrest said. "However, it
was a disappointment."
She added that in her dorm,
"People talked about it a lot, but
then it just kind of fizzled."
Some students might remember the days when
their in-boxes were flooded with e-mails prompting
them to join Club Nexus, which was launched in full
force over a year ago. An on-line network designed to
enhance relationships among students in the Stan
ford community, Club Nexus gained many new
members before its creators went on to conceive the
successful inCircle, part of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation's efforts to enhance virtual interaction among
Stanford graduates.
