Some students might remember the days when
their in-boxes were flooded with e-mails prompting
them to join Club Nexus, which was launched in full
force over a year ago. An on-line network designed to
enhance relationships among students in the Stan
ford community, Club Nexus gained many new
members before its creators went on to conceive the
successful inCircle, part of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation's efforts to enhance virtual interaction among
Stanford graduates.
So whatever happened to Club Nexus? According
to Orkut Buyukkokten, one of the site's creators who
finished his graduate work in computer science at
Stanford last spring, the server was attacked by a
hacker, temporarily turning it into a pornography
site. He stressed however, that the set-back was only
temporary and he still works on maintaining the site.
Buyukkokten said that publicity for the site has de
creased because everyone involved in the program is
no longer attending Stanford.
Buyukkokten, who now works at Google full time,
said there were seven people working on the project:
three graduate students and four undergraduates, all
of whom graduated last year.

Buyukkokten had the idea for Club Nexus when
he noticed how hard it was for people, especially grad
uate students, to meet new people.
"People seemed to have made most of their friends
in their freshman year," he said. "I thought it would
be nice to have an on-line Web site. Initially, we had
50 people sign up, who were mostly our friends."
I le said that six weeks after the launch, there were
already 1,500 members.
"It became extremely vital," Buyukkokten said.
"The surprising thing was that it was [used by] mostly
undergrads."
He said he had been expecting most of the users to
