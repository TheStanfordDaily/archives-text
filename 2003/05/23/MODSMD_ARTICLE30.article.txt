# Carrey stages 'Almighty' comeback
## 
### LINDSEY GERDES 
Jim Carrey's career is on the rebound
after the commercial and critical failure of
his last movie, "The iMajestic." While
"Bruce Almighty" might not exactly answer
his prayers (the bad puns are just too irre
sistible) it is the most solidly comedic work
he's done since 1997's "Liar Liar."
Like "Liar Liar," in which Carrey played
a slick lawyer who suddenly couldn't lie,
"Bruce Almighty" relies on a one-gimmick
plot as an excuse for Carrey to show oft'his
trademark contortionist routines and im
pressions.
Bruce Nolin (Jim Carrey) is a self-cen
tered news reporter who finds out while on
the air that a sleaze ball colleague, Evan
(Steven Carell), has gotten the anchor job
he wanted. He complains that there is no
justice in the world and curses God for ig
noring his plight. He then quite literally
gets a page from God, a Yankees hat-wear
ing Morgan Freeman, who tells Bruce that
if he's unhappy with God's performance,
he can do the job himself.
Bruce is then endowed with all of the
Almighty's powers. After wreaking havoc
because of the self-serving aims he uses his
power for, he becomes humbled, learning
to better appreciate both his work and
good-hearted girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer

Aniston).
The movie is
at its most 1
shamelessly fun
when Bruce at
tempts revenge
with his new
powers. He first
runs across a
gang of thugs
who recently

beat him lip (pre-powers) for defending a
homeless man. The leader of the gang tells
Bruce that he would sooner have a monkey
come out of his butt than back down. You
can imagine what happens next.
In another hilarious scene, which possi
bly got the loudest laughs at the screening I
attended, Bruce exacts revenge on Evan by
serving as a ventriloquist, making him al
ternately stutter, fart and discuss his nipples
while broadcasting the news. Bruce also
uses his powers to woo Grace with some as
tounding new tricks in the bedroom.
The screenplay by Steven Koren and
Mark O'Keefe has an element of cleverness.
Bruce is bombarded with so many prayer
requests that he creates a "Yahweh" ac
count, and when he gets lazy, he just press
es a "reply all: OK" button. Despite these
inspired moments, the movie falls short of
earlier comic triumphs like "Liar Liar" be

cause of its awkwardness in dealing with the
heavy religious material underlying the
plot.
The writers opt for the extreme side of
corny, and Carrey ultimately learns that the
true miracles are mothers working two jobs
and people putting themselves through
school.
While this is certainly an admirable, if
well-tread, message, it is quite awkwardly
juxtaposed with dog urination jokes, and

the two elements are never really recon
ciled. Instead, the moral aspect seems hur
riedly tacked on, and the movie becomes
quite excruciating as it winds down.
For old school Carrey fans there is still
some good mindless entertainment, and if
you skip out on the last 30 minutes, you'll
still get their money's worth. And for those
of you who like movies to end in cheesy,
tearful confessions with an extra little heart
warming twist; well, you'll be in heaven.



We can only imagine what they are looking at. Unless, of course, you watch the movie.
