# Be happy these aren't your 'In-Laws'
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
It is often said that comedy is much
more difficult to pull off than drama. Evi
dence of this may be seen by the fact that
most recent comedies seem to appeal to ei
ther the lowbrow (with physical stunts and
gross-out gags) or the highbrow (comedy
with a message and / or a barrage of pop
culture references). "The In-Laws" —
which must have been pitched as "Meet the
Parents" meets "Lethal Weapon" — takes
neither of these routes. It is a remake, but
I haven't seen the original — supposedly a
comedy classic — so I'll have to judge it on
its own merits. These merits aren't plenti
ful, but they do include the fact that the
movie is both entertaining and humorous,
two qualities that too many films lack these
days.
Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks
play fathers of a couple about to get mar
ried, each nervous about meeting the
other. Brooks' Jerry Peyser is a podiatrist,
while Douglas plays Steve Tobias, a man
somehow involved in international in
trigue — a point made bluntly clear by an
early chase scene underscored by Paul Mc-
Cartney's Bond theme, "Live and Let Die."
Such obvious nods are the extent of the
movie's forays into pop-culture humor.

Due to his international work — for
merly with the CIA, currently with arms
smugglers, and perhaps with both — To
bias has been largely an absentee father to
Mark ("Van Wilder" 's Ryan Reynolds).
Nevertheless, he has promised to be there
for the wedding, which of course throws a
wrench in his shady multimillion-dollar
business dealings.
The conservative Peyser somehow gets

in the middle, so he's brought along, try
ing desperately and helplessly to fix what
Tobias has gotten hini into. Among other
situations, Tobias has made his adversary
— a homoerotic Frenchman — think that
Peyser is more dangerous (and ergo sexy)
than either of them. This results in un
comfortable affections and far too many in
sensitive homosexual jokes (albeit PC»-13
ones) fora movie in 2003.

Nevertheless,
stupid can be
funny and ridicu
lous can be enter
taining, as this
movie proves;
Douglas' manic
glee is something

to behold. Tobias views his misadventures
with Peyser as a way of getting him out of his
protective suburban shell. Meanwhile, To
bias must learn that he needs to be there for
his son more, whether from his ex-wife (a
hippie dippy throwback played by Can
dace Bergen) or from Peyser, who berates
his behavior after they leap from a sky
scraper.
As this course of events indicates, the
twists and turns don't make too much sense,
but one might expect this in a movie trying
to balance a sitcom-style wedding with a
"Beverly Hills Cop"- style buddy movie.
The plot is interesting, in spite of its being a
mere vehicle for the slapstick. The film is an
enjoyable piece of fluff that held my atten
tion, and 1 doubt most would regret the 90
minutes lost to it. It has little to recommend
over many others though, so perhaps wait
ing for the video might be the best option.
Of course, if one is going to do this, it might
be best to rent the original instead.
