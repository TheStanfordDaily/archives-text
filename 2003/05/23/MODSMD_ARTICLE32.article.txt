### CYNTHIA CHO 
I'll never forget the moment the air
plane door opened. A blast of air
I swept through the cabin, and my
breath flew right out with it. I peered
down below at the hills and the farmland,
and I felt my blood drain from my face.
Tom, the cameraman, glanced over at Vic,
my instructor and tandem-jumping
buddy, and nodded. After a few seconds
that felt like an eternity, Tom finally
jumped out of the plane and disappeared
from view fora few seconds. Vic tapped me
and advanced me forward on to the ledge.
1 could barely breathe or think; my mind
completely numbed with shock and disbe
lief. The only thought going through my
mind was: Oh My God. What the heU am I
doing?! I crouched down into the ready po
sition, and Vic yelled "One, two, GO!" into
my ear and we —
Wait — before I go on, let me explain
exacdy how I found myself leaping out of
plane while 10,000 feet in the air. A few
weeks ago, I was sitting at dinner with a
group of my cronies, and my friend Cyn
thia exclaimed how amazing it would be to
go skydiving. Everyone laughed, and I
proclaimed that I'd be the insane one and
do it with her, believing that we'd either do
it in the very, very distant future — or,
more likely, never. Rut the girl was serious.
She sent me several links from different
skydiving Web sites, and we discussed
dates for our daring adventure.
So on a sunny weekend morning, I find
myself willingly waking up at 5:30 a.m.
picking up Cynthia and driving an hour
and a half to Byron, Calif. Located smack
dab in the middle of a patchwork quilt of
farms and cattle ranches and surrounded
by thousands of sleek, white metallic wind
mills, Bay Area Skydiving, the company
where we've made reservations, consists of
a trailer, a hangar and three port-a-potties.
The area is eerily silent, with the only
sounds coming from the wind sweeping
through the grasses and the moans of a cow
emerging from the hills every now and
then.
Cynthia and I sign up to tandem jump
with a husband and wife team, Vic and
Connie, who have been skydiving for over
10 years. They tried tandem jumping a
decade ago and fell so deeply in love with

the feeling of free-falling that they decided
to dedicate their lives to skydiving. Now
that's true devotion — and Cynthia and I
are dying to find out why anyone in their
right minds would voluntarily jump out of
a plane multiple times. On a busy week
end, the two instructors may jump out six
to eight times, and they both try to do at
least one individual freefall every single
day.
After watching a video where we're told,
"Skydiving is a dangerous sport where we
are risking death or serious injury for the
thrill of the ride," we're handed two dou
ble-sided legal documents to sign and read.
"I can't believe we're really going to do
this," I squeak as I initial the forms that vir
tually waive away my life and every legal
right 1 might have ever had. The forms
contain a total of 57 places to initial, and we
are reminded over and over that skydiving
is a dangerous, life-threatening sport, and
the company has NO responsibility for
anything that could possible happen to us.
How reassuring.
"Oh my Cod," Cynthia mutters. "I don't
want to die." And even if we don't die, nei
ther of our insurance companies would
cover the medical costs associated with a
skydiving accident. My hand weakens with
every signature.
"But you know what I'm really scared
of," she whispers. "That'll I'll pee all over
myself when I jump."
I laugh and shake my head, assuring
her that those kinds of things don't really
happen. But then we glance at each other
uneasily and rush to take one last trip to the
teal port-a-potties outside.
After these little "formalities," it's time to
suit up. Vic sports a bright blue and neon
pink jumpsuit with blazing yellow stripes
and handed me a gray and black jumpsuit.
So much for being fashionable. Then he
straps on the harness and parachute, a
small jet-black pouch about a third of the
size of my backpack, and we talk about how
tojumpoutofthe plane. I am prepared for
a lengthy set of instructions on how to
jump, free-fall and land, but after a mere
10 minutes of learning how to be in the
right positions at free-fall and after the
parachute discharged, we are ready to
head to the top.

I walk out into the blinding daylight to
see the tiny six-person plane that will carry
us to an altitude of 10,000 feet. 1 look back
over my shoulder to see Cynthia, who will
do her jump right after mine, and she en
couragingly jumps and screams to convey
her excitement. At this point, my body is
more enveloped with fear than joy, and I
make my way to the plane extremely slow
ly. I've never walked so unhurriedly in my
life.

When 1 finally reach the plane, Vic
demonstrates once again how 1 will jump
from the ledge. Seeing him walk through
the motions makese it ever more real, and
i smile halfheartedly. So into the tiny yel
low-brown plane we go: Vic, Tom and I, as
well as another guy who is doing a solo
jump. During the plane ride, Vic and 1
chat a while, discussing what happens to
your body when you take the leap.
"Your body will go into the highest state
of alert and will activate an immense flight
or-fight response," Vic declares. "The
blood will leave your extremities and will be
shunted to your core. Your brain will only
concentrate on its most pressing needs and
you will no longer feel the cold or the wind.
And when you're done — when you've
reached the field — you will experience
unbelievable euphoria: The endorphins
will rush into your system and you'll feel an
amazing high."
Ahhh ... So this is why I am here. Risk
ing death and serious injury to do one of
the craziest (and hopefully most thrilling)
things I'd ever done in my life.
As we are talking, I glance at Vic's al
timeter, which measures the plane's alti
tude. The number slowly but surely in
creases every time I look over: 2,000 feet,
6,000 feet, 8,000 feet... My mouth begins
to go dry, and I look out the window.
"Look." Vic says as he points out the
porthole. "There's San Francisco."
I gaze out at the astonishing view. Wow,
fortune really granted us an amazing day
to go skydiving. After weeks of rain and

overcast days, the sun
innocently shone in
the blazing blue skies
and the sight of the
landscape was simply
breathtaking. I only
wish I had more of a
breath to take —at
this point, my breath
ing is quite short and
shallow.
Finally, Vic's al
timeter reaches
10,000 feet. There is
no more pretending 1
am here just for the
view. There is no
turning back. Tom
looks over at Vic and
they exchange a se
cret handshake. He
gives me a reassuring
smile and a high-five.
Any trace of a smile
has vanished from my

face. Then the door opens.
The biggest surprise is that you don't
really "jump" out of the plane. You
crouch down and the instructor behind
you does all of the pushing. And then I
am off—falling at a soaring 120 miles
per hour like Superman —or Super
woman, in my case.
The first few seconds of free-fall are
filled with complete sensory overload.
Every drop of adrenaline my body has pre
pared is massively dumped into my blood
stream. I can't really stream, as the air is
sucked out of my lungs, and any sound is
drowned away from the rush of wind as 1
fall through the air. I finally gain some of
ni) senses back, and the real fun begins.
Still scared shitless, I stretched out my arms
and soared through the air at an incredible
speed. But this is beyond fun — this is in
credible.
I grin and wave frantically at the camera
on top of Tom's head and then look out
into the landscape. During free-fall, you
f;dl through ever)' 1,000 feet in five or six

seconds. Yet each second is filled with so
much sensation and awe that it feels like
you've entered a time warp where each mo
ment stretches out, full of unmatchable in
tensity.
We fall for approximately 50 seconds
until Vic reaches around and pulls out the
parachute, which expands rapidly, and the
puff of air hitting the fabric jerks us into our
harnesses. The last five minutes or so are
pure bliss, drifting above the ground and
enjoying the serene feeling of pleasantly
floating in the skies.
The landing is soft and gentle, merely
skimming the surface of the earth. The
feeling of euphoria that Vic had described
begins to flow throughout my body. Fora
few seconds, I simply wallow in the blend

of shock, amazement and serenity. I sense
a feeling of lightness in my being — and my
wallet certainly feels it as well, because,
after all, these thrills don't come cheap.
The entire experience — the jump, video,
DVD and photography — added up to
nearly $250.
It is an experience we all secretly — or
openly — yearn for and one that I would
highly recommend. Think you don't have
what it takes? Nonsense. I'm not a huge risk
taker: I've been skiing for years and still
refuse to ski black diamond runs, I don't go
over 75 MPH on the freeway for fear of get
ting a ticket, and I dare not enter an SAE
party by myself. So take the leap — trust
me. you won't regret it.
Would I do it again? In a second. ■

If it weren't for the DVD, video
and photographs, 1 wouldn't
believe that I jumped out of an
airplane (voluntarily!) at an alti
tude of 10,000 feet. Even now, when I
watch the DVD, diere are moments
when my heart stops.
I still haven't told my parents about
my skydiving escapade. When I
turned 18, 1 attempted to go, only to
have them ruin my plans — they
were convinced that 1 was "insane" for
wanting to intentionally put iny "life
at risk." But I mailed the video home
a few days ago; they should get it this
weekend. I can't even imagine how
my mom will react.
At the risk of soudning trite, 1 can
only say that the free-fall was the
biggest rush diat I've ever felt. I'd like
to be able to better describe in words
how amazing the free-fall was, but I
can't. Remember when you were 5
years old, and you spun around and
around until you got so dizzy that you
fell over? Multiply that feeling by 1,000
and that is one-tenth of how 1 felt dur
ing my free-fall. And remember how
you were so dizzy that you felt sick, but
as soon as your head stopped hurting
you got up and started spinning again?
You know it — I'd go skydiving again.
I say this without hesitation.
The day before I went skydiving, 1
told one of my professors about it, and
he told me that he had given his wile
a skydiving gift certificate for her
birthday. When I asked him why he
didn't join her, he said to me with a
smile, "I'm not crazy. I don't need to
jump out of an airplane to know that
I am alive."
Is that why I did it? I'm not so sure...
I think it was a combination of
many things. I was stressed out and
wanted to do something completely
out of the ordinary to take my mind
off the chaos that I call my life. 1 felt

adventurous and wanted to do some
thing before I wouldn't be able to. I
had talked about wanting to go sky
diving lor so many years, and with my
parents 3,000 miles away, finally,
there was nothing and no one to stop
me.
When I first landed on the
ground after the jump, my legs were
a little shaky. I was speechless; the
only thing I could say was "wow."
And in an odd way, I felt truly em
powered. I had jumped out of an air
plane. and I felt that 1 there wasn't
anything in the world that I couldn't
do. Maybe that's part of the appeal of
skydiving.
When people find out that I went
skydiving, their immediate response
is "That's cool!" or " Wow, weren't you
scared?" I usually say diat it was awe
some and that yes, I was a litde scared,
but it was worth it. And deep inside,
when I talk to these people, I feel
good — really good. Not in the cocky,
"I know I'm the shit" way but in the
way that you feel after you've had an
Earthquake at Ghirardelli's with three
of your best friends on a beautiful
sunny afternoon after a day of shop
ping in San Francisco.
Before 1 went skydiving, my
drawmates told me that I was crazy.
Maybe I was. I had told my room
mate to call my mom in case any
thing went wrong (i.e. I died). But I
returned to Stanford in one piece.
Now, after watching my DVD, my
drawmates all want to go skydiving
themselves. They've made a pact to
go before graduation. And if you've
never been, you need to do the
same.
So what can I say to sum up the
whole experience? It was definitely
worth signing my life off 57 times.
