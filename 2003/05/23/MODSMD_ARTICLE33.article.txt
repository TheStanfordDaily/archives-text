# Censorship in the classroom: What would Bush think?

### ANNA NORTH 
The Language Police
Diane Ravitch

If you have an e-mail account, chances are
you already know a little bit about the poli
tics of offense. Somebody sends the dorm list
an article abotit bombings in Baghdad, and

pretty soon the flames are
leaping: Some say it down
plays the Iraqi death tolls,
others claim it's an insult to
our troops. Things get per
sonal, people call each
other Commies, virtual
blood is shed. Finally the
RA steps in to decree that
henceforth the list will be
used only for house meet
ing announcements and
requests for string.
"The Language Police"
reveals a sinister fact — be
fore they reach kids' desks,
American tests and text
books go through much of
the same process. Will
right-wingers object to sex
in"The Canterbury
Tales"? Better take it out of
the reader. Will a question

about a girl offend the National Organi
zation for Women? Make the subject a
cat. The process is technically called
"bias and sensitivity review," but author
Diane Ravitch calls it censorship.

She does have some disturbing informa
tion. One publisher, for instance, forbids its
textbooks from portraying "African Ameri
cans always wearing loud colors, straw hats,
white suits" or, conversely, "standard, mid
dle-class clothes." Sounds like the only option
is nudity. Another stipulates that old people
may never be "funny" or "charming." Sorry,
grandma, better practice that scowl.
Nor is Stanford's sunny and enlightened
home state without such guidelines. Any
story about the school dance has to watch its
refreshments, as the California State Nutri
tion Unit recommends that books avoid
"fruit punches" and allow juice only if it's
100 percent pure.
According to Ravitch, the bias guidelines
are a recipe for bad teaching. Pressured
from the left by diversity advocates and
from the right by family values groups,
school districts are likely to buy books not
because of their capacity to teach, but be
cause they offend the fewest number of
people. Textbook publishers thus have to
police themselves, eliminating not only
punch and kindly grannies but also
Chaucer, Mark Twain and the Italian Re
naissance.
While it seems silly to dismiss the legacy
of Leonardo and Dante as Euro-centric,
some of the text-makers' decisions are
harder to write off. Ravitch denounces one
set of bias guidelines for prohibiting phras
es like "a life-and-death struggle to bring

black Africa into the 20th century." The
statement might not be racist in the worst
way, but it could certainly be worded better
— why tell kids there's one entity called
"black Africa" that's still stuck in some pre
vious century?
Ravitch runs into trouble when she lumps
all test and textbook standards together. For
all the evil that bias and sensitivity review
may do, we don't want education to be bi
ased or insensitive. There's a difference be
tween censorship and selection, a difference
Ravitch tends to overlook.
Certainly textbooks have a responsibility
to truth. But an English reader isn't like a
newspaper, a single source among many
that adults can voluntarily turn to. For the
students who read it, it's often the only
source — and a mandatory one at that. If
we're going to force kids to read something,
aren't we justified in being extra careful
about what it contains?
Ravitch has an important point to make:
that the offense of some is no excuse for the
forced ignorance of many. And she has some
good solutions, like filling review boards
with teachers instead of lobbyists. But her ar
gument would carry more weight if she ex
amined the reasons behind bias guidelines
rather than branding them all as instru
ments of the malignant "language police."
Suggested guidelines for Ravitch: Don't dis
miss your opponents as tyrants, or, con
versely, become one yourself.
