# Third Eye Blind's latest is only semi-charmed

### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
Stephan Jenkins writes songs about the things col
lege kids care about: sex (lots of sex), menstrual and
lunar cycles, social awkwardness and mixing alcohol
with Vicodin. He also spells his name with a pretentious
"a" instead of the standard "e." But I love him anyway.
I love him mostly for his poetic lyrics. He writes
verses like a 14th-century sultan acquires his harem:
enthusiastically and with an undeniable hint of con
ceit, a knowing Mona Lisa half-smile. But who else in
rock today is willing to write lines like "The sky, it was
gold, it was rose, I was taking sips of it through my
nose," or "You talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek,
and like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep?" Who else
could so aptly describe an orgasm as "1,000 Julys?"
Only Stephan Jenkins, the guitarist / writer / pro
ducer / front-man of Third Eye Blind. The band's
self-titled 1997 debut sold over six million copies; with
five radio singles including "Semi-Charmed Life" â€”
it was the kind of album that you could set on play and
listen to straight through without fuming at the irk
some tracks that infest every other record.
The same, alas, cannot be said about "Out of the
Vein," the group's newest release. It suffers from a
"Matrix Reloaded" complex, the weighty burden of
living up to an original so fresh and stunning that it
becomes mythic (never mind 3EB's sophomore re
lease, "Blue," which went double platinum and held
as true as possible to the first album's originality).

Third Eye Blind
Out of the Vein

Jen k -
ins conies through with the lyricism of the
aggressive poet warrior persona he's es
tablished in the past, oozing lines like
"Palm-reader's breath smells of brandy
and cigarettes" in his mellifluous voice. He
also lets me down when he sings, "Can we
try and take the high road?" on "Crystal
Bailer.'' A cliche? Why have you forsaken
me, oh Stephan?
Whereas the group's other albums fea
tured a mix of tempos, this one leans more
heavily to the swift electric rock variety, the
kind of music that you blare in a car with
open windows on the way to the beach on
a heavenly summer day. Nonetheless,
some of the albums best songs are the mel
lower ones, like "Misfits," a tribute to the
kids that everyone else aims their gooey
spit wads towards.

The songs are less catchy and poppy
than on previous albums; as a result, they are more of
an acquired taste. But, unlike mom's assertions about
brussels sprouts and other edible greens (no, not
those kind of greens), this taste is worth acquiring.
There's a greater sense of experimentation, like the
Calypso-esque beat on "Wake for Young Souls"
(which works admirably well) or the silver-voiced fe
male background singer on "Self Righteous." This in
novative spirit, I guess, is the group tapping into acre

ative vein that remained undiscovered until now. The
songs are what come "Out of the Vein."
Some of them work, and some of them don't. Die
hard 3EB fans won't be wasting their 12 bucks (come
on, we know the money came from being one of those
paid research guinea pigs anyway), but newcomers
might want to try a more accessible album first. If they
do, I'm sure Jenkins' sultry lyrics will get them sooner
or later.
