# R. Kelly touches too much of Isley's 'Body'
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
Who are the Isley Brothers?
Simply put, they are one of the
most successful vocal groups of
all time, being the only act in his
tory to have songs on the charts
in six different decades. Original
ly made famous with their hit
"Shout" in the late '50s, The Isley
Brothers have continued to re
main relevant into the present
day, now with the release of
"Body Kiss."(As this goes to
press, it has just been announced
that "Body Kiss" is the No. 1
album in America, the first for
the Isleys since 1976.)
But when we talk about the
Isley Brothers today, who are we
really discussing? Only two of
them are left: Ronald Isley, the
original lead singer and a non
original Ernie Isley, the youngest
brother who joined the band in
the 70s on guitar. (Ernie does al
most nothing on this record, but
they still need his picture on the
front because "The Ronald Isley
Solo Album" just doesn't pack
quite the same name recogni
tion.) But lastly, we'd have to say

the currenrbley f Isley Brothers
Brothers" is v tl *iociy K.iss
out a doubt,
Kelly. Yes, R. Kelly

has been the musical brain be
hind their last three albums, sin
gle-handedly helping the Isley
Brothers to regain their super
stardom. On "Body Kiss," Kelly
produces and writes all but one
track, and herein lies the biggest
problem.
See, Kelly is only a few
months removed from the re
lease of his own album "Choco
late Factory," which came out
earlier this year. Sadly, most of
the songs on "Body Kiss" sound
like throwaways left on the cut
ting room floor from the mak
ing of "Chocolate Factory."
More sadly, Ronald Isley has a
fantastic voice — he always has
— and to hear it wasted on
music as average as this is un
fortunate.
There are a few highlights
worth mentioning: "Take a Ride"
provides Ernie Isley his one
chance on the whole album to take

a full guitar
solo, and it siz
zles. "I Like,"
one of the few
up-tempo jams
on the other-

wise ballad-saturated record, fea
tures Snoop Hoggin a solid
cameo. And on "What Would You
Do?" Isley and Kelly embark on a
thick, silky vocal duet about pick
ing a girl out of the crowd up onto
the stage and asking her: "What
would you do if I said I'd like to be
your man." Although, coining
from Kelly, the words are actually
kind of creepy ...
"Body Kiss "is not obnoxiously
bad, it's just bland. Minus the ex
ceptions mentioned above, all of
the songs meld into one big soup
of soggy-ballad mediocrity. It
makes a decent make-out CD for
late at night, but that's about it.
As Ronald Isley regains more
and more stature and clout in the
music biz — and the initial success
of "Body Kiss" will help that along
— let's hope that the quality of the
material he gets offered only re
turns to the standards that his
voice deserves.
