# Manson delivers shock-less rock
## 
### ANDREW NIELSEN 
After gaining permission from
Annie Lennox to do a cover of the '80s
Eurythmics hit "Sweet Dreams (Are
Made of This)," Marilyn Manson and
his band made a video that earned
heavy rotation on MTV. Proving that
he could also write his own songs as
well, Manson subsequently recorded

his opus, "Antichrist Superstar," blow
ing the collective mind of the semi-con
servative mainstream music scene of
the late '90s. "Mechanical Animals"
came out two years later, and although
it reached No. 1 on the Billboard
charts, it was clear that Manson's goth
rock shtick could not keep shocking the
world forever. After a live album and a
subsequent mediocre studio release,
Manson has returned with "The Gold
en Age of the Grotesque."
Gone is the brilliance of Trent
Rezor's production that helped make
mid-era Manson so cutting edge. In its
place we are given a nu-metal album
with electronic influences that does
not measure up to Manson's early
work. In fairness, the album has a few
enjoyable tracks, reinforcing Manson's
desire to now clearly establish himself
as a musician as well as a performance
artist. The first song on the GD, "This
is the New Sh*t" kicks off with a
crunchy beat-box and follows into a
slamming, yet well syncopated, guitar
hook. "Everything's been said before,"
Manson spits, "there's nothing left to
say anymore," seemingly rapping the
lines. Perhaps the king of shock-rock
has ascertained such an approach
from his recent collaborations with
Eminem? "Ka-Boom Ka-Boom' is a
grinding rap-rock explosion, owing
testament to this.

On "mOB
g 9 ' Marilyn Manson
Manson,

singing, "Be obscene, be be obscene. Be
obscene baby, and not heard." The
Oscar Wilde reference comes off as con
trived and uninspired, and Manson's
pseudo-intellectual attempt seems cal
culated. Is it fair to say that Manson has
run out of ideas? The title of the song
"Doll-Dagga Buzz-Buzz Ziggety-Zag"
hints at this, as do the lyrics from
"(S)aint" â€” "I've got an 'F' and a 'C'
and I've got a 'K' too ... and the only
thing that's missing is a bitch like you."
The CD picks up momentum when
Manson backs up from his band, letting
them work their creativity. The syner
getic aspects of Manson are what have
given the group its musical credibility
within the metal community, and the
backing tracks on the album are its sav
ing grace. In other words, some of the
strongest aspects of "Golden Age" are
the musical breaks between the nihilis
tic howling of the group's front man.
"Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth"
has a powerful lead-in that slides into
an electro-metal break down, reminis
cent of Kraftwerk's mid-era instrumen
tals. Just as this beat starts to become in-

fectious, Manson comes in,
howling "This is the black collar
song, put it in your middle fin
ger and sing along." Yawn.
Of note is the guest female vo
calist on "Para-noir," who recites
a spoken word piece about the

shortcomings of celebrity, weighing
them next to the implications of de
structive narcissism and unhealthy sex
ual addiction. The track is interesting
and stands out, chiefly because of Man
son's absence. Perhaps the future for
Manson is to drop his need to be a
histrionic front man and take a more
subtle collaborative approach. We're
tired of Manson making Tim Burton
esque faces into the camera, and we're
tired of his pseudo-intelligent and self
referential lyrics that lack substance or
creative agency.
For kids into nu-metal "The Golden
Age of the Grotesque," will be new fod
der for suburban bedroom stereos
across America. For die-hard Marilyn
Manson fans, their favorite rock star is
still singing about our crumbling soci
ety and his appraisal of his position
within it. For most people, however, the
scariest thing about the album will be
picture of Manson on page 10 of CD
booklet without his make-up: His tired
34 year-old face frowns, as the culture
that once embraced him for shitting on
it leaves him in the dust.
