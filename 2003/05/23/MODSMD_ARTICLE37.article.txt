# She shoots, she doesn't score: Roxy learns to rebound
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Rebound relationships are bad news.
Everybody knows it isn't healthy to feign
recovery from a once-meaningful rela
tionship by finding solace in another pre
maturely. Old feelings linger, people get
hurt, and, worst of all, you never get the
chance to really know what single feels

like. Rebounds are trouble: This is an ax
iomatic truth.
But Roxy feels that this rule doesn't
necessarily apply when dealing with
non-meaningful relationships: those re
lationships that consist of a date or two,
a hook-up or six but don't come close to
boyfriend / girlfriend status for many
possible reasons: Maybe you realized
that gorgeous breasts or killer abs do not

a relationship make and opted out of
getting serious. Maybe you abhor the
very idea of getting serious and pur
posely kept things casual. Maybe you
feared getting rejected if you pursued
further. Maybe you were the one who
got rejected.

Regardless of the reason
why, there's a probable chance
that many of you have find
yourselves "limited" to a string
of short-term non-meaningful
relationships — and as a result,
there are ample opportunities
for you to get hurt in the
process. Sure, the hurt doesn't

go as deep as
a real break

and Jerry's remains in the freezer; tears
aren't shed; voodoo rituals involving fin
gernail clippings are left unconjured.
But still, a nagging sense of something
irks you: Guilt? Regret? Insecurity?
Choose your poison. Once in a while on
the path of promiscuity, you wind up feel
ing a little bad — bad bad, not good bad.
So what to do? You don't feel strongly
enough to justify a cleansing mope, but it
could be weeks, a month even, before
these feelings completely dissolve.
In such cases, Roxy thinks you should
fuck conventional wisdom and rebound to
hurry the healing process along. Of
course, this advice comes with a dis
claimer: If mentally unprepared, you
could end up doing the same thing all
over again and feel worse in the end. But
this risk is relatively small if you take the
proper precautions.
You can't go into the non-meaningful
relationship with a meaningful relation
ship mindset. Roxy says: "RELAX."
Take things as they come instead of ex
pecting too much from somebody you
don't really know. As Roxy learned in
honors chem, too much pressure makes
things explode. Some people are not
meant to be together, and, yes, they will

eventually realize it . . . but
that doesn't mean they
shouldn't hook up in the
meantime.
When it does come time
for you and your fling to de
fling, a nice, juicy rebound can
work wonders for your roman-

tic psyche. It's amazing how quickly a
new conquest makes you forget about
old what's-her-name. Why, just last
week, Roxy was wading ankle-deep in a
kiddie-pool of regret, thinking about the
status of a recent fling — but after a re
bound-filled weekend, she can honestly
say that she really, truly does not give a
shit! Fantastic!
The key to such superb results involves
channeling all of the negative energy that
is bringing you down and using it towards
moving forward — the screaming chorus
of the Foo Fighters' "All My Life" is a great
motivational slogan: "I'm done, done/
On to the next one!"
This is all a bit vague and conceptual,
but shallow emotional recovery is a lot like
yoga and sex: Visualization techniques re
ally do work. You just need a litde prac
tice. And stretching helps too.
Just think of it like Julia does in
Antonya Nelson's short story, "Only a
Thing" (one of Roxy's favorite pieces of
New Yorker fiction). While observing a
painter covering obscenities on a wall,
Julia realizes "in a brilliant lucid flash
that having sex with a new man was like
tracing graffiti in order to erase it: the
same motions, the undoing in the
doing."
If you can pull it off, sex provides a
physical thrill while simultaneously serv
ing as a giant emotional eraser. Sexual
multitasking: How hot is that?
