# The 						Rapture is the savior in a city of sin
## 
### JARED LISTER 
Some huge bald guy is stamping my hand
at the front door to The Great American
Music Hall, and I am thinking, o'Fan ell Street
has enough sluts, pimps, and exposed genitals logo
around. Not that I'm against any of that stuff
per se, but all the same, I'm wondering if this
place can handle The Rapture — or is there
already too much sin lurking around? When
The Rapture brings its cock-and-balls style of
musical carnage onstage, will fire and brim
stone rain from the sky all over our skinny ties
and unwashed hair? Needless to say, I'm
keeping my fingers crossed.
I begin to doubt if I am personally ready
for Judgment Day. Then I get shoved in the
back and someone hands me a drink, and I
think, Hey, it could be worse. I could be bald or
from Connecticut, and this could be a Nelly con
cert.
Next, during the two hours of opening
bands, I exercise my right to more cold
drinks as I take in the surroundings. For the
first set, I look dotingly at the small crowd of
delinquents and trust-fund babies bouncing
up and down to the synthesized beats and
gloomy love lyrics of Owen Ashworth, the
lone member of Casiotone for the Painfully

nally begin to file in and pool around the
stage just as The Paradise Boys take up their
instruments and start to play. What starts at
a whisper is in full-blown conversation by
their third song: These turds reek of middle
school talent show. Remember when those
guys spit on Jesus and stuck him to a cross?
Well, this band sucks harder. When they
start playing Duran Duran covers, I can feel
the nails drive home.
Finally, The Paradise Boys pack up their
instruments and the crowd murmurs a col
lective "Thank God" when the four mem
bers of The Rapture assume their positions
at guitar, bass, saxophone and drums. After
a few chords from Luke Jenner's overdriven
guitar, I am awash with relief. As he and
bassist Matty Safer screech into their micro
phones, heads begin to bob in the darkness
and arms cross approvingly. Bleak industri
al lights run up and down the soaring mar
ble columns and skim across the top of the
writhing crowd.

Alone. Sadly enough, he plays The Rapture A friend elbows
keyboard to a nearly empty venue, Concert Review me in the gut and
as most of the crowd mills around[|fll| • says something into
outside, mingling with bums and s ' c^e of my head,
playing grab-ass with hookers. "WHAT?" I st ream
With unfortunate timing, people the crashing drums of "House of the

Jealous Lovers." "JESUS CHRIST!" he yells
back. 1 give him the thumbs up. This is, after
all, what we came to see.
As poster boys of DFA records, The Rap
ture are de facto frontrunners for the low
tech, no bullshit rock scene radiating from
New York City. This puts them in the same
unpolished, ass-kicking union as more
mainstreamed bands like the Yeah Yeah
Yeahs, Interpol and Le Tigre. To be per
fectly honest with you, it is the wildness and
dirtiness of The Rapture's sound that raises
them atop the no-frills indie rock mountain.
Also, their music must be played at obscene
ly loud levels.
Back beneath the highly wrought and
complicated balconies of The Great Ameri
can Musical Hall, The Rapture continue to
bang through track after gorgeous track.
Jenner comes close to blowing his head open
as he wails in"The Pop Song," and I swear
that I see blood pouring out of Safer's fin
gers as he yanks the strings of his bass in

"Out of the Races and onto the Tracks."
In fact, my only complaint is that it all
ends too soon. While 55-ear-popping min
utes has made my brain unravel and helped
the crowd levitate in Christian splendor to
the ornate ceiling frescoes, I cannot help but
feel a little bit used when the show ends so
abruptly. This sensation of sluttiness in my
soul begins to recede when the band covers
Gary Glitter's "Rock and Roll Part Two" in a
second encore, but quite honestly, it's just
not the same. What we need is another hour
of this shit.


Luke Jenner of The Rapture uses his hair to
muffle out the noise.
