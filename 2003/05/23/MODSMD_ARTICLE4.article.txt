# The 						Daily interviews the Korean ambassador to the United Nations

### ALEX BLEYLEBEN STAFF WRITER 
The Daily sat down with Korean Ambassador to
the United Nations Kyung-Won Kim to discuss
Korea-U.S. relations. Kim served as the Korean
ambassador to the United States from 1982 to
1988. Since then he has maintained his participa
tion in international politics and pursued a career
in academia in Canada, Korea and the United
States.
The Daily: How would you characterize current
relations between the United States and South
Korea?
Ambassador Kyung-Won Kim: It's improved. It
was at a pretty low point when there were demon
strations around the streets of Korean cities against
the United States. That was something that hap
pened as a result of [an] accident: an American mil
itary vehicle in training accidentally killed two Ko
rean high school girls. [It was] the military court's
decision not to punish the American military per-
sonnel that led to widespread
demonstrations. That was the pe
riod in which the U.S. - Korean re
lations were at their lowest.
TD: And among the South Korean
population in general, how have
the sentiments towards the U.S.
changed in recent years?
KWK: Inevitably there has been
some change as Korea grew eco
nomically and [as] a political
democracy. The Korean people
began to speak their mind[s] more
freely. In the past, we completely
depended on the United States for
almost everything, particularly for
our security. We saw North Korea
as the source of a security threat,
and the United States maintained
their troops on the Korean penin
sula-in South Korean territory
actually - to deter North Korean
aggression. It was very effective
deterrence too, so Korean people
were very grateful for that. The
last 10 years or so, the Cold War
ended and the North Korean
economy crisis became widely
known, so most people in South
Korea began to have difficulty see
ing North Korea as a source of
threat. North Korea looked weak
instead of strong. Although in fact,
in terms of military capability,
North Korea still remains a source
of threat, but public perception
was that North Korea was not
much of a threat, and therefore
people were less conscious of the
need for the U.S. military pres
ence. But nevertheless, despite
these changes in attitude, I would
still say there is a consensus that fa
vors the continuation of the securi
ty relationship with the United
States.
TD: The North-South relations
have varied a lot in the last few
years. What is the current status of
relations between the North and
the South?

KWK: The main difficulty comes
from the North Korean nuclear
weapons program. The South Ko
rean government's position, [and]
the South Korean people's posi
tion is that it's unacceptable, be
cause North Korea's nuclear arms
would really create a huge prob
lem for us. It would be a threat to
us directly, but also it would be a
threat and it would break the bal
ance of power in northeast Asia. It
would lead to possibly a nu
clearization of Japan, and this
would mean an arms race between
Japan and China, and we would be
in a great instability. Therefore we
demand that the North Koreans
put an end to their nuclear
weapons development program in
a transparent fashion and in an ir
reversible way. And the North Ko
reans are not agreeing with our
position.
TD: What is the South's current
stance on dealing with this nuclear
issue?
KWK: There has been some dif
ference between Washington's ap
proach and Seoul's approach.
Washington was willing to consid
er economic sanctions against the
North Koreans, if the North Kore
ans continue to insist on having
nuclear weapons. Whereas the
South Korean government took
the position that not provoking the
North Koreans is better. But now
that the South Korean govern
ment's position has moved closer
to the U.S. position, this is not be
cause it put pressure on South
Korea, I think our people have
thought deeply about the matter
and decided that without the
threat of sanctions, one cannot ex
pect to be persuasive with [the]
North Koreans. Whether we apply
sanctions, whether we put pres
sure on North Korea depends on
how North Koreans behave, that's
what we are saying. In that regard,
we have come to share the same
view the United States has. There
fore, I expect that this unity be
tween American approach and
our own approach will have some

effect on the North Koreans' atti
tude; I do hope so.
TD: What role do you expect the
United States, Japan and China to
play in resolving this conflict, and
how will South Korea fit into that?
KWK: All of these countries agree
that the Korean peninsula must
not have nuclear weapons. But
North Koreans have not shown
that they agree with us. Among
these countries, China probably
has the most potential influence
on North Korean behavior, be
cause North Korea depends on
the aid that the Chinese provide
in terms of food and energy. But
my understanding is that Chinese
aid has been on the decline, and
the Chinese are sending a mes
sage to the North Koreans in a
subtle way that their aid is going to
be dependent on North Korean
behavior.
TD: What do you think is the fu
ture of North-South relations? Is
reunification possible?
KWK: It's one of those issues
about which there is no way to
predict what the future is going to
be like, except to say that mystical
as it may sound, I do believe that
Korea eventually is going to be
unified. Culturally and in terms
of tradition, we cannot be sepa
rate permanently. We have to be
come one. But having said this,
how are we going to become one
again? The relationship is very
tense, and it may become tenser
as the North Koreans resist our
demand that they put an end to
the nuclear weapons program,
but the North Koreans are in a
state of economic collapse really,
and therefore they need our
help. And we are prepared to
give them help, and so lets hope
that the North Koreans come to
their senses and decide to work
with us. And with our help, let's
hope they do something about
their economy and improve the
conditions of life for their own
people.

TD: Do you think that U.S. troops
are a necessary presence along the
border and in South Korea in gen
eral as long as tensions remain
high?
KWK: Yes, they are a necessary
presence not only in terms of what
is needed to maintain peace on the
Korean peninsula itself, but the
U.S. military role in northeast Asia
is a necessary component of our
regional balance of power. If the
United States withdraws com
pletely from northeast Asia and
does not play any security role,
that spells danger and instability
for northeast Asia.
TD: Has the war in Iraq changed
the dynamic of U.S., South Korea
and North Korea relations?
KWK: I' m sure it has, but it's not
easy to pinpoint exactly. There is
some indications that the North
Koreans have become more
sober as a result of what has hap
pened there, and North Korea
may fear that the United States
may do to them what it did to
Iraq. On the other hand, Iraq
continues to be a huge burden on
the United States. Therefore, I
personally [think] that the Unit
ed States is likely to be more cau
tious in dealing with the North
Korean issue as a result of the
Iraqi experience.
TD: How Kim-Jong II he man
aged to continue his hold on the
country and how strong is he
currently?
KWK: North Korea is a country
in which the people have never
experienced what we would call
freedom or free society. From the
Lee Dynasty which was a tradi
tional autocracy, they went under
the colonial rule [of] the Japan
ese— and when the Japanese
colonial rule ended in 1945, im
mediately a Stalinist [regime] was
imposed on North Korea, and
that continues even today. It's dif
ficult to expect a people to rise
against Kim Jong 11.

Iraq. On the other hand, Iraq
continues to be a huge burden on
the United States. Therefore, I
personally [think] that the Unit
ed States is likely to be more cau
tious in dealing with the North
Korean issue as a result of the
Iraqi experience.
TD: How Kim-Jong II he man
aged to continue his hold on the
country and how strong is he
currently?
KWK: North Korea is a country
in which the people have never
experienced what we would call
freedom or free society. From the
Lee Dynasty which was a tradi
tional autocracy, they went under
the colonial rule [of] the Japan
ese— and when the Japanese
colonial rule ended in 1945, im
mediately a Stalinist [regime] was
imposed on North Korea, and
that continues even today. It's dif
ficult to expect a people to rise
against Kim Jong 11.
The Daily sat down with Korean Ambassador to
the United Nations Kyung-Won Kim to discuss
Korea-U.S. relations. Kim served as the Korean
ambassador to the United States from 1982 to
1988. Since then he has maintained his participa
tion in international politics and pursued a career
in academia in Canada, Korea and the United
States.
The Daily: How would you characterize current
relations between the United States and South
Korea?
Ambassador Kyung-Won Kim: It's improved. It
was at a pretty low point when there were demon
strations around the streets of Korean cities against
the United States. That was something that hap
pened as a result of [an] accident: an American mil
itary vehicle in training accidentally killed two Ko
rean high school girls. [It was] the military court's
decision not to punish the American military per-
sonnel that led to widespread
demonstrations. That was the pe
riod in which the U.S. - Korean re
lations were at their lowest.
TD: And among the South Korean
population in general, how have
the sentiments towards the U.S.
changed in recent years?
KWK: Inevitably there has been
some change as Korea grew eco
nomically and [as] a political
democracy. The Korean people
began to speak their mind[s] more
freely. In the past, we completely
depended on the United States for
almost everything, particularly for
our security. We saw North Korea
as the source of a security threat,
and the United States maintained
their troops on the Korean penin
sula-in South Korean territory
actually - to deter North Korean
aggression. It was very effective
deterrence too, so Korean people
were very grateful for that. The
last 10 years or so, the Cold War
ended and the North Korean
economy crisis became widely
known, so most people in South
Korea began to have difficulty see
ing North Korea as a source of
threat. North Korea looked weak
instead of strong. Although in fact,
in terms of military capability,
North Korea still remains a source
of threat, but public perception
was that North Korea was not
much of a threat, and therefore
people were less conscious of the
need for the U.S. military pres
ence. But nevertheless, despite
these changes in attitude, I would
still say there is a consensus that fa
vors the continuation of the securi
ty relationship with the United
States.
TD: The North-South relations
have varied a lot in the last few
years. What is the current status of
relations between the North and
the South?

KWK: The main difficulty comes
from the North Korean nuclear
weapons program. The South Ko
rean government's position, [and]
the South Korean people's posi
tion is that it's unacceptable, be
cause North Korea's nuclear arms
would really create a huge prob
lem for us. It would be a threat to
us directly, but also it would be a
threat and it would break the bal
ance of power in northeast Asia. It
would lead to possibly a nu
clearization of Japan, and this
would mean an arms race between
Japan and China, and we would be
in a great instability. Therefore we
demand that the North Koreans
put an end to their nuclear
weapons development program in
a transparent fashion and in an ir
reversible way. And the North Ko
reans are not agreeing with our
position.
TD: What is the South's current
stance on dealing with this nuclear
issue?
KWK: There has been some dif
ference between Washington's ap
proach and Seoul's approach.
Washington was willing to consid
er economic sanctions against the
North Koreans, if the North Kore
ans continue to insist on having
nuclear weapons. Whereas the
South Korean government took
the position that not provoking the
North Koreans is better. But now
that the South Korean govern
ment's position has moved closer
to the U.S. position, this is not be
cause it put pressure on South
Korea, I think our people have
thought deeply about the matter
and decided that without the
threat of sanctions, one cannot ex
pect to be persuasive with [the]
North Koreans. Whether we apply
sanctions, whether we put pres
sure on North Korea depends on
how North Koreans behave, that's
what we are saying. In that regard,
we have come to share the same
view the United States has. There
fore, I expect that this unity be
tween American approach and
our own approach will have some

effect on the North Koreans' atti
tude; I do hope so.
TD: What role do you expect the
United States, Japan and China to
play in resolving this conflict, and
how will South Korea fit into that?
KWK: All of these countries agree
that the Korean peninsula must
not have nuclear weapons. But
North Koreans have not shown
that they agree with us. Among
these countries, China probably
has the most potential influence
on North Korean behavior, be
cause North Korea depends on
the aid that the Chinese provide
in terms of food and energy. But
my understanding is that Chinese
aid has been on the decline, and
the Chinese are sending a mes
sage to the North Koreans in a
subtle way that their aid is going to
be dependent on North Korean
behavior.
TD: What do you think is the fu
ture of North-South relations? Is
reunification possible?
KWK: It's one of those issues
about which there is no way to
predict what the future is going to
be like, except to say that mystical
as it may sound, I do believe that
Korea eventually is going to be
unified. Culturally and in terms
of tradition, we cannot be sepa
rate permanently. We have to be
come one. But having said this,
how are we going to become one
again? The relationship is very
tense, and it may become tenser
as the North Koreans resist our
demand that they put an end to
the nuclear weapons program,
but the North Koreans are in a
state of economic collapse really,
and therefore they need our
help. And we are prepared to
give them help, and so lets hope
that the North Koreans come to
their senses and decide to work
with us. And with our help, let's
hope they do something about
their economy and improve the
conditions of life for their own
people.

TD: Do you think that U.S. troops
are a necessary presence along the
border and in South Korea in gen
eral as long as tensions remain
high?
KWK: Yes, they are a necessary
presence not only in terms of what
is needed to maintain peace on the
Korean peninsula itself, but the
U.S. military role in northeast Asia
is a necessary component of our
regional balance of power. If the
United States withdraws com
pletely from northeast Asia and
does not play any security role,
that spells danger and instability
for northeast Asia.
TD: Has the war in Iraq changed
the dynamic of U.S., South Korea
and North Korea relations?
KWK: I' m sure it has, but it's not
easy to pinpoint exactly. There is
some indications that the North
Koreans have become more
sober as a result of what has hap
pened there, and North Korea
may fear that the United States
may do to them what it did to
Iraq. On the other hand, Iraq
continues to be a huge burden on
the United States. Therefore, I
personally [think] that the Unit
