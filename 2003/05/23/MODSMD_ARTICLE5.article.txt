# Springfest celebrates diversity
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Thousands gathered in Ford Center Plaza at
noon yesterday to watch performances, enjoy dis
plays of art and eat free food as a part of Stanford's
9th Annual Multicultural Springiest, an event de
signed to celebrate the diversity of the University's
staff.
"We have over 7,000 staff members and almost
35 percent are people of color," saitl LaDoris
Cordell, vice provost for campus relations and one
of the event's MCs. "The administration recognizes
how critical it is to recognize the contributions of
staff who work so hard here, especially in light of
budget cuts and the hiring freeze. Springfest is one
of the ways that we let staff know that diversity and
affirmative action with respect to staff hiring and
promotion are of great importance to the Univer
sity administration."
From 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., entertainers ranging
from the Socaribbean Dancers to R.T. Carr, a folk
singing librarian — all of them members of Stan
ford's staff — took the balloon-decorated stage,
while staff artists displayed their work at booths
and Bon Appetit offered a Carnaval-themed buf
fet. The event opened and closed with perfor
mances by the Stanford Soul Line Dancers, a col
lection of largely middle-aged women — includ
ing Cordell — dancing to songs such as Nelly's
"Hot In Herre."
Rosa Conzalez, director of the Diversity and Ac
cess Office and one of the event's main organizers,
estimated that 4,000 staff members attended

Springiest this year, compared to the first
Springfest's 300-person turnout. Gonzalez said she
spent five months organizing the event, assisted by
a staff of approximately 100 volunteers.
"It started out as a way to bring staff groups to
gether, and has just grown enormously every
year — to the point now when we have people
from all seven University staff groups," she said.
Both event volunteers and attendees said that
this year's Springiest was the best yet.
"It gets better and better every year," said Carol
Skladany, an employee of the Work-Life Office
and a Springiest volunteer. "More people show up
and the quality of the performances and food im
proves. It's great to see everybody coming out and
contributing."
I lattie Roy, a Green Library employee, agreed.
"I've been to all of the Springfests, and this one
is the best," she said. "The music and entertain
ment were fantastic!"
Sunder Ramkumar, a researcher with Kosmet
zky Global Collaboratory, a University research
group, said, "It was a great opportunity to see the
amazing talent that Stanford's multicultural staff
has."
Gonzalez noted that despite Stanford's current
financial difficulties, she did not have to cut back on
any of the planned activities.
"I think that it's especially worth noting that in
the toughest of times, the University is still com
mitted to this event," Gonzalez said.
Cordell said that she was extremely pleased with

this year's Springfest, but added,
"I'd like for staff to be able to attend
(his event without having to rush
back to work at 1 p.m. Ideally,
Springfest would start at noon and
go for the afternoon so that people
could attend and at the end just

head on home. Maybe next year."
Springfest was sponsored by
the Diversity and Access Office,
the office of Campus Relations,
Human Resources Services, the
African American Staff Group,
