Prompted by recent events, the Com
munication Department hosted a sympo
sium titled "The Language of War and the
Ethics of Journalism" yesterday afternoon.
Students and community members filled
Cubberley Auditorium to attend this
event, which was organized in cooperation
with Stanford's Ethics in Soeiety Program
and the Northern California Chapter of
the Society of Professional Journalists.
Theodore Glasser, professor of com
munication, moderated the panel and
opened the program by speaking of the
importance of studying the nuances of lan
guage and ethics in the press now that the
United States is involved in numerous
campaigns against terrorism.
The panelists reiterated Glasser's belief
in the timeliness of the topic.
"Words have become weapons, espe
cially in the 'War on terror,"' said Peter

Sussman, two-time president of the North
ern California Chapter of the SP) and edi
tor at the San Francisco Chronicle for '29
years. "We need to look at journalistic eth
ical obligations during this time."
Sussman emphasized the restrictive
ambiguity of the term "war" as impeding
journalistic integrity and the media's abili
ty to report responsibly.
"What is war now?" he asked. "The
word has become ambiguous. We seem to
be in a perpetual state of war against ill-de
fined enemies — even extending to such
phrases as the 'War on poverty' and the
'War on drugs.'
"Is the press partially responsible fora
shift in the term 'war'?" Sussman said.
"Have we deterrorized its meaning?
Should we now as journalists restore to the
word the shock and awe it once possessed?
1 believe we live in an era with uncomfort
able echoes of the McCarthy era, where
our enemies were scattered throughout
the country and within our government as

well."
Kathleen Jamieson, dean of theAnnen
berg School for Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania, also ques
tioned press responsibilities during peri
ods of conflict. Jamieson expressed his be
lief that the media has become more lax in
its role as a government watchdog, citing
the failure of the media to sufficiently in
vestigate and criticize the Bush administra
tion's failure to find any so-called
"weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq.
"Maybe they will be found — I'm not
here to assess whether or not such weapons
exist," she said. "Hut the fact that over a
month after the war has ended, the press
has still failed to hold the Bush administra
tion responsible for their ardent claims of
these weapons' existence, illustrates that
the media has drifted in its language. The
press has tried to hold the administration
responsible, but the lack of critique by elites
