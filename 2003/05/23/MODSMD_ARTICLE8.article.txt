### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a ceremonial ground-break
ing yesterday afternoon, Richard
Meserve, president of the
Carnegie Institution of Washing
ton, declared the beginning of
construction at the site of what will
be the Carnegie Institution Global
Ecology Research Center. The
center will house the new Depart
ment of Global Ecology.
Planning for the building began
in July of 2002 and construction is
expected to be completed by the
end of this year. The central con
cept guiding design has been to
create a sustainable, or "green"
building that, according to
Christopher Field, director of the
new department, "sets a high stan
dard for energy efficiency, [uses]
low-impact materials, and [sup
ports] a healthy environment."
When finished, energy use
within the 11,000 square-foot
building is expected to be the same
amount currently used in other
laboratory buildings in California.
The groundbreaking took
place at 260 Panama St., adjacent
to the Carnegie Institution's De
partment of Plant Biology, where
the new building will be located.

The ceremony was well attended
by trustees, faculty and students.
Speakers included Field, Meserve,
Michael Gellert, chairman of the
Carnegie and Board of Trustees,
and Pamela Matson, dean of Stan
ford's College of Earth Sciences.
Field described the center as a
"bold new step into integrative sci
ence. Our goal is to provide a new
understanding of what is neces
sary to create a sustainable fu
ture."
According to Field, the center
will be especially well-equipped
with the latest modeling tools and
equipment. These tools will add to
the "solid progress" that is already
being made. Field also empha
sized the importance of the inter
disciplinary approach the center
will be taking.
All four speakers were enthusi
astic about continuing the rela
tionship between Stanford and the
Carnegie Institution which has ex
isted for approximately 75 years.
Matson said Stanford was "incred
ibly lucky" to be working with the
Carnegie Institution and noted
that both students and researchers
are benefiting from the relation
ship.
Students in attendance ap
peared enthusiastic. Jeremy Lee, a

sophomore majoring in chemical
engineering, said that he was ex
cited about both the design of the
building as well as "the ecology
program it will be housing." Lee
currently works next door as a re
search assistant.

Graduate student in Biologi
cal Sciences Monica Stein ex
pressed her hope that the
building will be used as a model
for other sustainable building
projects on campus and else
where.
