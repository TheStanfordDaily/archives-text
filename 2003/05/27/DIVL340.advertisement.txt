A brilliant international thriller set in contemporary Kashmir, about an
investigative journalist, espionage, and the temptations of drugs, sex. and
corruption in the Indian Army. Our hero, known as MM, is a pleasure
seeking journalist working for an upstart Indian newsweekly. He is also an
ex-army cadet with political connections, able to secure exclusive and
dangerous assignments in the armed forces with the promise that he'll write
about his experiences. But MM has ulterior motives. Over a period of years
he has been clandestinely investigating a source of corruption in the
guerrilla war on India's frontier: in the midst of skirmishes with the
"Mossies" in Kashmir, the sale of arms and drugs-often back to the
insurgents they have been seized from-is an ever-renewable source of profit.
MM hits the jackpot when a brutal border-patrol raid on which he is tagging
along uncovers an enormous cache of both arms and high-grade heroin: but
the goods in hand also provide him with a tempting brokerage opportunity.
Knowing, cynical, highly capable, and deeply motivated, MM is an
intriguing new postmodern hero. His action-packed narration of his
daredevil, drug- and sex-drenched dangerous life is world-class suspense of
an entirely new kind.
