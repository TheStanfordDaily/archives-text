## U.S. convoy ambushed 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Gunmen am
bushed a U.S. military convoy in northern Iraq
yesterday, killing an American soldier and
wounding another. Separately, another U.S.
soldier was killed and three were injured when
a Humvee ran over a land mine in an apparent
attack, the military said.
It was one of the most violent days for U.S.
troops since the war ended last month.
In the north, unidentified attackers opened
fire on an eight-vehicle convoy on a resupply
mission to a base near the town of Hadithah,
about 120 miles north of Baghdad, the U.S.
Central Command said in a statement.
The command said the ambush happened
at 6:15 a.m. and that the troops belonged to the
3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which is based
at Fort Carson near Colorado Springs, Colo.
The assailants used machine guns and rock
et-propelled grenades in the attack, the latest of
several on coalition forces this month. The
statement said helicopters were immediately
dispatched to the area to find the gunmen.
Later yesterday, U.S. Central Command is
sued a statement saying a U .S. soldier was killed
and three injured when a Humvee ran over a
land mine or unexploded ordnance at about 5
p.m. in an apparently hostile act. Other patrols
in the area came to help the soldiers.
"The incident appears to be a result of hos
tile action, though the specific circumstances of
the incident are unconfirmed," the military
said in a statement.
It did not provide more details, but witness
es in the well-off Baghdad neighborhood of
Yarmouk said they heard several explosions
and a 15-minute burst of gunfire along the road
to the airport, west of the capital.
A U.S. soldier near the scene said it was an am
bush and at least one Humvee was destroyed.

Another soldier, who also refused to give his
name, said it appeared the Humvee hit a land
mine and four soldiers were wounded. Troops
blocked the highway, keeping reporters from
the scene and causing a traffic jam.
An AP reporter saw the Humvee, still burning,
about 90 minutes after the attack. It was unclear
which soldier died or whether the mine had been
placed there to directly target Americans.
The road that connects Baghdad Interna
tional Airport with the city is frequently used by
U.S. troops, many of whom are based at the air
port. At least one other reported attack has
taken place on that road in recent weeks.
The names of all the soldiers were withheld

pending notification of their families.
Meanwhile, in Baqubah, 45 miles northeast
of Baghdad, U.S. soldiers shot and killed a
woman who tried to approach them carrying
two hand grenades. The shooting took place
immediately after unknown attackers threw
handheld explosives at U.S. soldiers guarding a
former base of the pro-Iranian Badr Corps in
the town, Central Command said.
"Squad members verbally warned her sever
al more times, but she continued to advance to
wards them. When she refused, the squad shot
her several times. She fell to the ground, drop
ping one grenade, and continued to crawl to
wards them," the statement said.
