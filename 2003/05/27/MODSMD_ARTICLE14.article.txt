TRABZON, Turkey (AP) â€”
An airplane carrying Spanish
peacekeepers back from
Afghanistan crashed into a fog
shrouded mountain in Turkey
and exploded yesterday, killing all
75 people aboard.
Even after the crash, several
blasts continued to go off amid the
wreckage, apparently from am
munition on the flight exploding,
sending twisted and charred
metal flying over a wide area.
In the debris were soldiers' di
aries, family pictures, CDs and a
half-burned camera, witnesses
said.
Most of the 62 Spanish soldiers
on board had just Finished a four
month peacekeeping mission in
the Afghan capital, Kabul, work
ing at the city's airport.
"This is an appalling tragedy,
given that these soldiers were
serving the interest of peace in a
difficult mission in Afghanistan,"
NATO Secretary' General Lord
Robertson said during a visit to
the Czech Republic.
The Russian-made YAK-42D,
heading from Kabul to Zarazoga,
Spain, was trying to stop for fuel in
the Black Sea port of Trabzon. On
its third landing attempt, the
plane came in too high, turned
away and crashed in the moun
tains about 470 miles northeast of
the Turkish capital, Ankara.
Spain's Defense Ministry said in
a statement that the area was cov
ered in fog, and turbulence was
heavy when the plane tried to land.
Radio contact with the plane
was lost shortly before the crash,
and Turkish aviation officials

speculated that there may have
also been a technical malfunction.
The airplane, which belonged
to a charter company named
Ukrainian-Mediterranean Air
lines, was carrying 12 Ukrainian
crew members and a Belarusian
flight manager along with the
Spanish peacekeepers.
Turkish soldiers evacuated the
crash site after spotting unexplod
ed grenades in the wreckage,
CNN-Turk television reported.
"I had to wait 15 to 20 minutes
for the explosions to end before I
could get near to it," witness Sait
Topcu told CNN-Turk.
Spain's Defense Minister Fed
erico Trillo arrived in Trabzon
yesterday to help bring the bodies
home.
Fifty-four of the Spanish peace
keepers were returning from
Afghanistan, where many of them
had been stationed at the airport,
working on a road that would
allow heavy fuel trucks easier ac
cess to the terminals.
They were Spain's first deaths
in 17 months of peacekeeping in
Afghanistan, according to Spanish
news reports.
The plane stopped over in
Kyrgyzstan and took on more
passengers, including more
Spanish peacekeepers, said
Dutch Lt. Col. Paul Kolken, a
spokesman for the peacekeeping
force, known as ISAF.
At the military air base of
Zaragoza, where the flight was
headed, tearful relatives gathered
and tried to comfort each other
with the help of a team of counsel
lors provided by authorities.
