## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Massey a suitable choice 
### 
A selection committee of faculty,
staff and students recently chose
a new associate dean of students
and multicultural educator for
the University. Thorn Massey, currently
the assistant dean of student affairs and
assistant director of the graduate life of
fice, was selected to replace Tommy Lee
Woon, who left Stanford in 2002. Given
Massey's experience as an educator and
an administrator, and considering the
amount of time he has been at Stanford,
Massey is well-qualified to take on the re
sponsibilities and duties that are now re
quired of him.
Massey's experience at Stanford spans
more than 30 years. First he began as a
Stanford undergraduate, earning a bach
elor's degree in psychology and later a
master's degree in administration policy
analysis in higher education. His experi
ence as a student at Stanford should aid
him considerably as he seeks to build rela
tionships among students, the Office of
Residential Education and other Univer
sity offices and administrators.
In addition to serving as the assistant
dean of student affairs and assistant direc
tor of graduate life, Massey has worked as
a resident fellow in Naranja. The intimate
knowledge of student activities that such

experience provides will certainly help
him cater realistically to student needs.
His diversity of experience will play a vital
role in his ability to mediate conflicting in
terests for the University.
Perhaps the most important aspect of
Massey's new job will be strengthening
multiculturalism on campus. Diversity is
consistently one of Stanford's central ten
ants as it builds its student body, its aca
demic programs and its core values —
and Stanford is well-known for being one
of the most diverse and multicultural-fo
cused universities of its kind. Upholding
such a reputation will be a central focus of
Massey's work, and his experience in and
around the University will help him to
safeguard this value.
In his own words, Massey has ex
plained that his goal is to turn all Stanford
students into "world citizens." Indeed,
this is what his goal should be as the mul
ticultural leader of this campus. While it is
important for members of the Stanford
community to co-exist well on campus
and maximize the utility of their differ
ences during their academic careers, in
the end, the greatest take-home value of
being at Stanford will be how to live well in
the world at large. Such an aim very much
involves the embracing of many cultures.
