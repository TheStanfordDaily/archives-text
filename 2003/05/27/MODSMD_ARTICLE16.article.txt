# Readily accessible books
## 
### 
The University recently has de
cided to make many books more
accessible by moving 3 million
volumes to the new SAL 111 fa
cility in Livermore over the next few
years. These books are currently being
stored in Stanford Auxiliary Library I or
11, or in off-campus storage.
The Livermore facility lies 33 miles
from the Stanford campus and is securely
situated above the 500-year flood plane.
Since Stanford's collection of books rivals
that of other universities', this move
makes a lot of sense. The new SAL 111 fa
cility, although at some distance from the
University itself, is a much safer and more
accessible location than the current stor
age centers. The new location will ensure
the safety of the books for future genera
tions of Stanford students.
In addition to books, the facility will also
store films, audio materials, papers and
maps. Stanford's first priority in the move
is to transfer the books that are presently in
off-campus storage, because Stanford will
save the most money from no longer hav

ing to pay storage costs. In addition to cut
ting costs, the move will also increase the
accessibility and retrieval efficiency of the
books for students. This will be achieved
first by a collections specialist from the li
brary checking each item to see that it does
not need to be accessible in the main li
brary stacks. The remaining books will
then be transferred to SAL 111 and stored
according to height and size in order to
conserve space. SAL Ill's temperature
will be maintained at 50 degrees, and the
humidity at 35 — a climate that extends
the life of paper by 244 years. In addition
to being a safer location, the new facility
will deliver all requested materials to cam
pus overnight — a short waiting period
compared to the old storage capabilities.
The books that fill the stacks at our
many libraries are the essential building
blocks of every student and faculty's aca
demic career. Thus, this move is both nec
essary and beneficial, and ensuring the
quality of these irreplaceable books will
benefit the students of Stanford for years
to come.
