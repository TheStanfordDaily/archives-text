# LYING IN THE GRASS
## California dreamin' 
### 
Sometimes the best part of
the day is the moment just
before I fall asleep, when
I'm sprawled out on my
bed and my half-conscious mind
is free to wander lackadaisically
amid a sea of thoughts about the
future. Delusions of Caribbean
vacations, Victoria's Secret mod
els and overflowing wealth imbue
my consciousness — infusing me
with the pleasure of the
unattainable—just before the
Sandman finally lulls me into
deep slumber.
Once in awhile, though, one of
my seemingly innocuous made
for-Hollywood concoctions will
permanently lodge itself in my
head and catalyze a cascade of
other ideas and emotions, until my
brain becomes lost in a swirling
mess of thoughts. At moments like
these, I wake up startled and con
fused, my pillowcase drenched in
cold sweat. As a Stanford student,
I'm not supposed to have these
kinds of nightmares. I've pre
pared so much and oh-so-careful
ly mapped out the course of my lite
for the next couple of years. Yet I
am powerless to stop these noctur
nal hobgoblins from heckling me
with recurring doubts about the
future.
For many people here, grand
dreams are frothing beneath the
surface, just waiting to burst forth
in a supernova of realized hopes
and ambitions. We identify with
the journeys of fictional heroes
such as Neo, Harry Potter and
Frodo Baggins because we vicari
ously revel in their glorious success
when they save the world —we
want to be like them and have our
accomplishments indelibly inked
in the annals of history. At the very
least, we dream big because we're
like Bill Watterson's Calvin, who,
unsatisfied with the present reali
ty, wished he were Spaceman Spiff
just to escape it all.

Where will your aspirations ul
timately take you? At Stanford
I've met plenty of high rollers
who want to be U.S. senators,
Supreme Court justices, CEOs,
Olympic gold medalists, Nobel
Prize winners — you name it,
we've got it. If our illustrious
alumni are any indication, then a
lucky few of us will see our

dreams material
ize into reality.
Some, however,
won't make it.
Therein lies
the double-edged
sword of such
headstrong ambi
tion. Although it
gives us the moti
vation to pursue

these star-reaching goals, accom
plishing them merely results in
temporary contentment as we set
our eyes on the next task to con
quer. The alternative — failure —
is infinitely worse, capable of in
ducing a cesspool of self-pity and
resentment. Stanford selected and
nurtured us in part because of our
utter hatred of failure. Within the
confines of its hallowed class
rooms, one of Stanford's goals is to
produce the next generation of
American leaders — an ambitious
purpose, if only to match an equal
ly ambitious student body.
But I, for one, am not a leader.
Nor do I want to be. Coming
here, I've realized that there will
always be a higher status to attain
— and a person more accom
plished competing against me for
that spot. My idealistic notions of
the future, then, are slightly dif
ferent from what they used to be.
Down the line, I want a house
and a medical practice in a Los
Angeles suburb, where my family
can have Sunday barbecues in
the park. Given free time, I want
to live out my National Geo
graphic fantasies, absorbing cul

tures and customs the world
over. When I retire, I want to buy
up a lot along the craggy New
England coastline, a quiet place
where I'll be able to read maga
zines and books and
newspapers — and maybe, just
maybe, contribute some of my
own pieces to the literature.
In a sense, my current dreams
are a consequence of my failure to
keep up with the great rat race.
Yet I've dealt with any associated
pessimism with something far
more powerful: contentment
with the Stanford status quo. This
satisfaction, of course, must be
taken with a grain of salt. Obtain
ing a medical degree, by itself, is
the fulfillment of a dream. At
Stanford, however, ultimately at
taining our target profession is
highly probable. So our sense of
the status quo is slightly skewed
relative to, say, the general popu
lace. Peering far into the future,
some Stanford grads will become
the leaders of international
human rights groups, perhaps
battling their business-minded
classmates, who are at the helm of
the World Bank. Nevertheless, I
draw the line at the M.D. The
game has to end somewhere, or
else I'd go nuts if I deluded myself
into thinking that there is always a
higher level to reach.
But that doesn't mean I still
can't daydream about my person
al Camelot. This summer, while
I'm idly lying at the beach, I'll con
template what it's like to be Bill
Gates, President Bush and Hugh
Hefner, all rolled into one. And I'll
smile at the wonderful repercus
sions my meandering mind con
jures up — at least, until a seagull
flies by, plops some turd on my
head and rudely awakens me to
reality.
