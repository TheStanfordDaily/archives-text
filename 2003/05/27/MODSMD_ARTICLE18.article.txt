# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Senior Gift allows Stanford to thrive as renowned institution 
### WELLS BULLARD DAN OROS GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Every morning, Stanford students walk
to class passing beautifully manicured
lawns, imported palm trees and colorful
flowerbeds. With all of this seeming
wealth, for the past year the Senior Gift
Committee has been mailing, calling, ask
ing, and even begging the Class of 2003 to
give a gift to The Stanford Fund for Un
dergraduate Education. To many, it just
doesn't seem to make sense to make a do
nation. Let's see if we can answer some of
your questions.
I thought Stanford had $8 billion, and you're
asking me fora gift?
Stanford does have an endowment fund
worth around $8 billion. This definitely
puts us in the big leagues in terms of U.S. in
stitutions of higher education. For refer
ence, as of August 31, 2002, Harvard's en
dowment was $17.2 billion, Yale had $10.5
billion and Princeton had $8.3 billion. Gen
erally, endowment funds will pay out
around 5 percent of its value every year, so
that the principal will last into perpetuity.

At Stanford, this payout covers only 17.7
percent of Stanford's operating expenses.
Thus, Stanford must generate more than
80 percent of its budget — nearly $ 1.6 bil
lion every year — from government grants
and contracts, student tuition and fees,
non-government grants, and gifts from
alumni, parents, and friends. Harvard's
payout provides 32 percent of its budget,
Yale's provides 28 percent, and Princeton's
provides 37 percent. Yes, we have a big en
dowment, but when compared to the size
and scope of our programs, we are relative
ly under-endowed.
Furthermore, endowment payouts gen
erally have a restricted purpose, set by their
donor. Remember the rumor that the
donor who gave the money to build FloMo
required that ice cream lie provided at every
meal? We don't know if that's true or not,
but that is the concept of restricted gifts.
Where the endowment payout ends,
The Stanford Fund for Undergraduate
Education comes in. The Stanford Fund is
an "annual" fund, meaning that gifts are
spent in the same year they are received.
This money, about $15 million last year, is

a discretionary fund that gives the Univer
sity president and provost the financial
flexibility to meet basic undergraduate
needs and launch new academic initia
tives. The money from The Stanford
Fund is used only for undergraduate edu
cation programs and scholarships and is
generally split evenly between these two
areas. Many of us have written letters as
part of the Partnership Program, where
student groups can receive funding by
helping thank the donors. The Stanford
Fund gives out over 1,000 scholarships,
supports programs like Freshman and
Sophomore Seminars and Overseas Stud
ies and supports over 150 student groups
and organizations. That's where your
money is going.
Isn't my donation just a drof) in the bucket?
Last year, gifts of $ 100 or less to The
Stanford Fund added up to over $2 million
for undergraduate education. Small gifts
do help and collectively they make a huge
difference. Plus, for this year's Senior Gift
campaign, the Class of 2003 has a special
boost. Dr. Peter Bing, along with the Par
ents' Advisory Board, has pledged match

ing funds for gifts above $20. Combined,
each gift of $20 or more is matched 3 to 1.
Your $20 gift turns into $80, and so on.
Haven't I given Stanford enough of my
money?
It's true. A Stanford education isn't
cheap. Our families have made many sac
rifices for us to be here. But aside from the
diplomas we will receive on June 15
declaring us Stanford graduates, we also
walk away with an experience that is com
pletely unique. We have experienced this
life-defining time as individuals and as a
class. As individuals, we are about to set
off on new and exciting paths. As a class
we will continue to make our impact on
the Stanford experience and the world
with our many successes. We can recog
nize our class unity by contributing to our
Senior Gift campaign and measure our
success by the percentage of the Class of
2003 who participate, at any level, in the
campaign. Our collective support enables
future students to enjoy the many oppor
tunities and life shaping experiences that
we value so much.
You've already sent us letters, called us, and

solicited us in White Plaza.. Why are you writing
this column ?
As oflast Friday, 381 seniors have made
a donation to Senior Gift. That is 23 per
cent of our class. With matching funds, that
adds up to $45,000. We are thrilled that
one out of every five people in our class has
made a gift, but we can do better. Fora
comparison, the Senior Gift Campaign at
Harvard has received donations from 70
percent of the Class of 2003 and Princeton
has a goal of 75 percent. We only have
about two weeks left here on the Farm, and
the Senior Gift Campaign ends on June 5.
After four years, some of us are ready to
leave; others of us wish we never had to go.
We can help ensure that Stanford contin
ues to be such a wonderful place. That
should make us feel really good.
