## Freshman wins championship Liu claims NCAA title 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
With a win on Saturday in the finals of the
NCAA Individual Championships, Vilmarie
Castellvi would have completed a stellar career
at the University of Tennessee with a national
singles title and finished her senior season with
a daunting 46-4 singles mark.
However, there was one hitch in the plan of
the top-ranked senior — Stanford freshman
Amber Liu.
At the Ring Tennis Complex in Gainesville,
Florida, the fifth-seeded Liu fought back from a
first-set deficit to claim the national singles title,
7-6 (5), 6-2.
Liu had defeated Castellvi in the first tour
nament of the year — a 6-2, 6-4 win at the ITA
Women's Ail-American Championships on
Oct. 11 — but the Tennessee senior had
downed Liu twice since then, including a 6-4,6-
3 win on Jan. 19 in the finals of the Tennis Kick
off Classic.
But this was Liu's tournament, and the suc
cess and momentum that she carried into the
match overwhelmed the top-seeded Castellvi.
Down 5-3 in the first set, Liu managed to
break her Lady Vol opponent and hold serve to
tie the match at five games apiece. After both
players failed to hold serve, Castellvi jumped to
a 1-0 lead in the tiebreaker. But Liu proved too
strong and well-prepared and won the
tiebreaker, 7-5.
After a confidence-building first-set victory
Liu opened a second-set lead and never let up
on her opponent, taking the set 6-2.
"I felt like the momentum shifted towards
me the second set," Liu said. "I relaxed a little
and was able to keep going for my shots."
Although she was facing a senior and had
never played in an NCAA final before, Liu con
tained her nervousness and stuck to her
strengths on the court.
"I think everyone has a little bit of nerves
going into the big matches," Liu said. "You just

learn to use them to fire you up to play well
rather than letting them affect your play."
The freshman reached the finals with a 7-5,
6-0 defeat of Jewel Peterson of Southern Cali
fornia on Friday — a familiar Pacific-10 Con
ference foe that Liu had downed twice previ
ously during the regular season.
"It is always nice to have played your oppo
nent before because you are already familiar
with her strengths and weaknesses," Liu said.
"But regardless of whether you have beaten the
girl before, you still have to come out each
match ready to fight."

Liu dominated her opponents in both the
team and individual tournaments and dropped
just one set in her 12 singles matches through
out the duration of the competition, which
began for Liu on May 9 at Stanford.
Despite the length of the tournament, Liu
was able to overcome fatigue and continue her
strong play.
"I actually felt like the team event was more
emotionally and physically taxing. You play
doubles before singles, and you want to win so
