## Freshman wins championship Liu claims NCAA title 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
With a win on Saturday in the finals of the
NCAA Individual Championships, Vilmarie
Castellvi would have completed a stellar career
at the University of Tennessee with a national
singles title and finished her senior season with
a daunting 46-4 singles mark.
However, there was one hitch in the plan of
the top-ranked senior — Stanford freshman
Amber Liu.
At the Ring Tennis Complex in Gainesville,
Florida, the fifth-seeded Liu fought back from a
first-set deficit to claim the national singles title,
7-6 (5), 6-2.
Liu had defeated Castellvi in the first tour
nament of the year — a 6-2, 6-4 win at the ITA
Women's Ail-American Championships on
Oct. 11 — but the Tennessee senior had
downed Liu twice since then, including a 6-4,6-
3 win on Jan. 19 in the finals of the Tennis Kick
off Classic.
But this was Liu's tournament, and the suc
cess and momentum that she carried into the
match overwhelmed the top-seeded Castellvi.
Down 5-3 in the first set, Liu managed to
break her Lady Vol opponent and hold serve to
tie the match at five games apiece. After both
players failed to hold serve, Castellvi jumped to
a 1-0 lead in the tiebreaker. But Liu proved too
strong and well-prepared and won the
tiebreaker, 7-5.
After a confidence-building first-set victory
Liu opened a second-set lead and never let up
on her opponent, taking the set 6-2.
"I felt like the momentum shifted towards
me the second set," Liu said. "I relaxed a little
and was able to keep going for my shots."
Although she was facing a senior and had
never played in an NCAA final before, Liu con
tained her nervousness and stuck to her
strengths on the court.
"I think everyone has a little bit of nerves
going into the big matches," Liu said. "You just

learn to use them to fire you up to play well
rather than letting them affect your play."
The freshman reached the finals with a 7-5,
6-0 defeat of Jewel Peterson of Southern Cali
fornia on Friday — a familiar Pacific-10 Con
ference foe that Liu had downed twice previ
ously during the regular season.
"It is always nice to have played your oppo
nent before because you are already familiar
with her strengths and weaknesses," Liu said.
"But regardless of whether you have beaten the
girl before, you still have to come out each
match ready to fight."

Liu dominated her opponents in both the
team and individual tournaments and dropped
just one set in her 12 singles matches through
out the duration of the competition, which
began for Liu on May 9 at Stanford.
Despite the length of the tournament, Liu
was able to overcome fatigue and continue her
strong play.
"I actually felt like the team event was more
emotionally and physically taxing. You play
doubles before singles, and you want to win so

badly for your team.
"In the individual event I just
took one match at a time, and
didn't look too far ahead. After my
matches I had the remainder of
the day to rest."
The victory was important not
only for Liu but for the Stanford
tennis team as a whole. After win
ning two consecutive team cham
pionships the squad dropped a 4-
3 battle to Florida last Sunday, and
the No. 1 Cardinal doubles team of
juniors Lauren Barnikow and
Erin Burdette fell in the quarterfi
nals of the doubles tournament.
Liu's victory ensured that one of

the preeminent tennis programs
in the nation would not return
empty-handed, however.
"The team loss was definitely
something I had never experienced
before — it was so emotional and
painful for all of us, especially the
freshmen," Liu said. "I'm just glad
that I was able to somehow come
back and play hard the next day."
Alter dominating a field loaded
with the top collegiate players in
the nation, the future seems ex
tremely for the freshman. Liu,
who has already had some experi
ence on the pro tour and is cur
rently ranked No. 447 in the world
by the WTA, will look to weigh all
possible options.
"I will see how I do in some pro
tournaments this summer and go
from there," she said.
