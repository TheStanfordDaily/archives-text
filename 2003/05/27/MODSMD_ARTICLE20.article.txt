# Baseball seeded No. 6 in College World Series
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many observers believe that the
2003 Stanford offense is the best to
fill head coach Mark Marquess' line
up card in years. After the NCAA
Tournament Selection Committee
placed three of the nation's best
pitchers on the Cardinal's road to
Omaha, it better be.
With the 64-team field's announce
ment yesterday morning came news
of both rewarding and troubling vari
eties for Stanford, a combinatk >n that is
slowly becoming a tradition at this time
of year. On the positive side, die Pacif
ic* 10 Conference champion Cardinal
(41-15) received a No. 6 national seed,
securing home field advantage
throughout the postseason until the
College World Series.
But while Stanford will play all of
its regional and super regional
games at Sunken Diamond for the
fifth consecutive season, making a
fifth-straight trip to Omaha will not
be easy. The Cardinal—the top seed
in its regional — will host second
seeded Richmond (46-13), No. 3
UC-Riverside (40-15) and No. 4 Illi
nois-Chicago (39-16) in a double
elimination tournament beginning
Friday afternoon.
Stanford plays UIC in its first con
test Friday night and would play
Richmond on Saturday ifboth teams
advance as expected. An unlucky
scenario could see the Spiders' top
hurler, junior Tim Stauffer, sit out
the team's Friday game in anticipa
tion of a matchup with one of the na
tion's best lineups. Stauffer, a pro
jected top-five pick in the upcoming
Major League Baseball draft, went 9-
4 with a dazzling 1.87 ERA and a
downright frightening 135-to-16
strikeout-to-walk ratio this season.

While holding out their ace
against a solid Riverside ballclub has
its risks, the Spiders may be in a posi
tion to gamble. They have a pair of 9-
1 starters that could take his place
and force Stanford to beat their best
in die all-important winners' game
on Saturday.
If the Cardinal does emerge from
its regional, whether or not it must go
through Stauffer, more big arms
await in the super regional round.

The Dirtbags are one of the most
dangerous teams in the country to
face in a three-game series, as their
rotation boasts two of the nation's
pitching elite in 13-3 Jared Weaver
and 10-1 Abe Alvarez.
Stanford does have its own potent
1-2 combination in junior John
Hudgins and freshman Mark Ro
manczuk, but without question both
the regional and super regional
rounds will provide a daunting chal

straight trip to Omaha.
The Pac-10 will send only four
teams to the tournament, as Arizona

first time since 1992.
For the second straight year,
Florida State received the top na

State, Georgia Tech and Auburn.

the national bids, with Rice, Stan
