# Tennis loses two of its senior stars
## 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
This weekend marked the end of an
era for the No. 4 Stanford (25-4) men's
tennis team. Senior Ail-Americans David
Martin and Scott Lipsky played in their
final collegiate match on Sunday when
they lost in the semifinals of the NCAA
Doubles Championships at the Universi
ty of Georgia.
For the third consecutive year, Martin
and Lipsky reached at least the semifi
nals. The No. 4 ranked pair lost 6-4, 6-4
to San Diego State's No. 2 duo of Oliver
Maiberger and Ryan Redondo.
"They volleyed really well," Lipsky
said. "They didn't give us many chances
to break their serve. We had a couple
chances early in the match, but we didn't
take advantage of them.
"We came out a little flat and that was
a problem. They just didn't make any
mistakes to let us get into the match. They
controlled their service games better than
we did."
Maiberger and Redondo lost in the fi
nals to Illinois' Rajeev Ram and Brian
Wilson. The 2003 NCAA championships
belonged to Illinois as the Fighting Illini

completed college tennis' "triple crow" by
winning the team, doubles and singles ti
tles. Amer Delic won the singles. En route
to the semifinals, Martin and Lipsky took
out Georgia's No. 12 Nicholas Boeker
and Bo Hodge 6-2, 6-3 in the second
round and Pepperdine's No. 6 Diego
Acuna and Calle Hansen 6-1, 6-7, 6-1 in
the quarterfinals.
How do Martin and Lipsky feel about
the conclusion to their careers?
"It's a little bittersweet," Lipsky said.
"Getting to the semifinals three years in a
row is an unbelievable accomplishment.
It's awesome that we were able to do that
and it's a great feeling to be an All-Amer
ican for the third year in a row.
"But it's disappointing because we fell
short of winning one more time. We had
a really good chance to win because we
were playing well and I would have liked
to go out with a win. But overall I'm
happy with how things turned out."
Freshman KC Corkery's impressive
run in the NCAA singles tournament
ended two days earlier. After beating No.
9 Jesse Witten from Kentucky 6-1, 6-0 to
gain Ail-American status in the second
round, Corkery lost 6-4, 7-6 to No. 2
Benedikt Dorsch in the third round.

"KC was right with Dorsch the whole
way," head coach Dick Gould said. "After
watching that match, it convinced me
that KC has the ability to step up and play
No. 1 next year."
Dorsch made it all the way to the finals
before losing to Delic.
While Corkery can look forward to
next year to continue to make his mark
on the venerable Stanford tennis tradi
tion, Martin and Lipsky can only look
back. Both will graduate with a degree in
American Studies in June.
"They'll be sorely missed," Whitlinger
said. "They've both been consistent per
formers in singles and doubles and they'll
be hard acts to follow.
"They've been great team leaders and
they're great people. I can't say enough
about what they have meant to the team
over the last four years."
Gould believes Martin and Lipsky are
leaving the Farm as far better players
than when they arrived.
"When I recruited David 1 was told by
a couple of people that he would be a
great player down the line at four, five
and six singles positions," Gould said.

The No. 4 ranked duo of seniors David Martin (pictured) and Scott Lipsky ended their tremen

"Yet he's gone on to reach the

"Lip has a wealth of natural
