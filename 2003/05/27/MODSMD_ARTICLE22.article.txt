# Mustangs swept at Sunken Diamond
## 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Sunday, not only did the Cardinal
baseball team complete a sweep of the
Cal Poly Mustangs, but it also learned
that it would host a regional in the NCAA
Tournament.
The two events coincided perfectly:
the Cardinal closed its regular season
with a dominant performance and will
enter the playoffs with home-field advan
tage.
"I'm pretty excited about us hosting
the NCAA Regionals," said senior Ryan
Garko. "It was our goal to win the Pac-10
championship and get an opportunity to
do this. It's really important to be playing
your best baseball heading into the post
season, and I think we're doing that right
now."
With 9-4, 12-0 and 8-4 wins in Friday
through Sunday's games, respectively, as
well as 13 wins in its last 14 games,
Garko's assessment of the team's play

seems well justified.
Junior John Hudgins, who got back
on track last weekend with a one-run
complete game against UCLA, again ap
peared in top form in his Friday outing.
Hudgins scattered just three hits and one
run over six innings to earn the win.
The Cardinal bats produced 13 hits,
three of them coming from junior Brian
Hall for his fourth consecutive three-hit
game. Hall also recorded his 15th stolen
base of the year, a season-high.
Saturday's game was even more one
sided and included the Cardinal's second
triple play of the year.
Few players see a triple play in their
entire collegiate career. The number of
pitchers who get bailed out of a jam with
a triple play is lower still. You'd have to
dig up the record books to find a pitcher
who received the benefit of two triple
plays in the same season. Freshman
Mark Romanczuk, who witnessed a triple
play while on the hill against USC in
March, watched his infield do it again in

the first inning of Saturday's game. Cal
Poly's Adam Leavitt lined out to fresh
man John Mayberry Jr. on a hit-and-run
that went horribly wrong.
The triple play was certainly helpful
and stopped a potential early Mustang
rally, but Romanczuk didn't appear to
need much further assistance for the rest
of the game. He struck out eight while al
lowing just four hits and no runs in six in
nings. Freshman Matt Manship held the
Mustangs scoreless for the remaining
three innings to complete the Cardinal's
12-0 blowout.
Junior Brian Hall, sophomore Danny
Putnam and Garko were teeing off
against the helpless Mustang pitching
staff, combining for nine hits and six
RBI.
Garko went 4-4, including a home run
and is now hitting .406 on the season,
which adds batting average to the list of
statistics in which he leads the team

After a satisfying final weekend of regular-season play in Sunken Diamond, senior catcher Ryan
Garko holds the highest batting average on the team at .406.
