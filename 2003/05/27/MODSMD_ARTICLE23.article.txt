### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the Stanford women's
golf team saved its best round for last
at last week's NCAA championship, it
was not enough to move the Cardinal
into contention. For the second con
secutive year, Stanford finished out
side of the top 10, wrapping up Friday
in 16th place out of 24 teams.
No. 3 Southern California swept
the awards ceremony, claiming both
team and individual titles. In the team
competition, the Women of Troy
jumped out to an early lead and never
looked back, winning the program's
first national championship by 15
strokes over No. 4 Pepperdine.
"We peaked at the right time and
played our hearts out the last seven
rounds (including the NCAA West
Regional Championships)," said USC
head coach Andrea Gaston. "Obvious
ly, we're extremely happy to bring
home the national championship."
(JSC's senior standout Mikaela
Parmlid took top individual honors
after defeating Florida's Andrea Van
der Lende in a sudden-death playoff.
With her 9-over par total of 297 made
her only the second female golfer to
hoist the NCAA trophy for USC.
"This is a great way to go out,"
Parmlid said. "I wanted this so much
for the team and for the school. This is
very special."
This year's championship was a
stiff test of golf. Competition took

place at the Kampen Course of the
Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex in
West Lafayette, Ind. The par-72
6,225-yard track was a challenging
one, and windy conditions the first
two days rrtade heavy demands on the
players.
"It was very windy and rainy on the
first day," freshman Kelly Husted
said. "But the conditions improved as
the week went on."
The Cardinal clearly struggled
with the difficult environment in the
early going, shooting rounds of 316
and 321 during the first two days of
competition. These scores sent Stan
ford sliding down the leader board,
and the team trailed front-running
USC by 29 shots by the end of the sec
ond round.
Although Stanford's play during
the first two days wasn't exceedingly
poor, the team dropped enough
strokes to put itself out of contention
for the final 36 holes.
"We gave strokes away on big num
bers," sophomore Wendra Liang said.
"That's something you can't afford to
do when you have to work so hard for
pars and birdies."
Stanford fared much better on the
third day, posting a 19-over par 307.
By this time, however, the Cardinal
was already buried near the bottom of
the standings and could only move up
a single spot into 18th place overall.
The Cardinal played its best golf in
the final round, but it was too little
and too late. Senior Kim Rowton fired

a 3-over par 75 on Friday, but her
round did not stand up in the best
scoring conditions of the week. Row
ton finished her college career with a
28th-place showing individually.
Junior Angela Rho matched Row
ton's final-round score, but made little
headway in the final standings. Rho
finished tied for 66th place overall.
Fellow junior Kim Kouwabunpat
followed up her 73 on Thursday with
a 76 in Friday's final round. Her total
of 314 was 26 shots over par and land
ed her in a tie for 73rd place.
Freshman Kelly Husted recorded
her best round of the tournament in
her final 18 holes, shooting 75. She
Finished her first NCAA champi
onship with a total of 321 â€” good
enough for 88th place.
Liang rounded out the scoring for
Stanford on Friday. Her 10-over par
82 dropped her back down the leader
board into a tie for 102 nd individual
ty-
"We all know that our perfor
mance this year didn't reflect the tal
ent and hard work of this team. We
have two great freshmen coming in
next year, but we'll be losing Kim
Rowton, who has led and even carried
the team on numerous occasions."
Despite its 16th-place finish at the
national championship, Stanford con
cludes the year ranked 26th in the
country by Golfweek magazine.
"I think we all know that we'll need
to work hard and step it up next
year," Liang said.
