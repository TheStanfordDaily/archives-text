Besides juggling papers, problem sets and
senior theses, Stanford students have yet anoth
er activity to schedule into their weekends —
intramural sports. This spring, between 2,000
to 2,500 students are winding up their seasons
in soccer, softball, volleyball, tennis and bad
minton.
Teams are usually comprised of dormmates,
fraternity brothers, graduate students or old
friends.
"Mostly freshman dorms participate, espe
cially under their own names," said Student Di
rector Jeremy Marcus, as junior. "Often other
dorms do too, but call themselves something
more creative than 'Otero' or whichever dorm it
is, so it's hard to tell who they are. Upperclass
men usually play with friends or sometimes re
unions of old dorms."
Intramural sports at Stanford are divided
into three divisions: 1,2 and coed. The divisions
vary in their level of difficulty and competitive
ness.
Faisan IM representative Luke Daley, a
sophomore, said, "Division 1 is really competi
tive — the really intense people go there. Divi
sion 2 kind of depends on the teams; some of
them like are pretty laid back."
Training does not play a huge role in the IM

sports culture.
"Some teams do practice and train, but most
do not," said Intramural Director Jay Jackson.
"Typically, the teams that train are graduate stu
dents and some undergraduate groups. Peren
nially, the Business School fields solid IM teams.
Among the undergraduates, SAE is spoiling
some hot teams."
Marcus agreed.
"The teams that are notorious for 'training'
are the gi ad school teams. They are the most in
tense, especially the Business School and Law
School," he said. Other undergraduates ac
knowledge the prowess of the fraternity and
graduate student teams but do not look favor
ably upon their intensity.
"Fraternity teams are usually pretty good,
grad students are also a pain," Daley said.
However, intense rivalries do not usually
form between IM teams.
"Teams only play each other once a year, so
it's hard to get a real rivalry going, and most
teams change from year to year," Marcus said.
"Sometimes fraternities have a rivalry going, but
I don't think that starts on the IM fields, [it] just
gets played out there."
Part of the reason for the general laid-back at
titude to IM sports are the other commitments
that students have.
"It's easy to get people to say they want to
play, it's another thing to get them to show up

for the actual games," Daley said. "Everyone
always says 'homework.' It's kind of hard to
have team spirit when you don't know who's
going to show up from week to week."
One of the problems with the IM sports pro
gram is the low percentage of female participa
tion. Though many women participate in the
coed teams since hall the team has to be female,
they are not often found playing in Division 1 or
Division 2 teams.
"I think a lower percentage played sports in
high school so fewer of them have experience
with sports and those who haven't played them
before don't seem to have that much interest,"
Daley said. "Fewer women seem interested in
playing sports, whether it's a random pickup
game or a coed team."
Daley also complained about the referees of
IM games.
"In basketball, there aren't any, and in foot
ball they don't seem to know what they're
doing," he said. "In soccer they just don't have
enough. Sometimes they're competent, some
times they're not."
Daley suggested creating a Division 3 to en
courage more people to participate in IM sports.
"People get tired of losing even in Division 2,
it's kind of discouraging."
However, he stressed that I Ms were a positive
experience in that they offered students exercise
and a chance for group bonding.
