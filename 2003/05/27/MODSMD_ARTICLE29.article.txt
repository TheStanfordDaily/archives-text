# Constitutional Council rules on election cases
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Constitutional Council ruled in
favor of senior Henry Towsner on May 1 in two
suits he had pursued, one against the ASSU Elec
tions Commission and the other against Vien
nese Ball. The verdicts will affect ASSU enforce
ment of fliering and the practices of organiza
tions applying for special fees.
In the first case, Towsner claimed that the
Elections Commission had violated the ASSU
Constitution by promising to report students for
campaign infractions, specifically fliering in areas
where the University said it was illegal to flier.
A revised version of the Campaign Practice
Code of the Elections Commission stipulates that
"violations of the policies and guidelines con
tained herein will be noted by the Elections Com
mission and will be brought to the attention of the
relevant University bodies, who will address
them at their discretion."
Towsner said that the ASSU Constitution pro
hibits the organization from enforcing rules that
its organizing documents prohibit it from enact
ing, which in this case includes restricting fliering
because of a prior ruling preventing the ASSU
from prohibiting free speech in any way. He cited
a case brought to the council three years ago that
ruled that the Constitution prohibits the ASSU

from restricting free speech, including fliering.
"Three years ago, in the last challenged elec
tion, we made commitments that mistakes that
happened would not happen again," he said.
"We wanted to get rid of the problem now before
someone affiliated with one of the candidates had
to challenge the election."
Junior Eleanor Williams, the ASSU's elections
commissioner, said that the fact that the Elections
Commission was set up so late in the year caused
the difficulties Towsner brought to light.
The election will not be overturned, but next
year the Campaign Practice Code will be
changed to solve the problems, and the ASSU will
not be able to vow to enforce rules that violate its
Constitution.
In the second case, Towsner questioned the
practices of the Viennese Ball because he be
lieved that an organization receiving special fees
cannot charge students for its services.
His argument was based on the section of the
ASSU Constitution that reads, "Student organi
zations that receive a special fee may not deprive
any member of the Association of any or all of its
services unless that member has obtained a re
fund of that organization's fee."
Towsner argued, "Viennese Ball has to
choose between charging students for entry [to
the ball] and special fee money."
Statements filed bv Howard Shen on behalf of

the Viennese Ball claimed that the ball's program
to give students free tickets in exchange either for
working on the Viennese Ball Committee or for
working a few hours the night of the event effec
tively allow all students to attend the event. Addi
tionally, Shen claimed that the service the Vien
nese Ball Committee was providing to students
via special-fee funding was the opportunity to
buy tickets for the event â€” a service that the com
mittee provided free to all students.
A final part of the Viennese Ball Committee's
argument, according to Constitutional Council
Chair Bill Curry, was that a number of other
groups were essentially charging students for ad
mission in addition to special fees.
However, Curry said, "Just because a lot of
groups violate the Constitution does not make it
constitutional."
In addition to these two cases, only one other
case came before the Constitutional Council this
year. The case, pursued jointly by Towsner and
former Daily Editor in Chief Mark Boucher, was
dropped once die two reached an agreement
with Stanford Student Enterprises to release fi
nancial records to The Daily and The Stanford
Review.
Said Curry, "Now that Henry's graduating,
there's going to be a significant drop in the
number of cases heard by the Constitutional
Council."
