### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over 2,200 people from the Universi

part in the Stanford Relay For Life on Fri
day and Saturday at the Stanford Stadi
um; the annual 18-hour event aims to
raise awareness about cancer and
fundraise to research its cure.
Teams of 10 to 20 members collected
contributions before the relay. During
the event, team members took turns run
ning around the track and participating
in a number of other activities, such as

performances by student groups and a
session about several types of cancer at the
Stanford Medical Center.
"The event raised $57,060.90 by the
time of closing ceremonies," said co-orga
nizer Mykel Kochenderfer, a coterminal
student in computer science. "More do
nations have come in since then and we
anticipate a significantly larger sum to be
donated to the American Cancer Society
to fulfill their mission to save lives, reduce
the incidence of cancer and impact the
quality of life of cancer patients through
research, education and service."
Top fundraisers were Castilleja High

School, a local all-girls private school that
raised $6,443.79, the Belmont Hillbillies,
who raised $5,350, and Donner, which
raised $4,244.
Some activities and participants fo
cused on celebrating cancer survivors in
the community.
A special dinner was held for survivors,
including sophomore Jonathan Chou,
who was diagnosed with cancer last year
and took off winter quarter to undergo
chemotherapy.
Castano's theme was "Castano Loves
