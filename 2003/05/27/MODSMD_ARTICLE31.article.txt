# Tufts re-evaluates minority programs
## 
### KEITH BARRY TUFTS DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MEDFORD, Mass. â€”Conservative
groups are claiming victory after Tufts University has
made changes to the description of two of its medical
school programs that were accused of race-based ad
missions processes and violations of Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act.
No details have been provided by Tufts whether
the actual policy of the programs has been changed, or
if the University simply changed their descriptions.
Regardless, the conservative groups who chal
lenged the programs' legality have declared victory
with the University's decision.
"I'm thrilled and gratified," said Edward Blum, a
representative and lawyer with the Center for Equal
Opportunity. "You guys gave in."
The response from Tufts comes at a time when
affirmative action admissions and minority-only
programs are being challenged throughout the
country.
In late April, Tufts University General Counsel
Mary Lee Jacobs responded to the center with a letter
which acknowledged that the Web site descriptions of
the programs could be in violation of Title VI.
"The university has carefully reviewed the Web
sites referenced in you letter," Jacobs wrote in a center
provided e-mail. " The Web sites have been revised
and a number of changes have been made, including
the deletion of language that could be considered to be

in conflict with the requirements of Title VI."
Jacobs could not be reached for comment , but it ap
pears the Web site's language has changed. The Post
Baccalaureate Research Program's admission require
ments formerly stated that "this non-degree program
is open to minority candidates." The program is now
inclusive of "underrepresented minorities." The site
lists what groups that phrase could include, but now
also clarifies that it is not limited to that list.
Especially important is the explicit mention of
"members of economically disadvantaged families,"
which means that the programs could no longer be
considered based on race.
In a March 27 cease and desist order, conservative
groups the Center for Equal Opportunity and the
American Civil Rights Institute challenged the legiti
macy of the Tufts medical school's PREP and Minori
ty Externship program. Though Tufts earlier indicat
ed it was not planning any changes before the Apr. 21
deadline it was given in the order, it appears that ac
tion has been taken to change the programs.
The lobbying groups contend that the language
that details admission eligibility is in violation of Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states that no
person be discriminated against "on the ground of
race, color, or national origin" by any program which
receives federal funding. Both programs at the med
ical school are funded in part through the National In
stitutes of Health.
This new stance comes in sharp contrast to the ini
tial reaction to the cease and desist order.
