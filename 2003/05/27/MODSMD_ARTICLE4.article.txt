### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
The University awarded seven international
journalists with John S. Knight Fellowships ear
lier this month, which will allow them to study at
Stanford during the next academic year. This
year's winners hail from as far away as the
Ukraine and South Korea.
"1 am of course looking forward to spending
a year furthering my expertise and exploring
new fields, trying to immerse myself in Stanford
and to make the best out of the incredible brain
power of the University," said Bruno Giussani,
a freelance writer from Switzerland. "As a jour
nalist constantly confronted with deadlines and
even faster news cycles, I am looking forward to
being able to step back fora moment and look at
things from a different angle."
In addition to Giussani, the newly chosen fel
lows are: Azmat Abbas from Pakistan; Pablo
Rosendo Gonzalez, a special projects editor
from Argentina; Yuki Kanda, a staff writer from
Japan; Mika Makelainen, a foreign reporter for
Finnish broadcasting; YongChan Park, a senior
reporter from Seoul, Korea; and Olena Prytula,
editor in chief and owner of a Web-based publi
cation. Prytula is the first journalist to be select
ed for the program from the Ukraine.
During their time on campus, these fellows
will be permitted to take classes offered by all de
partments, including pre-professional pro
grams in law, medicine and business.
Journalists who apply for the fellowship must
outline their plans and personal goals for their
year at Stanford as well as describe how their ex
perience would aid in their careers.
"Those seeking fellowships must apply and
they must have the backing of their news edu-
cation as well," said Communica
tion Prof. Jim Bettinger, director
of the Knight Fellowships pro
gram. "Their news organizations
give them a leave of absence to
participate in the program, and
they return at the end of their fel
lowship."
The seven international fellows
were selected by Bettinger and
Dawn Garcia, the program's
deputy director.
The Knight program also select
ed 12 fellows from across the Unit
ed States at the beginning of May.
Once they arrive, fellows are free
to audit classes, exempt from taking

tests and writing required papers.
Yet, according to program admin
istrators, the majority of fellows "do
all or most of the work in some
classes as a way of challenging
themselves, but the decision is up to
them."
Fellows gain equal access to fac
ulty and staff as Stanford's current
students and also benefit from the
knowledge of former fellows.
Many of these journalists de
cide to tap faculty resources in
order to conduct directed read
ings on their immediate interests.
Some professors attempt to re
cruit Knight fellows who tend to
show intense interest in the course
material.
"Stanford values the program
because it gives the campus com
munity the chance to be exposed to

outstanding journalists from
around the world," Bettinger said.
"Knight fellows speak in classes, in
residence halls, at academic forums
and to community groups."
The Knight fellowships provide
winners with stipends, book and
housing allowances and tuition, in
addition to other amenities. The
program receives funding from the
John S. and James L. Knight Foun
dation, the Fulbright Program, the
Shinyoung Journalism Fund and
the Kouras Foundation.
Seven hundred journalists have
taken advantage of the experience
offered by the program since it
came into existence in 1966. Since
that time, former fellows have ad
vanced as writers and editors, gar
nering other prestigious awards,
including 23 Pulitzer prizes.
