## Home sweet home 
### JESSICA WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center Guest House, a new
building currently under construc
tion, will soon be offering lodging
for Commencement next month.
Although the Guest House is ex
pected to predominately house vis
iting scientists and researchers con
ducting experiments at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, it

is open to the entire Stanford com
munity.
Owned by Stanford University
and operated by Student Housing
Services, the 112-room lodging will
be open to guests on June 13, just
in time for graduation ceremonies
that weekend.
Groups that have already
booked reservations for the SLAC
Guest House include the Hoover
Institution Archive Project, Inter
national Gene Trap Workshop,

Next Linear Collider Collaboration
Meeting and Quarknet Workshop.
The Guest House includes a 24-
hour reception desk, a gift shop, an
exercise room, a kitchenette, laun
dry facilities, daily housekeeping
services and a lounge with a large
screen television.
Guest rooms are configured in
various sizes and bed types to ac
commodate the individual needs of
a wide range of guests. Each
room includes cable TV, Ether
net ports, a telephone, coffee
maker, desk, wardrobe, air-con
ditioning and a private bath
room. Mini-refrigerators, mi
crowave ovens, hair dryers and
roll-a-way beds also are available
upon request.
"After nine years in manage
ment with Hyatt Hotels and five
years with Student Housing Ser
vices at Stanford University, I am
very happy to be working on the
SLAC Guest House project," said
Enrique Jevons, general manag
er of the SLAC Guest House.
"Our guests will be able to check
rates, availability, see images of
various room types available and
make reservations online. Guests
may also have their room
charges direct billed to their
Stanford and SLAC accounts."

The decision to build a guest
house at the SLAC was made by
Jonathan Dorfan, director of
SLAC, after a feasibility study
was done in 1999 by Matthew
Allen, retired associate director
of SLAC.
The need for accommoda
tions on campus for academics

visiting Stanford will be met by
the new lodging, said Rodger
Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing Services.
"Currently, visiting scholars
and conference attendees stay in
a combination of campus hous
ing, short-term rentals or in local
hotels," Whitney said. "Even

with today's economy, room
rates are still some of the highest
in the country. Traffic and park
ing has also made travel to cam
pus tedious and time consuming.
"Providing comfortable and
affordable temporary housing
accommodations for visitors has
long been a concern for Stanford
University," he added. "The ad
dition of 112 overnight guest
rooms at the SLAC Guest House
will greatly assist in addressing
this issue."
Members of the Stanford com
munity are excited about the
idea of having a place for guests
to stay that is on campus, espe
cially with upcoming graduation
ceremony events.
"The SLAC Guest House
makes it extremely easy, conve
nient and affordable for Stan
ford grads and their families
spending a weekend enjoying
the Stanford campus and events
throughout the graduation
weekend," said senior Rodrigo
Lopez.

Construction is scheduled to finish in time for use this June.
