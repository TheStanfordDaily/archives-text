# ABM janitors meet to consider new contract
## 
### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Around 80 workers employed by Ameri
can Building Maintenance met on Thursday
with SEIU Local 1877 representatives to dis
cuss the outcome of the recently approved
contract between the union and ABM. The
contract will result in lower premiums for
health care benefits, recognition of seniority
and a $1 per hour raise increase for union
workers to be implemented over the life of
the contract.
The meeting was attended by workers,
unions representatives and students. While
there was some praise for the gains made for
workers in the new contract, others ex
pressed concern over the results.
Inmar Liborio, a union steward and ABM
worker, spoke to his co-workers about the
contract.

"Our triumph came with the [health] in
surance and the stability for the workers,"
Liborio said. "It's a very good triumph, se
niority is very important. Now a change in
company does not affect a change in salary
or benefits."
A week and a half ago, union workers
voted three to one to ratify the new contract.
Had an agreement not been reached, the
union would have moved to a vote on
whether to strike, after the previous contract
with ABM had expired at the end of April.
While lhe meeting itself did not involve
debate over the contract, many workers pre
sent at the meeting expressed reservations
about the process and the outcome of the ne
gotiations.
"We stay in the middle," said Rafael
Ramos, an ABM worker. "[ABM] really pays
us [for health benefits] with our
own wages [because] they aren't
giving us a raise. We had to accept
the contract or else the company
wouldn't have given us what we
wanted — they would have given
us something worse."
Junior Sofia Lee, a representa
tive of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition, said at the meeting that a

statement made by University
President John Hennessy on May
16 concerning health care for Stan
ford workers did not necessarily
exclude subcontracted employees.
"Hennessy's statement was am
biguous," Lee said. "We still need a
code of conduct that would pro
vide the same wages for the same
work."
In his statement, Hennessy
reaffirmed Stanford's hands-ofF
role in negotiations between sub
contractors and workers.
"The University has main

tained and will continue to main
tain a policy of non-interference
with regard to workers employed
by sub-contractors," Hennessy
said in the statement. "At the same
time, we recognize the critical im
portance of access to health care
for workers during the current
economic downturn.
"This recognition has led to
Stanford's efforts to moderate the
rise in cost of health care for our
own employees," he continued.
"Despite the challenging financial
atmosphere and a campus-wide

salary freeze, the University will
contribute additional funds in the
next year to lessen the impact of
those increases, particularly for
those employees who earn the
least."
SLAC maintains that Hen
nessy's statement includes subcon
tracted employees, who are typi
cally paid lower than University
employees. Chris Christofferson,
associate vice provost and director
of Facilities Operations, said that
the University plans to maintain its
policy of non-interference.
