As candidates for the 2004 presidential
election are starting to campaign across the
nation, many politically active students are
gearing up to create more open discussion
of the candidates and issues on campus,
and some students have already begun
lobbying for specific contenders.
Junior Brooke Fineberg, a member of
the Stanford Republicans, said that there
needs to be more cooperation between
groups around the elections.
"We'd like to work with the Stanford
Democrats to put together a panel to pre
sent a wide range of policy stances," she
said. "I'd really like to see the Stanford Re
publicans and Stanford Democrats coming
together to provide information to the stu

dents, so that the information is fair and
unbiased and so that students can make
educated decisions."
Mitchell Smith, who works as a staff
member at Stanford and is the liaison be
tween the California Green Party and the
Stanford Green Party, agreed.
"I would really like to see some cooper
ation between the three major parties [the
Democrats, Republicans and Greens] in
the form of a collaborative discussion
where the groups put forth what issues
they support and why," Smith said. "There
needs to be more cooperation in educating
students first."
Junior Andy Clavin, the founder of the
conservative Jewish-American Alliance,
also wants to increase the scope of campus
