# Groups prep for '04 races
## 
### SANDRA UPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As candidates for the 2004 presidential
election are starting to campaign across the
nation, many politically active students are
gearing up to create more open discussion
of the candidates and issues on campus,
and some students have already begun
lobbying for specific contenders.
Junior Brooke Fineberg, a member of
the Stanford Republicans, said that there
needs to be more cooperation between
groups around the elections.
"We'd like to work with the Stanford
Democrats to put together a panel to pre
sent a wide range of policy stances," she
said. "I'd really like to see the Stanford Re
publicans and Stanford Democrats coming
together to provide information to the stu

dents, so that the information is fair and
unbiased and so that students can make
educated decisions."
Mitchell Smith, who works as a staff
member at Stanford and is the liaison be
tween the California Green Party and the
Stanford Green Party, agreed.
"I would really like to see some cooper
ation between the three major parties [the
Democrats, Republicans and Greens] in
the form of a collaborative discussion
where the groups put forth what issues
they support and why," Smith said. "There
needs to be more cooperation in educating
students first."
Junior Andy Clavin, the founder of the
conservative Jewish-American Alliance,
also wants to increase the scope of campus
dialogue.
"I'd like to see a free market
place of ideas, and I'd like to see
the same amount of diversity
Stanford allows for racial and
ethnic groups to be allowed for
diverse political thought, as
well," he said.
On-campus political activity
next year is slated to focus on or
ganizing informational presenta
tions on the different candidates,
fliering, actively trying to register
voters and bringing notable
speakers to campus.
Sophomore Dylan Mefford,
president of the Stanford Democ
rats, said, "There will be presen
tations to the students, and we'll
bring speakers to campus. We re
cently had a discussion presenta
tion of the nine candidates Tor the
Democratic position on what

their polices and beliefs and
backgrounds are, and we had a
pretty good turnout. We'll prob
ably hold one more as the elec
tion time grows nearer.
"We do need to reach out to
more students in the activist
groups on campus, because a lot
of those groups do have a lot of
power and a strong following,"
he continued. "It is easier to show
opposition to Bush in a political
setting, regardless of the reasons,
and it's a manner of channeling
that through positive means such
as voter registration."
All groups are planning a
heavy focus on current political
issues.
"I think there will be a lot of ac
tion towards re-electing Bush
from my group and the Republi
cans," Clavin said.
"I think the success of the war
in Iraq plus progress on peace is
sues in Israel and Palestine in ad
dition to the recent tax cuts are
altogether really going to help
Bush's image among voters who
look at the big issues," Fineberg
said.
In the coming year, members
of the Green party hope to
broaden awareness of the party's
goals and its relationship to the
Democratic party.
"There are some people [in
the Green and Democratic par
ties] who stand strongly for 'any
one but Bush' and others who
promote 'any progressive candi
date rather than Bush,' " Smith
said. "We could support the lat
ter group, but only if concessions
were made to the Greens," Smith
said. "It's also possible that if
someone as progressive as
Kucinich makes it in the elec
tions, we might back the Democ
ratic candidate."
Already, a group of students
who have formed in support of
Rep. Dennis Kucinich's (D-Ohio)
presidential bid have begun an
effort to educate students on
Kucinich's stances — which in
cluded bringing him to campus
last April 25.
"First, we're going to have a
big fliering campaign," said
freshman Megan Miller. "We're
thinking of having a couple of
charity events in the name of
Dennis, and hopefully we'll have
informational meetings. We want
to make room fora lot of creative
support by letting students make
presentations, spread the word to
interest groups and register peo
ple to vote in White Plaza."
