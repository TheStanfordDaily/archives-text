## Former ambassador to Pakistan considers Islam in global, historical context 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Tom Si
mons said he was shocked and confused by the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks in a lecture Friday at the Stanford
Bookstore. In trying to understand the events, he
was disappointed by a lack of historical analysis in
popular discourse about reasons for the attacks. He
was concerned that the media tried to identify Mus
lims as a different kind of people that could not be
understood in a conventional framework.
In spring of 2002, Simons defined where he saw
Islam within history during a series of Payne Lec
tures he gave at the Institute for International Stud
ies. The lectures have now been turned into a short
book, "Islam in a Globalizing World," which Simons
addressed on Friday. The Daily interviewed Simons
on Thursday.
"American journalism has really done itself
proud," he said of post-Sept. 11 coverage. "But a lot
of things were being told that there's something
about Islam that accounts for the practices ofa billion
living people right now, that there's something that
was fixed in the Middle Ages that explains their be
havior . . . why they're unproductive or why they
bomb other people.
"We're being told . . . that there's something
about these people that's unmodern," lie said. "I just
didn't think that was true."
Simons, who is a consulting professor with the
Center for International Security and Cooperation,
admits that some of his experience with Islam is
"spotty and patchy." Serving in Pakistan, where Si
mons said "all these problems come together," al
lowed him to approach the globalization of Islam
