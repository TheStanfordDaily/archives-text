# Author debates views on Islam
## Former ambassador to Pakistan considers Islam in global, historical context 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Tom Si
mons said he was shocked and confused by the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks in a lecture Friday at the Stanford
Bookstore. In trying to understand the events, he
was disappointed by a lack of historical analysis in
popular discourse about reasons for the attacks. He
was concerned that the media tried to identify Mus
lims as a different kind of people that could not be
understood in a conventional framework.
In spring of 2002, Simons defined where he saw
Islam within history during a series of Payne Lec
tures he gave at the Institute for International Stud
ies. The lectures have now been turned into a short
book, "Islam in a Globalizing World," which Simons
addressed on Friday. The Daily interviewed Simons
on Thursday.
"American journalism has really done itself
proud," he said of post-Sept. 11 coverage. "But a lot
of things were being told that there's something
about Islam that accounts for the practices ofa billion
living people right now, that there's something that
was fixed in the Middle Ages that explains their be
havior . . . why they're unproductive or why they
bomb other people.
"We're being told . . . that there's something
about these people that's unmodern," lie said. "I just
didn't think that was true."
Simons, who is a consulting professor with the
Center for International Security and Cooperation,
admits that some of his experience with Islam is
"spotty and patchy." Serving in Pakistan, where Si
mons said "all these problems come together," al
lowed him to approach the globalization of Islam
from a unique perspective.
Simons spent much of his time
in the Foreign Service in commu
nist countries, but he grew up in
British India, lived in newly-inde
pendent Pakistan and began his
Foreign Service career by taking
the Duke Ellington Orchestra
around the Near East and South
Asia.
His career and his graduate
work on medieval Islam interested
him in the historical framework lor
terrorism. Then, when he looked
fora model for Islamic extremism,
he noticed similarities to a trend
that he was much more familiar
with — Eastern European com
munism.
"[The book contains] a compar
ison with the other kind of radical

ism that has dominated the 20th
century, which was Russian and
East European radicalism.
"It's an equivalent idealism [to
Islamic extremism]," he said. "It's
as vague and as magical. They say
they're promoting the Caliphate [a
medieval religious state]. Well, this
is like a classless society."
For the most part, however, the
book focuses more on giving "the
educated layman" a perspective on
Islamic society than it does on chal
lenging academics to a battle of his
torical models, according to Si
mons.
He sees the nexus of the 21st
century as emerging from two lati
tudinal bands of countries, the
post-Communist world and the Is
lamic world.
"They're faced with compara
ble challenges," he said, noting
that globalization is challenging
every country in the world. "I
think how those swaths [of coun

tries] go and also how they relate to
each other will determine the fate
of the planet."
Taking a broad, historical ap
proach, Simons sees opposite
trends coming out of the war with
Iraq. On one hand, he sees the
likelihood of a government sup
porting terrorism decreasing.
"Even the people who support
[terrorists'] ideals . . . are asking
whether this is the way to do it,"he
said in reference to the geopolitical
risks of supporting terrorists.
On the other hand, Simons
noted that Islamic fundamentalists
"tend to be totally irresponsible"
and blame "colonial powers, Israel
and America"for their problems.
Despite myriad difficulties, Si
mons said he remains optimistic.
"The evidence tells me that the
challenges they're facing they can
overcome," he said. "It doesn't say
they will, but they can, and the
record shows that they can."
