# Peacemaking talks stall

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Mo
mentum in Middle East peacemak
ing slowed yesterday as the Bush ad
ministration's drive to sidetrack
Yasser Arafat sustained a setback.
The Palestinians postponed a
meeting of their prime minister,
Mahmoud Abbas, with Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, saying Abbas
wanted to consult with Arafat.
And Arafat, the historic leader of
the Palestinians, asserted that he —not
the prime minister — was in charge of
Palestinian negotiations with Israel.
But a three-way summit in the re
gion still appeared likely next week,
to bring President Bush together
with Abbas and Sharon.
Jordan's Information Minister
Mohammad Affash Adwan said
Bush would meet with Sharon and
Abbas in the Jordanian port of
Aqaba, on the Red Sea, and then
with several Arab leaders at Sharm
el-Sheik, an Egyptian resort.

A senior U.S. official said the pur
pose would be to make headway in
implementing the blueprint for an
Israeli-Palestinian settlement pro
duced by the United States, the Eu
ropean Union, Russia and the Unit
ed Nations.
But the White House suggested
Bush had not yet made a decision.
While the administration tried to
minimize the postponement of the
Abbas-Sharon meeting as merely
technical, Arafat told the PLO's exec
utive committee he wanted to review
security proposals before Abbas met
again with Sharon.
The move by Arafat supported a
worldwide perception that Arafat —
no matter how hard the Bush ad
ministration tries to marginalize him
— is the paramount leader of the
Palestinians.
Abbas, who owes his appointment
to Arafat, described Arafat recently
as the Palestine president.
