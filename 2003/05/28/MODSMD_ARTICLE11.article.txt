LONDON (AP) — A plane made a dangerous
ice-landing near the North Pole yesterday to rescue
a stranded British explorer who had spent a week
camped on a drifting ice floe with his rations run
ning low.
Pen Hadow, 41, was picked up after the plane
landed on a makeshift runway he had marked out
on the floating ice using plastic bags.
Hadow began his 480-mile trek on March 17
from Ward Hunt Island and on May 19 became the
first person to reach the North Pole alone and un
aided from Canada.
Two earlier attempts to retrieve him failed be

cause of breaking ice and thick clouds.
Steve Penikett, a spokesman for Kenn Borek Air
lines, said the ice was moving rapidly and continual
ly breaking up, making the rescue mission difficult
for everyone involved.
"I wish it hadn't taken place at this time of year.
This is the latest we have ever done a pickup," he
told Sky News.
"It's not the issue of him running out of food," he
said. "It's the issue of going to the pole at this time of
year is just a bit stupid and you are putting a lot of
people's lives at risk doing it."
But Penikett praised Hadow's achievement.

"He has had quite a trek and I'm sure he's very tired
and hungry. But he's done well," Penikett said. "Many
people have tried this with varying degree of success.
Anyone who gets there has achieved a good thing."
Hadow was headed back to the team base camp
at Eureka Weatherstation on Ellesmere Island, off
Canada's coast. He is expected to return then to
Britain.
A statement on the exploration team's official
Web site said, "Pen is fine apart from obviously
being tired and hungry and in need of a shower."
