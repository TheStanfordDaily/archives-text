13 Years and Still Going
Last month the Hubble space tele-

1
scope completed 13 years in space.
The observatory's initial track was
not good, since one of the mirrors
had blurred vision. A mission in
1993 fixed the problem and since
then the Hubble has been provid
ing spectacular pictures of objects
thousands of light years away. Tele
scopes typically have a lifetime of 10
years, so Hubble has exceeded ex-

pectations. This is a good time to mention some de
tails that go unmentioned. The Hubble is a joint
project between NASA and ESA (the European
Space Agency) and is managed primarily by NASA.
Punctuated Equilibrium Reloaded
A team of geologists from Syracuse University has
challenged the theory of coordinate statis in the
journal Geology. Coordinate statis is a theory of
evolution that suggests species live together fora
long period of time and undergo rapid turnovers.
"Our study suggests that there may be more vari
ability in species composition through time than
predicted by coordinate statis," said Linda Ivany,
one of the co-authors of the study. The geologists
applied statistical analysis on fossils and concluded
that several different species co-exist, with old ones
dying and new ones surging constantly. This sug
gests that coordinated statis occurs rarely, if at all.
The idea of coordinated statis stems primarily from
punctuated equilibrium, a theory championed by
the late biologist Stephen Gould in the 19605, which
stipulated that evolution occurs in spurts of intense
change.
Neurons Can Self-Organize

A group from Uni
versity of Tel Aviv,
Israel, has taken a
step in elucidating
the mode by
which neurons
wire themselves
together. The re
searchers showed
how a group of
neurons can self-

organize themselves into functional clusters of cells.
The clusters were linked together and were able to
maintain electrical activity. In their investigation,
the scientists grew cultures of rat brain cells on a
surface and recorded on video the formation of the
network. Eshel Ben-Jacob, the main author, said
that the results "might provide important clues to
wards understanding self-organization in the cen
tral nervous system and the brain itself."
A Step Forward in Stem Cells
Stanford researchers have become the first to suc
cessfully isolate a group of proteins that are key in
regulating stem cells. These proteins are called
Wnts and were discovered almost two decades ago.
The protein was unusual because it behaves differ
ently from what its encoding gene predicts. Roe
land Nusse, professor of developmental biology and
member of their research team, explained to Na
ture, "We found that the protein is modified, ex
plaining why it has been difficult to isolate." With
Wnts in hand, researchers might be able to better
understand how stem cells can remain in their
youthful state. Stem cells are totipotent, meaning
that they are primordial cells that can differentiate
into any other kind of cell and could have a dra
matic impact on tissue transplantation and organ
regeneration.
Tooth-Colored Resin
It used to be that when you got a cavity your tooth
would be filled with a mercury amalgam, turning
your mouth conspicuously silver colored. The new,
ever-more popular alternative is a tooth-colored
resin. This is a polymer composite, made from a hy
drocarbon and strengthened with finely ground
glass. It is malleable and able to withstand the wear
and tear that teeth go through everyday. Besides, a
resin-filled tooth is essentially indistinguishable
from a normal one, at least on sight. The resins still
have a lower durability than amalgams â€” lasting at
most five years. The challenges now are to develop
resins that are more adhesive, more durable and
easier to prepare.
Lead Paint Still a Danger
Lead poisoning used to be an endemic problem,
when house paint and gasoline both contained lead.
Lead was banned from house paints in 1960 and
from gasoline in 1970 but there are still risks. A
study from the Centers of Disease Control (CDC)
targeting 200 children between the ages of six
months and five years found that those with a
blood-lead level of 10 meg per deciliter scored 7.4
points lower in IQ tests than those with 1 meg per
deciliter. According to estimates there are still
900,000 kids in the United States with bloodlevels at
or above the 10 meg per deciliter level. Many of
them live in the 38 million homes built before 1960
that still have lead paint.
