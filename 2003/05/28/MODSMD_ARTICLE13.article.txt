# Serving up Wi-Fi:
## Networking Gone Wireless 
### ERICA O'YOUNG 
For the laptop-toting hoards of
academia, businesspeople and web
surfers, it's a dream come true.
With the nation's Hyatts, Star
bucks, airports and, yes, McDonald's
scrambling onto the Wi-Fi bandwag
on along with some of the biggest
names in the technology industry, it
is undeniable that the wireless revo
lution is indisputably, irreversibly
here.
Universities are also following
along. Available to all members of
the Stanford community with a
SUNet ID and password, a laptop
computer with built-in wireless or a
Type II PCMCIA slot and a wireless
card, Stanford's current network ex
tends to the Main Quad, Tressider,
Meyer and Green Libraries, the grad
schools, as well as several other build
ings.
But Stanford isn't the first. One of
the oldest and largest university net
works is Carnegie Mellon Universi
ty's WLAN. Started as a research pro
ject in 1994, it currently covers all
buildings of the 103-acre campus.
The problem, however, with uni
versity implementation of wireless is
funding. "Wireless networking
doesn't come free. Some entity has to
pick up the charges for the deploy
ment, says Phil Reese, technical man
ager of Stanford's Information Tech
nology Systems and Services (ITSS).
Each school and department on
campus is responsible for establish
ing their own in-building network,
explains Reese. "ITSS is sponsored
by Stanford to provide . . . the back
bone that ties all of the individual
networks together."
Still in its infancy, Stanford's own
wireless network supports between
70 and 90 people at any given time
on an average school day.
Across the nation, the number of
hotspots is skyrocketing. In the past
year, Wired magazine reported a
tenfold increase in the number of
hotspots to 12,000 around the world,
naming San Francisco's Levi Strauss
Plaza as the "No. 1 cool hot spot" in
the U.S.
Businesses have been quick to rec
ognize the potential of wireless in lur
ing Internet-surfing customers. By
summer, 400 Borders bookstores will
offer Wi-Fi access. In a partnership
announced last August, Starbucks
and T-Mobile currently offer wireless
access in more than 2,100 Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. Most re
cently, McDonald's, working with
San Francisco startup Cometa, will
extend wireless to 300 McDonald
restaurants in New York City, Chica
go and a yet-to-be-announced Cali

fornia town. Hilton, Mariott, Shera
ton, Westin and VV hotels also plan to
offer wireless access points in hun
dreds of hotels in the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom and
Germany. Wi-Fi is also making its
way into the passenger lounges at
San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth
airports.
Impatient Wi-Fi fans at home are
taking matters in their own hands.
With wireless packages just a $150
credit card swipe away at the local
Wal-Mart, the Wi-Fi movement is no
tably the first real "grassroots" phe
nomenon to hit the tech scene in a
long time. The number of units sold
is expected to double to 12 million
this year, according to Wired maga
zine, adding to the proliferating web
of ad hoc community nets created
both intentionally and unsuspecting
ly by neighborhood base stations.
The home market is expected to ex
ceed all others.
Meanwhile, computer maker
Toshiba and chipmaker Intel
promise to set up even more wireless

hotspots in coffee shops, hotels and
convenience stores across the United
States. Like ISPs, however, indepen
dent Wi-Fi providers are facing fierce
competition as telecom firms enter
the fray. Currently among the top
service providers are AT&T, Boingo,
Cometa, Surf and Sip and T-Mobile.
They are backed, in dollars and in
sweat, by longstanding technology
heavyweights jostling to wield the
hardware end of the business. While
Apple, Dell and D-Link, as well as
new-comer Vivato, strike out on their
own to answer to the ever-increasing
client base for base stations, others
have chosen to partner with other
hardware makers.
San Jose's Cisco Systems, for ex
ample, has formed a network hard
ware giant with Intel, HP and Ather
os. Working together, the companies
provide free security and range-ex
tending software to the makers of Wi-
Fi chipsets, thus ensuring demand
for their access points and other
backend equipment. The Linksys
Group, in addition, has partnered

with Net2Phone, hoping that a low
price, utilitarian approach and net
work-extending products will appeal
to customers.
In the upcoming show of wireless
laptop integration, Intel Corps
much touted Centrino microproces
sor aims to be one of the headlining
acts. Specially tailored for laptop
computers, the Centrino chip fea
tures a built-in Wi-Fi transceiver that
allows accelerated Internet access at
up to 11 megabits per second, far
faster than dial-up connections.
More than a dozen computer makers
are now introducing new Centrino
based laptops.
"Increasingly, people lugging lap
tops are demanding Internet connec
tions and power outlets," says Neil
Yang, senior Intel component design
engineer. "This phenomenon, cou
pled with the emergence of Wi-Fi
and technology like the Centrino,
sets up the possibility of huge
changes in the way people do mobile
computing...and the way people
work and live."

Although laptop users usually need to purchase a separate wireless networking card to take advantage of Stanford's Wi-Fi net
work, the technology is catching on. As most new laptops now have Wi-Fi capability built in, Stanford's wireless network can only
grow in popularity.
For the laptop-toting hoards of
academia, businesspeople and web
surfers, it's a dream come true.
With the nation's Hyatts, Star
bucks, airports and, yes, McDonald's
scrambling onto the Wi-Fi bandwag
on along with some of the biggest
names in the technology industry, it
is undeniable that the wireless revo
lution is indisputably, irreversibly
here.
Universities are also following
along. Available to all members of
the Stanford community with a
SUNet ID and password, a laptop
computer with built-in wireless or a
Type II PCMCIA slot and a wireless
card, Stanford's current network ex
tends to the Main Quad, Tressider,
Meyer and Green Libraries, the grad
schools, as well as several other build
ings.
But Stanford isn't the first. One of
the oldest and largest university net
works is Carnegie Mellon Universi
ty's WLAN. Started as a research pro
ject in 1994, it currently covers all
buildings of the 103-acre campus.
The problem, however, with uni
versity implementation of wireless is
funding. "Wireless networking
doesn't come free. Some entity has to
pick up the charges for the deploy
ment, says Phil Reese, technical man
ager of Stanford's Information Tech
nology Systems and Services (ITSS).
Each school and department on
campus is responsible for establish
ing their own in-building network,
explains Reese. "ITSS is sponsored
by Stanford to provide . . . the back
bone that ties all of the individual
networks together."
Still in its infancy, Stanford's own
wireless network supports between
70 and 90 people at any given time
on an average school day.
Across the nation, the number of
hotspots is skyrocketing. In the past
year, Wired magazine reported a
tenfold increase in the number of
hotspots to 12,000 around the world,
naming San Francisco's Levi Strauss
Plaza as the "No. 1 cool hot spot" in
the U.S.
Businesses have been quick to rec
ognize the potential of wireless in lur
ing Internet-surfing customers. By
summer, 400 Borders bookstores will
offer Wi-Fi access. In a partnership
announced last August, Starbucks
and T-Mobile currently offer wireless
access in more than 2,100 Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. Most re
cently, McDonald's, working with
San Francisco startup Cometa, will
extend wireless to 300 McDonald
restaurants in New York City, Chica
go and a yet-to-be-announced Cali

fornia town. Hilton, Mariott, Shera
ton, Westin and VV hotels also plan to
