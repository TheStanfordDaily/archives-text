# As finals approach:
## Managing the daily stresses of university life 
### 
As much as Stanford is an elite
university with high academ
ic demands placed upon its
students, how many of us ac
tually know how to successfully cope
with an overwhelming workload? And
what exactly will happen to us if we un
derestimate the effects of stress on our
bodies?
These are just some of the ques
tions answered daily by Alejandro
Martinez, director of Counseling
and Psychological Services, who says
that at least one in 10 of the students
he sees are experiencing stress and
anxiety.
"While going to university is a very
courageous enterprise and students
are pushing themselves to the max,
they need more humility about the
challenge," said Martinez. "Working
harder does not always help perfor
mance."
Stress is expressed in a variety of
ways by the body. Common physical
symptoms include stomach problems,
frequent urination, racing heartbeat,
sweaty palms and body aches. Some
experience stress emotionally, causing
unexpected crying, feelings of irritabil
ity or nervousness. Stress can also neg
atively affect concentration and acade
mic performance.

Over time, undiag
nosed chronic stress
can cause relatively
minor illnesses like in
somnia, backaches or
headaches and can
also contribute to
more serious condi
tions such as high
blood pressure and
heart disease.

Equally concerning is that too much
stress may lead a person into danger
ous forms of escapism, such as alco
holism, drug abuse and self-medica
tion.
Having said this, moderate levels of
stress can actually prove beneficial.
When the body is under stress, blood
pressure automatically increases, along
with heart rate, respiration, metabo
lism and blood flow to muscles. All of
this is intended to help your body react
quickly and effectively in a high-pres
sure situation.
"Universities are places for growth
and challenge — and that involves a
stressful environment," said Martinez.
"But equally, stress can help people
grow and develop."
The key to balancing stress, accord
ing to Martinez, is to adopt an ap
proach which essentially values the

"work hard, play hard" ethic.
"It's really all about appreciating the
importance of de-stressing and know
ing when to relax," he added.
Tips for reducing stress:
1) Be realistic — Learn to say NO!
Eliminate activities that are unneces
sary and simplify your life.
2) Shed perfectionism — No one is
perfect, so why place so much pressure
on yourself? Know your limits.
3) Meditate — Close your eyes and
clear your mind fora few minutes each
day. Try to focus on the positive as
pects of your life.
4) Visualize — Imagine the end goal
and see yourself achieving it.
5) One thing at a time — Ifyou find your
selfdoing one task and thinking about an
other, try writing out a to-do list and work
steadily through each task. This should
motivate you to complete the tasks.
6) Exercise — Physical activity is a
great way to eliminate stress from the
body. Just 30 minutes of running, cy
cling or swimming each day is enough
to make you feel better.

7) Hobbies — University life is not all
about academic work, all the time. Try
taking up a relaxing activity like aro
matherapy, photography or music.
8) Healthy lifestyle — Lower your caf
feine and alcohol intake and drink
plenty of water (four to eight glasses
per day.) Maintain a nutritious and
balanced diet and make sure you get
enough sleep.
9) Share your feelings — Don't suffer
alone. Vocalizing your worries can
help lessen your feelings of being over
whelmed and out of control.
10) Stop minimizing the challenge —
Admitting to stress is not a sign of weak
ness. If your workload is really over
whelming, don't be afraid to visit your
academic adviser or professor and ask
for help.
