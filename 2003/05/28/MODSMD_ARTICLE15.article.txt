## The
						Stanford Daily Nadinne Cruz's legacy 
### 
Editorial

Earlier this month, University Provost
John Etchemendy announced the
resignation of Nadinne Cruz, direc
tor of the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, from Stanford. The reasons for her de
parture were not explained. Before Cruz
leaves Stanford, we want to recognize the lega
cy she has left at the University. Her capabili
ties as a public service leader and role model
will be difficult to replace.
Cruz is renown locally, nationally and in
ternationally for leading Stanford to its No.
1 spot in the U.S. News & World Report's
rankings for service learning at a university.

She has been at Stanford
for the last nine years
and headed the Haas
Center for the past five.
Indeed, her work on ser
vice learning has been a
pivotal aspect of her pub
lic service legacy. But
even more impressive is
the all-inclusive way by
which she has ap
proached the concept of
public service during her
tenure at the Haas Cen
ter.
While many may
think of the concept of
public service as synony-

mous with that of community service, Cruz
has helped the Haas Center — and Stan
ford overall — embrace a more compre
hensive and useful definition for public ser
vice. Such a perspective has made Cruz a
mentor and role model to many students
and community members. Through her in
clusive approach, she has made the Haas
Center increasingly more attractive and
powerful as a center for civic learning, en
gagement and innovation.
Under Cruz's guidance, Haas Center pro-

While many may think of the
concept of public service as
synonymous with that of
community service, Nadinne
Cruz has helped the Haas
Center embrace a more
comprehensive and useful
definition for public service.

gramming has not only involved community
service endeavors like tutoring and food do
nation, but also programs more focused on
the Stanford student's learning, like Stanford
in Washington and Alternative Spring Break.
The Haas Center's programming, too, sup
ports students interested in issues such as so
cial justice and diversity. By supporting a
wide variety of programming and encourag
ing innovation, the Haas Center prepares
Stanford students to play more influential
civic and social roles than a more limited pub
lic service training would.
We wish that the University would be

more transparent and
open — in explaining
why Cruz has decided to
leave Stanford. Further
more, there are legiti
mate concerns regarding
the exclusion of students
in the process of selecting
the next Haas Center di
rector. Given the impor
tance of student involve
ment in the success of
Haas Center program
ming and considering
that the Haas Center par
tially exists to engage stu
dents, the exclusion of
students in the function-

ing of the Haas Center — including the de
cision of who is to be director — appears at
odds with its message.
In the end, the message we wish to leave is
one of respect and thanks to Cruz for her ser
vice not only to the immediate community,
but to every community that the public ser
vants trained under her guidance will reach.
We hope that the next director of the Haas
Center will hold similar perspectives about the
nature and importance of public service and
its far-reaching applications.
