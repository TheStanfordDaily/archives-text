# Kudos for Relay for Life
## 
### 
More than 2,200 people gathered at
the Stanford Stadium last weekend
for Relay for Life, an annual Uni
versity event that raises donations
in the fight against cancer. The 18-hour event,
which drew people from across campus and
surrounding communities, featured a variety
of fun and informative attractions, ranging
from track, and field events, to performances by
student groups, to an educational seminar at
the Medical Center.
By the end of the closing ceremonies, about
$57,000 had been raised, and according to co
organizer Mykel Kochenderfer, even more do
nations have been sent in since.
Relay For Life exemplifies the kind of cre
ative resourcefulness which Stanford should
and does encourage in its student body. Not

only did the event raise awareness about can
cer and help advance the fight fora cure, but it
also brought the community together in cele
bration and service. Its success demonstrates
that students can come together and achieve a
common goal — in this case, one that will
hopefully help future generations and the
health profession.
Held near the end of what most students will
consider to be a work-intensive spring quarter,
Relay for Life is a reminder of the importance
of activism — especially among the academic
elite. And it's a reminder of what can be accom
plished when a group of dedicated individuals
gather together to fight fora cause.
We applaud the students involved in Relay
for Life and hope the event continues to raise
funds for cancer research in the future.
