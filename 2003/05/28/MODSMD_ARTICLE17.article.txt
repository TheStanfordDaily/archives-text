# FROSH FILES
## Is this it? 
### 
Every freshman must suf
fer through it at one point
or another: high school
nostalgia. It usually hap
pens on a Tuesday or Wednesday
night, when you still have a hun
dred pages to read by the next day
and 10 pages to type by Friday, but
all you can do is look for something
— anything — to get your mind
off work. Suddenly, you eye the
high school yearbook lodged on
your bookshelf or you hear a song
that reminds you of senior year
(mine is "Hot in Herre"), and the
next thing you know, you're on
AIM chatting with old friends you
haven't bothered to contact in
months.
It's funny, the more I look back
on my high school days, the more
I grow fond of them. I couldn't
wait to get out while I was there,
but now all I can think about are
those simpler times when the
workload wasn't too heavy like it is
here in college.
Back then many of us couldn't
wait to go to college. We looked
forward to the freedom of being
able to choose what we wanted to
study and of being away from our
parents. We looked forward to
making new friends and even try
ing some new things we would've
never done back home. And, for
the most part, we attained all that.
Looking back on this year,
there are so many good things that
happened to me. I've met wonder
ful new friends, taken great classes,
lived through exciting new experi
ences and, of course, wrote this col
umn. But now that the year is
coming to an end, I find myself in
reflection mode, comparing my
first year of college to high school.
And I also find myself struggling
with one question: Am I any hap
pier now than I was back then?
Before I arrived on campus, I
was filled with all these precon

ceived notions that my college ex
perience would be the way the
media liked to portray it: As a rol
licking, fun-filled time where the
protagonist learns the true mean
ing of life, all the while acing the
tough final exam and getting the
girl at the end.
I was even tricked by all those
glossy brochures I picked up at the

Admissions Of
fice, in which stu
dents are talking
and smiling on
the sun-drenched
lawn or are en
gaged in deep
conversation with
a distinguished
looking profes-

sor. Suffice to say, my expectations
for Stanford were not based on any
concrete reality.
The thing that has me question
ing my freshman experience is my
general disappointment with
Stanford; and this disappointment
has a lot to do with those expecta
tions I mentioned above. I expect
ed The Farm to be this amazing,
wonderful place where every class
is interesting and meaningful,
every person is appealing and
friendly and every night there is al
ways something fun and worth
while happening. As we all know
by now, this isn't the case.
For me, there wasn't that much
of a difference between high
school classes and college classes.
They all started with a basic inter
est on my part, but they quickly de
veloped into chores, and I tried to
get through them as quickly and as
painlessly as possible. There were
a few exceptions, but there were
also a few in high school. Hopeful
ly, as the amount of introductory
and required classes lessens over
the next three years, this won't be
the case anymore.
Stanford is supposedly has the

creme de la creme of active, intelli
gent, young people, and I have no
doubts that it is true. But I can't
help but feel like I'm stuck in high
school again, and everyone is fill
ing a stereotypical high school
role. Think about it: We have the
jocks, the popular kids, the übern
erds, the stoners, the loners and all
the rest in between. It's the same
people all over again, just trans
ported into a different location
with different faces and different
names. Will it change as we grow
older? I certainly hope so. But I
can't shake off this feeling that
every peer I meet from here on
out will just be another variation of
someone I knew in high school.
As for the social scene at Stan
ford, it has been well documented
that this year has had a terrible so
cial atmosphere on campus rela
tive to other years. Since I'm a
freshman, I couldn't compare. But
you think that with thousands of
young and vibrant people popu
lating this campus, the party scene
could offer more options than
drinking cheap beer at SAE and
drinking cheaper beer at Sigma
Chi on a weekend. It's usually ev
eryone's workload that keeps peo
ple from being able to do things on
weeknights, but sometimes we get
so burned out that there's no moti
vation to do anything on the week
ends either.
Perhaps this is a case of not
knowing what you've got until it's
gone. How else could 1 explain my
fondness for high school and its
rigid scheduling system, some
times lame teachers and even
lamer students? I guess I never re
ally had any expectations for high
school beyond graduating and get
ting out, and in those instances,
high school was a complete success.

then I can see it now: I'm sitting in

now I will be able to say I was truly
happy with my freshman year.

Every freshman must suf
fer through it at one point
or another: high school
nostalgia. It usually hap
pens on a Tuesday or Wednesday
night, when you still have a hun
dred pages to read by the next day
and 10 pages to type by Friday, but
all you can do is look for something
— anything — to get your mind
off work. Suddenly, you eye the
high school yearbook lodged on
your bookshelf or you hear a song
that reminds you of senior year
(mine is "Hot in Herre"), and the
next thing you know, you're on
AIM chatting with old friends you
haven't bothered to contact in
months.
It's funny, the more I look back
on my high school days, the more
I grow fond of them. I couldn't
wait to get out while I was there,
but now all I can think about are
those simpler times when the
workload wasn't too heavy like it is
here in college.
Back then many of us couldn't
wait to go to college. We looked
forward to the freedom of being
able to choose what we wanted to
study and of being away from our
parents. We looked forward to
making new friends and even try
ing some new things we would've
never done back home. And, for
the most part, we attained all that.
Looking back on this year,
there are so many good things that
happened to me. I've met wonder
ful new friends, taken great classes,
lived through exciting new experi
ences and, of course, wrote this col
umn. But now that the year is
coming to an end, I find myself in
reflection mode, comparing my
first year of college to high school.
And I also find myself struggling
with one question: Am I any hap
pier now than I was back then?
Before I arrived on campus, I
was filled with all these precon

ceived notions that my college ex
perience would be the way the
media liked to portray it: As a rol
licking, fun-filled time where the
protagonist learns the true mean
ing of life, all the while acing the
tough final exam and getting the
girl at the end.
I was even tricked by all those
glossy brochures I picked up at the

Admissions Of
fice, in which stu
dents are talking
and smiling on
the sun-drenched
lawn or are en
gaged in deep
conversation with
a distinguished
looking profes-

sor. Suffice to say, my expectations
for Stanford were not based on any
concrete reality.
The thing that has me question
ing my freshman experience is my
general disappointment with
Stanford; and this disappointment
has a lot to do with those expecta
tions I mentioned above. I expect
ed The Farm to be this amazing,
wonderful place where every class
is interesting and meaningful,
every person is appealing and
friendly and every night there is al
ways something fun and worth
while happening. As we all know
by now, this isn't the case.
For me, there wasn't that much
of a difference between high
school classes and college classes.
They all started with a basic inter
est on my part, but they quickly de
veloped into chores, and I tried to
get through them as quickly and as
painlessly as possible. There were
a few exceptions, but there were
also a few in high school. Hopeful
ly, as the amount of introductory
and required classes lessens over
the next three years, this won't be
the case anymore.
Stanford is supposedly has the

creme de la creme of active, intelli
gent, young people, and I have no
doubts that it is true. But I can't
help but feel like I'm stuck in high
school again, and everyone is fill
ing a stereotypical high school
role. Think about it: We have the
jocks, the popular kids, the übern
erds, the stoners, the loners and all
the rest in between. It's the same
people all over again, just trans
ported into a different location
with different faces and different
names. Will it change as we grow
older? I certainly hope so. But I
can't shake off this feeling that
every peer I meet from here on
out will just be another variation of
someone I knew in high school.
As for the social scene at Stan
ford, it has been well documented
that this year has had a terrible so
cial atmosphere on campus rela
tive to other years. Since I'm a
freshman, I couldn't compare. But
you think that with thousands of
young and vibrant people popu
lating this campus, the party scene
could offer more options than
drinking cheap beer at SAE and
drinking cheaper beer at Sigma
Chi on a weekend. It's usually ev
eryone's workload that keeps peo
ple from being able to do things on
weeknights, but sometimes we get
so burned out that there's no moti
vation to do anything on the week
ends either.
Perhaps this is a case of not
knowing what you've got until it's
gone. How else could 1 explain my
fondness for high school and its
rigid scheduling system, some
times lame teachers and even
lamer students? I guess I never re
ally had any expectations for high
school beyond graduating and get
ting out, and in those instances,
high school was a complete success.

know what we've got until its gone,
then I can see it now: I'm sitting in
my room next year, flipping
through the pages of my dorm
yearbook, instant messaging

dorm-mates from the previous

Amidst all the inevitable strug

this year, and realize that the class

seemed at first, the people not as
