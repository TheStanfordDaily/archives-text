The Stanford Daily should not be com
pared to the New York Times
As a former Daily editor, I would like to
respond to Daniel Bent ley's letter to the
editor, "The New York Times scoops The
Daily on its own turf' (May 23). I think
people should give Daily writers a break.
It's not that I haven't seen some poor jour
nalism at The Daily as a reader. But read
ers should consider the fact that the peo
ple who write for The Daily are people like
them — full-time students, mostly under
graduates, who happen to be spending up
to 15 or 20 hours a week writing articles.
Daily writers are trying the best they can
and they're not competing against the
New York Times, whose writers have
years of professional experience. Writers
for the New York Times work full-time,
thinking up stories and flying out to places
around the world to cover momentous
events.
The Daily is really more of a small town
paper that is best covering a lot of events as
they happen locally. So, if you want to hear
about what ASSU is or isn't doing for you,
read The Daily. If you want to hear about
what's going on Iraq, by all means, read

the New York Times.
Finally, to compare The Daily as an in
stitution to Jayson Blair is malicious and
bordering on libelous. I wonder if Bentley
even talked to anybody on The Daily staff
before launching his outrageous tirade.
Reporters try to seek the truth first; so
should Bentley.

The Daily's stance on Powderpuff football
is 'narrow-minded'; Powderpuff football
should continue at high schools
The Daily's editorial "Prohibit Powder
puff' (March 23), which declared that
Powderpuff football "has no place in a so
ciety that respects gender identity," was in
credibly narrow-minded. It is unfortunate
to see The Daily draw such hasty conclu
sions from one, albeit serious, incident.
The purpose of Powderpuff football
games, aside from fun and tradition, is to
break down gender barriers. Girls are able
to play a sport from which they are gener
ally barred, or their participation is at least
discouraged.
As someone who participated in the
high school tradition myself, I look back
on the games fondly, as a rare occasion in

which other female athletes and I were
able to compete under the football stadi
um lights in front of a large crowd of our
classmates — a crowd that did not usually
turn out for girls' field hockey or soccer
games. Sure, we got a little rough on the
field, but there was certainly no hazing or
extreme violence, as I am sure is the case
in most Powderpuff football games.
The Daily proclaimed that the hazing
incident at Glenbrook North High School
is reason enough to end the tradition. But
what about hazing rituals that regularly
occur in wrestling, football, soccer and all
kinds of other sports teams, male and fe
male, in high schools and colleges across
the country? Should all competitive sports
be eliminated for occasionally setting the
stage for violence? Or should women be
barred from sports because putting them
in a traditionally male setting may encour
age aggression?
Furthermore, The Daily's reaction to
the gender reversal in Powderpuff football
games was too extreme. Anyone with any
awareness of pop culture knows that most
people consider gender role reversal
funny to some extent. I have yet to see an
editorial denounce films like "Juwanna
Mann," "The Hot Chick," or "Mrs. Doubt
fire"— comedies that all center around
men dressed up as women.

There is nothing wrong with males
dressing up as female cheerleaders at Pow
derpuff football games; it is both amusing
to watch and is an interesting experience
for them to see what it is like to be on the
other side of the field, ft is not meant to
ridicule gender identities or to disrespect
anyone's sexuality, 112 hope that in the fu
ture, The Daily will not be so quick to draw
conclusions from isolated incidents wit fl
out taking the "big picture" into account.

Presenting both sides of debate is
responsible journalism
1 am writing in regard to San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown's letter, "Publishing
Armenian Genocide denial columns is not
responsible journalism" (May 21).
I completely disagree with the mayor. I
think it is not responsible journalism to
publish history from a single group's point
of view when alternate views do exist.
Even if it is generally believed that there
isn't much truth in an opposing view,
knowing that there is one is enlightening
in and of itself, especially when talking
about history. In reality, many times the
alternate views do draw attention to some

other aspects of the conflict, rather than
simply putting a "denial" stamp.
I commend The Daily for standing up
for free speech and the free flow of ideas.
