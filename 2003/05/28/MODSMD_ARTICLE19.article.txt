# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Justice for Stanford workers: Students fast for code of conduct 
### HAI BINH NGUYEN ANNA SALE GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I oday, Stanford students will begin a fast
to call upon the University to raise its labor
standards in light of the seriousness of prob
lems facing workers on campus. These stu
dents are challenging the administration to
create a comprehensive labor policy — a
"code of conduct" — that would address the
situation of all Stanford workers.
Campus Workers Continue to Struggle
For the past two years, workers at Stan
ford had to fight for job security — in die
112 ace of increasing subcontracting — for bet
ter staffing, decent wages and affordable
health care. Recently, subcontracted janito
rial workers at Stanford were on the verge of
striking for affordable health care, and
workers at Tresidder were fighting to keep
working at the student union after Bon Ap
petit leaves. Those same Tresidder workers
had to fight for decent wages and health in
surance last spring.
Although workers at Stanford have been
able to achieve real gains through collective
action, many continue to struggle with seri
ous problems. Right now, workers at Webb
Ranch — the lowest paid workers on Uni
versity land at $7.25 per hour — are trying
to obtain living wages and health care. Many
other Stanford workers cannot afford a de
cent standard of living. Most temporary and
subcontracted workers, for instance, earn
around $20,000 each year; many of these
workers live in areas such as San Jose where
rent fora one-bedroom apartment typically
costs around $ 15,000 a year.
Many workers who have received wage

raises cannot escape the job insecurity
threatened by outsourcing or job cuts. Be
cause subcontracted workers usually earn
less than Stanford's directly-hired workers
who do similar work, Stanford can cut labor
costs by outsourcing jobs through subcon
tracting and pass the burden onto its work
force.
Temporary workers face still greater
challenges because they are often shifted
from one job to another, just as they are
about to qualify for full-time positions and
lose out on the benefits and wages that go to
full-time workers. One temporary worker
who questioned this system is Victoria Vega.
"I have worked here at Stanford as a tem
porary worker for eight years," Victoria ex
plained. "Just last week I was laid-off and
when I asked why, they said that it was be
cause 1 was pushing too hard fora perma
nent job. This is how I am treated after eight
years of work."
Stanford Can do Better
As workers faced these problems daily,
the University made real but severely limit
ed changes in its labor policy. These limita
tions reflect the University's decision to not
involve students and workers in a meaning
ful way in the crafting of campus labor poli
cy. University President John Hennessy's
"$lO.lO living wage" policy amounts to little
more than a symbolic gesture: The policy
only applies to certain contracts and thus af
fects only a very small group of workers on
campus, and the $ 10.10 per hour wage does
not provide workers with a decent standard
of living in the areas where the workers re
side. Significantly, die policy does not ad
dress the issue of equal pay for equal work;

subcontracted workers still could earn less
than directly-hired workers doing similar
jobs. This policy thus does not ensure that
subcontracted workers will receive fail
wages and does not prevent the University
from using subcontracting to undercut
wages.
A week ago, the University took a small
step in the right direction by making an offi
cial commitment to support the campus'
subcontracted janitors in their demand for
affordable health care. However, the state
ment was extremely vague — it did not
even mention the American Building Main
tenance janitors specifically — and con
tained no mention of how much money the
University would set aside to help pay for
the workers' health insurance. The Univer
sity's statement is especially disappointing in
the context of the Justice for Janitors cam
paign, which managed to secure the same
contract for all unionized janitors in the Bay
Area. Bay Area businesses like Genentech
and EBay Inc. released statements an
nouncing they would cover 90 percent of
health care costs to supplement the janitors'
contracts. Stanford's vague statement
demonstrates it has not taken the lead on
labor issues in the Silicon Valley, and it is cer
tainly not a substitute fora long-term labor
policy.
Stanford's slow pace of progress on labor
justice does not match the University's
record of excellence and entrepreneurship
in other areas. Stanford prides itself on
being a leading university, yet has fallen be
hind schools such as Occidental College and
Colorado College on the issue of labor stan
dards. Stanford boasts a $7.6 billion endow
ment and is one of the top 10 fundraisers in

the country — it managed to raise $500 mil
lion dollars in the past year as part of its
Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion — yet Brown has taken greater strides
in raising labor standards with fewer finan
cial resources and with an endowment that
provides a smaller percentage of its operat
ing costs.
To be sure, Stanford currently is under
going a difficult period of budget reduc
tions; but these cuts do not have to come at
the expense of the welfare of campus work
ers. As Stanford is a model for other institu
tions in this country, we need to be especial
ly mindful of setting a standard for fair labor
practices.
The proposal: A code of conduct
The Coalition for Labor Justice — repre
senting over ten student groups — has been
asking Hennessy for more than two years to
commit to a policy that would ensure that all
campus workers are fairly and decendy
treated. More specifically, the Coalition
seeks a commitment from the University to
develop a comprehensive code of conduct
through a process that substantially includes
students and workers. Such a code of con
duct would:
Raise the bar for fair compensation with
a real living wage and affordable health care
for all workers in the Stanford community,
including subcontracted workers, Stanford
Hospital workers, Webb Ranch workers
and temporary workers;
Ensure equal pay for equal work as sub
contracted workers would earn the same
pay as directly-hired workers doing compa
rable jobs;
Facilitate workers' access to campus re-

sources by providing educational opportu
nities for workers on campus and support of
already-existing student-run educational
programs;
Give workers a voice at work by allowing
them freedom to choose a union without
worker interference.
This year marks a critical point in the sta
tus of our community's labor standards.
Momentum has been built in the direction
of a code of conduct through the hard work
of workers and students. The Coalition for
Labor Justice has grown in numbers and
visibility: 400 people attended the April
Community Day rally and 500 signed an on
line petition to support ABM janitors over
the course of only four days.
In partnership with workers, students
can and have made a difference: improve
ments to our community's labor policies
have taken place with the growing support.
We cannot be satisfied as long as there are
Stanford families who cannot afford to take
their partners to the doctor when they be
come sick because they lack adequate health
benefits or who cannot support their chil
dren in their schoolwork because they must
work two jobs to cover basic costs. As stu
dents, we must understand that our actions
can affect families and have real conse
quences for them. We cannot allow unjust
labor practices to exist on our campus.

The coalition will host a press conference today at
noon in the Main Quad. Hai Binh Nguyen is a
sophomore majoring in Asian American studies.
She can be reached at haihinh@stanford.edu.
Anna Sale is a senior majoring in history. She can
be reached at annasale@stanford.edu. Both are
members of the Coalition for IjaborJustice.

rent fora one-bedroom apartment typically
costs around $ 15,000 a year.
Many workers who have received wage

raises cannot escape the job insecurity
threatened by outsourcing or job cuts. Be
cause subcontracted workers usually earn
less than Stanford's directly-hired workers
who do similar work, Stanford can cut labor
costs by outsourcing jobs through subcon
tracting and pass the burden onto its work
force.
Temporary workers face still greater
challenges because they are often shifted
from one job to another, just as they are
about to qualify for full-time positions and
lose out on the benefits and wages that go to
full-time workers. One temporary worker
who questioned this system is Victoria Vega.
"I have worked here at Stanford as a tem
porary worker for eight years," Victoria ex
plained. "Just last week I was laid-off and
when I asked why, they said that it was be
cause 1 was pushing too hard fora perma
nent job. This is how I am treated after eight
years of work."
Stanford Can do Better
As workers faced these problems daily,
the University made real but severely limit
ed changes in its labor policy. These limita
tions reflect the University's decision to not
involve students and workers in a meaning
ful way in the crafting of campus labor poli
cy. University President John Hennessy's
"$lO.lO living wage" policy amounts to little
more than a symbolic gesture: The policy
only applies to certain contracts and thus af
fects only a very small group of workers on
campus, and the $ 10.10 per hour wage does
not provide workers with a decent standard
of living in the areas where the workers re
side. Significantly, die policy does not ad
dress the issue of equal pay for equal work;

subcontracted workers still could earn less
than directly-hired workers doing similar
jobs. This policy thus does not ensure that
subcontracted workers will receive fail
wages and does not prevent the University
from using subcontracting to undercut
wages.
A week ago, the University took a small
step in the right direction by making an offi
cial commitment to support the campus'
subcontracted janitors in their demand for
affordable health care. However, the state
ment was extremely vague — it did not
even mention the American Building Main
tenance janitors specifically — and con
tained no mention of how much money the
University would set aside to help pay for
the workers' health insurance. The Univer
sity's statement is especially disappointing in
the context of the Justice for Janitors cam
paign, which managed to secure the same
contract for all unionized janitors in the Bay
Area. Bay Area businesses like Genentech
and EBay Inc. released statements an
nouncing they would cover 90 percent of
health care costs to supplement the janitors'
contracts. Stanford's vague statement
demonstrates it has not taken the lead on
labor issues in the Silicon Valley, and it is cer
tainly not a substitute fora long-term labor
policy.
Stanford's slow pace of progress on labor
justice does not match the University's
record of excellence and entrepreneurship
in other areas. Stanford prides itself on
being a leading university, yet has fallen be
hind schools such as Occidental College and
Colorado College on the issue of labor stan
dards. Stanford boasts a $7.6 billion endow
ment and is one of the top 10 fundraisers in

the country — it managed to raise $500 mil
lion dollars in the past year as part of its
Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion — yet Brown has taken greater strides
in raising labor standards with fewer finan
cial resources and with an endowment that
provides a smaller percentage of its operat
ing costs.
To be sure, Stanford currently is under
going a difficult period of budget reduc
tions; but these cuts do not have to come at
the expense of the welfare of campus work
ers. As Stanford is a model for other institu
tions in this country, we need to be especial
ly mindful of setting a standard for fair labor
practices.
The proposal: A code of conduct
The Coalition for Labor Justice — repre
senting over ten student groups — has been
asking Hennessy for more than two years to
commit to a policy that would ensure that all
campus workers are fairly and decendy
treated. More specifically, the Coalition
seeks a commitment from the University to
develop a comprehensive code of conduct
through a process that substantially includes
students and workers. Such a code of con
duct would:
Raise the bar for fair compensation with
a real living wage and affordable health care
for all workers in the Stanford community,
including subcontracted workers, Stanford
Hospital workers, Webb Ranch workers
and temporary workers;
Ensure equal pay for equal work as sub
contracted workers would earn the same
pay as directly-hired workers doing compa
rable jobs;
Facilitate workers' access to campus re-

sources by providing educational opportu
nities for workers on campus and support of
already-existing student-run educational
programs;
Give workers a voice at work by allowing
them freedom to choose a union without
worker interference.
This year marks a critical point in the sta
tus of our community's labor standards.
Momentum has been built in the direction
of a code of conduct through the hard work
of workers and students. The Coalition for
Labor Justice has grown in numbers and
visibility: 400 people attended the April
Community Day rally and 500 signed an on
line petition to support ABM janitors over
the course of only four days.
In partnership with workers, students
can and have made a difference: improve
ments to our community's labor policies
have taken place with the growing support.
We cannot be satisfied as long as there are
Stanford families who cannot afford to take
their partners to the doctor when they be
come sick because they lack adequate health
benefits or who cannot support their chil
dren in their schoolwork because they must
work two jobs to cover basic costs. As stu
dents, we must understand that our actions
can affect families and have real conse
quences for them. We cannot allow unjust
labor practices to exist on our campus.

The coalition will host a press conference today at
noon in the Main Quad. Hai Binh Nguyen is a
sophomore majoring in Asian American studies.
She can be reached at haihinh@stanford.edu.
Anna Sale is a senior majoring in history. She can
be reached at annasale@stanford.edu. Both are
members of the Coalition for IjaborJustice.
I oday, Stanford students will begin a fast
to call upon the University to raise its labor
standards in light of the seriousness of prob
lems facing workers on campus. These stu
dents are challenging the administration to
create a comprehensive labor policy — a
"code of conduct" — that would address the
situation of all Stanford workers.
Campus Workers Continue to Struggle
For the past two years, workers at Stan
ford had to fight for job security — in die
112 ace of increasing subcontracting — for bet
ter staffing, decent wages and affordable
health care. Recently, subcontracted janito
rial workers at Stanford were on the verge of
striking for affordable health care, and
workers at Tresidder were fighting to keep
working at the student union after Bon Ap
petit leaves. Those same Tresidder workers
had to fight for decent wages and health in
surance last spring.
Although workers at Stanford have been
able to achieve real gains through collective
action, many continue to struggle with seri
ous problems. Right now, workers at Webb
Ranch — the lowest paid workers on Uni
versity land at $7.25 per hour — are trying
to obtain living wages and health care. Many
other Stanford workers cannot afford a de
cent standard of living. Most temporary and
subcontracted workers, for instance, earn
around $20,000 each year; many of these
workers live in areas such as San Jose where
rent fora one-bedroom apartment typically
costs around $ 15,000 a year.
