# Shopping center may be leased
## The 						University considers leasing the Stanford Shopping Center, a move that might prove quite profitable 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Shopping Center may be changing
hands, as the University is investigating leasing the center.
"It is an opportune time to sell quality retail invest
ment properties, and Stanford wanted to test the wa
ters with regard to the Shopping Center," said David
Longbine, director of the shopping center.
The University is unable to sell the land because of
a stipulation Leland Stanford made in his land grant
to the University, but they are allowed to lease it.
"Stanford built the center on campus land in 1956,
on the former dairy farm, and has expanded it sever
al times since," Longbine said. He added that investi
gating leasing options is not due to any failure on the
part of the shopping center.
"The center is profitable," Longbine said. "It is the
top sales producing center in the Bay Area and one of

the top centers in the U.S."
The possibility of leasing the shopping center aris
es during a profitable time for retail properties, ac
cording to the Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Jour
nal. The University potentially stands to gain sub
stantially from leasing the center.
No official decisions have yet been made.
"There is no certainty that a ground lease will
occur since we are testing the waters," Longbine said.
"Time will tell."
Everyday operations at the shopping center will
continue in largely the same manner regardless of
what decision is eventually made.
"We do not anticipate any major changes in the op
erations of the Shopping Center if a ground lease did
occur," Longbine said.
The lease operator would take care of day-to-day op
erations and garner the lease revenue Stanford current
ly receives, Bill Phillips, managing director of the Stan
ford Management Company, told the Palo Alto Weekly.
The University would receive the initial payment for the
contract as well as 25 percent of the center's income.
The Business Journal reported that Phillips' office
hired Eastdil Realty to investigate leasing possibilities
and that the University will likely make a decision by
the end of the summer.

Although Leland Stanford's land grant prohibits the University from selling the Stanford Shopping Center, the possi
bility of leasing it is currently being explored.
