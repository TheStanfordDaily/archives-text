## Superfly snatches Ultimate title 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
After outscoring their opponents
652-224 and dropping only one game
during the regular season, Superfly,
the Stanford women's Ultimate team,
headed to the 2003 College Nationals
with hopes of bringing home the
fourth title in school history.
This weekend, those hopes became
reality. Superfly fought through five
other ranked squads to face MIT in
the championship game, where the
women defeated the Beavers 15-13.
Stanford team captain and senior
Gwen Ambler called Sunday's contest
in Austin, Texas a "grudge match," as
Superfly's meeting with MIT at last
year's nationals ended in a brutal loss
for Stanford.
Superfly and the Beavers put on an
exciting back-and-forth display in the
first half as neither team could man
age scoring twice in a row. The
Beavers won the half, with a score of
8-7.
The second half included several

more lead changes and more than 20
turnovers. As the game wore on, Stan
ford began to rely not only on their
seasoned veterans but also on their in
credible lineup of freshmen, includ
ing Northwest Region Rookie of the
Year Jess Guh.
But late in the game with the score
tied 13-13, seniors Rosie O'Gara and
Erin Lapping connected on back-to
back plays, scoring the final two points
to secure the title for Superfly.
Superfly is no stranger to the title
game, having advanced to the finals in
each of its seven nationals appear
ances. Ending the season with a win
and a national championship, howev
er, has been a long time coming.
After Superfly's last championship
season in 1999, the team didn't even
make 2000 nationals. The past two
years, the women have walked onto
the field in the title game only to be
sent home following disappointing
losses.
This was the first season in recent
memory that Stanford didn't tromp
the competition at Northwest Region

als. Cross-bay rival California, which
normally sends out a mediocre Ulti
mate team, made a complete turn
around this year and handed Super
fly its only loss of the season in the final
game of regionals, securing the No. 1
seed at nationals.
Ambler, who was recently named
the runner-up for the College Ulti
mate MVP Award, believes that the
team's struggle at regionals earlier
this month had a lot to do with its suc
cess at nationals.
"The tough competition that we
faced at Northwest Regionals was piv
otal in preparing us," Ambler said.
"We got experience coming from be
hind to win games and [the team] had
already seen some of the best players
in the nation."
That experience enabled Superfly
to score twice as many points as its op
ponents in the tournament.
Coupled with yet another success
ful regular season, the championship
has once again solidified Superfly's
place as the most impressive women's
Ultimate club in the country.
