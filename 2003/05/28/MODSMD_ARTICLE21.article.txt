# Triathlon team takes off
## 
### NATHAN KURZ EDITORIAL STAFF 
Three years ago, the Stanford
triathlon team was swimming in the
putrid Roble pool and had a virtually
non-existent budget.
Now they've got an ever-growing
squad and an individual national
championship to boot.
At the recent Triathlon College
Nationals in Peoria, Arizona, the
Cardinal claimed its best showing in
its short history: an individual men's
title and an overall third place team
finish.
Eric Bean, who has been the team's
coach since its inception in 2000 and
received his master's from Stanford
in 2002, became the men's champion
with a time of 1:54.50, nearly four
minutes faster than the second-place
finisher.
Bean won the individual title last
year, but due to his status as a profes
sional triathlete, he was forced to race
in the "exhibition" category — and
not with Stanford.
This year, the rules changed, so
Bean was allowed to bring the title
home to the Farm.
"I felt a sense of relief," he said. "I
felt my performance wasn't just for
myself but also helped motivate my
team."
In addition to competing and
coaching at the collegiate level, Bean
has been a mainstay on the pro tour
since 1999. His travels have taken
him to Mexico and much of Western
Europe, though his racing record has
been unspectacular — he recorded

one win in 1999 and several top-10
finishes over the last few years.
Bean's best finish at the world
renowned World Championship
Ironman competition in Hawaii was
in 2001, when he came in 36th.
The collegiate nationals is deemed
an "Olympic" distance race since ath
letes compete in the full-length swim
(1,500 meters) in the waters of Lake
Pleasant, then bike (40 kilometers)
and run (10 kilometers) through the
saguaros and rolling hills of the Ari
zona desert.
In the team competition, the
squad's three fastest men and women
come together and combine their
times to provide a team time.
Bean combined with senior Daniel
Paris (fifth place), grad student Jesse
Czelusta (64th), medical student
Megan Fix (third), and grad students
Cherie Stancik (14th) and Anna Tim
bie (34th) to rack up a team time of
13:34.21.
Stanford finished nationals in
third place for the third consecutive
year, behind defending champion
Colorado and Cal Poly (San Luis
Obsipo).
The triathlon is a physically grueling
and intense sport, and in order to be
competitive in collegiate races, count
less factors have to come together.
"The sport is all about breaking
down physical and psychological bar
riers," said Czelusta, who was the
Cardinal's third-best men's finisher
"Knowing that you've laid everything
on the line and left your last nickel on
the course leaves you with a sense of
accomplishment."

Club president Julia Nelson offers
another viewpoint on the rigors of
competition.
"Triathlon is a team sport in the
sense that it is something done more
easily together than alone," she said.
"You need those people there to push
you to get through the long workouts,
to be companions and supporters
and to push you to be better, faster
and stronger."
Despite the incredible athleticism
necessary in the triathlon, the sport is
not yet recognized by the NCAA.
League rules dictate that there must
be at least 40 varsity teams in a given
sport before it's eligible for official sta
tus — and not a single varsity squad
currently exists.

But the triathlon team can follow
the molds fashioned by the Cardinal
synchronized swimming and sailing
programs — two sports that have re
cently grown and had major success
es at Stanford.
And if this year is any indication,
Bean and company are well on their
way. The team sent a all-time high of
38 participants to Arizona.
"Looking down the road, I see
great things in store for Stanford
triathlon," Czelusta said. "I expect us
to become the largest, fastest and most
vital collegiate club in the country.
"The South Bay is a perfect loca
tion for training, and we have the
foundation and resources with which
to build [a great program]."
