After watching Annika Sorenstam's play in the
Colonial Golf Tournament in Fort Worth,
Texas, I derided to go to the streets to gauge
the public perception of a woman participat
ing in men's professional athletic competition. The di
vergence of views was striking:
Jessica Van Dyke, attorney, San Francisco — "Anni
ka's performance this weekend was empowering,
courageous and revolutionary. It may have only been
a small step in the world of golf but it was a huge victo
ry for womankind. I am so inspired by Ana's imposing
drives, pinpoint accuracy and most of all her com
manding composure on the course.
It is great to finally see a woman recognized for her
skills and talents and not her anatomy as typical men
would try to objectify her to. I think that all middle

school- and high school-aged girls
should be shown clips of her stellar
performance in order that they would
have a worthy role model to look to,
rather than women that parade
around in bikinis.
Ana beat notable golfers such as
former PGA champion Mark Brooks
and Bob Estes, who is currently
ranked 16th in the world. It is not

only her impressive score of 4-over par that captured
women around the globe but that a woman finally
had the confidence to enter into a male dominated
sport and show them just what we are made of."
Gordie Greensboro, lawn care equipment distribu
tor, Asheville, NC — "I'm sick and tired of hearing
about how well Annika Sorenstam performed at the
Colonial golf tournament. Since when is finishing tied
for 96th place good for anything but a hearty laugh
and a kick in the ass on your way out the door? This is
America and in America we don't praise people for not
finishing last. That's the kind of thing they do in Rus
sia or Canada.
It serves her right that the big boys roughed her
up on the golf course. She should have just been
satisfied with being the best female golfer in the
world but then she had to go and try to prove some
thing. All she did was prove that even the best fe
male golfer of all time can't cut it on the real PGA
tour.
People keep throwing around the words 'coura
geous' and 'revolutionary' to describe her. Yeah, like it
takes a Che Guevara to get beaten by 95 other dudes
and be knocked out of contention without making the
cut. Should I really be in awe of the fact that she didn't
run off the course screaming with her nine-iron be
tween her legs?
She competed against men and she got the crap
beaten out of her, plain and simple. And it's not as if
she was playing particularly poorly. She hit her fair
ways and her greens but just couldn't keep up with the
superior driving and long range ability of the male
players.
While the physical disparities between the genders
are not as pronounced in golf as in other sports, such
as football or basketball, it's still a man's sport that re
quires power. Society should just accept the fact that
there are activities at which men and women are in
deed unequal. This is golf we're talking about here, not
making delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
The worst part of the whole fiasco is that Annika
isn't even all that pretty. I mean, if we're going to be
forced to watch some woman parade around in a
man's sport, the least women could do is provide us
with an exceptionally attractive female. That way,
even though she's wasting valuable time that could be
spent bringing me a sandwich or doing some sit-ups
or something, we at least would have something to
look at."
