# Go in' clubbing:
## The
						sport of innovation 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Do you watch DVDs? Put your hands
up to motion detectors on faucets? Shoot
photos with a digital camera? Much of the
time, it's quite evident how technology af
fects our day-to-day lives. But there are
also a lot of other, less visible places in
which technology influences our lives
One such area is sporting equipment.
It is easy to overlook how much of a factor
new, improved materials and construc
tions have impacted sports. We looked at
golf clubs, sports shoes and sunglasses.
Golf has been drastically affected by the
use of stronger, lighter shaft material as
well as new styles of irons, woods and dri
vers.
"In the last decade or so, [manufac
tures] have gotten even more into
perimeter weighting," said Stanford golf
instructor Jim Miller. "It redistributes the
weight with a lower center of gravity, al
lowing you to get the ball higher into the
air. It's a little more user-friendly."
Much of the drive to introduce new
technology into golf equipment has
stemmed from the desire to make golf ap
peal to the casual player.
"The biggest thing that [manufactur
ers] are going to be working on is to make
the game more fun for the masses, the
public," Miller said. "That's why these
[new] clubs and this equipment are great
... it's good for the game. The pros could
play with four different major sets and
one or two kinds of balls. It's good for
everybody else to have all these different
items."
We took a look at the new Cobra and
Wilson drivers and irons and the Scotty
Cameron putter.
The King Cobra SS 427 driver pro
vides a good balance of power and con
trol. The club features a thin 15-3-3-3
Beta Titanium insert that is more cleanly
and uniformly bonded to the driver face
by a new plasma welding process, which
enlarges the sweet spot of the club, mak
ing it easier for the average golfer to use.
The grip fit well in my hand and felt good.
One thing to note is that this club was
slightly long for the shorter golfer.
For irons, Cobra has the King Cobra
SS-I irons. The addition of a urethane
insert to the backs of the clubs helps ab
sorb the vibration associated with thin
face, large cavity irons. The insert, in
combination with a softer 431-alloy con

struction versus 17-4 steel and slightly
stronger lofts, promotes longer distance
and softer feel. Club length felt good and
the weighting of the clubs led to a smooth
swing.
Wilson's Deep Red II Distance Driver is
designed for the majority of players looking
for maximum distance, accuracy and for
giveness when choosing a driver. It features
an oversized 400 CC club head and larger
sweet spot. A .428 tip Grafalloy Pro Lite+
Fat Shaft optimizes accuracy by reducing
twisting of the club head at impact. While
club head sizes have drastically increased in
recent years, shaft size has remained almost
the same. The club length seemed a better
fit for an average-height golfer.
Fat Shaft technology is even more
prominent on Wilson's Deep Red Irons.
The head is 9 percent larger than the pre
vious Fat Shaft Iron model and features a
larger sweet spot for more forgiveness.
There is a new Fluid Feel Urethane In
sert, a lightweight insert consisting of an
interlocking web of soft and hard ure
thane placed in the cavity that absorbs vi
brations fora soft feel.
The Scotty Cameron Studio Stainless
Laguna 2.5 is inspired by Brad Faxon, al
legedly one of the PGA Tour's all-time
greatest putters. Its new thin heel and full
toe back flange design and Studio Stain
less construction makes the putter an ex
cellent choice for anyone who values per
formance. What I have to say about this
putter is that it provided a very solid, con
sistent performance. Though one will
have to get used to the fact that the face is
set slightly angled back from the line of
the grip, once that is mastered, balls just
drop into the cup.
All of the clubs we looked at featured
innovative improvements for enhanced
distance, accuracy and feel. However,
there are drawbacks to such marked ad
vances in club technology.
"[New drivers] have made some of the
older golf courses obsolete," Miller said.
"Titanium clubs are overpowering tradi
tional golf courses. I like the older golf
courses and it would be sad if the equip
ment made the players hit the balls so
hard that they can't play these courses."
Shoes play a very important part in any
athletic activity. We looked at Nike bas
ketball and running shoes and Oakley
golf shoes and boots.
Nike has spent more than 16 years de
veloping Shox, the first cushioning em
ploying springs attached to the soles of the

shoes. The principle behind Shox is to
add spring to the steps of athletes leading

to improved performance
without compromising

protection or stability.
The technological
breakthrough is
found in the spring- I
like columns in the
heel of the shoe. The

columns are produced in a mold
ing process similar to materials

used to reduce shock in high
performance vehicles. Shox
technology has been engi
neered to meet the unique de
mands of the top three sports
categories — running, cross

training and basketball.
For basketball, we looked
at the Shox Supremacy.
This basketball shoe pro
vides a snug fit and ankle

support to prevent in
juries. The traction provided in

both indoor and outdoor surfaces was
superb. The Shox definitely provided an
extra little boost for jumping.

Nike is also commit
ted to providing a full
line of women's
footwear. We looked
at the Shox NZ run-

ning shoe. Again, the
Shox technology provid
ed a noticeable improve
ment over ordinary
shoes. There was an
extra bounce in our evalu-

ator's stride when she was wearing
Shox. While Shox delivers great perfor
mance, Shox shoes have typically been
on the more expensive side of Nike's of
ferings. As more models are becoming
available, price seems to be going down.
For those looking to personalize every
thing from the insole color to lettering
on the side of the shoes, check out

Nike's NikelD.com.
Oakley has a new addition to their
line of golf shoes: the Bow Tye. The

shoe is made of genuine leather with per
formance coating. An injection molded
shank oflers a stable, supportive base with
torsion control fora smooth

swing while a non-slip
heel keeps the foot in *
place. The shoe pro-

vided great traction during the entire
swing and was comfortable to wear, even
at the end of a full round of golf.
Oakley is such a trusted name that the
U.S. Special Forces use Oakley footwear
in the field. Now available for civilian use,
the Flite Special Forces Standard-Issue

Assault Boot is a blend of utility and com
fort. The boot, which has been put
through the punishment of extended
marches, fast rope helicopter insertions,

HALO (High Altitude / Low Opening)
and HAHO (High Altitude / High Open-

ing) parachute jumps by the military,
showed very little wear and tear

after extensive tests. VVe expect the
boot to last quite a while under

almost any kind of use.
The assault boot is
k braced by an over
'/ the-ankle boot shaft
1 and shielded by
abrasion-resistant
panels on soft top-

grain leather. Compre
hensive moisture control
maximizes comfort and

Y advanced polymer EVA and
premium urethane offer re
silient shock absorption.
For sunglasses, we took a look at

what Oakley, which is arguably one of the
leaders in sunglass technology, has to
offer. The Valve, one of Oakley's newest
models, features an O Matter frame and
the Mag Switch has the world's first fully
sculpted Thixo injection-molded magne
sium frame.
The material compris-

ing the O Matter
frame is amazingly
light and surpris
ingly durable. It is
easy to forget that
u you're wearing
' the Valve be
cause t hey feel so

natural. While not as
resilient as the magnesium frame, O Mat
ter is far lighter and the Valve is an es
sential accessory for any outdoor sport.

With 23 parts, the Mag Switch is an im
pressive piece of eyewear. The initial
stage of production includes a casting
process that requires more than 200
tons of force. Liquefied at 1100°F, the

performance alloy is injected into preci
sion-engineered molds within a time
frame of less than 30 milliseconds. This
results in a frame that was virtually un
damaged even in our more intense test
ing. In fact, while the magnesium frame is

somewhat more expensive than O Matter,
it is worth the price — these glasses will last.
Both glasses surpass ANSI Industrial
Standards for impact protection. A

benefit of Oak
ley's line of
sunglasses is

that once you,re done playing
for the day, these glasses are incredi-

bly stylish and can be worn on their own.
Recent innovations in sporting tech
nology have made equipment easier to
use and more comfortable for the ama
teur and professional athlete alike.
