# Stanford employees donate less to Dems

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford employees donate far
less to the Democratic Party than
their colleagues at other top uni
versities, a recent study by the
nonpartisan Center for Respon
sive Politics determined. While 75
percent of donations from Stan
ford employees still went to the
Democratic Party, most of Stan
ford's peer institutions saw more
than 80 percent of contributions
going to Democrats.
While Stanford employees
contribute more money on aver
age to political parties and candi
dates than the majority of their
peer institutions, less of these

funds are donated to the Democ
ratic Party than at other schools,
including those in the Ivy League
and the University of California
system.
According to the survey, Stan
ford employees made $ 177,422 in
political contributions during the
last two years, with 75 percent of
this money going to the Democra
tic Party. Stanford ranked fourth
in total donations.
Harvard led the pack with
$516,810 in contributions, with
96 percent going to the Democ
rats. The UC system placed sec
ond with $268,425 in donations,
82 percent of which went to De
mocrats. Eighty-seven percent of
donations from Princeton em

ployees and 83 percent of dona
tions from University of Pennsyl
vania employees went to Democ
rats.
In contrast, 62 percent of do
nations from Columbia Universi
ty employees and 54 percent of
donations from University of
Texas employees went to Democ
rats.
Totals were derived from
amounts given by individual con
tributors who identified them
selves as employees of specific col
leges or education groups. The
study's statistics include dona
tions made by campus political ac
tion committees and "soft money"
contributors.
No data exist on exactly how

much Stanford faculty members
contribute to political organiza
tions or to which organizations or
candidates they contribute. The
University administration em
phasized the private nature of this
information.
"I have no idea and no way of
knowing how much Stanford fac
ulty members contribute to any
political party," said Provost John
Etchemendy. "But faculty are
quite well informed about politi
cal issues and so one would cer
tainly hope that they also partici
pate fully in the political system.
"It would be frightening if Uni
versity administration kept track
