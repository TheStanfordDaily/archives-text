# Stanford employees donate less to Dems
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford employees donate far
less to the Democratic Party than
their colleagues at other top uni
versities, a recent study by the
nonpartisan Center for Respon
sive Politics determined. While 75
percent of donations from Stan
ford employees still went to the
Democratic Party, most of Stan
ford's peer institutions saw more
than 80 percent of contributions
going to Democrats.
While Stanford employees
contribute more money on aver
age to political parties and candi
dates than the majority of their
peer institutions, less of these

funds are donated to the Democ
ratic Party than at other schools,
including those in the Ivy League
and the University of California
system.
According to the survey, Stan
ford employees made $ 177,422 in
political contributions during the
last two years, with 75 percent of
this money going to the Democra
tic Party. Stanford ranked fourth
in total donations.
Harvard led the pack with
$516,810 in contributions, with
96 percent going to the Democ
rats. The UC system placed sec
ond with $268,425 in donations,
82 percent of which went to De
mocrats. Eighty-seven percent of
donations from Princeton em

ployees and 83 percent of dona
tions from University of Pennsyl
vania employees went to Democ
rats.
In contrast, 62 percent of do
nations from Columbia Universi
ty employees and 54 percent of
donations from University of
Texas employees went to Democ
rats.
Totals were derived from
amounts given by individual con
tributors who identified them
selves as employees of specific col
leges or education groups. The
study's statistics include dona
tions made by campus political ac
tion committees and "soft money"
contributors.
No data exist on exactly how

much Stanford faculty members
contribute to political organiza
tions or to which organizations or
candidates they contribute. The
University administration em
phasized the private nature of this
information.
"I have no idea and no way of
knowing how much Stanford fac
ulty members contribute to any
political party," said Provost John
Etchemendy. "But faculty are
quite well informed about politi
cal issues and so one would cer
tainly hope that they also partici
pate fully in the political system.
"It would be frightening if Uni
versity administration kept track

of political affiliation," he added.
Members of the faculty and ad
ministration acknowledged that
many Stanford employees tend to
be politically liberal, consistent
with the center's conclusion that
most people employed in higher
education appear to favor the De
mocratic Party.
"University faculties in gener
al — especially elite university facul
ties— are disproportionately De
mocratic in their party affiliation
and liberal in their ideological ori
entation," said Morris Fiorina, a

professor of political science and
Hoover Institution fellow. "Stan
ford is not unusual in this regard."
According to Etchemendy,
there are no University policies re
stricting legal donations to political
candidates or parties by employ
ees. He did not advance a theory as
to why Stanford employees appear
to favor the Democratic Party less
than at other schools.
"Studies show that, in general,
humanities faculty are the most
liberal, social science faculty next
and science and engineering,
least," Fiorina said. "Given that
Stanford has emphasized the sci
ences relatively more and the hu
manities relatively less than other
elite universities, that might ac

count for Stanford being some
what less liberal."
Although University President
John Hennessy didn't comment
on the possible existence of a lib
eral bias on campus, he suggested
that the smaller percentage of
funds given to Democrats might
be related to the higher cost of liv
ing near the University, leading
to less disposable income and
causing employees to donate to
fewer organizations.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said, "Probably most facul
ty are apolitical and prefer to do
their research and teach without
reference to politics. [They] pre
fer not to get involved and not to
give money to political parties

since that is not tax deductible."
Regardless of contribution
amount and party affiliations,
Zimbardo expressed his belief
that Stanford faculty should be
more involved in the political
arena.
"Faculty, whether Democrat or
Republican or Independent,
should dissent against the policies
of the current administration," he
said, "ft would be unpatriotic not
to recognize the elements of a fas
cist take-over of our government
by the Pentagon, religious right,
mega-corporations and anti-envi
ronment forces that, together,
represent the most formidable
enemies of at rue democracy the
United States has ever faced."

to favor the Democratic Party less
than at other schools.
"Studies show that, in general,
humanities faculty are the most
liberal, social science faculty next
and science and engineering,
least," Fiorina said. "Given that
Stanford has emphasized the sci
ences relatively more and the hu
manities relatively less than other
elite universities, that might ac

count for Stanford being some
what less liberal."
Although University President
John Hennessy didn't comment
on the possible existence of a lib
eral bias on campus, he suggested
that the smaller percentage of
funds given to Democrats might
be related to the higher cost of liv
ing near the University, leading
to less disposable income and
causing employees to donate to
fewer organizations.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo said, "Probably most facul
ty are apolitical and prefer to do
their research and teach without
reference to politics. [They] pre
fer not to get involved and not to
give money to political parties

since that is not tax deductible."
Regardless of contribution
amount and party affiliations,
Zimbardo expressed his belief
that Stanford faculty should be
more involved in the political
arena.
"Faculty, whether Democrat or
Republican or Independent,
should dissent against the policies
of the current administration," he
said, "ft would be unpatriotic not
to recognize the elements of a fas
cist take-over of our government
by the Pentagon, religious right,
mega-corporations and anti-envi
ronment forces that, together,
represent the most formidable
enemies of at rue democracy the
United States has ever faced."
