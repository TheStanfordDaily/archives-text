# CDC abandons Monstertrak

### ANDREW HENDEL 
The Career Development Center will switch job
search engines from Monstertrak to Cardinal Careers
on August 2. Stanford will have more control over the
new interface, which will be a part of a large non-prof
it organization currently being implemented by col
leges nationwide.
Lance Choy, director of the CDC, said that Stanford
and other universities stopped encouraging the use of
Monstertrak because they were concerned with Mon
stertrak's increasing market domination.
Stanford students have grown accustomed to Mon
stertrak, but have had mixed results with the service.
"It helped me find jobs in the past but it has not
helped me find anything this year," said senior Julie
Chen.
Sophomore Steve Myrick, who is also searching for
a job this summer, said, "It's easy to use but it has not
been too effective for me."
Senior Jen Jue agreed that Monstertrak is a user
friendly interface.
"I got my summer internship through it last sum
mer," she said. "All you have to do is send out your re
sume. You just click a button and it does it for you.
There is a lot of variety in the types of jobs they post
there."
While students seem to find Monstertrak satisfacto
ry, employers have been less pleased.
Monstertrak increased the employer's price for list
ing jobs at a given university from $12 to $25, and Choy
said that, if given monopoly power, they would likely
raise it even more. Because of the glowing search cost,
employers have complained to the CDC and posted
fewer offerings.
"There has been a great deal of consolidation in the
business," Choy said. "Competitors have either gone
bankrupt or they have been bought out. There are es
sentially two vendors, Monster and Experience, and if
Experience goes out of business
that will essentially make Monster a
monopoly."
Where Monstertrak charged
money, Cardinal Careers will let
employers post jobs lor tree. If em
ployers want to list jobs for multiple
schools, they can pay a $ 12 fee.
In addition to charging employ
ers less, Cardinal Careers will in
crease the Web site's security and
better protect students' passwords.
The site will also add new func
tions. Choy said that an important
addition will be a search agent ca
pability. Students will be able to
enter the fields in which they are in
terested, and students will auto
matically be e-mailed an alert when
new jobs are listed in those areas.
Currently, the CDC sends a weekly
letter.
Choy said that Monstertrak
never provided that useful service
because it was not in their interest.
"Their philosophy is, they want
people to come to their page be
cause the students will see adver
tisements, and Monstertrak gets
money from that," he said.
Stanford will own the data that is
posted to Cardinal Careers. Cur
rently, Monstertrak owns the infor
mation that is listed on its site. Em
ployers could post jobs for Stanford
students only and Monstertrak
would own the information about
those jobs.
Choy said that aside from those
differences, Cardinal Careers will
essentially provide the same service
as Monstertrak. The layout will
likely be similar, and the login from
the CDC's Web site will take people
into Cardinal Careers.
Choy recognized that Cardinal
Careers will be competing with
Monstertrak.
"There is a battle for the college
population because whoever con
trols it gets a revenue stream," he
said.
However, Choy said, the CDC
will still encourage students to also
use Monstertrak because it is a re
source for employment opportuni
ties that may not be listed on Cardi
nal Careers.
