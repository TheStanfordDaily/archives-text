## Don't dodge Vyapar 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
SuVyapar, a new social entrepre
neurial project launched this year at
Stanford, aims to create an innova
tive business model that helps the
developing world.
The project was founded by
Stanford Reuters Digital Vision Fel
low Sanjay Bhargava, who has
worked with companies such as
Citibank and was one of the found
ing members of Pay Pal.
Junior Ramit Sethi, who works
with the social persuasion aspect of
SuVyapar, said that the idea behind
Bhargava's project is to "connect
rural artisans to the huge U.S. con
sumer market."
According to Sethi, SuVyapar
sets up the infrastructure to facilitate
this connection.
SuVyapar currendy supplies cot
ton quilts from an artisan communi
ty in India. It hopes to expand to in
clude 10,000 communities world
wide and have $1 billion in rev
enues.
"We've created a unique infra
structure that removes the 'friction'
from the process — saving money
on development, marketing, etc.,"
Sethi said. "We can send that extra
money back to the artisans."
SuVyapar primarily uses the
Web to sell their idea. Part of Sedii's
responsibilities include targeting
college audiences. He uses campus
e-mail lists to spread the word. Su-
Vyapar has also initiated a contest in
which students can win a year of
free laundry by spreading the idea.
Using die power of the Internet
and viral marketing, SuVyapar
drastically cuts advertising costs.
"It's direct," Sethi said. "It gives
more money back to the artisans."
The name for SuVyapar comes
from the term "good trade" in San
skrit. The goal is that 70 percent of
SuVyapar's revenues return to the
developing country, with 45 percent
going to the local exporter and 25
percent to the artisan community.
Additionally, SuVyapar is able to cut
prices for its products. While similar
quilts might sell for more than $200
in boutiques, SuVyapar sells quilts
for approximately $60.

"Our approach is high volume
and low margin," Bhargava said in
SuVyapar's executive summary.
The low price in intended to in
crease demand and profit.
Their current strategy is not to
merely sell products but to embody
a concept: the Community Friendly
Movement.
The movement aims to "give con
sumers the opportunities to get
unique products at bargain prices
and help communities," Bhargava
said. "The cool tiling about commu
nity friendly products is they cost less
because retail waste is eliminated,
and yet diere is room for donations
and fair returns. The Internet plays a
large role in making this possible."
The idea behind social entrepre
neurship is "using entrepreneur
ship to help people," Sethi said.
"[lt's] being entrepreneurial, being
risky and assuming that's going to
have big benefits for the people in
need."
Bhargava added, "To me, the
key goal of social entrepreneurship
is to remove despair and instill hope
... Even without emotional appeals
it is clear that social entrepreneur
ship makes economic sense. Good
social entrepreneurship enables
people and does not make them de
pendent."
Social entrepreneurship at
tempts to pair the profit motive with
social benefit. Sethi describes this
phenomenon as the "double bot
tom line" of a social entrepreneurial
project such as SuVyapar.
When asked about the possibility
of SuVyapar's altruistic purpose
being diluted with the addition of
profit-motivated venture capitalists,
Bhargava replied, "I do not see
much of a conflict. An enabling plat
form must have economies of scale
and minimal rules."
Bhargava hopes that the site, lo
cated at www.suvy.com, will attract
attention from venture capitalists.
Bhargava sees the project as a
small way of changing the world.
"I think a lot of Stanford under
graduates believe that too," he said.
"I hope some of diem get excited
about CFM and use it as a lever to
make a real difference while they
are at Stanford."
