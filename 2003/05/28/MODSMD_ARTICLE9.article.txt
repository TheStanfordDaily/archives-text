## A 						shift in the fight against terrorism: Bush accuses Iran of al-Qaida links 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administration ac
cused Iran yesterday of harboring al-Qaida militants and
said it was worth checking a claim by an Iranian opposition
group that the Islamic government was secretly construct
ing two uranium enrichment plants.
"We are pressing the Iranians to end their support for
terror, including the harboring of al-Qaida terrorists," said
presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer.
He described as insufficient the steps that Iran claims to
have taken to rein in the terrorist group.
Ruling out force for the time being, Fleischer said the
United States is addressing the terrorism and nuclear is
sues through diplomacy.
At the State Department, Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell told reporters that U.S. contacts with Iran will continue.
Iran has turned over some al-Qaida militants since Sept.
11 and has denied that it is harboring any of its members.
That assertion is disputed by U.S. officials. Concern
about the Iran-al-Qaida link rose sharply after intelligence
reports suggested that operatives of the terrorist group in
Iran had a role in the May 12 terrorist bombing in Saudi
Arabia that killed 34 people, including eight Americans.
Privately, officials said that despite the similarities be
tween Iran and prewar Iraq on both terrorism and
weapons, it would be wrong to assume that military action
will be used in Iran, just as it was in Iraq.
The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) said
informants inside Iran had made known the existence of
two secret uranium enrichment facilities that are under
construction about 40 miles west of Tehran.
A spokeswoman, Soona Samsami, told a news confer
ence that the facilities will serve as adjuncts of a larger en
richment facility in the city of Natanz. She estimated that
Iran could have a nuclear bomb by 2005.
The NCRI has been designated as a foreign terrorist or
ganization by the State Department for years. But it gained
some credibility here for having exposed the Narantz facil
ity last August. That disclosure gave greater weight to the
administration's claim that Iran is attempting to develop
nuclear weapons.
