# IFC names Sigma Nu chapter of the year
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Interfraternity Council announced
yesterday that the Sigma N u fraternity has re
ceived the first IFC Chapter of the Year
award.
"The IFC created the Chapter of the Year
award to acknowledge one chapter that has
contributed greatly to our campus," said IFC
Vice President Steve Myrick, a sophomore.
"We are proud to present this year's award to
Sigma Nu.
"As they prepare to move into a new house
next year, they have maintained exemplary
academic standards and philanthropy events,
as well as a much-appreciated involvement in
the campus social scene," he added. "We look
forward to next year, as other chapters try to
match Sigma Nu's contributions."
Sigma Nu was awarded housing by Resi
dential Education in January 2002 and will
move into 557 Mayfield for the upcoming aca
demic year. Res Ed cited Sigma Nu's commu
nity involvement both on and off campus and
its ability to meet housing requirements as
strong components of its housing application.
Sigma Nu will become the seventh housed
fraternity at Stanford.
"We're really excited — we're really, really
excited about it," said junior Zach Gerson,
president of Sigma Nu, about receiving the
award. "Especially with moving into the
house next year, I see it as a great sign that
we're on the right track, and hopefully it will
inspire us to use the house for the community
next year."

According to IFC members, the chapter of
the year is chosen based on a combination of
community involvement and member accom
plishments. Social involvement in campus
and community service each count for 30 per
cent, and academic credentials and chapter
development, including Rush, pledging and
programming, each count for 20 percent.
Myrick said that the IFC based its decision
primarily on information that the chapters
provided for the Rush prospectus.
According to Gerson, Sigma Nu's commu
nity involvement has included volunteering
at the Bing Nursery Fair and annual Pow
wow, in addition to hosting its biggest event,
the Safeway Sleepout, where members camp
in front of the Menlo Park Safeway to collect
food donations from shoppers.
Gerson said that Sigma Nu was also able to
integrate community service into its biggest
social events, the Sunsplash and Moonsplash
parties.
"While we were setting up, we had a few
hours where we had a sandwich station set
up," Gerson said, explaining that Sigma Nu
brothers and other Stanford students were
able to make peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches to donate to the community.
"Mostly we've put our emphasis into chap
ter development activities, which is more em
phasizing connections within the fraternity,"
Gerson said of Sigma Nu's activities over the
past year. "Particularly, with us not having a
house, it's hard for us to have lots of events to
involve the community because we don't have
a space, a central location where people can
meet up."

Gerson said the fraternity is already plan
ning ways to utilize 557 next year to expand its
community outreach.
"I think we have the potential to do a lot
more in terms of community service, social
events, in terms of bringing in speakers," Ger
son said.
"I'm happy for Sigma Nu in getting it,"
said Joey Greenwell, assistant director of stu
dent activities and fraternity adviser. "Sigma
Nu has done a lot in regards to community
service and academics and giving back to the
community — that's one of the reasons they
were given a house."
Myrick said that the impetus to create the
award came from last year's IFC executive
board, which started working on the award
about a year ago to highlight the contribu
tions of the Greek community.
"Recently, people might have lost sight of
the benefits fraternities have for campus life,"
Myrick said. "All too frequently, fraternities
are visible for the wrong reasons."
Greenwell added, "In The Daily and in
other press, it's so easy to focus when the neg
ative is there that it's hard to focus on the good
the chapters are doing." He added that some
chapters have never been in trouble with the
University, "and yet they get overlooked be
cause of the probation of another chapter."
In the case of Sigma Nu, Gerson said re
ceiving the award has galvanized the chapter
to build off of its work this year to increase its
community involvement next year.
"It's really exciting — not only to recog
nize what we've done, but what we'll be capa
ble of doing next year," he said.
