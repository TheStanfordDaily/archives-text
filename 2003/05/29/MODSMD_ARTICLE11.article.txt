# Mobile performance engages audience
## 'Jabberwocky' debuts tonight at Mausoleum 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Tonight marks the premiere of
"Jabberwocky" — a unique per
formance piece in which the audi
ence physically moves from site to
site as the show progresses.
The performance is directed
and produced by senior Ava Roy,
who has produced three other au
dience-participatory events in her
last three years at Stanford.
"The shows that Ava does are
unlike any other performance
events," said Sarah Rich, Class of
2002, who is the head chef for the
event, which concludes in a com
munal feast. "[Her shows] break
down all the walls and boundaries
of conventional performance,
inviting everyone present to inter
act in the event as it takes place."
"Jabberwocky" is put together
from the work of Lewis Carroll —
largely from "Through the Look
ing-Glass," as well as "Alice in
Wonderland." The name "Jabber
wocky" comes from a nonsense
poem which Alice finds when she
first crosses the looking glass.
The show will begin at the Stan
ford Mausoleum, with the crew and
audience moving through campus
as the performance progresses.
"Audience members are en
couraged to participate, to enter
spaces that would otherwise be
'exclusive' to the performers and
to experience the show in any way
they desire," Rich said.
Past shows by Roy include an
adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet,"
which began at Tresidder and in
cluded sword fights that led audi
ences to the Quad. She also pro
duced versions of "Hamlet" at the
Cantor Arts Center and "Twelfth
Night," which began at the
School and ended at Hoover
Tower.
"This work is largely for foster
ing community uprising in the
most celebratory of ways," Roy

said. "And it is for sharing the
beauty of this endeavor with the
larger community — the audi
ences who come and play with us
as we share the efforts of our
labors."
She added, "Of course, as an
artist, I am concerned with creat
ing a highly crafted work of art."
"Jabberwocky" is an ongoing
project initiated this past fall with a
small five-person collaborative
team "dedicated to the explo
ration of movement and sound,"
Roy said. This expanded into a
larger group of about 12 people,
who trained together over the
winter in "developing movement
vocabulary and learning to move
fluidly with one another and com
municate nonverbally."
From this group, there are now
nine people who comprise the
Jabberwocky — a group of
dancers, or "living sculptural cre
ations" — within the larger per
formance piece. The total event
involves the group of nine
dancers, a character ensemble of
17 people, several musicians,
chefs, a film maker and several
auxiliary participants. All of these
groups unite together to form the
We Players troupe in this particu
lar performance project.
"Being part of the We Players
productions, whether it be as a
performer or an audience mem
ber, is a full-sensory, highly dy
namic experience," Rich said.
The show will be performed for
the next four nights at 6 p.m. Ad
mission is free and this year is the
first that Roy has received money
for any of her productions. She
has obtained grants from the Un
dergraduate Research Office, the
ASSU, Stage One and the Stanford
Shakespeare Institute.
"The experience is always very
deep," Roy concluded. "I work es
sentially all waking hours on this.
It has been challenging, inspiring,
humbling, strengthening."
