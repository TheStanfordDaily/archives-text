# Stanford to host Sally Ride space camp for girls
## Curriculum focuses on engineering and leadership 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
This summer, over 200 middle
school girls will touch down on
Stanford's campus. These campers
will use the University's facilities to
learn about leadership, friendship,
outdoor activities — and structur
al engineering, bioengineering
and astronomy.
Sally Ride, the first American
woman in space and a Stanford
graduate, is launching her very
own week-long Sally Ride Science
Camps this year to expand upon
the success of her one-day science
festivals held throughout the coun

try over the past year and a half.
In an interview with the San
Francisco Chronicle, Ride said she
was "overwhelmed by the reac
tions we'd get [regarding the festi
vals] . .. The comment we would
get most often from parents at the
festivals was, 'Thank you so much
for introducing my daughters to
role models other than Britney
Spears.'"
Ride is involved with the camp's
planning as a member of its advi
sory board, and she will conduct
video conference calls with the
girls during each of the three camp
sessions. She said she hopes to visit
the camp and meet the girls as
well.
Also on the advisory board is
Jim Plummer, dean of the School
of Engineering. The School of En
gineering serves as the camp's on
campus sponsor.

"We're delighted to do this,"
Plummer said. "[The School of En
gineering] is involved with some of
the planning, designing the cur
riculum, and we have some stu
dents who are volunteering to help
out. It's such a great opportunity,
and I wish I had daughters that
age so that they could take advan
tage of this."
Stefanie Rafanelli will serve as
the camp's executive director.
Rafanelli is also a Stanford gradu
ate, as well as a former varsity soc
cer player. She currently teaches
seventh grade science at Menlo
School.
"I'm so excited to have the op
portunity to work with Ride," she
said. "One of our biggest hopes is to
capture a wonderful natural cu
riosity at a moment when taking
risks is really hard. Girls lose inter
est at this age because it becomes

less cool to take risks and fail, which
is really what science is all about.
We want girls to continue to pursue
their passion by providing a safe
and ungraded environment of all
girls, to nurture their curiosity."
According to studies, such as
one conducted in 2000 by the Ed
ucational Equity of Girls and
Women, National Center for Edu
cation Statistics, girls begin to lose
interest in math and science in
middle school. The 2000 study
showed that in fourth grade, the
number of girls and boys who like
math and science is about equal,
but by eighth grade, twice as many
boys as girls show an interest in
these subjects.
"Girls just don't identify with
these [math and science] career op
tions the way that boys do," Ride told
the Chronicle. "It might just not lx>
as cool to be involved in science, to be
the best person in math class. At the
camp, we'll have women who are
normal, from oceanographers to

rocket scientists. They won't be
wearing pocket protectors."
Campers select a focus subject,
on which the camp's structure cen
ters. Mornings at the University are
spent exploring this concentration
through labs, discussions and guid
ed research. Afternoons and
evenings are spent in traditional
camp activities in crafts and athlet

ics as well as team-building and
leadership training workshops.
Rafanelli emphasized die holistic
importance of the ramp.
"In .ill these realms, we will allow
them to get their voices heard and
not l)e afraid, to capitalize on what all
girls have — a natural curiosity
about the world and a willingness to
explore."
