## War criticism renewed after Rumsfeld talk 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Opponents of the U.S-
British invasion of Iraq renewed their criticism of
the war yesterday after the American defense secre
tary said Iraq may have destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before the war.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, speaking
in New York on Tuesday, said it was possible the
reason Iraqi chemical or biological weapons had
not yet been found, was that Saddam Hussein's
government "decided that they would destroy
them prior to a conflict."
Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was adamant
that Saddam's possession of such weapons justified
going to war, told reporters yesterday that he still
believed the weapons existed.
"I have said throughout and I just repeat to you,
I have absolutely no doubt at all about the existence
of weapons of mass destruction," Blair said on a
flight to Kuwait before he visits British troops in
Iraq today.
"And rather than speculating, let's just wait until
we get the full report back from our people who are
interviewing the Iraqi scientists," he said.
Robin Cook, a former foreign secretary who quit
as leader of the House of Commons in protest
against the war, said Rumsfeld's comments vindi
cated his own stance.

"If Donald Rumsfeld is now admitting the
weapons are not there, the truth is the weapons
probably haven't been there for quite a long
time," Cook told British Broadcasting Corp.
Radio.
"It matters immensely," he said, "because
the basis on which the war was sold to the
British House of Commons, to the British peo

pie, was that Saddam represented a serious
threat."
former Cabinet minister Tony Benn, a left-wing
member of Blair's Labor Party, told LBC radio, "I
believe the prime minister lied to us and lied to us
and lied to us. The whole war was built upon false
hood and I think the long-term damage will be to
democracy in Britain."
