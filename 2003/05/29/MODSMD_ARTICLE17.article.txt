# School closed in SARS scare
## 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — A suburban Toronto high
school was closed and its 1,700 students and staff
placed under quarantine after a classmate showed
symptoms of SARS, health officials said yesterday.
The move means more than 5,000 people in the
Toronto area have been told to stay home for 10 days
as authorities seek to control the spread of a new clus
ter of SARS cases known to have infected 11 people
and to be suspected in 23 others.
Two more elderly patients died, raising the overall
SARS toll to 29 deaths in the Toronto area in the
biggest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syn
drome outside of Asia.
Dr. Colin D'Cunha, the Ontario commissioner of
public health who announced the deaths and latest
figures, said 50 more cases were under investigation
and the number of probable or suspected cases will
rise.
"Absolutely there will be more in the next few
days," said Dr. James Young, the province's commis
sioner of public safety.
Also yesterday, the World Health Organization
advised Canada to broaden its definition of severe
acute respiratory syndrome cases after a health offi
cial expressed concern that the current one provided
an incomplete account of the situation.
Dr. Donald Low, a microbiologist and key figure of
the anti-SARS team dealing with the Toronto-area
outbreak, said the number of new probable cases
would be well over 20 — rather than the current fig
ure of nine — if officials used the same definition ap
plied during the initial outbreak in March and April.
On the Health Canada Web site yesterday, a prob
able case was defined as someone showing a severe
progressive respiratory ailment — a more serious
condition than the WHO definition, a respiratory ail
ment visible on a chest x-ray.
Dr. Denise Werker of the WHO's communicable
diseases section said discussions with Canadian health
authorities yesterday focused on the differing defini
tions.
"In the discussion that has just happened with
Health Canada, we have advised them that it would
be prudent for them to have a case definition that is
more sensitive than the one that they have currently,"
Werker told The Canadian Press from Geneva.
Dr. Paul Gully, a federal health official, said revis
ing the case definition was under consideration.
