## The
						Stanford Daily Reforming Medicaid 
### 
Editorial

The numbers are staggering.
Over 41 million Americans do
not have adequate health insur
ance, including 9.2 million chil
dren. Another 40 million receive Medi
care, a federally financed health care
program primarily serving retirees. Fi
nally, another 40 million Americans re
ceive Medicaid, a joint federal and state
program providing comprehensive
health coverage to low income, disabled
and elderly Americans who have not
been recently employed.
Providing health care for these three
groups has proven to be one of the most
difficult social and political issues of the
last several decades. Despite great ef
forts, no sustainable solutions have
arisen regarding the uninsured. Medi
care premiums and deductibles rise each
year, while fewer physicians and clinics
are accepting Medicare, owing to mas
sive bureaucratic troubles to obtain de
creasing reimbursements. Medicaid
costs have risen so sharply that the feder
al government is considering cutting
large portions from a program previous
ly thought to be untouchable.
The population receiving Medicaid
includes some of the most vulnerable
people in our society: the severely dis
abled, impoverished senior citizens, im
migrants, impoverished urban and rural
families, AIDS and Alzheimer's patients,
the homeless and children in single-par
ent families. Medicaid provides compre
hensive health care coverage, including
hospital, outpatient, prescription drugs
and nursing home care. Yet as the costs
of providing such comprehensive cover
age rise, cash-strapped states are finding
it more difficult to meet their shares of
Medicaid expenses.
In recent months, President George
W. Bush has met privately with a biparti
san group of governors from 10 states to
discuss ways to reduce Medicaid costs.
Throughout the meetings, the president
has proposed limiting state allotments of
federal Medicaid funds over the next
decade. Several of the governors, includ
ing Jeb Bush (R-Fla.), and Bill Richard
son (D-N.M.), have resisted the presi
dent's plan, fearing such restrictions on
funds would deny states the ability to re
spond to local and regional exigencies.
We believe that any restrictions on
state Medicaid allotments leave precari
ously little slack for treating the basic
needs of the most vulnerable popula

tions. Strict budget caps place states at
great risk of being unable to meet costs
related to national and regional disas
ters, fluctuations instate budgets due to
economic cycles, outbreaks of diseases
and the use of innovative yet expensive
medications or treatments.
Medicaid is the nation's largest public
health intervention. It is the first and
often last line of defense against many
diseases and frequently the only stable
part of millions of peoples' economic
and physical welfare. Under restricted
Medicaid funding, states such as Cali
fornia, New York and Michigan might
be rendered helpless to manage a possi
ble outbreak of SARS. In addition to in
creased human suffering, compromises
to states' Medicaid systems put the na
tion at risk in combating diseases that
can now be transmitted rapidly across
continents
Instead of President Bush's central
ized plan, we advocate that both federal
and state governments implement a
bottom-up approach. Many state Medi
caid systems are appallingly inefficient,
to the point of determining eligibility
for thousands of people on a monthly
basis. Duplicated services are common
place and need to be eliminated. Medi
caid fraud ought to be investigated and
prosecuted as aggressively as Medicare
fraud.
State and federal government ought
also join forces in reducing certain Med
icaid costs such as prescription drugs,
which contribute disproportionally to
increasing Medicaid costs. State and
federal government officials need to
manage prescription drug costs more
effectively for Medicaid service
providers, ensuring that inflated drug
prices do not bankrupt state Medicaid
budgets.
At Stanford, there are many whose
lives are concerned intimately with the
health care needs of the Medicaid popu
lation. Medical students and volunteers
spend untold hours serving at any num
ber of Bay Area clinics.
By serving the most vulnerable indi
viduals' health care needs, Stanford stu
dents and faculty have strengthened
some of the most critical bonds of society.
We applaud Stanford students for their
serving communities through health
care and call upon Bush to support full
funding of state Medicaid programs ac
cording to this spirit.
