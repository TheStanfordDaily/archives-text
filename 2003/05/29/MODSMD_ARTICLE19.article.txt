Haas Center Director
appointment has included student input
I need to correct one misstatement in the otherwise
lovely editorial "Nadinne Cruz's legacy" (May 28).
The editorial states that students have been excluded
from the process of selecting the next I laas Center Di
rector. This is simply not the case. We have been
working closely with the ASSU Nominations Com
mittee to find students for the search committee. In
deed, the front-page article reporting on Nomina
tion's Committee's announcement of these positions
at the ASSU Senate meeting, "ASSU honors Fraga"
(May 28) says as much. The voice of students is vital.

Student voice essential to appointment of
next Haas Center director
I lament Stanford's loss as Nadinne Cruz was the
most qualified out there to head up the nation's
model for University Service Learning Centers; I'm
talking about the Haas Center, of course.
Having been an active member of the Haas Cen
ter since I came to Stanford, I've had the wonderful
opportunity of reaping from the student develop

merit programs at the center that really builds student
civic attitudes and potential.
Nadinne has so much vision and expertise in the
field that it will be extremely difficult to replace her.
1 agree that the administration needs to be more
transparent about why she is leaving the University. It
just doesn't make sense that Cruz would willingly step
down after all of the work that she has started, her suc
cesses and the fact that she is so well regarded in the
field of service learning. I am still puzzled about this
course of events and perhaps we may never know the
politics behind this decision. The most important
thing, however, is that we can continue on and make
sure that Cruz's successor is as much of a champion of
student voice and potential as she was.
