# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Full circle 
### 
We've come full circle at
last. Today's Daily
brings with it my final
words as a columnist
here at Stanford. The good part is
that I'll finally have time to study
for finals and maybe get a chance
to watch "Matrix Reloaded." The
downside is that I'll be leaving all
of you behind. In just a few days,
the newspaper you're holding will
be recycled into the whirlwind of
life, leaving these words floating
behind in your head or perhaps
replaced by more timely informa
tion.
Did I enjoy being a columnist?
Hell yeah I did.
Would I write the "Voluntary
segregation" (April 17) column
again? Yes, without the references
to Turkey or George Wallace.
Would I do it all again? In a
flash.
Would I use uninspired phras
es like "In a flash" in every column
without taking the time to think of
more clever wording? You betcha!
I know what you're probably
thinking: This guy is going to use
the last column just to talk about
himself and his wonderful Daily
editors? Of course not.
Let's get down to business.
I used my first column, "From
yellow to orange" (Feb. 11), to crit
icize the unnecessary and down
right threatening governmental
system of security alert status.
Since February, we've debated in
vading Iraq, invaded it, conquered
it and have begun the rebuilding
process. While our government's
warning level fell to yellow status
for quite awhile, the recent global
tensions have led to the current
warning level: back to orange.
Since February, the only real in
sight I've gained from closely fol
lowing and critiquing issues (both
on and off campus) is that life's
going to throw what it wants at
you. You wake up on a Thursday
and expect to go to class; who
knows what sort of negative exter
nalities life may throw at you? On
campus, it might be as small as bike
traffic on the Quad or protesters in
White Plaza that block your way
back to lunch. Outside of this
sleepy old Farm, people are deal
ing with issues as large as chemical
warfare and the AIDS epidemic.
My last column was a desperate

cry for all of you really good-heart
ed folks out there to wake up, real
ize the power you possess as Stan
ford students and do something
more with your lives than drink
beer and go to F licks. I wanted to
examine the nature of our own
physical actions.
This week, I want to discuss
how this change looks on the in
side. What does it take to live hap-

pily and produc
tively in our con
stantly changing
world? How can
we wake up each
day knowing
change is in
evitable, yet try to
chart out the
course of our

lives? How can we go to law, medi
cal or business school when we
know the world will look different
once we're out?
The answers I've found —
though they are constantly chang
ing — can be summarized roughly
by the Eastern philosophical con
cept of dukkha, which translates
roughly to the feeling of 'imper
manence, suffering or living an
unsatisfactory life.' According to
many Buddhists, people get this
feeling because they try to grasp,
package and plot out the minute
details of their lives as if they were
living inside a machine.
Tell me, when was the last time
your plane actually arrived at 9:32
a.m.?
In terms of my life, this philoso
phy seems to hold true. Most of my
darkest and most painful memo
ries involve trying to cling to the
past. It's that ex-girlfriend who I
can't seem to get over; if I could
just make her mine, my life would
be perfect. It's that grad school; if I
could just get in, everything would
work out, I know it. Hold on a
minute, didn't we say the same
about Stanford? My life is great,
but it isn't by any means as fantas
tic as I dreamed it would be back
when I was in high school.
Let go already.
Stop thinking about yourself as
someone defined by previous
achievements, trophies and
grades. Stop worrying about the
ex-girlfriend and start dating
someone new. And if you don't get
into MIT for graduate school...

hey, you'll probably be less of a
nerd anyway. My point is that some
things will work out, others won't;
trying to shape, craft, and whittle
life into a perfectly formed sculp
ture will inevitably lead to suffer
ing.
Last Friday, I drove to San
Mateo to have breakfast with Elias
Nabul. He: a Palestinian. I: a con
fused American / Israeli. The goal
of the chat: to listen to one anoth
er's suffering and see if some good
could come out of the whole mess.
Though Elias was no Buddhist
(he was actually a Palestinian
Christian), I had never met with
anyone who felt so much dukkha.
Elias was in his late sixties. He re
called losing his home and life as
he knew it after moving from
Jerusalem at the end of the 1948
war. He pulled the key and the title
of old house from a musty drawer.
He showed me pictures of his old
room and car. It was 50 years later
and this guy was crying in his own
living room about concrete and
brick.
But change came swiftly.
"Back home things are differ
ent," he told me. "You and I stand
on equal ground here in America.
I am not threatened by you since I
own this house and have started a
new life. I just want you to know
what I went through and why my
people are angry."
Elias was looking me in the eyes
and asking for peace. Even though
he understood the concept of im
mense attachment and the suffer
ing it causes, time seemed to have
taught him the utter feebleness of
clinging to memory. He had
grasped impermanence.
Time had taught Elias a lot
about life and forgiveness.
As young college students living
in a fast-paced world, however, life
often seems too loud, busy or im
portant to listen to the wisdom ex
periences provide through difficult
lessons.
From one college kid to anoth
er, I'd like to tell you that here at
Stanford we're damn smart, but
we're never too smart to listen to
people like Elias.

This is the last weekly column I'll ever
write in The Daily. Will you still be my
