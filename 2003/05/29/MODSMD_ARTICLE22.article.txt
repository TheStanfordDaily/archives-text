# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Policy on Student Initiated Courses needs University support 
### MOLLY CLINEHENS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Last Friday, the Committee on
Undergraduate Standards and
Policy, a subcommittee of the Fac
ulty Senate, passed a new policy on
Student Initiated Courses, SICs. It
is important that the student body
be aware of this new policy and the
effect it could have on these types
of student-led courses.
SICs form a program started
two years ago by students invested
in adding student voice to aca
demics at Stanford. Today, SICs
are sponsored by ASSU special
fees. The SIC program facilitates
students' development and offers
small, seminar style courses in sub
ject areas that are not covered by
the standard curriculum. Students
develop these courses working
closely with a faculty sponsor, and
courses are typically set up as di
rected readings with the faculty
member, although they are some

times listed with numbers under
departments.
As coordinators of the SIC pro
gram, sophomore Karan Mahajan
and I have communicated with the
committee throughout this year
and have responded to concerns
about the program's academic
rigor and organization. We have
taken important steps to guaran
tee that student leaders who offer
courses through the program are
well-prepared for the responsibili
ty, and we have established an ad
visory committee composed of fac
ulty, students and staff to oversee
the program. Because the pro
gram is young, there are still many
improvements to be made, includ
ing increasing outreach to gradu
ate students. Student leaders, stu
dents taking SIC courses and fac
ulty who have been involved with
the program overwhelmingly re
port a positive experience with the
program.
However, the committee's new

policy on SICs could have a de
structive effect on the program if
the committee does not guarantee
the institutional support to enact
the program. A finalized version of
the policy and meeting minutes
are still pending, but the main
terms of it have been confirmed:
First of all, the committee finds
SICs incompatible with the defini
tion of a directed reading course.
All SIC courses should be officially
listed by departments and go
through the same process of re
view as regular courses. To facili
tate these requirements, depart
ments are strongly recommended
to expedite the process of approv
ing SIC courses, which are set up
and offered in a two-quarter time
frame.
The new policy applies both to
SICs with ASSU backing and fund
ing (i.e. the official SIC program),
and other student-led courses that
do not go through the SIC pro
gram. The policy applies also to

Residential Education courses, but
strangely not to Alternative Spring
Break courses — both of which are
offered as directed readings.
The members of the committee
believe that shifting SIC courses
from directed readings to depart
ment-listed courses will help insti
tutionalize the SIC program and
legitimize the courses. As coordi
nators of the program, we agree
that listing SICs with department
numbers is a positive step, but we
are wary of imposing this policy
now. Student leaders of SICs are
currently encouraged to work with
their faculty sponsor to get their
courses listed with department
numbers. If such a feat is not possi
ble the suggestion is to work with
her or him to set up a directed
reading course. Most SICs are cur
rently offered as directed readings,
either because departments have
review processes that are too long
to accommodate the two-quarter
timeframe of SICs or because some

departments have a blanket policy
against listing SICs. This is the cur
rent reality of the situation, which
is why the SKI program still needs
the option of being listed or con
sidered a directed reading course
to set up these classes.
In response to this situation,
(he committee's policy stipulates
a one-year phase out of SICs of
fered as directed readings which
would also give departments
time to establish expedited pro
cedures to review SICs. Howev
er, the burden of getting depart
ments to go along with the new
policy rests on our shoulders —
the shoulders of coordinators
and other people involved in the
SIC program. While we do wish
to cultivate relationships with de
partments, we do not think we, as
students, are the best party to
convince the committee to adopt
a special protocol to review SICs.
Rather the Committee on Un
dergraduate Standards and Poli
cy itself should guarantee that
these procedures are enacted.
Indeed, given our experience
with departments reluctant to
sponsor SICs, this may prove to
be a difficult and time-consum
ing process. We feel that our time
is much better spent working
with student leaders to ensure
they are prepared to offer quali
ty courses, outreaching to under
graduate and graduate student
groups and improving the orga

nization of the program, rather
than working with each depart
ment to develop individual pro
tocols for reviewing SICs.
Finally, we are distressed about
the speed with which this policy
has been drafted. We are also wary
about how what started as a some
what democratic process shifted to
a process in which few stakehold
ers' voices were heard. As coordi
nators of SICs and thus represen
tatives of other students in the SIC
program, we were invited to sit on
a subcommittee to review SICs and
we gave our input about the policy
at this level. However, we were not
contacted or consulted in the final
stages of its development, when
the policy went through the most
drastic changes.
In conclusion, although the
committee's new policy on SICs
could potentially benefit the pro
gram, it also has the potential to
hurt the program if there is no
support from the committee's
end. As paying students of the
University, who have voted to
fund SICs through an ASSU spe
cial fee and as faculty invested in
encouraging student initiative
and self-directed learning, we
should all be concerned about a
hastily-drafted policy with no fol
low-through.
