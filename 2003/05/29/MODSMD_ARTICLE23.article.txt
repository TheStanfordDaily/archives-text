## Cardinal's Swope is real deal 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Senior Tobin Swope, the Cardinal baseball
team's shortstop, is an easy guy to root for.
A tireless worker with an obvious love for
the game, Swope helped the team any way he
could off the bench for three years before
breaking into the starting lineup this season.
"I'm ecstatic about his accomplishments
this year," said junior pitcher John Hudgins.
Everyone who has followed Swope's Stan
ford career echoes that sentiment â€” and for
good reason. Swope's success has been well
earned.
As an All-State safety at his high school in
Texas, where football sits high atop the high
school sports hierarchy, Swope was unsure
what he wanted to pursue in college.
"Fora long time I didn't know whether I'd
play baseball," Swope said. "I thought maybe
I'd try to play football. High school football in
Texas is amazing and I loved it. People you
don't even know wave to you on the street and
wish you luck. But sometime in the middle of
my junior year during baseball season, I real
ized that baseball was what I really wanted to
do. I have a passion for the game."
Swope was sold on Stanford with his first
campus visit and committed early to playing
ball for the Cardinal, but he knew it would be
a struggle to earn a spot in the starting rota
tion of one of the nation's top teams.
Swope had no starts in his freshman and
sophomore seasons and only six as a junior.
His blazing speed on the basepaths made him
a valuable pinch runner and he consistendy
produced base hits (Swope carried a .370 av
erage into his senior season), but despite these
talents, Stanford's infield was simply too
strong for Swope to see many innings.
Scott Dragicevich, Chris O'Riordan and
Andy Topham - all of whom graduated last
year - had some of the best gloves in college
baseball and formed a nearly impenetrable
defense.
Despite playing behind them for three
years while waiting his turn, Swope continued
to work on his game and never regretted his

decision to play baseball at Stanford.
"At times when it was a little frustrating not
getting a chance to play," Swope said. "But
getting to know teammates at Stanford, I had
no regrets at all. Even the guys playing ahead
of me were my best friends. They were doing
well and the team was doing well so it was
hard to have any complaints."
Swope never relented in working hard to

improve himself and learn from his team
mates, and the same players who started
ahead of him helped Swope become the play
er he is today.
"O'Riordan, Topham and Dragicevich
were the hardest working guys I'd ever seen,
not only with baseball but also academics,"
