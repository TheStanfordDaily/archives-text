## Cardinal's Swope is real deal 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Senior Tobin Swope, the Cardinal baseball
team's shortstop, is an easy guy to root for.
A tireless worker with an obvious love for
the game, Swope helped the team any way he
could off the bench for three years before
breaking into the starting lineup this season.
"I'm ecstatic about his accomplishments
this year," said junior pitcher John Hudgins.
Everyone who has followed Swope's Stan
ford career echoes that sentiment — and for
good reason. Swope's success has been well
earned.
As an All-State safety at his high school in
Texas, where football sits high atop the high
school sports hierarchy, Swope was unsure
what he wanted to pursue in college.
"Fora long time I didn't know whether I'd
play baseball," Swope said. "I thought maybe
I'd try to play football. High school football in
Texas is amazing and I loved it. People you
don't even know wave to you on the street and
wish you luck. But sometime in the middle of
my junior year during baseball season, I real
ized that baseball was what I really wanted to
do. I have a passion for the game."
Swope was sold on Stanford with his first
campus visit and committed early to playing
ball for the Cardinal, but he knew it would be
a struggle to earn a spot in the starting rota
tion of one of the nation's top teams.
Swope had no starts in his freshman and
sophomore seasons and only six as a junior.
His blazing speed on the basepaths made him
a valuable pinch runner and he consistendy
produced base hits (Swope carried a .370 av
erage into his senior season), but despite these
talents, Stanford's infield was simply too
strong for Swope to see many innings.
Scott Dragicevich, Chris O'Riordan and
Andy Topham - all of whom graduated last
year - had some of the best gloves in college
baseball and formed a nearly impenetrable
defense.
Despite playing behind them for three
years while waiting his turn, Swope continued
to work on his game and never regretted his

decision to play baseball at Stanford.
"At times when it was a little frustrating not
getting a chance to play," Swope said. "But
getting to know teammates at Stanford, I had
no regrets at all. Even the guys playing ahead
of me were my best friends. They were doing
well and the team was doing well so it was
hard to have any complaints."
Swope never relented in working hard to

improve himself and learn from his team
mates, and the same players who started
ahead of him helped Swope become the play
er he is today.
"O'Riordan, Topham and Dragicevich
were the hardest working guys I'd ever seen,
not only with baseball but also academics,"

After netting only six starts in his first three years on the Farm, Tobin Swope has excelled as the Cardi
nal's everyday shortstop. In his senior season he is batting .286 and has a .947 fielding percentage.
Swope said.
"They inspired me to work hard
even though I wasn't getting a
chance to play. A lot of what I've
been able to do has been inspired
by them."
As any current Cardinal
ballplayer will attest, Swope has
consistently displayed the same
work ethic that he admired in his
predecessors.
" I he most amazing thing to me
about Tobin throughout the years
that I've known him is that he is
uniquely able to bring the same ap

proach to the game, no matter
what is happening," Hudgins said.
With only six starts to his credit,
a question coming into this season
was whether Swope had the expe
rience necessary to handle being a
starting shortstop — the position
that fields the most balls off the bat
of any position.
Swope has answered that ques
tion with a .947 fielding percent
age. He earned the starting short
stop position at the season's outset
and has kept the job with consis
tently solid play.
Swope's patience and work have
been rewarded with an outstand
ing season in which he has dis
played a veteran's consistency with
his glove and bat that belie the fact

that this is his first year as a regular
starter.
His play has earned him honor
able mention honors on the Pac
10's all-conference team.
In addition to competing with
elite talent fora starting spot,
Swope has been the victim of bad
luck. After going five-for-five in a
game against Arizona last year, a
showing that certainly would have
boosted his playing time, Swope
broke his finger and would not
start for the rest of the year.
Persistent work and a positive
outlook enabled Swope to keep his
confidence and prepared him for
the responsibility he bears this sea
son.
"When you're not getting a

chance to play, it's difficult to play
well when that chance comes,"
Swope said. "I just tried to continue
to work hard, because you never
know when your chance will come.
You have to be physically and men
tally ready to play. I gained a lot of
confidence playing in the summer
leagues before this year, and 1
came into this spring with a lot of
confidence. I felt 1 could do well for
Stanford."
And he has.
"He's really the epitome of a
guy that just loves the game,"
Hudgins said of his teammate. "I
really respect how he has handled
himself over the last four years. He
deserves all the credit in the
world."

Swope has answered that ques
tion with a .947 fielding percent
age. He earned the starting short
stop position at the season's outset
and has kept the job with consis
tently solid play.
Swope's patience and work have
been rewarded with an outstand
ing season in which he has dis
played a veteran's consistency with
his glove and bat that belie the fact

that this is his first year as a regular
starter.
His play has earned him honor
able mention honors on the Pac
10's all-conference team.
In addition to competing with
elite talent fora starting spot,
Swope has been the victim of bad
luck. After going five-for-five in a
game against Arizona last year, a
showing that certainly would have
boosted his playing time, Swope
broke his finger and would not
start for the rest of the year.
Persistent work and a positive
outlook enabled Swope to keep his
confidence and prepared him for
the responsibility he bears this sea
son.
"When you're not getting a

chance to play, it's difficult to play
well when that chance comes,"
Swope said. "I just tried to continue
to work hard, because you never
know when your chance will come.
You have to be physically and men
tally ready to play. I gained a lot of
confidence playing in the summer
leagues before this year, and 1
came into this spring with a lot of
confidence. I felt 1 could do well for
Stanford."
And he has.
"He's really the epitome of a
guy that just loves the game,"
Hudgins said of his teammate. "I
really respect how he has handled
himself over the last four years. He
deserves all the credit in the
world."
Senior Tobin Swope, the Cardinal baseball
team's shortstop, is an easy guy to root for.
A tireless worker with an obvious love for
the game, Swope helped the team any way he
could off the bench for three years before
breaking into the starting lineup this season.
"I'm ecstatic about his accomplishments
this year," said junior pitcher John Hudgins.
Everyone who has followed Swope's Stan
ford career echoes that sentiment — and for
good reason. Swope's success has been well
earned.
As an All-State safety at his high school in
Texas, where football sits high atop the high
school sports hierarchy, Swope was unsure
what he wanted to pursue in college.
"Fora long time I didn't know whether I'd
play baseball," Swope said. "I thought maybe
I'd try to play football. High school football in
Texas is amazing and I loved it. People you
don't even know wave to you on the street and
wish you luck. But sometime in the middle of
my junior year during baseball season, I real
ized that baseball was what I really wanted to
do. I have a passion for the game."
Swope was sold on Stanford with his first
campus visit and committed early to playing
ball for the Cardinal, but he knew it would be
a struggle to earn a spot in the starting rota
tion of one of the nation's top teams.
Swope had no starts in his freshman and
sophomore seasons and only six as a junior.
His blazing speed on the basepaths made him
a valuable pinch runner and he consistendy
produced base hits (Swope carried a .370 av
erage into his senior season), but despite these
talents, Stanford's infield was simply too
strong for Swope to see many innings.
Scott Dragicevich, Chris O'Riordan and
Andy Topham - all of whom graduated last
year - had some of the best gloves in college
baseball and formed a nearly impenetrable
defense.
Despite playing behind them for three
years while waiting his turn, Swope continued
to work on his game and never regretted his

decision to play baseball at Stanford.
"At times when it was a little frustrating not
getting a chance to play," Swope said. "But
getting to know teammates at Stanford, I had
no regrets at all. Even the guys playing ahead
of me were my best friends. They were doing
well and the team was doing well so it was
hard to have any complaints."
Swope never relented in working hard to

improve himself and learn from his team
mates, and the same players who started
ahead of him helped Swope become the play
er he is today.
"O'Riordan, Topham and Dragicevich
were the hardest working guys I'd ever seen,
not only with baseball but also academics,"

After netting only six starts in his first three years on the Farm, Tobin Swope has excelled as the Cardi
nal's everyday shortstop. In his senior season he is batting .286 and has a .947 fielding percentage.
Swope said.
"They inspired me to work hard
even though I wasn't getting a
chance to play. A lot of what I've
been able to do has been inspired
by them."
As any current Cardinal
ballplayer will attest, Swope has
consistently displayed the same
work ethic that he admired in his
predecessors.
" I he most amazing thing to me
about Tobin throughout the years
that I've known him is that he is
uniquely able to bring the same ap

proach to the game, no matter
what is happening," Hudgins said.
With only six starts to his credit,
a question coming into this season
was whether Swope had the expe
rience necessary to handle being a
starting shortstop — the position
that fields the most balls off the bat
of any position.
Swope has answered that ques
tion with a .947 fielding percent
age. He earned the starting short
stop position at the season's outset
and has kept the job with consis
tently solid play.
