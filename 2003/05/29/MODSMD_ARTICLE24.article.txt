# Denver's need for Carmelo Anthony
## The 						Golden Nugget 
### 
So the NBA draft lottery —
or the Leßron James
Sweepstakes — was a
week ago.
You know those Publisher's
Clearinghouse ads with the Prize
Patrol? I had hopes that was how
die lottery would pan out for the
Nuggets, as an NBA official
would drive up to the Pepsi Cen
ter in a big black van and emerge
with a gigantic check.
Sadly, that didn't happen.
The Cavs won the lottery and

will end up with
the hometown
phenom. My
Nuggets, on the
other hand, fell
to the third pick
and are ru
mored to be
looking to trade
even farther
down.

Leßron, you see, was a chance
for the Nuggets to finally be
mediocre. I'm not going to get
overly optimistic and say that he
would have made them good —
but he would have made them
better. When you tie for the worst
record in the league, you have to
look at things in perspective.
At best Leßron would have
made an impact in the games he
played and helped lure a free
agent or two to Denver, starting a
rebuilding process for what
seems like the eighth time in
eight years. At worst he would
have been exciting and would
have created a buzz about basket
ball, something Denver hasn't
had since Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
refused to stand for the national
anthem a few years ago.
Of course, Denver losing in
the draft lottery was no surprise.

Fora team that has had a surpris
ing number of opportunities in
the lottery (nine), the Nuggets
have only moved up in the draft
order... oh wait — they never
have. They've fallen a record
seven times, including three
times when they had the worst
record in the league the previous
year.
(This would be one of those
times, for those of you scoring at
home).
The Nuggets, it should be
noted, did win one lottery this
year — the ABC dress rehearsal,
a complete run through done be
fore the real lottery. Unfortu
nately, it seems that just about
used up the luck they had.
This is not to say the Nuggets
haven't drafted well — LaPhonso
Ellis in 1992, Jalen Rose was a
good pick up in 1994, Nene Hi
lario last year . . . OK, that's
about it.
But this year gives them an
other chance at redemption —
the headband-wearing savior
from Syracuse. That's right, it's
'Melo Time in Denver.
According to all the draft pun
dits, after Leßron gets taken by
Cleveland, the Pistons will select
Darko Milicic from Serbia. That
leaves this year's NCAA Tourna
ment's MOP available.
Now, hope springs eternal,
but maybe Carmelo is just what
the Nuggets need. A fast, exciting
player who can run the court,
give a sweet inside-outside com
bination with Nene . . . and did I
mention the headband? If he can
entice Arenas to leave Oakland or
convince some of the Clippers
(Miller, Maggette, Olowokandi)


Matt Babin
to come give Denver a shot,
everything just might work out.
A lot of questions remain, like
they always do with the Nuggets.
Would Carmelo be ready to play
right away? Could he cope with
losing more games than he's
used to, for awhile? Could he re
ally help bring free agents to a
perennially crappy team? Will
the retirement of Patrick Roy
take him off of his game?
(OK, so that last one is kind of
unrelated. We'll get to that next
week, I guess.)

I suppose the big question,
then, is just what color headband
he'll wear. Can you stick with the
college orange (and pawn it off as
a tribute to the Broncos, across
the street) or do you adopt the
home team's new colors?
Time alone will tell. Luckily
Denver fans won't have that long
to wait — you can bet 'Melo will
be rocking the new headgear at
the Draft in less than a month.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in
economics and Italian who, as much
as he likes Carmelo and his head
bands, thinks the Nuggets will proba
bly be really, really bad again this sea
son. E-mail him at babin@stan-
