# Mainstream soccer acceptance necessary
## 
### 
Yesterday, Juventus and
AC Milan played the first
all-Italy final in Champi
ons League history.
Milan, somehow having managed
to defeat seemingly unstoppable
Real Madrid, fought its way to its
sixth European Cup, beating de
fensive-minded Juventus 3-2 on
penalty kicks after a 0-0 tie.
A decent storyline, although the
most interesting note might be the
absence of the seemingly unstop
pable Real Madrid, far and away
the most talented team in Europe.
Milan knocked them out with a 1-0
semifinal victory.
The real question here, though,
isn't why Madrid choked or how

frustrating PKs
can be. It is, why
doesn't anyone
care?
I'm not going
to sit here and tell
you that we
should all be rabid
soccer fans. Amer
ica has the best

sports in the world, all things con
sidered, and we'd be foolish not to
pay attention to our own leagues.
But I do think it's worth noting
that the entire world plays soccer,
and there is almost always some
thing interesting and important
going on somewhere, be it the
Champions League and UEFA
Cup, the CONCACAF Cup, the
FIFA Confederations Cup, the
AFC Champions League and a host
of other international tourna
ments. On top of all this, you have
national leagues like the Premier
ship and the Bundesliga. Even this
soccer-antipathic nation has the
Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup,
Major League Soccer, WUSA and
the national teams.
All these leagues and cups go on
at the same time, too. You don't
have one league or tournament at a
time; it's all going on, more or less
all the time, either in qualifying or
tournament play, all over the
world.
And, really, that's the coolest

thing about soccer — its interna
tionalism.
Teams from countries many
and varied play each other all the
time, tapping into that greatest la
tent source of sports fanaticism —
nationalism.
As was well demonstrated last
spring and summer with the ad
vent of the World Cup and is always
shown by the Olympics, people
love rooting for their country even
if they aren't that keen on the sport
in question.
Indeed, internationals on soccer
message boards were generally
pretty incensed at the sudden in
flux of Americans showing an in
terest in "their" sport. They also
weren't too happy at how well the
team representing a nation of soc
cer philistines played so well.
Whether or not the U.S. Nation
al team can ever play at the level of
the elites like Germany and Brazil
remains to be seen; but world soc
cer offers one an opportunity, at
any time, to watch games that are
eminently meaningful. Watching
the Mavericks win a meaningless
game en route to a series defeat,
watching Ottawa-Jersey or watch
ing the last two teams standing
from all of Europe in the Champi
ons League final? In all honesty, I'd
choose the latter if I had hundreds
of dollars to blow on satellites and
subscription packages.
I'm not saying a Kings-Lakers
series wouldn't take precedence
over world soccer on my televi
sion. But I still think it's a shame
that sports fans in this country
completely miss out on spectacu
lar sporting events that captivate
billions of people the world over.
America has the best sports, sure,
but are they so much better that
the Champions League final
shouldn't even be a blip on our
radar?
