# Former U.N. Commissioner addresses peace and conflict issues
## Ogata discusses refugees 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Former U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees Sadako Ogata discussed
how refugees are critical to the transi
tion between war and peace during the
Payne lecture series Tuesday and yes

terday afternoons.
Ogata served as commissioner through
10 turbulent years, from her initial chal
lenge dealing with Kurdish refugees in Iraq
after the Gulf War to coping with massive
refugee crises in the Balkans.
She said that the main focus of her office
was to dispense refugee aid and not to deal
with political issues, but she noted that it was
impossible to separate political and human
itarian crises.
In her lecture yesterday afternoon,
Ogata presented the outline of a report by
the Commission on Human Security, which
she chaired. It explained six broad steps to
easing conflicts around the world by em
powering individuals and making them feel
secure.
Ogata characterized her long career with
the UNHCR as a mixture of ambivalence
and analysis.
"This is the kind of office that shouldn't
last," she said, but added that she still sees
the job as the important because "refugees
bridge between war and peace."
Ogata also dealt with this year's war in
Iraq. From her perspective dealing with Kur
dish refugees in 1991, she stressed a need for
an international force to remain in order to

protect parts of the country.
"[There was] a lesson that had
to be learned and relearned —
safe havens need adequate pro
tection," she said.
Ogata related her experience
with moderate success in Kurdish
Iraq and the failure of interna
tional peacekeeping in Srebreni
ca, a city in the former Yu
goslavia.
Nothing compared with the
tragedy of the refugee crisis that
followed the Rwandan genocide
in 1994, she said. In her speech
and in questions that followed,
Ogata addressed the obvious fail
ure of the whole refugee system in
Rwanda.
In refugee camps in the Congo,

actual Rwandan refugees were
mixed with armed combatants,
and the camps became dangerous
and violent. UNHCR hired
guards to separate out civilians
from combatants, but that only
worked fora month before troops
from Rwanda forcibly broke up
the refugee camps and con
tributed to unrest in the Congo.
"I feel bad about the Congo,
that we were not able to do bet
ter," she said.
In response to a question
about other measures that might
have been taken, Ogata support
ed the U.N. actions.
"Withholding food [from
refugees] would have cost more in
security than it would have
gained. ... I still think that sepa
ration was the best."
Ogata related the failure in
Rwanda to a lack of strategic in
terest by parties that would have

been able to intervene.
"At the end .. . strategic inter
est counts," she said. "If there is
not a strategic interest in the area,
there was only so much I could
do."
Still, Ogata presented few
problems with funding for the
UNHCR. In crises, money seems
to come, she said.
Ogata addressed future initia
tives that she was in favor of, such
as a standing international police
force and broader initiatives to
improve human security.
"If you really want to improve
human security, you need to em
power people," she said.
Her commission's report
championed "access to education,
health and wealth."
"I would like to see [the
human security report] have an
impact on militaries, the devel
opment of societies and aid poli

cies," she said.
Overseeing such a large orga
nization in the UNHCR and such
a vast problem, with more than six
million refugees throughout the
world, Ogata explained that her
job was often difficult, but she was
able to continue because of the
hope her organization created.
"In many situations we tried
and tried and tried," she said,
"and if we save lives, there are
possibilities for them."
She also concluded that there
were many successes, such as
those in Cambodia and Central
America.
"The success comes when
there is a combination of political
decisions, settlement of conflict
and proper procedures are car
ried out," she said. "But even
there, for security to be fully re
stored in a conflict state takes
time."
