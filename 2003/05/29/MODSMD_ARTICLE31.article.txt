The merry happy returns of
the day wished in today's "Happy
Birthday, Bug!" filler should have
run Tuesday, but the Classifieds
staff was busy entertaining 112 riends
and drinking Jagermeister and
Rockstar and forgot to do it. We
apologize for the error.
The Classifieds staff also
regrets the jokes filed by Jayson
Blair. We thought he was writing
humorous filler content from
inside the Daily. We learned that
he had not intended these pieces
to be funny at all.
When Blair wrote, "Why did
the chicken cross the road? fro get
to the other side.)," he did not
actually understand the comedy
behind it, but masked this with a
laugh track phoned in on his
cellular phone. After speaking to
the Priest, Rabbi, Shaman, and
Monk depicted in yesterday's
Help Wanted section joke, we
learned that there was no Shaman.
Blair had deceived us and violated
the comedic rule of threes.
We apologize for the error.
