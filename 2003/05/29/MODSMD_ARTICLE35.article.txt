# Online IT Services Billing: ITSS Joins 21st Century
## 
### 
It's finally sunk in to the administration in
Information Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) that Stanford students want to see their
monthly bills online. Starting May 28, check out
the Axess web site fora new link to the My IT
Services site. And even better, by the start of the
next school year, students will also be able to
order new services online (no more standing in
long lines to order your phone or cable TV!).
Since billing began decades ago, ITSS has
sent a paper bill each month to students. With
about 11,000 students subscribing to one or
more IT services—most commonly a campus
phone, cellular service, or cable TV—that's an
insane number of bills going out each month.
Plus, residential networking services (Internet
connection in a dorm room) are also billed via the
monthly ITSS bill. No wonder they finally caved
and put it all online!
Check Out the New Site
Log on to the Axess web site with your SUNet
ID and password. The menu 'For Students' has
an 'Administrative' section, and now you'll see a
new link to 'IT Services.' Click on the link and a
description of the new site appears, along with a
link to the new My IT Services Site.
More info is in your May paper bill; a full-page
insert describes how to get to the site and what
you'll see when you're there.
Online Billing Features
You'll get an email every month sent to your
SUNetlD@stanford.edu account that your bill is
online. No more waiting for your bill to come in
the mail, no more lost bills every summer when
you're gone, and no more delays signing up for
new services in the fall while you clear up your IT
services bill —you can pay during the summer if
you want. Online billing might be the only way in

the future; let's stop the senseless killing of trees for
unwanted paper bills and keep it all online, right?
When you connect to the site, you'll be able to:
• View your current balance —see a total of
your IT charges
• View or print your bill in your choice of
HTML, PDF, or Excel —easy to download and
save and then attach in an email to Mom and
Dad to pay up!
• Get a price estimate on a long distance call —
plunk in a number and how many minutes
you'll talk and get back an estimate by date
and time so you can pick the cheapest time to
call. Note: long distance rates based on usage
rates for your Personal Access Code (PAC),
not your calling card or cell phone rates.
What's History
The only thing being lost is extra paper, and odds
are you have enough paper from your course work
to last for years to come. So really, the only thing
lost is well, nothing. This online billing thing is all
good.
Oh Yeah, to Make a Payment
Well, if you've made a payment lately, you know
you can either mail in a check with your payment
coupon or take the coupon with you to the Old
Union. That's the same. ITSS got with Student
Financial Services to ensure that payments for
IT services can continue without interruption (a
collective "Duh" goes here).
An online payment coupon will be added to the
site in June so you can print that out instead of
fishing for your paper bill. When payments for IT
services are made, the Current Balance on the My
IT Services Site is automatically updated. Be sure
to check your @stanford.edu email account during
the summer. Officials in Student Financial Services

are discussing how to offer online bill paying at a
future date, which would be the icing on the online
cake.
What's Coming this Summer
Beginning August 26 and after you have a room
assignment, you can use the My IT Services site
to place orders for new services. You'll log on,
enter the room information, and place an order
for your new phone, cellular service, or cable TV.
Other ITSS services, such as software, are also
being considered for inclusion on the site. It may
not be as good as Amazon, but hey, ya gotta start
somewhere.
To Get Help
Not that the nation's top minds will need any
help...but if you do, remember that you can
always submit a HelpSU request online at
https://helpsu.stanford.edu. If you want to reach
a person, call 5-HELP (725-4357). HelpSU and
5-HELP are for questions or help with the My
IT Services site or with your IT Services bill. A
new HelpSU problem category of ITSS Billing
has been added so that billing requests are routed
correctly.
So go log on and check it out!
