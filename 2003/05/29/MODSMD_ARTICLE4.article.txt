# Univ. asks for SARS caution
## 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
The University expects 25,000 people
from all over the world to attend Stanford's
112 th Commencement on June 15 and has
warned attendees to take precautions to
avoid the spread of SARS.
In light of the recent outbreaks of SARS,
or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in
various international communities, includ
ing China, Vietnam and Toronto, Stanford is
promoting an unofficial policy discouraging
visitors from SARS-affected regions from at
tending Commencement Weekend.
"We are asking that family members and
other guests from SARS-affected areas follow
the recommendations of the World Health

Organization, the [Centers for Disease Con
trol and Prevention] and their local health
authorities," said Ira Friedman, director of
the Vaden Health Center. "Specifically, if
they have symptoms consistent with SARS or
in the past 10 days have had close personal
contact with a suspected case of SARS, they
should not make the trip."
The CDC published interim guidelines on
May 14 for institutions or organizations host
ing people arriving in the United States from
areas with SARS. The CDC does not recom
mend canceling or postponing gatherings or
quarantining people visiting from SARS-af
fected areas at this time.
However, the CDC does offer a compre-
hensive list of preventative mea
sures institutions can take to mini
mize an outbreak of the contagious
disease, and Stanford intends to
follow these closely.
For example, those who are at
risk to contract SARS are asked to
take the following precautions
during their stay on the Farm.
"They should monitor their
own health for 10 days, including
taking their temperature twice a
day," Friedman said of potential
ly-infected visitors. "At the first
sign of symptoms consistent with
SARS —fever, cough, trouble
breathing — they should isolate
themselves and notify us at Vaden
Health Center."
Since Stanford will not be able
to track the travel of its numerous

Commencement visitors, officials
said the responsibility to follow
these guidelines lies with each in
dividual.
The CDC supports a cautious
but tolerant policy and clarifies
that large gatherings such as Com
mencement have not yet been a
site of the disease's spread in the
United States.
"Casual contact with SARS pa
tients at schools, other institutions
or public gatherings has not result
ed in documented transmission in
the United States," the CDC
guidelines explain. "[However],
thousands of people arrive in the
United States from areas where
SARS outbreaks are occurring to
participate in gatherings. Guid
ance is needed to provide a consis
tent, rational approach to SARS
prevention without unnecessarily
stigmatizing these groups."
Senior Rock Meng's parents fly
back and forth between California

and Taiwan, one of the affected
areas, typically spending about
half of the year in each location.
"My first reaction would be that
[the policy] is [screwed] up," he
said. "But then that it's reason
able. My dad is coming back from
Taiwan on June 1 and then stay
ing in a hotel for 10 days [since]
that's the quarantine period if
they suspect you have SARS, just
to make sure he doesn't infect us if
he has it.
"If my dad couldn't come," he
continued, "I wouldn't go to grad
uation, because honestly, I don't
care that much about graduation,
and for me to leave my dad behind
would be ridiculous."
Friedman assured students
that their families and friends
were welcome at Commencement
Weekend, but that steps needed
to be taken to protect the health of
members of the campus commu
nity and their families.
