Stanford has long boasted the reputation of one of
the world's leading research institutions, though some
students say they wonder whether undergraduates can
make meaningful contributions to the research of the
University's highly accomplished faculty members.
However, faculty and students who have gotten in
volved in faculty initiatives say their experiences have
been mutually beneficial.
Students' incentives to get involved in research vary
widely, but most appear to take a genuine interest in
their work.
"If it was just for the money, I could get a simpler, less
time-consuming job elsewhere," said one senior who
does research at the Stanford Medical Center. "Acade
mic credit is nice compensation, but working in a lab in
volves long hours, and you always have to be prepared
for failure. It's tough designing long, complex experi
ments around a busy class schedule."
However, many undergraduates feel that the ability
to maintain a more thorough, updated knowledge of
their discipline is well worth the drawbacks.
"Research is a way to get a more specialized under
standing of your area of interest, something that your
classes can't offer," said junior Mark Hsu, a biology
major. "I consult with my PI — principal investigator —
and design experiments to expand on what we know
from current research literature."
The benefits of collaborating with Stanford faculty
are not one-sided, either. Many faculty members have
credited undergraduates with making contributions
thai are important not only to their research, but to the
entire field.
"On several occasions, when students have contin
ued in the lab for several years, they have made discov-
