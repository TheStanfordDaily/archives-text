# Research rewards student interests

### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has long boasted the reputation of one of
the world's leading research institutions, though some
students say they wonder whether undergraduates can
make meaningful contributions to the research of the
University's highly accomplished faculty members.
However, faculty and students who have gotten in
volved in faculty initiatives say their experiences have
been mutually beneficial.
Students' incentives to get involved in research vary
widely, but most appear to take a genuine interest in
their work.
"If it was just for the money, I could get a simpler, less
time-consuming job elsewhere," said one senior who
does research at the Stanford Medical Center. "Acade
mic credit is nice compensation, but working in a lab in
volves long hours, and you always have to be prepared
for failure. It's tough designing long, complex experi
ments around a busy class schedule."
However, many undergraduates feel that the ability
to maintain a more thorough, updated knowledge of
their discipline is well worth the drawbacks.
"Research is a way to get a more specialized under
standing of your area of interest, something that your
classes can't offer," said junior Mark Hsu, a biology
major. "I consult with my PI — principal investigator —
and design experiments to expand on what we know
from current research literature."
The benefits of collaborating with Stanford faculty
are not one-sided, either. Many faculty members have
credited undergraduates with making contributions
thai are important not only to their research, but to the
entire field.
"On several occasions, when students have contin
ued in the lab for several years, they have made discov-
eries that were sufficiently novel
that we have incorporated their re
sults into scientific publications on
which the students are included as
authors," said Chris Somerville,
professor of biological sciences and
director of the Carnegie Institute
of Plant Research.
Extremely motivated under
graduates, who have taken the ini
tiative to further their own re
search, have achieved widespread
recognition for their work.
"The undergrads are amazing,"
said Neurology Prof. Robert Sapol

sky. "They wind up involved in
every aspect of the work, initiate
areas of research on their own,
wind up presenting their results at
international meetings and being
first authors on papers in profes
sional journals. Over my years
here, undergrads have been co-au
thors on 60 papers from my lab
and first authors on about 15 of
them."
Even in departments that may
not yield many undergraduate re
search opportunities, it is still possi
ble for students who are truly inter
ested in the field to make a differ
ence, said Philosophy Prof. Chris
Bobonich.
"Philosophy is not a field that
easily lends itself to substantive un

dergraduate contribution to facul
ty research, especially for under
graduates who are not seniors," he
acknowledged. "However, this
past summer I developed and
began work on a project that would
both give an undergraduate stu
dent a genuine role in philosophy
research and benefit the Philoso
phy Department and the Intro
duction to the Humanities pro
gram."
The project was the creation of
the "Introduction to Philosophy"
Web site, which not only expanded
the student's personal knowledge
but also provided a useful teaching
tool in Bobonich's I-Hum course
and other introductory philosophy
classes, he explained.
