# Temp workers protest wages
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over 100 workers and students
gathered in the Main Quad outside of
the office of University President John
Hennessy at noon yesterday to seek a
number of changes in employment
practices concerning temporary work
ers at Stanford.
The rally marked the release of a re
port done by SEIU Local 715 and

Working Partnership USA that found
a number of problems with how Stan
ford currently employs temporary
workers. It also was the beginning of a
hunger fast by six students, who are
calling upon the University to change
its labor standards in light of what they
say are serious problems facing work
ers on campus.
The report, based on a survey of 72
workers at Stanford and its associated
hospitals, issued a wide range of statis

tics and recommendations relating to
temporary workers. It found that 73
percent of Stanford workers made
below a living wage, compared to 8
percent who made below a living wage
in Santa Clara County.
A living wage is defined by Santa
Clara County as $10.10 per hour with
health benefits and $11.35 without
benefits. The University's living-wage

guidelines are based off of the
Santa Clara County standard and
applies to non-temporary, non
unionized, non-subcontracted
workers on campus not already
employed by the University.
The survey also found that 68
percent of workers did not have
any form of health insurance, and
21 percent reported using the
emergency room because they did
not have a regular doctor.
Fifteen percent of the workers
owned homes, the survey said; 46
percent were forced to "double
up" in houses with other families.
The survey found that 67 per
cent of workers had worked at
Stanford more than six months.
The report made a number of
recommendations to Stanford
concerning temporary workers,
including the end of use of tempo
rary workers for jobs that could be
permanent, increase in worker ac
cess to benefits, job security, equal
work for equal pay and the right to
"a voice at work," ensuring that
temp agencies adhere to Stan
lord's own labor standards and
making a policy protecting temp
workers from retaliation for speak
ing out.
Gordon Earle, vice provost for
public affairs, said that while the
University did not have the full re
port, Stanford has addressed the
issue of labor standards on cam
pus.
"The full report has not yet
been made available to the Univer
sity so it is impossible to comment
on its facts and conclusions," Earle

said. "In addition, the executive
summary of the report says that
the survey is not a representative
sample of Stanford workers. In
fact, our understanding is that it
includes, at most, only 18 workers
on Stanford's payroll. That being
said, Stanford believes its labor
policies, both toward regular and
temporary employees, are fair and
reasonable."
He said that the University's ex
isting labor policies showed the
University's commitment to the
issue and that while the report did
not represent Stanford workers,
the University would look closely
at it.
"Stanford believes its current
labor polices are fair and reason
able," he said. "For example, we
recently became one of the few in
stitutions of higher learning in the
country and the only private em
ployer in the area that adopted liv
ing-wage and benefit guidelines.
This and other labor policies un
derscore the University's deep
commitment to fair employment
practices.
"Nonetheless, we appreciate
being provided with the informa
tion in the report and intend to
take a close look at it,"he contin
ued. "We realize it is not a repre
sentative survey but will, nonethe
less, give it careful consideration."
Victoria Vega, a former house
keeper at the Stanford Hospital
who spoke at the rally, said that
Manpower, the temporary work
agency that employs her through a
contract with the University, told
her that she was laid off because
the University was upset that she
continued to ask for permanent
employment at her position.
"I have worked at Stanford for

eight years, and I am not in a per
manent position," she said. "I can't
get a permanent position because I
can't speak English fluently."
Earle said that he had no infor
mation concerning this case.
At the rally, other workers,
union representatives and a reli
gious leader also spoke.
"We're behind you, we've al
ways been behind you, and we'll
continue to be behind you," said
Monseigneur Eugene Boyle, a re

tired priest of the diocese of San
Jose and chair emeritus of the
Inter-Faith Council, which repre
sents a cross-section of religions.
Students, including those rep
resenting the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition and the Coalition for
Labor Justice, were with the work
ers at the rally.
"The core of the code of con
duct is essentially about temporary
labor, because that's where the
most flagrant labor abuses occur at

Stanford," said senior Meghana
Reddy, a member of the Stanford
Coalition for Labor Justice. "The
[University] president's living
wage policy explicitly excludes
both subcontracted temporary
workers and their own directly
hired temporary workers. These
are the workers who are living in
the worst conditions. They framed
the policy as a safety net, but it's
not."
Six students from the Coalition

for Labor Justice have begun a
hunger fast that they say is meant
to challenge the administration to
create a code of conduct that
would apply to all workers at Stan
ford.
"As a coalition, we thought that
a fast would be the appropriate
event for our code of conduct cam
paign," said junior Leticia
Ramirez, a co-coordinator of
SLAC. "We have demonstrated
our commitment and our belief in
the code of conduct over the past
few years. This action is another
expression of our commitment.
She added, "This is in response
to the University's consistently su
perficial commitment to resolving
serious labor issues on this campus
and their lack of commitment to
becoming a world-class employer
where people are respected for
their work and their effort. We
have given our time for this cam
paign â€” now it's an escalation of
what we've already done. We're
putting our bodies on the line."
Earle said that the University
has not yet decided what their re
sponse will be but that they were
focused on the physical well-being
of the students.
"We are just now learning the
details on the strike," he said. "At
this point our main concern is that
nothing happen that will in any
way harm the health of the stu
dents who are involved."
The rally was held in the Main
Quad and used an amplification
device, which is a violation of the
University's policy concerning the
use of the Quad because it disrupts
University classes and other activi
ties. Earle said that the University
is reviewing the event, and a deci
sion will be made soon.

rary workers for jobs that could be
permanent, increase in worker ac
cess to benefits, job security, equal
work for equal pay and the right to
"a voice at work," ensuring that
temp agencies adhere to Stan
lord's own labor standards and
making a policy protecting temp
workers from retaliation for speak
ing out.
Gordon Earle, vice provost for
public affairs, said that while the
University did not have the full re
port, Stanford has addressed the
issue of labor standards on cam
pus.
"The full report has not yet
been made available to the Univer
sity so it is impossible to comment
on its facts and conclusions," Earle

said. "In addition, the executive
summary of the report says that
the survey is not a representative
sample of Stanford workers. In
fact, our understanding is that it
includes, at most, only 18 workers
on Stanford's payroll. That being
said, Stanford believes its labor
policies, both toward regular and
temporary employees, are fair and
reasonable."
He said that the University's ex
isting labor policies showed the
University's commitment to the
issue and that while the report did
not represent Stanford workers,
the University would look closely
at it.
"Stanford believes its current
labor polices are fair and reason
able," he said. "For example, we
recently became one of the few in
stitutions of higher learning in the
country and the only private em
ployer in the area that adopted liv
ing-wage and benefit guidelines.
This and other labor policies un
derscore the University's deep
commitment to fair employment
practices.
"Nonetheless, we appreciate
being provided with the informa
tion in the report and intend to
take a close look at it,"he contin
ued. "We realize it is not a repre
sentative survey but will, nonethe
less, give it careful consideration."
Victoria Vega, a former house
keeper at the Stanford Hospital
who spoke at the rally, said that
Manpower, the temporary work
agency that employs her through a
contract with the University, told
her that she was laid off because
the University was upset that she
continued to ask for permanent
employment at her position.
"I have worked at Stanford for

eight years, and I am not in a per
manent position," she said. "I can't
get a permanent position because I
can't speak English fluently."
Earle said that he had no infor
mation concerning this case.
At the rally, other workers,
union representatives and a reli
gious leader also spoke.
"We're behind you, we've al
ways been behind you, and we'll
continue to be behind you," said
Monseigneur Eugene Boyle, a re

tired priest of the diocese of San
Jose and chair emeritus of the
Inter-Faith Council, which repre
sents a cross-section of religions.
Students, including those rep
resenting the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition and the Coalition for
Labor Justice, were with the work
ers at the rally.
"The core of the code of con
duct is essentially about temporary
labor, because that's where the
most flagrant labor abuses occur at

Stanford," said senior Meghana
Reddy, a member of the Stanford
Coalition for Labor Justice. "The
[University] president's living
wage policy explicitly excludes
both subcontracted temporary
workers and their own directly
hired temporary workers. These
are the workers who are living in
the worst conditions. They framed
the policy as a safety net, but it's
not."
Six students from the Coalition

for Labor Justice have begun a
hunger fast that they say is meant
to challenge the administration to
create a code of conduct that
would apply to all workers at Stan
ford.
"As a coalition, we thought that
a fast would be the appropriate
event for our code of conduct cam
paign," said junior Leticia
Ramirez, a co-coordinator of
SLAC. "We have demonstrated
our commitment and our belief in
the code of conduct over the past
few years. This action is another
expression of our commitment.
She added, "This is in response
to the University's consistently su
perficial commitment to resolving
serious labor issues on this campus
and their lack of commitment to
becoming a world-class employer
where people are respected for
their work and their effort. We
have given our time for this cam
paign â€” now it's an escalation of
what we've already done. We're
putting our bodies on the line."
Earle said that the University
has not yet decided what their re
sponse will be but that they were
focused on the physical well-being
of the students.
"We are just now learning the
details on the strike," he said. "At
this point our main concern is that
nothing happen that will in any
way harm the health of the stu
dents who are involved."
The rally was held in the Main
Quad and used an amplification
device, which is a violation of the
University's policy concerning the
use of the Quad because it disrupts
University classes and other activi
ties. Earle said that the University
is reviewing the event, and a deci
sion will be made soon.

Juan Posadas, who has been employed as a temporary worker at University Dining Services for two and a half years,
shares his experiences with the crowd at yesterday's press conference in the Quad.
Over 100 workers and students
gathered in the Main Quad outside of
the office of University President John
Hennessy at noon yesterday to seek a
number of changes in employment
practices concerning temporary work
ers at Stanford.
The rally marked the release of a re
port done by SEIU Local 715 and

Working Partnership USA that found
a number of problems with how Stan
ford currently employs temporary
workers. It also was the beginning of a
hunger fast by six students, who are
calling upon the University to change
its labor standards in light of what they
say are serious problems facing work
ers on campus.
The report, based on a survey of 72
workers at Stanford and its associated
hospitals, issued a wide range of statis

tics and recommendations relating to
temporary workers. It found that 73
percent of Stanford workers made
below a living wage, compared to 8
percent who made below a living wage
in Santa Clara County.
A living wage is defined by Santa
Clara County as $10.10 per hour with
health benefits and $11.35 without
benefits. The University's living-wage

guidelines are based off of the
Santa Clara County standard and
applies to non-temporary, non
unionized, non-subcontracted
workers on campus not already
employed by the University.
The survey also found that 68
percent of workers did not have
any form of health insurance, and
21 percent reported using the
emergency room because they did
not have a regular doctor.
Fifteen percent of the workers
owned homes, the survey said; 46
percent were forced to "double
up" in houses with other families.
The survey found that 67 per
cent of workers had worked at
Stanford more than six months.
The report made a number of
recommendations to Stanford
concerning temporary workers,
including the end of use of tempo
rary workers for jobs that could be
permanent, increase in worker ac
cess to benefits, job security, equal
work for equal pay and the right to
"a voice at work," ensuring that
