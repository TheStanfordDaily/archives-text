Over 100 workers and students
gathered in the Main Quad outside of
the office of University President John
Hennessy at noon yesterday to seek a
number of changes in employment
practices concerning temporary work
ers at Stanford.
The rally marked the release of a re

Working Partnership USA that found
a number of problems with how Stan
ford currently employs temporary
workers. It also was the beginning of a
hunger fast by six students, who are
calling upon the University to change

say are serious problems facing work
ers on campus.
The report, based on a survey of 72
workers at Stanford and its associated

below a living wage, compared to 8
percent who made below a living wage
in Santa Clara County.
A living wage is defined by Santa
Clara County as $10.10 per hour with
health benefits and $11.35 without
benefits. The University's living-wage
