# SIC to face new requirements
## Students worry that review could have negative impact 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Committee for Undergraduate Standards
and Policy voted on Friday to recommend that all
Student Initiated Courses go through an "expedited
process" of review within departments, similar to the
process regular courses go through before they be
come official. Currently, while some courses are spon
sored directly by departments, professors can also in
dependently approve Student Initiated Courses for
credit through directed reading, avoiding a depart
mental approval.
While many faculty are lauding the decision for
helping to standardize the caliber of courses offered
for credit, SIC coordinators call it problematic be
cause they fear courses will not be approved because
of red tape or departmental politics.
"The purpose of the changes we are planning is to
secure the academic quality of SICs by establishing
clear responsibilities for faculty sponsors to ensure
the adequacy of teaching and assessment," said com
mittee member Eomonn Callan, a professor of edu
cation and senior associate dean for academic ser
vices. "SICs cannot flourish at Stanford unless faculty
and departments are accountable for their quality."
The committee — comprised of three fully-voting
student representatives and nine faculty representa
tives — recommended that the changes come into ef
fect within one year.
SIC co-coordinator Molly (llinehens, a senior, said
that the decision was made rashly and that the cur-
rent structure of the SIC program
already addresses the committee's
concerns.
"The decision had been too
quick, without the necessary sup
port to guarantee follow-through
on the policy," she said. "This year
SIC coordinators have made huge
strides in the area of quality control.
Student leaders are required to at
tend four mandatory training ses
sions in course design, teaching
skills and integrating service-learn
ing into their courses. New con
tracts between student leaders and
faculty sponsors clearly delineate
each [person's] responsibility, and it
is made clear that the faculty spon
sors are ultimately responsible for
the academic quality of the course."

The SIC coordinators formed a
sub-committee this year made up
of students, faculty and staff to ad
vise the program. The coordina
tors said that because expectations
have already been set within the
program, the University commit
tee's recommendation will not af
fect the academic quality of SIC
courses.
The coordinators also said that
they wanted more support from
the committee to help guarantee
that departments institute special
protocols to review Student Initiat
ed Courses, but that now they are
being asked by the University com
mittee to lay the "groundwork for
a policy about which we feel am
bivalent."
Callan argued, however, that
greater accountability to depart
ments by those involved in SIC
would better ensure that the cours
es were of high quality.

"The SIC program established
by the ASSU is an exciting educa
tional innovation, and our propos
als are intended to consolidate its
successes," he said. "The main dif
ficulty with the status quo is that
faculty who agree to sponsor a
course are not accountable to their
departments for ensuring that the
course is of adequate quality. Our
proposals will change that, and so
students who enroll in SICs can
have the assurance that this is a
course that's good enough for
Stanford."
While the majority of the com
mittee approved the plan, some
faculty and students were less en
thusiastic.
"I think the [current] program
is fine," said Clifford Barnett, pro
fessor emeritus of anthropological
sciences in his third year as the fac
ulty sponsor fora student-led
course on the mental health of vet

erans. "There is a good amount of
sponsor involvement and I think
that is enough.
"Changes are not necessary,"
Barnett added, "but there may be
other situations where there is not
good advising and follow-through
by faculty sponsors."
Sophomore Dayna Muniz, who
co-taught a course on immigration
and border issues last quarter, said
departmental control could possi
bly have a negative impact on the
program.
"I think there is a danger of
non-traditional courses not getting
approved," she said. "Many times
politics gets in the way, and people
feel that something is not worthy of
being seen as academic knowl
edge, so I feel there is a real risk
that some departments might not
approve courses that don't neces
sarily fit the department's 'out
look.' "
