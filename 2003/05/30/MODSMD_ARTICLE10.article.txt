# Protecting the California Tiger Salamander on the Farm
## Gov't places Lag-dweller on protected list 
### ERICK FLORES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser
vice has recommended the Cali
fornia Tiger Salamander — an
amphibian species found in Lake
Lagunita by scientists during the
1930s — for protection under the
federal Endangered Species Act.
However, this change in the
species' status is not expected to
significantly affect the Stanford
community's usage of Lake Lagu
nita.
Conservation plans were first
implemented in California during
the early 19905, when tiger sala
mander populations were found
to be declining across the state.
.After an initial petition process to
classify the species as "threatened,"
the government finally declared it
"endangered" — a special status
assigned when a species is at risk of
becoming extinct.
* Documents released by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service cited a
"loss and fragmentation of habitat
due to human activities and en
croachment of non-native preda
tors" as primary causes for the sala
mander's population decline.
Harmful human contributions

have included the use ofinsect poi
sons and pesticides, which greatly
reduce the availability of prey, as
well as automobiles, which often
kill the tiger salamanders during
migration.
It has been estimated that as
much as 75 percent of the tiger
salamander's natural habitat has
been lost so far.
Because Lake is an
important breeding ground for
the tiger salamanders, the Univer
sity has employed extensive con
servation plans to maintain the
lake as a functioning wetlands.
Alan Launer, a biologist and re
search associate with the Stanford
Center for Conservation Biology,
said that Lake Lagunita provides a
near perfect place for the creatures
to reproduce.
Because Lake Lagunita is an ar
tificially constructed reservoir,
"the water quality is typically better
than a natural pool. .. there is an
abundance of food . . . and the
droves of people around chase
away the predatory birds," he said.
One of the first and most signif
icant changes Stanford made in re
sponse to the dwindling popula
tion of the tiger salamander
species was to move the annual Big

Game bonfire from the Lagunita
lake bed to a location near the
Stanford Stadium. Since then, the
lake has still been used by Univer
sity community members for
recreational and educational pur
poses, including swimming, wind
surfing and outdoor education
labs.
According to Launer, most stu
dents will not even notice plans put
in place to protect the species'

habitat.
"[The University has] been
working on the assumption that
Lagunita should be managed in a
multi-use but salamander-friendly
way, for years," Launer said.
"The listing of the tiger sala
mander will have little impact on
Stanford students," he added.
The usual aim of the Endan
gered Species Act is to achieve re
covery, which is defined as when
conservation actions increase a
species' numbers so that it is no
longer considered at-risk. This
happens rarely, however, and it is
more common fora species to be
removed from endangerment sta
tus through actual extinction or
upon the introduction of new in
formation proving there is less of a
threat to the species' survival.
Launer mentioned that, al
though Stanford has been work
ing in conjunction with govern
ment agencies fora number of
years to obtain the appropriate
permits to care for the tiger sala
manders, it will be approximately
another year before the University
receives a final approval.
Currently, the tiger salamander
is only protected at the Jepson
Prairie Natural and Hickson Pre
serves in northern California.
State-wide federal protection is not
expected to be put into effect until
May 2004, when all formal public
and political debates have been
discussed and settled.
