Yesterday's story, "Univ. asks
for SARS caution," inaccurately
characterized the University's
unofficial policy toward Com
mencement visitors from SARS
affected regions.
The University discour
ages people with SARS symp
toms from traveling, kxit there
is no policy preventing people
from SARS-affected regions
from coming to Stanford in
June.
