## Israeli prime minister also agrees to ease travel restrictions on Palestinians

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon told Palestinian
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas yester
day lie would ease travel restrictions on
Palestinians and free some prisoners,
while insisting on a swift crackdown on vi
olent groups in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
The meeting — the second between
Sharon and Abbas in two weeks — was
called to discuss disagreements over secu
rity and Palestinian statehood that could
complicate a three-way summit next week
in Jordan with President Bush.
Before that summit, Bush will meet
with Arab leaders in Egypt to enlist their
support. The president said he would
"look at these leaders in the eye and say, 1
believe peace is possible, and I'm going to

work to peace. And this isn't just a visit iit
which you won't hear from me again. I be
lieve peace is necessary and possible."
The Sharon-Abbas meeting came after,
the Islamic militant group Hamas hekl
out the possibility of a cease-fire to end at
tacks that have killed hundreds of lsraelis
in 32 months of violence. >»i*
Israel has demanded the Palestinians
dismantle the militant groups in acCor*
dance with the U.S.-backed "road map"
peace plan. Abbas has said he prefers to
use persuasion to stop attacks. There was
no indication the two sides resolved that
disagreement, which could be a key stumr
bling block in peace negotiations. i
In the nearly 3-hour meeting last
night, Sharon told Abbas that as a good
faith measure he would unilaterally end
the 2-week-old closure on the West Bank
and allow 25,000 Palestinian workers to
enter Israel. Israel also would ease some
roadblocks around Palestinian towns and
release some prisoners, according to ls-1
raeli and Palestinian officials.
