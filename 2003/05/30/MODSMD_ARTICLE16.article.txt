## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Women faculty at Stanford 
### 
Over the past few decades, many
women have left their traditional
role at home for the professional
workplace. They have made com
mendable gains in leadership positions and
financial success. Unfortunately, there still
exists a substantial gap between men and
women concerning income levels and top
positions in many fields — including the aca
demic world.
Given the progressive atmosphere of the
Stanford campus, where the past and current
ASSU presidents and several campus leaders
have been women — one would think that
Stanford would be exempt from the gap exist
ing between men and women in the work
place. Yet a closer look at the numbers reveals
a different picture: men still make up nearly
80 percent of the faculty on the Farm.
On May 22, the Provost's Advisory Com
mittee on the Status of Women Faculty issued
several recommendations on hiring and re

taining female faculty
members. The recom
mendations were based
on a recent analysis that
measured the dispari
ties between men and
women regarding labo
ratory space, equip
ment, startup funds, re
search funds and sum
mer salaries. The re
port found "insignifi
cant" differences in all

of these fields — except for one: men were
more likely to receive retention bonuses be
cause they often used outside offers as tools on
the bargaining table.
In a recent Faculty Senate meeting, Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode noted that "Women
may be more likely than men to have family
obligations and be more geographically con
strained as a consequence. Socialization may
play a role as well." These reasons may explain
why women are less likely to have outside of
fers, which places them at a disadvantage for
bonuses or promotions, as they may lack some
of these essential bargaining tools.
The motivation for the report can be traced
back to a Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy comprehensive analysis performed in 2001
that found significant quantifiable differences
between men and women in terms of re
sources and university support at MIT. Stan
ford administrators consequently created a
committee — the Provost's Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Faculty — that
would analyze hiring and retention letters, lab
oratory space and summer salaries across de
partments at Stanford over several years, at
tempting to figure out if disparities based on
gender existed on campus. The report issued
Thursday included only preliminary findings,
as the business and medical school statistics
were not yet available.

At a prestigious university such
as Stanford, the tenure track is
rigorous, competitive and not very
forgiving — and women often face
additional difficulties.

monitoring the status of women faculty at
Stanford, yet we hope that the University con
tinues to work on increasing the numbers of
women faculty across the departments. Cur
rently, there are only 379 female faculty
members — compared to 1,335 men. This is
simply not acceptable.
One of the solutions to increasing the
numbers of women faculty has been to pro
mote graduate school diversity, which would
prepare more women to become faculty. In
the 2002-2003 graduate student class, women
made up only 36 percent. However, certain
changes would be necessary, considering the
current hiring process: At Stanford, graduate
students face what Associate Professor of Elec
trical Engineering Andrea Goldsmith re
ferred to at the Faculty Senate meeting as a
"huge barrier" against hiring Stanford grad
uates for faculty positions. Thus, increasing
graduate school diversity —an important
feat in of itself — would work best if coupled

with a change in cur
rent hiring trends.
Moreover, substan
tial effort should also
be placed on increas
ing the amount of
women faculty that re
ceive tenure. At a pres
tigious university such
at Stanford, the tenure
track is rigorous, com
petitive and not very
forgiving.

Associate Prof, of Philosophy Debra Satz
explained to the senate the additional diffi
culties women face regarding tenure. "If I
think about my own department, the two
women who rose to tenure both had children
after tenure, as they were sliding into senility
. . . like me. In contrast, those who had chil
dren before tenure did not get tenure," Satz
said.
Although the University does grant extra
time for acquiring tenure if women are in
need of a maternity leave, the implicit as
sumption may be that they also have addi
tional time to do more research. The pressure
to publish and become well-recognized is
never absent.
It is therefore clear that the University
should keep these additional difficulties in
mind: a critical analysis — and possible re
structuring — of the tenure process may be
necessary.
Stanford should certainly be proud that
the recent report found only small disparities
between men and women faculty already at
working on campus, yet there are still major
steps that need to be made before the process
is equal to both genders. We are confident
that if University administrators look to the
recommendations of their notable faculty
members, these changes may take place soon
er than expected, in line with Stanford's rep
utation as an forward-thinking institution.

Given the progressive atmosphere of the
Stanford campus, where the past and current
ASSU presidents and several campus leaders
have been women — one would think that
Stanford would be exempt from the gap exist
ing between men and women in the work
place. Yet a closer look at the numbers reveals
a different picture: men still make up nearly
80 percent of the faculty on the Farm.
On May 22, the Provost's Advisory Com
mittee on the Status of Women Faculty issued
several recommendations on hiring and re

taining female faculty
members. The recom
mendations were based
on a recent analysis that
measured the dispari
ties between men and
women regarding labo
ratory space, equip
ment, startup funds, re
search funds and sum
mer salaries. The re
port found "insignifi
cant" differences in all

of these fields — except for one: men were
more likely to receive retention bonuses be
cause they often used outside offers as tools on
the bargaining table.
In a recent Faculty Senate meeting, Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode noted that "Women
may be more likely than men to have family
obligations and be more geographically con
strained as a consequence. Socialization may
play a role as well." These reasons may explain
why women are less likely to have outside of
fers, which places them at a disadvantage for
bonuses or promotions, as they may lack some
of these essential bargaining tools.
The motivation for the report can be traced
back to a Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy comprehensive analysis performed in 2001
that found significant quantifiable differences
between men and women in terms of re
sources and university support at MIT. Stan
ford administrators consequently created a
committee — the Provost's Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Faculty — that
would analyze hiring and retention letters, lab
oratory space and summer salaries across de
partments at Stanford over several years, at
tempting to figure out if disparities based on
gender existed on campus. The report issued
Thursday included only preliminary findings,
as the business and medical school statistics
were not yet available.
We commend the Provost's Office for

At a prestigious university such
as Stanford, the tenure track is
rigorous, competitive and not very
forgiving — and women often face
additional difficulties.

monitoring the status of women faculty at
Stanford, yet we hope that the University con
tinues to work on increasing the numbers of
women faculty across the departments. Cur
rently, there are only 379 female faculty
members — compared to 1,335 men. This is
simply not acceptable.
One of the solutions to increasing the
numbers of women faculty has been to pro
mote graduate school diversity, which would
prepare more women to become faculty. In
the 2002-2003 graduate student class, women
made up only 36 percent. However, certain
changes would be necessary, considering the
current hiring process: At Stanford, graduate
students face what Associate Professor of Elec
trical Engineering Andrea Goldsmith re
ferred to at the Faculty Senate meeting as a
"huge barrier" against hiring Stanford grad
uates for faculty positions. Thus, increasing
graduate school diversity —an important
feat in of itself — would work best if coupled

with a change in cur
rent hiring trends.
Moreover, substan
tial effort should also
be placed on increas
ing the amount of
women faculty that re
ceive tenure. At a pres
tigious university such
at Stanford, the tenure
track is rigorous, com
petitive and not very
forgiving.

Associate Prof, of Philosophy Debra Satz
explained to the senate the additional diffi
culties women face regarding tenure. "If I
think about my own department, the two
women who rose to tenure both had children
after tenure, as they were sliding into senility
. . . like me. In contrast, those who had chil
dren before tenure did not get tenure," Satz
said.
Although the University does grant extra
time for acquiring tenure if women are in
need of a maternity leave, the implicit as
sumption may be that they also have addi
tional time to do more research. The pressure
to publish and become well-recognized is
never absent.
It is therefore clear that the University
should keep these additional difficulties in
mind: a critical analysis — and possible re
structuring — of the tenure process may be
necessary.
Stanford should certainly be proud that
the recent report found only small disparities
between men and women faculty already at
working on campus, yet there are still major
steps that need to be made before the process
is equal to both genders. We are confident
that if University administrators look to the
recommendations of their notable faculty
members, these changes may take place soon
er than expected, in line with Stanford's rep
utation as an forward-thinking institution.
