Members of Coalition for Labor Justice
support the fast for code of conduct
As members of the coalition, we are
disturbed by the problems facing many
workers on campus. We recognize that
Stanford University is in many ways a
world-class institution that sets the stan
dards for education, research and medi
cal care. As Stanford students we feel the
University has a unique responsibility to
lead the way in ensuring fairness for all
workers in the community. All workers
irir the Stanford community should be
piid enough to support their families,
h4ve affordable healthcare and retire
with dignity.
We thus support the students who

have chosen to make a personal commit
ment to this cause by fasting and thus
drawing attention to an often-over
looked but very pressing issue. We fur
thermore call on President Hennessy to
commit to creating a code of conduct for
employment that would cover all Stan
ford workers, through a decision-mak
ing process that substantially includes
students and workers.
