# ANIMAL FARM
## The 						times are a-changin' 
### 
I don't want to sound like a 70
year-old woman, complain
ing about how things were in
the good old days. But I feel
that we live in a changed world.
The tragedy of Sept. 11 has left an
indelible mark on the psyche of the
American people. Some of it
changed us for the better, but
many of the changes look to be for
the worst.
Writing this column has forced
me to stay up to date on Universi
ty news, follow the ASSU election
and read The Daily regularly.
What I have noticed is a funda
mental change in University poli
cies in the past couple of months.
Changing the freshman alcohol
regulations, hard-hitting on fra
ternities: It seems like the ap
proach of the administration to
ward undergraduate residential
life has been evolving.
Maybe this happens every year.
Maybe there have been changes
before that caused a stir in the stu
dent body. Maybe the decision a
few years ago banning the use of
house funds in freshman dorms to
purchase alcohol freaked out the
undergrads and made us think
that Stanford was going downhill
— and fast.
But what I've really noticed
about Stanford is the unique na
ture of its relationship with stu
dents. I come from a small New
England town. I know what it's like
to know everyone's name, family,
car and favorite ice cream llavor.
But in quiet suburbia, there isn't
much to change. Towns like this
are resistant to change. They want
things to stay the same.
Stanford is a place that thrives
on change. Not many people are
happy with the new Alcohol Policy.
But this is a place where we can ac
tually do something and try to stop
it, or at least meet with the admin

istration to talk about it. Someone
told me once that she thinks Stan
ford is one of the only true direct
democracies. Perhaps all college
campuses are. Here, if you want to
meet with President Hennessy
about something, it can probably
be arranged.
I decided to write this column
fora number of reasons, but one of
them was because of my relation-

ship with Stan
ford. I love Stan
ford, but while I
was abroad, I
started to resent
things about our
school. Stepping
away from the
campus, I more
fully understood

its limitations, but I felt like Stan
ford students weren't willing to ac
knowledge these faults. I can't
quite figure it out — I think it's a
California thing. On the East
Coast, people pride themselves on
their caustic bluntness.
So I wrote these weekly
columns because I wanted to ex
pose issues, talk about what was on
my mind and motivate change. I
hope I accomplished a little bit of
this. I heard of a columnist a few
years back whose therapist told
him to write a column because it
would be cathartic. Now I really
understand this idea. My biggest
frustration with Stanford is how
we all go about our business, ig
noring our problems — both per
sonal and communal. We don't
admit to our fears or realize our in
adequacies. We ignore the people
we've hooked up with. We walk by
the protesters in White Plaza, flash
them a smile, but then continue on
to our classes. I value honesty in
people more than anything else,
and this column made me feel
more honest, allowing me to share

my opinions with the community.
But we live in a bubble. Even if
we make Stanford better, that's re
ally just 6,500 undergrads, 7,000
grad students and 1,700 faculty
members who are better off. There
is still a world full of problems.
Some are right next door in East
Palo Alto. We have domestic prob
lems, international conflicts and
environmental concerns.
Sometimes it feels futile and
selfish to try to change Stanford,
when we already have it all.
Regardless of your skin color,
socioeconomic status or home
town, life is good at Stanford.
Some things could be better, but
overall, we are some of the most
privileged people on the planet.
Graduating with a Stanford de
gree is an automatic seal of ap
proval to the world.
With that in mind, we have
even more of a responsibility to use
our privilege to help those who
don't enjoy this status. It's really
just as much a product of luck as
anything else that got us to Stan
ford. Yes, hard work did pay off.
But think about those kids in high
school who worked as hard as you
did, and just weren't lucky enough
to be born with the brains to get
here.
Being able to say whatever I
wanted in this column has been a
right that I very much enjoyed.
Sure, the editorial staff cut out a
couple of expletives every once
and a while, but overall I had the
ability to say whatever was on my
mind.
It is a harsh reality that many
people in the world still do not
enjoy the right to express them
selves freely. It is an even harsher
reality that our government is
starting to place limitations on this


Caroline Ci«one

right. Yeah I know, the govern
ment isn't exactly going to call me
up and tell me that I'm saying in
appropriate things about Stan
ford. But along with change comes
a necessity to maintain rights we al
ready have and a responsibility to
share them with people who don't
have the same freedoms.
I hope I've done 1 percent of

what I've been talking about: mak
ing students think about issues
and want to change them. I'm at
least thankful that I got the oppor
tunity to try. And that's what it re
ally comes down to, making a dif
ference. The Stanford experience
is making sure we take advantage
of as many opportunities as we
can.
Go Cardinal.

happy with the new Alcohol Policy.
But this is a place where we can ac
tually do something and try to stop
it, or at least meet with the admin

istration to talk about it. Someone
told me once that she thinks Stan
ford is one of the only true direct
democracies. Perhaps all college
campuses are. Here, if you want to
meet with President Hennessy
about something, it can probably
be arranged.
I decided to write this column
fora number of reasons, but one of
them was because of my relation-

ship with Stan
ford. I love Stan
ford, but while I
was abroad, I
started to resent
things about our
school. Stepping
away from the
campus, I more
fully understood

its limitations, but I felt like Stan
ford students weren't willing to ac
knowledge these faults. I can't
quite figure it out — I think it's a
California thing. On the East
Coast, people pride themselves on
their caustic bluntness.
So I wrote these weekly
columns because I wanted to ex
pose issues, talk about what was on
my mind and motivate change. I
hope I accomplished a little bit of
this. I heard of a columnist a few
years back whose therapist told
him to write a column because it
would be cathartic. Now I really
understand this idea. My biggest
frustration with Stanford is how
we all go about our business, ig
noring our problems — both per
sonal and communal. We don't
admit to our fears or realize our in
adequacies. We ignore the people
we've hooked up with. We walk by
the protesters in White Plaza, flash
them a smile, but then continue on
to our classes. I value honesty in
people more than anything else,
and this column made me feel
more honest, allowing me to share

my opinions with the community.
But we live in a bubble. Even if
we make Stanford better, that's re
ally just 6,500 undergrads, 7,000
grad students and 1,700 faculty
members who are better off. There
is still a world full of problems.
Some are right next door in East
Palo Alto. We have domestic prob
lems, international conflicts and
environmental concerns.
Sometimes it feels futile and
selfish to try to change Stanford,
when we already have it all.
Regardless of your skin color,
socioeconomic status or home
town, life is good at Stanford.
Some things could be better, but
overall, we are some of the most
privileged people on the planet.
Graduating with a Stanford de
gree is an automatic seal of ap
proval to the world.
With that in mind, we have
even more of a responsibility to use
our privilege to help those who
don't enjoy this status. It's really
just as much a product of luck as
anything else that got us to Stan
ford. Yes, hard work did pay off.
But think about those kids in high
school who worked as hard as you
did, and just weren't lucky enough
to be born with the brains to get
here.
Being able to say whatever I
wanted in this column has been a
right that I very much enjoyed.
Sure, the editorial staff cut out a
couple of expletives every once
and a while, but overall I had the
ability to say whatever was on my
mind.
It is a harsh reality that many
people in the world still do not
enjoy the right to express them
selves freely. It is an even harsher
reality that our government is
starting to place limitations on this

right. Yeah I know, the govern
ment isn't exactly going to call me
up and tell me that I'm saying in
appropriate things about Stan
ford. But along with change comes
a necessity to maintain rights we al
ready have and a responsibility to
share them with people who don't
have the same freedoms.
I hope I've done 1 percent of

what I've been talking about: mak
ing students think about issues
and want to change them. I'm at
least thankful that I got the oppor
tunity to try. And that's what it re
ally comes down to, making a dif
ference. The Stanford experience
is making sure we take advantage
of as many opportunities as we
can.
Go Cardinal.

I don't want to sound like a 70
year-old woman, complain
ing about how things were in
the good old days. But I feel
that we live in a changed world.
The tragedy of Sept. 11 has left an
indelible mark on the psyche of the
American people. Some of it
changed us for the better, but
many of the changes look to be for
the worst.
Writing this column has forced
me to stay up to date on Universi
ty news, follow the ASSU election
and read The Daily regularly.
What I have noticed is a funda
mental change in University poli
cies in the past couple of months.
Changing the freshman alcohol
regulations, hard-hitting on fra
ternities: It seems like the ap
proach of the administration to
ward undergraduate residential
life has been evolving.
Maybe this happens every year.
Maybe there have been changes
before that caused a stir in the stu
dent body. Maybe the decision a
few years ago banning the use of
house funds in freshman dorms to
purchase alcohol freaked out the
undergrads and made us think
that Stanford was going downhill
— and fast.
But what I've really noticed
about Stanford is the unique na
ture of its relationship with stu
dents. I come from a small New
England town. I know what it's like
to know everyone's name, family,
car and favorite ice cream llavor.
But in quiet suburbia, there isn't
much to change. Towns like this
are resistant to change. They want
things to stay the same.
Stanford is a place that thrives
on change. Not many people are
happy with the new Alcohol Policy.

tually do something and try to stop
it, or at least meet with the admin

istration to talk about it. Someone
