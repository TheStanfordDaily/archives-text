# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Rethinking current oil consumption 
### JONATHAN NERIL CHRISTOPHER KOST GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Summer has come, school is almost out
and Americans will drive off on vacations,
happy that gas prices are falling back to
$ 1.50 per gallon. But this g(X)d news comes
with a caveat: The price we pay at the pump
does not reflect the full cost of burning a gal
lon of gasoline.
U.S. excessive oil consumption is endan
gering our national security, the global en
vironment and the future of following gen
erations. We don't want to get on a high
horse, but we do want to talk straight about
the real impacts of driving.
Protecting the United States' access to oil
comes at a considerable cost. The money we
squander on military interventions in oil
rich regions could be better spent on health
care, education and AIDS prevention. If
Iraq were sitting on vast reserves of timber,
not oil, would we have spent $80 billion on
regime change? Iliose who say the war in
Iraq was fought over weapons of mass de

struction are still waiting for real evidence
that Iraq actually had such weapons. Mean
while, U.S. soldiers die to maintain control
over Iraq's oil reserves — the second largest
in die world.
Some U.S. citizens wonder what they can
do to help win the war on terrorism besides
rooting for U.S. troops from their living
rooms or putting American flags on their
SUVs. One thing we can do is reduce the
amount ofoil that we consume. Connect the
dots: Saudi Arabia is the United States'
largest oil supplier. Its government, using
revenues from oil sales to the United States,
funds anti-U.S. religious schools at home
and in Pakistan. Moreover, U.S. military
hegemony in the Middle East — partially to
protect access to oil — fuels anti-U.S. senti
ments.
Driving also contributes to global warm
ing. The international scientific consensus,
expressed by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, is that humans are
causing a massive increase in atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels.

We are fating more intense floods, storms
and droughts; a rise in sea level and the
spread of tropical diseases. These changes
in the climate will have unpredictable con
sequences for agriculture, biodiversity and
human living conditions around the world.
Billions of people in India, Brazil, Nigeria
and other countries will bear the brunt of
climate disruption caused mostly by indus
trialized countries. The United States will
also be impacted, with poorer residents far
ing the worst because they lack the re
sources to respond. We have an obligation
to our generation and future ones to curb
climate change by reducing our emissions of
greenhouse gases.
What do we propose? First, we call on the
government to substantially increase fuel ef
ficiency standards for new vehicles. Earlier
this month, the LLS. Environmental Protec
tion Agency reported that in 2002, the aver
age fuel economy of cars and trucks in the
U.S. fell to its lowest point in over two
decades. The government must tell manu-
facturers to use the technology sit
ting on their shelves to build cars
that go further on a gallon of gas. As
long as automobiles remain our
dominant form of transportation,
we need cleaner vehicles on the
road.

Second, as individuals we need to
think more carefully about the way
we get around. For instance, SUVs
now make up over halfof all vehicles
sold in the U.S., yet most people
who buy SUVs hardly need them.
Furthermore, those who drive
alone or unnecessarily should con
sider carpooling, biking or using
public transportation.
Many people in the United
States believe they can have it all:

cheap gas, homeland security, a sta
ble climate and a car, truck or SUV
to drive them wherever and when
ever they please. Yet this wishful
thinking ignores the serious conse
quences of our oil binges.
Action now will not entirely avert
climate change or end the United
States' need to protect its access to
oil. But by responding without fur
ther delay we can pursue thought
ful solutions and gain the upper

hand in meeting our nation's na
tional sec urity and environmental
challenges.
