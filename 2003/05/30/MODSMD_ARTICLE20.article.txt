## Sustainability pledge encourages graduates to live responsibly 
### JESSICA MANTOOTH LINDSEY COX GUEST COLUMNISTS 
I pledge to explore and take into ac
count the social and environmental conse
quences of any job I consider and will try
to improve these aspects ol any organiza
tions for which I work."
1 his year, graduating seniors at Stan
lord are invited to sign the Graduation
Pledge and make a commitment to value
the well-being of the earth and its inhabi
tants through their future roles in society.
I he Graduation Pledge is a national initia
tive to raise social and environmental
awareness among the approximately 1
million college students who enter the
workforce each year.

Students are encouraged to form
their own definitions of social and envi
ronmental responsibility and the cam
paign strives to provide resources
through which they can explore these
definitions. A student may carry out her
or his commitment by joining a non
profit organization dedicated to lighting
poverty in a developing country or by
simply advocating for fair employment
practices in her or his workplace, asking
others to conserve energy. Either way, an
improvement is made.
The pledge is a national campaign
that was started in 1987. It is is now co
ordinated by Manchester College in In
diana and has been instituted at such
schools as Princeton, MIT and Duke.
This will be the third year that the pledge

is organized at Stanford. Last year about
300 seniors signed it.
We encourage every senior and grad
uate to sign the pledge and to consider
the positive impacts students can make
on society. So far, the pledge has re
ceived endorsements from over 45 stu
dent groups, academic departments, the
Alumni Association, the Career Develop
ment Center and the 2003 senior class
presidents. President Hennessy has
given his full support to the pledge, stat
ing: "I am encouraged that, even in diffi
cult economic times, so many Stanford
students recognize the importance of
making principled decisions about their
lives and their careers."
All of the people who sign the
pledge, who come from of all degree

levels, will receive a wallet-sized pledge
card reminding them of their responsibil
ity, a green ribbon to wear at graduation
and materials that suggest how they may
incorporate the principles of the pledge
into their own lives.
To increase awareness of the pledge,
Students fora Sustainable Stanford is host
ing a panel discussion for alumni who have
considered the social and environmental
consequences of their work to share their
experiences in the working world with
graduates. The discussion will take place on
June 3 at 7 p.m. on the grass lawn between
the Claw and the Birdcage in White Plaza.
The event will allow students and alumni to
brainstorm ways to work according to one's
values, network with students who are in
terested in socially and environmentally re

sponsible work and facilitate dialogue be
tween students to discuss how to incorpo
rate the pledge into their lives.
The unified support of Stanford stu
dents behind this movement will make a
simple but powerful statement that pro
motes social and environmental responsi
bility. Class of 2003, are you ready to step
up to the challenge?
