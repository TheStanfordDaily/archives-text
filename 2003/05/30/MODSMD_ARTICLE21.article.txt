## First-ever NCAA regional will be held at Stanford this weekend; coaches warn of serious schedule problems Card track and field begin marathon 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
This weekend will mark a ground-breaking
move in NCAA track and field as Stanford and
three other sites around the country play host to
the very first NCAA Regional Track and Field
Championships.
The Cardinal will host the West Regional
Championships today and Saturday and looks to
send many of its athletes to the NCAA Champi
onships in Sacramento June 11-14.
In previous years, athletes simply had to meet
time cutoffs to be invited to the NCAA champi
onships. This year, however, athletes first met re
gional qualifying standards and now on top of
that will have to place in the top five in their re
gion to earn a spot in the championships.
In addition, six to eight athletes will be award
ed at-large bids to nationals.
The West Regional will be composed of run
ners from Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada,
Oregon, Utah and Washington.
While there seems to be optimism about the
impact of the regional system, some of collegiate
track and field's most prominent coaches remain
skeptical.
"I'm not really sure why we did it, and I was on
the committee," said Vin Lananna, director of
track and field at Stanford. "But, this is what we
have, so we will work toward our goals with the
regional championships in mind."
One of the many stated goals was to increase
the field size. This year, there will be more than
1,100 athletes in the championships, about a 40
percent increase over last year.
' To John McDonnell, the head coach at
Arkansas, this is a step backward, not forward.
"There's no need to give a pat on the back to
mediocrity," McDonnell told the Associated
Press.
His concerns have been echoed by coaches of
some of the top track and field programs across
the nation who feel that by expanding the num
ber of athletes, the fields are simply bigger and
not better.
Then, with the addition of the regionals, the
national championship itself was pushed back
two weeks, bringing it within five days of the U.S.
National Championships.
"The top American athletes will have to
choose their events wisely with the NCAAs this
close to the U .S. Nationals," Lananna said. " They
will be turning around only a few days later and
to compete for spots on the national team is very
difficult."
Colorado's Jorge Torres, the reigning cross
country champion and favorite in the 5,000, has
decided to step down in distance to 1,500 to be
rested for U.S. Nationals the next week.
And with the addition of more preliminary
rounds, including one for the 5,000, running
multiple events has become even more difficult,

shaking up the team competition for the NCAA
title.
Still, the Cardinal remains optimistic about its
chances at the NCAA level and will look to quali
fy many athletes for the national championships.
Leading the way for the women will be senior
Lauren Fleshman, the two-time defending
champion in the 5,000. She has already posted
the No. 3 collegiate time ever in the event and will
look to both defend her title and help the women
return to the awards stand for the first time in 11
years. Fleshman, redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
and sophomore Sara Bei will attempt to dupli
cate their 1-2-3 sweep at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships in the 5,000.
Senior Malindi Elmore will lead the Cardinal
at 1,500 meters in one of the toughest middle-dis
tance regions in the country. Already qualified in
the heptathlon, junior Lillian Bush will attempt
to qualify in the long jump after her break-out
leap at Pac-lOs that earned her runner-up in the
event. Junior Jillian Camarena should cruise
through regionals in the shot put, focusing in
stead on the national championships where she
finished third last year and second during in
door.
For the men, junior Louis Luchini , coming
off his 5,000-10,000 double at Pac-lOs, is expect-

Ed to cruise to a regional 5,000 title. Luchini is
also automatically qualified in the 10,000 for the
NCAA Championships.
"I really don't know which one I will be doing
at nationals yet," Luchini said. "Because there is a
prelim in the 5,000 this year and because U.S.
Nationals is so close, I can only do one."
Junior Grant Robison will focus on the 1,500
and will face-off against Kip Kangogo of BYU,
who has posted the West Region's fastest time of
the year.
Senior Milton Little will have to rebound from
his fourth-place finish in the long jump at Pac-10s
to secure his spot in die top-five this weekend.
In the discus, senior Omer I nan faces
mostly competitors from the Pac-10, includ
ing rival Dan Ames of UCLA, among others.
In the hammer, fellow senior Nick Welihozkiy
will be out for revenge against Adam Kriz of
Oregon after the Stanford thrower lost the
Pac-10 Championships by only seven cen
timeters to Kriz.
Events begin at Cobb Track and Angell Field
with the men's hammer beginning at noon on
Friday and with the women's hammer starting at
10 a.m. on Saturday. Prelims in the running
events will be held on Friday while the finals
begin at 2:45 p.m. on Saturday.

return to the awards stand for the first time in 11
years. Fleshman, redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
and sophomore Sara Bei will attempt to dupli
cate their 1-2-3 sweep at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships in the 5,000.
Senior Malindi Elmore will lead the Cardinal
at 1,500 meters in one of the toughest middle-dis
tance regions in the country. Already qualified in
the heptathlon, junior Lillian Bush will attempt
to qualify in the long jump after her break-out
leap at Pac-lOs that earned her runner-up in the
event. Junior Jillian Camarena should cruise
through regionals in the shot put, focusing in
stead on the national championships where she
finished third last year and second during in
door.
For the men, junior Louis Luchini , coming
off his 5,000-10,000 double at Pac-lOs, is expect-

Ed to cruise to a regional 5,000 title. Luchini is
also automatically qualified in the 10,000 for the
NCAA Championships.
"I really don't know which one I will be doing
at nationals yet," Luchini said. "Because there is a
prelim in the 5,000 this year and because U.S.
Nationals is so close, I can only do one."
Junior Grant Robison will focus on the 1,500
and will face-off against Kip Kangogo of BYU,
who has posted the West Region's fastest time of
the year.
Senior Milton Little will have to rebound from
his fourth-place finish in the long jump at Pac-10s

Nick Weilhozkiy will look for revenge against Oregon's Adam Kriz at this weekend's first-ever West Re
gional at Stanford. The junior hammer thrower lost to Kriz by only seven inches at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. With the change in format, the NCAA Finals and U.S. Nationals fall within two days of each other.
This weekend will mark a ground-breaking
move in NCAA track and field as Stanford and
three other sites around the country play host to
the very first NCAA Regional Track and Field
Championships.
The Cardinal will host the West Regional
Championships today and Saturday and looks to
send many of its athletes to the NCAA Champi
onships in Sacramento June 11-14.
In previous years, athletes simply had to meet
time cutoffs to be invited to the NCAA champi
onships. This year, however, athletes first met re
gional qualifying standards and now on top of
that will have to place in the top five in their re
gion to earn a spot in the championships.
In addition, six to eight athletes will be award
ed at-large bids to nationals.
The West Regional will be composed of run
ners from Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada,
Oregon, Utah and Washington.
While there seems to be optimism about the
impact of the regional system, some of collegiate
track and field's most prominent coaches remain
skeptical.
"I'm not really sure why we did it, and I was on
the committee," said Vin Lananna, director of
track and field at Stanford. "But, this is what we
have, so we will work toward our goals with the
regional championships in mind."
One of the many stated goals was to increase
the field size. This year, there will be more than
1,100 athletes in the championships, about a 40
percent increase over last year.
' To John McDonnell, the head coach at
Arkansas, this is a step backward, not forward.
"There's no need to give a pat on the back to
mediocrity," McDonnell told the Associated
Press.
His concerns have been echoed by coaches of
some of the top track and field programs across
the nation who feel that by expanding the num
ber of athletes, the fields are simply bigger and
not better.
Then, with the addition of the regionals, the
national championship itself was pushed back
two weeks, bringing it within five days of the U.S.
National Championships.
"The top American athletes will have to
choose their events wisely with the NCAAs this
close to the U .S. Nationals," Lananna said. " They
will be turning around only a few days later and
to compete for spots on the national team is very
difficult."
Colorado's Jorge Torres, the reigning cross
country champion and favorite in the 5,000, has
decided to step down in distance to 1,500 to be
rested for U.S. Nationals the next week.
And with the addition of more preliminary
rounds, including one for the 5,000, running
multiple events has become even more difficult,

shaking up the team competition for the NCAA
title.
Still, the Cardinal remains optimistic about its
chances at the NCAA level and will look to quali
fy many athletes for the national championships.
Leading the way for the women will be senior
Lauren Fleshman, the two-time defending
champion in the 5,000. She has already posted
the No. 3 collegiate time ever in the event and will
look to both defend her title and help the women
return to the awards stand for the first time in 11
years. Fleshman, redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
and sophomore Sara Bei will attempt to dupli
cate their 1-2-3 sweep at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships in the 5,000.
