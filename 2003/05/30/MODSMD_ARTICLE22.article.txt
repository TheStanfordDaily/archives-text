# Reebok's big folly
## 
### 
Forrest Gump's momma
used to say that you could
tell a lot by a person's
shoes — where they're
going, where they've been.
One look at Mark Walker's
kicks probably couldn't tell you
much.
But according to Reebok, he's
the future of basketball. And he
has a lot of going — and growing
— to do.
Walker, who recently signed a
contract with Reebok, is a threat
from anywhere on the court. The
blue-chip prospect from Lee's
Summit, Missouri could follow in
the footsteps of Leßron James
and forego college. In fact, he
could skip high school, middle
school, elementary school and

kindergarten as
well.
To be per
fectly accurate,
Walker didn't
actually sign the
contract. His
mom LaShawn
did because he
hasn't learned
to write. The

kid's only three-and-a-half years
old.
Three. Tres. Trois. One, two,
thi ee. Thi ee.
What's next? Nike diapers?
A video documents Lil' Mark
draining 18 consecutive shots on
an eight-foot hoop with a, let's call
it unique, over-the-head shot that
makes Bruce Bowen at the free
throw line look smoother than
Steve Nash slicing through the
lane.
(The footage is available at
http://markwalker.reebok.com/
along with commentary from the
tot accompanying the shot.)
Reebok's latest ad campaign
will feature Walker in a series of
short segments that solicits par
ents to send in tapes of their own
kids performing amazing athletic
feats in an apparent ploy to beat
Nike to the youngest talent the
world has to offer. In one seg
ment, Walker declares, "1 am the
future of basketball. I am
Reebok."
Gag me.
It's only a matter of time be
fore Nike or Reebok tries to ink

newborns or sperm at donor
banks to lifetime contracts.
Reebok's premier client, the
older but often juvenile Allen
Iverson, has carried the company
into the new millennium and en
sured its place on shelves and on
the hardcourt for years to come.
But Reebok is banking on the suc
cess of LiT Walker — coupled
with the already well-received
and hilarious I crry Tate, Office
Linebacker — to quell the sting
that came with failing to land Le-
Bron James.
There was speculation that
Reebok was close to a deal with
James, who is certainly a surer
thing than Walker. But as Jerry
West and the Memphis Grizzlies
can attest, close only counts in
horseshoes and hand
grenades — and certainly not the
Le Bron sweepstakes.
One week after the ping-pong
balls revealed the Cavaliers were
the first lucky winners of the Le-
Bron lottety, James scored the
first of many future endorsement
slam dunks by agreeing in princi
ple to a sickening seven-year $90
million contract with Nike, ac
cording to several published re
ports.
Nike also confirmed the sign
ing of Carmelo Anthony — the
sensational Syracuse freshman
who provided more than his fair
share of swooshes in the face of
opposing players during the
NCAA tournament.
But CEO Philip Knight didn't
stop there. Taking a page out of
Reebok's book and perhaps con
ceding that at age 18 James prac
tically already has one foot in the
grave, Nike robbed the cradle as
well, signing 14-year old soccer
prodigy Freddy Adu to a $1 mil
lion deal.
Dusty Baker's son is next. I can
feel it.
For whatever reason, we are a
sports nation obsessed with
footwear and the shoe giants
know it all starts with the kids.
For some, the real free agents
this summer aren't Jermaine
O'Neal and Jason Kidd but Kobe
Bryant and Kevin Garnett — two
studs looking for new shoe

deals — and the big spenders with
cap room to lxx>t are Nike, Adidas
and Reebok.
Given Reebok's recent moves
and with James signed and Kobe re
portedly set to sign with Nike, And 1
and Adidas appear to have missed
(he boat — or stroller as it were —
while Converse and Fila have fallen
completely off the endorsement
map in recent years.
Basketball shoes have come a
long way since Converse All-Stars
burst onto the scene in the early
20th century. "Chucks" slowly
evolved into llashier models,
Reebok gave us Pumps, Nike gave
us Shox and several companies, in
cluding the new kid on the basket
ball-shoe block DaDa, have fash

ioned shoes after fancy cars.
I can only imagine what Forrest's
momma would say after seeing Le-
Bron's first shoe when it hits the
shelves. If it didn't blind her, one
glance at Chris Webber's glistening
DaDa kicks might lead her to be
lieve C-Webb was part of a recent
trip to the moon.
Eager spenders and stylish
bailers will have to wait for Leßron's
first Nike model to arrive.
In the meantime, we'll wait on
Mark Walker, too.
Reebok execs can only hope pu
berty does the kid well because the
Mark Sky Walkers sure has a nice
ring to it. Alas, like a box of choco
lates, you never know what you're
going to get.

Forrest Gump's momma
used to say that you could
tell a lot by a person's
shoes — where they're
going, where they've been.
One look at Mark Walker's
kicks probably couldn't tell you
much.
But according to Reebok, he's
the future of basketball. And he
has a lot of going — and growing
— to do.
Walker, who recently signed a
contract with Reebok, is a threat
from anywhere on the court. The
blue-chip prospect from Lee's
Summit, Missouri could follow in
the footsteps of Leßron James
and forego college. In fact, he
could skip high school, middle
school, elementary school and

kindergarten as
well.
To be per
fectly accurate,
Walker didn't
actually sign the
contract. His
mom LaShawn
did because he
hasn't learned
to write. The

kid's only three-and-a-half years
old.
Three. Tres. Trois. One, two,
thi ee. Thi ee.
What's next? Nike diapers?
A video documents Lil' Mark
draining 18 consecutive shots on
an eight-foot hoop with a, let's call
it unique, over-the-head shot that
makes Bruce Bowen at the free
throw line look smoother than
Steve Nash slicing through the
lane.
(The footage is available at
http://markwalker.reebok.com/
along with commentary from the
tot accompanying the shot.)
Reebok's latest ad campaign
will feature Walker in a series of
short segments that solicits par
ents to send in tapes of their own
kids performing amazing athletic
feats in an apparent ploy to beat
Nike to the youngest talent the
world has to offer. In one seg
ment, Walker declares, "1 am the
future of basketball. I am
Reebok."
Gag me.
It's only a matter of time be
fore Nike or Reebok tries to ink

newborns or sperm at donor
banks to lifetime contracts.
Reebok's premier client, the
older but often juvenile Allen
Iverson, has carried the company
into the new millennium and en
sured its place on shelves and on
the hardcourt for years to come.
But Reebok is banking on the suc
cess of LiT Walker — coupled
with the already well-received
and hilarious I crry Tate, Office
Linebacker — to quell the sting
that came with failing to land Le-
Bron James.
There was speculation that
Reebok was close to a deal with
James, who is certainly a surer
thing than Walker. But as Jerry
West and the Memphis Grizzlies
can attest, close only counts in
horseshoes and hand
grenades — and certainly not the
Le Bron sweepstakes.
One week after the ping-pong
balls revealed the Cavaliers were
the first lucky winners of the Le-
Bron lottety, James scored the
first of many future endorsement
slam dunks by agreeing in princi
ple to a sickening seven-year $90
million contract with Nike, ac
cording to several published re
ports.
Nike also confirmed the sign
ing of Carmelo Anthony — the
sensational Syracuse freshman
who provided more than his fair
share of swooshes in the face of
opposing players during the
NCAA tournament.
But CEO Philip Knight didn't
stop there. Taking a page out of
Reebok's book and perhaps con
ceding that at age 18 James prac
tically already has one foot in the
grave, Nike robbed the cradle as
well, signing 14-year old soccer
prodigy Freddy Adu to a $1 mil
lion deal.
