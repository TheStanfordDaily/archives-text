# Baseball opens NCAA regionals
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forty-win regular seasons and Pacific-10 Conference cham
pionships are nice, but everyone around the Stanford baseball
program knows that neither of those achievements determines
how an individual year will be remembered.
Head coach Mark Marquess and his staff have raised the bar
so high for the Cardinal that the lone measuring stick of any
value that marks a successful Stanford season is a berth in the
College World Series in Omaha.
And the quest for that ultimate Middle America destination
begins today as play opens in the 2003 NCAA Baseball Champi
onships at the Stanford Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (41-15) begins the second season tonight with a 6
p.m. matchup with the University of Illinois-Chicago (39-16),
while the regional's second and third seeds — Richmond (46-
13) and California-Riverside (40-15) —square off in a 2 p.m.
matinee.
The four-team mini-tournament is one of 16 regionals taking
place across the nation this weekend, and the team that emerges
from three days of double-elimination baseball will advance to
the best-of-three Super Regional round next weekend to face
the winner of the regional hosted by Long Beach State.
The Cardinal — the NCAA's No. 6 national seed — won't
overlook anyone after recent experience with another postsea
son first-timer. (Two years ago, Stanford needed a miraculous,
late-inning squeeze play to get by Marist 4-3.)
"Our older players have been around long enough that they
have enough respect for the opponent and the game [not to
overlook any team)," Marquess said. "We don't know much
about them, but we know that they're a good team or they
wouldn't be here."
The Flames received their conference's automatic NCAA
berth with a ninth-inning home run in the Horizon League
championship game and have gone 37-7 after a miserable 2-9
start to the season. Fven with a team .331 batting average, UlC's
strength is a pitching staff that posted a 3.09 FRA in 2003 and al
lowed just two walks in its four conference tournament games.
Tonight UIC will throw either sophomore lefty Ryan
Gehring (8-4, 2.34 FRA) or freshman Ryan Martin (7-0, 2.01)
against surprise Cardinal starter Ryan McCally (5-2, 5.35).
In a move clearly not in concert with his usual conservative

style, Marquess will roll the dice and hold back his top two
starters —junior John Hudgins (9-3, 3.14) and freshman Mark
Romanczuk (10-0, 3.45) — in hopes of stealing a game early in
the tournament to set his team up for later in the weekend.
"Looking at the way the tournament unfolds, we think that
this is a good matchup," the Stanford skipper said. "[McCally] is
also very durable ... so he gives me a lot more flexibility, which
you might need in a four-team regional."
McCally started for much of the year, but struggled in March
and April and was relinquished to the bullpen. Tonight will
mark bis first start in over a month, putting Marquess on the line
fora controversial decision that could either pay off big or come
back to haunt the Cardinal.
"I don't think it's a case of overlooking [UICV Marquess said.

Freshman Chris Lewis and the Stanford baseball team will be focused this weekend as the open
ing weekend of the 2003 NCAA Baseball Championships kicks off at Sunken Diamond.
"McCally and [senior Tim] Cun
ningham are going to have to start
this weekend, and we felt that this
would be the best possible match
up to do this.
"Do 1 know for sure? No, but it
really just gets down to how you
perform."

Marquess's senior right-hander
will replace ace Hudgins, who
named the Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Year earlier this week.
The junior right-hander bat
tled fatigue late in the year but re
gained his form in his last two
starts and enters the tournament
112 resh alter throwing only 64 pitch
es a week ago in a win over Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo.
Both Gehring and Martin ex
celled all season for the Flames, but

their outstanding numbers came
against a schedule not even ranked
in the nation's top 200.
Stanford, led offensively by
Pac-10 Co-Player of the Year
Ryan Garko, hopes to conquer
this season's regional in easier
fashion than it did the last two
years.
In 2000 and 2001, losses forced
the Cardinal to face elimination in
a second regional championship
game on Sunday. Last year, Stan
ford needed 13 innings to beat Cal
State-Fullerton in the first game
but then completed a first round
sweep with a pair of wins over
Long Beach State.
Richmond, the Atlantic 10 reg
ular season and postseason
champs, will start junior Tim
Staulfer (9-4, 1.87) in its first game,
allowing the Cardinal to avoid the
projected top five draft pick.
But one of two nine-game win

ners, Mike McGirr (9-1, 2.48) and
Jason Bolinski (9-1, 2.53), will get
the call in the Spiders' second
game and could undoubtedly give
Stanford fits.
If Riverside manages to get past
Staulfer this afternoon and Stan
ford takes care of the Flames
tonight, the Cardinal will instead
take on A.J. Shappi (11-2, 3.14) in
another difficult winner's game to
morrow
The Highlanders hit at a .337
clip this season and recently swept
third-ranked Cal State-Fullerton,
a team that completed a sweep of
its own over the Cardinal early on
this season.
But while numbers may help
preview the story this weekend,
just one number means anything
to the Cardinal beginning today:
five, as in the number of wins need
ed to reach Omaha for, of course,
consecutive year number live.

The Cardinal — the NCAA's No. 6 national seed — won't
overlook anyone after recent experience with another postsea
son first-timer. (Two years ago, Stanford needed a miraculous,
late-inning squeeze play to get by Marist 4-3.)
"Our older players have been around long enough that they
have enough respect for the opponent and the game [not to
overlook any team)," Marquess said. "We don't know much
about them, but we know that they're a good team or they
wouldn't be here."
The Flames received their conference's automatic NCAA
berth with a ninth-inning home run in the Horizon League
championship game and have gone 37-7 after a miserable 2-9
start to the season. Fven with a team .331 batting average, UlC's
strength is a pitching staff that posted a 3.09 FRA in 2003 and al
lowed just two walks in its four conference tournament games.
Tonight UIC will throw either sophomore lefty Ryan
Gehring (8-4, 2.34 FRA) or freshman Ryan Martin (7-0, 2.01)
against surprise Cardinal starter Ryan McCally (5-2, 5.35).
In a move clearly not in concert with his usual conservative

style, Marquess will roll the dice and hold back his top two
starters —junior John Hudgins (9-3, 3.14) and freshman Mark
Romanczuk (10-0, 3.45) — in hopes of stealing a game early in
the tournament to set his team up for later in the weekend.
"Looking at the way the tournament unfolds, we think that
this is a good matchup," the Stanford skipper said. "[McCally] is
also very durable ... so he gives me a lot more flexibility, which
you might need in a four-team regional."
McCally started for much of the year, but struggled in March
and April and was relinquished to the bullpen. Tonight will
mark bis first start in over a month, putting Marquess on the line
fora controversial decision that could either pay off big or come
back to haunt the Cardinal.
"I don't think it's a case of overlooking [UICV Marquess said.

Freshman Chris Lewis and the Stanford baseball team will be focused this weekend as the open
ing weekend of the 2003 NCAA Baseball Championships kicks off at Sunken Diamond.
"McCally and [senior Tim] Cun
ningham are going to have to start
this weekend, and we felt that this
would be the best possible match
up to do this.
"Do 1 know for sure? No, but it
really just gets down to how you
perform."

Marquess's senior right-hander
will replace ace Hudgins, who
named the Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Year earlier this week.
The junior right-hander bat
tled fatigue late in the year but re
gained his form in his last two
starts and enters the tournament
112 resh alter throwing only 64 pitch
es a week ago in a win over Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo.
Both Gehring and Martin ex
celled all season for the Flames, but

their outstanding numbers came
against a schedule not even ranked
in the nation's top 200.
Stanford, led offensively by
Pac-10 Co-Player of the Year
Ryan Garko, hopes to conquer
this season's regional in easier
fashion than it did the last two
years.
In 2000 and 2001, losses forced
the Cardinal to face elimination in
a second regional championship
game on Sunday. Last year, Stan
ford needed 13 innings to beat Cal
State-Fullerton in the first game
but then completed a first round
sweep with a pair of wins over
Long Beach State.
Richmond, the Atlantic 10 reg
ular season and postseason
champs, will start junior Tim
Staulfer (9-4, 1.87) in its first game,
allowing the Cardinal to avoid the
projected top five draft pick.
But one of two nine-game win

ners, Mike McGirr (9-1, 2.48) and
Jason Bolinski (9-1, 2.53), will get
the call in the Spiders' second
game and could undoubtedly give
Stanford fits.
If Riverside manages to get past
Staulfer this afternoon and Stan
ford takes care of the Flames
tonight, the Cardinal will instead
take on A.J. Shappi (11-2, 3.14) in
another difficult winner's game to
morrow
The Highlanders hit at a .337
clip this season and recently swept
third-ranked Cal State-Fullerton,
a team that completed a sweep of
its own over the Cardinal early on
this season.
But while numbers may help
preview the story this weekend,
just one number means anything
to the Cardinal beginning today:
five, as in the number of wins need
ed to reach Omaha for, of course,
consecutive year number live.
Forty-win regular seasons and Pacific-10 Conference cham
pionships are nice, but everyone around the Stanford baseball
program knows that neither of those achievements determines
how an individual year will be remembered.
Head coach Mark Marquess and his staff have raised the bar
so high for the Cardinal that the lone measuring stick of any
value that marks a successful Stanford season is a berth in the
College World Series in Omaha.
And the quest for that ultimate Middle America destination
begins today as play opens in the 2003 NCAA Baseball Champi
onships at the Stanford Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (41-15) begins the second season tonight with a 6
p.m. matchup with the University of Illinois-Chicago (39-16),
while the regional's second and third seeds — Richmond (46-
13) and California-Riverside (40-15) —square off in a 2 p.m.
matinee.
The four-team mini-tournament is one of 16 regionals taking
place across the nation this weekend, and the team that emerges
from three days of double-elimination baseball will advance to
the best-of-three Super Regional round next weekend to face
the winner of the regional hosted by Long Beach State.
