# Baseball opens NCAA regionals
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forty-win regular seasons and Pacific-10 Conference cham
pionships are nice, but everyone around the Stanford baseball
program knows that neither of those achievements determines
how an individual year will be remembered.
Head coach Mark Marquess and his staff have raised the bar
so high for the Cardinal that the lone measuring stick of any
value that marks a successful Stanford season is a berth in the
College World Series in Omaha.
And the quest for that ultimate Middle America destination
begins today as play opens in the 2003 NCAA Baseball Champi
onships at the Stanford Regional at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (41-15) begins the second season tonight with a 6
p.m. matchup with the University of Illinois-Chicago (39-16),
while the regional's second and third seeds — Richmond (46-
13) and California-Riverside (40-15) —square off in a 2 p.m.
matinee.
The four-team mini-tournament is one of 16 regionals taking
place across the nation this weekend, and the team that emerges
from three days of double-elimination baseball will advance to
the best-of-three Super Regional round next weekend to face
the winner of the regional hosted by Long Beach State.
The Cardinal — the NCAA's No. 6 national seed — won't
overlook anyone after recent experience with another postsea
son first-timer. (Two years ago, Stanford needed a miraculous,
late-inning squeeze play to get by Marist 4-3.)
"Our older players have been around long enough that they
have enough respect for the opponent and the game [not to
overlook any team)," Marquess said. "We don't know much
about them, but we know that they're a good team or they
wouldn't be here."
The Flames received their conference's automatic NCAA
berth with a ninth-inning home run in the Horizon League
championship game and have gone 37-7 after a miserable 2-9
start to the season. Fven with a team .331 batting average, UlC's
strength is a pitching staff that posted a 3.09 FRA in 2003 and al
lowed just two walks in its four conference tournament games.
Tonight UIC will throw either sophomore lefty Ryan
Gehring (8-4, 2.34 FRA) or freshman Ryan Martin (7-0, 2.01)
against surprise Cardinal starter Ryan McCally (5-2, 5.35).
In a move clearly not in concert with his usual conservative

style, Marquess will roll the dice and hold back his top two
starters —junior John Hudgins (9-3, 3.14) and freshman Mark
Romanczuk (10-0, 3.45) — in hopes of stealing a game early in
the tournament to set his team up for later in the weekend.
"Looking at the way the tournament unfolds, we think that
this is a good matchup," the Stanford skipper said. "[McCally] is
also very durable ... so he gives me a lot more flexibility, which
you might need in a four-team regional."
McCally started for much of the year, but struggled in March
and April and was relinquished to the bullpen. Tonight will
mark bis first start in over a month, putting Marquess on the line
fora controversial decision that could either pay off big or come
back to haunt the Cardinal.
"I don't think it's a case of overlooking [UICV Marquess said.
