# The
						Daily sets up close and personal with Gorgeous Dre
## 
### 
When The Daily was offered the rare
opportunity to interview (me of the world's most
secretive, reclusive 112 igures, horoscopist Gorgeous
Dre, The Daily leapt at the chance. As pei
Gorgeous Die's instructions, The Dady placed a
jUrwer pot on Us balcony and was s/xm rewarded
with a secret meeting.
After being subjected to elaborate security
measures, iruliuhng, InU not limited to, a series
of larger and l/irger head coverings, the SAT II:
Chemistry subject test, a Kubik's cube and a
larger-than-life hedge maze filled with grotesque
and wonderful creatures, The Daily arrived at
Gorgeous Dre's secret hideaway — a well-lit
table m Tressidder.
Gorgeous Dre: So glad you could join our
little ... party. (cackles evilly)
The Daily: I understand you just finished
some horoscopes. Can you (ell us about
(hem?
Gorgeous Dre: Well, our development
team is very excited about these
horoscopes. They'll be appearing in
tomorrow's newspaper, much as they do
every clay, except when Linda C. Black
escapes from her cage.
The Daily: What's spec lal about these?
Gorgeous Dre: Well, I don't want to give
too much away, but one of the main
characters will die. There'll be shocking
revelations about Libra's past. Ami on a
lighter note, Taurus is mistaken lor
Sagittarius, widi hilarious consequences!
The Daily: What about the persistent
rumors that you just make this slull up
and e-mail it to Huetter five minutes
before it's due?
Gorgeous Dre: No comment.
The Daily: You work with 12 zodiac signs,
and I'm sure you love them all, but let s

hear some inside dirt. What goes on
behind the scenes?
Gorgeous Dre: Well, everything was great
at first, but then the money and the fame
really got to Leo. He descended into a
downward spiral of drugs and alcohol. We
had to replace Scorpio after he
spontaneously combusted, and our
producer, Roenick, left due to family
problems. But we still try to make
horoscopes our fans will enjoy. At the end
of the clay, it's all about our music, our
millions of dollars, our legions of fans, and
our youth.
The Daily: Hey, that's just a Simpsons'

reference.
Gorgeous Dre:
What, you think I
actually look at the
stars? Do you think
The Daily would be
able to hire someone
with that kind of
talent? Go to The
M„.., Vorlr if

you want sissy real horoscopes.
The Daily: Do you expect me to
publish that?
Gorgeous Dre: No, Mr. Hie Daily, I
expect you to die.
The Daily: You aren't funny at all.
Gorgeous Dre: Oh yeah? Your mother.
The Daily: Iliat doesn't make any sense.
I'm an inanimate, 8-16 page campus
newspaper. I don't have parents. May Ik- if
I did, I'd lie able to run actual news
content, and embed correspondents, and
run feature stories about babies trapped in
wells, but I just can't. (breaks down sobbing)

Palo Alto Daily News: Now you've gone
and made The Daily cry. You're a horrible
person.
Gorgeous Dre (surrounded by models and
lumgers-<m): Gorgeous Dre apologizes for
Gorgeous Dre's inappropriate remarks.
Gorgeous Dre would like to make it all
better with a free horoscope.
The Daily (sniffling but brightening): Really?
Gorgeous Di e: Gorgeous Dre will spare
no expense to brighten your day, little
newspaper.
The Daily: Gee, thanks! What can you tell
us about [upcoming] Volume '224? What's
my horoscope? By the way, I'm a Pisces.
Gorgeous Dre: Watch out for snakes!
The Daily: I hate you.



Where's your other arm going,
Gorgeous Die? Ha!
