# Panel discusses Iran

### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
A panel comprised of experts on Iran
addressed a packed room in Building 420
last night during "Iran Unraveled: Temp
tations of Tradition and Modernity in
Iran." Sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the four-member panel addressed
internal and external paths toward change
in Iran, a country which has once again en
tered the media spotlight because of U.S.
concerns over terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction.
The format of the event consisted of a
lecture session, during which the panel ad
dressed the audience, followed by a ques
tion-and-answer period facilitated by event
coordinator Lily Sarafan, a co-terminal stu
dent in management science and engi
neering.
Abbas Milani, a Hoover fellow and pro
fessor and chair of the department of histo
ry and political science at Notre Dame Uni
versity, talked about modernity in Iran. Ar
guably the most important challenge in
Iran, modernity is the rise of individual
rights, according to Milani.
"Religious fundamentalism, [looked
upon] as a historical phenomena, is a reac
tion to modernity," he said. "[Fundamen
talists] are people that do not welcome
modernity."
Milani said that there are those who
would argue that if Iran wants to become
modern, it has to emulate the West. Those
arguing against women's rights in Iran, a
topic which is prominent in talks related to
modernity, argue it is a Western idea.
"Modernity really has nothing to do
with the West," he said. "It can come to
Iran completely independent of Western
influence."
Opponents of modernity argue that it
will signal an end to religion. Milani spoke
against this notion, putting common
thought into a historical context.
"Modernity does not mean an end to re
ligion," he said. "One of he best examples is
the United States . . . Modernity is not an
enemy of religion."

Prof. Behnam Tabrizi subsequently ad
dressed the democratization movement in
Iran. Tabrizi described a recent poll in
Iran, in which nearly 92 percent of voters
were in favor of the version of the Iranian
constitution which had no religious ideals.
According to Tabrizi, social and political
change in Iran will start at the student level.
"The students are the vanguard of the
democratization movement in society," he
said.
Since Mohammad Khatami became
president of Iran, domestic conservative
support has dropped from 30 percent to
less than 10 percent of the population,
Tabrizi said, adding that it is imperative
that the West allow democracy in Iran to
prevail on its own.
"There are actions by the U.S. that will
seriously harm the homegrown democrati
zation movement in Iran," Tabrizi said.
"Close ties with any of the [Iranian] groups,

including the conservatives, goes against
the wishes of the Iranian people . .. Mili
tary attacks would be counterproductive
for the democratic movement."
Iran's former ambassador to the United
Nations, Fereydoun Hoveyda, spoke on
foreign policy and how it relates to Iran
and the United States.
"We are living on this planet, but we are
not contemporary," he said. "There are
some nations that are living in prehistoric
times — the U.S. is far ahead in the 21st
century in the domain of technology and
scientific achievements."
Hoveyda argued that if Iran had com
bined its 1978 material advances with polit
ical reforms, it would have been better off
today. He further added that the Iranian
revolution was a major setback to moderni
ty-
"Because of what happened in 1979, we
were reverted [back] to the 19305." He sub
sequently addressed globalization and Iran
emerging into the world market.
"[Globalization] has been steadily grow
ing," he said. "Even China wants to join the
global market."
Hoveyda spoke of Iran's stance in the
Middle East.
"The Iranian political programs are dif
ferent from those of the Arabs," he said.
"Iran continues to work for its own nation
al interests."
Addressing modernity from the peo
ple's standpoint, he argued that the major
ity of Iranians are afraid of change.
"It seems that the Iranians are trapped
in the closed circles of their rich, ancient
culture," he said.
Hoveyda agreed with Tabrizi in arguing
that the essence of democracy must stem
from the people.
"We should create our own version of
democracy based on our own culture," he
said.
Despite the fact that "many Iranians in
side and outside of the country look toward
America to get rid of the Islamic theocra
cy," Hoveyda said, "reforming Iran is an
Iranian problem that should be dealt with
Iranians themselves."
Speaking on Iran-U.S. relations, Hov
eyda said, "Iranians are usually critical of
the United States foreign policy."
Hoveyda suggested that the United
States should back democratic elements in
all nations, including Iran. Many American
businessmen, he said, advise the United
States to engage the mullahs, or religious
clergy, though this is easier said than done.
"American don't understand that the
mullahs are medieval-minded and extrem
ists," he added. "[Modernity] is a modern
concept, not a medieval one."
The final member of the panel, Trita
Parsi, the president of the National Iranian
American Council and a doctoral candidate
at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Inter
national Studies, spoke of Iranian Americans
and the unification of their voice in society.
"It is a mystery how Iranians are so suc
cessful at business, engineering ... acade
mia — it's unclear how we are not present
on the political map," he said. "We are often

opinionated, but we don't know where to
start — for more than 20 years, we have not
participated in [United States] democracy
to the extent that we should have."
Passage of the Visa Entry Reform Act was
an example of this lack of unity, Parsi said.
"The visa restriction passed without a
single vote against it," Parsi said.
Parsi indicated that the Iranians in the
United States have a lot to learn from the
Jewish-American community. "We can
learn from their diversity."
The NIAC Web site serves as a forum to
bring together Iranian-American thought.
People can use the site to communicate
with their lawmakers.
"Our community is far more united
than what had previously been conceived,"
he said.
Parsi indicated that more than 80 per
cent of NIAC members favor a polity that
does not formally exclude communication
between Iran and the United States.
Sarafan subsequently directed questions
from the audience to the panelists.
Hoveyda responded to an audience
member's question regarding principles of
democracy and how they relate to Iran.
"In Iran, the bulk of the masses don't
understand what we mean by democracy,"
he said. "People don't understand in Iran
what we mean by constitutional monarchy,
so we have to take this into account, but the
principles of democracy are the same."

A member of the audience asked how an
individual with an F1 visa can take part in
American politics.
"You are actually looking at an Iranian
with an F1 visa," Parsi said. "I found in Amer
ican avenues to take part in government."
"How does modern Iran have to deal
with the West?" asked another member of
the audience.
"Modernity is not only suited to the cli
mate of the West," Milani replied. "Iran
tried these democratic ideas long before
they were formulated in the West. I think
soon Iran will have a democratic, secular
government, where people are sovereign
and have no masters."
This new government, Milani said, will
enable women to have equal rights as
men and grant all faiths equal protection
under the law.
An audience member asked Hoveyda to
predict a U.S. response toward Iran.
"If Iranians want to be like [the]
French — anti-American — the future will
be very bad for Iran," he said. "I think that
Americans have no aggressive [plans] con
cerning Iran.
Hoveyda added that an issue, apart
from the United States' response, is how to
bring Iran back into the international com
munity.
He said, "We [will] bring Iran back into
the international community by stopping
the help to the mullahs who are in power."

Passage of the Visa Entry Reform Act was
an example of this lack of unity, Parsi said.
"The visa restriction passed without a
single vote against it," Parsi said.
Parsi indicated that the Iranians in the
United States have a lot to learn from the
Jewish-American community. "We can
learn from their diversity."
The NIAC Web site serves as a forum to
bring together Iranian-American thought.
People can use the site to communicate
with their lawmakers.
"Our community is far more united
than what had previously been conceived,"
he said.
Parsi indicated that more than 80 per
cent of NIAC members favor a polity that
does not formally exclude communication
between Iran and the United States.
Sarafan subsequently directed questions
from the audience to the panelists.
Hoveyda responded to an audience
member's question regarding principles of
democracy and how they relate to Iran.
"In Iran, the bulk of the masses don't
understand what we mean by democracy,"
he said. "People don't understand in Iran
what we mean by constitutional monarchy,
so we have to take this into account, but the
principles of democracy are the same."

A member of the audience asked how an
individual with an F1 visa can take part in
American politics.
"You are actually looking at an Iranian
with an F1 visa," Parsi said. "I found in Amer
ican avenues to take part in government."
"How does modern Iran have to deal
with the West?" asked another member of
the audience.
"Modernity is not only suited to the cli
mate of the West," Milani replied. "Iran
tried these democratic ideas long before
they were formulated in the West. I think
soon Iran will have a democratic, secular
government, where people are sovereign
and have no masters."
This new government, Milani said, will
enable women to have equal rights as
men and grant all faiths equal protection
under the law.
An audience member asked Hoveyda to
predict a U.S. response toward Iran.
"If Iranians want to be like [the]
French — anti-American — the future will
be very bad for Iran," he said. "I think that
Americans have no aggressive [plans] con
cerning Iran.
Hoveyda added that an issue, apart
from the United States' response, is how to
bring Iran back into the international com
munity.
He said, "We [will] bring Iran back into
the international community by stopping
the help to the mullahs who are in power."

Experts discuss issues and questions concerning Iran at a panel discussion held last night in
Building 420. The event was titled "Iran Unraveled: Temptations of Tradition and Modernity in
Iran" and was sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
A panel comprised of experts on Iran
addressed a packed room in Building 420
last night during "Iran Unraveled: Temp
tations of Tradition and Modernity in
Iran." Sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the four-member panel addressed
internal and external paths toward change
in Iran, a country which has once again en
tered the media spotlight because of U.S.
concerns over terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction.
The format of the event consisted of a
lecture session, during which the panel ad
dressed the audience, followed by a ques
tion-and-answer period facilitated by event
coordinator Lily Sarafan, a co-terminal stu
dent in management science and engi
neering.
Abbas Milani, a Hoover fellow and pro
fessor and chair of the department of histo
ry and political science at Notre Dame Uni
versity, talked about modernity in Iran. Ar
guably the most important challenge in
Iran, modernity is the rise of individual
rights, according to Milani.
"Religious fundamentalism, [looked
upon] as a historical phenomena, is a reac
tion to modernity," he said. "[Fundamen
talists] are people that do not welcome
modernity."
Milani said that there are those who
would argue that if Iran wants to become
modern, it has to emulate the West. Those
arguing against women's rights in Iran, a
topic which is prominent in talks related to
modernity, argue it is a Western idea.
"Modernity really has nothing to do
with the West," he said. "It can come to
Iran completely independent of Western
influence."
Opponents of modernity argue that it
will signal an end to religion. Milani spoke
against this notion, putting common
thought into a historical context.
"Modernity does not mean an end to re
ligion," he said. "One of he best examples is
the United States . . . Modernity is not an
enemy of religion."
Management Science and Engineering
Prof. Behnam Tabrizi subsequently ad
dressed the democratization movement in
Iran. Tabrizi described a recent poll in
Iran, in which nearly 92 percent of voters
were in favor of the version of the Iranian
constitution which had no religious ideals.
According to Tabrizi, social and political
change in Iran will start at the student level.
"The students are the vanguard of the
democratization movement in society," he
said.
Since Mohammad Khatami became
president of Iran, domestic conservative
support has dropped from 30 percent to
less than 10 percent of the population,
Tabrizi said, adding that it is imperative
that the West allow democracy in Iran to
prevail on its own.
"There are actions by the U.S. that will
seriously harm the homegrown democrati
zation movement in Iran," Tabrizi said.
"Close ties with any of the [Iranian] groups,

including the conservatives, goes against
the wishes of the Iranian people . .. Mili
tary attacks would be counterproductive
for the democratic movement."
Iran's former ambassador to the United
Nations, Fereydoun Hoveyda, spoke on
foreign policy and how it relates to Iran
and the United States.
"We are living on this planet, but we are
not contemporary," he said. "There are
some nations that are living in prehistoric
times — the U.S. is far ahead in the 21st
century in the domain of technology and
scientific achievements."
Hoveyda argued that if Iran had com
bined its 1978 material advances with polit
ical reforms, it would have been better off
today. He further added that the Iranian
revolution was a major setback to moderni
ty-
"Because of what happened in 1979, we
were reverted [back] to the 19305." He sub
sequently addressed globalization and Iran
emerging into the world market.
"[Globalization] has been steadily grow
ing," he said. "Even China wants to join the
global market."
Hoveyda spoke of Iran's stance in the
Middle East.
"The Iranian political programs are dif
ferent from those of the Arabs," he said.
"Iran continues to work for its own nation
al interests."
Addressing modernity from the peo
ple's standpoint, he argued that the major
ity of Iranians are afraid of change.
"It seems that the Iranians are trapped
in the closed circles of their rich, ancient
culture," he said.
Hoveyda agreed with Tabrizi in arguing
that the essence of democracy must stem
from the people.
"We should create our own version of
democracy based on our own culture," he
said.
Despite the fact that "many Iranians in
side and outside of the country look toward
America to get rid of the Islamic theocra
cy," Hoveyda said, "reforming Iran is an
Iranian problem that should be dealt with
Iranians themselves."
Speaking on Iran-U.S. relations, Hov
eyda said, "Iranians are usually critical of
the United States foreign policy."
Hoveyda suggested that the United
States should back democratic elements in
all nations, including Iran. Many American
businessmen, he said, advise the United
States to engage the mullahs, or religious
clergy, though this is easier said than done.
"American don't understand that the
mullahs are medieval-minded and extrem
ists," he added. "[Modernity] is a modern
concept, not a medieval one."
The final member of the panel, Trita
Parsi, the president of the National Iranian
American Council and a doctoral candidate
at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Inter
national Studies, spoke of Iranian Americans
and the unification of their voice in society.
"It is a mystery how Iranians are so suc
cessful at business, engineering ... acade
mia — it's unclear how we are not present
on the political map," he said. "We are often

opinionated, but we don't know where to
start — for more than 20 years, we have not
participated in [United States] democracy
to the extent that we should have."
Passage of the Visa Entry Reform Act was
an example of this lack of unity, Parsi said.
"The visa restriction passed without a
single vote against it," Parsi said.
Parsi indicated that the Iranians in the
United States have a lot to learn from the
Jewish-American community. "We can
