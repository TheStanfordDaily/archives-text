# 'Nemo' is served up tastefully

The animators and whiz
kids at Pixar Animation Stu
dios pride themselves on
thinking up wholly original
stories for their computer-an
imated movies. The "Toy
Story" films, as well as "A
Bug's Life" and "Monsters
Inc." all have original charac
ters and storylines, which chil-

dren and adults alike have come to
adore. So the tradition continues with
Pixar's fifth and latest film, "Finding
Nemo," an underwater adventure set in
the Great Barrier Reef.
The film's plot is based on the fortunes
of two fish, Marlin and Dorry, who set out
to find Martin's only son, Nemo, who is
captured and ends up in a fish tank in a
dentist's office overlooking Sydney Har
bor. Marlin, a nervous clown fish single
parent, is voiced by Albert Brooks, who
co-stars in"The In-Laws," which was re
leased last week. Marlin is nothing like
Dorry, an ever-optimistic but terribly for
getful blue tang, voiced by Ellen De-
Generes.
In his new glass-walled home, Nemo
soon gets acquainted with an eclectic col
lection of tank mates, led by Gill (Willem
Dafoe). Gill, a moorish idol who has been
in a few scrapes, dreams of escaping to the

ocean.
As Nemo and his fellow in
mates formulate an escape

plan, Marlin and Dorry
make the long swim to Syd
ney, facing almost every
challenge the ocean can
pose along the way, includ
ing a trio of self-help-seek
ing sharks, a whale and a
forest of jellyfish. Time is
running out for Nemo,

however, as he is set to become a gift for
the dentist's niece Darla, whose fish tend
to end up "riding the porcelain express"
— fish-speak for being flushed down the
toilet.
"Finding Nemo" is a visually beautiful
movie. It is most similar in looks to Pixar's
1998 movie "A Bug's Life," with translu
cent grass flowing in the wind replaced by
sea life that moves to the currents of the
water. The likeness is no coincidence —
Andrew Stanton, who directed "Finding
Nemo," was co-director of "A Bug's Life."
The animated ocean waves and the water
backdrop, typically highly complicated to
replicate on a computer, are superbly
done. The movie is also one of Pixar's first
to recreate an actual place— Sydney
Harbor — on computer.
Compared with the likes of "Toy
Story 2," which is action-packed from
start to finish, there are quieter scenes

in "Finding Nemo," and the soundtrack
is all instrumental. Except for the final
credits song, there's nothing like the
"You've Got a Friend in Me" numbers
of "Toy Story."
But like its predecessors, the film's
humor works on all levels, from the Aus
tralian therapy-seeking sharks to burping
blowfish. And there's the deeper theme of

a single father's fears of life that impede
his ability to take care of his son.
You could argue forever about how
"Finding Nemo" compares with Pixar's
previous films. But it's safe to say that it's
definitely in the same league. "Finding
Nemo" is smart, funny and poignant.
And it might just make you think twice the
next time you see a tank full of fish.



Ever notice how scary sharks look, even when they're smiling?
