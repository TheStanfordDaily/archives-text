# We Players' 'Jabberwocky' is a must-see
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
When Ava Roy arrived at
Stanford as a freshman she real
ized that she would be spending
the next four years of her life at a
country club. But instead of sit
ting on her freshman bottom ad
miring and complaining about
the palm trees like the rest of us,
she picked herself up and decid
ed to make the most of this, her
campus playground. Like most
freshmen, she also noticed Stan
ford's distinct lack of perfor
mance community — unlike
most freshmen, it gave her the
incentive to form and nurture
her own: a collective, later chris
tened We Players.
A large family of friends, ad
mirers, musicians, dancers and
artists gathered principally from
the legions of present, past and
future Chi Theta Chi residents,
then extended outwards to any
one who seemed interested. We
Players presents a collected ex
perience of playing and per
forming pieces all over campus
grounds. She describes it as "a
global mobile theatre," that in
tends to "revitalize and expand
the bounded stage by involve
ment, inclusion and saving
YES!"
No creaking stages, no musty
curtains, no rigid seating and no

backstage tucked away from
sight. The entire process is ex
posed for everyone to witness —
more importantly — to encour
age participation. That first
spring, three years ago, she put
on a production of "Romeo and
Juliet," opening at Tresidder,
moving through White Plaza
and ending in the Quad. The
following year We Players
staged the most extraordinary
production of "Hamlet" at Can
tor with four Hamlets and four
Ophelias.

Last year she pulled off'a cam
pus-wide production of
'Twelfth Night," and this year
Roy returns with a personal pro
ject — "Alice in Wonderland"
and "Through the Looking
Glass," which We Players will
perform as "Jabberwocky" on
the Mausoleum grounds four
nights in a row from May 28
until June 1.
Roy's involvement with the
ater began as a teenager.
Glowing up in Lenox, a beauti
ful enclave in the Berkshires,

famous for housing the Tangle
wood Festival and various
other cultural institutions, she
was introduced early on to a
local but nationally revered
theatre group called Shake
speare and Company. The
company's director quickly be
came her mentor. Annually,
the company puts together a
fall festival that brings together
students from nine surround
ing schools to perform Shake
speare outdoors. In her first
performance Roy was immedi
ately cast as Juliet, in her sec
ond she played Olivia, then Ti
tania and finally Henry V.
During the same year, Roy di
rected her first play, albeit in
doors on a school stage, called
"Ecila." An abstracted version of
"Alice in Wonderland," it was set
in a mental institution and fea
tured Roy's best friend Jonathan
in the leading role. A vital mem
ber of We Players, she travels far
to join the productions — two
years ago she played one of the
Ophelias, and this year she re
turns as "Jabberwocky" 's de
lightful Alice.
"Jabberwocky" is an elabo
rate production spread
around the enchanted woods
near the Mausoleum, focusing
playfully on Lewis Carroll's
themes of logic and language.

Pockets of familiar characters
are distributed in an enormous
chess-board configuration
across Wonderland: a lithe and
spectacular Humpty-Dumpty
outperforming any Olympic
gymnast on his high wall, a
pair of frighteninglv wonder
ful Tweedles, a filthy rock 'n'
roll sort of tea party, a delicious
Cheshire cat played by the di
rector herself, various royalty,
a raucous croquet match com
plete with flamingos which is
followed by a charmingly mud
dled companion who will
guide Alice to her final exami
nation. As the title suggests,
however, the driving force be
hind everything is the jabber
wocky. A red unitard-sporting
group of nine acrobats, who
transform the landscape with
their physical arrangements,
not only support but define the
piece with their unfathomable
work.
Roy's four years at Stanford
are drawing to a close, and she
takes the ever-expanding We
Players, whose members are
dotted around the world, with
her. This will be the group's last
performance at Stanford, so if
you have been foolish enough
to miss any in the past, take the
opportunity to participate this
time.


"Jabberwocky" lends a new perspective to the traditional "Alice in
Wonderland" tale.
