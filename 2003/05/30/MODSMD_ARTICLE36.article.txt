# 'Job' not so well done
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
Last week it was announced, with due
fanfare, that Mark Wahlberg considered
"The Italian Job" his best work to date. Re
flecting on a career as illustrious as one
which combines monkeys, porn and boats,
it must not have been easy to make such
bold statements.
The "Italian Job" confirms Wahlberg's
attachment to the tried and tested com
forts of routine. Time is money, and ac
tors kept busy by their nutritionists, pub
licists, therapists and life coaches know
this better than most. There is no longer
time for the old-fashioned extravagance
of character preparation and develop
ment, let alone original work. Exact blue
prints are required. If something has

worked before it will surely work again,
and Wahlberg believes this as though it
were his mantra. "The Italian Job" is his
third remake of the last two years. Nei
ther does he find himself hampered by
the fact that his forebearers Charlton He
ston, Cary Grant and Michael Caine
share absolutely nothing in common, nor
is he remotely concerned with their un
touchable legendary status. A simple
method was implemented to deal with
any problem: In "Planet of the Apes" he
plays Harrison Ford in a space-suit; in
"The Truth About Charlie" he plays Har
rison Ford with a baguette wedged under
his bicep, and in"The Italian Job" he
plays Harrison Ford in a small zippy car:
determined, slightly confused and wood
en. But where Ford's permanently fur

rowed brow was at the very least amus
ing, Wahlberg lacks the emotional apti
tude and charm to conjure up any level
of attachment to his characters.
Released in 1969, "The Italian Job" was
a moderately exciting British caper star
ring Michael Caine as an ex-con who is
suckered by crime boss Noel Coward into
capturing four million quid's worth ol
gold bullion during rush hour in Turin
(that's in Italy, my friends). The film fea
tured the requisite band of colorful char
acters that help him pull of the heist, fabu
lous clothes, serious Anglomania and
some good car chases. More importantly it
was also the film that elevated the Mini-
Cooper to cult level.
This remake takes more liberties with
the original material than either "Char
lie" or "Apes." The movie has been tai
lored to suit modern attention spans and
audience expectations, which means the
film has been reduced to a 102-minute
car ad. The polished little Minis zoom all
over the place, white and blue they come
flying out of tunnels, defy gravity as they
perfunctorily race around empty reser
voirs, zip down the sidewalk, through
subways and into shopping malls, light
bouncing off their miniature bonnets into
millions of special little pieces of gold. It's
the kind of car that would have spared the
Blues Brothers a lot of trouble. During
the elaborately planned heist scenes the
film becomes rather fun — with the bene
fit of modern editing they are almost grip
ping, but the air is dead: Everything feels
enormously derivative. Not only of the
original, but of recent films that pulled off
comparable material with far more
panache. Wahlberg and his equally un
spectacular love interest Charlize Theron

just don't cut it.
The reason
for Wahlberg's
effusion was
that lie and his
co-stars had
made a charac
ter-driven piece
with well
rounded char-

acters. But this ensemble of heist collabo
rators, as good as some of them are (espe
cially the terminally hilarious Seth Green)
are not given much of an opportunity to
develop anything except for their nifty
heist gadgets. Despite ample amounts of
screen-time, they remain poorly elaborat
ed stereotypes — the Backstreet Boys of
robbery, not the 11 dapper gentlemen of
the recent "Ocean's Eleven," who had no
need to resort to this painfully rote humor
in order to engage their audience.
At least someone agrees with me
about this film. Before Marky Mark's
delusions grabbed the headlines, gossip
columnists were falling over themselves
to report Edward Norton's squabbles
with the film's studio, Paramount,
whom, by contract, he owed one last film.
Upon being delivered a brand new Mini,
he sent it back with a note attached:
"Why don't you send this to someone
you like — or someone who likes you."
He plays Wahlberg's nemesis as though
he could care less: full of wry hyperbole
and delightful cliche.
If you'd like to see Minis scooting
around places where they shouldn't be,
I suggest watching the original, if only
to catch sight of the brilliant Noel Cow
ard and what used to be considered real
acting.

with well
rounded char-

acters. But this ensemble of heist collabo
rators, as good as some of them are (espe
cially the terminally hilarious Seth Green)
are not given much of an opportunity to
develop anything except for their nifty
heist gadgets. Despite ample amounts of
screen-time, they remain poorly elaborat
ed stereotypes — the Backstreet Boys of
robbery, not the 11 dapper gentlemen of
the recent "Ocean's Eleven," who had no
need to resort to this painfully rote humor
in order to engage their audience.
At least someone agrees with me
about this film. Before Marky Mark's
delusions grabbed the headlines, gossip
columnists were falling over themselves
to report Edward Norton's squabbles
with the film's studio, Paramount,
whom, by contract, he owed one last film.
Upon being delivered a brand new Mini,
he sent it back with a note attached:
"Why don't you send this to someone
you like — or someone who likes you."
He plays Wahlberg's nemesis as though
he could care less: full of wry hyperbole
and delightful cliche.
If you'd like to see Minis scooting
around places where they shouldn't be,
I suggest watching the original, if only
to catch sight of the brilliant Noel Cow
ard and what used to be considered real
acting.


"You're sooo not all that, Marky Mark."
