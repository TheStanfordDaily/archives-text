# Seth Green is ready to grow up
## 
### ED SCOTT 
Famous for great roles like Oz on
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and Scott
Evil in the "Austin Powers" movies, Seth
Green is an indelible part of Generation
X's popular culture. Now he's moving
on to other projects, hoping his fans will
follow.
On tour to promote "The Italianjob," a
caper remake opening today and also star
ring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton and
Charlize Theron, Green took some time to
sit down with Intermission to discuss his
new movie, Rabbinic violence, marriage
and ping-pong.
Intermission: You've become known for
your roles in comedy and teen films. Do
you find yourself being drawn to more se
rious adult roles now that you're older?
Seth Green: I don't think it's realistic to
keep playing a teenager once you turn 30,
which is about a year away for me. I get
drawn to the things that attract me, same as
anyone else I guess. I read something and
if it makes sense to me, if I feel like I could
portray it accurately, or I feel it would be
some kind of challenge — those are the
kinds of things I get drawn to. I'm not
specifically seeking out a genre or a type of
role.
INT: What would you really like to see
yourself do in the next five years? Do you
have any specific goals or things that you
really want to do?
SG: Yes, I'd like to keep working. I'm a
big fan of that. I like finding scripts that
make me want to work on them. I don't
have any like amazing ... I don't want

to play the crippled gay guy that climbs
Mount Baldie. I don't have any specifics.
1 read things and they make sense to me
and I wait for something to get excited
about.
INT: You've worked with a lot of good en
semble casts. How does the cast in your
new film, "The Italian Job," compare?
SG: Oh my gosh, we had a great cast. It was
one of those things that I get so excited any
time I read the list to anybody. They would
say, "Who's in the movie?" and I would get
to rattle off this ridiculous list of people. It's
a blast. I think any ensemble movie is real
ly, obviously made up of the sum of its
parts. It's super important that you get a
good group together. We were really for
tunate with this group.
INT: C "an you describe how the collabora
tion process worked on "The Italian Job"
and what you brought to the set?
SG: Yes, we had really good elements all
around. All the people involved are
strong actors and everybody is very cre
ative on set. Gary Gray allowed us a lot of
improvisation. We didn't stray too far
from the script, but you could really feel
that everybody was present. It was a
bunch of pros.
INT: As Mark Wahlberg's character or
chestrates increasingly complicated
schemes to get revenge on Edward Nor
ton, did you ever feel like you were back in
"Austin Powers?" As in, "Why don't we just
shoot him. I got a gun in my room. Let's
just shoot him?"
SG: That would work, except he's so diffi
cult to get to. There never really was a
sniper opportunity. No, that's funny, I ac
tually never even thought of that. Yes,
that's a funny correlation.

INT: Did you ever get to drive one of those
souped-up Mini Coopers?
SG: I did. I was on the same track when
they were racing the cars. I got to do 180-
degree turns and emergency brakes spins.
I mean, it was awesome. I highly recom
mend it if you ever get the opportunity. I
also had to learn how to drive that motor
cycle for the beginning of the movie.
INT: Did you actually learn? It looked like
you had some trouble ...
SG: Yes. Well that's the worst thing about
it was I put in two weeks of learning how to
drive this 700-pound Ducati motorcycle,

and we get to set, and they want me to bang
it around. I was like, you know what, why
don't you let the stunt guy do that?
INT: Woody Allen's "Radio Days," that's
one of my favorites. I'll never forget that
scene where you get beat up by the Rabbi.
SG: Yes, I got the shit beat out of me for
real.
INT: Really?
SG: Oh yeah, it was intense. Ken Mars,
who played the Rabbi, was wearing prop
glasses that nobody had outfitted with his
actual prescription. He had about a 10-foot
lack of depth perception. Every time he
thought that I was a certain amount of dis
tance away, I was actually much closer. It
was brutal. That was a brutal scene.
INT: My sister is getting married next
summer. What do you think of marriage?
SG: I'm an absolute advocate of marriage.
I firmly believe in it. I also believe that you
should get married and stay there. That's
my sense on that.
INT: I won't tell that to my sister, because
she is so in love with you, and I don't want
her fiance to get jealous. I'm going to tell
her that you were a real bastard.
SG: Yes, tell her I'm a cock.
INT: What do you do in your spare time?
SG: All of my activities are so pedestrian.
INT: Any extreme sports?
SG: The most extreme sport I play is ping
pong. Let me just tell you, we play ping
pong hardcore. I've been reading in inter
views lately that people are playing ping
pong, and all I'm saying is that if any of you
suckers what to step to the table, you better
bring your heat.

parts. It's super important that you get a
good group together. We were really for
tunate with this group.
INT: C "an you describe how the collabora
tion process worked on "The Italian Job"
and what you brought to the set?
SG: Yes, we had really good elements all
around. All the people involved are
strong actors and everybody is very cre
ative on set. Gary Gray allowed us a lot of
improvisation. We didn't stray too far
from the script, but you could really feel
that everybody was present. It was a
bunch of pros.
INT: As Mark Wahlberg's character or
chestrates increasingly complicated
schemes to get revenge on Edward Nor
ton, did you ever feel like you were back in
"Austin Powers?" As in, "Why don't we just
shoot him. I got a gun in my room. Let's
just shoot him?"
SG: That would work, except he's so diffi
cult to get to. There never really was a
sniper opportunity. No, that's funny, I ac
tually never even thought of that. Yes,
that's a funny correlation.

INT: Did you ever get to drive one of those
souped-up Mini Coopers?
SG: I did. I was on the same track when
they were racing the cars. I got to do 180-
degree turns and emergency brakes spins.
I mean, it was awesome. I highly recom
mend it if you ever get the opportunity. I
also had to learn how to drive that motor
cycle for the beginning of the movie.
INT: Did you actually learn? It looked like
you had some trouble ...
SG: Yes. Well that's the worst thing about
it was I put in two weeks of learning how to
drive this 700-pound Ducati motorcycle,

and we get to set, and they want me to bang
it around. I was like, you know what, why
don't you let the stunt guy do that?
INT: Woody Allen's "Radio Days," that's
one of my favorites. I'll never forget that
scene where you get beat up by the Rabbi.
SG: Yes, I got the shit beat out of me for
real.
INT: Really?
SG: Oh yeah, it was intense. Ken Mars,
who played the Rabbi, was wearing prop
glasses that nobody had outfitted with his
actual prescription. He had about a 10-foot
lack of depth perception. Every time he
thought that I was a certain amount of dis
tance away, I was actually much closer. It
was brutal. That was a brutal scene.
INT: My sister is getting married next
summer. What do you think of marriage?
SG: I'm an absolute advocate of marriage.
I firmly believe in it. I also believe that you
should get married and stay there. That's
my sense on that.
INT: I won't tell that to my sister, because
she is so in love with you, and I don't want
her fiance to get jealous. I'm going to tell
her that you were a real bastard.
SG: Yes, tell her I'm a cock.
INT: What do you do in your spare time?
SG: All of my activities are so pedestrian.
INT: Any extreme sports?
SG: The most extreme sport I play is ping
pong. Let me just tell you, we play ping
pong hardcore. I've been reading in inter
views lately that people are playing ping
pong, and all I'm saying is that if any of you
suckers what to step to the table, you better
bring your heat.


Seth Green in"The Italian Job."


We get the feeling he's holding back a laugh
Famous for great roles like Oz on
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and Scott
Evil in the "Austin Powers" movies, Seth
Green is an indelible part of Generation
X's popular culture. Now he's moving
on to other projects, hoping his fans will
follow.
On tour to promote "The Italianjob," a
caper remake opening today and also star
ring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton and
Charlize Theron, Green took some time to
sit down with Intermission to discuss his
new movie, Rabbinic violence, marriage
and ping-pong.
Intermission: You've become known for
your roles in comedy and teen films. Do
you find yourself being drawn to more se
rious adult roles now that you're older?
Seth Green: I don't think it's realistic to
keep playing a teenager once you turn 30,
which is about a year away for me. I get
drawn to the things that attract me, same as
anyone else I guess. I read something and
if it makes sense to me, if I feel like I could
portray it accurately, or I feel it would be
some kind of challenge — those are the
kinds of things I get drawn to. I'm not
specifically seeking out a genre or a type of
role.
INT: What would you really like to see
yourself do in the next five years? Do you
have any specific goals or things that you
really want to do?
SG: Yes, I'd like to keep working. I'm a
big fan of that. I like finding scripts that
make me want to work on them. I don't
have any like amazing ... I don't want

to play the crippled gay guy that climbs
Mount Baldie. I don't have any specifics.
1 read things and they make sense to me
and I wait for something to get excited
about.
INT: You've worked with a lot of good en
semble casts. How does the cast in your
new film, "The Italian Job," compare?
SG: Oh my gosh, we had a great cast. It was
one of those things that I get so excited any
time I read the list to anybody. They would
say, "Who's in the movie?" and I would get
to rattle off this ridiculous list of people. It's
a blast. I think any ensemble movie is real
ly, obviously made up of the sum of its
parts. It's super important that you get a
good group together. We were really for
