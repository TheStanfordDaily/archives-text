# Intermission infiltrates the SF Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention
## 
### ANTHONY HA ALICE KIM 
Inform the Vulcans we are about to make a
very loud noise.
— Capt. Archer, "Star Trek Enterprise"
I A■ Me were driving through the parking lot of San Jose's
I mm m Doubletree Hotel when Alice grabbed Anthony's arm
KM and started shrieking, "Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"What? I'm driving here!"
But then Anthony saw them — two men and two women in full
Klingon attire, complete with long, curly dark hair and bumpy fore
heads. "Holy shit!"
"Anthony, I am SO glad that we came!"
But Anthony was too busy gaping to say anything in return. As
he drove past the Klingons, he gave a small, shy wave. They waved
back cheerfully.
"Me too," he finally squeaked.
Inside the hotel, the 21st Annual San Francisco Bay Regional Sci
ence Fiction and Fantasy Convention was in full swing. It was
like... heaven. Tying in with the convention's theme of "It's About
Time," clocks were strung around the registration desk. Fairies,
jedis, elves and assorted other fantastic creatures wandered by, talk
ing, laughing and pointing to people who had even more elaborate
and oudandish costumes.
A few minutes later, we'd taken care of registration and were now
the proud owners of green convention badges — the key to wan
dering freely through this surreal paradise — and small pins read
ing "The End is Extremely Fucking Nigh," so we headed over to our
first stop: the dealers' room.
It was huge, filled with people and tables and merchandise, but
also stuffy. The distinctive odor of 8.0. wafted through the air, even
though Anthony said he couldn't smell it. Alice could. But even that
did not lessen our enjoyment. Dealers sold things like art, jewelry,
Renaissance-era fetish wear — one stall specializing in corsets also
sold teddy bears cinched and sexed-out in their own mini corsets —
T-shirts, comics, action figures (ranging from characters in Neil
Gaiman's "Sandman" comics to Playmates of the Year) and books.
Oh God, the books. This is where we lost our steely journalistic dis
tance and went insane, pushing over small cape-wearing children to
reach first-editions of Philip K. Dick novels.
"Sweet Jesus, check out this paperback copy of The Man In The
High Casde!'"
"That is SO awesome!"
"But what's with the random cover? I don't remember a giant
disembodied eye, do — son of a BITCH, there's a first edition of
'Nova' for only five bucks!"
However, we soon realized there was much more to be seen
and — after talking to the proprietress of the book stall and being
reassured that they'd still be there later — resolved to come back
later in the day. We walked over to the art gallery, which was guard
ed by a taciturn Asian Boba Fett. Inside, the New .Age hippieness of
the art was overwhelming — unicorns, sexy healer-elf-nymphs with
supernatural breasts popping out of their tunics, crystals, forests —
it went on and on.
"Where are the space battles?" Anthony bitched, and with good
reason. We couldn't find any planetary explosions or alien beasts
wailing on one another or ray guns in this sadly incomplete art
gallery. So we moved on.
It's difficult to work in a group when you're om
nipotent!
—Q, "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
It was time for us to attend our first panel. Since we both harbor
dreams of one day carrying our very own shiny Hugos (writing
awards given at the World Science Fiction Convention) home with
us, we decided to check out "The Top 10 Rookie Writer Mistakes"
and "Yes, I Did Just Have My First Novel Published." The panels
didn't have anyone famous enough to bring our drooling fan-geek

personalities to the surface (with the exception of Cory Doctorow,
whom we'd both recognized and enjoyed), but they were still pret
ty interesting.
The atmosphere was very insider-y and clannish: Panelists made
jokes like, "You know what's a good idea? Send a story with a uni
corn to Analog!" and most of the audience would chuckle heartily.
(See, Analog is a magazine specializing in ... nevermind.)
But not everything was happy and chummy. For one, there was
a man with a damn crying baby in the back at BOTH panels, and he
refused to take the baby out until halfway through the second one;
he just kept cooing and rocking the baby, probably trying to shove
a pacifier into its mouth too. Daddy must have thought it was a little
more important to learn how to sell his sci-fi masterpiece than to
keep his baby happy (and not drive the rest of us nuts).
There were also two balding, middle-aged dudes who started out
by asking mildly belligerent questions and only got worse as the pan
els progressed. Apparendy, neither of them had had much luck
with their science fiction writing careers thus far, and they were
pissed.
Favorite quote (spoken by Doctorow): "Writing science fiction
has all the social and financial potential of Civil War reenactmenfs.
If you don't love it, don't do it."
If it should become necessary to fight, could
you arrange to find some rocks to throw at
them?
—Fliker, "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
After about an hour, we realized that we needed to head back to
the dealers' room if we wanted to buy our books and take some pho
tos before it closed, so we snuck out. Alice restrained herself from
buying Kit Reed's "Attack of the Giant Baby" ("I don't have enough
money to make ironic purchases!"), but we still ended up forking
over some cash to gratify ourselves.
Next, we finally worked up the courage to start asking people if
we could Like photographs. Despite their sometimes intimidating
appearances, most of the costumed fans turned out to be extreme
ly friendly, not just letting us take their picture but also enthusiasti
cally acting out their roles. The only bad experience came when
Alice took a photo of three scantily-clad women, and this creepy be
spectacled guy in the booth behind called out, "Thank YOU,
ladies!"
After we ran away from the creepy guy, shuddering and feeling
sorry for subjecting the women to him, other questionable men
popped up everywhere. One wore a black T-shirt bearing the in
scription, "It's not going to suck ITSELF." Another man, a tall
lankster wtih long hair, wore a shirt that said, simply, "Seduce Me."

Bay Con 2003 was far from asexual. As well as the overabundance
of greasy men in horrible T-shirts, there were a great many mounds
of flesh revealed, especially by female attendees. That day, we saw
more women in corsets than we have ever seen in our whole lives. A
woman in a turquoise corset, walked by us in the dealers' room, her
breasts rising up to her chin and loosely spilling over the top of the
corset. VVe were silent fora moment.
That s so amazing," Alice said.
Anthony s face contorted. "I don't think 'amazing' is the right
word."
On that note, we decided to attend the "Alien Sex" panel. After
two relatively dry writing panels, it was time fora change. We also
figured that non-geek readers could be lured into reading this arti

dew ith the mention of sex.
At the panel, we sat up at the front. We even turned on the tape
recorder, expecting salaciously dorky accounts of sex on other plan
ets. Although the presentation was interesting, it was more about
weird sex in the natural world. Interesting and informative (basi
cally, bugs do it freaky-style), but not w hat we expected.
The room was full of jokers yelling comments about ripped-off
bee penises and lesbian beetles, as well as belligerent middle-aged
men (we were beginning to see a theme) loudly showing off their
best scientific knowledge. However, the best moment occurred
when a very old man dressed in sensible khakis said, "Caucasians
have high amounts of stink, Negroids have moderate stink and Ori
entals don't stink at all." He was quite serious about this. (It's worth
noting that at this panel, as well as everywhere else in the conven
tion, non-whites were either extremely rare or completely absent.)

Perhaps it IS a good day to die! Prepare for
ramming speed!
— Worf, "Star Trek: First Contact"

The big event of the night was the Masquerade. We stood
at the end of a long, winding line to get into the ballroom,

sandwiched by a nasal, lisping couple and a respectable
older man. Alice gave him a flat tire three times, feeling
progressively more awful about her clumsiness. During
the wait, Anthony hissed to Alice, "Dude, listen to the

couple behind us!"
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to tape their con
versation, but seriously — they were absolutely per-

fect in their untarnished dorkiness. The one snippet
that we were able to get down was their comment on
an impressive Nightcrawler outfit in front of us: "Un
fortunately, he has no 'bampf!"

The ballroom was set up so that a large space in
front was the "stage," and the rest of us sat or stood in
the audience. We nabbed some chairs and waited for

what would surely be pure awesomeness.
We were not disappointed. Sure, there were a few
weird, abstract pieces — the first woman called her cos
tume "The Coming of the Dawn," although we couldn't

spot anything sun or dawn-like about her — and the pre
dictable "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" outfits, but
there was also some creative and elaborate shit, like the sleek
"Sexy Robot," as well as "Vortex," this badass monkey/wolf/
shaman thing with giant wings. There was also a moment of fan
nish camaraderie when a guy dressed up as one of the "Knights
Who Say 'Ni!'" lumbered onstage, and everyone started shout-

ing, "NI!"
The hands-down most awesome sight — not just at the
convention, but, like, in the entire universe — was the "One
Ring Circus." A whole troop of conventioneers dressed as
characters from"The Lord of the Rings," accompanied by a
hula-hoop-sized gold ring replica, came out and did this
crazy-ass song and dance routine (modeled on the song
"The I'itch," a.k.a. "So Exciting!" from "Moulin Rouge")
summarizing, die plot of the books.
After the perfomuuice, we sat in shocked awe fora

while, unable to speak.
"Now I can die," Anthony whispered suicerdv.

There wasn't a whole lot going on
the Masquerade, so we slowly made our way '
out, stopping first to collect free issues of
BBW (Big Beautiful Woman) Magazine and

"Freddy vs. Jason" posters — cool as this movie looks, there's no
s way that it's going to match the insane awesomeness of "Jason X" —
that were lying around, and then to watch kids beat the shit out of
t each other with Styrofoam-wrapped PVC pipes (don't ask).
"I am DEFINITELY coming back next year."
"You realize that if we return, we won't be able to use the excuse
112 ofjournalistic curiosity. Our geekiness will be exposed for all to see."

tume "The Coming of the Dawn," although we couldn't

spot anything sun or dawn-like about her — and the pre
dictable "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" outfits, but
there was also some creative and elaborate shit, like the sleek
"Sexy Robot," as well as "Vortex," this badass monkey/wolf/
shaman thing with giant wings. There was also a moment of fan
nish camaraderie when a guy dressed up as one of the "Knights
Who Say 'Ni!'" lumbered onstage, and everyone started shout-

ing, "NI!"
The hands-down most awesome sight — not just at the
convention, but, like, in the entire universe — was the "One
Ring Circus." A whole troop of conventioneers dressed as
characters from"The Lord of the Rings," accompanied by a
hula-hoop-sized gold ring replica, came out and did this
crazy-ass song and dance routine (modeled on the song
"The I'itch," a.k.a. "So Exciting!" from "Moulin Rouge")

— Capt. Archer, "Star Trek Enterprise"
I A■ Me were driving through the parking lot of San Jose's
I mm m Doubletree Hotel when Alice grabbed Anthony's arm
KM and started shrieking, "Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"What? I'm driving here!"
But then Anthony saw them — two men and two women in full
Klingon attire, complete with long, curly dark hair and bumpy fore
heads. "Holy shit!"
"Anthony, I am SO glad that we came!"
But Anthony was too busy gaping to say anything in return. As
he drove past the Klingons, he gave a small, shy wave. They waved
back cheerfully.
"Me too," he finally squeaked.
Inside the hotel, the 21st Annual San Francisco Bay Regional Sci
ence Fiction and Fantasy Convention was in full swing. It was
like... heaven. Tying in with the convention's theme of "It's About
Time," clocks were strung around the registration desk. Fairies,
jedis, elves and assorted other fantastic creatures wandered by, talk
ing, laughing and pointing to people who had even more elaborate
and oudandish costumes.
A few minutes later, we'd taken care of registration and were now
the proud owners of green convention badges — the key to wan
dering freely through this surreal paradise — and small pins read
ing "The End is Extremely Fucking Nigh," so we headed over to our
first stop: the dealers' room.
It was huge, filled with people and tables and merchandise, but
also stuffy. The distinctive odor of 8.0. wafted through the air, even
though Anthony said he couldn't smell it. Alice could. But even that
did not lessen our enjoyment. Dealers sold things like art, jewelry,
Renaissance-era fetish wear — one stall specializing in corsets also
sold teddy bears cinched and sexed-out in their own mini corsets —
T-shirts, comics, action figures (ranging from characters in Neil
Gaiman's "Sandman" comics to Playmates of the Year) and books.
Oh God, the books. This is where we lost our steely journalistic dis
tance and went insane, pushing over small cape-wearing children to
reach first-editions of Philip K. Dick novels.
"Sweet Jesus, check out this paperback copy of The Man In The
High Casde!'"
"That is SO awesome!"
"But what's with the random cover? I don't remember a giant
disembodied eye, do — son of a BITCH, there's a first edition of
'Nova' for only five bucks!"
However, we soon realized there was much more to be seen
and — after talking to the proprietress of the book stall and being
reassured that they'd still be there later — resolved to come back
later in the day. We walked over to the art gallery, which was guard
ed by a taciturn Asian Boba Fett. Inside, the New .Age hippieness of
the art was overwhelming — unicorns, sexy healer-elf-nymphs with
supernatural breasts popping out of their tunics, crystals, forests —
it went on and on.
"Where are the space battles?" Anthony bitched, and with good
reason. We couldn't find any planetary explosions or alien beasts
wailing on one another or ray guns in this sadly incomplete art
gallery. So we moved on.
It's difficult to work in a group when you're om

It was time for us to attend our first panel. Since we both harbor
dreams of one day carrying our very own shiny Hugos (writing
awards given at the World Science Fiction Convention) home with
us, we decided to check out "The Top 10 Rookie Writer Mistakes"
and "Yes, I Did Just Have My First Novel Published." The panels
didn't have anyone famous enough to bring our drooling fan-geek

personalities to the surface (with the exception of Cory Doctorow,
whom we'd both recognized and enjoyed), but they were still pret
ty interesting.
The atmosphere was very insider-y and clannish: Panelists made
jokes like, "You know what's a good idea? Send a story with a uni
corn to Analog!" and most of the audience would chuckle heartily.
(See, Analog is a magazine specializing in ... nevermind.)
But not everything was happy and chummy. For one, there was
a man with a damn crying baby in the back at BOTH panels, and he
refused to take the baby out until halfway through the second one;
he just kept cooing and rocking the baby, probably trying to shove
a pacifier into its mouth too. Daddy must have thought it was a little
more important to learn how to sell his sci-fi masterpiece than to
keep his baby happy (and not drive the rest of us nuts).
There were also two balding, middle-aged dudes who started out
by asking mildly belligerent questions and only got worse as the pan
els progressed. Apparendy, neither of them had had much luck
with their science fiction writing careers thus far, and they were
pissed.
Favorite quote (spoken by Doctorow): "Writing science fiction
has all the social and financial potential of Civil War reenactmenfs.
If you don't love it, don't do it."
If it should become necessary to fight, could
you arrange to find some rocks to throw at
them?
—Fliker, "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
After about an hour, we realized that we needed to head back to
the dealers' room if we wanted to buy our books and take some pho
tos before it closed, so we snuck out. Alice restrained herself from
buying Kit Reed's "Attack of the Giant Baby" ("I don't have enough
money to make ironic purchases!"), but we still ended up forking
over some cash to gratify ourselves.
Next, we finally worked up the courage to start asking people if
we could Like photographs. Despite their sometimes intimidating
appearances, most of the costumed fans turned out to be extreme
ly friendly, not just letting us take their picture but also enthusiasti
cally acting out their roles. The only bad experience came when
Alice took a photo of three scantily-clad women, and this creepy be
spectacled guy in the booth behind called out, "Thank YOU,
ladies!"
After we ran away from the creepy guy, shuddering and feeling
sorry for subjecting the women to him, other questionable men
popped up everywhere. One wore a black T-shirt bearing the in
scription, "It's not going to suck ITSELF." Another man, a tall
lankster wtih long hair, wore a shirt that said, simply, "Seduce Me."

Bay Con 2003 was far from asexual. As well as the overabundance
of greasy men in horrible T-shirts, there were a great many mounds
of flesh revealed, especially by female attendees. That day, we saw
more women in corsets than we have ever seen in our whole lives. A
woman in a turquoise corset, walked by us in the dealers' room, her
breasts rising up to her chin and loosely spilling over the top of the
corset. VVe were silent fora moment.
That s so amazing," Alice said.
Anthony s face contorted. "I don't think 'amazing' is the right
word."
On that note, we decided to attend the "Alien Sex" panel. After
two relatively dry writing panels, it was time fora change. We also
figured that non-geek readers could be lured into reading this arti

dew ith the mention of sex.
At the panel, we sat up at the front. We even turned on the tape
recorder, expecting salaciously dorky accounts of sex on other plan
ets. Although the presentation was interesting, it was more about
weird sex in the natural world. Interesting and informative (basi
cally, bugs do it freaky-style), but not w hat we expected.
The room was full of jokers yelling comments about ripped-off
bee penises and lesbian beetles, as well as belligerent middle-aged
men (we were beginning to see a theme) loudly showing off their
best scientific knowledge. However, the best moment occurred
when a very old man dressed in sensible khakis said, "Caucasians
have high amounts of stink, Negroids have moderate stink and Ori
entals don't stink at all." He was quite serious about this. (It's worth
noting that at this panel, as well as everywhere else in the conven
tion, non-whites were either extremely rare or completely absent.)

Perhaps it IS a good day to die! Prepare for
ramming speed!
— Worf, "Star Trek: First Contact"

The big event of the night was the Masquerade. We stood
at the end of a long, winding line to get into the ballroom,

sandwiched by a nasal, lisping couple and a respectable
older man. Alice gave him a flat tire three times, feeling
progressively more awful about her clumsiness. During
the wait, Anthony hissed to Alice, "Dude, listen to the

couple behind us!"
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to tape their con
versation, but seriously — they were absolutely per-

fect in their untarnished dorkiness. The one snippet
that we were able to get down was their comment on
an impressive Nightcrawler outfit in front of us: "Un
fortunately, he has no 'bampf!"

The ballroom was set up so that a large space in
front was the "stage," and the rest of us sat or stood in
the audience. We nabbed some chairs and waited for

what would surely be pure awesomeness.
We were not disappointed. Sure, there were a few
weird, abstract pieces — the first woman called her cos

spot anything sun or dawn-like about her — and the pre

At the panel, we sat up at the front. We even turned on the tape
recorder, expecting salaciously dorky accounts of sex on other plan
ets. Although the presentation was interesting, it was more about
weird sex in the natural world. Interesting and informative (basi
cally, bugs do it freaky-style), but not w hat we expected.
The room was full of jokers yelling comments about ripped-off
bee penises and lesbian beetles, as well as belligerent middle-aged
men (we were beginning to see a theme) loudly showing off their
best scientific knowledge. However, the best moment occurred
when a very old man dressed in sensible khakis said, "Caucasians
have high amounts of stink, Negroids have moderate stink and Ori
entals don't stink at all." He was quite serious about this. (It's worth
noting that at this panel, as well as everywhere else in the conven
tion, non-whites were either extremely rare or completely absent.)

Perhaps it IS a good day to die! Prepare for
ramming speed!

The big event of the night was the Masquerade. We stood
at the end of a long, winding line to get into the ballroom,

sandwiched by a nasal, lisping couple and a respectable
older man. Alice gave him a flat tire three times, feeling
progressively more awful about her clumsiness. During
the wait, Anthony hissed to Alice, "Dude, listen to the

couple behind us!"
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to tape their con
versation, but seriously — they were absolutely per-

fect in their untarnished dorkiness. The one snippet
that we were able to get down was their comment on
an impressive Nightcrawler outfit in front of us: "Un
fortunately, he has no 'bampf!"

The ballroom was set up so that a large space in
front was the "stage," and the rest of us sat or stood in
the audience. We nabbed some chairs and waited for

what would surely be pure awesomeness.
We were not disappointed. Sure, there were a few
weird, abstract pieces — the first woman called her cos
tume "The Coming of the Dawn," although we couldn't

spot anything sun or dawn-like about her — and the pre
dictable "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" outfits, but
there was also some creative and elaborate shit, like the sleek
"Sexy Robot," as well as "Vortex," this badass monkey/wolf/
shaman thing with giant wings. There was also a moment of fan
nish camaraderie when a guy dressed up as one of the "Knights
Who Say 'Ni!'" lumbered onstage, and everyone started shout-

ing, "NI!"
The hands-down most awesome sight — not just at the
convention, but, like, in the entire universe — was the "One
Ring Circus." A whole troop of conventioneers dressed as
characters from"The Lord of the Rings," accompanied by a
hula-hoop-sized gold ring replica, came out and did this
crazy-ass song and dance routine (modeled on the song
"The I'itch," a.k.a. "So Exciting!" from "Moulin Rouge")
summarizing, die plot of the books.
After the perfomuuice, we sat in shocked awe fora

while, unable to speak.
"Now I can die," Anthony whispered suicerdv.

There wasn't a whole lot going on
the Masquerade, so we slowly made our way '
out, stopping first to collect free issues of
BBW (Big Beautiful Woman) Magazine and

"Freddy vs. Jason" posters — cool as this movie looks, there's no
s way that it's going to match the insane awesomeness of "Jason X" —
that were lying around, and then to watch kids beat the shit out of
t each other with Styrofoam-wrapped PVC pipes (don't ask).

Inform the Vulcans we are about to make a
very loud noise.
— Capt. Archer, "Star Trek Enterprise"
I A■ Me were driving through the parking lot of San Jose's
I mm m Doubletree Hotel when Alice grabbed Anthony's arm
KM and started shrieking, "Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"What? I'm driving here!"
But then Anthony saw them — two men and two women in full
Klingon attire, complete with long, curly dark hair and bumpy fore
heads. "Holy shit!"
"Anthony, I am SO glad that we came!"
But Anthony was too busy gaping to say anything in return. As
he drove past the Klingons, he gave a small, shy wave. They waved
back cheerfully.
"Me too," he finally squeaked.
Inside the hotel, the 21st Annual San Francisco Bay Regional Sci
ence Fiction and Fantasy Convention was in full swing. It was
like... heaven. Tying in with the convention's theme of "It's About
Time," clocks were strung around the registration desk. Fairies,
jedis, elves and assorted other fantastic creatures wandered by, talk
ing, laughing and pointing to people who had even more elaborate
and oudandish costumes.
A few minutes later, we'd taken care of registration and were now
the proud owners of green convention badges — the key to wan
dering freely through this surreal paradise — and small pins read
ing "The End is Extremely Fucking Nigh," so we headed over to our
first stop: the dealers' room.
It was huge, filled with people and tables and merchandise, but
also stuffy. The distinctive odor of 8.0. wafted through the air, even
though Anthony said he couldn't smell it. Alice could. But even that
did not lessen our enjoyment. Dealers sold things like art, jewelry,
Renaissance-era fetish wear — one stall specializing in corsets also
sold teddy bears cinched and sexed-out in their own mini corsets —
T-shirts, comics, action figures (ranging from characters in Neil
Gaiman's "Sandman" comics to Playmates of the Year) and books.
Oh God, the books. This is where we lost our steely journalistic dis
tance and went insane, pushing over small cape-wearing children to
reach first-editions of Philip K. Dick novels.
"Sweet Jesus, check out this paperback copy of The Man In The
High Casde!'"
"That is SO awesome!"
"But what's with the random cover? I don't remember a giant
disembodied eye, do — son of a BITCH, there's a first edition of
'Nova' for only five bucks!"
However, we soon realized there was much more to be seen
and — after talking to the proprietress of the book stall and being
reassured that they'd still be there later — resolved to come back
later in the day. We walked over to the art gallery, which was guard
ed by a taciturn Asian Boba Fett. Inside, the New .Age hippieness of
the art was overwhelming — unicorns, sexy healer-elf-nymphs with
supernatural breasts popping out of their tunics, crystals, forests —
it went on and on.
"Where are the space battles?" Anthony bitched, and with good
reason. We couldn't find any planetary explosions or alien beasts
wailing on one another or ray guns in this sadly incomplete art
gallery. So we moved on.
It's difficult to work in a group when you're om
nipotent!
—Q, "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
It was time for us to attend our first panel. Since we both harbor
dreams of one day carrying our very own shiny Hugos (writing
awards given at the World Science Fiction Convention) home with
us, we decided to check out "The Top 10 Rookie Writer Mistakes"
and "Yes, I Did Just Have My First Novel Published." The panels
didn't have anyone famous enough to bring our drooling fan-geek

personalities to the surface (with the exception of Cory Doctorow,
whom we'd both recognized and enjoyed), but they were still pret
ty interesting.
The atmosphere was very insider-y and clannish: Panelists made
jokes like, "You know what's a good idea? Send a story with a uni
corn to Analog!" and most of the audience would chuckle heartily.
(See, Analog is a magazine specializing in ... nevermind.)
But not everything was happy and chummy. For one, there was
a man with a damn crying baby in the back at BOTH panels, and he
refused to take the baby out until halfway through the second one;
he just kept cooing and rocking the baby, probably trying to shove
a pacifier into its mouth too. Daddy must have thought it was a little
more important to learn how to sell his sci-fi masterpiece than to
keep his baby happy (and not drive the rest of us nuts).
There were also two balding, middle-aged dudes who started out
by asking mildly belligerent questions and only got worse as the pan
els progressed. Apparendy, neither of them had had much luck
with their science fiction writing careers thus far, and they were
pissed.
Favorite quote (spoken by Doctorow): "Writing science fiction
has all the social and financial potential of Civil War reenactmenfs.
If you don't love it, don't do it."
If it should become necessary to fight, could
you arrange to find some rocks to throw at
them?
—Fliker, "Star Trek: The Next Generation"
After about an hour, we realized that we needed to head back to
the dealers' room if we wanted to buy our books and take some pho
tos before it closed, so we snuck out. Alice restrained herself from
buying Kit Reed's "Attack of the Giant Baby" ("I don't have enough
money to make ironic purchases!"), but we still ended up forking
over some cash to gratify ourselves.
Next, we finally worked up the courage to start asking people if
we could Like photographs. Despite their sometimes intimidating
appearances, most of the costumed fans turned out to be extreme
ly friendly, not just letting us take their picture but also enthusiasti
cally acting out their roles. The only bad experience came when
Alice took a photo of three scantily-clad women, and this creepy be
spectacled guy in the booth behind called out, "Thank YOU,
ladies!"
After we ran away from the creepy guy, shuddering and feeling
sorry for subjecting the women to him, other questionable men
popped up everywhere. One wore a black T-shirt bearing the in
scription, "It's not going to suck ITSELF." Another man, a tall
lankster wtih long hair, wore a shirt that said, simply, "Seduce Me."

Bay Con 2003 was far from asexual. As well as the overabundance
of greasy men in horrible T-shirts, there were a great many mounds
of flesh revealed, especially by female attendees. That day, we saw
more women in corsets than we have ever seen in our whole lives. A
woman in a turquoise corset, walked by us in the dealers' room, her
breasts rising up to her chin and loosely spilling over the top of the
corset. VVe were silent fora moment.
That s so amazing," Alice said.
Anthony s face contorted. "I don't think 'amazing' is the right
word."
On that note, we decided to attend the "Alien Sex" panel. After
two relatively dry writing panels, it was time fora change. We also
figured that non-geek readers could be lured into reading this arti

dew ith the mention of sex.
