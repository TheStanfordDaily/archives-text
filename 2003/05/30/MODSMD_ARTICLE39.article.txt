# The 						Deftones need to find their voice again

### STEPHEN VIGIL 
The Deftones are difficult to figure out.
Just when you think they fit the stereotype
of a certain genre, they turn around and
spit in your face.
Having established their reputation
with an unorthodox approach to alterna
tive metal, the Deftones formed in Sacra
mento, Calif, in 1988. What initially start
ed off mostly as a heavy metal band even
tually found its voice, almost quite literal
ly, in the signature vocals of Chino
Moreno.
The Deftones' first two albums, 1995's
"Adrenaline" and 1997's "Around the
Fur," were characterized by hard driving
guitars and the yearning vocals of
Moreno. "White Pony," released in 2000,
marked a slight departure from the
Deftones previous direction, mainly in the
fact it was not quite as heavy as the previ
ous two. Many diehard fans criticized this
change, but nonetheless the album was a
commercial and critical success.
In which direction could the Deftones
head after "White Pony?" To ask this ques
tion seems extraneous given the limiting
confines of heavy metal. Nevertheless,
with their current release, "Deftones," the
band branches out even more, testing the
limits of this modern genre. But does it

work? The results are mixed. The reac
tions are just as varied. It is difficult to fol
low up a success such as "White Pony," and
"Deftories" is not exactly a let down. Still,
it leaves the listener wondering what he or
she got out of it. And perhaps that is a good
thing... or not.
Undeniably, Moreno's vocals are full of

contradictions. They are pensive, yet
piercing, which oddly do not overpower
the other instruments. Moreno's words
sink into the song easily while his mood
treads a fine line between morbidity and
anger.
However, there is something in the
album to satisfy most Deftones fans. For

IDeftones
Deftones

example, songs like
"When Girls Tele
phone Boys" will

satisfy listeners fond of earlier Deftones
records whereas "Bloody Cape" is remi
niscent of "White Pony." There is even a
radio friendly tune in the form of "Miner
va."
On a few tracks on "Deftones" the band
tries to venture slightly out of its realm of
comfort. On "Lucky You," the band
blends interesting digital effects that al
most sound like a mix of' Bos pop and the
Nine Inch Nails. Infused with the
Deftones sound, the song becomes a
brooding musing on isolation and long
ing. On "Anniversary of an Uninteresting
Event,"the Deftones uncharacteristically
incorporate the piano. The song ends up
sounding like a track from Pink Floyd's
"Momentary Lapse of Reason." This ex
perimentation pays off more than it did on
"Lucky."
The hidden gem on "Deftones" is
"Deathblo," with its distorted baseline and
hurting vocals. Laid on top of a backdrop
of creepy synthetic harmonica effects, the
song plays with your mind so much you
forget it is only a song. Overall, "Deftones"
is a record one can listen to over and over
again — and never quite understand. I for
one, am still confused.
