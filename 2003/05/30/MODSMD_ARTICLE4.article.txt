# Etchemendy talks on budget troubles
## 
### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
Echoing the advice lie gave at the end of
his January emergency budget report,
University Provost John Etchemendy
once again advised the Faculty Senate not
to panic about the University's financial sit
uation but to "feel free to worry."
The budget report, he said, "which I give
annually," is intended to provide compre
hensive information about the University's
three budgets: the consolidated budget, the

general funds budget and the capital budget.
"The process of putting together these
three budgets is a huge, long difficult
process," he said.
Etchemendy prefaced liis report by telling
the senate that "the context for this budget
year is dominated by the poor economic cli
mate" and that the overall investment perfor
mance has been "roughly flat." There has
been a reduction in the expendable funds
pool, "a slowing of the increase we've seen in
recent years" in research volume, a marked
increase in the benefits rate and, in light of the

poor job market and economy, a growing
payroll and financial aid budget.
"We're finding that it's much easier to
retain staff," Etchemendy said. "It's much
easier to fill positions, but what has hap
pened is that... all of a sudden, many of
them have been filled."
He called this a "double-edged sword,"
since more people have jobs, but it increas
es the payroll.
According to Etchemendy, students
now require more financial aid in
order to afford the tuition, which
was just increased 5 percent. Fami
lies are struggling widi the poor
economy, so the financial aid bud
get has grown 7.5 percent.
The "huge increase" in the bene
fits rate — over 4 percent — is
largely due to the increase in med
ical costs. Additionally, the benefits
rate must both compensate fora de
crease in the benefits pool fund
from die fiscal years 2002 and 2003
and reflect a .5 percent increase in
retirement benefits.
The consolidated funds budget,
according to Etchemendy, is "a fore
cast of the budget for the entire Uni
versity." He predicted a $19
million — 1 percent — deficit for
the fiscal year 2004, mainly as are

suit of the economic climate and the
fact that the University has been
"spending down on reserves."
In contrast, Etchemendy report
ed that he projects a $2.9 million —
.5 percent — surplus in the general
funds budget, even alter a $40 mil
lion deficit was initially predicted.
What made this shift from a deficit to
a surplus possible includes increas
ing both undergraduate and pan
time graduate tuition, instituting a
salary freeze, implementing budget
cuts within both academic and ad
ministrative departments and using
more reserve funds within depart
ments "to help close budget gaps."
Many schools are making models
to determine the best level of extra
funds to keep in case of an emer
gency. Over the past 10 years, the
annual growth rate of the fund bal
ances for the academic units has
been 10 percent.
"Ten percent — that's huge,"
Etchemendy said, proceeding to tell

the senate that the current figure is
approximately minus 2 percent.
Academic and administrative
units took, on average, 6.1 percent
in budget cuts for this fiscal year.
The fact that the cuts are the same is
coincidental. As Etchemendy ex
plained, each unit was assessed for
cuts individually.
"There were not across-the
lx>ard cuts," he said.
The capital budget outlines a
three-year window of all building
projects. Despite the University's
current financial situation,
Etchemendy assured the senate that
he is "pretty committed" to the pro
jects slated for the 2004 fiscal year.
Some major projects that already
have funding frilly identified include
the new Kavli Institute building at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, a new graduate community
center and the Lucas expansion.
According to Etchemendy, all
capital projects have had to deal

with significant financial setbacks.
Some projects scheduled for the fu
ture will either not happen or be de
layed due to inadequate funds.
"The University is very con
strained in the amount of debt it can
issue," fie said. "There is not a lot
left over to lie allocated to capital
projects."
Capital plan totals have steadily
decreased over the last three years
because, according to Etchemendy,
"a lot of realism has been injected
into the system."
"I expect 75 to 80 percent [ofour
capital projects] to get built eventu
ally — 50 percent in the three-year
window," he said, adding that for
many upcoming projects, the ma
jority of funding sources have not
yet been identified.
"I do not expect these all [of these
projects] to be completed," he said.
To conclude his presentation,
Etchemendy showed the senate a
slide depicting a frowning face icon

accompanied by a teardrop. Its cap
tion included the prediction that
"there will likely be a need for fur
ther cuts / restructuring in [fiscal
year 2005]."
Etchemendy fielded questions
about how the salary freeze is affect
ing the University's competitive
ness, how effective the hiring freeze
has been and what worries him the
most at this point.
Witfi regard to faculty salaries,
Etchemendy said, "We're in pretty
good shape.
"It's not a good thing to freeze
salaries, but we benefit from the fact
that... our staff have jobs," he said,
adding that "our salaries are very,
very competitive" and that the Uni
versity has "great strengths over and
above the financial situation."
"I believe tfiat we retain faculty as
effectively or even more effectively
than other universities," he said.
Etchemendy admitted that the
hiring freeze "has not been as effec

tive as we would have liked" and
told the senate that "it's very difficult
to know why that's the case."
When asked what worries him
die most about the University's fi
nancial situation, Etchemendy first
responded that "it will not decrease
the quality of either the education we
deliver or the quality of research "
In answer to the question, he said
that "what worries me the most is
moving forward."
He explained that there cannot
be another salary freeze next year
since it would weaken the situation
more. If the situation persists, he said
he will need to implement more sig
nificant structural budget cuts.
Even after showing a frowning
face icon as a conclusion to his re
port, Etchemendy ultimately ended
with a bit of encouragement.
He said, "I think there was
enough fat in the system that people
will not notice the effects of these
cuts."
