# Dishing up a classy act: Yoshi's in S.F.
## 
### TIFFANY LEE 
All the best artists stop by as they pass
through the Bay Area, so if you have a pas
sion for great jazz you should make your
way over to Yoshi's, one of the hottest jazz
clubs in the Bay Area. It's been named one
ofUSAToday's" 10 Great Places fora Jazzy
Night Out" as well as "Best Jazz Club" by
SF Weekly and SF Bay Guardian. The one
problem is that the club is a bit pricey, es
pecially since they ask you, very politely of
course, to purchase at least one drink on
top of the cover charge. The club is, how
ever, for all ages at all times, although I
didn't see many children there.
The crowd ranges in age from high
school students to families with children
and grandparents, but the crowd was pret
ty lively, at least when I went. Because of
the popularity of the club, the good seats
go fast. I went to an 8 p.m. Thursday show
ing, and even though I showed up an hour
early, most of the seats directly in front of
the stage were taken. As I was leaving, the
10 p.m. show's line was well formed. The
venue, however, is small enough for al
most any seat to be fairly decent, and the
acoustics are great â€” loud but not deafen
ingly so, which lets the audience fully enjoy
the music and ambience.
The club is very classy and very chic, a
perfect place to take a date or to go for an

anniversary of some sort. The
lighting is dim, the tables lend
themselves to intimate seating,
and the music is, of course,
great. And if you want sushi to
munch on, either for dinner or

while you watch the show, the club is part
of a Japanese restaurant that serves a wide
variety of sushi, although I haven't person
ally tried the food. The one complaint I
have about the club setup is that the seats
aren't all the comfortable, especially the
stools at the higher tables, because of the
close seating.
Yoshi's features not only some of the
best known jazz artists such as the Diana
Krall Quartet, but also some less well
known but equally talented and innovative
players. The night I went to Yoshi's I had
the pleasure of seeing Nicholas Payton and
Sonic Trance. Nicholas Payton, a Grammy
winning trumpet player, played very skill
fully and the band as a whole brought in
teresting elements of trance and classical to
their music. I was extremely impressed by
the addition of the percussionist Danny
Sadownick who played the Congo drums
as well as a variety of bells, chimes and cym
bals. Sadownick added an interesting and
unique sound to the traditional drums,
brass, bass and piano jazz orchestra, giving
this group a unique twist that traditional
jazz bands don't often have.
Yoshi's is an experience that everyone
should try at least once. It makes fans for
life, even if jazz music isn't your forte.
