# A 						musician and Intermission writer says goodbye
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
For us seniors, graduation is just
around the corner. When I look back
on my own Stanford life, I see four
years dominated by music — this is
not surprising to many of you, who
have seen my CD reviews grace these
pages or perhaps seen the Jonathan
Beard Band perform at campus cele
brations and festivals. And as it is now
time for me to say goodbye to Inter
mission, where I have found a home
in words for the last three years, I'd
like to take a last opportunity — as we
all should — to reminisce on a memo
ry or two, before I walk into the next
chapter of my musical life.
Without a doubt, the most trying,
and rewarding, musical project I have
completed here is my own album:
"Feeling Free." This was a record that
— simply put — I needed to make.
The songs basically tell the story of
three unique relationships I had,
combined into one narrative. But the
scary thing about doing an album like
this was that working on many of the
songs — even the happy ones —
began to rekindle suppressed nega
tive emotions that I had not fully dealt
with until then. The result was that I

barely survived making the album,
but the finished product was emotion
ally charged in a very tangible way. As
a note to musicians with years still left
here: If you have time and opportuni
ty to record at Stanford, take it, be
cause the top-notch facilities here can
help you to create a memory that you
can always be proud of.
At this time, SURGE, the student
run recording / arts organization that
I am overseeing this year, is finishing
up work on its second annual Univer
sity compilation, titled "Something to
Say." It will be available for free on
campus at the end of May, and I hope
that it helps to serve as a reminder to
everyone of the amazing artistic talent
on this campus. As I move on to pur
sue my Masters in music in Los Ange
les next year, I wish to tip my hat to
the artists who remain, who will con
tinue to thrive, continue to strive, and
hopefully continue to gain more and
more support from the university as
time goes by. It's been special... It's
been memorable.

Jonathan Beard's album. Feeling Free, is
available at the Stanford Bookstore and
online at umnv.jonathanbeard.com. He
can be reached atjrbeard@stanford.edu
