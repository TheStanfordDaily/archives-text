# In this crazy, mixed-up world, Live goes on

There is an interesting dis
crepancy between the opinions
of music critics and the opinions
of plain old music fans. When a
fan finds a band he likes, such as
Live, he is happy when they con
tinue to put out music that
sounds the same, like them, for
six albums and 12 years. The
critic, however, will accuse this
same band of a lack of growth,
not staying current to new cut
ting edge styles, never maturing,
and the like. In this way, Live is a
band for the fans.
And it's true, Live's sixth and
newest album, "Birds of Pray,"
sounds pretty much the same as
their last five have. But I have to
say, if you have something that
works, why change it?
On "Birds of Pray," lead
singer Ed Kowalczyk delivers his
typical quiet, foreboding intro
ductions building up to top-of
the-lungs rock-out choruses,
with the usual vocal and instru

mental strength. This formula"
seems to work well, allowing
lines like "pick up a pen and fight

for the right to dream," in tht
song "Sanctity of Dreams," t(
sound momentous and inspiret
instead of overdone and cliched
His lyrics combine somewhere ir
between the religious, politica
and emotional spheres to creatt
a powerful and moody album
This works well, if you can look
past the fact that it is the same
power and mood that Live has
always invoked.
Live obviously stumbled onto
something good in the early '90s
and has held onto that for over a
decade, as pop music shifted
from the Seattle garage grunge
of Nirvana and Green Day, to
Britney, Christina and Justin
and back again to newer, harder
pop bands like Staind or Creed,
which were influenced by Live
early in their careers. After the
release, and relative failure, of
their fifth album, "V," only a
week after the September 11 th

Birds of Prey

attacks, Live thought

it was time to get back to basics.
That is exactly what they have
done on "Birds of Pray." The
first track on the album; "Heav
en," (also the first single re
leased) was inspired by the birth
of Kowalczyk's daughter and
gives off a vibe of hope and trust
throughout the changing verses
appropriate to the subject.
"Life Marches On," the fifth
track on "Birds of Pray," ends
with the line "I turn on the
radio, only leaves me down with
the question, what happened to
our generation?" The answer, it
seems, is they are still there, just
a little outdated. Live is still
making music for the early '90s,
while its potential fan base
wants to hear music for 2003.
Live should just keep doing
what they know how to do, pro
ducing great fist-in-the-air al
bums, because wasn't rock back
then better anvwav?
