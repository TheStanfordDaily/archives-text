# Weirder and better than ever

### ANDREW NIELSEN 
In 1979, a goofy Cal Poly graduate sent a demo cas
sette to a novelty DJ known as Dr. Demento. Originally
recorded in a bathroom, the tape contained a parody of
a song by the Knack, wherein "My Sharona" became "My
Bologna." Shortly after, the debut album by "Weird Al"
Yankovic appeared, and when he released his sopho
more effort "In 3-D" in 1984, an accompanying video
parody of Michael Jackon's "Beat It," (entitled "Eat It")
sent the comedian to new heights of fame and notoriety.

The MTV era was in its nascent prime, and
the timing was perfect fora performer like A
Yankovic. [l|
Since then, Weird A1 has made fun ofy

practically every genre imaginable, sub-N
stituting words about food, television and

. . um . . . food. Through counteracting the pompous
serious of the music industry and pouring immeasur
able amounts of time into his studio replications of the
songs he parodies, Yankovic has proven that humor
and long-term technical dedication are not dead in the
music industry. Al's new album "Poodle Hat" reflects
this well.
It seems that Al's career has taken him new places
where he has tapped into new emerging genres. He has
kept with the times, choosing his parodies carefully. One
can get a very good feel for the last 20 years of pop music
by listening to Al's back catalogue.
"Poodle Hat" is a hilarious send-up of various turn-of
the-century pop artists, with six original songs by Al that
stand out for their musicianship and expansion of his
musical repertoire. In an age where MTV doesn't feature
anyone over 30, the 43-year-old parodist has been dele
gated to VHI, the used car lot for performers. But Al still
has gas in his tank.
"Couch Potato" parodies of Eminem's "Lose Your
self," as Al raps, "you're gonna lose your mind watchin'
TV / They told me, they'd scold me / But I'd still tune in
every show." Although Al arguably did the same thing
11 years ago, turning MC Hammer's "U Can't Touch
This" into "I Can't Watch This," the hip-hop track
about television concept still works. Will the song be as
big of a hit as "Amish Paradise?" One of the chief barri
ers to the single's possible success is Eminem's recent re
fusal to let Al make a video to accompany his parody. In

a recent interview, A1 admitted that Em
inem thought the "music video would
detract from his legacy as a serious hip
hop artist.. . it's very disappointing.

This could have been my best video ever"
"Trash Day" parodies Nelly's "Hot in Herre" —
"There's somethin' rotten here / you better hold your
nose," A1 raps. A few tracks later, he switches genres by
turning Avril Lavigne's "Complicated" into "Constipat
ed." Although his fifth-grade-friendly lyrics may put
some off", they are an appropriate remedy for an industry
uncompromising in its pompous and unflinching stance.
That is to say, in a world where Lars Ulrich has a person
al vendetta against anyone who has even heard of Nap
ster, it's nice to know that "Weird Al" Yankovic has done
a polka version of "Enter Sandman."
Al's tribute to Bob Dylan is classic. Simply entitled
"Bob," the track emulates any typical Dylan song, com
plete with border-line non-sequiturs. Al sings, "Madam,
I'm Adam / too hot to h00t... no lemons, no melon / too
bad I hid a boot," before going into an out of tune har
monica solo. "Ode to a Superhero" is a parody of Billy
Joel's "Piano Man" and contains the lyrics, "Sling us a
web, you're the Spiderman/Sling us a web tonight/
'Cause we're all in the mood fora hero now / And there's
evil-doers to fight."
In short, even at 43, Yankovic is still kicking. "Poodle
Hat" is a breath of fresh air in an industry filled with über
serious Eminems and calculated throw-away music. Al
though Weird Al has lost some momentum as a parodist
of the music video (whether by his fault or not), "Poodle
Hat" is one of his best albums to date, uncompromising
in its quest for musical quality and subversion of our ex
pectations.
Way to go Al. Now keep on going until album number 27.
