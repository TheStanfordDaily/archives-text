# Blur survives without guitarist Coxon
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
When great bands lose long-term members, the results
are generally negative. Aerosmith without Joe Perry and
R.E.M. without Bill Berry just weren't as fun or as creative,
even with their growing eclecticism. Blur without departed
guitarist Graham Coxon suffers a similar fate, but "Think
Tank," their latest disc, is nonetheless a good effort, if not the

great one Blur's audi
ence may have i

come to expect.

nature. The band uses more electronics and knows how to
use its bloops and bleeps well in the service of its music. What
are first odd sounds soon reveal themselves — for the most
part — as real songs.
Two of these consist merely of repeated phrases, "We've
Got a File on You" and "Jets are like comets at sunset" (from
"Jets"). Fortunately, these are a lot more enjoyable than they
have any right to be. The standout is the electronics-adorned
rocker, "Crazy Beat," although, unlike most other songs on
the album, it does not benefit much from repeated listening.
Blur's subtle side also remains; "Out of Time" is a graceful
and largely-acoustic mid-tempo number that observes, "And
you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time /
To open up on your mind / And watch the world spinning
gently out of time."
As with Pearl Jam's last disc, "Think Tank" touches upon
the current state of the world, but maintains Blur's senses of
fun, irony and absurdity, so the band doesn't fall flat trying
to make serious statements. Blur's obtuseness is at least de
liberate. As with their more recent albums — and lead singer
Damon Albarn's side-project Gorillaz — the lyrics on
" lank" take a backseat to musical explorations. Somehow
this is at times reminiscent of'9os-era INXS, although it's not
clear whether this should be an insult or a compliment.
"Think Tank" seems to lack the soul band members in
fused their previous albums with. Their earlier Brit-pop
works were full of gleeful musings about their homeland,
whereas later efforts had emotionally authentic vignettes
and all-out fun rockers. "Tank" seems more like a set of ex
ercises in style. Granted, on previous album "13," Blur was
heading more and more toward experimentalism, but one
can't help but hope they'd reign themselves in to make a
more solid and cohesive album. Previous albums (and the
songs on them) were well suited to repeated listenings. This
one — not so much.
For Blur fans (and for that matter those who liked Goril
laz), "Think Tank" is a must. For others, it might be better to
start with one of Blur's previous albums, great ones like "The
Great Escape" or "Blur." Blur has weathered Coxon's de
parture, but "Think Tank" is nonetheless a disappointment,
albeit a decent one.
