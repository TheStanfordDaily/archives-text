# The 						Format: Ready to explode outside of Arizona
## 
### TAM VO 
So I watched "Josie and the Pussycats" for
the first time last week, and for the $9 that
the "edited for family viewing" DVD cost
me, it wasn't a waste of money, surprisingly
enough. Josie and her bandmates are
plucked from obscurity and signed to a
major label, which transforms them from
bowling-alley playing garage band into rock
superstars overnight minus the sex and
drugs. Turns out that their maniacal and
evil record label is in cahoots with MTV and
the United States government to brainwash
teens through music, using subliminal mes
sages that transform them into zombie-like
consumer whores. "Ha!" you say. "That's to
tally fake, that could never happen in real
life, dude." And then you watch "Total Re
quest Live" while eating Doritos and drink
ing Sprite in your Abercrombie and Fitch
vintage tee. Right. Anyway, this is the story
about a band called The Format, not an
Archie comics book or other similarly con
trived pop band.
What's The Format? They played five
shows, recorded one song and were signed
to Elektra records. This is about the closest
to any sort of quick definition you'll get be
cause that's exactly what happened. There's
more to the story, though, so I did some in
vestigation and proceeded to stalk Nate
Ruess and Sam Means, who are The For
mat. Born in February 2002, The Format is
comprised of two punk veterans, two friends
who were sick of the limits of the genre and
found an on outlet for their more pop-ori
ented ideas. Through their writing, Nate
and Sam stumbled onto something unpre
dictable: "smart pop music based on a cock
tail of disparate flavors."
To describe their sound, start with a mu
sical foundation that has an unapologetic
'80s streak, with big fat drum machines,
synths, acoustic guitars, a handclap or two.

Throw in some Beatles — can't hurt. Shake
it up with some Cat Stevens / James Taylor /
Peter Simon singer / songwriter tendencies.
Blend at high speed for approximately eight
months, since they were signed just this past
October. Chill well, and you've got The For
mat, whose music is a "mature conglomerate
of their influences."
This very conglomerate is what distin
guished them from scores of other bands,
with the song they recorded and peddled to
independent labels just for the hell of it,
aptly titled, "The First Single." It isn't typi
cally radio-friendly — it catches your ear be
cause it is so damn refreshing. The Format
leaves you feeling that you've experienced
something new, something deeper than
what you usually get with bands these days.
It's the realization that you don't have to set
tle for less, that you don't have to accept
what is advertised as "new" and"the next big
thing" in the world of music, even though
others will eat it up. Lots of local airplay, a
huge listener response, a few live shows and
a positive Internet presence turned The
Format into something formidable — a
buzz that swept the state of Arizona with just
four minutes of great music. This is a band
to watch, as their full-length debut on Elek
tra Records is to be released this October.
Now, let me just say for the record that
high-speed Internet is truly a beautiful
thing, as is AOL Instant Messenger. The
members of The Format put their screen
names on their site, theformat.com. I IM'ed
them until they couldn't ignore me or block
me any longer. Sam Means and I had a four
hour AIM conversation due to insomnia and
discussed various band-related and random
issues.

The Format will be touring this summer July 1
through 31 with Piebald, Ozma, The Start and
Mae to a town ami venue near you — so get off
the couch and go.


Nate and Sam en route to who knows where. Sam looks pretty
out of it here.
