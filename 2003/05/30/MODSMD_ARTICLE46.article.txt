# LOL! Interview with The Format...on AIM!
## The 						Format, continued 
### TAM VO 
mrsammeans: OK, so Nate and I aren't
just new to the whole band thing like a lot
of people might think. People hear that
we've only been a band a year, and all this
stulThappened, but obviously we've done
more than that, 'cause it did happen fast
for us, but part of that was because of our
history together
tam i am 927: You guys aren't newbies.
mrsammeans: Right. So our second band
in four years broke up — one guy went to
tour with Finch, one guy joined toler
ance, one dude moved somewhere. Nate
started school, at community college. He
was taking a college spanish class
tam i am 927: "Yo soy un gringo."
mrsammeans: Exactly. So Nate and I
weren't really talking, not for any reason
... So one day he calls me up, and right
before this I had talked to this guy, Bob
Hoag, who recorded our previous band,
and my plan was to record some songs by
myself with Bob and find someone to sing
them later 'cause i can't sing ... and on
the phone Nate happened to say ...
"Hey we should get together with Bob
and do some songs," and I'm like...
"Well I already have some time sched
uled with Bob, so let's do it."
tam i am 927: Carpe diem,
mrsammeans: So yeah, we did the EP, it
did really well, started getting radio play
on The Edge — that got (us) more atten
tion. Elektra signed us in October, we
started recording the end of January,
stopped April Ist, went on tour fora
month, came back, and here we are.
Sam's new personal goals:
mrsammeans: I'm trying to teach myself
piano; it's so hard. My problem is: It's
hard getting to the point where I mess
around with it enough that I learn how to
do something, but once I figure it otit,
I'm really good at it, like I figured out a
good hand pattern for like .. . ragtimey
kinda stuff, and I'm good at that now, but
it's driving people crazy, so I need to
move on.
tam i am 927: Give them earplugs,
mrsammeans: It's my favorite — like the
guys at Disneyland that play by the food
court, the dixieland stuff,
tam i am 927: Have I told you that I've
played the piano at Disneyland in New
Orleans square a couple of times before?
mrsammeans: No way. No way.
tam i am 927: With the straw hats,
mrsammeans: The old jazzy guys are so
awesome!
tam i am 927: The piano that's all old and
out of tune-y.
mrsammeans: The guys in the bow ties
and the striped shirts — are you as good
as them? Can you play that stuff? Wow,
I'd love to do that. That's great. I want to
be amazing at piano. Thats basically my
goal in life.
tam i am 927: Favorite things?

mrsammeans: The "Amelie" soundtrack
is great.
mrsammeans: Homestarrunner is great.
Keeping it real:
tam i am 927: How have you dealt with all
the buzz that you two have created with
The Format and your music? How did
you know it would work out, with all the
fake people in the industry exploiting
bands these days, for all the money that
they're worth?
mrsammeans: It's just uncomfortable
not knowing, but I'm trying not to worry,
tam i am 927: We take it as a given that
lake people exist and that they have to
"shmooze."
mrsammeans: Definitely, yeah. Well, you
have to be somewhat of an actor in this
business, but you have to stay real inside,
which is why this whole thing is so hard
for me. Neither Nate or myself are good
at being in the spotlight. Now we're
forced to be the center of attention and
make all these people happy. I need to
think about it — writing songs, playing
songs and staying happy,
tam i am 927: How old are you?
mrsammeans: I'm 23 now. My birthday
was today / yesterday — went out to din
ner with the guys recording our CD and
Nate.
tam i am 927: Did they toast "to Sam and
many more years of greatness and
longevity!"
mrsammeans: Yes, I think they did. Ac
tually, I've never been much of a party/
present person. (This is that) second year
I've been in the studio on my birthday.
It's like a new tradition.

Higher learning:
mrsammeans: I was basically just gonna
say that academics are pretty pointless in
reality.
tam i am 927: "Don't let schooling get in
the way of your education."
mrsammeans: Exactly. I mean it's good
for people who need it for their profes
sion, but when it all comes down to it, you
learn more just living than you ever could
going to school. I'm all for school, but it's
not for me, so I didn't go after a year. I
didn't need school to accomplish the
things I wanted to do. I didn't need stu
pid high school jobs to get the job I want
ed. I have a weird outlook on life, and it's
working really well. I've gone through a
lot of bad stuff, but it has been my school.
Bad stuff is the best stuff that can happen.

Sam's Book Club:
tarn i am 927: "Sam I am" in the Dr. Seuss
books — he was a crazy mofo.
mrsammeans: He was crazy.
tam i am 927: "Will you eat them in a
box? Will you eat them with some
lox?"
mrsammeans. And I've been in his shad
ow my whole life.
tam i am 927: "No I will not Sam I
am, I will not eat green eggs and
ham."
mrsammeans: We will forever share
the bond. If only people asked Sam I
am if he liked playing guitar in The
Format and playing with computer
stuff — it's not fair. I have to hear
about him all the time, but he never
hears about me.


Sam says, "Drugs are bad. We don't like drinking. But we love our cigarettes."


Sam wasn't kidding about the cigs.
mrsammeans: OK, so Nate and I aren't
just new to the whole band thing like a lot
of people might think. People hear that
we've only been a band a year, and all this
stulThappened, but obviously we've done

not for me, so I didn't go after a year. I
didn't need school to accomplish the
things I wanted to do. I didn't need stu
pid high school jobs to get the job I want
ed. I have a weird outlook on life, and it's
working really well. I've gone through a
lot of bad stuff, but it has been my school.
Bad stuff is the best stuff that can happen.

Sam's Book Club:
tarn i am 927: "Sam I am" in the Dr. Seuss
books — he was a crazy mofo.
mrsammeans: He was crazy.
tam i am 927: "Will you eat them in a
box? Will you eat them with some
lox?"
mrsammeans. And I've been in his shad
ow my whole life.
tam i am 927: "No I will not Sam I
am, I will not eat green eggs and
ham."
mrsammeans: We will forever share
the bond. If only people asked Sam I
am if he liked playing guitar in The
Format and playing with computer
stuff — it's not fair. I have to hear
about him all the time, but he never
hears about me.


Sam says, "Drugs are bad. We don't like drinking. But we love our cigarettes."


Sam wasn't kidding about the cigs.
mrsammeans: OK, so Nate and I aren't
just new to the whole band thing like a lot
of people might think. People hear that
we've only been a band a year, and all this
stulThappened, but obviously we've done
more than that, 'cause it did happen fast
for us, but part of that was because of our
history together
tam i am 927: You guys aren't newbies.
mrsammeans: Right. So our second band
in four years broke up — one guy went to
tour with Finch, one guy joined toler
ance, one dude moved somewhere. Nate
started school, at community college. He
was taking a college spanish class
tam i am 927: "Yo soy un gringo."
mrsammeans: Exactly. So Nate and I
weren't really talking, not for any reason
... So one day he calls me up, and right
before this I had talked to this guy, Bob
Hoag, who recorded our previous band,
and my plan was to record some songs by
myself with Bob and find someone to sing
them later 'cause i can't sing ... and on
the phone Nate happened to say ...
"Hey we should get together with Bob
and do some songs," and I'm like...
"Well I already have some time sched
uled with Bob, so let's do it."
tam i am 927: Carpe diem,
mrsammeans: So yeah, we did the EP, it
did really well, started getting radio play
on The Edge — that got (us) more atten
tion. Elektra signed us in October, we
started recording the end of January,
stopped April Ist, went on tour fora
month, came back, and here we are.
Sam's new personal goals:
mrsammeans: I'm trying to teach myself
piano; it's so hard. My problem is: It's
hard getting to the point where I mess
around with it enough that I learn how to
do something, but once I figure it otit,
I'm really good at it, like I figured out a
good hand pattern for like .. . ragtimey
kinda stuff, and I'm good at that now, but
it's driving people crazy, so I need to
move on.
tam i am 927: Give them earplugs,
mrsammeans: It's my favorite — like the
guys at Disneyland that play by the food
court, the dixieland stuff,
tam i am 927: Have I told you that I've
played the piano at Disneyland in New
Orleans square a couple of times before?
mrsammeans: No way. No way.
tam i am 927: With the straw hats,
mrsammeans: The old jazzy guys are so
awesome!
tam i am 927: The piano that's all old and
out of tune-y.
mrsammeans: The guys in the bow ties
and the striped shirts — are you as good
as them? Can you play that stuff? Wow,
I'd love to do that. That's great. I want to
be amazing at piano. Thats basically my
goal in life.
tam i am 927: Favorite things?

mrsammeans: The "Amelie" soundtrack
is great.
mrsammeans: Homestarrunner is great.
Keeping it real:
tam i am 927: How have you dealt with all
the buzz that you two have created with
The Format and your music? How did
you know it would work out, with all the
fake people in the industry exploiting
bands these days, for all the money that
they're worth?
mrsammeans: It's just uncomfortable
not knowing, but I'm trying not to worry,
tam i am 927: We take it as a given that
lake people exist and that they have to
"shmooze."
mrsammeans: Definitely, yeah. Well, you
have to be somewhat of an actor in this
business, but you have to stay real inside,
which is why this whole thing is so hard
for me. Neither Nate or myself are good
at being in the spotlight. Now we're
forced to be the center of attention and
make all these people happy. I need to
think about it — writing songs, playing
songs and staying happy,
tam i am 927: How old are you?
mrsammeans: I'm 23 now. My birthday
was today / yesterday — went out to din
ner with the guys recording our CD and
Nate.
tam i am 927: Did they toast "to Sam and
many more years of greatness and
longevity!"
mrsammeans: Yes, I think they did. Ac
tually, I've never been much of a party/
present person. (This is that) second year
I've been in the studio on my birthday.
It's like a new tradition.

Higher learning:
mrsammeans: I was basically just gonna
say that academics are pretty pointless in
reality.
tam i am 927: "Don't let schooling get in
the way of your education."
mrsammeans: Exactly. I mean it's good
for people who need it for their profes
sion, but when it all comes down to it, you
learn more just living than you ever could
going to school. I'm all for school, but it's
not for me, so I didn't go after a year. I
