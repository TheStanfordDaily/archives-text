# So long Roxy Sass: Here's the best of the bad
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
It's hard to believe this year is almost over, that it's
time for old Roxy to pack up and go. But I'll be back.
Until then, enjoy these delicious pieces of wisdom from
this year:
Stanford dating:
The real question here is: Why is it so hard? (Or is it
HARD at all? Or just permanently limp?) In the real
world, men ask women on dates. At Stanford, men make
eye contact with women as they leave Stern Dining.
Then they go home to quiedy play with themselves
under the covers and hope their roommate playing
video games does not notice. WHY??? WHY????
The answer is not just that Stanford men are busy, so
cially stunted by academic achievement or scared. What
it really comes down to is that Stanford is too small of a
school for casual dating to occur. Unless it is a blatandy
drunk one-night stand, the assumption is that after one
date you will automatically be in a serious, committed
long-term relationship where you will be expected to cut
your course load to take the necessary 5-unit "girlfriend"
class.
It's the first full moon, you know what that means ...
Oh, how to describe the glorious sketchfest that is Full
Moon on the Quad? It's the potent combination of un
dergraduate hormones, a fetching midnight moon and
tradition. Where everyone is intoxicated in some way or
another; where a mob mentality ofblithe horniness over
takes freshman and senior alike; where the last people
you'd ever want to see naked are.
... But that's the simple beauty of Full Moon on the
Quad. Stripped bare of the pretense, all acts of physical
attraction — whether at a party, on a date or in bed —
are just plain awkward. Instead of being embarrassed by
it, why not celebrate our gaucherie in this jubilant, or
giastic, chaotic display?

On geek sex:
To some, the words "geek" and "sex" may be mutual
ly exclusive, never even to appear in the same sentence.
But this girl knows that on Stanford campus, the Land of
a Thousand Geeks, geeks having sex and sexy geeks
abound ... Forget your embarrassment. Geeks love
dress-up! So will you when your geek thanks you in all
sorts of delightful ways. Just don't be surprised when the
neighbors complain about you screaming, "Oh, Christ of
[or some other made-up name of his choosing] of Clan
Brujah, TAKE ME!" as you claw his back.
Not as bad as SARS, but close:
Serial monogamy is spreading through the halls of
Stanford as we speak, and its symptoms are distinct.
Victims suffer from acute delusions — most no
tably, the perceived need to couple. Healthy individu
als know the truth. Kidneys, Internet connection, den
tal floss: All these things are needs, having a boyfriend

or girlfriend is not.
Hook-up hints:
If you want to hook-up with someone, stop being so
damned lazy. It's not like a hook-up will magically hap
pen if you don't put in any effort. Unless, of course, you
are either freakishly hot or a female.
If two people hook up in the forest and neither is sober
enough to fully remember it, do they make a sound?
Ah, the eternal question — if there are witnesses to
the pre-hook-up shenanigans, then you can't deny
your way out of it regardless of your sporadic black
outs. You can, however, say that you were "sooo
drunk" that even though you wanted to get on him /
her at the time, you didn't completely understand
what the hell was going on. Of course people could say
you were just using alcohol to let yourself do what you
secretly wanted to do all along but didn't have the guts
to do sober. And they'd probably be right. But what
can you do, really? People are always talking shit like
that.
What is the plural form of penis, exactly?
On any given Saturday night, most of us encounter
penises that measure close to six inches, about the size of
an unwrapped Butterfinger bar. Anything significandy
larger is met with an equal mix of trepidation and fasci
nation. No need to fear ladies, the vagina is clinically de
fined like real estate, "a space" that just happens to be
surrounded by muscles and tissues. It may take an entire
tube of Astroglide, but he will be able to squeeze it in
there.
Roxy's last words (for now):
Thank you readers for your interest in this column. I
have sincerely tried to teach, inform, titillate and amuse.
My relationship with you has exceeded any other, and
writing for you has meant a great deal to me. Have a hot,
fling-filled summer — you know that Roxy will.
