Death, or rather dead week,
comes as the end for Intermission,
volume 223. That's right, kids, just
like Buffy and just like those preco
cious kids from the Creek, we're
bowing out — what you hold in
your hot little hands is our swan
song, our series finale as editors.
We have mixed feelings about leav
ing Intermission behind us. Before
Intermission, there was life, and
after Intermission there was ...
Intermission. But new possibilities
lie before us now: hours and hours
of time to waste outside the Daily
office, technology that surpasses
the Microsoft Word 5.1 on Inter
mission's temperamental Mac, the
ability to observe an extra comma
or full space in lieu of a half-space
without panic. All these things
leave us with much joy.
But there's sadness too. We ed
itors have gotten curiously at
tached to baby Intermission and
letting her go is a difficult task.

Luckily, our replacements, Nicole
Beckley and Karan Mahajan, have
lessened this anguish consider
ably. They've demonstrated that
they have what it takes to keep In
termission kicking. We only hope
we can leave them with the wis
dom that our predecessors left us
— like how to microwave CDs to
create a neat mini light show or
how to fill ad space with pictures of
cheerleading greyhounds.
Also, the creative geniuses re
sponsible for Intermission's amaz
ing layout, cover and graphics
aren't going anywhere. They
tried, but we wouldn't let them. So
now they're chained to the mas
sive office printer. Major shout
outs are due to ChenLi, Beth and
Duran for the hours and hours of
time they have put into layout,
cover design and typesetting, re
spectively. Without them, Inter
mission would look like crap. And
thanks to our editorial staff,
Megan and Ramin, for always
poring over our galleys with due

diligence and trying to laugh po
litely at our lame jokes.
But even if Intermission were
scrawled on a cardboard box, the
writing would still rock. We've
sent writers to movies, film festi
vals, concerts, fortunetellers, con
ventions and interviews; we've set
them up on blind dates and
shoved them off planes. And each
time they come back with a shiny
sparkly gem of an article that you
are lucky enough to read. Writers,
your talent and good looks have
humbled and inspired us tremen
dously this volume. Thank you for
making our work so fun and easy.
And to our favorite writer, Roxy
Sass, who always puts out: the
road of love and life may be diffi
cult, but your spunk makes it all
the more worthwhile.
And of course, we have to thank
you, dear reader, for reading this
crazy fanzine of ours (as dearly de
parted Intermission editor Ryan
Sands once put it). We hope that In
termission has brought a little

something extra into your life,
whether you're a freshman or a
grad student... or a grad student.
And if we inspired just one person
to buy a CD or movie ticket, well
shucks, our work wasn't for naught.
Life will go on for us, somehow,
without Intermission — Chris will
continue to spread his wisdom of
all things cinematic as an RA at
Kimball next year, and Jennie will
continue to watch TV nonstop

wherever she ends up. (Unless
she's in Europe —TV is weird
there.) Rest assured that even
without Intermission, we will re
main ardent pop-culture whores.
It's been our pleasure and privi
lege to serve up the finest in A & E
for the past volume, and we
promise we'll continue to force
our eclectic opinions and biases on
anyone who will listen for as long
as there is art to critique.
