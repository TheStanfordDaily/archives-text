# Class designs facility for Guatemalan town

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford architecture class is
playing a vital role in the construc
tion of a community center and
school in AmatiUan, Guatemala. De
signing all aspects of the project —
from dormitories to a church and
retreat center — these students will
show their work at a professional
presentation to potential clients and
contributors on Monday.
The Guatemalan facility will be
a campus for the Center for the
Restoration of Women and the So
cially Disregarded, also referred to
as the CEREM project, after the
Christian organization sponsoring
its development. The center will
act as a residential center and
school for homeless children and
former prostitutes, as well as a
church and place of retreat.
Currently, students are working
on designs for residential units for
simulated nuclear families. These
families will be composed of one
"mother" figure and seven to nine
children of different age groups.
Additionally, the retreat center will
serve as a resource for training res
idents in hotel administration, culi
nary arts and art studio.
"fl he center] seeks to rehabili
tate prostitutes, war widows, or
phans, gang members and other
victims of Guatemala's poverty
through education, discipline,
hard work and, most importantly,
faith," said sophomore Ben
Palmquist, a sophomore who is in
volved in designing housing for
the facility. "Because CEREM is a

wholly Guatemalan organization,
it should work very well within the
community and embrace local cul
ture appropriately."
Students in the class are very
concerned about proposing de
signs that are consistent with the
Guatemalan culture and local sur
roundings. All designs must use
building materials available in the
local area including concrete block,
corrugated aluminum and cypress.
"The architecture is to reflect the
indigenous culture and the pre
scribed program while using indige
nous materials in new and creative
or experimental ways and enhanc
ing programmatic requirements,"
said Margajann, who teaches the ar
chitecture class. "[For example], if
victims become abusers, dormitory
space must allow for maximum visi
bility while creating a sense of priva
cy for each individual child."
In addition to artistic and cul
tural components of the structure,
students must also consider the
feasibility of their designs, includ
ing entries, exits, heating, ventila
tion, privacy and electricity.
"The perpetual challenge is to
reconcile artistic flourishes with
practicality, making the houses as
safe, comfortable and livable as
possible," Palmquist said. "We not
only bring our architectural skills
to the table, but also experience
with business, fine arts, diverse cul
tures and the environment."
The environment might pose an
even larger challenge, as many stu
dents have to consider the site's ter
