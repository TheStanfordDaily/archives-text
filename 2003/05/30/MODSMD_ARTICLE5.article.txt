# Class designs facility for Guatemalan town
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford architecture class is
playing a vital role in the construc
tion of a community center and
school in AmatiUan, Guatemala. De
signing all aspects of the project —
from dormitories to a church and
retreat center — these students will
show their work at a professional
presentation to potential clients and
contributors on Monday.
The Guatemalan facility will be
a campus for the Center for the
Restoration of Women and the So
cially Disregarded, also referred to
as the CEREM project, after the
Christian organization sponsoring
its development. The center will
act as a residential center and
school for homeless children and
former prostitutes, as well as a
church and place of retreat.
Currently, students are working
on designs for residential units for
simulated nuclear families. These
families will be composed of one
"mother" figure and seven to nine
children of different age groups.
Additionally, the retreat center will
serve as a resource for training res
idents in hotel administration, culi
nary arts and art studio.
"fl he center] seeks to rehabili
tate prostitutes, war widows, or
phans, gang members and other
victims of Guatemala's poverty
through education, discipline,
hard work and, most importantly,
faith," said sophomore Ben
Palmquist, a sophomore who is in
volved in designing housing for
the facility. "Because CEREM is a

wholly Guatemalan organization,
it should work very well within the
community and embrace local cul
ture appropriately."
Students in the class are very
concerned about proposing de
signs that are consistent with the
Guatemalan culture and local sur
roundings. All designs must use
building materials available in the
local area including concrete block,
corrugated aluminum and cypress.
"The architecture is to reflect the
indigenous culture and the pre
scribed program while using indige
nous materials in new and creative
or experimental ways and enhanc
ing programmatic requirements,"
said Margajann, who teaches the ar
chitecture class. "[For example], if
victims become abusers, dormitory
space must allow for maximum visi
bility while creating a sense of priva
cy for each individual child."
In addition to artistic and cul
tural components of the structure,
students must also consider the
feasibility of their designs, includ
ing entries, exits, heating, ventila
tion, privacy and electricity.
"The perpetual challenge is to
reconcile artistic flourishes with
practicality, making the houses as
safe, comfortable and livable as
possible," Palmquist said. "We not
only bring our architectural skills
to the table, but also experience
with business, fine arts, diverse cul
tures and the environment."
The environment might pose an
even larger challenge, as many stu
dents have to consider the site's ter
rain in designing their structures.
"The build site is cleared and
slightly sloping," said Scott Silli
man, the project's contractor.
"The most difficult aspect may be
the drainage from the uphill land
which flows through a portion of
the property, and the design will
have to work around this."
Silliman joined several students
in the class on a trip to Guatemala
to view the site in April. Students
said that the trip played an essen
tial role in helping them envision
the project's eventual shape.
"It was important fora number
of practical reasons, but more im
portantly it served as a source of in
spirations," Palmquist said. "After
having seen the extreme poverty
in Guatemala first-hand, and after
hearing stories of the residents of
CEREM's existing center for
teenage boys, even the most stoic
members of the group had a hard
time fighting back the tears.
"We all came back with a new
sense of purpose," he added.
"We're not just working fora class.
It's much more than that — much
more real."
According to senior Liz Kwo,
one of the class' teaching assis
tants, a need for the center has ex
isted for several years. She ex
pressed her hope that the site will
open its doors within two years.
"One of the amazing things
about CEREM is the people who
started it," said Luis Trujillo, an
other teaching assistant who is also
acting as the client representative
responsible for communicating
the facility's needs to student de
signers. "They have really chal
lenged me to give all that I have.
You don't do this because you feel
sorry for these people, but rather
you do it out of love for them and
the potential that you see in
them."
According to Jann, the archi
tecture class gives students an un
paralleled opportunity that many
graduate students are not offered.
"We, as students have a
tremendous learning experience
most undergraduates could never
dream of," Palmquist said. "On
the flip side, we are able to provide
a service to non-profits in the de
veloping world that they could
never otherwise afford."
Some students even plan to re
turn to the site in Guatemala dur
ing the summer of 2004 to help in
the construction. Designs are
turned in and presented as the
class' final project.
These presentations are open
to the public and will take place in
Wallenberg Hall from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. on Monday.

show their work at a professional
presentation to potential clients and
contributors on Monday.
The Guatemalan facility will be
a campus for the Center for the
Restoration of Women and the So
cially Disregarded, also referred to
as the CEREM project, after the
Christian organization sponsoring
its development. The center will
act as a residential center and
school for homeless children and
former prostitutes, as well as a
church and place of retreat.
Currently, students are working
on designs for residential units for
simulated nuclear families. These
families will be composed of one
"mother" figure and seven to nine
children of different age groups.
Additionally, the retreat center will
serve as a resource for training res
idents in hotel administration, culi
nary arts and art studio.
"fl he center] seeks to rehabili
tate prostitutes, war widows, or
phans, gang members and other
victims of Guatemala's poverty
through education, discipline,
hard work and, most importantly,
faith," said sophomore Ben
Palmquist, a sophomore who is in
volved in designing housing for
the facility. "Because CEREM is a

wholly Guatemalan organization,
it should work very well within the
community and embrace local cul
ture appropriately."
Students in the class are very
concerned about proposing de
signs that are consistent with the
Guatemalan culture and local sur
roundings. All designs must use
building materials available in the
local area including concrete block,
corrugated aluminum and cypress.
"The architecture is to reflect the
indigenous culture and the pre
scribed program while using indige
nous materials in new and creative
or experimental ways and enhanc
ing programmatic requirements,"
said Margajann, who teaches the ar
chitecture class. "[For example], if
victims become abusers, dormitory
space must allow for maximum visi
bility while creating a sense of priva
cy for each individual child."
In addition to artistic and cul
tural components of the structure,
students must also consider the
feasibility of their designs, includ
ing entries, exits, heating, ventila
tion, privacy and electricity.
"The perpetual challenge is to
reconcile artistic flourishes with
practicality, making the houses as
safe, comfortable and livable as
possible," Palmquist said. "We not
only bring our architectural skills
to the table, but also experience
with business, fine arts, diverse cul
tures and the environment."
The environment might pose an
even larger challenge, as many stu
dents have to consider the site's ter
rain in designing their structures.
"The build site is cleared and
slightly sloping," said Scott Silli
man, the project's contractor.
"The most difficult aspect may be
the drainage from the uphill land
which flows through a portion of
the property, and the design will
have to work around this."
Silliman joined several students
in the class on a trip to Guatemala
to view the site in April. Students
said that the trip played an essen
tial role in helping them envision
the project's eventual shape.
"It was important fora number
of practical reasons, but more im
portantly it served as a source of in
spirations," Palmquist said. "After
having seen the extreme poverty
in Guatemala first-hand, and after
hearing stories of the residents of
CEREM's existing center for
teenage boys, even the most stoic
members of the group had a hard
time fighting back the tears.
"We all came back with a new
sense of purpose," he added.
"We're not just working fora class.
It's much more than that — much
more real."
According to senior Liz Kwo,
one of the class' teaching assis
tants, a need for the center has ex
isted for several years. She ex
pressed her hope that the site will
open its doors within two years.
"One of the amazing things
about CEREM is the people who
started it," said Luis Trujillo, an
other teaching assistant who is also
acting as the client representative
responsible for communicating
the facility's needs to student de
signers. "They have really chal
lenged me to give all that I have.
You don't do this because you feel
sorry for these people, but rather
you do it out of love for them and
the potential that you see in
them."
According to Jann, the archi
tecture class gives students an un
paralleled opportunity that many
graduate students are not offered.
"We, as students have a
tremendous learning experience
most undergraduates could never
dream of," Palmquist said. "On
the flip side, we are able to provide
a service to non-profits in the de
veloping world that they could
never otherwise afford."
Some students even plan to re
turn to the site in Guatemala dur
ing the summer of 2004 to help in
the construction. Designs are
turned in and presented as the
class' final project.
These presentations are open
to the public and will take place in
Wallenberg Hall from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. on Monday.
