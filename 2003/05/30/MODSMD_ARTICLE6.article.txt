# Students, Hennessy to talk after fast relocates
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Six students from the Coalition for
Labor Justice moved their hunger fast
from the Main Quad to the front of El Cen
tro Chicano yesterday afternoon after
being told to leave by the University ad
ministration for violating Stanford's policy
on use of the Quad.
President John Hennessy has agreed to
meet with six representatives of the coali
tion — which is asking for the creation of a
code of conduct that would apply to all
workers at Stanford — at 2 p.m. today.
"President Hennessy would not agree
to a meeting with [the students] while they
were still in violation of campus policy,"
said Gordon Earle, the University's vice
president for public affairs.
Shortly after the hunger strike began
on Wednesday afternoon, students deliv
ered a letter to administrators both in
forming them of the strike and asking for
a meeting with Hennessy. The students
were not contacted by the administration
until being approached by Associate Dean
of Students Morris Graves, who told them
that Hennessy would not meet until they
left the Quad. Graves also told the students
that they were in violation of the Universi
ty's policy regarding the use of the Quad,
which could lead to disciplinary action.
"It's just really ridiculous that there's
such a slow administrative response," said
Hai Binh Nguyen, a sophomore. "We
didn't want to make the issue of where
we're going to be such a big deal — what
we want to get to is our demands, so we
chose to move."
Linda Tran, one of the fasting students,
said she started crying when Graves told
the students that they had to leave the
Quad.
"It took [the administration] 24 hours

and they didn't even try to talk to us at all,"
Tran said. "Almost 24 hours into it, and
they don't even address the issues that
we're out there for. They're placing school
policy and bureaucracy over student
health and workers' well-being."
Earle said that the administration had
not contacted students earlier because the
hunger strike had begun so late on the
previous day.
"We really didn't become aware of it
until the end of the day,"he said. "It took
us a few hours the following morning to
put together the necessary documenta
tion, which we gave to the students."
One of the concerns that coalition
members had with moving the strike to
White Plaza was the high traffic of the
new location.
"There's a lot more shade out [in the
Quad]," Nguyen said. "It's a lot less stress
ful [there]. People come to go to class and
stuff, but there's only a five- or 10-minute
slot. In White Plaza, people pass by there
all the time, and there's always events
going on in White Plaza . . . These stu
dents are going to get tired."
Tran, a freshman, echoed Nguyen's
concerns, but also saw benefits to the
move.
"It's more strategic now, because now
we're visible," she said. "[People] can't ig
nore that this is going on, so they can't turn
a blind eye. They can move us anywhere,
but the principles are still there."
Earle said that despite the disagree
ments over the University's labor policies,
administrators remain concerned about
the students' well-being.
"[We] hope that they don't do anything
to injure their health," he said. "One ad
vantage of White Plaza is that it's closer to
the Vaden Health Center should any med-
