# Hamburg tackles bioterrorism risk
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
In yesterday's lecture "Bioterrorism: A Challenge
to Science and Security," Dr. Margaret Hamburg,
vice president for biological programs at the Nuclear
Threat Initiative in Washington, D.C., told an audi
ence of approximately 100 people that the threat of
bioterrorist attacks calls fora "greater coordination of
effort" among professionals from varying fields.
"We need to define new priorities, form new part
nerships and make new investments," Hamburg said.
" The strategies [against bioterrorism] need to be
broad and multidisciplinary."
Hamburg's address — which was this year's annu
al Drell Lecture and was sponsored by the Center for
International Security and Cooperation — came
three weeks after the Department of Health and
Human Services announced the guidelines for its
$ 1.4 billion bioterrorism cooperative agreement pro
gram for states, territories and municipalities. The
program is intended to help state and local govern
ments improve public health infrastructure and
health care systems.
"We're not doing enough to help the medical com
munity deal with a crisis," she said. "This is one of the
most important factors."

Dr. Margaret Hamburg discusses the need for greater cooperation and coordination between
authorities in order to properly deal with the threat that bioterrorism poses to the population.
Hamburg added, "We've al
lowed the public health care sys
tem to deteriorate."
She noted that a significant im
provement would require "dra
matically increased and sustained
investments."
Hamburg explained that such
investments in the existing public
health infrastructures would in
crease the "ability to rapidly detect
and investigate clusters of unusual
symptoms" and help combat
bioterrorism.
"There is a critical need to pro
vide appropriate training [for doc
tors]," Hamburg said. "SARS is a
powerful reminder of our vulnera
bility. We've seen just how easily
health care systems can be over
whelmed."
Hamburg emphasized that
not only the "needs of personnel
and health care workers must
also be addressed," but that the
country must also maintain
"clear communication and ap
propriate engagement with the
public."
She cited the importance of the
media in keeping the public in
formed of public health threats.
"There must be a clear plan for
providing the media with accurate
and timely information," she said.
In addition to improving health
care in the United States, Ham
burg added that the threat of

bioterrorism also called for"a re
newed and ongoing commitment
to global health."
"Bioterrorism is an internation
al concern," she said, "and it has to
be addressed internationally."
Hamburg also noted that along
with the cooperation of doctors,
public health officials and policy
makers, the cooperation of med
ical researchers is important.
"There is an urgent need for
biomedical expertise to enhance
analysis of information [about ter
rorists]," she said.
She discussed how research
could help deter a biological at
tack, but also presented the possi
bility of a researcher's results being
misused.
"There are instances when in
formation doesn't need to be pub
lished to achieve the overall bene
fits of the work having been done,"
she said. "I don't think it could be
regulated, but there are systems of
review [to determine how much of
a review to publish]."
Hamburg explained that the
importance of preparing fora
bioterrorist attack was exemplified
not only by the recent SARS epi
demic, but also by the anthrax
cases which were reported after
Sept. 11,2001.
"The [anthrax] attacks were
enormously costly, and we were
unprepared on every level," Ham
burg said. "Although our nation
has experienced our first bioter
rorist attack, we cannot assume our
policy makers understand the
threat that looms."
