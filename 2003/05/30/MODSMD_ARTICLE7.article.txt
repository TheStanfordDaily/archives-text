# Hamburg tackles bioterrorism risk
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
In yesterday's lecture "Bioterrorism: A Challenge
to Science and Security," Dr. Margaret Hamburg,
vice president for biological programs at the Nuclear
Threat Initiative in Washington, D.C., told an audi
ence of approximately 100 people that the threat of
bioterrorist attacks calls fora "greater coordination of
effort" among professionals from varying fields.
"We need to define new priorities, form new part
nerships and make new investments," Hamburg said.
" The strategies [against bioterrorism] need to be
broad and multidisciplinary."
Hamburg's address — which was this year's annu
al Drell Lecture and was sponsored by the Center for
International Security and Cooperation — came
three weeks after the Department of Health and
Human Services announced the guidelines for its
$ 1.4 billion bioterrorism cooperative agreement pro
gram for states, territories and municipalities. The
program is intended to help state and local govern
ments improve public health infrastructure and
health care systems.
"We're not doing enough to help the medical com
munity deal with a crisis," she said. "This is one of the
most important factors."
