# Fac Sen to discuss recommended GER changes
## 
### MIKEY LEE JENNIFER GRAHAM STAFF WRITERS 
At its next meeting, the Faculty Senate will
discuss and vote on the recommendation of the
Subcommittee on General Education Require
ments to make several changes to the General
Education Requirements, effective as of the
2004-2005 academic year.
Ilie biggest proposed change is to require stu
dents to take one course in each of the three Area

II sub-areas: natural sciences, applied sciences
and mathematics. CurrentJy, undergraduates are
required to take three courses in Area II with no
more than two courses in the same sub-area.
"The committee believes each area is desir
able and should be required," reads the sub
committee's report.
The other major change would be to drop
the requirement that Academic Council mem
bers must teach a course for it to be certified for
an Area 11, 111 or IV GER.

The subcommittee is also recommending that
the changesllvx v made to the way GER-certified
courses are chosen to expand the number offered.
One proposed change to Areas II and 111 is to
allow any courses offered by specified departments
count toward the appropriate sub-area. 'Hie re
port also calls for discussions on implementing a
moral reasoning requirement be instituted.
The Committee on Undergraduate Stan-
clards and Policy, which the Sub
committee on General Education
Requirements reported to, has rec
ommended that the senate ap
prove the proposed changes.
The evolution of GERs
It was only a decade ago when
General Education Requirements
were known as "distribution re
quirements." The 1994 Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
which issued the biggest changes to
the face of Stanford's academic
structure in the last quarter centu
ry, was created by then-University
President Gerhard Casper.
In first half of the 19905, a Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education
was given the task of evaluating
strengths and drawbacks of the un
dergraduate curriculum. After finish
ing its work in 1994, the committee
made a series of recommendations.
The revamping of the distribu
tion requirements came as a result
of student and faculty sentiment
that they were too "cumbersome
and incoherent," according to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies' Guidelines for Certifica
tion and for Oversight of Courses
Fulfilling the General Education
Requirements. The guidelines also
included "[encouraging] greater
coherence in the programs of
courses students choose."
Expanding options for Area 111
and IV GERs
According to University Regis

trar Roger Printup, that challenge
of increasing the availability of cer
tain GER classes — especially in
Area IV: World Cultures, American
Cultures and Gender Studies — is
still a factor in how the University
determines which classes qualify.
"There are three different
processes," Printup said. "There ex
ists a faculty committee for Area I:
Introduction to the Humanities. In
Areas II and 111, the academic de
partments submit the courses they
want to their cognizant dean. The
cognizant dean makes the final deci
sion whether to accept those courses.
In Area IV, there is a subcommittee
of the Committee of U ndergi aduate
Standards and Policy that receives
recommendations either from de
partments or individuals."
Area IV, which dropped its re
quirement down from three classes
to two after the commission made
its recommendation, still remains
the most scrutinized GER area.
"There's a description that says
that 'the content of the course has
to meet the spirit of what that
course is,' " Printup said. "Areas
I Va, IVb and I Vc are probably the
ones where figuring out what
those requirements mean has
proved to be the most challenging,
because there are not as many
choices for students to complete
the requirements in those areas."
According to the subcommit
tee's report, "The number of stu
dents who petition the registrar
each year to substitute other cours
es for those on the approved list for
Area IV is greater than the num
ber who petition for any other area
requirement."
While Printup acknowledged
that the selection of courses of
fered in Area IV is not very large,

he says the University is working to
increase that number, based on
the recommendations that the
subcommittee receives.
"There are certainly more
courses [in Area IV] than, say, five
or six years ago," Printup said.
The subcommittee's report rec
ommends that the process for certi
fying Area IV GERs be changed by
having the directors of six interde
partmental programs recommend
courses to the cognizant dean.
"In effect, the system now in place
for Areas II and 111 would be adopt
ed for Area IV," the report reads.
"Not every course in each program
would be a suitable candidate for the
General Education Requirements
list and so some vetting of courses is
still required . . . Such a system
would increase the number of cours
es listed in Area IV dramatically."
The report also calls for the sub
committee to take on the task of
"revisiting and clarifying the crite
ria for Area IV" next year.
Additionally, the subcommit
tee's report recommends that
courses qualifying for the Area 111
GER be changed to "all" courses in
the departments designated
under each sub-area, humanities
and social sciences, as opposed to
the current system where specific
courses are selected.
"fW]hen we define each GER
sub-area mainly as a list of depart
ments, we are moving away from
our current characterization of GER
courses by certain desirable features
of these courses," reads the response
of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policy to the sub
committee's report. "However, it
should be noted that we would not
be changing our stated rationale for
the liberal education we offer."

Area IV, which dropped its re
quirement down from three classes
to two after the commission made
its recommendation, still remains
the most scrutinized GER area.
"There's a description that says
that 'the content of the course has
to meet the spirit of what that
course is,' " Printup said. "Areas
I Va, IVb and I Vc are probably the
ones where figuring out what
those requirements mean has
proved to be the most challenging,
because there are not as many
choices for students to complete
the requirements in those areas."
According to the subcommit
tee's report, "The number of stu
dents who petition the registrar
each year to substitute other cours
es for those on the approved list for
Area IV is greater than the num
ber who petition for any other area
requirement."
While Printup acknowledged
that the selection of courses of
fered in Area IV is not very large,

he says the University is working to
increase that number, based on
the recommendations that the
subcommittee receives.
"There are certainly more
courses [in Area IV] than, say, five
or six years ago," Printup said.
The subcommittee's report rec
ommends that the process for certi
fying Area IV GERs be changed by
having the directors of six interde
partmental programs recommend
courses to the cognizant dean.
"In effect, the system now in place
for Areas II and 111 would be adopt
ed for Area IV," the report reads.
"Not every course in each program
would be a suitable candidate for the
General Education Requirements
list and so some vetting of courses is
still required . . . Such a system
would increase the number of cours
es listed in Area IV dramatically."
The report also calls for the sub
committee to take on the task of
"revisiting and clarifying the crite
ria for Area IV" next year.
Additionally, the subcommit
tee's report recommends that
courses qualifying for the Area 111
GER be changed to "all" courses in
the departments designated
under each sub-area, humanities
and social sciences, as opposed to
the current system where specific
courses are selected.
"fW]hen we define each GER
sub-area mainly as a list of depart
ments, we are moving away from
our current characterization of GER
courses by certain desirable features
of these courses," reads the response
of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policy to the sub
committee's report. "However, it
should be noted that we would not
be changing our stated rationale for
the liberal education we offer."
At its next meeting, the Faculty Senate will
discuss and vote on the recommendation of the
Subcommittee on General Education Require
ments to make several changes to the General
Education Requirements, effective as of the
2004-2005 academic year.
Ilie biggest proposed change is to require stu
dents to take one course in each of the three Area

II sub-areas: natural sciences, applied sciences
and mathematics. CurrentJy, undergraduates are
required to take three courses in Area II with no
more than two courses in the same sub-area.
"The committee believes each area is desir
able and should be required," reads the sub
committee's report.
The other major change would be to drop
the requirement that Academic Council mem
bers must teach a course for it to be certified for
an Area 11, 111 or IV GER.

The subcommittee is also recommending that
the changesllvx v made to the way GER-certified
courses are chosen to expand the number offered.
One proposed change to Areas II and 111 is to
allow any courses offered by specified departments
count toward the appropriate sub-area. 'Hie re
port also calls for discussions on implementing a
moral reasoning requirement be instituted.
The Committee on Undergraduate Stan-
clards and Policy, which the Sub
committee on General Education
Requirements reported to, has rec
ommended that the senate ap
prove the proposed changes.
The evolution of GERs
It was only a decade ago when
General Education Requirements
were known as "distribution re
quirements." The 1994 Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
which issued the biggest changes to
the face of Stanford's academic
structure in the last quarter centu
ry, was created by then-University
President Gerhard Casper.
In first half of the 19905, a Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education
was given the task of evaluating
strengths and drawbacks of the un
dergraduate curriculum. After finish
ing its work in 1994, the committee
made a series of recommendations.
The revamping of the distribu
tion requirements came as a result
of student and faculty sentiment
that they were too "cumbersome
and incoherent," according to the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies' Guidelines for Certifica
tion and for Oversight of Courses
Fulfilling the General Education
Requirements. The guidelines also
included "[encouraging] greater
coherence in the programs of
courses students choose."
Expanding options for Area 111
and IV GERs
According to University Regis

trar Roger Printup, that challenge
of increasing the availability of cer
tain GER classes — especially in
Area IV: World Cultures, American
Cultures and Gender Studies — is
still a factor in how the University
determines which classes qualify.
"There are three different
processes," Printup said. "There ex
ists a faculty committee for Area I:
Introduction to the Humanities. In
Areas II and 111, the academic de
partments submit the courses they
want to their cognizant dean. The
cognizant dean makes the final deci
sion whether to accept those courses.
In Area IV, there is a subcommittee
of the Committee of U ndergi aduate
Standards and Policy that receives
recommendations either from de
partments or individuals."
Area IV, which dropped its re
quirement down from three classes
to two after the commission made
its recommendation, still remains
the most scrutinized GER area.
"There's a description that says
that 'the content of the course has
to meet the spirit of what that
course is,' " Printup said. "Areas
I Va, IVb and I Vc are probably the
ones where figuring out what
