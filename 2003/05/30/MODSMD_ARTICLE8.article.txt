discuss and vote on the recommendation of the
Subcommittee on General Education Require

Education Requirements, effective as of the
2004-2005 academic year.
Ilie biggest proposed change is to require stu
dents to take one course in each of the three Area

II sub-areas: natural sciences, applied sciences
and mathematics. CurrentJy, undergraduates are
required to take three courses in Area II with no
more than two courses in the same sub-area.
"The committee believes each area is desir
able and should be required," reads the sub
committee's report.
The other major change would be to drop
the requirement that Academic Council mem

an Area 11, 111 or IV GER.

The subcommittee is also recommending that
the changesllvx v made to the way GER-certified
courses are chosen to expand the number offered.
One proposed change to Areas II and 111 is to
allow any courses offered by specified departments
count toward the appropriate sub-area. 'Hie re
port also calls for discussions on implementing a
moral reasoning requirement be instituted.
