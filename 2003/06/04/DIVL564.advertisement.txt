Baccalaureate is a student-led celebration that acknowledges the spiritual and religious
contributions to the education of Stanford graduates. The service gives the university the
opportunity to express gratitude for those whose lives are dedicated to sustaining
this mission—students, families, faculty, staff, administrators and trustees.
The Baccalaureate service is comprised of music and readings from a variety of
religious traditions, reflecting on this important life passage.
The Baccalaureate Address will be given by
Dr. Bryan Hehir
President of Catholic Charities USA and Distinguished Professcy of Ethics and
International Affairs at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.
The Baccalaureate Student Address will be given by
Valarie Kaur Brar, Stanford '03
International Relations and Religious Studies major.
The Senior Class Presidents will be present and Talisman, Stanford Taiko,
and the Menlo Brass Quintet will perform.
Graduating students should come with their caps and gowns and meet inside Memorial
Church at 8:45 am so that they can be a part of the Baccalaureate procession.
Please call the Office for Religious Life at 723-1762 during business hours for details.
