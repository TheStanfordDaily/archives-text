RENEWABLE ENERGY
Palo Alto residents and businesses can sign
up now for an extraordinary energy program
called PaloAltoGreen. This new program
from the City of Palo Alto Utilities offers the
option of 100% renewable energy at some
of the lowest rates in the nation. The energy
comes from wind — clean, renewable, ours
to inherit and ours to bequeath.
INHERIT THE WIND
Like recycling, PaloAltoGreen enables you to
take responsibility for your individual impact
on the environment. You help clean our air
by reducing the need to burn fossil fuel.
Your energy will come from new or recently
built, efficient, wildlife-friendly wind
generators. So when you buy green,
you build green.
LOW RATES
PaloAltoGreen rates are among the lowest
for wind power in the United States. For the
average home, the premium is about the
cost of a small pizza — $9.75 a month. Small
businesses pay the same as the residential
rate. For larger businesses, the premium is
$15 per 1,000-kilowatt-hour blocks per month.
SIMPLE TO ENROLL
Enrolling is simple, voluntary and reversible.
Visit our website at www.cpau.com, call
(650) 329-2161, or stop by our second
floor Customer Service Center at City Hall.
