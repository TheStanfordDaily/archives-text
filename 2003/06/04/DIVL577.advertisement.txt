The Odd Todd
Handbook:
Hard Times, Soft Couch
by Todd Rosenberg
Wednesday, June 4, 2003
12:00pm & 6:oopm
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
From the creator of the most popular Web site of all time,
oddtodd.com (ok, maybe not of ALL time), comes a guide to
living the laid-off life--whether you're actually unemployed or
just a connoisseur of doing absolutely nothing. Unemployed since
June of 2001, Odd Todd now spends his time watching TV, taking
powernaps, spacing out, snacking, updating his Web site daily,
and doing...stuff. THE ODD TODD HANDBOOK is chock full of ways
to spend time when you can't spend any mon-ay. We'll start at
dawn-ish and go through a whole day all the way to Odd Todd's
late-night insomnia attack at 2:30 a.m. THE ODD TODD HANDBOOK
chronicles Odd Todd's lottery fantasies, thoughts about writing
screenplays (samples included), cheap and "too easy" recipes
(samples included), dealing with mom and dad, dream analysis,
socializing with "working folk," getting free stuff, and sneaky
(and lazy) job search techniques. There are games, puzzles, a
glossary with lingo for the unemployed, and lots of...stuff.
Whether you're unemployed or just strive to live the lifestyle,
Odd Todd will cover all the benefits of this exhilarating way of life.
