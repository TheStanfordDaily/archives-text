Project discusses Sikh Americans
As part of her senior honors thesis, Valarie
Raur developed "Targeting the Turban: Sikh
Americans after September 11," a documentary
that examines hate crimes against Sikh .Ameri
cans after Sept. 11, 2001 in order to understand
prejudice in America. She will show the film on
campus tomorrow.
"On Sept. 11, 2001, while all Americans
mourned their losses and feared terrorism from
abroad, new insecurities began to threaten certain
American minorities," Raur said. "Sikh, Muslim,
Arab, .Afghan and South Asian Americans con

fronted hate and violence in their own neighbor
hoods and lost civil liberties."
She added, "When growing up, I felt caught
between the immigrant Sikh community and the
larger American community, but now through
this project, I have used this position to move be
tween the two."
Kaur's findings and video clips from the docu
mentary will be released for the first time tomorrow
in Bldg. 2(>o-113 at 7 p.m. The documentary will be
formally released in the fall.
Freshman wins on 'Price is Right'
Freshmen Adrian Boscolo-High tower won
the showcase at "The Price is Right" while on a
dorm trip to Los Angeles last week. The show will
air Friday at 10 a.m. on CBS.

"I was really excited to go up on stage, but it
doesn't seem like it really happened, it feels like a
dream," said Hightower, a resident in Mirlo in
Florence Moore Hall. Hightower came away
from the show with over $22,000 in merchandise.
He won art supplies, a car kit, a coffee grinder,
eight umbrellas from Nordstrom, atrip for two to
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and a 2003 Jeep Wrangler.
Hightower's dorm received tickets for"The
Price is Right. On stage Hightower spun the wheel
and landed on 95 cents, giving him the closest spin
to a dollar. On the final showcase bid, I lightower
was $800 away from the right price; his competitor
was $ 1,400 off.
"It was common sense," Hightower said, in re
gards to his ability to bid well. He said audience
shouts reconfirmed his confidence in his estimates.
