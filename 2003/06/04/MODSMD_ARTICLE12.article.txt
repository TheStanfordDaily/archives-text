## Suspect pleads innocent in Ala. bombing 
### 
BI KM INC 111 AM, Ala. (AP) — Eric Rudolph,
the Olympic bombing suspect who told jailers
he survived five years on the run eating wild
game, acorns and lizards, pleaded innocent
yesterday in a deadly bombing at a Birming
ham abortion clinic.
Rudolph pleaded innocent before federal
Magistrate Judge Michael Putnam for the
bombing of New Woman All Women Health
Care, where an oil-duty police officer was killed
and a nurse critically injured on Jan. 29, 1998.
He could face the death penalty, but Assis
tant U.S. Attorney Michael Whisonant gave no
indication whether the government will seek
such a sentence.
The judge asked Rudolph whether he un
derstood the possible penalties, to which
Rudolph replied: "1 do, your honor."
Putnam set a trial date for Aug. 4 to comply
with federal laws requiring a speedy trail but said
it would likely be postponed because ofpre-trail
proceedings. He scheduled a June 10 hearing
on whether Rudolph can be released on bond.
Outside court, defense lawyer Richard Jaffe
said the public perception of Rudolph was "far
from accurate."
"It's going to take some time to sort out the
facts from the speculation and from the hearsay
and from t he public image that's been painted,"
said JafFe.
The 36-year-old former soldier and survival
ist is also accused in the 1996 Olympic park
bombing in Atlanta, where a woman was killed
and more than 100 were injured, and a pair ol
1997 bombings in Atlanta that rocked a lesbian
bar and a building with an abortion clinic.
Alter one of the most intense manhunts in
the nation's history, Rudolph was captured in
Murphy, N.C., early Saturday while looking for

food behind a supermarket.
Authorities in North Carolina said Rudolph
described his time as a fugitive as a struggle for
survival.
"He talked about the conditions being hard
at times," said Cherokee County Sheriff Keith
Lovin. "The first winter he about starved. He
said, 'It's kind of hard to live on acorns and
lizards."'
When he killed an animal, Lovin said,
Rudolph had to eat the meat for as long as he
could before it spoiled. He said Rudolph said
he also was able to dry some vegetables.
"He talked about foraging for supplies and
hunting," Lovin said. "Turkeys, wild boar,
bear, deer."

Lovin said Rudolph used a gun for hunting,
but would not say what type of gun it was or
whether authorities had located it.
But some law enforcement authorities were
skeptical of Rudolph's claims and suspect he
had help, particularly since he appeared
healthy with short hair and fairly clean clothes
and jogging shoes when he was arrested.
"It's surprising. I thought he'd come out
looking like Grizzly Adams," said Randy Chris
tian, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in
Birmingham.
Attorney General John Ashcroft decided
Rudolph would stand trial first in Birmingham,
saying that case offered the greatest chance of
success.
