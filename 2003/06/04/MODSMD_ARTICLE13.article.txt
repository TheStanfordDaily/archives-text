AL KHADER, West Bank
(AP) — Israel freed about 100
Palestinian prisoners yesterday in
a goodwill gesture ahead of a
Mideast peace summit with Presi
dent Bush. The oldest, convicted
of killing 13 Israelis, was greeted
upon his release with clasped
hands by Yasser Arafat.
Ahmad Jubarah, 68, was wel
comed by Arafat in a televised meet
ing clearly meant to send a message
that the Palestinian leader —de-
spite being banished from the sum
mit — was still in charge.
The summit today in the Jordan
ian resort of Aqaba marks the official
launch of the "road map," a three
year plan that aims to end 32 months
of violence and lead to t he creatk >n of
a Palestinian state by 2005.
At the meeting, Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon will issue a
statement accepting the principle
of a Palestinian state, an Israeli of
ficial said. His Palestinian counter
part, Mahmoud Abbas, will recog
nize Israel's right to exist side by
side with a Palestinian state, Pales
tinian officials said.
In the run-up to the meeting,
Israel eased some travel restric
tions on Palestinians, expanded
fishing rights in the Gaza Strip and
agreed to release a few of the esti
mated 7,000 Palestinians in Israeli
custody. The Israelis did not give
exact numbers.
As the two sides prepared for
the summit, violence peristed. Is
raeli troops killed a Palestinian po
liceman in the northern Gaza town

of Beit Hanoun, Palestinian doc
tors said. The army said soldiers
fired at armed Palestinians in a
prohibited zone.
In the village of A1 Khader near
Bethlehem, about a do/en released
prisoners, some of whom had been
jailed for weeks and others for
months or years, jumped off a bus,
kneeled on the ground and prayed.
Excited relatives ran past un
guarded concrete barriers to greet
the prisoners, all but one of whom
had been held without charges or
trial at the Ketziot, Ofer and
Megiddo military prisons, accord
ing to the army.
The exception was Jubarah,
who was released from the
Ashkelon prison in southern Is
rael, where he had been held for
nearly three decades for his role in
a 1975 Jerusalem bomb attack that
killed 13 people.
Many Israelis, including some
Cabinet ministers, objected to
Jubarah's release, saying it violat
ed Israel's principle of not freeing
prisoners directly involved in ter
ror attacks.
A crowd of cheering Palestini
ans hoisted Jubarah on their
shoulders, and he was driven to a
hotel to relax before meeting with
Arafat. He clasped hands with the
Palestinian leader as photogra
phers took their picture.
Arafat has not been invited to
the Jordan summit, part of U.S.
and Israeli efforts to isolate the
Palestinian leader, who Israel
blames for militant attacks.
