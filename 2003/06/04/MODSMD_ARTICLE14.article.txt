## Leaving the Farm Students take alternate paths to graduation 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
While the majority of the Class 0f2003 lias taken
the traditional four-year route to graduation, there
have been quite a few students who have followed
alternative paths to finishing school. According to
the Registrar's Olfice, over the past five years, only
about 77 percent of students graduated from Stan
lord in the traditional four years.
In contrast, 1 to 3 percent of students graduate
in three years, 12 percent of students graduate in
five years and 4 percent take six years or more.
"The reasons why students take longer than
four years vary," said University Registrar Roger
Printup. "The most likely reasons are students in
the co-term program who get both the bachelor's
and master's degrees in the fifth year; students
who have taken time off and just need more time
to complete the degree and students who did not
take time off but still need more than four years to
complete the degree."
Many times, students face unique circum
stances and decide to take a quarter or a year off
from Stanford.
"Students decide to graduate early or stop out
for reasons that are very specific to personal history,
resources and opportunities for that specific per
son," said Kathy Wright, the student affairs officer
at the Undergraduate Advising Center.
"In fact every Stanford student, even within a
particular major, creates a unique academic experi
ence that reflects her academic choices, his / her de
cision to participate and engage more or less fully in
University opportunities and his / her appetite for
intellectual and personal challenges."
Students who are considering alternative ap
proaches to graduation, whether they be graduat
ing early or stopping out fora quarter or longer,
can consult advisers at the UAC about the potential
advantages and disadvantages of their choices.

Not all members of the Class of 2003 will celebrate this June. Students frequently take time off to pursue other interests during their career at Stanford, or decide to pursue fifth-year
coterminal degrees.Graduating seniors will also be joined by a few students graduating early.
"Academic advisers help with per
spective, encouragement and a
wealth of information to help nav
igate a very large array of Univer
sity resources," Wright said.
The University allows stu
dents much flexibility and inde
pendence in making decisions
about how and when they want
to graduate.
"Stanford places strong empha
sis on student responsibility for
such decisions, within the context
of having equally strong student
service support to assist in plan
ning and in meeting critical chal
lenges that a young person might
face," Wright concluded. "One
measure of a student's ambition
and maturity is the ability to seek
out assistance with intellectual am
bitions and ideas."
