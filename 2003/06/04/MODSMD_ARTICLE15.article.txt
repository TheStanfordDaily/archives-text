# How to save $40,000: graduate early
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Early graduation is tempting for many high
school seniors preparing to attend Stanford.
How great to be out in three years — besides, it
will look fantastic on the old resume, right?
While most students have a tendency to change
their plans once they arrive on campus and ab
sorb the realities of general education require
ments and obligations for their majors, every
year a small crowd decides to forge ahead.
A student qualities to graduate early when
he or she has completed all University and
major requirements in less than 12 quarters at
Stanford. While many decide against early
graduation because they are afraid the course
load may be too overwhelming, the University
provides resources to help students explore
their options.
"The challenge will vary depending on the
individual student's situation," said Kathy
Wright, the associate director for upper-division
advising at the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. "In any case, advisers help students evaluate
whether graduating early is the best choice for
them, and they can help plan a schedule that
meets the student's need for early graduation."
According to Wright, students might have
an easier time trying to graduate early if they
entered Stanford with a significant number of
AP or transfer units. Still, there are certain dis
advantages students should consider before set
ting their hearts on making the three-year

dash, she said.
"The main disadvantage is they have less
time to partake in many educational opportu
nities," Wright said. "It's obviously helpful to
develop a plan as early as possible that takes into
account major requirements, GERs and other
University requirements."
Nick Rodriguez, a fourth-year student fin
ishing the coterminal program in international
policy studies, agreed that the decision to grad
uate or complete degree requirements within
three years limits student choice. He said that in
his experience, substantive majors often re
quire rigid and demanding schedules that push
the limits of both time and energy.
"Eveiy course I took had to be specially tai
lored to either complete major requirements or
to complete prerequisites for my MA," he said.
"I didn't really take very many courses to ex
plore my interests — one thing that 1 think I
regret about going this route."
Although the University encourages stu
dents to take classes in a variety of disciplines
before settling into a single major, sophomore
Nirali Vora, who still may decide to graduate
early in the pre-medical track, thinks students
who already know what they want to do should
seriously consider early graduation.
"I was pretty sure about being premed
[with a major in ] bio from the beginning," she
said. "I dabbled in drama, psych, hum bio
and philosophy fora little bit, but soon real
ized that bio was for me and that dabbling is
not worth $40,000."

Money plays a substantial role in students'
decision to graduate early. Vora said she had
the opportunity to explore other academic
areas at a local community college fora fraction
of the cost of attending Stanford.
Others expressed their belief that what Stan
ford has to offer outweighs cost.
"Stanford has a lot to offer beyond the class
es themselves, and staying here fora year or
two less than expected will obviously reduce
the number of outside-the-classroom experi
ences one can have," said one freshman who
plans to complete his economics degree within
three years. "In addition, I have made a lot of
really close friends at Stanford that I am not
eager to leave."
Freshman Yuriy Teslyar, who hopes to
graduate early with a degree in electrical engi
neering, said his decision was based on his de
sire to get a jump on his post-college career.
Teslyar, like Rodriguez, is also considering
coterming during his fourth year. He said that
early graduation became a goal for him dur
ing his senior year in high school when he re
alized that it was possible to do so with his
amount of AP credit and through taking heav
ier courseloads.
"Disadvantages to graduating early would
include either less time to enjoy college and ex
tracurriculars or less sleep," he said. "So far it's
been less sleep."
Rodriguez, who currently plans to earn his
bachelor's degree in public policy and his mas
ter's degree in international policy studies, also
hopes to enjoy the extra time that coterming
early would afford him, and said that he might
use the opportunity to enter the working world,
the Peace Corps or even the foreign service be
fore attending graduate school.
"The merits of graduating early are that you
have room to do things like IPS on undergrad
tuition — you pay less for what you get in gen
eral — and I think it probably looks good if you
frame it right," Rodriguez said.
According to Vora, early graduation is eas
ier to accomplish than many students are led
to believe, especially if they have an easily
completed major, plan their schedules very
carefully and make sure they turn in all pa
perwork on time.
"I can take the extra year to apply to med
school or to simply live or travel before I com
mit myself to seven or more years of medical
school," Vora said. "All in all ii tlepends on your
major and money.
"If you have money, then stay here by all
means if you are enjoying it," she added. "If you
are like me and want to experience some real
world and don't want to waste the extra money
on a major that you will finish in three years re
gardless, then early graduation is a very real, le
gitimate thought."

Early graduation is tempting for many high
school seniors preparing to attend Stanford.
How great to be out in three years — besides, it
will look fantastic on the old resume, right?
While most students have a tendency to change
their plans once they arrive on campus and ab
sorb the realities of general education require
ments and obligations for their majors, every
year a small crowd decides to forge ahead.
A student qualities to graduate early when
he or she has completed all University and
major requirements in less than 12 quarters at
Stanford. While many decide against early
graduation because they are afraid the course
load may be too overwhelming, the University
provides resources to help students explore
their options.
"The challenge will vary depending on the
individual student's situation," said Kathy
Wright, the associate director for upper-division
advising at the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. "In any case, advisers help students evaluate
whether graduating early is the best choice for
them, and they can help plan a schedule that
meets the student's need for early graduation."
According to Wright, students might have
an easier time trying to graduate early if they
entered Stanford with a significant number of
AP or transfer units. Still, there are certain dis
advantages students should consider before set
ting their hearts on making the three-year

dash, she said.
"The main disadvantage is they have less
time to partake in many educational opportu
nities," Wright said. "It's obviously helpful to
develop a plan as early as possible that takes into
account major requirements, GERs and other
University requirements."
Nick Rodriguez, a fourth-year student fin
ishing the coterminal program in international
policy studies, agreed that the decision to grad
uate or complete degree requirements within
three years limits student choice. He said that in
his experience, substantive majors often re
quire rigid and demanding schedules that push
the limits of both time and energy.
"Eveiy course I took had to be specially tai
lored to either complete major requirements or
to complete prerequisites for my MA," he said.
"I didn't really take very many courses to ex
plore my interests — one thing that 1 think I
regret about going this route."
Although the University encourages stu
dents to take classes in a variety of disciplines
before settling into a single major, sophomore
Nirali Vora, who still may decide to graduate
early in the pre-medical track, thinks students
who already know what they want to do should
seriously consider early graduation.
"I was pretty sure about being premed
[with a major in ] bio from the beginning," she
said. "I dabbled in drama, psych, hum bio
and philosophy fora little bit, but soon real
ized that bio was for me and that dabbling is
not worth $40,000."

Money plays a substantial role in students'
decision to graduate early. Vora said she had
the opportunity to explore other academic
areas at a local community college fora fraction
of the cost of attending Stanford.
Others expressed their belief that what Stan
ford has to offer outweighs cost.
"Stanford has a lot to offer beyond the class
es themselves, and staying here fora year or
two less than expected will obviously reduce
the number of outside-the-classroom experi
ences one can have," said one freshman who
plans to complete his economics degree within
three years. "In addition, I have made a lot of
really close friends at Stanford that I am not
eager to leave."
Freshman Yuriy Teslyar, who hopes to
graduate early with a degree in electrical engi
neering, said his decision was based on his de
sire to get a jump on his post-college career.
Teslyar, like Rodriguez, is also considering
coterming during his fourth year. He said that
early graduation became a goal for him dur
ing his senior year in high school when he re
alized that it was possible to do so with his
amount of AP credit and through taking heav
ier courseloads.
"Disadvantages to graduating early would
include either less time to enjoy college and ex
tracurriculars or less sleep," he said. "So far it's
been less sleep."
Rodriguez, who currently plans to earn his
bachelor's degree in public policy and his mas
ter's degree in international policy studies, also
hopes to enjoy the extra time that coterming
early would afford him, and said that he might
use the opportunity to enter the working world,
the Peace Corps or even the foreign service be
fore attending graduate school.
"The merits of graduating early are that you
have room to do things like IPS on undergrad
tuition — you pay less for what you get in gen
eral — and I think it probably looks good if you
frame it right," Rodriguez said.
According to Vora, early graduation is eas
ier to accomplish than many students are led
to believe, especially if they have an easily
completed major, plan their schedules very
carefully and make sure they turn in all pa
perwork on time.
"I can take the extra year to apply to med
school or to simply live or travel before I com
mit myself to seven or more years of medical
school," Vora said. "All in all ii tlepends on your
major and money.
"If you have money, then stay here by all
means if you are enjoying it," she added. "If you
are like me and want to experience some real
world and don't want to waste the extra money
on a major that you will finish in three years re
gardless, then early graduation is a very real, le
gitimate thought."
