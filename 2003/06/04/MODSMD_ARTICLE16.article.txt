# Taking a long break from the academic grind
## Students stop out 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
In the spring of 1997, Garth
Patil — then a junior at the Uni
versity — had to decide
whether to worry about pre-req
uisites and mandatory section
participation for another quar
ter or to work on the animatron
ics for Hollywood films like
"The Perfect Storm." He chose
the latter.
In doing so, Patil became one
of the many students who opt out
of the traditional, four-years-and
t hen-graduate approach to their
college careers. Instead, he
helped flesh-out the ranks of
those who are willing to postpone
graduation in order to make time
for educational opportunities
outside the classroom.
Stopping out, a Stanfordese
phrase describing the process of
disaffiliating oneself from the
University fora period, is tradi
tionally a one-quarter activity.
Whether it's to study for
MCATs, make some extra
money in a short-term job or to
travel, many students choose to
take a break from classes and the
Stanford campus. A few, like
Patil, stop out for longer periods
to take part in ventures unavail
able to them in Palo Alto.
Patil, who has stopped out
three times, began the trend
with a trip to Australia in the fall
of 1996 to race solar-powered
cars. I le had joined the Stanford
Solar Car Project as a freshman,
pursuing something that he'd
been interested in for years.
"I saw a television show called
'Nova' when I was 13-years-old
about an Mi l [solar] car," he
said. "I wanted to be a mechani
cal engineer."
He chose to stop out for two
quarters - in the spring he
worked intensely on the car's
development, and in the fall he
traveled with to race with the
team in Australia.
"The car took us two years to
build," he said. "The race itself

was very brief— the fastest car
was designed and built by Honda
and made the race in four days.
Our car took six days."
After spending the next two
years on campus, working on
his degree in mechanical engi
neering, Patil was offered a posi
tion at Edge Innovations, a spe
cial effects company that creates
animatronics for Hollywood
films. He spent the entire 1997-
98 school year employed at the
company, working on several
movies, including "Anaconda,"
"Deep Blue Sea" and"The Per
fect Storm."
"One of the things that I spent
most my time on in 'Deep Blue
Sea' was the gills on the shark,"
he said. "Each of the gills had 115
parts so that the shark would
breath in a believable way."
Patil later adapted this tech
nology for the animatronic mar
-1 ins used in"The Perfect
Storm."
"I have a significant problem
keeping my interest," he said.
"Whether it's ADD [Attention
Deficit Disorder] or lack of com
pelling subject matter, 1 don't
have an answer."
Mike Frank, a senior, had dif
ferent reasons for spending a
year away from the Stanford
and traveling around the world.
"It was a time for me to do
something different," Frank
said. "Be out in the world a little
bit more, meet people that
weren't on campus and especial
ly work on languages."
After his sophomore year,
Frank stopped out for most of
his junior year, taking classes at
universities in Chile, New York,
France and England. He spoke
fondly of his month in Paris.
"'There's this big cemetery on
the outskirts of the c ity proper
where everyone's buried from
Jim Morrison of The Doors to
Chopin," he said. "We had this
sweet apartment that was right
above it. If we wanted we could
have thrown stuff out the window
and into the cemetery. It's where
the Paris commune people were
forced to make their last stand and
were shot against the graves, their
backs to the wall — a pretty awe
some place."
His lackadaisical schedule in
Paris allowed him time to visit mu
seums, read, write and bicycle
around the city.
"It was a really good chance to
re-establish myself in different
contexts," Frank said of his year
abroad, "to get a sense of what I
like to do when I'm by myself, a
chance to meet new people — not
so much to make friends for life,
but to get a sense of what people
are like in different places."
Rather than stopping out in the
middle of a college career, others,

like senior Andrea Osborn, delay
their freshman year in order to
travel or work.
"1 had been dancing hula since
1 was five," Osborn said. "1 had
never been able to tour with the
dance company because I was al
ways in school. [Touring] was
something I really, really wanted
to do."
For 18 months between the
end of high school and the be
ginning of her first year at Stan
ford, Osborn toured the con
tiguous United States, Hawaii
and Japan with a professional
hula dancing company. She also
had her first chance to partici
pate in a festival called the Merry
Monarch in Hawaii.
"It's kind of like the Olympics of
hula dancing," she said. "When
you're five you think about danc
ing on the Merry Monarch stage.
[ The festival] was the main motiva
tion for me taking the whole year
off. 1 wanted to go to that competi

tion."
Osborn said she has no regrets
about delaying her freshman year.
"It's the best decision I ever
made," she said, "by far and away
the best decision I ever made."
Patil, who has stopped out yet
again in order to work in a succes
sion of start-up companies, also
thinks fondly of his experiences
away from school.
"I think for some people that
learn in a certain style, going
through Stanford in four years
would be a disservice to their
learning style," Patil said.
Although only a few quarters
from graduation, Patil said he has
no plans for returning to Stanford.
"After the last time I was in
school I realized that it would be
nice to have that degree, but I
never felt restricted by the fact
that I don't have it,"he said. "I
never felt there was something
that I couldn't do because I didn't
have it."

"I think for some people that
learn in a certain style, going
through Stanford in four years
would be a disservice to their
learning style," Patil said.
Although only a few quarters
from graduation, Patil said he has
no plans for returning to Stanford.
"After the last time I was in
school I realized that it would be
nice to have that degree, but I
never felt restricted by the fact
that I don't have it,"he said. "I
never felt there was something
that I couldn't do because I didn't
have it."
In the spring of 1997, Garth
Patil — then a junior at the Uni
versity — had to decide
whether to worry about pre-req
uisites and mandatory section
participation for another quar
ter or to work on the animatron
ics for Hollywood films like
"The Perfect Storm." He chose
the latter.
In doing so, Patil became one
of the many students who opt out
of the traditional, four-years-and
t hen-graduate approach to their
college careers. Instead, he
helped flesh-out the ranks of
those who are willing to postpone
graduation in order to make time
for educational opportunities
outside the classroom.
Stopping out, a Stanfordese
phrase describing the process of
disaffiliating oneself from the
University fora period, is tradi
tionally a one-quarter activity.
Whether it's to study for
MCATs, make some extra
money in a short-term job or to
travel, many students choose to
take a break from classes and the
Stanford campus. A few, like
Patil, stop out for longer periods
to take part in ventures unavail
able to them in Palo Alto.
Patil, who has stopped out
three times, began the trend
with a trip to Australia in the fall
of 1996 to race solar-powered
cars. I le had joined the Stanford
Solar Car Project as a freshman,
pursuing something that he'd
been interested in for years.
"I saw a television show called
'Nova' when I was 13-years-old
about an Mi l [solar] car," he
said. "I wanted to be a mechani
cal engineer."
He chose to stop out for two
quarters - in the spring he
worked intensely on the car's
development, and in the fall he
traveled with to race with the
team in Australia.
"The car took us two years to
build," he said. "The race itself

was very brief— the fastest car
was designed and built by Honda
and made the race in four days.
Our car took six days."
After spending the next two
years on campus, working on
his degree in mechanical engi
neering, Patil was offered a posi
tion at Edge Innovations, a spe
cial effects company that creates
animatronics for Hollywood
films. He spent the entire 1997-
98 school year employed at the
company, working on several
movies, including "Anaconda,"
"Deep Blue Sea" and"The Per
fect Storm."
"One of the things that I spent
most my time on in 'Deep Blue
Sea' was the gills on the shark,"
he said. "Each of the gills had 115
parts so that the shark would
breath in a believable way."
Patil later adapted this tech
nology for the animatronic mar
-1 ins used in"The Perfect
Storm."
"I have a significant problem
keeping my interest," he said.
"Whether it's ADD [Attention
Deficit Disorder] or lack of com
pelling subject matter, 1 don't
have an answer."
Mike Frank, a senior, had dif
ferent reasons for spending a
year away from the Stanford
and traveling around the world.
"It was a time for me to do
something different," Frank
said. "Be out in the world a little
bit more, meet people that
weren't on campus and especial
ly work on languages."
After his sophomore year,
Frank stopped out for most of
his junior year, taking classes at
universities in Chile, New York,
France and England. He spoke
fondly of his month in Paris.
"'There's this big cemetery on
the outskirts of the c ity proper
where everyone's buried from
Jim Morrison of The Doors to
Chopin," he said. "We had this
sweet apartment that was right
above it. If we wanted we could
have thrown stuff out the window
and into the cemetery. It's where
the Paris commune people were
forced to make their last stand and
were shot against the graves, their
backs to the wall — a pretty awe
some place."
His lackadaisical schedule in
Paris allowed him time to visit mu
seums, read, write and bicycle
around the city.
"It was a really good chance to
re-establish myself in different
contexts," Frank said of his year
abroad, "to get a sense of what I
like to do when I'm by myself, a
chance to meet new people — not
so much to make friends for life,
but to get a sense of what people
are like in different places."
Rather than stopping out in the
middle of a college career, others,

like senior Andrea Osborn, delay
their freshman year in order to
travel or work.
"1 had been dancing hula since
1 was five," Osborn said. "1 had
never been able to tour with the
dance company because I was al
ways in school. [Touring] was
something I really, really wanted
to do."
For 18 months between the
end of high school and the be
ginning of her first year at Stan
ford, Osborn toured the con
tiguous United States, Hawaii
and Japan with a professional
hula dancing company. She also
had her first chance to partici
pate in a festival called the Merry
Monarch in Hawaii.
"It's kind of like the Olympics of
hula dancing," she said. "When
you're five you think about danc
ing on the Merry Monarch stage.
[ The festival] was the main motiva
tion for me taking the whole year
off. 1 wanted to go to that competi

tion."
Osborn said she has no regrets
about delaying her freshman year.
"It's the best decision I ever
made," she said, "by far and away
the best decision I ever made."
Patil, who has stopped out yet
again in order to work in a succes
sion of start-up companies, also
thinks fondly of his experiences
away from school.
"I think for some people that
learn in a certain style, going
through Stanford in four years
would be a disservice to their
