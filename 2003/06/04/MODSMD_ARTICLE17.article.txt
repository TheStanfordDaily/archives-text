# Stanford makes temporary leaves feasible, enticing
## University encourages time off 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Many students enter Stanford with numerous
college credits and talk of graduating in three years.
Few, however, consider the possibility of taking
time off and stopping out of the University to pur
sue other interests. As opportunities present them
selves to upperclassmen, this option becomes more
appealing and students take advantage of the Uni
versity's liberal stopping out policy, often choosing
to graduate after their class as a result.
"Stanford makes it extremely easy to stop out,"
said senior Michael Ross. "In fact, that flexibility is
one of the reasons I came here. A tour guide told
me the story of John Steinbeck repeatedly stopping
out, and the University repeatedly welcoming him
back. 1 thought that was incredibly awesome."
Stanford encourages students to take time off to
explore the world outside of academia, and its le
nient policy reflects this. Once a student has com
pleted one quarter in good standing, he or she can
leave the University and return at the start of any
academic quarter.
"Stanford believes all things educational are not
necessarily academic," reads the Stanford Parents
Guide. "Because Stanford requires full-time atten
dance of enrolled students, the University makes it
easy fora student to ... take time off to work or to
seek educational experiences elsewhere. About 20
percent of students take advantage of this option.
The idea is to take a break from the established pat
tern with a specific purpose in mind."
Both Ross and senior Caroline Clabaugh
stopped out to participate in a program in Bermu
da where they consulted with and taught teachers
and students in the public school system about
computers and helped to develop computer sci
ence curricula.
"I had been thinking about doing a study
abroacl program or stopping out to travel, but fi
nances were an issue," Clabaugh said. "When the
option to get paid, live overseas, teach and play in
the sunshine was presented to me, I couldn't resist.
It seemed a perfect fit.
"I wasn't concerned about not graduating with
in the exact four-year span, as long as 1 didn't have
to take more than 12 quarters worth of classes," she
continued. "I was [however] concerned about tu
ition costs. That's why stopping out worked so well
for me — during my time off I didn't have to fulfill

any CS requirements, which is quite difficult to do
in an overseas program, but rather I could just gain
work experience and life experiences."
Charlotte Williams, a junior who stayed on cam
pus and worked during her time off, concurred
with Clabaugh's appreciation for the real-world ex
periences gained by stopping out.
"Iu working with various departments while
stopped out, 1 gained perspective on how seriously
— or not seriously — to take Stanford," Williams
said. "Sometimes in the throes of academic life, stu
dents get intense about making the grade or build
ing the resume, gearing up for 'the real world.'
Working with people past college helped calm my
fears about taking more time to graduate. Just live
life, man. Epicurean, I know."
Another reason for stopping out is to take time
to learn more about oneself .
"During my time in Bermuda, my mother
passed away," Ross said. "That, in combination
with starting a business, has prompted me to take
yet another quarter off to be a bit more introspec
tive and to gain some further real world experience
before returning to finish my studies in the fall."
Students said that Stanford was sympathetic to
their desire to stop out.
"When 1 left junior year, 1 was the house man
ager at Kairosand involved in several research pro
jects on campus, yet everyone, from my house
mates to the Row staff to my academic and research
advisers, was extremely supportive of my decision
to leave," Ross said.
I he decision to stop out is not an easy one, and
students admit sometimes questioning their
judgment.
"There have definitely been times this year
when I've wished I'd crammed and finished, but
given the lackluster job market and the opportuni
ties that stopping out has afforded me, I 'm glad I've
decided to spread things out — Stanford isn't a bad
place to be at the moment," Ross said.
Clabaugh summed up the sentiments of inter
viewed students when she said, "I'm definitely a fan
of time off. 1 think it makes school more worthwhile
if you take breaks to see what else is out there."
I lowever, Clabaugh also mentioned the hard
ship of not graduating with one's freshman class,
but suggested a positive alternative.
"I'll be graduating in December 2003," she said,
"but I'm still walking with my classmates this June.
When else could I really graduate?"
