## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Daily EIC bids farewell 
### 
In the book "Toward What Bright
Glory?", an account of student life at
Stanford on the brink of World War
11, alumnus Allen Drury included
the following statements from a friend of
the then-Daily editor in chief who faced
criticism about his passionate stance
against the war: "You're sensitive to these
things, that's part of your job as a journal
ist. And also — that's you. That's the way
you are. You feel things more deeply than
a lot of us do."
The Daily's efforts in investigating is
sues pertinent to life at Stanford and

bringing them to the at
tention of the community
remain one of the most
crucial goals of our paper.
This volume, I wanted
our coverage to spark dis
cussion; I wanted readers
to have the context and
facts to help them under
stand their lives on the
Farm.
As I prepare to finish
my term as editor in chief
of The Daily, I am quite
pleased with the result. I
am most proud of the tal
ented people on the staff
of The Daily who share
this value of empathy,
who are eager to find a
thought-provoking story
or a compelling photo or
a great interview — and
then translate that pas

"Whether they were putting
out the war issue during
finals week, covering
Stanford sports, creating
photo essays, designing
graphics, discussing edito
rials or writing the jokes for
the bunnies, f/iepeopfe
who made this volume
possible have my over
whelming appreciation
and admiration "

sion into the newspaper you are now
holding.
Whether they were putting out the war
issue during finals week of winter quarter,
covering Stanford sports, creating photo
essays, designing graphics, discussing ed
itorials or writing the jokes for the bun
nies, the people who made this volume
possible have my overwhelming apprecia
tion and admiration.
As I leave Stanford to head off to the
next adventure, I take with me many,
many lessons about leadership, fairness,
communication and courage — lessons
that I have learned during my four years
practically living in Storke Publications
Building. My favorite memories from this
volume focus on the fun we had at staff
meetings and dinners, the obsession some
of us had with a certain primetime Bache
lor, the many delirious and hilarious con
versations we had on a typical editing
night and those serious heart-to-heart
talks that often surfaced in the newsroom

late at night.
Outside of the newspaper staff, I am in
debted to my family and friends —
whether they helped me clean the office,
brought me dinner or just hung out with
me on my time off — their love and un
derstanding is incredible. I will never,
ever forget these past four months.
In my introductory editorial, I talked
about The Daily's responsibility to listen
to readers and eiigage the community in
dialogue. Howler, through examples
ranging from involvement in
on-campus elections to coverage of world

and historic affairs, I wish
to further reflect on my
original notion of respon
sible journalism. While
The Daily desires to listen
to members of the com
munity, the paper is not
an empty vessel in which
everyone has a right to
have any and all view
points published on its
pages. A responsible
newspaper editor must
also make decisions about
which content to run and
which perspectives to
share. While those deci
sions haven't been easy or
fun to make, they have
been mine. I wanted The
Daily to take a stand on is
sues and for better or for
worse, it has.
As Drury tells the

story of the senior year of students gradu
ating in 1940, the Daily office is often at
the center of the action. He describes the
place in reverent, magical terms — quite
fitting for my own experience with the
paper. He writes, "The dirty, dusty tum
bledown old Daily shack west of the Quad,
[was] filled with the detritus — and the
ambitious imaginings and romantic
dreams of glory — of the hundreds of
would-be journalists who had passed
though its portals and trod its sagging
floor over the campus generations...
Not much has changed since then —
the office is still dirty, the ambitions high
and the dreams still romantic — but I
wouldn't have it any other way.
