Catcalling is not 'flattery' and should not
be an accepted behavior on campus
Wearing skirts and high heels, we were
on our way to a dress-up party on Satur
day night when an SUV stopped at the
stop sign at the corner of Campus Drive
and Mayfield Drive started honking. It be
came clear that the SUV was honking at us
when the three or four guys in the car
started catcalling as well.
This was not an unusual incident. Some
women put up with it every day — re
gardless of what they're wearing, what
they're doing or where they're going.
Some people argue that the attention is
flattering — that catcalls are merely a sign
of healthy, red-blooded men showing
their appreciation for beautiful women.
The problem is that we didn't ask for
that attention, and we didn't want it. We
didn't dress up for the guys in that
car — we dressed up for ourselves. And
when we made it clear that their ad
vances were unwelcome, they disproved
the argument that these events are nice
and harmless. They yelled, "Fuck you,
bitch! Bitch-ass! Fuck you!" The car
slowed as the people inside continued
to scream. It was shocking and a bit

frightening how quickly "flattery"
turned to aggression when the subjects
of attention made it clear that they did
not appreciate the objectification.
Why is this happening on the Stanford
campus? We supposedly live in a protec
tive space, an enlightened space. Catcall
ing is not flattery. It is aggression; a clear
assertion of who is powerful and who is
vulnerable. Addressing this requires that
both the men and women at Stanford
refuse to accept such behavior.

Stanford alumnus returns diploma, claims
health of student fosters at risk
The failure of University President
John Hennessy to address in good faith
the concerns of the students who are fast
ing in support of a code of conduct for
Stanford workers is unconscionable. The

failure of the University to provide its
workers with a living wage, basic health
benefits, opportunities to learn English
and to develop their intellectual and tech
nical skills, while at the same time forcing
them into long-term temporary work sta
tus is not only poor personnel practice, but
it is also beneath the standard of human
dignity and beneath what Stanford should
stand for.
I graduated from Stanford in 1987
with a doctoral degree in education, spe
cializing in health education. As a health
professional, I can say that Hennessy's
actions are putting the long-term health
of the fasting students at risk. As an
alumnus of this University, I will say that
I can no longer accept the University's
indifference to those who serve it every
day. If students and faculty come to Stan
ford to better their career chances and
lives, why can't workers have that same
opportunity?
My mother had a fourth grade educa
tion and worked in a factory all her life. My
father died when I was seven. When I was
born, my mother started saving so I could
go to college. Because of her efforts and in
spiration, I have three university degrees.
But if my mother had worked for Stan
ford, none of this would have been possi
ble because, as a temp worker without
medical insurance and benefits, she would

not have been able to save anything.
I cannot be proud of a university that
denies to the people who cook and clean
and maintain it the lights and amenities
it so generously gives to its faculty and
white-collar staff. 1 cannot be proud of a
university that continues to house the
Hoover Institution whose peculiar right
wing mentality has infected the Bush ad
ministration and resulted in thousands
of innocent lives being lost in Iraq and in
wars to come. I cannot be proud of a uni
versity that values the money of donors
more than it values the lives of its stu
dents and the dignity of its workers. I can
not be proud of a university that is the
Enron of academia.
I want my university back — and until
I get it I cannot be proud of my diploma.
On Monday, I went to Hennessy's office
and returned my Stanford diploma. I am
undertaking this action as a personal act
of conscience. I ask each and every per
son connected with this University to ex
amine his or her own conscience and act
accordingly.

Victims of hate crime say Stanford must
create a 'haven of respect for all people'
During our years at Stanford, wc

have never been as shocked and scared
as we did upon discovering a swastika
drawn on our dorm room white board
last Saturday night. Both of us were
forced, for the first time, to count our
selves victims of a hate crime. The per
petrator could have been targeting Tali
for her Israel advocacy or Liz/.i for her
involvement in the Jewish community;
simply reacting to the word "Shalom"
(peace) written on our door; or acting
randomly (doubtful).
I he incident comes at the same time as
a general rise in anti-Semitism (particular
ly in Europe and in many Arab countries),
as well as the resurgence and emergence
of fundamentalist supremacist groups
worldwide.
I hese kinds of acts are unacceptable.
Saturday night reminded us in a visceral
way that we are not yet free of ignorance,
even on this supposedly enlightened cam
pus. Stanford must be a haven of respect
for all people.

Coalition of Labor Justice strikers
With the support of many student
groups, thousands of students, faculty
and alumni, the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice Labor strike is a movement recog
nized and supported throughout the

Stanford community. We, the under
signed ASSU Undergraduate Senators,
would like to express support for the
strikers fasting for labor justice and
show our solidarity with their cause.
By exercising their right to protest,
the strikers are taking an active role in
shaping their community around fun
damental standards of equality and ac
cess.
Stanford holds all its students, faculty
and administrators to the highest stan
dards of intellectual integrity. We feel
that this integrity should be rellected in
all aspects of University policy, not sole

ly in the realm of academia. Stanford
workers have the right to just wages, af
fordable health care, educational oppor
tunities and job security.
We urge President John Hen
nessy and the administration to support
the code of conduct proposed by the coali
tion and give Stanford workers the rights
they deserve as members of the Stanford
community.

car — we dressed up for ourselves. And
when we made it clear that their ad
vances were unwelcome, they disproved
the argument that these events are nice
and harmless. They yelled, "Fuck you,
bitch! Bitch-ass! Fuck you!" The car
slowed as the people inside continued
to scream. It was shocking and a bit

frightening how quickly "flattery"
turned to aggression when the subjects
of attention made it clear that they did
not appreciate the objectification.
Why is this happening on the Stanford
campus? We supposedly live in a protec
tive space, an enlightened space. Catcall
ing is not flattery. It is aggression; a clear
assertion of who is powerful and who is
vulnerable. Addressing this requires that
both the men and women at Stanford
refuse to accept such behavior.

Stanford alumnus returns diploma, claims
health of student fosters at risk
The failure of University President
John Hennessy to address in good faith
the concerns of the students who are fast
ing in support of a code of conduct for
Stanford workers is unconscionable. The

failure of the University to provide its
workers with a living wage, basic health
benefits, opportunities to learn English
and to develop their intellectual and tech
nical skills, while at the same time forcing
them into long-term temporary work sta
tus is not only poor personnel practice, but
it is also beneath the standard of human
dignity and beneath what Stanford should
stand for.
I graduated from Stanford in 1987
with a doctoral degree in education, spe
cializing in health education. As a health
professional, I can say that Hennessy's
actions are putting the long-term health
of the fasting students at risk. As an
alumnus of this University, I will say that
I can no longer accept the University's
indifference to those who serve it every
day. If students and faculty come to Stan
ford to better their career chances and
lives, why can't workers have that same
opportunity?
My mother had a fourth grade educa
tion and worked in a factory all her life. My
father died when I was seven. When I was
born, my mother started saving so I could
go to college. Because of her efforts and in
spiration, I have three university degrees.
But if my mother had worked for Stan
ford, none of this would have been possi
ble because, as a temp worker without
medical insurance and benefits, she would

not have been able to save anything.
I cannot be proud of a university that
denies to the people who cook and clean
and maintain it the lights and amenities
it so generously gives to its faculty and
white-collar staff. 1 cannot be proud of a
university that continues to house the
Hoover Institution whose peculiar right
wing mentality has infected the Bush ad
ministration and resulted in thousands
of innocent lives being lost in Iraq and in
wars to come. I cannot be proud of a uni
versity that values the money of donors
more than it values the lives of its stu
dents and the dignity of its workers. I can
not be proud of a university that is the
Enron of academia.
I want my university back — and until
I get it I cannot be proud of my diploma.
On Monday, I went to Hennessy's office
and returned my Stanford diploma. I am
undertaking this action as a personal act
of conscience. I ask each and every per
son connected with this University to ex
amine his or her own conscience and act
accordingly.

Victims of hate crime say Stanford must
create a 'haven of respect for all people'
During our years at Stanford, wc

have never been as shocked and scared
as we did upon discovering a swastika
drawn on our dorm room white board
last Saturday night. Both of us were
forced, for the first time, to count our
selves victims of a hate crime. The per
petrator could have been targeting Tali
for her Israel advocacy or Liz/.i for her
involvement in the Jewish community;
simply reacting to the word "Shalom"
(peace) written on our door; or acting
randomly (doubtful).
I he incident comes at the same time as
a general rise in anti-Semitism (particular
ly in Europe and in many Arab countries),
as well as the resurgence and emergence
of fundamentalist supremacist groups
worldwide.
I hese kinds of acts are unacceptable.
Saturday night reminded us in a visceral
way that we are not yet free of ignorance,
even on this supposedly enlightened cam
pus. Stanford must be a haven of respect
for all people.

Coalition of Labor Justice strikers
With the support of many student
groups, thousands of students, faculty
and alumni, the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice Labor strike is a movement recog
nized and supported throughout the

Stanford community. We, the under
signed ASSU Undergraduate Senators,
would like to express support for the
strikers fasting for labor justice and
show our solidarity with their cause.
By exercising their right to protest,
the strikers are taking an active role in
shaping their community around fun
damental standards of equality and ac
cess.
Stanford holds all its students, faculty
and administrators to the highest stan
dards of intellectual integrity. We feel
that this integrity should be rellected in
all aspects of University policy, not sole

ly in the realm of academia. Stanford
workers have the right to just wages, af
fordable health care, educational oppor
tunities and job security.
We urge President John Hen
nessy and the administration to support
the code of conduct proposed by the coali
tion and give Stanford workers the rights
they deserve as members of the Stanford
community.

My wife and I were gratified to read
the article, "Intermission infiltrates the

comments about our costumed perfor
mances as part of "One Ring Circus," our
"Lord of the Rings"-based, Moulin-

number. (1 was Aragorn; she was
Arwen.).
I must have been the oldest Stanfor

Catcalling is not 'flattery' and should not
be an accepted behavior on campus
Wearing skirts and high heels, we were
on our way to a dress-up party on Satur
day night when an SUV stopped at the
stop sign at the corner of Campus Drive
and Mayfield Drive started honking. It be
came clear that the SUV was honking at us
when the three or four guys in the car
started catcalling as well.
This was not an unusual incident. Some
women put up with it every day — re
gardless of what they're wearing, what
they're doing or where they're going.
Some people argue that the attention is
flattering — that catcalls are merely a sign
of healthy, red-blooded men showing
their appreciation for beautiful women.
The problem is that we didn't ask for
that attention, and we didn't want it. We
didn't dress up for the guys in that
car — we dressed up for ourselves. And
when we made it clear that their ad
vances were unwelcome, they disproved
the argument that these events are nice
and harmless. They yelled, "Fuck you,
