# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Hennessy forms committee to advise on labor practices 
### GORDON EARLE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Since it was founded, Stanford has
been a place where notions of citizen
ship and active engagement with the
world are taken seriously. The Univer
sity is a place where students, faculty
and staff can debate issues that are part
of the larger social and political frame
work.
In many ways, the protests of the
last few days over labor policies are
part of that tradition. University Presi
dent John Hennessy and the members
of his senior staff have met with repre
sentatives of the fasting students to en
gage in thoughtful discussions about
workplace issues. Key to those discus
sions has been a spirit of compromise.
In that spirit, the students and the
University made several proposals in
light of issues raised by the protesters.

In tilt- University's last proposal, Hen
nessy announced his intention to create
a presidential advisory committee. As
proposed, the committee would devel
op a set of comprehensive recommen
dations for policies affecting employees
and all others who work at Stanford, in
cluding consideration of a baseline
standard to protect the lowest-paid
workers.
The committee — with an equal
number of faculty, student, administra
tion and employee representatives —
would be organized and begin work in
the fall with the goal of submitting a re
port by the spring of 2004.
The University believes this presi
dential committee forms the basis for
serious dialogue among all members of
the Stanford community about impor
tant workplace issues. As a result, Hen
nessy announced yesterday that he will
form the committee and proceed with

plans to address these important issues.
The 12-member committee will be
co-chaired by Diane Peck, the executive
director of human resources and a fac
ulty member. In addition, it will in
clude three student members and two
faculty members. Nominations will be
sought from the ASSU Nominations
Commission and the Faculty Senate for
candidates for the student and faculty
positions. Three employees also will be
appointed to the committee, including
an employee represented by the bar
gaining unit. Two administrators, with
expertise in relevant areas, also will sit
on the committee.
Among the issues Hennessy will ask
the committee to examine are: policies
regarding temporary employees; the
existing living wage policy; policies
guiding the use of subcontracting; edu
cational opportunities for employees;
the adequacy of mechanisms to review

and ensure compliance with the Uni
versity's employment policies; and the
adequacy of mechanisms designed to
ensure compliance with legal rights of
employees and the university in con
nection with union organization.
In announcing the committee, Hen
nessy said its formation reaffirmed a con
tinued commitment on the part of Stan
ford to provide leadership on workplace
issues.
"The University already has estab
lished a living wage policy for subcon
tracted workers and has made commit
ments in other areas important to em
ployees, including a childcare subsidy
program, tuition assistance and addi
tional financial support for the health
care of its lowest-paid workers," Hen
nessy said. "Nonetheless, we know
there is always room for further im
provement, and this committee will re
view concerns expressed by students,

faculty and employees and make rec
ommendations with the goal of making
Stanford an even better workplace."
I believe that the discussions of the
last few days mark an important begin
ning and that the new committee marks
another step in the right direction. I
look forward to fall as a time when we
can start a positive process to address
many important workplace issues.
We are heartened by the fact that
protesting students, who have shown
considerable passion and commitment
to their cause, have joined with the
University to participate in the cam
pus-wide dialogue about these issues
and that we can work together to make
Stanford the best possible place for all
its employees.
