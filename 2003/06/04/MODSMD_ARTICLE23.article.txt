# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Celebrations can ignore history, hardships of native Hawaiians 
### JORDAN LEE RYAN McCORMACK GUEST COLUMNISTS 
It is yet another spring season at Stan
ford and almost every weekend, parties
and gatherings with "luau" themes are ad
vertised and held. These parties range
from the Kappa Sigma "Luau" or the
Toyon "Muthafucking Luau" TGIF. The
term "Luau" appears to be used in a
catchy way to package alluring images of
tropical drinks, swaying hula dancers and
festive Aloha shirts — all of which are sup
posed to denote the sensation of being in
the state of Hawaii. Sadly, this received
image of Hawaii is nothing more than a

product of advertisement agencies and
tour companies who have continually dis
regarded the real issues of native Hawai
ians, all the while selectively exploiting the
glorified elements of their culture.
For many people, the mention of
Hawaii evokes thoughts of Lif au — the
correct spelling of the celebration — and
relaxing resort destinations. Rarely is any
thought given to authentic native Hawai
ian culture and the very real issues faced
by native Hawaiians behind this idyllic
facade. Since the beginning of contact with
the Western world in 1768, native Hawai
ians have been the victims of large-scale
cultural, political and social oppression.
With the introduction of new foreign dis

eases, the native population experienced a
decline similar to the devastation of the
Native American population on the main
land following the arrival of the Spaniards.
The population decline, combined with
the imposition of a Western lifestyle, has
contributed to a considerably poor state of
physical and psychological health. Native
Hawaiians continue to remain the lowest
ethnic group in the state of Hawaii as far as
educational and socio-economic status, yet
the U.S. government affords them no spe
cial legal status to receive funding for as
sistance in these areas. Since the illegal
overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in
1893, native Hawaiians have been left
without a significantly empowered politi

cal voice, lacking an agency to enact broad
political changes for their benefit.
Nonetheless, the resilience of the Hawai
ian culture has allowed it to continue to
progress dynamically — in spite of all
these overwhelming obstacles.
Why do we highlight these bleak condi
tions? While not all native Hawaiians fall
under such conditions, it is simply igno
rant to think of Hawaii and imagine only a
party-filled tropical paradise, while the
very culture that is being romanticized is
perishing as we speak. Such a limited def
inition of a culture is certainly a form of
downward social constitution. Not only do
such stereotypes overlook the culture's
pressing issues, but they also maintain its

oppression through uninformed exploita
tion. We do not ask that people avoid
"luau"-themed parties or stop having
them — after all, merriment is certainly a
part of Hawaiian culture. But before you
start picking out an Aloha shirt for the
next paradise event, remember that be
hind this tropical gloss is a real group of
people with a real history of hardships that
have been repeatedly ignored.
