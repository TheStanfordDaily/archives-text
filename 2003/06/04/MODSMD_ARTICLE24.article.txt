## STANFORD BASEBALL IN THE NEWS Cardinal blows past regional field 
### DANIEL URBAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Dominant" is an overused
cliche, and teams that receive that
distinction often don't deserve it.
But Stanford's performance in last
weekend's NCAA regional clearly
warranted such a title.

The Cardinal, the sixth national
seed, was not a gracious host, going
3-0 and outscoring its opponents by
a total of 27 runs at Sunken Dia
mond last weekend.
The host Cardinal carried the
top seed into the regional, followed
by the Richmond Spiders, the UC-
Riverside Highlanders and the
University of Illinois-Chicago
Flames. Unlike some other region
al across the country, there were
no major upsets.
Few doubted that Stanford
would advance to the Super Re
gional. but few could have predict
ed that in doing so the Cardinal
would put up 41 runs in three
games.
The Cardinal's pitching and de
fense were excellent, but it was the
team's production at the plate that
let the rest of the postseason teams
know that Stanford can beat any one
of them — and by no small margin.
"I have never had a team that
has swung the bats this well in the
regional," head coach Mark Mar
quess said.
Marquess gave senior Ryan Mc-

Cally the sunt in the Cardinal's
opening game against the Flames
— a seemingly odd move given
that not only is McCally not the
Cardinal's No. 1 starter, but hadn't
started at all since April.
McCally had a rough time early
and gave up two runs in the second
inning as the Flames pounded his
fastball. But once his breaking balls
and off-speed pitches started to
find the strike zone, McCally was
able to find his rhythm and keep
the Illinois-Chicago batters off bal
ance for the rest of the game.
"When I was able to get the
changeup and slider and throw
those on fastball counts, that was
real big for me," McCally said.
After the second, McCally
blanked the Flames for seven
straight innings to earn the com
plete-game win.
The Cardinal offense gave Mc-
Cally a four-run cushion in the first
inning and continued to pad its
lead throughout the game's dura
tion. Juniors Carlos Quentin and
Brian Hall each homered for the
Cardinal, which walked away with a
9-2 victory to put the team in the
winners' bracket on Saturday.
After their loss to the Cardinal
on Friday, the F lames made a quick
exit from the regional when they
fell to Richmond in an elimination
game Saturday morning. The loser
of the afternoon game between
Stanford and UC-Riverside would
have to face the Spiders that same
evening.
The Cardinal briefly appeared in
danger of having to play a double
header, as the Highlanders pound

Hudgins, for four runs in the first in-

Senior Ryan McCally's 10 strikeouts against Illinois-Chicago helped the Cardinal begin the post
season in fine fashion. Stanford now finds itself two wins away from its fifth straight trip to Omaha.
ning. But the Cardinal offense more
than matched the four runs that
Hudgins spotted the Highlanders in
the first and amassed 16 hits on their
way to a 13-6 win.
"It'sjust excitement from coming
out for the first game of the postsea
son, and maybe it got to me a little
bit," said Hudgins of his rocky start.
"On top of that, they're a great-hit
ting ballclub, so if you make a mistake
they're going to hurt you."
Like McCally in Friday's game,
however, Hudgins soon displayed
the control of which he's capable
and scattered just two runs for the
rest of the game.
"1 felt like my command came
back as we went on," Hudgins said.
"1 started hitting spots, and my
curveball ended up being a real big
pitch for me."
Junior Sam Fuld, senior Ryan
Garko and sophomore Jed Lowrie
each went three-for-five. Sopho
more Danny Putnam blasted a two
run homer in the fifth, and sopho
more Chris Carter followed with a
solo shot of his own. It was the sec
ond time this year the two lefties
have hit home runs back-to-back.
Ciarko added a solo shot in the ninth.
Riverside fell to Richmond in
Saturday's evening game, and the
Spiders were left to face the Cardi

rial on Sunday, needing two wins to
advance to the* Super Regional.
Two consecutive wins against a
Stanford club playing its best base
ball would be a tall order for any
team, but much more so for the Spi
ders — Richmond squandered its
ace, Tim Stauffer, in its opening loss
to UC-Riverside and entered Sun
day with a pitching staff that had no
answers for the Cardinal bats.
A grand slam from sophomore
Danny Putnam, two bombs from
senior Ryan Garko and a fourth
home run by junior Carlos Quentin
added to a barrage of base hits from
the rest of the lineup. Every Cardi
nal starter had at least one hit en
route to an astonishing 19 runs.
Stanford's starting pitcher,
freshman Mark Romanczuk, had
plenty of breathing room with the
offensive production behind him,
but needed very little of it.
He allowed three runs in six and
two thirds innings, striking out six.
"I thought that it was business as
usual," said Romanczuk, who now
sports an 11-0 record and dispelled
any questions about whether he
could handle the pressure of start
ing in the postseason.
Garko, who produced three
home runs and nine RBI in the re
gional, and whose season batting
average now stands at .422, earned
the MVPaward for the tournament
and leads hot Cardinal team into
the Super Regional this weekend
against Long Beach State.

Stanford will need a heavy portion of senior third baseman Jonny Ash's timely hitting and ever-present hustle to over
come Long Beach State in this weekend's Super Regional.
