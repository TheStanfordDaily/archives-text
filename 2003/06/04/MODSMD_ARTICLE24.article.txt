## STANFORD BASEBALL IN THE NEWS Cardinal blows past regional field 
### DANIEL URBAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Dominant" is an overused
cliche, and teams that receive that
distinction often don't deserve it.
But Stanford's performance in last
weekend's NCAA regional clearly
warranted such a title.

The Cardinal, the sixth national
seed, was not a gracious host, going
3-0 and outscoring its opponents by
a total of 27 runs at Sunken Dia
mond last weekend.
The host Cardinal carried the
top seed into the regional, followed
by the Richmond Spiders, the UC-
Riverside Highlanders and the
University of Illinois-Chicago
Flames. Unlike some other region
al across the country, there were
no major upsets.
Few doubted that Stanford
would advance to the Super Re
gional. but few could have predict
ed that in doing so the Cardinal
would put up 41 runs in three
games.
The Cardinal's pitching and de
fense were excellent, but it was the
team's production at the plate that
let the rest of the postseason teams
know that Stanford can beat any one
of them — and by no small margin.
"I have never had a team that
has swung the bats this well in the
regional," head coach Mark Mar
quess said.
Marquess gave senior Ryan Mc-

Cally the sunt in the Cardinal's
opening game against the Flames
— a seemingly odd move given
that not only is McCally not the
Cardinal's No. 1 starter, but hadn't
started at all since April.
McCally had a rough time early
and gave up two runs in the second
inning as the Flames pounded his
fastball. But once his breaking balls
and off-speed pitches started to
find the strike zone, McCally was
able to find his rhythm and keep
the Illinois-Chicago batters off bal
ance for the rest of the game.
"When I was able to get the
changeup and slider and throw
those on fastball counts, that was
real big for me," McCally said.
After the second, McCally
blanked the Flames for seven
straight innings to earn the com
plete-game win.
The Cardinal offense gave Mc-
Cally a four-run cushion in the first
inning and continued to pad its
lead throughout the game's dura
tion. Juniors Carlos Quentin and
Brian Hall each homered for the
Cardinal, which walked away with a
9-2 victory to put the team in the
winners' bracket on Saturday.
After their loss to the Cardinal
on Friday, the F lames made a quick
exit from the regional when they
fell to Richmond in an elimination
game Saturday morning. The loser
of the afternoon game between
Stanford and UC-Riverside would
have to face the Spiders that same
evening.
The Cardinal briefly appeared in
danger of having to play a double
header, as the Highlanders pound
ed Stanford's starter, junior John
Hudgins, for four runs in the first in-

Senior Ryan McCally's 10 strikeouts against Illinois-Chicago helped the Cardinal begin the post
season in fine fashion. Stanford now finds itself two wins away from its fifth straight trip to Omaha.
