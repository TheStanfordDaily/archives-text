# Baseball to take on pesky Dirtbags again
## 
### DANIEL URBAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal's romp through its regional seemed
almost too easy, but this weekend's Super Regional
against Long Beach State promises to be a little
tighter.
The Cardinal exploded for 41 runs in three games
last weekend, but will be hard-pressed to duplicate
such offensive production against the Dirtbags.
Not only does Long Beach have firepower of its
own, but its pitching stall is far more accomplished
than any the Cardinal saw in the regional.
The Cardinal hosts the Dirtbags.at Sunken Dia
mond in one of eight Super Regionals across the coun
try. Should Stanford take two games from Long
Beach, the team will make its fifth straight trip to the
College World Series in Omaha.
The Cardinal last met the Dirtbags in its 2002 re
gional, in which Stanford eliminated Long Beach on its
road to Omaha. The team is hoping fora similar result
this year.
Coach Mark Marquess mixed up the pitching order
for the regional, but returns to the more familiar rota
tion for this weekend's matchup.
Junior John I ludgins — the Cardinal's typical No.
1 starter and a third-round draft pick — will throw Fri
day's game. I ludgins' command, consistency, mix ol
pitches and ability to work batters make him a very dif
ficult pitcher to hit, and he'll need all of his savvy
against a Long Beach lineup that is hitting just under
.300 on the season.
The Dirtbags will have their own ace on the mound
to match Hudgins. Abe Alvarez, known as much for his
afro as his breaking ball, is a crafty lefthander and a sec
ond-round draft pick.
The Cardinal offense's job doesn't get any easier
after Alvarez. On Saturday it will face |ered Weaver,
the brother of beleaguered Yankees starter-turned-re
liever Jeff Weaver. The younger Weaver has more
strikeouts than innings, a 1.99 ERA and a . 176 oppos
ing batting average.
His stats are formidable, but Weaver will be
matched up against Stanford
freshman Mark Romanczuk, who
lias yet to lose a game.
I he Ail-American duo of Al
varez and Weaver versus Hudgins
and Romanczuk could possibly re
sult in epic pitchers' duels both Fri
day and Saturday. Each team's of
fense however, is very capable of
starting a major rally regardless of
who' s on the mound.
Sunday's game, if necessary,
will feature Long Beach lefty Cesar
Ramos.
As has been the case for the last
month, Stanford's Sunday starter
lias not officially been decided.
After his excellent performance
against the University of Illinois-
Chicago Flames last Friday, senior
Ryan McCally seems the frontruli
ner for the job. Senior Tim Cun
ningham, who was selected in the
ninth round of the draft, is anoth
er candidate.
The Cardinal bats have their
work cut out fom them, but if last
weekend's regional is any indica
tion, they are more than up to the
task.
Senior Ryan Garko and junior
Carlos Quentin, third and first
rounders, respectively, lead the
team in hitting and combined for
five home runs in the regional.
The Cardinal lineup lias power
to spare behind Quentin and
Garko. With either sophomore
Chris Carter or sophomore
Donny Lucy hitting in the l)H spot
and sophomore Danny Putnam
following Long Beach pitchers will
have their hands full trying to
avoid the long ball.
While most of the Cardinal's
power comes in the middle of its
lineup, all Stanford starters have
contributed offensively this post
season. Juniors Sam Fuld and
Brian Hall, freshman Jed Lowrie
and seniors Tobin Swope and
Jonny .Ash have all been effective
in getting on base and driving in
runs.
