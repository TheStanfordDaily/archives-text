# Four Card players go on first day of Major League Baseball draft
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year, after two days and 50 rounds of the
Major League Baseball amateur draft, Stanford
catcher Ryan Garko's name was still on the
board. Suffice to say, he didn't make it quite that
far again this year.
Following in a line of Stanford players that re
turned to school for successful senior seasons
after disappointing junior-year drafts, Garko be
came the third-round pick of the Cleveland Indi
ans and was one of four Cardinal athletes select
ed yesterday during the first day of the 2003
MLB draft.
The senior backstop proved the scouts wrong
and carried a team with several question marks to
a stellar season, becoming the 78th selection
overall and earning a personal reward fora truly
astounding season for Stanford.
"Last year was really disappointing, but as dis
appointing as it was at the outset I really tried to
turn something that was a negative into a posi
tive," Garko said. "I'm really excited to get a
chance to go play pro ball. It's always been a
dream of mine and now it's finally going to be a
reality."
The Indians chose former Cardinal Jeremy
Guthrie and Jason Cooper in the draft's first
three rounds last year as well.
"It's exciting [to join Guthrie and Cooper],"
Garko said. "I've got a lot of respect for the Indi
ans organization, and talking to Jeremy and
Coop about it, they seem to love everything about
it."
Joining Garko on the draft's first day were ju
niors Carlos Quentin and John Hudgins and se
nior lefthander Tim Cunningham.
Quentin was the first Stanford name to leave
the board, as the Arizona Diamondbacks made
him the 29th overall pick and the 14th Stanford
player selected in the first round in the last 17
years. The junior hit .386 with 10 homers and
55 RBI this season and is one of five finalists for
the prestigious Golden Spikes Award. While
Quentin banished himself to the television yes
terday morning to get his mind off of the draft,
his roommates mobbed him with congratulato
ry hugs once Arizona made the pick.
It seems like a really great organization, and
everyone seems really positive there," Quentin
said. "Did I expect [to go in the first
round]? I wasn't exactly sure. I was
hoping that I would. I felt that my
talent justified it, but with the draft
you never really know."
The Texas Rangers chose Car
dinal ace John Hudgins in the
third round, two picks before
Garko at No. 76 overall. Hudgins
turned in an outstanding junior

season as head coach Mark Mar
quess's top starter, going 10-3
with a 3.33 ERA and earning Pa
cific-10 Conference Pitcher of
the Year honors.
Finally, after going in the 23rd
round last season and electing to
return to school for his senior
year, southpaw Tim Cunning
ham was chosen by Texas in the
ninth round and will join Hud
gins in the Rangers' system. De
spite a difficult year on the
mound, Cunningham's potential
to become a middle-rotation left

handed arm was enough to raise
his draft stock in 2003.
While the four Cardinal players
selected yesterday breathed a sigh
of relief and conducted mild cele
brations, two Stanford players that
expected to hear their names did
not. Juniors Sam Fuld and Brian
I lall must wait out the final 30
rounds today to see if a team will
draft them. Interest in both play
ers' talent remains high, but ques
tions of signability are sometimes
insurmountable when players
have the option of returning to a

program and university like Stan
ford — just ask Garko.
"I think I'd be a good guy to
talk to in that situation," he said.
"You hear tilings and it's up in
the air, and signability is such a
big factor. What I did was just
look at [Chris] O'Riordan and
[Andy] lopham and [Scott Drag
icevichj and those guys. They
came back as seniors and had real
good years and got drafted, and
they're doing fine now. So now
[Fuld and Hall] can look to me
and what I did."
