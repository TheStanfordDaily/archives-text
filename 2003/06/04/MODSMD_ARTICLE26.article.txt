## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year, after two days and 50 rounds of the
Major League Baseball amateur draft, Stanford
catcher Ryan Garko's name was still on the
board. Suffice to say, he didn't make it quite that
far again this year.
Following in a line of Stanford players that re
turned to school for successful senior seasons
after disappointing junior-year drafts, Garko be
came the third-round pick of the Cleveland Indi
ans and was one of four Cardinal athletes select
ed yesterday during the first day of the 2003
MLB draft.
The senior backstop proved the scouts wrong
and carried a team with several question marks to
a stellar season, becoming the 78th selection
overall and earning a personal reward fora truly
astounding season for Stanford.
"Last year was really disappointing, but as dis
appointing as it was at the outset I really tried to
turn something that was a negative into a posi
tive," Garko said. "I'm really excited to get a
chance to go play pro ball. It's always been a
dream of mine and now it's finally going to be a
reality."
The Indians chose former Cardinal Jeremy
Guthrie and Jason Cooper in the draft's first
three rounds last year as well.
"It's exciting [to join Guthrie and Cooper],"
Garko said. "I've got a lot of respect for the Indi
ans organization, and talking to Jeremy and
Coop about it, they seem to love everything about
it."
Joining Garko on the draft's first day were ju
niors Carlos Quentin and John Hudgins and se
nior lefthander Tim Cunningham.
Quentin was the first Stanford name to leave
the board, as the Arizona Diamondbacks made
him the 29th overall pick and the 14th Stanford
player selected in the first round in the last 17
years. The junior hit .386 with 10 homers and
55 RBI this season and is one of five finalists for
the prestigious Golden Spikes Award. While
Quentin banished himself to the television yes
terday morning to get his mind off of the draft,
his roommates mobbed him with congratulato
ry hugs once Arizona made the pick.
It seems like a really great organization, and
everyone seems really positive there," Quentin
