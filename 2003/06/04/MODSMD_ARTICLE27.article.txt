# Garko finally proving all the critics wrong

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
He's been called the Budding Su
perstar, the Media Darling and — per
his own request — a young Brad Aus
mus. But after four years at Stanford,
senior catcher Ryan Garko has made
certain that a nickname is no longer
needed; it is his name that will stick
around in the Cardinal record books
for years to come.
After a regular season that saw the
senior Ail-American put up numbers
worthy of Nintendo's "RBI Baseball,"
Garko came through with his latest
other-wordly performance over the
weekend in the NCAA Regional at
Sunken Diamond.
The Walnut, Calif, native went 8-
for-13 (.615) while driving in nine
runs, crossing the plate eight times and
belting three tape-measure home runs
— ungodly numbers that clinched the
Regional's Most Outstanding Player
award.
Continuing the success that earned
him Pacific-10 Conference Co-Player of
the Year honors and made him a semi-fi
nalist for the Johnny Bench Award
(given to the nation's best catcher), ( Jarko
tore through the weekend and contin
ued to amaze — but no longer surprise
— teammates, opponents and lims alike.
"Honestly, 1 haven't paid much at
tention because it's not like I have to
root for him to get a hit," said sopho
more Danny Putnam, who bats behind
Garko in the Stanford lineup. "You
just kind of expect it right now. I'll just
be in the on-deck circle knowing he'll
have a good at-bat, and then some
thing big happens and it's like, 'Yep, at
taboy.'
Garko showed marked improve
ment this season in all areas of his
game, batting .418 with 18 home runs
and 87 RBI while showing better de
fensive prowess as well. He currently
sits just five RBI from the top of Stan
ford's single-season record. The way
he has swung the bat of late, he seems
capable of reaching the 18-yea
"I think the last part of the season
has been the result of four years of
hard work," Garko said. "I'm the best

hitter that I've ever been right now in
my life. It's just a lot of hard work and
I'm a much better player now because
of Coach [Mark] Marquess and Coach
[Dean] Stotz, and everything they've
taught me about hitting."
r-old mark with just one more swing.
In 2003 the personable backstop al
ready has reached, or almost assuredly
will reach this weekend in the Super
Regionals, the Cardinal's single-season
top 10 lists in home runs, batting aver
age, hits and doubles. A career .426 hit
ter in the College World Series, a lilili
consecutive Stanford trip to Omaha
would give Garko a chance to complete
the most outstanding offensive season
of any Cardinal player in Stanford's
110-year baseball history.
"We've had some great offensive

players here that had some great years,
but his numbers will match with any
body's," Marquess said. "I don't want
to jinx him, but the one stat that stands
out is that he has more home runs than
strikeouts 118 home runs to 13 strike
outs], That is truly an amazing stat."
During the last month of the regular
season, Carko went 81 consecutive of
ficial at-bats and 23 games without a
strikeout before fanning twice in the
series opener against Cal Poly on May
23.
A rare talent that combines disci
pline, consistency and power at the
plate, C iarko has emerged as one of the
lust hitters in the college game during
his senior campaign.
Carko s performance at the plate on
Saturday characterized his terrific sea

son in Stanford's cleanup spot. Against
UC-Riverside, the senior went 3-fbr-5
with a single, double and home run, all
balls that were hit with merciless force.
I he two outs he made, though, were hit
just as hard-line drives to right and left
that went straight at the Riverside out
fielders.
Regardless of whether a hit results

take a beating.
"lie's been a fun player to watch,"
Putnam said. "But here's the thing:
lies not just hot right now, he's just
good. In reality, guys go through
streaks and stuff, but nobody goes
through a streak like this. After a while
you can't call it a streak."

Senior catcher Ryan Garko has had quite a week. After being named the Regional MVP and a finalist for the Johnny Bench award
given annually to the nation's best catcher, Garko was selected in the third round (78th pick) of yesterday's MLB draft by Cleveland.
