# He said, she said: Learn to see sports my way or the highway
## Spencer's dream girl needs beauty; brains and the infield-fly-rule 
### 
You know, I really thought I
might learn something about
myself this year. 1 thought
that writing a sports column
would have opened up a door into the
quagmire that is my lite. I thought that
finally I could answer a fundamental
question: why do my girlfriends' ha
tred of sports doom every relationship
I have?
Why do my significant others shun
Sports Center, baseball games and flag
football? Why do they not know how to
read a box score, take the 3-0 pitch or
run on a full count with two outs?
On one side of the breakup drama
is my now-ex-girlfriend ("Hot Stuff",
as you'll recall), just asking fora little of
my time and appreciation. On the
other side is Charles Barkley, a bald,
overweight, ex-NBA star that has the
penchant for spouting inappropriate
comments at inappropriate times.
You see, it started out so innocuous
ly; Hot Stuff was just coming over to
visit on a lazy Thursday evening. I was
casually watching Sports Center, which
was advertising its Budweiser Hot Seat
with Charles Barkley continuously. I
knew the Chuckster was going to run
his mouth belligerently, and the results
would be catastrophic. Oh how right I
was.
She came over to my room 10 min
utes before the Barkley interview, and
I was trying my damnedest to keep
her interested until then. I could tell
she wasn't really intrigued by the
Mavs defensive game plan (none) or
the Rocket's chase for 300, but I
thought she might be able to last 10
minutes.
Finally after what seemed like an
eternity, Sir Charles came onscreen,
and he didn't disappoint. I had waited
all day for this scene, and Charles came
through in the clutch. These aren't
word-for-word quotes, but they get the
point across.
ESPN: Charles, should Annika
Sorenstam play in the Colonial?

Chuck: You know, I don't think that
women should play in men's events . . .
Lisa Leslie also should not play in the
NBA, it's the same thing.
ESPN: What if Lisa Leslie was good
enough to play in the NBA?
Chuck: Well first off, she's not. But
secondly, I just don't think that a men's
sport should have women, girls, babes,

chicks, whatever you
want to call 'em.
He is not a role
model.
At this point, I was
rolling on the floor,
laughing at Charles'
chauvinism and gen
erally arrogant stupid
ity. Unfortunately, I

had been neglecting
Hot Stuff, and was unaware that she
was now standing at the door, bags
packed, ready to leave.
Hot Stuff: Well, it's obvious that you
care more about sports than me, so I'm
going to go. 1 can see you just want to
watch "Sports Station."
At this point, she left, and 1 didn't
stop her. She had given me an ultima
tum with no acceptable outcome, forc
ing me to choose between her and
sports. I had to decide what 1 cared
about more, my lifelong devotion to
the triumph of the mighty over the
weak, or a girl with no respect for my
such devotion. I chose sports, and we
were over.
The confusing thing is that she is a
two-year varsity athlete here. She
was a track superstar, but after real
izing that track wasn't masochistic
enough, she joined the lightweight
crew team. She is an accomplished
athlete, and her team won fifth place
at nationals. She is a bailer, in a crew
sort of way.
Yet even with this sports back
ground, when we visited the San Jose
Sabercats and the Oakland A's, I was
inundated with questions.
"How is Mark McGwire doing this
year? What are Saberkittens, and why
are they here? Who is Derek Jeter?"
Maybe she is just special, able to per
meate my circle of friends with just her
personality and devastatingly good
looks. Maybe she's so cool that she

doesn't have to impress me with her
sports knowledge. I mean, I like to
think I can be friends with someone
who doesn't know that the Hillen
brand-Kim deal sent Matt Williams,
home-run leader of the 1994 strike sea
son, packing for greener pastures.
Someone is just a worse person for
not knowing.
So she had failed in my sports
sphere. So she asked me why I brought
a glove to the A's game. 1 can let it slide.
She had underestimated my passion
for semi-obscure sports trivia.
But she called it "Sports Station."
Sports Station? Oh geez.
Honestly, how could she say that to
me? How could she marginalize the
one show that defines my entire life?
How could she belittle the show that
got me through boring summers in
third grade, wonderfully icy Sundays
in January and English essays that just
mandate study breaks?
The thing is, 1 have never dated a
girl that knows jack about sports. Hot
Stuff is by far the most sports-oriented,
and yet she couldn't even come close to
hacking it.
So to all you females in t he audience,
let me give you some advice.
Don't roll your eyes at us as we sweat
out the 12th round of our Fantasy
Draft. Don't say, "Wait, so you guys ac
tually think you are the coach of these
players?"
Don't let your total knowledge of
baseball managers come from what you
pick up in MS&E 180.
Do learn the sport. Do watch the
games with us, and casually, eventually,
try to pick up the nuances of the game
by osmosis.
Don't ask us questions â€” they will
only get responses of "Tell me you did
not just ask that."
And finally, watch Sports Center.
Think of it as a crash course in all things
sports. Your boyfriend has spent his
whole life studying for his Sports SAT
11. I'll give you a summer to get caught
up.

Why do my significant others shun
Sports Center, baseball games and flag
football? Why do they not know how to
read a box score, take the 3-0 pitch or
run on a full count with two outs?
On one side of the breakup drama
is my now-ex-girlfriend ("Hot Stuff",
as you'll recall), just asking fora little of
my time and appreciation. On the
other side is Charles Barkley, a bald,
overweight, ex-NBA star that has the
penchant for spouting inappropriate
comments at inappropriate times.
You see, it started out so innocuous
ly; Hot Stuff was just coming over to
visit on a lazy Thursday evening. I was
casually watching Sports Center, which
was advertising its Budweiser Hot Seat
with Charles Barkley continuously. I
knew the Chuckster was going to run
his mouth belligerently, and the results
would be catastrophic. Oh how right I
was.
She came over to my room 10 min
utes before the Barkley interview, and
I was trying my damnedest to keep
her interested until then. I could tell
she wasn't really intrigued by the
Mavs defensive game plan (none) or
the Rocket's chase for 300, but I
thought she might be able to last 10
minutes.
Finally after what seemed like an
eternity, Sir Charles came onscreen,
and he didn't disappoint. I had waited
all day for this scene, and Charles came
through in the clutch. These aren't
word-for-word quotes, but they get the
point across.
ESPN: Charles, should Annika
Sorenstam play in the Colonial?

Chuck: You know, I don't think that
women should play in men's events . . .
Lisa Leslie also should not play in the
NBA, it's the same thing.
ESPN: What if Lisa Leslie was good
enough to play in the NBA?
Chuck: Well first off, she's not. But
secondly, I just don't think that a men's
sport should have women, girls, babes,

chicks, whatever you
want to call 'em.
He is not a role
model.
At this point, I was
rolling on the floor,
laughing at Charles'
chauvinism and gen
erally arrogant stupid
ity. Unfortunately, I

had been neglecting
Hot Stuff, and was unaware that she
was now standing at the door, bags
packed, ready to leave.
Hot Stuff: Well, it's obvious that you
care more about sports than me, so I'm
going to go. 1 can see you just want to
watch "Sports Station."
At this point, she left, and 1 didn't
stop her. She had given me an ultima
tum with no acceptable outcome, forc
ing me to choose between her and
sports. I had to decide what 1 cared
about more, my lifelong devotion to
the triumph of the mighty over the
weak, or a girl with no respect for my
such devotion. I chose sports, and we
were over.
The confusing thing is that she is a
two-year varsity athlete here. She
was a track superstar, but after real
izing that track wasn't masochistic
enough, she joined the lightweight
crew team. She is an accomplished
athlete, and her team won fifth place
at nationals. She is a bailer, in a crew
sort of way.
Yet even with this sports back
ground, when we visited the San Jose
Sabercats and the Oakland A's, I was
inundated with questions.
"How is Mark McGwire doing this
year? What are Saberkittens, and why
are they here? Who is Derek Jeter?"
Maybe she is just special, able to per
meate my circle of friends with just her
personality and devastatingly good
looks. Maybe she's so cool that she

doesn't have to impress me with her
sports knowledge. I mean, I like to
think I can be friends with someone
who doesn't know that the Hillen
brand-Kim deal sent Matt Williams,
home-run leader of the 1994 strike sea
son, packing for greener pastures.
Someone is just a worse person for
not knowing.
So she had failed in my sports
sphere. So she asked me why I brought
a glove to the A's game. 1 can let it slide.
She had underestimated my passion
for semi-obscure sports trivia.
But she called it "Sports Station."
Sports Station? Oh geez.
Honestly, how could she say that to
me? How could she marginalize the
one show that defines my entire life?
How could she belittle the show that
got me through boring summers in
third grade, wonderfully icy Sundays
in January and English essays that just
mandate study breaks?
The thing is, 1 have never dated a
girl that knows jack about sports. Hot
Stuff is by far the most sports-oriented,
and yet she couldn't even come close to
hacking it.
So to all you females in t he audience,
let me give you some advice.
Don't roll your eyes at us as we sweat
out the 12th round of our Fantasy
Draft. Don't say, "Wait, so you guys ac
tually think you are the coach of these
players?"
Don't let your total knowledge of
baseball managers come from what you
pick up in MS&E 180.
Do learn the sport. Do watch the
games with us, and casually, eventually,
try to pick up the nuances of the game
by osmosis.
Don't ask us questions â€” they will
only get responses of "Tell me you did
not just ask that."
And finally, watch Sports Center.
Think of it as a crash course in all things
sports. Your boyfriend has spent his
whole life studying for his Sports SAT
11. I'll give you a summer to get caught
up.

Spencer Porter would like to remind the
ladies that when Sports Centers rocking,
don't come knocking. E-mail him at

You know, I really thought I
might learn something about
myself this year. 1 thought
that writing a sports column
would have opened up a door into the
quagmire that is my lite. I thought that
finally I could answer a fundamental
question: why do my girlfriends' ha
tred of sports doom every relationship
I have?
Why do my significant others shun
Sports Center, baseball games and flag
football? Why do they not know how to
read a box score, take the 3-0 pitch or
run on a full count with two outs?
