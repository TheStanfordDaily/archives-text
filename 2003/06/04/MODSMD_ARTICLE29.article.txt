# Kerins ideal man should realize that Anna Kournikova is not an athlete
## 
### 
I walk into a dingy, unlit fraternity room,
only to see my boyfriend sitting under
neath a poster of Fenway Park, his face
illuminated by the neon blue glow of
ESPN.
He doesn't bother to get up or notice my
weary post-crew-practice body, my eyeliner

or my new dress.
All he says, with eyes
glued on hairy 7-foot basket
ball players he will never
meet, is, "You need to see
this. Dirk is about to throw
down."
The next thing I know,
Spencer is on the floor,
yelling like a born-again

Christian that went a little heavy on the moon
shine. Sporting a low,
deep and eerily annoying announcer's voice,
he yells out "Throw it down big man," and
proceeds to ask me no less than five times,
"Did you see that?"
Welcome to my world.
But still, you may ask, "Why did Hot Stuff
leave Spencer at the pinnacle of his manliness,
the critical moment of this sports-crazed-col
lege-sports-columnist-turned-varsity-soccer-
walk-on-fraternity-boy's sensitivity as Charles
Barkley concluded ESPN's 59,567 th showing
of Sports Center that spring day at Kappa Sig?"
Allow me to provide all you sports enthusi
asts with an answer.
Answer No. 1 (for girls): Never interrupt
your boyfriend while he is watching baseball,
basketball, Sports Center, (insert glamour
sport of choice here).
Answer No. 1 (for guys): Never let your
girlfriend know that your favorite spectator
sport is more important than her, especially if
she's a two-year varsity athlete of a sport you
have never witnessed.
Ah yes, let us barken back to the days of
Spencer's first (and only) trip to a crew regat
ta ... "The Big Row," 10 a.m. Saturday, May
3, 2003.
Still water rushes smoothly under our boat
as the nine of us shift our bodies together in
perfect unison, oars dip into the water silent
ly until the release when the oarlocks pound
together, breathe in, breathe out, together.

We are focused, 35 strokes per minute, we are
going to have the best race of our lives, and we
head toward the starting line first passing
under the bridge marking 1,000 meters of the
course, calm, quiet, still, intense, focused .
" That Kerin is so hot right now! Like
Hansel, so hot! Cal sucks so hard! Screw Cal!
Keep crewing Stanford!," hollers a familiar
voice from above. Oh Spencer, you didn't just
yell that. Oh yes, you did.
Crewing? Honestly, it's called rowing.
The coxswain looks me in the eye, "Was
that your boyfriend? Isn't he a sports colum
nist? Does he know anything about crew?"
Truth be told, most people don't. Most
people ideali/e those so-called "glamour
sports. They gawk at the perfect shot, the per
fect goal, the skill, the strategy, the popular
heroes and the lingo of each respective sport.
They watch Sports Center 24-7 believing that
they are getting a day's lull education of ath
letic knowledge. However, they ignorantly
overlook endurance events and female ath
letes. OK, most female athletes. Thank you
Laker dancers, Saberkittens and Anna
Kournikova.
That fated Sports Center day at Kappa Sig,
I had already been to two crew practices, a
total of four and a half hours split between ()
a.m. and 5 p.m. I went to visit my boyfriend,
hoping fora little you-know-what but instead
was greeted with blaring ESPN.
So after I thought Spencer was more sexu
ally attracted to a bald, overweight man, I left,
and anyone else would have too. Unless they
were a bald, overweight man.
By going out with me, was Spencer forced
to make a choice between sports and myself?
I'd like to think not. Personally, I'd like to
think I was bringing him a little closer to
sports than Charles Barkley's bobblehead
possibly could. I was introducing him to a glo
rious new sport with intense drama, fierce
competition and raw emotion. If that isn't
what sports is all about, you can call me Hot
Stall.
The problem wasn't sports though.
Spencer knows pretty much all there is to
know about being the flawless spectator,
(even if he did think that "catching a crab"
meant catching an STD). It was the rules.
We both broke them. By focusing too
much on sports, we both forgot to focus
enough on each other.

people ideali/e those so-called "glamour
sports. They gawk at the perfect shot, the per
fect goal, the skill, the strategy, the popular
heroes and the lingo of each respective sport.
They watch Sports Center 24-7 believing that
they are getting a day's lull education of ath
letic knowledge. However, they ignorantly
overlook endurance events and female ath
letes. OK, most female athletes. Thank you

That fated Sports Center day at Kappa Sig,
I had already been to two crew practices, a
total of four and a half hours split between ()
a.m. and 5 p.m. I went to visit my boyfriend,
hoping fora little you-know-what but instead
was greeted with blaring ESPN.
So after I thought Spencer was more sexu
ally attracted to a bald, overweight man, I left,
and anyone else would have too. Unless they
were a bald, overweight man.
By going out with me, was Spencer forced
to make a choice between sports and myself?
I'd like to think not. Personally, I'd like to
think I was bringing him a little closer to
sports than Charles Barkley's bobblehead
possibly could. I was introducing him to a glo
rious new sport with intense drama, fierce
competition and raw emotion. If that isn't
what sports is all about, you can call me Hot
Stall.
The problem wasn't sports though.
Spencer knows pretty much all there is to
know about being the flawless spectator,
(even if he did think that "catching a crab"
meant catching an STD). It was the rules.
We both broke them. By focusing too
much on sports, we both forgot to focus
enough on each other.
