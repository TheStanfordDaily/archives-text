# Fast ends as students reach agreement with Hennessy

### ERIC ELDON ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Six students decided last night to end their seven-day
fast in support of a process to bring about a code of con
duct for labor policies. They reached an agreement with
University President John Hennessy in which a joint
presidential committee will be formed next fall to make
recommendations to the president on University labor
practices.
"Not only have we fasters emerged personally
stronger, not only have the community members who
actively supported the vision fora code of conduct be
come motivated and empowered, but our entire com
munity has taken significant steps toward fulfilling the
mission of our university," said sophomore Anna Mum
ford, one of the fasters.
"The establishment ofa process fora code of conduct
in which students, workers, faculty and staff are at the
table signals the movement toward a University that ac
tively appreciates its community members as equally
valuable and important," she added.
The fast began last Wednesday after a protest by
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student group, at Stan
ford's Webb Ranch supporting better conditions for
workers and a rally in the Main Quad marking the re
lease of a survey report by SEIU Local 715 and Work

ing Partnership USA. The report concluded that tem
porary workers at Stanford face unjust working and
living conditions.
The fast started a week ago in the Main Quad, but
was moved to the patio outside of El Centro Chicano
after administrators said they would not negotiate if the
students were in the Quad because they were in viola
tion of University policy and also said that those who re
mained would face disciplinary consequences.
In the past seven days, workers and students have
held 16 rallies, marches and vigils — most of them at
tended by over 100 students and workers — demand
ing that the University create an official process
through which a wide range of labor issues at Stanford
could be addressed.
The Stanford Labor Act ion Coalition and it.> partner
and umbrella organization, the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice, organized the fast and related events. Representa
tives from these groups have met with Hennessy and
other senior administrators regularly since the fast
began to negotiate a compromise on the issues.
The planned committee will include three student
members, two faculty members, three employees — in
cluding one representative from a "bargaining unit,"
such as a union — and two administrators. It will be co-

chaired by Diane Peck, executive di
rector of human resources and a fac
ulty member to be appointed by
Hennessy. The committee is set to
begin working this fall and report
back to 1 lennessy with recommen
dations in the spring 0f2004.
According to Vice Provost for
Public Affairs Gordon Earle, the
committee "will examine issues such
as temporary workers, educational
options for workers and subcon
tracting issues as well. Iliese are all
issues that students wanted us to
look at and which we agreed were
very important."
He added, "We came to an
agreement on the formation of a
presidential advisory committee.
ITie student representatives agreed
to join with the administration in the
formation of the presidential com
mittee on workplace issues that the
University announced today. We
are very pleased that this has hap
pened and that we tan move for
ward in a very positive manner."
Earle acknowledged that some
concern had arisen during the ne
gotiations about how seriously the
committee's recommendations
would be taken, but he said that
Hennessy would carefully consider
each of the recommendations.
"What we announced today was
the framework for the committee.

and it contains the key elements to
be successful, hut some of the details
have yet to be determined," Earle
said.
Senior Gabby Rico, a member of
the Coalition for Labor Justice who
spoke at yesterday's noon rally, said
that her reasons for supporting the
fast were personal.
"My mother was a farm worker

for 18 years," Rico said. "She picked
lettuce, strawberries and grapes
throughout the fields of California,
Oregon and Washington. 1 take
workers' rights as a very personal
issue and to go to a school where I'm
supposed to feel like I'm accepted,
like I'm part of the campus commu
nity? It just doesn't feel like that
workers are included.

"What constitutes community to
the University when the workers
aren't treated equally to the stu
dents?" she added. "I remember my
freshman year I was so appalled
that, being a student starting to
work at the dining halls, you made
more money than the workers who
have been there eight years."
Rico said that there is an overall

tone of disrespect toward workers
on campus and that a code of con
duct would help create an atmos
phere of respect for workers' rights
by providing workers with a living
wage, health benefits and eliminat
ing most temporary positions.
The fasters and their fellow labor
activists were supported by letters, e
mails and phone calls from people at
Stanford, across the country and
around the world urging Hennessy
to consider initiating a process that
could lead to the creation a code of
conduct.
Public figures ranging from
Reverend Jesse Jackson to the
band Ozomadi — who played at
Stanford's Frost Amphitheatre this
weekend and brought the fasting
students on stage before the show
to voice their position — support
ed the fasters during the past week.
Longtime activists — including
Dolores Huerta, who has been in
volved in labor issues since her time
working alongside Cesar Chavez or
ganizing farm workers in the
1960s — came to campus to speak
out in support of the students.
John Martin, who received a
Ph. Din health education from Stan
ford in 1986, returned his diploma
to Hennessy, with whom he said it
will stay until the issue is resolved in
favor of the fasters.
Thomas Sheehan, a professor of
religious studies who spoke at a
rally on Monday, said that those in
volved in the fast were making the
right decision.

" Two or three years clown the
road these students may forget the
courses they took, but they will
never forget the part they took part
in a historic struggle for the poorest
of the poor on this campus," he said.
"That in itself proves their educa
tion was worth it. Wouldn't you
rather tell your children you were
out here negotiating for workers'
rights rather than restricting their
wages and health care? These su
perb students are the heroes of the
next 20 years."
Gabriel Hernandez, a long time
human-iights activist and union or
ganizer who has been fasting since
last week with the students, ex
plained the process of lasting.
He said that the fasters gradual
ly decreased their intake of meat,
caffeine and sugary foods so that by
last Wednesday, some of the
fasters' last meals consisted of only
water and some melon. This is
often done to reduce the severity
and length of withdrawal that the
body goes through once it stops re
ceiving food.
Hernandez said that the diges
tive system and other body systems
shut down over the first three days,
at which point the faster enters a
more stable phase.
"A pan of it is physical and a part
of it is mental, and another part of it
is spiritual," he said. "If you can con
nect all those things you can go a
while. What I've tried to do is to make
sure that they're focused on all of
those different aspects of doing this."
