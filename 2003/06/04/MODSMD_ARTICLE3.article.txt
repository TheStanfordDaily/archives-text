### ERIC ELDON ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Six students decided last night to end their seven-day
fast in support of a process to bring about a code of con
duct for labor policies. They reached an agreement with
University President John Hennessy in which a joint
presidential committee will be formed next fall to make
recommendations to the president on University labor
practices.
"Not only have we fasters emerged personally
stronger, not only have the community members who
actively supported the vision fora code of conduct be
come motivated and empowered, but our entire com
munity has taken significant steps toward fulfilling the
mission of our university," said sophomore Anna Mum
ford, one of the fasters.
"The establishment ofa process fora code of conduct
in which students, workers, faculty and staff are at the
table signals the movement toward a University that ac
tively appreciates its community members as equally
valuable and important," she added.
The fast began last Wednesday after a protest by
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student group, at Stan
ford's Webb Ranch supporting better conditions for
workers and a rally in the Main Quad marking the re
lease of a survey report by SEIU Local 715 and Work

ing Partnership USA. The report concluded that tem
porary workers at Stanford face unjust working and
living conditions.
The fast started a week ago in the Main Quad, but
was moved to the patio outside of El Centro Chicano
after administrators said they would not negotiate if the
students were in the Quad because they were in viola
tion of University policy and also said that those who re
mained would face disciplinary consequences.
In the past seven days, workers and students have
held 16 rallies, marches and vigils — most of them at
tended by over 100 students and workers — demand
ing that the University create an official process
through which a wide range of labor issues at Stanford
could be addressed.
The Stanford Labor Act ion Coalition and it.> partner
and umbrella organization, the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice, organized the fast and related events. Representa
tives from these groups have met with Hennessy and
other senior administrators regularly since the fast
began to negotiate a compromise on the issues.
The planned committee will include three student
members, two faculty members, three employees — in
cluding one representative from a "bargaining unit,"
such as a union — and two administrators. It will be co-
