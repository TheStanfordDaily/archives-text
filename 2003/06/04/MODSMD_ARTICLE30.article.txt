# Track guns for top-five finish

### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
With the fields now set for the NCAA
Track and Field Championships, the
Cardinal is now focusing all its energy to
wards the upcoming competition in
Sacramento on June 11-14.
"The goal is to be in the top five as a
team," said Vin director of
Stanford track and field. "We have the
potential to do it, but there were some
weird things throughout the country as
far as qualifying, so 1 really don't have a
g<xxl sense yet of where we stand."
Some of this confusion was due to the
regional championships that were instat
ed this year to qualify athletes to the
NCAA Championships. The Cardinal
competed well at the West Regional
Championships, finishing fourth as a
team and sending 19 athletes to nationals.
"I think it was a good meet for what it

was," Lananna said. "I am not sure we
needed that extra race, though."
Even so, the Cardinal's performance
was stellar; in all, Stanford qualified 24
athletes including the at-large bids.
leading the way for the Cardinal is
two-time defending 5,000 champion and
senior Lauren Fleshman. She will be chal
lenged by one of the strongest 5,000 fields
in years which will include cross-country
champ Shalene Flanagan of North Car
olina, the indoor 5,000 champion Sara
Gorton of Colorado, and the American
junior record holder Molly Huddle of
Notre Dame.
Fleshman currently holds the fastest
time in the nation and No. 3 collegiate all
time record, but Gorton trails her by less
than a second.
"I actually hope the race is really fast,"
Fleshman said. "I would rather run 15
minutes, 7 seconds and lose than run
much slower and win."

Sophomore Sara Bei, who beat Flesh
man by a split-second at the regionals, will
also lx- in the 5,000 field.
Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig is
the Cardinal's lone entry in the 10,000
and is expected to contend for the
championship after winning the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference title and running the
No. 5 time ever fora collegian over
5,000 meters.
Senior Malindi Elmore will also face a
tough field in the 1,500, which includes
indoor mile champion Johanna Nilsson
of Northern Arizona and the defending
outdoor champion, Lena Nilsson from
UCLA.
In the shot, junior Jillian Camarena
who was the runner-up in the same
event in the indoor championships in
the winter — will be looking to claim
her first NCAA title. She is also entered

in the discus.
After missing an automatic bid
out of the West Region, senior Kim
Stone earned an at-large bid in the
high jump and will compete for All-
American honors and try to break
the elusive (>-l<x>t barrier.
Junior Lillian Bush hit the auto
matic mark in the heptathlon and
will try to gain her first All-American
title.
The most unexpected entry for
the Cardinal is sophomore Undine
Becker who jumped 20 leet, 5 indi
es in the long jump to rise from the
lowest seed in the regional to the
runner-up spot.
The men have several entrants
who will contend for N( IAA titles as
well.
Junior Louis Luchini is unde
feated in his last two outings at the
5,000 and boasts the No. 3 time in
the nation. However, lie will be
challenged by Arkansas' Alistair
Craggand Eastern Michigan's Boaz
Cheboiywo, who went 1-2, respec
tively, at the indoor championships.
Even without junior Don Sage,
the defending 1,500 champion,
Stanford should be well represent
ed in the event. Junior Grant Robi
son has not been defeated by a col
legian in the 1,500 yet this year and
hopes to continue t hat streak on the
strength of his closing kick and
good racing tactics. •
"1 want to go into every champi
onship from here on out with the
ability to win," said Robison, who
finished eighth last year at the
NCAA. Championships and then

followed it up with a fourth at the
U S. National Championships in
the 1,500.
In the 10,000, sophomore lan
Dobson and senior Adam Tenforde
boast two ol the top times in the na
tion and should Ix 1 competing for
one ol ilie top spots next week.
Junior Seth Hejny and redshirt
Neil Davis qualified in the 5,000
along with Luchini. Hejny has the
eighth lastest time in the 5,000
going into the championships.
Senior Nick Welihozkiy won the
hammer at the West Region Cham
pionship over Oregon's Adam ki iz
and will try to build on that mo
mentum to help propel him to All-
American suit us.
Seniors Milton Little and Omer
I nan will also be returning to the
NCAA Championships in the long
jump and disc us, respectively, to try
to add All-American accolades to
the list of their accomplishments.
1 he Cardinal will also be send
ing men's and women's sprinters
this year for the first time since
Chrystie Gaines claimed the 100
meter NC AA title in 1992. Both the
men's and women's 1,600-meter
relay teams will appear at nationals
and freshman Nashonme Johnson
will also represent Stanford in the
200.
"1 am thrilled that the sprinters
will have an opportunity to run at
nationals," Lananna said. "1 think
we are in great shape to do well, and
I hope this will be a springboard to
more success."
Competition begins on June 11
with preliminaries and heptathlon
events. June 14 is the last day of the
championships, with several finals
set to run on the track in the
evening.
