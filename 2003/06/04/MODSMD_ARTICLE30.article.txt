### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
With the fields now set for the NCAA
Track and Field Championships, the
Cardinal is now focusing all its energy to
wards the upcoming competition in
Sacramento on June 11-14.
"The goal is to be in the top five as a
team," said Vin director of
Stanford track and field. "We have the
potential to do it, but there were some
weird things throughout the country as
far as qualifying, so 1 really don't have a
g<xxl sense yet of where we stand."
Some of this confusion was due to the
regional championships that were instat
ed this year to qualify athletes to the
NCAA Championships. The Cardinal
competed well at the West Regional
Championships, finishing fourth as a
team and sending 19 athletes to nationals.
"I think it was a good meet for what it

was," Lananna said. "I am not sure we
needed that extra race, though."
Even so, the Cardinal's performance
was stellar; in all, Stanford qualified 24
athletes including the at-large bids.
leading the way for the Cardinal is
two-time defending 5,000 champion and
senior Lauren Fleshman. She will be chal
lenged by one of the strongest 5,000 fields
in years which will include cross-country
champ Shalene Flanagan of North Car
olina, the indoor 5,000 champion Sara
Gorton of Colorado, and the American
junior record holder Molly Huddle of
Notre Dame.
Fleshman currently holds the fastest
time in the nation and No. 3 collegiate all
time record, but Gorton trails her by less
than a second.
"I actually hope the race is really fast,"
Fleshman said. "I would rather run 15
minutes, 7 seconds and lose than run
much slower and win."

Sophomore Sara Bei, who beat Flesh
man by a split-second at the regionals, will
also lx- in the 5,000 field.
Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig is
the Cardinal's lone entry in the 10,000
and is expected to contend for the
championship after winning the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference title and running the
No. 5 time ever fora collegian over
5,000 meters.
Senior Malindi Elmore will also face a
tough field in the 1,500, which includes
indoor mile champion Johanna Nilsson
of Northern Arizona and the defending
outdoor champion, Lena Nilsson from
UCLA.
In the shot, junior Jillian Camarena
who was the runner-up in the same
event in the indoor championships in
the winter â€” will be looking to claim
her first NCAA title. She is also entered
