# Can Stanford handle one more year of Babin?

### 
Spring quarter, more than the other
two, really gets me at the end. How
are we expected to do work and
study for finals with 90-degree days
and every other student (or so it seems) al
ready finished?
Beats me. But then again, it's not really
a sports issue, either.
So back to the matter at hand. The other
shame about spring quarter is that it forces
us to study right through some of the most
exciting sports action of the year — the
NHL and NBA playoffs. This, of course,
isn't just confined to spring— I'm surea lot
of you have been forced into the position of
having to choose between studying for that
winter quarter final or watching that first
round NCAA Tournament game.
Yeah, I'd choose the basketball game as
well. For all you know, your bracket might
be riding on it.
This year, however, the playoffs haven't
offered me much distraction. After the
Avalanche bowed out to Minnesota 1 lost all
but a passing interest. I tried to convince
myself to follow the Devils, as they used to
be the Colorado Rockies back before I was

born, but that just didn't
work at all. And there is no
way I can actually force
myself to root for the
"Mighty Ducks of Ana
heim" in a sport that de
pendent on violence, brute
force and stamina.
1 think Anaheim has
done enough, now. First

the "Rally Monkey," now the "Mighty
Ducks"? Thankfully they don't have a foot
ball team.
What I'd wanted to do with this column
was do a sort of retrospective on the year, a
giant culmination of everything I had writ
ten, all the triumphant victories and hum
ble defeats that had been recounted on this
page in the last year.
But I ran into two problems. First, I did
that for the end of the winter volume. Sec
ondly, I was a little scared to see what it
would really look like. Any column whose
debut includes an ode to sloshball and
other West Coast phenomena doesn't ex
actly have the most auspicious start.
Nevertheless, I hope there have been at

least a few columns over the past months
that you have enjoyed, or at least perused
on your way to the crossword in lecture.
Hopefully you too reveled in Clemens' get
ting shelled by the Red Sox last week, and
reveled again (wonder of wonders) in the
Tigers comeback this week, leaving the
Rocket still stuck on win No. 299 as this
goes to press.
Hopefully some of them have made you
laugh. Hopefully you haven't been con
vinced to run a beer mile — I'm not quite
sure about The Daily's liability coverage,
but I think that 1 can't be held responsible
even if you do. Hopefully you haven't been
annoyed by the frequent references to my
hometown teams.
To stretch it a little farther, maybe 1
helped you see the beauty of baseball's
spring training after a long winter, the
beauty of serious backyard whiffle ball, the
beauty of a night game under the lights.
Then again, maybe I didn't. But 1 tried.
So thanks for [jutting up with columns
that didn't always center on collegiate
sports — which, in fact, was the instruction
I was given for this column in the very be

ginning. Thanks for bearing with me when
I strayed up to the professional level or
down to the sandlot in search of suitable
material. Thanks for turning a blind eye, if
you had to, to the sloshball recaps and the
descriptions of the drinking Olympics.
Then again, maybe I don't have to say
goodbye at all? Coming back fora coterm
next year, perhaps Ill take a real page out
of the sports arena — the large retirement
(only without the party, the farewell tour,
the tickertape parade, etc.)...only to be
eclipsed by the comeback next year.
Maybe I'll try to be like Mike and try my
hand at another department.
(Actually, M J is probably much better
suited for baseball than I am for any other
department of this paper).
So a comeback, then, would be right
here, on this field, in front of the hometown
fans.
Time alone, time will tell.

column was a great way to start this whole en
