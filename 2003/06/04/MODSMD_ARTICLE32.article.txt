# Stewart's bittersweet swansong
## 
### 
I write this column with a
solemn heart, as I am sad to
announce that it is one of
my last articles as a staff
member of The Stanford Daily. I
have thoroughly enjoyed the free
reign to rant and complain as
much as I wanted, and I will miss
it sorely when it

passes.
My only re
gret is that I
didn't ask for
more money
because writing
for The Daily
just hasn't been
able to support
my bailer

lifestyle like 1 once hoped it
would. I had to put that platinum
grill on layaway, and I surely
can't afford to be rolling dubs
with the chicken feed they pay
me. Oh, the shame of it all.
Since this is my last column,
I'm going to go ahead and not
even pretend that I'm writing
about sports this time. Over the
past three years, my column has
only been marginally about
sports anyway. And let's face it,
most of the people who are tak
ing the time to read this couldn't
care less about sports, so I might
as well take the time to rant about
the things I never got to rant
about before.
First of all, I'm going to write a
book. It's going to be called,
"From the Friend Zone to the
End/one: How to Turn Platonic
Relationships into Scoring Op
portunities." The only problem is
I have absolutely no game, and
despite my best efforts I have
never successfully achieved this
end. However, I am sure the title
will sell millions and all I have to
do is come up with 300 pages of
filler. Check your local bookseller
— it should be on shelves by late

March.
Second of all, my good friend
Megan Thomas (Suites, Marx
103) has been asking me to men
tion her in my column for years.
She is so unathletic that even I
couldn't justify plugging her
name and those who read this
column regularly know that 1
rarely use relevance or appropri
ateness as criteria. So please let
me take a moment and mention
her now. Fellas, she is very hot,
available and yearning for male
companionship like a Chi-O fora
Bonßon. Please call her before
the line starts forming.
Next, I would like to thank the
Republican Party, groupies, Cana
dians, the Mormon Church,
Catholic Priests, Oakland rioters,
Saddam Hussein, people with
mullets, competitive cheerleaders,
the futility of the African and Latin
American Winter (Mympic delega
tions, fans who throw cell phones,
kids with fatid diseases and Martha
Stewart.
Without their wacky antics
and /or socially unacceptable
actions, 1 might have been
forced to actually write about
sports for three years. They
have provided me with endless
punchlines and irreverent
analogies and 1 cannot express
my sincere gratitude for all that
they have done for me.
Along this same vein, I would
concurrently like to express my
disappointment with both peo
ple who actually read this news
paper. Who exactly do I have to
make fun of before 1 can get
some hate mail from you people?
I think I've picked on every social
demographic imaginable and
the only published letter to the
editor I get is from some dis
gruntled pompom girl who
