# Crew team's finish represents best since 1989
## Cardinal women's crew takes bronze 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's Varsity
Eight brought home a bronze
medal from the Rowing
Championships in Indianapolis
this weekend after racing in ar
guably the most competitive field
in the history of the event.
The No. 1 Cardinal finished
with a time of 6:29:54 seconds,
crossing the finish line three sec
onds behind first-place Harvard
and less than a second behind sec
ond-place Michigan.
The third-place finish is the best
finish for Stanford women's crew
since 1989.
Eleven crews posted times with
in two seconds of one another
heading into the semifinals, mak
ing the field one of the closest that
the NCAA Championships has
ever seen.
Given the high level of competi
tion, combined with unpredictable
weather conditions marked by un
usually strong winds, Stanford
coach Aimee Baker knew that the
Card was faced with quite a chal
lenge.
"My biggest concern was that
they had physically peaked at Pac
-10s," Baker said. "But the V8 was
well-prepared and knew they had a
great opportunity to compete well."
As it turned out, the Cardinal
repeated its dominating perfor
mance at last month's Pac-10
Championships, where Stanford
rowed past top teams from Wash
ington and California for the title.
While finishing ahead of every
Pac-10 school and claiming a
third-place finish was an incredible
accomplishment for the Varsity
Eight, the squad had to fight just to
secure a spot in the Grand Finals.
In the semifinals, Stanford
faced a field that included No. 2
Harvard and past NCAA champi
ons Washington and Brown. With
only the top three teams in each
semifinal earning a spot in the
Grand Finals, the Cardinal had to

defeat one of those three top
ranked teams. Stanford was up to
the challenge, crossing the line just
before Brown.
"I was very proud of the V8
boat," Baker said. "They were on
an emotional high from their suc
cess at Pac-lOs. They brought the
same intensity and performance
[to NCAAs]."
Stanford's Second Eight and
Varsity Four teams did not enjoy
the same success as the Varsity
Eight at NCAAs — both finished in
12th place.
"The JV and V4 were disap

pointed by their placement,"
Baker said. "They performed very
solidly, but just weren't able to
move up."
Overall, the Cardinal placed
ninth in the team standings, one
place better than their perfor
mance last year. 1 larvard won the
team championship title, narrowly
beating out defending champion
Brown and third-place Washing
ton.
According to Baker, Stanford's
success this year was in part due to
an exceptional group of seniors.
"You can't replace the attitude

and work ethic of the senior c lass;
I'm so very proud of them," Baker
said. "They showed the rest of the
team the importance of hard work,
and if that stays with the team,
we're in great shape to come back
here next year."
Meanwhile, the Stanford light
weight crew team competed at the
IRA Championships in Cherry
Hill, N.J.
The lightweight varsity eight,
comprised of five freshman and
four sophomores, improved upon
last year's finish by one spot as well,
placing fifth.
