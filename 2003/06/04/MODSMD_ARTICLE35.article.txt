# Archery finishes season in ninth place
## The 						club sport has its biggest growing seasons ever and makes its mark on the national scene 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As far as club sports go, the Stanford archery
team is slowly starting to emerge as a national
contender.
It ended the season ranked No. 9 based on
the merits of its ninth-place team finish at the
U.S. Intercollegiate Archery Championship
and second-place finishes in the men's and co
ed divisions at the West Regional Collegiate
Championship.
"Earlier this year, we opened a new on-cam
pus range, which has allowed. . . us to get more
and more beginner shooters out there learning
archery," sophomore David Lu said. "If we can
[gather enough funding to enhance the pro
gram], JMU | James Madison University] and
Texas [A&M, the defending national champi
ons] better watch out."
Each of the two tournaments in which the
Cardinal participated consisted of two separate
rounds of competition, the first of which is

known as the FI I A round. During this round,
archers shoot four separate distances — 90, 70,
50 and 30 meters for men, and 70, 60, 50, and
30 for women.
During the week of May 14-17, the Cardinal
participated in the national tournament in Car
bondale, 111., and team captain Keith Coleman
led the way.
In the FI I A round, the co-term Coleman
once again led the men's team, claiming 21st
place overall while senior Mike Lin was right
behind him in 22nd place. Lu also finished the
MIA in 31st place.
Meanwhile, the Stanford women were
slightly less successful as Sherry fin paced the
group with a 429 and a 28th-place finish out of
31 competitors.
In the overall competition, it was again Cole
man and Lin at the top of the leader board for
the Cardinal. Coleman finished 22nd and Lin
came in just behind him in 25th place out of 70
archers. And on the women's side, I loe was the
best Cardinal archer, finishing 35th out of 48
competitors.
Earlier, Stanford claimed 10 overall awards
at the Western Regional in Long Beach on
April 25.
The event attracted some of the top teams
from the western part of the country, including

UCLA and Dine College of the Navajo Nation.
But that didn't stop the Cardinal.
Coleman took an early lead and never
looked back, eventually posting a score of 1440
out of a possible 1448 — good enough for the
individual FITA title. His performance also
earned him a spot on the All-West Team.
The second round of competition, an elimi
nation round, went the Cardinal's way as well,
as only one non-Stanford archer made it to the
medal rounds. In a major upset, Lu defeated
Dine College's Winston Brown. (Brown is the
current all-time record-holder for scoring in
the West Region's elimination round.)
The women's team enjoyed great success
as well. Junior Germaine Hoe and freshman
Sherry Jin, both rookies, held up well against
their more experienced competitors, claim
ing fifth and sixth place, respectively, in the
FITA.
The strides made by this year's squad sug
gest a bright future for the Cardinal club team.
"It's amazing how far this team has come in
such a short time-most of our people first
picked up a bow at one of our beginner prac
tices earlier this year," said Coleman. "Last
June, no one had even heard of the Stanford
program, and now we're taking medals from
teams that have reigned for years."
