# Promising to lead socially responsible lives
## Grads sign pledge 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
In the midst of visible campus
movements on labor issues and
foreign policy, many Stanford
students are participating in a
quieter campaign for soc ial re
sponsibility through the Gradu
ate Pledge, a promise by students
to consider the scxial and ecologi
cal implications of jobs they de
cide to take after graduating.
Now in its third year on the
Farm, this on-campus campaign
is part of a nationwide initiative
that was established in 1987.
The text oft he pledge reads," I
[name] pledge to explore and
take into account the social and
environmental consequences of
any job I consider and will try to
improve these aspects of any or
ganizations for which I work."
" I he pledge is a voluntary
commitment by graduating se
niors— although not limited to
[them] — who will soon be enter
ing the work force to refrain from
passively acceptingjobs and work
conditions and instead to take
into account the scxial and envi
ronmental consequences of any
job and to try to improve them,"
said senior Jessica Man tooth, a
member of Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, the campus or
ganization that oversees the
Graduation Pledge campaign on
campus.
The Pledge was founded at
Humboldt State University in
1987 and has since grown to in
clude numerous colleges and uni
versities nationwide, including six
Ivy League members, Duke Uni

versity and the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology. Manches
ter College coordinates the na
tional Graduate Pledge Alliance
campaign.
Despite the lagging economy,
the Pledge is again proving to be
popular this year. As of earlier this
week, 190 Stanford people had
signed up, 120 of whom are se
niors. year, around 300 stu
dents signed the Pledge, and co
ordinators hope to double that
number this year, although they
stressed the importance of quality
over quantity.
"Ideally, we'd like half of the
senior class to sign the pledge and
hope to have at least double the
number of sign-ups from last
year," said senior Lindsey Cox,
also a member of Students fora
Sustainable Stanford.
"We are targeting all gradu
ates, seniors, master's and Ph.l)
[candidates], GSB [students],
etc.," Mantooth said. "Under
classmen are also encouraged to
sign as an affirmation of their be
liefs and in support of the pledge.
There is no target number. We
want people to take the pledge se
riously and only sign if it is some
thing they agree with and will fol
low."
l he 2003 Pledge has been en
dorsed by over 45 Stanford
groups and departments, as well
as University President John
Hennessy.
"I am encouraged that, even
in difficult economic times, so
many Stanford students recog
nize the importance of making
principled decisions about their
lives and their careers," Hennessy
said.
Stanford students who sign the
pledge will receive a card indicating
their commitment to the pledge and
a green ribbon to wear at graduation,
although there is currently no follow

up or similar form of accountability
involved in signing the Pledge.
"No one is going to call you in five
years to see if your current job prac
tices are in line with the pledge,"
Mantooth said. "But we certainly
hope that people who are taking the
time to sign it will take it seriously. I
think that many of the people who
are signing the pledge are confirm
ing socially and environmentally re
sponsible beliefs that they already
would take into consideration with

any job or future activity."
She continued, "The purpose of
the pledge is to get people thinking
about what their role is in society and
what they can do to make a change.
It is a call to action to remind stu
dents of the ethical implications of
their privileged education. It can
help lead to a socially-conscious citi
zenry and ideally a better world."
