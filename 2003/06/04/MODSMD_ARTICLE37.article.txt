# Police still looking for serial groper
## Women report being assaulted by a young man on a bicycle 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Police Depart
ment is still searching fora man
who has been implicated in the
groping of four female students
on campus. The man, who is de
scribed as a 19- to 25-year old with
dark hair and a medium to heavy
build, allegedly rode up behind
the four women on a bicycle, as
saulted them and rode off.
The incidents are alleged to
have occurred on Mav 22, 23, 26

and 27. Each occurred between
9:15 p.m. and 2 a.m.
The latest wave of assaults
comes at the end of a year in
which 10 sexual crimes were re
ported to the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety. According
to Sgt. Rick Tipton, four of the
cases were sexual battery, one was
a soliciting, one was indecent ex
posure, two were rapes and the
last two fell under the category of
"other."
Stanford has many campus re
sources to deal with sexual assault,
including the Bridge, Counseling
and Psychological Services, 5-
SURE and Vaden Health Center's
sexual assault unit.
Despite these resources for as
sisting students who have been

victims of sexual assault, the
process t an be confusing, or even
threatening, fora student who
has just been attacked.
"I think that very few people
would know what to do after
being raped," said Melissa Abreu,
a peer counselor at the SI 1 PRC.. "I
think the resources need to be
better advertised and the psycho
logical state of the person needs to
be acknowledged.
"Being raped is very traumatic
and it can be very difficult to seek
out resources when a person has
just been abused. Therefore,
make the resources available
without having to go through a
ton of hoops," she continued.
The Bridge is often the re
source students call first when

they have been assaulted. Their
24-hour-a-day phone counseling
offers referrals to CAPS to stu
dents and acts as a first response
organization.
Some months the Bridge re
ceives no c alls reporting sexual as
saults; other months, student
counselors field three or four
calls. "Generally more inci
dents happen during events such
as Exotic Erotic, and the Bridge
generally receives calls the follow
ing day," saicl Natalie Baloga-
Mintz, a live-in counselor at the
Bridge.
"We give referrals to CAPS if
the person is interested in long
term counseling and resources in
the community," she said. "But
we mostly provide a place where
people can talk confidentially
about their feelings."
Although originally intended
as a rape-prevention program, 5-
SURE has become a 112 ree taxi ser

vice to many students.
"The truth is that 5-SURE is
usually used as a taxi service by
most students," said James Poole,
a 5-SURE driver and co-coordi
nator for the SI I PRC next year.
"1 hate to be sexist, but when I
pick up four drunk Canadian
rugby players on a Saturday night
from a party, I know they're not
afraid," he continued.
Poole said that he believes that

5-SURF has prevented some
rapes from occurring, but that the
service doesn't make Stanford
safer.
"I feel that we are effective at
solving people's immediate needs
to get across campus safely, but we
do nothing to solve the problem
of making Stanford actually safe,"
he said. "I would jump for joy if I
lost my job because we were no
longer needed."
