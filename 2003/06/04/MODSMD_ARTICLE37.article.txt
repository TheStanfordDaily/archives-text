### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Police Depart
ment is still searching fora man
who has been implicated in the
groping of four female students
on campus. The man, who is de
scribed as a 19- to 25-year old with
dark hair and a medium to heavy
build, allegedly rode up behind
the four women on a bicycle, as
saulted them and rode off.
The incidents are alleged to
have occurred on Mav 22, 23, 26

and 27. Each occurred between
9:15 p.m. and 2 a.m.
The latest wave of assaults
comes at the end of a year in
which 10 sexual crimes were re
ported to the Stanford Depart

cases were sexual battery, one was
a soliciting, one was indecent ex

last two fell under the category of

"Being raped is very traumatic
and it can be very difficult to seek
out resources when a person has
just been abused. Therefore,
make the resources available
without having to go through a
ton of hoops," she continued.
The Bridge is often the re
source students call first when

they have been assaulted. Their
24-hour-a-day phone counseling
offers referrals to CAPS to stu
dents and acts as a first response
organization.
Some months the Bridge re
ceives no c alls reporting sexual as
saults; other months, student
counselors field three or four
calls. "Generally more inci

as Exotic Erotic, and the Bridge
generally receives calls the follow
