# Hill discusses her two years living in a tree
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kresge Auditorium was filled
Monday night fora conversational
interview with Julia Butterfly Hill,
a writer and activist who stayed in
a thousand-year-old Northern
California redwood for two years
from Dec. 10, 1997, to Dec. 18,
1999, without touching the
ground to protest the logging of
ancient forests.
The event "Your Body on the
Line?" was presented by the Auro
ra Forum, a series of discussions
about American ideals intended to
create an exchange of ideas among
the public. Hill mentioned little
about her actual experience while

living in the tree and focused on
the activist perspective ol her ad
venture.
I lill was interviewed by another
well-known writer and activist, Re
becca Solnit, who put her own life
in danger while protesting at the
Nevada Test Site in the 1980s.
When asked what direct ac
tivism meant to her, Hill first of
fered her definition of activism.
"So often when we say the word
'activist,' it creates a box in your
mind that certain people can lit in
and certain people cannot," Hill
said. "Truly, we are all activists.
The question is not 'Do I want to
be an activist or do I not want to be
an activist?' but 'What kind of ac
tivist do I want to be?' "
Hill said that she hoped her
two-year non-violent protest
would inspire others to take action
and affect change.
"I didn't want to be remem
bered as 'the girl in the tree,' " she
said. "1 wanted to be remembered
as the one who got (people] more
active in their lives."
Hill said it was a "visceral" feel
ing, a "gut reaction," that prompt
ed her to take the drastic step of
selling all her possessions and liv

ing in a forest.
"There was this calling that I
couldn't turn away from," she ex
plained. "You could choose to
walk away but that energy, that
call, is too powerful.
"Some of the greatest changes
in history have been where people
have put their bodies on the line,"
she added.
Hill said that living in the tree
also gave her a "very real perspec

five" by causing her to question ex
isting stereotypes. Her prior bias
against loggers changed once she
realized that because "[their] facts
are different, [their] feelings are
different."
Solnit reminded the audience
that activism is not a two-sided bat
tle.
"It doesn't have to be binary,"

Some students were surprised
by the stories told by the two ac
tivists.
"1 was definitely amazed to
hear how people as young as 14
have already affected change,"
said freshman Devarati Mitra. "It
was interesting to hear [Hill] say
that young people tend to be more
willing to take stands than adults."
