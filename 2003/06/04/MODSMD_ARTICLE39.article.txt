## Socially conscious group invites fasting students to speak on stage 
### LIAN BLOCH 
VVitli the sun blazing on their heads,
sweat pouring down their backs and
sound waves pounding in their ears, fans
of the music group Ozomatli reveled in
the festive atmosphere at Sunday's con
cert at Frost Amphitheatre.
The event, sponsored by the Stanford
Concert Network and the Alumni Associ
ation, was free to all Stanford students.
The concert drew a crowd as diverse as
the band itself that, at its peak, filled half
of the amphitheatre, creating a more in
timate atmosphere.
At the beginning of the show,
Ozomatli, whose lyrics often carry a
strong social message, invited six stu
dents in the midst of fasting fora code
of conduct to come on stage to speak
about their cause. To loud applause
from the audience, the students ex

plained their belief that Stanford needs
to ensure that basic needs of all workers
are met, including a living wage, ade
quate and inexpensive health insur
ance and better educational opportuni
ties.
At the conclusion of the performance,
the "band treated fans to a surprise,
parading off the stage onto the grass.
Ozomatli danced and played their in
struments among their fans, who hud
dled and rallied around the musicians.
1 he ensemble responded to the playful
atmosphere by engaging the crowd in
the "hokey-pokey," among other famil
iar tunes. Despite the harsh sun, the fans'
energy was übiquitously soaring.
The name "Ozomatli" is of Aztec ori
gin, meaning "orchestrator of the jun
gle," fitting with the exotic and eclectic
rhythms and melodies that the group
creates.
In an backstage interview with The
Daily, band leader and bass player Wil-
Dog Abers described Ozomatli's music as
"dance-liink-groove music, with eclectic
influences ranging from salsa to rap. The
music brings together each band mem

bers' varied interests," Ahers said.
Besides six core members of the
group, the rest of ihe ensemble is con
stantly changing.
"Different instruments, different
styles and different people mean that the
music we produce is always evolving,"
Abers said.
Drummer Curtis Watts is one of
Ozomatli's transient members, perform
ing with the group after just four days of
joining the ensemble. As a "hired gun,"
Watt said he enjoys working with
Ozomatli, saying that it is easy to play
with the group because they aren't con
strained to one specific musical genre.
"The music just flowed at the
concert —we all just communicated
through music," Watts said. "We musi
cians have a certain chemistry, a certain
intuition that we share with each other."
()zomatli is next headed overseas fora
European tour and will release their next
album in early 2004.
"I know a lot of great things will come
out of Ofomatli," Watts said. "I'm not a
psychic, but 1 see an exciting future for
this group."
