### ERIK WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Get ready to feel the squeeze. The
budget belt will grow even tighter this
autumn as the University faces a sec
ond straight year of cuts to an unbal
anced budget.
On average, academic and admin
istrative units will be cutting 6.1 per
cent of their budgets for 2003-2004.
Even with these reductions, the Uni
versity's $2.4 billion budget still faces a
deficit of .$l9 million, making fora

second year of deficits following bud
get cuts.
There will be layoffs. There will be
reductions in academic spending and
services, staffing and maintenance.
However, administrators say tbey are
holding out hope that such measures
will not greatly affect schools and de
partments on campus.
"I don't think the budget cuts will
have a major impact on the Universi
ty," said Tim Warner, vice provost for
University budget and auxiliaries
management. "But, you will notice

some belt-tightening as these reduc
tions get implemented."
No faculty or instructors will be
among the hundred or so layoffs Warn
er is predicting, due in large part to the
salary freeze enacted in February,
which has realized $8 million in savings,
according to Warner.
Schools compensate by increasing
enrollment, cutting back on aid
To narrow the University's deficit,
departments and schools across cam
pus are cutting $23.4 million from their

budgets in areas such as special re
search, departmental financial aid,
technology and teaching supplies. Most
departments are also observing a hiring
freeze, allowing vacant positions to re
main unfilled.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, Stanford University's largest
school, is swallowing a 5.5 percent cut in
its general funds allowance by asking at
least two departments to dip into re
serve funds.
