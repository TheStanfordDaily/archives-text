# University faces further budget restrictions
## 
### ERIK WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Get ready to feel the squeeze. The
budget belt will grow even tighter this
autumn as the University faces a sec
ond straight year of cuts to an unbal
anced budget.
On average, academic and admin
istrative units will be cutting 6.1 per
cent of their budgets for 2003-2004.
Even with these reductions, the Uni
versity's $2.4 billion budget still faces a
deficit of .$l9 million, making fora

second year of deficits following bud
get cuts.
There will be layoffs. There will be
reductions in academic spending and
services, staffing and maintenance.
However, administrators say tbey are
holding out hope that such measures
will not greatly affect schools and de
partments on campus.
"I don't think the budget cuts will
have a major impact on the Universi
ty," said Tim Warner, vice provost for
University budget and auxiliaries
management. "But, you will notice

some belt-tightening as these reduc
tions get implemented."
No faculty or instructors will be
among the hundred or so layoffs Warn
er is predicting, due in large part to the
salary freeze enacted in February,
which has realized $8 million in savings,
according to Warner.
Schools compensate by increasing
enrollment, cutting back on aid
To narrow the University's deficit,
departments and schools across cam
pus are cutting $23.4 million from their

budgets in areas such as special re
search, departmental financial aid,
technology and teaching supplies. Most
departments are also observing a hiring
freeze, allowing vacant positions to re
main unfilled.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, Stanford University's largest
school, is swallowing a 5.5 percent cut in
its general funds allowance by asking at
least two departments to dip into re
serve funds.
"We hope the education pro
grams will not be materially af
fected by any of the reallocations
or redirected funds use that we
have employed to make the bud
get cuts work," said Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Sharon
Long.
Budgets for the School of Law,
Dean of Research and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation are taking cuts of 5.3, 5 and
7.7 percent, respectively.
"We will have less money avail
able to help support special re
search activities initiated by the de
partments and faculty, and we will
not be able to fully support pro
jected growth in our interdiscipli
nary program activities," said
Pamela Matson, dean of the School
of Earth Sciences, which is taking a
7.5 percent cut in its general funds
allocation.
Some schools have compensat
ed for reductions by increasing

revenues. The School of Educa
tion, for example, was slated fora
7.1 percent cut to its general funds
budget but has narrowed that to
4.9 percent through revenue en
hancements.
The School of Engineering was
able to admit approximately 75 ad
ditional master's students next
year, which will bring down the
level of cuts from 7.1 percent to 3.4
percent.
"The tuition provided by these
incremental students eliminates
cuts we would otherwise have to
make of the same dollar amounts,"
said School of Engineering Dean
Jim Plummer.
Both the Schools of Education
and Engineering, however, are
still cutting back on departmental
financial aid.
"We have cut back the number
of school-supported graduate fel
lowships as part of our budget cuts,
but we are committed to raising
those numbers back up again,"
Plummer said.
More rejection letters went
out to applicants for doctoral
programs in the School of Edu

cation because of financial aid
concerns.
"We were concerned about
being able to provide funding,"
said Deborah Stipek, dean of the
School of Education.
At the Graduate School of Busi
ness, the situation is the reverse â€”
the Business School is increasing its
financial aid budget by 5 percent
next year while enrollment will re
main unchanged, according to Dan
Rudolph, senior associate dean and
chief operating officer at the GSB.
The School operates more on its
own funding than other schools, ac
cording to Warner.
The University is also pumping
more money into undergraduate
and graduate financial aid, as it is
Stanford's policy to meet the
demonstrated financial needs of its
students. Applications for aid next
year are up in large numbers, dri
ven by a poor economy and 5-per
cent tuition hike.
Undergraduate tuition is set at
$28,564 for 2003-2004, compared
with $17,775 a decade ago, or
$22,609 when adjusted for inflation.
Despite fee increases, students to

experience Very little differently'
Many fees are also increasing
next year, as students are being
asked to help pay fora 5.3 percent
cut in the Office of Student Affairs
budget. The budget encompasses
a wide array of student life and ser
vices at Stanford, including funds
lor the Dean of Students, Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students,
Vaden Health Center, and the
University Registrar. Also housed
under the Student Affairs budget
are funds for Residential Educa
tion, community centers, the Haas
Center and the Career Develop
ment Center.
"The average student should
see and experience very little dif
ferently next year," said Vice
Provost for Student Allah's Gene
Awakuni. "In a few areas, some
students may see increased fees or
limited changes in service."
Looming budget cuts of $2.6
million for Stanford's Information
Technology Systems and Services
will mean even slower-than-aver
age access to network applications
such as AXESS during peak usage.

The department plans on laying
off 12 employees in various areas.
"These cuts will change lives,"
wrote Chris Handley, chief infor
mation officer for ITSS in a memo
to his staff. "They take place at a
time [when] we still need to bring
on new people with unique tal
ents for developing institutional
needs."
Stanford Athletics, which is par
tially financially independent
through endowment income and
television broadcasting rights, may
also feel the pinch. Its general
funds budget is being cut 7.4 per
cent, but according to Athletic Di
rector Ted Leland, there will be
minimal impact on athletics, phys
ical education and recreation at
Stanford. While he does not fore
see any programs being cut, he did
point out a possibility for cuts in
recreation.
The department will lay off
eight employees over the next two
years, but there are no plans to in
clude coaches or training staff
among them, Leland said. Coach
es and staff have also been subject
to the salary freeze, and Leland

says 112 urther freezes will make it dif
ficult to retain them at competitive
levels.
An extension of the one-year
salary freeze would be hard to
swallow, according to Provost John
Etcliemendy. 1 le predicts the need
for further cuts and restructuring
in fiscal year 2005, which begins
Sept. 1,2004.
Of this year's budget cuts, how
ever, he emphasized, "1 think
there was enough fat in the system
that people will not notice the ef
fects of these cuts."
Peer institutions across the
country face somewhat similar fi
nancial situations. Harvard insti
tuted a "soft freeze on hiring" last
autumn and faces a budget deficit
in 2005, according to the Harvard
Crimson.
Yale is making modest cuts in its
budget for next year, although it
remains balanced for the seventh
year in a row, the Yale Daily News
reported. The University of Cali
fornia recently cut funding across
the-board by 20 to 50 percent and
has enacted a 10 percent tuition
hike.
