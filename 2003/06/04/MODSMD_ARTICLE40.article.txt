# Tech toys alter students' lives

### MIKEY LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With one hand on the bicycle brake and the other
pressing a cell phone to her ear, a student chats on the
phone while in transit — she's a busy girl and work
ing while she travels allows her to save time.
Back at the dorms, another student runs up to
check the away messages of his friends — and that of
the cute lacrosse player that sits across from her in
Bioethics section. He's already at dinner.. . but his
idle time reads only 10 minutes, so she'll probably be
able to catch up to him.
A senior makes a run to Safeway to purchase five
handles of vodka fora party he's throwing on Friday,
and he picks the Smirnoff over the Skyy because even
though he thinks the latter tastes better, his Safeway
Club card saves him $4. As he swipes his card, the su
permarket's system takes note of the purchase.
"It's interesting to see how student life is co-evolv
ing with technology and digital media," said Fred
Turner, an assistant professor of communication who
teaches a course entitled "The Social Impact of Digi
tal Media."
"Take courtship for example," he said. "With in
stant messaging, we're almost going back to the
Romeo and Juliet era where we send notes to each
other .. . courting by prose, that's beautiful.
"But it shapes the way people get to know each
other when they either have access to each other
24/7 or presume they do," he continued. "You can
be with someone without actually being with some
one. That's amazing."
Courtship has allowed those dating — or interest
ed in dating — to dodge awkward face-time, especial
ly early in a dating stage, or to say things they might
not normally say in person.
"It's good when you're first getting to know some
one," said Natalie Lozano, a sophomore. "A girl won't
call up a guy just to ask, 'How was your day? How was
class? What are you up to?' But that's definitely some
thing acceptable on [instant messenger]."
Lozano and her roommate Sterling Witzke, also a
sophomore, agreed that the prevalence of instant
messaging is a good thing.
"It's good for courting, in general," Witzke said.
"You can check what people are doing by looking at
their away message. You can't do that with voice mail."

"While it makes it easier to say things without con
frontation, there are some problems," Lozano said.
"Sometimes you can't tell the tone or emotion behind
words."
There are also other differences between the writ
ten word and the spoken word that some have noted.
"Instant messenging puts cleverness at a premi
um," Turner said.
Students claim that new technologies also simply
make life easier — even for those who do not claim to
be technophiles.
"I don't become obsessed with a new device or re
volve my life around one," said John Stockdale, a
freshman, whose technological arsenal includes a lap
top, a desktop computer with two CD burners and

New technologies like text messaging and Internet
access on cellular phones allow students to keep in touch
in ways that were not possible a decade ago.
