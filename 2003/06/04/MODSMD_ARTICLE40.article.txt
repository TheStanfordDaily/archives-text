# Tech toys alter students' lives
## 
### MIKEY LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With one hand on the bicycle brake and the other
pressing a cell phone to her ear, a student chats on the
phone while in transit — she's a busy girl and work
ing while she travels allows her to save time.
Back at the dorms, another student runs up to
check the away messages of his friends — and that of
the cute lacrosse player that sits across from her in
Bioethics section. He's already at dinner.. . but his
idle time reads only 10 minutes, so she'll probably be
able to catch up to him.
A senior makes a run to Safeway to purchase five
handles of vodka fora party he's throwing on Friday,
and he picks the Smirnoff over the Skyy because even
though he thinks the latter tastes better, his Safeway
Club card saves him $4. As he swipes his card, the su
permarket's system takes note of the purchase.
"It's interesting to see how student life is co-evolv
ing with technology and digital media," said Fred
Turner, an assistant professor of communication who
teaches a course entitled "The Social Impact of Digi
tal Media."
"Take courtship for example," he said. "With in
stant messaging, we're almost going back to the
Romeo and Juliet era where we send notes to each
other .. . courting by prose, that's beautiful.
"But it shapes the way people get to know each
other when they either have access to each other
24/7 or presume they do," he continued. "You can
be with someone without actually being with some
one. That's amazing."
Courtship has allowed those dating — or interest
ed in dating — to dodge awkward face-time, especial
ly early in a dating stage, or to say things they might
not normally say in person.
"It's good when you're first getting to know some
one," said Natalie Lozano, a sophomore. "A girl won't
call up a guy just to ask, 'How was your day? How was
class? What are you up to?' But that's definitely some
thing acceptable on [instant messenger]."
Lozano and her roommate Sterling Witzke, also a
sophomore, agreed that the prevalence of instant
messaging is a good thing.
"It's good for courting, in general," Witzke said.
"You can check what people are doing by looking at
their away message. You can't do that with voice mail."

"While it makes it easier to say things without con
frontation, there are some problems," Lozano said.
"Sometimes you can't tell the tone or emotion behind
words."
There are also other differences between the writ
ten word and the spoken word that some have noted.
"Instant messenging puts cleverness at a premi
um," Turner said.
Students claim that new technologies also simply
make life easier — even for those who do not claim to
be technophiles.
"I don't become obsessed with a new device or re
volve my life around one," said John Stockdale, a
freshman, whose technological arsenal includes a lap
top, a desktop computer with two CD burners and

New technologies like text messaging and Internet
access on cellular phones allow students to keep in touch
in ways that were not possible a decade ago.
dual processors, a UNIX server,
Bose stereo, iPod mp3 player and
cell phone. "I've embraced tech
nology as simplifying and improv
ing my life. 1 bring my iPod instead
of lugging around hundreds of
CDs. It makes life easier."
Stockdale also takes advantage
of his laptop's wireless capability.
"The pursuit of information is
what we're here at Stanford for,"he
said. "It's handy to be able to work
where you want, when you want —
in the lounge, outside on the lawn."
The connectivity that students
have can be a problem as well, ac
cording to Turner.
"It's the problem of übiquity,"
he said. "The 'always on' problem.
If you're always on, you can always
be found."
Students acknowledged that
this can be both good and bad.
"Cell phones are great to keep
in contact with each other, but it's
always nice to drop off the radar
every once in awhile," said
Matthew Mrazek, a junior. "But if
you have a cell phone, people feel

like they can contact you whenev
er. Other people's expectations
that they can reach you any time
can be frustrating."
Onny Chatterjee, a junior ma
joring in science, technology and
society, agreed.
"People get pissed at me when
they can't get a hold of me on [in
stant messenger]," he said. "It's as
if it were some sort of social obliga
tion that I have to them."
Shopping creates a forum for
students, as well. Whether they are
rabid consumers or just need to
buy the occasional sundries, tech
nologies allow supermarkets to
track purchases.
"Young people are such vora
cious consumers," Turner said.
"Students may feel they're in the
Stanford bubble, but they're a part
of a larger world. Each time you
use something or buy something,
it can be tracked. You leave a so
called digital shadow behind.
These digital shadows can be
tracked, but they also have value.
The data can be aggregated and
profiles can be made of your pur
chasing habits. On the other hand,
that can be sold, and then you're
doing work for someone and
you're not getting paid."

According to Susan Kell, a cus
tomer service representative based
out of Safeway's main office in
Tempe, Ariz., there are perks to
using the club card.
"People establish their informa
tion, they get the sale price, but we
also have benefits set up for them,"
Kell said. "They can get 125 airline
miles credited for every $250 dol
lars they spend. We also have script
donations worked into the system."
However, Kell admitted that
the company uses information
garnered through the card's usage
to fuel decisions made in purchas
ing.
"Our system creates a list and it
helps in ordering what sells," she
said. "If you have a product that
doesn't sell, it's a good indication
not to carry it anymore."
Stockdale said, "With digital
technology, you have to trust that
the people running the system
aren't going to abuse it and that
the technology itself is resistant to
abuse. Safeway probably doesn't
care what you, as an individual,
buy. It's not practical to track indi
viduals, but it is beneficial for the
company to track the larger trends
to establish demographics and
trends in purchases."

While Turner says he doesn't nec
essaiily see it as evil, such monitoring
could have a negative potential.
"We're seeing a co-evolution of
something that's potentially dan
gerous," he said. "People are trad
ing their digital shadows for con
venience, but they have no control
over what happens [to that infor
mation]. If there are systems
through which we can control the
creation and use of our digital
shadows, I think it [would be po
tentially less problematic]."
A government organization, on
the other hand, already has the
ability to track more than just the
purchase trends of consumers..
"Students don't seem to be
aware of the problems that their
activity can create," Turner said.
"If you want to organize an anti-
Iraq protest and if the government
wants to track your actions, moni
toring you is so much easier [with
technology]."
"Fear of this goes back to the
idea of trust," Stockdale said. "The
fact of the matter is that govern
ment organizations can do whatev
er they want with tracking. It's all
about the legal guidelines and safe
guards that help impede abuse of
information."

idle time reads only 10 minutes, so she'll probably be
able to catch up to him.
A senior makes a run to Safeway to purchase five
handles of vodka fora party he's throwing on Friday,
and he picks the Smirnoff over the Skyy because even
though he thinks the latter tastes better, his Safeway
Club card saves him $4. As he swipes his card, the su

"It's interesting to see how student life is co-evolv
ing with technology and digital media," said Fred
Turner, an assistant professor of communication who
teaches a course entitled "The Social Impact of Digi
tal Media."
"Take courtship for example," he said. "With in
stant messaging, we're almost going back to the
Romeo and Juliet era where we send notes to each
other .. . courting by prose, that's beautiful.
"But it shapes the way people get to know each
other when they either have access to each other
24/7 or presume they do," he continued. "You can
be with someone without actually being with some
one. That's amazing."
Courtship has allowed those dating — or interest
ed in dating — to dodge awkward face-time, especial
ly early in a dating stage, or to say things they might
not normally say in person.
"It's good when you're first getting to know some
one," said Natalie Lozano, a sophomore. "A girl won't
call up a guy just to ask, 'How was your day? How was
class? What are you up to?' But that's definitely some
thing acceptable on [instant messenger]."
Lozano and her roommate Sterling Witzke, also a
sophomore, agreed that the prevalence of instant
messaging is a good thing.
"It's good for courting, in general," Witzke said.
"You can check what people are doing by looking at
their away message. You can't do that with voice mail."

"While it makes it easier to say things without con
frontation, there are some problems," Lozano said.
"Sometimes you can't tell the tone or emotion behind
words."
There are also other differences between the writ
ten word and the spoken word that some have noted.
"Instant messenging puts cleverness at a premi
um," Turner said.
Students claim that new technologies also simply
make life easier — even for those who do not claim to
be technophiles.
"I don't become obsessed with a new device or re
volve my life around one," said John Stockdale, a
freshman, whose technological arsenal includes a lap
top, a desktop computer with two CD burners and

New technologies like text messaging and Internet
access on cellular phones allow students to keep in touch
in ways that were not possible a decade ago.
dual processors, a UNIX server,
Bose stereo, iPod mp3 player and
cell phone. "I've embraced tech
nology as simplifying and improv
ing my life. 1 bring my iPod instead
of lugging around hundreds of
CDs. It makes life easier."
Stockdale also takes advantage
of his laptop's wireless capability.
"The pursuit of information is
what we're here at Stanford for,"he
said. "It's handy to be able to work
where you want, when you want —
in the lounge, outside on the lawn."
The connectivity that students
have can be a problem as well, ac
cording to Turner.
"It's the problem of übiquity,"
he said. "The 'always on' problem.
If you're always on, you can always
be found."
Students acknowledged that
this can be both good and bad.
"Cell phones are great to keep
in contact with each other, but it's
always nice to drop off the radar
every once in awhile," said
Matthew Mrazek, a junior. "But if
you have a cell phone, people feel

like they can contact you whenev
er. Other people's expectations
that they can reach you any time
can be frustrating."
Onny Chatterjee, a junior ma
joring in science, technology and
society, agreed.
"People get pissed at me when
they can't get a hold of me on [in
stant messenger]," he said. "It's as
if it were some sort of social obliga
tion that I have to them."
Shopping creates a forum for
students, as well. Whether they are
rabid consumers or just need to
buy the occasional sundries, tech
nologies allow supermarkets to
track purchases.
"Young people are such vora
cious consumers," Turner said.
"Students may feel they're in the
Stanford bubble, but they're a part
of a larger world. Each time you
use something or buy something,
it can be tracked. You leave a so
called digital shadow behind.
These digital shadows can be
tracked, but they also have value.
The data can be aggregated and
profiles can be made of your pur
chasing habits. On the other hand,
that can be sold, and then you're
doing work for someone and
you're not getting paid."

According to Susan Kell, a cus
tomer service representative based
out of Safeway's main office in
Tempe, Ariz., there are perks to
using the club card.
"People establish their informa
tion, they get the sale price, but we
also have benefits set up for them,"
Kell said. "They can get 125 airline
miles credited for every $250 dol
lars they spend. We also have script
donations worked into the system."
However, Kell admitted that
the company uses information
garnered through the card's usage
to fuel decisions made in purchas
ing.
"Our system creates a list and it
helps in ordering what sells," she
said. "If you have a product that
doesn't sell, it's a good indication
not to carry it anymore."
Stockdale said, "With digital
technology, you have to trust that
the people running the system
aren't going to abuse it and that
the technology itself is resistant to
abuse. Safeway probably doesn't
care what you, as an individual,
buy. It's not practical to track indi
viduals, but it is beneficial for the
company to track the larger trends
to establish demographics and
trends in purchases."

While Turner says he doesn't nec
essaiily see it as evil, such monitoring
could have a negative potential.
"We're seeing a co-evolution of
something that's potentially dan
gerous," he said. "People are trad
ing their digital shadows for con
venience, but they have no control
over what happens [to that infor
mation]. If there are systems
through which we can control the
creation and use of our digital
shadows, I think it [would be po
tentially less problematic]."
A government organization, on
the other hand, already has the
ability to track more than just the
purchase trends of consumers..
"Students don't seem to be
aware of the problems that their
activity can create," Turner said.
"If you want to organize an anti-
Iraq protest and if the government
wants to track your actions, moni
toring you is so much easier [with
technology]."
"Fear of this goes back to the
idea of trust," Stockdale said. "The
fact of the matter is that govern
ment organizations can do whatev
er they want with tracking. It's all
about the legal guidelines and safe
guards that help impede abuse of
information."
