# Issue of graduating senior as committee member addressed by Howe
## ASSU holds its final meeting 
### ILENA C. GEORGE STAFF WRITER 
Last night the ASSU Undergraduate Senate met
for the last time this academic year.
Vice President Joey Natoli, a sophomore, re
ported that he had met with representatives from
Stanford's Greek community and several adminis
trators to discuss how fraternities and sororities can
improve their safety and general operations next
year.
"I'd say that the Greek community has a bumpy
future," Natoli said.
Additionally, the Senate passed a bill from the
Nominations Commission that recommended the
appointment of graduating senior Michelle Leung
as the undergraduate representative to the Haas
Center Director Search Committee, although there
was some question of whether the nomination will
be found constitutional. The committee will meet
over the summer, and the controversy arises from

the issue of whether a student is able to serve on a
committee after his or her graduation.
"The tradition has been that if it's during sum
mer quarter and the student is returning, then it's
not a problem," said Nanci Howe, assistant dean
and director of student activities. Since Leung will
not be a registered student after the end of this
quarter, the legality of her appointment is ques
tionable.
The Senate also approved a bill to provide
funding to Sisters At Stanford, the group that
sponsored the Black Male Awards after its original
sponsor, Esface, was found to have a commercial
name. The recently held ceremony recognized the
achievements of several community members in a
variety of categories, including "Black Male Schol
ar of the Year" and "Black Male Professor of the
Year."
The Senate also passed a bill approving several
changes to the Judicial Charter's By-Laws that had
been created by the Graduate Student Council.
