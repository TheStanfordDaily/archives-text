# Hard drugs are rare on campus
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students and administrators agree that while alco
hol and marijuana are widespread at Stanford, over
all drug use is not a problem. Although administra
tors are concerned primarily with the prevalence of
"soft drugs," students, if concerned at all, are uneasy
only about the use of "hard drugs."
Alcohol and drug educator Ralph Castro does
not consider substance use to be a major problem
at Stanford.
"For the most part, the majority of Stanford stu
dents make good decisions and make healthy choic
es," he said. "We do experience some serious issues
every year with alcohol and drug use and abuse, and
it does become a problem for this small minority of
students and sometimes their living communities,
but, all in all, most students act responsibly."
J ulie Lythcott-Haims, assistant vice provost for stu
dent affairs and dean of freshman and transfer stu
dents, agreed with Castro.
"My own perception is that drug abuse is not much
of a problem at Stanford." she said. "My colleagues at
Vaden have confirmed that this is true."
Resident Assistant Russell Kizor commented,
"There will always be individuals who choose to abuse
and overuse substances. However, I consider drug
use and abuse no more of a problem here at Stanford
than at any other university."
When asked about the pervasiveness of illegal sub
stances on campus, students uniformly answered that
they are not prevalent and not problematic. Most stu
dents seemed pleased that drug use is not widespread
at Stanford, but one jokingly expressed a more nega
tive view.
"Drug use at Stanford is highly under-spread," he
complained. "When 1 arrived here from New York I
had the impression of arriving at a day camp where
the kids hadn't yet heard of drugs."
Alcohol and marijuana are the most commonly
used drugs at Stanford, according to both students
and administrators, though there is disagreement
about the threat that they pose.
Sophomore Adam Ballew estimates that most
Stanford students drink, about 20
percent smoke pot and few use
harder drugs, though none of this
poses a problem.
Another sophomore, when
asked if drug use is a problem at
Stanford, answered, "not at all."
Some members of the adminis
tration, however, view the use of
these "soft drugs," like alcohol and
marijuana, as a problematic phe
nomenon. Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo said
marijuana use in the dorms is un
fair to other students.
"In terms of living as a house,
it is incredibly disrespectful as a
violation of the law but also as it
violates the rights of their peers
who do not smoke pot and do not
want to be affected by it," she
said.
Lythcott-Haims instead cited al
cohol as the greatest problem, call
ing it,"the most threatening and
dangerous form of substance
abuse on campus."
"The most frequently abused or
misused substance is alcohol," Cas
tro concurred. "Issues related to
alcohol misuse at Stanford tend to
garner the most attention and re
sources."
Castro described the impact of
harder drugs, saying, "Other ille
gal substances, including ecstasy,
cocaine, speed, etc. are used rarely
and generally by an extremely
small percentage of students."
Camarillo, like Castro, acknowl
edged the presence of other drugs,
such as ecstasy, whippits, cocaine
and heroin. These, however, are
not found only at Stanford, but
rather represent "the same trou
bling trends as [on] other campus
es and high schools."
Some students consider the use
of these drugs more dangerous
than that of the more prevalent
soft drugs.
Coterminal student Lexi Sup
pes noted, "Stanford harbors a
number of hard-drug users who
tend to keep their use very pri
vate, as they are doing much
more addictive and frowned
upon drugs like crystal meth
and heroin. No doubt these kids
are fewer in number, but their
drug use is a much bigger part
of their life."
One RA shared the same
heightened level of concern for
users of hard drugs.
"As the current resident assis
tant of a Row house, I have wit
nessed students experimenting
with mushrooms, ecstasy, co
caine, crystal meth and various
prescription drugs such as Ritalin
and Valium," he said. "I think that
uppers are the most dangerous
because they engender a secretive
culture due to the taboo nature of
the drugs. For this reason, I be
lieve uppers are highly socially
addictive."
Many students, however, are
untroubled by the use of hard
drugs on campus.

One sophomore stated that
while hard drugs are certainly not
widespread, cocaine, mushrooms
and prescription drugs can easily
be found.
"Hard drugs are anywhere, but
are fairly taboo, even among stu
dents, and [minimally used]," the
sophomore said.
Junior Dawn DePetris said,
"There are harder drugs on cam
pus that are used among upper
classmen. But this is probably be
cause living in a co-op or a Row
house makes it easier to do those
types of drugs rather than in a
freshman dorm where there is
more of a stigma by new students
and staff."
Indeed, many community
members commented on the in
creased rate of drug use among
upperclassmen.
According to Castro, "Frosh
tend to use substances at a lower
rate and quantity than other stu
dents."
One sophomore believes that
most drug use occurs between
sophomore and senior year.
Students and administrators
generally agreed that drug use
grows more intense among older
students, both in drug type and
frequency of use.
One coterminal student com
mented, "Stanford kids play
around with drugs the most
sophomore and junior year, but
those among us doing addictive
drugs tend to be fifth years or sixth
years who are having a hard time
finishing."
In addition to age, gender
might be related to drug use. Cas
tro noted that men at Stanford
tend to drink more, and many
students noticed that men are
more likely to use hard drugs.
Students also named some on
campus residences typically asso
ciated with high levels of drug
use, but all preferred that the spe
cific residences not be named in
The Daily.
According to Camarillo, resi
dence deans have noticed a con
nection between regular drug
use and social and academic diffi
culties.
"This does not mean that every
case is associated with a student
flunking out of Stanford, but many
cases are associated with failure to
excel academically and socially,"
she explained.
Almost all students increase
their substance intake in some
fashion after arriving at Stanford,
but this may be attributed to a
number of factors other than the
school itself.
"I have definitely increased my
drug use, but that doesn't mean it
wasn't really prevalent in high
school," one junior explained. "I
am just better able to handle it
now."
One sophomore argued that
Stanford is not a factor in his deci
sion to use drugs.
"It is the fact that I am away
from my parents," he said. "Not
being at home has allowed me to
do drugs all the time. Thank you,
college."
