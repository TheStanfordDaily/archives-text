# New laundry fees to be $28 each quarter
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Instead of scrounging to find quarters or try
ing to fix a broken card reader, Stanford under
graduates will pay a single fee of $28 per quarter
for their laundry needs as of fall quarter 2003.
Beginning this fall, all laundry costs will be in
cluded in students' tuition bills, saving under
graduates from paying for each individual use.
Currently, students pay $ 1 to do one load of
laundry in either a washer or a dryer either by
using change or money credited to Stanford ID
cards through the StanfordCardPlan.
Old washers, faulty dryers and broken card
readers are common complaints that the Un
dergraduate Housing and Operations Office
hopes to remedy through implementation of
this new laundry service. After comparing sev
eral different universities' laundry methods,
both Undergraduate Housing and the ASSU
thought Princeton University's model of pre
payment would better serve the Stanford un
dergraduate community.
"Student surveys indicated several laundry
concerns, including how well the card system
was working," said Imogen Church, manager
for Undergraduate Housing Operations with
Student Housing. "Coincidentally, our group
and the ASSU both looked at the Princeton
laundry model and agreed that it would be a
better alternative at meeting student needs.
The laundry system worked great at Princeton
and we hope it will do the same thing here."
Each student will be charged $28 per quar
ter, accounting for the cost of bringing in new
machines and increasing utility fees. ASSU Cost
of Living Director Sarah Schulman, a sopho
more, contacted administrators and students to

find methods to reduce financial expenditures
for Stanford students.
"We thought laundry was one obvious place
where we could cut costs and better meet stu
dent needs," Schulman said. "Especially stu
dents on financial aid would benefit since laun
dry expenses would be part of the tuition fee."
The only concerns Schulman expressed was
a lack of student involvement in the decision
making process to convert to a new laundry ini
tiative. As a remedy, the ASSU Nominations
Commission is creating an undergraduate
housing panel to gauge student response to the
laundry program.
"This is a major win for cost-of-living issues
on campus," said ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli, a sophomore. "It's a campaign that

Nadiya [Figueroa, ASSU president] and I were
planning on continuing next year, so I'm really
glad to see that it's already a win."
Students will see the new laundry plan at
work beginning next fall, and if the plan proves
successful, Stanford may also convert laundry
methods in graduate housing. While adminis
trators hope that the laundry service serves as
an educational guide for water conservation
and doing larger loads, students focused on
other benefits of the initiative.
"I hate broken change machines and when
the washers and dryers don't work," said fresh
man Ratul Narain. "I look forward to next year
when I'll have better machines and 1 won't
need to scavenge dark corners of my room for
quarters."
