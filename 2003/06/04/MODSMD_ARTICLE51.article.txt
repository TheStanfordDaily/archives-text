### Jennifer Graham Anthony Ha 
Over the past two days, more than 20() students
have received an e-mail written by the co-president of
the Stanford College Republicans alleging that he had
seen five members of the Coalition for Labor Justice
eating at the Treehouse, in supposed violation of the
fast being conducted to protest University labor policy.
Press representatives of the coalition did not
want to release a public statement in response to the
allegations. However, other coalition members de
nied the accusations.
"As someone who spent this week watching my
friends get weaker and weaker, I find it insensitive
and insulting that these unfounded allegations
were made and then circulated," said senior La
vanya Chekuru.
On Monday evening, sophomore Joe Fairbanks,
co-president of the College Republicans, sent an e
mail to the "republicans-chat" mailing list claiming
that he had spotted several members of the coali
tion, one "wearing his 'I'm fasting fora Code of
Conduct' sticker," eating at the Treehouse.
Since then, the e-mail has been forwarded to sev
eral other campus mailing lists, including Toyon

Hall's and the Stanford Jewish-American Alliance's.
According to Majordomo, the Toyon list alone has
212 subscribers.
Fairbanks said in the e-mail that he has been
doing "investigations" of the coalition and their
"fabrication of information."
Fairbanks later told The Daily that he could not
"identify the people by name or who they are actu
ally; 1 can only tell you that there were people at the
Treehouse that were wearing their stickers [identi
fying them as fasters] and eating at the same time."
He also said that he knew "of their deep involve
ment in SLAC and the groups organizing it."
During the past week, many students associated
with the fast took part in shorter solidarity fasts
ranging from half a day to several days in length. As
part of this, many of them wore stickers indicating
that they were fasting. Of the six students who
began fasting on Wednesday, only two, sophomore
Anna Mumford and junior Leticia Ramirez, are
prominent members of the coalition.
Fairbanks added, "I agree with [the coalition] that
fFhe Daily] should not be running this story because
there's no hard evidence to prove that they were there.
It is simply one person's word against the other."
