# Report finds little faculty inequity
## Univ. examines gender balance 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
One out of eight in the Chemical Engineering De
partment, two out of3l in the Mechanical Engineering
Department, three out of 31 in the Computer Science
Department — these statistics represent the number
of female associate and full professors in these three
University departments. These figures, reflecting a
striking disparity between the number of men and
women who are tenured faculty members, were
among the many issues addressed in an interim report
released last month by the Provost's Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Faculty.
One of the subcommittees focused on issues involv
ing compensation, resources and recognition. Rather
than looking at salary alone, the subcommittee ana
lyzed data on laboratory space, equipment, start-up
funds, research funds and summer salary support.
"Overall, the overwhelming significance of these
data for gender is their insignificance," the report said.
"There seems to be no pattern of disparity that sug
gests any systemic gender inequity."
The subcommittee's data implies immense im
provement over the findings of a report issued 10 years
ago by a committee assigned to investigate the recruit
ment and retention of women faculty.
"Forty-three percent of Stanford departments still
have no tenured women," the 1993 report said. "Dur
ing the last five years, in departments where there were
new faculty hired, almost 40 percent hired no women."
The 1993 report also noted that "only at two tech
nical schools, Cal Tech and MIT, is the percentage of
women faculty lower than ours."
Deborah Rhode, a professor in the Law School and
chair of the current committee, said she believes the
new report demonstrates that the University has made
drastic improvements over the last 10 years.
"I think there's been a great deal of effort by the ad
ministration to try to ensure gender equity in hiring
and promotion and retention, and a variety of strate-
gies have really begun to pay off,"
Rhode said.
This new approach has included
efforts ranging from "broadening
the search process and ensuring
that the candidate pools are diverse
and that the process proceeds fair
ly" to structural changes like day
care services and better accommo
dations for spouses.
"On every front the University
has been making serious efforts,"
she said.
Nonetheless, the report makes a
variety of suggestions on how to
make Stanford a more woman
friendly place. Many of the recom
mendations include ways to in
crease the number of women in de
partments in which they are under
represented — for example, mak
ing departments more adaptable to
special circumstances, monitoring
search processes or "advertising in
specialty journals targeted at
women."
Female faculty members havf
other changes they wquld to r ,
add to that list, spec ideally regard
ing family issues and promotion.
"I don't feel that I have been re
garded with any less respect than
the male colleagues," said Camilla
Kao, an assistant professor of chem
ical engineering.
Chemical engineering is a cam

pus department that lacks any fe
male tenured professors.
"In terms of attention, I feel that
I have gotten the same attention
relative to everyone else," she said.
"But 1 still think things could be
done."
She and others feel that one of
the most significant problems for
female faculty is the conflict be
tween child rearing and the tenure
track.
Mary Baker, an assistant profes
sor of computer science, cited per
sonal experiences to exemplify the
often-unbridgeable gap between
raising a child and attaining tenure.
"I have recendy been denied
tenure," Baker said. "To summa
rize my case, it is not so much direct
gender discrimination that is the
problem, but rather the difficulty of
mothering young children during
the tenure evaluation period.
"I had two children during the
last five years," she continued.
"And I've tried to be a good moth
er, spending significant time with
my kids. Given the age at which
most women finish a Ph.l) pro
gram, they cannot wait much
longer to hqve kids if they, want
kids, or their chances of £eHiil£
pregnant and having healthy chiN
dren diminish considerably, Un
fortunately, this 'last chance to
have kids' coincides exactly with
the tenure evaluation period."
Baker argues that it often is hard
to look professional while being a
mother and having to "dash out of

meetings to attend to a sic k kid, or
findfing] that a baby has left spit-up
down your back right before a
funding meeting."
The duties of taking care of young
children, which typically fall more
heavily on mothers, also reduce the
productivity of women hoping to be
come tenured professors.
These women professors argue
that University has not been able to
effectively solve this problem yet,
despite its attempts.
"The feeling is like you're on
your own," Kao said, referring to
the challenges of raising children as
an untenured professor.
Stanford does delay the tenure
clock one year for each child a
mother has in order to ease ad
vancement for women. However,
problems still exist with this incom
plete remedy.
"Many women worry that taking
this delay will make them look
worse, not better," Baker said. "And
you can't take time off for failed
pregnancies, no matter how ad
vanced they were by the time of the
miscarriage. In any case, many
women are too embarrassed or
upset to mention this issue."
Because of this and other reasons,
the Advisory Committee makes no
claims that their work is finished.
"The committee continues to exist
[because] progress remains to be
made," Rhode said. "The good news is
that the administration is committed
to dealing with these issues and has ap
pointed a very active committee."

"I have recendy been denied
tenure," Baker said. "To summa
rize my case, it is not so much direct
gender discrimination that is the
problem, but rather the difficulty of
mothering young children during
the tenure evaluation period.
"I had two children during the
last five years," she continued.
"And I've tried to be a good moth
er, spending significant time with
my kids. Given the age at which
most women finish a Ph.l) pro
gram, they cannot wait much
longer to hqve kids if they, want
kids, or their chances of £eHiil£
pregnant and having healthy chiN
dren diminish considerably, Un
fortunately, this 'last chance to
have kids' coincides exactly with
the tenure evaluation period."
Baker argues that it often is hard
to look professional while being a
mother and having to "dash out of

meetings to attend to a sic k kid, or
findfing] that a baby has left spit-up
down your back right before a
funding meeting."
The duties of taking care of young
children, which typically fall more
heavily on mothers, also reduce the
productivity of women hoping to be
come tenured professors.
These women professors argue
that University has not been able to
effectively solve this problem yet,
despite its attempts.
"The feeling is like you're on
your own," Kao said, referring to
the challenges of raising children as
an untenured professor.
Stanford does delay the tenure
clock one year for each child a
mother has in order to ease ad
vancement for women. However,
problems still exist with this incom
plete remedy.
"Many women worry that taking
this delay will make them look
worse, not better," Baker said. "And
you can't take time off for failed
pregnancies, no matter how ad
vanced they were by the time of the
miscarriage. In any case, many
women are too embarrassed or
upset to mention this issue."
Because of this and other reasons,
the Advisory Committee makes no
claims that their work is finished.
"The committee continues to exist
[because] progress remains to be
made," Rhode said. "The good news is
that the administration is committed
to dealing with these issues and has ap
pointed a very active committee."
One out of eight in the Chemical Engineering De
partment, two out of3l in the Mechanical Engineering
Department, three out of 31 in the Computer Science
Department — these statistics represent the number
of female associate and full professors in these three
University departments. These figures, reflecting a
striking disparity between the number of men and
women who are tenured faculty members, were
among the many issues addressed in an interim report
released last month by the Provost's Advisory Commit
tee on the Status of Women Faculty.
One of the subcommittees focused on issues involv
ing compensation, resources and recognition. Rather
than looking at salary alone, the subcommittee ana
lyzed data on laboratory space, equipment, start-up
funds, research funds and summer salary support.
"Overall, the overwhelming significance of these
data for gender is their insignificance," the report said.
"There seems to be no pattern of disparity that sug
gests any systemic gender inequity."
The subcommittee's data implies immense im
provement over the findings of a report issued 10 years
ago by a committee assigned to investigate the recruit
ment and retention of women faculty.
"Forty-three percent of Stanford departments still
have no tenured women," the 1993 report said. "Dur
ing the last five years, in departments where there were
new faculty hired, almost 40 percent hired no women."
The 1993 report also noted that "only at two tech
nical schools, Cal Tech and MIT, is the percentage of
women faculty lower than ours."
Deborah Rhode, a professor in the Law School and
chair of the current committee, said she believes the
new report demonstrates that the University has made
drastic improvements over the last 10 years.
"I think there's been a great deal of effort by the ad
ministration to try to ensure gender equity in hiring
and promotion and retention, and a variety of strate-
gies have really begun to pay off,"
Rhode said.
This new approach has included
efforts ranging from "broadening
the search process and ensuring
that the candidate pools are diverse
and that the process proceeds fair
ly" to structural changes like day
care services and better accommo
dations for spouses.
"On every front the University
has been making serious efforts,"
she said.
Nonetheless, the report makes a
variety of suggestions on how to
make Stanford a more woman
friendly place. Many of the recom
mendations include ways to in
crease the number of women in de
partments in which they are under
represented — for example, mak
ing departments more adaptable to
special circumstances, monitoring
search processes or "advertising in
specialty journals targeted at
women."
Female faculty members havf
other changes they wquld to r ,
add to that list, spec ideally regard
ing family issues and promotion.
"I don't feel that I have been re
garded with any less respect than
the male colleagues," said Camilla
Kao, an assistant professor of chem
ical engineering.
Chemical engineering is a cam

pus department that lacks any fe
male tenured professors.
"In terms of attention, I feel that
I have gotten the same attention
relative to everyone else," she said.
"But 1 still think things could be
done."
She and others feel that one of
the most significant problems for
female faculty is the conflict be
tween child rearing and the tenure
track.
Mary Baker, an assistant profes
sor of computer science, cited per
sonal experiences to exemplify the
often-unbridgeable gap between
raising a child and attaining tenure.
