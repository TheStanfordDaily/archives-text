# Report finds little faculty inequity
## Univ. examines gender balance 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
One out of eight in the Chemical Engineering De
partment, two out of3l in the Mechanical Engineering
Department, three out of 31 in the Computer Science
Department â€” these statistics represent the number
of female associate and full professors in these three
University departments. These figures, reflecting a
striking disparity between the number of men and
women who are tenured faculty members, were
among the many issues addressed in an interim report

One of the subcommittees focused on issues involv

"Overall, the overwhelming significance of these
data for gender is their insignificance," the report said.
"There seems to be no pattern of disparity that sug
gests any systemic gender inequity."
The subcommittee's data implies immense im

"Forty-three percent of Stanford departments still
have no tenured women," the 1993 report said. "Dur
ing the last five years, in departments where there were
new faculty hired, almost 40 percent hired no women."
The 1993 report also noted that "only at two tech
nical schools, Cal Tech and MIT, is the percentage of
women faculty lower than ours."
Deborah Rhode, a professor in the Law School and
chair of the current committee, said she believes the
new report demonstrates that the University has made
drastic improvements over the last 10 years.
"I think there's been a great deal of effort by the ad
ministration to try to ensure gender equity in hiring
and promotion and retention, and a variety of strate-
