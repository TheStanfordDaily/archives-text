### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice and the Committee to Free
Lori Berenson will be handing out fliers
during Commencement in a peaceful
protest of human rights in Peru and
Berenson's continued imprisonment.
They will also present Peruvian Presi
dent and Commencement speaker Ale
jandro Toledo with a letter urging
Berenson's release signed by over 100
Stanford faculty members.
A freelance journalist and human
rights activist, Berenson was taken off a
bus and imprisoned for life in 1995

under Peru's anti-terrorism legislation
while she was researching the effects of
poverty on Peruvian women. In 2000,
admitting insufficient evidence to
prove the original charge of leading the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Move
ment, the courts instead found her
guilty of collaborating with (he group,
although they had no witnesses or doc
uments to prove her involvement. She
was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Convicted during the presidency of
Alberto Fujimori, Berenson's case has
earned international attention as
groups urge her release on humani
tarian grounds. President George VV.
Bush encouraged Toledo to find a

humanitarian resolution to Beren
son's case when he visited Peru in
Man It 2002.
Senior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wachtel said it is the University's poli
cy that "protests that are respectful of
the ceremony and the speaker are cer
tainly welcome."
" The consul general mentioned they
had heard concerns about [Berenson]
and wondered what our position was,"
Wachtel said. "I told him that a protest
is fine as long as its respectful."
Assoc. Drama Prof. Rush Rehm or
ganized the letter campaign among
Stanford faculty.
"I had known about her case for

some years," he said. "I was contacted
by the committee to free her as well as
her parents."
He emphasized that the letter cam
paign argues for her release on human
itarian grounds and is meant to be a po
lite plea to Toledo — who has two mas
ter's degrees and a doctorate from
Stanford — from his peers.
"Just help her," Rehm said. "You
don't have to revamp your justice sys
tem . . . These are friends of his who
are asking him to do this."
Having worked with Berenson's
parents, Rehm described the situation
