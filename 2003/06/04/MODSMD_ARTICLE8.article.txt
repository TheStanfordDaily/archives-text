# Human rights protest planned against Pres. Toledo
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice and the Committee to Free
Lori Berenson will be handing out fliers
during Commencement in a peaceful
protest of human rights in Peru and
Berenson's continued imprisonment.
They will also present Peruvian Presi
dent and Commencement speaker Ale
jandro Toledo with a letter urging
Berenson's release signed by over 100
Stanford faculty members.
A freelance journalist and human
rights activist, Berenson was taken off a
bus and imprisoned for life in 1995

under Peru's anti-terrorism legislation
while she was researching the effects of
poverty on Peruvian women. In 2000,
admitting insufficient evidence to
prove the original charge of leading the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Move
ment, the courts instead found her
guilty of collaborating with (he group,
although they had no witnesses or doc
uments to prove her involvement. She
was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Convicted during the presidency of
Alberto Fujimori, Berenson's case has
earned international attention as
groups urge her release on humani
tarian grounds. President George VV.
Bush encouraged Toledo to find a

humanitarian resolution to Beren
son's case when he visited Peru in
Man It 2002.
Senior Assistant to the President Jeff
Wachtel said it is the University's poli
cy that "protests that are respectful of
the ceremony and the speaker are cer
tainly welcome."
" The consul general mentioned they
had heard concerns about [Berenson]
and wondered what our position was,"
Wachtel said. "I told him that a protest
is fine as long as its respectful."
Assoc. Drama Prof. Rush Rehm or
ganized the letter campaign among
Stanford faculty.
"I had known about her case for

some years," he said. "I was contacted
by the committee to free her as well as
her parents."
He emphasized that the letter cam
paign argues for her release on human
itarian grounds and is meant to be a po
lite plea to Toledo — who has two mas
ter's degrees and a doctorate from
Stanford — from his peers.
"Just help her," Rehm said. "You
don't have to revamp your justice sys
tem . . . These are friends of his who
are asking him to do this."
Having worked with Berenson's
parents, Rehm described the situation
as "very heartbreaking."
"You can just imagine if it hap
pened to you, what your parents
would do. I know she's not a ter
rorist," he said.
Kristen Gardner, a friend of
Berenson's and her college room
mate at MIT in the late 1980s, has
worked with the National Office
for the Committee to Free Lori
Berenson and is helping to orga
nize the event at Stanford.
She explained that the pur
pose of the event was not to em
barrass but to make Toledo rec
ognize the thousands of inhu
mane and unlawful imprison
ments that resulted from the un
constitutional anti-terrorism laws

established by Fujimori in his at
tempt to put an end to the inter
nal war in Peru.
"We are not there to embarrass
President Toledo — we are there
to bring attention to his responsi
bility to right some of the wrongs
put in place by former-President
Fujimori," she said.
Junior Evan Berger, a member
of the SCPJ, reiterated that the
protest is not in opposition to Tole
do.
" This was done by Fujimori,"
he said. "We want to get people
more aware of what's going on so
this will be a pressing issue for the
president." *
Given the current political and
social unrest in Peru, members of
the Committee to Free Lori Beren
son said they realize that Toledo
will have many issues to deal with
when he returns, but want to re

mind him about Berenson and
other political prisoners.
"We know that Toledo has a lot
of work on his plate, but we feel
that human rights are a priority,"
Gardner said.
In response to growing protests
by government workers and farm
ers, Toledo recently declared a
state of emergency in Peru, autho
rizing the military to clear strikers
from major highways. His popu
larity has decreased sharply since
his inauguration in 2001.
There are fears that Toledo will
be unable to make Stanford's
Commencement on June 15 be
cause he needs to deal with the po
litical unrest in his country.
"There has certainly been con
cern over the strikes in Peru and
people have been concerned that
the president will not make it [to
Commencement]," Wachtel said.
