Out of the Ordinary
(Not out of the way)
Across the street from the Stanford campus, you'll find the
Stanford Terrace Inn, an oasis of unexpected elegance. In the
midst of Silicon Valley, you'll discover a tradition of old
world hospitality. Here, Tuscan murals adorn the walls,
evoking a timeless sense of luxury. Our secluded garden setting
and sun-drenched patio makes it easy to unwind. Or perhaps
you'd care to relieve the stresses of the day in our heated pool?
Inside your over-sized guest room, you'll find all the modern
conveniences. Complimentary high-speed Internet access
and a desk large enough to get some real work done. All at
a price that's pleasantly surprising.
