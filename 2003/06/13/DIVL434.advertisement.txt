tion to publishing numerous papers in scientific journals, Dr. Martinelli has
worked with both the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program and the
Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment. While at Stanford, he
will be teaching two courses.

Alfredo Molano is a journalist and columnist for El Espectador in Bogota. He
is a sociologist and a scholar of the narcotics trade and agrarian reform in his
native Colombia, as well as an active member of the Colombian peace conven

Molano fled to Spain and has continued to live in exile for the past four years.
He is the author of many articles and books about Colombia's history of violence.
Mr. Molano has been at Stanford for the past two years, first as a Knight Fellow
