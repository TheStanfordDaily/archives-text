Bernhard Riemann and the
Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics
"Derbyshire, a National Review columnist, has written
the most mathematically detailed of the trio [of new
books on the Riemann Hypothesis]." —Village Voice
"[This book] will reward the effort paid to [it]."
—Washington Post
"A good introduction —and an infuriating challenge."
—FOCUS
"A remarkable book."
■—John F. Nash, Jr.

PRIME OBSESSION
Bernhard Riemann and the
Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics
John Derbyshire
Alternating passages of extraordinarily lucid mathematical exposition with
chapters of elegantly composed biography and history, Prime Obsession is a
fascinating and fluent account of an epic mathematical mystery that
continues to challenge and excite the world. Posited a century and a half
ago, the Riemann Hypothesis is an intellectual feast for the cognoscenti
and the curious alike. Not just a story of numbers and calculations, Prime
Obsession is the engrossing tale of a relentless hunt for an elusive proof —
and those who have been consumed by it.
"Riemann and his colleagues come to life as real characters and not
just adjectives for conjectures and theorems Parts of Prime
Obsession read almost like a novel, others like a mathematical text.
Its author, Derbyshire, segmented the book so that most of the math
falls into odd chapters and the history and biographical material in
even ones, but the math is as interesting as the rest."
