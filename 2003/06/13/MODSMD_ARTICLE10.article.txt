# GOLF CART CONFESSIONAL
## ANNA CHRISTINA DOUGLAS

I sometimes forget that I work for
The Daily. Rather, I forget that to
some people I am not a product de
sign major or the RA at Kairos but
someone who "takes pictures for the
Daily," and better yet "that girl on the
golf cart." Maybe it's because I have
worked here for so long. Since fall quar
ter freshman year, 1 have seen the photo
department go from all-film to all-digital,
from dotcom boom to dotcom bust, from
painted a dirty eggshell to 18 percent
grey, and seen seven other managing ed
itors come and go. The Daily has
changed and so has Stanford.
In my career thus far, I have had in
credible access to the resources that Stan

ford has to offer. I have been involved with
Residential Education, worked for the
Alumni Association, lived in all kinds of
housing (Faisan, Narnia, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Sharon Green and Kairos), been a
TA and gotten to use the shop. As Prof.
Barry Katz advised us in History and Phi
losophy of Design, Stanford owns most
things, and we ought to take advantage of
that before we leave. Stanford may own
most things, but The Daily owns a golf
cart. And boy, have I ever taken advantage
of that fact.
At first I started out small. Short trips to
the Bookstore, moving boxes to and from
the darkroom and sports assignments.
But soon came trips to Starbucks and late-

night excursions on campus. Once, the
cart died on the way to Suites with five pas
sengers who all pushed while I tried to
steer, helping with one foot, Flintstones
style. When my grandmother came to visit
from India last spring, I decided to take
her to the Stanford Shopping Center â€” in
the cart. We drove straight through the
center of the mall before a security guard
informed me that I had to park the cart in
a real space or they would tow it. My
grandmother said it was the greatest day
of her life.
And one night this fall, as I played 5-
SURE, I got "pulled over." The cop's rea
sons were three-fold: My friends were sit
ting on each other, he thought I was

drunk, and he thought I had stolen the
cart. So after I assured him the cart was
The Daily's and they knew I had it, he
breathalyzed me, "for educational pur
poses." Although I did reek of the beer
that had been spilled on me, I was not ar
restable, and the cop left, dejected.
My golf cart abuse has never interfered
with the actual intended purpose of the
cart, for distribution and the safe trans
portation of thousands of dollars of photo
equipment to and from assignments, how
ever. These were late night heists, bits of
mischief to spice up life. You can have a lot
of fun if you stay at least moderately re
sponsible and that's what Stanford has
taught me to do. Having entered the Uni-

versity before the new Alcohol Policy, I
have learned and grown in this environ
ment of trust, respect and care that I fear
we will soon be losing. I lament that in
coming students will not be given the
chance to learn their limits in a safe envi
ronment as I was. I grew up a lot in these
last four years and had a lot of fun along
the way, but I look forward to moving on
to real cars on real roads (after I coterm, of
course).

Anna Christina Douglas wishes to thank all the
wonderful photo folk who have come and gone
or not gone arul sends all her love to her family,
frietuis and advisers who have made college the
wild ride it has been.
