# APPRECIATING THE FARM
## WILLOW MILLER-YOUNG 
### 
I was apprehensive when I first came
to Stanford. The size, the prestige
and the sheer wealth of the Universi
ty were intimidating to a freshman
from a small town in Washington. My
roommate was an ex-Olympic gymnast
who had visited 18 countries. It was diffi
cult to adjust in the first weeks. But some
where between the late-night hallway talks
and the fascinating freshman seminars, my
apprehension began to change into delight
at the opportunities Stanford has to offer.
I am now a graduating senior, and I am
once more feeling the delight and the ap
prehension of my freshman year. I am de
lighted in how I have changed, all I have

learned, and all I have experienced in four
short years. I have done field research in
Bali and awakened a passion for travel. I
have been a member of the Stanford
American Indian Organization and found
a warm and welcoming community.
I have worked in the Stanford Daily ad
vertising department for four years. I have
gotten to know many different editors in
chief and many different advertising man
agers, business managers and advertising
representatives. It has been a unique ex
perience to watch the paper change and
grow throughout the years. I would like to
thank the 2002-2003 advertising staff for
an amazing final year. To Marketa, Misty,

Scodo, Joe, Joseph, Amanda, Kara, Peigi,
Michelle and Dolores; it was a pleasure
working with you. The Stanford Daily is
the best college newspaper, and Ad Side is
the backbone that supports the whole
paper. I am proud of the job we've done.
I have met and learned from very tal
ented professors. I have taken incredible
classes and completed a senior thesis. I
have discovered a meaningful career path
as a future professor, where I will be able
to research, write and teach about urban
Native American political issues. I have
made lasting friendships. I have met my
long-term boyfriend of three years and
the love of my life. Thank you, Alex, for

our invaluable time together. I am looking
forward to the post-college chapter of our
relationship.
I am filled with delight when I think
about all these experiences during my
time at Stanford. But looming graduation
has created new apprehension; what faces
the Class 0f2003 after college? It is a tough
job market. Many seniors are asking them
selves, "Was Stanford worth it?" They are
wondering what college has given them in
return for four years of tuition and acade
mic commitment.
When I look back on my time here, these
questions are answered. College is only a
moment in life. But it is a crucial moment, a

time for education and maturation, a tran
sition from teen years to true adulthood.
College is an experience. And it is exactly
this experience, and the opportunities pro
vided by Stanford during this vital time,
that is Stanford's gift to us. The future
might be uncertain. But our college experi
ence will guide us, shaping us into the citi
zens we will be for the rest of our lives. The
people we have met, the passions we have
discovered, the things we have learned;
these gifts will always remain, and help us in
our future endeavors.

Willow Miller-Young is graduating with hon
ors in comparative studies in race and ethnicity.
