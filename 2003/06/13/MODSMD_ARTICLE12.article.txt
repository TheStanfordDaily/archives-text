# THANKING THE NOT-SO-LITTLE PEOPLE
## RYAN STEWART 
### 
It's amazing how much tilings have
changed since I began writing my
sports column for The Daily. When
we graduating seniors began our lives
on the Farm, the Chicago Bulls had just
completed the second of their runs of three
straight championships, the Denver Bron
cos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in quite
possibly the second worst Super Bowl ever,
and the Yankees were on the verge of back
to-back sweeps in the World Series, this
time over the Braves.
Four years later, the only Bulls worth
trading for in Chicago are all listed on the
commodities exchange. The post-Elway
Broncos are already on replacement fran
chise quarterback number two, desperate
enough to pin their hopes on the perenni
ally underachieving Arizona castolf Jake
Plummer.
As for the Yankees, the World Series
title has somehow managed to elude their
grasp for the second consecutive season.

The once lowly and still poor Twins and
Angels battled for American League su
premacy, as the Yankees were reduced to
mere spectators (albeit spectators with
much more money, greater talent and
hotter trophy wives than any group of
spectators in history).
But in sports, as is true in all venues,
some things never really change. The Mil
waukee Brewers, Cincinnati Bengals and
Cleveland Cavaliers have managed to
maintain a collective winning percentage
slightly lower than my chances of scoring
with Britney Spears.
By some strange phenomenon that has
yet to be explained by modern science,
NASCAR fans still seem to think that the
mullet is an acceptable style in which to
wear one's hair, especially if accompanied
by a sweat-stained undershirt and a can of
Natty Light in a koozie.
But more importantly than those things
which have changed and those things

which stubbornly refuse to change, diere
are luckily still features in the sporting
world that have only gotten better with
time.
I'd like to extend a hearty congratula
tions to a few of my 112 avorite Stanford senior
athletes whom I've known ever since we
crammed our meager belongings into the
criminally tiny West Lag freshman dorms
together: Luke Powell, Kim Stone, Roger
Levesque, Julius Barnes, Carter Morris,
Curt Toppel, Shaun Haase, David Martin
and Trevor Martin. Thanks, guys, for giv
ing me someone to root for at all of your re
spective events.
And since this is actually my last column
(not like that fake last column that I wrote
last Wednesday), I suppose I should take a
sentimental moment and thank some oth
ers people that have been instrumental in
my college career.
First and foremost, thank you to every
professor that ever gave me a passing

grade. It was hard work fooling ya'll into
thinking I understood anything you said
and ac tually remembered it long enough to
regurgitate it on a test, but somehow 1 did
it. Now I can get started on forgetting
everything 1 just learned. That shouldn't
take nearly as long, and hopefully it won't
tost another $150 K.
I'd also like to thank Sameer Ahmed,
who actually hired me to write this column.
I don't know what you were smoking when
you decided to give me this job, but I'm
thankful for the decision.
In no particular order, thanks to the fol
lowing people simply for being great peo
ple with whom 1 am not ashamed to be as
sociated: Tom Dannenbaum, Megan
Thomas, Monique Saint-Louis, Audrey
Harris, Mike Cutalo, Susan Cameron, Jeb
Ory, Eric Johnson, Ed McCullough, Leshi
ka Samarasinghe, BA Cullum, Michael
Rives, Toby Hyde, Isaiah Cedillo, Tony
Gonzales, Mike Hawkes, Patrick Sullivan,

Dave Lebow. (Note: If your name does not
appear on the above list, it does not neces
sarily mean that you are not great and / or
that I am ashamed to be associated with
you. Please do not register complaints with
me).
And finally, I'd like to say a great big
thank you to my parents, Warren and Ellen
Stewart. Thanks for your constant support,
generosity and guidance, I could not have
made it to where I am today without your
love. And your money. Hut mainly the love.
Good luck to all the seniors who are
moving on to do incredible things. Don't
forget about me when you are all rich and
famous. I have compromising stories about
many of you, some even accompanied with
pictures, and I'm not afraid to use them.

li\an Stewart is a senior who is proud tiuit he can
now speak of his economics major in the past tense.
