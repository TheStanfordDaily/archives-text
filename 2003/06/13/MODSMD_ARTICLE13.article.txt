# COMING FULL CIRCLE
## AMANDA CANEVARO 
### 
When I traversed the Dumbar
ton Bridge with my parents
on the way to Stanford four
years ago, my father insisted
on making one stop during the 20-mile
trip from my house to my new university.
We stopped in front of Stanford Hospital
where I had been born almost 18 years
earlier, and my father remarked how in
credible it was that I had ended up almost
where I had started.
Sure, there was some symmetry in
starting my adult life minutes from my
birthplace, but I could not have predicted
the new beginning that 1 would be given
during my second stint on the Farm.
With our slates wiped clean of SAT
scores and high school grades (except

those all-important AP credits) we all ar
rived at the University on even footing.
We were anonymous to each other except
for our Facebook photos and hometowns.
We made associations and cultivated iden
tities during the first weeks of school that
followed us for four years. I stumbled into
a Daily 10IX session that led to immeasur
ably rewarding positions at The Daily and
to writing this farewell column today. You
probably met a drawmate, best friend or
significant other in those first few impres
sionable moments.
If you were lucky, you maintained your
original associations, affections and inter
ests while constantly making new ones. You
moved fluidly from the person you were
when you arrived with the person you are

on the day of your Commencement.
I have experienced more life in the past
four years than I had in the prior 18. With
in the confines of this University, I have
found several intellectual and personal
passions, met people I hope to know for
the rest of my life and developed a sense of
the person I hope to become.
The most important things I will take
from the University — the übiquitous pas
sion for learning, my obsession with Car
dinal sports and professional and person
al experiences — were all born on this
campus.
Stanford cast quite a spell on me. Even
through the construction, bureaucracy
and other disorganized aspects of the in
stitution, my eyes still light up when I see

hear about an award given to a Stanford
professor or see an alum on Sports Center.
I have been exposed to so many new
ideas while on this campus from the fun 'n'
gun offense to the logistics of a National
Missile Defense system. I have spent long
nights at the Daily offices learning about
the difficulties of producing a quality
newspaper as well as enjoying the benefits
of journalism when 112 was able to cover
Stanford basketball at Madison Square
Garden.
The 21 -year-old me can hardly recog
nize the 17-year-old me that arrived here.
And isn't that how it should be?
When I leave, my time here will be cer
tainly be over mythologized and I will
probably forget the times that weren't so

fun — the difficult classes, saying goodbye
to old friends, the rainy mornings, or the
2002 Big Game loss — but I know I will al
ways look back on Stanford with a smile.
So again, my father is right, from Con
vocation to Commencement, I have
ended up where I began: standing with
my class and celebrating the University.
This time I will leave with a Stanford
diploma instead of an "I'm a Stanford
baby" T-shirt, but maybe I'll finally be old
enough to appreciate what a wonderful
place I've come from.

Amanda Canevaro is graduating with a degree
in political science. She would like to thank her
family for all of its love and support . For Nadi
ra and Eric — there are no words, only love.
