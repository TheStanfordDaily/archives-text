# THE 						LIFE OF CALBEAR@STANFORD.EDU

Lisa: "Now I'll never get into an Ivy
League school!"
Bart: "You're going to Stanford! You're
going to Stanford!"
Such was the attitude of many of my
fellow Berkeleyans six years ago.
While most were leaving for dot
com opportunities, I was going to
grad school. At Stanford. Fora brief time,
I entertained the possibility of instead
going to the University of Illinois at Ur
bana-Champaign. But my best friend had
it right when she said, "You know you're
just going to wind up at Stanford."
After accepting, I asked an acquain
tance on a date, and she cited my going to
Stanford as evidence that we were just too
different. .And I didn't think there was a
good chance of my

dress being replicated at a school where
the sports line was 1-800-BEAT-CAL.
Six years later — with heaven knows
how much spam sent to my e-mail ad
dress calbear@stanford.edu — I think
I've made the right decision, or at least
the right one of those that involved tak
ing a pass at dotcom-dom. Granted, the
weather and restaurants aren't quite as
much to my liking here as those in Berke
ley, but they're certainly better than what
I'd find in Urbana, Illinois. And being on
the edge of Silicon Valley has meant both
great opportunities and the possibility of
seeing my family without hopping on a
plane. And for me at least that's a good
thing.
Still, 1 can see why the Stanford-bashing
persists at the other side of the bay. For

one, there's the fact that Stanford is more
well-known, even though most of its pro
grams rank around the same place as UC-
Berkeley when the U.S. News & World
Report rankings come out. Also — even in
the huge engineering grad school —
we're quite spoiled.
I counted six different free food events
on one particular day. It is also a rare event
for which anyone waits in line for more
than half an hour, excepting those involv
ing free tickets to see someone famous
speak in Memorial Auditorium.
And then there's the myth that Cal stu
dents are just upset because they didn't
get into Stanford. Cal students are no
more upset at or obsessed with Stanford
as Stanford students are upset with Berke
ley students. In fact, many chose Cal over
Stanford for the most obvious reasons: the

type of city Berkeley is, financial consider
ations or campus atmosphere. Others
chose due to the type of school Cal is, or
the various strengths of Berkeley over
Stanford. Similarly, many people have
similar reasons for preferring Stanford.
(However, in choosing Stanford, parental
and peer pressure plays a bit more of a
role. After all, who could say no to the
alma mater of Chelsea Clinton and Fred
Savage?)
However, I must say that I've heard a
lot more Stanford students envy Berkeley
than Cal students envy the Farm. The city,
the proximity to San Francisco, the cam
pus, the activism, the sports teams — actu
ally, no, not that. Stanford has Cal beat —
Big Game or not —in sports; even
though I don't follow the Stanford teams,
I've greatly benefited from the inordinate

dollars poured into the sports facilities
here. So, considering the greatness of
both schools, the viciousness and serious
ness with which some people take the ri
valry seems rather silly.
Still, I'm always asked which was better,
Berkeley or Stanford. But that too is a silly
question — the graduate and undergrad
uate experiences are very different. The
country beauty of Stanford suits the long
term goals and laid-back life of a doctoral
student just as the hustle of the mini-city of
Berkeley suits the frantic energy of an en
gineering undergrad. So that's my official
line. And I'm sticking to it.
