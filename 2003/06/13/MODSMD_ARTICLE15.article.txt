# CHECKING OFF THOSE ' 101 THINGS' TO DO
## HANNAH JAYCOX 
### 
At some point during my first
weeks at Stanford, I was given a
piece of advice that I actually took
to heart. I was told that there were
three components of a happy, healthy,
and successful life on The Farm — sleep
ing, studying and socializing — and to
keep them in mind throughout my college
career.
I was also advised that there was a catch
— isn't there always? — to this seemingly
simple pathway to bliss: Within the con
fines of the 24-hour day, I would find time
to fulfill just two of these requirements.
Sleeping, studying and socializing — one
would have to go — and deciding how to
allocate my time was up to me.
For nearly four years, I prioritized so
cializing and studying and slept only on the
sly (save marathon afternoon naps that
took over my sophomore and senior year
springs). But, two weeks ago — realizing
there was just too much to do before grad
uation — I made the vow not to sleep at all
until Commencement had come and gone.

After a trial period marked by delirium,
though, a reassessment was in order, and I
decided instead to limit my sleep to not
more than three hours at any given stretch.
What exactly did I have to get accom
plished during my newly freed-up hours?
I had quite a list. In fact, feeling a bit nos
talgic, I revisited the Stanford Magazine
compilation of "101 Things You Should
Do Before You Graduate" to assess how I
measured up and to make due changes. I
needed to know if would leave Stanford
"bleeding Cardinal red" or if I would find
that I had in fact "studied or slept too
much."
Checking off such activities as "buy a
Stanford sweatshirt" (#47) or "buy clothes
at the Gap" (#55), I saw that it would be
fairly difficult, to score too low on Stan
ford's (co .tfe-backed?)Top 101. But, I
also realized that if I hope to bleed true
Cardinal red by June 15, I have a few
more tasks to accomplish in my last week
on the Farm.
I have less than a week to "carve my ini

tials onto a table at the Oasis" (#3).
I have less than a week to "get to know
a Nobel Laureate" (#7).
I have less than a week to "read a book
for fun" (#52).
I have less than a week to make sure I
never "rollerblade to class" (#3l).
I have less than a week to. .. worry
about what I should be doing and what I
should have done when instead, I can re
flect fora spell on all that I have done over
the past four years.
For four years, I've "pulled all
nighters" (#11) that left me more rejuve
nated than six solid hours of sleep ever
could have.
For four years, I've been able to "go to
Senior Pub Night" (#3O) and to "get
kissed at Full Moon on the Quad" (#18).
For four years, I've been presented
with opportunities to get off campus and
to grow from those experiences, trekking
throughout Australia (ostensibly " 'study
ing' abroad" (#24)), "hiking in Big
Basin"(#93) on a weekend trip that start-

Ed at the Tresidder Bollards and spit us
out on the beach at Santa Cruz, and back
packing across Zion National Park on a
snow-covered "spring break trip with
friends" (#B6).
For four years, I've even had the good
fortune to "go on a date" (#94) once or
twice.
Overall, I don't think I've done too
badly — stopping to think about it, I see
that I've had innumerable wonderful ex
periences while at Stanford. My hope is
that each of these experiences will have
helped me prepare fora lifetime to ac
complish one last "must-do": "Determine
permanently and irrevocably the precise
meaning of life" (#6O).
Just as I entered Stanford on the tails of
a piece of wise advice, I too will leave with
words that may help me begin to uncover
this "precise meaning of life."
These words, spoken by John Gardner,
the late professor in the Graduate School
of Business, reveal that "meaning is not
something you stumble across [but] some

thing you build into your life ... out of
your past, out of your affections and loyal
ties, out of the experience of humankind
as it is passed on to you, out of your own
talent and understanding, out of the
things you believe in, out of the things and
people you love, out of the values for
which you are willing to sacrifice some
thing." As I venture out into the real
world, I will take John Gardner's sage
words to heart and continue to build
meaning into my life-noting all the while
that nowhere in there does he say a word
about sleep.
