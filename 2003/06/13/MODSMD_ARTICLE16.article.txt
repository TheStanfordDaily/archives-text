# FROM SANTIAGO TO STANFORD
## ANDREA COX 
### 
Sundays have always been the hard
est. The first Sunday 1 spent at Stan
ford 1 called home, and it was tor
ture. As I sal alone, cross-legged on
my new bedspread, 1 listened to my mom
tell me about the food my grandmother
had made for that Sunday lunch. Then my
brother picked up another extension and
tried to tell me about something that had
happened in school as my grandmother
shouted in the background, "Tell her that I
set a place for her on the table by mistake.
Did you tell her?" 1 could hear my uncle
laughing loudly at some dirty joke he had
jnst made and my cousins chastising him
playfully. On that day, I wished I had
never come to Stanford so that I could be
with family, instead of sitting by myself over
6,000 miles away.

Coming to Stanford after growing up in
Santiago, Chile was not an easy transition.
I thought my roommate apologized too
much; it was crazy to me that someone
would excuse themselves for coughing.
And so, 1 didn't talk much at first. I spoke
English without an accent, which was both
a blessing and a curse since people are un
forgiving when you sound just like them
but fail to pronounce some words correct
{y-
Most of fall quarter freshman year, I
thought of going home during Christmas
break, taking the PAA, the Chilean equiva
lent of the SAT, and enrolling in La Catoli
ca like my cousin. Alter a whole week at
Stanford, 1 had decided that I had given it,
and America, enough of a chance, and I
was ready to go home.

Of course I didn't leave. But I wasn't in
love with Stanford. My decision to leave
Chile not only changed my life completely,
but I changed the life of nine other people
that had shared their lives with me every
day.
We no longer talked on a daily basis. I
couldn't talk to my grandfather anymore;
he couldn't hear me on the phone. When I
called my grandmother, she would worry
that I was spending too much money and
cut me short before I could really tell her
about my day or ask her for her recipe for
arroz con leche.
I have had fun at Stanford, done my
share of partying, staying up late and
working hard. My roommate turned out
to be really cool, once she stopped being
polite. She has become an incredibly im

portant person in my life. At Stanford I
have had the hardest experiences and
also the best. I have learned, grown, been
hurt and fallen in love. I used to feel
guilty about having fun while I am away
from my family because I knew they
missed me, but you know, I am sure they
were having fun a lot of the time, too.
1 returned home on breaks and for sum
mers, but it was never the same. I came to
the sad realization â€” that everyday I spend
away from home changes me and makes it
harder and harder to go back home. My
family will always love me, and 1 will always
love them, but I will not be able to return to
that Sunday lunch table that 1 left years ago.

Andrea Cox is graduating in English and would
like to thank her mom.
