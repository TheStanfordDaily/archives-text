LIMA, Peru, May 28 (AP) — Army troops
and police clashed with striking farmers who
had blocked highways in northern Peru and
elsewhere, stranding thousands of travelers
and slowing food deliveries to Lima and other
cities.
Police fired tear gas at protesters in some
towns Wednesday and arrested dozens of
teachers — on strike since May 12 for higher
salaries. In Lima, soldiers evicted hundreds of
teachers camped out in front of Congress.
At dozens of places along the 1,500-mile
Pan American Highway, soldiers cleared
boulders and smoldering tires placed by farm
ers, who went on strike Monday demanding
lower taxes on their crops and protection
from cheap food imports.
Responding to the increasingly violent
protests, President Alejandro Toledo de
clared a state of emergency, giving police and
the military the authority to use force to clear
highways, detain strikers and enter homes
without warrants.
"Tolerance has its limit," Toledo said on
national television Tuesday night.
"We have the responsibility to govern for 26
million Peruvians. We have the responsibility to
protect citizens and the public order," he said.
The emergency measure, which placed
Lima and 11 of Peru's 24 regions under mili
tary control, also limits freedom of movement
and prohibits public assembly.
Teachers are demanding a U.S. $60 in
crease in their U.S. $190 monthly salaries.
The government has offered a U.S. $30 in
crease and ordered them to return to class
rooms within six days or be fired.
Health care and judiciary workers are also
seeking wage increases.
Outside Barranca, 100 miles northwest of
Lima, protesters blocking sections of the high
way hurled rocks at soldiers and police.
In Chiclayo, 410 miles northwest of Lima, po
lice fired tear gas and arrested striking teachers.
In Pativilca, 140 miles northwest of Lima,
demonstrators stoned cars and ransacked buses.
Before dawn Wednesday, dozens of police
in riot gear evicted hundreds of striking teach
ers — many still groggy wit h sleep — camped
in front of Congress.

Soldiers in camouflage uniforms and armed
with assault rifles also took up positions in front of
Congress and at the Dos de Mayo Plaza near the
headquarters of Peru's largest lalx>r federation.
Toledo, who took office in July 2001, rose
to political prominence in the struggle to force
former authoritarian President Alberto Fuji
mori from power in 2000.
But many Peruvians view him as a weak, in
decisive leader, according to public opinion
surveys. His popularity has tumbled in recent
months, with some polls showing his support
as low as 14 percent.
Political opponents and analysts say Tole
do's weak image has encouraged protests by
groups that believe they can force him to accept
demands for higher pay and other benefits.
"He shows very weak leadership, which has
caused problems to get out of control, to the
point that he now wants to compensate for his
weakness with the extreme measure of turn
ing control of internal order over to the mili
tary," said Jorge del Castillo, a leader of the
populist Aprista Party, Peru's strongest oppo
sition party.
But the emergency measures also drew ap
plause from many quarters.
"I think it was absolutely necessary," said
Samuel Gleiser, a prominent business leader.
"It's the best showing by Toledo so far. He
took the bull by the horns."
LIMA, Peru, June 4 (AP) — Defying a state
of emergency, thousands of trade unionists
and striking teachers marched through
downtown Lima, chanting that Peru's presi
dent is "going to fall."
Rather than try to stop the protesters, riot
police escorted the demonstrators Tuesday
on their 18-block march to the Congress to de
mand the lifting of the emergency measures
that allow the use of troops to keep order.
There was no violence and no sign of sol
diers. On Thursday, troops clashed with pro
testers, killing one university student and
wounding dozens.
Many of the 10,000 marchers in Lima on
Tuesday carried red banners with images of
Ernesto "Che" Guevara and chanted: "He's
going to fall, he's going to fall, the liar's going

to fall," referring to Toledo.
The striking teachers are demanding high
er pay, while farmers are seeking protection
from cheap food imports and lower taxes on
t heir own produce.
A delegation of protesters delivered a list of
demands to the Government Palace.
Former Interior Minister Gino Costa, who
served in Toledo's Cabinet until January, said
the government must try to respond to the
needs of the striking protesters.
"The government needs to come clean with
the people about what it can really do faced with
the innumerable expectations," Costa said.
Protesters also marched in other major
cities, including Iquitos, in Peru's Amazon
jungle 1,000 kilometers northeast of Lima. In
Arequipa, Peru's second largest city, 105 kilo
meters southeast of Lima, local leaders called
a general strike to support the protest. There
were no reports of clashes with security forces.
AYACUCHO, Peru, June 11 (AP) — Sol
diers and police were searching for leftist
rebels who seized and later released 71 work
ers from a pipeline construction camp high in
Peru's Andes Mountains.
Soldiers found the hostages on Tuesday in
the jungle near the village of Palma Pampa,
some 250 miles southeast of Lima, after the
rebels released them, according to an army of
ficer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
President Alejandro Toledo later said that
troops and police were moving to encircle the
guerrillas.
"We have rescued them alive, safe and
sound . . . without making any payment,"
Toledo told a news conference Tuesday. It
was not clear how the hostages became free.
The president blamed remnants of the
Shining Path" for the kidnapping and said his
administration would not negotiate with the
fleeing guerrillas.
The Shining Path guerrillas nearly drove
Peru's government to its knees in the early
1990s with a campaign of car bombings, polit
ical assassinations and massacres of peasant
communities that refused to support them.
About 30,000 people died in rebel violence
between 1980 and the early 19905.
