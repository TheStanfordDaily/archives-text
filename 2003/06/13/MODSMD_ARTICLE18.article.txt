# ITSS halts outbound service for 8.5 hours on June 5
## Virus disrupts e-mail 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford's outbound e-mail ser
vice was shut down from noon to
8:30 p.m. on June 5 to prevent the
spread of the Bugbear.B virus,
which was rapidly being dissemi
nated through campus via e-mail.
The Bugbear. B virus func
tioned by copying itself onto old e
mail messages on infected comput
ers and then forwarding those e
mails to other users in that comput
er's address book. Because of the
virus, most students or faculty re
ceived at least several e-mails from a
Stanford address they were familiar
with, though often the e-mail
would not be directed to or even
pertain to them.
"I know who [the sender] is, but
it was a random person," said
sophomore Nicole Bonsol, who re
ceived a virus-infected e-mail on
Thursday. "It was about setting up
for [the band] North of Cuba."
Information Technology Sys
tems and Services administrators
said that the virus was especially
dangerous because it could send
out sensitive information and
files, such as information on facul
ty salaries and bonuses, and this
led to the decision to temporally
disable outbound e-mail service.
"We didn't want to run the risk

of sending confidential information
outside our network," said Sandra
Send, executive director for tech
nology strategy and support, to the
Stanford News Service.
Users with Macintosh comput
ers or Linux or UNIX systems were
not in danger of getting infected by
the virus or spreading it to others
because the virus was Windows
based.
On June 6, an e-mail was for
warded to Stanford network
users — primarily through Resi
dent Computer Coordinators in
residences — to tell Windows users
what steps they needed to take to
safeguard their computers. The e
mail instructed users to not open at
tachments from e-mails unless they
are sure they are legitimate and to
run security updates. Infected ma
chines would then be blocked from
using the Stanford network.
The virus functioned by infil
trating computers with unpatched
versions of Internet Explorer or
Oudook. It was also able to infect
patched versions or computers
without those programs if users
opened infected attachments sent
over e-mail. Once on computers,
the virus was able to give remote
users access to the infected ma
chines and recorded keystrokes,
which could reveal passwords or
other confidential information.
