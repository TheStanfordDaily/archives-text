## Streaking Cardinal earns fifth straight trip to Omaha 
### DANIEL URBAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
They say that good pitching beats good
hitting. Fortunately for Stanford it has
both, and when the team met the nation's
top starting duo of Abe Alvarez and Jered
Weaver of Long Beach State, the Cardinal
came out on top to earn its fifth straight
trip to Omaha.
The Cardinal avoided a Sunday game
with a suspenseful two-game sweep of the
Dirtbags in the Super Regional at Sunken
Diamond last weekend (5-1, 4-2) and
heads to the College World Series riding a
12-game winning streak and having won
18 of 19 overall.
The Cardinal pitted its own ace, junior
John Hudgins, against Alvarez in Friday
night's contest. Alvarez and Hudgins were
second and third rounders, respectively,
m the 2003 MLB Draft.
The pair did not disappoint.
With two strikeouts and no hits or walks
in the top of the first inning, Hudgins
made it clear he had his best stuff working
that night, and Alvarez answered.
For every one of the first five innings
that Hudgins put up a zero on the score
board, Alvarez did likewise.
'Fhe Cardinal offense, which had pro
duced 19 runs in one game less than a
week before, seemed completely stymied
by the Long Beach lefty.
"Hands down he is the best pitcher
we've faced all year," said senior Ryan
Garko of Alvarez. "He made us look bad at
times."
Even when the Cardinal had runners

on the corners with one out in the fifth, Al
varez pitched himself out of the jam and
the game remained scoreless.
"I didn't know if we were ever going to
score," confessed Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
The Dirtbags were the first to light up
the scoreboard on freshman shortstop
TroyTulowitzki's RBI double in the top of
the sixth.
Scoring just one run was a momentum
boost for the Dirtbags in such a tight pitch
ers' duel, but Hudgins remained confi
dent and optimistic.
"I still thought that we would get to Al
varez eventually because our hitters have
been so strong lately," Hudgins said.
I le didn't have to wait long.
In the bottom half of the inning, Stan
ford backed up its pitcher with two runs of
their own.
An RBI single from senior Ryan Garko
brought in junior Brian Hall and moved
junior Carlos Quentin to second. Sopho
more Donny Lucy then hit a hard
grounder up the middle that Tulowitzki
misfielded. A potential inning-ending
double play turned into the Cardinal's go
ahead run as Quentin crossed the plate.
Alvarez came out of the game in the
eighth and his successor, Neil Jamison, did
not have nearly as much success against
the Cardinal bats. Quentin singled, Garko
was hit by a pitch, and sophomore Danny
Putnam blasted a three-run homer on a
full count, the final nail in the Dirtbags'
coffin.
Hudgins closed out the game, reminis
cent of his complete-game victory against

Long Beach in last year's regional. His
final line read one run, seven hits, six
strikeouts and two walks.
The Cardinal offense's job did not get
any easier on Saturday. Long Beach
starter Jered Weaver — the brother of
New York Yankee Jeff Weaver — had put
up remarkable numbers on the season
and was every bit as dominant against the
Cardinal as Alvarez had been.
Stanford freshman Mark Romancz.uk
had not lost a game all year, however, and
was not about to start in the Super Re
gional.
He gave up one run in both the second
and third innings to put Stanford in a 2-0
hole, but otherwise blanked the Long
Beach offense.
Stanford scrapped one run off of
Weaver in the fifth with an RBI single
from Quentin. The Cardinal got to
Weaver again in the seventh. Junior Sam
Fuld reached first base on an error by Tu
lowitzki, his second costly mistake of the
series. Fuld stole second and a single from
junior Jonny Ash brought him home.
Carlos Muniz replaced Weaver, and in
a bit of deja vu, Putnam hammered the
Long Beach reliever to break the game
open. This time Putnam's hit was more
critical, as his two-RBI single put the Car
dinal up by two.
"Every guy comes through at some
point during the year, and I had the op
portunities in this series," Putnam said. "I
feel very grateful that I was able to come
through in these big spots."
Romanczuk kept the Dirtbags from re
sponding with a rally oft heir own, holding

them scoreless in the seventh and eighth
innings.
" Those last couple innings are so cru
cial, and that is the kind of situation that
makes me want to pitch, that makes me
want to have the ball in my hand," Ro
manczuk said. "It reminds you of why you
love baseball so much."
Romanczuk earned the biggest win of
his young but very successful career, and
freshman Matt Manship earned the save

by tossing a scoreless ninth inning.
Marquess was thrilled with his team's
performance, and the scrappy victories
the Cardinal earned over Long Beach's
pitching staff should pay big dividends in
Omaha.
"We have had some super college base
ball in the Super Regional here, and this
was another great example of that," said
Marquess. "This is college baseball at its
best."
