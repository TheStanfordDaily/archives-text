# Baseball has dynastic potential
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN STAFF COLUMN 
In sports, the word "dynasty" is
not thrown around lightly. We re
serve its use for only the most im
pressive and sustained runs of
team succ ess, and in a sporting era
of increasing parity across the
board, the dynasty is a dying
breed.

Few teams have achieved
enough in the last 20 years to war
rant the modern "dynasty" tag.
Only three professional franchises
— the Chicago Bulls, the Dallas
Cowboys and the New York Yan
kees — remained at the pinnacle
of their sport long enough during
my lifetime to earn such a distinc
tion. All three won multiple titles
and remain indelibly stamped on
the images of the leagues they so
thoroughly dominated; for exam
ple, the NBA of the 1990s was the
Bulls' NBA (or more appropriate
ly, Michael Jordan's NBA), and no
one remembers it otherwise.
In t he collegiate ranks, just a few
teams in major sports have
achieved this type of success since
the 1980s. Duke basketball, with
nine Final Four appearances since
198(5 and three national titles, cer
tainly qualifies. So does Louisiana
State baseball, which has now made
12 College World Series appear
ances since 1980 and dominated
the decade of the 19905, winning
five titles from 1991 to 2000.
The last of those LSU national
championships came via a come
back victory over t he Stanford (Car
dinal, and it begs the question: had
the Cardinal held onto its three
run, eighth-inning lead in the
2000 CAVS championship game,
would we be talking about the
newest dynasty in the making right
here on campus?
Under head coach Mark Mar
quess, Stanford baseball has be
come a fixture in Omaha every
[line. After taking charge ol the
program in 1977, Marquess put
the Cardinal in the CWS just live
seasons later — and kept it there.
Stanford made live trips to ()maha
from 1982 to 1988, w inning back
to-back national titles in 1987 and
1988. In the nine seasons since
1995, the Cardinal has made it
back to the CWS seven times (in
cluding this year), finishing run
ner-up twice but never reclaiming
the NCAA title.
And therein lies the most diffi
cult roadblock to calling the Stan
ford baseball teams of the late
1990s and early 2000s a dynasty.
Most would say that a school
record fifth straight CWS berth in
2003 is the mark of a truly great
program, but the Cardinal's fail

ure to win titles bars it from the
elite company of the Dukes and
LSUs of modern college sports.
l he blown 2000 CWS champi
onship game, in which Stanford
was five outs from the title with a
three-run lead, was beyond a
doubt the most devastating sports
moment of my lifetime as a fan.
But that loss also may have pre
vented the coronation of a Cardi
nal dynasty that, no matter what it
achieves in coming years, will
never shake the perception that it
could have been something much
greater had it finished the job four
years ago.
A victory over LSU in 2000, in
addition to one or two more titles
before the end oft he decade, would
have placed the Cardinal in the
same sentence with the Tigers and
the Blue Devils, the mammoths of
modern collegiate athletics.
With no end in sight to Mar
quess' success — as top recruit
ing class after class flows onto
Sunken Diamond like a veritable
baseball factory — maybe discus
sion of a missed opportunity for
greatness is a bit premature.
After all, this run of CWS ap
pearances may not end for quite

some time, and as any observer
of college baseball can attest, sim
ply making it to Omaha is a re
markable achievement that re
quires unique combinations of
both talent and luck.
And to a team in 2003 that is
perhaps the Stanford squad most
equipped to take home the hard
ware from Omaha since that ill
fated 2000 group, the Cardinal's
Omaha frustrations the last four
seasons only add fuel to the fire to
win it all this time around.
If the 2003 Cardinal can hoist
the NCAA trophy next weekend,
10 years from now it will not be
seen as the latest in a line of Stan
ford teams unable to secure their
program's place in history. It may
instead be known as the first in
what could become one of the
most sustained and successful dy
nasties in modern team sports.
At least, that's what I'm hoping
for .. . that would be nice.
