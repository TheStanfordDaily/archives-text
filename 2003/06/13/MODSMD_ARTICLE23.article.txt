# A 						look back in the Class of 2oo3's Stanford sports' experience
## Stanford smells the Roses 
### TIM KANE THE STANFORD DAILY 
This story originally ran on Nov. 15,
1999.
An indelible image of the Stan
ford football team filled the sideline
under the cloudy Saturday after
noon sky — that of stars and re
serves, seniors and freshmen, play
ers and coaches alike, all raising the
same object towards the heavens.
A rose.
In the 102 nd Big Game, the Car
dinal defeated California 31-13 in
front of 80,746 rain-soaked fanatics
at Stanford Stadium, and managed
to accomplish what had eluded
their predecessors for 28 years - an
outright Pacific-10 Conference
championship and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
"It's a great feeling, for our se
niors, for our coaches, for every
body involved with our program, to
have this moment, to have this op
portunity, to be the undisputed
Pac-10 Champion and Rose Bowl
representative. It feels great," said
an unusually exuberant head coach
Tyrone Willingham following the
victory, sporting a grin from ear to
ear for the first time in recent mem
ory.
The turning point in the game
occurred at the beginning of the

4th quarter with the Cardinal up
21-13. From his own six-yard line,
Stanford sophomore fullback
Casey Moore sped through a gap
ing hole in the Cal defensive line
and rumbled 94 yards into the end
zone to give the Card some breath
ing room and put the game out of
reach at 28-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of
surprises in this Big Game, as it was
common knowledge that Cal had
no offense, Stanford had a lot of of
fense, and Deltha O'Neal is a pretty
damn good football player. Sure
enough, all of these things were
confirmed Saturday —and also,
Stanford's maligned defense
turned in an impressive perfor
mance that may keep the critics off
their back fora while, albeit against
a very weak opponent.
"Words don't describe how
proud I am of this group. All they
read all week long is how good Cal's
defense is, and they are. They de
serve it. But sooner or later that
wears on you, and I saw earlier in
the week that our kids took this to
heart," said Stanford defensive co
ordinator Kent Baer.
Calling Cal's offense weak might
be an understatement. Led by
third-string quarterback and lirst
time starter Wes Dalton, Cal gener
ated a mere 70 yards of offense and
three first clowns through the first

three quarters, ending the game
with 130 yards on offense and zero
points produced. Cal was saved
from a goose egg on the scoreboard
by their one-man wrecking crew,
senior cornerback Deltha O'Neal.
O'Neal returned a kickofF 100
yards and a punt 58 yards, both for
touchdowns, despite Willingham's
efforts to the contrary.
"The plan with Deltha was for
him not to touch the football, what
ever it took for him not to touch the
football. We were good fora couple
occasions, and a couple occasions
we were not that good," Willing
ham said in what might be termed
as a massive understatement.
Stanford also managed a subpar
performance offensively— in com
parison to its typical output. The
Cardinal piled up 410 yards, no
small amount but below its season
average 0f472. Todd Husak threw
for 216 yards on 1 l-of-26 passing
along with one touchdown, while
Moore contributed 116 yards on six
carries and senior flanker Troy
Walters hauled in six catches for
126 yards.
With its first possession, the
Stanford offensive machine showed
why it was ranked 4th in the nation
— a Troy Walters reception fol
lowed bv three Brian Allen runs

The Cardinal clinched its first Rose Bowl berth in almost 30 years with its win in the 1 999 Big Game. Stanford ulti
mately lost to Wisconsin in Pasadena.
staked the Cardinal to a 7-0 lead in
less than two minutes. On the en
suing kickoff, however, O'Neal
managed to make the Stanford
kickoff unit look helpless, running
up the middle, cutting to the out
side and blazing down the sideline
to tie the score at 7-7.
By the time the 4th quarter
rolled around, the handwriting
was on the wall for Cal. The Bears
were plagued by penalties all after
noon, and still found themselves
unable to consistently move the ball
on offense. Stanford bled time off
the clock with each possession,
until the outcome of the game be
cause clear with about five minutes
left; when the Cardinal faithful
took up the "Rose Bowl, Rose
Bowl" chant, it was clear the game
was over. The players began hold
ing up the roses with about two
minutes left, and after the final
whistle sounded it was time for the
celebration to begin.
"It's something I appreciate
now and I cherish right now, but I
think it's something for in 20 years,
when we look back and say 'We did
it. That was our ultimate goal and
we reached it.' They're going to
talk about us like we talk about the
'71 team, that they were a great
team and they came together when
they needed to." said Husak.
Hopefully the next trip to the
Rose Bowl for the Cardinal won't l>e
28 years from now, but this team will
be remembered nonetheless - the
squad was picked to finish eighth or
ninth in the Pac-10 in most presea
son polls, and overcame a potential
ly devastating loss at Texas in the
first game of the season to reach the
pinnacle of the Pac-10.
Notre Dame awaits the Cardinal
next week, in a game that will mean
utterly nothing —Stanford has
clinched the Rose Bowl berth, and
the Fighting Irish became ineligi
ble fora bowl with a loss to Boston
College.

Rose Bowl.
"It's a great feeling, for our se
niors, for our coaches, for every
body involved with our program, to
have this moment, to have this op
portunity, to be the undisputed
Pac-10 Champion and Rose Bowl
representative. It feels great," said
an unusually exuberant head coach
Tyrone Willingham following the
victory, sporting a grin from ear to
ear for the first time in recent mem
ory.
The turning point in the game
occurred at the beginning of the

4th quarter with the Cardinal up
21-13. From his own six-yard line,
Stanford sophomore fullback
Casey Moore sped through a gap
ing hole in the Cal defensive line
and rumbled 94 yards into the end
zone to give the Card some breath
ing room and put the game out of
reach at 28-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of
surprises in this Big Game, as it was
common knowledge that Cal had
no offense, Stanford had a lot of of
fense, and Deltha O'Neal is a pretty
damn good football player. Sure
enough, all of these things were
confirmed Saturday —and also,
Stanford's maligned defense
turned in an impressive perfor
mance that may keep the critics off
their back fora while, albeit against
a very weak opponent.
"Words don't describe how
proud I am of this group. All they
read all week long is how good Cal's
defense is, and they are. They de
serve it. But sooner or later that
wears on you, and I saw earlier in
the week that our kids took this to
heart," said Stanford defensive co
ordinator Kent Baer.
Calling Cal's offense weak might
be an understatement. Led by
third-string quarterback and lirst
time starter Wes Dalton, Cal gener
ated a mere 70 yards of offense and
three first clowns through the first

three quarters, ending the game
with 130 yards on offense and zero
points produced. Cal was saved
from a goose egg on the scoreboard
by their one-man wrecking crew,
senior cornerback Deltha O'Neal.
O'Neal returned a kickofF 100
yards and a punt 58 yards, both for
touchdowns, despite Willingham's
efforts to the contrary.
"The plan with Deltha was for
him not to touch the football, what
ever it took for him not to touch the
football. We were good fora couple
occasions, and a couple occasions
we were not that good," Willing
ham said in what might be termed
as a massive understatement.
Stanford also managed a subpar
performance offensively— in com
parison to its typical output. The
Cardinal piled up 410 yards, no
small amount but below its season
average 0f472. Todd Husak threw
for 216 yards on 1 l-of-26 passing
along with one touchdown, while
Moore contributed 116 yards on six
carries and senior flanker Troy
Walters hauled in six catches for
126 yards.
With its first possession, the
Stanford offensive machine showed
why it was ranked 4th in the nation
— a Troy Walters reception fol
lowed bv three Brian Allen runs

staked the Cardinal to a 7-0 lead in
less than two minutes. On the en
suing kickoff, however, O'Neal
managed to make the Stanford
kickoff unit look helpless, running
up the middle, cutting to the out
side and blazing down the sideline
to tie the score at 7-7.
By the time the 4th quarter
rolled around, the handwriting
was on the wall for Cal. The Bears
were plagued by penalties all after
noon, and still found themselves
unable to consistently move the ball
on offense. Stanford bled time off
the clock with each possession,
until the outcome of the game be
cause clear with about five minutes
left; when the Cardinal faithful
took up the "Rose Bowl, Rose
Bowl" chant, it was clear the game
was over. The players began hold
ing up the roses with about two
minutes left, and after the final
whistle sounded it was time for the
celebration to begin.
"It's something I appreciate
now and I cherish right now, but I
think it's something for in 20 years,
when we look back and say 'We did
it. That was our ultimate goal and
we reached it.' They're going to
talk about us like we talk about the
'71 team, that they were a great
team and they came together when
they needed to." said Husak.
Hopefully the next trip to the
Rose Bowl for the Cardinal won't l>e
28 years from now, but this team will
be remembered nonetheless - the
squad was picked to finish eighth or
ninth in the Pac-10 in most presea
son polls, and overcame a potential
ly devastating loss at Texas in the
first game of the season to reach the
pinnacle of the Pac-10.
Notre Dame awaits the Cardinal
next week, in a game that will mean
utterly nothing —Stanford has
clinched the Rose Bowl berth, and
the Fighting Irish became ineligi
ble fora bowl with a loss to Boston
College.

An indelible image of the Stan
ford football team filled the sideline
under the cloudy Saturday after
noon sky — that of stars and re
serves, seniors and freshmen, play
ers and coaches alike, all raising the
same object towards the heavens.
A rose.
In the 102 nd Big Game, the Car
dinal defeated California 31-13 in
front of 80,746 rain-soaked fanatics
at Stanford Stadium, and managed
to accomplish what had eluded
their predecessors for 28 years - an
outright Pacific-10 Conference
championship and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
