An indelible image of the Stan
ford football team filled the sideline
under the cloudy Saturday after
noon sky — that of stars and re
serves, seniors and freshmen, play
ers and coaches alike, all raising the
same object towards the heavens.
A rose.
In the 102 nd Big Game, the Car
dinal defeated California 31-13 in
front of 80,746 rain-soaked fanatics
at Stanford Stadium, and managed
to accomplish what had eluded
their predecessors for 28 years - an
outright Pacific-10 Conference
championship and a berth in the
Rose Bowl.
"It's a great feeling, for our se
niors, for our coaches, for every
body involved with our program, to
have this moment, to have this op
portunity, to be the undisputed
Pac-10 Champion and Rose Bowl
representative. It feels great," said
an unusually exuberant head coach
Tyrone Willingham following the
victory, sporting a grin from ear to
ear for the first time in recent mem
ory.
The turning point in the game
occurred at the beginning of the

4th quarter with the Cardinal up
21-13. From his own six-yard line,
Stanford sophomore fullback
Casey Moore sped through a gap
ing hole in the Cal defensive line
and rumbled 94 yards into the end
zone to give the Card some breath
ing room and put the game out of
reach at 28-13.
There weren't exactly a lot of
surprises in this Big Game, as it was
common knowledge that Cal had
no offense, Stanford had a lot of of
fense, and Deltha O'Neal is a pretty
damn good football player. Sure
enough, all of these things were
confirmed Saturday —and also,
Stanford's maligned defense
turned in an impressive perfor
mance that may keep the critics off
their back fora while, albeit against
a very weak opponent.
"Words don't describe how
proud I am of this group. All they
read all week long is how good Cal's
defense is, and they are. They de
serve it. But sooner or later that
wears on you, and I saw earlier in
the week that our kids took this to
heart," said Stanford defensive co
ordinator Kent Baer.
Calling Cal's offense weak might
be an understatement. Led by
third-string quarterback and lirst
time starter Wes Dalton, Cal gener
ated a mere 70 yards of offense and
three first clowns through the first

three quarters, ending the game
with 130 yards on offense and zero
points produced. Cal was saved
from a goose egg on the scoreboard
by their one-man wrecking crew,
senior cornerback Deltha O'Neal.
O'Neal returned a kickofF 100
yards and a punt 58 yards, both for
touchdowns, despite Willingham's
efforts to the contrary.
"The plan with Deltha was for
him not to touch the football, what
ever it took for him not to touch the
football. We were good fora couple
occasions, and a couple occasions
we were not that good," Willing
ham said in what might be termed
as a massive understatement.
Stanford also managed a subpar
performance offensively— in com
parison to its typical output. The
Cardinal piled up 410 yards, no
small amount but below its season
average 0f472. Todd Husak threw
for 216 yards on 1 l-of-26 passing
along with one touchdown, while
Moore contributed 116 yards on six
carries and senior flanker Troy
Walters hauled in six catches for
126 yards.
With its first possession, the
Stanford offensive machine showed
why it was ranked 4th in the nation
— a Troy Walters reception fol
lowed bv three Brian Allen runs
