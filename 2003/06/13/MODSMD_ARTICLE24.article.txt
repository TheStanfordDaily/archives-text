# Tom leaves legacy of success

Uigan Tom is a woman of mystery.
No one was sure if Tom would play for the
Stanford women's volleyball team this year. In
fact, most people assumed she would not play for
Stanford during her sophomore year, havingjust
finished playing with the U.S. national team at the
Summer Olympics in Sydney.
Even Tom herself had yet to decide if she
would play this season as she sat on the team's
bench in Maples Pavilion two weeks ago watching
her teammates take on Washington.
She had arrived on campus only hours earlier,
returning to the Farm for the first time since she
left during winter quarter last year to start training
with the National Team.
So everyone was naturally surprised to see
Tom in uniform, with her trademark No. 15 on
her back, on the court against California only four
days later. Of course, no one was surprised that
she posted a match-high 17 kills in her first game
back for Stanford while leading the Cardinal to a
3-0 victory.
"There were a bunch of different options,"
Tom said of returning after the Olympics. "Not
coming back and taking the fall off was one of
them. Coming back and red shirting and coming
back and playing were the other ones.
"I think 1 could maybe use some time off, but 1
get bored really easily, so after a week or two 1
would be like, 'Give me something to do.' I was
going to be here anyway, and I'm not one to sit
around and watch."
Her propensity for boredom is great news to
the other members of the Stanford squad, who are
more than happy that Tom is back out on the
court with them.
' Logan brings this team a go-to hitter," said the
team's captain, senior Lindsay Kagawa. "She's
someone we're not necessarily going to rely on, but
she brings us stability at the outside position and
gives this team a confidence boost on the court."
Tom's return to Stanford ended an eight
month journey for the outside hitter from Salt
Lake City, during which she established herself as
one of the premiere female volleyball players in
the country. She had already established herself at
the collegiate level after her breakout season for
the Cardinal last year.
During her freshman campaign, she became
only the fourth freshman in NCAA history to be
named a first-team Ail-American and was voted
Volleyball Magazine's Freshman of the Year.

"I think she's the number one college player in
the country," said interim head coach Denise Cor
lett. "She's got the hitting ability, the range, and
she's one of the better blocking outside hitters in
the game. She'll definitely go down as one of the
best players in NCAA history."
Perhaps even as one of the best players ever.
Tom's performance in Sydney has led many to
compare her to Karch Kiraly, widely accepted as
the best men's volleyball player in US history . De
spite an auspicious start to her collegiate and in
ternational careers, Tom is quick to shun those
kinds of comments.
"I tend to ignore those things," Tom said. "1
play volleyball. It's something I'm not really think
ing about. I'm basically taking things one step at a
time."
Tom was no stranger to international play be
fore this summer. She toured overseas with thej u
nior National Team several times during high
school, starting her freshman year, which is espe
cially remarkable considering that she did not
start playing volleyball until the eighth grade.
"It was basically a way to pass the time in eighth
grade," she said.
This past spring, a mere six years after picking
up the sport, Tom found herself embarking on a
pre-Olympic tour with the American squad that
took her to all corners of the globe, including Rus
sia, the Netherlands, Switzerland and China. Soon
after, she found herself at the Summer Olympics
is Sydney, where the magnitude of the experience
really began to sink in.
"Walking around the Olympic village is weird,
'cause you're like, 'Wow, there's an Olympian,' but
then you realize, 'Wait, I'm an Olympian too,'"
Tom said.
"It hit me while 1 was there with the opening
ceremonies and the first match. But its really hit
me afterwards."
Tom's breakthrough performance in Sydney
highlighted the American team's remarkable run
fora medal, which eventually fell just short. With
upset wins over China in pool play and a huge win
over the favored Koreans in the quarterfinals, the
U.S. squad went further than anyone expected.
Many observers look ahead at the impact Tom
could have on the game of volleyball in general.
Corlett, who played on the U.S. National Team in
1982 and 1983 and remains involved with USA
Volleyball, sees Tom as the centerpiece of the
sport in America in the years to come.
"I think she's volleyball's future," Corlett said.
"In order for the sport to get publicity, she has to
be the one they use to get it out into the public eye.
I think she can do for volleyball what Mia Hamm
has done for soccer in America."\
