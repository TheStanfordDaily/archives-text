For the first time during their
Stanford career, they weren't all to
gether.
.After the 2000 men's soccer sea
son, seniors Johanes Maliza and
.Andrew Terris decided to explore
their interests elsewhere, as the two
traveled to Paris and Florence, re
spectively, fora quarter.
But an ocean could not keep
teammates and classmates Taylor
Graham, Roger Levesque, Todd
Dunivant and .Abe Geiger from tak
ing a spring break trip to Europe to
see their two friends abroad.
On and oft the field, they have
been inseparable.
"I think the fact that we all took
the time to visit Johanes and An
drew in Europe, and just the group
of us terrorizing Europe last spring
epitomizes our closeness as a class,"
Graham said.
Levesque agreed: "It can be
summed up best as everybody on
campus knowing us as the 'soccer
guys.' They can't really differentiate
one of us from another. It just
shows the closeness of our group."
Fhe unique bond that brought
the six seniors together has mani
fested itself this season as they have
embraced their leadership roles,
putting the No. 22 Cardinal (12-4-
2, 3-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) in
good position fora run at the
NCAA championship.
With its last two conference
games coming up tonight at Ore
gon State (12-6-0, 3-5-0) and Sun
day at Washington (5-9-3, 2-6-0),
Stanford will be counting on the six
seniors to help the team finish on a
strong note, heading into the post
season.
Head coach Bret Simon appreci
ates how the seniors have led the
team all year.

"It's a tremendous group,"
Simon said. "It's one of the best
groups of seniors I've ever worked
with in the 23 years I've coached,
both on and off the field. I suspect
that when it comes down to do-or
die time, you'll see how good they
really are."
Geiger, a redshirt junior who
will most likely return fora fifth
year, appreciates how much he has
learned from the soon-to-be-grad
uated class.
"I really look up to all these
guys," Geiger said. "I definitely
learned a lot from them. This
whole unit exemplifies what
Stanford soccer should be all
about in terms of commitment
and putting in 110 percent effort
on the field."
Their contributions to the soccer
program have been countless. Dur
ing its tenure, the group has helped
the Cardinal to a 61-13-7 record,
three NCAA appearances — in
cluding one semifinal berth — and
one Pac-10 championship.
Despite all of their achievements
on the field, their friendships with
each other have been the most trea
sured part of their Stanford experi
ence.
"The soccer and the academics
have been amazing here, but more
than anything, we've become really
close," Geiger said. "They are my
best friends on the soccer team, and
I wouldn't trade that for anything."
Graham, who is a fifth-year se
nior, has come to identify more
with this group of guys than last
year's seniors.
"I was certainly close with my
class, but in terms of living in
dorms, I seem to have the most in
common with these guys," Graham
said. "All my friends from my fresh
man dorm have said these guys
have corrupted me, and that I've
changed. They said that I've be
come more scandalous."
Dunivant also cherishes the ca

maraderie.
"We've come a long way, al
though I don't know if we've ma
tured," Dunivant joked. "I think
all of us have grown together and
learned a lot from each other.
We've picked up new habits from
each other and a lot of inside
jokes. It's been a great four years
for all of us."
The development of this close
ness has allowed them to achieve
success on the field as well.
"One good thing about our
friendship is that we're not afraid to
say stuff to each other on the field,"
Mali/a said. "If we see somebody
doing something off the Held that

might affect them on the field, we
will be honest with them."
1 'his ability to gel on the field will
be especially important this week
end and in upcoming weeks.
"We're really excited about this
weekend," Levesque said. "Every
body is worried about our goal scor
ing, but the rest of the squad knows
that the goals will come."
Having experienced the agony
of finishing one game short of the
championship, there is no doubt
what the seniors want before leav
ing Stanford.
Coach Simon said it best: "I
don't think they have made their
final statement vet."
