For the last four years one
thing has remained strong and
consistent for the No. 15 Stan
ford softball team — senior left
fielder Cassi Brangham.
Brangham is the only mem
ber of the Cardinal squad that
has started in the same spot from
the first contest of her freshman
year to the doubleheader she will
star in tonight at the eve of her
senior campaign.
The four-year starter did not
always find herself in left field. In
fact, Brangham, who hails from
Clovis, Calif., never played in the
outfield before arriving on the
Farm.
The natural left-hander was a
first baseman for both Clovis
High School and one of the best
travel teams in the nation, the
Fresno Force. Brangham arrived
on the Farm having been named
a first-team All-American NFCA
first baseman and a two-time
West Regional Ail-American.
Consistency has always been
the lefty's trademark, as she
reached base in 38 of 39 games as
a high school senior and batted
.406 for her team.
Beyond excellence in the
field, Brangham's batting aver
age was matched with a grade
point average of 3.95 in the class
room.
Since high school, not much
has changed.
The American Studies major
was named an NFCA All-Ameri
can Scholar-Athlete and Second
Team Academic All-Pac-1() se
lection in her junior season at
Stanford.
But, honors and statistics can
not express the magnitude of
Brangham's contributions to
Stanford softball.

As a freshman, she started
next to National Team member
and four-time first team All-
American Jessica Mendoza.
Now, Brangham is the senior
in the outfield and is passing
along her experience of the last
three and a half years to first
time starters freshman center
fielder Catalina Morris and
sophomore right fielder
Meghan Sickler.
"It has been like a role rever
sal," Brangham said. "I was the
new person on the team and had
never played in the outfield. And
now, it has been a really neat ex
perience to play alongside
younger players. 1 know the
players in the Pac-10 and their
tendencies and I can pass that
along."
Brangham's leadership in the
field is one of seniority and sta
bility.
"There is no doubt in my
mind when the ball is hit to left
field she is going to catch it," se
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"And as a pitcher it is so impor
tant to have that kind of confi
dence in your defense."
And, Nyberg should be confi
dent in Brangham's skills, as the
left fielder has made just seven
errors in the 245 games of her
Stanford career.
As knowledgeable, static and
dependable as Brangham has
been in the field, her spot in the
lineup has jumped quite a bit
since freshman year.
Her growth as a player at the
plate has reached a climax in her
senior campaign. She batted sev
enth or eighth at the beginning
of her collegiate career, but as a
senior Brangham's bat comes
third or fourth in the lineup.
"I think that my improve
ment at the plate has been a
product of experience," Brang
ham said. "I think I have just
grown as a player and the way I
can help the team."
Brangham is third on the team
in batting average at .285 and leads
the team with 25 bases on balls and
30 RBI.
Perhaps the most telling of
these is her team-leading 30 RBI.
"She is just so clutch," said se
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg. "Such a
large percentage of her hits are
when we need to have a hit. She is
always the person who steps up
when we need it."
Cassi has always proven to be a
team player and her timeliness at
the plate with runners in scoring
position reflects her commitment
to Stanford softball's success.
As Brangham sees the end of
her time at Stanford upon the
horizon, she recognizes the accom
plishments of the softball team of
which she has been a member.
"Every time I go out to the field
1 am reminded of how far this
team has come," Brangham said.
"We have this beautiful stadium
and when I came there was no sta
dium, just to see that kind of phys
ical progression of our program is
so fulfilling."
Beyond the construction of a
stadium, Brangham was part of
the first Stanford softball team to
ever make the Women's College
World Series in 2001.
But, in addition to the record
setting and record breaking, the
senior also recognizes those results
that will last beyond the end of the
season.
"The four of us seniors have
been really close since we arrived at
Stanford," Brangham said. "They
are friendships that will last a life
time."

Consistency has always been
the lefty's trademark, as she
reached base in 38 of 39 games as
a high school senior and batted
.406 for her team.
Beyond excellence in the
field, Brangham's batting aver
age was matched with a grade
point average of 3.95 in the class
room.
Since high school, not much
has changed.
The American Studies major
was named an NFCA All-Ameri
can Scholar-Athlete and Second
Team Academic All-Pac-1() se
lection in her junior season at
Stanford.
But, honors and statistics can
not express the magnitude of
Brangham's contributions to
Stanford softball.

As a freshman, she started
next to National Team member
and four-time first team All-
American Jessica Mendoza.
Now, Brangham is the senior
in the outfield and is passing
along her experience of the last
three and a half years to first
time starters freshman center
fielder Catalina Morris and
sophomore right fielder
Meghan Sickler.
"It has been like a role rever
sal," Brangham said. "I was the
new person on the team and had
never played in the outfield. And
now, it has been a really neat ex
perience to play alongside
younger players. 1 know the
players in the Pac-10 and their
tendencies and I can pass that
along."
Brangham's leadership in the
field is one of seniority and sta
bility.
"There is no doubt in my
mind when the ball is hit to left
field she is going to catch it," se
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg said.
"And as a pitcher it is so impor
tant to have that kind of confi
dence in your defense."
And, Nyberg should be confi
dent in Brangham's skills, as the
left fielder has made just seven
errors in the 245 games of her
Stanford career.
As knowledgeable, static and
dependable as Brangham has
been in the field, her spot in the
lineup has jumped quite a bit
since freshman year.
Her growth as a player at the
plate has reached a climax in her
senior campaign. She batted sev
enth or eighth at the beginning
of her collegiate career, but as a
senior Brangham's bat comes
third or fourth in the lineup.
"I think that my improve
ment at the plate has been a
product of experience," Brang
ham said. "I think I have just
grown as a player and the way I
can help the team."
Brangham is third on the team
in batting average at .285 and leads
the team with 25 bases on balls and
30 RBI.
Perhaps the most telling of
these is her team-leading 30 RBI.
"She is just so clutch," said se
nior pitcher Tori Nyberg. "Such a
large percentage of her hits are
when we need to have a hit. She is
always the person who steps up
when we need it."
Cassi has always proven to be a
team player and her timeliness at
the plate with runners in scoring
position reflects her commitment
to Stanford softball's success.
As Brangham sees the end of
her time at Stanford upon the
horizon, she recognizes the accom
plishments of the softball team of
which she has been a member.
"Every time I go out to the field
1 am reminded of how far this
team has come," Brangham said.
"We have this beautiful stadium
and when I came there was no sta
dium, just to see that kind of phys
ical progression of our program is
so fulfilling."
Beyond the construction of a
stadium, Brangham was part of
the first Stanford softball team to
ever make the Women's College
World Series in 2001.
But, in addition to the record
setting and record breaking, the
senior also recognizes those results
that will last beyond the end of the
season.
"The four of us seniors have
been really close since we arrived at
Stanford," Brangham said. "They
are friendships that will last a life
time."
