Over the holidays Tyrone Will
ingham accepted a surprising
birthday present and Stanford
athletic director Ted Leland began
a challenging New Year's resolu
tion: find the Cardinal a new head
football coach.
On Dec. 30 — Willingham's
48th birthday — the seven-year
Stanford coach was introduced as
the new head coach at Notre
Dame, just three days after the No.
16 Cardinal's loss to Georgia Tech
in the Seattle Bowl.
Willingham claimed to be con
tent on the Farm when the Notre
Dame job opened early last month.
He referred to his candidacy fora
job atop college football's crown
jewel as "laughable."
Yet when Notre Dame again came
knocking, Willingham was lured
by the Irish's storied history, the
Golden Dome and a six-year con
tract reportedly valued between
two and three million dollars a
year, more than twice what he
made at Stanford.
At Willingham's first press con
ference in South Bend, he remi
nisced to the days lie spent as a boy
watching Notre Dame football,
even sneaking out of his North
Carolina church on Sundays to
watch the Fighting Irish high
lights.
"Those things, somewhere,
were laced in the back of my
mind," Willingham said. "To say it
is a dream come true is true."
The position at Notre Dame's
helm opened Dec. 2, when Athlet
ic Director Kevin White fired
coach Bob Davie after a 5-6 season.
Willingham's name popped up on
the ensuing coaching search and

the Irish were granted permission
by Stanford to interview Willing
ham. That interview never took
place, and when White was re
buffed by his top choices, Oakland
Raiders' coach John Gruden and
San Francisco 49ers' coach Steve
Manned, White settled on Geor
gia Tech's George O'Leary.
Despite Willingham's state
ments to the contrary, he appar
ently had his eyes fixed on the
Notre Dame prize from the begin
ning.
When White called Willingham
to inform him that O'Leary would
be the Irish coach, Willingham
told him "You're hiring the wrong
guy. You need to hire me. You
know you have to hire me."
Then, after O'Leary was forced
to resign just five days later be
cause of lies in his biography con
cerning both his academic and ath
letic achievements, White was back
at his rolodex.
Yet again Willingham was not
the first choice, as a series ofothers,
including Washington's Rick
Neuheisel, reportedly turned
down White's offer before Willing
ham got the call.
White will not have to worry
about Willingham's resume.
Willingham has led Stanford to
four bowl games in seven years
and holds a 44-36-1 record at Stan
ford. He has twice garnered Pacif
ic 10 Conference coach of the year
honors and led the Cardinal to the
1999 Rose Bowl.
The coach's stoic on-field de
meanor and disciplined approach
to coaching belies his relationship
with players, many of whom re
spect him as a father-figure and
praise his integrity and work ethic.
At Stanford Willingham demon
strated his ability to use the Uni
versity's strict academic standards
as a boon to the football program

by recruiting only the nation's best
and brightest players.
Yet Willingham is leaving the
relaxed, low-publicity Stanford
program for one of sport's most
high-profile positions, and many
wonder if he is up to its challenges.
Fora man who shies away
from the spotlight, Notre Dame's
national television coverage,
weekly pep rallies of more than
12,000 and huge Sunday press
conferences will be a huge differ
ence from Stanford's sparsely at
tended weekly press conferences.
Even iu Willingham's introducto
ry conference he cut reporters
short by asking for an end to the
questions.
Willingham's every move will
be under intense national scrutiny.
Notre Dame's alumni and fans ex
pect nothing less than a national
championship, and Willingham's
time to achieve this goal is limited.
Davie was terminated the year
after a successful 9-3 campaign,
and his winning percentage at
Notre Dame is .583, slightly better
than Willingham's .549 percent
age for the Cardinal.
A couple meager years in South
Bend and Willingham could find
himself going the way of Davie.
But Notre Dame provides op
portunities that Willingham has
hoped for ever since he began his
coaching career.
In addition to gaining the abili
ty to recruit nearly any player in
the nation, an impossibility under
Stanford's academic guidelines, as
the first black head coach in Irish
history, Willingham hopes to carve
new racial pathways in college
football. His hiring has been re
peatedly commended by national
civil rights leaders.
"Part of my philosophy is that
there's a greater good, that we're
out there to benefit not just your

self, that's important, but to bene
fit others," Willingham said.
Still, home for winter break,
Willingham's former players were
shocked to learn of his decision.
"I felt we had gotten by [the ru
mors] and I was not expecting him
to go anywhere," said junior full
back Casey Moore. "I found out
the morning of the 31st, when I
got up my parents told me. One of
my uncles had seen it on Sports-
Center and called the house."
The search for the next Cardi
nal head coach began the mo
ment Willingham decided to
leave. The athletic department
has stated it will make no an
nouncement until a new leader is
decided upon, and Leland has al
ready embarked on a journey to

find Stanford's next coach.
Whoever lands next year's job
as head Cardinal will have Willing
ham to thank for the added expec
tations. During his tenure Willing
ham has taken Stanford from an
overachieving team happy with a
winning season and a Big Game
victory over California to a Pac-10
power capable of landing top re
cruits and challenging the nation's
top teams.
"What Coach Willingham
began at Stanford is something
that is here to last," Moore said.
"He is a winner in all areas of life
and those of us that will be leading
this team in the future are fully ca
pable of carrying on that winning
attitude no matter who the new
coach is."
