# Card finally loses to Cal

This story originally ran Nov. 25, 2002.
The Stanford football team wore its motto
proudly on its chest going into the 105 th Big
Game at Berkeley. The coaches preached it
and their T-shirts proclaimed it: To win, the
Cardinal needed to "execute", something it
had been unable to do all season long.
Stanford came to Memorial Stadium as
heavy underdogs, and the Bears ultimately
provided the only execution, striking down
the Cardinal 30-7, which returned the Axe to
California after a seven-year absence.
"This is one of the worst feelings I've had,"
senior tailback Kerry Carter said. "[The Axe]
is something we've had for so long, and we
cherish it, not just this team but anyone who's
ever put on a Stanford uniform. We feel like
we've let them down."
The loss cements Stanford (2-9, 1-7 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) to its worst record in 19
years, securing the biggest turnaround in
school history after last season's 9-3 record.
Cal (7-5,4-4) is also on the end of a school
record turnaround — though, one for the
better — as first-year coach Jeff Tedford has
resurrected a 1-10 squad from 2001 into a
team that would be headed fora bowl if not
for an NCAA postseason ban.
"This is the best feeling I've ever had," Cal
senior corner Jemeel Powell said. "I used to
feel like we were cursed against Stanford, but
all that ended today."
Initially, it appeared Stanford might over
come the odds and win its record eighth Big
Game. After forcing a Cal punt on the Bears'
opening possession, the Cardinal put togeth
er a 50-yard scoring drive capped by redshirt
freshman Kyle Matter's 8-yard touchdown
pass to sophomore Teyo Johnson.
But those seven points was all that Stan
ford could manage, and the Bears quickly an
swered when senior quarterback Kyle Boiler
found Lashaun Ward fora 31-yard scoring
pass. From that point on, Cal dominated
Stanford on both sides of the ball.
Running back Joe Igber led the Bears with
a Big Game record 226 yards on 26 carries,
including a 42-yard end-zone scamper in the
second quarter.
Stanford was especially ineffective on the
ground, as Carter bumbled his way to just 34
yards on 12 carries to lead the team.

The Cardinal did not fare much better
when it took to the air. Matter completed just
16 of 30 passes for 151 yards with two inter
ceptions. The passing ineptitude was a fitting
end to a season in which new head coach
Buddy Teevens promised to bring the "fun
and-gun" offense to Stanford — instead, the
team was the worst through the air in the Pac
-10.
"It's frustrating. Wejust were not very pro
ductive," Teevens said. "I feel disappointed,
but not discouraged. In my business, if you
don't win, some people want you out right
away, and some don't."
Teevens will likely be back fora second sea
son and a chance at redemption, while his
counterpart at Cal is receiving praise as the
savior of Golden Bear football.
"The program is on the rise," said Boiler,
who threw for 188 yards and two touch
downs. "I wish I could come back for four

more years with Coach Tedford. It
was great to see the goalposts go
down."
It seemed that the real Big
Game battle happened not in ihe
one-sided contest but after the
game when Cal fans fought with
police and security to tear down the
goalposts. Memorial Stadium was
hosting its first sellout since 1994,
the last time Cal won a Big Game,
and blue and gold dominated the
crowd, most of which was anticipat
ing an end to seven years of frustra
tion in Berkeley.

The fans cleared the bleachers
and rushed onto the field even be
fore the final whistle sounded,
quickly making a move for the goal
posts, which were surrounded by
security. The first few efforts failed,
but eventually the masses won out
and toppled the north goalpost,
with the south uprights immediate
ly following.
Several arrests were made, but
no injuries have been reported.
Stanford's biggest injury is its
bruised ego, as it enters the off
season with a five-game losing
streak and without its most trea
sured trophy.
"Anyone associated with our
program has got to be disappoint
ed," Teevens said
