This article originally ran an March 6, 2003.
Hundreds of protesters took to the
Quad instead of the classroom yesterday in
Stanford's first student strike since the Viet
nam War and its largest anti-war rally in
several years. By holding the event, entitled
"Books Not Bombs," Stanford joined 260
other campuses across the country in rally
ing against a pre-emptive war in Iraq.
Organizers estimated that 1,000 students
attended the event during the day — many
with green bands wrapped around their
arms to express solidarity against a war.
"Are you ready to strike?" senior Angad
Bhalla shouted from the steps of the Clock
Tower at 10 a.m., as class-bound students
attempted to navigate through the throng
of raised fists and sandwich boards.
"Damn right!" yelled back the crowd.
They then marched around Meyer Li
brary, past Encina Hall, between Memor
ial Auditorium and the Hoover Institu
tion and, finally, through the east en
trance of the Main Quad, where organiz
ers had draped cloth banners painted
with anti-war slogans.
"Cowboy culture kills," declared a sand
wich board that sat in the middle of the
Quad.
"Silence = violence," read another.
The Coalition of Students Against War,
an umbrella alliance of more than 25 cam
pus groups, began organizing the strike just
a week and a half ago after being contacted
by a nation J organization, the National
Youth & Student Peace Coalition.
'It wasn't at all the ordinary crowd'
By yesterday morning, the Stanford
coalition had transformed the usually quiet
Quad into a sort of alternative classroom.
Colorful anti-war signs lined the
courtyard. Tables were stacked with
paper and envelopes for students to use
to write letters to National Security Ad
viser and former University Provost Con
doleezza Rice. American flags were
spray-painted in orange - a subversion of
the color used by the government as a
"high-risk" terror alert.
By 11 a.m., students had arranged
themselves in five groups around the Quad
to hear professors speak on such topics as

the regional repercussions of war, the bio
logical evolution of aggression and the pos
sible domestic backlash against minorities.
"I've never seen anything like this," said
senior Meghana Reddy, who has helped
organize nearly 40 rallies at Stanford. "It's
incredible — it wasn't at all the ordinary
crowd."
A handful of protesters were several
years younger than the typical Stanford stu
dent. After reading about the strike in the
newspaper, a group of approximately 20
students from Jordan Middle School in
Palo Alto walked out of class and trekked
down El Camino for 30 minutes before ar
riving in the Quad.
The school's administrators had made
an announcement in the morning prohibit
ing students from leaving campus, said
Stephanie Kenny, an eighth-grader.
"They came to talk to us, saying they
wanted to support peace, and they seemed
really sincere — but then they told us that
they wanted us to go to the gym to make
posters," she said.
Instead, the students staged their own
strike and left campus.
"I'm not doing it to get out of school,"
Kenny said. "I'm doing it to support peace.
It sends a stronger message when we come
out to join a diverse group of people."
Freshman Linda Tran agreed.
"I think it's about time that our school
starts waking up," she said. "What can stu
dents do? They can let their voices be
heard."
University President John Hennessy
was among the attendees who expressed
uneasiness with the impending war.
"Personally, as an individual, I'm still not
convinced that war is the right strategy," he
said.
'This is the reason you go to college'
The University had previously said that
the strike could not take place in the Quad,
out of concern that the noise would disturb
classes and an Ash Wednesday service in
Memorial Church.
But Hennessy said the organizers were
behaving in a respectful way and that he
supported the decision of some students to
miss class to attend the rally.
"There's a feeling of growing momen
tum regarding this war and a feeling by a lot
of students that they don't understand the
issues," he said. "All of us have a limited abil

ity to do anything, but if in good conscience,
you reach the decision that this is a mistake,
you have an obligation to make your voice
known."
Hennessy recalled protesting the Viet
nam War in his youth.
"All of us had friends who were drafted,
who were injured or killed," he said. "That
was a very long, drawn-out conflict, and the
goal of the war became more uncertain as
time passed."
Some professors questioned the United
States' objectives in the anticipated war with
Iraq.
"When you're dealing with some of the
largest oil fields in the world and when two
of the world's powers want that oil, it is
about oil," said Political Science Prof. Terry
Karl in a lecture titled "Oil and the War in
Iraq."
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy
discussed what he felt were the most per
suasive - and unpersuasive - arguments
against the war.
One of the most compelling reasons not
to go to war, he said, is the risk of deepen
ing resentment of the United States in the

Middle East.
"I can imagine Osama bin Laden rub
bing his hands in glee at this moment, say
ing, 'Thank you, George W. Bush, for
doing my recruitment for me,'" he said.
However, Abernethy said he does not
agree with the premise of the student strike,
titled "Books Not Bombs."
"It implies that we should do one thing
and not the other," he said. "Any president
must deal with domestic and foreign prob
lems."
Sophomore Sumeeta Varma appreciat
ed the opportunity to learn about the war,
but said that she felt uncomfortable with the
protest's rhetoric of "reclaiming our educa
tion" by skipping classes.
"I don't think the University has done a
poor job in educating us," she said. "I'm at
tending the protest without missing any
classes today. I think that's definitely possi
ble and it's a reasonable balance."
Junior Michael Hipolito, on the other
hand, said that he found little motivation to
attend the rally at all.
"I think it's great that a lot of people have
strong opinions on this, but I myself just

don't really have an interest," he said.
"Sometimes, I feel like there are enough
people doing it that I don't need to."
Hipolito's biology professor was one of
at least 26 professors who canceled classes
yesterday. Hipolito, who considers himself
"apolitical," chose to sleep in.
As Hipolito stood in the Quad, he was
stopped by a friend.
"What's going on?" asked his friend.
"Protest," Hipolito said.
"Against what?"
"The war."
"What war?" the friend quipped, then
biked away.
Meanwhile, about 400 students filled the
center of the Quad, listening to Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo speak at a podium.
One of those students, junior Ami Shah,
stayed at the protest nearly all afternoon.
This was the first anti-war rally she had ever
attended.
"We're young and we have the time and
energy for this," she said. "This is what you
imagine when you're ending high school
and getting ready to move on. This is the
reason you go to college."

organized in coordination with several hundred other colleges nationwide, protested U.S. steps toward war with Iraq.
