# Men fall to Maryland in Elite 8

### SAMEER AHMED THE STANFORD DAILY 
This article originally ran April 2, 2001.
ANAHEIM —All season long, the
No. 2 Stanford men's basketball team
and the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference
talked about how they never received
any respect.
Because of the media's East Coast
bias, the Pac- 10's television deal with the
Fox Sports Network and the three-hour
time zone differential between coasts,
Pac-10 players and coaches complained
that the American people knew very lit
tle about West Coast basketball.
Sadly, the Cardinal's first nationally
televised game this season, last Saturday's
87-73 loss to Maryland in the Elite Eight
of the NCAA Tournament, was also its
last of the season. Even more unfair for
the Stanford players, the defeat by Mary
land will be the one Stanford game that
Americans will remember the most.
But any die-hard member of the
Sixth Man Club knows that Saturday's
loss was an aberration in an otherwise al
most perfect season for the Cardinal, a
team that head coach Mike Mont
gomery called one of his best ever.
"We're as proud of these kids as we
can be in all the things we've accom
plished [this season]," Montgomery said.
Montgomery has a lot to proud
about.
Stanford's 31 wins this season are the
most in school history, and no matter
who wins the NCAA Championship
today, the Pac-10 champion Cardinal
will finish this season as the only team in
the nation with less than four losses.
This is the same team that started the
season 20-0 and had many people think
ing Stanford would finish the season un
defeated. The Cardinal also didn't lose a
regular season game away from Maples
Pavilion this season.
While Stanford performed excep
tionally all season, perhaps the peak of its
success came over winter break when the
Cardinal defeated both Duke and Ari
zona, the two teams competing fora na
tional title today in Minneapolis.
On Dec. 21 in front of the largest
crowd to watch a collegiate basketball
game in the state of California, sopho
more swingman Casey Jacobsen banked

in a jumper with 3.6 seconds left in the
game as the then-No. 3 Cardinal roared
back from an 11-point deficit in the final
four minutes to beat the top-ranked
Blue Devils, 84-83, at the Pete Newell
Challenge.
Two weeks later, Stanford beat pre
season No. 1 Arizona with relative ease,
85-76. in Tucson for the first time since
1996.
This year's team was led by one of the

strongest senior classes in school history,
point guard Michael McDonald and tor
wards Ryan Mendez and Jarron Collins.
"I've learned a lot this season from
the seniors," Jacobsen said. 1 hose guys
know what's up. My goal is to leave Stan
ford basketball with the pride and digni
ty that they have left us with. It's been a
pleasure, and we will miss them."
The seniors will leave the Farm with
more than just pride and dignity.
Leading the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting
percentage (51.4 percent) and assist-to
turnover ratio (3-to-l), McDonald had
his best season by far and was considered
by many to be the key to Stanford s suc
cess this year.
Co-captain Mendez was the team's
vocal leader and a valuable scorer who
rarely missed a free throw, especially
when the game was on the line.
Mendez's 93.1 free-throw percentage
led the nation, and he set a Pac-10
record by hitting 49 consecutive free
throws.
Jarron Collins, a sure bet for the
NBA, complemented his twin brother
Jason to give the Cardinal one of its best
frontlines ever. Jarron, a Wooden All-
American and First Team All Pac-10 se
lection, finished the season averaging a
respectable 12.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game.
Unless both Collins twins get drafted
by the same NBA team, the Maryland
loss was probably the last time Jarron
and Jason will play competitive basket
ball together. When the Southern Cali
fornia duo chose Stanford over UCLA
and Arizona four years ago, they were
considered the most prominent Stan
ford recruits ever.
While Jason is eight minutes older
than Jarron, the 7-foot center has two
years of basketball eligibility remaining
at Stanford because of injuries he suf
fered his first two seasons. In his first sea
son as a regular starter, Jason became a
force for the Cardinal inside, highlight
ed by a career-high 33-point perfor
mance on Feb. 24 against Washington in
which Jason shocked the Maples faithful
by connecting on 4-of-5 3-pointers.
Because of his dominating presence
this season, Jason, a senior academical
ly, is strongly considering leaving Stan-

ford this year and joining Jarron
in the N BA. While Jason has stated
that he won't make a decision fora
while (he has until May 1.3), Jarron
reportedly told ESPN.com a few
days ago that he expects Jason to
declare for the June 27 N BA Draft.
Jason will probably attend NBA
workouts in Phoenix and possibly
Chicago but not sign with an
agent. He would have until June
20 to pull his name from the draft
and return to college.
"There's no doubt that if
[Jason] came back [to Stanford]
and stayed healthy, he would in
crease his value and his draft sta
tus," Montgomery said. "But he'd
probably be a first-round draft
pic k [now] and with that comes
guaranteed money."
Jacobsen, Stanford's first ever
first-team All-American, might test
the NBA waters also. While the

Cardinal sharpshooter, who aver
aged 18.1 points per game, said
earlier in the season that he would
definitely return to Stanford next
year because he didn't feel ready to
guard the quick NBA guards, his
answer wasn't as definitive after the
Man land loss.
"I haven't decided yet," Jacob
sen said. "But nothing's changed
from what I've been telling people
all year. I'm still leaning strongly to
ward coining back."
With all five starters potentially
gone next year, many wonder if
the Cardinal can be as dominant as
it has been in the recent past.
While the makeup of next year's
team will depend on whether Ja
cobsen and Jason Collins will re
turn, next season's squad promises
to be its most athletic ever. Red
shirt freshman forward Justin
Davis, sophomore guard Julius
Barnes and highly touted recruit
Josh Childress, three extremely
talented and quick athletes, could
all potentially start for Stanford
next season.

American and First Team All Pac-10 se
lection, finished the season averaging a
respectable 12.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game.
Unless both Collins twins get drafted
by the same NBA team, the Maryland
loss was probably the last time Jarron
and Jason will play competitive basket
ball together. When the Southern Cali
fornia duo chose Stanford over UCLA
and Arizona four years ago, they were
considered the most prominent Stan
ford recruits ever.
While Jason is eight minutes older
than Jarron, the 7-foot center has two
years of basketball eligibility remaining
at Stanford because of injuries he suf
fered his first two seasons. In his first sea
son as a regular starter, Jason became a
force for the Cardinal inside, highlight
ed by a career-high 33-point perfor
mance on Feb. 24 against Washington in
which Jason shocked the Maples faithful
by connecting on 4-of-5 3-pointers.
Because of his dominating presence
this season, Jason, a senior academical
ly, is strongly considering leaving Stan-

ford this year and joining Jarron
in the N BA. While Jason has stated
that he won't make a decision fora
while (he has until May 1.3), Jarron
reportedly told ESPN.com a few
days ago that he expects Jason to
declare for the June 27 N BA Draft.
Jason will probably attend NBA
workouts in Phoenix and possibly
Chicago but not sign with an
agent. He would have until June
20 to pull his name from the draft
and return to college.
"There's no doubt that if
[Jason] came back [to Stanford]
and stayed healthy, he would in
crease his value and his draft sta
tus," Montgomery said. "But he'd
probably be a first-round draft
pic k [now] and with that comes
guaranteed money."
Jacobsen, Stanford's first ever
first-team All-American, might test
the NBA waters also. While the

Cardinal sharpshooter, who aver
aged 18.1 points per game, said
earlier in the season that he would
definitely return to Stanford next
year because he didn't feel ready to
guard the quick NBA guards, his
answer wasn't as definitive after the
Man land loss.
"I haven't decided yet," Jacob
sen said. "But nothing's changed
from what I've been telling people
all year. I'm still leaning strongly to
ward coining back."
With all five starters potentially
gone next year, many wonder if
the Cardinal can be as dominant as
it has been in the recent past.
While the makeup of next year's
team will depend on whether Ja
cobsen and Jason Collins will re
turn, next season's squad promises
to be its most athletic ever. Red
shirt freshman forward Justin
Davis, sophomore guard Julius
Barnes and highly touted recruit
Josh Childress, three extremely
talented and quick athletes, could
all potentially start for Stanford
next season.

ANAHEIM —All season long, the
No. 2 Stanford men's basketball team
and the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference
talked about how they never received
any respect.
Because of the media's East Coast
bias, the Pac- 10's television deal with the
Fox Sports Network and the three-hour
time zone differential between coasts,
Pac-10 players and coaches complained
that the American people knew very lit
tle about West Coast basketball.
Sadly, the Cardinal's first nationally
televised game this season, last Saturday's
87-73 loss to Maryland in the Elite Eight
of the NCAA Tournament, was also its
last of the season. Even more unfair for
the Stanford players, the defeat by Mary
land will be the one Stanford game that
Americans will remember the most.
But any die-hard member of the
Sixth Man Club knows that Saturday's
loss was an aberration in an otherwise al
most perfect season for the Cardinal, a
team that head coach Mike Mont
gomery called one of his best ever.
"We're as proud of these kids as we
can be in all the things we've accom
plished [this season]," Montgomery said.
Montgomery has a lot to proud
about.
Stanford's 31 wins this season are the
most in school history, and no matter
who wins the NCAA Championship
today, the Pac-10 champion Cardinal
will finish this season as the only team in
the nation with less than four losses.
This is the same team that started the
season 20-0 and had many people think
ing Stanford would finish the season un
defeated. The Cardinal also didn't lose a
regular season game away from Maples
Pavilion this season.
While Stanford performed excep
tionally all season, perhaps the peak of its
success came over winter break when the
Cardinal defeated both Duke and Ari
zona, the two teams competing fora na
tional title today in Minneapolis.
On Dec. 21 in front of the largest
crowd to watch a collegiate basketball
game in the state of California, sopho
more swingman Casey Jacobsen banked

in a jumper with 3.6 seconds left in the
game as the then-No. 3 Cardinal roared
back from an 11-point deficit in the final
four minutes to beat the top-ranked
Blue Devils, 84-83, at the Pete Newell
Challenge.
Two weeks later, Stanford beat pre
season No. 1 Arizona with relative ease,
85-76. in Tucson for the first time since
1996.
This year's team was led by one of the

strongest senior classes in school history,
point guard Michael McDonald and tor
wards Ryan Mendez and Jarron Collins.
"I've learned a lot this season from
the seniors," Jacobsen said. 1 hose guys
know what's up. My goal is to leave Stan
ford basketball with the pride and digni
ty that they have left us with. It's been a
pleasure, and we will miss them."
The seniors will leave the Farm with
more than just pride and dignity.
Leading the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting
percentage (51.4 percent) and assist-to
turnover ratio (3-to-l), McDonald had
his best season by far and was considered
by many to be the key to Stanford s suc
cess this year.
Co-captain Mendez was the team's
vocal leader and a valuable scorer who
rarely missed a free throw, especially
when the game was on the line.
Mendez's 93.1 free-throw percentage
led the nation, and he set a Pac-10
record by hitting 49 consecutive free
throws.
Jarron Collins, a sure bet for the
NBA, complemented his twin brother
Jason to give the Cardinal one of its best
frontlines ever. Jarron, a Wooden All-
American and First Team All Pac-10 se
lection, finished the season averaging a
respectable 12.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game.
