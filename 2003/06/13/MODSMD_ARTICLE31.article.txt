# Barnes leads charge

This story originally ran on March
7, 2003.
Most would argue that last
year's Senior Day at Maples Pavil
ion held a lot more relevance than
tomorrow's celebration. Chants of
"one more year, one more year,"
for ex-Cardinal juniors Casey Ja
cobsen and Curtis Borchardt rang
out from the mouths of the Sixth
Man Club faithful as the signifi
cance of that moment and their
forthcoming career decisions were
apparent.
But a year has since past and
now amidst recent Stanford suc
cess, memories of that day have all
but faded.
Tomorrow evening, a "new"
batch of seniors will stroll to center
court to greet their mothers with
roses and smiles. And although
chants of "one more year" would
be futile with reference to senior
point guard Julius Barnes, that
doesn't mean that the sentiment
isn't there.
Despite the fact that he's been
here for four years, Barnes' final
game at Maples seems slightly pre
mature. Despite the fact that he's
played significant minutes in the
past, it almost feels as if we've all
just been introduced to the 6-foot
-1 point guard from Rowland
Heights, Calif. â€” that we're just
now beginning to know and feel
comfortable with and appreciate
his athletic style of play.
And to a certain extent his team
mates and coaches are finally be
coming accustomed to what his
athleticism and scorer's mentality
bring to the traditionally pass-first
Stanford point guard position.
"He's been able to play the point
position at a time when he really

hadn't played it in awhile," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery of Bai nes." I le's done a re
ally nice job and he's grown up,
he's graduating and he's had some
extremely good games for us. "
With that said, Montgomery's
decision to move Barnes into the
role of starting point guard was
definitely one of necessity. When
Stanford's projected starter at the
one-spot, sophomore Chris Her
nandez, re-broke his foot in early
December, Barnes was moved
back to floor general. And the Car
dinal has certainly been successful
with Barnes at the helm.
Interestingly enough, last sea
son's game against California at
Maples was a coming-out party of
sorts.Barnes' then-career high 27-
point performance, which culmi
nated with a 360-degree layup to
lead the Cardinal to victory over
the Golden Bears, offered specta
tors a small glimpse of how capable
he was offensively, of how explo
sive and athletic and spectacular
he could be. He brought a sense of
showmanship to Maples and is un
deniably a part of the athletic evo
lution of Stanford basketball.
"Julius is a much-improved
point guard from where he was
earlier in his career," junior shoot
ing guard Matt Lottich said. "He's
been creating shots for others,
which 1 think is the true job of a
point guard and as a result I think
people are beginning to notice that
lie's playing a lot better."
But the pressure that Barnes
has faced this year with having to
be the Cardinal's number one
scorer and number one ball han
dler has presented challenges. It's
taken awhile, but he's beginning to
figure out how to blend his explo
sive athleticism with the consistent
calm necessary to lead this team
through tough stretches.

"In terms of me settling into the
position, [I'm] trying not to force
things and getting comfortable
with my teammates," Barnes said.
"I think the coaching staff has
done a great job of trying to utilize
the skills that I bring to the table.
I've tried to adapt by not trying to
go full throttle all of the time. "
This is clearly demonstrated by
the fact that he is leading the team
both in scoring and assists. Barnes
is beginning to figure out how to
balance scoring and creating for
others, a feat, which couldn't come
at a better time fora Stanford team
ready to embark on the senior's
last post-season journey.
But for the time being, he's tak
ing one game at a time, which
brings us back to tomorrow's Cali

fornia matchup.
Traditionally, Senior Day at
Maples is a story of endings, of
farewell tributes and goodbyes. But
fora post-season-focused Barnes
there is no time to consider the sig
nificance of the clay, to even con
template the idea of it all being over.
"The finality of it all hasn't set
in," Barnes said. "It probably will
once the season's over and I have
time to reflect on it. But right now,
everything's just been routine -
practice, school, sleep. I'm just re
ally focused right now.
"It's definitely been a quick four
years, though. I remember being
dropped off the first clay [of fresh
man year]. It's been crazy. But at
the same time, it's also been a lot of
fun."

he could in 2003. Picked to finish in the bottom half of the Pac-10, Barnes led
the Cardinal to a second-place conference finish.
