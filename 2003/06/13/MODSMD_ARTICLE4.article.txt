Student responds to
I-Hum articles
As one of the student members
of both the I-Hum Governance
Board and I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee, I'd like to respond
to two of The Daily's articles pub
lished a few weeks ago ("Survey in
dicates high freshman satisfac
tion" and "Self-study on I-Hum
downplays concerns," May 13). I
feel partly responsible, as a stu
dent representative, for not taking
the initiative to communicate with
The Daily earlier to avoid misun
derstandings.
Did the I-Hum self-study
"downplay student concerns"? I
think I-Hum Director Rob Robin
son has already done an excellent
job of addressing this issue ("I-
Hum self-study explained," May
14), but I just want to say that at no
time did I ever think the I-Hum
program was being too easy on it
self, or trying to "hush up" nega
tive data. In fact, those of us on the
Governance Board and Advisory
Committee often felt that the sum
maries were too critical of I-Hum.
But exactly why are (some) stu
dents dissatisfied with I-Hum?
There's no getting around the
fact that I-Hum is a mandatory re
quirement (SLE people except
ed). Nobody — especially Stan
ford students — likes being re
quired to do something.
I recently went hiking in Ore
gon with some fellow alums from
the Class of 2002. While clamber
ing over moss-covered logs, we

talked about how all the books we
want to read now are I-Hum
books! While we may not like it at
first, like eating spinach, I-Hum is
good lor you in the long run.
And I-Hum is getting better. I
think both the qualitative and
quantitative data from the study
show this in spades. The courses
are much better than they were
my freshman year, when the pro
gram was in its infancy.
For example, I'm amazed at the
fall quarter course, "Citizenship,"
with Profs. Gerhard Casper,
William Perry and Ramon Saldi
var — any one of whom would be
awesome, but to have all three
teaching together? Academic ec
stasy! Where else but I-Hum
could you have professors from
law, philosophy and English all
engaging the same texts and sub
jects?
Of course, not all courses are
like "Citizenship." Some courses
are better-taught than others. So
what can be done to improve I-
Hum? First, departments need to
make it a priority to put their best
professors in I-Hum. Some al
ready have, but there still aren't
enough. .Although it's tough in
this time of budget pressure to ex
pend resources on I-Hum, each
department that cares about the
level of humanistic education at
Stanford needs to do its part.
Second, we, as students, must
also realize that we bear the bur
den of making I-Hum succeed.
Even the best lecturers and teach
ing fellows cannot force us to real
ly engage ourselves in the course.
Yes, they can try various methods
to shame or scare us into coming

to lecture and doing the reading,
but if we care about the value of
our Stanford degree, we need to
put our hearts into it!
One way you can do this: If you
want to volunteer your time to im
proving and reforming the I-
Hum program, apply to serve on
the newly formed I-Hum Student
Advisory Board. Email Orrin
"Rob" Robinson at owr@stan
ford.edu and Cherie Ross at
clross@stanford.edu for more in

Professors, staff members ask
Toledo to free American prisoner
Editor's note: The following is an open
letter to Alejandro Toledo.
We, the undersigned, are de
lighted for you and for Stanford
University that you will be giving
the Commencement address at
your alma mater. We also ap
plaud your two years of efforts to
move Peru forward from a dicta
torship to a functioning democra
cy. We are, however, concerned
that, despite a unanimous ruling
in her favor by the Inter-Ameri
can Commission on Human
Rights in April 2002, U.S. citizen
Lori Berenson remains in a Peru
vian prison. We realize that her
wrongful incarceration was pro
moted by the Fujimori dictator
ship for its political gains, but we
are disappointed that your ad
ministration hasn't righted this
wrong — especially following the
Sept. 6 decision of the Inter-
American Commission on
Human Rights.
We ask you to personally inter
vene and find a humanitarian res
olution to this injustice. We be
lieve you will have the support of
President Bush and the heartfelt

thanks of the people of the United
States if you could accomplish this

New laundry fee program
'flawed'
The new pricing strategy to be
implemented for the use of laun
dry machines is flawed as it cre
ates the wrong incentives for
laundry-doers while charging
those who don't use the laundry
system ("New laundry fees to be
$28 per quarter," June 4). By
having a flat fee of $28 per quar
ter for laundry privileges, stu
dents have every incentive to try
to do as many loads of laundry as
possible throughout the quarter.
This will in turn create even
longer lines than already exist
for machines and will lead to the
higher usage of these machines.
And where are my environmen
talists? If people are using the
machines as much as possible,
more water, more detergent and
more electricity will be used, and
that's a bad thing.
One of the main arguments
given for the new pricing scheme
is because of student complaints
over "old washers, faulty dryers,
broken card readers" and bro
ken coin machines. But broken

machines have nothing to do
with the pricing strategy; broken
machines are due to negligent
companies that don't keep up
their machines. I see no reason
why changing to a fixed-fee sys
tem will improve machine tjnali
ty. Just fix the machines, and
there won't be any more broken
machines.
Even if these reasons for not
implementing the new pricing
system aren't enough, the overall
cost per quarter will likely rise for
many students. Fourteen com
pleted loads of laundry per quar
ter is a lot. I definitely don't stink
up that many clothes per quar
ter. So why should I have to sub
sidize students who are less effi
cient at loading up the machines?
Assuming that students are like
me, ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli's guess that "this is a major
win for cost-of-living issues on
campus" is wrong. Sure, I'm
grateful that my parents will start
footing the bill for my stinky
clothes, but if my laundry bill
rises, the Hansen family will be
worse off.
I have never seen a laundro
mat where users are charged a
flat fee and allowed to use the
machines as much as they can for
a set time, and so I'm naturally
reluctant to think this will im
prove the laundry problem. Just
like Ratul Narain who was quot
ed in the story, 1 also hate bro
ken washers, dryers, and change
machines, but the fixed-fee pric
ing strategy is not the way to go
about fixing broke-ass laundry
machines.
Stanford should purchase the
machines, perform basic up-keep
on the facilities, and keep the same
price per load scheme. If $1 per
load isn't enough to cover these
costs, simply raise the rate. But
don't make fresh-smelling stu
dents like myself subsidize other

students to do their laundry.

Flat laundry fee not a 'win for
cost of Iving campaign'
While ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli and other members
of the ASSU feel that the new $28
flat laundry fee is "a major win
for cost-of-living issues on cam
pus," I'd like to say that I feel oth
erwise.
It's already ridiculous that the
price to wash (or dry) a load of
laundry rose from $0.75 to $ 1 just
this past year. To now answer stu
dent complaints of broken ma
chines and non-functional change
machines with a universally ap
plied $28 fee is completely illogi
cal. Why don't we just fix the
change machines and make sure
the washers and dryers that we
have are functional and avoid ap
plying semi-communist ideals to
our laundry fees?
The $28 cost is arbitrary, if
nothing else, and unfair to those
that don't need to do 14 loads of
laundry every quarter. Further
more, for many individuals who
line-dry, this $28 fee indicates they
will have to do 28 loads of laundry
in order to be getting their
money's worth.
fhe ASSU should take serious
ly the concerns that its own cost of
living director expressed: "the
lack of student involvement in the
decision-making process to con
vert to a new laundry initiative." I
agree that doing laundry can be
an atrocious experience at Stan
ford, but I don't think making it
more expensive for the majority of
students is any great accomplish
ment.

like "Citizenship." Some courses
are better-taught than others. So
what can be done to improve I-
Hum? First, departments need to
make it a priority to put their best
professors in I-Hum. Some al
ready have, but there still aren't
enough. .Although it's tough in
this time of budget pressure to ex
pend resources on I-Hum, each
department that cares about the
level of humanistic education at
Stanford needs to do its part.
Second, we, as students, must
also realize that we bear the bur
den of making I-Hum succeed.
Even the best lecturers and teach

Yes, they can try various methods
to shame or scare us into coming

to lecture and doing the reading,
but if we care about the value of
our Stanford degree, we need to
put our hearts into it!

New laundry fee program
'flawed'
The new pricing strategy to be
implemented for the use of laun
dry machines is flawed as it cre
ates the wrong incentives for
laundry-doers while charging
those who don't use the laundry
system ("New laundry fees to be
$28 per quarter," June 4). By
having a flat fee of $28 per quar
ter for laundry privileges, stu
dents have every incentive to try
to do as many loads of laundry as
possible throughout the quarter.
This will in turn create even
longer lines than already exist
for machines and will lead to the
higher usage of these machines.
And where are my environmen
talists? If people are using the
machines as much as possible,
more water, more detergent and
more electricity will be used, and
that's a bad thing.
One of the main arguments
given for the new pricing scheme
is because of student complaints
over "old washers, faulty dryers,
broken card readers" and bro
ken coin machines. But broken

machines have nothing to do
with the pricing strategy; broken
machines are due to negligent
companies that don't keep up
their machines. I see no reason
why changing to a fixed-fee sys
tem will improve machine tjnali
ty. Just fix the machines, and
there won't be any more broken
machines.
Even if these reasons for not
implementing the new pricing
system aren't enough, the overall
cost per quarter will likely rise for
many students. Fourteen com
pleted loads of laundry per quar
ter is a lot. I definitely don't stink
up that many clothes per quar
ter. So why should I have to sub
sidize students who are less effi
cient at loading up the machines?
Assuming that students are like
me, ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli's guess that "this is a major
win for cost-of-living issues on
campus" is wrong. Sure, I'm
grateful that my parents will start
footing the bill for my stinky
clothes, but if my laundry bill
rises, the Hansen family will be
worse off.
I have never seen a laundro
mat where users are charged a
flat fee and allowed to use the
machines as much as they can for
a set time, and so I'm naturally
reluctant to think this will im
prove the laundry problem. Just
like Ratul Narain who was quot
ed in the story, 1 also hate bro
ken washers, dryers, and change
machines, but the fixed-fee pric
ing strategy is not the way to go
about fixing broke-ass laundry
machines.
Stanford should purchase the
machines, perform basic up-keep
on the facilities, and keep the same
price per load scheme. If $1 per
load isn't enough to cover these
costs, simply raise the rate. But
don't make fresh-smelling stu
dents like myself subsidize other

students to do their laundry.

Flat laundry fee not a 'win for
cost of Iving campaign'
While ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli and other members
of the ASSU feel that the new $28
flat laundry fee is "a major win
for cost-of-living issues on cam
pus," I'd like to say that I feel oth
erwise.
It's already ridiculous that the
price to wash (or dry) a load of
laundry rose from $0.75 to $ 1 just
this past year. To now answer stu
dent complaints of broken ma
chines and non-functional change
machines with a universally ap
plied $28 fee is completely illogi
cal. Why don't we just fix the
change machines and make sure
the washers and dryers that we
have are functional and avoid ap
plying semi-communist ideals to
our laundry fees?
The $28 cost is arbitrary, if
nothing else, and unfair to those
that don't need to do 14 loads of
laundry every quarter. Further
more, for many individuals who
line-dry, this $28 fee indicates they
will have to do 28 loads of laundry
in order to be getting their
money's worth.
fhe ASSU should take serious
ly the concerns that its own cost of
living director expressed: "the
lack of student involvement in the
decision-making process to con
vert to a new laundry initiative." I
agree that doing laundry can be
an atrocious experience at Stan
ford, but I don't think making it
more expensive for the majority of
students is any great accomplish
ment.

Student responds to
I-Hum articles
As one of the student members
of both the I-Hum Governance
Board and I-Hum Review Adviso
ry Committee, I'd like to respond
to two of The Daily's articles pub
lished a few weeks ago ("Survey in
dicates high freshman satisfac
tion" and "Self-study on I-Hum
downplays concerns," May 13). I
feel partly responsible, as a stu
dent representative, for not taking
the initiative to communicate with
The Daily earlier to avoid misun
derstandings.
Did the I-Hum self-study
"downplay student concerns"? I
think I-Hum Director Rob Robin
son has already done an excellent
job of addressing this issue ("I-
Hum self-study explained," May
14), but I just want to say that at no
time did I ever think the I-Hum
program was being too easy on it
self, or trying to "hush up" nega
tive data. In fact, those of us on the
Governance Board and Advisory
Committee often felt that the sum
maries were too critical of I-Hum.
But exactly why are (some) stu
dents dissatisfied with I-Hum?
There's no getting around the
fact that I-Hum is a mandatory re
quirement (SLE people except
ed). Nobody — especially Stan
ford students — likes being re
quired to do something.
I recently went hiking in Ore
gon with some fellow alums from
the Class of 2002. While clamber
ing over moss-covered logs, we

talked about how all the books we
want to read now are I-Hum
books! While we may not like it at
first, like eating spinach, I-Hum is
good lor you in the long run.
And I-Hum is getting better. I
think both the qualitative and
quantitative data from the study
show this in spades. The courses
are much better than they were
my freshman year, when the pro
gram was in its infancy.
For example, I'm amazed at the
fall quarter course, "Citizenship,"
with Profs. Gerhard Casper,
William Perry and Ramon Saldi
var — any one of whom would be
awesome, but to have all three
teaching together? Academic ec
stasy! Where else but I-Hum
could you have professors from
law, philosophy and English all
engaging the same texts and sub
jects?
Of course, not all courses are
like "Citizenship." Some courses

New laundry fee program
'flawed'
The new pricing strategy to be
implemented for the use of laun
dry machines is flawed as it cre
ates the wrong incentives for
laundry-doers while charging
those who don't use the laundry
system ("New laundry fees to be
$28 per quarter," June 4). By
having a flat fee of $28 per quar
ter for laundry privileges, stu
dents have every incentive to try
to do as many loads of laundry as
possible throughout the quarter.
This will in turn create even
longer lines than already exist
for machines and will lead to the
higher usage of these machines.
And where are my environmen
talists? If people are using the
machines as much as possible,
more water, more detergent and
more electricity will be used, and
that's a bad thing.
One of the main arguments
given for the new pricing scheme
is because of student complaints
over "old washers, faulty dryers,
broken card readers" and bro
ken coin machines. But broken

machines have nothing to do
with the pricing strategy; broken
machines are due to negligent
companies that don't keep up
their machines. I see no reason
why changing to a fixed-fee sys
tem will improve machine tjnali
ty. Just fix the machines, and
there won't be any more broken
machines.
Even if these reasons for not
implementing the new pricing
system aren't enough, the overall
cost per quarter will likely rise for
many students. Fourteen com
pleted loads of laundry per quar
ter is a lot. I definitely don't stink
up that many clothes per quar
ter. So why should I have to sub
sidize students who are less effi
cient at loading up the machines?
Assuming that students are like
me, ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli's guess that "this is a major
win for cost-of-living issues on
campus" is wrong. Sure, I'm
grateful that my parents will start
footing the bill for my stinky
clothes, but if my laundry bill
rises, the Hansen family will be
worse off.
I have never seen a laundro
mat where users are charged a
flat fee and allowed to use the
machines as much as they can for
a set time, and so I'm naturally
reluctant to think this will im
prove the laundry problem. Just
like Ratul Narain who was quot
ed in the story, 1 also hate bro
ken washers, dryers, and change
machines, but the fixed-fee pric
ing strategy is not the way to go
about fixing broke-ass laundry
machines.
Stanford should purchase the
machines, perform basic up-keep
on the facilities, and keep the same
price per load scheme. If $1 per
load isn't enough to cover these
costs, simply raise the rate. But
don't make fresh-smelling stu
dents like myself subsidize other

students to do their laundry.

Flat laundry fee not a 'win for
cost of Iving campaign'
While ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli and other members
of the ASSU feel that the new $28
flat laundry fee is "a major win
for cost-of-living issues on cam
pus," I'd like to say that I feel oth
erwise.
It's already ridiculous that the
price to wash (or dry) a load of
laundry rose from $0.75 to $ 1 just
this past year. To now answer stu
dent complaints of broken ma
chines and non-functional change
machines with a universally ap
plied $28 fee is completely illogi
cal. Why don't we just fix the
change machines and make sure
the washers and dryers that we
have are functional and avoid ap
plying semi-communist ideals to
our laundry fees?
The $28 cost is arbitrary, if
nothing else, and unfair to those
that don't need to do 14 loads of
laundry every quarter. Further
more, for many individuals who
line-dry, this $28 fee indicates they
will have to do 28 loads of laundry
in order to be getting their
money's worth.
fhe ASSU should take serious
ly the concerns that its own cost of
living director expressed: "the
lack of student involvement in the
decision-making process to con
vert to a new laundry initiative." I
agree that doing laundry can be
an atrocious experience at Stan
ford, but I don't think making it
more expensive for the majority of
students is any great accomplish
ment.
