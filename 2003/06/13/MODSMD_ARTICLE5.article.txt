# SAYING THANKS
## MEGAN KNIZE 
### 
The foflowing columns represent the final words of the seniors who have worked for The Daily for one or more /oars.

In the Sophomore College class,
"Ethics and Empire," that I took
three years ago, my professor spent a
fair amount of time dispensing ad
vice — but since college students are often
inundated with tips from well-meaning
friends and parents, there was good rea
son to also allow his words to go in one ear
and out the other.
However, during my two-week
course, which focused on U.S. foreign
policy in Latin America, Religious Stud
ies Prof. Tom Sheehan shared words of
wisdom that I have never forgotten. He
told us that while at Stanford, we stu
dents are "on loan" from our communi
ties. When we are finished, we have an
obligation to share our privilege — our
Stanford education — with the people
who stayed behind.

It is this responsibility to repay the com
munities from which we came that I wish
to address in the final Stanford Daily piece
of my college career.
From the minute I moved into my
freshman dorm, it became clear that my
next four years would be dramatically dif
ferent from anything I had ever experi
enced. Because I came from a fairly small
town in California's Central Valley, my
classmates comprised the most diverse
group of people I had ever seen.
Throughout my four years here, the
Class of 2003 has impressed me constantly
— whether they are founding an Internet
company or business, working in cutting
edge research, or staying up late every
night to put out this newspaper, there's
some serious talent and passion in our
class. The question for us now is how best

to use it.
Amid the relief and excitement of
graduation, it may seem unnecessary,
maybe even silly, to suggest that my class
mates take time now to say thanks to
more than just their families. The chil
dren we tutored in high school, the
teachers who prepared us for exams and
the coaches who encouraged a strong
work ethic — they all know we appreci
ate them, right? Maybe not.
Whether by a personal visit or simply
an e-mail, this summer is the time to show
your gratitude. Prof. Sheehan spoke of
another level of giving back to the com
munity, however. I understood his advice
to mean finding ways to use a Stanford ed
ucation to the betterment of the commu
nity as a whole. Mentoring a younger stu
dent, speaking at your high school or vol

unteering with a local aid organization are
all simple, direct ways to show we've
learned more than how to study, party
and work hard at Stanford. We've learned
compassion.
I have seen tremendous empathy and
courage from my fellow students these
past four years. Whether they were
protesting a living wage for janitors, seek
ing more student involvement in the Uni
versity's Alcohol Policy or questioning
Stanford's choice of campus speakers. I
am confident such examples will be car
ried out many times over away from the
Farm.
As I write this, I think about my own
experiences giving back to my home
town in California's Central Valley.
There's still more I want to do, like try
ing to share more enlightened perspec

tives with my fellow citizens and increas
ing tolerance among people in my com
munity. These efforts can be frustrating,
but Stanford has given me a good start.
While I am eager to plunge ahead and
fulfill all those dreams of fame and for
tune, dreams that will likely be realized
in big cities, I cannot forget the commu
nity that helped me get here.
To the people in my hometown who
cheered me on and inspired me, thanks.
Your advice — even if unsolicited — is al
ways appreciated.
