# THE

££ 112 ■ he war on terrorism is not a
war on Islam." You've
probably heard this state-
JL ment at least a dozen times
from Bush administration officials since 9/11.
Fora while, I actually bought it.
But then came die thousands of Muslims
— with no connection to terrorism — un
justly detained, the hundreds of hate crimes
against Muslims, the raids on Muslim chari
ties, and the U.S.-led wars against two Mus
lim countries. Rev. Franklin Graham — the
man who delivered the invocation at
George VV.'s inauguration — even called
Islam a "very evil and wicked religion." If all
that wasn't enough, President Bush recent
ly nominated anti-Muslim bigot Daniel
Pipes to the United States Institute of Peace.
If Bush's "war on terrorism" is truly an
effective war on terrorism, then why have
CIA experts stated that the threat from al-
Qaida has increased since the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq? I certainly haven't

felt safer since 9/11. Not only lam scared
that Osama bin Laden's cronies are plan
ning another attack, but I'm also fright
ened that an American terrorist might
blow up my mosque.
So President Bush, stop pretending.
The war on terrorism is a war on Islam. Ac
tually, that's not entirely correct. The war
on terrorism has been a war on practically
everything I support: Muslims, the Bill of
Rights, and even my family.
In the weeks following 9/11, the FBI vis
ited both my parents in Kansas and my
brother in New York City. Why? All the
FBI agents knew were that we had brown
skin, and our last name was Ahmed — like
millions of other Muslims throughout the
world. They saw some baby pictures of my
brother and me, and left us alone. The
FBI visits were my first inclinations that
the war on terrorism was off to a rocky
start. If the FBI was spending its precious
time interrogating families like mine

(whose combined criminal record is a
handful of unpaid parking tickets), who
was going after the real criminals?
My family's post-9/11 harassment
didn't end with the FBI visits. A few weeks
later, a couple of New York City firefight
ers threatened to kill my brother. He was
also kicked off an airplane last year. I've
had my own problems with airport securi
ty. In November 2001, when I was flying
from my hometown of Kansas City to
Washington, D.C. to continue my intern
ship at the State Department, the check-in
agents refused to give me a boarding pass
because they didn't believe I worked for
the U.S. government.
But my family's experiences pale in
comparison to some other Muslim-Ameri
cans. Take my friend Abdullah, for exam
ple. Before 9/11, Abdullah's uncle was con
fined in a Florida jail for three and a half
years. While the U.S. government claimed
that he supported terrorism, he was never

charged with a crime and finally released
by then-Attorney General Janet Reno. But
after 9/11, the John Ashcroft-led Depart
ment of Justice rearrested him, again
showing no evidence, and ultimately de
ported him fora minor visa violation.
According to the Sixth Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution, any accused indi
vidual must "be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation." But I think
the Bush administration conveniently for
gets about the Bill of Rights when dealing
with Abdullah's family.
His father's case is even more frighten
ing. Abdullah's father is currently being
held in solitary confinement in the maxi
mum-security wing of a federal peniten
tiary— a place that usually holds mur
ders, rapists and other hardcore criminals.
The problem is that he has never been
convicted of a crime. Although he is cur
rently charged with supporting terrorism,
he has been denied his Sixth Amendment

right to a speedy trial, his Eighth Amend
ment right protecting him from cruel and
unusual punishments, and his Fifth
Amendment right of due process.
If the American government doesn't
care about its own laws and values, then
what is the point of being an American?
President Bush, I can take a hint. You
really don't want me here. So I'm taking
my Stanford diploma and leaving. I'm
going to spend the next year in Egypt, and
when I return I hope this nightmare of an
American presidency is over. Basically, my
future rests in the hands of Howard Dean,
John Kerry, John Edwards, Joe Lieber
man, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham or A1
Sharpton. Yeah, I'm scared. Really scared.

Sameer Ahmed, graduating in international re
lations, was The Daily's editor in chief this fall.
He'd like to thank his family and the guys and
gal of 1774-preferred for all their love and sup
port these past four years.
