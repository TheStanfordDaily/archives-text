# THE
						MAJOR IN PUBLICATIONS

Now that he's finally graduating,
this classifieds productionist
can exhale and note what a
close call that graduation was.
The reason: my third major, what Daily
Editor in Chief Megan Knize calls "the
major in publications." The Storke publi
cations department got its hooks into me
freshman year, with Stanford Daily and
Stanford Chaparral writing. Chappie in
volvement grew pretty much exponential
ly over the next three years, and Daily
work rose to three years of Classifieds lay

out and the 2001-2002 ASSU beat.
That's a pretty goddamn boring para
graph. Transcripts always are. For the
above, and not my GPA or academic pa
pers, is what I view as my Stanford body of
work, along with the friendships, ideas and
knowledge gained here. (Yes, my profs, the
latter two were successfully absorbed,
though not expressed in my typically inco
herent papers written after layout week
ends or between covering the never-ending
2002 ASSU presidential election).
They say that only engineering majors
are trained well enough here to work in
the real world sans postgraduate degree.
Lies. The major in publications is the best
crash course in writing and layout one will
ever get. You think your teachers are
tough on your writing? Try submitting a
piece to some of the past Chappie editors.
Be forced to write a good, complete article

before deadline or else your Daily editors
— your friends and peers — have to wait
for you to fix it after they've already
worked an eight-hour day. Realize that
your work will eventually be bound and
archived at your publication's office, and
every shoddy piece or layout you pro
duced will be accessible to Stanford stu
dents until the end of time.
The last, however, provides perhaps
one of the most satisfying reasons to de
clare publications. At the risk of sounding
like Henry V on St. Crispin's Day or a
Daily columnist, our I-Hum papers won't
be read by anyone in 100 years, but curi
ous Daily and Chappie staffers will still
continue to flip through back issues to
which we've contributed.
Another benefit to majoring in publica
tions is obviously (and foremost) the peo
ple.

This is no doubt partially due to the
final benefit of publications, or at least
newspapers and humor magazines. From
reporting, you'll learn to see all sides of a
story (hopefully). From humor writing,
you'll learn to laugh at all of them. In the
academic world, as well as the "I'll die-be
fore-admitting-I-was-wrong" mindset of
many Stanford students, such objective
scorn is not often welcome. In the real
world, it tends to make you a more toler
ant and more agreeable human being.
I'm writing this to perhaps rationalize
to myself and my parents the devolution of
John Huetter from Mr. Academia to the
unshaven guy staggering out of Storke at
midnight. Ma and Pa Huetter are about as
eager to read coverage of 2001-2002
ASSU policy debates as you guys were (this
actually speaks highly of them). None of
my classifieds fake ads or bunny jokes are

posted online, so they don't see those.
Mom politely pretends to read my Chap
pie pieces, but she actually just scans them
for profanity. Dad will simply ask, "You
still working for that smutty magazine?"
and then reminds himself that the other
son is majoring in computer science and
can subsidize parental retirement.
On the odier hand, now that they're
here, I can take them to that ratty (literally,
at times) old building on Santa Teresa and
pull out four years of Daily and Chappie
back issues — together, 12 volumes of
work. Hopefully, that Stanford transcript
will even out my official transcript for them
as much as it has for me. And if not, well, I'll
show them the Storke liquor supply.

John Huetter is graduating in communication
and archaeology. "Yo Stanford? What? We
outta here!"
