# THE SECRET OF LISTENING
## LUIS ADAIME 
### 
Finally, my moment of glory has ar
rived: I get to write 600 words in
The Daily about anything I want!
Instead of criticizing the school for
banning parties, or complaining about
cafeteria food, I thought that, for this first
and last column, I would give some piece
of advice to those of you who are staying.
So, here it goes. The way I got through
Stanford, the lesson I took (which has
been much more important than learning
about Present Value), or how to do my
laundry: The secret is to listen to the peo
ple no one listens to, and to try the things
they suggest. It may seem paradoxical, but
it paves the way for some crazy four years
(and it keeps you sane).
For example, do any graduating se

niors remember then-President Gerhard
Casper's address during our Orientation?
Of course not. Don't worry, neither do I.
But there was one senior girl, I forget her
name now, who after introducing Casper
(and delivering all that "Stanford is great"
mumbo-jumbo) told us that the one thing
we should do before we graduate is hike to
the Dish. I'm sure you don't remember
her either, but you have to agree that it
sounds pretty odd. Of all the things to sug
gest to an incoming class, a parting senior
simply says: "Walk to the Dish."
Pretty nuts, right? She said that we
wouldn't understand it then, but that we
would eventually find out how important
it is to be alone at Stanford, to be able to
collect your thoughts and ponder. But I

had already been on the Dish tour during
Admit Weekend, and besides some psycho
joggers running up and down that hill, I
did not find it particularly special. So I dis
missed her as a crazy nerd who had stud
ied too much, took her suggestion as yet
another a-bit-too-sweet Orientation
speech, and proceeded to drink heavily
with my dormmates.
Funny thing though: the "walk to the
Dish" speech was so strange, that it stuck in
my mind. And one day, after my room
mate had taken my toothpaste for the 11 th
time and "sexiled" me for the fifth, I de
cided to take the girl's advice and go on
that walk. Much to my surprise, it worked
wonders! Walking to the Dish is much bet
ter than watching TV (because no one can

come and bother you), much better than
running (because the pace is more con
ducive for thought) and it is infinitely bet
ter than studying or drinking (because it
forces you to deal with whatever is driving
you nuts).
And it has yet another plus: It takes you
very far from your incredibly annoying,
mooch of a roommate, thus preventing
you from punching him in the face.
So this is how I became an addicted
"Dish walker" and how I began to pay at
tention to ideas that initially sounded silly
to me: Dean Kinally's prophecy that we all
fall in love at Stanford (I never thought it
would happen to me), my RA's advice to
run to be the Tree (who would ever listen
to an RA who is part of the Stanford

Band?) and many other ideas that surpris
ingly proved to make a world of difference
during these four years.
My final crazy advice? To the young
ones: Listen to the dorky people around
you (there are plenty of them), and don't
be afraid to do what they suggest. Seniors:
No time left to change your Stanford ca
reers, but if your roommate is driving you
crazy with his packing, you already know
what to do . ..
