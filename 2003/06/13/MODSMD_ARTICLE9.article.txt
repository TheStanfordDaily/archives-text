I I double A Three rep-
I resentin' to the end!"
J were some of the first and
fondest words I remember from my first
month here on the Farm. I would spend
that year living in Ujamaa (commonly
called "Uj"), a place where I would meet
Stanford students from a variety of cultur
al and socioeconomic backgrounds. In Uj
I would spend countless nights staying up
late talking with my friends in the hall
ways, sitting in the halls while Damon,
Allen and Matt freestyled (Damon would
ask us to throw out a topic and the guys
would freestyle on that topic) and pulling
numerous all-nighters preparing for an
exam or typing a paper.

Freshman year I had no idea what was
ahead of me. I thought that I would make
a few friends, get a great education and
graduate, leaving Stanford behind and
looking forward to my next phase of life.
And for the most part, I have. But I
didn't realize that Stanford was where I
would cultivate my closest and most re
warding friendships. I didn't know that I
would develop a more sophisticated per
spective and deeper insight on social is
sues. I didn't know that I would experi
ence such dynamic growth here, challeng
ing my mind, heart and spirit, delving
deep within my soul, pushing myself to be
come a more astute and enlightened
human being.
To the dynamic Class of 2003, con

gratulations! We've accomplished what
many only dream of attaining. We have a
lot to do and I'm confident we can ac
complish God's will for our lives and be a
blessing to others if we continue to press
on. As Peter wrote in his letter to the
Philippians, "I do not count myself to
have apprehended; but one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind
and reaching forward to those things
which are ahead, I press toward the goal
for the prize of the upward call of God in
Christ Jesus" (NIV).
Special thanks to my sisters. Kia and
Stephanie — you have been my sisters
and my girls from my first few months
on the Farm. I love you both so much
and I pray that we remain this close for

the remainder of our days on this earth.
You both embody what love really is,
and I'm glad to have known love and
friendship at such heights because of
you. "Ain't no ocean ain't no see, machi
dada, keep my sister 'way from me,
machidada, me and you must us never
part, machidada, me and you us have
one heart, machidada." Christallyn —
I'm so glad to have come to know you
better over these years. You were always
there when I needed your advice and
consolation. Thanks for helping me to
realize a part of God's plan for my life,
famila, Iquo, Danielle Willis, Jade,
Anna, GeAndra, Eva, Melynda, Aja,
Rahiel and Katrina, I love you all and
I'm going to miss you very much. Keep

in touch!
Thank you mom and dad for support
ing me all my life! Even though I'll be away
from home fora little while, I'll be back.
I'm forever indebted to you (but y'all know
that already!). Love you always. Nicole and
Jessica! You're the best sisters ever!
You're my heart and I hope to always be
there any time you need me for anything.
Don't forget that your big sister loves you
no matter what.
And now Stanford University I bid you
farewell. It's been real.
