### ILENA GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
This summer, the Cantor Arts
Center is running a new exhibit en
titled "The Changing Garden:
Four Centuries of European and
American Art," which features de
pictions of gardens by artists from a
variety of artistic disciplines.
"I wanted to start with recogniz
able images of places," said Betsy
Fryberger, the exhibition's curator
and the Cantor Center's curator of
prints and drawings.
She added that of the nearly 200
works in the exhibition, most are of
familiar American and European
places.
According to Fryberger, the ex
hibition has multiple sources of in
spiration and has been in the works
for about five years.

"I saw two exhibitions a long
time ago ... one was at the Nation
al Gallery in Washington," she
said. "It was called 'Gardens on
Paper.' In San Francisco, at the Le
gion of Honor, I saw an exhibition
about a garden in France that com
pared contemporary photographs
to historical prints and I thought
that was a very interesting idea in
trying to trace the evolution of a
garden. Then I began looking
more seriously at museum collec
tions."
One of the highlights of the ex
hibition is an interdisciplinary look
at France's Versaille. Included are
drawings of the gardens, as well as
more contemporary photographs
that explore how the famous site
looks today.
Villa d'Este in Tivoli, Italy, is
also featured through old draw

ings and plans contrasted with
more recent pictures.
"What we're trying to do is show
how [some gardens] change, and
how [others] have survived without
many changes," Fryberger said.
"Some of the gardens in the
show don't exist anymore," she
added.
The exhibition consists of
three parts â€” "Designing Gar
dens," which explores different
features of the design of gardens,
"Historic Gardens," which exam
ines a variety of famous gardens
through history and "Garden
Gatherings," which shows the dif
ferent activities people can do
while in a garden.
According to Fryberger, several
parks can be found in the "Historic
Gardens" section, featuring fa
mous locales such as New York

City's Central Park and the Lux
embourg Gardens of Paris.
She explained that public gar
dens and parks were once an im
portant social arena, where it was
fashionable to see and be seen. The
exhibition includes serious depic
tions of this activity, as well as sev
eral caricatures.
"[Later] artists like John Sloan
and George Bellows, members of
the so-called Ashcan School' were
interested in the working class"
Fryberger said. "One of my sur
prises was how few prints there are
of workers.
"When early views were taken,
they were often commissioned by
someone who was showing off his
garden at the best, so you didn't
necessarily include workers. But
there are a couple of images that
include workers. You can see there

is a lot of work and a lot of attention
to detail," Fryberger added.
Accompanying the exhibition, a
new garden, designed by aitist
Meg Webster, will open across the
street from the Cantor Center.
It will feature over a hundred
different varieties of native plants
and is to be a permanent addition
to campus. The garden includes
several benches enclosed
berms around the focal point o
the garden.
"She was picked as a sculptor,
not as a landscape designer, Fiy
berger said. "She wanted to ma *e
the garden very educational anc
she wanted to make it enviion
mentally practical."
The exhibition will be on caITI "
pus until Sept. 7, after which it wi
tour several cities across the Unitec
States until May 2004.
