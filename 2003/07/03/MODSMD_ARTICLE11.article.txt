## Summer provides opportunity to burst the bubble 
### 
A friend in the newsroom asked me
recently when I was last away from
Stanford for more than a month.
The answer? The summer of 1998, just
after I graduated from high school.
That might seem strange, even bor
dering on unhealthy. But there is some
thing in these 8,180 acres that — much to
my parents' dismay — often makes me
refer to Stanford as Home. And I'm only
slightly embarrassed to admit that Stan
ford is truly my first love: the place that
has been a constant support to me, that I
attribute many of my successes and good
qualities to and whose faults I often wish
I had the power to change.
When graduation neared last year and
I was deciding where to pursue my doc
toral studies, almost everyone I polled for
advice said the same thing: "Isn't it time
for you to go somewhere new?"
It wasn't.
And it still isn't.
Despite the undeniable social and in
tellectual excitement of the academic
year, each of the last four summers I have
spent on the Farm has been just as mem
orable. Stanford summers are usually as
full of loneliness and reflection as the rest
of year is of socializing and schoolwork.
Yet the summer is also when the infa
mous bubble bursts and the outside

world suddenly seems to find its way into
the halls of the Quad and late-night con
versations.
In many ways, the summer dissipates
the University's "Ivory Tower" aura.
Amidst our concerns about textbook
prices, tuition and equity in the tenure
process, we often forget that Stanford is
part of a world that is in a period of
marked unrest.
I witnessed this during the summer of
2001, when I was working on campus as
the head orientation coordinator. I
stayed up late the night of Sept. 10 de
signing a T-shirt for our orientation vol
unteers. The next morning, I turned on
the news expecting to hear that it was
going to be another sunny day in Palo
Alto. Stanford was one of the few univer
sities in the country not in session on
Sept. 11 2001 and, for the first time, I saw
the Stanford community — from the
President's Office to the undergraduates
in Sophomore College — shaken to the
core.
But the summer also confirms Stan
ford's resiliency, its ability to move for
ward from problems like living wage de
bates, hate crimes and the need to com
plete construction before throngs of new
students arrive down Palm Drive. In
keeping with this, New Student Orienta

tion 2001 offered a warm welcome and
highlighted, when it was of the utmost
importance, what a strong community
the Farm offers to its members. Stanford
itself may not be impregnable, but it is the
most tightly-knit population I have ever
known.
In the summer, this world where
everyone is separated by two degrees be
comes even smaller, ottering chances to
strengthen friendships and deepen intro
spection. Every summer some of out
most talented students stay on campus to
work and do research. A handful of these
also find time to contribute to The Week
ly and it is my pleasure to be working with
them for the next nine weeks.
If you are a new or returning member
of the Stanford family, or a current stu
dent who has — unlike myself—left
Palo Alto for the summer and is checking
www.stanforddaily.com, we welcome
your input to the Weekly. For communi
ty members arriving on campus to join
conferences and athletic camps, our goal
is to introduce you to our university's cul
ture and for you to use this paper as a
gateway to uncovering the many re
sources available at Stanford.
We hope to teach you more about the
Stanford community through insightful
news coverage and op-ed columns.

Sports will help you follow Cardinal stu
dent-athletes about to embark on profes
sional careers. Entertainment will guide
you to the best summer movies and
music, because everyone needs a break
from the Farm once in a while.
To my fellow students, take this sum
mer as the chance to both leave your
mark here and reflect on how far you
have come since your arrival. And as you
go through this process of evolution that
is inevitable during a summer on the
Farm, notice that The Daily is going
through it with you by evolving into the
Weekly to reflect those lazy summer days
that lie ahead.
Welcome to another beautiful Penin
sula summer. Look for us in newsstands
on Thursday's.

Sports will help you follow Cardinal stu
dent-athletes about to embark on profes
sional careers. Entertainment will guide
you to the best summer movies and
music, because everyone needs a break
from the Farm once in a while.
To my fellow students, take this sum
mer as the chance to both leave your
mark here and reflect on how far you
have come since your arrival. And as you
go through this process of evolution that
is inevitable during a summer on the
Farm, notice that The Daily is going
through it with you by evolving into the
Weekly to reflect those lazy summer days
that lie ahead.
Welcome to another beautiful Penin
sula summer. Look for us in newsstands
on Thursday's.
