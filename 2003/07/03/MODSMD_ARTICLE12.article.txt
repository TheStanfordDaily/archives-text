# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Newsroom rookie experiences stresses of daily paper 
### CYNTHIA CHO STAFF WRITER 
Procrastination has defined my academic
career. I can't remember ever studying for
an exam days in advance. In high school, it
was customary for me to print out a paper,
which I had been working on all night, at
7:00 a.m., minutes before leaving for school.
When I came to Stanford, I was determined
to change all that, but I failed three weeks
into my freshman year.
I know procrastination is bad ... or is it?
My mom always tells me that when I pro
crastinate and try to finish an assignment at
the last minute, I won't produce my best work.
In response I say, "I work best under pres
sure," and"I thrive on deadlines." At first, I
came up with these excuses to get my mom off
my back. Then, I began to realize that I do, in
fact, work best when I am in a bind.
But last week, I had the terrible feeling
that maybe I was wrong.
At 11:00 p.m. on June 23, surrounded by
pages of notes from interviews and research,
I sat at my desk and stared blankly at my lap
top screen. I fiddled around with sentence
after sentence to construct the perfect lede
(the opening sentence) for my first article in
the San Jose Mercury News, where I am in
terning as a reporter this summer.

I knew what I needed to write about. I
even had the article organized, paragraph by
paragraph, in my head: lede, body — in
cluding a description of the dance, informa
tion about the performance and profiles of
the artists — and conclusion. Easy? Riiiiight.
I went to bed at 12:30 a.m. with only the lede
sentence written, and I wasn't happy with it.
At 10:00 the next morning, I was back in
front of a computer, this time in my cubicle at
the Mercury News. I had two hours to submit
an article that wouldn't have my editor think
ing, "Why did we hire this girl?" I began at
square one: the lede. I had a few ideas and e
mailed them to my mentor, a veteran re
porter at the newspaper. While he gave me
some useful feedback, the last sentence of his
e-mail read: "Follow your gut, that's impor
tant." So it was going to be up to me.
I started writing and quickly realized that
I was not going to finish by noon. Asking for
an extension on a deadline for my very first
article wasn't ideal, but I had no choice.
Scared and nervous, I walked over to my ed
itor's desk and asked for one extra hour. For
tunately, he agreed.
Back at my computer, I wrote and wrote.
I verified facts and the spelling of names. I
checked for proper grammar and sentence
structure. I made sure that the story was
clearly organized. While I have written nu

merous articles for my high school newspa
per and The Daily, the kind of pressure that
I felt as I was writing my article for the Mer
cury News was completely new. (The fact
that hundreds of thousands of readers
would potentially read my article might have
had something to do with it.)
I finally filed my story at 1:15 p.m. My ed
itor didn't give me a hard time about my tar
diness, but I was disappointed that I couldn't
stick to one of the most important rules of
journalism: meeting deadline.
That's when I began to think that maybe
I didn't work so well under pressure — and
if that were the case, I should start consider
ing other career options. So what if I had
spent the past six years slaving away at stu
dent newspapers? Better get out when I still
have time to find something new, I thought.
Just then, I got another message from my
editor. It read, "Welcome to the joys of daily
newspapering. Your heart races, your palms
sweat, your breathing gets shallow, your
pupils pin. Ain't it great?" He couldn't have
been more right. That is exactly how I felt.
Writing was nerve-wracking, but exhilarat
ing too. And that's when I knew that every
thing was going to be OK.
My editor and I went over my article to
gether. There were a few things that needed
to be fixed but, for the most part, the article

was fine. My mentor — who gives me advice
on everything from my writing style ("You
use words that some editors would consider
excess.") to office behavior ("You're too
cheery." He was joking, I think) — also told
me that he liked the story. Their comments
reassured me that I didn't have to give up on
journalism just yet.
I've never taken a journalism course so I
consider this summer internship a crash
course in journalism. And it just so happens
that I am learning from some of the most ex
perienced and accomplished people in the
field, in the best classroom in the world —
the newsroom.
The life of a journalist is anything but
glamorous. The hours can be long and the
pay isn't great. But the journalists that I work
with every day love what they do. Watching
and learning from them, I can't imagine
doing anything else myself.
So, to answer the question my editor asked
me — "Ain't it great?" — the answer is yes.

newspapering. Your heart races, your palms
sweat, your breathing gets shallow, your
pupils pin. Ain't it great?" He couldn't have
been more right. That is exactly how I felt.
Writing was nerve-wracking, but exhilarat
ing too. And that's when I knew that every
thing was going to be OK.
My editor and I went over my article to
gether. There were a few things that needed
to be fixed but, for the most part, the article

was fine. My mentor — who gives me advice
on everything from my writing style ("You
use words that some editors would consider
excess.") to office behavior ("You're too
cheery." He was joking, I think) — also told
me that he liked the story. Their comments
reassured me that I didn't have to give up on
journalism just yet.
I've never taken a journalism course so I
consider this summer internship a crash
course in journalism. And it just so happens
that I am learning from some of the most ex
perienced and accomplished people in the
field, in the best classroom in the world —
the newsroom.
The life of a journalist is anything but
glamorous. The hours can be long and the
pay isn't great. But the journalists that I work
with every day love what they do. Watching
and learning from them, I can't imagine
doing anything else myself.
So, to answer the question my editor asked
me — "Ain't it great?" — the answer is yes.

Procrastination has defined my academic
career. I can't remember ever studying for
an exam days in advance. In high school, it
was customary for me to print out a paper,
which I had been working on all night, at
7:00 a.m., minutes before leaving for school.
When I came to Stanford, I was determined
to change all that, but I failed three weeks
into my freshman year.
I know procrastination is bad ... or is it?
My mom always tells me that when I pro
crastinate and try to finish an assignment at
the last minute, I won't produce my best work.
In response I say, "I work best under pres
sure," and"I thrive on deadlines." At first, I
came up with these excuses to get my mom off
my back. Then, I began to realize that I do, in
fact, work best when I am in a bind.
But last week, I had the terrible feeling
that maybe I was wrong.
At 11:00 p.m. on June 23, surrounded by
pages of notes from interviews and research,
I sat at my desk and stared blankly at my lap
top screen. I fiddled around with sentence
after sentence to construct the perfect lede
(the opening sentence) for my first article in
the San Jose Mercury News, where I am in
terning as a reporter this summer.

I knew what I needed to write about. I
even had the article organized, paragraph by
paragraph, in my head: lede, body — in
cluding a description of the dance, informa
tion about the performance and profiles of
the artists — and conclusion. Easy? Riiiiight.
I went to bed at 12:30 a.m. with only the lede
sentence written, and I wasn't happy with it.
At 10:00 the next morning, I was back in
front of a computer, this time in my cubicle at
the Mercury News. I had two hours to submit
an article that wouldn't have my editor think
ing, "Why did we hire this girl?" I began at
square one: the lede. I had a few ideas and e
mailed them to my mentor, a veteran re
porter at the newspaper. While he gave me
some useful feedback, the last sentence of his
e-mail read: "Follow your gut, that's impor
tant." So it was going to be up to me.
I started writing and quickly realized that
I was not going to finish by noon. Asking for
an extension on a deadline for my very first
article wasn't ideal, but I had no choice.
Scared and nervous, I walked over to my ed
itor's desk and asked for one extra hour. For
tunately, he agreed.
Back at my computer, I wrote and wrote.
I verified facts and the spelling of names. I
checked for proper grammar and sentence
structure. I made sure that the story was
clearly organized. While I have written nu

merous articles for my high school newspa
per and The Daily, the kind of pressure that
I felt as I was writing my article for the Mer
cury News was completely new. (The fact
that hundreds of thousands of readers
would potentially read my article might have
had something to do with it.)
I finally filed my story at 1:15 p.m. My ed
itor didn't give me a hard time about my tar
diness, but I was disappointed that I couldn't
stick to one of the most important rules of
journalism: meeting deadline.
That's when I began to think that maybe
I didn't work so well under pressure — and
if that were the case, I should start consider
ing other career options. So what if I had
spent the past six years slaving away at stu
dent newspapers? Better get out when I still
have time to find something new, I thought.
Just then, I got another message from my
editor. It read, "Welcome to the joys of daily
newspapering. Your heart races, your palms
sweat, your breathing gets shallow, your
pupils pin. Ain't it great?" He couldn't have
been more right. That is exactly how I felt.
