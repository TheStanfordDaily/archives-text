## Stanford takes prestigious Director's Cup Unmatched success 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the ninth consecutive
year, Stanford can celebrate the
fact that it possesses the top ath
letic program in the country.
Stanford extended its decade
long dominance on Division I
NCAA athletics by winning the
2002-2003 Director's Cup,
awarded by the National Associ
ate of Collegiate Directors of Ath
letics (NACDA). Previously
known as the Sears Cup, the
award honors the top collegiate
athletic program in the nation in
each division.
.After the results from spring
sports such as baseball, track and
field and tennis were tabulated,
the Cardinal finished with a total
of 1420.5 points, while second
place Texas ended the year with
1094 points. Ohio State (1074.8
points), Michigan (1034.3) and
Penn State (993) rounded out the
top five in the standings.
Stanford was propelled to the
top of the race for points early in
the year by national titles in
men's water polo and cross coun
try in the fall season and never
looked back, holding onto the
lead through June 26, when the
final results were announced by
the NACDA. .Although the Cardi
nal only brought home two na
tional titles during the 2002-2003
season versus the four champi
onships secured one year ago,
Stanford took second place in
numerous sports — women's vol
leyball, men's soccer, women's
cross country, synchronized
swimming, women's tennis,

women's water polo and base
ball. This, when coupled with
the fact that the Cardinal fin
ished in the top-10 of 24 differ
ent sports, explains why another
trophy will be lining the Cardi
nal's coffers.
The Director's Cup solidifies
the unparalleled dichotomy pre
sent on the Farm. While many
schools can offer either a top
athletic or academic program,
Stanford presents a rare envi
ronment in which both spheres
are preeminent in the nation.
Furthermore, the format of
the award highlights the diver
sity of sports that is present on
campus as well as the gender
equality in athletics on the
Farm. Points are gathered from
a school's performance in ten
women's sports and ten men's
sports ranging from football
and track to lacrosse and ice
hockey.
Besides the prestige associat
ed with the award, Stanford can
now add another $35,000 Wa
terford crystal trophy — the tra
ditional Director's Cup award
— to its already overflowing tro
phy room at the Arrillaga Fami
ly Sports Center. In addition,
the Cardinal will also receive
one postgraduate scholarship
worth $5,000 for winning the
Director's Cup and two post
graduate scholarships valued at
$1,000 each for the national
championships won in men's
water polo and cross country.
Most importantly, however,
Cardinal faithful have 12 more
months to bask in the warm
glow of athletic superiority.
