Cardinal catcher honored with Bench Award
Stanford senior Ryan Garko was awarded the Johnny
Bench Award as the nation's top catcher. Garko excelled
both during the year and in postseason play, as he led the
Cardinal to within one win of the national championship
in Omaha. The decorated catcher — who was a First
Team All-American and All-College World Series selec
tion — was also named Co-Pac-10 Player of the Year with
fellow Cardinal pitcher John Hudgins. Garko concluded
his career on the Farm with a remarkable senior effort, in
which he batted .402 became only the sixth Cardinal bat
ter to ever hit above .400 in a season and tied the Stan
ford single-season RBI record with 92. The catcher, who
was a third-round selection in the MLB draft (Cleveland),
will now look to a career in professional baseball.

Stanford gymnasts to compete at Pan Am Games
The Cardinal will be well represented on the men's gym
nastics squad at the Pan American Games, which will be
held August 1-17 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Repub
lic. David Durante and Dan Gill will compete in the
games, while Stanford coach Thorn Glielmi will lead the
squad at the Games. Durante, who recently graduated,
placed ninth in the all-around competition at the U.S.
Gymnastics Championships in order to earn a spot on the
team, while Gill finished eleventh.
Freshman Liu named National Player of the Year
A month after impressively capturing the singles individ
ual tennis title at the NCAA championships as a freshman,
Cardinal swinger Amber Liu was named the National

Player of the Year by the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion. Liu, the No. 1 singles competitor for Stanford in her
first year of collegiate competition, anchored the Cardinal
tennis attack as a freshman and led the team to the NCAA
finals, where it was defeated by the University of Florida.
Nonetheless, she fought through a tough field to capture
the individual tournament with a tough 7-6 (5), 6-2 win
over top-ranked Vilmarie Castellvi of Tennessee. For her
efforts Liu was also named ITA Freshman of the Year.
