# The 						Road Through Omaha
## Stanford versus South Carolina 
### 
OMAHA — The Cardinal seemed on
cruise control in its first College World Se
ries game on June 13, taking a smooth 8-0
victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks
to open the action in Omaha.

Not once did a Stanford fan have cause
to move even an inch toward the edge of
his seat. The Cardinal grabbed control of
the game in the first inning and never let
go, thanks in large part to junior John
Hudgins.
Hudgins threw a masterpiece in the first
game of the Cardinal's Super Regional
against Long Beach and appeared to be in
similar form on Friday. He retired the
Gamecocks' side in the top of the first in
ning with six pitches.
Gamecocks starter David Marchbanks
was not so fortunate.
Marchbanks gave up two runs in the
bottom of the first with a single from Stan
ford senior Ryan Garko, who has been an
RBI machine all season.
This is Garko's fourth CWS appearance,
and the seasoned veteran has typically
been a clutch hitter in the postseason.
"There's a heightened awareness here,
and I think I feed off of that," Garko said.
South Carolina's Kevin Melillo managed
the first hard-hit ball off Hudgins in the top
of the second, a line drive to right center
that seemed sure to be an easy stand-up
double.
Junior Carlos Quentin, however,
robbed Melillo with a web-gem level tum
bling catch that seemed like a bad omen for
the Gamecocks.
With a 4-0 lead at the end of the second,
Hudgins had some early breathing room,
but didn't use a bit of it.
Hudgins threw a total of eight innings,
giving up no runs and just two hits. The
Cardinal ace could easily have finished the
game for what would have been the first
complete-game shutout in the CWS since
1994.
However, head coach Mark Marquess
brought in freshman reliever Kodiak
Quick to close the game. Quick tossed a
scoreless ninth inning and Hudgins exited
the game after only 84 pitches, leaving his
arm available for further use later in the
week.
"This isn't a one-game tournament,"
said Hudgins, who appeared not the least
bit perturbed about leaving the game. "It
isn't about individuals or anything like
that; it's about winning ballgames."
Stanford junior Sam Fuld went 3-for-4,
junior Jonny Ash drove in two runs and
freshman Jed Lowrie and sophomore
Danny Putnam each had drove in one in
the Cardinal victory.

OMAHA — Elimination Tuesday in
Omaha means go big or go home — liter
ally. The two losing teams have to hit the
barbecue and then the road, and the Car
dinal was determined to not be one of them
onjune 17.
Having suffered a bitterly close defeat to

Cal State Fullerton on Monday and with
their season on the line, it was easy money
to bet on the Cardinal bats producing a
high run tally. The only question was
whether the South Carolina Gamecocks -
in the same do-or-die situation - would
have the firepower to keep up.
Stanford's starting pitcher, senior Ryan
McCally, and the defense behind him an
swered that question with a stellar com
bined effort and the Cardinal stayed alive
in the CWS with a 13-6 victory.
"I was pleased with the offense, but the
key to the game was McCally's pitching
performance," coach Mark Marquess said.
It wasn't the smoothest outing of McCal
ly's career, but it was arguably his gutsiest.
McCally struck out only two batters,
walked four and allowed six hits over seven
complete innings, but gave upjust one run.
"That was one of the toughest wins I've
ever gotten," McCally said. "I was just
fighting my control, which is usually my
strong point. I didn't have a real go-to
pitch. A lot of times, I just said to myself,
That one worked last time. I'll throw it
again.'"
McCally was impeccable in tight situa
tions. In each of the first five innings the
Gamecocks had at least one runner on base
with two outs, but McCally emerged un
scathed.
It was not the first time McCally has de
livered a crucial performance in the play
offs. He brought a 1.09 ERA in 24.2 post
season innings into Tuesday's game. It's a
rare pitcher who can boast of hurting his
career postseason ERA by allowing just one
run in seven innings.
Meanwhile, Putnam lead the Cardinal
offense's pummeling of the South Carolina
pitching staff.
Danny Putnam struggled on Monday
with no hits and two strikeouts against
Fullerton and was looking to get back on
track against the Gamecocks. He more
than redeemed his Monday perfor
mance, going 4-for-5 with a home run
and five RBI.

"I thought they would try
and attack me the same way Cal
State Fullerton did the other
dav with change ups and fast
balls in," Putnam said. "I was
able to hit a fastball up over the
middle and was looking for
pitches over the plate. On those
little questionnaires of what's
your best baseball experience,
this might go down as one of
them."

Gamecocks had at least one runner on base
with two outs, but McCally emerged un
scathed.
It was not the first time McCally has de
livered a crucial performance in the play
offs. He brought a 1.09 ERA in 24.2 post
season innings into Tuesday's game. It's a
rare pitcher who can boast of hurting his
career postseason ERA by allowing just one
run in seven innings.
Meanwhile, Putnam lead the Cardinal
offense's pummeling of the South Carolina
pitching staff.
Danny Putnam struggled on Monday
with no hits and two strikeouts against
Fullerton and was looking to get back on
track against the Gamecocks. He more
than redeemed his Monday perfor
mance, going 4-for-5 with a home run
and five RBI.

"I thought they would try
and attack me the same way Cal
State Fullerton did the other
dav with change ups and fast
balls in," Putnam said. "I was
able to hit a fastball up over the
middle and was looking for
pitches over the plate. On those
little questionnaires of what's

OMAHA — The Cardinal seemed on
cruise control in its first College World Se
ries game on June 13, taking a smooth 8-0
victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks
to open the action in Omaha.

Baseball: College World Series
June 13: Stanford 8, South Carolina 0
June 17: Stanford 13, South Carolina 6

Not once did a Stanford fan have cause
to move even an inch toward the edge of
his seat. The Cardinal grabbed control of
the game in the first inning and never let
go, thanks in large part to junior John
Hudgins.
Hudgins threw a masterpiece in the first
game of the Cardinal's Super Regional
against Long Beach and appeared to be in
similar form on Friday. He retired the
Gamecocks' side in the top of the first in
ning with six pitches.
Gamecocks starter David Marchbanks
was not so fortunate.
Marchbanks gave up two runs in the
bottom of the first with a single from Stan
ford senior Ryan Garko, who has been an
RBI machine all season.
This is Garko's fourth CWS appearance,
and the seasoned veteran has typically
been a clutch hitter in the postseason.
"There's a heightened awareness here,
and I think I feed off of that," Garko said.
South Carolina's Kevin Melillo managed
the first hard-hit ball off Hudgins in the top
of the second, a line drive to right center
that seemed sure to be an easy stand-up
double.
Junior Carlos Quentin, however,
robbed Melillo with a web-gem level tum
bling catch that seemed like a bad omen for
the Gamecocks.
With a 4-0 lead at the end of the second,
Hudgins had some early breathing room,
but didn't use a bit of it.
Hudgins threw a total of eight innings,
giving up no runs and just two hits. The
Cardinal ace could easily have finished the
game for what would have been the first
complete-game shutout in the CWS since
1994.
However, head coach Mark Marquess
brought in freshman reliever Kodiak
Quick to close the game. Quick tossed a
scoreless ninth inning and Hudgins exited
the game after only 84 pitches, leaving his
arm available for further use later in the
week.
"This isn't a one-game tournament,"
said Hudgins, who appeared not the least
bit perturbed about leaving the game. "It
isn't about individuals or anything like
that; it's about winning ballgames."
Stanford junior Sam Fuld went 3-for-4,
junior Jonny Ash drove in two runs and
freshman Jed Lowrie and sophomore
Danny Putnam each had drove in one in
the Cardinal victory.

OMAHA — Elimination Tuesday in
Omaha means go big or go home — liter
ally. The two losing teams have to hit the
barbecue and then the road, and the Car
dinal was determined to not be one of them
onjune 17.
Having suffered a bitterly close defeat to

Cal State Fullerton on Monday and with
their season on the line, it was easy money
to bet on the Cardinal bats producing a
high run tally. The only question was
whether the South Carolina Gamecocks -
in the same do-or-die situation - would
have the firepower to keep up.
Stanford's starting pitcher, senior Ryan
McCally, and the defense behind him an
swered that question with a stellar com
bined effort and the Cardinal stayed alive
in the CWS with a 13-6 victory.
"I was pleased with the offense, but the
key to the game was McCally's pitching
performance," coach Mark Marquess said.
It wasn't the smoothest outing of McCal
ly's career, but it was arguably his gutsiest.
McCally struck out only two batters,
walked four and allowed six hits over seven
complete innings, but gave upjust one run.
"That was one of the toughest wins I've
ever gotten," McCally said. "I was just
fighting my control, which is usually my
strong point. I didn't have a real go-to
pitch. A lot of times, I just said to myself,
That one worked last time. I'll throw it
again.'"
McCally was impeccable in tight situa
tions. In each of the first five innings the
Gamecocks had at least one runner on base
with two outs, but McCally emerged un
scathed.
It was not the first time McCally has de
livered a crucial performance in the play
offs. He brought a 1.09 ERA in 24.2 post
season innings into Tuesday's game. It's a
rare pitcher who can boast of hurting his
career postseason ERA by allowing just one
run in seven innings.

mance, going 4-for-5 with a home run
