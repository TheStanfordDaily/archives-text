OMAHA — Were you here in 2001? Were
you here when Stanford and Cal-State
Fullerton duked it out into the Omaha dusk
in the same game, with the same stakes on
the line?

Baseball: College World Series

June 15: California State-Fullerton 6, Stanford 5

June 19: Stanford 7, CS Fullerton 5(10)

Or what about 2002? Were you at Sunken
Diamond when the same two teams went
pitch-for pitch, punch-for-punch, deep into
the Palo Alto night in the NCAA Regional
opening game?
If you were, then it shouldn't have been
too surprising to see the nail-biting, teeth
clenching action heading into the late in
nings before Fullerton's Chad "the Chief'
Cordero slammed the door on the back-and
forth battle and gave the Titans a 6-5 win
ners'-bracket victory in front of 24,191 fans
at Rosenblatt Stadium on June 15.
"It's been a good rivalry and we always
seem to have good games against them,"
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said.
Stanford, of course, did not make it easy.
When the Titans took an early 3-0 lead, ju
nior first baseman Brian Hall hit an unex
pected two-run shot just inside the left-field
pole in the third inning to cut the lead to one.
Junior Sam Fuld then carried a 410-foot
bomb over the centerfield fence to tie it at
three.
But a combination of a struggling perfor
mance by freshman pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk, who gave up six runs and ten hits
in 6 1/3 innings and earned his first loss of the
year, and untimely miscues in the outfield al
lowed Fullerton to turn a late 5-4 deficit into
a one-run lead.
"I just felt that we gave them a little bit too
much. We gave them base-on-balls and hit
batsmen. They're tough. They did a good
job," Marquess said.
Trailing 5-4, Fullerton rallied back on a
bloop single by Titan shortstop Justin Turn
er in the sixth inning which scored Jason
Corapci to tie the game at five. Then, Fuller
ton's Richie Burgos ripped a ball deep to

right field, where the Cardinal's Carlos
Quentin mistimed his leap and was unable to
make the catch at the wall, allowing the Ti
tans' P. J. Filittere to score the go-ahead run.

OMAHA — What started as a fiasco for the
Cardinal turned into its most suspensetul
and spectacular victory of the season on June
19. Stanford defeated Cal State Fullerton 7-
5 in 10 innings to send the Titans home and
advance to the championship series against
Rice.
And two unlikely heroes were largely re
sponsible.
Stanford struck first with back-to-back-to
back singles from Carlos Quentin, Ryan
Garko and Danny Putnam in the top of the
first. Putnam's drive to left field brought in
Quentin and the Cardinal exited the half in
ning with a 1-0 lead.
Freshman Matt Manship, the Cardinal's
usual closer, was on the hill for the start. With
only one start to his credit, Manship battled
admirably and kept the floodgates from
opening, but he never found a rhythm and
struggled with his control.
In the bottom of the third, umpire Randy
Bruns ruled that an inside pitch from Man
ship had just barely grazed Ronnie Pretty
man's thigh. With Prettyman on first, Justin
Turner squared up to bunt, and Manship's
fastball went high and in.
This time it was no mere graze: Turner
took the pitch square in the face and had to
leave the game. To the relief of everyone,
Fullerton's trainer announced after the
game that Turner suffered no broken bones
or head trauma.
Stanford broke through the scoring
drought in the fifth when Lowrie hit a sharp
single up the middle with two outs in the
sixth, and Chris Carter brought him home
with a towering blast into the right field
bleachers. Carter's shot was a much-needed
gust in the Cardinal's sails, and sent Windsor
to the dugout.
Fuld led off the seventh with a double to
move him into a tie for most career CWS hits
(22). Ash stepped to the plate, and he had
