The Rice Owls crushed Stanford 14-2 in
the Cardinal's second blowout loss in a cham
pionship game in three years.
Stanford lost 12-1 to Miami in the nation
al title game in 2001. That 11-run loss tied
the largest margin of defeat in College World
Series history. Now the Cardinal owns the
record outright.
"We couldn't give them much of a game,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We haven't made much of a game of it the
last two times."
It was a bitter end to an otherwise spectac
ular season. The team struggled early in the
year but soon recovered and won the Pac-10
title. In Omaha, the Cardinal fought its way
through the losers' bracket after a second
round loss to Fullerton. Beating South Car
olina and then Fullerton twice in a row to ad
vance to the championship series, Stanford
once again staved off elimination by defeat
ing Rice 8-3 after a first game loss.
Four times the Cardinal was on the brink
of packing its bags and four times it lived to
play one more game. But once again it came
up one more miracle game short.
The loss was especially hard on the se
niors, who have now been to three champi
onship games without taking home a ring.
Despite ending their year - and for some,
their college careers - on such a dismal note,
the Cardinal players held their heads high
and refused to let one game define their time
at Stanford.
"Obviously the big feeling we all share is
disappointment," said senior Ryan Garko. "I
think we have to keep it in perspective
though. We have a lot going for us. We're at
Stanford, and we're 20 years old."
Last night was all about pitching. Rice's
Philip Humber dealt a complete-game five
hitter while six Stanford pitchers struggled
to find the strike zone.
The Cardinal staff combined fora total of
12 walks, seven of them from freshman
starter Mark Romanczuk.
The Cardinal's troubles started immedi
ately with three-up-three-down in the top of
the first. Juniors Sam Fuld and Jonny Ash
both made solid contact but found Rice in
fielders as Humber used just seven pitches to
retire the side.
Romanczuk took the mound in the bot
tom of the inning and committed a cardinal
sin of baseball by walking the lead off batter.
The freshman has had a habit of doing such
all year, but has generally been able to work
himself out of jams. Not this time.
Romanczuk loaded the bases and walked in
three runs before getting out of the inning.
Rice owned a 3-0 lead without a single RBI hit.

Humber made short work of the Cardinal
in the second, again needingjust seven pitch
es while Romanczuk started his half of the in
ning with a four-pitch walk. Marquess had
seen enough.
Freshman Matt Manship relieved Ro
manczuk, whom the Cardinal had hoped
would go at least five or six innings but left
without recording an out in the second.
Manship was unable to prevent his inher
ited runner from scoring, but he provided
the Cardinal with its most solid pitching per
formance of the night, going four innings be
fore getting into trouble.
After a single, an intentional walk and an
other single to load the bases in the bottom of
the sixth inning, junior Drew Ehrlich came
on to replace Manship and the floodgates
opened.
Ehrlich allowed back-to-back two-RBI hits
before sophomore Mark Jecmen came in. A
walk, an error and three runs later, sopho
more Jonny Dyer replaced Jecmen and final
ly stopped the bleeding.
The seven-run inning blew the game open
for Rice and tied the all-time record for most
runs in a single inning in a championship
game.
The Cardinal scored a run in the seventh and
one more in the eighth, but they only served
to avoid a shutout.
Adding insult to injury, Rice fans in the
outfield bleachers tossed almost a dozen
beach balls onto the field after the seventh in
ning, seemingly bored with the blowout.

Ironically, while the night was a disaster
for the team, it produced many individual
honors for Cardinal team members.
Fuld's RBI single in the eighth inning
gave him his 24th career CWS hit to break
the all-time record. Hudgins, who won three
games in the CWS for the first time since
1989, earned the Most Outstanding Player
award. For both players the honors were bit
tersweet.
"I'd trade trophies right now. It's not the
one I wanted," Hudgins said.
Joining Hudgins on the all-tournament
team were junior Jonny Ash at third base,
sophomore Danny Putnam and junior Car
los Quentin in the outfield, and Garko at
catcher.
Losing three national championship
games in four years is certainly frustrating,
but the mere fact that the Cardinal has been
to the title game so frequently in recent years
is tribute to the perennial quality of the
team.
There really was a pervading sense among
the Cardinal players and fans that this was
the Cardinal's year.
Obviously it wasn't, and Stanford may not
get another shot for some time to come. The
Cardinal has played in the CWS for five con
secutive years, but doesn't assume that mak
ing it to Omaha - much less the champi
onship game - will be a given in future years.
"You never take for granted that you'll be
back," said Marquess. "We treasure every
time we get back here."


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
Despite the amazing pitching effort contributed by senior John Hudgins in the second game of the Rice
series, the Cardinal could not pull out a victory. Hudgins, taken in the third round of the MLB draft by the
Texas Rangers, threw 267 pitches in four days to give his squad a shot at the title.
