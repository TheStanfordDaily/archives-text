# 'Angels' arrive on top

### SUSAN YUN 
The second installment of the
Charlie's Angels series, "Charlie's
.Angels: Full Throttle," was No. 1
at the box office this weekend,
took in an estimated $38 million,
knocked down "The Hulk," and
confirmed again the lasting ap
peal of this franchise.
"Charlie's Angels" seems to be a
formula that works... and why
shouldn't it? Starring Cameron
Diaz (Natalie), Drew Barrymore
(Dylan), and Lucy Liu (Alex), the
movie chronicles the .Angels' ef
forts to retrieve encrypted rings
that hold the names of all Federal
Witness Protection Program par
ticipants. Essentially, three hot
girls in cool clothes rid the world of
evil. There's sex appeal, there's ac
tion, and there's a moral order
where the bad guys get hurt while
the good guys . . . err . . . girls
look fine while delivering retribu
tion.
If you're looking fora challeng
ing mystery, look somewhere else.
While the movie tries to keep us in
suspense as to who the big bad
criminal is, we all know from the
trailers and the heavy publicity that
Demi Moore plays a "fallen angel"
masterminding the caper. We are
never really awed by the Angels'
crime solving skills because the plot
is not the movie's strong point.
Surprisingly, however, this
movie successfully delivers humor
as well, making it a fun movie
that's perfect for summer. The
movie dragged only when it
veered off into small subplots that
introduced a melange of under

movie review.

developed characters.
Nevertheless, despite plot
weakness, the script is infused with
enough humor to keep it from de
generating to a"The Fast and the
Furious" level of Hollywood
movie-making. While it delivers
superficial Hollywood fun, it does
so in a tongue-in-cheek way, so
that the audience can laugh,
rather than gag, at the over-the
top scenes. In the opening of the
movie, Cameron Diaz's character
distracts a bar full of soldiers by
climbing on top of a bull and rid
ing to her heart's content. Yes, she
is wearing pigtails and FM boots,
rounding out the fantasy for all
men out there, but it's funny pre
cisely because it's so deliberately
fanciful. We know it's an act (we
also see her in a later getup as a
rather ugly man), and that the act
is only one weapon in her arsenal
of whoop-ass.
Another aspect that makes this
movie enjoyable to watch is that
die three actresses seem closer in
this second movie (whether this is
true or not is anyone's guess, but
they're always linking arms in girly
harmony at publicity events).
Their chemistry gives you the im
pression that this was a fun movie
to make (yes! I want to be an

Angel!), and that fun translates to
the audience.
The film also delivers a surpris
ing number of cameos, some of
them superfluous, but entertain
ing nonetheless. And there is no
end to the number of hot bods.
Demi Moore, looking astounding
at 40, is only one in a line of actors
showing off their washboard abs.
Rodrigo Santoro (the surfer) had
women in the audience drooling
(and no, he never speaks a single
word), and even bad guy Justin
Theroux (Seamus) exudes sex ap
peal with his rock-hard six-pack.
Director McG knows how to get an
audience's attention, and he suc
cessfully delivers on the visuals.

What saves this movie from
straight-to-video doom, however,
is his knack for infusing humor to
keep the exaggerated scenes
palatable, his choice of catchy
tunes (ala MC Hammer's "Can't
Touch This"), and setups that just
make a scene look sweet. And
while some tributes are too ran
dom, his homage to classics like
Sound of Music and Flashdance
nevertheless add to the visual
comfort this movie brings to audi
ences that simply wanted to rest
their brains for two hours.
Overall, "Charlie's Angels: Full
Throttle" delivers on what it
promises â€” don't take the movie
too seriously and enjoy the ride.
