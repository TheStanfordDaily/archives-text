# Nothing crouching or hidden about Lee's 'Hulk'

Incredible? Hardly. Indelible? Not at all.
Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a long, lumbering
comic book movie that swings around aimlessly
like King Kong lost in Central Park.
It shouldn't have been this way. Lee — the di
rector of some of the greatest movies in recent
years, including "Sense and Sensibility" (1995),
"The Ice Storm" (1997) and, of course, "Crouch
ing Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (2001) — doesn't
seem to find the right tone in the material. Is it a
fun, throwaway summer flick? An emotionally
charged romance? A metaphor for the tortured
human spirit? It's all of the above, and the result
is a film that ambles too often, without a path or
point of reference: a cross between Tim Burton's
original "Batman" and Ron Howard's "A Beau
tiful Mind."

It's like an experiment
gone terribly awry.
The film opens familiarly
enough, with green credits
and a pop song that could
have been lifted from "2 Fast
2 Furious." We meet the
younger version of our hero
Bruce Banner (Eric Bana),
played by Michael Kronen-

berg. Because of an abusive scientist father and
mysterious injections that appear to be more
harmful than heroin, he is rendered semi-hulk
ish, a condition that is later intensified in a lab ex
plosion— where he works as an adult with a
beautiful woman, with a beautiful mind, named
Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).
All that follows is too intricate to explain, per
haps partially because it is too incoherent as well.
But it involves mutant dogs big enough to bark

The other perfor-

Bana is quiet and reserved, as he intends to sug
gest the character of the outcast scientist. In actu
ality, he comes off as a sluggish Dean Cain (recall
the series 'Lois and Superman') — without the
elastic acting skills needed for any superhero
type.
And Connelly is even more low-key here than
