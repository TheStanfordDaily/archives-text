# '28 Days' packs a bang with a few bucks
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a summer dominated by big-budget spec
taculars like "The Matrix Reloaded" and "Ter
minator 3: Rise of the Machines", the British
zombie flick "28 Days Later" is a delicious piece
of counter-programming from director Danny
Boyle ("Trainspotting") and first-time screen
writer Alex Garland (whose novels include The
Beach).
Made fora fraction of its competitors' bud
gets and shot on grainy digital video, this is one
of the most terrifying films that I've ever seen.
Sure, "28 Days Later" has relatively few mo
ments of genuine originality. It plavs instead
like a highlights reel from George Romero's bril
liant "Dead" trilogy, but Garland and Boyle
combine their influences so intelligently and ef
fectively that it's hard to care.
The film opens with chilling real-life news
footage of rioting crowds, then we find ourselves
in a dark, eerie laboratoiy filled with captive
monkeys. A trio of animal rights activists breaks
in, intent on releasing the monkeys. Naturally,
the activists ignore the warnings of a hapless sci
entist ("The monkeys are infected!"), and wacky
fun ensues. Rather than being grateful, the little
fellas bite one of their rescuers, infecting her
with a virus that transforms her into a mindless
beast filled widi murderous rage.
Hey, it beats the "space radiation" in "Night
of the Living Dead."
Eventually, the film cuts to 28 days later,
when bike messenger Jim (Gillian Murphy)
awakens from a coma. In a series of hauntingly
beautiful shots, Jim explores the empty hospital
and the surrounding city, finding no one. Even
tually, he stumbles into an abandoned church
(graffiti on the wall reads, "Repent! The end is
extremely fucking nigh!"), where he's attacked

by a zombiefied priest. The Infected, who move
with preternatural speed, start swarming, and
Jim is rescued by two survivors, Selena (Naomie
Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). He soon
learns that all of England has been overrun by
these zombies, and there are rumors that the in
fection has spread to New York and Paris.
The rest of "28 Days Later" is essentially a road
movie with zombies, as die survivors struggle to
escape the hordes of the Infected and make their
way to a military blockade in the north.
While the lilm is not without an oddly warm
brand of gallows humor, it treats its central con
cept with absolute seriousness, not the jokeycyn
icism of most recent horror films. Equally im
portant, "28 Days Later" is a film without safe
spaces; even the most cozy domestic scenes are
darkened by the knowledge that the Infected
are everywhere and could attack at any mo
ment.
Boyle stages several pulse-pounding set
pieces of increasing nightmarishness, including
a bloody confrontation in Jim's former home
and a frantic tire-changing scene in a dark tun
nel, culminating in an intense, gory cat-and
mouse game in a military complex, which turns
out to be anything but a sanctuary.
It's all captured in grubbily beautiful digital
video, which accentuates the film's immediacy
and gives it an almost documentary-like feel.

The movie's quieter moments are equally af
fecting, as when the characters go fora giddy
shopping spree in an abandoned supermarket,
or when they discover wild horses roaming the
countryside and can only stand in silent awe.
Murphy, Huntley and Brendan Gleeson (as
Frank, another survivor) all deliver top-notch
performances, convincing us with their terror,
grief and humanity, while Christopher Eccle
ston's Major Henry West makes fora particular
ly complex and sympathetic villain.
The message, of course, is that civilization is a
fragile construct that could topple at any mo
ment, a point that the filmmakers make with cre

ativity and wit, if not subdety.
If there's anything to complain about in "28
Days Later", it's that Boyle and Garland are, ul
timately, too sentimental to match the unrelent
ing bleakness and grim claustrophobia of "Night
of the Living Dead". The extraordinarily drain
ing and disturbing final sequence seems headed
towards an ending that cleverly echoes
"Night"'s, but instead the film pulls back from
the abyss, delivering a finale that's feels false and
a little too cozy.
Thankfully, this letdown can't erase the hor
rors (and small human triumphs) that we've al
ready witnessed.

fragile construct that could topple at any mo
ment, a point that the filmmakers make with cre

ativity and wit, if not subdety.
If there's anything to complain about in "28
Days Later", it's that Boyle and Garland are, ul
timately, too sentimental to match the unrelent
ing bleakness and grim claustrophobia of "Night
of the Living Dead". The extraordinarily drain
ing and disturbing final sequence seems headed
towards an ending that cleverly echoes
"Night"'s, but instead the film pulls back from
the abyss, delivering a finale that's feels false and
a little too cozy.
Thankfully, this letdown can't erase the hor
rors (and small human triumphs) that we've al
ready witnessed.
