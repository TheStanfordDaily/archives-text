"Bufly the Vampire Slayer: Season Four"
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" has always thrived on reinventing it
self with new themes, storylines and villains each year. So it's no
surprise that although season four found super-powered vampire
slayer Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) moving from the recently
blown-up Sunnydale High to the big bad world of college, the
show's cast and crew remained unfazed, delivering 22 of the finest
episodes in "Buffy'"s seven-year run.
Individual episodes continue the show's tradition of using the
supernatural — including a demonic roommate and a haunted frat
house — to illuminate the process of growing up, while the
season-long arc finds Buffy first working cautiously with and then
against the Initiative, a sinister government operation that seeks to
control vampires and demons, climaxing in the spectacular,
action-packed "Primeval".
Best of all are three of the stand-alone episodes written and
directed by "Buffy"'s creator Joss Whedon, who mixes melodrama,
subversive humor and kung hi with ease: "Hush", the eerie and
daring silent episode; "Who Are You?" in which Buffy switches
bodies with the angry, self-estructive slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku);
and the allusive, meditative season finale "Resdess", in which the
ostensible plot (a mysterious evil stalks Buffy and her friends in
their dreams) serves mainly as an excuse to explore characters'
inner lives.
The inexpensive six-DVD set includes the usual mix of making
of featurettes and episodes commentaries. Of particularly note are
Whedon's funny and enlightening commentaries for "Hush" and
"Restless", and the hilarious commentary by Whedon, writer/
producer Marti Noxon and departing star Seth Green for "Wild at
Heart".
