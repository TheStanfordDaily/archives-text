## Thousands turn out for gay rights Pride rocks SF 
### NICOLA JOAN CARAH 
"You gotta give them hope" was this year's San
Francisco Pride Parade slogan. But the marchers
during Sunday's festivities, who numbered more
than half a million and included an enthusiastic
Stanford contingent, could best be described as ju
bilant, given last week's Supreme Court ruling
granting greater freedoms to same-sex couples.
"[The parade] was lots of fun, to be quite hon
est," said George Duran, University assistant dean
of students, chair of the LGBT-Community Re
source Center Advisory Board and member of
Stanford Pride, the alumni branch of the LGBT
community.
Duran coordinated this year's Stanford contin
gent, which brought more than 40 community
members — mostly from the Leland Stanford Ju
nior Marching Band — to Sunday's event.
The Stanford group, after winning the "Most
Fabulous Contingent" award at last year's parade,
was given a place in the VIP section to entertain the
crowds during gaps in the procession.
"Just to give you an idea," said Duran, "[the
band] played fora total of 90 minutes in the first
two hours."
While Duran did say that next year the band
would prefer to march, he still thought the parade
was "ultimately, a really fun experience."
One Stanford community member who
marched on Sunday was Stanford staff member
Hao Thai. As chair of the Gay Asian Pacific Al-
liance's Pride Committee, Thai
was responsible for all aspects of
his organization's presence at
the parade. To celebrate the or
ganization's 15 years of partici
pation, a 20-foot long sushi boat
float was constructed, complete
with a sound system to blast
"Japanese pop/club music", and
featuring Mr. and Mrs.
GAPA — dressed as "Iron Chef
and Geisha," according to
Thai — waving to the crowd
members.
"There were so many things
that I was worrying about before
the start of the parade," Thai
said. "But after 10 minutes into
the parade, it all disappeared
into the music, energy and cheers
of the crowd".
Several groups marched with

GAPA, including OCCUR, a gay
rights group based in Japan that
flew to San Francisco for the
event.
"Seeing the massive amount of
support in the parade helped to
add new energy and enthusiasm
to their struggles back in Japan,
where their last Pride only saw a
turnout of about a hundred spec
tators," Thai said.
This year's festivities were am
plified by the recent Supreme
Court overruling of Texas' anti
sodomy law, described by many
as a monumental victory for the
queer community.
"There was a totally different
tone," Duran said, when asked if
he felt the decision affected this
year's Pride Parade.
According to him, marchers
carried signs throughout the
day referencing the decision.
The overall mood was very cele
bratory.
One sign reading "I had

sodomy for breakfast" was pic
tured in newspapers across the
Bay Area. Canada's recognition
of same-sex marriages was
noted by parade-goers as well,
as stated in one man's sign that
read "Buy Canadian maple
syrup."
"Absolutely, the tide is turn
ing," Duran said. "[We're] far
away from where we'd like to be,
but it is a step in the right direc
tion."
Carolyn Laub, Class of'9s, was
nominated as an honorary
Grand Marshall for her work cre
ating the Gay-Straight Alliance
Network.
She has received substantial
acclaim for her work in creating
the Gay-Straight Alliance Net
work, an organization that brings
together high school gay-straight
alliance extracurricular clubs na
tionwide.
Laub described the Supreme
Court ruling as a "historic deci

sion" and felt that "a lot of people
were psyched up [at the pa
rade]"as a result.
Many who did not attend the
event still appreciated its spirit
and message.
"Even though I didn't go to
the parade, I am proud to be a
part of such an accepting and di
verse community [at Stanford]"
junior Phil Sayegh said.
This view was reflected in
Princeton Review's recent rank
ing on "gay-friendly" schools,
placing Stanford as 19 out of 345
colleges.
"I certainly respect the
ranking," Duran said, who re
ferred to his own appointment
as assistant dean of Students as
a reflection of "a change in atti
tude coming from all genera
tions.
"When I was at Stanford [in
the '80s] it was more about com
ing out issues," he said. "Now,
people are coming out at

younger and younger ages. By
the time they come to Stanford,
they are more aware."
Laub said that, while she felt
"relatively comfortable coming
out at Stanford, there are a lot
of things Stanford could do to
address the accessibility and
safety of the lesbian, gay, bisex
ual and transgender communi
ty''
Specifically, she pointed to
the University's policies regard
ing transgender individuals
and suggested that administra
tors look to colleges that were
higher up on the Princeton Re
view rankings for ideas on how
to be more inclusive of this com
munity.
"Are we perfect?" Duran
asked. "Absolutely not."
But as one elderly man's sign
read on Sunday, as spotted by
Band member and alumnus
Tiffany Lewis, "It's never too late
to be proud."
