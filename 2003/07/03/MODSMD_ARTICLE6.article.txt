# Toledo emphasizes value of education
## 
### ALIA MOORE 
President Alejandro Toledo of
Peru, this year's Commencement
speaker, advised the Class 0f2004 that
"there is no better investment that a
person, a community or a nation [can]
make than investing in the minds of
our people."
His speech, delivered to the ap
proximately 25,000 students, families
and friends gathered in the sweltering
Stanford Stadium, centered on Tole
do's own rise from poverty and his
continuing efforts to fight poverty in
Peru.
He echoed President Hennessy's
statement that "the rights and privi
leges of education bring a responsibil
ity to make good use of your knowl
edge," as he implored graduates to
use their own education to fight
poverty around the world.
The 57-year-old Peruvian presi
dent shared his personal journey
from shining shoes and selling news
papers to leading his country. One of
sixteen children, the future president
was born in a tiny town in the Andes.
Seven of the family's children died
before they reached their first birth
day, an occurrence that Toledo said
was a "story very typical and repre
sentative of extreme poverty in Latin
America."
With the help of two Peace Corp
volunteers, Toledo came to the Unit

eel States and attended the University
of San Francisco on a soccer scholar
ship. He then moved on to Stanford to
receive master's degrees in education
and economics and a doctorate from
the School of Education.
Toledo used his story to highlight
the importance of education in the
fight against poverty.
"I am free, thanks to education,"
Toledo said. "Look at the world out
there. There are millions who cannot
even dream of what you have as a mat
ter of course. Don't take it for granted."
In his speech, Toledo also ad
dressed the circumstances in Peru
that almost forced him to cancel his
Stanford appearance. Striking teach
ers and the mass kidnapping of work
ers in a remote gas field by leftist
rebels placed pressure on the presi
dent the week before he was to make
the trip to California.
"[Educators] are still at the bottom
of my heart," Toledo said in response
to the protests preceding his appear
ance.
The choice of speaker was not en
tirely free of controversy at Stanford
either. Still, the reaction to Toledo
was not nearly as strong as the
protests that sprang up when Nation
al Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice
was chosen to speak at last year's
Commencement.
In the weeks before the ceremony,
an open letter asking Toledo to free

Lori Benson, an American activist cur
rently in prison in Peru, circulated by
email and appeared in campus news
papers. Berenson arrested in Novem
ber of 1995 for allegedly aiding a ter
rorist organization, and is currently
serving a 20-year sentence. A small
group of students dispersed literature
during the ceremony calling for Tole
do to act, but the speech went unin
terrupted.
Many audience members were not
impressed by Toledo.
"I did not hear one positive thing
about him," said Wanda Rouzan,
whose daughter Breyana was gradu
ating. "There were places where he
paused for applause, and I know he
was met with stony silence from our
section. It felt like he was launching
into a campaign speech."
Graduating senior Brooke Alexan
der said, "He was awful. He didn't re
ally relate his speech to graduating
students embarking into the real
world."
Several students and visitors ex
pressed disappointment in the con
tent of the speech.
"I have the utmost respect for his
commitment and accomplishments,
but he wasn't the right speaker for
this," said graduating senior Naveen
Kabir.
"It was a bland political speech,"
said graduating senior Leif Granberg.
"It was a missed opportunity."
