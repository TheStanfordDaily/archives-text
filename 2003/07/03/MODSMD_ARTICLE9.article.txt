# CoHo project finds new look
## Dining services takes over coffee house, promising more than just a new taste 
### CAROLINE CICCONE 
After a week's worth of renovations, the CoHo recent
ly reopened under the management of Stanford Dining.
Although sporting changes such as a new menu and a no
ticeably different interior, the CoHo will largely retain the
union workforce that was employed there prior to the
change in management.
Nadeem Siddiqui, executive director of Stanford Din
ing Services, is excited about the immediate results and
will continue to work to improve the CoHo.
"Everyone's goal is to provide exceptional service to our
students, faculty and staff." Siddiqui said. "It has to be a
destination for our campus. But there are challenges with
money, there are challenges with time."
Stanford Dining hopes to give the CoHo a true coffee
house feel with what Siddiqui calls a "user-friendly ambi
ence."
Some initial changes have been outside seating with
umbrellas, a more comfortable atmosphere inside and a
different menu. Alcohol is not yet being served, but the
CoHo hopes to obtain its liquor license by September.
Also absent are the build-your-own sandwiches once en
joyed by many customers at the CoHo.
"I lament the cessation of the build-your-own-sand
wich system because it suffocates my culinary creativity,
rising junior Dan Trupin said.
The CoHo closed fora week this June for renovations.
It will close again in late August or early September for
more alterations before the new academic year begins.
Future changes will include better air conditioning, wire
less Internet access and more menu choices for students.
These changes at the Coho are part of a larger plan by
the University to improve student space on campus. Stan
ford Dining has also been working closely with the ASSU
to discuss programming that will make the CoHo a center
of student activity.
Event ideas currently under consideration are jazz
nights, poetry readings and open-mic nights, which are
all types of events that were offered previously at the
CoHo.

The University is still in negotiations with national ven
dors, such as Subway, for creating more food options in
Tressider. However, it will be two or three more weeks
until final decisions will be made.
Previously, Stanford Dining cited one of the advan
tages of a Stanford-run coffee house as being that stu
dents could use points from their University meal plans
to buy food.
Although this system is not yet in place, in the future,
students will be able to use as many as fifty dining points
per quarter at the CoHo. However, alcohol cannot be
purchased with these points.
After discussions between the University and SEIU

Local 715 this past April, Stanford Dining agreed to give
preference to former Bon Appettit I residder employees
when they hired for the new University I residder posi
tions.
According to Siddiqui, with the help of the union and
University Human Resources, approximately fifty per
cent of the former Bon Appetit staff has been hired by
Stanford Dining following a reapplication process. 1 lie
University aims to rehire all of the Bon Appetit staff by the
start of fall quarter.
"Summer is slow, but by fall we hope to have hired
everybody," Siddiqui said. "We are working very closeh
with the union in achieving that goal."
