# International spotlight
## Saudi Arabia 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is part of a series of inter
views with international students at Stanford
meant to heighten awareness of issues of social
and political importance around the world.
Haitham Boshnak, of Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, is in his fifth year as a doc
toral candidate in electrical engi
neering. The birthplace and spiritual cen
ter of Islam, as well as one of the most oil
rich nations in the world, Saudi Arabia is
one of the most powerful states in the Mid
dle East.
The Daily: What are some experiences
that you've had growing up in Saudi Ara
bia that you think would give a clearer pic
ture of your country to foreigners?
Haitham Boshnak: People [in the United
States] try to think of Saudi Arabia as
through the values that Americans know
and experiences that Americans know.
That makes it hard for someone to under
stand where Saudi Arabia is coming
from — how the people in Saudi Arabia
are acting. Basically, the society in Saudi
Arabia in many parts is very tribal in na
ture. And being so, a good amount of the
people look — while they can be generous
and open — perhaps very closed to people
from outside the country. You try to inter
act with them and you'd not really know
what are their values, where are they com
ing from. You'd just know the mere sur
face. This even happens when people
move from one region to another [within
Saudi Arabia]: it takes some time to adapt
because even culture differs greatly from
one region to another. That is something
that I went through back home, and it
helped me appreciate the cultural differ
ence even here in the United States. This is
something that people in the United States
should take into consideration.
TD: How do these major cultural differ
ences within the country affect Saudi Ara
bian society and the political system?
HB: What brings the people together is
that they have a common background on
top of all this culture, which is actually the
religion. So despite that some cultural val
ues are differing a lot, once you lay back all
of this to Islam, that would bring the basis
of understanding between all of them.
That, at least, is what the government is
trying to do, to recognize the tribal differ
ences and address them and at the same
time rely on a backbone that it tries to base
everything on, which is common between
everyone, which is religion.
There is flexibility within the religion that
allows you to adapt any social or even po
litical orders that won't conflict with the re
ligion. Once you know that there are no
conflicts between the religion and your po
litical or social approaches, or ways of liv
ing, then that's fine. The main driving
force should be the religion.
Because of the nature of Saudi Arabia, be
cause it is of a tribal nature, even if it is
urban, you would find it to be of a very
family-oriented nature. [Saudi Arabians]
have very close ties with relatives, uncles,
cousins, the usual within the same city.
They see each other and know about each
other more often than people would think.

For example, it can be every weekend that
yon get the whole family together. Not
only parents and children, but the extend
ed family. Family sizes as well tend to be
larger than in the U.S., with four to live
children. Saudi Arabia is also a fairly young
country, with about fifty percent of the
population under 20.
TD: Could you give your perspective on
Saudi Arabia's current role in the Middle
East, and in relation to the U.S.?
HB: This is something that I really am con
fused about lately. It seems that what was
going on — the way we see it back home
and even from here — that there are very
close ties and very good cooperation be
tween Saudi Arabia and the United States.
With the latest events that have happened
we hear a change of tone, there is no coop
eration, and this is what we hear in the
press over here on the daily news in the
United States. And that nothing positive
has gone on between the two countries,
and that would make you wonder what has
gone on for the past fifty years between the
two countries. There were a lot of mutual
interests and cooperation between them.
Why would even so stressful and. tragic
events that have gone on these days
change the perspective of fifty years of un
derstanding. I wouldn't be able to elabo-

rate or understand the political agenda of
the people actually planning that [split be
tween the U.S. and Saudi Arabia]. For
some reason, it seems that for the time
being there is a trend or a fashion to go
against countries in the Middle East. So
there's Iran, there's Syria, there's Iraq,
there's Saudi Arabia. Whatever the mo
tives are, I would really guess that the best
thing to do is identify the truth of j:he
claims before taking action, and see why
would be such claims of not cooperating or
not responding properly.
A good example of that would be what you
see always stated in the news that 15 of the
19 hijackers that committed the acts of
September 11 are Saudis. You read this
again and again and again and again. I
don't know what the motivation is for re
peating that. Even if all of the hijackers
were Saudis, that won't represent the
country. That won't make a country an ag
gressor. [Butjthis connection would stay in
the minds of many people that Saudis hate
Americans; it would not only do that, but
do the reverse, where it would implant in
Saudis that maybe we hate Americans. The
Western media is saying that it is discov
ered that there is hidden hatred — you
hear about these interviews where re
porters go to Saudi Arabia and interview
people and conclude that they hate Amer
icans. You can find anyone that hates in
any society, but that is not necessarily the
majority. Maybe the reporters talk to
groups of people who are misled or don't
know how to represent themselves. For ex-

ample, people talk about hating the posi
tion that the United States is placing Saudi
Arabia in a confined position, and that
would come out as hating the United
States. Once you start hammering on an
issue, and the issue is hatred, eventually
some people on both sides would believe it
whether they feel it or not.
TD: How does what you're saying to relate
to your own experiences in the U.S?
HB: For awhile [after September 11th and
ensuing events], when I decided to stay in
the U.S. it was actually a question: should
I leave the U.S., should I fear if something
would happen, if people would react
badly to us. That was something I didn't
know at the beginning. I came here in the
fall of 1998, and after getting my masters
[at Stanford] I decided to continue with
the l'h.D program. I know some people
who actually decided to leave the U.S. be
cause they feared retaliation and because
the procedures became more stringent
against Saudis. That sudden change can
be explainable on a political agenda, but
on a personal level or on a humanitarian
level when somebody is one day treated in
a certain way, and then the next day treat
ed in a very different way, not everyone
can actually adjust for that change for
something that he had nothing to do with.

I feel it less being in Stanford and in the
Bay Area, where people are at a high level
of education and they understand that the
media can misrepresent, or when they in
teract with people they understand that
this person is not part of that sect or that
cult. Some areas are not as welcoming and
understanding as the Bay Area, and that
can make the differnce in person's deci
sion to stay or not. For awhile, every time
when somebody asks "where are you
from." It always rings into my mind, how
will he change his views when I say to him
that T'rh Saudi. What is the image in his
brain of a Saudi person, how does he view
a Saudi person. I personally don't know
what that view is. I wish I knew. If you
know what people think of you, you can
actually change it, but if you don't know,
you just have to assume goodwill and act
upon that.
TD: What are your views on major issues
in the Middle East right now, such as the
current conflict in Israel?
HB: I don't really know how much the
U.S. is siding with one party against an
other; I don't know if they're being im
partial, or are [if they're] favoring one
over the other. I know for sure that both
parties are committing mistakes in ways
that are not helping to solve the problems
that they are facing. I think that being po
litically fair is different from being hu
manitarianly fair. That is something that is
always being confused: people mix up
being a human being and being a country

or a nation. I guess one of the things that
we always talk about in events that relate
to Palestine here on campus is that right of
the person to live wherever who feels it is
his home given that he respects other peo
ples' rights and freedoms. And that would
immediately involve speaking about the
right of return, where it is a big no-no in
the negotiations for peace in the region.
One of the things that I remember when
I'm speaking about these issues is that
people say we "have 22 arab countries, so
why don't they do something to relieve the
pain of the Palestinians. Why don't you
just accept them and make them citizens
of your country." Nobody said that that
didn't actually happen. Back home in
Saudi Arabia, families that were of Pales
tinian descent that are now Saudi citizens -
but people know their origins, and they
remember that. When 1 was a kid, I used
to have live or six very close Palestinian
friends, and 1 remember in the fifth and
sixth grade some of them would come to
me and say "don't be afraid, because my
father's telling me that we're leaving for
Gaza or Jordan" and I would say "why do
you want to leave," and lie would explain
to me — and you can imagine a kid in the
fifth or sixth grade saying this — that "if
we would not leave and go back to Pales
tine, then we would lose our land; the only
way to keep it is to be there and this is what
my father wants." I never understood that
when 1 was at that age, and maybe neither
did they, and I'm just wondering now,
after all of these years, where are they? I
knew them as children, they were some of
my best friends when I was a kid, and did
one of them become a suicide bomber, did
they die, did they get captured? I don't
know about that, but I know that the peo
ple chose to keep their identity, people
chose to struggle to keep their land, and
that should be respected as a right. That
doesn't give people the right to terrorize
each other — that's a different issue. Peo
ple who struggle to keep their rights
should be respected for what they do. So
at least this would answer the claim con
cerning "why haven't Arab countries
helped the Palestinians and given them a
cut of their wide land." It's the choice of
many Palestinians to be identified as Pales
tinians and to struggle for their land. It's
not a matter of preference.
One of the things that people talk about,
like what happened in Iraq and the unjust
war that happened in Iraq and honestly, I
can't take a position. I know in terms of fol
lowing the U.N. agenda, that things were
not carried out the way they should have
been carried out. Is it better for Iraq, or
worse? I really don't know. What I feel that
happened is that it was justified here in the
U.S. as freeing the Iraqi people. I under
stand that anyone who seeks freedom un
derstands that there is a sacrifice behind it
and that sacrifice can mean sacrificing
lives. The decision to sacrifice lives was not
taken by the Iraqi people, it was taken by
the U.S. I don't know if that gives them the
right to do so or not. The only thing that
would show is actually what happens next.
And for the time being, nothing is happen
ing. Before the war, they had a miserable
life, but they had one. Now, they don't
know what they have. Until they have
something, probably some of them would
favor what they had before.
