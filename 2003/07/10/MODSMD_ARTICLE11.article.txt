## Clashing campus viewpoints: affirmative action programs Effects of past inequality still need to be addressed 
### ELEANOR WILLIAMS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Lack of support for affirmative action
leads me to question the extent to which the
differentials of power and privilege are un
derstood and condoned on this campus.
The playing field is not equal. In other
words, race matters. White people have an
easier time of living and trying to succeed in
America than black people do. It is true,
though people won't believe me.
There's a must-read article by Peggy
McKintosh called "Unpacking the Knapsack
of White Privilege." It highlights many of the
subtle ways that white males continue to exist
in their position as the dominant, privileged
social group in American society. Unfortu
nately many people are, quite frankly, blind
to the advantages that the dominant group
possesses, probably because these benefits
have been in place for so long that few — es
pecially those who don't suffer as a conse
quence of racial dominance — think to ques
tion the fact that it is a lot easier fora white
man to navigate mainstream America than it
is fora Mexican, a black, a woman, a queer or
a disabled individual.
Some people truly feel that discrimina
tion is not that big of a deal in America, cit
ing the Civil Rights Movement as (inade
quate and erroneous) proof that the playing
fields have somehow been leveled in recent
years. This is not the case.
In 1991 Diane Sawyer did a Prime Time
special called True Colors, where her crew
followed and secretly filmed two men going
around St Louis fora day. The two were
equal in every respect (similar jobs, educa
tion, background, interests), except that one
was white and the other was black. They
went around to the same places looking for
apartments, jobs, cars, shoes, etc. The same
people consistently gave differential treat
ment to the two men on the basis of their
skin color. Watch the show. It's in Creen Li
brary and anyone who's recently taken Cul
tural or Social Psychology has already seen it
so you can ask them.
I'd place my bets on getting a similar re
sult today (Diane, ever thought about doing
a 21st century follow-up?). What this docu
mentary shows is that race matters, even if
you control for class, gender, attractiveness
and all that other good stuff. America is not
a meritocracy, and we're not all treated
equally. Period.
Affirmative action is not about giving jobs
tf) unqualified black people, or putting ma
jority people into slots in colleges that
they're not entitled to holding. Yes, I said
majority. Yes, I meant "of color." This is not
a mistake. If you are white, you are the glob
al minority. see how you like the label.
It's a question of access to equal opportu
nity. Standardized tests don't give standard
ized results because students who take them

don't come from standardized school sys
tems, neighborhoods or homes. If we're not
addressing inequality (and we're not) at the
level of a child's experience growing up in
America, then at what point do we begin to
do so? Access to higher education is as good
a place as any to start. We're talking about
college because we see an investment in the
human capital of disadvantaged groups.
Affirmative action is not about being anti
white. What could be more counterproduc
tive on many levels? Besides, people are
quick to forget that so many of those who
benefit from affirmative action are white
women. They're a huge chunk of the US
population, and they don't get fair treat
ment either.
It's almost as if people are saying "OK
we'll admit that there were gross racial in
justices in the past, but it's a little far fetched
to think that those would have had lingering
effects even today, and even more prepos
terous to suggest that we should be working
to address those."
So we're still fighting to prove that Mexi
cans deserve degrees just as much as any
other group, not despite, but because of the
fact that they are disproportionately poor
and uneducated as compared to whites.
We're still disproving the assumption that
being black means being automatically less
qualified than your white counterpart.
Why do we still need to justify our pres
ence at this institution and others like it?
The fact is that race and socioeconomic sta
tus are unfortunately still very closely
linked, but we are not inherently unequal so
why should that be allowed to continue?
Affirmative action does not give the black
applicant an unfair advantage over the
white applicant. What it does is take a small
step toward lessening the impact of the ob
vious disadvantages that people of color face
as compared to whites, and that they will
continue to face despite their "being let in on
the basis of their skin color."
It does not end with schooling, but get
ting into Stanford at least gives many stu
dents the chance to be more than their par
ents could realistically aspire to. People's
success in life has a lot to do with their per
ceptions of their possible success, which has
a tremendous amount to do with the struc
tural constraints that they face in seeking ac
cess to opportunities.
Who benefits from being in a school that
is not racially and culturally diverse? Cer
tainly not white men themselves, who are
being forced, whether they like it or not, to
accept the fact that the world is changing
and the cultural hegemony that was the
order of the day in 1952 just isn't going to
cut it anymore. It's time to get with the pro
gram and learn that no matter what we
end up doing, we're going to need to in
teract with people of other races, classes
and cultures.

white. What could be more counterproduc
tive on many levels? Besides, people are
quick to forget that so many of those who
benefit from affirmative action are white
women. They're a huge chunk of the US
population, and they don't get fair treat
ment either.
It's almost as if people are saying "OK
we'll admit that there were gross racial in
justices in the past, but it's a little far fetched
to think that those would have had lingering
effects even today, and even more prepos
terous to suggest that we should be working
to address those."
So we're still fighting to prove that Mexi
cans deserve degrees just as much as any
other group, not despite, but because of the
fact that they are disproportionately poor
and uneducated as compared to whites.
We're still disproving the assumption that
being black means being automatically less
qualified than your white counterpart.
Why do we still need to justify our pres
ence at this institution and others like it?
The fact is that race and socioeconomic sta
tus are unfortunately still very closely
linked, but we are not inherently unequal so
why should that be allowed to continue?
Affirmative action does not give the black
applicant an unfair advantage over the
white applicant. What it does is take a small
step toward lessening the impact of the ob
vious disadvantages that people of color face
as compared to whites, and that they will
continue to face despite their "being let in on
the basis of their skin color."
It does not end with schooling, but get
ting into Stanford at least gives many stu
dents the chance to be more than their par
ents could realistically aspire to. People's
success in life has a lot to do with their per
ceptions of their possible success, which has
a tremendous amount to do with the struc
tural constraints that they face in seeking ac
cess to opportunities.
Who benefits from being in a school that
is not racially and culturally diverse? Cer
tainly not white men themselves, who are
being forced, whether they like it or not, to
accept the fact that the world is changing
and the cultural hegemony that was the
order of the day in 1952 just isn't going to
cut it anymore. It's time to get with the pro
gram and learn that no matter what we
end up doing, we're going to need to in
teract with people of other races, classes
and cultures.

Lack of support for affirmative action
leads me to question the extent to which the
differentials of power and privilege are un
derstood and condoned on this campus.
The playing field is not equal. In other
words, race matters. White people have an
easier time of living and trying to succeed in
America than black people do. It is true,
though people won't believe me.
There's a must-read article by Peggy
McKintosh called "Unpacking the Knapsack
of White Privilege." It highlights many of the
subtle ways that white males continue to exist
in their position as the dominant, privileged
social group in American society. Unfortu
nately many people are, quite frankly, blind
to the advantages that the dominant group
possesses, probably because these benefits
have been in place for so long that few — es
pecially those who don't suffer as a conse
quence of racial dominance — think to ques
tion the fact that it is a lot easier fora white
man to navigate mainstream America than it
is fora Mexican, a black, a woman, a queer or
a disabled individual.
Some people truly feel that discrimina
tion is not that big of a deal in America, cit
ing the Civil Rights Movement as (inade
quate and erroneous) proof that the playing
fields have somehow been leveled in recent
years. This is not the case.
In 1991 Diane Sawyer did a Prime Time
special called True Colors, where her crew
followed and secretly filmed two men going
around St Louis fora day. The two were
equal in every respect (similar jobs, educa
tion, background, interests), except that one
was white and the other was black. They
went around to the same places looking for
apartments, jobs, cars, shoes, etc. The same
people consistently gave differential treat
ment to the two men on the basis of their
skin color. Watch the show. It's in Creen Li
brary and anyone who's recently taken Cul
tural or Social Psychology has already seen it
so you can ask them.
I'd place my bets on getting a similar re
sult today (Diane, ever thought about doing
a 21st century follow-up?). What this docu
mentary shows is that race matters, even if
you control for class, gender, attractiveness
and all that other good stuff. America is not
a meritocracy, and we're not all treated
equally. Period.
Affirmative action is not about giving jobs
tf) unqualified black people, or putting ma
jority people into slots in colleges that
they're not entitled to holding. Yes, I said
majority. Yes, I meant "of color." This is not
a mistake. If you are white, you are the glob
al minority. see how you like the label.
It's a question of access to equal opportu
nity. Standardized tests don't give standard
ized results because students who take them

don't come from standardized school sys
tems, neighborhoods or homes. If we're not
addressing inequality (and we're not) at the
level of a child's experience growing up in
America, then at what point do we begin to
do so? Access to higher education is as good
a place as any to start. We're talking about
college because we see an investment in the
human capital of disadvantaged groups.
Affirmative action is not about being anti
white. What could be more counterproduc
tive on many levels? Besides, people are
quick to forget that so many of those who
