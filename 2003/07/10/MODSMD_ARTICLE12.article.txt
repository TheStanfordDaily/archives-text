# Race-based affirmative action does more harm than good
## 
### ANDY CLAVIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Aside from Native Americans, no racial
group has historically suffered as greatly
in the United States as blacks. No one can
deny the hundreds of years of slavery and
segregation that black people have en
dured. However, I argue that the current
system of affirmative action hurts blacks
(and other minorities) more than it helps
them. Socioeconomic affirmative action,
as 1 will discuss later, poses a much better
alternative.
The following are five key points I
offer against race-based affirmative ac
tion.
1. It hurts the credibility of blacks.
People tend to question the legitimacy
of others' successes when they know
they've been given an obvious advantage.
Because affirmative action rewards peo
ple based solely on their race - a purely
external, visual factor - the question al
most always arises: "Did that person get
into this school because he's black?"
Now, one may argue, "What about stu
dents who get in as legacies? Don't they
get an unfair advantage?" But there's a
huge difference between legacy and skin
color. Skin color is external; legacies
often go unknown. If legacy students
wore a sign around their neck 24 hours a
day saying that their parents went to
Stanford, people would question their le
gitimacy too.
2. It confuses racial diversity with cul
tural diversity.
Race is a physical thing. Race has noth
ing to do with culture. If it did, blacks in
Africa and blacks in America would have
everything in common. But in reality
they have very little in common. Affirma
tive action may physically diversify a cam
pus population based on skin tone, but it
may not diversify campus culture as
much as an institution thinks. And it cer
tainly doesn't diversify the political views
of its students. It goes without saying, but
affirmative action tends to promote only
one type of ideology: the liberal one.
3. It helps rich blacks the most.
Families that have more money usual
ly have an advantage, regardless of skin
color. Many of the black students I have
met at Stanford do not come from poor
inner city areas. Though affirmative ac
tion was designed to help minority stu
dents who need it the most, in reality it
can help those who need it the least.
Wealthier minority students tend to go to
better schools, pay for SAT tutoring and
possess many, if not all, of the same ad
vantages that wealthy white students do.
They are the premier beneficiaries of af
firmative action, not poor struggling mi
norities.

4. It's divisive.
I am the first to admit that racism still
exists in this country, but to the credit of
the Civil Rights Movement and subse
quent legislation, racism has been drasti
cally reduced in the last 40 years. Yet pro
ponents of affirmative action will always
claim that there is a disproportionate
amount of racism thriving today. The
most serious advocates make their livings
painting divisive, morose pictures of
America. Jesse Jackson is one of those
people. Though no one can scientifically
prove how much racism still exists, it's
hard to argue that racism today comes
close to the same inequalities it did prior
to the 19605.
5. It uses racism to fight racism.
It is impossible to end racism with
racist policy. Because affirmative action is
race-based, it always keeps the issue of
race in the forefront. This seems to anger
people more than anything else. In my
opinion, using reverse racism to get
ahead is not much better than using tra
ditional racism to get ahead. Yes, blacks
and other minorities have suffered injus
tices due to racism, but their use of affir
mative action employs the same level of
racism as the traditional establishment
they oppose. The best way to end racism
is not to keep race in the vanguard, but to
rise above race and demonstrate that we
are all human beings. If anything is pro
pelling racism and resentment right now
in this country, it's affirmative action.
Socioeconomic affirmative action is a
better choice.
I believe that the color that gives
you the most advantage in this country
is green. Skin color is incomparable to
financial wealth. Families with more
money have more advantage, regard
less of one's skin pigmentation. Affir
mative action policy should be
changed to help only those who come
from low-income families, because
those families are most deserving. So
cioeconomic affirmative action is race
blind, so it would eliminate using re
verse racism to select people. The
credibility of those aided by socioeco
nomic affirmative action would not be
constantly challenged, as many cur
rent minority students are, because
family income usually remains private
information.
Finally, socioeconomic affirmative
action still helps a great deal of minority
students, particularly blacks and Lati
nos, because a significant portion of
these groups tend to live in poorer
areas. The best part of socioeconomic
affirmative action is that it eliminates
the element of racism while still helping
the least advantaged. That should be
everybody's goal.

2. It confuses racial diversity with cul
tural diversity.
Race is a physical thing. Race has noth
ing to do with culture. If it did, blacks in
Africa and blacks in America would have
everything in common. But in reality
they have very little in common. Affirma
tive action may physically diversify a cam
pus population based on skin tone, but it
may not diversify campus culture as
much as an institution thinks. And it cer
tainly doesn't diversify the political views
of its students. It goes without saying, but
affirmative action tends to promote only
one type of ideology: the liberal one.
3. It helps rich blacks the most.
Families that have more money usual
ly have an advantage, regardless of skin
color. Many of the black students I have
met at Stanford do not come from poor
inner city areas. Though affirmative ac
tion was designed to help minority stu
dents who need it the most, in reality it
can help those who need it the least.
Wealthier minority students tend to go to
better schools, pay for SAT tutoring and
possess many, if not all, of the same ad
vantages that wealthy white students do.
They are the premier beneficiaries of af
firmative action, not poor struggling mi
norities.

4. It's divisive.
I am the first to admit that racism still
exists in this country, but to the credit of
the Civil Rights Movement and subse
quent legislation, racism has been drasti
cally reduced in the last 40 years. Yet pro
ponents of affirmative action will always
claim that there is a disproportionate
amount of racism thriving today. The
most serious advocates make their livings
painting divisive, morose pictures of
America. Jesse Jackson is one of those
people. Though no one can scientifically
prove how much racism still exists, it's
hard to argue that racism today comes
close to the same inequalities it did prior
to the 19605.
5. It uses racism to fight racism.
It is impossible to end racism with
racist policy. Because affirmative action is
race-based, it always keeps the issue of
race in the forefront. This seems to anger
people more than anything else. In my
opinion, using reverse racism to get
ahead is not much better than using tra
ditional racism to get ahead. Yes, blacks
and other minorities have suffered injus
tices due to racism, but their use of affir
mative action employs the same level of
racism as the traditional establishment
they oppose. The best way to end racism
is not to keep race in the vanguard, but to
rise above race and demonstrate that we
are all human beings. If anything is pro
pelling racism and resentment right now
in this country, it's affirmative action.
Socioeconomic affirmative action is a
better choice.
I believe that the color that gives
you the most advantage in this country
is green. Skin color is incomparable to
financial wealth. Families with more
money have more advantage, regard
less of one's skin pigmentation. Affir
mative action policy should be
changed to help only those who come
from low-income families, because
those families are most deserving. So
cioeconomic affirmative action is race
blind, so it would eliminate using re
verse racism to select people. The
credibility of those aided by socioeco
nomic affirmative action would not be
constantly challenged, as many cur
rent minority students are, because
family income usually remains private
information.
Finally, socioeconomic affirmative
action still helps a great deal of minority
students, particularly blacks and Lati
nos, because a significant portion of
these groups tend to live in poorer
areas. The best part of socioeconomic
affirmative action is that it eliminates
the element of racism while still helping
the least advantaged. That should be
everybody's goal.
