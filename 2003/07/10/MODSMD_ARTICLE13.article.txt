## Populists aren't as revolutionary as they would like us to think 
### 
American democracy has re
duced a once revolutionary
stance into an aggressive
attitude, making populism as vi
ciously recurring as herpes in
politics.
It used to be that the great
mass of people lived in stark
servitude. Once in a great while,
the oppressed would express
their massive indignation at
their oppressors through orga
nized violence; that is, through
revolution. But revolutions
were only the most overt con
frontations in an ongoing strug
gle for power.
More frequent than acts of re
volt were words and gestures of
personal rebellion. In private,
farmers cursed kings, slaves per
formed mock executions of mas
ters, and sometimes, the private
spilled into the public: provoca
teurs authored pamphlets, de
laced statues, dumped pounds of
tea. The language of revolt ex
pressed a shared sense of oppres
sion. However, this language was
more than expressive: it defined
the "us" and the "them," and pre
ceded and organized revolution
ary acts.
There hasn't been a revolu
tion in America for some time,
yet our political speech hasn't
lost the rhetoric of revolt. Con
sider the recurring battle cry
"Freedom." It's certain that it's
freedom for us, but from whom?
In a country where everyone in
sists on being called the middle
class, in a political culture ruled
by the participatory majority,
who is the other?
Today's counterculture re
sounds with the revolutionary
songs of the past, uniting the
"common people" against op
pressive elites. The Simpsons are
an example of one of the more
playful jabs at the empowered:
celebrating the mock-heroic
American family while lampoon
ing such figures as the liver-spot-

ted lonely mil
lionaire Burns
and the woman
izing slimy
politician Quim
by. Unfortunate
ly, most of our
counterculture
falls short of
playful.

Best-selling author, award
winning director and populist
bully Michael Moore doesn't
bother with creative eu
phemism when he blames the
"Stupid White Men" for every
thing from the recession to the
AIDS epidemic and beseeches
Koffi Annan: "These Stupid
White Men must be stopped.
Demand that new, clean elec
tions be held, Give the junta
forty-eight hours to agree and
then, if they don't, then treat
them to a U.S. Air Force-style
laser light show!"
Blaming the stupid white men,
who have lumbered our Eden,
Moore's drama casts Americans in
the morally familiar roles of crim
inals and victims. Certainly this
world has crime, and there are
criminals. However, not all death
is murder. The difficult but neces
sary insight is found in a poem:
the same time that we call living,
can be called dying, and while
there are reliefs and distractions,
there will be no solution.
The world is full of arbitrary
suffering, and at the core of every
political ideology there is a stance
if not an answer to the question:
"What to do? What do we do
about the human suffering?"
The populists offer the most
brutal answer — the same that
primitive society is based on —
Justice. The logic goes: if you're
in pain, then you're a victim;
and given victims, there are
criminals.
The populist offers a promise:
"My people, these criminals will
be brought to justice, and I, the

compass needle of your outrage,
will behead them (or treat them
to a U.S. Air Force style laser light
show)." Power is legitimized by its
promise to right the moral
wrongs.
Throughout history, especial
ly during hard economic times,
populists have postured as revo
lutionaries by vilifying elites and
promising to right the wrongs
against the peoples. The Great
Depression was a feast for men
like Huey Long, a Louisiana gov
ernor turned senator, who made
a career of playing on the public's
discontent. He was elected after
promising to provide every
needy family with a $5,000

stipend by taking a little from the
rich; meanwhile a contemporary
in Germany began shutting
down businesses and redistribut
ing the property of a notoriously
miserly few.
The danger of populist
thought is relevant in the short
term because our own recession
might continue while the distrac
tions abroad might not, inviting
the ascendancy of those with easy
answers. Then it will be the job of
the scholars, poets and unem
ployed entrepreneurs to lead a
real revolt of tragic conscience.
More likely, however, the dis
tractions abroad won't cease, and
this will remain only a support

ing column in a greater critical
structure.
Politics is a discussion
prompted by insistent questions
that the sensitive of each genera
tion must ask. One of those ques
tions is "Why do we suffer?" This
week was a critique of the pop
ulist answer. Next week will be
devoted to the progressives' an
swer to a related question: "Will
it get better?"

American democracy has re
duced a once revolutionary
stance into an aggressive
attitude, making populism as vi
ciously recurring as herpes in
politics.
It used to be that the great
mass of people lived in stark
servitude. Once in a great while,
the oppressed would express
their massive indignation at
their oppressors through orga
nized violence; that is, through
revolution. But revolutions
were only the most overt con
frontations in an ongoing strug
gle for power.
More frequent than acts of re
volt were words and gestures of
personal rebellion. In private,
farmers cursed kings, slaves per
formed mock executions of mas
ters, and sometimes, the private
spilled into the public: provoca
teurs authored pamphlets, de
laced statues, dumped pounds of
tea. The language of revolt ex
pressed a shared sense of oppres
sion. However, this language was
more than expressive: it defined
the "us" and the "them," and pre
ceded and organized revolution
ary acts.
There hasn't been a revolu
tion in America for some time,
yet our political speech hasn't
lost the rhetoric of revolt. Con
sider the recurring battle cry
"Freedom." It's certain that it's
freedom for us, but from whom?
In a country where everyone in
sists on being called the middle
class, in a political culture ruled
by the participatory majority,
who is the other?
Today's counterculture re
sounds with the revolutionary
songs of the past, uniting the
"common people" against op
pressive elites. The Simpsons are
an example of one of the more
playful jabs at the empowered:
celebrating the mock-heroic
American family while lampoon
ing such figures as the liver-spot-

ted lonely mil
lionaire Burns
and the woman
izing slimy
politician Quim
by. Unfortunate
ly, most of our
counterculture
falls short of
playful.

Best-selling author, award
winning director and populist
bully Michael Moore doesn't
bother with creative eu
phemism when he blames the
"Stupid White Men" for every
thing from the recession to the
AIDS epidemic and beseeches
Koffi Annan: "These Stupid
White Men must be stopped.
Demand that new, clean elec
tions be held, Give the junta
forty-eight hours to agree and
then, if they don't, then treat
them to a U.S. Air Force-style
laser light show!"
Blaming the stupid white men,
who have lumbered our Eden,
Moore's drama casts Americans in
the morally familiar roles of crim
inals and victims. Certainly this
world has crime, and there are
criminals. However, not all death
is murder. The difficult but neces
sary insight is found in a poem:
the same time that we call living,
can be called dying, and while
there are reliefs and distractions,
there will be no solution.
The world is full of arbitrary
suffering, and at the core of every
political ideology there is a stance
if not an answer to the question:
"What to do? What do we do
about the human suffering?"
The populists offer the most
brutal answer — the same that
primitive society is based on —
Justice. The logic goes: if you're
in pain, then you're a victim;
and given victims, there are
criminals.
The populist offers a promise:
"My people, these criminals will
be brought to justice, and I, the

compass needle of your outrage,
will behead them (or treat them
to a U.S. Air Force style laser light
show)." Power is legitimized by its
promise to right the moral
wrongs.
Throughout history, especial
ly during hard economic times,
populists have postured as revo
lutionaries by vilifying elites and
promising to right the wrongs
against the peoples. The Great
Depression was a feast for men
like Huey Long, a Louisiana gov
ernor turned senator, who made
a career of playing on the public's
discontent. He was elected after
promising to provide every
needy family with a $5,000

stipend by taking a little from the
rich; meanwhile a contemporary
in Germany began shutting
down businesses and redistribut
ing the property of a notoriously
miserly few.
The danger of populist
thought is relevant in the short
term because our own recession
might continue while the distrac
tions abroad might not, inviting
the ascendancy of those with easy
answers. Then it will be the job of
the scholars, poets and unem
ployed entrepreneurs to lead a
real revolt of tragic conscience.
More likely, however, the dis
tractions abroad won't cease, and
this will remain only a support

ing column in a greater critical
structure.
Politics is a discussion
prompted by insistent questions
that the sensitive of each genera
tion must ask. One of those ques
tions is "Why do we suffer?" This
week was a critique of the pop
ulist answer. Next week will be
devoted to the progressives' an
swer to a related question: "Will
it get better?"
