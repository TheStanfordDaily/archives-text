## Stanford track sparkles in Sacramento 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field squads
both outperformed their rankings at
the NCAA track and field champi
onships in Sacramento on June 11-14.
Entering the meet ranked 10th, the
Cardinal women compiled 27 points to fin
ish in ninth place. The then-No. 11 men
garnered 30 points to finish in seventh.
On the men's side, Arkansas took
home its 38th NCAA championship in
track and field or cross country under
coach John McDonnell — although it
marked the Razorbacks' first outdoor
track title since 1999. The LSU women
took home their 13th NCAA. Outdoor
title since 1987.
The Cardinal did not return to the
Farm empty-handed, bringing back 11
Ail-Americans and three NCAA individ
ual titles.
Despite being the two-time defend
ing 5,000 NCAA champion in that
event, senior Lauren Fleshman entered
the her final collegiate 5,000 as the un
derdog to North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan, the defending NCAA cross
country champion.
But nothing could stop Fleshman
from winning her third consecutive
5,000-meter title as she traversed the
400-meter oval 12.5 times in an NCAA
meet record 15 minutes, 24.06 seconds.
"The plan was to cover all the bases
during the race," said Fleshman, who
ends her collegiate career as a five-time
NCAA Champion and 14-time Ail-

American. "When someone made a
move, the plan was to keep pace and
continue to be fresh fora strong finish."
Freshman teammate Alicia Craig
made her own mark at the meet, claiming
her first NCAA, title by winning the
10,000 in a school record 32:40.03, de
spite it being only her second 10,000 ever.
"This was a wonderful race," Craig
said. "I tried to sit back in a good pace
and be patient. This was a solid group of
runners, but I was confident that I could
run with them."
For the men, junior Grant Robison
capped a tremendous season with an
NCAA title at the 1,500. Robison kicked
hard with 300 meters to go and hung on
to outlast Arkansas's Chris Mulvanev in
the final meters of the race.
"With 300 meters to go, I thought 'it's
now or never, " Robison said. "I
couldn't hear Chris (Mulvaney) down
the stretch, but I could hear the crowd,
so I knew the race was going to be close.
Robison is Stanford's third NCAA
1,500 meter champion in the last four
years. Olympian Gabe Jennings won in
2000, while Cardinal junior Don Sage
claimed the title over Arkansas' Mul
vaney last year.
Cardinal athletes also broke two ad
ditional school records while earning
Ail-American honors.
Senior Malindi Elmore broke the
great Regina Jacobs' long-standing
school record in the 1,500, as she fin
ished eighth with a time of 4:11.67.
The womens' 1,500 was one of the
fastest ever in collegiate history, as Mis

sissippi State sophomore 1 iffam
MtWilliams took the field through a
blazing first 800 and then went on to set
an NCAA record herself by winning in
4:0b.75 over the heavily favored UCLA
star, Lena Nilsson.
Performing in front of her home crowd,
the Sacramento native junior Jillian Ca
marena, set a school record in the outdoor
shot put to accompany the indoor record
she set at the Indoor National Champi
onships back in March.
Her distance of 57 feet, 4.75 inches
was good enough for third and her sec
ond All-American title of the meet. She
also earned All-America honors with
her ninth place finish in the discus.
The men had an additional six All-
Americans, led by junior Louis Luchini's
runner-up performance in the men's
5,000.
Luchini pushed Arkansas's Alistair
Cragg, arguably the most versatile dis
tance runner in the NCA\, to his limit
and came up just short of his first NCAA
title. Luchini finished in 13:49.81 to
Cragg's 13:47.87.
Junior Seth Hejny also had a spectac
ular showing in the 5,000, finishing
fourth in 13:52.27.
Sophomore lan Dobson ran a per
sonal-best in the 10,000 to finish fifth in
28:32.23, while teammate senior Adam
Tenforde ended his career on a high
note, gaining an All-America title with a
seventh-place finish in a time of
28:37.65.

coach John McDonnell — although it
marked the Razorbacks' first outdoor
track title since 1999. The LSU women
took home their 13th NCAA. Outdoor
title since 1987.
The Cardinal did not return to the
Farm empty-handed, bringing back 11
Ail-Americans and three NCAA individ
ual titles.
Despite being the two-time defend
ing 5,000 NCAA champion in that
event, senior Lauren Fleshman entered
the her final collegiate 5,000 as the un
derdog to North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan, the defending NCAA cross
country champion.
But nothing could stop Fleshman
from winning her third consecutive
5,000-meter title as she traversed the
400-meter oval 12.5 times in an NCAA
meet record 15 minutes, 24.06 seconds.
"The plan was to cover all the bases
during the race," said Fleshman, who
ends her collegiate career as a five-time
NCAA Champion and 14-time Ail-

American. "When someone made a
move, the plan was to keep pace and
continue to be fresh fora strong finish."
Freshman teammate Alicia Craig
made her own mark at the meet, claiming
her first NCAA, title by winning the
10,000 in a school record 32:40.03, de
spite it being only her second 10,000 ever.
"This was a wonderful race," Craig
said. "I tried to sit back in a good pace
and be patient. This was a solid group of
runners, but I was confident that I could
run with them."
For the men, junior Grant Robison
capped a tremendous season with an
NCAA title at the 1,500. Robison kicked
hard with 300 meters to go and hung on
to outlast Arkansas's Chris Mulvanev in
the final meters of the race.
"With 300 meters to go, I thought 'it's
now or never, " Robison said. "I
couldn't hear Chris (Mulvaney) down
the stretch, but I could hear the crowd,
so I knew the race was going to be close.
Robison is Stanford's third NCAA
1,500 meter champion in the last four
years. Olympian Gabe Jennings won in
2000, while Cardinal junior Don Sage
claimed the title over Arkansas' Mul
vaney last year.
Cardinal athletes also broke two ad
ditional school records while earning
Ail-American honors.
Senior Malindi Elmore broke the
great Regina Jacobs' long-standing
school record in the 1,500, as she fin
ished eighth with a time of 4:11.67.
The womens' 1,500 was one of the
fastest ever in collegiate history, as Mis

sissippi State sophomore 1 iffam
MtWilliams took the field through a
blazing first 800 and then went on to set
an NCAA record herself by winning in
4:0b.75 over the heavily favored UCLA
star, Lena Nilsson.
Performing in front of her home crowd,
the Sacramento native junior Jillian Ca
marena, set a school record in the outdoor
shot put to accompany the indoor record
she set at the Indoor National Champi
onships back in March.
Her distance of 57 feet, 4.75 inches
was good enough for third and her sec
ond All-American title of the meet. She
also earned All-America honors with
her ninth place finish in the discus.
The men had an additional six All-
Americans, led by junior Louis Luchini's
runner-up performance in the men's
5,000.
Luchini pushed Arkansas's Alistair
Cragg, arguably the most versatile dis
tance runner in the NCA\, to his limit
and came up just short of his first NCAA
title. Luchini finished in 13:49.81 to
Cragg's 13:47.87.
Junior Seth Hejny also had a spectac
ular showing in the 5,000, finishing
fourth in 13:52.27.
Sophomore lan Dobson ran a per
sonal-best in the 10,000 to finish fifth in
28:32.23, while teammate senior Adam
Tenforde ended his career on a high
note, gaining an All-America title with a
seventh-place finish in a time of
28:37.65.
