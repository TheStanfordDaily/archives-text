Competing against the test gym
nasts in the country, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team's Ail-Americans w ere
almost perfect at the USA Champi
onships in Madison, Wisconsin.
Senior Dave Durante and junior
Dan (.ill earned spots on the U.S. Se
nior National Team. For their efforts.
Durante and Gill were selected to the
squad competing at the Pan-American
Games in the Dominican Republic.
"I was thrilled," Gill said. "This is a
goal I've been working for my entire
life."
Gill, who fell short of an Ail-Amer
ican title in this year's NCAA all
around finals, came back in full-force
during off-season competition, plac
ing sixth at the Championship Quali
fier before earning his spot on the se
nior national team.
"Dan's mental approach
changed," coach Thom Glielmi said.
"He understood that he needed to hit
the routines — and not just feel like
he could hit them — in practice. He
did all the work he needed to do."

Gill also placed fifth on the vault
and sixth on the floor exercise.
"I just needed time with Thorn's
training program," Gill said. "It was
the first time I put a full meet togeth
er in a long time. I think my consis
tency is going to continue to im
prove."
After falling on the first event of
the first day of competition, Durante
went on to hit his next 11 routines
and keep his spot on the senior na
tional team.
"I fell a little short on the dis
mount, but I was by no means out of
it," Durante said. "We were very well
prepared."
Known for his clean style and exe
cution, Durante finished fourth on
high-bar and sixth on the pommel
horse.
"Dave really improved his confi
dence in his gymnastics," Glielmi said.
" He's always been able to do a lot of
good skills and execute really well, but
his confidence has gone up this year."
Capping off a great weekend for
Stanford was senior Marshall Erwin's
tie for top honors on the still rings.
Erwin's score of 9.825 tied two-time

Olympian Blaine Wilson and defeat
ed Penn State's Kevin Tan, who
edged Erwin — the 2002 NCAA
rings champion — for the ring title at
the NCAA Event Finals earlier this
year.
"It was one of, if not the best rou
tine I've ever done." Erwin said. "I ac
complished all my goals with it."
Erwin hasn't decided if he will con
tinue training now that his collegiate
career is over.
"I'll be having fun in the gym fora
while before I decide if I'll compete at
Winter Cup," he said.
Clielmi, who was named the U.S.
head coach for the Pan-American
games, has directly coached four of
the athletes on the squad. Joining Du
rante and Oill in the Dominican Re
public will be former Stanford club
gymnast Sho Nakamori and Clay
Sthrother, coached by Clielmi to four
NCAA titles at the University of Min
nesota.
"This is a huge meet," Clielmi said.
"To some countries, the Pan-Ameri
can games is bigger than the

Olympics."
"We have our sight-s set at Pan-
Ams," (iill said of his first interna
tional competition. "We think we
can win it."
