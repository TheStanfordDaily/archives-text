# Disney's "Pirates" steal the gold, and the show
## 
### ALIA MOORE 
Disney has made one hell of a
comeback alter the painful em
barrassment of "The Country
Bears," bursting into the sum
mer scene with "Pirates of the
Caribbean: The Curse of the
Black Pearl," a perfect film for
the season.
Since this is, at its core, a Dis
ney flick, you will have to sit
through the blatant unfolding of
a hit-you-over-the-head moral
and an ultimately boring roman
tic side story. Having said that,
sitting through this fluff is al
most painless, since the rest of
the movie is so much damn fun.
Disney fans will be quick to
spot the perfectly placed
scenes stolen from the ride that
inspired the film-from cavort
ing drunkards and wenches to
jailed men coaxing a dog that
holds the keys to their cell. The
cartoonish, raucous feel of the
ride is carried over into the
film as well, and with good re
sults.
Screenwriters Ted Elliott and
Terry Rossio have been most
noted for their work with ani
mated features (think "Shrek"),
and the over-the-top characters
are wonderfully campy. Add to
that the fact that Jerry Bruck
heimer (who has never been
known to skimp on explosions)
produced this happily excessive
film and you have a purely rol
licking ride with some nasty pi
rates and a very creepy ancient
curse.

a ragged ship that always brings
fog into port with it, is connected

to stolen Aztec gold and some
very angry ancient gods. Lead
by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey
Rush), the filthy pirates that
crew the doomed ship have a
nasty habit of turning into
half-decomposed skeletons
whenever moonlight hits them.
This particular special effect
lends itself to some awesome
moments; the creators chose to
have fun with it rather than try
fora forced scariness, and it
works. One scene follows these
cursed pirates as they march on
the bottom of the sea, alternate
ly whole and skeletal but always

repugnantly freaky. The curse
has filled these buccaneers with
an insatiable greed, and they
loot mercilessly in anticipation
of the day the curse is lifted and
they can finally enjoy their
spoil.
When we meet these un
friendly fellows, they have
pulled into port and kidnapped
the governor's daughter (Keira
Knightley) in a case of mistaken
identity. They are pursued by
her would-be lover (Orlando
Bloom), the only one who can
truly lift the curse, and Captain
Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp),
the seemingly half-cracked pi
rate who used to command the
Pearl.
Captain Jack has motives of
his own; he was left to die on a
desert island by the crew of the
Pearl, where he luckily missed
out on the curse. But he's been
pretty hard up ever since. The
stereotypically uptight British
navy chases everyone, muddling

things with their prejudice
against pirates and their un
thinking adherence to the letter
of the law (which is part of the
Greater Moral-don't worry,
there's no chance you'll miss it).
Depp steals absolutely every
scene he is in, playing the Cap
tain perfectly. Any one else
would have made this role into
an annoyance, but Depp man
ages to be an utterly charming
rogue, no matter how crazy he
seems. You root for him even
when you're not sure which side
he's on.
"Pirates" runs a bit long, but
in the end it doesn't take away
from the fun of the movie as a
whole. With a story-line that is
less than groundbreaking and
plenty of super-cheesy mo
ments (especially between
Knightly and Bloom), this is not
necessarily a good movie. But
when it gets going, that doesn't
really matter-you're having way
too much fun to care.
