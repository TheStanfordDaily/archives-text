# "Terminator 3" doesn't "Rise" to the occasion

Arnold's hack. Well, sorta.
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," the
man who could be the next governor of Cali
fornia plays T-101, a more advanced version of
the terminator that was reprogrammed to pro
tect Sarah Connor and son after he tried to as
sassinate her in the original "Terminator."
Stick with me. This isn't "Mulholland Drive."
The noticeable difference in this movie is
that it's directed by Jonathan Mostow ("U
-571"). The first two were from James Cameron,
and those sci-fi motion pictures relied — as his
Oscar-winner, "Titanic" — on character devel
opment, first; the special effects were built
around the plot.

All that's lost in "Termi
nator 3," a shoot-'em up ac
tion movie that features
more explosions than the
latest "Charlie's Angels 2"
trailer.
Also missing from this
third spin around the block
is Linda Hamilton, who
played Sarah Connor with
palpable vulnerability and

served as the emotional center of the first two
films. (The character's ultimate fate is described
shoddily, and her tombstone is visited at an up
scale hideout that looks better suited for the sit
ting grounds of a Black Angus).
But that's not to say "Terminator 3" isn't an
intelligent, economical summer action movie.

In fact, Mostow knows his

ger is pitted against a
newer, more advanced ter
minator. She's as sexy as,
well, the supermodel who
plays her (Kristanna
Loken) — and struts
through her first scene as if
on a mission from Victo-

ria's Secret.
Schwarzenegger is supposed to protect John
Connor. She's supposed to kill him. You know
the drill.
