# "Terminator 3" doesn't "Rise" to the occasion
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Arnold's hack. Well, sorta.
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," the
man who could be the next governor of Cali
fornia plays T-101, a more advanced version of
the terminator that was reprogrammed to pro
tect Sarah Connor and son after he tried to as
sassinate her in the original "Terminator."
Stick with me. This isn't "Mulholland Drive."
The noticeable difference in this movie is
that it's directed by Jonathan Mostow ("U
-571"). The first two were from James Cameron,
and those sci-fi motion pictures relied — as his
Oscar-winner, "Titanic" — on character devel
opment, first; the special effects were built
around the plot.

All that's lost in "Termi
nator 3," a shoot-'em up ac
tion movie that features
more explosions than the
latest "Charlie's Angels 2"
trailer.
Also missing from this
third spin around the block
is Linda Hamilton, who
played Sarah Connor with
palpable vulnerability and

served as the emotional center of the first two
films. (The character's ultimate fate is described
shoddily, and her tombstone is visited at an up
scale hideout that looks better suited for the sit
ting grounds of a Black Angus).
But that's not to say "Terminator 3" isn't an
intelligent, economical summer action movie.

In fact, Mostow knows his
summer-blockbuster basics.
Actone: Schwarzeneg
ger is pitted against a
newer, more advanced ter
minator. She's as sexy as,
well, the supermodel who
plays her (Kristanna
Loken) — and struts
through her first scene as if
on a mission from Victo-

ria's Secret.
Schwarzenegger is supposed to protect John
Connor. She's supposed to kill him. You know
the drill.
Act two: We're reintroduced to an older,
wiser John Connor (Nick Stahl
from"In the Bedroom") —who at
first wanders the streets aimlessly.
He must, of course, have a love in
terest: Kate Brewster (Claire
Danes). And they must, of course,
fall in love - but slowly, so that the
Terminator may cleverly hint at
their future together.
Act three: The two terminators
face off in various locations —
pet shelters, gas stations, freeways.
Each time, John and Kate narrowly
escape from death ... and this leads
us to the end ... which I will not re
veal. But predictable, it's not. In
stead, die movie shifts gears and clos
es on a note diat's thoughtful and
sincere, and works on levels that you
would not expect from the throw
back nature of Mostow's direction.
There's a line of drama in a
movie of this nature that the actors
cannot cross. (For the far extreme,
see Nick Nolte's Shakespearean
soliloquy in"The Hulk.") Both
Stahl and Danes are capable and
likable in the lead roles, and they
manage to complement
Schwarzenegger nicely.
As for Loken, she is fine (no pun
intended) in the part of the
cold-blooded killer. But, at best,
her character is rough around the
edges. It's as if someone sawed her

into pieces and couldn't figure
out how to reassemble the parts -
namely, from the anti-heroes of
the first two "Terminator" films.
If James Cameron had been at
the helm (this time, the pun is
intentional), no doubt he would

have pushed the envelope further.
Not with explosions, per say, as
there are only a number of ways
you can blow a monster truck to
smithereens, but he would have
worked to develop the melodra
matic force of the material - with

suspense, with tension, with more
at stake, psychologically speaking.
"Terminator 3" works, but only
on the surface level: it's fun
and free-spirited, yet you leave the
theater with the feeling as if the
product is just a little too robotic.
