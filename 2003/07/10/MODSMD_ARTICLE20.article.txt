The Hulk
Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a long, lum
bering comic book movie that
swings around aimlessly like King
Kong lost in Central Park.
Lee doesn't seem to find the right tone
in the material. Is it a fun, throwaway sum
mer flick? An emotionally-charged ro
mance? A metaphor for the tortured
human spirit? It's all of the above, and the
result is a film that ambles too often.
The performances fall apart. Bana is
quiet and reserved, as he intends to suggest
the character of the outcast scientist. And
Connelly is even more low-key here than at
her acceptance speech at the Oscars in
2002. Because of this, and a narrowly flat
screenplay by an army of scribes (headed
by John Turman), the human element of
the story is never properly developed, nor
does it give the logical setup to the action
sequences that follow.
Rather, the most inventive element of
the film lies in the cinematography, which
uses the split screen to suggest the multi
layered pictorial representations in comic
book art.
Lee tries to marry the art film with the ac
tion film, without giving us enough context
for either. "The Hulk" is an odd hybrid, and
at a hefty 137 minutes, it's too long and too
indulgent for its own scaly skin.

Charlie's Angels 2
itkitCi
The second installment of the Charlie's An
gels series, "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,"
seems to follow a formula that works...and
why shouldn't it? Starring Cameron Diaz
(Natalie), Drew Barrymore (Dylan), and
Lucy Liu (Alex), the movie chronicles the An
gels' efforts to retrieve encrypted rings that
hold the names of all Federal Witness Prote
ction Program participants.
Essentially, three hot girls in cool clothes
kick butt and rid the world of evil.
If you're looking fora challenging mys
tery, look somewhere else. While the movie
tries to keep us in suspense as to who the
big bad criminal is, we all know from the
trailers and the heavy publicity that Demi
Moore plays a "fallen angel" mastermind
ing the caper. We are never really awed by
the Angels' crime solving skills because the
plot is not the movie's strong point.
Nevertheless, despite plot weakness,
the script is infused with enough humor to
keep it from degenerating to a"The Fast
and the Furious" level of Hollywood
movie-making. While it delivers superficial
Hollywood fun, it does so in a tongue-in
cheek way, so that the audience can laugh,
rather than gag, at the over-the-top scenes.
Overall, "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"
delivers on what it promises - Don't take the
movie too seriously, and enjoy the ride.

28 days Later
In a summer dominated by big-budget
spectaculars the British zombie flick
"28 Days Later" is a delicious piece of
counter-programming from director
Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Gar
land. Made fora fraction of its competitors'
budgets and shot on grainy digital video,
this is one of the most terrifying films that
I've ever seen.
Sure, "28 Days Later" has relatively few
moments of genuine originality, but Gar
land and Boyle combine their influences so
intelligently and effectively that it's hard to
care.
Their message: civilization is a fragile
construct that could topple at any moment,
a point that the filmmakers make with cre
ativity and wit, if not subtlety.
If there's anything to complain about in
"28 Days Later", it's that Boyle and Gar
land are, ultimately, too sentimental to
match the bleakness and claustrophobia of
"Night of the Living Dead". The extraordi
narily draining and disturbing final se
quence seems headed towards an ending
that cleverly echoes "Night'"s, but instead
the film pulls back from the abyss, deliver
ing a finale that's feels false and too cozy.
Thankfully, this letdown can't erase the
horrors (and small human triumphs) that
we've already witnessed.

Alex and Emma
☆☆☆☆
In Rob Reiner's romantic comedy "Alex
and Emma," Alex (Luke Wilson) and
Emma (Kate Hudson) fall in love. But
I don't buy it. I also wouldn't buy the semi
autobiography posing as a novel that Alex
is writing with the assistance, or should I
say, complaints, of stenographer Kate in
his apartment in Boston.
Alex has an outstanding gambling loan
and two oddly fashionable Cuban thugs
make it clear that Alex will die unless he
pays them back the money he borrowed.
Moved by this surely fatal situation, Alex
consults with his publisher Wirschafter
(Rob Reiner) who agrees to pay off the debt
if Alex finishes his book in thirty days. So
Alex hires Emma to help him with the task
as he will dictate the whole book in the
comfort of his bachelor pad.
As Alex talks and Emma types, his
novel is brought to life in Gatsby-like
fashion. It's a tale of poor tutor Adam
(Wilson) lusting after his students' exotic
mother, Polina (Sophie Marceau). The
period set and stylish clothes are beauti
ful, as is the talented Marceau who steals
every scene she's in.
I won't give away the end, but I'm sure
you could place a winning bet on who gets
.\lex, which is exactly why I wouldn't rec
ommend "Alex and Emma" to anyone.
