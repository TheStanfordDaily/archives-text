# "Harry Potter" goes to pot
## 
### ILENA GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
J.K. Rowling's fifth and latest
installment in the Harry Potter
series, Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix, continues
the trends of its prequels; it's twice
as long as the fourth Harry Potter
novel — and at least twice as dark.
While much of Phoenix (and
there is so much of it) is extreme
ly enjoyable, and seems to build
toward some amazing ending, the
novel does not make good on its
promises and ultimately falls flat.
Although their film counter
parts beat them to it, Harry and
friends have entered the magical
realm of puberty, definitively
moving the series from the genre
of children's novels to that of
young adult. While we are, thank
fully, spared any painful mo
ments of recognizing the changes
that come with this special time in
life, we get instead a bleaker view
of the wizarding world than Rowl
ing had afforded us before. The
novel probes into the world
Harry inhabits, particularly into
its institutions and those in charge
of them, and it's not a pretty pic
ture.
Pessimistic storyline aside,
Rowling can be counted on for
continuity, and all your favorite
characters are up to their usual hi

jinx, although some are worse for
the wear. The characters have
gotten older and the stakes have
been raised higher than ever in
this novel. Within the first several
pages, Harry faces expulsion
from Hogwarts and Dudley's soul
is nearly sucked out of him. To
wards the middle of the novel, a
group of students decide the
times are threatening enough to
start taking private lessons from
Harry on how to defend them
selves from the varieties of evil
that lurk in their world. And while
death has always been a recurring
theme in the series, it now moves
towards center stage. Through
out the book, Harry attempts to
cope with the events of Harry Pot
ter and the Goblet of Fire, in par
ticular, his classmate Cedric Dig
gory's death and his own torture
at the hands of Lord Voldemort.
Be warned, Harry's no longer
the loveable eleven-year-old he
once was.
As one disgruntled Potter fan
said, "I hate that Harry's turned
into a whiny little bitch."
He's got to get a handle on sev
eral things in this novel: the fast
igniting temper he's developed,
his wild-fire hormones and the
continual burning of the scar
gracing his forehead. Ron, on the
other hand, is just as loveable, if
not more oblivious, and
Hermione is still as uptight as
ever.
Along with all our old fa
vorites, there are is a smorgas
bord of new characters that have
Rowling's distinctive touch. The
new Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge,
is a character you'll love to hate,
especially as she seeks to under
mine the operations of Hogwarts
in the name of the Ministry of
Magic.
The interference of the govern
ment in teaching is one of many so
cial issues Phoenix covers; one of the
book's drawbacks is that it's
crammed with social criticism that
was not found in the previous nov
els. A strong selling point of the se
ries has been its removal from the
"Muggle" world of everyday life; if 1
wanted to read about the govern
ments attempts to rectify degenera
cy in education or the implications
of the media's complicity with the
government I would look else
where.
Up until the last 100 or so
pages, the novel is suspenseful
and turbulent. Its fast-paced and
constant action is easy to get
hooked on. But the ending shat
ters your expectations . . . and

not in a good way.
While the other Harry Potter
novels are rife with unexpected
twists that keep you guessing
until the bitter end, it seems that
Rowling, has let us down this
time.
Phoenix retains Rowling's
characteristically intricate plots,
but there's no big secret to this
book; what you think will happen
probably does. Although the big
revelation towards the end of the
novel, that one would assume is
the reward for all the time spent
reading the 800-odd pages pre
ceding it, may be a shock to Harry
Potter, it's forehead — smacking
ly obvious to everyone else.
This new addition to the Potter
canon moves the series into well
trodden territory. It's now very
obviously a war of the good guys,
those belonging to the Order of
the Phoenix, against the bad
guys, Lord Voldemort's minions,
the Death Eaters.
With only two novels left to
go, as Rowling has promised to
cap the series at seven books
(spanning Harry's career at
Hogwarts), Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix ultimately
sacrifices itself to give the series a
big push towards that inevitable
final showdown. And though
finishing Phoenix feels like con
suming a feast of empty calories,
at the rate we're going Rowling
has at least 2000 more pages to
make it up to us.
