# "Harry Potter" goes to pot

### ILENA GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
J.K. Rowling's fifth and latest
installment in the Harry Potter
series, Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix, continues
the trends of its prequels; it's twice
as long as the fourth Harry Potter
novel â€” and at least twice as dark.
While much of Phoenix (and
there is so much of it) is extreme
ly enjoyable, and seems to build
toward some amazing ending, the
novel does not make good on its
promises and ultimately falls flat.
Although their film counter
parts beat them to it, Harry and
friends have entered the magical
realm of puberty, definitively
moving the series from the genre
of children's novels to that of
young adult. While we are, thank
fully, spared any painful mo
ments of recognizing the changes
that come with this special time in
life, we get instead a bleaker view
of the wizarding world than Rowl
ing had afforded us before. The
novel probes into the world
Harry inhabits, particularly into
its institutions and those in charge
of them, and it's not a pretty pic
ture.
Pessimistic storyline aside,
Rowling can be counted on for
continuity, and all your favorite
characters are up to their usual hi

jinx, although some are worse for
the wear. The characters have
gotten older and the stakes have
been raised higher than ever in
this novel. Within the first several
pages, Harry faces expulsion
from Hogwarts and Dudley's soul
is nearly sucked out of him. To
wards the middle of the novel, a
group of students decide the
times are threatening enough to
start taking private lessons from
Harry on how to defend them
selves from the varieties of evil
that lurk in their world. And while
death has always been a recurring
theme in the series, it now moves
towards center stage. Through
out the book, Harry attempts to
cope with the events of Harry Pot
ter and the Goblet of Fire, in par
ticular, his classmate Cedric Dig
gory's death and his own torture
at the hands of Lord Voldemort.
Be warned, Harry's no longer
the loveable eleven-year-old he
once was.
As one disgruntled Potter fan
said, "I hate that Harry's turned
into a whiny little bitch."
He's got to get a handle on sev
eral things in this novel: the fast
igniting temper he's developed,
his wild-fire hormones and the
continual burning of the scar
gracing his forehead. Ron, on the
