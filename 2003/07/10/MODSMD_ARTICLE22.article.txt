# "Blonde"s do have more fun...again

### LUANNE HERNANDEZ 
As a true Southern California
girl, I have to pledge my allegiance
to "Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &
Blonde." However, be warned,
unless you enjoyed the first in this
series, you may be bored out of
your mind. Though there are
many well-delivered funny and
silly moments in this movie, they
are not sufficient to keep the unin
terested awake for the entire nine
ty minutes.
The reason to watch this movie,
besides the outrageous costumes
and even more hilarious fashion
statements, is the naive, but inspira
tional attitude of File Woods (Reese
Witherspoon). By the end of the
movie, you, too, will be in love with
File and pledging her your full sup
port. Snaps to Reese Witherspoon,
who once again delivers a great per
formance as File Woods.
Although Witherspoon's
comedic performance is commend
able, the plot is just mediocre and
not at all credible. In the sequel,
Witherspoon plays a bleeding-heart
liberal who is desperately trying to
pass a bill to end all animal testing in
cosmetic laboratories.
The events that occur in order
to make it possible for Elle to gain
support for her bill are not at all
plausible and the plot does not

consume the audience enough to
make them turn a blind eye. In ad
dition, Elle's final speech is
lack-luster and the resolution of
the plot is abrupt and predictable.
However, Elle's naivete and
do-gooder attitude leaves the au
dience with warm fuzzies all over
and more than compensates for
the lack of a convincing plot.
As for the other actors in
"Blonde," they all do a great job
and definitely fit the characters
they play. Sally Field plays Con
gresswoman Victoria Rudd, a
shrewd politician who will do any
thing to stay in office. "Blonde"
gives Field the opportunity to play
both a heroine and a villain and
she does it splendidly.
Grace (Regina King) is Con
gresswoman Rudd's cold Chief of
Staff who immediately takes a dis
liking to File. King performs won
derfully as the straight woman in
this movie and is beautifully con
trasted with File, not only in per

sonality, but also in costumes.
Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge) is
simply hilarious and perfectly exe
cutes those one-liners. However,
her character lacks the charm she
had in the first movie and is instead
portrayed as a ditz in the sequel.
Paulette is not the only charac
ter whose role is changed in the se
quel. Emmett (Luke Wilson) is
rarely involved in the movie. He
plays a very small role and, honest
ly, I was a little disheartened. He
does not seem to play the same
person that he did in the first
movie, but is instead a much
warmer person, constantly giving
Elle support sans opinion or ac
tion.
The other reason to watch this
movie is the fashion. Prada and
various other designers created
Witherspoon's 90+ costumes. If
you look close enough, you will no
tice that Bruiser is wearing design
er accessories and clothing, includ
ing a diamond pendant necklace
valued over $1,000. Even when
dressed down, Elle is simply daz
zling in form-fitting jeans and
sparkling accessories such as a long
rainbow print scarf. And yes, her
signature color definitely plays a
big role in her costumes.
My suggestion: unless you
thought the first "Legally Blonde"
was worthy of your time, save your
money â€” the sequel does not out

shine the first film. It is also
through and through a chick flick
so be sure that you are in the mood
for seeing a lot of pink.
Besides, who can dislike a
movie with outfits that look like a
cross between Jackie Kennedy
and Barbie?
