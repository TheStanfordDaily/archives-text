# Spotlight on Stanford: OPM

### SUSAN YUN 
The name was inspired by
opium, but the letters stand fora
much more respectable pastime:
Opening People's Minds. Origi
nally formed in 1996 in Seatde and
currently based in Los Angeles,
OPM Comedy is an Asian Ameri
can sketch comedy group reminis
cent of" In Living Color" and "Sat
urday Night Live." The group,
which performs, writes, directs,
and produces its own material, has
a dual purpose. For the members,
it provides a forum to showcase
their talent and to perform a
breadth of material not often of
fered to them in mainstream
media. For the audience, it pro
vides a unique opportunity to ex
perience comedy centered around
Asian American life.
For Pearl Chen (Stanford '91), a
member of the OPM, the shows are
most fulfilling when people say
they had a great time at the show,
and that it was a unique experi
ence.
If we weren't doing what we
do, we wouldn't be able to see it be
cause it's not on TV. It's nice to be
able to show people that Asian
Americans can be funny, because
some people have the stereotype
that they can only be doctors or en

gineers-which aren't bad stereo
types, but..."
Even positive stereotypes can be
burdens.
The group, unique in its con
cept and material, has been a hit,
and their success is apparent in
their track record. Not only do
they typically sell out every show,
the group has also won coveted
awards at both the FringeFest in
San Francisco and the Sketch Off
Festival competition in Vancouver.
Perhaps some of their success
lies in the rigor the group applies
to their material and cast. All pro
posed skits are incorporated into
shows only after majority votes ap
prove them. In addition, the cast
members, all who have passed an
audition process, possess a variety
of acting and writing experience.
And, like "In Living Color," a pri
marily African American sketch
comedy show that introduced Jim
Carrey, the group is also diverse
ethnically; although primarily
Asian American, many cast mem
bers are multi-racial, and a couple
are non-Asian.
The show itself also appeals to a
broad demographic. While Chen
notes that much of the audience is
Asian American, overall, the peo
ple come from diverse back
grounds, drawn to the uniqueness

of the show. It's no wonder the
OPM Comedy group is a hit, since
it fills a void in today's entertain
ment spectrum.
Despite the current dearth of
interesting roles for Asian Ameri
can actors, however, Chen is opti
mistic that more opportunities are
being created for Asian Americans
in entertainment.
"Today, the biggest obstacle is
the sheer numbers of Asian Amer
icans vying fora handful of roles,"
she said. "The competition for act
ing and writing is extremely fierce.
But the more Asian Americans
start to write, the less stereotypical
the roles will be. It is more about
creating your own opportunities,
rather than letting obstacles get in
your way."
Indeed, Asian Americans are
slowly gaining greater (non-stereo
typical) exposure in mainstream
media, and films such as MTV's
Better Luck Tomorrow have
demonstrated just how profitable
Asian American projects can be.
