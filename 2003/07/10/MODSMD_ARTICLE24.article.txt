# "Hulk" provides a smash on three systems
## video game review 
### ERIC FORD 
When it comes to video games,
it's an understood truth that good
games based on movies are rare to
find. Most have potential, but they
end up being released long before
they are polished.
"The Incredible Hulk" is one of
the few movie-based games that
break out of this mold. With de
cent visuals, sound, and gameplay,
it's a game that would make the
movie industry proud. It's not ex
actly a gaming gem.
Released in conjunction with
the movie currendy in theaters,
"Hulk" takes place after the film
and centers around mild-man
nered Bruce Banner's adventures.
This has been done recendy with
other movie-based video games as
a way tell an interesting story and
not ruin the film for those that
haven't seen it.
For those of you unfamiliar with
the Marvel comic, whenever Bruce
gets pissed off he turns into the
Hulk, a big, green, fighting ma
chine who likes to break stuff. The
movie features missions that have
you playing as the Hulk, smashing
everything in sight and pummel
ing your enemies, or as Banner,
where you are sent on sneaky mis
sions that have you trying to avoid
enemies.

Playing as the Hulk is a really
cool experience. The player gets
two attack buttons: one for ranged
attacks and one for close attacks.
By using a combination of these
buttons you can pull off pretty cool
combinations that are fun to
watch.
A great deal of the environment
is interactive in that you usually
have to destroy walls and doors to
reach your objective; what's left be
hind makes a pretty good weapon
for the Hulk to pick up and smash.
There is also the inclusion of a
"rage meter" that increases every
time Hulk hits something. When it
reaches its max, you can pull off
some cool special movies that can
take out an entire room. With all
these different moves, there's defi
nitely some room for finesse, and it
looks really incredible.
When playing as Bruce, your
objective usually consists of avoid
ing enemies and sneaking around.
If you are ever caught, you are
hardly given a chance to redeem
yourself and continue, due in part
to the fact that the combat system
as Bruce is incredibly horrible.
You'll be lucky if you even hit an
enemy before they take you down.
The puzzle aspects of the missions
also get incredibly boring and te
dious. A typical puzzle consists of
gathering items and then return

ing to a start point or "hacking" a
computer, which is so easy it's not
even funny. The end result is that
these "breaks" between the Hulk
missions are more annoying than
anything else.
The visuals in"The Hulk" are
the game's strongest point. The
characters were created using a
variance on eel-shading, the latest
craze in the gaming industry. It
creates a cartoonish, comical feel
that seems appropriate for this
game. Hulk seems to glow when
he's on screen; you can see the
gamma radiation leaking off him.
My only complaint is that vari
ety in backgrounds is sorely lack
ing. Once you've been in a particu
lar level for five minutes, you've
pretty much seen all the back
ground there is to see.
Sound in this game is surpris
ingly mild. The voice-overs are
done well, and the sound effects
are pretty standard, but I just
didn't enjoy the music. Maybe it's
because some levels take a long
time and you end up hearing the
same little tune over and over (and
over and over...). When I'm play
ing a game, the music is pretty im
portant to me; luckily, in this one,
it wasn't. Leave the orchestrated
soundtracks for the RPGs, the stuff
in here works, although it could
have been better.
Overall, "The Hulk" is a great a
game for those fans of the comic
series, and a decent title for every
one else. It's a great game if you're
looking for some quick smash-'em
up action. It's available for the
three current systems, with the X
box having the best visuals, fol
lowed by the Gamecube, then
Playstation 2. Other than that,
there are no real changes between
platforms. There is some replaya
bility in the secret codes that you
can use to try out dilferent op
tions.
Although it has its flaws, as a
movie game, "The Hulk" is a great
step in the right direction.
