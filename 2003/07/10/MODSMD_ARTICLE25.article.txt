# DVD pick of the week

### 
"Punch-Drunk Love" is one of the oddest pairings in recent
cinematic history— Paul Thomas Anderson, the writer/direc
tor behind the sprawling melodrama "Magnolia", and Adam
Sandler, the star of "Big Daddy" and assorted other "Dude,
Where's My Brain?"-type comedies. And yeah, "Punch-Drunk
Love" feels extremely odd — but in a good way. It's also beau
tifully shot, touchingly acted and deliriously romantic; a career
high for both Anderson and Sandler.
Eccentric entrepreneur Barry Egan is a mournful, yearning
variation of the short-tempered outsider that Sandler has al
ways
played. Barry's shy, nervous exterior hides a simmering rage
that can boil to the surface, especially when he's confronted by
his seven shrewish sisters, leading to spectacularly violent out
bursts. All he needs, of course, is the love of a good woman —
in this case, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), whose sweet obses
sion with Barry would seem contrived if it didn't complement
his weirdness so perfectly.
At a lean 90 minutes, "Punch- Drunk Love" doesn't have a
wasted second of film. Anderson carefully constructs every
scene as an ever- tightening vise of anxiety, which ultimately
explodes in screwball violence or, later, touching romance. For
all his artiness and ironic satire, the director really does believe
in the love between his leading couple, and so do we.
While "Punch- Drunk Love" the movie is fabulous, the DVD
leaves much to be desired, as it forces you to fork over the cash
fora second DVD, which contains absolutely no interesting ma
terial. Here's hoping that a single-disc version goes on sale
soon.
