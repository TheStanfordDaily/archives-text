# "Tribe" back in stores with a hit
## 
### DOUGLAS WILSON 
Browsing my local record
store, I did a double-take on dis
covering that A Tribe Called
Quest has released a new album.
Oft lauded as one of the great
est hip-hop groups of all time,
Tribe was the legendary Bronx
trio on the forefront of the un
derground hip-hop scene from
1989 to 1998. Because members
Q-Tip, Phife Dog, and DJ Ali Sha
heed Muhammad have long
since parted ways in search of solo
careers, the new release comes as
quite a surprise.
The bad news is that Tribe is
not back together again. The
good news, however, is that the
release, "Hits, Rarities 8c Remix
es," (Jive Records) offers a cohe
sive collection of timeless hits and
quality remixes that should pro
vide a solid fix for beat-junkies
everywhere this summer.
Along with the advertised rar
ities and remixes, the album
showcases a well-selected variety
of the group's hits from the past
decade, including "Electric Re
laxation," "Award Tour," and
"Jazz (We've Got)." Not surpris
ingly, the album's greatest
strength is Tribe's classic sound:

raw, rolling beats, a heavily jazz
influenced groove, clever yet
subtle samples, and smooth
flowing lyrics. Newcomer s
and seasoned veterans alike will
also appreciate the refreshingly
down-to-earth lyrical content.
Partially in reaction to the in
creasing popularity of gangsta
rap, front-men Q-Tip and Phife
Dog largely keep their raps fo
cused and controlled, while si
multaneously setting a light, up
beat vibe. Best of all, Q-Tip's and
Phife Dog's senses of rhythm
and delivery are impeccable, re
minding us that spoken word is
indeed an effective instrument
in its own right.
Undoubtedly, the album's
largest shortcoming is the small
amount of new material. Twelve
out of the eighteen tracks appear
on the group's five major albums,
and two of those remaining six
("Glamour 8c Glitz" and "Peace,
Prosperity & Paper") are rarities
already available on other sound
tracks. In addition, the listing of
tracks is nearly identical to "An
thology," the group's previous
collection of hits.
Although this is disappoint
ing, especially for die-hard Tribe
fans, the two remixes and two

previously unreleased tracks
make the album worth the price
of admission, and yield a better
Tribe compilation than "Anthol
ogy." In particular, the opening
track, a new take on Midnight
Marauders classic "Oh My God,"
and the debut of the previously
unreleased "Mr. Incognito,"
both perfectly capture the trio's
quintessential jazzy sound and
tight flow.
Perhaps most importantly,
"Hits, Rarities & Remixes" serves
as a fantastic introduction to the
group for both seasoned rap fans
and newcomers to the hip-hop
scene. In fact, A Tribe Called
Quest has frequently been la
beled as the first hip-hop act to at
tract such a widely diverse fan
base, winning over fans of such
varying genres as rock, jazz, and
electronica.
All in all, this album is a must
buy for any music aficionado in
terested in discovering the re
warding sound of intelligent
hip-hop. And aspiring DJs, you
owe it to yourself to pick this re
lease up on vinyl. It would be
foolish indeed to pass up a col
lection of masterworks from
three of the greatest musicians
of our time.
