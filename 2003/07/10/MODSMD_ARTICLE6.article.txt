## Univ. affirmative action unaffected by ruling 
### ERIC ELDON ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
The U.S. Supreme Court's two rulings
on affirmative action last month both mir
rored and reinforced Stanford's own ad
missions policies, according to University
administrators.
The decisions came after months of de
bate nationwide and on campus, including
rallies, a pro-affirmative action bake sale,
pro-affirmative action statements by Uni
versity President John Hennessy and other
administrators, supported by the ASSU.
Around 30 members of the Students of
Color Coalition and Stanford's chapter of
the National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People went to Washing
ton, D.C. on April 1 to rally for affirmative
action in front of the Supreme Court as the
justices heard the case inside.
"We are very pleased the Supreme
Court has affirmed the principle articulat
ed by Justice [Lewis] Powell in the Bakke
case that diversity is a compelling interest
in the college admission process," said
President John Hennessy shortly after the
court released its rulings on June 23, refer
ring to the historic Regents of the Univer
sity of California v. Bakke case of 1978.
Hennessy said that the University's ad
mission programs fully complied with the
new ruling in a statement released after the
Court's decision.

In the two recent cases, which specifical
ly addressed admissions to the University
of Michigan's undergraduate and law pro
grams, the Supreme Court ruled five to
four that race may be considered as a posi
tive factor in the admissions process when
used in the context of an "individualized,
holistic review of each applicant's file" to
foster educational diversity. However, the
court also ruled six to three that Michigan's
automatic conferral of 20 out of 150 possi
ble points to applicants who were African
American, Latino or Native American was
not narrow enough to meet this criteria.
Robin Mamlet, dean of undergraduate
admission and financial aid, told the
Stanford Report that the decision ce
mented Stanford's already existing affir
mative action policies, which took race
into account but did not use a quantita
tive system to do so.
"Does this [ruling] change what we do at
Stanford?" Mamlet said. "No. But I feel it's
very reassuring to have the highest court in
the land reaffirm what we do."
While Stanford's admission policies
would not necessarily have been affected
by a ruling against affirmative action, a fail
ure to comply with such a ruling could
have jeopardized the federal funding that
the University receives for scholarships
and research — federal funding accounts
for 86 percent of all external funding re
ceived bv Stanford for research.

nessy issued the following statement in re
sponse to the rulings by the U.S. Supreme
Court on affirmative actum.

Many experts have speculated that the
recent rulings will allow private institutions
such as Stanford to release more detailed
explanations of their admissions policies
without fear of legal reprisal. The office of
undergraduate admission did not respond
to The Weekly's request for comment on
this issue by press time.
John Rickford, a professor of linguistics
and, by courtesy, education, said he was
pleased by the Supreme Court's decisions.
"I'm delighted by the fact that the
court has chosen to uphold the principles
of affirmative action — if not the details
of the way in which it was applied in
Michigan — and hope that it will help
offset the effects of restrictive action and
negative prejudgment/prejudice from
which students of color have suffered for
decades and decades and continue to suf
fer," Rickford said.

mission programs at Stanford are consis
tent with the individualized determina
tion that was reaffirmed today by the
Court and, without exception, the Uni
versity seeks to admit students with the
potential to excel at Stanford and later in
life. In the next few days, University at
torneys will study the justices' opinions
carefully to further consider the details
of the decisions.
Rising junior Eric Shih, next year's
chair of the Asian American Students As
sociation, echoed Rickford's praise of
the decision.
"I'm also pleased that President Hen
nessy has taken this monumental decision
as an opportunity to reaffirm Stanford's
dedication to diversity," Shih said.
Others were less pleased.
"A lot of people interpret this as a victo
ry for affirmative action, and that's true to
the extent that there are no clear, bright
lines set," said Fiotr Kosicki, a rising senior
and the outgoing editor-in-chief of the
conservative Stanford Review. "It's not like
we can measure where actions aimed at di
versity stop and excess measures, like the
racial quotas, start.
"Coming out of the Michigan case, I was
definitely most impressed by the
grassroots activism of the Michi
gan Civil Rights Initiative," Kosic
ki added. "These are a lot of the
same people who were responsi
ble for getting the issue of affir
mative action on the referendum
ballot in California. Given how
political the whole issue is for the
courts, it really seems that throw
ing the issue open to the people
themselves is the most appropri
ate thing to do."
Shelby Steele, a research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, went as
far as to describe the decision to
the Stanford Report as a "very
dark day"for minorities.
"I couldn't think of a worse de
cision," he said. "It's a vote of no
confidence from the Supreme
Court that our best and brightest
are unable to compete on an even
playing field. There is nothing at
Stanford that is worth being stig
matized in this way."
While the current debate con
tinues, Clayborne Carson, a pro
fessor of historv who also oversees

the Martin Luther King Jr. Pa
pers Project, cautioned that the
recent rulings are "not the last
word in the post-Brown [v. Board
of Education] controversies.
"First, it is a narrow five to four
decision. Second, it offers only
general guidance for institutions
with diversity policies, which have
always varied greatly both in con
ception and implementation."
The Court's decisions will not
directly affect California's public
universities, which are prohibited
by Proposition 209 from consid
ering race in their admissions
processes.
Rising junior Khalilah Karim,
the head organizer behind Stan
ford's participation in the Wash
ington, D.C. march, attributed
the decision primarily to pro-af
firmative action demonstrations
and activism.
"This is something that a lot of
youth today joined in together to
do, across all boundaries," Karim
said. "Race, gender, age — not
even youth but even the older
generation who felt the need for
[affirmative action] got involved
. . . I'm definitely proud of what
youth did, particularly at Stan
ford. It's good to see your work

actually paying off in the end."
Karim also predicted that the
energy and bonds from recent
activism will play a role in com
ing campaigns, including efforts
to prevent the passage of the
Classification of Race, Ethnicity,
and National Origin initiative,
which prevents the state from
recognizing race in public educa
tion, public contracting and pub
lic employment.
"This affirmative action deci
sion was our springboard to
hone in and focus on greater is
sues . . . with minority issues
and having representation," she
said. "First it was affirmative ac
tion, now it's our identity people
are questioning."
Despite his support of the re
cent decisions, Shih also claimed
that Stanford needs to do more to
promote and support campus di
versity.
"Diversity is more than an
acceptance letter or a statistic,"
he said. "From insufficient
community center space to few
faculty-of-color mentors, Stan
ford lacks the support structure
necessary to make our four
years here fulfilling, safe and
enjoyable."

necessary to make our four
years here fulfilling, safe and
enjoyable."
The U.S. Supreme Court's two rulings
on affirmative action last month both mir
rored and reinforced Stanford's own ad
missions policies, according to University
administrators.
The decisions came after months of de
bate nationwide and on campus, including
rallies, a pro-affirmative action bake sale,
pro-affirmative action statements by Uni
versity President John Hennessy and other
administrators, supported by the ASSU.
Around 30 members of the Students of
Color Coalition and Stanford's chapter of
the National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People went to Washing
ton, D.C. on April 1 to rally for affirmative
action in front of the Supreme Court as the
justices heard the case inside.
"We are very pleased the Supreme
Court has affirmed the principle articulat
ed by Justice [Lewis] Powell in the Bakke
case that diversity is a compelling interest
in the college admission process," said
President John Hennessy shortly after the
court released its rulings on June 23, refer
ring to the historic Regents of the Univer
sity of California v. Bakke case of 1978.
Hennessy said that the University's ad
mission programs fully complied with the
new ruling in a statement released after the
Court's decision.

In the two recent cases, which specifical
ly addressed admissions to the University
of Michigan's undergraduate and law pro
grams, the Supreme Court ruled five to
four that race may be considered as a posi
tive factor in the admissions process when
used in the context of an "individualized,
holistic review of each applicant's file" to
foster educational diversity. However, the
court also ruled six to three that Michigan's
automatic conferral of 20 out of 150 possi
ble points to applicants who were African
American, Latino or Native American was
not narrow enough to meet this criteria.
Robin Mamlet, dean of undergraduate
admission and financial aid, told the
Stanford Report that the decision ce
mented Stanford's already existing affir
mative action policies, which took race
into account but did not use a quantita
tive system to do so.
"Does this [ruling] change what we do at
Stanford?" Mamlet said. "No. But I feel it's
very reassuring to have the highest court in
the land reaffirm what we do."
While Stanford's admission policies
would not necessarily have been affected
by a ruling against affirmative action, a fail
ure to comply with such a ruling could
have jeopardized the federal funding that
the University receives for scholarships
and research — federal funding accounts
for 86 percent of all external funding re
ceived bv Stanford for research.

Editor's note: University President John Hen
nessy issued the following statement in re
sponse to the rulings by the U.S. Supreme
Court on affirmative actum.

Many experts have speculated that the
recent rulings will allow private institutions
such as Stanford to release more detailed
explanations of their admissions policies
without fear of legal reprisal. The office of
undergraduate admission did not respond
to The Weekly's request for comment on
this issue by press time.
John Rickford, a professor of linguistics
and, by courtesy, education, said he was
pleased by the Supreme Court's decisions.
"I'm delighted by the fact that the
court has chosen to uphold the principles
of affirmative action — if not the details
of the way in which it was applied in
Michigan — and hope that it will help
offset the effects of restrictive action and
negative prejudgment/prejudice from
which students of color have suffered for
decades and decades and continue to suf
fer," Rickford said.

mission programs at Stanford are consis
tent with the individualized determina
tion that was reaffirmed today by the
Court and, without exception, the Uni
versity seeks to admit students with the
potential to excel at Stanford and later in
life. In the next few days, University at
torneys will study the justices' opinions
carefully to further consider the details
of the decisions.
Rising junior Eric Shih, next year's
chair of the Asian American Students As
sociation, echoed Rickford's praise of
the decision.
"I'm also pleased that President Hen
nessy has taken this monumental decision
as an opportunity to reaffirm Stanford's
dedication to diversity," Shih said.
Others were less pleased.
"A lot of people interpret this as a victo
ry for affirmative action, and that's true to
the extent that there are no clear, bright
lines set," said Fiotr Kosicki, a rising senior
and the outgoing editor-in-chief of the
conservative Stanford Review. "It's not like
we can measure where actions aimed at di
versity stop and excess measures, like the
racial quotas, start.
"Coming out of the Michigan case, I was
definitely most impressed by the
grassroots activism of the Michi
gan Civil Rights Initiative," Kosic
ki added. "These are a lot of the
same people who were responsi
ble for getting the issue of affir
mative action on the referendum
ballot in California. Given how
political the whole issue is for the
courts, it really seems that throw
ing the issue open to the people
themselves is the most appropri
ate thing to do."
Shelby Steele, a research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, went as
far as to describe the decision to
the Stanford Report as a "very
dark day"for minorities.
"I couldn't think of a worse de
cision," he said. "It's a vote of no
confidence from the Supreme
Court that our best and brightest
are unable to compete on an even
playing field. There is nothing at
Stanford that is worth being stig
matized in this way."
While the current debate con
tinues, Clayborne Carson, a pro
fessor of historv who also oversees

the Martin Luther King Jr. Pa
pers Project, cautioned that the
recent rulings are "not the last
word in the post-Brown [v. Board
of Education] controversies.
"First, it is a narrow five to four
decision. Second, it offers only
general guidance for institutions
with diversity policies, which have
always varied greatly both in con
ception and implementation."
The Court's decisions will not
directly affect California's public
universities, which are prohibited
by Proposition 209 from consid
ering race in their admissions
processes.
Rising junior Khalilah Karim,
the head organizer behind Stan
ford's participation in the Wash
ington, D.C. march, attributed
the decision primarily to pro-af
firmative action demonstrations
and activism.
"This is something that a lot of
youth today joined in together to
do, across all boundaries," Karim
said. "Race, gender, age — not
even youth but even the older
generation who felt the need for
[affirmative action] got involved
. . . I'm definitely proud of what
youth did, particularly at Stan
ford. It's good to see your work

actually paying off in the end."
Karim also predicted that the
energy and bonds from recent
activism will play a role in com
ing campaigns, including efforts
to prevent the passage of the
Classification of Race, Ethnicity,
and National Origin initiative,
which prevents the state from
recognizing race in public educa
tion, public contracting and pub
lic employment.
"This affirmative action deci
sion was our springboard to
hone in and focus on greater is
sues . . . with minority issues
and having representation," she
said. "First it was affirmative ac
tion, now it's our identity people
are questioning."
Despite his support of the re
cent decisions, Shih also claimed
that Stanford needs to do more to
promote and support campus di
versity.
"Diversity is more than an
acceptance letter or a statistic,"
he said. "From insufficient
community center space to few
faculty-of-color mentors, Stan
ford lacks the support structure
necessary to make our four
years here fulfilling, safe and
enjoyable."
