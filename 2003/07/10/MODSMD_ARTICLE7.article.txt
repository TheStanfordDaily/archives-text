# Mall deal set, Stanford to gain $333M
## 
### NICOLA JOAN CARAH 
Last week, Simon Property Group
confirmed its pending purchase of
Stanford Shopping Center from the
University. The $333 million deal, ex
pected to finalize in August, will last 51
years. However, due to a stipulation in
Leland Stanford's land grant to the
University, Stanford will continue to
own the land under the mall while
Simon operates and manages the build
ings and structures.
Built in 1956, the shopping center's
revenue has always been funneled di
rectly into the University's general fund
and used mainly for teaching and re
search. At the time of the mall's concep
tion, the University was struggling with
low enrollment due to the Second
World War and high property taxes for
unused land.
David Longbine, director of the shop
ping center, told The Daily last month
that the mall is "the top sales producing
center in the Bay Area, and one of the

top centers in the United States."
Last year's sales were more than $500
million ancl tenant sales per-square-foot
were approximately $000.
When the deal is closed, Stanford will
not only receive the $333 million, but
will also continue to receive one quarter
of future tenant rent.
The University will also maintain ap
proval rights with respect to major

changes in the management and opera
tion of the mall, according to Bill
Phillips, managing director of real estate
at Stanford Management Co., as report
ed by the San Jose Mercury News.
Simon Property Group is the largest
mall company in the United States,
with 247 income-producing properties
