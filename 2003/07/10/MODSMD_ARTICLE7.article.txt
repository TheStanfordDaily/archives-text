# Mall deal set, Stanford to gain $333M
## 
### NICOLA JOAN CARAH 
Last week, Simon Property Group
confirmed its pending purchase of
Stanford Shopping Center from the
University. The $333 million deal, ex
pected to finalize in August, will last 51
years. However, due to a stipulation in
Leland Stanford's land grant to the
University, Stanford will continue to
own the land under the mall while
Simon operates and manages the build
ings and structures.
Built in 1956, the shopping center's
revenue has always been funneled di
rectly into the University's general fund
and used mainly for teaching and re
search. At the time of the mall's concep
tion, the University was struggling with
low enrollment due to the Second
World War and high property taxes for
unused land.
David Longbine, director of the shop
ping center, told The Daily last month
that the mall is "the top sales producing
center in the Bay Area, and one of the

top centers in the United States."
Last year's sales were more than $500
million ancl tenant sales per-square-foot
were approximately $000.
When the deal is closed, Stanford will
not only receive the $333 million, but
will also continue to receive one quarter
of future tenant rent.
The University will also maintain ap
proval rights with respect to major

changes in the management and opera
tion of the mall, according to Bill
Phillips, managing director of real estate
at Stanford Management Co., as report
ed by the San Jose Mercury News.

The University recently agreed to sell the Stanford Shopping Center to the Simon Property
Group for $333 million in a deal that will likely finalize in August.
in 36 states, Canada and Europe.
It also claims ownership of the
Mall of America in Bloomington,
Minnesota — the country's
largest mall.

"[Stanford Shopping Center] is
a perfect fit in our strategy to own
and manage high-quality, highly
productive retail real estate," said
David Simon, CEO of the Simon
Property Group.
The prospect of new owner
ship has some Stanford communi
ty members feeling uneasy, fear
ing that unwelcome changes

might result from the sale.
"I don't want it to get ugly and
big," said Elizabeth Gordon, Class
of'o3. "I hope they keep the Stan
ford aesthetic spirit — outdoorsy,
laid-back — that's what makes it
special and that's why I go there."
To address this concern,
Phillips announced that Simon
was "aware that the Shopping

Center is an integral part of the
University and Palo Alto life and
they will mange the Center in a
way that meets the needs of shop
pers and the local community."
Many Stanford community
members remain unaware of the
University's involvement in the
shopping center.
"I never even realized that the
University actually owned the
Shopping Center," said Barb
Swan, a shopper at the Center and
University employee.
Students expressed their be
lief that the Stanford Shopping
Center has typically catered
more to Palo Alto's wealthy con
sumers than the average Stan
ford student.
In a past Daily article, students
voiced concern that the mall's
management has neglected to

provide them with stores that
would better fit their needs, such
as Old Navy and Target, and that
the tenants were often upscale
and overpriced.
"While the Shopping Center
does not cater to students, it does
help to finance their education
and I think that's more impor
tant," said Rosemary McAn
drews, former director of the
Shopping Center.
With an extra $333 million in
its pocket, the University will con
tinue to enhance its programs.
Simon has made no mention of
changing the shopping center's
target demographic.
McAndrews added, "If it is
going to be a successful shopping
center, they can't have students as
first on their list, because they
would go broke."
