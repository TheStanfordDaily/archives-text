### ALIA MOORE 
Provost John Etchemendy recently announced
the selection of Coit D. Blacker — also known as
"Chip" — as the new director of the Institute for In
ternational Studies lor the next four years.
lIS, established in 1987, is an interdisciplinary or
ganization geared towards research in international
issues. The Institute is comprised of live different
components, which include international security,
health policy, environmental policy and the Asia/Pa
cific region. Blacker currently directs the fifth com
ponent — the Center for Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law. He will step down from this po
sition when he assumes leadership of lIS on Sept. 1.
Blacker follows Professor David Holloway, who
has lead the Institute since 1998. Holloway completes
his five-year term as director this year.
"I decided I wanted to get back to research, writ
ing, and teaching," Holloway said.
Referring to his leadership of I IS, he said," I found
it fascinating, having such a broad view. I hope it will
grow stronger in its capacity to work on these [inter
national] issues, and become more embedded in the
University, increasing contributions to the Universi
ty and the world outside."
The new director was selected by a committee of
Stanford professors and others in
volved with the University, includ
ing President Emeritus Gerhard
Casper and School of Earth Sci
ences Dean Pamela Matson. Histo
ry Prof. James Sheehan headed the
committee.
"We conducted a very broad
search within the University,
Sheehan said. "We talked to a lot
of people — people interested in
the Institute, whose views we val
ued. Those approached by the
committee offered possible nomi
nations, and the committee used
these nominations to begin the se
lection process."
"The key to the Institute and
the director's position is the multi
plicity that the Institute and the
director must be able to use," he
added. "The components have
their own personalities and their
own missions. But the Institute
needs to be more than the sum of
these parts. It needs to have a
sense of itself."
According to Sheehan, Blacker
has worked in multiple areas of I IS,

and was chosen in part because he
understands how the components
work together.
Blacker worked as a foreign
policy advisor for A1 Gore in the
2000 election campaign and
served under U.S. President Bill
Clinton as an assistant for national
security affairs.
As a political science professor at
Stanford, Blacker received the Lau
rence and Naomi Carpenter
Hoagland Prize for undergraduate
teaching and was named the Olivi
er Nomellini Family University Fel
low in undergraduate education.
"He's got all the background
that's very useful to lead the Insti
tute," said Klas Bergman, associate
director of communications for
lIS. "He's done both academics
and policy making."
According to Sheehan, lIS does
not occupy the same space as other
departments at Stanford.
"The Institute can reach across
schools and departments," he said.
"The director needs to articulate
the Institute's mission, and ensure
that lIS gets a fair share of the Uni
versity's resources. Chip is an artic
ulate, committed spokesman for
the Institute. People know him and
respect him."
