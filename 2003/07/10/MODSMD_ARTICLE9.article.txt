# On a mission: Mormon students work to spread their faith
## 
### ANNA GALAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As rising senior Laura Pearson opened
the letter that contained her mission call
for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints, her hands shook. She didn't
know what to expect. She could be sent
anywhere around the world, from South
Africa, South America, New Zealand, to
Reno, Nevada.
"When I was opening the letter, I was
so nervous, with this big white envelope
in my hands," she said. "It's not like a
Stanford admittance letter where it says
where you are going on the flap."
Laura is one of several Mormon stu
dents at Stanford that left on missions at
the end of the academic year.
On Apr. 25 she found out where she
would be spending the next 18 months.
Surrounded by family and friends, she
explained that "when I read 'Rome,' I
was very excited."
While she has traveled to Europe,
Laura said that she has never been to
Italy.
She will spend the next few months
preparing for her mission. Laura plans
on taking introductory Italian courses,
re-learning how to play the piano so that
she can play church hymns and enjoying
the rest of her summer with friends. On
Aug. 6 she will depart for the Mission
Training Center in Provo, Utah, where
she will spend the first two to three
months of her mission.
Laura, who is currently a resident as
sistant in Otero, said the decision about
whether or not to go on a mission was a
big one.
"Part of the reason why I decided to go
now was so that I would have something

to come back to," she explained.
According to Laura, not having the se
nior year that she always thought she
would was the biggest downside. Howev
er, she also said that she knew her friends
would keep in touch.
"Being an RA, I have 82 freshman that
will be here when I get back and people
that co-term will still be around," she
said. "It's reassuring that there will still be
friendly faces on campus."
Her brother, Brad Pearson, a rising
sophomore at Stanford, is also leaving for
his mission in August. He received his
mission call a few weeks ago and will be
going to Budapest, Hungary.
Girls must be at least 21 to go on a mis
sion, while boys must be at least 19. An
other gender difference is that boys go
for 24 months and girls go for 18.
Referring to girls who go on missions,
Laura commented, "It's not unusual, but
it isn't common.
"Out of my freshman class, there are
ten Mormon girls, and two of us are going
on a mission this year."
Laura said that part of the reason she
was so surprised that she got called to Italy
was that girls often get called to missions in
the United States for safety reasons.
Brad said that he was thrilled that he
got called to Hungary, especially after
studying much of Eastern Europe this
year in his Introduction to the Humani
ties class.
"I think Hungary is the best place I
could have gotten called to," he said. "I
am so happy to go there. After my sister
got her call to Rome, which is a great mis
sion call, I was fearing the Nebraska or
North Dakota mission where you talk
English to the locals."
However, he stressed, "No matter

where you are called, people come back
and say the people from that area are
the best."
Rising junior Reed Criddle returned
last August from serving two-years at the
Taipei mission in Taiwan. He had stud
ied Mandarin Chinese for five years be
forehand and was thrilled to be able to
put his language studies to use. Chinese
is now one of his majors at Stanford,
along with music.
Criddle said coming back to Stanford
was a big transition, although it was nice
to see his friends again. Most were seniors
by that point.
"Going on a mission, I grew in so many
ways," he said. "Coming back, I had a dif
ferent perspective, but I felt like a differ
ent person because of all the new experi
ences I had."
Missionaries are only allowed to com
municate with friends and family
through letters. They are allowed to call
home twice a year — on Christmas and
Mother's Day.
"Even being gone fora few years, I
got a lot closer to my friends through let
ter writing," Criddle said. "It's a lot
more personal, and I think our friend
ships got deeper."
Missionaries are not funded by their
churches; they must pay for everything
themselves, including airfare, living
arrangements and food. They move loca
tions about every six weeks. Laura's mis
sion in Rome encompasses much of Italy,
including Florence, Naples, and Sar
dinia. Brad's mission will involve travel
ing all over Hungary.
Both felt that one of their biggest chal
lenges would be learning the language.
"Sometimes, it's hard to answer ques
tions about religious beliefs coherently in

English, but to do that in Italian will be so
much more difficult," Laura said.
"Two or three months is a short time to
learn a language," Brad said, who must
learn Magyar, the language spoken in
Hungary. "It's a dialect based on Finnish
and Estonian and is supposed to be one of
the hardest languages to learn. I am
going to be interacting with people on the
bus, walking in the street, knocking on
doors — it's going to be a challenge."
Laura said some other challenges
might come from the fact that missionar
ies have companions they must spend 24
hours a day with. While these compan
ions switch every few months, missionar
ies aren't allowed to leave a room without
their companion.
"I expect that there will be people I
get along with well, and people I might
not," Laura said. "I also have to remem
ber that not all of my companions are
going to speak English as a first lan
guage. Italian might be the only lan
guage we have in common."
Another challenge she faces is that
Italy is predominately Catholic.
"A lot of people might not be overly re
ceptive," Laura said.
"You're going to be rejected a lot,
Criddle said of sharing his religion
with others. "Not everyone is looking
fora new faith, or faith in general. But
there are people who are, and that is
really special."
Despite the challenges, both Pearsons
are looking forward to their missions.
"I look at it as sharing good fruit
with people," Brad said. "I am going to
be sharing something that I think is
very important with other people. Its
going to be a great learning experi
ence overall."
