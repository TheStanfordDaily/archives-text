## Graduation time: cap and gown or wedding gown? 
### JEN GRAHAM GUEST COLUMNIST 
Something happens sometime between
Freshman Orientation and Commence
ment that makes you realize that your life
is starting to get "real."
Going into college, you knew it was
going to happen. It's all part of the plan:
you go to school, study your passion, meet
your soul mate and go off to live the per
fect, successful post-Stanford life. At least
that's how you think it's going to play out
when you're 17 and a "degree" is still an ab
stract concept. But then you go on the
Band Run your freshman fall and forget
that right at the end of your four (or more)
undergraduate years you're supposed to
be back in the real world living the life your
17-year-old self envisioned.
Inevitably, though, some defining mo
ment rocks your frivolous, post-adolescent
world and dumps you in a front-row seat
for an up-close look at reality. .And what
could be more suited to slap you across the
face than a wedding? Nothing will drive
home the point that things are starting to
get serious faster than seeing somebody
your age get married.
I had this pleasure at the end of June
when 1 went to Fort Wayne, Indiana —
land of the riding lawn mower — to see

my 26-year-old cousin surrender his soul
to marital bondage with a girl who was 20.
I'm 20. Ha.
My life seems immediately trivial when
someone who might as well be me is talking
about her mortgage and I'm thinking,
"The ice luge at Luau was sooooo cool."
But beyond feeling foolishly immature,
I'm also forced to think, "Hey, people MY
age are getting married? I can barely pick
a meal plan, much less a "life
partner." Then I wonder, "What has she
realized about life that I haven't?"
Suddenly, I start seeing signs all around
me that the ante has been raised and my
precious time to live on a whim is rapidly
waning.
I realize that my parents met in college
and got married barely a year after gradu
ation. My aunt is more than willing to re
mind me that college is the place where you
will find the highest concentration of
brains and brawn. "You thought dating at
Stanford was bad?" she says. "Wait 'til you
see the world outside."
As if that wasn't enough to make me
start thinking I was too concentrated on
my BA to work on my MRS, my roommate
begins discussing tying the knot post-Com
mencement with the guy she's been dating
fora year and a half. She wonders whether
it's worth continuing the relationship if it

may not end in an exchange of vows.
And I think, "Since when did a college
relationship turn into marriage or bust?"
Is the answer now, when you're past the
halfway point in your undergraduate
tenure? And what would college life be like
in this "reality" phase?
No more four-week dormcests; that's a
waste of time and could keep you from
meeting "the one" who is lurking some
where on the Farm. Interested in that guy
in your Tuesday section? Well, he says he's
signed up to join the Peace Corps and
you're planning your start-up in San Jose,
so that's not even worth bothering with. He
wouldn't make a good father anyway.
Perish the day 1 have such thoughts. At
least that's what I used to think. Now I'm
not so sure — a harrowing state. Excuse
me while I go play in oncoming traffic.
But at least I'm not alone. In addition to
the one-third of Stanford students who
were unable to declare a major by the start
of their junior year, a random sample sur
veyed over AOL Instant Messenger
seemed to harbor similar ambivalence to
the thought that they could be married
within the next two to three years (screen
names have been changed to protect the
commitment-opposed).
Reactions ranged from incredulous ...
JustWantßooty: the hell i will

... to intractable ...
NumbersUpQualityDown: I have
enough trouble committing to meet some
one fora meal, let alone marry anyone
... to inconsolable ...
EsssOnMyChest: its just, i am NOT the
same person i was freshman year, how can
1 expect to be the same person in two years
from now?
... to innocent. ..
HahaUSaidSEX: ok, i think it's too
weird
... to possibly beyond help ...
SooooAnxious: i kind of like the idea of
not being lonely
SooooAnxious: but do i really know
what else is out there?
SooooAnxious: wow, will i only have
one serious relationship ever?
SooooAnxious: what will i be sacrificing?
If it isn't so uncommon for Stanford
grads to wed a year or two out of school,
why is marriage so disturbing a concept to
20-and 21-year-olds who are imminently
destined for the aisle?
It could be an extraordinarily premature
case of cold feet. Hopefully that's the only
thing that's premature; better get married
fast before the word gets out.
More likely, it's an overarching
tear that most students have: actu
ally making a choice and sticking
to it — and this probably isn't one
you want to mess up.
Maybe that is why a wedding is
the surest way to make a college
coed shit their pants. In terms of
your career, the world opens its
doors to you after graduation.
You can travel, intern, bartend,
research, M.D., J.D., Ph.D. Heck,
do it all — you can switch and no
harm, no foul. Ah, the beauty of
the Stanford degree.
But the scary thing about this
whole "marriage" deal is that it's a
choice for life, albeit more in prin
ciple than in practice. It may even
be the only one you'll ever have to
make (pretend "children" don't
exist). Woah, man. That's heavy.
Pass the Natty.
So besides a newfound appreci

ation for John Deere, what did I
take away from this Indiana wed
ding? I'm starting to get old and
everything is starting to matter
just a little bit more, and maybe it
is time to move on from many of
the hedonistic indulgences of
freshman and sophomore years.
But nonetheless, I think I'm
going to put marriage on the
backburner and, at least for the
time being, retrain from apprais
ing my peers' credentials for par
enthood. There's no need to sap
all the joy from my life.
But, for those of you who still
choose to entirely ignore the call
of "real life" and graduate from
the Farm as single as you were at
that ill-fated middle school dance,
hope is not lost. The Daily is al
ways looking for extra revenue. I
recommend the Classifieds.

so that's not even worth bothering with. He
wouldn't make a good father anyway.
Perish the day 1 have such thoughts. At
least that's what I used to think. Now I'm
not so sure — a harrowing state. Excuse
me while I go play in oncoming traffic.
But at least I'm not alone. In addition to
the one-third of Stanford students who
were unable to declare a major by the start
of their junior year, a random sample sur
veyed over AOL Instant Messenger
seemed to harbor similar ambivalence to
the thought that they could be married
within the next two to three years (screen
names have been changed to protect the
commitment-opposed).
Reactions ranged from incredulous ...

SooooAnxious: i kind of like the idea of

SooooAnxious: wow, will i only have

SooooAnxious: what will i be sacrificing?
If it isn't so uncommon for Stanford
grads to wed a year or two out of school,
why is marriage so disturbing a concept to
20-and 21-year-olds who are imminently
destined for the aisle?
It could be an extraordinarily premature
case of cold feet. Hopefully that's the only
thing that's premature; better get married
fast before the word gets out.
More likely, it's an overarching
tear that most students have: actu
ally making a choice and sticking
to it — and this probably isn't one
you want to mess up.
Maybe that is why a wedding is
the surest way to make a college
coed shit their pants. In terms of
your career, the world opens its
doors to you after graduation.
You can travel, intern, bartend,
research, M.D., J.D., Ph.D. Heck,
do it all — you can switch and no
harm, no foul. Ah, the beauty of
the Stanford degree.
But the scary thing about this
whole "marriage" deal is that it's a
choice for life, albeit more in prin
ciple than in practice. It may even
be the only one you'll ever have to
make (pretend "children" don't
exist). Woah, man. That's heavy.
Pass the Natty.
So besides a newfound appreci

ation for John Deere, what did I
take away from this Indiana wed
ding? I'm starting to get old and
everything is starting to matter
just a little bit more, and maybe it
is time to move on from many of
the hedonistic indulgences of
freshman and sophomore years.
But nonetheless, I think I'm
going to put marriage on the
backburner and, at least for the
time being, retrain from apprais
ing my peers' credentials for par
enthood. There's no need to sap
all the joy from my life.
But, for those of you who still
choose to entirely ignore the call
of "real life" and graduate from
the Farm as single as you were at
that ill-fated middle school dance,
hope is not lost. The Daily is al
ways looking for extra revenue. I
recommend the Classifieds.

Something happens sometime between
Freshman Orientation and Commence
ment that makes you realize that your life
is starting to get "real."
Going into college, you knew it was
going to happen. It's all part of the plan:
you go to school, study your passion, meet
your soul mate and go off to live the per
fect, successful post-Stanford life. At least
that's how you think it's going to play out
when you're 17 and a "degree" is still an ab
stract concept. But then you go on the
Band Run your freshman fall and forget
that right at the end of your four (or more)
undergraduate years you're supposed to
be back in the real world living the life your
17-year-old self envisioned.
Inevitably, though, some defining mo
ment rocks your frivolous, post-adolescent
world and dumps you in a front-row seat
for an up-close look at reality. .And what
could be more suited to slap you across the
face than a wedding? Nothing will drive
home the point that things are starting to
get serious faster than seeing somebody
your age get married.
I had this pleasure at the end of June
when 1 went to Fort Wayne, Indiana —
land of the riding lawn mower — to see

my 26-year-old cousin surrender his soul
to marital bondage with a girl who was 20.
I'm 20. Ha.
My life seems immediately trivial when
someone who might as well be me is talking
about her mortgage and I'm thinking,
"The ice luge at Luau was sooooo cool."
But beyond feeling foolishly immature,
I'm also forced to think, "Hey, people MY
age are getting married? I can barely pick
a meal plan, much less a "life
partner." Then I wonder, "What has she
realized about life that I haven't?"
Suddenly, I start seeing signs all around
me that the ante has been raised and my
precious time to live on a whim is rapidly
waning.
I realize that my parents met in college
and got married barely a year after gradu
ation. My aunt is more than willing to re
mind me that college is the place where you
will find the highest concentration of
brains and brawn. "You thought dating at
Stanford was bad?" she says. "Wait 'til you
see the world outside."
As if that wasn't enough to make me
start thinking I was too concentrated on
my BA to work on my MRS, my roommate
begins discussing tying the knot post-Com
mencement with the guy she's been dating
fora year and a half. She wonders whether
it's worth continuing the relationship if it

may not end in an exchange of vows.
And I think, "Since when did a college
relationship turn into marriage or bust?"
Is the answer now, when you're past the
halfway point in your undergraduate
tenure? And what would college life be like
in this "reality" phase?
No more four-week dormcests; that's a
waste of time and could keep you from
meeting "the one" who is lurking some
where on the Farm. Interested in that guy
in your Tuesday section? Well, he says he's
signed up to join the Peace Corps and
you're planning your start-up in San Jose,
so that's not even worth bothering with. He
wouldn't make a good father anyway.
