There should be red warning labels in the
course bulletin next to certain humanities
classes: NOT F( )R THE SENSITIVE or DO
NOT ALSO ENROLL IN A LITERATURE
COURSE.
It is dangerous to read well-written fiction
and then study society; symptoms include
depression, heartbreak and the occasional
cancer. Literature develops our empathetic
imagination, our ability to connect and expe
rience the life of the character.
Today's world provides over six billion
such characters for the developed imagina
tion. Only a third of them live in the West,
and only 14,000 of these attend Stanford.
Imagine the alternatives.
Perhaps the experience of partial discon
nection from the personal condition is more
traumatic than the experience of connection
with someone less fortunate. Whatever the
cause, the emotive result of vicarious under
standing may be unbearable.
There are two responses to the unbear
able diversity of human experience: internal
ize it or reject it. But how does one reject
something they know to be true?
Instead of accomplishing a complete de
nial, one can accept the condition in the pre
sent but banish it from their fantasv of the fu

ture, thus preserving for their wounded
imagination its primary sanctuary - tomor
row. A vision of an ever-better tomorrow —
less torn by divisions of personal experience
— has been the fantasy of Progress and the
promise of Progressives.
America's gradual achievement of that
promise through the last century, while the
rest of the world collapsed in division, began
with the Progressive Era. The early Progres
sives weren't weepy humanities students fac
ing the human condition through books, they
were weepy bourgeoisie city dwellers facing
the human condition on the streets.
At the turn of the twentieth century, nearly
one out of seven Americans was foreign born.
Most of the immigrants came to the cities
where their foreign and industrially brutal
ized lives inspired more than sympathy.
There was a second connection between
the Progressive psychology and urban life.
Living in cities with a man-made
landscape — where the earth had become
pavement and the trees resettled in parks —
inspired a confidence in the corrective power
of mankind. Progressives didn't merely as
sume that it would get better; they counted
on the forces of reason — medicine, eco
nomics, engineering and education —to
solve social problems.
