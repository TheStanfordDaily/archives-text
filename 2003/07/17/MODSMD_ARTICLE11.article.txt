# PEDANTIC POETICS
## Progressivism is not for the insensitive

There should be red warning labels in the
course bulletin next to certain humanities
classes: NOT F( )R THE SENSITIVE or DO
NOT ALSO ENROLL IN A LITERATURE
COURSE.
It is dangerous to read well-written fiction
and then study society; symptoms include
depression, heartbreak and the occasional
cancer. Literature develops our empathetic
imagination, our ability to connect and expe
rience the life of the character.
Today's world provides over six billion
such characters for the developed imagina
tion. Only a third of them live in the West,
and only 14,000 of these attend Stanford.
Imagine the alternatives.
Perhaps the experience of partial discon
nection from the personal condition is more
traumatic than the experience of connection
with someone less fortunate. Whatever the
cause, the emotive result of vicarious under
standing may be unbearable.
There are two responses to the unbear
able diversity of human experience: internal
ize it or reject it. But how does one reject
something they know to be true?
Instead of accomplishing a complete de
nial, one can accept the condition in the pre
sent but banish it from their fantasv of the fu

ture, thus preserving for their wounded
imagination its primary sanctuary - tomor
row. A vision of an ever-better tomorrow —
less torn by divisions of personal experience
— has been the fantasy of Progress and the
promise of Progressives.
America's gradual achievement of that
promise through the last century, while the
rest of the world collapsed in division, began
with the Progressive Era. The early Progres
sives weren't weepy humanities students fac
ing the human condition through books, they
were weepy bourgeoisie city dwellers facing
the human condition on the streets.
At the turn of the twentieth century, nearly
one out of seven Americans was foreign born.
Most of the immigrants came to the cities
where their foreign and industrially brutal
ized lives inspired more than sympathy.
There was a second connection between
the Progressive psychology and urban life.
Living in cities with a man-made
landscape — where the earth had become
pavement and the trees resettled in parks —
inspired a confidence in the corrective power
of mankind. Progressives didn't merely as
sume that it would get better; they counted
on the forces of reason — medicine, eco
nomics, engineering and education —to
solve social problems.
In"The Promise of American
Life," the future editor of The
New Republic, Herbert Croly
wrote:
"The only fruitful promise of
which the life of any individual or
any nation can be possessed is a
promise determined by an ideal.
Such a promise is to be fulfilled,
not by sanguine anticipations, not
by a conservative imitation of past
achievements, but by laborious,
single-minded, clear sighted, and
fearless work."
Croly's book distinguished
progressives from impotent ideal
ists by their will and their effort to
make their ideals a reality. By
1909, the year it was published,
progressives were increasingly
drawn to the state to empower
their personal efforts. In fact, they
began making promises on Amer
ica's behalf.
For the next century, America
worked to fulfill these promises
through reasoned application of
state power. Some of the accom
plishments include: public educa
tion, anti-trust legislation,
women's suffrage, the New Deal,
the highway system, the Great So
ciety, the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and affirmative action.
Like all victories, ours came
with a price: mass-delusion.
America's government exists as a
government of promises. Ameri
cans are a hopeful people, easily en
chanted by visions of better tomor
rows, willing to unite in hope more
than in anger or fear. To compel a
majority, American politicians have
become promise-makers.
Consider our hometown hero

Herbert Hoover's campaign
promise of 1928: "a car in every
garage and a chicken in even pot"
and the ensuing depression. Con
sider Truman's promise to win the
Korean War; Johnson's promise to
win the war on poverty (and Viet
nam); Nixon's promise that he was
not acux)k; Reagan's promise not to
negotiate with terrorists; papa
Bush's promise "read my lips no
more taxes;" Clinton's promise re
garding his sexual relations or our
current president's promises about
Iraq. For every accomplished
promise, many more remain unful
filled.
Europeans resent this zealous
naivete, this industriously "labori
ous" and provincially "single-mind
ed" and arrogantly "clear sighted
and fearless work" that gets things
done. (Ever since their horrible self
mutilation in the 19405, Europeans
have also resented our handsome
economy.) Yet it's precisely our will
to believe that allows our occasional
victories.
As for the populist method pre
sented last week, consider this
year's in absentia witch burnings of
the Bush administration across
college campuses. I foresee that a
wider campaign is to follow; that
the democrats' effort will be spent
on a populist style "Blame Bush"
campaign, rather than creating a
positive alternative to the present
administration's policies. Further,
that effort will fail, as a populist ef
fort to unite a majority against the
incumbent has always failed. Only
a platform of promises can elect a
democratic president in 2004.

There is nothing as fulfilling as hate mail

Europeans resent this zealous

As for the populist method pre

the democrats' effort will be spent
on a populist style "Blame Bush"
campaign, rather than creating a
positive alternative to the present
administration's policies. Further,
that effort will fail, as a populist ef

incumbent has always failed. Only
a platform of promises can elect a
democratic president in 2004.

There should be red warning labels in the
course bulletin next to certain humanities
classes: NOT F( )R THE SENSITIVE or DO
NOT ALSO ENROLL IN A LITERATURE
COURSE.
It is dangerous to read well-written fiction
and then study society; symptoms include
depression, heartbreak and the occasional
cancer. Literature develops our empathetic
imagination, our ability to connect and expe
rience the life of the character.
Today's world provides over six billion
such characters for the developed imagina
tion. Only a third of them live in the West,
and only 14,000 of these attend Stanford.
Imagine the alternatives.
Perhaps the experience of partial discon
nection from the personal condition is more
traumatic than the experience of connection
with someone less fortunate. Whatever the
cause, the emotive result of vicarious under
standing may be unbearable.
There are two responses to the unbear
able diversity of human experience: internal
ize it or reject it. But how does one reject
something they know to be true?
Instead of accomplishing a complete de
nial, one can accept the condition in the pre
sent but banish it from their fantasv of the fu

ture, thus preserving for their wounded
imagination its primary sanctuary - tomor
row. A vision of an ever-better tomorrow —
less torn by divisions of personal experience
— has been the fantasy of Progress and the
promise of Progressives.
America's gradual achievement of that
promise through the last century, while the
rest of the world collapsed in division, began
with the Progressive Era. The early Progres
sives weren't weepy humanities students fac
ing the human condition through books, they
were weepy bourgeoisie city dwellers facing
the human condition on the streets.
At the turn of the twentieth century, nearly
one out of seven Americans was foreign born.
Most of the immigrants came to the cities
where their foreign and industrially brutal
ized lives inspired more than sympathy.
There was a second connection between
the Progressive psychology and urban life.
Living in cities with a man-made
landscape — where the earth had become
pavement and the trees resettled in parks —
inspired a confidence in the corrective power
of mankind. Progressives didn't merely as
sume that it would get better; they counted
on the forces of reason — medicine, eco
nomics, engineering and education —to
solve social problems.
In"The Promise of American
Life," the future editor of The
New Republic, Herbert Croly
wrote:
"The only fruitful promise of
which the life of any individual or
any nation can be possessed is a
promise determined by an ideal.
Such a promise is to be fulfilled,
not by sanguine anticipations, not
by a conservative imitation of past
achievements, but by laborious,
single-minded, clear sighted, and
fearless work."
Croly's book distinguished
progressives from impotent ideal
ists by their will and their effort to
make their ideals a reality. By
1909, the year it was published,
progressives were increasingly
drawn to the state to empower
their personal efforts. In fact, they
began making promises on Amer
ica's behalf.
For the next century, America
worked to fulfill these promises
through reasoned application of
state power. Some of the accom
plishments include: public educa
tion, anti-trust legislation,
women's suffrage, the New Deal,
the highway system, the Great So
ciety, the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and affirmative action.
Like all victories, ours came
with a price: mass-delusion.
America's government exists as a
government of promises. Ameri
cans are a hopeful people, easily en
chanted by visions of better tomor
rows, willing to unite in hope more
than in anger or fear. To compel a
majority, American politicians have
become promise-makers.
Consider our hometown hero

Herbert Hoover's campaign
promise of 1928: "a car in every
garage and a chicken in even pot"
and the ensuing depression. Con
sider Truman's promise to win the
Korean War; Johnson's promise to
win the war on poverty (and Viet
nam); Nixon's promise that he was
not acux)k; Reagan's promise not to
negotiate with terrorists; papa
Bush's promise "read my lips no
more taxes;" Clinton's promise re
garding his sexual relations or our
current president's promises about
Iraq. For every accomplished
promise, many more remain unful
filled.
