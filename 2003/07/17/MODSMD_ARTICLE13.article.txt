President Toledo is far from ideal
I only want to say that our actual pres
ident is one of the worst presidents we
ever had here in Peru, I know its not
your fault, but I have to say it to you be
cause he goes around the world telling a
lot of lies about himself and our country.
For most people of Peru, Fujimori was

the real democrat president, he really
fought against poverty in Peru; he gave
equal opportunities to all Peruvians; he
fought in an intelligent and creative way
against terrorism and drugs, but all those
"Peruvian plagues" are coming back
again with this president.
Toledo's government is only compa
rable with the disaster of the 80s that
was the Alan Garcia government.
