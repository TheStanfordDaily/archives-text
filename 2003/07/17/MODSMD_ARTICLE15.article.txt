# Has competition become irrelevant?
## Commercialism taking toll on professional sports 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's fourth and goal. The home
team is clinging to a five point
lead.
And the hated Chicago Bears, pre
sented by Bank One, stand formida
bly at the three-yard line.
Sounds daunting'yet natural,
right?
20 years ago, if you had told some
diehard Chicago football fans that
their team would be referred to as
Bears football presented by Bank
One, you might be mocked, then
asked, "What, are you trying to tell
us that there will be a swimming pool
in the outfield of Comiskey Park?"
(High fives all around).
"No...actually, Comiskey Park is
now called U.S. Cellular Field, and
the swimming pool is in right field of
Bank One Ballpark in Arizona."
"The same Bank One that pre
sents our Bears?"
"Exactly."
The Chicago humiliation is just
one example of the blatant commer
cialism that has recently been ram
pantly spreading throughout the
money-hungry sports industry. As a
result, the sports themselves are
often being distanced from their true
roots by the marketing-crazed busi
nessmen that have unleashed the
plague.
And, somewhere in the mix, they
forgot that fans flock to Soldier Field
to cheer for running back Anthony
Thomas and linebacker Brian
Urlacher, not Bank One teller

Jonathon Henry.
One main gateway to the problem
is the diverse ownership of large cor
porations. News Corp., for example,
owns not only media spanning five
continents (including Fox) but also
the Los Angeles Dodgers. And let's
not forget that the cross-town team
in Anaheim was gobbled up by the
übiquitous Disney Corporation two
years after the team's name was
quickly swiped for the popular chil
dren's movie, "Angels in the Out
field."
Such conflicts of interest are often
benign, however, as many Seattle fans
would not even recognize that the ma
jority owner of their beloved Mariners
is the president of Nintendo.
But no passionate sports fan can
accept the proliferation of commer
cialism that has afflicted professional
competition in the past few seasons.
Tuesday's Major League Baseball
All-Star Game was a perfect example
of this trend. Nearly a week before
the game, Ed Goren, the president of
Fox Corporation (which happens to
own the All-Star Game contract
through 2006) "suggested" that
Roger Clemens should be on the
team. Knowing that The Rocket
would garner far more viewers than
lesser-known players in small mar
kets, such as Lance Carter of the
Devil Rays, Goren was simply trying
to improve ratings and make a little
extra cash for his company.
And did Major League Baseball
(which stands to earn $2.5 billion
from the Fox contract) oblige?
Of course.
As Commissioner Bud Selig stat
ed, "For the ratings of this game to
continue to drop would be a disas
ter."

Coincidentally, perhaps the most
egregious case of blatant corporate
self-promotion in recent memory
also occurred Tuesday evening.
While millions of eager baseball
fans awaited the start of a marquee
sporting affair, they were greeted at
5 p.m. (the alleged starting time) not
with athletic action but the lovable
Sean Connery.
In the ensuing feast of horribly
unrelated marketing, viewers were
subjected to the "Major League of
Extraordinary Centlemen" — a clip
matched on the boring meter only by
"Kazaam" and "Battlefield Earth 2"
— that edited baseball stars into the
trailer for the blockbuster film creat
ed by, yep — you guessed it — Fox.
Then, after a league of extraordi
narily bad commercials and the brief
presentation of lineups, the game
began — at 5:40.
By then, much of the anticipation
of watching the league's best sluggers
and aces was overshadowed by the
failed attempt at the resurrection of a
72-year old actor's career.
But hey, despite the diluted ac
tion of the game (which happened to
be the most exciting contest in quite
some time), ratings were probably
up, Roger Clemens pitched, and the
Fox / Major League Baseball / Sean
Connery conglomerate was happy.
The worst facet of the situation is
that the leagues themselves are pro
moting this greed. If officials who are
supposed to protect the integrity of
the game are only interested in the
next billion-dollar contract, then
what does the future hold for the ac
tual game?
Is it only a matter of time before
