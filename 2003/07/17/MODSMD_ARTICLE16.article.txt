# No compassion necessary for mascot-assaulting Simon
## 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF COLUMNIST 
Three years ago, loud
mouth John Rocker
publicly humiliated
then-teammate Randall Simon
for blowing a play that cost the
Braves a game, and then Simon
claimed Rocker referred to him
as a 'fat monkey' in Sports Il
lustrated.
Pfff, and Simon thought
I HAT was embarrassing.
Prior to July 9th, the 28-
year-old was building himself a
fairly respectable career, hav
ing been named the Detroit
Tigers MVP after being De
troit's 2002 season leader in
RBIs, homers and slugging
percentage.

Simon moved on to Pitts
burgh this season, signing a 1-
year, 1.4 million dollar con
tract. He's batting a decent .272
on the season for the Pirates,
but got to play hero last month
with a 15th inning walk-off
solo shot against Cleveland.
But from July 9 onward,
Simon will play the MLB ver
sion of the village idiot.
Everyone who has watched
ESPN in the last week now
knows Simon only as that
moron who was arrested for
clocking the Brewers' Italian
Sausage mascot with his base
ball bat.
They say that the Pirates'
first baseman is lucky that he
wasn't charged with assault,
and was instead handed a

measly $432 fine for disorderly
conduct.
Lucky? I think not. If the
Milwaukee County Sheriffs
Department really had any
sense of what true mercy is,
they'd have let his keep his
$432 and put it toward a plane
ticket to Yemen.
Because we will never take
Simon seriously again.
Some speculate that all
Simon has to do is prove to the
American public that he's not a
total pansy and you know, if
that's all it takes...
This guy is completely
screwed.
He could start batting .400,
but no one is going to be im
pressed by a homer hit with the
same bat that Randall used to

pummel the sacred weenie tra
ditions of Miller Field.
He could give himself the
"family man beyond reproach"
image by having his wife pop
out some kids, and donating his
entire salary to the March of
Dimes, but if the Pirates throw
back uniforms didn't repulse
his wife, this "bludgeoning a
woman for fun" incident just
might do the trick.
He could make himself look
tough by becoming a real crim
inal, but let's be honest, if he
committed sexual assault, the
only comment would be, "well,
at least he's not beating the
meat anymore."
No, it doesn't matter what
Simon does to shed his rap as
Oscar Meyer Enemy #1.

Whatever ballpark Simon
travels to, he will be faced with
bratwurst bull's-eyes in center
field, mass performances of
"The Weenie Man Song" and
mascots that ride around in
Popemobiles for their own pro
tection.
Had Simon committed a real
crime, a la Darrell Armstrong's
policewoman manhandling, his
name could have someday been
spoken without a follow-up of
snickers. But alas, Simon will
forever be known as the
Sausage Whacker.
I suggest he jumps on a
plane now.
Oh, but Randall, I think you
should know: Yemen just
called and they don't want you
either.
