# The
						'Bad Boys' duo is back, bad and better

### LUANNE HERNANDEZ 
With gorgeous Miami beach
es, riveting action sequences and
a heart-thumping soundtrack,
"Bad Boys II" can be summed up
in one word â€” hot.
Mike Lawry (Will Smith) and
Marcus Burnett (Martin
Lawrence) have teamed up again
to make a huge Ecstasy bust led
by a notorious and wealthy drug
dealer (Jordi Molla). The twist, if
you can call it that, is that Bur
nett's sister, Syd (Gabrielle
Union) is a DEA agent who is also
working the same bust without
her brother's knowledge. Syd
also just happens to be Lawry's
love interest. Luckily, the
comedic elements of the movie
more than compensate for the
mediocre story.
Smith and Lawrence play off
each other as only they can. They
are absolutely hilarious. Al
though their fighting may seem a
little fake at times, overall they
prove to be a dynamic duo. Com
edy is a necessity in this movie as
it offsets the plethora of shootings
and generally bloody scenes.
The gun-fight scenes are
much more explicit than those
in the first movie and the action
sequences are highly intensi
fied by the use of special effects;
in several of the shooting
scenes, the camera follows the
bullet until it hits the target and
the audience is shown the bullet
penetrating its final destina
tion. Gore abounds. It's safe to

say "Bad Boys II" is not for the
faint of heart.
If you can tear your eyes away
from the fountains of blood
painting the screen, you'll notice
director Michael Bay made an
excellent choice in setting "Bad
Boys II"in Miami. The blue
skies, beautiful beaches and
scantily clad men and women
perfectly complement the tone of
the movie. The sweeping shots of
the beach and beachgoers gives
the audience a flavor for the sum
mer high life.
Although having Will Smith
star in a movie isn't enough to
guarantee the quality of its music,
the efforts of Nelly, I'. Diddy,
Murphy Lee, Jay Z, and Justin
Timberlake combine to create a
soundtrack of note. Whenever
the music begins to play in the
background, you will find your
self bobbing your head to the
beat. All in all, a Miami setting, a
primarily hip-hop based sound
track and an all-star lineup on
both screen and sound make
"Bad Boys II" an up-beat and en
joyable movie-going experience.
That is, if you can stand the
heat.
