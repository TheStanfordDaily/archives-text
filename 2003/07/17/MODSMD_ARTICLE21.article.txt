# Michelle Branch's 'Hotel Paper' is a write-off
## Songstress' attempt to branch out is spirited, but unsuccessful 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
Michelle Branch's "Hotel Paper" is a fairly
ordinary second album, from a fairly ordi
nary pop artist. While some say Branch is a
stand-out musician, this is really only true in
comparison to the rest of the computer-gen
erated, mass media-created pop music world
of Britney and Christina. It's true, Branch
does write, play, and sing all of her own
music, and these days that makes her stand
out above the crowd. The problem is, her
writing, her playing and her singing are all
only mediocre.
Though Branch hates being judged as a
young female artist, that is exactly what she is.

Her first album, "Spirit Room," was written
between ages 14 and 17. Now, mature beyond
her years at age 20, Branch has two years of
constant touring, the heartbreak of a failed
long-distance romance and the influence of
early fame under her belt. All this considered,
"Hotel Paper" is exactly what everyone should
have expected from Branch.
The title track of the album, "Hotel Paper,"
is a largely autobiographical account of living
and writing while on the road, with lyrics pro
gressing from"I write mostly on hotel paper"
to "forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love
you." While Branch easily meets expectations,
she fails to exceed them, and that does not
make fora great album.
Each song on "Hotel Paper" ends up
sounding the same, and echoes most of the
songs on "Spirit Room." Using the power of
her newfound fame, Branch attempted to

"branch out," collaborating with guitarist
Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot
Chili Peppers) on the first single, "Are You
Happy Now." This collaboration gives the
song a bit of a harder edge, but Navarro's
dark riffs are mostly lost in the Branch's lilt,
even as she sings "you don't care about me/I
know its just no use/when all your lies be
come your truths/and I don't care." There is
the potential for power in this song, but as
hard as Branch tries, she continues to fall
short.
Sheryl Crow's appearance later in the
album, on "Love Me Like That," tries to
change the tone from hard-edged anger to
folksy, rustic rock. Branch continues to dwell
on loneliness and loss, the trials of her post
adolescent life, singing "love me or leave me
baby but don't lead me on/with
loving like yours believe me I'm
better off/I'm better off alone."
Again, Branch is almost there on
this song, and Crow's harmonies
help, but surprisingly "Love Me
Like That" also fades into the
background on the album. While
it has a catchy chorus perfect for
pop radio, it just sounds too much
like the rest of the album.
Branch also got the opportu
nity to utilize a 22-piece orches
tra for the making of "Empty
Handed," a song that ponders
the difficulty of making a place
for oneself in the world.
Arranged by David Campbell, a
famous composer and the father
of rocker Beck, the orchestral

background gives depth that
otherwise would be lacking on
"Empty Handed." Still somehow
even this song doesn't create the
mood change that the album so
desperately demands.
"Hotel Paper" is a good pop
album, and is perfect for the back
ground music at a middle school
girls' slumber party. Trying to
make the album reach any farther
than that is a stretch, but at least
Branch is giving it her all. By
breaking out of the mold she has
unknowingly set for herself as a
young female singer/songwriter,
Branch has the potential to ap
peal to wider audiences and actu
ally gain the musical maturity she
claims to have. Until she can do
that, though, she has to realize it is
hard to take seriously a 20-year
old girl whose songs all sound the
same, and whose singles appear
dailv on TRL.
