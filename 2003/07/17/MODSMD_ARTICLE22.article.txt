PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
Disney has made one hell of a comeback after
the painful embarrassment of "The Country
Bears," bursting into the summer scene with "Pi
rates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black
Pearl," a perfect film for the season.
Since this is, at its core, a Disney flick, you will
have to sit through the blatant unfolding of a
hit-you-over-the-head moral and an ultimately
boring romantic side story. Having said that, sit
ting through this fluff is almost painless, since the
rest of the movie is so much damn fun.
The curse of the Black Pearl, a ragged ship
that always brings fog into port with it, is con
nected to stolen Aztec gold and some very angry
ancient gods. Lead by Captain Barbossa (Geof
frey Rush), the filthy pirates that crew the
doomed ship have a nasty habit of turning into
half-decomposed skeletons whenever moon
light hits them.
"Pirates" runs a bit long, but in the end it
doesn't take away from the fun of the movie as a
whole. This is not necessarily a good movie, but
when it gets going, that doesn't really matter -
you're having way too much fun to care.

TERMINATOR 3
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," the
man who could be the next governor of Califor
nia plays T-101, a more advanced version of the
terminator that was reprogrammed to protect
Sarah Connor and son after he tried to assassi
nate her in the original "Terminator."
The noticeable difference in this movie is that
it's directed by Jonathan Mostow ("U-571"). 11
and T2, under James Cameron, focused primar
ily on character development and built the spe
cial effects around the plot.
All that's lost in "Terminator 3," a shoot-'em
up action movie that features more explosions
than the latest "Charlie's Angels" trailer.

But that's not to say "Terminator 3" isn't an
intelligent, economical summer action movie.
If James Cameron had been at the helm, no
doubt he would have pushed the envelope
further. Not with explosions, per say, as there
are only a number of ways you can blow a
monster truck to smithereens, but he would
have worked to develop the melodramatic
force of the material — with suspense, with
tension, with more at stake, psychologically
speaking.
" I erminator 3" works, but only on the surface
level: it's fun and free-spirited, yet you leave the
theater with the feeling as if the product is just a
little too robotic.

LEGALLY BLONDE 2
For those embarking on a quest to see "Legal
ly Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde," be warned:
unless you enjoyed the first in this series, you
may be bored out of your mind. Though there
are many well-delivered funny and silly mo
ments in this movie, they are not sufficient to
keep the uninterested awake for the entire nine
ty minutes.
Although Witherspoon's cotnedic perfor
mance is commendable, the plot is just mediocre
and not at all credible. In the sequel, Wither
spoon plays a bleeding-heart liberal who is des
perately trying to pass a bill to end all animal test
ing in cosmetic laboratories.
One big reason to watch this movie is the fash
ion. Prada and various other designers designed
Witherspoon's 90 plus costumes. If you look
close enough, you will also notice that Bruiser is
also wearing designer accessories and clothing,
including a diamond pendant necklace valued
over $1,000. It is also through and through a
"chick flick" so be sure that you are in the mood
for seeing a lot of pink.
Unless you thought the first "Legally Blonde"
was worthy of your time, save your money — the
sequel does not out-shine the first film.
