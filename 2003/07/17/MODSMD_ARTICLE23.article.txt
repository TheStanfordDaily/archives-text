# Mogwai's 'Happy Songs' sinks, then swims
## 
### DOUGLAS WILSON 
If the Scottish "post-punk" rockers known
as Mogwai have taught me anything in their
recent release "Happy Songs For Happy Peo
ple," it's that the musical cosmos, so to speak,
should never be written off. As one Mogwai
fan exclaimed in an apt speech sample that be
gins the band's 1997 album "Young Team,"
"If someone said that Mogwai are the stars, I
would not object. If the stars had a sound, it
would sound like this."
After one listen, I was ready to lambaste the
new album as tiresome and overly experimen
tal. Much like its predecessors, "Happy Songs
For Happy People" suffers the curse of the
group's disorientingly free-form style. But
after a few more rounds, I rediscovered that it
is precisely this indirection — the group's neb
ulous journeys into muddy, guitar-heavy
soundscapes—that make Mogwai's albums so
ultimately rewarding. Even if such rewards
are sometimes hard-earned.
Mogwai is an acquired taste. Relying on the
raw ethos and unrefined clamor of three gui
tars and complemented by a varying range of
instrumentation and murmured background

vocals, Mogwai's unique sound can sometimes
sound like unprocessed noise to the untrained
ear. Nevertheless, repeated listens often un
cover intricate and provocative musical effu
sions. A hybrid between Icelandic sensation
Sigur Ros and the much darker Godspeed
You Black Emperor, Mogwai has quickly
gained a dedicated following even beyond the
indie scene, drawing influences from metal
and electronica.
All that said, it should be noted that
"Happy Songs for Happy People" is unusu
ally wistful and ethereal for the group. Un
doubtedly, the most remarkable aspect of
the new style is the increased prominence of
instrumentalist Barry Burns' otherwordly,
gibbering vocals. More so than in previous
efforts, the vocals blend well with the chorus
of rumbling guitar lines, and are especially
effective in "Hunted By A Freak" and
"Killing All The Flies," two of the album's
most memorable tracks.
Not that this more pensive approach
means Mogwai is holding back on us. The hu
morous album title is clearly ironic, and the
core of Mogwai's characteristic intense, yearn
ing vibe is still present. And with this distinctive

vibe comes the album's greatest success —
Mogwai's uncanny ability to connect with the
listener, evoking complex, ineffable emotions
in which few other musicians dare to dabble.
This communicative power is perhaps most
apparent in the haunting piano chords and
brooding pulse of standout track, "I Know
You Are But What Am I?"
And although "Happy Songs for Happy
People" certainly boasts many such mo
ments in which Mogwai speaks to the very
soul, the album allows too many periods of
wearisome confusion. As in previous works,
Mogwai occasionally drifts into overly self
absorbed, brooding fits of musical chaos that
leave the listener hopelessly lost in the midst
of a sonic maelstrom. This is all too evident
in "Ratts of the Capital," which begins so
promisingly, but later descends into droning
experimentation.
Admittedly, however, several of these inac
cessible tempests of expression make Mog
wai's better moments all the more evocative by
contrast. Fittingly, this is the case in concluding
track "Stop Coming To My House," which,
after a breathtaking supernova of guitar lines,
ends the album with a dash of quiet, melodi-

Mogwai's cover conceals cosmic chaos.
ous splendor. It's almost as if the album has
given birth to some new star.
"Happy Songs For Happy People" may not
be as revolutionary as earlier works, but in the
end it represents a worthy step in Mogwai's
artistic evolution. And though the album is
anything except easy listening, nobody ever
said venturing into outer space was easy. In
deed, it's difficult to deny that the shining mo
ments of introspective, musical enlightenment
are well worth the travel time through the
patches of surrounding void.
