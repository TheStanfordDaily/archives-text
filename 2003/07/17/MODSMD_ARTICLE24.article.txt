## Wario World 
### ERIC FORD 
Wario, the official anti-superhero
of Nintendo land, has finally landed
his own gig on Nintendo's Gamecube.
Up until recently, Wario had been
delegated to such menial jobs as par
ticipating in kart racing and party
games (although he does have a de
cent Game Boy series under his belt).
With "Wario World," he now stars in
his own platformer, free of the dread
ed Mario and all those other normal
Nintendo characters.
Does Wario succeed in this 'cube
platformer? Only mildly, at best.
The game's storyline is as pre
dictable as they come. Instead of hav
ing to save a princess, Wario has to save
all of his hard-earned treasure from
evil monsters who have been cursed by
the dreaded black jewel. Plus, the en-

tire world has been twisted

into an even more evil ver-

sion of itself. Now,

Wario must go to the four corners of
the world and smack all of the mon
sters back into their former glory.
Lame? Definitely. But the story
doesn't make or break a platformer; it's
all about the gameplay.
The gameplay is probably the best
feature in "Wario World," next to the
decent graphics. The control is very
tight and incredibly simple. Wario pos
sesses a limited number of actual moves
he can perform in the game. While
some would think that less is bad, it isn't
so in this situation. Every move that
Wario has exists fora reason. In fact,
the player is expected to learn all the
simple combinations in order to contin
ue the game. The actual game takes
place in a quasi-3D form, meaning that
while everything is polygonal and pos
sess depth, the camera always makes
the player feel as if they are playing in a
2D world. The camera does the job for
the majority of the game, but it can
make jumping from ledge to ledge dif-

ficult, even with the

small amount of con-

trol the player has

camera. The environments contained
some variety, but it's only as good as the
graphics, which are average at best.
"Wario WorkT's drawbacks range
from minimal to severe, depending on
the gamer you are. The music and
sound effects are mediocre, and don't
have much of an impact on the game.
One thing to mention about the music:
the tune that plays when you pause the
game irritated the hell out of everyone
within hearing range. I won't attempt
to describe it; press pause and you'll
understand.
"Wario World" lacks of replay-abil
ity and variety. When I'm playing any
game, especially a platformer, I expect
some variety in my missions. The latest
Mario games are a perfect example: in
some missions, you have to battle
someone, in others race a villain or col
lect items or reach a hard location. In
Wario World, every mission has the
same exact objectives. When you enter
a level, your goal is to collect boss crys
tals, get to the end, defeat the level
boss, and move on, collecting treasure
on the way. In each level, you can find
up to eight pieces of treasure, with the
player earning a reward for collecting
the lot. An interesting reward is being
able to download mini-games to your
Game Boy Advance from the hit title
WarioWare. However, since the
games don't save to the GBA, you'd be
better off just buying the portable hit.
With the treasure being optional, and
sometimes really hard to find, it be
comes the only replay value each level
has.
If you can look past these faults of
"Wario World," it still comes up short,
literally. With only 12 levels to com
plete, a good gamer can breeze
through it in five hours, quite a short
jaunt for fifty dollars.
Wario fans may be interested in buy
ing this game, but for anyone else it may
not be worth it. At best, it's a good title to
rent on a weekend.
