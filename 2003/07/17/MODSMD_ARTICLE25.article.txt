"Modern Times"
Warner Bros, recently released new editions of four
classic Charlie Chaplin films — "The Cold Rush,"
"Modern Times," "The Great Dictator" and "Lime
light," — together as volume one of "The Chaplin Col
lection." Many defend "The Gold Rush" as the greatest
of Chaplin's works, but my money is on "Modern
Times" as the funniest and most poignant hour for ar
guably the greatest comedian of all time.
"Modern Times" is the last of Chaplin's (mainly)
silent classics, serving as a final gesture of defiance
against the technology and mechanization that Chap
lin saw as degrading to both film and human life in gen
eral. While the rest of Hollywood had already em
braced the newfangled wonder of sound for several
years, Chaplin held steady in his dedication to the
artistry and hilarity of silent film, proving with "M(xl
ern Times" (and, previously, "City Lights") that he
could say nothing and still tickle the funnybone and tug
at the heartstrings better than anyone else.
The film finds Chaplin's loveable Tramp, the hero
of most Chaplin films, working on an assembly line.
Pointedly, in Chaplin's world the people are still silent,
and only the machines speak. The Tramp's (literal) sac
rifice to the Great Cogs of Progress and his subsequent
descent into comic insanity are just the first step in a
ramshackle collection of adventures that will see him
roller skate through a department store, struggle to
break into jail and in the grand finale, explode glori
ously into nonsense song.
While Chaplin has a reputation as a control freak (he
wrote, directed and composed the music for all his
films), it's hard to argue with the perfect staging, timing
and insanely creative sense of the absurd present in
every scene; I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as
I do every time I watch the automated lunch machine.
And although it's all undercut by Chaplin's deep pes
simism about the world that we have inherited, "Mod
ern Times" ends on a note of hope, with the Tramp and
his new friend, a spunky gamin (Paulette Godard), sol
diering forward together.
