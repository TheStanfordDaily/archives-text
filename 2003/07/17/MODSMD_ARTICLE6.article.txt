## Gingrich unveils book Former Speaker of the House introduces new book about the Battle of Gettysburg 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
What if the Confederacy had won the
Battle of Gettysburg? This is the question
that former Speaker of the House Newt
Gringrich attempts to answer in his new
book entitled "Gettysburg," co-written with
historical fiction author William Forstchen.
Gingrich discussed the book's message and
signed autographs yesterday evening at the
Stanford Bookstore.
"It was driving us absolutely crazy that so
many history books and textbooks are just
plain dull," Gingrich said, acknowledging
that both he and Forstchen have doctoral
degrees in history. "To us, history is pas
sion, drama, comedy, tragedy. It's about
life, people and how they solve problems."
Gingrich termed the book "active histo
ry," writing that drops readers directly into
a specific time and place so they may expe
rience the action and emotion of an event
for themselves.
Before plunging into the project, both
Gingrich and Forstchen visited the battle
field at Gettysburg to evaluate the terrain
and visualize the setting and situation that
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Union
Gen. George Meade must have faced dur
ing the fateful four-day conflict.
"We wanted to get a feel for for why
these men acted the way they did," Gin
grich said. "What opportunities did they
have? What were their choices?"

For maximum authenticity, Gingrich
chose to wear typical 1863 civilian wool
clothing during the trip, even in 95 degree
heat.
The book centers on Lee's decision to at
tack the Union army head on and proposes
that he could have seized victory with a less
aggressive strategy'. To support this asser
tion, the authors tried to present the geo
graphical and military realities of the battle,
including small details like the steepness of
the creek bank and the hardship of lugging
horse-pulled cannons.
"Most historians think Lee made his mis
take in not trying to take Cemetery Hill on
the first day," Gingrich said. "But we think
this would have been a mistake, and that he
should have maneuvered away from the
Union army — made them find him."
Written as a novel, the book ends with a
telegraph from PreslDent. Abraham Lin
coln to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, ordering him
to engage Lee and prevent him from clos
ing in on the northern capital.
"I think the book presents both history
as it occurred and how it could have oc
curred, and asks what lessons can be
learned for comparing the two," Gingrich
said. "I also think it could teach a lot about
leadership, command and could even
apply to modern day."
He is particularly interested the connec
tion between the generals on both sides of
the conflict.
"Virtually all these men went to West
point, to each other's weddings, even chose
them to be their children's godparents," he
said. "I think that in itself is what makes this
war so poignant."
In his writing process, the authors used
letters, memoirs and newspaper clips in

order to flesh out the Civil War ambience
they hoped to convey.
"So much of what you read makes you
wonder how these men kept themselves
going," Gingrich said. "You read a clip by
the editor of the New York Herald who
watched his son die on the battlefield at
Gettysburg and you have to wonder.
"I think that's why we're so fascinated
with this war," he continued, "because of
the amazing heroism on both sides — the
people who died know that's exactly what
was going to happen."
Gingrich and Forstchen are currently
working on a second volume, promising to

answer the questions that the first book left
open-ended.
Previous to this project, the authors were
collaborating on a book analyzing alterna
tive outcomes to the Second World War.
While they had to temporarily abandon the
piece, Gingrich said that they hope to
restart their efforts on it in the near future.
Gingrich is a Distinguished Visiting Fel
low at the Hoover Institution. Serving as
Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999,
he now works a political analyst for the Fox
News Channel.
He has authored several other books, in
cluding "Saving Lives & Saving Money."
