A failed potential trans
former at the Palou Substa
tion has been identified as
the most likely cause of last
Thursday's campus-wide
power outage, according to
utilities director Mike Goff
in the Stanford Report
The transformer could have
created a large enough power
surge to shut down electricity
to the campus power system,
he said.
The outage lasted from 3:22
p.m. to 3:40 p.m., while campus
electricians scrambled to restore
power, system manager Steve
Briscombe told the Report.
While the power outage
did not directly affect Stan

ford Hospital, it briefly cut off
the generation of chilled
water and steam used in the
facility's air conditioning and
heating systems and steriliz
ers, Goff said.
At first, utilities staff be
lieved the outage might have
been caused by a problem with
the PG&E transmission service,
but the Report explained that
fluid was seen leaking from the
failed transformer the next
morning.
Because Facilities Opera
tions is currently upgrading
the substation, the electrical
system might be a little more
vulnerable to power outages,
Goff said.
