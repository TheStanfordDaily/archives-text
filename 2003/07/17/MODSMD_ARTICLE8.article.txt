# Archeology students help uncover San Francisco history
## Stanford assists Presidio excavation 
### ALIA FABBRO MOORE 
Stanford archeologists and students are working
in cooperation with Presidio Trust and the Nation
al Park Service to excavate a site in the Presidio area
of San Francisco. Headed by Barbara Voss, an as
sistant professor in anthropology, the tlig is located
in the eastern part of the Presidio, known as El Polin
Springs.
"This dig is part of a broader study of the Spanish-
Mexican colonial period in the Presidio," said Voss,
who has been researching the area since 1992.
According to Voss, the site was found dur
ing a 1997 survey of the Tennessee Hollow
Watershed. The five-year-old project is par
tially devoted to researching how the water
shed was used by Mexican and Spanish colo
nial populations between 1776 and 1847.
Using this data, the dig team hopes to draw con
clusions about native and colonial interactions
during this time period, according to the project's
Web site. The archeologists expressed their hope
that an evaluation of these relationships will help

the team piece together the evolution of the city of
San Francisco.
Information is currently being collected from his
torical research, excavation, laboratory analysis and
environmental studies, the site said.
The dig site was first home to a Spanish Fort, built
to protect the San Francisco Bay and serve as a set
tlement for the local Ohlone Native American pop
ulation. When Mexico declared independence from
Spain in 1821, the fort became a frontier outpost,
which was later converted into an important mili
tary base for the U.S. Army.
The Presidio was annexed to the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area in 1994 when the military
left the base.
"We want to know what kind of settlements grew
up around the colonial center â€” the people living
outside the walls," Voss said. "Women in particu
lar. The colonists who came to California were re
cruited as families. As a result, there were pretty
much as many women as men, and more children
than adults.
"But the records are Spanish
military documents," she contin
ued. "They only tell us about the
adult males.
"Archeology brings more of a
full picture," Voss added. "It's
democratic. Everyone threw
away trash."
The team hopes the excava
tion will reveal more about the
early life of Juanna Briones, a
Bay Area businesswomen,
landowner and entrepreneur.
A house belonging to the
Brione family still stands in Palo
Alto, and Santa Clara Superior
Court Judge John Herlihy re
cently ruled that the owners of
the Brione house must maintain
and repair it. The ruling also stat
ed that the house cannot be legal
ly demolished until 2008.
"[Juanna] owned a large tract
of land in Palo Alto," Voss said.

"She was Stanford's neighbor.
We're looking at the earlier part
of her life."
The dig is funded in part by
Stanford's Vice Provost of Un
dergraduate Education.
Presidio Trust became in
volved in the project in efforts to
evaluate the watershed's attrib
utes, expand public access and
preserve historical material that
is unearthed. Draining more
than 271 acres in the eastern Pre
sidio, the watershed acts as the
only freshwater source for the
marsh at Crissy Field, the Web
site said.
According to Presidio Trust
Spokesman Ron Sonenshine, the
dig is significant due to its unique
focus on Bay Area history.
"There's enough wonder
about the history of the Presidio
to warrant this excavation," So
nenshine said. "The more history
we learn the better it is. We just
can't get enough."
The site is open to the public
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
