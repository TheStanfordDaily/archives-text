# Stanford's 'Lysistrata' urges peace but plays for laughs

### KAREN WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"It's better to fuck than fight," said Rush
Rehm, director of "Lysistrata", a Stanford
Summer Theater production that opens
tonight at 8:00 p.m. in Pigott Theater.
This rendition of "Lysistrata" is a mod
ern adaptation of Aristophanes' 2,400
year old anti-war comedy about the male
sex's propensity for war, complete with
criticisms of the current administration's
justifications for the war in Iraq.
In the original play, the heroine Lysis
trata unites women on both sides of the
Peloponnesian War in a sex strike to
force their warring husbands to reach a
peace agreement.
"The play was written 2,000 years ago
but is completely relevant," said Anne
Gregory, Class of'o3, who plays the lead
role as Lysistrata. "It kind of makes one
question why war is necessary or [if] we
resort to it too quickly,"
Recent Stanford graduates joined
with professional actors to rehearse an
average of 48 hours per week this past
month for the production, which was
adapted to its current form by renowned
playwright and Stanford drama lecturer
Amy Freed, a 1998 Pulitzer Prize finalist.
"Amy [Freed] has such a natural feel,
for, you know, bodily humor, scatologi
cal stuff, wit, marvelously clever lan
guage, physical comedy. So if there's
anything I pushed, it was probably the
political side of it," Rehm, an associate
professor in the drama department and
the founder of SST, told the Stanford
New Service.
"I'd like the audience to laugh and
encourage them to think about the idio
cy and destruction of institutionalized
war," he said.
Even though the play takes specific

cracks at the current situation in Iraq,
Rehm said that its message is timeless.
"It's funny and simple â€” make love
not war," he said.
"Sadly the United States' contribution
to military violence is not limited to Iraq,"

he added. "It is in many places with [US]
troops or support for militaristic regimes.
It's not an one issue play."
While Rehm had been wanting to
bring "Lysistrata" to campus for over a
year, others previously read the play in

White Plaza on March 3 as part of a coor
dinated theatrical protest, which had par
ticipation from groups in 59 different
countries, against the then-pending war
in Iraq.
"It's pretty cool to be involved with
something worldwide," Gregory said. "It
ties you to something that is bigger than
just a small production."
New York actresses Kathryn Blume
and Sharron Bowe started the prior Lysis
trata project to foster dialogue about the
war. Actors in the SST production of "Ly
sistrata" are also hopeful of inspiring pub
lic discussion on the motives for all wars.
"It would be ideal if people take the
message that war is a little silly and ques
tion why our society constantly goes to
war," Gregory said.
Rehm sees theater acts like "Lysistra
ta" as a means of circumventing the cen
sorship and propaganda that he says per
meate mainstream media organizations.
"I think this is an artistic expression of
the same kind of action and commitment
that parts of the Stanford community
have shown with the rise of student ac
tivism," Rehm added.
"Being that we're doing it right across
from Hoover Tower, there's a sense of
simply refusing to be silent. Simply for
the sake of speaking out," said rising se
nior Audrey Hannah, who plays Silico
nia, one of Lysistrata's female sidekicks.
Despite its serious political message,
"Lysistrata" is a classic raunchy Greek
comedy.
"How many synonyms can you come
up with for penis - they are probably all
in the play," Gregory said.
Performances will be held through
Aug. 9. Tickets are available at the I res
sider Box Office and the Pigott Box Office
