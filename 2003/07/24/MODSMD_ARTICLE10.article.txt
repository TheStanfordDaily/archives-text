# Union, hospitals in dispute
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the cutting-edge facilities of
the James H. Clark Center for
Bio-X multidisciplinary research
are readied for occupation,
SEIU Local 715 and the hospitals
are in controversy over the desig
nation of the building's soon-to
be housekeepers.
The hospitals have been filling
these new positions with non
unionized worker. The union
claims that the new center's house
keepers will form a unit eligible for
collective bargaining, thus making
way for them to join 715.
The union claims that prece
dence was set in a ruling earlier
this year by the National Labor
Relations Board against the hos
pitals and in favor of the union
on April 28 in relation to the
Clinical Cancer Center at Stan
ford, another hospital-affiliated
center whose housekeepers were
not previously considered eligi
ble by the hospitals for collective
bargaining. The board ordered
the hospitals to allow collective
bargaining at the center, to re
lease all information to the union
regarding non-temporary em
ployees at the center and include
the status of the workers' health
care plans — often a focal point
of contract negotiations
Maria La Ganga, the director
of news and communications for
the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, who is representing
both hospitals, the Medical Cen
ter and the University in the mat
ter, explained the hospitals' in
volvement in staffing the cancer
center.
"Under the same contract
with the university, the hospitals'
General Services Department
hired workers for the [cancer
center]. Because the recognition
clause does not list this center,
those workers are not represent
ed by the SEIU. In a very nar
rowly focused decision, the Na

tional Labor Relations Board
ruled in favor of the SEIU, which
had argued that these workers
have the right to unionize and
join Local 715. We are appealing
this decision. We also believe that
it does not set a precedent.
"Again, housekeepers at the
[center] enjoy the same wage
scale, benefits and paid time off
as all other housekeepers em
ployed by the hospitals," she
added. This claim has been con
tested by the union.
La Ganga maintained that the
new center was not included in
the locations where the union "is
the sole and exclusive represen
tative of those employees for the
purpose of collective bargaining.
"The recognition clause does
not list the Clark Center, there
fore employees based at the
Clark Center aje not represent
ed by the SEIU. What is impor
tant to note, however, is that all
housekeepers employed by the
hospitals enjoy the same wage
scale, benefits and paid time
off — no matter where they
work or whether they are repre
sented by the SEIU."
This last claim has been con
tested by the union.
Last Thursday, union repre
sentatives and workers made a
surprise appearance at Stanford
Hospital CEO Martha Marsh's
office, where they presented one
of her aides with a petition sup
porting the unionization of the
Clark Center housekeepers.
"As you know," the petition
read, "the National Labor Rela
tions board at every level has al
ready determined that hospital
management is incorrect in its
position that the housekeepers at
the Cancer Center are not part of
our bargaining unit. It is a shame
that the hospitals would rather
spend thousands of dollars on
fruitless litigation thdn on im
proving quality patient care.'

After bluffing their way into Stanford Hospital CEO Martha Marsh's office last
Thursday, union members and organizers present one of Marsh's assistants
with a petition to allow housekeepers at the new Clark Center to unionize.
Roxana Rivera, a union leader,
said that the board's decision con
cerning the cancer center should
carry over to the new center.
"Once again, we're going to be

pursuing this issue through the
[board] in regards to the house
keeping positions at the Clark
Center," she said. "Workers have
fought hard to retain just stan
dards for all workers at the hos
pital and that workers will stand
united against any actions
against these standards that they
fought for and won."
