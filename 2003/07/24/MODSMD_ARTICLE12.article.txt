## Struggling with objective and explanatory science journalism 
### KEVIN COOL GUEST COLUMNIST 
If you're an editor, science can get you
in trouble. And I speak from experi
ence.
Articles about science present daunting
complexities, but getting the facts right is
the easy part. Making the science under
standable without screwing up the facts,
that's what's tricky.
As if stem-cell science weren't already
tough enough to explain, our cover story in
the May/June issue [of Stanford Magazine]
also tried to thoroughly analyze the ethical
debate, sort out confusion and disagree
ment about terms like "nuclear transplan
tation," and describe how religious and
philosophical arguments intersect with pol
icy-making at Stanford and in Washington.
I will let others judge the quality of our cov
erage, but I'm satisfied that our article in
creased readers' understanding about the
issues surrounding the research and the
implications of the debate.
It was important to us not only to get the
story right but also to be fair. Although I ex
pressed support for the research in my ed
itor's column, our feature article was de

signed to be even-handed and to give ade
quate prominence to critics of embryonic
stem-cell study.
Any journalist comes to a story with an
embedded set of influences and assump
tions that can color the tone and direction
of a piece. In our case, finding balance is
more difficult because we are reporting
about the institution that employs us.
Thankfully, we have broad autonomy to
present both sides of any contentious issue,
to fairly characterize opinions and posi
tions that run counter to the University's,
and to delve into controversial subjects that
might make administrators uneasy.
As an editor, I naturally advocate a ro
bust and forthcoming treatment of con
troversial subjects. But the people who
really endorse the practice are those who
get the phone calls and e-mails from
alumni distraught or angry after reading
an article that reminds them of a Univer
sity position they oppose. No doubt there
have been some of those calls related to
the stem-cell institute and our stories
about it. Fortunately, Stanford's adminis
tration recognizes the value of spirited
debate, even when the debate makes for
some uncomfortable moments, and in

doing so builds trust and goodwill among
its constituents.
Our readers — smart, sophisticated
and wary of "spin" — would not long tol
erate a publication that was merely a shill
for the University. We have a responsibil
ity to them, but also a responsibility to
Stanford. We strive for what an editor at
Cornell once described as "sympathetic
objectivity."
In other words, we give the University
the benefit of the doubt, and make ever)' at
tempt to present Stanford's side of things
as thoroughly as we can. Readers may dis
agree about how successfully we navigate
this line between journalistic integrity and
university countenance. It's fair to say we
tell stories that most other alumni publica
tions would not, and that both our readers
and the University benefit as a result.
Every article requires dozens of deci
sions to strike the proper balance. To illus
trate, let me use an example from the
stem-cell story. A prominent critic of Stan
ford's stem-cell institute is Leon Kass, who
chaired President Bush's panel on
bioethics. Kass had written withering de
nunciations of the research prior to his ap
pointment as chair, and has a long history

of opposing research that manipulates the
human genome. Given that, some be
lieved his opinions should be viewed as less
than credible.
Was it important for readers to know
that Kass took a partisan view of stem-cell
research? Ultimately, we decided that it
was not. People on both sides have com
pelling personal motivations — commer
cial, scientific, ideological — that helped
shape their views. Since we did not scruti
nize the motivation of the Stanford scien
tists who were prominent in the article, it
seemed unfair to characterize Kass in a way
that might impugn the integrity of his
opinions. We felt it was enough to say that
he was a "conservative medical ethicist,"
and left it up to readers to decide whose ar
guments were most persuasive.
In short, our story on stem-cell research
was like any other story about a con
tentious subject: it made administrators
nervous, made readers think and made us
happy to have contributed some small part
to the debate.
