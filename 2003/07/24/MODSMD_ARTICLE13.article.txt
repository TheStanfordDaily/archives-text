# PEDANTIC POETICS
## Eulogy to Palo Alto pastimes 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Enough of this somber polit
ical nonsense. It's summer,
and according to the Vani
ty Fair meteorologist, it's the sea
son for parties and no, serious
child, they don't mean political
parties.
But where to go? The Hamp
tons are booked straight through
August, Paris has turned vegetar
ian and Sharm El Sheikh has
been having an off-season since
the intifada.
This campus is quiet, the deca
dent Daily parties have strict face
control and Palo Alto is one
sprawling nursing home for the
prematurely exhausted by their
upward mobility (minus Q's,
which has attracted only the very
courageous and the very tattooed
since a patron was shot in the
head).
For the rest of us, the restless
but not overly brave, what is
there to do? As a local of some
years and standing, I can assure
you — not much. And it's getting
worse.
Happy Donuts, a 24-hour
doughnut shop just a stumble

down from Ernie's Liquors, has
recently changed management.
Jim, the smiling man who never
slept and always served fresh
doughnuts, has been replaced,
reportedly by a large robotic oc
topus that can spear up to eight
concurrent doughnut orders
with its gruesomely nouveau ten
tacles.
Across the street from Happy's
and a few blocks closer to Palo
Alto's menacing and tensely dis
puted border with Mountain
View is Palo Alto Bowl (or "Plan
B" as it's known by local high
school kids). This haven for the
not-too-reckless and painfully
bored offers 50-cent thimbles of
low-grade beer on Thursdays
and wild discorama on Satur
days.
There are rumors that the
bowling alley might also undergo
"economic readjustment." Ap
parently, Palo Alto Bowl occupies
a sizeable chunk of prime real es
tate on El Camino. Splitting it up
into office buildings for Palo
Alto's burgeoning post-recession
industries — repo services, temp
agencies and law-firms specializ
ing in swift pre-bankruptcy di
vorce settlements — offers eco

nomic advantages unheard of
since that man tried to sell his
kidneys on eßay.
On the streets, there are
murkier explanations — nothing
to print in a paper — for the ru
mored demise of Palo Alto Bowl.
Local bowling enthusiast Kellen
Yee explained: "Traditional

bowling crowds have dissipated.
Remember that dumb advertis
ing campaign, 'Take the Skin
heads Bowling' or whatever. Well
it worked. The EPA chapter of
the KKK came for thirsty Thurs
days, had a few too many and got
very romantic."
Mr. Yee revealed a tattoo, in

an intimate region: a black and
white portrait of Goebells etched
in heartfelt detail with the words
"Bowling Buds 4-ever" neatly
inked around it.
"There were dozens of such
stories," finished Yee, rubbing
