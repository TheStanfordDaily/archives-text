# PEDANTIC POETICS
## Eulogy to Palo Alto pastimes 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Enough of this somber polit
ical nonsense. It's summer,
and according to the Vani
ty Fair meteorologist, it's the sea
son for parties and no, serious
child, they don't mean political
parties.
But where to go? The Hamp
tons are booked straight through
August, Paris has turned vegetar
ian and Sharm El Sheikh has
been having an off-season since
the intifada.
This campus is quiet, the deca
dent Daily parties have strict face
control and Palo Alto is one
sprawling nursing home for the
prematurely exhausted by their
upward mobility (minus Q's,
which has attracted only the very
courageous and the very tattooed
since a patron was shot in the
head).
For the rest of us, the restless
but not overly brave, what is
there to do? As a local of some
years and standing, I can assure
you — not much. And it's getting
worse.
Happy Donuts, a 24-hour
doughnut shop just a stumble

down from Ernie's Liquors, has
recently changed management.
Jim, the smiling man who never
slept and always served fresh
doughnuts, has been replaced,
reportedly by a large robotic oc
topus that can spear up to eight
concurrent doughnut orders
with its gruesomely nouveau ten
tacles.
Across the street from Happy's
and a few blocks closer to Palo
Alto's menacing and tensely dis
puted border with Mountain
View is Palo Alto Bowl (or "Plan
B" as it's known by local high
school kids). This haven for the
not-too-reckless and painfully
bored offers 50-cent thimbles of
low-grade beer on Thursdays
and wild discorama on Satur
days.
There are rumors that the
bowling alley might also undergo
"economic readjustment." Ap
parently, Palo Alto Bowl occupies
a sizeable chunk of prime real es
tate on El Camino. Splitting it up
into office buildings for Palo
Alto's burgeoning post-recession
industries — repo services, temp
agencies and law-firms specializ
ing in swift pre-bankruptcy di
vorce settlements — offers eco

nomic advantages unheard of
since that man tried to sell his
kidneys on eßay.
On the streets, there are
murkier explanations — nothing
to print in a paper — for the ru
mored demise of Palo Alto Bowl.
Local bowling enthusiast Kellen
Yee explained: "Traditional

bowling crowds have dissipated.
Remember that dumb advertis
ing campaign, 'Take the Skin
heads Bowling' or whatever. Well
it worked. The EPA chapter of
the KKK came for thirsty Thurs
days, had a few too many and got
very romantic."
Mr. Yee revealed a tattoo, in

an intimate region: a black and
white portrait of Goebells etched
in heartfelt detail with the words
"Bowling Buds 4-ever" neatly
inked around it.
"There were dozens of such
stories," finished Yee, rubbing

his rump with pride, despair and
a twist of stoic endurance. Some
days later Mr. Yee was sighted at
Q's, playing pool with recovering
skinheads.
Houses of entertainment for
the older and more alcoholic
populations haven't been
spared. A watering hole for thir
ty years, Antonio's Nuthouse has
suffered worse than economic
drought.
An anonymous employee con
fessed the bar has troubles:
"There's a thirty-nine-year-old
neighbor, who moved in this
year. She's lodged noise com
plaints: the city council is consid
ering shutting us down." Al
ready, the bar has closed its out
door seating area after 10 p.m.
An area once devoted to cama
raderie, brews and second-hand
cancer.
While the council deliberates,
the employees of the Nuthouse
have launched a petition effort.
All those in favor of God, Family
or our Democracy are encour
aged to sign. The uncommitted
reader need only consider his or
her options: if not for the Nut
house, only the terrible and the
horrible would remain. Either
one would attend the terribly
pricey bars of pre-bust Palo Alto
(F&A, Nola, Blue Chalk, etc) or
one would chance the horrify
ing Island Food and Grog,
which has been known to host
knife-fights.
The trouble at the Nuthouse
only confirms the National Bu
reau of Economic Research's tri
umphant proclamation. The re
cession must be over. A starving
and unemployed vampire would
sooner turn down a job at the
blood bank than a bar would
choose to close during hard
times.
Looking for answers, a pack of
cigarettes and a slurpee, your
columnist went to a neighbor
hood convenience store. Where
interviewing failed, wheedling
succeeded. Three camels, a fanta
and a box of diapers bought the
Daily a conversation with Palo
Alto's ruling gossip-queen, Gabe
Fossati.
Columnist: Mr. Fossati, they
say you've slipped a silk thread
around each ankle in Palo Alto.
You know our comings and go
ings. You know how we dance,
and who cheats on their morning
jog. What can you tell me about
these catastrophes?
Fossati: First, you know as
well as I that Palo Alto has never
been an entertainment center.
Look at those kids slamming Ro
bitussin. Kids have been gulping
cough medicine in this alley since
before pterodactyls. You think
their throats hurt? They're

bored. Terminally bored. Why?
Because they live in the suburbs.
Decades ago, fun packed up and
left.
C: Fun left? Where did it go?
F: It went to die. It's buried at
the University of Chicago. With
Elvis, Osama and other mis
placed victims of overdose and
capitalism .. .
C: [interrupting] Mr. Fossati,
thank you, that's enough. I'm
trying to be relevant and apoliti
cal. What do you know about the
recent changes at Happy's, Palo
Alto Bowl and the Nuthouse?
F: The Nuthouse? Well, peo
ple will tell you about some sleep
less lady and her acute dog-ears,
but a friend of mine at the de
partment says different. Friend
says the place incurred some
heavy fines for serving minors.
But it's going to stay open.
They've hired some new staff
and they're getting rid of their
high chairs and the nipple
equipped beer bottles. As for the
rest of it, you better come to the
service and see for yourself.
The service turned out to be a
modest wake, held on a promon
tory peak at Foothill Park. There
is no more affectionate perspec
tive on Silicon Valley's gentle
suburbia than this point. Here,
with a sigh, the suburban be
comes the pastoral. Reader, if
you haven't been, you absolutely
must go.
The mourners had assembled
around a large plastic cube. One
side of the cube was made out of
glass. They referred to it as the
coffin and kept a respectful dis
tance. For the most part they
were men trying to still look like
boys, smoking American ciga
rettes, wearing their polos ironi
cally.
Someone jangled their car
keys. The note was picked up
and repeated. Fossati cleared his
throat, approached the cube and
began:
"Here was a land. We have cy
cled over its roads, and played
golf in its grasses. Here, we have
walked, picnicked, quaffed
quaint Napa wines. Some dis
missed all our joys as provincial,
suburban. I would challenge
them to find other, less comfort
able joys."
The eulogy strayed far be
yond the meager ration of space
I have left to relate it. It ended
with hope and a prayer. With
their heads bowed, the crowd re
peated after Fossati, "God, be
fore saving the queen, save the
Nuthouse."
Then they sacrificed the cube
and drove home.

Ilya smokes too many American ciga
rettes and wears his polos ironically.
You can find him drinking on Mondays
and bowling on Thursdays. Where?
