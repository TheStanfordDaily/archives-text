## The
						country that money built 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Money is a vulgar topic. But
I don't like dealing with
vulgarities, so this column
isn't about money. It's about the
country that money built.
My colleague, Jennifer Gra
ham, inspired me with her July
17 column about her journey to
Fort Wayne, Indiana, to write my
own travel column. So last Thurs
day night, I packed my bags and
set my alarm clock. Early the next
morning, I stepped out of my
apartment and caught a cab for
the Gare de Lyon.
The TGV that runs between
Paris and the French Riviera is
the fastest train in Europe. It

takes just over three hours to
reach the port city of Marseilles.
From there on, the train winds
lazily along the coast eastward to
ward Cannes, Nice and Monaco.
The principality of Monaco is
the second smallest independent
state in the world. With a sover
eign territory of .75 square miles,
it is about five times the size of the
Vatican City State. Its population
of about 32,000 pegs it at rough
ly half the size of Palo Alto. One of
its claims to fame is that it is the
country with the highest popula
tion density in the world: 42,000
people a square mile.
But fat wallets are Monaco's
real selling point. This sliver of
land perched on sheer cliffs over
looking the Mediterranean

boasts the sixth highest Gross Do
mestic Product per capita in the
world. And the real magic of
Monaco — the average net worth
of its residents and their average
annual income — is not pub
lished. But with studio condo
miniums in this tiny state starting
at 358,000 Euro (US $404,000)
and running up to 880,000 Euro
(US $993,000), the average in
come may as well read "f-ing
high" (which, of course, would
sound more elegant in Monaco's
official language, French).
I had an afternoon to see
Monaco. Because of its moun
tainous terrain, it's not easily
walkable, unless your idea of fun
