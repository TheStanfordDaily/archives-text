## The 						country that money built 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Money is a vulgar topic. But
I don't like dealing with
vulgarities, so this column
isn't about money. It's about the
country that money built.
My colleague, Jennifer Gra
ham, inspired me with her July
17 column about her journey to
Fort Wayne, Indiana, to write my
own travel column. So last Thurs
day night, I packed my bags and
set my alarm clock. Early the next
morning, I stepped out of my
apartment and caught a cab for
the Gare de Lyon.
The TGV that runs between
Paris and the French Riviera is
the fastest train in Europe. It

takes just over three hours to
reach the port city of Marseilles.
From there on, the train winds
lazily along the coast eastward to
ward Cannes, Nice and Monaco.
The principality of Monaco is
the second smallest independent
state in the world. With a sover
eign territory of .75 square miles,
it is about five times the size of the
Vatican City State. Its population
of about 32,000 pegs it at rough
ly half the size of Palo Alto. One of
its claims to fame is that it is the
country with the highest popula
tion density in the world: 42,000
people a square mile.
But fat wallets are Monaco's
real selling point. This sliver of
land perched on sheer cliffs over
looking the Mediterranean

boasts the sixth highest Gross Do
mestic Product per capita in the
world. And the real magic of
Monaco — the average net worth
of its residents and their average
annual income — is not pub
lished. But with studio condo
miniums in this tiny state starting
at 358,000 Euro (US $404,000)
and running up to 880,000 Euro
(US $993,000), the average in
come may as well read "f-ing
high" (which, of course, would
sound more elegant in Monaco's
official language, French).
I had an afternoon to see
Monaco. Because of its moun
tainous terrain, it's not easily
walkable, unless your idea of fun
is taking outside elevators up and
down every 10 minutes or you
enjoy walking along busy streets
that wind through narrow
crevices and canyons. I don't
particularly care for either of
these two activities, so I decided
to rent a motor scooter (more fa
mous in Italy as the Vespa).
I hadn't brought my driver's
license with me, but I figured
that in the world's favorite tax
haven, the law would probably
take a back seat to a little money.
I was right. After I explained my
situation, the owner of the scoot
er stand smiled and accepted my
MasterCard as if it were a French
driver's license. He showed me
how to drive the contraption —
this vehicle that is the transport
staple of all southern European
cities — and I scooted off toward
my first destination: the famous
Casino.
If Fort Wayne is the land of
the riding lawn mower, Monaco
is the land of the Rolls Royce.
Outside the Casino, with its
guards at the door to make sure
its guests are appropriately
dressed. stand row upon row of
classic Bentlevs, well-polished
Rolls and brand new Ferraris. It's
an auto-lover's paradise.
The harbor is home to the
boating equivalent of these cars.
Yachts one could only guess the
length of line this port, hailing
from the remote-sounding
shores of Amalfi and Madeira.
After ogling the lavish materi
al possessions of Europe's rich
and famous, I spent the rest of
the afternoon cruising through
the mountainous countryside
surrounding the port.
As the beautiful azure color of
the sea began to fade to a deep
sunset purple, 1 made my way
back to the marble-lined tunnel
that leads to the Monaco-Monte
Carlo train station. I stepped
onto the train, the conductor
blew his whistle, the doors swung
shut. Slowly, the train wound its
way out of the principality.
I like to think that I learn
something every time I travel.
Even in a city as pleasure-orient
ed as Monaco, it is possible to
learn something valuable.
What, you ask, did my trip to
Monaco teach me? (1) Life is good
when you don't have to pay in
come tax. (2) Life is even better in
a semi-tropical climate. And (3), I
want Monegasque citizenship.
