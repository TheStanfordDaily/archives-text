# Why the 'progressive' Left hates America
## 
### ANDY CLAVIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
There exists a lot of hypocrisy in the American
Left. How can the Left be totally anti-war but
claim to support equal rights and social jus
tice for all? How can they find total vindication in
one potentially incorrect intelligence statement
when the evidence is nonetheless overwhelming
against Saddam Hussein's brutality? How can the
Left, which claims to be progressive and open
minded, be so intolerant of any conservative
thought on campus?
To me, the answer is simple: the Left hates
America more than they love freedom.
Obviously America is not a perfect place. We
have a history of slavery, racism and social injustice,
just as virtually every other nation does. But the
main difference between us and all other nations is
that America continues to improve dramatically in
a relatively short historical period. Like no other
nation, America modernizes and adapts to better
ways of living.
We have embraced social movements to end
slavery, eliminate racist public policy, achieve
women's suffrage and improve our relationship
with the environment. The standard of living in
America is better than most other nations, and has
been for at least the last 50 years. American techno
logical innovations, from the automobile to the air
plane, from the light bulb to television, have im
measurably improved not only the lives of Ameri
cans, but the lives of billions of human beings.
But most important is America's everlasting, un
derlying principle: freedom. In America we are
free to do as we please, so long as we do not harm
ourselves or others. We owe no allegiance to any
dictator. We are not forced to pay taxes without
representation. We are not constantly subject to
the government's whims. In America we are free to
say and do what we want. This is not true in many
parts of the world, but the Left never accounts for
this.
I believe the first major problem with the Left is
that they take their Americanism for granted. They
use their First Amendment rights to the fullest, or
ganizing protests and brazenly communicating
controversial, anti-government messages. No one
is denying them this right, but their actions are very
hypocritical. They use their rights of free speech to
support the regimes of Saddam Hussein, Fidel Cas

tro and other tyrannical dictators who prohibit free
speech in their own countries.
In these protests, the Left would much rather chas
tise President Bush than Saddam Hussein. In many
cases, they compare the two as equal, or even say that
Bush is worse. What logical person can make this
claim? Saddam Hussein has killed millions of people,
including many of his own citizens. His regime was
brutal and ruthless, allowing no freedom of speech or
of the press. U.S. troops have uncovered countless
torture chambers and military outposts hidden be
neath hospitals and elementary schools in Iraq. These
are truly evil things. President Bush comes nowhere
close to that sort of evil. Regardless, the Left is eager to
morally equate Bush with Saddam, because they hate
America more than they love freedom.
The Left is vehemently anti-war, saying that
America is has no place invading Iraq. But we
didn't hear this from the Iraqi-American popula
tion, who largely supported the war. In fact, thou
sands of Iraqis and other Middle-Easterners
marched in New York City several months ago in
favor of the war.
In addition, countless Iranian-Americans are
currently engaged in a summer-long protest to
bring democracy to Iran. I've personally seen these
protestors in Los Angeles and Washington D.C,
and it's very encouraging. The Iraqi-American and
Iranian-American populations overwhelmingly
supported the war because they wanted to export
freedom to their home countries. They immigrated
to America to live a free life, and they wanted the
same for their fellow countrymen back in the Mid
dle-East. They know of the horrible oppression in
their home countries and are grateful that the U.S.
is putting an end to it.
But most left-wing protestors know nothing
about living under dictatorships, so they do not feel
empathy for oppressed people living in the Middle-
East. They have grown complacent living in Amer
ica and are virulently critical of it, because it's all
they know to criticize. There is no complaint from
the Left against other nations unless those nations
support the U.S.
Yet if the Left cares so much about human rights,
why don't they speak out against oppression in the
Middle-East? Where is the outcry for human rights
in Egypt, where homosexuals are imprisoned daily?
Where is the anger against Sudan, where fathers are
allowed to murder their daughter
if they believe she disgraces the
family honor? Where is the out
rage against the commonplace

abuse of women in most Arab
countries? Where is the condem
nation of fundamentalist-Islamic
terrorism?
The Left fails to address these
issues because they aren't at the
top of their agenda. Instead, they
berate America for its Haws,
though they pale in comparison

to the atrocities and widespread
oppression in the Middle-East.
Why? Because the Left hates
America more than they love
freedom.

say and do what we want. This is not true in many
parts of the world, but the Left never accounts for
this.
I believe the first major problem with the Left is
that they take their Americanism for granted. They
use their First Amendment rights to the fullest, or
ganizing protests and brazenly communicating
controversial, anti-government messages. No one
is denying them this right, but their actions are very
hypocritical. They use their rights of free speech to
support the regimes of Saddam Hussein, Fidel Cas

tro and other tyrannical dictators who prohibit free
speech in their own countries.
In these protests, the Left would much rather chas
tise President Bush than Saddam Hussein. In many
cases, they compare the two as equal, or even say that
Bush is worse. What logical person can make this
claim? Saddam Hussein has killed millions of people,
including many of his own citizens. His regime was
brutal and ruthless, allowing no freedom of speech or
of the press. U.S. troops have uncovered countless
torture chambers and military outposts hidden be
neath hospitals and elementary schools in Iraq. These
are truly evil things. President Bush comes nowhere
close to that sort of evil. Regardless, the Left is eager to
morally equate Bush with Saddam, because they hate
America more than they love freedom.
The Left is vehemently anti-war, saying that
America is has no place invading Iraq. But we
didn't hear this from the Iraqi-American popula
tion, who largely supported the war. In fact, thou
sands of Iraqis and other Middle-Easterners
marched in New York City several months ago in
favor of the war.
In addition, countless Iranian-Americans are
currently engaged in a summer-long protest to
bring democracy to Iran. I've personally seen these
protestors in Los Angeles and Washington D.C,
and it's very encouraging. The Iraqi-American and
Iranian-American populations overwhelmingly
supported the war because they wanted to export
freedom to their home countries. They immigrated
to America to live a free life, and they wanted the
same for their fellow countrymen back in the Mid
dle-East. They know of the horrible oppression in
their home countries and are grateful that the U.S.
is putting an end to it.
But most left-wing protestors know nothing
about living under dictatorships, so they do not feel
empathy for oppressed people living in the Middle-
East. They have grown complacent living in Amer
ica and are virulently critical of it, because it's all
they know to criticize. There is no complaint from
the Left against other nations unless those nations
support the U.S.
Yet if the Left cares so much about human rights,
why don't they speak out against oppression in the
Middle-East? Where is the outcry for human rights
in Egypt, where homosexuals are imprisoned daily?
Where is the anger against Sudan, where fathers are
allowed to murder their daughter
if they believe she disgraces the
family honor? Where is the out
rage against the commonplace

abuse of women in most Arab
countries? Where is the condem
nation of fundamentalist-Islamic
terrorism?
The Left fails to address these
issues because they aren't at the
top of their agenda. Instead, they
berate America for its Haws,
though they pale in comparison

to the atrocities and widespread
oppression in the Middle-East.
Why? Because the Left hates
America more than they love
freedom.
