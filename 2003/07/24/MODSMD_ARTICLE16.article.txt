## Stars shine at Bank of the West First WTA tournament of the summer hardcourt season swings into the Taube Family Tennis Center 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Manifest Destiny takes on a whole new meaning
this week as the top players in women's tennis trav
el from the far reaches of the globe to Stanford for
the 2003 Bank of the West Classic.
The field of athletes boasts five of the top 20 play
ers in the world and represents 11 countries. In the
hunt fora piece of the $035,000 purse are second
ranked and 2001 Classic champion Kim Clijsters
and No. 7 and 2002 Australian Open titleholder
Jennifer Capriati.
The tourney also marks the homecoming of for
mer Cardinal athletes, including Laura Granville
and Gabriela Lastra, who will be joined by Stanford
frosh phenom Amber Liu during their return to the
Taube Family Tennis Center. The trio boasts seven
NCAA titles between them and is likely to use the
homecourt to its advantage in both the singles draw
— Granville picked up the 2000 and 2001 NCAA
singles title, while Liu capped her rookie campaign
in June with another singles championship for the
Farm — and doubles play — Lastra teamed up with
Cardinal alumna Lauren Kalveria to win the 2002
NCAA doubles crown.
In its 33rd year, the Bank of the West Classic is
the longest-running female-only professional ten

nis tournament in the world and this marks the
sixth year the event has been hosted on the Farm.
The matches, which run from July 21-27, are ex
pected to exceed last year's crowds of 45,000 spec
tators.
2002 Classic champion Venus Williams did not
return to this year's draw because, barring Grand
Slams, she does not normally enter the same tour
naments as her sister. Anticipation was building as
Serena — just named Best Female Athlete and Best
Female Tennis Player at the 2003 ESPYs — pre
pared to defend her sister's title in her debut at the
event. But pain in her left knee forced her to with
draw from the event. Another big name, and per
haps the most marketable name in the sport, was
lost when Anna Kournikova withdrew due to
chronic back pain.
Kim Clijsters, who recently reached the semifi
nals at Wimbledon, has enjoyed success in the last
two Classics. After winning the title in 2001, she lost
to Venus Williams in the 2002 Classics final match
and will be hoping to avenge that loss this week.
Jennifer Capriati's comeback in 2001, when she
picked up championships at the French Open and
Australian Open, vaulted her back to the top of
women's tennis. Capriati will be searching for her
first-ever Classic title this week, hoping to join the
ranks of past winners Venus Williams, Lindsay
Davenport, Monica Seles and Martina Navratilova.
Some other notable competitors in the tourna
ment will be Jelena Dokic, ranked No. 12 in the
world, and the doubles team of Christina Fusano
and Raquel Kops-Jones, both of whom play at the
Universitv of California-Berkeley.
