# No Barnes magic at Wizards camp
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Former Stanford guard Julius Barnes was cut
by the Washington Wizards Sunday, following
four days of mini-camp in preparation fora week
of summer league games in Boston. If the Wizards'
82-50 loss to Atlanta in their summer league open
er is a sign of things to come, they might think
twice about dumping the undrafted free agent
who was one of the most athletic players to ever
don a Cardinal basketball uniform.
Following Stanford's 85-74 loss to UConn in the
second round of the NCAA tournament, Barnes,
who poured in a team-high 23 points in the defeat,
had little time to reflect on his senior season — in
which he led the Cardinal in scoring with 16 points
per game and earned first team All Pac-10 honors.
More importantly, Barnes helped Stanford to 24
wins, a victory over then-No. 1 Arizona in Tucson
and ultimately another trip to the NCAA tourna
ment in a season many analysts originally forecast
ed as culminating in an NIT bid.
It was a rewarding senior season for sure. After
starting point guard Chris Hernandez went down
with an injury early in the season, Barnes was
called on to orchestrate the Cardinal offense at
times and performed admirably, averaging a
team-best 3.8 assists per game. The situation gave
scouts a look at what the 6-1 Barnes can do
in his projected NBA position.
"The knock on me has been that I'm a
scorer in a point guard's body," Barnes
said.
While his Stanford teammates could
reflect on their accomplishments and
ponder the necessary preparation for the
next season, the loss to the Huskies
marked the beginning of next step in
Barnes' quest to play in the NBA.
"It began on the flight home from
Spokane," Barnes said. "The mindset was,
'things are going'to get harder now.'"
Barnes got a taste of just how much
harder it would get, as he worked out for
about 10 teams before June's NBA Draft,
including the Blazers, Raptors, Nuggets,
Warriors, Clippers and Suns
According to Barnes, he received posi
tive feedback from officials with several
teams, but on draft night, of the 58 college
and high school players' names called,
Barnes' was not one of them.
"It would've been good to be drafted
but it doesn't always work out," said
Barnes, who added he was surprised for
mer college standouts Hollis Price and
Jason Gardner, among others, also
weren't drafted.
Following the draft, Barnes agreed to
attend mini-camp with the Wizards, a
team he did not work out for previously.
"The phone wasn't ringing off the
hook, but I'm fortunate enough to have
an agent who found me an opportunity,"
Barnes said during mini-camp.

And so Barnes made his way to Wash
ington, where most of the faces in practice
were new to him — a group of rookies,
young players and undrafted free agents.
There were some familiar faces, too.
Former Cal standout Joe Shipp, who
also failed to make the final cut, roomed
with Barnes during mini-camp.
New Wizards President of Basketball
Operations Ernie Grunfeld, who sat in on

every practice, is the father of Barnes' for
mer teammate Dan Grunfeld.
"There's been a lot of drill work so we
haven't had that much scrimmaging, but
he's very explosive, very athletic, a very
good outside shooter, he's a good defend
er and I think he's been very competi
tive," Grunfeld said.
"Ernie's seen me throughout the sea
son and knows what I'm capable of,"

Barnes said. "I'm having fun. I don't
know what will happen because it's some
thing I can't control, but I'm giving it my
best shot and hopefully things will pan out
well."
After a couple days of mini-camp,
Barnes talked about his first taste of what
it's like to be a part of an NBA team: "Prac
tices are a lot different. They're shorter
and more intense. As a veteran at Stan
ford, coaches would pull you aside during
some practices if they knew you played a
lot of minutes the night before. Here, I'm
just thrown into the water and it's sink or
swim."
Barnes' work was cut out for him from
the start in D.C., where one of the most
important offseason goals for an organi
zation that has become accustomed to los
ing-after naming a new head coach,
Eddie Jordan — was finding a steady
point guard.
After drafting Georgia's Jarvis Hayes
with the 11th pick overall in an effort to
satisfy their scoring needs, the Wizards se
lected Maryland's Steve Blake in the sec
ond round as their possible point guard of
the future. For more immediate returns at
the position, the Wizards are reportedly
pursuing free agents Speedy Claxton and
Gilbert Arenas.
While things did not pan out well for
Barnes in Washington, he has some valu
able professional experience under his
belt. The odds are stacked against any un
drafted free agent but Barnes' ability to
score on the perimeter and by slashing to
the hoop, coupled with his improvement
at the point guard position, could make
him an attractive target for any number of
teams looking to fill a void at the point as
a result of injury during the season.

the position, the Wizards are reportedly
pursuing free agents Speedy Claxton and
Gilbert Arenas.
While things did not pan out well for
Barnes in Washington, he has some valu
able professional experience under his
belt. The odds are stacked against any un
drafted free agent but Barnes' ability to
score on the perimeter and by slashing to
the hoop, coupled with his improvement
at the point guard position, could make
him an attractive target for any number of
teams looking to fill a void at the point as
a result of injury during the season.

Former Cardinal guard Julius Barnes must look to NBA success with another team after he was
cut from the Washington Wizards' mini-camp last week.
Former Stanford guard Julius Barnes was cut
by the Washington Wizards Sunday, following
four days of mini-camp in preparation fora week
of summer league games in Boston. If the Wizards'
82-50 loss to Atlanta in their summer league open
er is a sign of things to come, they might think
twice about dumping the undrafted free agent
who was one of the most athletic players to ever
don a Cardinal basketball uniform.
Following Stanford's 85-74 loss to UConn in the
second round of the NCAA tournament, Barnes,
who poured in a team-high 23 points in the defeat,
had little time to reflect on his senior season — in
which he led the Cardinal in scoring with 16 points
per game and earned first team All Pac-10 honors.
More importantly, Barnes helped Stanford to 24
wins, a victory over then-No. 1 Arizona in Tucson
and ultimately another trip to the NCAA tourna
ment in a season many analysts originally forecast
ed as culminating in an NIT bid.
It was a rewarding senior season for sure. After
starting point guard Chris Hernandez went down
with an injury early in the season, Barnes was
called on to orchestrate the Cardinal offense at
times and performed admirably, averaging a
team-best 3.8 assists per game. The situation gave
scouts a look at what the 6-1 Barnes can do
in his projected NBA position.
"The knock on me has been that I'm a
scorer in a point guard's body," Barnes
said.
While his Stanford teammates could
reflect on their accomplishments and
ponder the necessary preparation for the
next season, the loss to the Huskies
marked the beginning of next step in
Barnes' quest to play in the NBA.
"It began on the flight home from
Spokane," Barnes said. "The mindset was,
'things are going'to get harder now.'"
Barnes got a taste of just how much
harder it would get, as he worked out for
about 10 teams before June's NBA Draft,
including the Blazers, Raptors, Nuggets,
Warriors, Clippers and Suns
According to Barnes, he received posi
tive feedback from officials with several
teams, but on draft night, of the 58 college
and high school players' names called,
Barnes' was not one of them.
"It would've been good to be drafted
but it doesn't always work out," said
Barnes, who added he was surprised for
mer college standouts Hollis Price and
Jason Gardner, among others, also
weren't drafted.
Following the draft, Barnes agreed to
attend mini-camp with the Wizards, a
team he did not work out for previously.
"The phone wasn't ringing off the
hook, but I'm fortunate enough to have
an agent who found me an opportunity,"
Barnes said during mini-camp.

And so Barnes made his way to Wash
ington, where most of the faces in practice
were new to him — a group of rookies,
young players and undrafted free agents.
There were some familiar faces, too.
Former Cal standout Joe Shipp, who
also failed to make the final cut, roomed
with Barnes during mini-camp.
New Wizards President of Basketball
Operations Ernie Grunfeld, who sat in on

every practice, is the father of Barnes' for
mer teammate Dan Grunfeld.
"There's been a lot of drill work so we
haven't had that much scrimmaging, but
he's very explosive, very athletic, a very
good outside shooter, he's a good defend
er and I think he's been very competi
tive," Grunfeld said.
"Ernie's seen me throughout the sea
son and knows what I'm capable of,"

Barnes said. "I'm having fun. I don't
know what will happen because it's some
thing I can't control, but I'm giving it my
best shot and hopefully things will pan out
well."
After a couple days of mini-camp,
Barnes talked about his first taste of what
it's like to be a part of an NBA team: "Prac
tices are a lot different. They're shorter
and more intense. As a veteran at Stan
ford, coaches would pull you aside during
some practices if they knew you played a
lot of minutes the night before. Here, I'm
just thrown into the water and it's sink or
swim."
Barnes' work was cut out for him from
the start in D.C., where one of the most
important offseason goals for an organi
zation that has become accustomed to los
ing-after naming a new head coach,
Eddie Jordan — was finding a steady
point guard.
After drafting Georgia's Jarvis Hayes
with the 11th pick overall in an effort to
satisfy their scoring needs, the Wizards se
lected Maryland's Steve Blake in the sec
ond round as their possible point guard of
the future. For more immediate returns at
the position, the Wizards are reportedly
pursuing free agents Speedy Claxton and
Gilbert Arenas.
While things did not pan out well for
Barnes in Washington, he has some valu
able professional experience under his
belt. The odds are stacked against any un
drafted free agent but Barnes' ability to
score on the perimeter and by slashing to
the hoop, coupled with his improvement
at the point guard position, could make
him an attractive target for any number of
