# The 						Kobe Bryant fiasco
## Athlete obsession 
### JESS PETERS STAFF COLUMNIST 
I sat down today to go over my thoughts on
the Kobe Bryant scandal, and realized that I
truthfully didn't know what to think about it.
So I turned to my 16-year-old brother and
asked him what he thought I should talk about
in my column about Kobe.
His reply, "Write about how you're a loser."
Really, my brother loves me.
He continued, "Or write about that place in
Las Vegas where they use naked women as
paintball targets. You know that's gotta hurt."
As my brother laughed and went back to
watching Sports Center, it occurred to me that
despite the randomness and slight dysfunction
in his comments, he had an important point,
which is simply that there are other things in
the world to talk about besides the Kobe case.
Of course, you'd never know that from
watching ESPN, which has become Kobe TV:
all-Kobe, all the time, and if-you-don't-like-it
turn-to-a-channel-not-covering-the-story
(which I think leaves you with the Cartoon
Network).
Which brings me to my most prominent
thought on the Kobe ordeal: Why should we
pay any attention to it?
Don't get me wrong, I understand that the
next several months will be try
ing and life-altering for the
Bryant family, and the family
of his alleged victim.
But why should we, the
American public, obsess over it
to this gross extent?
Because he's a hero, they
say. Because he's an icon. Be
cause according to one poll,
he's third on teens' lists of top
role models, right behind par
ents and teachers.
As I write this, I am shaking
my head, thinking it a horrible
shame that so many people
have it all wrong.
Kobe Bryant is an admirable
figure on the court. His basket
ball skills should be respected,
celebrated and even mimicked.
But anyone who pegs
Bryant as a hero has made the
unfortunate mistake of confus
ing the game with the man.
Which is not to say that
Bryant is a terrible person, but
let's face it, he's no saint. He's

human, and despite the image
that he projects to this world,
he is far from perfect, and the
past couple of weeks prove
that.
But how many times are we
going to have to hear stories
like the Kobe case before we
realize that we cannot contin
ue to idolize and worship pro
fessional athletes?
Due to the time commit
ment, travel requirements, and
wealth that go along with pro
fessional sports, athletes have
shown us time and time again
that they struggle in their per
sonal lives. Dr. Steven Ortiz
even goes so far as to charac
terize the life of an athlete as a
"culture of adultery" in which
infidelity and other moral fail
ings are imminent.
Glorify the skills, and not
the man.
It's a lesson we should have
learned long ago.
We should have learned it
from beloved Hall of Famer
Kirby Puckett (a man with an
image as impeccable as
Kobe's), who last year was
faced with a sexual assault

charge. Puckett was also ac
cused of infidelity and spousal
abuse, including an incident in
which he allegedly held a
cocked gun to his then-wife's
head while she held one of
their two children.
We should have learned it
from New Jersey Nets star
Jason Kidd, when he was ar
rested in 2001 for abusing his
wife, the mother of his 2-year
old son.
We should have learned it
from former Green Bay Pack
ers tight end Mark Chmura,
the married father of two sons,
when he was charged with sex
ual assault on a 17-year-old girl
at a neighbor's post-prom
party. He was also charged
with contributing to the delin
quency of a minor after spend
ing the evening drinking with
the party-goers.
We should have learned it
from NBA players Julius Erv
ing, Larry Bird, and the noto
rious Shawn Kemp, all of
whom have had extramarital
affairs that resulted in the birth
of illegitimate children.
We should have learned it

from Denver Broncos tight
end Dwayne Carswell, who has
been arrested three times on
assault charges, including a
skirmish where he allegedly
struck his girlfriend and
pushed her out of a car.
We should have learned it
from heavyweight boxer Mike
Tyson, who is widely regard
ed as the devil's spawn be
cause of his rape conviction
and constant accusations of
adultery, spousal abuse and
sexual assault.
We even should have
learned it from non-athlete
sports figures, like then-en
gaged announcer Marv Albert,
who plead guilty to sexual as
sault charges filed by one of his
mistresses in 1997, or married
Alabama football coach Mike
Price, whose night in a topless
bar earlier this year cost him
hundreds as well as his job.
The Kobe Bryant case is the
latest in a long string of ex
haustingly similar athlete in
discretions that hopefully, this
time, will finally teach us once
and for all that we can't make
heroes out of our athletes any

more.
We should be looking for
our heroes in our own families
and friends, in people with
whom we've actually spoken.
Because let's be honest, at
this rate, we're going to run
out of morally upright athletes
to worship. We'll have Cal Rip
ken Jr., David Robinson and
Tim Duncan . . . and the first
two don't even play anymore.
Instead, we should devote
our admiration to the perfor
mances that the pros give us
and not their personal lives:
to the cross-over of Allen
Iverson and not his weapons
charge or to Kobe's jump shot
and not his possible sexual as
sault offense.
When we can finally forget
our fixation with the personal
lives of our athletes, we will be
doing our part to return some
sense of sacredness to the
games that we love.
So ignoring the shameless
Kobe media frenzy, though
granted, will be quite a daunt
ing task.

in my column about Kobe.
His reply, "Write about how you're a loser."
Really, my brother loves me.
He continued, "Or write about that place in
Las Vegas where they use naked women as
paintball targets. You know that's gotta hurt."
As my brother laughed and went back to
watching Sports Center, it occurred to me that
despite the randomness and slight dysfunction
in his comments, he had an important point,
which is simply that there are other things in
the world to talk about besides the Kobe case.
Of course, you'd never know that from
watching ESPN, which has become Kobe TV:
all-Kobe, all the time, and if-you-don't-like-it
turn-to-a-channel-not-covering-the-story
(which I think leaves you with the Cartoon
Network).
Which brings me to my most prominent
thought on the Kobe ordeal: Why should we
pay any attention to it?
Don't get me wrong, I understand that the
next several months will be try
ing and life-altering for the
Bryant family, and the family
of his alleged victim.
But why should we, the
American public, obsess over it
to this gross extent?
Because he's a hero, they
say. Because he's an icon. Be
cause according to one poll,
he's third on teens' lists of top
role models, right behind par
ents and teachers.
As I write this, I am shaking
my head, thinking it a horrible
shame that so many people
have it all wrong.
Kobe Bryant is an admirable
figure on the court. His basket
ball skills should be respected,
celebrated and even mimicked.
But anyone who pegs
Bryant as a hero has made the
unfortunate mistake of confus
ing the game with the man.
Which is not to say that
Bryant is a terrible person, but
let's face it, he's no saint. He's

human, and despite the image
that he projects to this world,
he is far from perfect, and the
past couple of weeks prove
that.
But how many times are we
going to have to hear stories
like the Kobe case before we
realize that we cannot contin
ue to idolize and worship pro
fessional athletes?
Due to the time commit
ment, travel requirements, and
wealth that go along with pro
fessional sports, athletes have
shown us time and time again
that they struggle in their per
sonal lives. Dr. Steven Ortiz
even goes so far as to charac
terize the life of an athlete as a
"culture of adultery" in which
infidelity and other moral fail
ings are imminent.
Glorify the skills, and not
the man.
It's a lesson we should have
learned long ago.
We should have learned it
from beloved Hall of Famer
Kirby Puckett (a man with an
image as impeccable as
Kobe's), who last year was
faced with a sexual assault

charge. Puckett was also ac
cused of infidelity and spousal
abuse, including an incident in
which he allegedly held a
cocked gun to his then-wife's
head while she held one of
their two children.
We should have learned it
from New Jersey Nets star
Jason Kidd, when he was ar
rested in 2001 for abusing his
wife, the mother of his 2-year
old son.
We should have learned it
from former Green Bay Pack
ers tight end Mark Chmura,
the married father of two sons,
when he was charged with sex
ual assault on a 17-year-old girl
at a neighbor's post-prom
party. He was also charged
with contributing to the delin
quency of a minor after spend
ing the evening drinking with
the party-goers.
We should have learned it
from NBA players Julius Erv
ing, Larry Bird, and the noto
rious Shawn Kemp, all of
whom have had extramarital
affairs that resulted in the birth
of illegitimate children.
We should have learned it

from Denver Broncos tight
end Dwayne Carswell, who has
been arrested three times on
assault charges, including a
skirmish where he allegedly
struck his girlfriend and
pushed her out of a car.
We should have learned it
from heavyweight boxer Mike
Tyson, who is widely regard
ed as the devil's spawn be
cause of his rape conviction
and constant accusations of
adultery, spousal abuse and
sexual assault.
We even should have
learned it from non-athlete
sports figures, like then-en
gaged announcer Marv Albert,
who plead guilty to sexual as
sault charges filed by one of his
mistresses in 1997, or married
Alabama football coach Mike
Price, whose night in a topless
bar earlier this year cost him
hundreds as well as his job.
The Kobe Bryant case is the
latest in a long string of ex
haustingly similar athlete in
discretions that hopefully, this
time, will finally teach us once
and for all that we can't make
heroes out of our athletes any

more.
We should be looking for
our heroes in our own families
and friends, in people with
whom we've actually spoken.
Because let's be honest, at
this rate, we're going to run
out of morally upright athletes
to worship. We'll have Cal Rip
ken Jr., David Robinson and
Tim Duncan . . . and the first
two don't even play anymore.
Instead, we should devote
our admiration to the perfor
mances that the pros give us
and not their personal lives:
to the cross-over of Allen
Iverson and not his weapons
charge or to Kobe's jump shot
and not his possible sexual as
sault offense.
When we can finally forget
our fixation with the personal
lives of our athletes, we will be
doing our part to return some
sense of sacredness to the
games that we love.
So ignoring the shameless
Kobe media frenzy, though
granted, will be quite a daunt
ing task.
Then again, there's always
the Cartoon Network.
I sat down today to go over my thoughts on

truthfully didn't know what to think about it.
