### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amber Liu now knows the feeling
of professional success.
In the first round of the Bank of
the West Classic at the Taube Family
Tennis Center on Tuesday, the Car
dinal freshman defeated Tara Sny
der for her first-ever main draw win.
The 19-year old Liu, ranked No.
354 in the world, is a wild card in the
32-player field.
At the start of the match Liu ap
peared visibly nervous, spraying
groundstrokes wide, long and into
the net.
Snyder, an eighth year veteran
on the tour and ranked No. 162,
quickly jumped on the opportuni
ties given to her and broke Liu twice
in building a 3-0 first set lead.
"I felt bi die first three games that I
wasn't moving as well as I normally dc
liu s;iid. "I was a littJe nervous... but it
all had to do with focus."
"Hie Stanford star showed signs
of her collegiate brilliance by win
ning the next two games, but she was
not able to recover from two breaks
and dropped the set, 2-6.
Liu seemed to dictate die pace of
play during the last few games of the
first set but could not hit winners or
finish games. In the second set, how

ever, she began placing her shots ex
tremely well and hitting comers.
Seemingly unfazed by the first set
score, Liu snatched a 3-0 lead with
sharp play and a bit of luck. Snyder,
ahead 40-30 on her serve, whiffed
on a fluttering overhead that should
have been crushed fora winner. In
stead, Liu took the game and the
momentum for the remainder of
the match.
Liu captured the second set, 6-3,
behind the strength and placement
of her serve, which reached 104
mph at times.
The third set was very similar to
the second, as Liu broke Synder
twice fora 3-0 lead. While Snyder
searched for ways to counter Liu's
dominance, the 19-year old was
steadily growing stronger, as her
groundstrokes were hit with much
more pace later in the contest. After
fighting off two game points and
Snyder's last charge at 4-1. Liu
cruised to a 2-6,6-3,6-2 win.
"Hie \ictory was impressive but not
surprising to die Stanford fans in atten
dance, who have not forgotten Liu's
run to the NCAA singles title in May.
Snyder was also quick to give Liu
the credit that she deserved after die
match.
