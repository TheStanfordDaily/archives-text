### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amber Liu now knows the feeling
of professional success.
In the first round of the Bank of
the West Classic at the Taube Family
Tennis Center on Tuesday, the Car
dinal freshman defeated Tara Sny
der for her first-ever main draw win.
The 19-year old Liu, ranked No.
354 in the world, is a wild card in the
32-player field.
At the start of the match Liu ap
peared visibly nervous, spraying
groundstrokes wide, long and into
the net.
Snyder, an eighth year veteran
on the tour and ranked No. 162,
quickly jumped on the opportuni
ties given to her and broke Liu twice
in building a 3-0 first set lead.
"I felt bi die first three games that I
wasn't moving as well as I normally dc

all had to do with focus."
"Hie Stanford star showed signs
of her collegiate brilliance by win
ning the next two games, but she was
not able to recover from two breaks
and dropped the set, 2-6.
Liu seemed to dictate die pace of
play during the last few games of the
first set but could not hit winners or
finish games. In the second set, how

ever, she began placing her shots ex
tremely well and hitting comers.
Seemingly unfazed by the first set
score, Liu snatched a 3-0 lead with
sharp play and a bit of luck. Snyder,
ahead 40-30 on her serve, whiffed
on a fluttering overhead that should
have been crushed fora winner. In
stead, Liu took the game and the
momentum for the remainder of
the match.
Liu captured the second set, 6-3,
behind the strength and placement
of her serve, which reached 104
mph at times.
The third set was very similar to
the second, as Liu broke Synder
twice fora 3-0 lead. While Snyder
searched for ways to counter Liu's
dominance, the 19-year old was
steadily growing stronger, as her
groundstrokes were hit with much
more pace later in the contest. After
fighting off two game points and
Snyder's last charge at 4-1. Liu
cruised to a 2-6,6-3,6-2 win.

Amber Liu won her first match in the main draw of a WTA tournament on Tues
day with a 2-6,6-3,6-2 victory over Tara Snyder in the first round of the Bank
of the West Classic. She now faces second-seeded Kim Clijsters of Belgium
today.
"I played Amber before and she's
really improved," Snyder said. "All
credit to her, she kept swinging
away. I think she got better as the
match went on."
A constant presence throughout
the match was the crowd, which en
couraged its Cardinal competitor
throughout the sunny afternoon.
liu acknowledged the crowd and fa
miliar surroundings as beneficial.
"I love playing out here, it's al
most like playing at my home," Liu
said. "It almost felt like a school
match again."
Liu, who is debating a return to
school versus a professional career, is
competing as an amateur, which
means she must forfeit all of her
earnings, except expenses, or lose
her college eligibility. Therefore, the

better Liu performs this summer
against professionals, the more
money it will cost her to stay at Stan
ford for another season. For exam
ple, she had to forgo more than half
of her earnings that she received for
reaching the finals of the USTA
Challenger tournament in Los Gatos
earlier this moth.
Tuesday's match may prove in
fluential in Liu's decision, as it was
her first win in the main draw of a
professional tournament If she can
win matches at the professional level,
there would be little reason for her to
return to a college, especially after
she dominated the NCAA singles
tournament two months ago.
Liu emphasizes that she is still in
the process of experiencing how her
talent fares in relation to the skills of
the players on the YVTA tour.
"It's still up in the air... I haven't
decided yet," Liu said. ".After this
summer I'll know my level."
Snyder has confidence that Liu can

make a name for herself on the tour.
"She's not physically a very big girl,
but from what I've seen, if she contin
ues to improve, fora player of her cal
iber the sky's the limit," Snyder said." I
think top-50 is definitely attainable."
Liu's road in the Bank of the West
now becomes much more formida
ble, as she is slated to meet Kim Cli
jsters, the No. 2 player in the world
behind Serena Williams, in the sec
ond round. Clijsters, a 20-year old
Australian, won the tournament in
2001, is currently one of the toughest
opponents in the world and boasts a
51-7 record in 2003.
No matter the outcome, though,
the match will serve as a valuable
means of comparison between Iju
and a top international player.
"I'll definitely be nervous, but I'm
at my home courts I have a lot of sup
porters," Liu said.
"It's going to be such a great ex
perience. It's every tennis girl's
dream."

match again."
Liu, who is debating a return to
school versus a professional career, is
competing as an amateur, which
means she must forfeit all of her
earnings, except expenses, or lose
her college eligibility. Therefore, the

better Liu performs this summer
against professionals, the more
money it will cost her to stay at Stan
ford for another season. For exam
ple, she had to forgo more than half
of her earnings that she received for
reaching the finals of the USTA
Challenger tournament in Los Gatos
earlier this moth.
Tuesday's match may prove in
fluential in Liu's decision, as it was
her first win in the main draw of a
professional tournament If she can
win matches at the professional level,
there would be little reason for her to
return to a college, especially after
she dominated the NCAA singles
tournament two months ago.
Liu emphasizes that she is still in
the process of experiencing how her
talent fares in relation to the skills of
the players on the YVTA tour.
"It's still up in the air... I haven't
decided yet," Liu said. ".After this
summer I'll know my level."
Snyder has confidence that Liu can

make a name for herself on the tour.
"She's not physically a very big girl,
but from what I've seen, if she contin
ues to improve, fora player of her cal
iber the sky's the limit," Snyder said." I
think top-50 is definitely attainable."
Liu's road in the Bank of the West
now becomes much more formida
ble, as she is slated to meet Kim Cli
jsters, the No. 2 player in the world
behind Serena Williams, in the sec
ond round. Clijsters, a 20-year old
Australian, won the tournament in
2001, is currently one of the toughest
opponents in the world and boasts a
51-7 record in 2003.
No matter the outcome, though,
the match will serve as a valuable
means of comparison between Iju
and a top international player.
"I'll definitely be nervous, but I'm
at my home courts I have a lot of sup
porters," Liu said.
"It's going to be such a great ex
perience. It's every tennis girl's
dream."
Amber Liu now knows the feeling
of professional success.
In the first round of the Bank of
the West Classic at the Taube Family
Tennis Center on Tuesday, the Car
dinal freshman defeated Tara Sny
der for her first-ever main draw win.
The 19-year old Liu, ranked No.
354 in the world, is a wild card in the
32-player field.
At the start of the match Liu ap
peared visibly nervous, spraying
groundstrokes wide, long and into
the net.
Snyder, an eighth year veteran
on the tour and ranked No. 162,
quickly jumped on the opportuni
ties given to her and broke Liu twice
in building a 3-0 first set lead.
"I felt bi die first three games that I
wasn't moving as well as I normally dc
liu s;iid. "I was a littJe nervous... but it
all had to do with focus."
"Hie Stanford star showed signs
of her collegiate brilliance by win
ning the next two games, but she was
not able to recover from two breaks
and dropped the set, 2-6.
Liu seemed to dictate die pace of
play during the last few games of the
first set but could not hit winners or
finish games. In the second set, how

ever, she began placing her shots ex
tremely well and hitting comers.
Seemingly unfazed by the first set
score, Liu snatched a 3-0 lead with
sharp play and a bit of luck. Snyder,
ahead 40-30 on her serve, whiffed
on a fluttering overhead that should
have been crushed fora winner. In
stead, Liu took the game and the
momentum for the remainder of
the match.
Liu captured the second set, 6-3,
behind the strength and placement
of her serve, which reached 104
mph at times.
The third set was very similar to
the second, as Liu broke Synder
twice fora 3-0 lead. While Snyder
searched for ways to counter Liu's
dominance, the 19-year old was
steadily growing stronger, as her
groundstrokes were hit with much
more pace later in the contest. After
fighting off two game points and
Snyder's last charge at 4-1. Liu
cruised to a 2-6,6-3,6-2 win.
"Hie \ictory was impressive but not
surprising to die Stanford fans in atten
dance, who have not forgotten Liu's
run to the NCAA singles title in May.
Snyder was also quick to give Liu
the credit that she deserved after die
match.
