# Don't rob this 'Cradle,' new Croft movie a flop
## 
### ALIA FABBRO MOORE 
Anyone who goes to see this
movie in hopes that it will be an
improvement over the 2001
" Tomb Raider" fiasco is in fora
big disappointment.
With its made-for-TV
graphics and nowhere-near
funny one liners, this sequel
will only entertain the most
diehard fans of the Tomb Raider
videogame —and that ispnly if
they want to see the game itself
blown up onto the big screen.
The quality of the special effects
is about the same.
This becomes apparent early
on, when Laura Croft (Angelina
Jolie) fights with a shark so un
believable it's hard to imagine
the movie was made this year.
And it only gets worse.
Croft's journey starts with an
earthquake that has supposed
ly unearthed an incalculable
treasure. "Raiders" from
around the world are racing to
find the long-buried trove.
Croft finds more than she has
bargained for when she stum
bles across an artifact that could
be the key to worldwide death
and destruction.
Of course, the artifact falls

follows the race between these
two, with the fate of humanity
hanging in the balance.

You would think that Director
Jan de Bont would have the
makings of an action flick — if
not exciting, at least watchable.
Apparently not. If de Bont
was hoping to use "Tomb

"Speed 2," she is mistaken to the
point of tragedy.
Perhaps the most blatant flaw
in this film is that when it is not
being overacted by cheesy ex

tras, it is dully under acted by its
main protagonists. We know
that Croft is supposed to be the
best of the best, but if she is
bored by the fights and plot
twists, how is an audience sup
posed to summon up enough
interest to compensate? Never
mind that the switches between
Jolie and the computer-generat
ed Croft are obviously — nei
ther of them is particularly en
tertaining. To be fair to the
Academy Award-winning ac

tress, you can't really blame her.
It seems she knew all along that
there was nothing in this movie
to catch anyone's attention.
One or two passably exciting
getaways and the whirlwind of
international sets might have lift

utterly boring range, but these
are completely eclipsed when we

letdown of the film — which is
saying quite a bit — the supposed
birthplace of humanity looks like
a bad disco. De Bont certainly
made a mistake when she allowed
the actors to stand still and speak
in such a place. As the audience is
by now thoroughly uninterested
in what they are saying, there is
nothing left to do but contem

plate how awful the "cradle"
looks. With any other movie,
viewers would have been at least
grossed out by the sight of a man
boiling in acid, but "Tomb
Raider" is the ultimate in desensi
tization — and even this isn't
enough to keep your eyes from
glazing over.
When the flop "Showgirls" hit
the big screen, it was criticized for
managing to make nudity boring.
"The Cradle of Life" can only be
given credit for doing the same
with action and adventure.
