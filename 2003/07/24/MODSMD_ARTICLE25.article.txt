# Black Eyed Peas left the funk out of album 'Elephunk'
## 
### DOUGLAS WILSON 
On its new release "Elephunk,"
Los Angeles hip-hop act Black
Eyed Peas is anything but subtle. In
the album's somewhat offensive
headliner track "Let's Get Retard
ed," the chorus aggressively re
peats, "Let's get retarded, let's get
retarded in here!" Unfortunately,
the group does not improve from
this jumping-off point.
Oddly enough, every indication
seemed to suggest that the trio's
third release would be a hit.
Though certainly not flawless,
Black Eyed Peas' previous two re
leases, "Behind the Front" (1998)
and "Bridging the Gap" (2000),
demonstrated the group's ability to
produce fun and fimky old-school
grooves, and showcased the
promising talent of members
Will.l .Am, Apl de Ap, and Taboo.
Sadly, this wasted potential
makes "Elephunk" all the more
disappointing. In an attempt to

broaden its sound, Black Eyed
Peas "explores" genres such as
rock, funk, samba, and reggae.
But in reality, the group overex
tends itself, awkwardly toying
with these musical styles on a mere
surface level.
The addition of singer Fergie is
perhaps the most noticeable thorn
in Black Eyed Peas' regrettable
overhaul. Fergie's vocals, which
add a decidedly R&B feel to the
album, are not technically bad in
and of themselves, but they clash
with the meager amount of flow the
trio is able to pull off. In short,
someone should have told Black
Eyed Peas to stick with its tried-and
true hip hop sensibilities.
But the sophomoric mishmash of
styles is hardly the greatest of the
album's overarching problems. Mu
sically, Elephunk fails in all regards.
For starters, the beats are unin
spired and simplistic, the samples
are overused and gimmicky. And
though the group members are at

times able to demonstrate their lyri
cal prowess and sense of rhythm, the
repetitive choruses and obnoxious
background commotion prevent
the album from ever cohesively har
nessing their strengths. This is espe
cially evident in opening track
"Hands Up," in which glimmers of
creative, lyrical grooves are quickly
obliterated by inane, out-of-place

choruses and sound bytes.
Worse yet, Elephunk is wholly
devoid of any meaningful content.
With few exceptions, nearly all of the
album's 13 tracks are merely tire
some mixes of over-the-top sexual
references and self-referential ban
ter. "Hey Mama" and "Latin Girls"
are two particularly absurd exam
ples, the former an extended booty
call and the latter a mind-numbing
ly stupid tribute to Black Eyed Peas'
apparent love for Latina girls.
Even "Where Is The Love," the
album's sole progressively-minded
track, crashes badly. Featuring
guest vocals by teen idol Justin
Timberlake and amusingly cheesy
lyrics and samples, the song is im
possible to take seriously.
Everything considered, Ele
phunk is essentially a pop album,
and a mediocre one at that. It's
one thing to try to reinvent your
self, but when you abandon musi
cal artistry for mainstream drivel,
all bets are off.
