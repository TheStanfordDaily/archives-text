BAD BOYS II
***☆
Mike Lawry (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett
(Martin Lawrence) have teamed up again to make
a huge Ecstasy bust led by a notorious and wealthy
drug dealer (Jordi Molla). Luckily, the comedic el
ements of the movie more than compensate for the
mediocre story.
Smith and Lawrence play off each other as only
they can. Although their fighting may seem a little
fake at times, overall they prove to be a dynamic
duo. Comedy is a necessity in this movie as it offsets
the plethora of shootings and generally bloody
scenes.
Although having Will Smith star in a movie isn't
enough to guarantee the quality of its music, the ef
forts of Nelly, P. Diddy, Murphy Lee, Jay Z and
Justin Timberlake combine to create a soundtrack
of note.
Although "Bad Boys II" is not for the faint of
heart, the setting, comedy and the awesome
soundtrack make it a movie event of the summer.

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
ickirC?
Disney has made one hell of a comeback after
the painful embarrassment of "The Country
Bears," bursting into the summer scene with "Pi
rates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black
Pearl," a perfect film for the season.
Since this is, at its core, a Disney flick, you will
have to sit through the blatant unfolding of a
hit-you-over-the-head moral and an ultimately
boring romantic side story. Having said that, sitting
through this fluff is almost painless, since the rest of
the movie is so much damn fun.
The curse of the Black Pearl, a ragged ship
that always brings fog into port with it, is con
nected to stolen Aztec gold and some very angry
ancient gods. Lead by Captain Barbossa (Geof-

trey Rush), the filthy pirates that crew the
doomed ship have a nasty habit of turning into
half-decomposed skeletons whenever moonlight
hits them.
"Pirates" runs a bit long, but in the end it doesn't
take away from the fun of the movie as a whole.
This is not necessarily a good movie, but when it
gets going, that doesn't really matter - you're hav
ing way too much tun to care.

TERMINATOR 3
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," the
man who could be the next governor of California
plays T-101, a more advanced version of the ter
minator that was reprogrammed to protect Sarah
Connor and son after he tried to assassinate her in
the original "Terminator."
The noticeable difference in this movie is that
it's directed by Jonathan Mostow ("U-571"). T1
and T2, under James Cameron, focused primarily
on character development and built the special ef
fects around the plot.
All that's lost in "Terminator 3," a shoot-'em up
action movie that features more explosions than
the latest "Charlie's Angels" trailer.
But that's not to say "Terminator 3" isn't an in
telligent, economical summer action movie.
If James Cameron had been at the helm, no
doubt he would have pushed the envelope fur
ther. Not with explosions, per say, as there are
only a number of ways you can blow a monster
truck to smithereens, but he would have worked
to develop the melodramatic force of the mate
rial — with suspense, with tension, with more at
stake, psychologically speaking.
"Terminator 3" works, but only on the surface
level: it's fun and free-spirited, yet you leave the
theater with the feeling as if the product is just a lit
tle too robotic.
