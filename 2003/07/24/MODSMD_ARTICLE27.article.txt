Console gamers, RPG fans, "Star
Wars" fanatics — your dreams
have come true. The newly released
"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Re
public" is everything you could ask
for in a traditional RPG — and
more. Total up the "Star Wars" li
cense, great graphics, glorious
game play, wonderful music and
superb sound effects, and you got a
sure-fire winner for the X-box
game of the year.
"Knights" takes place 4,000
years before the events of the "Star
Wars" movies — a smart course of
action fora game taking place in a
familiar world. The game reaps the
benefits of the license without ruin
ing any of the events of the "Star

Wars" canon. Many other "Star
Wars" games have been created in a
similar vein, but "Knights" succeeds
beautifully where the others have
failed.
The player actually feels like he is
in the "Star Wars" universe, partici
pating in events and interacting
with characters that are every bit as
colorful as the original Star Wars
movies (light years ahead of the sub
par material Lucas has released
lately). The presentation shines in
conjunction with the actual game
play, which deserves merit on its
own.
Batdes are engaging but not
overly complex. The battle system is
in pseudo-real-time, meaning that
although you have to input com
mands like a turn-based system, the
action takes place seamlessly, simi
lar to "Baldur's Gate," and to a less
er extent, "Ever Quest." However,

be warned that this game isn't ex
actly the easiest to master; there will
be times when you're glad you can
save wherever you want, especially
if you get run down by a group of
strong opponents.
Knights offers something for
every variety of "Star Wars" and
RPG fan. If you,re a big pen-and
paper RPG fan, check out the be
hind-the-scenes option that lets you
view the dice rolls that affect every
action made in the game. If you
enjoy having full control over your
character's abilities, enjoy the near
ly limitless variety you have in creat
ing a character. Or, if you.ve always
been interested in the dark side,
you can create a character that'll
end up being fully trained in the
ways of the Sith.
Joining the dark side is one of
