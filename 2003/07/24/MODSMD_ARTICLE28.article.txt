# Is it hot in here, or is it just Roxy?
## Get over it: summer's here! 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Let's get ready for some sum
mer lovin'.
My faithful readers, Ms. Sass
apologizes for not writing sooner.
But, in an effort to help you get
your summer — and yourself —
off right, she is now back and
readv to deal with such compli
cated topics as, "How to Date
Someone that Doesn't Go to Stan
ford."
But before we can go there, we
must come to terms with the issue
that arises in many Stanford rela
tionships — the question ofwhat
are-we-doing-this-summer, aka
the DTR ("Defining The Rela
tionship," to clarify for readers
unfamiliar with Sass-y lingo) dis
cussion. Note that Ms. Sass is writ
ing this especially for you readers
whf> underwent The Spring
Quarter Relationship.
Let's set the stage: You two
met at Exotic Erotic — the Police
Department's videotape docu
ments your amazing movie-quali
ty first kiss — where he was
wowed by your coconut shells
and you couldn't wait to brushup
against his red cup and dental
floss.
But there wasn't enough of a
foundation to stay exclusive over
the summer; or so you both de
cided over dinner at CPK where
no one could make a scene.
Yet you each scored that sweet
single on the lower Row at in
house draw that fits a queen-size
futon and were already imagin
ing the reunion hook-up in Sep
tember. Now what?
Let's first look into our arche
typal female reader's psyche. It's
now July and you have already
made a number of mistakes. Call
ing his cell phone and hanging up
when it goes to voicemail is a com
mon problem (is he really study
ing for the MCATs or eating din
ner with that ex-girlfriend that he
is on mysteriously good terms
with?). But the worst thing you
could have done was send him
The Email.

The Email — because The
Conversation does not allow
enough time for him to read your
mind and provide the exact reac
tion you want but The Letter
could get lost in another bout of
Stanford USPS mail fraud — was
where you poured your heart out
and laid your cards down. You
want monogamy, you want to
visit him (and have already pur
chased non-refundable tickets to
do so), and you are falling for
him. You very cleverly avoided
saying "falling in love" because
you know that he would be scared
off by the L-bomb.
The Email was sent into cyber
space three weeks ago . . . and
still no answer.
You now spend your days
looking at your cell phone every
five minutes during waking
hours and turning the ringer vol
ume up to maximum while you
sleep. You learned the nuances of
Pine and leave your inbox open
all day waiting fora "You have
new mail" message.
You are currently consider
ing creating an Evite fora sum
mer housewarming in your
Gavilan double just to see if he
views it.
And what is our male reader
thinking? You didn't want to
waste your summer (your ex-girl
friend with the tongue piercing
said she wanted to "start hanging
out again" once you arrived
home), so you started weaning
yourself off of our heroine men
tally and emotionally (but defi
nitely not physically) around the
middle of May.
But thinking about her still
gnaws at your heart a little —
after all, she ate steak tartar,
drank like a fish and could call a
balk to boot.
You called her the day after
you got home, ending the conver
sation with "talk to you later" to
avoid any weekly phone call
obligations. After a night out with
your high school buddies, you de
cide that "if it's meant to be, it'll
work out" and engage in aver
sion-therapy drinking where you
do a body shot with the cute fe
male bartender every time you
think about the girl you left be
hind. You wake up with a horri
ble hangover and wonder if she's
already hooking up with some
one else — she mentioned that
her hot Psych TA was doing re
search in the lab next door to hers
this summer.
Your first attempt to buy a girl
a drink falls unbelievably flat. As
your friends laugh at you, you
deal with the feeling of rejection
by telling them about this great
girl you have waiting for you at
Stanford — the period of roman
ticization has begun.
If you pretend to have not ex
perienced these scenarios, then
Ms. Sass believes you are the infa
mous German neutral gender
form or you live in Denial (which

is not a river in Egypt). But, you
ask Ms. Sass, does this mean the
summer destined to be a boring
dry spell with a couple of unsatis
fying hookups (much like fresh
man year)?
Dear reader, fear not. To her,
he has not traded you in fora girl
named Crystal Chandelier who is
only working as an exotic dancer
to put herself through an Ivy
League law school; leave him a
message when you call or else the
10 missed calls with only one new
number on his cell phone will
have him heading to file a re
straining order.
To him, don't assume that
staying in touch means you're
stringing her along; she is, de
spite what you think, at the Nut
house beating guys cuter than
you at pool as you read this. At
any rate, Ms. Sass has this simple
piece of advice: unless you could
work as a professional contor
tionist, don't waste your summer
licking your wounds.
Stay tuned next week for how
to find the perfect summer fling.

said she wanted to "start hanging
out again" once you arrived
home), so you started weaning
yourself off of our heroine men
tally and emotionally (but defi
nitely not physically) around the
middle of May.
But thinking about her still
gnaws at your heart a little —
after all, she ate steak tartar,
drank like a fish and could call a
balk to boot.
You called her the day after
you got home, ending the conver
sation with "talk to you later" to
avoid any weekly phone call
obligations. After a night out with
your high school buddies, you de
cide that "if it's meant to be, it'll
work out" and engage in aver
sion-therapy drinking where you
do a body shot with the cute fe
male bartender every time you
think about the girl you left be
hind. You wake up with a horri
ble hangover and wonder if she's
already hooking up with some
one else — she mentioned that
her hot Psych TA was doing re
search in the lab next door to hers
this summer.
Your first attempt to buy a girl
a drink falls unbelievably flat. As
your friends laugh at you, you
deal with the feeling of rejection
by telling them about this great
girl you have waiting for you at
Stanford — the period of roman
ticization has begun.
If you pretend to have not ex
perienced these scenarios, then
Ms. Sass believes you are the infa
mous German neutral gender
form or you live in Denial (which

is not a river in Egypt). But, you
ask Ms. Sass, does this mean the
summer destined to be a boring
dry spell with a couple of unsatis
fying hookups (much like fresh
man year)?
Dear reader, fear not. To her,
he has not traded you in fora girl
named Crystal Chandelier who is
only working as an exotic dancer
to put herself through an Ivy
League law school; leave him a
message when you call or else the
10 missed calls with only one new
number on his cell phone will
have him heading to file a re
straining order.
To him, don't assume that
staying in touch means you're
stringing her along; she is, de
spite what you think, at the Nut
house beating guys cuter than
you at pool as you read this. At
any rate, Ms. Sass has this simple
piece of advice: unless you could
work as a professional contor
tionist, don't waste your summer
licking your wounds.
Stay tuned next week for how
to find the perfect summer fling.
Let's get ready for some sum
mer lovin'.
My faithful readers, Ms. Sass
apologizes for not writing sooner.
But, in an effort to help you get
your summer — and yourself —
off right, she is now back and
readv to deal with such compli
cated topics as, "How to Date
Someone that Doesn't Go to Stan
ford."
But before we can go there, we
must come to terms with the issue
that arises in many Stanford rela
tionships — the question ofwhat
are-we-doing-this-summer, aka
the DTR ("Defining The Rela
tionship," to clarify for readers
unfamiliar with Sass-y lingo) dis
cussion. Note that Ms. Sass is writ
ing this especially for you readers
whf> underwent The Spring
Quarter Relationship.
Let's set the stage: You two
met at Exotic Erotic — the Police
Department's videotape docu
ments your amazing movie-quali
ty first kiss — where he was
wowed by your coconut shells
and you couldn't wait to brushup
against his red cup and dental
floss.
But there wasn't enough of a
foundation to stay exclusive over
the summer; or so you both de
cided over dinner at CPK where
no one could make a scene.
Yet you each scored that sweet
single on the lower Row at in
house draw that fits a queen-size
futon and were already imagin
ing the reunion hook-up in Sep
tember. Now what?
Let's first look into our arche
typal female reader's psyche. It's
now July and you have already
made a number of mistakes. Call
ing his cell phone and hanging up
when it goes to voicemail is a com
mon problem (is he really study
ing for the MCATs or eating din
ner with that ex-girlfriend that he
is on mysteriously good terms
with?). But the worst thing you
could have done was send him
The Email.

The Email — because The
Conversation does not allow
enough time for him to read your
mind and provide the exact reac
tion you want but The Letter
could get lost in another bout of
Stanford USPS mail fraud — was
where you poured your heart out
and laid your cards down. You
want monogamy, you want to
visit him (and have already pur
chased non-refundable tickets to
do so), and you are falling for
him. You very cleverly avoided
saying "falling in love" because
you know that he would be scared
off by the L-bomb.
The Email was sent into cyber
space three weeks ago . . . and
still no answer.
You now spend your days
looking at your cell phone every
five minutes during waking
hours and turning the ringer vol
ume up to maximum while you
sleep. You learned the nuances of
Pine and leave your inbox open
all day waiting fora "You have
new mail" message.
You are currently consider
ing creating an Evite fora sum
mer housewarming in your
Gavilan double just to see if he
views it.
And what is our male reader
thinking? You didn't want to
waste your summer (your ex-girl
friend with the tongue piercing
said she wanted to "start hanging
out again" once you arrived
home), so you started weaning
yourself off of our heroine men
tally and emotionally (but defi
