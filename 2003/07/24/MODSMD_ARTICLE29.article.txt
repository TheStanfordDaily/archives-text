# Giving '8 Mile' a run for its money
## Poetry slam artist spices up the Nitery 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
Little did I know, as I walked into
the Nitery Theatre fifteen minutes
earlv fora poetry slam, that I was
just a few seconds t<x> late to find a
seat. The show, featuring Stanford
artist-in-residence Aya de Leon, was

was a member of the San Francisco
team for the National Poetry Slam.
She tours with the hip hop theatre
group the All Stars, and has per
formed at Lincoln Center.
De Leon delivered a number of
poems that ranged from the hu

women's bodies in "Cellulite" to the
intensely confessional account of
her own vision of love, entided "Dif
