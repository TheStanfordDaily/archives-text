# Giving '8 Mile' a run for its money
## Poetry slam artist spices up the Nitery 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
Little did I know, as I walked into
the Nitery Theatre fifteen minutes
earlv fora poetry slam, that I was
just a few seconds t<x> late to find a
seat. The show, featuring Stanford
artist-in-residence Aya de Leon, was
at standing-room-only 20 minutes
before the show even started â€” 20
minutes into the show, the 80-per
son maximum capacity had dou
bled.
The audience was a rowdy mix
of everyone from Stanford under
grads to l<xal high school students
to middle-aged members of the
continuing studies program. The
opportunity for open mic sign-ups
was given from the get-go, and a

surprising number of audience
members participated.
Slam poetry is part of a spoken
word revolution that brings togeth
er the rhythms of hip hop with a
poet's lyricism and craft.
Poetry slams are usually compet
itive events in which each poet or
team of poets goes head to head and
is judged by the audience. This cre
ates an atmosphere that makes the
poetry feel alive and vibrant, and
makes for an intense show. While
this particular slam was not a com
petition, battling energy definitely
fueled the artists.
De Leon, an award-winning
African American/Puerto Rican
poet, has a long list of impressive
performance and poetry creden

tials, in addition to her place as a
teacher at Stanford. In 2000, she
won the Burning B<x)ks Award and
was a member of the San Francisco
team for the National Poetry Slam.
She tours with the hip hop theatre
group the All Stars, and has per
formed at Lincoln Center.
De Leon delivered a number of
poems that ranged from the hu
morous and uplifting look at
women's bodies in "Cellulite" to the
intensely confessional account of
her own vision of love, entided "Dif
ficult." Acting as an MC for the
event, de Leon was very instruction
al, explaining to the uninitiated in
the audience exacdy what they were
in store for at the slam.
Three other performers spoke
in turn with de Leon: Dahled, Geoff
Trenchard, and Nazelah Jamison.
.All three have competed on teams
for the National Poetry Slam, and
Jamison spent time touring with Le
Nubiens and Spearhead with
Michael Franti.
Dahled began the event with a
biting criticism of current national
and international politics, moving
from the importance of money in
society to the idea that the country
is run by "a couple a" crackers
named Bush and Dick. This was a
good start to the evening, and got
the audience properly riled up in
preparation for the somewhat con
troversial topics the poets encom
passed. Dahled continued showing
off his harsh wit with a battle style
rap in which he unabashedly pro
claimed, "damn I mean I don't
even battle no more man, I just
am."
Jamison, a self-proclaimed love
poet, delivered her pieces with skill
and intensity. Her tone changed
moment to moment, from whis
pery-sweet to shouting bitterly at
the top of her voice. Beginning with
a joyful and hopeful proclamation
of her own motivation and worth in
the face of love, she then moved to
a more cynical piece entided "She
Never Really Loved You." A mixed
metaphor brings this poem to a
close, intermingling a drug addic

tion with a relationship to create ug
liness, and realize that in a realist vi
sion of people, "forever ends
abruptly when it ain't really love."'
Trenchard was by far the more
humorous writer of the four, be
ginning his first piece with an in
sider's look at being a waiter on the
night shift at Denny's. But with this
ironic attitude and cynically hu
morous commentary on people
and their downfall, there is a whol
ly serious message that pervades
his work. At one point, his protag
onist recognizes a girl from his
high school looking for lost sero
tonin and innocence in the end of
her cigarette while standing out
side Denny's. Trechard delivers
his poetry as if he is having a great
ly exaggerated conversation with
the audience. His face is expressive
as he speaks, and he gives a very
candid picture of his own self
image. Trenchard has found the
prose in poetry.
After the open mic session,
which lasted a little under an hour,
the four artists answered a few au
dience questions. The main focus,
all of them agreed, was to get the
word out and spread the power of
spoken poetry. "Start demanding
spoken word," encouraged
Dahled, "Start asking, and educate
professors if you have to, about the
next important wave in performace
and poetry."
Terry Shtob, Associate Dean of
Continuing Studies, hosted the
event, introducing de Leon and the
other performers with inspiring
words about the Continuing Stud
ies program.
