Laurel Canyon
Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko's "Laurel Canyon" (2002) is a
relaxed, intimate character study of East Coast straight-arrows who
suddenly find themselves living with a pack of Los Angeles hedo
nists. Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are med
school grads, and they've come to Laurel Canyon (a luxurious
neighborhood in LA) so that Sam can take a position at a presti
gious psychiatric institute while Alex works on her doctoral disserta
tion.
They hoped to stay alone in one of the houses owned by Jane
(Frances McDormand), Sam's mother and a successful record pro
ducer, but due to a host of complications find that they must cohab
it with Jane and the folk/rock band whose album she's producing.
While Sam, who's more than a little embarrassed by his mother, be
comes increasingly uptight and bitter, Alex finds herself drawn to
the group's freedom and fun.
In her commentary, Cholodenko emphasizes her debt to '70s
New Hollywood directors, particularly Mike Nichols ("The Grad
uate") and Robert Altman ("Nashville"), and the influence defi
nitely shows. Even though Cholodenko can't match the social or
cinematic ambitions of her heroes, she's still created a film popu
lated by characters far more believable and complexly likeable
than those found in typical Hollywood fare, and she tells their story
with commendable dedication to nuance and ambiguity. Plus,
through the film's many gorgeous images, including both
panoramic views and telling details of the neighborhood, Cholo
denko paints a wonderful picture of Laurel Canyon as both a state
of mind and a real place.
What "Laurel Canyon" really has going for it, however, is Jane.
She is brilliandy played by McDormand as an obvious hippie
holdover, but one who is smart and sexy nonetheless. Jane hasn't
been the best of mothers and she has more than a few regrets, but
for the most part she seems to live solely in the moment, an attitude
which can be both joyful and dangerously irresponsible.
The DVD comes with trailers, a making-of featurette (with heavy
input from Cholodenko) and a director's commentary. Cholodenko
is likeable enough, but judging from her on-screen banality, her
work speaks far more eloquently for her than she does.
