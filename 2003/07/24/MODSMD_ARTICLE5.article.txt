## GCEP considers options for new areas of research 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After focusing on four broad research
areas — hydrogen production and utiliza
tion, advanced combustion, the geological
sequestration of carbon dioxide and an in
tegrated assessment of technology
options — in the eight months since the 10-
year, $225 million Global Climate and En
ergy Project was announced in November,
GCEP collaborators are planning to consid
er three new potential areas of investigation
in the upcoming academic year.
"During the next year, we will be looking
at the areas of renewables, carbon capture
and storage, and advanced materials," said
GCEP Director Lynn Orr, professor of pe
troleum engineering.
At its creation, 11 broad topics were
identified as potential research areas for
GCEP, a program sponsored by ExxonMo
bil, General Electric, Schlumberger and
Toyota that is intended to unite industry
with academia to develop technologies that
reduce greenhouse gas emission associated
with energy use. GCEP researchers then

chose several of the broad areas to begin
work in.
The choice of research area must be ap
proved by an advisory committee com
prised of representatives from the sponsor
corporations — an arrangement that drew
questions from some inside Stanford, but
more from those in the outside academic
community, over the propriety of the
arrangement. GCEP coordinators have
maintained, however, that beyond approv
ing a broad research topic, the sponsors do
not have any control over the direction of
research and are expected to okay the top
ics that GCEP researchers feel are most
pressing.
The initial four research projects, slated
to run through mid-August and allocated
$3 million, according to Orr, represented a
range of topics of primary interest both to
some of'the sponsor corporations and to
GCEP coordinators.
Identifying technological opportunity and
economic viability
GCEP's mission emphasizes developing
"commercially viable" technologies to

achieve the end goal of increasing efficien
cy in energy use while decreasing danger
ous emissions.
Management Science and Engineering
Profs. Jim Sweeney and John Weyant are
spearheading an integrated assessment of
technology options, one of GCEP's four ini
tial projects, to help inform future choices
on where researchers should focus their en
ergy and resources with this consideration
in mind.
Or, as Weyant put it, "I'm to assess what
to do with the big bucks."
Weyant and Sweeney, in collaboration
with researchers from other universities
and institutions, have been conducting a
broad analysis of the energy sector to iden
tify where opportunities lie for technologi
cal research, what the associated costs

would be and how much time it may take to
make such new technologies marketable.*
"You look at a broad range of possible
future energy systems including considera
tion of possible rates of economic growth,
shifts in industry structure, future resource
costs and competing technologies to see
how likely it is that the technology in ques
tion will be competitive," Weyant said. "On
the assessment side, we have about 20 to 30
assessment teams that we are working with
from around the world — in the U.S., Eu
rope, developed Asia and developing coun
tries — and from all sectors — universities,
government laboratories and corporate re
search labs."
Weyant added that one important out-
