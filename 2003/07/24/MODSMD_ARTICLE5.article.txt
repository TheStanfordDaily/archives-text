## GCEP considers options for new areas of research 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After focusing on four broad research
areas — hydrogen production and utiliza
tion, advanced combustion, the geological
sequestration of carbon dioxide and an in
tegrated assessment of technology
options — in the eight months since the 10-
year, $225 million Global Climate and En
ergy Project was announced in November,
GCEP collaborators are planning to consid
er three new potential areas of investigation
in the upcoming academic year.
"During the next year, we will be looking
at the areas of renewables, carbon capture
and storage, and advanced materials," said
GCEP Director Lynn Orr, professor of pe
troleum engineering.
At its creation, 11 broad topics were
identified as potential research areas for
GCEP, a program sponsored by ExxonMo
bil, General Electric, Schlumberger and
Toyota that is intended to unite industry
with academia to develop technologies that
reduce greenhouse gas emission associated
with energy use. GCEP researchers then

chose several of the broad areas to begin
work in.
The choice of research area must be ap
proved by an advisory committee com
prised of representatives from the sponsor
corporations — an arrangement that drew
questions from some inside Stanford, but
more from those in the outside academic
community, over the propriety of the
arrangement. GCEP coordinators have
maintained, however, that beyond approv
ing a broad research topic, the sponsors do
not have any control over the direction of
research and are expected to okay the top
ics that GCEP researchers feel are most
pressing.
The initial four research projects, slated
to run through mid-August and allocated
$3 million, according to Orr, represented a
range of topics of primary interest both to
some of'the sponsor corporations and to
GCEP coordinators.
Identifying technological opportunity and
economic viability
GCEP's mission emphasizes developing
"commercially viable" technologies to

achieve the end goal of increasing efficien
cy in energy use while decreasing danger
ous emissions.
Management Science and Engineering
Profs. Jim Sweeney and John Weyant are
spearheading an integrated assessment of
technology options, one of GCEP's four ini
tial projects, to help inform future choices
on where researchers should focus their en
ergy and resources with this consideration
in mind.
Or, as Weyant put it, "I'm to assess what
to do with the big bucks."
Weyant and Sweeney, in collaboration
with researchers from other universities
and institutions, have been conducting a
broad analysis of the energy sector to iden
tify where opportunities lie for technologi
cal research, what the associated costs

would be and how much time it may take to
make such new technologies marketable.*
"You look at a broad range of possible
future energy systems including considera
tion of possible rates of economic growth,
shifts in industry structure, future resource
costs and competing technologies to see
how likely it is that the technology in ques
tion will be competitive," Weyant said. "On
the assessment side, we have about 20 to 30
assessment teams that we are working with
from around the world — in the U.S., Eu
rope, developed Asia and developing coun
tries — and from all sectors — universities,
government laboratories and corporate re
search labs."
Weyant added that one important out-

Project, which was initiated last year.
come of his and Sweeney's work
was to ensure that the projects
pursued under GCEP could real
istically be applied to everyday
use.
"In a way you could think of us
as putting the pressure on for
doing things that are not just sci
ence for science's sake," he said.
Responding to concerns that
GCEP work has not focused
enough on policy options, opt
ing instead to investigate how
the interplay of technology and
market forces, Weyant said that
it was not under the umbrella of
GCEP to be making statements
on policy. He added that fixat
ing on policy could even slow the
introduction of cleaner tech
nologies because of political in
ertia, while the development of
new clean and economically vi
able technologies could enable
policymakers to overcoming this
inertia.
"If you want to get large-scale
implementation, you need to get
input from the market," he said.
"Pollution taxes are the most ef
fective way to go, but they're hard
to do in the U.S. I think they may
be a lot easier if there were tech
nologies that had a little way to go,
not a long way to go.
"You could be a purist in
this — 'I'm not going to do
anything until President Bush im
poses a carbon tax' — I have two
reactions to that: better technolo
gy would make it easier and more
likely for him to do that, plus, I
don't see him doing that, so why
sit around and wait for him?"
Mitigating the impact of
fossil fuels
Two of the four initial research
topics — advanced combustion
and the geological sequestration
of carbon dioxide — dealt with
technology that would lessen the
negative effects of continuing to
use fossil fuels as a primary source
of energy.
Under the auspices of GCEP,
Deputy Director Chris Edwards,
associate professor of mechanical
engineering, has been building
on his work on increasing energy
in engine combustion, for exam
ple, to ultimately reduce the
amount of fuel needed to power
vehicles. *
"One of the things, if you speak
of combustion in a fossil fuel
world — and the important thing
to remember is right now 80 per
cent of our energy comes from
fossil fuels — is if you're going to
use those fuels, you really have
two choices," Edwards said. "One
is to separate out [the carbon].
Your other choice, if you really
can't do that, is to be much more
efficient and use less of the fuel in

the first place."
Edwards said that catalytic con
verters in vehicles transform
emissions of pollutants such as ni
trous oxide and carbon monoxide
into carbon dioxide to minimize
air pollution. However, while car
bon dioxide does not pose toxicity
problems, it is the primary green
house gas behind global warming
and"the problem is, we're making
it too quickly."
Edwards' work has challenged
previous assumptions about
optimal combustion conditions,
leading to the development of en
gine technologies that have fewer
emissions and waste less energy.
"People have long thought
for combustion to be efficient
you need to have high temper
atures, and that's true fora
particular class of engines, but
it's not true for all internal
combustion engines," he said.
"[ln] those systems, the high
entropy actually results in a loss
of efficiency."
Some proponents of renewable
energy have pressed for GCEP to
focus on developing sustainable
technologies instead of improving
technologies that use fossil fuels.
However, Edwards argued that
the extent of current reliance on
fossil fuels makes such an abrupt
shift unrealistic:
"It's going to be a long time be
fore we flush out fossil fuels, so
you have to work and try to do
something transitionally," he
said.
The debate over enabling fossil
fuel use becomes more con
tentious on the issue of carbon se
questration, a research topic of
Orr's and an area of particular in
terest to Schlumberger, a $25 mil
lioncontributor to GCEP.
"Wouldn't we rather have
Stanford's reputation be the place
to come to build green buildings,
to change energy policy?" said Gil
Masters, civil and environmental
professor emeritus. "Somebody
else is going to [take] that role, and
we are going to be the place to go
to learn how to bury carbon in the
ground."
Geological carbon sequestra
tion, or the capture and return of
carbon emissions into the earth, is
seen by some engineers as a way to
mitigate the damage of fossil fuel
usage until other energy sources
are integrated into the economy.
"It doesn't solve the whole
problem," said Orr, who noted
that there was potential in seques
tration as an immediate way to re
duce the amount of carbon diox
ide contributing to climate
change.
After announcing its involve
ment in GCEP, Schlumberger
Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Euan Baird said, "Schlum
berger is delighted to be part of
this major research project and
expects to contribute in both fi
nancial and technical terms. Our

primary technological focus is on
the hydrocarbon reservoir, and
we expect to leverage our own ex
tensive research and develop
ment resources to address carbon
sequestration issues while contin
uing to develop technology that
helps our customers provide en
ergy solutions in a carbon-con
strained world."
The role of hydrogen and GCEP's
road forward
The fourth research topic, hy
drogen production and utiliza
tion, has received the most atten
tion from GCEP researchers and
has proved to be a source of com
mon ground between some of
GCEP's fossil-fuel based spon
sors and dedicated proponents
of renewable and sustainable
technologies.
While hydrogen is not an en
ergy source, it is an energy carri
er that can be used in fuel cell
technology, for example, creat
ing only water, electricity and
heat — no pollutants or green
house gases. Nonetheless, sizable
obstacles remain to implement
ing hydrogen technologies on a
large scale — specifically high
costs and the issue of producing
hydrogen from sources other
than fossil fuels and hydrocar
bons to avoid generating carbon
dioxide emissions while gather
ing hydrogen.
Projects underway at Stanford
already include efforts by Assoc.
Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Alfred Spormann
and Chemical Engineering Prof.
Jim Swartz to produce hydrogen
from microorganisms as well as
basic research on hydrogen that
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Freidrich Prinz hopes help im
prove fuel cells.
In mid-April, Stanford hosted
the two-day conference "Hydro
gen Production, Storage, and Uti
lization: Technical Barriers and
Research Opportunities," which
drew over 200 attendees. This was
the first such conference orga
nized for GCEP.
According to Orr, hydrogen
production and use will be the
first areas where new projects will
be added in the coming year.
In an initiative separate from
GCEP, ExxonMobil and Toyota
teamed up with General Motors
in 1998 to develop technology
that would enable hydrogen in
gasoline to power fuel cells,

using hydrogen technology
within the context of the fossil
fuel infrastructure. ExxonMobil
is currently running ads on its
fuel cell technology online with
links to a site on energy technol
ogy it has developed. One ad
reads, "Fuel cell technology.
Originally used to power space
craft. Now being developed to
power cars. It's the journey
we're on." General Electric is
also already itself conducting
research on the potential im
provement and application of
fuel cells and other hydrogen
technologies.
The research currently being
conducted at Stanford would
make hydrogen use even cleaner
than those technologies being im
plemented by ExxonMobil and
Toyota, though, as it is working to
procure hydrogen not from gaso
line but sources like microorgan
isms, entirely eliminating carbon
dioxide emissions.
"The most intriguing [pro
ject] to me is biological produc
tion of hydrogen" Weyant said.
"If you could do that at large
scale, that would be a significant
achievement."
Researchers emphasize that,
despite the opportunity that lies in
hydrogen technologies, it is not an
immediate solution.
"We're not talking about a few
years — with this process we're
talking about decades, if not cen
turies," Prinz said. "This is a
process that will not happen over
night — there should be no illu
sion.
"We have a huge infrastruc
ture in traditional fossil fuels —
this is not going to go away over
night," he added. "People have
this naive belief it will happen
overnight. It won't — but that
doesn't mean we can't accelerate
our efforts."
Demonstrative of the consen
sus on the value of research in hy
drogen technologies between ide
ologically opposed camps in the
energy debate, Masters, an advo
cate of renewable technologies
who has objected to devoting
GCEP's resources to research in
processes like carbon sequestra
tion, welcomed GCEP's hydro
gen-related efforts.
"The whole concept of a hy
drogen economy is extremely
important," he said, "so I would
support that [research] 100
percent."
