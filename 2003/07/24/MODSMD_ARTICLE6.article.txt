# Professor and two students face possible fines or jail time for protest conduct
## Charges filed against three protesters 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Three Stanford community members — an as
sistant professor member and two
undergraduates — might face steep fines or jail
time for "obstructing movement on a public road
way." They number among the 52 arrestees being
charged by the Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's office for blocking or partially blocking some
roadway access routes to Lockheed Martin's Sun
nyvale facilities during an anti-war demonstration
on April 22.
"The majority of the protesters [arrested during
the demonstration] are charged with a violation of
Penal Code 647 c — obstructing movement on a
public roadway," said Sumerle Pfeffer, the deputy
district attorney prosecuting the cases.
The Stanford community members and others
facing charges, along with activist and civil rights
groups, are protesting the fines as interfering with
their first amendment rights to free assembly. The
protest, which was largely organized by Stanford
anti-war activists and attended by 300-500 protest
ers who were not arrested, was directed at the com
pany's alleged "close connections to the Bush ad
ministration" and their "war-profiteering," as well
as their "possession of weapons of mass destruc
tion."
Riva Enteen, program director of the San Fran
cisco Bay Area chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild, an organization that provides legal support
for demonstrators, said that the charges in these
cases differ from past cases against civil disobedi

ence protests.
"The new angle is the restitution, which is in
tended to chill the exercise of the first amendment
by putting a price tag on the right to protest," she
said. "Lockheed has yet to provide proof of any
extra security cost, and even if they did, that bill
should not be to the protesters. The protest was a
classic case of non-violent civil disobedience, con
ducted to prevent the greater harm of Lockheed
manufacturing and selling weapons of mass de
struction."
A Lockheed Martin press release stated the de
fense contractor's role in the cases.
"After the trial and conviction of the first of [the
April 22] defendants, Lockheed Martin was invited
to submit a 'victim's statement' — a standard step in
the criminal justice process in which the victim pro
vides a detailed summary of damages resulting
from illegal activity," Lockheed Martin's press re
lease stated. "In this case, Lockheed Martin in
curred costs totaling $15,361 related to providing
the appropriate level of security at its facility on that
day.
"Despite reports to the contrary, Lockheed Mar
tin does not have a lawsuit seeking restitution, nor
is the company trying to deprive anyone of the right
to free speech. Instead, Lockheed Martin is simply
being responsive to the legal system," the press re
lease continued.
Shahid Buttar, a graduate student at the Stan
ford Law School who was involved with the protest
and the legal aftermath, said the company's
