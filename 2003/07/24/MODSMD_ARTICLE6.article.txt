# Professor and two students face possible fines or jail time for protest conduct
## Charges filed against three protesters 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Three Stanford community members — an as
sistant professor member and two
undergraduates — might face steep fines or jail
time for "obstructing movement on a public road
way." They number among the 52 arrestees being
charged by the Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's office for blocking or partially blocking some
roadway access routes to Lockheed Martin's Sun
nyvale facilities during an anti-war demonstration
on April 22.
"The majority of the protesters [arrested during
the demonstration] are charged with a violation of
Penal Code 647 c — obstructing movement on a
public roadway," said Sumerle Pfeffer, the deputy
district attorney prosecuting the cases.
The Stanford community members and others
facing charges, along with activist and civil rights
groups, are protesting the fines as interfering with
their first amendment rights to free assembly. The
protest, which was largely organized by Stanford
anti-war activists and attended by 300-500 protest
ers who were not arrested, was directed at the com
pany's alleged "close connections to the Bush ad
ministration" and their "war-profiteering," as well
as their "possession of weapons of mass destruc
tion."
Riva Enteen, program director of the San Fran
cisco Bay Area chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild, an organization that provides legal support
for demonstrators, said that the charges in these
cases differ from past cases against civil disobedi

ence protests.
"The new angle is the restitution, which is in
tended to chill the exercise of the first amendment
by putting a price tag on the right to protest," she
said. "Lockheed has yet to provide proof of any
extra security cost, and even if they did, that bill
should not be to the protesters. The protest was a
classic case of non-violent civil disobedience, con
ducted to prevent the greater harm of Lockheed
manufacturing and selling weapons of mass de
struction."
A Lockheed Martin press release stated the de
fense contractor's role in the cases.
"After the trial and conviction of the first of [the
April 22] defendants, Lockheed Martin was invited
to submit a 'victim's statement' — a standard step in
the criminal justice process in which the victim pro
vides a detailed summary of damages resulting
from illegal activity," Lockheed Martin's press re
lease stated. "In this case, Lockheed Martin in
curred costs totaling $15,361 related to providing
the appropriate level of security at its facility on that
day.
"Despite reports to the contrary, Lockheed Mar
tin does not have a lawsuit seeking restitution, nor
is the company trying to deprive anyone of the right
to free speech. Instead, Lockheed Martin is simply
being responsive to the legal system," the press re
lease continued.
Shahid Buttar, a graduate student at the Stan
ford Law School who was involved with the protest
and the legal aftermath, said the company's

charges, as prosecuted by the
district attorney's office, were
unusual.
"This legal remedy is com
pletely unprecedented in this
sort of case. Restitution is usually
appropriate where a criminal de
fendant can help 'repair' the
damage caused by a criminal
act," he said. "However, here
there were in fact no damages to
repair. The extra security was
Lockheed's own decision, and an
unnecessary one that. I engaged
in an ongoing dialogue with local
law enforcement, culminating in
a face-to-face meeting with our

core organizers, and we'd thor
oughly and consistently commit
ted to non-violence."
While Lockheed Martin said
that the company itself has not
filed a lawsuit against the arrest
ed protesters, Buttar said that
the company had wanted repay
ment for both extra security and
legal fees.
"Lockheed actually took it one
step further, seeking restitution
not only for its security costs, but
even for its legal costs spent in a
(thankfully) futile effort to enjoin
the protest from ever happening
in the first place."
Rush Rehm, assistant profes
sor in the drama department,
who was arrested at the protest
and faces charges for roadway
obstruction, said that he will not

pay for what he claims is an un
just penalty.
"Charges were brought only
against those protesters who
'broke the law,' it is my view that
this sort of thing is a means by
which big, moneyed corporations
can use the law to assault first
amendment rights, and to make
protest more difficulty to under
take," he said.
"I will not pay Lockheed resti
tution for anything, which means
that if I'm found guilty and the
judge orders restitution, I will go
to jail," he added. "My sense is
that the rest of the defendants
feel similarly."
Charles Manor, of Lockheed
Martin's Strategic Communica
tions, defended the company's
role in the case.

"Lockheed Martin is a strong
advocate of the right to free
speech," he said. "We also would
expect our right to conduct busi
ness and allow our employees ac
cess to their jobs to be respected.
The individuals being charged by
Santa Clara County are 'not
being charged for free speech.'
They were charged for illegal ac
tivity.
"Further, the only [52 out of
several hundred] individuals ar
rested that day were those who
engaged in illegal activity,"
Manor added. "And Lockheed
Martin, as the victim in this case,
has responded to the Court's in
vitation to provide a victim's
statement and seek compensa
tion from those who engaged in
illegal activity — not those who

exercised their right to free
speech. In fact, free speech and
the behavior exhibited by some
individuals that day are com
pletely unrelated."
Buttar expanded upon the
reasons that drove the April 22
protest.
"The people cannot effective
ly rule when weapons makers
co-opt elected representatives
with pork, and that's precisely
how Lockheed Martin takes bil
lions of dollars from American
taxpayers," he said. "As a nation,
we spend an unnecessary for
tune on the military, at the same
time that schools can't hire
enough teachers. There's a rea
son for that disparity, and the
successful hijacking of the Amer
ican government is it."
