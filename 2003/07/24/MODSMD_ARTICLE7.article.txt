# Spare the Air Day held on Monday

. On Monday, Stanford's
Department of Environ
mental Health and Safety
helped promote a region
wide Spare the Air day to at
tempt to offset predicted
high levels of air pollution.
Collaborating with over
1,700 other local business
es, EH&S encouraged Stan
ford community members
to carpool, restrict gasoline
powered garden equip
ment and take other similar
precautions.
The Spare the Air pro
gram was established in
1991 to provide informa
tion to the public about
summer air pollution and
to help prevent exceeding
the federal one-hour ozone
standard, a measure of the
region's ground level
ozone. When meteorolo
gists predict that a given
day's air pollution will be
dangerously high, a Spare
the Air day is called to urge
the public to prevent un
healthy conditions by re
stricting pollution-emitting
activities.
Managed by the Bay
Area Air Quality Manage
ment District, which ex
tends across nine counties
that border San Francisco,
the Spare the Air program
uses television broadcasts,
newspapers, a hotline and
their Web site to promote
air pollution prevention.
The Spare the Air season
officially began on June 2
and will extend until mid-
October, as with high tem
peratures and little wind,
the threat of unhealthy
smog and ozone levels is
particularly pressing, dur
ing summer months.
In addition to health and
ecological concerns, non
compliance with federal air
pollution standards also
creates financial strain on
the Bay Area's public works
plans. Transportation
funding was frozen twice
last year due to legal chal
lenges to clean air plans,
threatening $3.3 billion in
projects.
