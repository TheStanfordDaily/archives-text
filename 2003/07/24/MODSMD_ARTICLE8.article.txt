# Band agrees to a new Univ. policy, alcohol banned
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band's yearlong
suspension from alcohol has come to an
end, University administrators and
LSJUMB leaders have collaborated to
create a new policy which bans alcohol at
Band events.
"At performances, the Band's pri
mary role is as a musical group which
represents the University," said rising
senior Moses Pounds, the band's pub
lic relations director. "With the
Band's musical quality in mind, we de
cided on a policy that members will
not drink before or during perfor
mances. This is a very realistic stan
dard because most sports arenas, in
cluding Stanford Stadium and Maples
Pavilion, are dry anyway."
When hosting social events, the Band
is must comply with the same rules that
govern all other student groups and
abide by the party planning rules and
guidelines set out by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs, Pounds said.
"The increased support from Vaden
and the OSA will help Band leadership
keep these social events safe," he added.
Acting Dean of Students Chris Grif
fith affirmed that student safety is the
University's top priority in adopting the
new policy.
"Our goal is to ensure that all Stan
ford Band events are conducted in a safe
and responsible manner," she said. "To
that end, the Dean of Students Office
and Band student leaders are working
together to strengthen the Band's lead
ership, management, and its relation
ship with the University."
The agreement reached by Band
leadership and University administra
tors also addresses issues other than alco

hoi prohibition.
"Over the course of a year of meetings
between Band leadership and University
administrators from various depart
ments, it became clear that a satisfactory
long-term arrangement must include
more than just an alcohol policy," Pounds
said. "The result of the committee's work
also included increased access for the
Band to University support, [including]
training and advice from the Office of Stu
dent Activities, the Athletic Department
and Vaden."
Several band members expressed
mixed feelings about the new policy.
"I feel that the new alcohol policy is a
great compromise between the Univer
sity's legal concerns and the respect de
manded by students as adults," said ris
ing sophomore Alex Rivas, who plays
the alto saxophone. "Yet, ultimately, I

feel that the administration seemed to
place legal issues, public relations, alum
ni contributions to the school and ulti
mately the school's reputation before
concern for the health and well being of
the students."
One anonymous band member said
the University had focused attention on
the Band while tightening other campus
wide alcohol policies because it was an
"easy target."
"I feel that there's an unfair assump
tion that we in the band are all a bunch of
raging alcoholics," Rivas said. "This is sim
ply not true. We can responsibly govern
ourselves and our drinking as a group."
After abstaining from alcohol for the
past year, band members agreed that the
new regulations should be easy to follow.
"When you drink in the band under
probation, the rest of the band gets down

on you because you put their freedoms at
risk," said another anonymous student.
One consequence of the new policy
that the administration might have over
looked, however, is the substitution of
other substances in the place of alcohol.
"When you prohibit open alcohol use
in the band, you create an underground
of drug use that is harder to see and less
obvious than drinking," said an anony
mous student.
Although some members are not satis
fied with the new policy, Band and Uni
versity leadership appear to be working
towards a common goal.
"It is my hope that this continued
partnership will not only ensure safe
and responsible Band events" Griffith
said. "But also will enhance the fun and
creativity the Band contributes to cam
pus life."
