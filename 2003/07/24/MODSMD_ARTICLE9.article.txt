# Bienenstock appointed vice provost

### BONITA SONG 
The Daily conducted a one-on-one interview with
Arthur Bienenstock, who was recently appointed
vice provost and dean of research and graduate pol
icy. Bienenstock discussed his past experiences and
what he hopes to accomplish in his new role at the
University.
The Daily: So can vou tell us a little bit about your
self?
Arthur Bienenstock: Oh, I don't know where to
start — I did undergraduate and master's degrees
in New York, and then I went to Harvard as a grad
uate student, worked in England fora year, went
back to Harvard as an assistant professor... I
came out here in 1966 on sabbatical, went back to
Harvard fora year, and then came back here per
manendy.
So that was 1967. In 1969, I got made chair of
CUAFA, the Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid, and among other things, it
was my committee that got rid of the restriction on
the founding grant that Mrs. Stanford put in, diat
limited the number of women at Stanford, as stu
dents, to 500. This was also the period after Martin
Luther King Jr. died, so we dealt with minority rela
tions — it was an interesting committee.
From there, I went on to be a fellow, and then fac
ulty affirmative action officer, and vice provost for
faculty affairs in 1972, I did that for five years. In
1978,1 went up to SLAC to direct the Stanford Syn
chrotronic Radiation Lab. I did that until 1997 —
just short of twenty [years] — went up to Washing
ton D.C. to be associate director of the White House
Office of science and technology policy for the last
three-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration,
and now I'm going to go back to Building 10, as vice
provost and dean.
TD: So how did you end up here?
AB: I think a number of factors. First, the experience
I have in Washington. I was associate director for the
[Office of Science and Technology Policy]. That gave
me an opportunity to really get involved in policy that
relates to research universities at a national level. I
think Stanford wants to influence those policies, or
play a role in developing those policies.
Second, I have directed two independent labora
tories — first the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, and now the Geballe Laboratory for Ad
vanced Materials. So I had experience in the inde
pendent laboratories, which are an important com
ponent in the dean of research's responsibilities
TD: Can you explain some of the responsibilities of
the dean, as well as precedents set by soon-departing
Dean Charles Kreuger?
AB: First of all, whenever you go into one of these po
sitions, three months after you go into it, it looks
much different from before you go in. And I'm very
much aware of that.
As seen from the outside and from my interactions
with [current] Dean Kreuger, the dean has a number
of responsibilities. One duty is to foster interdiscipli
nary and interdepartmental and interschool re
search. As part of that, the Dean oversees these inde
pendent laboratories — for example, the Geballe
Laboratory of Advanced Materials, which has faculty
from applied physics, materials science, mechanical
engineering — you get the picture.
So part of this responsibility is to help see that these
[interdisciplinary] programs thrive — because a lot
of the interesting research is that the intersection of
different departments and different schools.

Another function is to help increase the diversity
of our graduate student population — this is an
area which has interested me now for thirty years or
so — first on Undergraduate Admissions Commit
tee, then as faculty affirmative action officer. And
then in Washington it was a big issue for me, be
cause we looked down into the future of sciences
and technology and reached the conclusion that, if
we failed to increase the participation of women and
minorities in science and engineering, the nation
would probably lack people that are needed in sci
ence and technology.
A third function is to see that the University has ap
propriate policies towards its graduate students —
everything from health insurance, health care, on
U P
A fourth responsibility, which probably I will be
emphasizing more than [the current Dean] Charles is
to see that the nation has good policies towards re
search, immigration procedures, visas for students,
things of that nature, which I dealt with a fair bit dur
ing my three years in Washington.
Many of these areas are going through interest
ing policy, but obviously you can only do so
much — what do you hope to focus on, and expect
to accomplish.
In terms of interdepartmental relations, I want to
work with the major deans — to see whether, in col
laboration, we can make these interdisciplinary pro
grams more effective.
For example, let me explain the situation at this
laboratory. I, as director of this lab, reporting to the
dean of research — the office which I will be assum
ing in September — have control over the space in
this lab. Meanwhile, faculty appointments are appro
priately performed in departments, and yet we want
to build a coherent programs -and coherent pro
grams— in this laboratory from a broad array of de
partments.
What I hope to accomplish is more cooperation —
that is, to pursue the question: how can we keep the
departments very strong, and yet, build the interdis
cplinary component?
Should we, for example, include faculty from
other departments [in decisions] when a specific de
partment is going to make an appoinunent of a fac
ulty member who is likely to participate in this labo
ratory?
TD: Can you comment on some of your relevant ex
periences in Washington and as a professor
AB: When I was in Washington, of the duties in
Washington that are relevant to this position, one was
balancing funding. I spent a lot of time on that — I
spent a lot of time trying to convince legislators and
members of the executive branch that, even if you're
only interested in the health of the nation, you [still]
want to fund the physical sciences and engineering,
as well as [the National Institute of Health]. It's a cam
paign I continue on, even here.
[But] it was effective — President Clinton and
Vice President Gore both quickly realized the impor
tance of the physical sciences and engineering, once
they understood the story.
It took us longer to reach Congress, because Con
gress is more diffuse — but I think Congress has also
realized that it must keep the physical sciences and
engineering and the social sciences strong, in coordi
nation with the biomedical sciences.
Another thing I learned is that you can influence
Congress.
Another issue that I continue to work on is indirect
costs. Early in my career I chaired the Committee on
Research in the early 1990'5, when Congress came
and investigated Stanford on indirect cost issues. At
that time, I was concerned that the
indirect cost rates were going too
high.
TD: Can you explain "indirect
costs?"
AB: When I as a faculty member,
get a research grant, there are two
components to this. There is money
that I used direcdy from that grant,
to support research.
But the University has other
costs associated with that
research — things like heating the
buildings, depreciation of build
ings — we are constantly, as a Uni
versity, either building new build
ings, or rebuilding old buildings, to
meet new research needs. These
are costs that are vital to research,
and that you cannot attribute to a
specific project — these are indi
rect costs.
In the early 1990'5, Congress
and the OMB put a cap on ad
ministrative costs — the cost of
secretaries, and people who do
the accounting for the grant,
things like that. And it's starting
to hurt seriously. I think the Uni
versities, particularly American
Universities, have become too
thin on support staff. Our sup
port staff is becoming very heavi
ly burdened. I'd like to turn that

around. That won't be too popu
lar with faculty, and yet I think
the faculty see that need.
Every one of us faces a conilict
we'd like a maximum amount of
money to go to research, and yet we
want modern research buildings,
and support staff— we rely on our
administrative assistants— we de
pend on them, and we want all
these things, but we don't really
want to pay for them!
TD: How do you see yourself facili
tating the connection between the
University and nation?
AB: I know that my fellow officers
and colleagues in the Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy, are all
taking up tiiis problem too. I would
like to make sure that have systemat
ic input, and I would like to work with
other Universities to make sure that
the Office receives systematic input.
TD: How has research policy and
policy continuity changed between
the Bush and Clinton Administra
tions?
AB: Well, let's go back to the bal
ance issue. I think that every Ad
ministration that isn't very experi
enced on these matters comes in
and sees health research as most im
portant. Then, as they get more ex
perience, they realize that they have
to fund the physical sciences as well.
We saw that in the Clinton adminis
tration, and now we're seeing it in

the Bush administration — initial
ly, they were committed to doubling
the budget of the NIH — and now
they're extending that to the physi
cal sciences.
In this area, I don't see as
much a difference between Re
publican and Democrat, as be
tween more-experience and less
experience. For example, on
these issues of indirect costs, the
present head of Jack Marburger,
is a person who's been a universi
ty president, and I don't think
that he and I, and the Clinton and
Bush Administration, view things
that much differently.
Since the people in the OMB are
always fighting problems of budget
deficits — they want to keep admin
istrative costs to minimum. There's
always a tension — a proper ten
sion between offices, rather than a
Republican-Democrat split. Where
as in some areas there are big differ
ences between the Clinton adminis
tration and Bush administration,
on these levels I don't see a large dif
ference.
TD: So you see yourself as becom
ing a facilitator between the Univer
sity and nation?
AB: I think so. I think there were so
few voices speaking for the research
voices on the I think Stanford has to
go back into that. We've tended to
keep a low profile since the early
1990'5, but we've got to get back into
that.

1990'5, but we've got to get back into
that.
The Daily conducted a one-on-one interview with
Arthur Bienenstock, who was recently appointed
vice provost and dean of research and graduate pol
icy. Bienenstock discussed his past experiences and
what he hopes to accomplish in his new role at the
University.
The Daily: So can vou tell us a little bit about your
self?
Arthur Bienenstock: Oh, I don't know where to
start — I did undergraduate and master's degrees
in New York, and then I went to Harvard as a grad
uate student, worked in England fora year, went
back to Harvard as an assistant professor... I
came out here in 1966 on sabbatical, went back to
Harvard fora year, and then came back here per
manendy.
So that was 1967. In 1969, I got made chair of
CUAFA, the Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid, and among other things, it
was my committee that got rid of the restriction on
the founding grant that Mrs. Stanford put in, diat
limited the number of women at Stanford, as stu
dents, to 500. This was also the period after Martin
Luther King Jr. died, so we dealt with minority rela
tions — it was an interesting committee.
From there, I went on to be a fellow, and then fac
ulty affirmative action officer, and vice provost for
faculty affairs in 1972, I did that for five years. In
1978,1 went up to SLAC to direct the Stanford Syn
chrotronic Radiation Lab. I did that until 1997 —
just short of twenty [years] — went up to Washing
ton D.C. to be associate director of the White House
Office of science and technology policy for the last
three-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration,
and now I'm going to go back to Building 10, as vice
provost and dean.
TD: So how did you end up here?
AB: I think a number of factors. First, the experience
I have in Washington. I was associate director for the
[Office of Science and Technology Policy]. That gave
me an opportunity to really get involved in policy that
relates to research universities at a national level. I
think Stanford wants to influence those policies, or
play a role in developing those policies.
Second, I have directed two independent labora
tories — first the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, and now the Geballe Laboratory for Ad
vanced Materials. So I had experience in the inde
pendent laboratories, which are an important com
ponent in the dean of research's responsibilities
TD: Can you explain some of the responsibilities of
the dean, as well as precedents set by soon-departing
Dean Charles Kreuger?
AB: First of all, whenever you go into one of these po
sitions, three months after you go into it, it looks
much different from before you go in. And I'm very
much aware of that.
As seen from the outside and from my interactions
with [current] Dean Kreuger, the dean has a number
of responsibilities. One duty is to foster interdiscipli
nary and interdepartmental and interschool re
search. As part of that, the Dean oversees these inde
pendent laboratories — for example, the Geballe
Laboratory of Advanced Materials, which has faculty
from applied physics, materials science, mechanical
engineering — you get the picture.
So part of this responsibility is to help see that these
[interdisciplinary] programs thrive — because a lot
of the interesting research is that the intersection of
different departments and different schools.

Another function is to help increase the diversity
of our graduate student population — this is an
area which has interested me now for thirty years or
so — first on Undergraduate Admissions Commit
tee, then as faculty affirmative action officer. And
then in Washington it was a big issue for me, be
cause we looked down into the future of sciences
and technology and reached the conclusion that, if
we failed to increase the participation of women and
minorities in science and engineering, the nation
would probably lack people that are needed in sci
ence and technology.
A third function is to see that the University has ap
propriate policies towards its graduate students —
everything from health insurance, health care, on
U P
A fourth responsibility, which probably I will be
emphasizing more than [the current Dean] Charles is
to see that the nation has good policies towards re
search, immigration procedures, visas for students,
things of that nature, which I dealt with a fair bit dur
ing my three years in Washington.
Many of these areas are going through interest
ing policy, but obviously you can only do so
much — what do you hope to focus on, and expect
to accomplish.
In terms of interdepartmental relations, I want to
work with the major deans — to see whether, in col
laboration, we can make these interdisciplinary pro
grams more effective.
For example, let me explain the situation at this
laboratory. I, as director of this lab, reporting to the
dean of research — the office which I will be assum
ing in September — have control over the space in
this lab. Meanwhile, faculty appointments are appro
priately performed in departments, and yet we want
to build a coherent programs -and coherent pro
grams— in this laboratory from a broad array of de
partments.
What I hope to accomplish is more cooperation —
that is, to pursue the question: how can we keep the
departments very strong, and yet, build the interdis
cplinary component?
Should we, for example, include faculty from
other departments [in decisions] when a specific de
partment is going to make an appoinunent of a fac
ulty member who is likely to participate in this labo
ratory?
TD: Can you comment on some of your relevant ex
periences in Washington and as a professor
AB: When I was in Washington, of the duties in
Washington that are relevant to this position, one was
balancing funding. I spent a lot of time on that — I
spent a lot of time trying to convince legislators and
members of the executive branch that, even if you're
only interested in the health of the nation, you [still]
want to fund the physical sciences and engineering,
as well as [the National Institute of Health]. It's a cam
paign I continue on, even here.
[But] it was effective — President Clinton and
Vice President Gore both quickly realized the impor
tance of the physical sciences and engineering, once
they understood the story.
It took us longer to reach Congress, because Con
gress is more diffuse — but I think Congress has also
realized that it must keep the physical sciences and
engineering and the social sciences strong, in coordi
nation with the biomedical sciences.
Another thing I learned is that you can influence
Congress.
Another issue that I continue to work on is indirect
costs. Early in my career I chaired the Committee on
Research in the early 1990'5, when Congress came
and investigated Stanford on indirect cost issues. At
that time, I was concerned that the
indirect cost rates were going too
high.
TD: Can you explain "indirect
costs?"
AB: When I as a faculty member,
get a research grant, there are two
components to this. There is money
that I used direcdy from that grant,
to support research.
But the University has other
costs associated with that
research — things like heating the
buildings, depreciation of build
ings — we are constantly, as a Uni
versity, either building new build
ings, or rebuilding old buildings, to
meet new research needs. These
are costs that are vital to research,
and that you cannot attribute to a
specific project — these are indi
rect costs.
In the early 1990'5, Congress
and the OMB put a cap on ad
ministrative costs — the cost of
secretaries, and people who do
the accounting for the grant,
things like that. And it's starting
to hurt seriously. I think the Uni
versities, particularly American
Universities, have become too
thin on support staff. Our sup
port staff is becoming very heavi
ly burdened. I'd like to turn that

around. That won't be too popu
lar with faculty, and yet I think
the faculty see that need.
Every one of us faces a conilict
we'd like a maximum amount of
money to go to research, and yet we
want modern research buildings,
and support staff— we rely on our
administrative assistants— we de
pend on them, and we want all
these things, but we don't really
want to pay for them!
TD: How do you see yourself facili
tating the connection between the
University and nation?
AB: I know that my fellow officers
and colleagues in the Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy, are all
taking up tiiis problem too. I would
like to make sure that have systemat
ic input, and I would like to work with
other Universities to make sure that
the Office receives systematic input.
TD: How has research policy and
policy continuity changed between
the Bush and Clinton Administra
tions?
AB: Well, let's go back to the bal
ance issue. I think that every Ad
ministration that isn't very experi
enced on these matters comes in
and sees health research as most im
portant. Then, as they get more ex
perience, they realize that they have
to fund the physical sciences as well.
We saw that in the Clinton adminis
tration, and now we're seeing it in

the Bush administration — initial
ly, they were committed to doubling
the budget of the NIH — and now
they're extending that to the physi
cal sciences.
In this area, I don't see as
much a difference between Re
publican and Democrat, as be
tween more-experience and less
experience. For example, on
these issues of indirect costs, the
present head of Jack Marburger,
is a person who's been a universi
ty president, and I don't think
that he and I, and the Clinton and
Bush Administration, view things
that much differently.
Since the people in the OMB are
always fighting problems of budget
deficits — they want to keep admin
istrative costs to minimum. There's
always a tension — a proper ten
sion between offices, rather than a
Republican-Democrat split. Where
as in some areas there are big differ
ences between the Clinton adminis
tration and Bush administration,
on these levels I don't see a large dif
ference.
TD: So you see yourself as becom
ing a facilitator between the Univer
sity and nation?
AB: I think so. I think there were so
few voices speaking for the research
voices on the I think Stanford has to
go back into that. We've tended to
keep a low profile since the early
1990'5, but we've got to get back into
that.

keep a low profile since the early
1990'5, but we've got to get back into
that.
The Daily conducted a one-on-one interview with
Arthur Bienenstock, who was recently appointed
vice provost and dean of research and graduate pol
icy. Bienenstock discussed his past experiences and
what he hopes to accomplish in his new role at the
University.
The Daily: So can vou tell us a little bit about your
self?
Arthur Bienenstock: Oh, I don't know where to
start — I did undergraduate and master's degrees
in New York, and then I went to Harvard as a grad
uate student, worked in England fora year, went
back to Harvard as an assistant professor... I
came out here in 1966 on sabbatical, went back to
Harvard fora year, and then came back here per
manendy.
So that was 1967. In 1969, I got made chair of
CUAFA, the Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aid, and among other things, it
was my committee that got rid of the restriction on
the founding grant that Mrs. Stanford put in, diat
limited the number of women at Stanford, as stu
dents, to 500. This was also the period after Martin
Luther King Jr. died, so we dealt with minority rela
tions — it was an interesting committee.
From there, I went on to be a fellow, and then fac
ulty affirmative action officer, and vice provost for
faculty affairs in 1972, I did that for five years. In
1978,1 went up to SLAC to direct the Stanford Syn
chrotronic Radiation Lab. I did that until 1997 —
just short of twenty [years] — went up to Washing
ton D.C. to be associate director of the White House
Office of science and technology policy for the last
three-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration,
and now I'm going to go back to Building 10, as vice
provost and dean.
TD: So how did you end up here?
AB: I think a number of factors. First, the experience
I have in Washington. I was associate director for the
[Office of Science and Technology Policy]. That gave
me an opportunity to really get involved in policy that
relates to research universities at a national level. I
think Stanford wants to influence those policies, or
play a role in developing those policies.
Second, I have directed two independent labora
tories — first the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, and now the Geballe Laboratory for Ad
vanced Materials. So I had experience in the inde
pendent laboratories, which are an important com
ponent in the dean of research's responsibilities
TD: Can you explain some of the responsibilities of
the dean, as well as precedents set by soon-departing
Dean Charles Kreuger?
AB: First of all, whenever you go into one of these po
sitions, three months after you go into it, it looks
much different from before you go in. And I'm very
much aware of that.
As seen from the outside and from my interactions
with [current] Dean Kreuger, the dean has a number
of responsibilities. One duty is to foster interdiscipli
nary and interdepartmental and interschool re
search. As part of that, the Dean oversees these inde
pendent laboratories — for example, the Geballe
Laboratory of Advanced Materials, which has faculty
from applied physics, materials science, mechanical
engineering — you get the picture.
So part of this responsibility is to help see that these
[interdisciplinary] programs thrive — because a lot
of the interesting research is that the intersection of
different departments and different schools.

Another function is to help increase the diversity
of our graduate student population — this is an
area which has interested me now for thirty years or
so — first on Undergraduate Admissions Commit
tee, then as faculty affirmative action officer. And
then in Washington it was a big issue for me, be
cause we looked down into the future of sciences
and technology and reached the conclusion that, if
we failed to increase the participation of women and
minorities in science and engineering, the nation
would probably lack people that are needed in sci
ence and technology.
A third function is to see that the University has ap
propriate policies towards its graduate students —
everything from health insurance, health care, on
U P
A fourth responsibility, which probably I will be
emphasizing more than [the current Dean] Charles is
to see that the nation has good policies towards re
search, immigration procedures, visas for students,
things of that nature, which I dealt with a fair bit dur
ing my three years in Washington.
Many of these areas are going through interest
ing policy, but obviously you can only do so
much — what do you hope to focus on, and expect
to accomplish.
In terms of interdepartmental relations, I want to
work with the major deans — to see whether, in col
laboration, we can make these interdisciplinary pro
grams more effective.
For example, let me explain the situation at this
laboratory. I, as director of this lab, reporting to the
dean of research — the office which I will be assum
ing in September — have control over the space in
this lab. Meanwhile, faculty appointments are appro
priately performed in departments, and yet we want
to build a coherent programs -and coherent pro
grams— in this laboratory from a broad array of de
partments.
What I hope to accomplish is more cooperation —
that is, to pursue the question: how can we keep the
departments very strong, and yet, build the interdis
cplinary component?
Should we, for example, include faculty from
other departments [in decisions] when a specific de
partment is going to make an appoinunent of a fac
ulty member who is likely to participate in this labo
ratory?
TD: Can you comment on some of your relevant ex
periences in Washington and as a professor
AB: When I was in Washington, of the duties in
Washington that are relevant to this position, one was
balancing funding. I spent a lot of time on that — I
spent a lot of time trying to convince legislators and
members of the executive branch that, even if you're
only interested in the health of the nation, you [still]
want to fund the physical sciences and engineering,
as well as [the National Institute of Health]. It's a cam
paign I continue on, even here.
[But] it was effective — President Clinton and
Vice President Gore both quickly realized the impor
tance of the physical sciences and engineering, once
they understood the story.
It took us longer to reach Congress, because Con
gress is more diffuse — but I think Congress has also
realized that it must keep the physical sciences and
engineering and the social sciences strong, in coordi
nation with the biomedical sciences.
Another thing I learned is that you can influence
Congress.
Another issue that I continue to work on is indirect
costs. Early in my career I chaired the Committee on
Research in the early 1990'5, when Congress came
and investigated Stanford on indirect cost issues. At
that time, I was concerned that the
indirect cost rates were going too
high.
TD: Can you explain "indirect
costs?"
AB: When I as a faculty member,
get a research grant, there are two
components to this. There is money
that I used direcdy from that grant,
to support research.
But the University has other
costs associated with that
research — things like heating the
buildings, depreciation of build
ings — we are constantly, as a Uni
versity, either building new build
ings, or rebuilding old buildings, to
meet new research needs. These
are costs that are vital to research,
and that you cannot attribute to a
specific project — these are indi
rect costs.
In the early 1990'5, Congress
and the OMB put a cap on ad
ministrative costs — the cost of
secretaries, and people who do
the accounting for the grant,
things like that. And it's starting
to hurt seriously. I think the Uni
versities, particularly American
Universities, have become too
thin on support staff. Our sup
port staff is becoming very heavi
ly burdened. I'd like to turn that

around. That won't be too popu
lar with faculty, and yet I think
the faculty see that need.
Every one of us faces a conilict
we'd like a maximum amount of
money to go to research, and yet we
want modern research buildings,
and support staff— we rely on our
administrative assistants— we de
pend on them, and we want all
these things, but we don't really
want to pay for them!
TD: How do you see yourself facili
tating the connection between the
University and nation?
AB: I know that my fellow officers
and colleagues in the Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy, are all
taking up tiiis problem too. I would
like to make sure that have systemat
ic input, and I would like to work with
other Universities to make sure that
the Office receives systematic input.
TD: How has research policy and
policy continuity changed between
the Bush and Clinton Administra
tions?
AB: Well, let's go back to the bal
ance issue. I think that every Ad
ministration that isn't very experi
enced on these matters comes in
and sees health research as most im
portant. Then, as they get more ex
perience, they realize that they have
to fund the physical sciences as well.
We saw that in the Clinton adminis
tration, and now we're seeing it in

the Bush administration — initial
ly, they were committed to doubling
the budget of the NIH — and now
they're extending that to the physi
cal sciences.
In this area, I don't see as
much a difference between Re
publican and Democrat, as be
tween more-experience and less
experience. For example, on
these issues of indirect costs, the
present head of Jack Marburger,
is a person who's been a universi
ty president, and I don't think
that he and I, and the Clinton and
Bush Administration, view things
that much differently.
Since the people in the OMB are
always fighting problems of budget
deficits — they want to keep admin
istrative costs to minimum. There's
always a tension — a proper ten
sion between offices, rather than a
Republican-Democrat split. Where
as in some areas there are big differ
ences between the Clinton adminis
tration and Bush administration,
on these levels I don't see a large dif
ference.
TD: So you see yourself as becom
ing a facilitator between the Univer
sity and nation?
AB: I think so. I think there were so
few voices speaking for the research
voices on the I think Stanford has to
go back into that. We've tended to
keep a low profile since the early
1990'5, but we've got to get back into
that.
