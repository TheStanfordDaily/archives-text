## How the West was won No surprises on the Farm 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Kim Clijsters played the role of both
champion and savior at the 2003 Bank
of the West Classic.
At the start of the event, some skeptics
may have questioned the amount of ex
citement that could possibly come of a
field that lacked name recognition after
the pre-tournament withdrawals of Ser
ena Williams, Anna Kournikova and
Lindsay Davenport.
But the Belgian sensation, who has
risen to the world ranking of No. 2 at the
amazing age of 20, instilled life into the
competition last week at theTaube Fam
ily Tennis Center.
Clijsters roared through her first
three matches, defeating Amber Liu,
Marie-Gaianeh Mikaelian and
Francesca Schiavone in straight sets.
She then battled through three sets to
defeat Jennifer Capriati, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2,
and downed a player who had defeated
Clijsters in three of four previous meet
ings, including a 1-6, 6-4, 12-10
marathon at the 2001 French Open.
The transition to the summer hard
court circuit did not seem to bother Cli
jsters, although she struggled at times
during the first set of the Mikaelian
match.
"It's always after coming from Wim
bledon and the Fed Cup and you don't
always have a lot of time to adjust," Cli
jsters said. "In my first match I played a
night match and my first day match was
probably not as good but I got through."
Clijsters, who won the tournament in
2001, admits that she has a fondness lor
the west coast swing of the WTA sum
mer hardcourt tour that includes stops

at Stanford, San Diego and Los Angeles.
"I was really motivated to be back out
here [at Stanford]," Clijsters said. "This
is definitely one of my favorites of the
year, and this trip is always one that I
look forward to."
"There are a lot of Belgians living
here or going to college here, so it's nice
to see them again."
This season has been memorable for
the 20-year old, although it cannot be

called a breakout year because she won
the WTA Championships to end last sea
son. If she continues to pile victories
atop her 2003 mark of 55-7, she may be
able to snatch that elusive top spot from
Williams, who is currently injured and
withdrew from the J.P. Morgan Chase
Open in Los Angeles.
Whatever the outcome, the woman

who has already climbed to 18th
on the career prize money list will
be satisfied with personal im
provement.
"Of course it would be great to
once be in that No. 1 spot, but this
year I feel I've been playing in
credibly well," she said. "It's not
my main goal — I just try to get
the most out of each match I
play."
A combination of elite power
and speed, Clijsters possesses the
rare elements to contend for the
top spot in women's tennis.
Among the fastest servers in
the tournament, Clijsters domi
nated service points by coupling
serves with topspin-heavy fore
hand winners. Her effort was un
surpassed, as she awed the crowd
with her acrobatic, Roland Gar
ros-esque slides after hustling
cross court.
"There were some shots that
for sure I thought were going to
be winners, but she got to them,"
Liu said after her 6-1, 6-1 loss to
the Belgian.
Aside from her pure talent,
one main factor in Clijsters' suc
cess may be her positive mindset
towards competition.
"My goals are just to enjoy my
tennis every match, practice ses
sion and workout — I try to give
one hundred percent each time,"
she said.
"There are a lot of tough play
ers out there and a lot of players
that I've lost to before.
"Each match has to be played,
you can hope that you'll be there
on the last dav to vie for the title."
