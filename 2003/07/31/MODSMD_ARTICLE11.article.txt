# Capriati doomed by double faults
## "Comeback Kid" falls one set short in bid for first-ever Bank of the West title 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jennifer Capriati's comeback in 2001 —where
she collected her first two Grand Slam titles at the
French and Australian Opens — got tongues
wagging in the tennis world.
Until then, her re-emergence on the court
seemed more like a Drew-Barrymore-esque at
tempt at reclaiming the fame she had reached at
a much earlier age.
Rut when she took the crown again Down
Under in 2002, it was clear Capriati's return was
no flash-in-the-pan.
Which is why, once Serena Williams' with
drawal was announced, the 45,000-odd specta
tors watching last week's Bank of the West Clas
sic were right in predicting that Capriati would
battle it out-with Kim Clijsters in the final
match.
Clijsters and Capriati had met before, most
notably when Capriati bested the then-18-year
old Belgian 12 games to 10 in the longest last set
in French Open history for the 2001 champi
onship. In their past duels, Capriati had always
emerged on top, except in their last meeting be
fore the Bank of the YVest.
But it was anyone's guess as to who would
emerge victorious this time.
"Kim and I bring out the best in each other,"
Capriati said after clinching a berth in the tour
nament final. "If I play like I did today [in the
semifinal] she will take advantage of those mis
takes."
What became clear at Sunday's championship
match is that Capriati's worst enemy is herself.
Although well-matched against Clijsters — their
speed and long strides were al
most as indistinguishable from
the stands as their Fila outfits —
Capriati's streaky play and dou
ble faults (including the one that
ended the match) forced her to
continue searching fora title.
The Classic marked the first time
since March that she had ap
peared in a tournament final and
it has been more than 18 months
since she has brought home a
first-place trophy.
Clusters' strong serve opened
the match up with a bang and
her speed allowed her to suc
cessfully approach the net, start

ing her off 3-0. Clijsters' confi
dence may have built too much
as her shots fell long often, let
ting Capriati build momentum
to take the first set 6-4.
"I played aggressively in the
first set, moving toward the net
put a little more oomph behind
my shots," Capriati said. "My
shoulder made a difference in
the second set. My serve wasn't
big and she could break me."
After breaking Clijsters serve
to start the second set, it seemed
like Capriati might close the
door in just two sets, despite her
right shoulder that had been
rubbed down by a trainer after
the first set.
But it was clear from the start
that Capriati was not playing
her game the way she had

hoped. After a fault on a first
serve, she threw the ball and hit
a linesman in frustration. Cli
jsters managed to come back in
the second, opening up the an
gles of the court to keep
Capriati guessing where she
would place the ball.
Clysters' seven break point
conversions were the key in the
latter part of the match, as she
made Capriati work to win any
game points she could collect.
As her adrenaline built, so did
the precision of her shots — and
Capriati's disappointment.
"A player like Kim's not
going to give away the majch in
the third set," Capriati said. "I
definitely had my chances to
close out the match."
It wasn't Clijsters consistent

backhand or powerful service
that ultimately allowed her to
walk away with the winner's
check. It was the chances that
Capriati didn't take and the
overconfidence she exhibited
after the first set that allowed
the Belgian to chalk up the
win.
"\V'e have close matches be
cause we are similar players,"
Clijsters said. "We hit the ball
similarly, we run a lot — there's
a similarity in our games."
"Playing against Kim I get
the feeling of what it would be
like to play against myself,"
Capriati said.
But as the U.S. Open ap
proaches, Capriati is hoping
that playing against herself
doesn't always result in defeat.
