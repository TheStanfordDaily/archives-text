# Liu still unsure of future after rough encounter with tour elite
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
What's next for freshman Car
dinal sensation Amber Liu, who is
debating whether to return to the
Farm or join the professional cir
cuit?
Alter her performance at the
2003 Bank of the West Classic,
strong arguments could be made
for either case. Liu shined at
times, namely in the final two sets
of her 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 second-round
win over qualifier Tara Snyder,
an eight-year tour veteran.
The 20-year-old wild card's
second match was not as smooth
as her first, however. She unfor

tunately collided with eventual
champion Kim Clijsters, and the
result was less encouraging than
the face-off with Snyder.
. The quick and powerful Cli
jsters downed Liu 6-1, 6-1 on her
home courts in front of a packed
and anticipatory crowd on Thurs
day evening.
Liu looked very nervous at the
start of the match and was trailing
5-0 before many fans were in their
seats. She managed to salvage one
game on her own serve, but Cli
jsters slammed the door with a
love game for the set.
The reigning NCAA singles
champion was broken to start the
second set, but Liu seemed to set

tie down when she battled and
broke Clijsters to even the set. It
was not to be, though, as Clijsters
was too formidable an opponent,
dropping just four points in the
final four games of the 44-minute
victory.
"I thought I served pretty well â€”
she's just too strong for me and she
pretty much overpowered me," Liu
said after the match.
Clijsters highlighted her oppo
nent's strengths after the match.
"She [Liu] hardly misses any
backhands and she hits a few
serves over 100 [mph], so if she
gets a little bit stronger she can be
a really good player," Clijsters
said. "I had to play very aggres

sive from the beginning and
make her move and make her
make the mistakes."
Although her loss may have
been a bit frustrating, it should by
no means be disheartening for
the young Cardinal phenom.
Women's tennis is a sport often
dominated by the top 10, or even
five, players in the world, and
many tour veterans are routinely
dominated by the likes of Clijsters
and the Williams sisters.
Nonetheless, Liu acknowl
edges her weaknesses and knows
she must work for professional
success.
She cited "going to the gym
and working on my upper body

strength and my movement on
the court" as areas of improve
ment, while adding that "going
out there and playing someone
that big makes you realize that
they're human and they make
mistakes too."
"I had some deuce games and
some game points and it just
shows you that with some work
you can be there too."
Liu's decision is not expected
until she finishes her summer of
competition in professional tour
naments. Her final event, and
perhaps best barometer for her
talent, will come in August when
she participates in the U.S. Open
in Flushing Meadows, New York.
