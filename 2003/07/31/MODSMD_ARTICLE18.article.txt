# Third 'Pie' film lacks spice
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
To make a great pie yon need
high-quality ingredients, a good
ret ipe and some degree of skill in the
kitchen, a formula which can easily
be transferred to filmmaking.
Although "American Wedding,"
the third and final installment in the
"American Pie" series, has thor
oughly mixed and baked in some of
the necessary ingredients of a good
movie, including great acting and a
popular formula, the final product is
palatable but not satisfying, even
when fresh out of the oven.
Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle
(Alyson Hannigan) have decided to
wed. Naturally, this brings about all
manner of chaotic fervor as the cou
ple and their friends and families try
to throw a wedding together at
break-neck speed.
Why the hurry? We never find
out.
Despite the fact that the story is
about Jim and Mic helle's wedding,
the movie revolves around Steve Sti
fler (Seann William Scott), the manic
fiat boy-turned-football-coach who
features prominently in nearly every
scene. He and his rival Paul Finch
(Eddie Kaye Thomas) both fall for
Michelle's sister Cadence (January
Jones) and Stifler turns into an ar
gyle-sweater-wearing picture of
preppiness in order to impress her.
Scott's Jim-Carrey-esque elastic fa
cial expressions and continual flow
of profanities are amusing and set
the light-hearted tone of the movie.
"American Wedding" tries to lose
the sophomoric qualities of its pre
decessors and focus on the adult
theme of marriage. There's no ulti
mate party scene in this movie, no in
cessant talk of getting laid and no
real character development. Jim

tries to be more responsible, but still
manages gets into strange trouble.
The other characters are there more
to further the plot than anything
else. Stiller is the only character we
get to understand a little better, and
that's not saying much. Noticeably
absent are many of the characters of
the first two movies, who are not ac
counted for in the film.
If there's one thing that can be
said for this trilogy, it's that it never
fails to deliver outrageous scenes of
superlative embarrassment.
Where else could you find an
opening sequence where the main
character is in a restaurant, some
what unobtrusively receiving oral
sex, only to be interrupted by his fa
ther who unwittingly forces him to
reveal himself (all of himself) and the
whereabouts of his girlfriend (under
the table) to the rest of the patrons of
the restaurant?
The writer, Adam Hertz (who
also has writing credits for the other
two movies), has re-written the book
on bodily humor and the comedic
sequences in "American Wedding"
are perhaps the most creative of the
series.
Director Jesse Dylan, who is new
to the franchise, is adept at mount
ing the tension and keeping the au
dience's interest through the long,
elaborate comedy sequences. The
best scenes in the movie had the

roll-with-the-punches feel of im
prov as the characters found
themselves forced to explain away
nearly impossible situations.
Surprisingly, the acting is the
saving grace of the movie.
Although the script is lack-luster
and the basic story is uninteresting,
the performances from Biggs,
Scott and especially Eugene Levy
(reprising his role as Jim's Dad)
keep the material fresh and funny.
In particular, the scenes between
Biggs and Levy could have fallen
over the edge into maudlin territo
ry, but the embarrassment-laden
father-son relationship established
in the first movie continues to be
the heart of the series.
Unfortunately, the movie
doesn't quite know how much of its
ingredients to combine to get the
best-tasting product: is it half a cup
of drama and a cup and a half of
comedy or the other way around?
Between the sex jokes, the first
"American Pie" was able to sneak in
an emotionally truthful glimpse at
a group of friends at the end of
high school but "American Wed
ding" fails to do the same for mar
riage.
Here, the comedic interludes are
so prominent, and the more dramat
ic parts of the movie are not suffi
ciently developed, that the flick
seems more like a vehicle for the
gross-out humor that's the trade
mark of the series than anything else.
It's worth seeing "American
Wedding" for the wildly funny and
creative (albeit disgusting) comedy
sequences, but don't expect much
more from a pie that is only half
baked at best.
