### ILENA C. GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
"L'Auberge Espagnole" (The Spanish Inn),
aka "Euro Pudding," takes off like a jet â€” and
doesn't let you down until the credits roll. An en
tertaining and engaging storyline, international
cast, hip multi-lingual soundtrack and beautiful
Barcelona backdrop raise this art house flick far

The story follows the affable yet slightly naive
Xavier (Romain Duris), a young French student
who is told by a businessman friend of his fa

the other line speaks one of a grab-bag of differ

to cheat them and the question of how to fairly

divide housework (and space in a tiny refrigera

Xavier's attempts to adjust to life abroad
bring to mind the traditional American trope of

he lived with while first in Spain.
