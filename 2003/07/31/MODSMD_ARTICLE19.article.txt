# 'Euro Pudding': A tasty treat that will make you say 'Oui.'
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
"L'Auberge Espagnole" (The Spanish Inn),
aka "Euro Pudding," takes off like a jet — and
doesn't let you down until the credits roll. An en
tertaining and engaging storyline, international
cast, hip multi-lingual soundtrack and beautiful
Barcelona backdrop raise this art house flick far
above its flaws.
The story follows the affable yet slightly naive
Xavier (Romain Duris), a young French student
who is told by a businessman friend of his fa
ther's to go study abroad in Spain to score a good
job after college. From there, the movie launch
es into a parody of university bureaucracy as
Xavier applies for and is accepted into the Eras

mus program. Once lie gets to Spain, he is quick
ly befriended by another French couple who
take him under their wing. Although he crashes
on their couch for several days, he decides to
find his own place and ends up interviewing for
a spot in a house full of other students from all
over Europe. He is accepted into the apartment,
and wackiness ensues as the roommates adjust
to life together.
The movie glorifies the aesthetic but jubilant
lifestyle of the young Europeans in a way that is
both amusing and sincere. Some of the obstacles
the roommates face include: attempting to cope
with answering the phone when the person on
the other line speaks one of a grab-bag of differ
ent languages, avoiding their renter who is out
to cheat them and the question of how to fairly

divide housework (and space in a tiny refrigera
tor).
Xavier's attempts to adjust to life abroad
bring to mind the traditional American trope of
leaving for college; he feels an increasing es
trangement from his parents, particularly his
crazy hippie mother (Martine Demaret). Xavier
also tries to maintain an alternately strong and
crumbling long-distance relationship with his
girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tatou) while suc
cumbing to an increasing attraction to Anne-So
phie (Judith Godreche), the wife in the couple
he lived with while first in Spain.
Under the direction of Cedric Klapisch,
"L'Auberge Espagnole" is visually enticing in a
manner reminiscent of "Amelie";
klapisch' judicious use of subtle
special effects add a perfect touch
to the film and keep the movie
going at a quick clip. The trippv
MRI montage scene is a somewhat
random, yet fun-to-vvatch, high
light of the film.
Throughout "L'Auberge," the
dialogue seamlessly switches be
tween French, Spanish and Eng
lish (among other languages),
adding to the general chaotic cele
bration of European culture per
vading the film.
The acting, in addition, is excel
lent; you start rooting for Xavier
within the first few frames of the
film, and the roommates' strange
mixture of distance and loyalty to
ward each other is credible and
true-to-life.

Despite its great qualities, the
movie goes from pudding to pud
dle by trying to do too much. Just as
much of the movie seems to emu
late lite, "L'Auberge" goes past its
point of saturation by trying to in
clude all the characters and sub
plots that Xavier and his friends are
involved with or in; there is just too
much going on for one movie. At
one point, one roommate's ex-girl
friend shows up with a baby in tow
— his baby. His current girlfriend
veils at him to take responsibility
for his child, but after that the issue
melts away.
Part of the point the movie
makes is that unusual things hap
pen to people, especially when a lot
of people are living in a small space
together.
' Well, duh.
All in all, the story meanders and
weaves through the characters' lives
intermittently like a driver without
a map in San Francisco.
But it's a great ride.
