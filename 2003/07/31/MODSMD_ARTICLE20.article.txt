"In Praise of Love"
Jean-Luc Godard's latest film, "In Praise
of Love" (2001), is a dense, haunting
labyrinth of thoughts, allusions and im
ages. It tells the story of the young artist
Edgar (Bruno Putzulu) — first as he strug
gles to complete his project on the four
stages of love, then jumping back two years
as he gets to know two former French Re
sistance fighters, now elderly and selling
their story to Steven Spielberg.
Linking the time periods is a young
woman (Cecile Camp) whom Edgar pur
sues, then (thanks to the film's backwards
chronology) meets for the first time.
Despite the title, the real subject of "In
Praise of Love" is not love, but memory.
"Without memory, there can be no resis
tance," we are told. The film itself — with
its achingly beautiful black-and-white shots
of ghostly Parisian streets, and its fragmen
tary, elliptical structure — feels like a col
lection of already fading memories.
The shrill anti-Americanism of the
movie's accusations that Steven Spielberg
(and through him, the entire American
movie industry) has appropriated and be
trayed the memory of the Holocaust quick
ly grows wearying; not just because it be
comes annoyingly one-note, but also be
cause the whole argument betrays a disillu
sionment and distrust of cinema that left
me longing for the exuberant affection that
Godard brought to "Breathless", "Band of
Outsiders" and others.
In the end, though, the power of "In
Praise of Love" reaffirms the faith that Go
dard seems to have lost — that movies can
movingly and meaningfully reflect the
world that we live in. The film may be a
confusing, cantankerous maze, but it's
worth getting lost in.
