## How to find an off-campus fling 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Despite Ms. Sass' admittedly diminutive
stature, there is one category in which she gives
the likes of Horace Grant (Mark Madsen, we
onlv hope you left the Lakers because you didn't
approve of Kobe Bryant's adultery) a run for his
money: rebounding.
But, you ask, after overcoming the hurdle of
dating at Stanford, do I have the strength to do
it again?
Before you give up on summer lovin' and de
cide to ward off the waves of sadness with your
own favorite greased lightning consider trying a
relationship with a non-Stanfordite.
There are two problems Ms. Sass often ob
serves her peers encounter with the elusive re
bound.
Situation one: he thinks he's only looking for
a fling but proceeds to profess his undying love
and unpack his emotional baggage from the last
relationship a week after meeting her.
Situation two: she just wanted a hook-up, but
can't live down the fact that she found it on the
Sigma Chi dance floor with a guy her friends
swear is a grad student who now won't stop call
ing her.
But these sticky situations can be eliminated
by moving beyond the reaches of the Campus
Drive loop. So let's get ready to meet someone
who doesn't know what MemChu is.
Step one: the dress. While a tube top and
leather pants may have been necessary for that
sweet-but-quiet guy to gyrate with you at Glitter
Party, Ms. Sass assures you that non-Stanford
men need much subtler hints.
To you Stanford guys, please do not make
the Cardinal mistake of taking dressing tips
from Adam King on "The Real World Paris"
(who wears a red Stanford sweatshirt with
matching sweatpants?).
Step two: picking your target. This is always
a struggle, as leaving the Stanford bubble means
you don't know the hook-up history of every
person in the room. No matter what, make sure

to not waste your cleverly honed pick-up lines
— although Ms. Sass asks you, out of respect, to
remove the "Is your daddy a terrorist? 'Cause
you da bomb!" line from your repetoire.
While you might have liked the comfort of a
Stanford guy/girl before because, even though
you don't want to admit it, the admissions office
provides you with quality-controlled choices for
a Friday-night hook-up, Ms. Sass believes that
the pool table allows a nice screening process for
potential pinch-and-squeal candidates.
The girl playing pool can, however, take on
two forms: the girl actually playing pool or the
girl who accompanied her boyfriend on guy's
night out to make sure he didn't end up at a
strip club. Avoid this latter form: none of her sin
gle friends will talk to you once her posse of boys
roughs you up after hitting on her.
The guy playing pool is usually up fora
challenge, which means one of Ms. Sass's fa
vorite Dating Games can be used: The Loser-
Buys-The-Winner-A-Drink Game. Wait until
his friends become more interested in playing
video porn memory. While he's holding his
cue and looking lost — don't worry, he won't
look that lost when he's back at your place
holding his cue — coax him into another
round of eight ball with you. The prospect of
a drink and the chance to talk to you will in
trigue him.
Ms. Sass has one caveat: if the drink you end
up ordering is something girly (an appletini, a
light beer, or a cider) this will probably go
nowhere. Buckle down and drink something
hard just this once. It will raise his eyebrows
when you say that a Saturday night is not com
plete without your friend Jim Beam, but not
when you mention that you've loved Cos
mopolitans ever since you bought every season
of "Sex and the City" on DVI).
Above all else, don't drop yourself into a
monogamous relationship (remember, that's
what started all of this). The important thing
about a fling is its light-heartedness.
Besides, if you keep your wits about you,
being flung can feel pretty damn good.
