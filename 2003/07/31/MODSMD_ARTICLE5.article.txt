## Workers demand rights 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
At 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, workers
from across Stanford rallied near the Stan
ford Shopping Center on El Camino Real
to demand that the University allow tem
porary employees to unionize, guarantee
the job security of current union members
against subcontracting, carry out possible
layoffs on seniority and increase current
health care benefits.
The workers and their families, stu
dents and other community members
marched to block the intersection of El
Camino and Sand Hill Road, where 10
people, including two students, were ar
rested for civil disobedience.
Police estimated that the crowd num
bered from 100 to 150 people, while the
union put it closer to 300.
Lourdes Estrada, who was arrested yes
terday on the charge of obstructing traffic,
is a temporary worker at Wilbur Dining
who says that she has been working at

Stanford for one year and three months,
but has had her applications for regular
employment refused.
"I am a certified food service handler,
but I don't get any recognition for this,
and instead I'm not eligible for the wages
and benefits of University employees,"
she said. "I want to be part of the union."
SEIU Local 715, which represents di
rectly hired University employees on
campus, has been focusing their cam
paign on job security and the unioniza
tion of temporary positions as they nego
tiate with the University fora new con
tract covering 1,100 of their members.
Those employees' current contract will
end on Aug. 31.
The University said that specific labor
issues would remain confidential until
after a contract resolution, but that it
currently maintains very high labor
standards.
"Many issues that the union has raised

during recent protests are part of
those contract negotiations," said
Gordon Earle, vice provost for
public affairs. "Out of respect for
the negotiation process and the
participants on both sides, we do
not discuss the specifics of our ne
gotiations until they are concluded
and agreement has been reached
between the university and the
SEIU."
Earle stressed that "Stanford
greatly values the hard work and
dedication of its employees," and
added that University labor
practices are "fair and reason
able and among the best of any
university or private business in
the country."
At the protest, local and re
gional union organizers rallied
union workers from the Stanford
Hospital and Clinics, Housing
and Dining Services, Facilities,
Bon Appetit, as well as temporary
workers to the call of "si se
puede," or "yes, we can," the slo
gan of service unions across the
country.
"The point of gathering all of
these people together is to con
tinue to try to impress upon
Stanford that these problems are
problems that affect the entire
community," said Zev Kvitky, an
accelerator operator at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
the president of United Stanford
Workers — the SEIU chapter on
campus — and one of yester
day's arrestees.
"It's clear from past actions
and today that all of us, every
group of workers at Stanford
stand behind these workers; that
the abuse of temporary workers,
the lack of job security, the trend
to contract jobs out, these affect
everybody at Stanford. In order
to find solutions, we will contin
ue to stand together as one com
munity."
Clara Webb, Class of'o3, who
is currently working with the
union and was a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
during her four years at Stanford,
as well as being another of yester
day's arrestees, explained the
purpose of these public protests.
"I've spent a long time work
ing with the workers at Stanford,
and I've realized how important
it is to do big actions like this, be
cause otherwise the media
doesn't cover stories about work
ers," she said. "It's something
that's necessary and it's impor
tant to make that statement to the
public. It's building on the work
that we've done, most recently
with the hunger fast last quarter."
Fora week during the end of
last May and the beginning of
last June, six Stanford students
fasted fora campus-wide labor
code of conduct. The fast ended

when the students and the Uni
versity administration agreed to
form a committee to advise Uni
versity President John Hennessy
on labor issues, comprised of fac
ulty, students, employees and
administrators.

Earle highlighted Stanford's
efforts to reach out to its workers
within the context of the recent
labor protests.
"Earlier this year, for exam
ple, we joined a select group of
universities nationwide that

have implemented living wage
guidelines for subcontracted
workers," he said. "Additionally,
the University recently estab
lished a presidential advisory
committee to study and make
recommendations regarding

numerous workplace issues at
Stanford, including those affect
ing temporary workers. Those
recommendations will be pre
sented to the president of Stan
ford University during the
spring of 2004."

Stanford for one year and three months,
but has had her applications for regular
employment refused.
"I am a certified food service handler,
but I don't get any recognition for this,
and instead I'm not eligible for the wages
and benefits of University employees,"
she said. "I want to be part of the union."
SEIU Local 715, which represents di
rectly hired University employees on
campus, has been focusing their cam
paign on job security and the unioniza
tion of temporary positions as they nego
tiate with the University fora new con
tract covering 1,100 of their members.
Those employees' current contract will
end on Aug. 31.
The University said that specific labor
issues would remain confidential until
after a contract resolution, but that it
currently maintains very high labor
standards.
"Many issues that the union has raised

Workers and their families, students and other University community members gathered near the
Stanford Shopping Center yesterday to demand greater benefits for campus workers.
during recent protests are part of
those contract negotiations," said
Gordon Earle, vice provost for
public affairs. "Out of respect for
the negotiation process and the
participants on both sides, we do
not discuss the specifics of our ne
gotiations until they are concluded
and agreement has been reached
between the university and the
SEIU."
Earle stressed that "Stanford
greatly values the hard work and
dedication of its employees," and
added that University labor
practices are "fair and reason
able and among the best of any
university or private business in
the country."
At the protest, local and re
gional union organizers rallied
union workers from the Stanford
Hospital and Clinics, Housing
and Dining Services, Facilities,
Bon Appetit, as well as temporary
workers to the call of "si se
puede," or "yes, we can," the slo
gan of service unions across the
country.
"The point of gathering all of
these people together is to con
tinue to try to impress upon
Stanford that these problems are
problems that affect the entire
community," said Zev Kvitky, an
accelerator operator at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
the president of United Stanford
Workers — the SEIU chapter on
campus — and one of yester
day's arrestees.
"It's clear from past actions
and today that all of us, every
group of workers at Stanford
stand behind these workers; that
the abuse of temporary workers,
the lack of job security, the trend
to contract jobs out, these affect
everybody at Stanford. In order
to find solutions, we will contin
ue to stand together as one com
munity."
Clara Webb, Class of'o3, who
is currently working with the
union and was a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
during her four years at Stanford,
as well as being another of yester
day's arrestees, explained the
purpose of these public protests.
"I've spent a long time work
ing with the workers at Stanford,
and I've realized how important
it is to do big actions like this, be
cause otherwise the media
doesn't cover stories about work
ers," she said. "It's something
that's necessary and it's impor
tant to make that statement to the
public. It's building on the work
that we've done, most recently
with the hunger fast last quarter."
Fora week during the end of
last May and the beginning of
last June, six Stanford students
fasted fora campus-wide labor
code of conduct. The fast ended

when the students and the Uni
versity administration agreed to
form a committee to advise Uni
versity President John Hennessy
on labor issues, comprised of fac
ulty, students, employees and
administrators.

Earle highlighted Stanford's
efforts to reach out to its workers
within the context of the recent
labor protests.
"Earlier this year, for exam
ple, we joined a select group of
universities nationwide that

have implemented living wage
guidelines for subcontracted
workers," he said. "Additionally,
the University recently estab
lished a presidential advisory
committee to study and make
recommendations regarding

numerous workplace issues at
Stanford, including those affect
ing temporary workers. Those
recommendations will be pre
sented to the president of Stan
ford University during the
spring of 2004."
