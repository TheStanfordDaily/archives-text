# Tresidder still a work in progress

### CAROLINE CICCONE 
With the summer half over, University Housing
and Dining Services is continuing their push to pro
vide a wider variety of dining options at Tresidder
Memorial Union, working specifically to install na
tional vendors and develop the CoHo's menu before
the entire facility reopens for the upcoming school
year.
The University is currently negotiating with
private vendors such as Paradise Pizza, Peet's Cof
fee, Subway and a number of sushi restaurants to
set up locations in the newly renovated Tresidder.
No deals have been made, but vendor contracts
should be finalized in the next few weeks, said
Nadeem Siddiqui, executive director of Dining
Services.
In addition to these franchise offerings, new
Stanford Dining Services programs will be intro
duced. Fashioned after Bon Appetit's former of
ferings, Dining Services will offer a salad bar, a
grab-and-go, a grill, wraps and a noodle bowl sta
tion.
The vendors initially selected will be changed
after a couple years, Siddiqui said, as "People get
bored, so you need to look for new [ones]."
It is unlikely that a new Tresidder building will be
constructed in the near future, a plan that was
under consideration at the end of the last academic
year. Siddiqui said that financial obstacles would
make a project of such large-scale difficult to ac
complish.
Tresidder renovation will occur in four phases
and be completed in the next year and a half. The
first phase will be done by mid-September, when
two new vendors will be opened and some seating

and aesthetic changes made.
Last spring, Dining Services agreed to rehire
the staff of Bon Appetit, the private food service
company that had formerly run the CoHo, the
Tresidder dining facilities and a campus catering
operation.
According to St IU Local 715 representative Rox
ana Rivera, 13 of the 30 union employees from Bon

The newly renovated CoHo opened its doors, inviting
students to explore the fresh ambience. Although some
have complained about the limited menu, project
managers say it is still a work in progress.
