# Tresidder still a work in progress
## 
### CAROLINE CICCONE 
With the summer half over, University Housing
and Dining Services is continuing their push to pro
vide a wider variety of dining options at Tresidder
Memorial Union, working specifically to install na
tional vendors and develop the CoHo's menu before
the entire facility reopens for the upcoming school
year.
The University is currently negotiating with
private vendors such as Paradise Pizza, Peet's Cof
fee, Subway and a number of sushi restaurants to
set up locations in the newly renovated Tresidder.
No deals have been made, but vendor contracts
should be finalized in the next few weeks, said
Nadeem Siddiqui, executive director of Dining
Services.
In addition to these franchise offerings, new
Stanford Dining Services programs will be intro
duced. Fashioned after Bon Appetit's former of
ferings, Dining Services will offer a salad bar, a
grab-and-go, a grill, wraps and a noodle bowl sta
tion.
The vendors initially selected will be changed
after a couple years, Siddiqui said, as "People get
bored, so you need to look for new [ones]."
It is unlikely that a new Tresidder building will be
constructed in the near future, a plan that was
under consideration at the end of the last academic
year. Siddiqui said that financial obstacles would
make a project of such large-scale difficult to ac
complish.
Tresidder renovation will occur in four phases
and be completed in the next year and a half. The
first phase will be done by mid-September, when
two new vendors will be opened and some seating

and aesthetic changes made.
Last spring, Dining Services agreed to rehire
the staff of Bon Appetit, the private food service
company that had formerly run the CoHo, the
Tresidder dining facilities and a campus catering
operation.

ana Rivera, 13 of the 30 union employees from Bon

dealing with climate change, re
searchers must be wary of unantic
ipated outcomes of new technolo
gy, such as using hydrogen as a
fuel on a large scale.
"What will be the unknowns?"
Edwards asked. "I'm pretty con
vinced we're not smart enough to
predict what nature does."
Edwards cited previous efforts
to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions
as an example of well-intentioned
science producing dangerous out
comes. Reducing nitrogen oxide
emissions from vehicles utilized
technology that converted air pol
lutants into carbon dioxide â€” a gas
scientists at the time knew was not
toxic, but did not realize it might
lead to global climate change.
"The amount of energy that we
use is so large that it isn't a small
perturbation of the planet any
more," Edwards said. "Even with
things like hydrogen, we have to be
more careful."

Appetit have already been rehired,
fhe union expects the remaining
17 to be rehired by September, she
said.
All Tresidder employees will
continue to be paid union wages
after vendors have been selected
and installed. Siddiqui said that
Stanford's Subway workers would
be the highest paid Subway work
ers in the country.
Olivia Williamson, a student
member of the Advisory Board and
a graduate student in Manage
ment, Science and Engineering,
said, "That's been an issue when
talking with outside vendors, ap
parently, because some of them
were not willing to work with Stan
ford if we insisted on managing
everyone and paying those higher

levels."
Siddiqui commented that 50
dining points per quarter will be
able to be applied at the new
restaurant locations, although
some students have expressed in
terest in having more points avail
able for Tresidder usage.
"The difficulty is trying to keep
the balance between the residential
dining program and using points
in retail," he said.
Along with Tresidder and the
CoHo, Stanford Dining will be op
erating the cafe in the Clark Cen
ter, the Bio-X building slated to
open in September.
In response to student com
plaints that the renovated CoHo's
menu has been pared down, Advi
sory Board member Jeff Catalano,
a graduate student in Geological
and Environmental Sciences, said,
"I think it is important that every
one understands that this is a work
in progress, and will be for the next

year. 1 ask that everyone waits to
pass final judgement until we have
a finished product."
Dining Services has been work
ing on the plans with theTresidder
Dining Advisory Board. Com
prised of students and community
members, the board meets once a
week during the school year and
bi-monthly over the summer to
help the dining and construction
staff envision the changes that
need to happen during the reno
vation.
In addition to this group, Din
ing Services has been working
closely with the ASSU president,
vice president, University adminis
trators and the Student Activity
Space Committee, to add the
Tresidder renovations to the larg
er goal of improving student space
conditions. Those plans entail pro
viding more student space for
events programming, on-campus
activities, and a centralized meet

ing ground for University commu
nity members.
"As regards to the student activ
ity space planning effort, we're
looking at White Plaza as Stan
ford's town square and the build
ings that surround it contributing
to the creation of a vibrant campus
core," said Gene Awakuni, vice
provost for student affairs. "We're
wanting to make White Plaza more
of a destination for students, a
place where students can hang out
without the fear of being run over
by a bicyclist. We want to create a
more congenial, inviting space
where programs and activities can
flourish, more like a European
plaza.
"We also want Tresidder and
Old Union to be hubs for student
activities," he added. "We're in the
process of looking at ways to re
purpose and re-program those
two building to better accommo
date student activities."
