# GCEP turns to hydrogen
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Note: This article is the second
installment of a three-week series exam
ining the Global Climate and Energy
Project's current research efforts and
opportunities for the future.
Since the announcement of the
Global Climate and Energy Project
last November, optimistic re
searchers have focused much of
the $225 million initiative's re
sources on hydrogen — an area of
investigation that has uniquely
been able to gather support from
nearly all camps in the energy de
bate.
From the inception of GCEP, a
broad program fostering collabo
ration between industry and acad
emia with the end goal of creating
energy-related technologies that
reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
participants pointed to hydrogen
as one of the most promising areas
of research.
"There's a lot of talk about hy
drogen," said GCEP Director
Lynn Orr, professor of petroleum
engineering. "The great appeal of
hydrogen is that when you burn it,
what it makes is water."
While hydrogen is not a source
of energy itself, it is an energy car
rier that, when burned, creates
only water, heat and electricity —
not air pollutants or carbon diox
ide, the primary greenhouse gas
that's rapid human-induced in
crease in the atmosphere is cited as

the primary cause of global warm
ing. Additionally, the natural
abundance of hydrogen also ren
ders it a sustainable source of ener
gy, unlike fossil fuels that have lim
ited reserves expected to be ex
hausted within the next century if
current energy use patterns con
tinue. These two qualities have
helped hydrogen establish itself as
the frontrunner in the race to cre
ate an economically viable alterna
tive to fossil fuels.
A unanimous mandate
Hydrogen's potential to serve as
a sustainable, emission-free fuel for
virtually all energy sectors, com
bined with the widespread percep
tion that hydrogen technologies
will be commercially viable more
readily than other alternative en
ergy technologies, has made
GCEP's focus on one of its initial
four areas of research — hydro
gen production and utilization —
relatively uncontroversial.
Researchers involved with
GCEP as well as faculty who have
critiqued some of the project's ini
tiatives are unified by their support
of Stanford working to advance
hydrogen technologies, and plans
are already underway to expand
current research. The first work
shop organized under GCEP was
on hydrogen technologies and at
tracted nearly 200 participants to
Stanford in April. Orr has also said
that hydrogen will be the first
GCEP research area where pro
jects w ill be added in the upcoming
academic year.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Friedrich Prinz has been working
to expand basic knowledge of how
hydrogen works and bolster meth
ods for hydrogen production
through research that "tends to
ward the fundamentals."
"We're trying to create scientific
methodology to facilitate the dis
covery of better materials for fuel
cells," Prinz said.
Fuel cells are used to convert the
chemical electricity of hydrogen
and oxygen into electricity, and
have received substantial attention
for their potential to replace tradi
tional combustion engines in auto
mobiles.
The transportation sector alone
accounts for approximately one
third of U.S. carbon dioxide emis
sions, with motor gasoline com
prising two-thirds of the sector's
energy consumption, leading
many to believe that tackling vehi
cle carbon dioxide emissions will
be one of the biggest steps toward
controlling climate change.
"Automobiles, 1 think, are the
really tricky problem because
there's so much infrastructure out
there; certainly in this country we
rely on the freedom that the auto
mobile creates — we don't have
mass transit, we don't have all the
other things that we could have as
viable alternatives to this technolo
gy," said University President John
Hennessy in a February interview
with The Daily. "I think the auto
mobile is going to be the funda
mental problem — that's why I
think we're going to put so much
emphasis on hydrogen as a possi
ble solution."
Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Emeritus Gil Mas
ters, who has called for GCEP to
put a greater focus on end-use effi
ciency and on renewable technolo
gies, vowed "100 percent support"
for research on hydrogen tech
nologies, adding that "the whole
concept of a hydrogen economy is
extremely important."
The consensus on the need to
expand hydrogen research ex
tends far beyond the Farm, as
demonstrated by hydrogen's inte
gral role in the Bush administra
tion's national energy policy.
The administration has re
leased "A National Hydrogen Vi
sion and Roadmap" announcing
that "hydrogen is America's clean
energy choice" and envisioning it
as "flexible, alfordable, safe, do
mestically produced, use in all sec
tors of the economy, and in all re
gions of the country." According to
U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer
Abraham, "A hydrogen economy
will mean a world where our pollu
tion problems are solved and

where our need for abundant and
affordable energy is secure .. . and
where concerns about dwindling
resources are a thing of the past."
The immediate potential hy
drogen technologies have to cut
greenhouse gas emissions also
appears to be one of a very few
scientific and policy points where
GCEP's corporate sponsors are
in agreement. While their re
search efforts, commercial activi
ties and public statements on al
ternative fuels differ substantial
lv, all four GCEP sponsors —
ExxonMobil ($lOO million),
Toyota ($5O million), General
Electric ($5O million) and
Schlumberger ($25 million) —
have acknowledged the impor
tance of hydrogen.
On its Web site, GE describes
"generating, storing and distribut
ing hydrogen as a fuel source
[and] exploring the viability of fuel
cells" as a primary "focus for the
future." ExxonMobil Chairman
and CEO Lee Ravmond has said
that his company is "evaluating the
use of hydrogen as an energy
source," and ExxonMobil has
teamed up with General Motors
and Toyota in an effort indepen
dent from GCEP to advance fuel
cell technology.
Schlumberger, which describes
itself as "a global oilfield and infor
mation services company," may be
the only sponsor not pursuing hy
drogen technologies. However,
while Euan Baird, its chairman
and CEO, has argued for the con
tinued importance of fossil fuels,
he has also publicly stated that con
sumers are moving to "hydrogen
based fuel cell technologies" and
that "this new technology is expect
ed to find particularly important
applications in the transport sector
for improving the quality of life in
large towns."
Despite potential, hydrogen is no
quick fix
Despite the seeming universal
optimism toward hydrogen, how
ever, scientists are quick to point
out it is not a magical solution.
"Unfortunately, hydrogen is an
energy carrier, not an energy
source," Orr said. "You have to
make the hydrogen from some
where."
One of the largest obstacles to
realizing a hydrogen economy that
is completely free of carbon diox
ide and pollutant emissions lies in
the task of hydrogen production,
the bulk of which is currently car
ried out with hydrocarbons and
fossil fiiels. The Department of En
ergy estimates that 95 percent of
hydrogen is produced by steam re
forming of methane, a process that
creates carbon dioxide as a by
product.
Other means of producing hy
drogen, such electrolysis in water,
also indirectly use fossil fuels, since
the electric current that runs
through the water is most often
created by burning coal.

Using hydrogen extracted from
hydrocarbons and fossil fuels in
stead of gasoline for vehicles or
coal for electricity does still sub
stantially reduce emissions, howev
er. Fuel cells can be up to twice as
efficient as combustion technolo
gies, ultimately requiring less fuel
to carry out a task and thus creat
ing fewer emissions.
In its project with CM and Toy
ota, ExxonMobil is working on luel
cells that extract hydrogen from
gasoline, a feature that the compa
nies argue will speed the wide
spread introduction of fuel cells
into the economy by using the al
ready established infrastructure
for distributing gasoline — cir
cumventing another major obsta
cle researchers cite in shifting to a
hydrogen economy: how will this
new fuel be integrated and distrib
uted?
"This is a process that will not
happen overnight — there should
be no illusion," Prinz said. "We
have a huge infrastructure in tradi
tional fossil fuels. This is not going
to go away overnight."
One topic that divides scientists
and policy makers optimistic about
the hydrogen economy is the rela
tionship between the continued
use of fossil fuels and develop
ments in hydrogen technology.
While some hydrogen advocates
tout fuel cells as a promising way to
greatly reduce or completely elim
inate fossil fuel use as quickly as
possible, others hail its potential to
keep fossil fuels relevant while
making them less environmentally
damaging.
ExxonMobil and the Bush ad
ministration's energy vision both
advocate exploring ways to cap
ture and secure carbon before it
reaches the atmosphere to mitigate
the effect of emissions from hydro
carbon and fossil fuel-based hydro
gen production. Bush's energy vi
sion, for example, states, "With the
capture and sequestration of car
bon from fossil fuels, hydrogen is
one path for coal, oil and natural
gas to remain viable energy re
sources, should strong constraints
on carbon emissions be required."
It adds, "Fossil fuels are expec ted
to be America's fuels of choice for
the foreseeable future."
While a primary barrier to the
adoption of hydrogen production
without fossil fuels or hydrocar
bons is the challenge of producing
enough quantity to supply a sizable
portion of energy needs, research
is underway to make such process
es viable.
"The most intriguing [research
prospect] to me is the biological
production of hydrogen," said
Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Weyant, who
along with Management Science
and Engineering Prof. Jim
Sweeney led an integrated assess
ment of technology options for
GCEP to help identify promising
areas of research. "If you could do
that at a large scale, that would be a

significant achievement.
That is precisely what Assoc .
Cavil and Environmental Engi
neering Prof. Alfred Spormann
and Chemical Engineering Prof.
Jim Swart/, hope to do with their
research on producing hydrogen
from cyanobacteria.
On Stanford's Bio-X Web site,
Spormann and Swart/ describe
their research as working to "de
velop a technology for sustain
able, environmentally compatible
production of hydrogen on a
large scale" — accelerating the
transition away front fossil luels
and hydrocarbons. 1 o do so, they
are investigating "the biochemical
and genetic machineries of oxy
genic photosynthesis" — a
process where solar energy breaks
water into "bound" hydrogen and
oxygen. The main thrust of their

project, "the metabolic engineer
ing of cyanobacteria to produce
molecular hydrogen," converts
the bound hydrogen into hydro
gen gas, the type needed for fuel
cells.
Proceeding with caution
GCEP Deputy Director Chris
Edwards, an associate professor of
mechanical engineering, has been
doing hydrogen-related work on
engine efficiency, experimenting
with reducing the temperature of
combustion to minimize energ\
loss. By increasing efficiency, Ed
wards said he has been able to de
velop an engine with 1/200 the ni
trogen oxide emissions of a normal
engine.
While Edwards described hy
drogen as a "wonderful option," he
cautioned that, especially when
