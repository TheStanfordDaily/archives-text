# GCEP turns to hydrogen

Editor's Note: This article is the second
installment of a three-week series exam
ining the Global Climate and Energy
Project's current research efforts and
opportunities for the future.
Since the announcement of the
Global Climate and Energy Project
last November, optimistic re
searchers have focused much of
the $225 million initiative's re
sources on hydrogen — an area of
investigation that has uniquely
been able to gather support from
nearly all camps in the energy de
bate.
From the inception of GCEP, a
broad program fostering collabo
ration between industry and acad
emia with the end goal of creating
energy-related technologies that
reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
participants pointed to hydrogen
as one of the most promising areas
of research.
"There's a lot of talk about hy
drogen," said GCEP Director
Lynn Orr, professor of petroleum
engineering. "The great appeal of
hydrogen is that when you burn it,
what it makes is water."
While hydrogen is not a source
of energy itself, it is an energy car
rier that, when burned, creates
only water, heat and electricity —
not air pollutants or carbon diox
ide, the primary greenhouse gas
that's rapid human-induced in
crease in the atmosphere is cited as

the primary cause of global warm
ing. Additionally, the natural
abundance of hydrogen also ren
ders it a sustainable source of ener
gy, unlike fossil fuels that have lim
ited reserves expected to be ex
hausted within the next century if
current energy use patterns con
tinue. These two qualities have
helped hydrogen establish itself as
the frontrunner in the race to cre
ate an economically viable alterna
tive to fossil fuels.
A unanimous mandate
Hydrogen's potential to serve as
a sustainable, emission-free fuel for
virtually all energy sectors, com
bined with the widespread percep
tion that hydrogen technologies
will be commercially viable more
readily than other alternative en
ergy technologies, has made
GCEP's focus on one of its initial
four areas of research — hydro
gen production and utilization —
relatively uncontroversial.
Researchers involved with
GCEP as well as faculty who have
critiqued some of the project's ini
tiatives are unified by their support
of Stanford working to advance
hydrogen technologies, and plans
are already underway to expand
current research. The first work
shop organized under GCEP was
on hydrogen technologies and at
tracted nearly 200 participants to
Stanford in April. Orr has also said
that hydrogen will be the first
