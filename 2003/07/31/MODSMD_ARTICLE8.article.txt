## Tresidder renovation aims to address student concerns 
### MICHAEL OSOFSKY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Stanford students have been pushing
for years to overhaul Tresidder
Memorial Union, increase student
space and ultimately build a new student
union. Due to restrictions within the Gen
eral Use Permit, development at Stanford
is a very lengthy and tricky process.
Although student leaders across many
of the major student groups have cam
paigned for increased student space and
renovations to Tresidder, with other more
pressing concerns for development,
changes have not been possible.
However, with student space now as
one of the University's top priorities,
major reforms for the future are much
more feasible. In addition, recent shifts in
food service operations will allow Tresid
der to immediately serve as a better stu
dent center.
As an ASSU Senator and the undergrad
uate representative to the Tresidder Advi
sory Board, I've faced several tough deci

sions related to short-term and long-term
goals for Tresidder. From the perspective
of a student, two sets of priorities emerged:
1) renovating Tresidder to make the most
of the existing facilities and 2) laying the
groundwork for the creation of additional
student space and a new student center.
Short-term: When the Class of 2007
arrives on the Farm for New Student Ori
entation, Tresidder will have undergone
one of its most significant changes in food
service operations since opening in 1959.
Announced this spring, Stanford Dining
Services, a division of Residential & Din
ing Enterprises, which controls students'
housing and dining options, will be tak
ing over the operations formerly man
aged by Bon Appetit.
Bon Appetit administered the Coffee
House, the downstairs eatery and the
Corner Pocket, as well as a large chunk of
the catering for departmental and spe
cial events. All other services at Tresid
der will remain the same, including food
options like Tresidder Express, The
Treehouse and Jamba Juice. A renovat-

Ed first floor of 1 residder will be un
veiled this fall.
Stanford Dining will now control al
most all of the food options for Stanford
students. Recent renovations of dated (lin
ing halls at Stern, Wilbur, Lakeside and
Manzanita have been very popular, and
changed the stereotypes many Stanford
students have about dining hall food.
Stanford Dining has inherited a tremen
dous opportunity in Tresidder that Bon
Appetit did not successfully utilize — ef
fectively providing services widely desired
by students.
Stanford Dining has promised that stu
dents will soon be able to use some of their
points and Cardinal Dollars at Tresidder,
an option that has consistently been asked
for by students, but has never been possible
due to the outside contracts at Tresidder.
Precisely how Stanford Dining implements
their new concepts will be immediately as
sessed, evaluated and judged and, if effec
tive, their services will be used by students.
Long-term: In recent years, student
leaders have authored multiple versions

of a proposal fora new student union.
Key administrators, including the Vice-
Provost for Student Affairs, have made
student space a top priority. Student
leaders and administrators have worked
together throughout the last few years,
and understand the pressing need for in
creased student group space.
In addition to finding immediate ways
to ameliorate the shortages, plans are
being worked out for the next capital
campaign to include money earmarked
for student space. Hopefully, money will
also be allocated to support the creation
of a new student union.
In the meantime, we'll have to wait and
see if Stanford Dining can transform
Tresidder into more of a student hub. Al
though the initial launch may not fully cap
ture student attention, hopefully things
will be tweaked so that students will soon
view Tresidder as a place to call their own.
