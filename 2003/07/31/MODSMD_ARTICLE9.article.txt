# PEDANTIC POETICS
## S&T journalists are missing the mystery 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Last week the BBC Science section
featured a new study and its happy
result: a team of top-notch re
searchers found that masturbation may
decrease the incidence of prostate cancer.
Its tone was serious, its undertone was
thankful.
This week, however, BBC correspon
dent Jill McGivering reported a less gen
dered alternative. She has interviewed a
Dr. Banchob, who successfully treats
everything from "cancer to back pain"
with a daily draught of urine. Forgive me
doctor, but I prefer the first opinion.
It isn't just the silly Brits. A week doesn't
go by without some new scientific triumph
being scooped by Time or Newsweek or
USA Today: effortless diets to shrink the
waistline, energy drinks to bestow flight,
magical vegetables to cure lycanthropy
while whitening your smile.
Today, most major publications have a
science and technology staff. The S&T re
porters spend their time indoors, research
ing nouveaux gadgets and speaking with
awkward lab assistants, while other journal
ists screech through city streets in really fast
sports-cars and interview maidens held
captive by dragonesque Enron executives.
There is a certain pecking order
amongst writers. If journalists and flask
engravers are the poor bleeding chickens
at its bottom, S&T reporters are no more
than the half-eaten worms rejected by obit

uaries editors. They are humanities' pari
ahs, turned from their love of words to a
dark worship of the sciences.
Like most evil magicians, they prey on
fear: of cancer, obesity, age, divorce and
menopause. They offer cures. A lazy and il
literate child? It's probably dyslexia, reports
Time magazine. Pump little Johnny full of
meds, and send him to a special school
where he can feel adjusted and snort his at
tention-deficient classmate's focus powder.
An awkward child? It's mild autism. The
cure: electroshock and urine.
Considering its cohort AOL, which
made a business tending massive techno
phobia, Time's shameless pseudoscience
makes more sense. A herd of chumps have
made an idol out of science. Now corporate
America has made a cash cow of their gold
en calf.
However sound today's sophistications
of quantum mechanics and biochemistry
may be, they are no more scrutable to the
average Joe than the mysteries of the Trin
ity were to the average peasant.
Mystery is gorgeous, and - for the sake
of joy, delight and wonder - must be pre
served. It is a humbling and inspirational
experience.
Albert Einstein once wrote: "The fairest
thing we can experience is the mysterious.
It is the fundamental emotion which stands
at the cradle of true art and true science. He
who knows it not and can no longer won
der, no longer feel amazement, is as good as
dead, a snuffed-out candle. It was the expe
rience of mvsterv — even if mixed with

fear — that engendered religion. A knowl
edge of the existence of something we can
not penetrate, of the manifestations of the
profoundest reason and the most radiant
beauty... it is this knowledge and this
emotion that constitute the truly religious
attitude."
Unfortunately, science today has little
to do with mystery.
As a culture, we have exhausted our
sense of wonder, our patience for the un
consummated mystery. It's not a deficit of
attention. It's a deficit of wonder and of
patience — inspiration and craft — the
twin forces of creation. Viagra will not
help.
Meanwhile, the scientists have been
transformed into research assistants, lab

technicians and eunuch engineers. Grants
require patents, and tenure requires pub
lication. In a research community driven
to make aggressive claims, there is no
room for musing children who ask irrev
erent questions and deconstruct their dad
dies' pocket watches. They sit unem
ployed, alone, reading Heisenberg's and
Godel's diaries, toying with disassembled
gears and mumbling jagged heresies.
They too require electroshock and urine.
Observed from the inside, the scientific
community has been warped by its own
authority. It has ceased to be creative; it
has lost its founding spirit of hypothesis,
experiment and error. From the outside,

however, the teeming complexity
still glimmers like a mystery.
As long as science remains
mysterious and mystery remains
a source of captivating power,

AOL will continue to gouge the
common man and low-carb diets
to break the hearts of desperate
women.
Time's cover story for this week
is meditation. Its cover shows a
cross-legged young woman in a
plain, loosely-fitting sundress.
She's basking in a bright sun of a
computer generated desert and

appears to be wearing a wig and
entirely too much lip-gloss. Her
closed eyes, slack face, and the in
wardly creeping hem of that plain
sundress make her look at once
prone and peaceful. It's an attrac
tive cover. Inside they reassure the
reader that meditation may lead to
better health. They also leave the
option open that it may not.

It isn't that homeopathic cures
or Vedic rites are bullshit. It's only
aggravating that a) Time chooses
to educate its readers about medi
tation rather than publicizing one
of a hundred other far more
pressing issues (mutiny in the
Philippines; reconstruction in
Afghanistan; the personal threats,
police interventions and utter

bedlam in Congress) and b) that
hobbies now require validation by
t he FDA before t hey earn t he priv
ilege of popular consumption.

llya Beylin us mildly crazy, however, he
refuses to take medications as should
you. This column is his therapy. If you
would write to him at ibeylin@stan
ford.edu, it would be sweet as candy.

Time's cover story for this week
is meditation. Its cover shows a
cross-legged young woman in a
plain, loosely-fitting sundress.
She's basking in a bright sun of a
computer generated desert and

appears to be wearing a wig and
entirely too much lip-gloss. Her
closed eyes, slack face, and the in
wardly creeping hem of that plain
sundress make her look at once
prone and peaceful. It's an attrac
tive cover. Inside they reassure the
reader that meditation may lead to
better health. They also leave the
option open that it may not.

It isn't that homeopathic cures
or Vedic rites are bullshit. It's only
aggravating that a) Time chooses
to educate its readers about medi
tation rather than publicizing one
of a hundred other far more
pressing issues (mutiny in the
Philippines; reconstruction in
Afghanistan; the personal threats,
police interventions and utter

bedlam in Congress) and b) that
hobbies now require validation by
t he FDA before t hey earn t he priv
ilege of popular consumption.

llya Beylin us mildly crazy, however, he
refuses to take medications as should
you. This column is his therapy. If you

Last week the BBC Science section
featured a new study and its happy
result: a team of top-notch re
searchers found that masturbation may
decrease the incidence of prostate cancer.
Its tone was serious, its undertone was
thankful.
This week, however, BBC correspon
dent Jill McGivering reported a less gen
dered alternative. She has interviewed a
Dr. Banchob, who successfully treats
everything from "cancer to back pain"
with a daily draught of urine. Forgive me
doctor, but I prefer the first opinion.
It isn't just the silly Brits. A week doesn't
go by without some new scientific triumph
being scooped by Time or Newsweek or
USA Today: effortless diets to shrink the
waistline, energy drinks to bestow flight,
magical vegetables to cure lycanthropy
while whitening your smile.
Today, most major publications have a
science and technology staff. The S&T re
porters spend their time indoors, research
ing nouveaux gadgets and speaking with
awkward lab assistants, while other journal
ists screech through city streets in really fast
sports-cars and interview maidens held
captive by dragonesque Enron executives.
There is a certain pecking order
amongst writers. If journalists and flask
engravers are the poor bleeding chickens
at its bottom, S&T reporters are no more
than the half-eaten worms rejected by obit

uaries editors. They are humanities' pari
ahs, turned from their love of words to a
dark worship of the sciences.
Like most evil magicians, they prey on
fear: of cancer, obesity, age, divorce and
menopause. They offer cures. A lazy and il
literate child? It's probably dyslexia, reports
Time magazine. Pump little Johnny full of
meds, and send him to a special school
where he can feel adjusted and snort his at
tention-deficient classmate's focus powder.
An awkward child? It's mild autism. The
cure: electroshock and urine.
Considering its cohort AOL, which
made a business tending massive techno
phobia, Time's shameless pseudoscience
makes more sense. A herd of chumps have
made an idol out of science. Now corporate
America has made a cash cow of their gold
en calf.
However sound today's sophistications
of quantum mechanics and biochemistry
may be, they are no more scrutable to the
average Joe than the mysteries of the Trin
ity were to the average peasant.
Mystery is gorgeous, and - for the sake
of joy, delight and wonder - must be pre
served. It is a humbling and inspirational
experience.
Albert Einstein once wrote: "The fairest
thing we can experience is the mysterious.
It is the fundamental emotion which stands
at the cradle of true art and true science. He
who knows it not and can no longer won
der, no longer feel amazement, is as good as
dead, a snuffed-out candle. It was the expe
rience of mvsterv — even if mixed with

fear — that engendered religion. A knowl
edge of the existence of something we can
not penetrate, of the manifestations of the
profoundest reason and the most radiant
beauty... it is this knowledge and this
emotion that constitute the truly religious
attitude."
Unfortunately, science today has little
to do with mystery.
As a culture, we have exhausted our
sense of wonder, our patience for the un
consummated mystery. It's not a deficit of
attention. It's a deficit of wonder and of
patience — inspiration and craft — the
twin forces of creation. Viagra will not
help.
