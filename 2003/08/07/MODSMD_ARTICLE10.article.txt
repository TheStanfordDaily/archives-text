# Stanford not a participating '568' member
## Univ. already limits house assets in aid 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
A New York Times article last week incorrectly
identified Stanford as a participating member of
the "568 Group" — named after the section of an
antitrust law that allows universities to work to es
tablish common financial aid standards, but not to
share specific awards offered to individual stu
dents — which recently changed its policy on how
home equity will be treated in financial aid calcula
tions. However, while Stanford is not a participat
ing 568 member, its preexisting policy toward ac
counting for house values is relatively similar to
the new standards adopted by the 568 Group.
"We have agreed to attend 568 meetings, partic
ipate in 568-related or -sponsored seminars, and
have certainly paid attention to this financial aid
model," said Earl Dowling, associate dean and di
rector of financial aid. "However, in our communi
cations with the 568 Group, we made it clear that we
should not be listed as we were in the Times article
as a 568-participating institution."
Dowling explained that Stanford has been "using
not all, but some of the practices" set forth by the
568 Group. Since the University is not a participat
ing institution, it is not required to implement any
policies decided upon by 568 members.
"It leaves Stanford in the enviable position of
awarding financial aid based on unique characteris
tics of our student population," he said. "It allows us
to treat our students in a way that we believe is fair.
Like any other college or university, we have set
rules in awarding federal and state dollars and we
comply with those rules.
"Instead of agreeing to follow the principles laid
out by a group, we believe in our students' best in
terest that we should continue to study the 568
model," Dowling continued, "but for the present,
administer financial aid in a way we believe to be
consistent, fair and equitable."
The new policy adopted by the 568 Group
changes how families' houses are factored into fi
nancial aid decisions. As stated by the Times, before
houses were treated similar to more liquid assets
such as stocks, which can relatively easily be con
verted into cash to pay for tuition costs. Now, fami
lies are only required to pay as much as 5 percent of
their equity in tuition, with the equity capped at 2.4
times a families' collective income, whereas previ
ously a home's total market value could be utilized.
This is expected to particularly help middle-class
families that have high-value homes but few assets
in other areas.
While not employing the exact same numbers as
the 568 members, Dowling stated that the spirit of
Stanford's current financial aid system already ac
commodates this view of homes and families' abili
ties to pay education costs.
"Conceptually we are doing the same thing, we
differ in the math," he said. "We don't differ in the
concept."
Dowling expressed no indication that Stanford
plans to change its relationship with the 568 Group
any time soon.
"If we believe that this model meets our needs,
both in terms of financial aid deliver)' and fiscally,
then we'll give it more thought," he said. "I think
we're in a great position. We follow the proceedings
very closely, and yet, we're not locked into groups'
guidelines."
