LOS ANGELES (AP) — Arnold Schwarzenegger ended
the suspense yesterday and jumped into the recall race to
replace Gov. Gray Davis. Hours later, Lt. Governor Gruz
Bustamante broke ranks with other prominent Democ
rats who vowed to stay off the ballot, saying he would pick
up candidacy papers the following day.
Bustamante's late announcement capped a day of one
upsmanship and fast-paced developments in one of the
most unpredictable political races in recent history.
Earlier, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein had ruled
out a run, labeling the election "more and more like a car
nival every day." And political commentator Arianna
Huffington declared she would run as an independent.
But it was the announcement by Schwarzenegger, a
moderate Republican and the star of the " Terminator
movies, that may have come as the biggest surprise.
Schwarzenegger, 56, announced his decision during a
taping of "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," calling it the
toughest he's made since deciding to get a bikini wax in
1978.
"The politicians are fiddling, fumbling and failing," he
said. "The man that is failing the people more than any
one is Gray Davis."
Schwarzenegger's advisers had said in recent days that
he was leaning against putting his name on the Oct. 7 elec
tion ballot because of opposition from his wife, journalist
Maria Shriver.
Schwarzenegger told Leno that he's not afraid of Davis
allies attacking him as "a womanizer" or "a terrible per
son." "I know that they're going to throw everything at
me," he said.
Davis' campaign committee responded by saying
Schwarzenegger was merely the latest in a long list of peo
ple who have declared their intent to run, noting that
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt is among them.
"The more candidates who join, the greater the likeli
hood that a small minority of voters will be controlling
California's future," read a statement from Californians
Against the Costly Recall, which was speaking for the gov
ernor.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, another
moderate Republican, has said he would enter the race if
Schwarzenegger did not, and polls have shown Riordan
would be a stronger candidate than the actor. Riordan
had been assembling a campaign team on the assumption
Schwarzenegger was out; his spokeswoman, Lisa Wolf,
said yesterday that he had no immediate comment.
Schwarzenegger said he made the decision over the last

few days and kept it a secret from everyone — even his
own advisers said they didn't expect it.
Even Schwarzenegger's appearance on "The Tonight
Show" was tinged with suspense.
"Well, Jay, after thinking fora long time my decision
is . . "he began to tell Leno before the TV screen showed
a "Please Stand By" sign. When the picture finally re
turned, he said: "That's why I decided that way."
When the actor finally confirmed he was running,
"The Tonight Show" audience in Burbank erupted in
whoops and cheers.
Later yesterday night, Bustamante, the first Hispanic
to hold statewide office in California in more than a cen
tury, said in a faxed statement that he planned to pick up
candidacy papers this morning in Sacramento.
As late as Tuesday, he had said he would stay off the
ballot, follwing the lead of several prominent Democrats.
Bustamante's aides declined to elaborate on his an
nouncement late last night. A spokesman for Davis also
declined to comment on the development.
The Davis camp, fearing that other Democratic candi
dates would give Democratic-leaning voters an excuse to
pass the recall, has pressed to keep prominent party mem
bers from running.
Before Bustamante's announcement, Feinstein's deci
sion not to run appeared to give a boost to Davis.
"After thinking a great deal about {his recall, its impli
cations for the future, and its misguided nature, I have de
cided that I will not place my name on the ballot," Fein
stein said in a statement.
All candidates have until a Saturday deadline to declare
their intentions.
The recall election is yet another setback for Davis, who
has seen his popularity plummet as the state grapples with
a record $38 billion budget deficit. Davis is the first Cali
fornia governor to face a recall and would be only the sec
ond governor nationwide to be removed from office if the
effort succeeds.
Prior to Bustamante's announcement. Democratic
support for Davis appeared to be weakening, as some
party members grumbled at the possibility of not having a
choice among Democrats.
"I want to back the strongest candidate and it's impor
tant that we coalesce around one, and now I'm appealing
to the leaders... to figure out who our strongest candidate
is and lead us in coalescing behind that candidate," said
Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who had supported a Fein
stein candidacy.
