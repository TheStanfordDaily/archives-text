## Only 20 Marines to enter Liberia 
### 
CRAWFORD, Texas (AP) â€” U.S. troops are in Liberia
only to provide logistical and communications assistance,
and to help the West Africans plan their peacekeeping, ad
ministration officials saw They will likely not number
more than 20.
A team of seven U.S. Marines landed in Monrovia yes
terday, flving in on olive-green helicopters from a three
ship Navy group carrying 2,000 Marines off the Liberian
coast.
The Marines are to coordinate U.S. logistical support
fora peacekeeping force of West African soldiers based at
the airport 30 miles from the capital.
President Bush's decision came after weeks of delibera
tion keyed to seeking a commitment from West African
governments to help in Liberia. It was "all part of doing
what is necessary" to assist in relief operations, Bush said
at his Texas ranch.
Bush has said West Africans and the United Nations
must take the lead. He wants American involvement to be
limited to helping bring in supplies for the peacekeepers
and humanitarian aid for Liberians.
Officials in Washington insisted the seven Marines would
not be a vanguard of a much larger presence. While an ad
ditional dozen or so could be added to the team, no decision
has been made to send anything beyond 20 people.
At an airport hangar, Americans and Nigerians stood sur
rounded by duffel bags and Nigerian armored personnel
carriers, trucks and fuel tankers, conferring and taking
notes.
"There are certain things we cannot provide you with,"
one American could be heard telling his Nigerian coun
terparts.
Bush said that no larger American force will go ashore
until warlord-turned-president Charles Taylor leaves the
countrv.
