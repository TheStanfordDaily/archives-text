JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian
police analyzed blood and I)NA samples
today Irom unidentified body parts found
inside the van that blew up outside Jakar
ta s Marriott Hotel and a forensic chief said
it was still unclear whether it was a suicide
attack.
Officials said evidence at the scene
showed that the bomb was detonated by a
mobile phone — the same method alleged
ly used by the terror group Jemaah Is
lamiyah in hist year's Bali bombings.
In Jakarta, Brig. Gen. Dudon, the chief
forensics specialist, said vital clues in the
Marriott attack may have been washed
away when firefighters used water to put
out the blaze.
"Our work has been hampered by the
fire brigade who tried to put out the fire,
and also by the sprinkler system," he saitl.
Dudon said it was still not possible to de
termine whether the attack had been carried
out by a suicide bomber. Several Indonesian
officials had earlier said it may have been.
National police spokesman Lt. Col. Zain
uri Lubis denied a media report that offi
cers already knew the identity of the man
believed to have been driving the vehicle
that blew up Tuesday outside the Marriott
Hotel in downtown Jakarta.
Investigators said they were using video
evidence taken from the hotel's security
cameras to see if they could help identify
the driver of the vehicle.
At least 10 people were killed and 150 in
jured in the attack. In the confused after
math, the Indonesian Red Cross put the
death toll at 14.
"I can only confirm that we are trying to
analyze DNA and blood samples found in
side the vehicle," he said.

Yesterday, police released a composite
sketch of a man who may have been behind
the wheel.
Suspicion is strengthening that Jemaah
Islamiyah, the al-Qaida linked group
blamed for last year's Bali bombings, was
also behind the Marriott attack.
A verdict in the trial of Amrozi bin
Nurhasyim, a key suspect in the Bali night
club bombings that killed 202 people, most
ly foreign tourists, was expected later
today. He grinned and yelled "Bomb!"
when asked about the Marriott attack dur
ing a peer's trial in Bali.
The blast was a bloody reminder of the
threat of terror in the world's most populous
Muslim nation, which had won plaudits for
its investigation into the Bali bombings.
Maj. Gen. Made Pastika, who led the Bali
investigation, said today that in both cases
attackers used mobile phones to detonate
car bombs. Also like the perpetrators of the
Bali bombers, the Marriott attackers used
both TNT and RDX explosives, he said.
In addition, police said the bombers in
both cases sanded down the chassis num
bers on their respective vehicles in an at
tempt to shield their identities.
" rhe threat is still there and we have to
increase our security," Pastika told re
porters in Bali.
Both Australia and Indonesian have
warned of more terrorist attacks, saying the
trials of Jemaah Islamiyah members were
reason enough for Muslim extremists to
lash out.
A U.S. official in Washington said on
condition of anonymity that the hotel blast
had the hallmarks of previous attacks by
Jemaah Islamiyah, whose alleged goal is to
set ii}) a pan-Islamic state in Southeast Asia.
