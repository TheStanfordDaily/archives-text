# Church tackles same-sex issues
## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — As anguished
conservatives protested the confirma
tion of the first openly gay Episcopal
bishop, church leaders weary of debat
ing homosexuality are tackling yet an
other divisive issue: blessing cere
monies for same-sex couples.
The House of Bishops, composed of
bishops from around the country,
voted yesterday to reject a proposal to
draft an official liturgy for the cere
monies — which are already per
formed in some parishes.
But by voice vote, they overwhelm
ingly approved a document saying:
"We recognize that local faith commu
nities are operating within the bounds
of our common life as they explore and
experience liturgies celebrating and
blessing same-sex unions."
There was disagreement over the
significance of the statement, which
needs final approval from the clergy
and laity in the House of Deputies. A
vote could come as soon as today.
Bishops already decide whether to
permit same-sex blessing ceremonies
in their own dioceses.
But the Episcopal gay advocacy
groups Claiming the Blessing and In
tegrity said that, if approved, the mea
sure would be the first time the church
acknowledged in a national document
that such ceremonies are held.
Bishop Robert Ilhoff of Maryland
said the statement had little practical
effect: "It continues the policy that is in
effect in all our dioceses."
Ilhoff said he understood why gay

advocates would consider it a victory,
because it brings the practice "to the
surface."
Bishop Keitli Ackerman of Quincy,
111., called it "recognition without ap
proval" that allows bishops to continue
to set local policy.
Three bishops —in Kansas, New
Hampshire and Delaware — authorize
same-sex blessings, according to the
Rev. Michael Hopkins, president of In
tegrity. Other dioceses bar them, while
some bishops have a "don't ask, don't
tell" approach, overlooking the cere
monies priests perform.
Gay advocates had hoped that con
firmation of the Rev. V. Gene Robin
son at this week's General Convention
would build momentum toward ap
proval for an official ceremony.
Robinson, a 56-year-old divorced la
ther of two, has lived with his male
partner for 13 years. He was confirmed
Tuesday after he was cleared of last
minute misconduct allegations that
threatened to delay the vote.
In the bishops' vote on same-sex cer
emonies, Utah Bishop Otis Charles,
who revealed he was gay in 1993 after
he retired, spoke of how he felt "di
minished" during years of church de
bate over homosexuality.
"You cannot understand the expe
rience that it is for every gay and les
bian member of the Episcopal Church
when this house debates whether or
not our relationships can be acknowl
edged, honored and celebrated,"
Charles said.
