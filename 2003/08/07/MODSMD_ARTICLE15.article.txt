## President Bush must send troops to restore peace in Liberia 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Liberian President Charles Taylor
has agreed that Monday will be his
last day in office. This is welcome
news.
Indicted by a U.N. war crimes tri
bunal for selling weapons to rebel
forces in Sierra Leone in exchange for
conflict diamonds, Taylor must live up
to his promise to relinquish his office.
Once Taylor — a man who rose to
power through violence and murder —
steps down from the presidency, he
must leave Liberia in order to ensure a
peaceful transition to democracy.
As 3,000 peacekeepers from the 16-
member Economic Community of West
African States began to arrive at the air
port in Monrovia on Tuesday, U.S. Pres
ident George W. Bush approved the de
ployment of six to 10 U.S. soldiers to
Liberia.
Though the deployment of the West
African peacekeepers and the U.S. team
represents hope for many Liberians, the
presence of such a small contingent from
the United States weakens the mission

and indicates that the conflict in Liberia is
far from over.
Charles Taylor's history of reneging
on his promises to step down and
ECOWAS's less-than-sterling record
for keeping the peace are disquieting.
The last time a West African peace
keeping force intervened in Liberia,
the Liberian president was murdered,
order broke down, peacekeepers loot
ed in the streets and warlords fought
each other for control of the country.
A significant commitment of peace
keeping troops on the part of the United
States would send a strong message in
favor of Taylor's peaceful and immediate
departure, and would ensure a smoother
transition to democracy in Liberia.
It is understandable that the U.S. gov
ernment would be reluctant to step into
an internal African conflict after the So
malia debacle of the early 19905. But the
Bush administration — so willing to in
tervene in Iraq — is making a grave error
in not stepping up and committing
troops to Liberia.
The Liberian conflict has a complex
history. Deployment of U.S. troops
cannot solve all of the underlying

problems that face this country afflict
ed by poverty, illiteracy and long
standing tension between natives and
the descendants of American slaves.
But an intervention is necessary to ex
pedite Taylor's departure, to put an
end to the civil war that is tearing
Liberia apart and to plant the seeds of
an enduring democracy in this African
nation.
For there to be any hope that a mad
man like Prince Johnson — most mem
orable for video footage of him swilling
beer while ordering the torture of for
mer Liberian President Samuel Doe —
won't seize control of the country, the
United States must intervene with a
tangible, visible troop presence in
Liberia. The clout, and the muscle, of
the United States needs to be behind
the next peacekeeping team so that we
don't find ourselves watching a ghastly
rerun of the early 19905.
President Bush's father had a
chance to end the bloodshed in Liberia
more than a decade ago when he sent
an amphibious task force to the African
coast to monitor the developing con
flict. How manv more Liberians need

to die before the international commu
nity takes real action and the United
States intervenes?
Liberia is tired of war. The rebels
want to lay down their arms, as they
proved on July 29 with their promises
of a cease-fire. To ensure a lasting
peace, Charles Taylor must leave
Liberia, and a strong and enduring
democracy must be formed to take tht*
place of the long parade of dictators
and warlords who have run this coun
try like a sick — and deadly — game of
"Monopoly" for the past 23 years.
It is time for effective and significant
U.S. intervention in Liberia. Although
the West African peacekeepers have
begun to arrive, people continue to die.
Can we look the descendants of Ameri
cans who were exploited by slavery in the
eye and tell them that there is nothing
more we can do?
