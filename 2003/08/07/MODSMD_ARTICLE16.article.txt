## GOP faces ideological fissure 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
It's about time that 9/11 wore
itself out as a topic of political
conversation and that the
American media and people re
focus their attention on America.
Despite the insistence by the
New York Times and company,
the war in Iraq is long over; for
the month of July, American ca
sualty rates in Iraq were only
slightly higher than in East Palo
Alto.
With the new year approach
ing, and the lowa primary sched
uled for Jan. 19, the candidates
vying for nomination are well on
their way to defining the issues
that will be decided in the 2004
election.
Historically, the pre-primary
period generates a rich political
discourse both within and be
tween parties. During the period,
candidates position themselves
on the otherwise ambiguously
broad political spectrums strad
dled by the two major parties. It's
an exciting time for political
strategists, demagogues and
thinkers.
However much the GOP

may be united behind nominat
ing George Bush, the pre-pri
mary Republican debate shows
signs of ideological fissure
within the party.
For the last 50 years, the GOP
suppressed its internal contradic
tion. Eisenhower skillfully com
bined the libertarian and isola
tionist past of the party with an
increasingly socially conservative
and interventionist policy.
Now that the Soviet threat is
gone, the huddled coalition must
emerge from its dark bunker.
Those who still hide, terrified
anew by 9/11, are intellectually ir
responsible. Republicans must
see each others' faces, recognize
they are not brothers, and per
haps go off in separate directions.
January could be the month of
recognition.
Ethical issues — abortion,
capital punishment, school
prayer — usually prompt the
loudest campaign quarrels.
Often, these divide the two par
ties as much on the inside as from
each other; there are plenty of
pro-choice republicans and guil
lotine democrats.
This year, homosexuality will
be a powerfully divisive issue.

During his Wake Forrest de
bate with then-Vice President Al
Gore, George Bush articulated
his position on gay marriage, al
luding to the 1996 act signed into
law by Bill Clinton:
"I think marriage is a sacred
institution between a man and a
woman. I appreciated the way

the administration signed the De
fense of Marriage Act."
I he act, for federal and inter
state purposes, defined marriage
as a legal union between one
man and one woman." Last
month, Bush reaffirmed his
stance exciting controversy, dis
gust and vehement approval.

Since July 3, Bush has pushed
the issue into the center of pie
primary politics. Most recently
and famously, when asked about
his opinion on gay marriage at a
news conference, he responded
that "we're all sinners."
