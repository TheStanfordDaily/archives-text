## GOP faces ideological fissure 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
It's about time that 9/11 wore
itself out as a topic of political
conversation and that the
American media and people re
focus their attention on America.
Despite the insistence by the
New York Times and company,
the war in Iraq is long over; for
the month of July, American ca
sualty rates in Iraq were only
slightly higher than in East Palo
Alto.
With the new year approach
ing, and the lowa primary sched
uled for Jan. 19, the candidates
vying for nomination are well on
their way to defining the issues
that will be decided in the 2004
election.
Historically, the pre-primary
period generates a rich political
discourse both within and be
tween parties. During the period,
candidates position themselves
on the otherwise ambiguously
broad political spectrums strad
dled by the two major parties. It's
an exciting time for political
strategists, demagogues and
thinkers.
However much the GOP

may be united behind nominat
ing George Bush, the pre-pri
mary Republican debate shows
signs of ideological fissure
within the party.
For the last 50 years, the GOP
suppressed its internal contradic
tion. Eisenhower skillfully com
bined the libertarian and isola
tionist past of the party with an
increasingly socially conservative
and interventionist policy.
Now that the Soviet threat is
gone, the huddled coalition must
emerge from its dark bunker.
Those who still hide, terrified
anew by 9/11, are intellectually ir
responsible. Republicans must
see each others' faces, recognize
they are not brothers, and per
haps go off in separate directions.
January could be the month of
recognition.
Ethical issues — abortion,
capital punishment, school
prayer — usually prompt the
loudest campaign quarrels.
Often, these divide the two par
ties as much on the inside as from
each other; there are plenty of
pro-choice republicans and guil
lotine democrats.
This year, homosexuality will
be a powerfully divisive issue.

During his Wake Forrest de
bate with then-Vice President Al
Gore, George Bush articulated
his position on gay marriage, al
luding to the 1996 act signed into
law by Bill Clinton:
"I think marriage is a sacred
institution between a man and a
woman. I appreciated the way

the administration signed the De
fense of Marriage Act."
I he act, for federal and inter
state purposes, defined marriage
as a legal union between one
man and one woman." Last
month, Bush reaffirmed his
stance exciting controversy, dis
gust and vehement approval.

Since July 3, Bush has pushed
the issue into the center of pie
primary politics. Most recently
and famously, when asked about
his opinion on gay marriage at a
news conference, he responded
that "we're all sinners."

His enigmatic condemnation
puzzled the pundits: did he mean
that it's sinful to he gay or was it
an allusion to the humbling "let
him who is without sin cast the
first stone?" While most conclud
ed that it was a clever way of play
ing both to the morally righteous
and the libertarian right, few
have yet grasped the emerging
pattern of gay-baiting election
eering. Or maybe, like so many
timid presidential hopefuls,
media companies would rather
skirt a subject that might alienate
so many citizens, voters and sub
scribers.
Bush's statement on J uly 3 fol
lowed three events that hap
pened earlier in June: 1) the
Canada Supreme Court's ruling
that legitimized same-sex mar
riage; 2) the Texas Supreme
Court ruling that the state's
bigamy laws were unconstitution
al because they compromised de
fendants' rights to privacy and 3)
Democratic candidate's Howard
Dean's accusations that the ad
ministration tricked America into
an unwise war.
Howard Dean is the leftmost
of tfie major contenders for the
2004 Democratic nomination.
He also happened to be governor

of Vermont in April of 2000,
when that state became the first
in America to recognize single
sex unions.
Making the statements, Bush
forced Dean and fellows to either
disagree and adopt an unpopu
lar stance or demure and risk los
ing voters to an actually liberal
third party candidate. So far, De
mocrats have demurred, avoid
ing the politically poisonous bait.
Bush's strategy, however, is
riskier than he may realize. Be
sides alienating the insignificant
Log Cabin Republicans, it threat
ens a repeat of the 1996 election
when pro-choice Republicans
voted pro-choice rather than Re
publican and Bush Sr. lost the
election.
Fiscally conservative Republi
cans who wish to minimize gov
ernment intervention in the pri
vate sphere have long battled so
cially conservative Republicans
praying to extend it. The debate
over gay marriage can only speed
this conflict's resolution.
There's evidence of friction at
all levels of the party. Most
prominently, between Bush and
Dick Cheney, whose own daugh
ter is gay. Cheney has openly
supported the freedom of adults
"to enter into any kind of rela
tionships they want," and stated
that civil union legislation should
be left to the states.
While gay-baiting may be a win

ning short-term tactic, it isn't wise
for the long term. Besides aggra
vating splits in the Republican
Party, it utterly ignores the realities
of social change and its direction.
Social conservatives maintain
that society has been based on the
family for thousands of years;
that biologically, only heterosex
ual couples are capable of creat
ing a child; that culture survived
and developed because parents
passed it on to children. They are

right, except they're missing the
last 100 years.
Now public education plays a
significant role in children's ac
culturation. Now the nation's fos
ter care places over one hundred
thousand homeless children into
adopted homes every year. It's
understandable that alternatives
to something as seemingly funda
mental as family should inspire a
backlash of outrage.
The sentimental romanticiz

ing of the traditional family, how
ever, ignores its sad reality today.
If gay marriage or adoption of
children by gay couples is diag
nosed "unhealthy" for society,
the same restrictions must extend
to millions of heterosexual cou
ples equally unable to sustain
"normal" relationships or prop
erly raise children.
