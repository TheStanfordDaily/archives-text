# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Like choosing like: Tenure system skews and stifles politics on campus 
### ANDY CLAVIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
It is commonly accepted that most
American universities are dominated
by the Left, but it is not emphasized
enough how intolerant the Left is against
those with differing views.
For starters, the system of tenure has be
come a corrupt practice. The senior faculty
members decide who is to be tenured, and
they almost always pick only those profes
sors who share their own political beliefs.
Once tenured, a professor is virtually
guaranteed never to lose his job, so he can
get away with all sorts of abuses of students
who disagree with him politically. This sort
of abuse happens all the time. Here are
some examples, just at Stanford:
1. Several professors canceled classes in
early March for the "Books Not Bombs"
protest against war in Iraq. They violated
University policy countless times by de
faming the Main Quad with anti-war and
anti-U.S. propaganda, unlawfully using
loud speakers, disturbing Memorial
Church goers on Ash Wednesday and
breaching the University's contract with
students by canceling class.
Do these professors care about their
students who hoped to attend class that
day, or those students who may not be
anti-war? Obviouslv not.

2. Dozens of war in Iraq teach-ins have
been offered by countless professors, with
out a single one presenting an opposing
viewpoint to the anti-war movement.
Many of these teach-ins have even been
funded by the Office of the Provost, which
is supposedly a neutral academic organi
zation.
3. Personally, I've been told by Professor
David Palumbo-Liu to "shut up," and by
Professor Joel Beinin that "I'm not worth
his time," after I challenged Beinin to a de
bate at a teach-in.
I was very polite and asked Beinin if we
could talk privately in his office, but he and
his fellow panelists were very rude to me
and forced me to leave the teach-in. I was
excluded because I challenged their beliefs,
something left-wing professors hate. I hey
work very hard to insulate themselves from
criticism by becoming tenured professors in
liberally biased schools.
4. Left-wing faculty and students
protested the University's ties to the
Hoover Institution in the spring. As if 90
percent of the Stanford faculty being De
mocrats is not enough, the Left is still intol
erant of any other voice emanating from
Stanford.
Ironically, most of the Hoover fellows do
not teach classes at Stanford, particularly to
undergraduates, so their influence on stu
dents is quite limited. Regardless, the Stan

ford Left remains intolerant of Hoover's
existence.
5. Conservative guest speakers are
shunned and discouraged from speaking at
Stanford, and thus seldom come here. Yet
many students do appreciate their rare
voices, as the Stanford Daily reported after
a May 9 speech by conservative radio host,
Dennis Prager:
"He challenged many of the thoughts so
frequently voiced at Stanford,"junior Megan
Richer said.
"At Stanford we're never exposed to
speakers like this," commented junior Ben
Savage, a well-known actor. "His views and
people who share his views are drowned
out on college campuses."
Senior Jake Gardener added, "I came in
here very critical and very skeptical, but I
agree with the underlying themes he was
talking about. Maybe he takes them to an
extreme, but in the end a lot of what he said
resonated with me."
These students were thrilled to hear
Prager, someone as bright as a Stanford
professor, actually challenge the views that
many professors hold here. This was a very
rare occurrence.
But it shouldn't be.
Stanford is a wonderful place that I feel
exceptionally blessed to attend, but I am
disheartened by its lack of ideological di
versity. I wish Stanford's openness for po

litical diversity was as great as its tolerance
for racial and cultural diversity, but it's not.
I believe that as a place of learning, a uni
versity should be a free marketplace of
ideas, representing all ends of the political
spectrum. It should not be biased towards
one end or the other. It's unfair for the Left
to dominate.
As political commentator David
Horowitz says, "You can't get a good edu
cation, if they're only telling you half the
story — even if you're paying $30,0()0-plus
a year."
Intolerance is the ultimate cowardice
because it displays hostility to criticism and
challenge. Rather than face intellectual
challenge or debate, most professors, par
ticularly those in the social sciences, would
rather preach only to the choir. They
speak at left-wing rallies, offer lectures and
seminars with one-sided reading material
and write political diatribes in left-wing
journals and other publications.
Yet if professors were really convinced
that their way of thinking is correct, then
they should be open to debate to disprove
their opponents. But instead, they hide be
hind the tenure system. In many students'
eyes, they lose credibility for doing this.

3. Personally, I've been told by Professor
David Palumbo-Liu to "shut up," and by
Professor Joel Beinin that "I'm not worth
his time," after I challenged Beinin to a de
bate at a teach-in.
I was very polite and asked Beinin if we
could talk privately in his office, but he and
his fellow panelists were very rude to me
and forced me to leave the teach-in. I was
excluded because I challenged their beliefs,
something left-wing professors hate. I hey
work very hard to insulate themselves from
criticism by becoming tenured professors in
liberally biased schools.
4. Left-wing faculty and students
protested the University's ties to the
Hoover Institution in the spring. As if 90
percent of the Stanford faculty being De
mocrats is not enough, the Left is still intol
erant of any other voice emanating from
Stanford.
Ironically, most of the Hoover fellows do
not teach classes at Stanford, particularly to
undergraduates, so their influence on stu
dents is quite limited. Regardless, the Stan

ford Left remains intolerant of Hoover's
existence.
5. Conservative guest speakers are
shunned and discouraged from speaking at
Stanford, and thus seldom come here. Yet
many students do appreciate their rare
voices, as the Stanford Daily reported after
a May 9 speech by conservative radio host,
Dennis Prager:
"He challenged many of the thoughts so
frequently voiced at Stanford,"junior Megan
Richer said.
"At Stanford we're never exposed to
speakers like this," commented junior Ben
Savage, a well-known actor. "His views and
people who share his views are drowned
out on college campuses."
Senior Jake Gardener added, "I came in
here very critical and very skeptical, but I
agree with the underlying themes he was
talking about. Maybe he takes them to an
extreme, but in the end a lot of what he said
resonated with me."
These students were thrilled to hear
Prager, someone as bright as a Stanford
professor, actually challenge the views that
many professors hold here. This was a very
rare occurrence.
But it shouldn't be.
Stanford is a wonderful place that I feel
exceptionally blessed to attend, but I am
disheartened by its lack of ideological di
versity. I wish Stanford's openness for po

litical diversity was as great as its tolerance
for racial and cultural diversity, but it's not.
I believe that as a place of learning, a uni
versity should be a free marketplace of
ideas, representing all ends of the political
spectrum. It should not be biased towards
one end or the other. It's unfair for the Left
to dominate.
As political commentator David
Horowitz says, "You can't get a good edu
cation, if they're only telling you half the
story — even if you're paying $30,0()0-plus
a year."
Intolerance is the ultimate cowardice
because it displays hostility to criticism and
challenge. Rather than face intellectual
challenge or debate, most professors, par
ticularly those in the social sciences, would
rather preach only to the choir. They
speak at left-wing rallies, offer lectures and
seminars with one-sided reading material
and write political diatribes in left-wing
journals and other publications.
Yet if professors were really convinced
that their way of thinking is correct, then
they should be open to debate to disprove
their opponents. But instead, they hide be
hind the tenure system. In many students'
eyes, they lose credibility for doing this.
