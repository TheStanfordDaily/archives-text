## Card gymnasts reach international success 
### RICO ANDRADE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics is back on
the world radar after David Durante ('O2)
won tlje silver medal in the all-around at
the Pan American Games in the Domini
can Republic this week. The Stanford
heavy U.S. squad, which also included ju
nior Dan Gill and incoming freshman Sho
Nakamori, won the bronze medal in the
team competition, falling just short of
Cuba and a tearful Brazilian team.
In a meet televised live throughout
much of the western hemisphere, Durante
nailed his final routine on high bar to jump
from fourth to second place in the all
around finals, finishing two points behind
defending Pan American champion Eric
Lopez of Cuba.
"All-around finals was the best competi
tion I ever experienced in my life," Du
rante. said ""It was packed with four or five
thousand people, sold out.
"I was a little bit nervous at the end be
cause I knew 1 needed to rock high bar if I
wanted to medal.
Despite the strong finish, the meet
didn't start too'well for the Americans, as
all-arounder Nakamori broke his femur
during a warm-up vault on the first day of
competition. Nakamori, who will defer
coming to Stanford next year to train for
the 2004 Olympics, was flown to Miami to
undergo emergency surgery.
The team also did not benefit from
being in the first competition session,
where scores were significantly lower than
the scores posted during the other prelim
inary sessions.
But the squad came back strong on the
second day of competition, placing three
competitors in the top six — Durante in

second, Jonathan Horton in fourth and
Gill in sixth — and to take the team bronze.
With a solid performance in the team
competition, several team members quali
fied for event finals the following day. Du
rante competed on floor, pommel horse
and parallel bars and Gill took part in the
vault, but only Clay Strother managed to
bring medals home for the Americans — a
silver on floor and a bronze on pommel

horse.
"The guys were a little tired for event fi
nals," Stanford and Pan-American head
coach Thorn Gliemi said. "But it was very
successful, a great learning experience. We
brought home four medals; three more
than at the last Pan-American games."
"It was a really positive experience," Gill

said of his first international com
petition. "I didn't have to many
huge breaks, but I made some
mistakes I regret. But it is all part
of the getting international expe

rience.
The competitors were also
pleasantly surprised with the en
thusiasm of the crowds.
"We were told to expect hostile
fans but we were very well re
ceived by everyone," Gill said.
"They ended up loving gym
nastics," Durante said. "They
cheered for everybody. If anyone

got booed, it was the judges when
they posted low scores."
Coach Glielmi will get little
rest, as more Stanford gymnasts
prepare for international compe
tition this summer.
Back on campus, senior Mar
shall Erwin was one of six Ameri
can gymnasts selected to repre
sent the U.S. at the World Uni

versity games in Seoul, South
Korea. After tying for first place
on the rings at the USA Champi
onships last month, the three
time Ail-American was unsure
until last week whether he would
continue with competitive gym
nastics.
"They contacted [coach Gliel
mi], three of my teammates,

someone on the CS department
and my old club coach before
they were able to reach me be
cause I was at work," Erwin said.
"I was training hard but I
wasn't in routine shape; my en
durance and strength had gone a
little bit."
The 2002 NCAA rings cham
pion has since changed his job
schedule to accommodate his
training and said he will be in
shape for his first international
meet.
With competitions in Michi
gan, Wisconsin, Canada, Brazil,
South Korea and the Dominican
Republic, Stanford gymnasts will
have competed in almost as many
meets this summer as they did
during the entire 2003 college
season.
