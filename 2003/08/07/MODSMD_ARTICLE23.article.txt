## ‘S.W.A.T.’ stands for S-T-A-Y H-O-M-E 
### ILENA GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Synonyms for mediocre in
clude: average, second-rate,
middling, lackluster, unexcep
tional and a new addition —
"s:w.a.t."
Although the movie's rapid
transitions from one crisis to an
other make "S.W.A.T." mildly
diverting, the predictable plot,
chemistry-less characters and
dull dialogue make it an unexcit
ing movie-going experience.
The movie follows Jim Street
(Colin Farrell), a demoted
S.W.A.T team member who is
given a second chance when Dan
"Hondo" Harrison (Samuel L.
Jackson) selects Street to com
plete the team of good-looking
enforcers under his command.
Street had lost his S. WAT. status
when he and his partner, Brian
Gamble (Jeremy Renner), took
matters into their own hands
during a hostage situation in the
opening scene of the movie.
The bank scene sets the stage
for the rest of "S.W.A.T." —
which basically consists of a con
stant barrage of bullets flying,
cars crashing and things blowing
up. But the movie lacks suspense
— from the beginning we know
who will be up to no good —

while these violent displays are
eye-catching, the movie sags be
tween the action scenes. Luckily,
viewers needn't wait long be
tween explosions.
Despite the comments celebrat
ing teamwork that are scattered
throughout the film, the story
doesn't allow for any emotionally
significant conversations — let
alone relationships — between the
S.W.A.T. team members.
There is momentary chem
istry between Street and team
mate Chris Sanchez (Michelle Ro

never to return. Not even Street
and Hondo, as the boss and his
protege, get to have an important

is only so far you can go with the
unremarkable dialogue and plot
of this movie.

Although stars Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson turn up the heat,
their new action flick "S.W.A.T." is only at a simmer.
Director Clark Johnson, a vet
eran of crime TV, combines a vari
ety of different kinds of footage in
several scenes, including a certain
fast-forwarded style that would be
less jarring in a war film. .Although
this melange of footage quickens
the pace of the film, the fast
changes are noticeable and jarring.
What is more effective is the
soundtrack, which alternates be
tween hip-hop and classic rock se
lections, that is engaging and ap
propriate to what is happening on
screen.
"S.W.A.T." has one feature
that sets it slightly apart from
other action flicks; it has its finger
on the pulse of society's current
concerns. From the beginning we
see the continuing racial tension
in L.A. — especially within the po
lice force. The movie dares to play

on residual September 11th in
spired fears as "S.W.A.T." fea
tures not one but two hijacked
plane scenarios. The S.W.A.T.
team members repeatedly discuss
the fact that their line of work
could get them killed at any mo
ment, leaving their children with
out a parent. Touching on cur
rent foreign and domestic affairs,
there is also a suave French mob
ster (Olivier Martinez of "Un
faithful") whose offer of 100 mil
lion dollars to whoever springs
him from jail sparks a media
frenzy — the media seems direct
ly at fault for the havoc this pub
licity leads to. Although these is
sues can only be read in between
the lines of violence, this subtlety
effectively gives "S.W.A.T." an
unsettling veneer. But unfortu
nately, this covering doesn't pen
etrate into the heart of the film.
In a summer piled high with
dull and disappointing block
busters, "S.W.A.T." is just anoth
er mediocre flick to add to the list.
