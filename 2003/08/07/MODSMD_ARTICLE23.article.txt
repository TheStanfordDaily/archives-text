## ‘S.W.A.T.’ stands for S-T-A-Y H-O-M-E 
### ILENA GEORGE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Synonyms for mediocre in
clude: average, second-rate,
middling, lackluster, unexcep
tional and a new addition —
"s:w.a.t."
Although the movie's rapid
transitions from one crisis to an
other make "S.W.A.T." mildly
diverting, the predictable plot,
chemistry-less characters and
dull dialogue make it an unexcit
ing movie-going experience.
The movie follows Jim Street
(Colin Farrell), a demoted
S.W.A.T team member who is
given a second chance when Dan
"Hondo" Harrison (Samuel L.
Jackson) selects Street to com
plete the team of good-looking
enforcers under his command.
Street had lost his S. WAT. status
when he and his partner, Brian
Gamble (Jeremy Renner), took
matters into their own hands
during a hostage situation in the
opening scene of the movie.
The bank scene sets the stage
for the rest of "S.W.A.T." —
which basically consists of a con
stant barrage of bullets flying,
cars crashing and things blowing
up. But the movie lacks suspense
— from the beginning we know
who will be up to no good —

while these violent displays are
eye-catching, the movie sags be
tween the action scenes. Luckily,
viewers needn't wait long be
tween explosions.
Despite the comments celebrat
ing teamwork that are scattered
throughout the film, the story
doesn't allow for any emotionally
significant conversations — let
alone relationships — between the
S.W.A.T. team members.
There is momentary chem
istry between Street and team
mate Chris Sanchez (Michelle Ro
driguez) which fizzles out quickly,
never to return. Not even Street
and Hondo, as the boss and his
protege, get to have an important
and revealing scene together.
While the actors do what they can
with the material they have, there
is only so far you can go with the
unremarkable dialogue and plot
of this movie.

Although stars Colin Farrell and Samuel L. Jackson turn up the heat,
their new action flick "S.W.A.T." is only at a simmer.
