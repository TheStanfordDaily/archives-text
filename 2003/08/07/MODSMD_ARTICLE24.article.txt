# Don't believe the hype: 'Gigli' rhymes with 'really bad'
## 
### SUSAN YUN 
I went to see "Gigli" with high
hopes, only to have them dashed; it
turned out to be one of the most
painful movies I have had to sit
through in a long time.
The only surprise of the entire
film was that Jennifer Lopez and
Ben Affleck weren't the root cause
of "Gigli's" miserable failure. I
had heard the buzz said there was
no on-screen chemistry between
paparazzi darlings J.Lo and Ben,
and I had thought it was probably
true. But the buzz turned out to
be wrong. While their perfor
mances were not Oscar con
tenders, they were acceptable.
However, this unexpected discov
ery was poor consolation for hav
ing to sit through this movie.
Although many are blaming the
high-profile stars for the train

wreck that is "Gigli," most of the
criticism rightfully falls on
writer/director Martin Brest
("Meet Joe Black"). Although the
premise for the story could have
had potential, somehow, during
the story's development, it went
horribly awry.
The movie's title is the first of
its many problems. Named after
the main character, played by
Ben Affleck, the name Gigli is in
explicably confusing. It provides
fora stilted joke ("Gigli, it rhymes
with really") that is reflective of
most of the movie dialogue.
Larry Gigli, outwardly a tough
thug that hires out to the mob, is a
mama's boy deep down who ends
up falling for his accomplice Ricky
(Jennifer Lopez). Unfortunately
for Gigli, Ricky is a lesbian. "Gigli"

another level with a third charac

named Brian (Justin Bartha)
whom Gigli and Ricky have been
instructed to abduct. Over the
course of the movie, Gigli and
Ricky are portrayed as mobsters
with morals, as they start bonding
with their captive and show him
and each other unexpected kind
nesses. It's a complete mystery as to
how either Gigli or Ricky ever
earned reputations as vicious
thugs.
The story, which is bad to

begin with, does not play out well.
The characters are simply unbe
lievable, and the movie comes off
in the end as a horrible experi
ment between "Rain Man" and
"Chasing Amy." Writer/director
Martin Brest miserably fails at
providing an appropriate pace
for the movie. The scenes drag on
endlessly, are disjointed from
one another and are punctuated
by odd pauses in which the cam
eras simply pan either Affleck's or
Lopez's face. In one scene, the
sappy movie music actually starts
before the "heartfelt" moment is
acted out by the characters. Brest
absolutely demolishes any hope
this film had of engaging audi
ences.
Cameo appearances by Christo
pher Walken and Al Pacino also re
veal Brest's weaknesses. Both are
strong actors who deliver their
monologues with skill that expose
Affleck's and Lopez's more novice
performances, but even these scenes
flop miserably. Brest has Walken
and Pacino breeze in and out of the
movie in a way that only highlights
the movie's lack of focus, and the
actors' skillful performances are se
verely undermined by the poor di
rection and poor editing.
I n a nutshell, "Gigli" is as bad as
you've heard it is. A painful script
and horrible directing essentially
eliminate any hope of a plausible
movie. The only surprise was that
Lopez and Affleck do have on
screen chemistry, but that is a rev
elation I would gladly have fore
gone if it meant 1 wouldn't have
had to endure the two hours of
this movie.
