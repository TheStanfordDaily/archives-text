American Wedding
itiftrCi
Although "American Wedding," the
third and final installment in the "Ameri
can Pie" series, has thoroughly mixed and
baked in some the necessary ingredients
of a good movie, including great acting
and a popular formula, the final product
is palatable but not satisfy ing, even when
fresh out of the oven.
Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson
Hannigan) are going to wed. Naturally,
this brings about a chaotic fervor as the
couple and their friends prepare.
Although the script is lack-luster and
the basic story is uninteresting, the per
formances from Jason Biggs, Seann W.
Scott and Eugene Levy keep the material
fresh and funny. In particular, the scenes
between Biggs and Levy and their embar
rassment-laden father-son relationship
established in the first movie continues to
be the heart of the series.
Between the sex jokes, the first "Amer
ican Pie" was able to sneak in an emotion
ally truthful glimpse at a group of friends
at the end of high school but "American
Wedding" fails to do the same for mar
riage.
Here, the comedic interludes are so
prominent, and the dramatic parts of the
movie not sufficiently developed, that the
flick seems more like a vehicle for the
gross-out humor that's the trademark of
the series than anything else.
It's worth seeing "American Wedding
for the wildly funny and creative (albeit
disgusting) comedy sequences, but don't
expect much more from a pie that is only
half-baked at best.

L'Auberge Espagnole
"L'Auberge Espagnole" (The Spanish
Inn), aka "Euro Pudding," takes off like a
jet — and doesn't let you down until the
credits roll. An entertaining and engaging
storyline, international cast, hip multi-lin
gual soundtrack and beautiful Barcelona
backdrop raise this art house flick far
above its flaws.
The movie glorifies the ascetic but jubi
lant lifestyle of the young Europeans in a
way that is both amusing and sincere.
The story follows the affable yet slight
ly naive Xavier (Rojnain Duris), a young
French student who is told by a business
man friend of his father's to go study
abroad in Spain to score a good job after
college. He ends up living in an apart
ment full of other students from all over
Europe.
Under the direction of Cedric Klapisch,
"L'Auberge Espagnole" is visually enticing
in a manner reminiscent of "Amelie";
Klapisch's judicial use of subde special ef
fects add a perfect touch to the film and
keep the movie going at a quick clip.
Despite its great qualities, the movie
goes from pudding to puddle by trying to
do too much. "L'Auberge" goes past its
point of saturation by trying to include all
the characters and sub-plots that Xavier
and his friends are involved with or in;
there is just too much going on for one
movie.
All in all, the story meanders and
weaves through the characters' lives inter
mittently, like a driver without a map in
San Francisco.
But it's a great ride.

Pirates of the Caribbean
Disney has made one hell of a come
back after the painful embarrassment of
"The Country Bears," bursting into the
summer scene with "Pirates of the
Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"
a perfect film for the season.
Since this is, at its core, a Disney Hick,
you will have to sit through the blatant un
folding of a hit-you-over-the-head moral
and an ultimately boring romantic side
story. Having said that, sitting through
this fluff is almost painless, since the rest of
the movie is so much damn fun.
Disney fans will be quick to spot the
perfecdy placed scenes stolen from the
ride that inspired the film — from cavort
ing drunkards and wenches to jailed men
coaxing a dog that holds the keys to their
cell, the cartoonish, raucous feel of the
ride is Carried over into the film as well,
and with good results.
The curse of the Black Pearl, a ragged
ship that always brings fog into port with
it, is connected to stolen Aztec gold and
some very angry ancient gods. Lead by
Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the
filthy pirates that crew the doomed ship
have a nasty habit of turning into half
decomposed skeletons whenever moon
light hits them. This particular special ef
fect lends itself to some awesome mo
ments.
"Pirates" runs a bit long, but in the end
it doesn't take away from the fun of the
movie as a whole. This is not necessarily a
good movie, but when it gets going, that
doesn't really matter — you're having
way too much fun to care.

Terminator 3
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Ma
chines," the man who could be the next
governor of California plays T-101, a
more advanced version of the termina
tor that was reprogrammed to protect
Sarah Connor and son after he tried to
assassinate her in the original "Termi
nator."
Stick with me, this isn't "Mulholland
Drive."
The noticeable difference in this movie
is that it's directed by Jonathan Mostow
("U-571"). The first two were from James
Cameron, and those relied on character
development, first; the special effects
were built around the plot.
All that's lost in "Terminator 3," a
shoot-'em up action movie that features
more explosions than the latest "Charlie's
Angels" movie.
But that's not to say "Terminator 3"
isn't an intelligent, economical summer
action movie. In fact, Mostow knows his
summer-blockbuster basics.
If James Cameron had been at the
helm, no doubt he would have pushed
the envelope further. Not with explo
sions, per say, as there are only a number
of ways you can blow a monster truck to
smithereens, but he would have worked
to develop the melodramatic force of the
material — with suspense, with tension,
with more at stake, psychologically
speaking.
"Terminator 3" works, but only on the
surface level: it's fun and free-spirited, yet
you leave the theater with the feeling as if
the product is just a little too robotic.

this brings about a chaotic fervor as the
couple and their friends prepare.
Although the script is lack-luster and
the basic story is uninteresting, the per
formances from Jason Biggs, Seann W.
Scott and Eugene Levy keep the material
fresh and funny. In particular, the scenes
between Biggs and Levy and their embar
rassment-laden father-son relationship
established in the first movie continues to
be the heart of the series.
Between the sex jokes, the first "Amer
ican Pie" was able to sneak in an emotion
ally truthful glimpse at a group of friends
at the end of high school but "American
Wedding" fails to do the same for mar
riage.
Here, the comedic interludes are so
prominent, and the dramatic parts of the
movie not sufficiently developed, that the
flick seems more like a vehicle for the
gross-out humor that's the trademark of
the series than anything else.
It's worth seeing "American Wedding
for the wildly funny and creative (albeit
disgusting) comedy sequences, but don't
expect much more from a pie that is only
half-baked at best.

L'Auberge Espagnole
"L'Auberge Espagnole" (The Spanish
Inn), aka "Euro Pudding," takes off like a
jet — and doesn't let you down until the
credits roll. An entertaining and engaging
storyline, international cast, hip multi-lin
gual soundtrack and beautiful Barcelona
backdrop raise this art house flick far
above its flaws.
The movie glorifies the ascetic but jubi
lant lifestyle of the young Europeans in a
way that is both amusing and sincere.
The story follows the affable yet slight
ly naive Xavier (Rojnain Duris), a young
French student who is told by a business
man friend of his father's to go study
abroad in Spain to score a good job after
college. He ends up living in an apart
ment full of other students from all over
Europe.
Under the direction of Cedric Klapisch,
"L'Auberge Espagnole" is visually enticing
in a manner reminiscent of "Amelie";
Klapisch's judicial use of subde special ef
fects add a perfect touch to the film and
keep the movie going at a quick clip.
Despite its great qualities, the movie
goes from pudding to puddle by trying to
do too much. "L'Auberge" goes past its
point of saturation by trying to include all
the characters and sub-plots that Xavier
and his friends are involved with or in;
there is just too much going on for one
movie.
All in all, the story meanders and
weaves through the characters' lives inter
mittently, like a driver without a map in
San Francisco.
But it's a great ride.

Pirates of the Caribbean
Disney has made one hell of a come
back after the painful embarrassment of
"The Country Bears," bursting into the
summer scene with "Pirates of the
Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"
a perfect film for the season.
Since this is, at its core, a Disney Hick,
you will have to sit through the blatant un
folding of a hit-you-over-the-head moral
and an ultimately boring romantic side
story. Having said that, sitting through
this fluff is almost painless, since the rest of
the movie is so much damn fun.
Disney fans will be quick to spot the
perfecdy placed scenes stolen from the
ride that inspired the film — from cavort
ing drunkards and wenches to jailed men
coaxing a dog that holds the keys to their
cell, the cartoonish, raucous feel of the
ride is Carried over into the film as well,
and with good results.
The curse of the Black Pearl, a ragged
ship that always brings fog into port with
it, is connected to stolen Aztec gold and
some very angry ancient gods. Lead by
Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the
filthy pirates that crew the doomed ship
have a nasty habit of turning into half
decomposed skeletons whenever moon
light hits them. This particular special ef
fect lends itself to some awesome mo
ments.
"Pirates" runs a bit long, but in the end
it doesn't take away from the fun of the
movie as a whole. This is not necessarily a
good movie, but when it gets going, that
doesn't really matter — you're having
way too much fun to care.

Terminator 3
In "Terminator 3: Rise of the Ma
chines," the man who could be the next
governor of California plays T-101, a
more advanced version of the termina
tor that was reprogrammed to protect
Sarah Connor and son after he tried to
assassinate her in the original "Termi
nator."
Stick with me, this isn't "Mulholland
Drive."
The noticeable difference in this movie
is that it's directed by Jonathan Mostow
("U-571"). The first two were from James
Cameron, and those relied on character
development, first; the special effects
were built around the plot.
All that's lost in "Terminator 3," a
shoot-'em up action movie that features
more explosions than the latest "Charlie's
Angels" movie.
But that's not to say "Terminator 3"
isn't an intelligent, economical summer
action movie. In fact, Mostow knows his
summer-blockbuster basics.
If James Cameron had been at the
helm, no doubt he would have pushed
the envelope further. Not with explo
sions, per say, as there are only a number
of ways you can blow a monster truck to
smithereens, but he would have worked
to develop the melodramatic force of the
material — with suspense, with tension,
with more at stake, psychologically
speaking.
"Terminator 3" works, but only on the
surface level: it's fun and free-spirited, yet
you leave the theater with the feeling as if
the product is just a little too robotic.

American Wedding
itiftrCi
Although "American Wedding," the
third and final installment in the "Ameri
can Pie" series, has thoroughly mixed and
baked in some the necessary ingredients
of a good movie, including great acting
and a popular formula, the final product
is palatable but not satisfy ing, even when
fresh out of the oven.
Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson
Hannigan) are going to wed. Naturally,
this brings about a chaotic fervor as the
