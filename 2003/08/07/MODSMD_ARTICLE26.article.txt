### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Love, they say, knows no boundaries.
But judging from this summer's line-up,
neither does reality TV. Let's scout out the
latest offerings: Behind door number one:
"For Love or Money 2" (NBC, Mondays 9
p.m.)
The scoop: A continuation of the uber
popular series "For Love or Money," this
series takes the winner of the other series —
Erin, a software sales manager from San
Francisco — and let's her search for true
love from a whopping selection of ... 15
men.
The prize: The man Erin picks gets to
choose between a cold hard million dollars
and Erin's love and/or body.
The twist: Oh! — to paraphrase
Danielle from "Big Brother 3," expect the
unexpected. Rob, the man Erin dumped
for the cash at the end of the original show,

is back in the next episode.
Who should win: Wade, the 29-year-old
salesman from Texas, who wouldn't know
how to close the deal fora million dollars if
someone left the cash register open. In
other words, he'll choose Erin — and while
they wouldn't live happily ever after, she
would — with the loot.
Who will win: Eric, the 27-year-old
media planner from Minnesota, who has
more tricks up his sleeve than a weasel in
flip-flops. And he's greasy. And he'll take the
money —which begs the question —can we
be so lucky to hope fora third installment to
this guiltiest of guilty pleasures?
Behind door number two: "Cupid"
(CBS, Tuesdays 9 p.m.)
The scoop: Simon Cowell, from "Amer
ican Idol," produces this reality show
which is EXACTLY like "American Idol"
— only for daters, not singers.
The prize: The man America selects
must wed the ladv of the show — Lisa, an

ad copywriter from Detroit — and they
must remain married a year to split the
million bucks.
The twist: Lisa's two friends take on the
Paula Abdul/Cowell roles of critiquing the
dates, and they're bitchier than a Mariah
Carey-Jennifer Lopez diva combo.
Who should win: Robert, the 25-year
old fitness model from Los Angeles. Sure,
he has absolutely no chemistry with Lisa.
But this Arnold Schwarzenegger-look
alike is so clueless about love and ... life,
that a year-long marriage to him could
produce a reality show more entertaining
than anything Roseanne Barr has up her
beefy sleeves.
Who will win: Hank, the 25-year-old
auctions trader from Chicago, who has the
gee-shucks appeal to win America over.
Behind door number three: "Who
Wants to Marry My Dad?" (NBC], Monday
10 p.m. season finale)
The scoop: A spin-off of the not-so

überly popular series "Meet My Folks,"
this time with four 20-something children
picking a mate for their father.
The prize: The bald man of every
woman's dreams, Don Mueller — the
"dad" who signed up for the show. Isn't
love enough?
The twist: Apparently not, because the
bald man is loaded with money and owns a
mansion.
Who should have won: Cynthia, a yoga
instructor from Beverly Hills, who — un
fortunately — fell head-over-heels for Ron
swifter than the heroine of a Renee Zell
weger movie. Her elimination from last
week's show was the most teary-eyed mo
ment in reality television since Marcellas
was booted out of the Big Brother house.
Who will win: Christy, the model from
Dallas, who can't love Ron nearly as much
as she does his money. Hey, the lady knows
how to cover her bets — and it usually in
volves shedding her clothes.
