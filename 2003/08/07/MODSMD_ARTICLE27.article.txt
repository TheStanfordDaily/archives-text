"American Pie: Beneath the Crust"
"American Pie 2: Beneath the Crust"
Critical integrity compels me to admit right off the bat that
neither "American Pie" nor its sequel are particularly good
films. Jason Biggs shows potential, Eugene Levy is amusing
and there are a few belly laughs; but any goodwill is by and
large soured (particularly in part two) by the unrelenting
crudeness, leer-and-wink voyeurism and thick, syrupy senti
mentality.
And the new bonus "Beneath the Crust" making-of DVD
is little more than an attempt to at once promote and cash-in
on the third film in the series, "American Wedding." Anyone
seeking "quality" movies among new DVD releases will prob
ably be happier with "Solaris," "Spider" or "The Quiet Amer
ican."
On the other hand, neither of those ostensibly better
movies devotes nearly as much screen-time to the wonderful
Alyson Hannigan. Nearly every scene featuring Hannigan's
Michelle — a nymphomaniac band-camp geek — stands far
above everything else in the "American Pies." Michelle, one of
the films' few characters who isn't a walking stereotype, gets
the best line at the literal climax of the first film and her great
ly increased presence in the second is its sole redeeming
value.
Leaving aside the question of Hannigan's hotness, she de
serves praise for playing Michelle with a genuinely sweet
dorkiness that actually fits with her sexual open-mindedness
and ... appetite. Michelle is so smart, funny and unpre
dictable that both the actress and character seem too good for
the idiotic shenanigans surrounding them.
Now that "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" — on which Hanni
gan played the equally geeky and endearing Willow — has
completed its run (and there's another six months to wait be
fore the next DVD set), the "American Pie" films are the best
way for Hannigan fans to get their fix.
