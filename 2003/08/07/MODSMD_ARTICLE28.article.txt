# 'Wizard' worth the trip
## 
### ANDREW NIELSEN 
Take two dudes from the Mid
west, paint them up in K.ISS-esque
greasepaint, hook them up with a
talented rap producer, and market
them as a heavy metal group — this
was the formula that went into cre
ating Detroit's notorious hip-hop
duo, the Insane Clown Posse, a
marketing dream for an industry
that thrives on conceptual synergy.
Formed in the late 80's, ICP
once consisted of three MC's, and
later distilled into a duo consisting
of Violent J (Joseph Bruce), Shaggy
2 Dope (Joey Ulster). ICP dropped
their debut in 1992, and later
gained some notoriety with 1994's
"Ringmaster." Banking on occult
imagery and carnival music thrown
over break-beats, the Insane Clown
Posse began to inject vaudeville
esque themes into their work, re
sulting in something reminiscent a
goofier hip-hop Marilyn Manson.
After selling a significant
amount of albums independently,
ICP was eventually signed by Hol
lywood Records, a subsidiary of
Disney. "The Great Milenko," ap
peared in 1997, but due to the
graphic content and controversial
language, Disney CEO Michael
Eisner made an executive decision
to keep the major label debut from
shelves, in part due the increasing
pressure from the Christian Right
to sanitize the media promulgated
by the family friendly corporation.
The controversy behind the
album led to a fair bit of ICP-relat
ed press. Having poured over a
million dollars into the album's
production, Violent J and Shaggy 2
Dope were intent on making sure
that the record was heard. Based
on buzz from Disney's recall of the

CD, Island Records quickly
signed the group. Island's release
of "the Great Milenko," reached
the Top 40.
Fast forward six years and four al
bums later, and we have the first solo
album from ICP's front man, Vio
lent J. "Wizard of the Hood," strays
away from the thematic stagnation of
the last five years of ICP's career, by
using a central story to keep the con
cept album together. "Wizard of the
Hood," is a modern day "Wizard of
Oz," a testament to ICP's rock influ
ence and Pink Floyd's cross refer
encing of the same story.
The album's first track, "Let it
Rain," attacks with a crunchy beat
reminiscent of Prince Paul's mid
era work. Violent J's EPMI) ap
proach to the flow is some of his
best delivery to date, a testament to
the MC's ability to back up his the
atricism with genuine lyrical skill.
"It's getting kind of windy and the
walls are shaking / Fuckin' roofs
coming off] I'm in a lazy boy bak
ing," J raps. "Yellow Brick Alley
way," paints the picture of J's ar
rival to Oz, "I'm alive man," he
raps, "but I don't know where the
fuck I am! / Damn, don't under
stand fantasy land."
What really draws me to the
album is the creative decisions made
by producer Michael Puwal, creat
ing atmospheric contexts for each
track. "Let it Rain," takes us to the
streets of Detroit, while the organ on
"Yellow Brick Alleyway" brings to
mind the joyfulness of Munchkin
Land. The harmonica on the Scare
crow's track brings to mind images
of cornfields, while the distorted
guitar on the Tin Man's song makes
a clear connection between the
metal of the Tin Man's outfit and the
genre of music. For the Lion's song,

Puwal samples three conga drums,
bringing to mind the mental picture
of an African savanna, the lion's
would-be habitat. The album reach
es its end with an up-tempo track
the calls to mind die hey-day of Sub
lime and Sugar Ray. However, in
stead of attempting to emulate these
groups, Violent J takes an ironic ap
proach, parodying the music while
crafting a song reminiscent of these
groups. "I'm singing—like Michael
Jackson, y'all," J raps over bouncy
guitar, "without the litde boys and
the plastic nose."
To appreciate "Wizard of the
Hood," you must first accept the
ICP's general premise that hip-hop
need not take itself overdy serious
ly. The fun and imagination that
the group has injected into die
genre harkens back to De La Soul
and Run-DMC, progenitors of die
post-modern subculture. Objective
ly speaking, "Wizard of the Hood,"
may not be as good as ICP's 1997
opus. But, Violent J makes it clear
that I CP's has had its place in the
limelight, and if he continues to
make the type of music that he
wants to create, that is all we can ask
from him. In a genre wrought with
rhymes about the bling-bling and
Bendeys, Violent J's "Wizard of the
Hood" is an imaginative breath of
fresh air.

lywood Records, a subsidiary of
Disney. "The Great Milenko," ap
peared in 1997, but due to the
graphic content and controversial
language, Disney CEO Michael
Eisner made an executive decision
to keep the major label debut from
shelves, in part due the increasing
pressure from the Christian Right
to sanitize the media promulgated
by the family friendly corporation.
The controversy behind the
album led to a fair bit of ICP-relat
ed press. Having poured over a
million dollars into the album's
production, Violent J and Shaggy 2
Dope were intent on making sure
that the record was heard. Based
on buzz from Disney's recall of the

CD, Island Records quickly
signed the group. Island's release
of "the Great Milenko," reached
the Top 40.
Fast forward six years and four al
bums later, and we have the first solo
album from ICP's front man, Vio
lent J. "Wizard of the Hood," strays
away from the thematic stagnation of
the last five years of ICP's career, by
using a central story to keep the con
cept album together. "Wizard of the
Hood," is a modern day "Wizard of
Oz," a testament to ICP's rock influ
ence and Pink Floyd's cross refer
encing of the same story.
The album's first track, "Let it
Rain," attacks with a crunchy beat
reminiscent of Prince Paul's mid
era work. Violent J's EPMI) ap
proach to the flow is some of his
best delivery to date, a testament to
the MC's ability to back up his the
atricism with genuine lyrical skill.
"It's getting kind of windy and the
walls are shaking / Fuckin' roofs
coming off] I'm in a lazy boy bak
ing," J raps. "Yellow Brick Alley
way," paints the picture of J's ar
rival to Oz, "I'm alive man," he
raps, "but I don't know where the
fuck I am! / Damn, don't under
stand fantasy land."
What really draws me to the
album is the creative decisions made
by producer Michael Puwal, creat
ing atmospheric contexts for each
track. "Let it Rain," takes us to the
streets of Detroit, while the organ on
"Yellow Brick Alleyway" brings to
mind the joyfulness of Munchkin
Land. The harmonica on the Scare
crow's track brings to mind images
of cornfields, while the distorted
guitar on the Tin Man's song makes
a clear connection between the
metal of the Tin Man's outfit and the
genre of music. For the Lion's song,

Puwal samples three conga drums,
bringing to mind the mental picture
of an African savanna, the lion's
would-be habitat. The album reach
es its end with an up-tempo track
the calls to mind die hey-day of Sub
lime and Sugar Ray. However, in
stead of attempting to emulate these
groups, Violent J takes an ironic ap
proach, parodying the music while
crafting a song reminiscent of these
groups. "I'm singing—like Michael
Jackson, y'all," J raps over bouncy
guitar, "without the litde boys and
the plastic nose."
To appreciate "Wizard of the
Hood," you must first accept the
ICP's general premise that hip-hop
need not take itself overdy serious
ly. The fun and imagination that
the group has injected into die
genre harkens back to De La Soul
and Run-DMC, progenitors of die
post-modern subculture. Objective
ly speaking, "Wizard of the Hood,"
may not be as good as ICP's 1997
opus. But, Violent J makes it clear
that I CP's has had its place in the
limelight, and if he continues to
make the type of music that he
wants to create, that is all we can ask
from him. In a genre wrought with
rhymes about the bling-bling and
Bendeys, Violent J's "Wizard of the
Hood" is an imaginative breath of
fresh air.
