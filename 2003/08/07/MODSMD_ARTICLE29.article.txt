## NCAA Football 2004 
### ERIC FORD 
"EA Sports" has been producing great sports ti
tles for many years now, and "NCAA Football
2004" — the latest installment in their college foot
ball franchise — is the best to date.
For those out there unfamiliar with "EA Sports,"
it's the company responsible for many of the great
sports games that are out in today's video game
market. These include "NBA Live," "Tiger Woods
PGA Tour" and "Madden NFL." "NCAA Football"
is one of the more recent tides added to their im
pressive list, and every year its been getting better.
"NCAA Football" is available for all three current
platforms, but diere are a few differences in each one.
For starters, on-line play is only on die PS2, while the
X-Box bolsters better graphics and sound. The
Gamecube is in the middle, with better load times
and graphics dian die PS2, but not nearly as impres
sive as the X-Box. In my opinion, the X-Box, with it's
built-in hard drive, is designed for sports games, be
cause when you start making teams, players and dy
nasties, you'll need all the space you can get.
For hardcore sports fans, "NCAA Football" pro
vides all you need for the ultimate college football
experience. The create-a-player mode is decent,
the dynasty mode will have you playing coundess
football seasons, and the create-a-school mode
combines ail of the above into whatever school you
want to make. You can even design the stadium for
your new university. After you're done with all of
that, you can even replay some of college football's

most memorable games, including the 1982 Big
Game featuring "The Play."
For fans of previous "NCAA. Football" games,
2004 brings much improved graphics, great play
by-play (although it gets bland when you've played
30 games straight), and over a 150 new teams. This
title is more than your typical sports upgrade. The
new camera angles will impress even the most die
hard of football tans. Also, the team AI is even bet
ter, with computer teammates actually bloc king for
you down the field, trying to open up holes for you
as the runner. It's much more realistic and quite
simply, amazing.
There are so many great things about this title,
but I personally believe that the atmosphere is
what makes this game shine the most. When the
teams come out on the field, you hear the bands
playing, the crowd cheering, everything that you
would find in a real college football game. When
you score a touchdown, you see the school mascots
celebrating, students firing a cannon, or maybe
some flag bearers running across the end zone
with your school's logo. Perhaps one of the coolest
aspects of the game are the weekly "Sports Illus
trated" magazine covers that are generated with
news about the hottest teams playing. If you've just
upset the top seated team or if you have a hot new
star rising in the ranks, you just might have your
team on the cover, which feels like such an accom
plishment when it actually happens.
Enough about the atmosphere, how does the
game play? Gameplay is still great, with a few small
improvements to make it even better. The controls
are tight, with rushing and passing functions cus
tomizable to whichever buttons you want. The
training modes will help a novice understand the
intricacies of football, and training mode will help
you learn the playbooks.
This game is a must-have for any football fans
out there. The amount of depth and customization
that it possesses is amazing. Also, with the "EA
Sports Bio" that is featured in every new "EA
Sports" game, you get awarded for how many
games you buy. For example, your graduating
class from your current school can be exported in
the NFL Draft for next year's season. Also, just for
playing the games, you're rewarded with cheats
and hidden features. Overall, this game is highly
recommended, and there's nothing sweeter than
seeing your Stanford team destroy Cal by 50 points
and advance to the Rose Bowl.
