### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Clueless about the clitoris? Vague on
vibrators? Or if you just aren't gettin'
enough summer lovin' and you need to
satisfy your horny needs, listen up, you
foxy mama (or daddy), Roxy wants to
guide you through the process of pur
chasing your first sex toy.
Many college students think that
they don't need sex toys. Maybe their
fingers or hands will suffice. But some
times, you get "muscle cramps" and it's
good to turn to technology once every
so often. Or maybe they'll buy a pair of
hand-cuffs. They're edgy. Please. Soft
core bondage can be accomplished
with a pair of bandanna, a chair and a
little imagination.
But many women in particular are
reluctant to shop for sex toys. They
think that they have to go into some
smut shop in the city or buy on-line
and have their toys delivered in anony
mous paper packages. There are alter
natives here in the Bay Area.
Contrary to the impression you may
have gotten on your freshman scav
enger hunt, Big Al's in North Beach is
not scary. It's well lit, clean and has a
decent selection. However, it's grossly
overpriced, so Roxy recommends tak
ing your business elsewhere.
Several of Roxy's friends told her
about Good Vibrations, a chain of
stores and on-line retailer that special
izes in creating a friendly environment.
This isn't an ad for the place, but Roxy
visited the Berkeley store and was im
pressed. When Roxy asked if they had
any vibrators with tongue, the clerk
nicely explained that they had discon
tinued them, but demonstrated an in
teresting suction device that might do
the trick. Roxy's not sold on the device,
but she appreciated the attentiveness
of the service.

Roxy went with a friend, which was
a good idea because a large selection
can get overwhelming. There were dis
play models for most of the vibrators,
which Roxy feels is a good idea.
But how, you ask, do you try them
in the store?
Easy — the nose test. Sex toy wis
dom says that the best way to test how a
vibrator will feel is to hold it up against
your nose.
Picking a vibrator is tricky but the
wide range of styles and prices means
that everyone is certain to find a vi
brator that fits. This sex goddess is
partial to the pocket rocket, small,
discrete and effective, but pricey: the
basic model starts at 32 dollars.
There were Hello Kitty and Winnie
the Pooh models for 30 dollars,
which looked more like giant pens
than vibrators. A personal favorite is
the 15 dollar "Private Private,"
dressed like a British Beefeater. For
the truly adventurous, there's the
Fukuoku wrist-held vibe — notable
both for its suggestive name and its
finger attachments.
Roxy's sex toy shopping companion
decided to shell out 18 dollars fora
raspberry-colored vibrator/dildo made
of hard plastic and equipped with
ridges on the sides. Alter about a week
of use, she regretted that she had not
settled instead for the 9" long and
2.25" wide black dildo (black ones real
ly are the biggest, but Roxy's friend was
low on cash that day). No vibrations,
but filling. Don't forget to use a con
dom with the dildos to keep them
clean.
A final piece of advice: you might
want to pick up some lubricant while
you're there. If you're uncertain of
how best to use it, experiment, and go
for the flavors — they're fun. The
strawberry-flavored dental dams re
minded Roxy of Jamba Juice.
