In last week's article
"Workers demand rights," it
states that workers want the
University to "carry out pos
sible layoffs on seniority." It
should have read that work
ers want the University to
take seniority into account if
layoffs were to occur.
In the July 27 article "GCEP
considers options for new
areas of research," it states
that GCEP Deputy Director
Chris Edwards is working on
"increasing energy in engine
combustion." Edwards' re
search is working to increase
energy efficiency, not the
amount of energy used, in
combustion processes.
