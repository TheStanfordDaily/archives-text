## Cordell seeks to find 'another way' 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with LaDoris Cordell, vice provost
and special counselor to the president for
campus relations. Cordell, j.D. '74, dis
cussed the issues and concerns that she is
addressing in her campaign as a candidate
for the Palo Alto City Council, which has
four seats up for election this November.
The Daily: Why did you decide to run for
the Palo Alto City Council?
LaDoris Cordell: There are probably at
least three reasons, maybe four — and
these are not necessarily in order of prior
ity. The first reason is that I have lived in
Palo Alto for 20 years, and during those 20
years I raised my two daughters, who at
tended public schools in Palo Alto — actu
ally, even before public schools, from the
Palo Alto Community Childcare Center
all the way to graduating from Gunn High
5ch001.... This is a community in which
I chose to live and chose to stay because it
has so much to offer, and the potential for
it to even offer more is tremendous. So it
is a community of which I care very much
and have invested 20 years of my life.
Second, I was raised in a family — 1 am
one of three children; I have two sisters, I
am in the middle — in a suburb outside of
Philadelphia by parents who supported
the family by running a dry cleaning busi
ness in the community — it was primarily
a black community — whose clientele also
were people who lived on the main line.
The main line is where old money in this
country is; you're talking about the Heinz
family and the DuPont family and all
those. What I had learned by example —
my parents did not preach to us — I had
learned that it is so important to give back
to the community and do public service.
How I'd learned it is that the dry cleaning
service ended up becoming the center of
political activity in the community in
which I grew up. So, if there were an inci
dent with the police, if someone from the
community were running for political of
fice, Spring Cleaners — the name of my
parents' business — ended up being the
focal point where people would gather to
deal with things political and also just
things that affected the community. I saw
my parents, by example, giving back to
the community. And we often heard that
since their children — that's the three of
us — had the benefit of the best education
you could get probably anywhere in the
world, it was our responsibility to use that
education to help others to do better.
Number three, I have given almost 20
years of my life to working in the public
interest and for public service. My actual
tenure on the bench fell just short of 19
years, but for 19 years I was a public ser
vant. I worked for all the people who live
in this entire county and feel very strong
ly— and doing that for 18 years as a

Stanford Law graduate, I probably could
have gone and made a whole lot more
money working in the private sector. I de
clined to do so because 1 enjoyed being a
judge, and second, the whole notion of
working for the public good was very im
portant to me. So here I am back again, I
gave up that career and retired. I've been
back at Stanford for two and a half years
and I am very concerned about the direc
tion in which I see city government going
and believe that I can help and make a
difference.
The fourth reason; I read a book by
Michael Moore called "Stupid White
Men," and it is a very good book
Michael Moore, of whom I am a fan,
talked about the rather dismal state of af
fairs in the world, specifically in this na
tion, and he is very hard on the Bush ad
ministration. I am of the same mind — I
am a liberal Democrat, I am a feminist. He
in his book wrote about all the things that
he sees as being not good, but he doesn't
just whine and complain .... I really took
back the message, which is 'get out there
and do something.' I believe that you can
bring about change by starting on the
local level, and you can't get more local
than getting involved in city politics. For
example, the theme of my campaign is
"Another way." There has got to be an
other way to do things in the political
arena. So, for example, I am disgusted
with campaign financing in this nation. It
is completely out of hand, excessive
amounts of money being raised for what,
to help someone get a political office? You
have people who are starving and organi
zations that desperately need money,
non-profits that help people, but no, we
give money to people who send out slick
brochures. That is not where I am head
ed. So, I am accepting no money for my
campaign. Whatever I can do, I do it — I
tap the energy, time and talent of people
because I think democracy is really based
on all of that....
Another reason I got involved is be
cause I believe I can bring to the city coun
cil the skills that I utilized when I was on
the bench. I presided in family court,
which is the most dysfunctional group of
families you will ever see — go sit and
watch family court. I presided for three
years and I ended up settling a record
number of causes, 96 percent, when I was
the supervising judge in family court.
That is a remarkable number, and it
shows that I have the ability even to take
the most dysfunctional people and, in the
majority of cases, at least come to some
resolution. That is another skill that I be
lieve I bring.
I oversee five offices here, and the
word came out from the mountain on
high at Stanford, budget cuts — had to
cut budgets last year and this year. I was
able, working with a wonderful staff, to
implement budget cuts that the Universi-
