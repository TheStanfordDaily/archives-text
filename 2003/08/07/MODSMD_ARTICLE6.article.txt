## Cordell seeks to find 'another way' 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with LaDoris Cordell, vice provost
and special counselor to the president for
campus relations. Cordell, j.D. '74, dis
cussed the issues and concerns that she is
addressing in her campaign as a candidate
for the Palo Alto City Council, which has
four seats up for election this November.
The Daily: Why did you decide to run for
the Palo Alto City Council?
LaDoris Cordell: There are probably at
least three reasons, maybe four — and
these are not necessarily in order of prior
ity. The first reason is that I have lived in
Palo Alto for 20 years, and during those 20
years I raised my two daughters, who at
tended public schools in Palo Alto — actu
ally, even before public schools, from the
Palo Alto Community Childcare Center
all the way to graduating from Gunn High
5ch001.... This is a community in which
I chose to live and chose to stay because it
has so much to offer, and the potential for
it to even offer more is tremendous. So it
is a community of which I care very much
and have invested 20 years of my life.
Second, I was raised in a family — 1 am
one of three children; I have two sisters, I
am in the middle — in a suburb outside of
Philadelphia by parents who supported
the family by running a dry cleaning busi
ness in the community — it was primarily
a black community — whose clientele also
were people who lived on the main line.
The main line is where old money in this
country is; you're talking about the Heinz
family and the DuPont family and all
those. What I had learned by example —
my parents did not preach to us — I had
learned that it is so important to give back
to the community and do public service.
How I'd learned it is that the dry cleaning
service ended up becoming the center of
political activity in the community in
which I grew up. So, if there were an inci
dent with the police, if someone from the
community were running for political of
fice, Spring Cleaners — the name of my
parents' business — ended up being the
focal point where people would gather to
deal with things political and also just
things that affected the community. I saw
my parents, by example, giving back to
the community. And we often heard that
since their children — that's the three of
us — had the benefit of the best education
you could get probably anywhere in the
world, it was our responsibility to use that
education to help others to do better.
Number three, I have given almost 20
years of my life to working in the public
interest and for public service. My actual
tenure on the bench fell just short of 19
years, but for 19 years I was a public ser
vant. I worked for all the people who live
in this entire county and feel very strong
ly— and doing that for 18 years as a

Stanford Law graduate, I probably could
have gone and made a whole lot more
money working in the private sector. I de
clined to do so because 1 enjoyed being a
judge, and second, the whole notion of
working for the public good was very im
portant to me. So here I am back again, I
gave up that career and retired. I've been
back at Stanford for two and a half years
and I am very concerned about the direc
tion in which I see city government going
and believe that I can help and make a
difference.
The fourth reason; I read a book by
Michael Moore called "Stupid White
Men," and it is a very good book
Michael Moore, of whom I am a fan,
talked about the rather dismal state of af
fairs in the world, specifically in this na
tion, and he is very hard on the Bush ad
ministration. I am of the same mind — I
am a liberal Democrat, I am a feminist. He
in his book wrote about all the things that
he sees as being not good, but he doesn't
just whine and complain .... I really took
back the message, which is 'get out there
and do something.' I believe that you can
bring about change by starting on the
local level, and you can't get more local
than getting involved in city politics. For
example, the theme of my campaign is
"Another way." There has got to be an
other way to do things in the political
arena. So, for example, I am disgusted
with campaign financing in this nation. It
is completely out of hand, excessive
amounts of money being raised for what,
to help someone get a political office? You
have people who are starving and organi
zations that desperately need money,
non-profits that help people, but no, we
give money to people who send out slick
brochures. That is not where I am head
ed. So, I am accepting no money for my
campaign. Whatever I can do, I do it — I
tap the energy, time and talent of people
because I think democracy is really based
on all of that....
Another reason I got involved is be
cause I believe I can bring to the city coun
cil the skills that I utilized when I was on
the bench. I presided in family court,
which is the most dysfunctional group of
families you will ever see — go sit and
watch family court. I presided for three
years and I ended up settling a record
number of causes, 96 percent, when I was
the supervising judge in family court.
That is a remarkable number, and it
shows that I have the ability even to take
the most dysfunctional people and, in the
majority of cases, at least come to some
resolution. That is another skill that I be
lieve I bring.
I oversee five offices here, and the
word came out from the mountain on
high at Stanford, budget cuts — had to
cut budgets last year and this year. I was
able, working with a wonderful staff, to
implement budget cuts that the Universi-
ty wanted. But at the same time,
I did so without sacrificing ser
vices because my offices serve
people.
TD: Could you expand more on
the specific issues and legislative
agenda that you will take up, if
elected?
LC: There are some very serious
concerns I have that I think are
really hot-button issues for Palo
Alto. One of them is develop
ment — a lot of people, particu
larly those in the neighbor
hoods, are concerned about
overdevelopment to the point
where the neighborhoods that
so characterize Palo Alto and
make it such a wonderful place
to live become jeopardized by so
much development. I do believe
in development, I think it is
good for any city because it
brings you your tax base, which
generates the money and en
ables you to run the city and pro
vide all kinds of services. But at
the same time, there has to be a
balance between development
and looking at the needs and
quality of life of neighborhoods.
So, 1 am for development, but
not overdevelopment.
Another big issue in Palo Alto
is something called the
'Charleston corridor,' and this
Charleston Avenue is a long
street that has on it approximate
ly seven schools, and I live along
that corridor and my children
went to school along it. And over
the years, traffic has almost grid
locked, particularly in the morn
ing. And maybe that is the way it
has to be, but I am concerned
about the safety of children
who've got to cross Charleston to
be able to get to these schools, so
something has to be done, and
that is certainly high on the list —
not just my list, but that of city

council people, and at which
they've been looking at fora year
or more about the impact of traf
fic along the Charleston corridor.
And there are many other is
sues in terms of neighborhoods,
traffic, quality of life, retail ser
vices and what we want Palo Alto
to look like and to be. So those
are issues that I haven't staked a
position or a hard line on be
cause I think that would be a mis
take. I think once elected and
you're new to city council, you
shut up, you listen, you learn,
you talk to staff and then you fig
ure out what the issues are, and
then you don't just make up your
mind about what's best for peo
ple, that's arrogant. What you do
is you talk to people on both
sides — [all] sides — of the is
sues to try to arrive at what you
think is probably best for the
community.
TD: A number of the areas that
you mentioned, such as devel
opment and traffic concerns,
are issues that are very relevant
to the Stanford community.
What are your views on these
concerns and how would your
connection with Stanford affect
your decisions?
LC: I have an easy out on this
one, but first, let me tell you that
what you just said about how
Stanford and Palo Alto impact
each other — it is a big impact,
and we know that. There was
Sand Hill Road, which tended
to bring a lot of tension between
those who live in Stanford or are
connected with Stanford and
those who live without. So yes,
anything Palo Alto does or Stan
ford does, they impact on each
other. They can't be done in a
vacuum. Now, I have an easy
out on this, because if I am elect
ed, I cannot vote on any matter
that affects Stanford. Under the
law, I have to [not vote]. As long
as Stanford is my employer, it is
improper for me to vote on
[such] an issue . . . The law also

says I am not even permitted to
weigh in on public discussion.
For example, when there is pub
lic discussion at a city council
meeting about Stanford doing
x, y or z, I have to leave the
room.
TD: You talked about how you
are not accepting campaign do
nations and that you are going
to use volunteers to pursue
your campaign efforts. Could
you expand on this more
specifically?
LC: It is clear that I do have
name recognition in Palo
Alto — not among everyone,
because we've had a lot of new
comers come in. But my name
recognition I've come by right
eously, meaning it isn't because
I was a judge necessarily. Be
cause, if you asked your aver
age Palo Alto resident to name
five judges — we have 90 —
they couldn't do it. I come by
righteously because I have been
so involved in community from
my work on the bench, but not
connected to it necessarily. I've
been on boards and spoke at
graduations, those kinds of
things. That aside, my concern
is that I'd like democracy to
work — if [someone] decides to
run and people don't know
[her] name, [she] should be able
to run and do so, not because
she's loaded or rich and can
spend the $20,000 or $30,000
that your average person
spends to run for Palo Alto City
Council. Maybe some spend
less than that, but it is [at least]
several thousand dollars and
not everyone has access to that
kind of money. I'm a single par
ent. I'm not loaded. Even if I
could afford to spend $20,000,
I think it's the wrong message
to send. I want to do things an
other way.
I want it to be so that your av
erage person who cares about
what goes on in that person's city
or town can jump into the play

and run, because that's what
democracy is about. Let me give
you an example: lawn signs. In
Palo Alto, people have said that
you've got to have lawn signs,
and you need at least 300, maybe
400. Well, I checked into prices
on lawn signs and sure, if I had a
couple thousand dollars I wanted
to spend just on the lawn signs, I
could do that. But I'm not going
to do that, because I think there
is another way. And the way I've
chosen is a way that will involve
young people in learning about
civics and about city government.
What I've done is I've tapped
into a wonderful resource:
teenagers. And a group of
teenagers is going to meet next
week on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, and we are going to
make 300 lawn signs .... My
lawn signs will be handmade,
they will be individual in that
people will design whatever they
want on them, and then we will
send them all over the city. And
no, it's not a slick printed compa
ny made lawn sign, but this is
something that anyone could do
if you organized a group of
kids. . . [We] will have a very di
verse group of young people get
ting involved at the local level of
politics and doing stuff a differ
ent way.
TD: In closing, is there any one
characteristic or previous experi
ence that you believe is the most
important thing that prepares
you for this job or sets you apart
from your fellow candidates?
LC: Clearly, one thing that sets
me apart is that I've been a judge
for almost 20 years, and so I
bring to the city council those
skills. One of the skills I talked to
you about was working with dys
functional families and all. But
there are others, such as being
able to make a decision — you
know, the worst judges are the
ones that hate making a decision,
but that's all we [judges] do. I
have developed an ability to

make a decision and to not drag
things out, because as a judge
you just can't do that. The other
thing I bring is a skill that when 1
make decisions, they have to be
evidence based — they have to
be objective. In court, I had peo
ple just yelling that this is right or
that this is right, and here I am in
the center thinking what is the
right thing to do. Well, I had to
that for almost 20 years. What
came out of that was that I
emerged with a reputation for
integrity; for being able to make
decisions that are fair and objec
tive. That's pretty good when
you consider that every time a
judge makes a decision, some
body's happy and somebody
hates you. But still being able to
have that reputation is signifi
cant, so those are the kinds of
skills I bring.
Let me finally say this: that
whenever I was asked by the
media — be it newspaper, tele
vision or radio — to have some
thing televised or publicized, 1
never declined a request unless
the law prohibited the proceed
ing being a public meeting, be
cause I am a firm believer in the
First Amendment. I am a firm
advocate of government that is
transparent. The reason for
that is, if you have a system that
is not transparent, that means
you are not accountable to the
public, and a system that is not
accountable is ripe for corrup
tion. I bring that same attitude
with me to city government. I
believe in transparency. 1 be
lieve that anything I do, I have
to be able explain it to you and
you will know about it. 1 hat s
fair government ....
I don't see the city council job
as one that is adversarial in na
ture. Yes, people are going to dis
agree. Yes, there will be develop
ers who really want to do muc 1)
more than what others say they
want them to do. The key is to
find a balance that everyone can
live with to make the city a good
place in which to live.

these are not necessarily in order of prior
ity. The first reason is that I have lived in
Palo Alto for 20 years, and during those 20
years I raised my two daughters, who at
tended public schools in Palo Alto — actu
ally, even before public schools, from the
Palo Alto Community Childcare Center
all the way to graduating from Gunn High
5ch001.... This is a community in which
I chose to live and chose to stay because it
has so much to offer, and the potential for
it to even offer more is tremendous. So it
is a community of which I care very much
and have invested 20 years of my life.
Second, I was raised in a family — 1 am
one of three children; I have two sisters, I
am in the middle — in a suburb outside of
Philadelphia by parents who supported
the family by running a dry cleaning busi
ness in the community — it was primarily
a black community — whose clientele also
were people who lived on the main line.
The main line is where old money in this
country is; you're talking about the Heinz
family and the DuPont family and all
those. What I had learned by example —
my parents did not preach to us — I had
learned that it is so important to give back
to the community and do public service.
How I'd learned it is that the dry cleaning
service ended up becoming the center of
political activity in the community in
which I grew up. So, if there were an inci
dent with the police, if someone from the
community were running for political of
fice, Spring Cleaners — the name of my
parents' business — ended up being the
focal point where people would gather to
deal with things political and also just
things that affected the community. I saw
my parents, by example, giving back to
the community. And we often heard that
since their children — that's the three of
us — had the benefit of the best education
you could get probably anywhere in the
world, it was our responsibility to use that
education to help others to do better.
Number three, I have given almost 20
years of my life to working in the public
interest and for public service. My actual
tenure on the bench fell just short of 19
years, but for 19 years I was a public ser
vant. I worked for all the people who live
in this entire county and feel very strong
ly— and doing that for 18 years as a

Stanford Law graduate, I probably could
have gone and made a whole lot more
money working in the private sector. I de
clined to do so because 1 enjoyed being a
judge, and second, the whole notion of
working for the public good was very im
portant to me. So here I am back again, I
gave up that career and retired. I've been
back at Stanford for two and a half years
and I am very concerned about the direc
tion in which I see city government going
and believe that I can help and make a
difference.
The fourth reason; I read a book by
Michael Moore called "Stupid White
Men," and it is a very good book
Michael Moore, of whom I am a fan,
talked about the rather dismal state of af
fairs in the world, specifically in this na
tion, and he is very hard on the Bush ad
ministration. I am of the same mind — I
am a liberal Democrat, I am a feminist. He
in his book wrote about all the things that
he sees as being not good, but he doesn't
just whine and complain .... I really took
back the message, which is 'get out there
and do something.' I believe that you can
bring about change by starting on the
local level, and you can't get more local
than getting involved in city politics. For
example, the theme of my campaign is
"Another way." There has got to be an
other way to do things in the political
arena. So, for example, I am disgusted
with campaign financing in this nation. It
is completely out of hand, excessive
amounts of money being raised for what,
to help someone get a political office? You
have people who are starving and organi
zations that desperately need money,
non-profits that help people, but no, we
give money to people who send out slick
brochures. That is not where I am head
ed. So, I am accepting no money for my
campaign. Whatever I can do, I do it — I
tap the energy, time and talent of people
because I think democracy is really based
on all of that....
Another reason I got involved is be
cause I believe I can bring to the city coun
cil the skills that I utilized when I was on
the bench. I presided in family court,
which is the most dysfunctional group of
families you will ever see — go sit and
watch family court. I presided for three
years and I ended up settling a record
number of causes, 96 percent, when I was
the supervising judge in family court.
That is a remarkable number, and it
shows that I have the ability even to take
the most dysfunctional people and, in the
majority of cases, at least come to some
resolution. That is another skill that I be
lieve I bring.
I oversee five offices here, and the
word came out from the mountain on
high at Stanford, budget cuts — had to
cut budgets last year and this year. I was
able, working with a wonderful staff, to
implement budget cuts that the Universi-
ty wanted. But at the same time,
I did so without sacrificing ser
vices because my offices serve
people.
TD: Could you expand more on
the specific issues and legislative
agenda that you will take up, if
elected?
LC: There are some very serious
concerns I have that I think are
really hot-button issues for Palo
Alto. One of them is develop
ment — a lot of people, particu
larly those in the neighbor
hoods, are concerned about
overdevelopment to the point
where the neighborhoods that
so characterize Palo Alto and
make it such a wonderful place
to live become jeopardized by so
much development. I do believe
in development, I think it is
good for any city because it
brings you your tax base, which
generates the money and en
ables you to run the city and pro
vide all kinds of services. But at
the same time, there has to be a
balance between development
and looking at the needs and
quality of life of neighborhoods.
So, 1 am for development, but
not overdevelopment.
Another big issue in Palo Alto
is something called the
'Charleston corridor,' and this
Charleston Avenue is a long
street that has on it approximate
ly seven schools, and I live along
that corridor and my children
went to school along it. And over
the years, traffic has almost grid
locked, particularly in the morn
ing. And maybe that is the way it
has to be, but I am concerned
about the safety of children
who've got to cross Charleston to
be able to get to these schools, so
something has to be done, and
that is certainly high on the list —
not just my list, but that of city

council people, and at which
they've been looking at fora year
or more about the impact of traf
fic along the Charleston corridor.
And there are many other is
sues in terms of neighborhoods,
traffic, quality of life, retail ser
vices and what we want Palo Alto
to look like and to be. So those
are issues that I haven't staked a
position or a hard line on be
cause I think that would be a mis
take. I think once elected and
you're new to city council, you
shut up, you listen, you learn,
you talk to staff and then you fig
ure out what the issues are, and
then you don't just make up your
mind about what's best for peo
ple, that's arrogant. What you do
is you talk to people on both
sides — [all] sides — of the is
sues to try to arrive at what you
think is probably best for the
community.
TD: A number of the areas that
you mentioned, such as devel
opment and traffic concerns,
are issues that are very relevant
to the Stanford community.
What are your views on these
concerns and how would your
connection with Stanford affect
your decisions?
LC: I have an easy out on this
one, but first, let me tell you that
what you just said about how
Stanford and Palo Alto impact
each other — it is a big impact,
and we know that. There was
Sand Hill Road, which tended
to bring a lot of tension between
those who live in Stanford or are
connected with Stanford and
those who live without. So yes,
anything Palo Alto does or Stan
ford does, they impact on each
other. They can't be done in a
vacuum. Now, I have an easy
out on this, because if I am elect
ed, I cannot vote on any matter
that affects Stanford. Under the
law, I have to [not vote]. As long
as Stanford is my employer, it is
improper for me to vote on
[such] an issue . . . The law also

says I am not even permitted to
weigh in on public discussion.
For example, when there is pub
lic discussion at a city council
meeting about Stanford doing
x, y or z, I have to leave the
room.
TD: You talked about how you
are not accepting campaign do
nations and that you are going
to use volunteers to pursue
your campaign efforts. Could
you expand on this more
specifically?
LC: It is clear that I do have
name recognition in Palo
Alto — not among everyone,
because we've had a lot of new
comers come in. But my name
recognition I've come by right
eously, meaning it isn't because
I was a judge necessarily. Be
cause, if you asked your aver
age Palo Alto resident to name
five judges — we have 90 —
they couldn't do it. I come by
righteously because I have been
so involved in community from
my work on the bench, but not
connected to it necessarily. I've
been on boards and spoke at
graduations, those kinds of
things. That aside, my concern
is that I'd like democracy to
work — if [someone] decides to
run and people don't know
[her] name, [she] should be able
to run and do so, not because
she's loaded or rich and can
spend the $20,000 or $30,000
that your average person
spends to run for Palo Alto City
Council. Maybe some spend
less than that, but it is [at least]
several thousand dollars and
not everyone has access to that
kind of money. I'm a single par
ent. I'm not loaded. Even if I
could afford to spend $20,000,
I think it's the wrong message
to send. I want to do things an
other way.
I want it to be so that your av
erage person who cares about
what goes on in that person's city
or town can jump into the play

and run, because that's what
democracy is about. Let me give
you an example: lawn signs. In
Palo Alto, people have said that
you've got to have lawn signs,
and you need at least 300, maybe
400. Well, I checked into prices
on lawn signs and sure, if I had a
couple thousand dollars I wanted
to spend just on the lawn signs, I
could do that. But I'm not going
to do that, because I think there
is another way. And the way I've
chosen is a way that will involve
young people in learning about
civics and about city government.
What I've done is I've tapped
into a wonderful resource:
teenagers. And a group of
teenagers is going to meet next
week on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, and we are going to
make 300 lawn signs .... My
lawn signs will be handmade,
they will be individual in that
people will design whatever they
want on them, and then we will
send them all over the city. And
no, it's not a slick printed compa
ny made lawn sign, but this is
something that anyone could do
if you organized a group of
kids. . . [We] will have a very di
verse group of young people get
ting involved at the local level of
politics and doing stuff a differ
ent way.
TD: In closing, is there any one
characteristic or previous experi
ence that you believe is the most
important thing that prepares
you for this job or sets you apart
from your fellow candidates?
LC: Clearly, one thing that sets
me apart is that I've been a judge
for almost 20 years, and so I
bring to the city council those
skills. One of the skills I talked to
you about was working with dys
functional families and all. But
there are others, such as being
able to make a decision — you
know, the worst judges are the
ones that hate making a decision,
but that's all we [judges] do. I
have developed an ability to

make a decision and to not drag
things out, because as a judge
you just can't do that. The other
thing I bring is a skill that when 1
make decisions, they have to be
evidence based — they have to
be objective. In court, I had peo
ple just yelling that this is right or
that this is right, and here I am in
the center thinking what is the
right thing to do. Well, I had to
that for almost 20 years. What
came out of that was that I
emerged with a reputation for
integrity; for being able to make
decisions that are fair and objec
tive. That's pretty good when
you consider that every time a
judge makes a decision, some
body's happy and somebody
hates you. But still being able to
have that reputation is signifi
cant, so those are the kinds of
skills I bring.
Let me finally say this: that
whenever I was asked by the
media — be it newspaper, tele
vision or radio — to have some
thing televised or publicized, 1
never declined a request unless
the law prohibited the proceed
ing being a public meeting, be
cause I am a firm believer in the
First Amendment. I am a firm
advocate of government that is
transparent. The reason for
that is, if you have a system that
is not transparent, that means
you are not accountable to the
public, and a system that is not
accountable is ripe for corrup
tion. I bring that same attitude
with me to city government. I
believe in transparency. 1 be
lieve that anything I do, I have
to be able explain it to you and
you will know about it. 1 hat s
fair government ....
I don't see the city council job
as one that is adversarial in na
ture. Yes, people are going to dis
agree. Yes, there will be develop
ers who really want to do muc 1)
more than what others say they
want them to do. The key is to
find a balance that everyone can
live with to make the city a good
place in which to live.
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with LaDoris Cordell, vice provost
and special counselor to the president for
campus relations. Cordell, j.D. '74, dis
cussed the issues and concerns that she is
addressing in her campaign as a candidate
for the Palo Alto City Council, which has
four seats up for election this November.

is a community of which I care very much
and have invested 20 years of my life.
Second, I was raised in a family — 1 am
one of three children; I have two sisters, I
am in the middle — in a suburb outside of
Philadelphia by parents who supported
the family by running a dry cleaning busi
ness in the community — it was primarily
a black community — whose clientele also
were people who lived on the main line.
The main line is where old money in this
country is; you're talking about the Heinz
family and the DuPont family and all
those. What I had learned by example —
my parents did not preach to us — I had
learned that it is so important to give back
to the community and do public service.
How I'd learned it is that the dry cleaning
service ended up becoming the center of
political activity in the community in
which I grew up. So, if there were an inci
dent with the police, if someone from the
community were running for political of
fice, Spring Cleaners — the name of my
parents' business — ended up being the
focal point where people would gather to
deal with things political and also just
things that affected the community. I saw
my parents, by example, giving back to
the community. And we often heard that
since their children — that's the three of
us — had the benefit of the best education
you could get probably anywhere in the
world, it was our responsibility to use that
education to help others to do better.
Number three, I have given almost 20
years of my life to working in the public
interest and for public service. My actual
tenure on the bench fell just short of 19
years, but for 19 years I was a public ser
vant. I worked for all the people who live
in this entire county and feel very strong
ly— and doing that for 18 years as a

Stanford Law graduate, I probably could
have gone and made a whole lot more
money working in the private sector. I de
clined to do so because 1 enjoyed being a
judge, and second, the whole notion of
working for the public good was very im
portant to me. So here I am back again, I
gave up that career and retired. I've been
back at Stanford for two and a half years
and I am very concerned about the direc
tion in which I see city government going
and believe that I can help and make a
difference.
The fourth reason; I read a book by
Michael Moore called "Stupid White
Men," and it is a very good book
Michael Moore, of whom I am a fan,
talked about the rather dismal state of af
fairs in the world, specifically in this na
tion, and he is very hard on the Bush ad
ministration. I am of the same mind — I
am a liberal Democrat, I am a feminist. He
in his book wrote about all the things that
he sees as being not good, but he doesn't
just whine and complain .... I really took
back the message, which is 'get out there
and do something.' I believe that you can
bring about change by starting on the
local level, and you can't get more local
than getting involved in city politics. For
example, the theme of my campaign is
"Another way." There has got to be an
other way to do things in the political
arena. So, for example, I am disgusted
with campaign financing in this nation. It
is completely out of hand, excessive
amounts of money being raised for what,
to help someone get a political office? You
have people who are starving and organi
zations that desperately need money,
non-profits that help people, but no, we
give money to people who send out slick
brochures. That is not where I am head
ed. So, I am accepting no money for my
campaign. Whatever I can do, I do it — I
tap the energy, time and talent of people
because I think democracy is really based
on all of that....
Another reason I got involved is be
cause I believe I can bring to the city coun
cil the skills that I utilized when I was on
the bench. I presided in family court,
which is the most dysfunctional group of
families you will ever see — go sit and
watch family court. I presided for three
years and I ended up settling a record
number of causes, 96 percent, when I was
the supervising judge in family court.
That is a remarkable number, and it
shows that I have the ability even to take
the most dysfunctional people and, in the
majority of cases, at least come to some
resolution. That is another skill that I be
lieve I bring.
I oversee five offices here, and the
word came out from the mountain on
high at Stanford, budget cuts — had to
cut budgets last year and this year. I was
able, working with a wonderful staff, to
implement budget cuts that the Universi-
ty wanted. But at the same time,
I did so without sacrificing ser
vices because my offices serve
people.
TD: Could you expand more on
the specific issues and legislative
agenda that you will take up, if
elected?
LC: There are some very serious
concerns I have that I think are
really hot-button issues for Palo
Alto. One of them is develop
ment — a lot of people, particu
larly those in the neighbor
hoods, are concerned about
overdevelopment to the point
where the neighborhoods that
so characterize Palo Alto and
make it such a wonderful place
to live become jeopardized by so
much development. I do believe
in development, I think it is
good for any city because it
brings you your tax base, which
generates the money and en
ables you to run the city and pro
vide all kinds of services. But at
the same time, there has to be a
balance between development
and looking at the needs and
quality of life of neighborhoods.
So, 1 am for development, but
not overdevelopment.
Another big issue in Palo Alto
is something called the
'Charleston corridor,' and this
Charleston Avenue is a long
street that has on it approximate
ly seven schools, and I live along
that corridor and my children
went to school along it. And over
the years, traffic has almost grid
locked, particularly in the morn
ing. And maybe that is the way it
has to be, but I am concerned
about the safety of children
who've got to cross Charleston to
be able to get to these schools, so
something has to be done, and
that is certainly high on the list —
not just my list, but that of city

council people, and at which
they've been looking at fora year
or more about the impact of traf
fic along the Charleston corridor.
And there are many other is
sues in terms of neighborhoods,
traffic, quality of life, retail ser
vices and what we want Palo Alto
to look like and to be. So those
are issues that I haven't staked a
position or a hard line on be
cause I think that would be a mis
take. I think once elected and
you're new to city council, you
shut up, you listen, you learn,
you talk to staff and then you fig
ure out what the issues are, and
then you don't just make up your
mind about what's best for peo
ple, that's arrogant. What you do
is you talk to people on both
sides — [all] sides — of the is
sues to try to arrive at what you
think is probably best for the
community.
TD: A number of the areas that
you mentioned, such as devel
opment and traffic concerns,
are issues that are very relevant
to the Stanford community.
What are your views on these
concerns and how would your
connection with Stanford affect
your decisions?
LC: I have an easy out on this
one, but first, let me tell you that
what you just said about how
Stanford and Palo Alto impact
each other — it is a big impact,
and we know that. There was
Sand Hill Road, which tended
to bring a lot of tension between
those who live in Stanford or are
connected with Stanford and
those who live without. So yes,
anything Palo Alto does or Stan
ford does, they impact on each
other. They can't be done in a
vacuum. Now, I have an easy
out on this, because if I am elect
ed, I cannot vote on any matter
that affects Stanford. Under the
law, I have to [not vote]. As long
as Stanford is my employer, it is
improper for me to vote on
[such] an issue . . . The law also

says I am not even permitted to
weigh in on public discussion.
For example, when there is pub
lic discussion at a city council
meeting about Stanford doing
x, y or z, I have to leave the
room.
TD: You talked about how you
are not accepting campaign do
nations and that you are going
to use volunteers to pursue
your campaign efforts. Could
you expand on this more
specifically?
LC: It is clear that I do have
name recognition in Palo
Alto — not among everyone,
because we've had a lot of new
comers come in. But my name
recognition I've come by right
eously, meaning it isn't because
I was a judge necessarily. Be
cause, if you asked your aver
age Palo Alto resident to name
five judges — we have 90 —
they couldn't do it. I come by
righteously because I have been
so involved in community from
my work on the bench, but not
connected to it necessarily. I've
been on boards and spoke at
graduations, those kinds of
things. That aside, my concern
is that I'd like democracy to
work — if [someone] decides to
run and people don't know
[her] name, [she] should be able
to run and do so, not because
she's loaded or rich and can
spend the $20,000 or $30,000
that your average person
spends to run for Palo Alto City
Council. Maybe some spend
less than that, but it is [at least]
several thousand dollars and
not everyone has access to that
kind of money. I'm a single par
ent. I'm not loaded. Even if I
could afford to spend $20,000,
I think it's the wrong message
to send. I want to do things an
other way.
I want it to be so that your av
erage person who cares about
what goes on in that person's city
or town can jump into the play

and run, because that's what
democracy is about. Let me give
you an example: lawn signs. In
Palo Alto, people have said that
you've got to have lawn signs,
and you need at least 300, maybe
400. Well, I checked into prices
on lawn signs and sure, if I had a
couple thousand dollars I wanted
to spend just on the lawn signs, I
could do that. But I'm not going
to do that, because I think there
is another way. And the way I've
chosen is a way that will involve
young people in learning about
civics and about city government.
What I've done is I've tapped
into a wonderful resource:
teenagers. And a group of
teenagers is going to meet next
week on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, and we are going to
make 300 lawn signs .... My
lawn signs will be handmade,
they will be individual in that
people will design whatever they
want on them, and then we will
send them all over the city. And
no, it's not a slick printed compa
ny made lawn sign, but this is
something that anyone could do
if you organized a group of
kids. . . [We] will have a very di
verse group of young people get
ting involved at the local level of
politics and doing stuff a differ
ent way.
TD: In closing, is there any one
characteristic or previous experi
ence that you believe is the most
important thing that prepares
you for this job or sets you apart
from your fellow candidates?
LC: Clearly, one thing that sets
me apart is that I've been a judge
for almost 20 years, and so I
bring to the city council those
skills. One of the skills I talked to
you about was working with dys
functional families and all. But
there are others, such as being
able to make a decision — you
know, the worst judges are the
ones that hate making a decision,
but that's all we [judges] do. I
have developed an ability to

make a decision and to not drag
things out, because as a judge
you just can't do that. The other
thing I bring is a skill that when 1
make decisions, they have to be
evidence based — they have to
be objective. In court, I had peo
ple just yelling that this is right or
that this is right, and here I am in
the center thinking what is the
right thing to do. Well, I had to
that for almost 20 years. What
came out of that was that I
emerged with a reputation for
integrity; for being able to make
decisions that are fair and objec
tive. That's pretty good when
you consider that every time a
judge makes a decision, some
body's happy and somebody
hates you. But still being able to
have that reputation is signifi
cant, so those are the kinds of
skills I bring.
Let me finally say this: that
whenever I was asked by the
media — be it newspaper, tele
vision or radio — to have some
thing televised or publicized, 1
never declined a request unless
the law prohibited the proceed
ing being a public meeting, be
cause I am a firm believer in the
First Amendment. I am a firm
advocate of government that is
transparent. The reason for
that is, if you have a system that
is not transparent, that means
you are not accountable to the
public, and a system that is not
accountable is ripe for corrup
tion. I bring that same attitude
with me to city government. I
believe in transparency. 1 be
lieve that anything I do, I have
to be able explain it to you and
you will know about it. 1 hat s
fair government ....
I don't see the city council job
as one that is adversarial in na
ture. Yes, people are going to dis
agree. Yes, there will be develop
ers who really want to do muc 1)
more than what others say they
want them to do. The key is to
find a balance that everyone can
live with to make the city a good
place in which to live.
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with LaDoris Cordell, vice provost
and special counselor to the president for
campus relations. Cordell, j.D. '74, dis
cussed the issues and concerns that she is
addressing in her campaign as a candidate
for the Palo Alto City Council, which has
four seats up for election this November.
The Daily: Why did you decide to run for
the Palo Alto City Council?
LaDoris Cordell: There are probably at
least three reasons, maybe four — and
these are not necessarily in order of prior
ity. The first reason is that I have lived in
Palo Alto for 20 years, and during those 20
years I raised my two daughters, who at
tended public schools in Palo Alto — actu
ally, even before public schools, from the
Palo Alto Community Childcare Center
all the way to graduating from Gunn High
5ch001.... This is a community in which
I chose to live and chose to stay because it
has so much to offer, and the potential for
it to even offer more is tremendous. So it
is a community of which I care very much
and have invested 20 years of my life.

family and the DuPont family and all
those. What I had learned by example —
my parents did not preach to us — I had
learned that it is so important to give back
to the community and do public service.
How I'd learned it is that the dry cleaning
service ended up becoming the center of
political activity in the community in
which I grew up. So, if there were an inci
dent with the police, if someone from the
community were running for political of
fice, Spring Cleaners — the name of my
parents' business — ended up being the
focal point where people would gather to
deal with things political and also just
things that affected the community. I saw
my parents, by example, giving back to
the community. And we often heard that
since their children — that's the three of
us — had the benefit of the best education
you could get probably anywhere in the
world, it was our responsibility to use that
education to help others to do better.
Number three, I have given almost 20
years of my life to working in the public
interest and for public service. My actual
tenure on the bench fell just short of 19
years, but for 19 years I was a public ser
vant. I worked for all the people who live
in this entire county and feel very strong
ly— and doing that for 18 years as a

Stanford Law graduate, I probably could
have gone and made a whole lot more
money working in the private sector. I de
clined to do so because 1 enjoyed being a
judge, and second, the whole notion of
working for the public good was very im
portant to me. So here I am back again, I
gave up that career and retired. I've been
back at Stanford for two and a half years
and I am very concerned about the direc
tion in which I see city government going
and believe that I can help and make a
difference.
The fourth reason; I read a book by
Michael Moore called "Stupid White
Men," and it is a very good book
Michael Moore, of whom I am a fan,
talked about the rather dismal state of af
fairs in the world, specifically in this na
tion, and he is very hard on the Bush ad
ministration. I am of the same mind — I
am a liberal Democrat, I am a feminist. He
in his book wrote about all the things that
he sees as being not good, but he doesn't
just whine and complain .... I really took
back the message, which is 'get out there
and do something.' I believe that you can
bring about change by starting on the
local level, and you can't get more local
than getting involved in city politics. For
example, the theme of my campaign is
"Another way." There has got to be an
other way to do things in the political
arena. So, for example, I am disgusted
with campaign financing in this nation. It
is completely out of hand, excessive
amounts of money being raised for what,
to help someone get a political office? You
have people who are starving and organi
zations that desperately need money,
non-profits that help people, but no, we
give money to people who send out slick
brochures. That is not where I am head
ed. So, I am accepting no money for my
campaign. Whatever I can do, I do it — I
tap the energy, time and talent of people
because I think democracy is really based
on all of that....
Another reason I got involved is be
cause I believe I can bring to the city coun
cil the skills that I utilized when I was on
the bench. I presided in family court,
which is the most dysfunctional group of
families you will ever see — go sit and
watch family court. I presided for three
years and I ended up settling a record
number of causes, 96 percent, when I was
the supervising judge in family court.
That is a remarkable number, and it
shows that I have the ability even to take
the most dysfunctional people and, in the
majority of cases, at least come to some
resolution. That is another skill that I be
lieve I bring.
I oversee five offices here, and the
word came out from the mountain on
high at Stanford, budget cuts — had to
cut budgets last year and this year. I was
able, working with a wonderful staff, to
implement budget cuts that the Universi-
ty wanted. But at the same time,
I did so without sacrificing ser
vices because my offices serve
people.
TD: Could you expand more on
the specific issues and legislative
agenda that you will take up, if
elected?
LC: There are some very serious
concerns I have that I think are
really hot-button issues for Palo
Alto. One of them is develop
ment — a lot of people, particu
larly those in the neighbor
hoods, are concerned about
overdevelopment to the point
where the neighborhoods that
so characterize Palo Alto and
make it such a wonderful place
to live become jeopardized by so
much development. I do believe
in development, I think it is
good for any city because it
brings you your tax base, which
generates the money and en
ables you to run the city and pro
vide all kinds of services. But at
the same time, there has to be a
balance between development
and looking at the needs and
quality of life of neighborhoods.
So, 1 am for development, but
not overdevelopment.
Another big issue in Palo Alto
is something called the
'Charleston corridor,' and this
Charleston Avenue is a long
street that has on it approximate
ly seven schools, and I live along
that corridor and my children
went to school along it. And over
the years, traffic has almost grid
locked, particularly in the morn
ing. And maybe that is the way it
has to be, but I am concerned
about the safety of children
who've got to cross Charleston to
be able to get to these schools, so
something has to be done, and
that is certainly high on the list —
not just my list, but that of city

council people, and at which
they've been looking at fora year
or more about the impact of traf
fic along the Charleston corridor.
And there are many other is
sues in terms of neighborhoods,
traffic, quality of life, retail ser
vices and what we want Palo Alto
to look like and to be. So those
are issues that I haven't staked a
position or a hard line on be
cause I think that would be a mis
take. I think once elected and
you're new to city council, you
shut up, you listen, you learn,
you talk to staff and then you fig
ure out what the issues are, and
then you don't just make up your
mind about what's best for peo
ple, that's arrogant. What you do
is you talk to people on both
sides — [all] sides — of the is
sues to try to arrive at what you
think is probably best for the
community.
TD: A number of the areas that
you mentioned, such as devel
opment and traffic concerns,
are issues that are very relevant
to the Stanford community.
What are your views on these
concerns and how would your
connection with Stanford affect
your decisions?
LC: I have an easy out on this
one, but first, let me tell you that
what you just said about how
Stanford and Palo Alto impact
each other — it is a big impact,
and we know that. There was
Sand Hill Road, which tended
to bring a lot of tension between
those who live in Stanford or are
connected with Stanford and
those who live without. So yes,
anything Palo Alto does or Stan
ford does, they impact on each
other. They can't be done in a
vacuum. Now, I have an easy
out on this, because if I am elect
ed, I cannot vote on any matter
that affects Stanford. Under the
law, I have to [not vote]. As long
as Stanford is my employer, it is
improper for me to vote on
[such] an issue . . . The law also

says I am not even permitted to
weigh in on public discussion.
For example, when there is pub
lic discussion at a city council
meeting about Stanford doing
x, y or z, I have to leave the
room.
TD: You talked about how you
are not accepting campaign do
nations and that you are going
to use volunteers to pursue
your campaign efforts. Could
you expand on this more
specifically?
LC: It is clear that I do have
name recognition in Palo
Alto — not among everyone,
because we've had a lot of new
comers come in. But my name
recognition I've come by right
eously, meaning it isn't because
I was a judge necessarily. Be
cause, if you asked your aver
age Palo Alto resident to name
five judges — we have 90 —
they couldn't do it. I come by
righteously because I have been
so involved in community from
my work on the bench, but not
connected to it necessarily. I've
been on boards and spoke at
graduations, those kinds of
things. That aside, my concern
is that I'd like democracy to
work — if [someone] decides to
run and people don't know
[her] name, [she] should be able
to run and do so, not because
she's loaded or rich and can
spend the $20,000 or $30,000
that your average person
spends to run for Palo Alto City
Council. Maybe some spend
less than that, but it is [at least]
several thousand dollars and
not everyone has access to that
kind of money. I'm a single par
ent. I'm not loaded. Even if I
could afford to spend $20,000,
I think it's the wrong message
to send. I want to do things an
other way.
I want it to be so that your av
erage person who cares about
what goes on in that person's city
or town can jump into the play

and run, because that's what
democracy is about. Let me give
you an example: lawn signs. In
Palo Alto, people have said that
you've got to have lawn signs,
and you need at least 300, maybe
400. Well, I checked into prices
on lawn signs and sure, if I had a
couple thousand dollars I wanted
to spend just on the lawn signs, I
could do that. But I'm not going
to do that, because I think there
is another way. And the way I've
chosen is a way that will involve
young people in learning about
civics and about city government.
What I've done is I've tapped
into a wonderful resource:
teenagers. And a group of
teenagers is going to meet next
week on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday, and we are going to
make 300 lawn signs .... My
lawn signs will be handmade,
they will be individual in that
people will design whatever they
want on them, and then we will
send them all over the city. And
no, it's not a slick printed compa
ny made lawn sign, but this is
something that anyone could do
if you organized a group of
kids. . . [We] will have a very di
verse group of young people get
ting involved at the local level of
politics and doing stuff a differ
ent way.
TD: In closing, is there any one
characteristic or previous experi
ence that you believe is the most
important thing that prepares
you for this job or sets you apart
from your fellow candidates?
LC: Clearly, one thing that sets
me apart is that I've been a judge
for almost 20 years, and so I
bring to the city council those
skills. One of the skills I talked to
you about was working with dys
functional families and all. But
there are others, such as being
able to make a decision — you
know, the worst judges are the
ones that hate making a decision,
but that's all we [judges] do. I
have developed an ability to

make a decision and to not drag
things out, because as a judge
you just can't do that. The other
thing I bring is a skill that when 1
make decisions, they have to be
evidence based — they have to
be objective. In court, I had peo
ple just yelling that this is right or
that this is right, and here I am in
the center thinking what is the
right thing to do. Well, I had to
that for almost 20 years. What
came out of that was that I
emerged with a reputation for
integrity; for being able to make
decisions that are fair and objec
tive. That's pretty good when
you consider that every time a
judge makes a decision, some
body's happy and somebody
hates you. But still being able to
have that reputation is signifi
cant, so those are the kinds of
skills I bring.
Let me finally say this: that
whenever I was asked by the
media — be it newspaper, tele
vision or radio — to have some
thing televised or publicized, 1
never declined a request unless
the law prohibited the proceed
ing being a public meeting, be
cause I am a firm believer in the
First Amendment. I am a firm
advocate of government that is
transparent. The reason for
that is, if you have a system that
is not transparent, that means
you are not accountable to the
public, and a system that is not
accountable is ripe for corrup
tion. I bring that same attitude
with me to city government. I
believe in transparency. 1 be
lieve that anything I do, I have
to be able explain it to you and
you will know about it. 1 hat s
fair government ....
I don't see the city council job
as one that is adversarial in na
ture. Yes, people are going to dis
agree. Yes, there will be develop
ers who really want to do muc 1)
more than what others say they
want them to do. The key is to
find a balance that everyone can
live with to make the city a good
place in which to live.
