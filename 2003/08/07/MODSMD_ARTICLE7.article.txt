# Ellis explains his political aims
## 
### KAREN WANG 
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with Jodie Ellis, Class of '03. Ellis
discussed the issues and concerns that he
is addressing in his preliminary campaign
efforts as he considers declaring a candi
dacy for the Palo Alto City Council.
The Daily: Why are you considering run
ning for the Palo Alto City Council?
Jodie Ellis: As much as I have understood
it, the Palo Alto City Council has had a
hard time agreeing on a lot of things in the
city in general. That obviously indicates to
me that . . . city council is not functioning
as efficiently and as well as it can .... I've
also noticed that though the city of Palo
Alto caters largely to the voting popula
tion, which is people 35 years or older. Be
cause of that, I feel like there is an imbal
ance as far as people our age .... But
there are a lot of college students in this
town, not just at Stanford, but that go to
Foothill and that go to a lot of other places.
I just feel like that there's not too [many]
perspectives that are being offered to city
council at this point....
I also just have a large interest in poli
tics and actively participating. You can
study political science as much as you
want, but you can't really get any sort of
actual hands-on knowledge of how poli
tics works and how to make a government
function well just by studying books and
studying what other people have found.
[It] is all very interesting and helpful, but
I feel like the best way to learn about
things is to definitely do them hands on,
and so I figured, why not jump right in?
Politics is something I'm very interested
in. I've always been pretty active in it until
I got to Stanford, and then for some rea
son I was really isolated in the Stanford
community, and [the Stanford communi
ty itself] is really isolated .... But there
are a lot of people who would like to go
out in Palo Alto and like to be able to use
Palo Alto as a great resource for, you
know, going out to eat or shop or do what
ever. And the city of Palo Alto is missing
out on a lot of revenue from not catering
more to these people, but also [the city] is
not making it a comfortable place for
these people to live and is isolating them
from the city itself and is making them not
necessarily want to be a part of what is
going on.
TD: How does this election fit in with your
future political goals and ambitions?
JE: I would definitely say it is part of fu
ture goals and ambitions, especially con
cerning politics .... Beyond politics,
there's something you can get out of any
situation just by trying and trying to be a
part of it. The fastest and easiest way for
me to learn, not only about myself, but
how to work around other people and
work around the people I'm living with, is

definitely to get hands on and really be
come an active part in whatever problem
we are trying to solve. In the future, I def
initely want to be a part of politics. But be
yond that, I want to continue to learn how
to make each day of my life a little bit more
— it sounds pretty idealistic, but [it
makes] each day of my life a little bit easi
er to kind of maneuver about daily life and
solve problems as they come up. 1 defi
nitely do think this is the first step in what
I hope will be a political career.
TD: What do you hope to contribute to
the dynamic of the city council?
JE: I would contribute a unique perspec
tive that, as of this moment, there are no
other candidates that can offer, which is
the perspective of a 22-year-old who just
graduated from Stanford after living in
Palo Alto for four years and not really feel
ing like they were a part of the town.
There are a lot of people who have that
perspective, but they are not on city coun
cil and they are not in the city government
or actively participating.
Coming from a family of nine people,
I have a lot of experience in dealing with
a lot of different opinions within one
small room .... I have learned that
there is never a situation where you and
many other people who bring to the
table many different opinion and many
different ideas are going to be able to
come up with one solution that absolute
ly meets all the criteria of what everyone
wants. 1 have definitely learned a lot
about compromise, but also how to facil
itate compromise, and I think that is
something that is important, especially
given the fact that so much of what I've
heard about the Palo Alto City Council
has been descriptions of a "dysfunction
al" city council, of a "bickering" city
council or a city council that cannot
agree on anything. I feel like even hav
ing somebody there who, [given, is] a bit
inexperienced as far as actual politics in
the city of Palo Alto, but someone who
brings to the table 22 years of experience
of living a life where every single day I've
been forced to make many many com
promises with large groups of people
who I'm intimately involved with and
who also I am not intimately involved
with ....
On a daily basis I've had to . . . bring a
lot of people together to make a decision
collectively, whether it's going out with
my friends or whether it's try to make a
new law happen in the state of New Mex
ico when I was growing up. There [were]
plenty of times when it was very rigidly
bringing people together fora compro
mise and a lot of other times when it was
much more casual, where you wouldn't
necessarily recognize it as bringing peo
ple together fora compromise in a politi
cal sense ... It does take a certain sort of
person to be able to get nine dif
ferent people to decide even on .
. . where are we going out to eat.
It does take a certain level of get
ting people to see eye to eye
enough. I think I can bring
something like that to the table.
I'm a comfortable person to be
around .... [I am] 22 years old,
no experience in politics, but. . .
. I don't think that is necessarily
necessary from every single city
council member. Everybody is
supposed to bring something
different and the more perspec
tive that you bring to something
like city council where you are
making decisions fora very large
group of people, the more per
spectives that you have, the bet
ter the decisions are going to be
dispersed as far as pleasing a
greater number of people.
TD: C -an you expand on your for
mer political involvement in New
Mexico?
JE: I was very active in two par
ticular issues in New Mexico.
When I was a youth governor of
New Mexico, I helped pass two
pieces of legislation that went on
to eventually become two big top
ics in the New Mexico legislature.
One of the legislators from the
youth and government pro
gram . . . went on to do a nation
al law banning drive-up liquor
windows, [which] was one issue.
The other issue, [which] is some
thing that I feel very strongly
about, was the voucher issue for
schools and whether or not
vouchers should be a viable op
tion for the state of New Mexico.
I was fortunate enough to be
asked to speak on the New Mexi
co legislature floor, and gave a 30
minute testimonial on my experi
ence in public school and what it
meant to me to have my public
school education As it

turns out, my testimonial — and
other factors — convinced a lot
of people that vouchers were not
necessarily the right thing for
New Mexico .... Public school
can be a really great thing and
not everyone is made for private
school and private school is not
necessarily better by default....
More concentration should go in
to improving public school rather
than spending money to allow
people to go to private schools
and ditch the public school so
they become worse.
TD: What are your views on
some major issues in Palo Alto
right now?
JE: Affordable housing is a large
[issue]. I think that it is very frus
trating that as a recent graduate
from college, I am struggling to
pay rent. I understand that Palo
Alto is a hot bed, it's a place
where a lot of people want to live
and . . . the reason is it is a beau
tiful community and a really nice
area of California — I feel like
there is no reason why someone
should have to struggle hard to
pay rent. I am even much more
fortunate than a lot of other peo
ple who work in Palo Alto, but
cannot afford to live here. I
think that it is something that
should be . . . taken into consid
eration and try to . . . work to so
lutions .... There are so many
people who need to live in Palo
Alto in order to be functioning
members of a successful city, like
teachers . . . Teachers in Palo
Alto have a very hard time get
ting places in Palo Alto and for
teachers to not live in the city
that they teach in is frustrating.
[They] have no idea where their
kids are coming from and it's
also ... a nice perk to be able to
live in the city that you work
in ... . You shouldn't be forced
to commute because housing is
too expensive. Even something
[such as] helping
teachers . . . get mortgages or
housing or programs that help a

certain type of Palo Alto resident
who doesn't make enough
money but ... it is important to
their job and life to be in and live
in Palo Alto and to understand
what it means to be a Palo Alto
citizen ....
Traffic is a big issue, but I
would say more than traffic,
parking. Downtown parking is
horrible, it's really frustrating
[and] it makes people not want
to go downtown. I think that the
retail industry has a really good
opportunity at this point in Palo
Alto. Since the economy boomed
and fell out, there has been a lot
of businesses who have strug
gled to maintain their expensive
slots in downtown Palo Alto and
Palo Alto in general, and I think
now is a good time to try and re
shape the retail community in
Palo Alto .... I really think that
Palo Alto has something unique.
It has a lot of very
almost. . . mom- and pop-like
feeling stores, but it's unfortu
nate that those stores sell things
like antique rugs, things that no
one needs. I definitely would
propose something that would
encourage the preservation of
the uniqueness and kind of
hometown feeling of. . . Palo
Alto stores and retailers and pre
serve that charm, but also to pro
mote an usefulness.
[People] don't want big stores .
. . but want more options like
grocery stores within walking dis
tance . . . There are a lot of rigid
retail laws and the way that the
city council and planning com
mission has it constructed, it's
just pretty hard for anyone to
own a business in PA. You have to
have a lot of money, but on top of
that, you have to continue to do
pretty well, and the only way that
you can do that is to [have] stores
that are useful and stores that are
unique and that invite people in
with something they have to
offer. Retail is another big issue.
Space is a big issue too. There is
not a lot of space in Palo Alto to
do anything. There's not [a] ton

of room for growth, and because
of that, there are a lot of issues
coming up about building size,
how big of a building can we
build in Palo Alto. These are all
things that need to be discussed,
but I do feel would benefit from
the perspective of someone who
isn't necessarily coming from a
very similar place as the rest of
the city council is.
TD: How would you respond to
the statement that many students
in the area want Palo Alto to have
more "college-like" entertain
ment and prices.
JE: 1 definitely do agree that Palo
Alto nightlife needs to improve.
There needs to be
options . . . and Palo Alto, the
city, stands to make a lot of
money and benefit the entire the
city from creating safe places that
people can go at night. Right
now, the options you have to go
out at night are bars, and as cool
as that is tor a lot of people, there
are a lot of other people who
would like to go out to coffee
shops that do stay open late, or
movies in Palo Alto they can go
out to at 11p.m. Any[where] to go
hang out and grab a bite to eat
and . . . really caring about the
nightlife and caring about having
businesses that do want to be
open at night and that cater to
college students is going to bring
more college students out, [and]
is going to make more students
spend their money in Palo Alto
and keep the revenue in Palo Alto
so that it can go right back into
Palo Alto .... Everybody wins.
Why not spend [money] in the
city where you live so that the city
can make money and put that
money right back in to the city so
that the city can come up with
something even better .... It
makes sense to me to capitalize
on a lot of lost opportunity as far
as income for the city and pleas
ing and inviting people who live
in Palo Alto actually come out at
night.

TD: In closing, is there any one
characteristic or previous experi
ence that you believe particularly
qualifies you for this job or sets
you apart from your fellow candi
dates?
JE: I would say far and away the
most unique characteristic that
I'm bringing to the table is
youth — a unique voice of age
and perspective. Even though I
respect and understand the need
for experience, there's plenty of
experience on city council.
There's plenty of people who are
going to be there to say, oh wait
we tried that 10 years ago ...
. But at least I'll be able to come
up with ideas that are .. . driven
from someone who grew up with
things like the Internet around
them.
Especially with [technology
and the Internet] becoming such
a mainstream and especially in
this area ... an important part
of the city and the area, it's defi
nitely my opinion [that] maybe
[I am] not necessarily an expert
in that field, [I] have been living
and grew up with [the Inter
net] ... I was in the grade
school period [when] I didn't
have it, and I saw the birth in
middle school and was actively
learning during the birth. I'm
not someone who was told about
the Internet and did it... It is
part of my education and part of
who I was learning to be. I think
having someone who is 22-years
old, just out of college, brings to
the table a perspective that can
only add to what is already
there. It definitely won't detract.
There is so much experience
and so many other voices of rea
son and guidance in city council
with various aspects but one
thing that I really think it lacks is
a) someone who is good at creat
ing compromise, and b) some
one who brings something as
unique as youth to a city that is
dying for it, and in my opinion
would thrive with just a little
more consideration to people
under 30.
