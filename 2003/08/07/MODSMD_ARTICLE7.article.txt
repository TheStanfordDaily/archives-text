# Ellis explains his political aims

### KAREN WANG 
The Daily conducted a one-on-one in
terview with Jodie Ellis, Class of '03. Ellis
discussed the issues and concerns that he
is addressing in his preliminary campaign
efforts as he considers declaring a candi
dacy for the Palo Alto City Council.
The Daily: Why are you considering run
ning for the Palo Alto City Council?
Jodie Ellis: As much as I have understood
it, the Palo Alto City Council has had a
hard time agreeing on a lot of things in the
city in general. That obviously indicates to
me that . . . city council is not functioning
as efficiently and as well as it can .... I've
also noticed that though the city of Palo
Alto caters largely to the voting popula
tion, which is people 35 years or older. Be
cause of that, I feel like there is an imbal
ance as far as people our age .... But
there are a lot of college students in this
town, not just at Stanford, but that go to
Foothill and that go to a lot of other places.
I just feel like that there's not too [many]
perspectives that are being offered to city
council at this point....
I also just have a large interest in poli
tics and actively participating. You can
study political science as much as you
want, but you can't really get any sort of
actual hands-on knowledge of how poli
tics works and how to make a government
function well just by studying books and
studying what other people have found.
[It] is all very interesting and helpful, but
I feel like the best way to learn about
things is to definitely do them hands on,
and so I figured, why not jump right in?
Politics is something I'm very interested
in. I've always been pretty active in it until
I got to Stanford, and then for some rea
son I was really isolated in the Stanford
community, and [the Stanford communi
ty itself] is really isolated .... But there
are a lot of people who would like to go
out in Palo Alto and like to be able to use
Palo Alto as a great resource for, you
know, going out to eat or shop or do what
ever. And the city of Palo Alto is missing
out on a lot of revenue from not catering
more to these people, but also [the city] is
not making it a comfortable place for
these people to live and is isolating them
from the city itself and is making them not
necessarily want to be a part of what is
going on.
TD: How does this election fit in with your
future political goals and ambitions?
JE: I would definitely say it is part of fu
ture goals and ambitions, especially con
cerning politics .... Beyond politics,
there's something you can get out of any
situation just by trying and trying to be a
part of it. The fastest and easiest way for
me to learn, not only about myself, but
how to work around other people and
work around the people I'm living with, is

definitely to get hands on and really be
come an active part in whatever problem
we are trying to solve. In the future, I def
initely want to be a part of politics. But be
yond that, I want to continue to learn how
to make each day of my life a little bit more
â€” it sounds pretty idealistic, but [it
makes] each day of my life a little bit easi
er to kind of maneuver about daily life and
solve problems as they come up. 1 defi
nitely do think this is the first step in what
I hope will be a political career.
TD: What do you hope to contribute to
the dynamic of the city council?
JE: I would contribute a unique perspec
tive that, as of this moment, there are no
other candidates that can offer, which is
the perspective of a 22-year-old who just
graduated from Stanford after living in
Palo Alto for four years and not really feel
ing like they were a part of the town.
There are a lot of people who have that
perspective, but they are not on city coun
cil and they are not in the city government
or actively participating.
Coming from a family of nine people,
I have a lot of experience in dealing with
a lot of different opinions within one
small room .... I have learned that
there is never a situation where you and
many other people who bring to the
table many different opinion and many
different ideas are going to be able to
come up with one solution that absolute
ly meets all the criteria of what everyone
wants. 1 have definitely learned a lot
about compromise, but also how to facil
itate compromise, and I think that is
something that is important, especially
given the fact that so much of what I've
heard about the Palo Alto City Council
has been descriptions of a "dysfunction
al" city council, of a "bickering" city
council or a city council that cannot
agree on anything. I feel like even hav
ing somebody there who, [given, is] a bit
inexperienced as far as actual politics in
the city of Palo Alto, but someone who
brings to the table 22 years of experience
of living a life where every single day I've
been forced to make many many com
promises with large groups of people
who I'm intimately involved with and
who also I am not intimately involved
with ....
On a daily basis I've had to . . . bring a
lot of people together to make a decision
collectively, whether it's going out with
my friends or whether it's try to make a
new law happen in the state of New Mex
ico when I was growing up. There [were]
plenty of times when it was very rigidly
bringing people together fora compro
mise and a lot of other times when it was
much more casual, where you wouldn't
necessarily recognize it as bringing peo
ple together fora compromise in a politi
cal sense ... It does take a certain sort of
