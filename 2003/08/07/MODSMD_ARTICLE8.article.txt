# Institute, universities spur new drug development

At a time when innovative medications
are buried in clinical trials for years at a
time, the recently conceived PharmaS
TART program links three California
universities and two research organiza
tions in efforts to accelerate the transition
from laboratory breakthroughs to pre
scription drugs.
Initiated by SRI International, a non
profit research institute based in Menlo
Park formerly known as the Stanford Re
search Institute when it was associated
with the University, PharmaSTART con
nects Stanford with the Institute for Quan

titative Biomedical Research, UC-San
Oie ,T " md UC-San Francisco.
"Each one of these academic institu
tions will hopefully contribute possible
products or leads, whether they are work
ing on a drug, a preventative, a device or
diagnostic aids that have the possibility of
being developed into useful additions to
promote human health," said Harry
Greenberg, senior associate dean of re
search at the Stanford School of Medicine.
The program was launched during the
first meeting of the California Life Sci
ences Initiative hosted by SRI and backed
by Governor Gray Davis in 2002.
PharmaSTART offers faculty members
and scientists working on medical discov

eries up to 30 free hours of consultation,
during which they can can map out a plan
to efficiently turn their work into a main
stream product while following guidelines
set out by the Food and Drug Administra
tion. PharmaSTART will also help inde
pendent research projects obtain funding
and resources.
"Universities are realizing that in order
to commercialize more of their inventions
for public use and benefit, they need to
find ways to advance their early stage tech
nologies to the point where investors and
companies will be willing to incur the cost
and risk of bringing those technologies to
market," said Joel Kirschbaum, director of
technology management at UCSF. "Phar

maSTART is one means by which univer
sities can help narrow this development
gap"
The current economic downturn has
turned smaller biotech companies toward
late-stage drug candidates, as they become
increasingly unwilling to take chances on
preclinical or experimental candidates,
said Alan Paau, assistant vice chancellor of
technology transfer and intellectual prop
erty services at UCSD. This shift in corpo
rate attitude has buried potentially suc
cessful drugs in the clinical-trial stage.
"The PharmaSTART program will help
dress up these candidates into more at-
tractive targets for established com
panies to acquire for further develop
ment and eventually into useful med
icine for the public," he said.
Kirschbaum also expressed his
hopes that the program will help
bring academic discoveries to the at
tention of pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies who license
and commercialize new technologies,
and have the financial resources to
push them through clinical trials, dis
tribution and eventually sales.
"No specific projects are in the
works right now," Greenberg said.
"We have to wait to see what our fac
ulty suggests, and while some have al
ready made suggestions, there's an
evaluation system to see what our best
leads are and which deserve more at
tention."
Because PharmaSTART has no

funding of its own, members who
want to implement a drug develop
ment plan must finance their own
work, Kirschbaum said. In order to
ease this burden, especially under
the pressure of stringent budget
cuts, SRI will help universities
apply for funds from government
sources.
Although the program appeals
primarily to senior faculty members
and University researchers, Green
berg said it is not unforeseeable that
students will eventually play a role.
"Students will not be specifically
involved in PharmaSTART, since it is
important that students are princi
pally involved in work that directly
advances their education and acade
mic goals," he said. "We would have
to make sure that any work students
would do was central to their acade
mic and educational mission."
While PharmaSTART is a collabo
rative effort between only three Cali
fornia institutions, Kirschbaum said
that it is probable the program will

open up to other universities alter the
project has gotten underway.
"At the present time, the consor
tium is concerned about generating
more work than SRI can reasonably
handle," he said. "If it turns out that
SRI has more than enough capacity
to handle the initial round of projects
from the three universities, then
more than likely other universities
will be allowed to participate, includ
ing other UC campuses."
According to Paau, the participat
ing institutions are still only learning
how to select candidates, coordinate
resources and solicit external funcl
ing.
"[PharmaSTAÃŸT's] ultimate
large-scale impact would be if a new
drug were developed that targeted
an unmet medical need,
Kirschbaum said. "Given the high
failure rate of drug candidates, the
more high quality targets and com
pounds a university can generate, the
greater the likelihood a safe and effi
cacious drug will someday emerge.
