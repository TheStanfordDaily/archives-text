# Institute, universities spur new drug development

At a time when innovative medications
are buried in clinical trials for years at a
time, the recently conceived PharmaS
TART program links three California
universities and two research organiza
tions in efforts to accelerate the transition
from laboratory breakthroughs to pre
scription drugs.
Initiated by SRI International, a non
profit research institute based in Menlo
Park formerly known as the Stanford Re
search Institute when it was associated
with the University, PharmaSTART con
nects Stanford with the Institute for Quan

titative Biomedical Research, UC-San
Oie ,T " md UC-San Francisco.
"Each one of these academic institu
tions will hopefully contribute possible
products or leads, whether they are work
ing on a drug, a preventative, a device or
diagnostic aids that have the possibility of
being developed into useful additions to
promote human health," said Harry
Greenberg, senior associate dean of re
search at the Stanford School of Medicine.
The program was launched during the
first meeting of the California Life Sci
ences Initiative hosted by SRI and backed
by Governor Gray Davis in 2002.
PharmaSTART offers faculty members
and scientists working on medical discov

eries up to 30 free hours of consultation,
during which they can can map out a plan
to efficiently turn their work into a main
stream product while following guidelines
set out by the Food and Drug Administra
tion. PharmaSTART will also help inde
pendent research projects obtain funding
and resources.
"Universities are realizing that in order
to commercialize more of their inventions
for public use and benefit, they need to
find ways to advance their early stage tech
nologies to the point where investors and
companies will be willing to incur the cost
and risk of bringing those technologies to
market," said Joel Kirschbaum, director of
technology management at UCSF. "Phar

maSTART is one means by which univer
sities can help narrow this development
gap"
The current economic downturn has
turned smaller biotech companies toward
late-stage drug candidates, as they become
increasingly unwilling to take chances on
preclinical or experimental candidates,
said Alan Paau, assistant vice chancellor of
technology transfer and intellectual prop
erty services at UCSD. This shift in corpo
rate attitude has buried potentially suc
cessful drugs in the clinical-trial stage.
"The PharmaSTART program will help
dress up these candidates into more at-
