# GCEP observers skeptical of sponsors' true intentions

Editor's Note: This article is the third installment
of a three-week series examining the Global Cli
mate ami Energy Project's current research ef
forts ami opportunities for the 112 uture.
Skeptics of Stanford's Global Climate
and Energy Project may see the upcoming
year as one that makes or breaks their faith
in the $225 million initiative, as program
organizers consider whether to begin re
search into renewable energy technologies.
Almost immediately after its announce
ment, GCEP drew lire from many commit
ted proponents of renewables who feared
that research into fields like wind or solar

energy would never get funding as long as
sponsor corporations like Schlumberger
and ExxonMobil had any control over the
project.
Arguing that both companies have said
on record that renewables are not cur
rently economically practicable, critics
claimed that the companies would thwart
efforts to explore research into these areas
and by doing so prevent Stanford from
helping to create viable technologies that
could substantially reduce greenhouse
gas emissions — the stated purpose of
GCEP.
GCEP organizers — as well as the
sponsor companies — have maintained
that none of the broad areas of research
named at the project's inception are off

the table and will officially consider
whether to allocate some of the project's
unprecedented resources to research
into renewables in the upcoming acade
mic year. Along with two other new top
ics, advanced materials and carbon cap
ture and storage, academics and other re
searchers will discuss where the best op
portunities for university-style research
lie and ultimately will approach a GCEP
advisory committee, comprised of repre
sentatives from the sponsor corporations,
for approval to begin work within one of
the broad areas. GCEP organizers have
emphasized that the committee is expect
ed to approve the recommendation of the
researchers on what areas warrant explo
ration, and that beyond approving a

broad area of investigation the corpora
tions have no control over GCEP re
search.
Debate over what role renewables
should have in preventing climate change
is not confined to the Farm, and discussion
over the direction of GCEP parallels one of
the primary debates over energy use and
global warming: Are renewables the best so
lution, and can they cleanly supply the
world's energy needs?
Much of the disagreement over where
GCEP — a project with an emphasis on
commercial viability — should focus its ef
forts stems from the variety of answers to
these questions.
