# GCEP observers skeptical of sponsors' true intentions
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Note: This article is the third installment
of a three-week series examining the Global Cli
mate ami Energy Project's current research ef
forts ami opportunities for the 112 uture.
Skeptics of Stanford's Global Climate
and Energy Project may see the upcoming
year as one that makes or breaks their faith
in the $225 million initiative, as program
organizers consider whether to begin re
search into renewable energy technologies.
Almost immediately after its announce
ment, GCEP drew lire from many commit
ted proponents of renewables who feared
that research into fields like wind or solar

energy would never get funding as long as
sponsor corporations like Schlumberger
and ExxonMobil had any control over the
project.
Arguing that both companies have said
on record that renewables are not cur
rently economically practicable, critics
claimed that the companies would thwart
efforts to explore research into these areas
and by doing so prevent Stanford from
helping to create viable technologies that
could substantially reduce greenhouse
gas emissions — the stated purpose of
GCEP.
GCEP organizers — as well as the
sponsor companies — have maintained
that none of the broad areas of research
named at the project's inception are off

the table and will officially consider
whether to allocate some of the project's
unprecedented resources to research
into renewables in the upcoming acade
mic year. Along with two other new top
ics, advanced materials and carbon cap
ture and storage, academics and other re
searchers will discuss where the best op
portunities for university-style research
lie and ultimately will approach a GCEP
advisory committee, comprised of repre
sentatives from the sponsor corporations,
for approval to begin work within one of
the broad areas. GCEP organizers have
emphasized that the committee is expect
ed to approve the recommendation of the
researchers on what areas warrant explo
ration, and that beyond approving a

broad area of investigation the corpora
tions have no control over GCEP re
search.
Debate over what role renewables
should have in preventing climate change
is not confined to the Farm, and discussion
over the direction of GCEP parallels one of
the primary debates over energy use and
global warming: Are renewables the best so
lution, and can they cleanly supply the
world's energy needs?
Much of the disagreement over where
GCEP — a project with an emphasis on
commercial viability — should focus its ef
forts stems from the variety of answers to
these questions.
Subsidies, externalities and
supply and demand: differing
perspectives on commercial
viability
While proponents of renew
ables argue that they are both eco
nomically and technologically fea
sible substitutes fora substantial
portion of current fossil-fuel use,
others — including Schlumberg
er and ExxonMobil — claim that
renewables won't be large-scale
suppliers of energy for at least the
next 50 years and that fossil fuels
are essential to meet the interna
tional demand for cheap energy.
That renewable technologies
are cleaner than fossil fuels is not a
point of contention between those
on different sides of the debate
over renewables. Unlike fossil fuel
use, wind and solar energy use
does not produce the carbon diox
ide emissions that are cited as the
primary anthropogenic cause of
climate change.
It is the question of whether re
newable technologies can meet
growing energy needs and if
switching to a renewable-based
economy could occur at an accept
able cost that divides participants
in the energy debate.
To the chagrin of renewable
energy proponents, two GCEP
sponsors have been vocal in their
belief that the widespread use of
renewables is far off.
"Even with efficiency gains, we
expect that the world's demand for
energy will reach close to 290 mil
lion barrels per day of oil equivalent
by 2020 — or about 40 percent
more than today," said ExxonMobil
Chairman and CEO L,ee Raymond
in a June speech to the World Gas
Conference. "We expect oil and
gas — representing 60 percent of
energy supplies today — to remain
the dominant energy source, at least
through the mid-century.
"Wind and solar will likely con
tinue to grow very rapidly, but
only due to government policies
and incentives, not market forces
or economics. However, even with
double-digit growth rates, wind
and solar are unlikely to exceed a
1-percent share of the world's en
ergy needs by 2020."
Euan Baird, the chairman and
CEO of Schlumberger, a global
oilfield and information services
company, gave a similarly skepti
cal prediction in a September
speech to the World Petroleum
Conference.
"Fossil fuels are the only credi
ble candidate for cheap, clean en
ergy, in the required quantities,
over the next 50 years," Baird said.
According to Cynthia Lang
lands, a spokeswoman for Exxon-
Mobil, "There are no research
areas off the table. Solar and wind

will be explored as part of a full
portfolio of energy options. In our
experience, those technologies
are not yet commercially viable for
widespread deployment."
Cil Masters, an emeritus pro
fessor of civil and environmental
engineering who has been vocal
on campus in supporting green
buildings and improved energy
efficiency, argued the appraisals
of renewables by ExxonMobil,
Schlumberger and other skeptics
sell current technology short.
"I'm miffed at their characteri
zation of renewables, which I
think is inaccurate. I'm a little con
cerned about some of the com
ments that have been made that
imply that renewables are some
thing for the future," Masters said.
Regarding electricity genera
tion, he said, "Wind is viable right
now. To say that renewables could
never make it and to say when
they, at least in the wind category,
already are, is off base."
A paper released in May by
Assoc. Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson
supports Masters' claim. Jacobson
and his research team found that
wind gusts are strong enough at
24 U.S. wind monitoring sites to
generate power at a cost equiva
lent to production and coal and
natural gas plants.
Citing greater government
subsidies for energy production
from coal and natural gas than
from wind, Jacobson told the
Stanford News Service, "These
fuels are still competitive with
wind in price and have no incen
tive to go out of business. What is
needed are strong carbon, sulfur
and nitrogen industries that re
flect their true cost to the United
States and the general public."
He added, "Today, grandfa
thered, old coal power plants do
not even need to meet Clean Air
Act Amendment emission re
quirements. Once taxes that re
flect the real cost of fossil energy
are implemented, the economic
benefit of wind will become ap
parent."
Jacobson said he intends to
submit a proposal to get GCEP
funding for wind energy research
if there is a call for proposals in the
field of renewable energy.
Like Jacobson, Masters also ar
gued that massive explicit and in
direct U.S. subsidies for fossil fuels
skew the debate over whether re
newable technologies are eco
nomically viable.
"All of our energy sources have
huge subsidies," Masters said,
adding that it is difficult to deter
mine the entire societal cost of any
energy source, especially if exter
nalities resulting from their use
are considered. "Do we have any
subsidies for oil? When you think
about the Iraq war, our military
presence [in the Middle East] — if
you think we're paying full cost for
oil when we buy it at the gas sta
tion, we're not."

Despite the position of Exxon-
Mobil and Schlumberger, which
have committed up to $100 mil
lion and $25 million, respectively,
not all of the project's four spon
sors have deemed renewables ir
relevant barring technological
breakthroughs. General Electric,
which has committed up to $50
million, has specifically expressed
an interest in GCEP's potential to
advance renewable technologies
and has a commercial stake in im
proving them.
"It will take unprecedented
partnerships, such as GCEP, to
discover the technologies that will
power the world in the future,"
said Scott Donnelly, senior vice
president of GE Global Research,
at the project's launch in Novem
ber. "We are proud to be involved
in this very important collabora
tion, which is a natural extension
of the critical research we have
been conducting in hydrogen, fuel
cells, solar and wind technologies."
GE already is a substantial
provider of wind turbines in the
United States and is conducting
internal research to make wind
turbines and photovoltaic panels
both more efficient and more eco
nomically competitive.
One of the initial GCEP spon
sors, E.ON, a German company
that markets renewable technolo
gies for residential and commer
cial use, has since withdrawn from
the project, while Toyota has
signed on with a $50 million com
mitment. E.ON did not respond
to a Daily inquiry about the deci
sion to withdraw from the pro
gram. GCEP Director Lynn Orr, a
professor of petroleum engineer
ing, said that project organizers
were discussing whether to seek a
similar sponsor company to fill
E.ON's role, but added that it was
too early to tell and that, even
without another sponsor, he felt
confident that GCEP was "okay in
terms of going forward."
Will fossil fuel companies ever
embrace renewables?
Aside from the debate over sub
sidies and fossil fuel use, there are
several characteristics of renewable
energy technologies that slow their
introduction into the market place.
These issues include reliability due
to inconsistent supplies of sunlight
or wind, problems of storing ener
gy, transporting it and introducing
it into an energy infrastructure
built around fossil fuel use.
"Given where we are, the tech
nology that's currently used for
solar cells and the fundamental ef
ficiency limitations that exist be
cause of the physics, right now,
unless there's a major break
through, solar cells won't deliver
an economically viable alternative
in the next, pick your number,
maybe only 50 years, because
eventually sustainable technolo
gies become cheaper because con
sumptive technologies such as oil

[become scarcer]," said University
President John Hennessy. "Even
tually fossil fuels become much
more expensive, although that's
probably far enough away in the
future that I think global warming
is a bigger short term problem
than running out of fossil fuels."
The issue of phasing out fossil
fuel use is closely tied to the debate
over renewable energies. Many
renewable advocates view re
search into technologies that ei
ther tidy up fossil fuel use or miti
gate its impacts, such as carbon se
questration, as propagating a
soon-to-be defunct energy source
while delaying the advancement
of clean, sustainable technologies.
"Wouldn't we rather have
Stanford's reputation be the place
to come to build green buildings,
to change energy policy?" Masters
asked. "Somebody else is going to
[take] that role, and we are going
to be the place to go to learn how
to bury carbon in the ground."
Renewable proponents are not
mistaken in their claim that some
GCEP sponsors whose business is
currently dependent on fossil fuel
use intend, as corporate policy, to
extend the use of gas and oil for as
long as possible.
"Today, the enormous publici
ty being given to climate change
makes it possible for our critics to
misrepresent us as 'a sunset indus
try,' whose role in satisfying future
energy needs must be severely
curtailed. In this important de
bate about energy and the envi
ronment we must be careful not to
appear to accept this image of an
industry in decline," Baird said in
his speech to the World Petrole
um Conference. "For oil and gas
to play its crucial role in meeting
part of the world's vast needs for
clean, affordable energy over the
next 100 years, we need to reposi
tion ourselves as a trusted, long
term partner. This means invest
ing heavily in new technology to
address the two main concerns
our customers have about energy
solutions involving oil and gas,"
he said, referring to security and
the environment.
However, while the success of
companies like ExxonMobil and
Schlumberger is today depen
dent on the use of fuels like gas
and oil, GCEP organizers argue
that their corporate direction
will shift to fit a changing mar
ketplace, and that over time
such companies may move to
ward renewable technologies, as
many are currently moving to
ward hydrogen.
"Given the time scales involved
I don't think it would be out of the
question for, say, ExxonMobil to
become the hydrogen production
company of the future, even if it
looked like the best way to pro
duce hydrogen was from micro
organisms taking in sunlight and
water and producing hydro
gen — already a GCEP project —
rather than hydrocarbons," said

Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Weyant, who
has worked on an integrated as
sessment of technology options
for GCEP. "They would simply try
to maintain their role as a major
energy producer and distributor
rather than remaining an oil, gas
and coal company."
Langlands said that, if GCEP
research produced new renew
able technologies that ExxonMo
bil deemed commercially viable, it
would not shy away from refbcus
ing its corporate thrust.
"If the prospects for renew
ables improve in the years ahead,
we would reconsider our invest
ment in renewables," she said.
Said Hennessy, "1 think you
can view this in strictly economic
terms. I think [the sponsor com
panies] believe that there's a sig
nificant enough probability that
global warming is occurring,
combined with the potential cost
and impact if it is indeed occur
ring being sufficiently high, that
making an investment in trying to
develop technologies that can
mitigate that problem is a smart
long-term investment for the
company. And I think you can
view it — forget about any hu
manitarian goals, because I don't
think you should necessarily — I
think corporations have humani
tarian goals, but I don't think you
even have to look to those to justi
fy why they did this. I think they
did it because it was a smart busi
ness decision, because they be
lieve that a partnership that could
bring together corporations in
terested in a whole range of ener
gy problems and energy genera
tion is a smart thing to do."
Hennessy added that, despite
differences of opinion in corporate
approach toward energy policy,
effecting change in energy use ne
cessitates collaboration with large
companies because of the unique
nature of the energy sector.
"When you go into the energy
sector, there's so much infra
structure, so much capital in
vestment required to be a player
. . . that in order to have a posi
tive impact you have to change
the trajectory of the existing in
dustries and provide a viable
technology and end up transfer
ring it not to small companies but
probably to big companies," he
said. "It's a much harder thing to
do, and one of the things you see
about technology transfer is it's
much easier to transfer small
companies than big companies
because big companies have got
a commitment to their existing
technology, they don't move as
fast. Normally, when you create
a new technology, it's a small
market initially and so it's im
portant to have that [connection
to big companies in place] if
we're going to be successful in
having a positive impact in the
world on how we're going to
generate energv."

on record that renewables are not cur
rently economically practicable, critics
claimed that the companies would thwart
efforts to explore research into these areas
and by doing so prevent Stanford from
helping to create viable technologies that
could substantially reduce greenhouse
gas emissions — the stated purpose of
GCEP.
GCEP organizers — as well as the
sponsor companies — have maintained
that none of the broad areas of research
named at the project's inception are off

the table and will officially consider
whether to allocate some of the project's
unprecedented resources to research
into renewables in the upcoming acade
mic year. Along with two other new top
ics, advanced materials and carbon cap
ture and storage, academics and other re
searchers will discuss where the best op
portunities for university-style research
lie and ultimately will approach a GCEP
advisory committee, comprised of repre
sentatives from the sponsor corporations,
for approval to begin work within one of
the broad areas. GCEP organizers have
emphasized that the committee is expect
ed to approve the recommendation of the
researchers on what areas warrant explo
ration, and that beyond approving a

broad area of investigation the corpora
tions have no control over GCEP re
search.
Debate over what role renewables
should have in preventing climate change
is not confined to the Farm, and discussion
over the direction of GCEP parallels one of
the primary debates over energy use and
global warming: Are renewables the best so
lution, and can they cleanly supply the
world's energy needs?
Much of the disagreement over where
GCEP — a project with an emphasis on
commercial viability — should focus its ef
forts stems from the variety of answers to
these questions.
Subsidies, externalities and
supply and demand: differing
perspectives on commercial
viability
While proponents of renew
ables argue that they are both eco
nomically and technologically fea
sible substitutes fora substantial
portion of current fossil-fuel use,
others — including Schlumberg
er and ExxonMobil — claim that
renewables won't be large-scale
suppliers of energy for at least the
next 50 years and that fossil fuels
are essential to meet the interna
tional demand for cheap energy.
That renewable technologies
are cleaner than fossil fuels is not a
point of contention between those
on different sides of the debate
over renewables. Unlike fossil fuel
use, wind and solar energy use
does not produce the carbon diox
ide emissions that are cited as the
primary anthropogenic cause of
climate change.
It is the question of whether re
newable technologies can meet
growing energy needs and if
switching to a renewable-based
economy could occur at an accept
able cost that divides participants
in the energy debate.
To the chagrin of renewable
energy proponents, two GCEP
sponsors have been vocal in their
belief that the widespread use of
renewables is far off.
"Even with efficiency gains, we
expect that the world's demand for
energy will reach close to 290 mil
lion barrels per day of oil equivalent
by 2020 — or about 40 percent
more than today," said ExxonMobil
Chairman and CEO L,ee Raymond
in a June speech to the World Gas
Conference. "We expect oil and
gas — representing 60 percent of
energy supplies today — to remain
the dominant energy source, at least
through the mid-century.
"Wind and solar will likely con
tinue to grow very rapidly, but
only due to government policies
and incentives, not market forces
or economics. However, even with
double-digit growth rates, wind
and solar are unlikely to exceed a
1-percent share of the world's en
ergy needs by 2020."
Euan Baird, the chairman and
CEO of Schlumberger, a global
oilfield and information services
company, gave a similarly skepti
cal prediction in a September
speech to the World Petroleum
Conference.
"Fossil fuels are the only credi
ble candidate for cheap, clean en
ergy, in the required quantities,
over the next 50 years," Baird said.
According to Cynthia Lang
lands, a spokeswoman for Exxon-
Mobil, "There are no research
areas off the table. Solar and wind

will be explored as part of a full
portfolio of energy options. In our
experience, those technologies
are not yet commercially viable for
widespread deployment."
Cil Masters, an emeritus pro
fessor of civil and environmental
engineering who has been vocal
on campus in supporting green
buildings and improved energy
efficiency, argued the appraisals
of renewables by ExxonMobil,
Schlumberger and other skeptics
sell current technology short.
"I'm miffed at their characteri
zation of renewables, which I
think is inaccurate. I'm a little con
cerned about some of the com
ments that have been made that
imply that renewables are some
thing for the future," Masters said.
Regarding electricity genera
tion, he said, "Wind is viable right
now. To say that renewables could
never make it and to say when
they, at least in the wind category,
already are, is off base."
A paper released in May by
Assoc. Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson
supports Masters' claim. Jacobson
and his research team found that
wind gusts are strong enough at
24 U.S. wind monitoring sites to
generate power at a cost equiva
lent to production and coal and
natural gas plants.
Citing greater government
subsidies for energy production
from coal and natural gas than
from wind, Jacobson told the
Stanford News Service, "These
fuels are still competitive with
wind in price and have no incen
tive to go out of business. What is
needed are strong carbon, sulfur
and nitrogen industries that re
flect their true cost to the United
States and the general public."
He added, "Today, grandfa
thered, old coal power plants do
not even need to meet Clean Air
Act Amendment emission re
quirements. Once taxes that re
flect the real cost of fossil energy
are implemented, the economic
benefit of wind will become ap
parent."
Jacobson said he intends to
submit a proposal to get GCEP
funding for wind energy research
if there is a call for proposals in the
field of renewable energy.
Like Jacobson, Masters also ar
gued that massive explicit and in
direct U.S. subsidies for fossil fuels
skew the debate over whether re
newable technologies are eco
nomically viable.
"All of our energy sources have
huge subsidies," Masters said,
adding that it is difficult to deter
mine the entire societal cost of any
energy source, especially if exter
nalities resulting from their use
are considered. "Do we have any
subsidies for oil? When you think
about the Iraq war, our military
presence [in the Middle East] — if
you think we're paying full cost for
oil when we buy it at the gas sta
tion, we're not."

Despite the position of Exxon-
Mobil and Schlumberger, which
have committed up to $100 mil
lion and $25 million, respectively,
not all of the project's four spon
sors have deemed renewables ir
relevant barring technological
breakthroughs. General Electric,
which has committed up to $50
million, has specifically expressed
an interest in GCEP's potential to
advance renewable technologies
and has a commercial stake in im
proving them.
"It will take unprecedented
partnerships, such as GCEP, to
discover the technologies that will
power the world in the future,"
said Scott Donnelly, senior vice
president of GE Global Research,
at the project's launch in Novem
ber. "We are proud to be involved
in this very important collabora
tion, which is a natural extension
of the critical research we have
been conducting in hydrogen, fuel
cells, solar and wind technologies."
GE already is a substantial
provider of wind turbines in the
United States and is conducting
internal research to make wind
turbines and photovoltaic panels
both more efficient and more eco
nomically competitive.
One of the initial GCEP spon
sors, E.ON, a German company
that markets renewable technolo
gies for residential and commer
cial use, has since withdrawn from
the project, while Toyota has
signed on with a $50 million com
mitment. E.ON did not respond
to a Daily inquiry about the deci
sion to withdraw from the pro
gram. GCEP Director Lynn Orr, a
professor of petroleum engineer
ing, said that project organizers
were discussing whether to seek a
similar sponsor company to fill
E.ON's role, but added that it was
too early to tell and that, even
without another sponsor, he felt
confident that GCEP was "okay in
terms of going forward."
Will fossil fuel companies ever
embrace renewables?
Aside from the debate over sub
sidies and fossil fuel use, there are
several characteristics of renewable
energy technologies that slow their
introduction into the market place.
These issues include reliability due
to inconsistent supplies of sunlight
or wind, problems of storing ener
gy, transporting it and introducing
it into an energy infrastructure
built around fossil fuel use.
"Given where we are, the tech
nology that's currently used for
solar cells and the fundamental ef
ficiency limitations that exist be
cause of the physics, right now,
unless there's a major break
through, solar cells won't deliver
an economically viable alternative
in the next, pick your number,
maybe only 50 years, because
eventually sustainable technolo
gies become cheaper because con
sumptive technologies such as oil

[become scarcer]," said University
President John Hennessy. "Even
tually fossil fuels become much
more expensive, although that's
probably far enough away in the
future that I think global warming
is a bigger short term problem
than running out of fossil fuels."
The issue of phasing out fossil
fuel use is closely tied to the debate
over renewable energies. Many
renewable advocates view re
search into technologies that ei
ther tidy up fossil fuel use or miti
gate its impacts, such as carbon se
questration, as propagating a
soon-to-be defunct energy source
while delaying the advancement
of clean, sustainable technologies.
"Wouldn't we rather have
Stanford's reputation be the place
to come to build green buildings,
to change energy policy?" Masters
asked. "Somebody else is going to
[take] that role, and we are going
to be the place to go to learn how
to bury carbon in the ground."
Renewable proponents are not
mistaken in their claim that some
GCEP sponsors whose business is
currently dependent on fossil fuel
use intend, as corporate policy, to
extend the use of gas and oil for as
long as possible.
"Today, the enormous publici
ty being given to climate change
makes it possible for our critics to
misrepresent us as 'a sunset indus
try,' whose role in satisfying future
energy needs must be severely
curtailed. In this important de
bate about energy and the envi
ronment we must be careful not to
appear to accept this image of an
industry in decline," Baird said in
his speech to the World Petrole
um Conference. "For oil and gas
to play its crucial role in meeting
part of the world's vast needs for
clean, affordable energy over the
next 100 years, we need to reposi
tion ourselves as a trusted, long
term partner. This means invest
ing heavily in new technology to
address the two main concerns
our customers have about energy
solutions involving oil and gas,"
he said, referring to security and
the environment.
However, while the success of
companies like ExxonMobil and
Schlumberger is today depen
dent on the use of fuels like gas
and oil, GCEP organizers argue
that their corporate direction
will shift to fit a changing mar
ketplace, and that over time
such companies may move to
ward renewable technologies, as
many are currently moving to
ward hydrogen.
"Given the time scales involved
I don't think it would be out of the
question for, say, ExxonMobil to
become the hydrogen production
company of the future, even if it
looked like the best way to pro
duce hydrogen was from micro
organisms taking in sunlight and
water and producing hydro
gen — already a GCEP project —
rather than hydrocarbons," said

Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Weyant, who
has worked on an integrated as
sessment of technology options
for GCEP. "They would simply try
to maintain their role as a major
energy producer and distributor
rather than remaining an oil, gas
and coal company."
Langlands said that, if GCEP
research produced new renew
able technologies that ExxonMo
bil deemed commercially viable, it
would not shy away from refbcus
ing its corporate thrust.
"If the prospects for renew
ables improve in the years ahead,
we would reconsider our invest
ment in renewables," she said.
Said Hennessy, "1 think you
can view this in strictly economic
terms. I think [the sponsor com
panies] believe that there's a sig
nificant enough probability that
global warming is occurring,
combined with the potential cost
and impact if it is indeed occur
ring being sufficiently high, that
making an investment in trying to
develop technologies that can
mitigate that problem is a smart
long-term investment for the
company. And I think you can
view it — forget about any hu
manitarian goals, because I don't
think you should necessarily — I
think corporations have humani
tarian goals, but I don't think you
even have to look to those to justi
fy why they did this. I think they
did it because it was a smart busi
ness decision, because they be
lieve that a partnership that could
bring together corporations in
terested in a whole range of ener
gy problems and energy genera
tion is a smart thing to do."
Hennessy added that, despite
differences of opinion in corporate
approach toward energy policy,
effecting change in energy use ne
cessitates collaboration with large
companies because of the unique
nature of the energy sector.
"When you go into the energy
sector, there's so much infra
structure, so much capital in
vestment required to be a player
. . . that in order to have a posi
tive impact you have to change
the trajectory of the existing in
dustries and provide a viable
technology and end up transfer
ring it not to small companies but
probably to big companies," he
said. "It's a much harder thing to
do, and one of the things you see
about technology transfer is it's
much easier to transfer small
companies than big companies
because big companies have got
a commitment to their existing
technology, they don't move as
fast. Normally, when you create
a new technology, it's a small
market initially and so it's im
portant to have that [connection
to big companies in place] if
we're going to be successful in
having a positive impact in the
world on how we're going to
generate energv."

Skeptics of Stanford's Global Climate

lie and ultimately will approach a GCEP
advisory committee, comprised of repre
sentatives from the sponsor corporations,
for approval to begin work within one of
the broad areas. GCEP organizers have
emphasized that the committee is expect
ed to approve the recommendation of the
researchers on what areas warrant explo
ration, and that beyond approving a

broad area of investigation the corpora
tions have no control over GCEP re
search.
Debate over what role renewables
should have in preventing climate change
is not confined to the Farm, and discussion
over the direction of GCEP parallels one of
the primary debates over energy use and
global warming: Are renewables the best so
lution, and can they cleanly supply the
world's energy needs?
Much of the disagreement over where
GCEP — a project with an emphasis on
commercial viability — should focus its ef
forts stems from the variety of answers to
these questions.
Subsidies, externalities and
supply and demand: differing
perspectives on commercial
viability
While proponents of renew
ables argue that they are both eco
nomically and technologically fea
sible substitutes fora substantial
portion of current fossil-fuel use,
others — including Schlumberg
er and ExxonMobil — claim that
renewables won't be large-scale
suppliers of energy for at least the
next 50 years and that fossil fuels
are essential to meet the interna
tional demand for cheap energy.
That renewable technologies
are cleaner than fossil fuels is not a
point of contention between those
on different sides of the debate
over renewables. Unlike fossil fuel
use, wind and solar energy use
does not produce the carbon diox
ide emissions that are cited as the
primary anthropogenic cause of
climate change.
It is the question of whether re
newable technologies can meet
growing energy needs and if
switching to a renewable-based
economy could occur at an accept
able cost that divides participants
in the energy debate.
To the chagrin of renewable
energy proponents, two GCEP
sponsors have been vocal in their
belief that the widespread use of
renewables is far off.
"Even with efficiency gains, we
expect that the world's demand for
energy will reach close to 290 mil
lion barrels per day of oil equivalent
by 2020 — or about 40 percent
more than today," said ExxonMobil
Chairman and CEO L,ee Raymond
in a June speech to the World Gas
Conference. "We expect oil and
gas — representing 60 percent of
energy supplies today — to remain
the dominant energy source, at least
through the mid-century.
"Wind and solar will likely con
tinue to grow very rapidly, but
only due to government policies
and incentives, not market forces
or economics. However, even with
double-digit growth rates, wind
and solar are unlikely to exceed a
1-percent share of the world's en
ergy needs by 2020."
Euan Baird, the chairman and
CEO of Schlumberger, a global
oilfield and information services
company, gave a similarly skepti
cal prediction in a September
speech to the World Petroleum
Conference.
"Fossil fuels are the only credi
ble candidate for cheap, clean en
ergy, in the required quantities,
over the next 50 years," Baird said.
According to Cynthia Lang
lands, a spokeswoman for Exxon-
Mobil, "There are no research
areas off the table. Solar and wind

will be explored as part of a full
portfolio of energy options. In our
experience, those technologies
are not yet commercially viable for
widespread deployment."
Cil Masters, an emeritus pro
fessor of civil and environmental
engineering who has been vocal
on campus in supporting green
buildings and improved energy
efficiency, argued the appraisals
of renewables by ExxonMobil,
Schlumberger and other skeptics
sell current technology short.
"I'm miffed at their characteri
zation of renewables, which I
think is inaccurate. I'm a little con
cerned about some of the com
ments that have been made that
imply that renewables are some
thing for the future," Masters said.
Regarding electricity genera
tion, he said, "Wind is viable right
now. To say that renewables could
never make it and to say when
they, at least in the wind category,
already are, is off base."
A paper released in May by
Assoc. Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson
supports Masters' claim. Jacobson
and his research team found that
wind gusts are strong enough at
24 U.S. wind monitoring sites to
generate power at a cost equiva
lent to production and coal and
natural gas plants.
Citing greater government
subsidies for energy production
from coal and natural gas than
from wind, Jacobson told the
Stanford News Service, "These
fuels are still competitive with
wind in price and have no incen
tive to go out of business. What is
needed are strong carbon, sulfur
and nitrogen industries that re
flect their true cost to the United
States and the general public."
He added, "Today, grandfa
thered, old coal power plants do
not even need to meet Clean Air
Act Amendment emission re
quirements. Once taxes that re
flect the real cost of fossil energy
are implemented, the economic
benefit of wind will become ap
parent."
Jacobson said he intends to
submit a proposal to get GCEP
funding for wind energy research
if there is a call for proposals in the
field of renewable energy.
Like Jacobson, Masters also ar
gued that massive explicit and in
direct U.S. subsidies for fossil fuels
skew the debate over whether re
newable technologies are eco
nomically viable.
"All of our energy sources have
huge subsidies," Masters said,
adding that it is difficult to deter
mine the entire societal cost of any
energy source, especially if exter
nalities resulting from their use
are considered. "Do we have any
subsidies for oil? When you think
about the Iraq war, our military
presence [in the Middle East] — if
you think we're paying full cost for
oil when we buy it at the gas sta
tion, we're not."

Despite the position of Exxon-
Mobil and Schlumberger, which
have committed up to $100 mil
lion and $25 million, respectively,
not all of the project's four spon
sors have deemed renewables ir
relevant barring technological
breakthroughs. General Electric,
which has committed up to $50
million, has specifically expressed
an interest in GCEP's potential to
advance renewable technologies
and has a commercial stake in im
proving them.
"It will take unprecedented
partnerships, such as GCEP, to
discover the technologies that will
power the world in the future,"
said Scott Donnelly, senior vice
president of GE Global Research,
at the project's launch in Novem
ber. "We are proud to be involved
in this very important collabora
tion, which is a natural extension
of the critical research we have
been conducting in hydrogen, fuel
cells, solar and wind technologies."
GE already is a substantial
provider of wind turbines in the
United States and is conducting
internal research to make wind
turbines and photovoltaic panels
both more efficient and more eco
nomically competitive.
One of the initial GCEP spon
sors, E.ON, a German company
that markets renewable technolo
gies for residential and commer
cial use, has since withdrawn from
the project, while Toyota has
signed on with a $50 million com
mitment. E.ON did not respond
to a Daily inquiry about the deci
sion to withdraw from the pro
gram. GCEP Director Lynn Orr, a
professor of petroleum engineer
ing, said that project organizers
were discussing whether to seek a
similar sponsor company to fill
E.ON's role, but added that it was
too early to tell and that, even
without another sponsor, he felt
confident that GCEP was "okay in
terms of going forward."
Will fossil fuel companies ever
embrace renewables?
Aside from the debate over sub
sidies and fossil fuel use, there are
several characteristics of renewable
energy technologies that slow their
introduction into the market place.
These issues include reliability due
to inconsistent supplies of sunlight
or wind, problems of storing ener
gy, transporting it and introducing
it into an energy infrastructure
built around fossil fuel use.
"Given where we are, the tech
nology that's currently used for
solar cells and the fundamental ef
ficiency limitations that exist be
cause of the physics, right now,
unless there's a major break
through, solar cells won't deliver
an economically viable alternative
in the next, pick your number,
maybe only 50 years, because
eventually sustainable technolo
gies become cheaper because con
sumptive technologies such as oil

[become scarcer]," said University
President John Hennessy. "Even
tually fossil fuels become much
more expensive, although that's
probably far enough away in the
future that I think global warming
is a bigger short term problem
than running out of fossil fuels."
The issue of phasing out fossil
fuel use is closely tied to the debate
over renewable energies. Many
renewable advocates view re
search into technologies that ei
ther tidy up fossil fuel use or miti
gate its impacts, such as carbon se
questration, as propagating a
soon-to-be defunct energy source
while delaying the advancement
of clean, sustainable technologies.
"Wouldn't we rather have
Stanford's reputation be the place
to come to build green buildings,
to change energy policy?" Masters
asked. "Somebody else is going to
[take] that role, and we are going
to be the place to go to learn how
to bury carbon in the ground."
Renewable proponents are not
mistaken in their claim that some
GCEP sponsors whose business is
currently dependent on fossil fuel
use intend, as corporate policy, to
extend the use of gas and oil for as
long as possible.
"Today, the enormous publici
ty being given to climate change
makes it possible for our critics to
misrepresent us as 'a sunset indus
try,' whose role in satisfying future
energy needs must be severely
curtailed. In this important de
bate about energy and the envi
ronment we must be careful not to
appear to accept this image of an
industry in decline," Baird said in
his speech to the World Petrole
um Conference. "For oil and gas
to play its crucial role in meeting
part of the world's vast needs for
clean, affordable energy over the
next 100 years, we need to reposi
tion ourselves as a trusted, long
term partner. This means invest
ing heavily in new technology to
address the two main concerns
our customers have about energy
solutions involving oil and gas,"
he said, referring to security and
the environment.
However, while the success of
companies like ExxonMobil and
Schlumberger is today depen
dent on the use of fuels like gas
and oil, GCEP organizers argue
that their corporate direction
will shift to fit a changing mar
ketplace, and that over time
such companies may move to
ward renewable technologies, as
many are currently moving to
ward hydrogen.
"Given the time scales involved
I don't think it would be out of the
question for, say, ExxonMobil to
become the hydrogen production
company of the future, even if it
looked like the best way to pro
duce hydrogen was from micro
organisms taking in sunlight and
water and producing hydro
gen — already a GCEP project —
rather than hydrocarbons," said

Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Weyant, who
has worked on an integrated as
sessment of technology options
for GCEP. "They would simply try
to maintain their role as a major
energy producer and distributor
rather than remaining an oil, gas
and coal company."
Langlands said that, if GCEP
research produced new renew
able technologies that ExxonMo
bil deemed commercially viable, it
would not shy away from refbcus
ing its corporate thrust.
"If the prospects for renew
ables improve in the years ahead,
we would reconsider our invest
ment in renewables," she said.
Said Hennessy, "1 think you
can view this in strictly economic
terms. I think [the sponsor com
panies] believe that there's a sig
nificant enough probability that
global warming is occurring,
combined with the potential cost
and impact if it is indeed occur
ring being sufficiently high, that
making an investment in trying to
develop technologies that can
mitigate that problem is a smart
long-term investment for the
company. And I think you can
view it — forget about any hu
manitarian goals, because I don't
think you should necessarily — I
think corporations have humani
tarian goals, but I don't think you
even have to look to those to justi
fy why they did this. I think they
did it because it was a smart busi
ness decision, because they be
lieve that a partnership that could
bring together corporations in
terested in a whole range of ener
gy problems and energy genera
tion is a smart thing to do."
Hennessy added that, despite
differences of opinion in corporate
approach toward energy policy,
effecting change in energy use ne
cessitates collaboration with large
companies because of the unique
nature of the energy sector.
"When you go into the energy
sector, there's so much infra
structure, so much capital in
vestment required to be a player
. . . that in order to have a posi
tive impact you have to change
the trajectory of the existing in
dustries and provide a viable
technology and end up transfer
ring it not to small companies but
probably to big companies," he
said. "It's a much harder thing to
do, and one of the things you see
about technology transfer is it's
much easier to transfer small
companies than big companies
because big companies have got
a commitment to their existing
technology, they don't move as
fast. Normally, when you create
a new technology, it's a small
market initially and so it's im
portant to have that [connection
to big companies in place] if
we're going to be successful in
having a positive impact in the
world on how we're going to
generate energv."
Editor's Note: This article is the third installment
of a three-week series examining the Global Cli
mate ami Energy Project's current research ef
forts ami opportunities for the 112 uture.
Skeptics of Stanford's Global Climate
and Energy Project may see the upcoming
year as one that makes or breaks their faith
in the $225 million initiative, as program
organizers consider whether to begin re
search into renewable energy technologies.
Almost immediately after its announce
ment, GCEP drew lire from many commit
ted proponents of renewables who feared
that research into fields like wind or solar

energy would never get funding as long as
sponsor corporations like Schlumberger
and ExxonMobil had any control over the
project.
Arguing that both companies have said
on record that renewables are not cur
rently economically practicable, critics
claimed that the companies would thwart
efforts to explore research into these areas
and by doing so prevent Stanford from
helping to create viable technologies that
could substantially reduce greenhouse
gas emissions — the stated purpose of
GCEP.
GCEP organizers — as well as the
sponsor companies — have maintained
that none of the broad areas of research
named at the project's inception are off

the table and will officially consider
whether to allocate some of the project's
unprecedented resources to research
into renewables in the upcoming acade
mic year. Along with two other new top
ics, advanced materials and carbon cap
ture and storage, academics and other re
searchers will discuss where the best op

lie and ultimately will approach a GCEP

GCEP — a project with an emphasis on
commercial viability — should focus its ef
forts stems from the variety of answers to
these questions.
Subsidies, externalities and
supply and demand: differing
perspectives on commercial
viability
While proponents of renew
ables argue that they are both eco
nomically and technologically fea
sible substitutes fora substantial
portion of current fossil-fuel use,
others — including Schlumberg
er and ExxonMobil — claim that
renewables won't be large-scale
suppliers of energy for at least the
next 50 years and that fossil fuels
are essential to meet the interna
tional demand for cheap energy.
That renewable technologies
are cleaner than fossil fuels is not a
point of contention between those
on different sides of the debate
over renewables. Unlike fossil fuel
use, wind and solar energy use
does not produce the carbon diox
ide emissions that are cited as the
primary anthropogenic cause of
climate change.
It is the question of whether re
newable technologies can meet
growing energy needs and if
switching to a renewable-based
economy could occur at an accept
able cost that divides participants
in the energy debate.
To the chagrin of renewable
energy proponents, two GCEP
sponsors have been vocal in their
belief that the widespread use of
renewables is far off.
"Even with efficiency gains, we
expect that the world's demand for
energy will reach close to 290 mil
lion barrels per day of oil equivalent
by 2020 — or about 40 percent
more than today," said ExxonMobil
Chairman and CEO L,ee Raymond
in a June speech to the World Gas
Conference. "We expect oil and
gas — representing 60 percent of
energy supplies today — to remain
the dominant energy source, at least
through the mid-century.
"Wind and solar will likely con
tinue to grow very rapidly, but
only due to government policies
and incentives, not market forces
or economics. However, even with
double-digit growth rates, wind
and solar are unlikely to exceed a
1-percent share of the world's en
ergy needs by 2020."
Euan Baird, the chairman and
CEO of Schlumberger, a global
oilfield and information services
company, gave a similarly skepti
cal prediction in a September
speech to the World Petroleum
Conference.
"Fossil fuels are the only credi
ble candidate for cheap, clean en
ergy, in the required quantities,
over the next 50 years," Baird said.
According to Cynthia Lang
lands, a spokeswoman for Exxon-
Mobil, "There are no research
areas off the table. Solar and wind

will be explored as part of a full
portfolio of energy options. In our
experience, those technologies
are not yet commercially viable for
widespread deployment."
Cil Masters, an emeritus pro
fessor of civil and environmental
engineering who has been vocal
on campus in supporting green
buildings and improved energy
efficiency, argued the appraisals
of renewables by ExxonMobil,
Schlumberger and other skeptics
sell current technology short.
"I'm miffed at their characteri
zation of renewables, which I
think is inaccurate. I'm a little con
cerned about some of the com
ments that have been made that
imply that renewables are some
thing for the future," Masters said.
Regarding electricity genera
tion, he said, "Wind is viable right
now. To say that renewables could
never make it and to say when
they, at least in the wind category,
already are, is off base."
A paper released in May by
Assoc. Civil and Environmental
Engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson
supports Masters' claim. Jacobson
and his research team found that
wind gusts are strong enough at
24 U.S. wind monitoring sites to
generate power at a cost equiva
lent to production and coal and
natural gas plants.
Citing greater government
subsidies for energy production
from coal and natural gas than
from wind, Jacobson told the
Stanford News Service, "These
fuels are still competitive with
wind in price and have no incen
tive to go out of business. What is
needed are strong carbon, sulfur
and nitrogen industries that re
flect their true cost to the United
States and the general public."
He added, "Today, grandfa
thered, old coal power plants do
not even need to meet Clean Air
Act Amendment emission re
quirements. Once taxes that re
flect the real cost of fossil energy
are implemented, the economic
benefit of wind will become ap
parent."
Jacobson said he intends to
submit a proposal to get GCEP
funding for wind energy research
if there is a call for proposals in the
field of renewable energy.
Like Jacobson, Masters also ar
gued that massive explicit and in
direct U.S. subsidies for fossil fuels
skew the debate over whether re
newable technologies are eco
nomically viable.
"All of our energy sources have
huge subsidies," Masters said,
adding that it is difficult to deter
mine the entire societal cost of any
energy source, especially if exter
nalities resulting from their use
are considered. "Do we have any
subsidies for oil? When you think
about the Iraq war, our military
presence [in the Middle East] — if
you think we're paying full cost for
oil when we buy it at the gas sta
tion, we're not."

Despite the position of Exxon-
Mobil and Schlumberger, which
have committed up to $100 mil
lion and $25 million, respectively,
not all of the project's four spon
sors have deemed renewables ir
relevant barring technological
breakthroughs. General Electric,
which has committed up to $50
million, has specifically expressed
an interest in GCEP's potential to
advance renewable technologies
and has a commercial stake in im
proving them.
"It will take unprecedented
partnerships, such as GCEP, to
discover the technologies that will
power the world in the future,"
said Scott Donnelly, senior vice
president of GE Global Research,
at the project's launch in Novem
ber. "We are proud to be involved
in this very important collabora
tion, which is a natural extension
of the critical research we have
been conducting in hydrogen, fuel
cells, solar and wind technologies."
GE already is a substantial
provider of wind turbines in the
United States and is conducting
internal research to make wind
turbines and photovoltaic panels
both more efficient and more eco
nomically competitive.
One of the initial GCEP spon
sors, E.ON, a German company
that markets renewable technolo
gies for residential and commer
cial use, has since withdrawn from
the project, while Toyota has
signed on with a $50 million com
mitment. E.ON did not respond
to a Daily inquiry about the deci
sion to withdraw from the pro
gram. GCEP Director Lynn Orr, a
professor of petroleum engineer
ing, said that project organizers
were discussing whether to seek a
similar sponsor company to fill
E.ON's role, but added that it was
too early to tell and that, even
without another sponsor, he felt
confident that GCEP was "okay in
terms of going forward."
Will fossil fuel companies ever
embrace renewables?
Aside from the debate over sub
sidies and fossil fuel use, there are
several characteristics of renewable
energy technologies that slow their
introduction into the market place.
These issues include reliability due
to inconsistent supplies of sunlight
or wind, problems of storing ener
gy, transporting it and introducing
it into an energy infrastructure
built around fossil fuel use.
"Given where we are, the tech
nology that's currently used for
solar cells and the fundamental ef
ficiency limitations that exist be
cause of the physics, right now,
unless there's a major break
through, solar cells won't deliver
an economically viable alternative
in the next, pick your number,
maybe only 50 years, because
eventually sustainable technolo
gies become cheaper because con
sumptive technologies such as oil

[become scarcer]," said University
President John Hennessy. "Even
tually fossil fuels become much
more expensive, although that's
probably far enough away in the
future that I think global warming
is a bigger short term problem
than running out of fossil fuels."
The issue of phasing out fossil
fuel use is closely tied to the debate
over renewable energies. Many
renewable advocates view re
search into technologies that ei
ther tidy up fossil fuel use or miti
gate its impacts, such as carbon se
questration, as propagating a
soon-to-be defunct energy source
while delaying the advancement
of clean, sustainable technologies.
"Wouldn't we rather have
Stanford's reputation be the place
to come to build green buildings,
to change energy policy?" Masters
asked. "Somebody else is going to
[take] that role, and we are going
to be the place to go to learn how
to bury carbon in the ground."
Renewable proponents are not
mistaken in their claim that some
GCEP sponsors whose business is
currently dependent on fossil fuel
use intend, as corporate policy, to
extend the use of gas and oil for as
long as possible.
"Today, the enormous publici
ty being given to climate change
makes it possible for our critics to
misrepresent us as 'a sunset indus
try,' whose role in satisfying future
energy needs must be severely
curtailed. In this important de
bate about energy and the envi
ronment we must be careful not to
appear to accept this image of an
industry in decline," Baird said in
his speech to the World Petrole
um Conference. "For oil and gas
to play its crucial role in meeting
part of the world's vast needs for
clean, affordable energy over the
next 100 years, we need to reposi
tion ourselves as a trusted, long
term partner. This means invest
ing heavily in new technology to
address the two main concerns
our customers have about energy
solutions involving oil and gas,"
he said, referring to security and
the environment.
However, while the success of
companies like ExxonMobil and
Schlumberger is today depen
dent on the use of fuels like gas
and oil, GCEP organizers argue
that their corporate direction
will shift to fit a changing mar
ketplace, and that over time
such companies may move to
ward renewable technologies, as
many are currently moving to
ward hydrogen.
"Given the time scales involved
I don't think it would be out of the
question for, say, ExxonMobil to
become the hydrogen production
company of the future, even if it
looked like the best way to pro
duce hydrogen was from micro
organisms taking in sunlight and
water and producing hydro
gen — already a GCEP project —
rather than hydrocarbons," said

Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Weyant, who
has worked on an integrated as
sessment of technology options
for GCEP. "They would simply try
to maintain their role as a major
energy producer and distributor
rather than remaining an oil, gas
and coal company."
Langlands said that, if GCEP
research produced new renew
able technologies that ExxonMo
bil deemed commercially viable, it
would not shy away from refbcus
ing its corporate thrust.
"If the prospects for renew
ables improve in the years ahead,
we would reconsider our invest
ment in renewables," she said.
Said Hennessy, "1 think you
can view this in strictly economic
terms. I think [the sponsor com
panies] believe that there's a sig
nificant enough probability that
global warming is occurring,
combined with the potential cost
and impact if it is indeed occur
ring being sufficiently high, that
making an investment in trying to
develop technologies that can
mitigate that problem is a smart
long-term investment for the
company. And I think you can
view it — forget about any hu
manitarian goals, because I don't
think you should necessarily — I
think corporations have humani
tarian goals, but I don't think you
even have to look to those to justi
fy why they did this. I think they
did it because it was a smart busi
ness decision, because they be
lieve that a partnership that could
bring together corporations in
terested in a whole range of ener
gy problems and energy genera
tion is a smart thing to do."
Hennessy added that, despite
differences of opinion in corporate
approach toward energy policy,
effecting change in energy use ne
cessitates collaboration with large
companies because of the unique
nature of the energy sector.
"When you go into the energy
sector, there's so much infra
structure, so much capital in
vestment required to be a player
. . . that in order to have a posi
tive impact you have to change
the trajectory of the existing in
dustries and provide a viable
technology and end up transfer
ring it not to small companies but
probably to big companies," he
said. "It's a much harder thing to
do, and one of the things you see
about technology transfer is it's
much easier to transfer small
companies than big companies
because big companies have got
a commitment to their existing
technology, they don't move as
fast. Normally, when you create
a new technology, it's a small
market initially and so it's im
portant to have that [connection
to big companies in place] if
we're going to be successful in
having a positive impact in the
world on how we're going to
generate energv."
