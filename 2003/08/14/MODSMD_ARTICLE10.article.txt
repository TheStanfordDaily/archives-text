## Governor's failure to lead California necessitates termination 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Pundits and politicos on both sides of
the fence are making cameo appear
ances as this fall's hottest reality show
heads into full swing. Comparing the effort
to recall Gov. Gray Davis to a "train wreck,"
a circus" and a "kangaroo show," Davis al
lies are lining up to try to stop the recall be
fore California!! voters have a chance to
weigh in.
Davis has dubbed the recall effort "an in
sult" to the eight million Californians who
voted in last November's election. The gov
ernor's supporters have initiated a series of
lawsuits seeking variously to invalidate the
recall, to delay the recall and to allow Davis
to run on the second half of the recall ballot
to replace himself.
But all this bluster and litigation can't
cover up the fact that Davis has failed the
state of California. The real insult is not that
voters might get to weigh-in on how they
think Gov. Davis is performing — it is how

long Californians have had to put up with
Davis's mediocre performance.
Davis failed California during the energy
crisis when rolling blackouts plagued the
state. Davis failed California when he
agreed to pay exorbitant energy prices to
get the power grid back up. Davis failed
California when he handed healthy pay in
creases to prison guards — a group that
traditionally backs him when election time
rolls around — while mercilessly slashing
school budgets and mortgaging away the
future of California's children. And Davis
failed California most recently when he
concealed budget woes until after he had
won reelection; apparently, job security was
more important to our governor than the
fact that the suite lost $38 billion in the
course of one year — more than $ 1,000 for
every man, woman and child in California.
Most Californians are tired of Davis's
lackluster leadership. A CNN-USA Today-
Gallup poll released Monday revealed that
64 percent of Californians believe that
Davis should be removed from office.

It seems like Davis has finally run out of
second chances.
In the true sense of the expression "sec
ond chance," Davis used his up years ago.
And in the spirit of California's Three-
Strikes-and-You're-Out law, we should
have sent him packing shortly thereafter.
But, like a guest who has overstayed his wel
come, Davis just doesn't seem to know
when it's time to leave.
When U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein an
nounced that she would not run against
Davis in a recall election, she told the press
that, with the recall effort in full swing, "we
have a carnival on our hands."
Every carnival has a ringmaster, and this
carnival's ringmaster is Davis.
California politics was carnival-esque —
with Davis directing a three-ring spectacle
aimed at distracting voters from the real
problems facing California — long before
U.S. Rep. Darrel Issa spent a dollar funding
the recall effort.
Now, as the clock counts down to the
Oct. 7 recall vote, the lions stopped listening

to the ringmaster and started to misbehave.
The ringmaster, it turns out, wasn't doing a
very good job running the carnival, so tilt
lions took over.
Almost 200 Californians have filed pa
pers to appear on a recall ballot. Among the
more notable are Arnold Schwarzenegger
("the Terminator"), Arianna Huftington
(the political columnist), Larry Flint (owner
of "Hustler" magazine), and Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamente.
Few of the candidates running to replace
Davis have much political experience. But
perhaps California needs less political ex
perience — and more leadership ability —
in its next governor
When Schwarzenegger announced his
candidacy on the Tonight Show on Aug. 5,
it came as a breath of fresh air to Californi
ans weary of Davis's limpid leadership.
"The politicians are fiddling, fumbling
and failing," Schwarzenegger told Leno as
the studio audience cheered. "The man
that is failing the people more than
anyone is Gray Davis. He is (ailing
them terribly, and this is why he
needs to be recalled and this is why
I am going to run lor governor."
(Critics allege that Schwarzeneg
ger does not have ilie political ex
perience to run the world's sixth
largest economy. They contend
that he is a political neophyte who
is untested in Sacramento.
They are right that
Schwarzenegger doesn't have the
political experience of, say, former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Rior
dan. But Davis, a man with plenty
of political experience, led Califor

ilia into its current financial quag
mire.
Maybe political experience is
not what California needs to lead
it out of financial turmoil. Califor
nia needs the style of energetic
leadership Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt epitomized — along with a
strong vision for the future — to
bring the state back to economic
health.
Perhaps the Terminator would
bring the right kind of leadership
qualities with him to Sacramento.
It's worth giving him a chance.
After all, things can't get much
worse than they already are.

Mark Dommik is a rising serum. He
hopes to be able to say "husta la vista, baby'
U> Davis this fall. He ran be rear lied by e

sult" to the eight million Californians who
voted in last November's election. The gov
ernor's supporters have initiated a series of
lawsuits seeking variously to invalidate the
recall, to delay the recall and to allow Davis
to run on the second half of the recall ballot
to replace himself.
But all this bluster and litigation can't
cover up the fact that Davis has failed the
state of California. The real insult is not that
voters might get to weigh-in on how they
think Gov. Davis is performing — it is how

long Californians have had to put up with
Davis's mediocre performance.
Davis failed California during the energy
crisis when rolling blackouts plagued the
state. Davis failed California when he
agreed to pay exorbitant energy prices to
get the power grid back up. Davis failed
California when he handed healthy pay in
creases to prison guards — a group that
traditionally backs him when election time
rolls around — while mercilessly slashing
school budgets and mortgaging away the
future of California's children. And Davis
failed California most recently when he
concealed budget woes until after he had
won reelection; apparently, job security was
more important to our governor than the
fact that the suite lost $38 billion in the
course of one year — more than $ 1,000 for
every man, woman and child in California.
Most Californians are tired of Davis's
lackluster leadership. A CNN-USA Today-
Gallup poll released Monday revealed that
64 percent of Californians believe that
Davis should be removed from office.

It seems like Davis has finally run out of
second chances.
In the true sense of the expression "sec
ond chance," Davis used his up years ago.
And in the spirit of California's Three-
Strikes-and-You're-Out law, we should
have sent him packing shortly thereafter.
But, like a guest who has overstayed his wel
come, Davis just doesn't seem to know
when it's time to leave.
When U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein an
nounced that she would not run against
Davis in a recall election, she told the press
that, with the recall effort in full swing, "we
have a carnival on our hands."
Every carnival has a ringmaster, and this
carnival's ringmaster is Davis.
California politics was carnival-esque —
with Davis directing a three-ring spectacle
aimed at distracting voters from the real
problems facing California — long before
U.S. Rep. Darrel Issa spent a dollar funding
the recall effort.
Now, as the clock counts down to the
Oct. 7 recall vote, the lions stopped listening

to the ringmaster and started to misbehave.
The ringmaster, it turns out, wasn't doing a
very good job running the carnival, so tilt
lions took over.
Almost 200 Californians have filed pa
pers to appear on a recall ballot. Among the
more notable are Arnold Schwarzenegger
("the Terminator"), Arianna Huftington
(the political columnist), Larry Flint (owner
of "Hustler" magazine), and Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamente.
Few of the candidates running to replace
Davis have much political experience. But
perhaps California needs less political ex
perience — and more leadership ability —
in its next governor
When Schwarzenegger announced his
candidacy on the Tonight Show on Aug. 5,
it came as a breath of fresh air to Californi
ans weary of Davis's limpid leadership.
"The politicians are fiddling, fumbling
and failing," Schwarzenegger told Leno as
the studio audience cheered. "The man
that is failing the people more than
anyone is Gray Davis. He is (ailing
them terribly, and this is why he
needs to be recalled and this is why
I am going to run lor governor."
(Critics allege that Schwarzeneg
ger does not have ilie political ex
perience to run the world's sixth
largest economy. They contend
that he is a political neophyte who
is untested in Sacramento.
They are right that
Schwarzenegger doesn't have the
political experience of, say, former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Rior
dan. But Davis, a man with plenty
of political experience, led Califor

ilia into its current financial quag
mire.
Maybe political experience is
not what California needs to lead
it out of financial turmoil. Califor
nia needs the style of energetic
leadership Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt epitomized — along with a
strong vision for the future — to
bring the state back to economic
health.
Perhaps the Terminator would
bring the right kind of leadership
qualities with him to Sacramento.
It's worth giving him a chance.
After all, things can't get much
worse than they already are.

Mark Dommik is a rising serum. He
