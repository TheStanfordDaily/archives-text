# PEDANTIC POETICS
## Singing the post-grad blues 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Something terrible happens
around 22. After simmering
fora few brutally early hours,
hundreds of hungover children
are given diplomas and tossed
overboard. That they're all wear
ing black is appropriate.
This is the time when old bar
room questions require new an
swers. Like what do you do, and
where do you live? There are
those with honest and honorable
answers: "I'm here on a Fulbright,
studying local orphanage culture
and regularly sending thank-you
notes and kilos of baklava to my
faculty godmother," or "I live in a
really cool loft in the Village."
Some, living a decidedly less ro
mantic reality, must be creative.
Most likely, the boy with the really
cool loft rarely actually sees it,
spending most of his time trying
desperately to afford it. Having
met an appealing candidate for
the evening — a girl with flawless
ly conditioned hair wearing a gos
samer blouse, tastefully ruffled —
he must avoid her critical eye and
cleverly parry her questions.
"After all," thinks the boy, "she or
ders Grey Goose cosmopolitans."
Meanwhile, the daytime office
assistant — this evening's appeal

ing candidate - feelsa little embar
rassed by her obvious act, fidgets,
and when it comes, takes a too-big
gulp of the beverage. The boy
reels back, confronted by a show
of courage so obviously superior
to his own coffee-tortured liver's
potential. "I'm a button-down
rock star," he wheezes to the still
hanging question. "1 sleep over at
the methadone clinic. Five kind
nuns care for me." The wit buys
him a giggle, and the courageous
girl buys him a drink.
Later that night at the loft, boy
confesses to girl: "I'm a consul
tant. 1 can barely remember the
color of sky." Girl smiles a soft
priestly smile, absolvingly kisses
his forehead, replies: "And I'm a
paralegal, which means I answer
the telephone and fetch that fat
sonofabitch his ventis, two tea
spoons of sugar, no cream."
Then they achieve more than
honesty.
Though terrifying, the mid
twenties are an exhilaratingly po
tent experience. Working a me
nial job encourages fantasy. The
conflict of pride and reality in
spires creative denial. A struggling
graduate student may take her
advisor's office chair fora spin; a
hospital intern may imagine him
self delivering the next Olsen
twins; Cinderella — the original

behind Office Space and all other
tales of vocational angst — dresses
her broom in a tux, and dances
the whole kitchen clean.
That so many authors accom
plished their best in their twenties
is quite understandable: At no
other time is escape into personal
fiction as necessary. At 23, F. Scott
Fitzgerald despised his work at a
New York advertising firm so
much that he wrote "This Side of

Paradise.' At 25, after finishing an
unhappy career in the Tsar's civil
service, Nikolai Gogol published
the"St. Petersburg Stories," a col
lection expressing his accumulat
ed dissatisfaction with mediocrity
and white collar toil. At 29, Franz
Kafka finally released some of the
scribbles he gathered while work
ing as an insurance analyst;
amongst them the tale of a boy,
still living at home, working a mis

erable job as a clerk, turned into a
cockroach — could there be a
more balanced report of a
decade's self-loathing and an
guish?
Technically, the twenties only
begin alter college graduation.
Because technically, the twenties
are defined as the first phase of de
cline. Whereas before that un

bearably sunny morning in late
spring one dreamt of the future,
afterwards, dreams increasingly
revisit the past.
I here is a perfectly scientific
explanation: The morning's heat
melts memory and fantasy togeth
er, combining previously distinct
cerebral lobes and functions.
Neuro-psychologists diagnose the
twenty-something condition by a
sharp increase in the incidence of
ulcers and bleary retrospection.
Besides maybe the Sixties, no
other time is as romantically mis
remembered as the college years.
Compared with middle school's

awkward pubescence and high
school's provincial naivete, col
lege seems mature yet delightful.
Those four years of learning and
discovery are remembered only as
such, as a period of vigorous ex
pansion.
The quarters rush by — new
schedules, epiphanies, classmates
— washing away old disappoint
ments. Screwed up a final? Don't
worry, there'll be plenty more
next quarter. Blundered a
courtship? The sea teems with
other fresh fish. Tired of the Mo-
Mo soda machine? Mix carbonat
ed water with gnava-peach nectar
and enjoy.
While actually there, college
may not seem so carefree and
easy. Yet most forget those
uniquely undergraduate pains

and frustrations: ill-mannered
roommates, arrogant professors,
ignorant but all the more arro
gant TAs, excessively tedious as
signments, arbitrary evaluations,
stultifying columns, strip-search
security procedures at the library,
tequila.
Life narrows and slows after
graduation. Careers and gradu
ate schools require focus and dis
cipline. Interests are whittled into
skills. Suddenly, the few who
didn't conform to the techie/fuzzy
intellectual segregation as under
graduates are forced to decide be
tween mother and father.
It's all very tragic.
