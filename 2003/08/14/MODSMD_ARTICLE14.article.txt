# Let the games begin: Babin preps for the pennant race
## 
### MATT BABIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ah, August. It's still hot outside,
though it gets dark a little bit earlier.
Department stores slash their prices
as students everywhere head hack to
school. Preseason football games are on
television, it seems, every day except Sun
day. The P.C.A. Championship brings the
world's greatest golfers together for the
season's last major.
But no one really cares about any of
that. (Ok, except the kids going back to
school — they care, a lot).
No one cares about the Ranis' third
string c ornerback shutting down the Jets'
soon-to-be-cut wideout; no one cares
about Ernie Els looking over a 17-foot
snake fora birdie because the eyes of the
sports world have fallen to the one place
they belong in August — baseball pennant
races.
With more or less 45 games left in the
season, six of eight playoff spots are still
completely open. As the Weekly went to
press last night Boston trailed the Yankees
by four games, the A's trailed the Mariners
by just three and the A.L Central was a
train wreck with the Royals, the White Sox
and the Twins all within three games ol
first place. Just a game separates the A's
and Red Sox in the wild card race.
In the National League the only division
race still of interest is the Central where
Houston, St. Louis and Chicago seem pre
pared to light to the finish, however ugly
I heir collective pitching may be in the mean
time. And while the Braves and Giants have

all but sealed up their divi
sions an astounding eight
teams are within five-and-a
half games of the wildcard
lead, and thus conceivably
have a shot at a playoff
berth.
Now, while I love base
ball, 1 can understand
those who don't. Those

who say that the pace of the game is too slow
(at times it is), that the players are overpaid
(I agree that they are), that expansion has
diluted the stock of decent pitching and in
flated offensive statistics as a result.
But in August, 1 don't want to hear any
of that.
In August I want to hear about streaks,
pitching matchups and deals at the trad
ing deadline. I want to hear about the
waiver wire, the late score from the West
Coast, and the tiebreak scenarios. I want a
cold beer and a dog. I want second base
men who don't c hange their socks because
they think they're lucky. I want the peanut
vendor who sells to both sections, hitting
the cutoff man with every throw. 1 want
players who watch the scoreboard be
tween innings to see il they're gaining
ground but don't admit it. 1 want dirty
c urves and walk off home runs.
Bring on the drama.
(I don't, however, want a return of the
rally monkey. That thing was awful).
The beauty of the baseball season is that
its length gives meaning to statistics. You
can crunch numbers all you want - batting
averages, on-base percentages, slugging
averages, pitch counts, OPS, ERA, RBI.

You can compute how many runs a team
should score, and how many games they
should win. You can play the percentages,
bringing in your left-handed reliever to
lace their left-handed slugger in the bot
tom of the seventh. Sometimes it'll work.
Sometimes it won't.
Sometimes it won't because even in a
season that lasts for 162 games, the little
things matter. Even in half a year of base
ball you have outliers and flukes. Buried
in all those statistics and averages are
spectacular plays that win games, games
that after six months can acid up to a trip
to October or a trip home for the offsea
son.
I had the distinct pleasure to witness
the first two games of the Red Sox-A's se
ries on Monday and Tuesday night in
Oakland. After tailing into fantastic first
level seats I threw on my Garciaparra jer
sey and old BoSox cap fora trip across the
Bay — where 1 witnessed one of the finest
pitching performances I have ever seen.
Unfortunately not by Pedro Martinez.
Tim Hudson threw a complete game,
two-hit shutout, facing only 28 batters. He
dominated the game completely, and in
doing so got a win for his team, pulling
them even with Boston in the wildcard
standings.
This was a game, statistically, that the
Red Sox should have won. They had their
ace on the mound, they have had good
luck against Hudson in the past, they have
a better offensive team. But on this cool
Oakland night the statistics were rendered
null by an individual effort.
The beauty of the pennant race. What

makes a hitter find his groove against the
best pitcher in baseball? What makes a
pitcher bear down and shut down the
most prolific offense in recent memory?
Oakland, it seems, does this better than
any other team. If the 20-game streak last
year isn't enough evidence, one can look
at the combined statistics of this season
and last. Post-All-Star Break, Oakland is
83-27 in the last two years. That's a win
ning percentage of .755, for those of you
scoring at home.
(In comparison, the Atlanta Braves cur
rently have the best record in baseball with
a winning percentage of .644.)
Will they keep up their play? Maybe. Will
they catch the Mariners? Maybe. Will the
Red Sox survive their 14-game home-and
home series against Oakland and Seattle?
Maybe.
I'd like to think so. But, as a pessimistic
Boston fan, 1 should be more like every
body in the Olde Towne, where a recent
poll showed that 71.4% of the Boston
Globe's readers thought that the Red Sox
(out of the Red Sox, Yankees, Mariners
and A's) would miss the playoffs.
1 won't throw in the towel just yet,
though. I'm still hoping they'll split this
four-game series with the A's . . . and that
I'll see them back here, again, for the play
offs in September. When things really get
interesting.

Matt Babin, Class 0f2003, is currently a Master's
student in International Policy Studies who, much
as he loves the Red Sox, loves Oakland for their two
dollar Wednesdays. Oh, and the Yankees suck. Ob
viously. E-mail him at btikinfa stanford.edu.

four-game series with the A's . . . and that
I'll see them back here, again, for the play
offs in September. When things really get
interesting.

Ah, August. It's still hot outside,
though it gets dark a little bit earlier.
Department stores slash their prices
as students everywhere head hack to
school. Preseason football games are on
television, it seems, every day except Sun
day. The P.C.A. Championship brings the
world's greatest golfers together for the
season's last major.
But no one really cares about any of
that. (Ok, except the kids going back to
school — they care, a lot).
No one cares about the Ranis' third
string c ornerback shutting down the Jets'
soon-to-be-cut wideout; no one cares
about Ernie Els looking over a 17-foot
snake fora birdie because the eyes of the
sports world have fallen to the one place
they belong in August — baseball pennant
races.
With more or less 45 games left in the
season, six of eight playoff spots are still
completely open. As the Weekly went to
press last night Boston trailed the Yankees
by four games, the A's trailed the Mariners
by just three and the A.L Central was a
train wreck with the Royals, the White Sox
and the Twins all within three games ol
first place. Just a game separates the A's
and Red Sox in the wild card race.
In the National League the only division
race still of interest is the Central where
Houston, St. Louis and Chicago seem pre
pared to light to the finish, however ugly
I heir collective pitching may be in the mean
time. And while the Braves and Giants have

all but sealed up their divi
sions an astounding eight
teams are within five-and-a
half games of the wildcard
lead, and thus conceivably
have a shot at a playoff
berth.
Now, while I love base
ball, 1 can understand
those who don't. Those

who say that the pace of the game is too slow
(at times it is), that the players are overpaid
(I agree that they are), that expansion has
diluted the stock of decent pitching and in
flated offensive statistics as a result.
But in August, 1 don't want to hear any
of that.
In August I want to hear about streaks,
pitching matchups and deals at the trad
ing deadline. I want to hear about the
waiver wire, the late score from the West
Coast, and the tiebreak scenarios. I want a
cold beer and a dog. I want second base
men who don't c hange their socks because
they think they're lucky. I want the peanut
vendor who sells to both sections, hitting
the cutoff man with every throw. 1 want
players who watch the scoreboard be
tween innings to see il they're gaining
ground but don't admit it. 1 want dirty
c urves and walk off home runs.
Bring on the drama.
(I don't, however, want a return of the
rally monkey. That thing was awful).
The beauty of the baseball season is that
its length gives meaning to statistics. You
can crunch numbers all you want - batting
averages, on-base percentages, slugging
averages, pitch counts, OPS, ERA, RBI.

You can compute how many runs a team
should score, and how many games they
should win. You can play the percentages,
bringing in your left-handed reliever to
lace their left-handed slugger in the bot
tom of the seventh. Sometimes it'll work.
Sometimes it won't.
Sometimes it won't because even in a
season that lasts for 162 games, the little
things matter. Even in half a year of base
ball you have outliers and flukes. Buried
in all those statistics and averages are
spectacular plays that win games, games
that after six months can acid up to a trip
to October or a trip home for the offsea
son.
I had the distinct pleasure to witness
the first two games of the Red Sox-A's se
ries on Monday and Tuesday night in
Oakland. After tailing into fantastic first
level seats I threw on my Garciaparra jer
sey and old BoSox cap fora trip across the
Bay — where 1 witnessed one of the finest
pitching performances I have ever seen.
Unfortunately not by Pedro Martinez.
Tim Hudson threw a complete game,
two-hit shutout, facing only 28 batters. He
dominated the game completely, and in
doing so got a win for his team, pulling
them even with Boston in the wildcard
standings.
This was a game, statistically, that the
Red Sox should have won. They had their
ace on the mound, they have had good
luck against Hudson in the past, they have
a better offensive team. But on this cool
Oakland night the statistics were rendered
null by an individual effort.
The beauty of the pennant race. What

makes a hitter find his groove against the
best pitcher in baseball? What makes a
pitcher bear down and shut down the
most prolific offense in recent memory?
Oakland, it seems, does this better than
any other team. If the 20-game streak last
year isn't enough evidence, one can look
at the combined statistics of this season
and last. Post-All-Star Break, Oakland is
83-27 in the last two years. That's a win
ning percentage of .755, for those of you
scoring at home.
(In comparison, the Atlanta Braves cur
rently have the best record in baseball with
a winning percentage of .644.)
Will they keep up their play? Maybe. Will
they catch the Mariners? Maybe. Will the
Red Sox survive their 14-game home-and
home series against Oakland and Seattle?
Maybe.
I'd like to think so. But, as a pessimistic
Boston fan, 1 should be more like every
body in the Olde Towne, where a recent
poll showed that 71.4% of the Boston
Globe's readers thought that the Red Sox
(out of the Red Sox, Yankees, Mariners
and A's) would miss the playoffs.
1 won't throw in the towel just yet,
though. I'm still hoping they'll split this
four-game series with the A's . . . and that
I'll see them back here, again, for the play
offs in September. When things really get
