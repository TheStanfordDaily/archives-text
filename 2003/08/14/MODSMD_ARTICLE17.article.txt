# 'Seabiscuit' sentimental but shies from sappy

### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Released in the flurry of summer block
busters, "Seabiscuit," much like its star, has
hung tough with its competition, and rightful
ly so. While goliath action flicks like "Bad Boys
II," "Tomb Raider" and "S.WAT." splatter
screens everywhere, hit number one and in
stantly lade, "Seabiscuit," with its solid perfor
mances and poignant message, has kept pace.
When Oscar season hits, I wouldn't be sur
prised i( this modest little movie takes a sweep
ing lead.

I left the theater after
"Seabiscuit" with tears in my
eyes and an intense desire
to ride a horse. The movie
draws the animals with lov
ing detail, bestowing them
with not only human quali
ties, but also a power and a
passion that humans can
only strive to obtain.
Known as the greatest

racehorse in history, Seabiscuit inspired the
Depression generation of the 19305, providing

lion, a long shot triumph
ing over stumbling odds.
The smallest horse with the
largest jockey, his enor
mous heart separated him
from the pack and made
him a symbol for the Amer
ican Dream.
T lie film's represen
tation of the time period is
both delightful and omi-

nous. From the wealthy to the destitute, the au
dience is treated to the thick '3()s ambience
topped off'with antique cars and costumes. At
the same time, the parallelism between the
horse and the people who cheer him on raises
the stakes and ultimately the suspense. As long
as Seabiscuit keeps winning, there's hope for
the masses in the soup-lines and Hoovervilles
â€” but what if he doesn't?
While the horse serves as a unifying force,
it's arguable that the movie is really about the
three men who guided his career. Charles
Howard (Jeff Bridges) plays a factor)' man
turned automobile mogul, a rare success in a
time of financial failure. With a knack for find
ing talent in unexpected places, Howard buys
Seabiscuit and takes a chance on trainer Tom
Smith (Chris Cooper), a s<x ial outcast with un
orthodox methods.
The last piece of the puzzle is jockey Red Pol
lard (Tobey Maguire), a young-man skidding
just above desperation. Taller than the typical
jockey, his zeal for tiding has forced him to pur
sue what appears to be an impossible dream,
that is, until he meets 1 loward and Smith.
Capitalizing on a traditional "underdog
makes good" storyline, the movie's novelty can
be found in its performances. The characters
transition sicle-by-side and draw us in as they
strengthen their bonds with one another.
Uniquely, we learn the most about Pollard
through his relationship with Seabiscuit, and
the spark of understanding that exists between
them is both intriguing and heartwarming.
Yet, even if you are not one for character
driven drama, the racing scenes are enough to
