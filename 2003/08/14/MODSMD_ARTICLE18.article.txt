# 'Big Brother' towers over reality television
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Indulge me fora moment while I
tell you that "Big Brother" is the l)est
reality show of the millennium — a
genre that has exploded, with a big fat
splat, since the summer of 2000. Yes,
even more than the original "Sur
vivor" or "Making of the Band" or
'Temptation Island" or "Joe Million
aire," the melodrama in the "Big
Brother" house is provocatively pal
pable. And ever since Arnold Shapiro
took over duties as executive produc

erin season two — and repaired the
voting rules that had lx>en adapted
from the British series of the same
name — the series has gotten better
and Ix-tter. Ihat is, until this season,
where h<)use high jinks are a tad tired.
But we'll get to why later.
The overall concept hasn't
changed since the original airing of
the show in July of 2000. Ten or so
homosapiens enter an enclosed
house, witJi no television or Internet
access, and must remain indoors —
competing for f<x>d in the most mun
dane of ways — as diey are eliminat-

Ed, one by one. Ihe last man (or
woman, as was the case in season
three) standing wins a whopping
cash prize of $500,000.
In the first season, America was
given the right to vote contestants out
of the house. But "the masses are
asses," said an indignant Alexander
I lamilton some years ago, and judg
ing by the house politics — where a
boring one-legged man defeated
every other housemate — I lamilton
was right.
So when Shapiro t<x>k over in
2001, he took away America's right to

vote. And justifiably. (Suffrage has
also been undermined by voting
trends on Simon Cowell's "Cupid"
and, as importantly, the last presi
dential election between Cleorge W.
Bush and A1 (Jore.) Instead, house
guests compete each week for the
much-coveted Head of Household
(HoH, for short) prize, where they
are awarded not only the perks of a
private bedroom and laundry ser
vices, but the privilege of nominating
two of their own peel's for eviction.
And a mere tew days later, die re
maining houseguests vote on which
of those two gets the boot.
If any ot this seems complicated,
or even a tacl convoluted, then try fol
lowing the niles ot "For Love or
Money 2" or the canceled TV game
show "Greed." With me? Bueno! In
the List two years, the series has re
sulted in some of television's most lov
able heroes, lake, for instance, l.ist
year's Danielle—the black mother of
two — who wiis able to play the
houseguests like a concerto pianist.
Or remember the moment when
Marcellas, the gay stylist with flair,
was evicted from die house, and no
other event in TV history (aside per
haps tor ".Alias") proved as shocking
— or startling — for the collective
moral conscience of mankind. Or
take Nicole, the deep-voiced radio
announcer from season two, who es
caped the first round of eviction ;uid
used her loyalty with lies to make it
into the finals.
And now, at last, we've arrived to
"Big Brother 4" — a series that
seems slightly stale in comparison to
die last two glorious seasons. The
reason lies in Shapiro's latest twist,
die X-factor, in which 10 of die 13
houseguests have entered the Big
Brother domain with an ex-fling. It
was a move that originally inspired
troubles and even a few direats
— but since original spats, life has
simmered down and the ex-mates
have even become warmly affection
ate toward one another.
Which is unbrotherly indeed: the
series has worked so far because al
liances realigned after every eviction.
This year, die contestants are practi
cally too stuck-up to scheme. Still, a
few unmentionable moments need
to be mentioned — including a too
hot-for-TV night between David (a
former army ranger) and Amanda
(a former bar manager), where b<xl
ily fluids were exchanged, and we're
not just talking about saliva. Host
Julie Chen, a milder version of Con
nie Chung without die verbal skills,
called the evening a "first" in the
American version of the series — al
though it was nowhere near virgin
territory for the well-traveled mates.
Furthermore, good TV was a by
product of antics from Dana — last
week's evicted houseguest. Affection
ately called the "man troll" by die
odier contestants, because of her
masculine mannerisms, the brunette
brute from Queens, N.Y. tried to
strong-arm her way into victory —
first, by choosing one side, then by
choosing another. By the end of the
game, nobody trusted her, and the
eviction crown was hers to keep.
file series is still salvageable, even
with slightly square contestants.
(Watch CBS, Tuesday 8 p.m.,
Wednesday 9 p.m., Friday 8 p.m.)
I'm predicting with only seven
houseguests remaining, loyalties will
wither like flower petals.

Indulge me fora moment while I
tell you that "Big Brother" is the l)est
reality show of the millennium — a
genre that has exploded, with a big fat
splat, since the summer of 2000. Yes,
even more than the original "Sur
vivor" or "Making of the Band" or
'Temptation Island" or "Joe Million
aire," the melodrama in the "Big
Brother" house is provocatively pal
pable. And ever since Arnold Shapiro
took over duties as executive produc

erin season two — and repaired the
voting rules that had lx>en adapted
from the British series of the same
name — the series has gotten better
and Ix-tter. Ihat is, until this season,
where h<)use high jinks are a tad tired.
But we'll get to why later.
The overall concept hasn't
changed since the original airing of
the show in July of 2000. Ten or so
homosapiens enter an enclosed
house, witJi no television or Internet
access, and must remain indoors —
competing for f<x>d in the most mun
dane of ways — as diey are eliminat-

Ed, one by one. Ihe last man (or
woman, as was the case in season
three) standing wins a whopping
cash prize of $500,000.
In the first season, America was
given the right to vote contestants out
of the house. But "the masses are
asses," said an indignant Alexander
I lamilton some years ago, and judg
ing by the house politics — where a
boring one-legged man defeated
every other housemate — I lamilton
was right.
So when Shapiro t<x>k over in
2001, he took away America's right to

vote. And justifiably. (Suffrage has
also been undermined by voting
trends on Simon Cowell's "Cupid"
and, as importantly, the last presi
dential election between Cleorge W.
Bush and A1 (Jore.) Instead, house
guests compete each week for the
much-coveted Head of Household
(HoH, for short) prize, where they
are awarded not only the perks of a
private bedroom and laundry ser
vices, but the privilege of nominating
two of their own peel's for eviction.
And a mere tew days later, die re
maining houseguests vote on which
of those two gets the boot.
If any ot this seems complicated,
or even a tacl convoluted, then try fol
lowing the niles ot "For Love or
Money 2" or the canceled TV game
show "Greed." With me? Bueno! In
the List two years, the series has re
sulted in some of television's most lov
able heroes, lake, for instance, l.ist
year's Danielle—the black mother of
two — who wiis able to play the
houseguests like a concerto pianist.
Or remember the moment when
Marcellas, the gay stylist with flair,
was evicted from die house, and no
other event in TV history (aside per
haps tor ".Alias") proved as shocking
— or startling — for the collective
moral conscience of mankind. Or
take Nicole, the deep-voiced radio
announcer from season two, who es
caped the first round of eviction ;uid
used her loyalty with lies to make it
into the finals.
And now, at last, we've arrived to
"Big Brother 4" — a series that
seems slightly stale in comparison to
die last two glorious seasons. The
reason lies in Shapiro's latest twist,
die X-factor, in which 10 of die 13
houseguests have entered the Big
Brother domain with an ex-fling. It
was a move that originally inspired
troubles and even a few direats
— but since original spats, life has
simmered down and the ex-mates
have even become warmly affection
ate toward one another.
Which is unbrotherly indeed: the
series has worked so far because al
liances realigned after every eviction.
This year, die contestants are practi
cally too stuck-up to scheme. Still, a
few unmentionable moments need
to be mentioned — including a too
hot-for-TV night between David (a
former army ranger) and Amanda
(a former bar manager), where b<xl
ily fluids were exchanged, and we're
not just talking about saliva. Host
Julie Chen, a milder version of Con
nie Chung without die verbal skills,
called the evening a "first" in the
American version of the series — al
though it was nowhere near virgin
territory for the well-traveled mates.
Furthermore, good TV was a by
product of antics from Dana — last
week's evicted houseguest. Affection
ately called the "man troll" by die
odier contestants, because of her
masculine mannerisms, the brunette
brute from Queens, N.Y. tried to
strong-arm her way into victory —
first, by choosing one side, then by
choosing another. By the end of the
game, nobody trusted her, and the
eviction crown was hers to keep.
file series is still salvageable, even
with slightly square contestants.
(Watch CBS, Tuesday 8 p.m.,
Wednesday 9 p.m., Friday 8 p.m.)
I'm predicting with only seven
houseguests remaining, loyalties will
wither like flower petals.
