# 'Big Brother' towers over reality television
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Indulge me fora moment while I
tell you that "Big Brother" is the l)est
reality show of the millennium — a
genre that has exploded, with a big fat
splat, since the summer of 2000. Yes,
even more than the original "Sur
vivor" or "Making of the Band" or
'Temptation Island" or "Joe Million
aire," the melodrama in the "Big
Brother" house is provocatively pal
pable. And ever since Arnold Shapiro
took over duties as executive produc

erin season two — and repaired the
voting rules that had lx>en adapted
from the British series of the same
name — the series has gotten better
and Ix-tter. Ihat is, until this season,
where h<)use high jinks are a tad tired.
But we'll get to why later.
The overall concept hasn't
changed since the original airing of
the show in July of 2000. Ten or so
homosapiens enter an enclosed
house, witJi no television or Internet
access, and must remain indoors —
competing for f<x>d in the most mun
dane of ways — as diey are eliminat-

Ed, one by one. Ihe last man (or
woman, as was the case in season
three) standing wins a whopping
cash prize of $500,000.
In the first season, America was
given the right to vote contestants out
of the house. But "the masses are
asses," said an indignant Alexander
I lamilton some years ago, and judg
ing by the house politics — where a
boring one-legged man defeated
every other housemate — I lamilton
was right.
So when Shapiro t<x>k over in
2001, he took away America's right to

vote. And justifiably. (Suffrage has
also been undermined by voting
trends on Simon Cowell's "Cupid"
and, as importantly, the last presi
dential election between Cleorge W.
Bush and A1 (Jore.) Instead, house
guests compete each week for the
much-coveted Head of Household
(HoH, for short) prize, where they
are awarded not only the perks of a
private bedroom and laundry ser
vices, but the privilege of nominating
two of their own peel's for eviction.
