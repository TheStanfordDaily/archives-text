# 'Le Divorce' a bad split from a good past
## 
### ROBERTO PRIETO 
Given the track records of its
cast and crew, "Le Divorce" talis
short of its potential. It is an incon
sistent, rambling film that neither
engages its audience nor makes
any particular statement.
Surprisingly, this is not the tra
ditional period piece we are accus
tomed to from Merchant Ivory
Productions, but a comedy of sorts
set in contemporary Paris. Based
on Diane Johnson's 1994 novel,
the film plays on the stereotypes
the French and the Americans love
to attribute to each other. While
charming at times, the film fails to
get us to care about the characters,
mainly because they themselves
don't seem to care. There is a mur
der, an attempted suicide and a
hostage crisis at the top of the Eiffel
Tower, but because it's all done in
such a nonchalant manner, there is
very little emotional involvement
from the audience. Granted, the
film is billed as a comedy, but it's
hard to find the humor in a series
of tragic events.

It opens with all-American girl
Isabel (Kate Hudson) coming to
France to stay with her pregnant
sister Roxy (Naomi Watts). We
soon find out that Roxy's French
husband is leaving her for another
woman and has asked her fora di
vorce. Isabel helps her sister
through this difficult time and
finds work with free-spirited
American writer Olivia Pace,
played by Glenn Glose. She also be
gins to sample the wide variety of
French men available to her, in
cluding a young artiste (Romain
Duris from "L'Auberge Espag
nole") and a much older but dash
ing French politician. Roxy's
pending divorce creates the neces
sary conflict between the couple's

French and American families that
highlights their cultural differ
ences and their distrust of each
other.
The film's strongest asset is its
ensemble cast. Stockard Channing
is her usual outstanding sell as Is
abel and Roxy's mother, Sam Wa
terston as their father, Leslie
Caron as Roxy's mother-in-law,
Bebe Neuwirth as a Getty art cura
tor, Matthew Modine as a betrayed
husband, and Stephen Fry making
a cameo appearance as a Christie's
art expert.
They all do what they can with
the somewhat disjointed and unin
teresting script, but ultimately not
enough to save the film. You can't
help but wonder whether Mer
chant and Ivory actually believe
that neither the French nor the
Americans have any intensity or
emotional depth. Watts and Hud
son deliver flat performances, a
major disappointment given
Watts' great star wattage as dis
played in David Lynch's "Mulhol
land Drive."
Hudson is somewhat more suc

cessful, playing her usual cute and
fluffy self, making this a good
venue for her to show off her girl
ish charm.
Besides the cast, the attractive
visuals make the film easier to di
gest. The shots of Paris are often
breathtaking and evoke the kind of
"joie de vivre" that we of ten associ
ate with the French lifestyle.
Maybe that's why these characters
seem to magically rebound from
the trials of life: No matter what

gets thrown their way, they feel for
tunate to be in one of the most
beautiful cities in the world.
"Le Divorce" could be considered
an European comedy in the tradition
of "Sex and the City", but it lacks the
charm and wit of the HBO series.
Foreign films are known and ad
mired for their realism and their in
tensity, but "Le Divorce" lacks both.
Hopefully Merchant Ivory will return
to what they do best, and their next
attempt will be more satisfying.
