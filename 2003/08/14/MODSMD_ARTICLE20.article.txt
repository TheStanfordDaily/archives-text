# 'Lollapalooza' back on stage and rockin'
## Mega-concert finally returns 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ ED SCOTT 
Lollapalooza is back! The
much anticipated festival, creat
ed by Jane's Addiction lead
singer Pern Ferrell in 1991, has
finally returned after a five-year
hiatus to its mission of uniting
diverse musical genres (alterna
tive rock, grunge, industrial,
electronica and rap) into one
twelve-hour, on-stage party.
This may seem like a daunt
ing task, but with headliners
like Jane's Addiction, Au
dioslave, and Incubus setting
the tone for big and small
bands on two stages, Lolla
palooza makes a game effort.
At the July 27th show at
Jones Beach Amphitheatre in
Long Island, with a second
stage party raging in the park
ing lot, the Distillers opened
to a sparsely populated stadi
um, their raspingly incoher
ent vocals and monotonous
guitar riffs echoing off every
empty seat in the house. Lead
singer Brody Armstrong, hid
den behind gothic make-up
and a surly expression, deliv
ered a thirty-minute set that
left my head aching and
Brody puking into the ocean

stage right.
The Donnas, a four-mem
ber girl group from Palo Alto,
took the stage as well. But as re
freshing as a rock-and-roll fe
male act is to the world of
music, The Donnas will have to
work much harder to match
the staying power of female
predecessors such as Pat Be
natar. Heart, and Blondie; the
chorus of their hit single "Who
Invited You" seemed to fit
neatly into every other song
they performed. To their cred
it, however, guitarist Allison
Robertson stole the set with her
Pantene Pro-V advertisement
locks and some very deft solo
work.
When the last pair of pink
Converse shoes left the stage, a
50 foot turntable backdrop
was erected and the six man
crew of Jurassic Five strolled
out. The group, composed of
four MCs and two DJs, boasts
an old-school style of hip-hop:
amplified funk beats, precise
vocal harmonizing, and liberal
scratching. With a combina
tion of spontaneous break
dancing sessions and audience
sing-a-longs, Jurassic Five
changed the mood of show
and provided a welcome
respite from piercing guitar
feedback.
Queens of the Stone Age,
much more "Stone Age" than

"Queens", were predictably
fast, hard, loud, and fun. The
Queens lack the versatility and
nuance of a great band, but
they can rock with the best of
them.
Incubus was the surprising
musical star of the show.
Though the band has been crit
icized by some of their rock
brethren for their perceived
"pussy rock," they provided
the most musically compelling
performance of the evening,
playing an eclectic set that en
compassed songs from their
first record, "Science," to their
most recent record, "Morning
View," proving that lead singer
Brandon Boyd has a pretty
amazing voice to accompany
that pretty face. Though lack
ing the stadium rock perfor
mance qualities of Audioslave
or Jane's Addiction, Incubus
featured a lyricism and subtlety
in short supply on this tour,
making their transitions into
pure rock all the more exciting.
Audioslave provided the
first real rock show of the
evening — a combination of
Rage Against the Machine gui
tarist Tom Morello and bassist
Tom Commerford and former
Sound Garden front man
Chris Cornell — unites Rage's
signature guitar raids with
Sound Garden's soulful edge.
Cornell was particularly inter

active, stroking front row vix
ens, diving off the stage to run
through the crowd, and en
couraging audience participa
tion, all the while singing Au
dioslave favorites and an
amped-up White Stripes cover.
Jane's Addiction, next, pro
vided the first real rock pro
duction, complete with an
elaborate set and three infi
nitely flexible and increasingly
naked dancers (one of whom is
married to front-man Perry
Farrell). Like Lollapalooza's
return from a long hiatus,
Jane's Addiction just released
"Strays," their first new album
in thirteen years. Perry Farrell
and guitarist Dave Navarro
dominated this flamboyant re
turn, and bassist Chris
Chaney, keyboarder Matt
Rohde, and percussionist
Stephen Perkins were non-en
tities in the face of Kartell's
smoothly swiveling hips and
Navarro's brooding sensuali
ty. Notwithstanding the eye
candy, the music, including
classics like "Jane Says," still
sounded tight and energized.
Why go to Lollapalooza?
T he answer really might be, in
the words of Perry Farrell,
"Just Because."
Lollapalooza comes to the
Shoreline Amphitheatre in
Mountain View on August
19th.
