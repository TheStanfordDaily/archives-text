S.W.A.T.
\\ hilt this movie s i<tpid transitions from one crisis to
another make "S.YV.A.T." mildly diverting, the pre
dictable plot, chemistry-less characters and dull dialogue
make it an unexciting movie-going experience.
S.VV .A. I. basically consists of a constant barrage of
bullets flying, cars crashing and things blowing up. But
the movie lacks suspense —from the beginning we know
who will be up to no good — while these violent displays
are eye-catching, the movie sags between the action
scenes. Luckily, viewers needn't wait long between ex
plosions.
The best way to describe "S.W.A.T.": average. In a
summer piled high with dull and disappointing block
busters, "S.WAT." is just another mediocre flick to add
to the list.

Gigli
I lie only surprise of this entire film is that Jennifer
Lope/ and Ben Affleck weren't the root cause of "C iigli'"s
miserable failure. While their performances were not
Oscar contenders, they were acceptable. However, this
unexpected discovery was poor consolation for having to
sit through this movie.
112 he story, which is bad to begin with, does not play
out well, the characters are simply unbelievable and the
movie comes off in the end as a horrible experiment be
tween "Rain Man" and "Chasing Amy." Writer/director
Martin Brest miserably fails at providing an appropriate
pace for the movie.
In a nutshell, "Gigli" is as bad as you've heard it is. A
painful script and horrible directing essentially eliminate
any hope of a plausible movie.

American Wedding
Although "American Wedding," the third and final
installment in the "American Pie" series, has thoroughly
mixed and baked in some the necessary ingredients of a
good movie, the final product is palatable but not satisfy
ing, even when fresh out of the oven.
Jim (Jason liiggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan)
are going to wed.
Although the script is lack-luster and the basic story is
uninteresting, the performances from Jason Biggs,
Seann VV. Scott and Eugene Levy keep the material fresh
and funny.
It's worth seeing "American Wedding (or the wildly
funny and creative (albeit disgusting) comedy sequences,
but don't expect much more from a pie that is only half
baked at best.
