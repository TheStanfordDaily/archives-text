"Secretary"
"Secretary," the darkly romantic comedy from director
Steven Shainberg, doesn't waste any time getting your at
tention: In its first scene, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal)
walks through a kitschy,colorful office, her arms fastened to
a horizontal bar across her shoulders. She gracefully uses
her mouth to pull a letter from her typewriter and grabs a
cup of coffee with one of her hands, then saunters down the
hall into the central office, closing the door behind her with
her foot.
It's beautiful and sexy and scary, all at once. The film
grabs you, promising glorious weirdness to come, before
hurling you back six months earlier.
Lee was released from her slay at a mental institution
jus! in time for her sister's wedding. But her continued
alienation is painfully palpable in every scene, as is her de
spair at her father's alcoholism; you can almost understand
why, for Lee, cutting herself might be a kind of relief. Fi
nally, desperate to get out of the house, Lee applies fora
job as a secretary at the office of lawyer E. Edward Grey
(James Spader).
What follows is a give-and-take romance that alternates
between hysterically funny and deeply moving. Lee and Ed
ward clearly lust after each other, but Edward resists his
longing, channeling it into both into a tentative courtship of
Lee and an explosive rage. Eventually, he calls her into her
office and spanks her for her typos, but instead of scaring her
away, this only increases Lee's attraction to him. Soon, Lee
and Edward have turned the office into their own private,
kinky safe haven, but they must still contend with judgmen
tal relatives, Lee's bumbling boyfriend and, most of all, Ed
ward's growing sense of guilt and shame.
Ultimately, the film's potentially jarring mix of unconven
tional trappings and a conventional Love Conquers All story
line succeeds because Shainberg and screenwriter Erin (Iressi
da Wilson (working from a short story by Mary Gatskill) are so
clearly devoted to their protagonists, and because Gyllenhaal
and Spader so completely inhabit their characters, that you feel
the depth of Lee and Edward's connection. Like any good love
story, "Secretary" is about two lost souls who find each other—
in this case with the help of assorted ropes, handcuffs and a
saddle — and suddenly aren't so lost anymore.
