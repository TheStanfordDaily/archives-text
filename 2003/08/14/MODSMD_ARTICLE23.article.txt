## Silent hill 3 
### ERIC FORD 
Move over "Resident Evil," the third installment of
"Silent Hill" brings twice the fear, three times the
gore, and only half of the awful control scheme.
For those unfamiliar with Konami's thriller series,
"Silent Hill" is a collection of horror games that all
take place in a town bearing the same name. While
not nearly as popular as Capcom's "Resident Evil" se
ries, "Silent Hill" has relied more on immersing the
player in the truly bizarre, creating a different kind of
fear than the somewhat more subtle "Resident Evil."
In the end, it comes down to this: in most horror
games, the fear of the unknown is what scares the
gamer. In "Silent Hill," you know something is com
ing, but you are never prepared for what you see, and
end up frightened regardless. In my opinion, this sec
ond fear is much scarier, and much more fun.
"Silent Hill 3" stars a 17-year-old girl named
Heather, who finds herself mysteriously transported
from her normal world into an alternative reality in
which everything is horribly distorted (evil monsters,
blood-filled rooms, the works). After completing ob
jectives, she's taken back to her world fora short while
before transporting again. Eventually she learns from
other secondary characters that she is the key to solv
ing this mysteriously gruesome world and decides to
find out the truth about it all. The story is much more
direct than the previous two titles, revealing a great
deal of the backstory in a short amount of time.
In any horror game, the key to a great scare is good
presentation — mainly good visuals and sound. For
tunately, "Silent Hill 3" doesn't disappoint. The visu
als are on par with any of the current great PS2 hits
on the market, and easily beat any other horror game
out there. Konami has made the effort to present the
gamer with the ugliest and most freakish enemies,
and they are pretty intense. Half the time, you won't
be able to describe what attacked you, and even as you
get further into the game, you never quite get used to
enemies that you've seen many times before.
The sound will scare the living daylights out of you
initially, but afterwards can get occasionally annoy
ing. The whole premise involves having the player
spend a bit of time in complete silence, and then
throwing loud, weird sound effects at them, catching
the player off-guard. It works, but not all the time.
I he music, however, intrigued me. There are a few
rock tracks on the soundtrack, which are strangely

appropriate fora horror video game. Also included
are the customary horror-esque orchestrated tracks,
which are also effective.
Overall, the presentation is nearly flawless, making
this a great fear game.
The control scheme, on the other hand, is one of
the main flaws of the game. While most games of this
nature have horrid control, "Silent Hill" at least tries
to rectify it. There are a few minor options in assign
ing buttons, and movement is a little easier than "Res
ident Evil" (once you get the hang of it). However, it's
still awkward overall to play, and when you're freaked
out by the game and trying to get out of a room real
ly fast, it gets hard to move. But this only detracts
mildly from the gameplay.
There are also a few minor things about "Silent Hill
3" that may irritate gamers. For one thing, the game
does not pause when the player is reading something
that is discovered in the game. While this may make it
more realistic or challenging in the eyes of the devel
oper, it's not fun having monsters take a stab at you
while you're trying to figure out a puzzle. Also, the
screen is very dark, so dark you may just have to play
this in the dark simply so that you can make out the
game. Finally, there's the problem of the two thou
sand doors that exist in the game with broken locks
that cannot be opened, which can be very irritating
when running from a bunch of monsters.
Regardless, "Silent Hill 3" is a great horror game. Hie
excellent presentation will leave you too scared to even
worry about the sub-par control or the other little irri
tating nuances. Play it in the dark (and with a friend if
you can), and be prepared to be frightened much more
than any horror film that's been released these days.
