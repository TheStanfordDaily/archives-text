## Search for dean expands Professional research firm called in to assist with selection 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
After failing to select a new dean of stu
dents from six final-round candidates last
spring, the University's selection commit
tee — chaired by Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni — is using a
professional research firm to aid it during
a new round of the search.
"When the search committee met to re
view the candidates in June, the group's
consensus was that, although some of the
candidates seemed qualified, none of them
met all of the desired criteria," Awakuni
said.
Following the same process as was used
last spring, the search committee will
choose qualified candidates to be inter
viewed during autumn quarter. Open
student forums with candidates — which
had a low turnout in the spring — and
meetings with student leaders are also
planned. Awakuni said that they hope to
select a new dean by the end of October.
"It's tough to find a 'reason' as to why
the right candidate did not emerge other
than sometimes that won't happen in the
first round of a process like this," said
former Faculty Senate Student Repre
sentative Blake Naughton, a graduate
student in education and one of two stu
dent representatives on the committee.
"We were thorough then and will be
thorough in this round.
"The standards fora dean of students
are very high — he or she has [to] believe
in a strong student life on campus and
students' ability to shape their own expe
rience[s], be responsive to increasing
legal and personal student crises, manage
a strong staff and large budget and be a
communication conduit between the stu
dents and the administration," he added.
The search began last January after
Marc Wais, the former dean of students,

announced that he was leaving Stanford
on March 28 to become vice president of
student affairs at New York University.
Christine Griffith, associate dean and di
rector of graduate life, is serving as acting
dean until a permanent replacement is
found.
The search committee, made up of ad
ministrators, students, faculty and staff,
met for the first time in May to select six
final candidates for on-campus inter
views.
"The interviews in the spring went
well, in that different candidates had dif
ferent strengths and brought different
experiences to the table — seeing the
[six] candidates gave us an idea of what is
out there as far as persons who would be
interested in such a job," said ASSU Pres
ident Nadiya Figueroa, a rising senior,
who met the former candidates when
they were introduced to student leaders.
After the candidates visited, the search
committee, rather then making a final de
cision as planned, decided to continue
looking.
"It's a tough thing to find someone for
a job that requires such a diverse skill set
and in such a unique environment like
Stanford," Naughton said. " The commit
tee decided we needed to see some more
people to see if we could find a closer
match to what we are looking for."
The committee unanimously agreed
to reopen the search and to enlist the ser
vices of a professional search firm.
"The type of person we would really
love for this position is probably not out
looking fora job and might not respond
to an e-notice or ad — but might respond
to a professional firm," said Figueroa,
who attended the student leader meet
ings with candidates in May.
Awakuni chose Isaacson, Miller, an ex
ecutive search firm based in Boston, be
cause of their experience in the field of
higher education, in which they have
completed more than 30 searches for
Harvard University and Colum
bia University, as well as having a
high level of familiarity with
Stanford. The same firm is con
ducting the search fora new
Haas Center for Public Service
director to replace Nadinne
Cruz.
Isaacson, Miller is responsible
for finding, sorting, screening
and presenting candidates, a
part of the process that
Naughton described as time con
suming and difficult. Past this
point of initial selection, howev
er, the committee's role has not
changed.
Bringing in outside services,
Awakuni said, "in no way dimin
ishes the role of the search com
mittee or the importance of stu
dent input."
The firm became involved at
the beginning of July and has
been conducting background re
search on the dean of students
position and its particular na
ture. At the most recent meeting
of the search committee in early
August, Isaacson, Miller repre
sentatives discussed the pro
posed timeline and process for
the search.
Naughton said that he felt
confident after meeting with
them that "they know what they
are doing."
The final decision on the new
dean will be made by Awakuni,
with the consultation of Univer
sity President John Hennessy
and Provost John Etchemendy
and the advice of the search
committee.
