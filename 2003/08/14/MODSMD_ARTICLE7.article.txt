# Hacking spree strikes campus

### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Three waves of hacker attacks have allect
ed nearly 3,000 Stanford computers since July
31, exploiting a Microsoft Windows vulnera
bility called "RP(I buffer overflow" that allows
hackers to take control of entire systems. In
formation Technology Systems and Services is
asking students to instill new security software
to prevent any further spread of infection.
Campus computers running Microsoft
Windows NT, 2000 and XP are susceptible to
attack, in addition to any home computers
that dial into Stanford or connect by broad
band lines.
ITSS Director Cedric Bennett said the Uni
versity believes the infections might be attrib
uted to laptops brought from outside campus
and plugged into the network. The laptop

users were probably not aware that their sys
tems carried the virus at the time, he added.
Microsoft announced the existence of the
Windows vulnerability on July 16, simultane
ously releasing a patch, or update, that would
prevent attacks and infection.
"Any unpatched system that was running
011 the network and not protected by other
means, like a firewall, was likely to be attacked,
including clusters and home machines," Ben
nett said. "Not all ll' addresses were
attacked — but that is only a matter of time."
The only way to repair a compromised sys
tem is to reformat the hard drive, download
the patch and then reinstall any backed-up
data or applications.
"There are no surgical approaches for
most of these exploits," Bennett said. "The in-

fected machine must be wiped
clean and rebuilt, [which] can take
up to four hours per machine or
longer."
More than 2,400 machines were
infected in the first two waves of at
tacks, .uul ITSS believes that at least
500 more systems have been dam
aged by the third exploit, known as
the MS Blaster Worm, which struck
Aug. 11. Bennett said it may take
weeks before the bugs have been
cleaned out of all campus computers.
"These exploits are called stealth
attacks because the) do not overtly
do anything that might be noticed
by the user, at first," Bennett said.
"The idea, from the hacker's per
spective, is to gain control of the ma
chine so it can be used at a later
time."
Because the attacks are
launched so deep within the oper
ating system, it may be difficult for

users to identify infection. Symp
toms may Ix* as subtle as a disap
pearance of the virus protection
icon from a computer's desktop, or
as obvious as continuous rebooting.
ITSS said there is cause for concern
if an exclamation mark appears on
the Norton Antivirus icon or ifa file
named update.exe exists in the
root director) of the user's hard
drive.
'T his attack is primarily differ
ent [from past attacks] in its sophis
tication and its rapidity," Bennett
said. "Several of the attacks did a
great, deal to try to cover their
tracks."
"In most cases, [hackers] insert
some code onto the machine to dis
able any anti-virus software, and
then open a 'back door,' like a spe
cial phone number, that allows the
hacker to call back later and take
over the machine," Bennett said.
"In some cases the exploit also ran
the patch to fix the vulnerability to
prevent some other hacker from
gaining control."
Although the hackers' intentions

remain unclear, Bennett saiil it is
possible they attacked campus com
puters to collect personal or private
information, or to inconvenience
the Univei-sity by wiping out the
disk drives.
"Stanford has a very fast, open
network," Bennett said. "It is open,
rather than closed like many busi
ness networks, because of the nature
of an institution of higher education
— sharing, communication and
learning are all watchwords for us.
"It is this openness that makes us
potentially more vulnerable," he
continued. "[But] there are ways to
mitigate that vulnerability."
ITSS is taking measures to slow
the spread of these viruses and pre
vent future strikes, urging campus
users to continuously update their
anti-virus software. New operating
systems, including Windows XP,
are usually designed to alert users
when a new patch is available and
help them load it, Bennett said. New
vulnerability and patch alerts will
also be provided at http://secure
