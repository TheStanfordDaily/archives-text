# Hacking spree strikes campus

Three waves of hacker attacks have allect
ed nearly 3,000 Stanford computers since July
31, exploiting a Microsoft Windows vulnera
bility called "RP(I buffer overflow" that allows
hackers to take control of entire systems. In

asking students to instill new security software
to prevent any further spread of infection.
Campus computers running Microsoft
Windows NT, 2000 and XP are susceptible to
attack, in addition to any home computers
that dial into Stanford or connect by broad
band lines.
ITSS Director Cedric Bennett said the Uni
versity believes the infections might be attrib
uted to laptops brought from outside campus
and plugged into the network. The laptop

users were probably not aware that their sys
tems carried the virus at the time, he added.
Microsoft announced the existence of the
Windows vulnerability on July 16, simultane
ously releasing a patch, or update, that would
prevent attacks and infection.
"Any unpatched system that was running
011 the network and not protected by other
means, like a firewall, was likely to be attacked,
including clusters and home machines," Ben
nett said. "Not all ll' addresses were
attacked â€” but that is only a matter of time."
The only way to repair a compromised sys
tem is to reformat the hard drive, download
the patch and then reinstall any backed-up
data or applications.
"There are no surgical approaches for
most of these exploits," Bennett said. "The in-
