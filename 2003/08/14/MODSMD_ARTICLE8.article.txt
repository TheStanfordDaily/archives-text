# Board of Trustees adopts new seal
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The University Board of
Trustees recently approved the es
tablishment of an official seal for the
Farm. Previously, Stanford lac ked
any single seal that could be univer
sally employed by all campus offices
and affiliates.
"When we did a trademark audit
when I first came to the University,
we discovered there were five seals
in use," said Susan Weinstein, direc
tor of business development. "That
is an emblem that is really some
t thing that reflects the academic tra

ditions of the University, and typi
cally a university [only] has one."
The Board ofTrustees, the Presi
dent's Office and the Registrar's Of
fice, among other campus offices and
committees, all had their own indi
vidual seal designs before.
According to Weinstein, the
most recent rendition of the Stan
ford seal is not new in content, but
rather, it "incorporated all the tradi
tional emblems of the University."
The new version of the seal still
features El Palo Alto, a redwood
tree that Caspar de Portola used as
a landmark in 1769. However, it
revises the phrase "Organized

1891" that appears in a prior 1920
version of the seal to only read
"1891."
She explained that "though the
Board of Trustees decided to adopt
it as the single seal," use of the new
seal design "is not required — peo
ple are still freetodowhat they need
to do — hut it is encouraged."
Weinstein said that embracing
emblematic consistency has the
double advantage of reducing bud
gets — graphic work lor items such
as stationary or business cards can
more easily be centralized, and thus,

made less costly — and strengthen
ing the impact and meaning of a
graphic like the University's seal.
"When I first came to Stanford, 1

was struck by how casually we use
our emblems, which are very pre
cious University resources," said
Vice President for Business Affairs
Randy Livingston to the Stanford
Report. "It's important that we pro
tect Stanford's good name and en
sure that its most important symbols
— especially the seal — are used

appropriately and with respect for
the academic traditions and integri
ty they represent."
The move to create the new au
thoritative seal is part of a wider at
tempt by officials to secure a more
"consistent graphical identity" for
the University as a whole.
"Stanford is a richly complex and
diverse institution," said University
President John Hennessy. "Our
goal with this program is to com
municate our shared heritage as
well as our common mission. In an
era where an increasing number of
activities cross school boundaries,
we need to reinforce that Stanford is
one university, rather than an unre
lated collection of colleges and pro
fessional schools. Our hope is that

every department and unit will ben
efit from its affiliation with Stanford,
and that the whole university will be
recognized as more than the sum of
its parts."
Most students agreed with I len
nessy's sentiments.
"It is an obvious choice to en
dorse one seal for widespread use,'
said Tom Hanada, a rising junior.
"Otherwise, a student could poten
tially graduate from Stanford with
one seal on his admission letter, an
other on his diploma and a third de
sign on the invitation he receives to
his class reunion. What sense would
that make? What kind of message
would the University be sending
with that much inconsistency, from
start to finish?"
