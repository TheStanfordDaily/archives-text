# After the unexpected departure of former Director Nadinne Cruz, the search continues for a permanent replacement
## Ortolano discusses his approach to Haas leadership 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
ing coursework to prepare stu
dents to do fellowships in Africa. So
its not just that we view service
learning as an activity that's con
fined to particular sets of courses.
We also view it in the context of our
fellowship programs, we view it in
the context of Alternative Spring
Break, we view it in the context of
the training that we provide these
student service groups that use the
resources of the Haas Center. So
we have a very broad range of pro
grams, and service-learning cours
es and research permeate the
whole process.
TD: I l)elieve it was two years ago
that the Stanford labor Action
Coalition left the Haas Center. And
I don't know if you're able to talk
about the circumstances surround
ing that.
LO: They left the Haas Center?
TD: Or they were kicked out, I'm
not exactly clear on that point ei
ther.
LO: I have to say that I'm really not
familiar with the details of what hap
pened.
TD: C )kay, then from that, how does
the Haas Center handle politically
affiliated organizations that are also
doing service work?
LO: I know exactly what you're
talking about here. You're talking
about groups that may take very
strong positions on certain issues.
We have new policy guidelines 011
the use of the Haas name. We wel
come all student groups that are
engaged in community service
and public service to use the re
sources of the Haas Center. They
can come in and use storage space,
use the photocopy machines and
the computers and so on. All are

welcome.
It used to lie that we only had af
filiated groups. Our new policy in
the fall is going to be to welcome all
groups doing service. We will not
have formally affiliated groups. We
will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro
versy — i.e. the Stanford Labor Ac -
tion Coalition. What we want to do
is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.
TD: Beyond student groups, espe
cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
tions that may have a strong ideo
logical position?
LO: Well, what does that have to do
with the Haas Center? You mean,
where we'd place students?
TD: Right.
LO: 1 don't think there's ever been
an issue — the placements are
largely student-driven anyway. No,
we don't screen. If the group is a le
gitimate nonprofit group, if they
happen to have politics that are 011
the right side or the left side, we
don't screen. We're primarily con
cerned about groups that are stu

dent groups that would in a way
present themselves as representing
I laas — that could be embarrassing
for us. We have a very clear policy
now on the use of the Haas name
that requires a very formal applica
tion process so that we can review
that event or activity. Sometimes a
group might want us to co-sponsor
a particular seminar and so on —
we have a formal prtxess for that.
It's not that we don't do that [i.e. co
sponsor events], but we have a for
mal process for it.
TD: And that's different from the
past?
LO: Yes, it's a big difference from
the past. Now as far the placements
go, like 1 said, a lot of the placements
are student-driven. Take for exam
ple, Haas Summer fellowships.
These are fellowships where stu
dents pick the location and the part
ner organization. So suppose we
have someone who wants to work
with an organization that wants to
abolish prisons. We don't say you
can't do that. We depend on the
good judgment of students that
they're not working for terrorist
groups or something like that. You
know, using a rule of reason, we de
pend on students. We don't screen
where the students ch(x>se to have
their placements, though we do ex
pect them to demonstrate that the
need they are addressing is substan
tiated, their partner agency is viable
and that it can support the student's
project. We don't have a political lit
mus test or anything like that.
TD: And do you know if in the past
that's ever been an issue between the
Haas Center and the University?
LO: Not to my knowledge. In terms
of student placement, no, I don't
think so. I think that the big issues
have been where groups have rep

resented themselves by using the
Haas name on their stationery or
using the Haas telephone number
to receive calls, and then people
think it's a 1 l;ias event or a 1 laas ac
tivity. That's really where there's
trouble. No, I don't think it involves
the placement of where the students
do their internships and so forth.
TD: How does the Haas Center
function in relation to the adminis
tration at Stanford?
LO: The Haas Center's formal re
porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service
Center] reported to the President.
That was only for President Donald
Kennedy. Then, as time went by, for
one reason or another, the Haas
(Center started to report to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs. And
that's its current formal reporting
line. And Julie Lythcott-Haims is
the direct report. In other words,
Nadinne Cruz, for example, report
ed to Julie. Now the arrangement
that I made with the Provost when 1
t(X)k this assignment was that —
since it was a short-term assign
ment — 1 felt more comfortable
simply reporting to the Provost.
And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.
TD: And so it will be that way indef
initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a
search. You may have a candidate
who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.
TD: Going back to how your prior
experiences will impact your time
as director, it sounds like you've
done service-related work all
around the world.

LO: My professional work is in en
gineering; my specialty is environ
mental policy in developing coun
tries. So that's the reason for the
world wandering.
TD: How are these experiences
going to impact your role at the
1 faas Center?
LO: Well, for example, one clear
link is that my Ph.D. students and I
have done a lot of work on evaluat
ing the implementation of govern
ment programs. For example, in
Texas, most people don't know
this, but there are about 400,0(H)
Americans in South Texas that
don't have either a water supply in
their house or waste disposal in
their house.
TD: Really?
LO: You're shocked, 1 know. The
Texas legislature in 1989 developed
a program called the Economically
Distressed Areas Program where
the state provides subsidies for
water-service providers — private
companies, municipal governments
and so on. Well, one of my Ph.D.
students did a formal evaluation of
the outcomes of that program. So I
have experience working with stu
dents on formal evaluation work. So
what 1 was telling you before about
evaluating these programs, that
thinking is definitely influenced by
my experience evaluating govern
ment programs. Another linkage:
I've had two Ph.D. students do work
on examining the influence of non
governmental organizations en
gaged in environmental policy and
organization. One student analyzed
two rural development associations
in Gujarat in India — these are
non-governmental organizations.
Arid one student is working now
studying the role of non-govern
mental organizations engaged in
wildlife conservation in China. So
we're looking at the Chinese groups
that are trying to save the giant
panda and the golden monkey.
Well, this work with NGOs relates
indirectly to some Haas Center pro
grams. The project in India involves
the influence of external funding on
the agenda of an NCO.
TD: Interesting.
LO: Very interesting. We thought
that the external flinders were
going call the shots and the NCO
would just respond. But it turns out
that it's really a symbiotic relation
ship because the funder depends on
being successful. So, in order for this
hinder to be successful, it has to ask
the NGO to do things the NCO can
do. And the NGOs get to offer feed
back. There's a loop. And so the
NGO feeds back, "Hey, you're ask
ing us to do something that we're
not going to be able to do." I think
the parts of my research that con
cern program evaluation and the
parts that concern the NGOs are
going to be useful. My teaching and
administrative experience with
Urban Studies is also useful. So
there are a lot of linkages.

thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
ing coursework to prepare stu
dents to do fellowships in Africa. So
its not just that we view service
learning as an activity that's con
fined to particular sets of courses.
We also view it in the context of our
fellowship programs, we view it in
the context of Alternative Spring
Break, we view it in the context of
the training that we provide these
student service groups that use the
resources of the Haas Center. So
we have a very broad range of pro
grams, and service-learning cours
es and research permeate the
whole process.
TD: I l)elieve it was two years ago
that the Stanford labor Action
Coalition left the Haas Center. And
I don't know if you're able to talk
about the circumstances surround
ing that.
LO: They left the Haas Center?
TD: Or they were kicked out, I'm
not exactly clear on that point ei
ther.
LO: I have to say that I'm really not
familiar with the details of what hap
pened.
TD: C )kay, then from that, how does
the Haas Center handle politically
affiliated organizations that are also
doing service work?
LO: I know exactly what you're
talking about here. You're talking
about groups that may take very
strong positions on certain issues.
We have new policy guidelines 011
the use of the Haas name. We wel
come all student groups that are
engaged in community service
and public service to use the re
sources of the Haas Center. They
can come in and use storage space,
use the photocopy machines and
the computers and so on. All are

welcome.
It used to lie that we only had af
filiated groups. Our new policy in
the fall is going to be to welcome all
groups doing service. We will not
have formally affiliated groups. We
will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro
versy — i.e. the Stanford Labor Ac -
tion Coalition. What we want to do
is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.
TD: Beyond student groups, espe
cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
tions that may have a strong ideo
logical position?
LO: Well, what does that have to do
with the Haas Center? You mean,
where we'd place students?
TD: Right.
LO: 1 don't think there's ever been
an issue — the placements are
largely student-driven anyway. No,
we don't screen. If the group is a le
gitimate nonprofit group, if they
happen to have politics that are 011
the right side or the left side, we
don't screen. We're primarily con
cerned about groups that are stu

dent groups that would in a way
present themselves as representing
I laas — that could be embarrassing
for us. We have a very clear policy
now on the use of the Haas name
that requires a very formal applica
tion process so that we can review
that event or activity. Sometimes a
group might want us to co-sponsor
a particular seminar and so on —
we have a formal prtxess for that.
It's not that we don't do that [i.e. co
sponsor events], but we have a for
mal process for it.
TD: And that's different from the
past?
LO: Yes, it's a big difference from
the past. Now as far the placements
go, like 1 said, a lot of the placements
are student-driven. Take for exam
ple, Haas Summer fellowships.
These are fellowships where stu
dents pick the location and the part
ner organization. So suppose we
have someone who wants to work
with an organization that wants to
abolish prisons. We don't say you
can't do that. We depend on the
good judgment of students that
they're not working for terrorist
groups or something like that. You
know, using a rule of reason, we de
pend on students. We don't screen
where the students ch(x>se to have
their placements, though we do ex
pect them to demonstrate that the
need they are addressing is substan
tiated, their partner agency is viable
and that it can support the student's
project. We don't have a political lit
mus test or anything like that.
TD: And do you know if in the past
that's ever been an issue between the
Haas Center and the University?
LO: Not to my knowledge. In terms
of student placement, no, I don't
think so. I think that the big issues
have been where groups have rep

resented themselves by using the
Haas name on their stationery or
using the Haas telephone number
to receive calls, and then people
think it's a 1 l;ias event or a 1 laas ac
tivity. That's really where there's
trouble. No, I don't think it involves
the placement of where the students
do their internships and so forth.
TD: How does the Haas Center
function in relation to the adminis
tration at Stanford?
LO: The Haas Center's formal re
porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service
Center] reported to the President.
That was only for President Donald
Kennedy. Then, as time went by, for
one reason or another, the Haas
(Center started to report to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs. And
that's its current formal reporting
line. And Julie Lythcott-Haims is
the direct report. In other words,
Nadinne Cruz, for example, report
ed to Julie. Now the arrangement
that I made with the Provost when 1
t(X)k this assignment was that —
since it was a short-term assign
ment — 1 felt more comfortable
simply reporting to the Provost.
And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.
TD: And so it will be that way indef
initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a
search. You may have a candidate
who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.
TD: Going back to how your prior
experiences will impact your time
as director, it sounds like you've
done service-related work all
around the world.

LO: My professional work is in en
gineering; my specialty is environ
mental policy in developing coun
tries. So that's the reason for the
world wandering.
TD: How are these experiences
going to impact your role at the
1 faas Center?
LO: Well, for example, one clear
link is that my Ph.D. students and I
have done a lot of work on evaluat
ing the implementation of govern
ment programs. For example, in
Texas, most people don't know
this, but there are about 400,0(H)
Americans in South Texas that
don't have either a water supply in
their house or waste disposal in
their house.
TD: Really?
LO: You're shocked, 1 know. The
Texas legislature in 1989 developed
a program called the Economically
Distressed Areas Program where
the state provides subsidies for
water-service providers — private
companies, municipal governments
and so on. Well, one of my Ph.D.
students did a formal evaluation of
the outcomes of that program. So I
have experience working with stu
dents on formal evaluation work. So
what 1 was telling you before about
evaluating these programs, that
thinking is definitely influenced by
my experience evaluating govern
ment programs. Another linkage:
I've had two Ph.D. students do work
on examining the influence of non
governmental organizations en
gaged in environmental policy and
organization. One student analyzed
two rural development associations
in Gujarat in India — these are
non-governmental organizations.
Arid one student is working now
studying the role of non-govern
mental organizations engaged in
wildlife conservation in China. So
we're looking at the Chinese groups
that are trying to save the giant
panda and the golden monkey.
Well, this work with NGOs relates
indirectly to some Haas Center pro
grams. The project in India involves
the influence of external funding on
the agenda of an NCO.
TD: Interesting.
LO: Very interesting. We thought
that the external flinders were
going call the shots and the NCO
would just respond. But it turns out
that it's really a symbiotic relation
ship because the funder depends on
being successful. So, in order for this
hinder to be successful, it has to ask
the NGO to do things the NCO can
do. And the NGOs get to offer feed
back. There's a loop. And so the
NGO feeds back, "Hey, you're ask
ing us to do something that we're
not going to be able to do." I think
the parts of my research that con
cern program evaluation and the
parts that concern the NGOs are
going to be useful. My teaching and
administrative experience with
Urban Studies is also useful. So
there are a lot of linkages.
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.

porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service
Center] reported to the President.
That was only for President Donald
Kennedy. Then, as time went by, for
one reason or another, the Haas
(Center started to report to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs. And
that's its current formal reporting
line. And Julie Lythcott-Haims is
the direct report. In other words,
Nadinne Cruz, for example, report
ed to Julie. Now the arrangement
that I made with the Provost when 1
t(X)k this assignment was that —
since it was a short-term assign
ment — 1 felt more comfortable
simply reporting to the Provost.
And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.
TD: And so it will be that way indef
initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a
search. You may have a candidate
who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.
TD: Going back to how your prior
experiences will impact your time
as director, it sounds like you've
done service-related work all
around the world.

LO: My professional work is in en
gineering; my specialty is environ
mental policy in developing coun
tries. So that's the reason for the
world wandering.
TD: How are these experiences
going to impact your role at the
1 faas Center?
LO: Well, for example, one clear
link is that my Ph.D. students and I
have done a lot of work on evaluat
ing the implementation of govern
ment programs. For example, in
Texas, most people don't know
this, but there are about 400,0(H)
Americans in South Texas that
don't have either a water supply in
their house or waste disposal in
their house.
TD: Really?
LO: You're shocked, 1 know. The
Texas legislature in 1989 developed
a program called the Economically
Distressed Areas Program where
the state provides subsidies for
water-service providers — private
companies, municipal governments
and so on. Well, one of my Ph.D.
students did a formal evaluation of
the outcomes of that program. So I
have experience working with stu
dents on formal evaluation work. So
what 1 was telling you before about
evaluating these programs, that
thinking is definitely influenced by
my experience evaluating govern
ment programs. Another linkage:
I've had two Ph.D. students do work
on examining the influence of non
governmental organizations en
gaged in environmental policy and
organization. One student analyzed
two rural development associations
in Gujarat in India — these are
non-governmental organizations.
Arid one student is working now
studying the role of non-govern
mental organizations engaged in
wildlife conservation in China. So
we're looking at the Chinese groups
that are trying to save the giant
panda and the golden monkey.
Well, this work with NGOs relates
indirectly to some Haas Center pro
grams. The project in India involves
the influence of external funding on
the agenda of an NCO.
TD: Interesting.
LO: Very interesting. We thought
that the external flinders were
going call the shots and the NCO
would just respond. But it turns out
that it's really a symbiotic relation
ship because the funder depends on
being successful. So, in order for this
hinder to be successful, it has to ask
the NGO to do things the NCO can
do. And the NGOs get to offer feed
back. There's a loop. And so the
NGO feeds back, "Hey, you're ask
ing us to do something that we're
not going to be able to do." I think
the parts of my research that con
cern program evaluation and the
parts that concern the NGOs are
going to be useful. My teaching and
administrative experience with
Urban Studies is also useful. So
there are a lot of linkages.
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
ing coursework to prepare stu
dents to do fellowships in Africa. So
its not just that we view service
learning as an activity that's con
fined to particular sets of courses.
We also view it in the context of our
fellowship programs, we view it in
the context of Alternative Spring
Break, we view it in the context of
the training that we provide these
student service groups that use the
resources of the Haas Center. So
we have a very broad range of pro
grams, and service-learning cours
es and research permeate the
whole process.
TD: I l)elieve it was two years ago
that the Stanford labor Action
Coalition left the Haas Center. And
I don't know if you're able to talk
about the circumstances surround
ing that.
LO: They left the Haas Center?
TD: Or they were kicked out, I'm
not exactly clear on that point ei
ther.
LO: I have to say that I'm really not
familiar with the details of what hap
pened.
TD: C )kay, then from that, how does
the Haas Center handle politically
affiliated organizations that are also
doing service work?
LO: I know exactly what you're
talking about here. You're talking
about groups that may take very
strong positions on certain issues.
We have new policy guidelines 011
the use of the Haas name. We wel
come all student groups that are
engaged in community service
and public service to use the re
sources of the Haas Center. They
can come in and use storage space,
use the photocopy machines and
the computers and so on. All are

welcome.
It used to lie that we only had af
filiated groups. Our new policy in
the fall is going to be to welcome all
groups doing service. We will not
have formally affiliated groups. We
will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro
versy — i.e. the Stanford Labor Ac -
tion Coalition. What we want to do
is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.
TD: Beyond student groups, espe
cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
tions that may have a strong ideo
logical position?
LO: Well, what does that have to do
with the Haas Center? You mean,
where we'd place students?
TD: Right.
LO: 1 don't think there's ever been
an issue — the placements are
largely student-driven anyway. No,
we don't screen. If the group is a le
gitimate nonprofit group, if they
happen to have politics that are 011
the right side or the left side, we
don't screen. We're primarily con
cerned about groups that are stu

dent groups that would in a way
present themselves as representing
I laas — that could be embarrassing
for us. We have a very clear policy
now on the use of the Haas name
that requires a very formal applica
tion process so that we can review
that event or activity. Sometimes a
group might want us to co-sponsor
a particular seminar and so on —
we have a formal prtxess for that.
It's not that we don't do that [i.e. co
sponsor events], but we have a for
mal process for it.
TD: And that's different from the
past?
LO: Yes, it's a big difference from
the past. Now as far the placements
go, like 1 said, a lot of the placements
are student-driven. Take for exam
ple, Haas Summer fellowships.
These are fellowships where stu
dents pick the location and the part
ner organization. So suppose we
have someone who wants to work
with an organization that wants to
abolish prisons. We don't say you
can't do that. We depend on the
good judgment of students that
they're not working for terrorist
groups or something like that. You
know, using a rule of reason, we de
pend on students. We don't screen
where the students ch(x>se to have
their placements, though we do ex
pect them to demonstrate that the
need they are addressing is substan
tiated, their partner agency is viable
and that it can support the student's
project. We don't have a political lit
mus test or anything like that.
TD: And do you know if in the past
that's ever been an issue between the
Haas Center and the University?
LO: Not to my knowledge. In terms
of student placement, no, I don't
think so. I think that the big issues
have been where groups have rep

resented themselves by using the
Haas name on their stationery or
using the Haas telephone number
to receive calls, and then people
think it's a 1 l;ias event or a 1 laas ac
tivity. That's really where there's
trouble. No, I don't think it involves
the placement of where the students
do their internships and so forth.
TD: How does the Haas Center
function in relation to the adminis
tration at Stanford?
LO: The Haas Center's formal re
porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service

That was only for President Donald

And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.

initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a

who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.

long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
ing coursework to prepare stu
dents to do fellowships in Africa. So
its not just that we view service
learning as an activity that's con
fined to particular sets of courses.
We also view it in the context of our
fellowship programs, we view it in
the context of Alternative Spring
Break, we view it in the context of
the training that we provide these
student service groups that use the
resources of the Haas Center. So
we have a very broad range of pro
grams, and service-learning cours
es and research permeate the
whole process.
TD: I l)elieve it was two years ago
that the Stanford labor Action
Coalition left the Haas Center. And
I don't know if you're able to talk
about the circumstances surround
ing that.
LO: They left the Haas Center?
TD: Or they were kicked out, I'm
not exactly clear on that point ei
ther.
LO: I have to say that I'm really not
familiar with the details of what hap
pened.
TD: C )kay, then from that, how does
the Haas Center handle politically
affiliated organizations that are also
doing service work?
LO: I know exactly what you're
talking about here. You're talking
about groups that may take very
strong positions on certain issues.
We have new policy guidelines 011
the use of the Haas name. We wel
come all student groups that are
engaged in community service
and public service to use the re
sources of the Haas Center. They
can come in and use storage space,
use the photocopy machines and
the computers and so on. All are

welcome.
It used to lie that we only had af
filiated groups. Our new policy in
the fall is going to be to welcome all
groups doing service. We will not
have formally affiliated groups. We
will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro
versy — i.e. the Stanford Labor Ac -
tion Coalition. What we want to do
is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.
TD: Beyond student groups, espe
cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
tions that may have a strong ideo
logical position?
LO: Well, what does that have to do
with the Haas Center? You mean,
where we'd place students?
TD: Right.
LO: 1 don't think there's ever been
an issue — the placements are
largely student-driven anyway. No,
we don't screen. If the group is a le
gitimate nonprofit group, if they
happen to have politics that are 011
the right side or the left side, we
don't screen. We're primarily con
cerned about groups that are stu

dent groups that would in a way
present themselves as representing
I laas — that could be embarrassing
for us. We have a very clear policy
now on the use of the Haas name
that requires a very formal applica
tion process so that we can review
that event or activity. Sometimes a
group might want us to co-sponsor
a particular seminar and so on —
we have a formal prtxess for that.
It's not that we don't do that [i.e. co
sponsor events], but we have a for
mal process for it.
TD: And that's different from the
past?
LO: Yes, it's a big difference from
the past. Now as far the placements
go, like 1 said, a lot of the placements
are student-driven. Take for exam
ple, Haas Summer fellowships.
These are fellowships where stu
dents pick the location and the part
ner organization. So suppose we
have someone who wants to work
with an organization that wants to
abolish prisons. We don't say you
can't do that. We depend on the
good judgment of students that
they're not working for terrorist
groups or something like that. You
know, using a rule of reason, we de
pend on students. We don't screen
where the students ch(x>se to have
their placements, though we do ex
pect them to demonstrate that the
need they are addressing is substan
tiated, their partner agency is viable
and that it can support the student's
project. We don't have a political lit
mus test or anything like that.
TD: And do you know if in the past
that's ever been an issue between the
Haas Center and the University?
LO: Not to my knowledge. In terms
of student placement, no, I don't
think so. I think that the big issues
have been where groups have rep

resented themselves by using the
Haas name on their stationery or
using the Haas telephone number
to receive calls, and then people
think it's a 1 l;ias event or a 1 laas ac
tivity. That's really where there's
trouble. No, I don't think it involves
the placement of where the students
do their internships and so forth.
TD: How does the Haas Center
function in relation to the adminis
tration at Stanford?
LO: The Haas Center's formal re
porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service
Center] reported to the President.
That was only for President Donald
Kennedy. Then, as time went by, for
one reason or another, the Haas
(Center started to report to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs. And
that's its current formal reporting
line. And Julie Lythcott-Haims is
the direct report. In other words,
Nadinne Cruz, for example, report
ed to Julie. Now the arrangement
that I made with the Provost when 1
t(X)k this assignment was that —
since it was a short-term assign
ment — 1 felt more comfortable
simply reporting to the Provost.
And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.
TD: And so it will be that way indef
initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a
search. You may have a candidate
who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.
TD: Going back to how your prior
experiences will impact your time
as director, it sounds like you've
done service-related work all
around the world.

LO: My professional work is in en
gineering; my specialty is environ
mental policy in developing coun
tries. So that's the reason for the
world wandering.
TD: How are these experiences
going to impact your role at the
1 faas Center?
LO: Well, for example, one clear
link is that my Ph.D. students and I
have done a lot of work on evaluat
ing the implementation of govern
ment programs. For example, in
Texas, most people don't know
this, but there are about 400,0(H)
Americans in South Texas that
don't have either a water supply in
their house or waste disposal in
their house.
TD: Really?
LO: You're shocked, 1 know. The
Texas legislature in 1989 developed
a program called the Economically
Distressed Areas Program where
the state provides subsidies for
water-service providers — private
companies, municipal governments
and so on. Well, one of my Ph.D.
students did a formal evaluation of
the outcomes of that program. So I
have experience working with stu
dents on formal evaluation work. So
what 1 was telling you before about
evaluating these programs, that
thinking is definitely influenced by
my experience evaluating govern
ment programs. Another linkage:
I've had two Ph.D. students do work
on examining the influence of non
governmental organizations en
gaged in environmental policy and
organization. One student analyzed
two rural development associations
in Gujarat in India — these are
non-governmental organizations.
Arid one student is working now
studying the role of non-govern
mental organizations engaged in
wildlife conservation in China. So
we're looking at the Chinese groups
that are trying to save the giant
panda and the golden monkey.
Well, this work with NGOs relates
indirectly to some Haas Center pro
grams. The project in India involves
the influence of external funding on
the agenda of an NCO.
TD: Interesting.
LO: Very interesting. We thought
that the external flinders were
going call the shots and the NCO
would just respond. But it turns out
that it's really a symbiotic relation
ship because the funder depends on
being successful. So, in order for this
hinder to be successful, it has to ask
the NGO to do things the NCO can
do. And the NGOs get to offer feed
back. There's a loop. And so the
NGO feeds back, "Hey, you're ask
ing us to do something that we're
not going to be able to do." I think
the parts of my research that con
cern program evaluation and the
parts that concern the NGOs are
going to be useful. My teaching and
administrative experience with
Urban Studies is also useful. So
there are a lot of linkages.
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center

know that we have almost 100 fellowships to

will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro
versy — i.e. the Stanford Labor Ac -
tion Coalition. What we want to do
is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.
TD: Beyond student groups, espe
cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
tions that may have a strong ideo
logical position?
LO: Well, what does that have to do
with the Haas Center? You mean,
where we'd place students?
TD: Right.
LO: 1 don't think there's ever been
an issue — the placements are
largely student-driven anyway. No,
we don't screen. If the group is a le
gitimate nonprofit group, if they
happen to have politics that are 011
the right side or the left side, we
don't screen. We're primarily con
cerned about groups that are stu

dent groups that would in a way
present themselves as representing
I laas — that could be embarrassing
for us. We have a very clear policy
now on the use of the Haas name
that requires a very formal applica
tion process so that we can review
that event or activity. Sometimes a
group might want us to co-sponsor
a particular seminar and so on —
we have a formal prtxess for that.
It's not that we don't do that [i.e. co
sponsor events], but we have a for
mal process for it.
TD: And that's different from the
past?
LO: Yes, it's a big difference from
the past. Now as far the placements
go, like 1 said, a lot of the placements
are student-driven. Take for exam
ple, Haas Summer fellowships.
These are fellowships where stu
dents pick the location and the part
ner organization. So suppose we
have someone who wants to work
with an organization that wants to
abolish prisons. We don't say you
can't do that. We depend on the
good judgment of students that
they're not working for terrorist
groups or something like that. You
know, using a rule of reason, we de
pend on students. We don't screen
where the students ch(x>se to have
their placements, though we do ex
pect them to demonstrate that the
need they are addressing is substan
tiated, their partner agency is viable
and that it can support the student's
project. We don't have a political lit
mus test or anything like that.
TD: And do you know if in the past
that's ever been an issue between the
Haas Center and the University?
LO: Not to my knowledge. In terms
of student placement, no, I don't
think so. I think that the big issues
have been where groups have rep

resented themselves by using the
Haas name on their stationery or
using the Haas telephone number
to receive calls, and then people
think it's a 1 l;ias event or a 1 laas ac
tivity. That's really where there's
trouble. No, I don't think it involves
the placement of where the students
do their internships and so forth.
TD: How does the Haas Center
function in relation to the adminis
tration at Stanford?
LO: The Haas Center's formal re
porting line has a little bit of history.
Originally, the Haas Center [then
known simply as the Public Service
Center] reported to the President.
That was only for President Donald
Kennedy. Then, as time went by, for
one reason or another, the Haas
(Center started to report to the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs. And
that's its current formal reporting
line. And Julie Lythcott-Haims is
the direct report. In other words,
Nadinne Cruz, for example, report
ed to Julie. Now the arrangement
that I made with the Provost when 1
t(X)k this assignment was that —
since it was a short-term assign
ment — 1 felt more comfortable
simply reporting to the Provost.
And the Provost agreed. And so
that's the situation right now.
TD: And so it will be that way indef
initely?
LO: Well, who knows? We'll have a
search. You may have a candidate
who is very attractive, and in the
course of negotiating whether they
would come or not, they might be
concerned about the reporting line.
TD: Going back to how your prior
experiences will impact your time
as director, it sounds like you've
done service-related work all
around the world.

LO: My professional work is in en
gineering; my specialty is environ
mental policy in developing coun
tries. So that's the reason for the
world wandering.
TD: How are these experiences
going to impact your role at the
1 faas Center?
LO: Well, for example, one clear
link is that my Ph.D. students and I
have done a lot of work on evaluat
ing the implementation of govern
ment programs. For example, in
Texas, most people don't know
this, but there are about 400,0(H)
Americans in South Texas that
don't have either a water supply in
their house or waste disposal in
their house.
TD: Really?
LO: You're shocked, 1 know. The
Texas legislature in 1989 developed
a program called the Economically
Distressed Areas Program where
the state provides subsidies for
water-service providers — private
companies, municipal governments
and so on. Well, one of my Ph.D.
students did a formal evaluation of
the outcomes of that program. So I
have experience working with stu
dents on formal evaluation work. So
what 1 was telling you before about
evaluating these programs, that
thinking is definitely influenced by
my experience evaluating govern
ment programs. Another linkage:
I've had two Ph.D. students do work
on examining the influence of non
governmental organizations en
gaged in environmental policy and
organization. One student analyzed
two rural development associations
in Gujarat in India — these are
non-governmental organizations.
Arid one student is working now
studying the role of non-govern
mental organizations engaged in
wildlife conservation in China. So
we're looking at the Chinese groups
that are trying to save the giant
panda and the golden monkey.
Well, this work with NGOs relates
indirectly to some Haas Center pro
grams. The project in India involves
the influence of external funding on
the agenda of an NCO.
TD: Interesting.
LO: Very interesting. We thought
that the external flinders were
going call the shots and the NCO
would just respond. But it turns out
that it's really a symbiotic relation
ship because the funder depends on
being successful. So, in order for this
hinder to be successful, it has to ask
the NGO to do things the NCO can
do. And the NGOs get to offer feed
back. There's a loop. And so the
NGO feeds back, "Hey, you're ask
ing us to do something that we're
not going to be able to do." I think
the parts of my research that con
cern program evaluation and the
parts that concern the NGOs are
going to be useful. My teaching and
administrative experience with
Urban Studies is also useful. So
there are a lot of linkages.
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
ing coursework to prepare stu
dents to do fellowships in Africa. So
its not just that we view service
learning as an activity that's con
fined to particular sets of courses.
We also view it in the context of our
fellowship programs, we view it in
the context of Alternative Spring
Break, we view it in the context of
the training that we provide these
student service groups that use the
resources of the Haas Center. So
we have a very broad range of pro
grams, and service-learning cours
es and research permeate the
whole process.
TD: I l)elieve it was two years ago
that the Stanford labor Action
Coalition left the Haas Center. And
I don't know if you're able to talk
about the circumstances surround
ing that.
LO: They left the Haas Center?
TD: Or they were kicked out, I'm
not exactly clear on that point ei
ther.
LO: I have to say that I'm really not
familiar with the details of what hap
pened.
TD: C )kay, then from that, how does
the Haas Center handle politically
affiliated organizations that are also
doing service work?
LO: I know exactly what you're
talking about here. You're talking
about groups that may take very
strong positions on certain issues.
We have new policy guidelines 011
the use of the Haas name. We wel
come all student groups that are
engaged in community service
and public service to use the re
sources of the Haas Center. They
can come in and use storage space,
use the photocopy machines and
the computers and so on. All are

welcome.
It used to lie that we only had af
filiated groups. Our new policy in
the fall is going to be to welcome all
groups doing service. We will not
have formally affiliated groups. We
will welcome all groups. At the same
time, we have formal guidelines that
we're going to issue about the use of
the Haas name, because this is
where it can be embarrassing for the
Haas Center and embarrassing for
the University, and it weakens our
situation. It could be significant in
terms of the damage it does to the
Haas Center fora student group in
advocating a particular position to
claim in any way, shape or form that
this is a position of the Haas Center.
And these guidelines, in part, have
come out of this particular contro

is to l)e welcoming and we don't
want to stifle student groups that are
advocating for different positions.
At the same time, we don't want the
Haas name to be affiliated with
those advocacy positions, because
those are not our positions.

cially ones working 011 campus,
what about community organiza
