# After the unexpected departure of former Director Nadinne Cruz, the search continues for a permanent replacement
## Ortolano discusses his approach to Haas leadership 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Daily comlucted a one-on-one interview with
Inward Ortolano, interim director of the Haas
Center for Public Setvice. Ortolano, appointed by
Provost John Etchemendy to the temporaiy post, dis
cussed his prior experiences with the Center, as well
as hcrw he intends to run it until a permanent re
placement is found.
The Daily: 1 read the press release about you
being the interim director, and in it you said,
"The first three directors of the Haas
Center — Catherine Milton, Tim Stanton
and Nadinne Cruz — have helped create an
institution that stands as a model for many
other universities interested in combining
public service and education." You said," lam
both pleased and honored to have the oppor
tunity to further their work." .As an introduc
tion, could you expand on this statement?
How did you become involved with the Haas
Center, and what do you plan on doing din -
ing your time as director?
Leonard Ortolano: You know, my formal en
gagement with the Haas Center began in
1989 when I was invited to be a member of the
faculty steering committee. The faculty steer
ing committee essentially provides policy ad
vice to the Haas Center staff and helps as ques
tions come up. So I've been engaged in that
way. I've also been engaged in the context of
the Program on Urban Studies, because 1 was
the director of Urban Studies for 23 years. We
set up in the early 1990s a track within the
major called "Community Organization,"
which is essentially a track that's designed for
students interested in the nonprofit sector. So
that was another involvement. The third kind
of formal involvement with the Haas Center
was setting up — with Nadinne Cruz — the
Urban Summer Fellowships .... This was
four years ago. We have funding for seven or
eight of these Urban Summer Fellowships
each year.
TD: Vou and Nadinne Cruz had worked to
gether prior to her becoming the director of
the Haas Center?
LO: Oh, absolutely. She was ass<xiate director
when Tim Stanton was the director. Nadinne
had, I think, a full nine years at the Haas Cen
ter. So it was in that context, when I was work
ing with Tim to try to set up this program of
community organization, that Nadinne actu
ally started teaching courses in that program.
She was a lecturer in urban studies. She would
teach a course like "Community Organizing,"
for example. And then Nadinne also worked
to create the Public Service Scholars Program.
We had a three-quarter sequence for students
who were combining public service with aca
demic research. That was another kind of
connection with Nadinne. It was largely in the
context of work coming from my position as
the director of Urban Studies that I began
linking with the Haas Center. Regarding the
"Community Organization" track, I remem
ber saying to Tim Stanton that we wouldn't
have done it unless we could count on the
Haas (Center for support in terms of advice
and mentoring for our majors.
TD: What have students done with that pro
gram?

LO: Some of them have stalled nonprofits
and some of them have worked for nonprofit
organizations. This year, for example, two ot
the students who graduated won the Tom
Ford Fellowship that involves a year working
at a foundation. That's a Haas Center pro
gram. Many of them, surprisingly, have gone
on to do work on low-income housing — and
that involved going to business school. We
never thought that students interested in
working with community organizations
would wind up going to business schtx)l, but
they have. They decided to learn about how
you finance housing and how you work with
big developers to get big money so you can
promote community economic development.
So even these complete idealists who you
would never imagine, you know, being in
voked in major financial deals — they're get
ting the skill sets that they need. It's a very in
teresting turn of events.
TD: When Nadinne became the director, you
continued to work with the Haas Center?
LO: Oh yes, we still had a collaboration. It was
a seamless transition from Tim to Nadinne,
because I already had a working relationship
with Nadinne.
TD: So would you say that your own work has
become more and more intertwined with the
Haas Center?
LO: Yes, 1 would say that its the Urban Stud
ies program has evolved — it became more
and more closely tied with the Haas Center.
We depended on the Haas Center and vari
ous structures that it provides.
TD: Could you talk about what your new po
sition means to you, and what your goals are
for the program?
LO: Well, first of all, let me explain a lew
things about the search process. The Univer
sity has hired a search firm, Isaacson, Miller,
to search widely. And when the provost asked
me if I would be willing to do this. 1 said,
"Well, what's the timing?" And he said, "Well,
you know, we're doing the search. And it
could be that we'll have a permanent director
for January 1, and it could be that we won't."
In other words, it may not be until next Sep
tember.
What I indicated to the provost was that
were I to accept this position, I would take the
job as if I was going to be in the position fora
long time. That I wasn't going to be a caretak
er, that I wasn't just going to hold the shop to
gether until a new director came along, be
cause I have my own ideas. So he said,
"Fine" — he welcomed that. So I've just taken
the role as if I'm going to be there a long time,
not knowing how long I'll be there [laughs].
But in my own mind, I'm the director, so what
kinds of things do I have to worry about?
There are several things that we're working
on. One — and most importantly — is to ar
ticulate the programs at the Haas Center
more clearly. I want every Stanford student to
know that we have almost 100 fellowships to
offer. And I'm not so sure that students are
aware of that. For example, do you know that
the Haas Center has almost 100 fellowships to
offer?
TD: I didn't know that. Could you further

explain the different activities of the Haas
Center?
LO: The I laas Center is kind of a complicat
ed place. There are about 20 different pro
grams, and what I've been trying to do is work
with the staff to break it down into five cate
gories. We've got fellowships; we vegot ionis
es, the service-learning courses; we've got re
search like the Public Service Scholars pro
gram, where students combine research and
community service; and we've got communi
ty programs, which include three programs
in K-12 education — we've got a literacy pro
gram, we've got a middle-school program,
we've got a high-school program and we also
have community-service work-study oppor
tunities. So those are all community-based
programs.
TD: These are happening throughout the
year?
LO: Throughout the year. Now we've also got
a fifth category — the leadership programs,
where you've got special courses and services
for training leaders in the future for public
service. Now, I want to make sure that the
five-part storyline conies through very clear
ly. So students, when they think about the
I laas Center, they think of five different com
ponents.
TD: And the Haas Center is working with the
Urban Studies program?
LO: We work with lots of different depart
ments. We support students from all over, in
cluding grad students from the professional
schools. We provide resources and training
and facilitate their public service. We have an
initiative that we're building with the School
of Education so that the work that we do in K
-12 will be enhanced by students and faculty in
the School of Education, which is a big goal loi
ns. Another thing that we've been doing is to
try to be a little more systematic about how we
evaluate the influence of our programs. Since
we have about 20 programs in these five dif
ferent categories, you can raise the question:
well, what are your goals in a given program?
Second, how would you know if you met
them? In other words, do you have some kind
of measure that you could use to say, "Well, if
1 hit this target then I know I'm there." Third,
okay, if you actually measured them, what did
you learn from the measurement process?
How did the measurement process inform
the way the program is designed? How can
the program be improved as a result of that?
So these are the kinds of initiatives that we've
been taking over the summer just to mobilize.
TD: I would imagine that's pretty difficult.
From my experience in the realm of public
service, you know, most of the time with the
work that you do it's hard to tell what the re
sults are.
LO: Oh, exactly, that's what makes it such a
big challenge. Exactly. And I didn't want to
devote a lot staff time to this because it is so
complicated, but I just wanted to get people
thinking a little bit more formally about what
the issues are in the evaluation of a program.
And what we're going to do is we're going to
take a few programs — you know, the ones
where we have a lot of resources going to the

programs, so that there's a lot of money tied
up and a lot of staff'time — where we think
that there is some promise in doing a more
fornuil evaluation and tracking of results, and
we'll do more formal studies. But right now,
we're in the stage where we're kind of infor
mally evaluating all our programs without
putting a lot of staff time into it just to get the
big picture.
TD: Back to the search fora new director —
the process is pretty indefinite at this point
and could go on fora while?
LO: Well, first of all, as with any search, you
never know how it's going to go. You may do
a round of interviews and say, "Well, we real
ly haven't seen what we're looking for, and we
should just search harder and get more can
didates." That's one level of a search. But the
second level of a search is, suppose you find
the right person. Well, you don't know how
long it's going to take that person to disengage
from their current job. So it could be that you
find the right person in November and that
person says, "Well. I've got commitments
here at School X and I can't leave until next
summer." So we don't know. We're optimistic
that, at the latest, by next September we'll
have a new director.
TD: Nadinne Cruz was, of course, very well
respected by everyone, so the standard is
high. In Provost Etchemendy's press release
about Cruz's departure, it mentioned the
number-one ranking by U.S. News & World
Report.
LO: We don't take the national ranking in
U.S. News & World Report too seriously.
It's a nic e compliment, but you know, there
are a lot of rankings out there, and we tied
for first place in terms of service-learning at
universities. But, I think, based on the
number of other schools that come and visit
the Haas Center and talk to staff, and so
on — for example, even in the short time
that I've been there, I've had people come
from other schools wanting to learn about
the Haas Center — you know that the Cen
ter is on the map and it's very highly re
spected.
TD: What do you think it is that really stands
out about the Haas Center?
LO: Well, one of the things that distinguishes
the Center is that, first of all, we're not just a
volunteer center. A lot of schools have volun
teer centers or volunteer programs where
they'll match up students with the communi
ty. At the same time, we're not just running
courses that involve service-learning. Service
learning is jargon for combining a course with
a placement or an internship in the commu
nity. In a way we do both, and in a way we do
a lot more. For example, if you take our fel
lowship programs — we have a new set ol fel
lowships in /Vfrica for students who want to do
summer work in Africa.
TD: Is this to replace the Amy Biehl fellow
ships?
LO: The fellowships in Africa are all part ol
that. It's part of that package — it's coming
out of that tradition. Well, the Africanist fac
ulty on campus are very interested in build-
