Ten years before there was a Palo Alto,
when the population was one dozen people,
the giant red barn was, what we would call today,
a "genetic engineering think tank" and "futuristic
communications research institute."
Two decades before the establishment of
the great university Governor Stanford's Palo Alto
Stock Farm bred nine world champion race horses,
including the great "Electioneer".
And, at the same time Mr. Eadwarde
Muybridge was inventing the motion picture
industry on one of the tracks.
Every year the beautifully restored Victorian
barn takes center stage fora show-case of equestrian
skills, and old fashion family fun on the farm.
High Flying Jumpers, Trick Riders,
Dressage, Sidesaddle Riders and Miniature
Carriages pulled by mini ponies fill the arena.
A barbecue, petting zoo and community
equestrian exhibits provide plenty to do between
the exhibitions.
