## U.S. needs U.N. assistance to give peace in Iraq a chance 
### MARK DOMINIK GUEST COLUMNIST 
Tuesday's catastrophic suicide
bombing of U.N. Headquarters in
Iraq is a ghastly illustration that
the U.S. military is not in control of the
country. Claiming the lives of at least 17
civilians, including Chief U.N. Envoy
Sergio Vieira de Mello, this attack sets
back the effort to promote peace in the
desert nation.
However tragic the events, Tuesday's
blast was only the latest in a long and
bloody string of attacks that have ham
pered American efforts to rebuild Iraq. It
serves as the bloodiest — and most
shocking— illustration of how the Unit
ed States underestimated post-war resis
tance in Iraq.
Since U.S. President George W. Bush
declared that major military operations
in Iraq were over on May 1, there have
been 312 confirmed deaths of coalition
soldiers.
In the post-war backlash against U.S.
occupation, Islamic militants of every va
riety have poured into Iraq from neigh
boring Iran and Saudi Arabia. These en

emies — who have now made common
cause with Saddam Hussein's old allies to
destabilize occupied Iraq — are decen
tralized guerrilla partisans, and are thus
much harder to light using the high-tech
weapons and communication devices on
which the U.S. military depends so much.
The enemy we are fighting has
changed; we are no longer engaged in
open combat on traditional battlefields.
The problem is that our tactics have not.
By not committing a sufficient number
of troops to Iraq, the United States sacri
ficed security — and the ability to effec
tively deal with post-war resistance — to
cost-effectiveness.
Every day it becomes clearer that the
Bush administration underestimated the
manpower necessary to ensure safety in
post-war Iraq. By dispatching just over
160,000 soldiers to control a country with
a population of 23.8 million and a land
mass the size of France, the United States
and its allies set the stage for victory in
open battle, and defeat in guerrilla war,
Vietnam-style.
Earlier this month, the international
community offered to help the United
States rebuild Iraq. France, Germany,

Russia and India all expressed willing
ness to commit troops to Iraq, with the
proviso that the operation be led by the
United Nations.
But the Bush administration, worried
that the international community might
get in the way of its agenda, has once
again turned a deaf ear to the rest of the
world. Instead of seeking a U.N. resolu
tion that would have paved the way for
intervention resulting in strengthened
manpower in Iraq, Bush chose instead to
forge ahead with a cobbled-together al
liance of small countries and states de
pendent on U.S. foreign aid.
Four days before the attack on U.N.
Headquarters, a Bush administration of
ficial. speaking on conditions of anonymi
ty, told the International Herald Tribune
that the United States did not need U.N.
help in post-war Iraq.
"The administration is not willing to
confront going to the Security Council
and saying, 'We really need to make Iraq
an international operation,'" he said.
"You can make a case that it would be bet
ter to do that, but, right now, the situation
in Iraq is not that dire."
If the Aug. 7 bombing of the Jordanian

Embassy in Baghdad were not illustra
tion enough that the situation in Iraq is
indeed dire, then the attack on U.N.
Headquarters should be. The U.S. mili
tary is not in control of the country, and
the Bush administration needs to seek
help from the international community
— and last.
A stronger occupation force will do
much to end the immediate crisis in Iraq.
But it will not end all of the problems fac
ing the country.
The New York Times suggested yes
terday that the attack on the U.N. Head
quarters in Iraq indicates that terrorists
in the country are pursuing a new strate
gy. This latest offensive aims to turn the
majority of Iraqi civilians against the U.S.
occupying force by demonstrating that
the United States cannot maintain public
safety.
The Iraqi people — whose trust in the
U.S. occupation forces erodes daily —
will lose what confidence they have left in
their U.S. guardians unless water, power
and other basic: services are restored
quickly. And to prove to the Iraqi people
