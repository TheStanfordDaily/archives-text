Professor criticizes behavior,
comments of student activist
I am sorely disappointed that the Daily
would print an assertion without the usual
fact-check regarding something 1 suppos
edly said. I am referring to Andy Clavin's
Aug. 7 column, in which he reported that 1
told him to "shut up," and cited that as ev
idence of the "Left's stilling of political dis
sent." While it is true that 1 asked him to
"please shut up," I am afraid the issue at
hand has nothing whatsoever to do with
politics and everything to do with rude
ness. Let me hasten to add that 1 immedi
ately recognized my own, and e-mailed
Ancly an apology. But my remark was
made in response to actions on his part that
went way beyond not only the University's
Fundamental Standard hut also the law.
This spring I was asked to take part in
an ongoing graduate student pedagogy
workshop. The subject of that evening's
workshop was how to address issues of the
war in the classroom. How did current
events find their way into teaching? What
kinds of new dynamics take place? What
were the best ways to make sure that a di
verse set of opinions could be voiced from
all sides of the issue?
Even before event began, we were told
that a student had demanded that he be
given the first question, and that he had
warned organizers that he would take an
antagonistic position. But when the ques
tion and answer period came, the student,
Andy Clavin, never asked a question at all.
Instead, he proceeded to tell us at length

that he disagreed with us. We asked him to
be more specific about this disagreement
so we could respond. We asked him to pose
the question he had demanded that lie he
allowed to ask. But Clavin refused the or
ganizers' persistent requests to ask his
question and then let others speak, and in
stead, after many minutes of repeating that
he disagreed with us (without saying how
or why), insisted that Professor Beinin de
bate him (on a topic as yet unspecified).
Beinin said he did not debate students, that
he did not get into adversarial situations
with students.
I asked Clavin to please take this up with
Professor Beinin outside the workshop,
since his concerns had nothing to do with
the workshop, and that we were at this
point running out of time. He refused, say
ing that he would continue to speak as long
as lie wished. Clavin said that unless Beinin
agreed to a debate (on a still unspecified
topic), then the moral position of Beinin,
everyone on the panel, everyone in
Beinin's department and everyone in the
building, was questionable. We still asked
him to ask a question pertaining to the
workshop. His point had nothing to do
with workshop; it became clear that he had
planned all along to use this occasion to
bait Beinin. I was at the point of calling se
curity. It was then that I, at a moment of
high frustration, made the remarks attrib
uted to me. He then left the room, throw
ing his business card at the panel.
Later, to my amazement, I was told that
Clavin and a group of his friends had actu
ally arrived much earlier, set up a hidden
video camera and taped the entire pro
ceeding. It now became clear that Clavin
had planned all along to create a provoca

tion, had without our knowledge or per
mission taped the workshop and had vio
lated the right of everyone else in the room
to speak. This is emphatically not a case of
either the "Left" or the "Right" silencing
political points of view (ironically, the
workshop was, as 1 said, designed to insure
that all points of view could be presented in
a classroom), but of one individual's abuse
of a public forum.

Guest columnist apologizes for misrepre

I would like to publicly apologize to Pro
fessors David Palumbo-Liu, Joel Beinin
and the other panelists and participants in
last Spring's teach-in that 1 attended. My
behavior was quite inappropriate.
Over the last couple of weeks I have re

that I had gone too far in my political ac-
