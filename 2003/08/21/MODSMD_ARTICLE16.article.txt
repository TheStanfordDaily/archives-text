# "Better Luck" director sets sights on tomorrow
## 
### ERICA O'YOUNG EDITORIAL STAFF 
"The whole journey is about battling,"
reflects Justin Lin, acclaimed director of
the groundbreaking, controversy-stimulat
ing MTV film "Better Luck Tomorrow."
"It's like you wake up in the morning and
you feel like you have to light ten battles."
The blows and battles along the road are
something Lin has become accustomed to
since "Better Luck Tomorrow" — a stir
ring, disturbingly true-to-life tale of
teenage Asian-American suburbia — first
screened at last January's Sundance Film
Festival. Polarized by Lin's unapologetic,
counter-stereotype portrayal of the hid
den, sex-drugs-and-violence lives of four
young Southern California Asian-Ameri
can high school superstars, the audience

erupted into a shouting match when Lin
and his cast took the stage for questions.
The tumult brought to Lin's defense such
renowned film critics as Elvis Mitchell and
Roger Ebert, who stood, red-faced and fin
ger-shaking, before the squabbling audi
ence.
"What 1 find offensive and condescend
ing," Ebert fumed, "is nobody would say
[what you are saying] to a bunch of white
filmmakers. . . This film has the right to be
about these people, and Asian American
characters have the right to be whoever
they want to be."
It was enough to put Lin's name on the
fast track to Hollywood. After negotiations
with several film companies, "Better Luck
Tomorrow" became MTV Films' first out
side film acquisition. The film's record
breaking turnout in April for initial screen

ings in Los Angeles, New York, San Fran
cisco and Chicago spotlighted Better Luck
Tomorrow as a film of pioneering cultural
significance in the field of American cine
matography.
Lin's only complaint is that his cell
phone has since been ringing nonstop.
For Lin, it is the culmination of years of
pursuing a dream that, surprisingly, did
not begin to take form until his junior un
dergraduate year at UCLA. Born in Tai
wan, Lin moved to Orange County, Cali
fornia at age eight. An avid basketball play
er, the young Lin was determined to play in
the NBA. "I was pretty good, but, obvious
ly, I stopped growing," he says now, laugh
ing.
In his junior year at UCLA, however,
Lin watched two films that changed his
life's ambitions. The artistry behind Francis
Ford Coppola's Tucker and Spike Lee's Do
the Right Thing captured the young stu
dent's imagination and curiosity. Tenta
tively, he applied for UCLA's School of
Film and Television. After shooting his first
short — a 10-minute story called Soybean
Milk about a Chinese immigrant struggling
to reorient himself in Chinatown — Lin
knew he had found his passion. Although
he had had to take on three jobs to pay for
tuition, rent and the $4,000 budget for the
film, he was hooked.
"The challenge got me addicted," I.in
explains, frankly. "It was like basketball,
but to the next level. You're like the point
guard, dealing with all these egos. You
have to make sure everyone is running the
play and everything's in line so you can
achieve the vision... That's what excites
me."
In 1998, Lin went on to direct his first
feature length film with fellow UCLA film
student Quentin Lee. Released by Margin
Films, Lee's independent distribution com
pany, Shopping For Fangs was a surreal,
uneasy psycho-thriller about a pair of sexu
ally repressed loners who believe their per-

sonal quirks have supernatural
origins. Also featuring an all
Asian-American cast, Fangs
sought to explore the issue of
identity in sexual and cultural
alienation. Though screened in
ternationally in numerous festi
vals. however, Fangs eventually
slipped through the media rela
tively unnoticed.
A subsequent look at his bank
account told Lin that his sopho
more film debut could very well
be his last. Attempts at shopping
the "Better Luck Tomorrow"
script around to large film com
panies resulted in several oilers
for funding, but on one condi
tion — Lin must change the eth
nicities of his Asian-American
characters.
"The situation . . . really made
me question the reasons why 1
wanted to make the film," Lin re
flects, "exactly what kind of film I
wanted to make il it were my very
last film. The choices I make will
define who I am and define what
kind of filmmaker I will be."
Instead, Lin applied for ten
credit cards, made a last-minute
phone call to acquaintance MC
Hammer, and on a budget of
$500,000, "Better Luck Tomor
row" was made.
Fora 31-year-old filmmaker
on the cusp of a lucrative career,
Lin is surprisingly apprehen
sive. An unspoken air of con
tained anxiety permeates his
pose and words. Gone are the
trademark glasses, sweatshirts
and haphazard beanie übiqui
tous in the BLT: Genesis video
clips and mug shots. His Ba
nana-Republic-ad sweater,
slacks and carefully-combed
hair belie his casualness.
He answers questions hur
riedly, politely but emotionless
ly, and the smooth, polished an
swers Lin delivers seem to have
been prepackaged for many a
previous interrogator. He has
been in this ring many times be
fore, and he accepts and coun
ters each move with mechanical
efficiency.
"I feel like it's an uphill battle,"
he emphasizes again. "You feel
like you're being punched from
all directions, and this is just the
beginning of the next battle."
Lin's future plans already in
clude another MTV film, an in
dependent project, a Spike Lee
production and a studio project
with 20th Century Fox.
"I'm not going to rest," states
Lin determinedly, unflinching
ly. "I want to make sure the mo
mentum carries on. We've
opened some doors — I don't
want to stop now."
Justin Lin has learned to take
the punches, roll with them, and
punch back.

den, sex-drugs-and-violence lives of four
young Southern California Asian-Ameri
can high school superstars, the audience

erupted into a shouting match when Lin
and his cast took the stage for questions.
The tumult brought to Lin's defense such
renowned film critics as Elvis Mitchell and
Roger Ebert, who stood, red-faced and fin
ger-shaking, before the squabbling audi
ence.
"What 1 find offensive and condescend
ing," Ebert fumed, "is nobody would say
[what you are saying] to a bunch of white
filmmakers. . . This film has the right to be
about these people, and Asian American
characters have the right to be whoever
they want to be."
It was enough to put Lin's name on the
fast track to Hollywood. After negotiations
with several film companies, "Better Luck
Tomorrow" became MTV Films' first out
side film acquisition. The film's record
breaking turnout in April for initial screen

ings in Los Angeles, New York, San Fran
cisco and Chicago spotlighted Better Luck
Tomorrow as a film of pioneering cultural
significance in the field of American cine
matography.
Lin's only complaint is that his cell
phone has since been ringing nonstop.
For Lin, it is the culmination of years of
pursuing a dream that, surprisingly, did
not begin to take form until his junior un
dergraduate year at UCLA. Born in Tai
wan, Lin moved to Orange County, Cali
fornia at age eight. An avid basketball play
er, the young Lin was determined to play in
the NBA. "I was pretty good, but, obvious
ly, I stopped growing," he says now, laugh
ing.
In his junior year at UCLA, however,
Lin watched two films that changed his
life's ambitions. The artistry behind Francis
Ford Coppola's Tucker and Spike Lee's Do
the Right Thing captured the young stu
dent's imagination and curiosity. Tenta
tively, he applied for UCLA's School of
Film and Television. After shooting his first
short — a 10-minute story called Soybean
Milk about a Chinese immigrant struggling
to reorient himself in Chinatown — Lin
knew he had found his passion. Although
he had had to take on three jobs to pay for
tuition, rent and the $4,000 budget for the
film, he was hooked.
"The challenge got me addicted," I.in
explains, frankly. "It was like basketball,
but to the next level. You're like the point
guard, dealing with all these egos. You
have to make sure everyone is running the
play and everything's in line so you can
achieve the vision... That's what excites
me."
In 1998, Lin went on to direct his first
feature length film with fellow UCLA film
student Quentin Lee. Released by Margin
Films, Lee's independent distribution com
pany, Shopping For Fangs was a surreal,
uneasy psycho-thriller about a pair of sexu
ally repressed loners who believe their per-

sonal quirks have supernatural
origins. Also featuring an all
Asian-American cast, Fangs
sought to explore the issue of
identity in sexual and cultural
alienation. Though screened in
ternationally in numerous festi
vals. however, Fangs eventually
slipped through the media rela
tively unnoticed.
A subsequent look at his bank
account told Lin that his sopho
more film debut could very well
be his last. Attempts at shopping
the "Better Luck Tomorrow"
script around to large film com
panies resulted in several oilers
for funding, but on one condi
tion — Lin must change the eth
nicities of his Asian-American
characters.
"The situation . . . really made
me question the reasons why 1
wanted to make the film," Lin re
flects, "exactly what kind of film I
wanted to make il it were my very
last film. The choices I make will
define who I am and define what
kind of filmmaker I will be."
Instead, Lin applied for ten
credit cards, made a last-minute
phone call to acquaintance MC
Hammer, and on a budget of
$500,000, "Better Luck Tomor
row" was made.
Fora 31-year-old filmmaker
on the cusp of a lucrative career,
Lin is surprisingly apprehen
sive. An unspoken air of con
tained anxiety permeates his
pose and words. Gone are the
trademark glasses, sweatshirts
and haphazard beanie übiqui
tous in the BLT: Genesis video
clips and mug shots. His Ba
nana-Republic-ad sweater,
slacks and carefully-combed
hair belie his casualness.
He answers questions hur
riedly, politely but emotionless
ly, and the smooth, polished an
swers Lin delivers seem to have
been prepackaged for many a
previous interrogator. He has
been in this ring many times be
fore, and he accepts and coun
ters each move with mechanical
efficiency.
"I feel like it's an uphill battle,"
he emphasizes again. "You feel
like you're being punched from
all directions, and this is just the
beginning of the next battle."
Lin's future plans already in
clude another MTV film, an in
dependent project, a Spike Lee
production and a studio project
with 20th Century Fox.
"I'm not going to rest," states
Lin determinedly, unflinching
ly. "I want to make sure the mo
mentum carries on. We've
opened some doors — I don't
want to stop now."
Justin Lin has learned to take
the punches, roll with them, and
punch back.
"The whole journey is about battling,"
reflects Justin Lin, acclaimed director of
the groundbreaking, controversy-stimulat
ing MTV film "Better Luck Tomorrow."
"It's like you wake up in the morning and
you feel like you have to light ten battles."
The blows and battles along the road are
something Lin has become accustomed to
since "Better Luck Tomorrow" — a stir
ring, disturbingly true-to-life tale of
teenage Asian-American suburbia — first
screened at last January's Sundance Film
Festival. Polarized by Lin's unapologetic,
counter-stereotype portrayal of the hid
den, sex-drugs-and-violence lives of four
young Southern California Asian-Ameri
can high school superstars, the audience

erupted into a shouting match when Lin
and his cast took the stage for questions.
