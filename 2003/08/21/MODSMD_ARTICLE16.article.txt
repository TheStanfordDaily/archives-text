# "Better Luck" director sets sights on tomorrow

"The whole journey is about battling,"
reflects Justin Lin, acclaimed director of
the groundbreaking, controversy-stimulat
ing MTV film "Better Luck Tomorrow."
"It's like you wake up in the morning and
you feel like you have to light ten battles."
The blows and battles along the road are
something Lin has become accustomed to
since "Better Luck Tomorrow" — a stir
ring, disturbingly true-to-life tale of
teenage Asian-American suburbia — first
screened at last January's Sundance Film
Festival. Polarized by Lin's unapologetic,
counter-stereotype portrayal of the hid
den, sex-drugs-and-violence lives of four
young Southern California Asian-Ameri
can high school superstars, the audience

erupted into a shouting match when Lin
and his cast took the stage for questions.
The tumult brought to Lin's defense such
renowned film critics as Elvis Mitchell and
Roger Ebert, who stood, red-faced and fin
ger-shaking, before the squabbling audi
ence.
"What 1 find offensive and condescend
ing," Ebert fumed, "is nobody would say
[what you are saying] to a bunch of white
filmmakers. . . This film has the right to be
about these people, and Asian American
characters have the right to be whoever
they want to be."
It was enough to put Lin's name on the
fast track to Hollywood. After negotiations
with several film companies, "Better Luck
Tomorrow" became MTV Films' first out
side film acquisition. The film's record
breaking turnout in April for initial screen

ings in Los Angeles, New York, San Fran
cisco and Chicago spotlighted Better Luck
Tomorrow as a film of pioneering cultural
significance in the field of American cine
matography.
Lin's only complaint is that his cell
phone has since been ringing nonstop.
For Lin, it is the culmination of years of
pursuing a dream that, surprisingly, did
not begin to take form until his junior un
dergraduate year at UCLA. Born in Tai
wan, Lin moved to Orange County, Cali
fornia at age eight. An avid basketball play
er, the young Lin was determined to play in
the NBA. "I was pretty good, but, obvious
ly, I stopped growing," he says now, laugh
ing.
In his junior year at UCLA, however,
Lin watched two films that changed his
life's ambitions. The artistry behind Francis
Ford Coppola's Tucker and Spike Lee's Do
the Right Thing captured the young stu
dent's imagination and curiosity. Tenta
tively, he applied for UCLA's School of
Film and Television. After shooting his first
short — a 10-minute story called Soybean
Milk about a Chinese immigrant struggling
to reorient himself in Chinatown — Lin
knew he had found his passion. Although
he had had to take on three jobs to pay for
tuition, rent and the $4,000 budget for the
film, he was hooked.
"The challenge got me addicted," I.in
explains, frankly. "It was like basketball,
but to the next level. You're like the point
guard, dealing with all these egos. You
have to make sure everyone is running the
play and everything's in line so you can
achieve the vision... That's what excites
me."
In 1998, Lin went on to direct his first
feature length film with fellow UCLA film
student Quentin Lee. Released by Margin
Films, Lee's independent distribution com
pany, Shopping For Fangs was a surreal,
uneasy psycho-thriller about a pair of sexu
ally repressed loners who believe their per-
