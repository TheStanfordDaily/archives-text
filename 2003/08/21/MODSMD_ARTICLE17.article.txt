# "Uptown Girls" goes down without a fight
## 
### SUSAN YUN 
"Uptown Girls," starring Brit
tany Murphy and Dakota Fanning,
painfully underestimates the intel
ligence of the audience by trying to
pass off a tired formula without
making an attempt to add anything
ofsubstance.
"Uptown Girls" is a reverse
fairy-tale story, in which Molly, the
orphaned trust-fund daughter of a
rock star, lives the life of a "Man
hattan princess." Unfortunately,

Molly gets a cold wake-up call
when her trust fund is embezzled
of some $100 million dollars.
Forced to now find a job, but pos
sessing no qualifications whatsoev
er, not even the most basic sem
blances of responsibility, Molly
eventually lands a position as the
nanny of an eight-year-old girl
Ray, played by Dakota Fanning.
The job, given Molly's miserable
failings at everything else, seems an
unlikely fit, and forcing it into the
storyline is the first of many bumps

PLAYING EVERYWHERE
I _l
the movie encounters.
Molly doesn't pay attention to
alarm docks, has no idea how bills
are paid and likes to twirl like a

fairy on her walks through the
park. Ray is a mini-adult of the
most frightening variety. She car
ries her own soap to public re
strooms, takes startling (jiiantities
of pills (on the minute, and only
with Evian!), and spouts "funda
mentals are the building blocks of
fun" as her mantra.
Different though they are, the
two girls, as it turns out, actually
have a lot in common. Rav's moth
