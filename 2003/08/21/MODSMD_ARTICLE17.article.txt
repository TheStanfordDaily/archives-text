# "Uptown Girls" goes down without a fight
## 
### SUSAN YUN 
"Uptown Girls," starring Brit
tany Murphy and Dakota Fanning,
painfully underestimates the intel
ligence of the audience by trying to
pass off a tired formula without
making an attempt to add anything
ofsubstance.
"Uptown Girls" is a reverse
fairy-tale story, in which Molly, the
orphaned trust-fund daughter of a
rock star, lives the life of a "Man
hattan princess." Unfortunately,

Molly gets a cold wake-up call
when her trust fund is embezzled
of some $100 million dollars.
Forced to now find a job, but pos
sessing no qualifications whatsoev
er, not even the most basic sem
blances of responsibility, Molly
eventually lands a position as the
nanny of an eight-year-old girl
Ray, played by Dakota Fanning.
The job, given Molly's miserable
failings at everything else, seems an
unlikely fit, and forcing it into the
storyline is the first of many bumps

I _l
the movie encounters.
Molly doesn't pay attention to
alarm docks, has no idea how bills
are paid and likes to twirl like a

fairy on her walks through the
park. Ray is a mini-adult of the
most frightening variety. She car
ries her own soap to public re
strooms, takes startling (jiiantities
of pills (on the minute, and only
with Evian!), and spouts "funda
mentals are the building blocks of
fun" as her mantra.
Different though they are, the
two girls, as it turns out, actually
have a lot in common. Rav's moth
er is a powerhouse record execu
tive with no time for her young
child, and her father lies in a coma
surrounded by bleeping machines
and cold wires. Like Molly, Ray is
essentially an orphan. Also like
Molly, Ray has built an emotional
armor to protect herself from the
pain she is feeling. Only, the
method of escapism for the two
girls is very different: while Molly
has refused to grow up, deal with
reality, and accept responsibility,
Ray has forsaken her childhood.
The two girls initially clash, then
form a bond, and are supposed to
rescue each other from their respec
tive extremes. However, the trans
formations are far from believable.
Molly is supposed to be growing into
an adult, but she continues to
prance through the movie as if she
were on speed. Ray is supposed to
learn how to let loose a bit and have
fun like an eight year old should, but
her breaking out of traditional ballet
and doing a bit of "free form dance"
is really not sufficient proof of
growth and healing — or at least not
when directed as it was in this film.
Director Boa/ Yakin takes a tired
formula and adds stilted editing to
really nail the lid of the coffin shut.
Yakin continuously maneuvers the

actors into strained, superficial
scenes. The climax of the film sup
posedly shows the girls bonding to
gether over their grief, and over
coining the armors they have put
up around themselves. Unfortu
nately. the scene was overly dramat
ic, without any convincing sub
stance, and even more unfortunate
ly, representative of the entire film.
The movie, already headed for
catastrophe under a weak script
and bad directing, becomes painful
to watch because the characters are
so annoying — yet another by
product of the poorly written script.
Molly is self-centered, irrespon
sible, and spoiled. She briefly dates
an up-and-coming rock star, Neal
(Jesse Spencer), who shares many
of her personality traits. One mo
ment she's obsessed with him, and
the other moment she can't wait to
have him gone. When he does
leave, she stalks him. Sometime
during the course of the movie,
Molly has supposedly undergone
the transformation that enables her
to shed her previous spoiled self. At
this point, she accuses Neal of his
selfishness and indifference, but
fails to be truly convincing of her
own growth.
In addition to Neal, Molly is sur
rounded by other characters as an
noying as herself. Her "best
friend," Ingrid (Marley Shelton), is
a Martha Stewart-in-training who
helps out her distressed friend by

taking her in - and then charging
her half the rent to her apartment.
Molly returns her friend's generos
ity by repeatedly flaking on plans
and then accusing Ingrid of de
manding too much of their friend
ship. Wonderful people, truly,
whom I enjoyed watching for two
hours.
The only character 1 did enjoy
watching was Ray, and only to a
limited extent. Fanning, whose
character is hypochondriac, obses
sive, and neurotic, is fascinating to
watch because, despite the extreme
idiosyncrasies, Ray seems real. Fan
ning successful conveys the hurt
that Ray, as an eight year old kid,
feels in being abandoned by her
parents through rare, restrained
moments that make the pain por
trayed more palpable.
Ultimately, the actors sold them
selves out by settling for the parts in
this film. Both Murphy and Fan
ning have the skill to play more in
teresting characters than the ones
this script limited them to. The
weight the strong actors in this film
bring to the flimsy script and un
steady directing create an unbal
ance that only ensures the movie's
failure.
My recommendation is: skip this
film, and if for some reason you re
ally like the storyline, rent "Maid to
Order" instead. It at least has in
teresting, likable and believable
characters.

her breaking out of traditional ballet
and doing a bit of "free form dance"
is really not sufficient proof of
growth and healing — or at least not
when directed as it was in this film.
Director Boa/ Yakin takes a tired
formula and adds stilted editing to
really nail the lid of the coffin shut.
Yakin continuously maneuvers the

actors into strained, superficial
scenes. The climax of the film sup
posedly shows the girls bonding to
gether over their grief, and over
coining the armors they have put
up around themselves. Unfortu
nately. the scene was overly dramat
ic, without any convincing sub
stance, and even more unfortunate
ly, representative of the entire film.
The movie, already headed for
catastrophe under a weak script
and bad directing, becomes painful
to watch because the characters are
so annoying — yet another by
product of the poorly written script.
Molly is self-centered, irrespon
sible, and spoiled. She briefly dates
an up-and-coming rock star, Neal
(Jesse Spencer), who shares many
of her personality traits. One mo
ment she's obsessed with him, and
the other moment she can't wait to
have him gone. When he does
leave, she stalks him. Sometime
during the course of the movie,
Molly has supposedly undergone
the transformation that enables her
to shed her previous spoiled self. At
this point, she accuses Neal of his
selfishness and indifference, but
fails to be truly convincing of her
own growth.
In addition to Neal, Molly is sur
rounded by other characters as an
noying as herself. Her "best
friend," Ingrid (Marley Shelton), is
a Martha Stewart-in-training who
helps out her distressed friend by

taking her in - and then charging
her half the rent to her apartment.
Molly returns her friend's generos
ity by repeatedly flaking on plans
and then accusing Ingrid of de
manding too much of their friend
ship. Wonderful people, truly,
whom I enjoyed watching for two
hours.
The only character 1 did enjoy
watching was Ray, and only to a
limited extent. Fanning, whose
character is hypochondriac, obses
sive, and neurotic, is fascinating to
watch because, despite the extreme
idiosyncrasies, Ray seems real. Fan
ning successful conveys the hurt
that Ray, as an eight year old kid,
feels in being abandoned by her
parents through rare, restrained
moments that make the pain por
trayed more palpable.
Ultimately, the actors sold them
selves out by settling for the parts in
this film. Both Murphy and Fan
ning have the skill to play more in
teresting characters than the ones
this script limited them to. The
weight the strong actors in this film
bring to the flimsy script and un
steady directing create an unbal
ance that only ensures the movie's
failure.
My recommendation is: skip this
film, and if for some reason you re
ally like the storyline, rent "Maid to
Order" instead. It at least has in
teresting, likable and believable
characters.

Two of a kind: Former rich girl Molly (Brittany Murphy) and takes maturity
lessons from babysitting charge Ray (Dakota Fanning) in "Uptown Girls."
"Uptown Girls," starring Brit
tany Murphy and Dakota Fanning,
painfully underestimates the intel
ligence of the audience by trying to
pass off a tired formula without
making an attempt to add anything
ofsubstance.
"Uptown Girls" is a reverse
fairy-tale story, in which Molly, the
orphaned trust-fund daughter of a
rock star, lives the life of a "Man
hattan princess." Unfortunately,

Molly gets a cold wake-up call
when her trust fund is embezzled
of some $100 million dollars.
Forced to now find a job, but pos
sessing no qualifications whatsoev
er, not even the most basic sem
blances of responsibility, Molly
eventually lands a position as the
nanny of an eight-year-old girl
Ray, played by Dakota Fanning.
The job, given Molly's miserable
failings at everything else, seems an
unlikely fit, and forcing it into the
storyline is the first of many bumps

PLAYING EVERYWHERE
I _l
the movie encounters.
Molly doesn't pay attention to
alarm docks, has no idea how bills
are paid and likes to twirl like a

fairy on her walks through the
park. Ray is a mini-adult of the
most frightening variety. She car
ries her own soap to public re
strooms, takes startling (jiiantities
of pills (on the minute, and only
with Evian!), and spouts "funda
mentals are the building blocks of
fun" as her mantra.
Different though they are, the
two girls, as it turns out, actually
have a lot in common. Rav's moth
er is a powerhouse record execu
tive with no time for her young
child, and her father lies in a coma
surrounded by bleeping machines
and cold wires. Like Molly, Ray is
essentially an orphan. Also like
Molly, Ray has built an emotional
armor to protect herself from the
pain she is feeling. Only, the
method of escapism for the two
girls is very different: while Molly
has refused to grow up, deal with
reality, and accept responsibility,
Ray has forsaken her childhood.
The two girls initially clash, then
form a bond, and are supposed to
rescue each other from their respec
tive extremes. However, the trans
formations are far from believable.
Molly is supposed to be growing into
an adult, but she continues to
prance through the movie as if she
were on speed. Ray is supposed to
learn how to let loose a bit and have
fun like an eight year old should, but
her breaking out of traditional ballet
and doing a bit of "free form dance"
is really not sufficient proof of
growth and healing — or at least not
when directed as it was in this film.
