## "Versus" 
### 
First-time Japanese writer-director Ryuhei Kitamura's
"Versus" is probably the closest a movie can come to a shot of
pure adrenaline. The action sequences are so outrageously
over the top and the filmmakers take so much glee in throw
ing ridiculously disparate ideas together with minimal ex
planation that the whole ridiculous package brought a big,
stupid grin to my face.
The film opens with the pretty-boy hero (an escaped pris
oner played by Tak Sakaguchi) lleeing into a forest with a
beautiful companion (Chieko Misaka). A squad of murder
ous Yakuza (Japanese gangsters) pursues the pair. Little do
they realize that they're entering the Forest of Resurrection,
where the dead (mainly the Yakuza's past victims) rise to
wreak bloody vengeance on everyone, and where a powerful
wizard (Hideo Sakaki) with a mysterious connection to our
hero waits.
And then the story starts to get really crazy.
"Versus", needless to say, is not a subtle, artistic film
through which the audience learns and grows. Instead, it's
all about kicking ass, gory violence and giving geeky fanboys
exactly what they want. Guns fire, stuff blows up and the
hero dons a black jacket and sunglasses to slice his enemies
in half.
Although "Versus" drags on fora bit at the end, there's
enough kinetic poetry in the climactic final battle to make
me forgive almost anything. And the beautifully fatalistic
final shot (final except for an idiotic coda that 1 choose to ig
nore) is priceless.
