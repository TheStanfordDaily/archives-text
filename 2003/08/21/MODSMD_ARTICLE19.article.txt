# Warren keeps the heat on a cool new mix from Iceland
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As an American, it is easy to forget that the techno
genre is more expansive than the limited array ot
MTV-friendly groups like The Crystal Method or
Dirty Vegas. One l)| that has been oft-overlooked is
Nick Warren, a mix-master of substantial acclaim in
the British electronic music community, although he
is relatively unknown on the other side of "the pond."
While not wielding the pop appeal of Paul Oaken
fold, Warren has held his own in the techno music
scene tor over a decade. In 1994, he joined with Jody
Wisternolf to form Way Out West, which shortly
thereafter scored a massive club hit with the piece
"Ajare." However, it was"The (lift" single, released in
1997, that brought Warren the European fanfare lie
had long sought. He soon had a residency at the
renowned Liverpool club Cream — the high-water
mark of success for any veteran DJ — and he made his
first contribution to the respected Global Under
ground series.
Avid listeners of Warren's releases have no doubt
noted the interesting evolution of his mixes in the GU
series. While his first release, a 1997 Prague mix, is
reminiscent of old-school trance, featuring big beats
and over-t he-top peaks and troughs, his Brazil mix is
sued a year later follows in a similar vein, yet undeni
ably has a more foreign and funky sound to it. And cu
riously enough, with the subsequent Budapest set in
2000 as arguably his most hard-hitting trance release
to date, Warren's Amsterdam mix, released later that

year, makes an unexpected u-turn, turning from ex
treme climaxes and lulls to a slower set of rhythms that
tease the listener along. Amsterdam never halts, yet at
the same time it never comes full-swing. In many
ways, this release helped create a bastion of retreat for
true electronic connoisseurs amidst the broadening of
the mainstream trance onslaught, which capitalized
on the late 1990s trance "big beat" sound but checked
any originality and noteworthiness at the door.
Thankfully, Warren still holds his own in ihe pro
gressive house arena on his latest release Reykjavik,
which is his fifth GU contribution and the 24th entry in
the series overall. Indeed, following in the tradition of
Amsterdam, Warren seems to have further refined what
was already an excellent, slow-yet-steady approach to

mixing music. Most importantly,
even though it is a two-disc compila
tion, the Reykjavik mix is solid from
start to finish — a teat difficult to
achieve, with DJs today often pro
viding dual-disc offerings, only to
have one CD overwhelming and the
other simply short of satisfying.
Much of the first disc is more
like a nomadic dream-like experi
ence, and it is clear that Warren's
agenda is not immediately out in
the open. He doesn't rapidly drag
the listener up and down, but
rather, strings him along with
groovy beats that subtly devolve
into subsequent tracks. However,
the delivery is always intriguing —

never lackluster. Opening tracks
like Avatar's "Dub in Time" and
Substructure's "Firewire" slowly
give way to peaceful and almost
passive pieces such as Boards of
Canada's "Happy Cycling." But
halfway through the album, War
ren begins to build the tension and
gradually transitions the set from
an aimless wandering into a more
purposed anticipatory experience,
which eventually culminates in the
climatic Burufunk's "Outsider/
Global Communication" track. Yet
even this song gives way in the
middle to provide the listener with
a lull and audio dub-in of a man es
pousing a prophecy of doom. Af
terward, Grayarea's "Yewminyst"
and Glimmer of Dope's "Love
Lost" are provided as steady and
deliberate pieces that close out the
first disc, inviting reflection on the

progress that has been made so far.
While the first CD is warm and
lighthearted for the most part, the
second disc takes on a larger and
darker progressive sound, some
what of a cross between Warren's
earlier Budapest and Amsterdam
releases. The second track, "Aural
Navigation Part 2" by Aural Imbal
ance, initially sets the stage fora
disc somewhat reminiscent of the
first, sounding as if it has no defi
nite direction in mind. However,
the following piece "Rise" by Vec
tor sharply rebuffs any speculation
that second disc might simply fol
low in the first's footsteps. The mix
gets increasingly menacing and
tribal, ultimately resulting in
Raima's "Rambient." However,
the disc then takes a turn back to
ward the day-dreamy territory of
CD one, with "Crayons" bv Starkid

and "Strawberry Fields" by Sub
sky, which prepare the listener for
the mix's conclusion. Appropriate
ly enough, just as the two-disc set
started with an dilatory and un
purposed rhythm, so the mix
ends, with a incremented cessation
of instrument playback in the last
track "Last Minute Flight" (the title
of which is reflective of the seem
ingly impromptu nature of the
album as a whole), sounding as if
the entire set has run its course and
simply run out of gas.
All in all, Reykjavik is an excel
lent compilation of music and a
worthy addition to any electronic
music lover's collection. By setting
the stage lor nothing in particular,
Nick Warren lets the mix call the
shots and ends up with a beautiful,
it not transcendent (pardon the
pun, please), experience.

pun, please), experience.
As an American, it is easy to forget that the techno
genre is more expansive than the limited array ot
MTV-friendly groups like The Crystal Method or
Dirty Vegas. One l)| that has been oft-overlooked is
Nick Warren, a mix-master of substantial acclaim in
the British electronic music community, although he
is relatively unknown on the other side of "the pond."
While not wielding the pop appeal of Paul Oaken
fold, Warren has held his own in the techno music
scene tor over a decade. In 1994, he joined with Jody
Wisternolf to form Way Out West, which shortly
thereafter scored a massive club hit with the piece
"Ajare." However, it was"The (lift" single, released in
1997, that brought Warren the European fanfare lie
had long sought. He soon had a residency at the
renowned Liverpool club Cream — the high-water
mark of success for any veteran DJ — and he made his
first contribution to the respected Global Under
ground series.
Avid listeners of Warren's releases have no doubt
noted the interesting evolution of his mixes in the GU
series. While his first release, a 1997 Prague mix, is
reminiscent of old-school trance, featuring big beats
and over-t he-top peaks and troughs, his Brazil mix is
sued a year later follows in a similar vein, yet undeni
ably has a more foreign and funky sound to it. And cu
riously enough, with the subsequent Budapest set in
2000 as arguably his most hard-hitting trance release
to date, Warren's Amsterdam mix, released later that

year, makes an unexpected u-turn, turning from ex
treme climaxes and lulls to a slower set of rhythms that
tease the listener along. Amsterdam never halts, yet at
the same time it never comes full-swing. In many
ways, this release helped create a bastion of retreat for
true electronic connoisseurs amidst the broadening of
the mainstream trance onslaught, which capitalized
on the late 1990s trance "big beat" sound but checked
any originality and noteworthiness at the door.
Thankfully, Warren still holds his own in ihe pro
gressive house arena on his latest release Reykjavik,
which is his fifth GU contribution and the 24th entry in
the series overall. Indeed, following in the tradition of
Amsterdam, Warren seems to have further refined what
was already an excellent, slow-yet-steady approach to

mixing music. Most importantly,
even though it is a two-disc compila
tion, the Reykjavik mix is solid from
start to finish — a teat difficult to
achieve, with DJs today often pro
viding dual-disc offerings, only to
have one CD overwhelming and the
other simply short of satisfying.
Much of the first disc is more
like a nomadic dream-like experi
ence, and it is clear that Warren's
agenda is not immediately out in
the open. He doesn't rapidly drag
the listener up and down, but
rather, strings him along with
groovy beats that subtly devolve
into subsequent tracks. However,
the delivery is always intriguing —

never lackluster. Opening tracks
like Avatar's "Dub in Time" and
Substructure's "Firewire" slowly
give way to peaceful and almost
passive pieces such as Boards of
Canada's "Happy Cycling." But
halfway through the album, War
ren begins to build the tension and
gradually transitions the set from
an aimless wandering into a more
purposed anticipatory experience,
which eventually culminates in the
climatic Burufunk's "Outsider/
Global Communication" track. Yet
even this song gives way in the
middle to provide the listener with
a lull and audio dub-in of a man es
pousing a prophecy of doom. Af
terward, Grayarea's "Yewminyst"
and Glimmer of Dope's "Love
Lost" are provided as steady and
deliberate pieces that close out the
first disc, inviting reflection on the

progress that has been made so far.
While the first CD is warm and
lighthearted for the most part, the
second disc takes on a larger and
darker progressive sound, some
what of a cross between Warren's
earlier Budapest and Amsterdam
releases. The second track, "Aural
Navigation Part 2" by Aural Imbal
ance, initially sets the stage fora
disc somewhat reminiscent of the
first, sounding as if it has no defi
nite direction in mind. However,
the following piece "Rise" by Vec
tor sharply rebuffs any speculation
that second disc might simply fol
low in the first's footsteps. The mix
gets increasingly menacing and
tribal, ultimately resulting in
Raima's "Rambient." However,
the disc then takes a turn back to
ward the day-dreamy territory of
CD one, with "Crayons" bv Starkid

and "Strawberry Fields" by Sub
sky, which prepare the listener for
the mix's conclusion. Appropriate
ly enough, just as the two-disc set
started with an dilatory and un
purposed rhythm, so the mix

of instrument playback in the last
track "Last Minute Flight" (the title
of which is reflective of the seem
ingly impromptu nature of the
album as a whole), sounding as if
the entire set has run its course and
simply run out of gas.
All in all, Reykjavik is an excel

worthy addition to any electronic
music lover's collection. By setting
the stage lor nothing in particular,
Nick Warren lets the mix call the
