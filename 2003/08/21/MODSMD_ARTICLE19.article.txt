# Warren keeps the heat on a cool new mix from Iceland

### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As an American, it is easy to forget that the techno
genre is more expansive than the limited array ot
MTV-friendly groups like The Crystal Method or
Dirty Vegas. One l)| that has been oft-overlooked is
Nick Warren, a mix-master of substantial acclaim in
the British electronic music community, although he
is relatively unknown on the other side of "the pond."
While not wielding the pop appeal of Paul Oaken
fold, Warren has held his own in the techno music
scene tor over a decade. In 1994, he joined with Jody
Wisternolf to form Way Out West, which shortly
thereafter scored a massive club hit with the piece
"Ajare." However, it was"The (lift" single, released in
1997, that brought Warren the European fanfare lie
had long sought. He soon had a residency at the
renowned Liverpool club Cream — the high-water
mark of success for any veteran DJ — and he made his
first contribution to the respected Global Under
ground series.
Avid listeners of Warren's releases have no doubt
noted the interesting evolution of his mixes in the GU
series. While his first release, a 1997 Prague mix, is
reminiscent of old-school trance, featuring big beats
and over-t he-top peaks and troughs, his Brazil mix is
sued a year later follows in a similar vein, yet undeni
ably has a more foreign and funky sound to it. And cu
riously enough, with the subsequent Budapest set in
2000 as arguably his most hard-hitting trance release
to date, Warren's Amsterdam mix, released later that

year, makes an unexpected u-turn, turning from ex
treme climaxes and lulls to a slower set of rhythms that
tease the listener along. Amsterdam never halts, yet at
the same time it never comes full-swing. In many
ways, this release helped create a bastion of retreat for
true electronic connoisseurs amidst the broadening of
the mainstream trance onslaught, which capitalized
on the late 1990s trance "big beat" sound but checked
any originality and noteworthiness at the door.
Thankfully, Warren still holds his own in ihe pro
gressive house arena on his latest release Reykjavik,
which is his fifth GU contribution and the 24th entry in
the series overall. Indeed, following in the tradition of
Amsterdam, Warren seems to have further refined what
was already an excellent, slow-yet-steady approach to
