## Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution 
### ERIC FORD 
Sega's "Virtua Fighter 4:Evolu
tion," an expansion of the original
"Virtua Fighter 4", improves every
liicet of the game. What was excel
lent is now nearly perfect.
It's also the only inexpensive title
I know that is also a serious con
tender tor lighter game of the year.
For those unfamiliar with Sega's
fighter series, "Virtua Fighter" con
centrates on realistic lighting moves
— as opposed to the special moves
featured in a lighter game like
"Street Fighter," for example. Tim
ing and concentration are needed to
master this type of game. While this
may not appeal to all casual gamers,
"Virtual ighter" has always been a
favorite of the hardcore gamers out
there. I his version further expands
on that ideal with all the new fea
tures that have been added.
The story behind VF4:Evo is a
typical fighting game storyline. Ba
sic ally, there's a tournament being
held and a host of characters sign
up to prove their worth, earn some
cash, or find a rival that's also par
ticipating in the said tournament.
Nothing too exciting, with the
exception that now Sega lias added
.m additional storyline involving
the player. You can travel from ar
cade to arcade, building your rep
utation in the game until you get

good enough to enter tourna
ments and win cash. An interesting
addition, to say the least.
So, what makes "Evolution" so
different from the original? Well,
lor starters, Sega has added two
new characters to the cast. ()ne is a
lighter that looks awfully like a vam
pire, and the other is a Thai kick
boxer. Every character in the game
has been given new moves to make
them all more balanced. Also, a new
Quest mode has been added, allow
ing players to "participate" in
Japanese arcades by lighting oppo
nents and unlocking over 1,500
items to customize their fighters
(previously that number was ap
proximately 300).
Another feature of the Quest
mode is the ability to play against
computer opponents with A.I.
modeled after actual Tokyo game
players that have won tourna
ments in real life. Combine all this
with improved graphics, and Sega
has made quite an argument for
buying this game again.
Luckily, Sega has not tampered
with what made the original so
great — the control. Control in
this game is about as perfect as a
lighting game can get. If done cor
rectly, lighting moves are executed
whenever the player desires.
There is no slowdown during
battle, and the animation is so

fluid, you'll feel as if you're simply
an extension of the actual c harac
ter. While ii may take many hours
of training to master one charac
ter, you'll have such a fun time
doing so, you won't even care. A
training mode is included in the
game, teaching everything from
simple blocking to the more ad
vanced counters. T he training
mode is actually very handy and
will take you a long way into mas
tering everything the game offers.
I'he sound in "Virtua Fighter"
is also top-notch. The music helps

convey a "cool feeling" to every
thing that's done in the game.
The presentation is also magnif
icent. Fighting in an ancient arena
surrounded by statues and
columns that are being destroyed
by lightning while you battle is
truly a heady experience.
All of this, of course, is great as a
single-player experience, but only
becomes better when you find a
friend to join in. The game is so
balanced that players of equal skill
will find themselves playing for
hours on end, trying new moves

and experimenting with different
characters just to see how it feels.
By improving on everything that
was there before, and simply
adding a whole lot more of what
made it great, "Virtua Fighter 4:
Evolution" will surely make a great
addition to your library. It isn't just
a game; it's an experience. In order
to appreciate everything, you'll sim
ply have to go out there and buy it.
Even owners of the original should
take heed. Anyways, how could you
go wrong with a title that costs only
twentv dollars?
