# DJ legend BT's latest disappoints potential
## 
### DOUGLAS WILSON 
Examining Brian Transeau's new release
Emotional Technology', it's difficult to over
estimate the distance that DJ legend has
fallen, both artistically and otherwise.
()nce upon a time, 1 ranseau, who
more commonly goes by the pseudonym
"BT," was one of dance music's great mas
terminds. Pushing a refreshingly organic
sound that combined the sexy, sleek beats
of House and the dreamy vibe of Trance,
BT stormed the dance world with his
debut Ima (1995) and follow-up album
ESCM (1997). Classy hits such as "Loving
r'ou More," "Mercury and Solace," and the

Tori Amos collaboration "Blue Skies" frequently
found themselves on DJ sets around the world, and
quickly set BT apart from the staples of the floundering
Trance-Fop scene.
But in recent years, BT has distanced himself from
his signature style, increasingly adopting a more
mainstream sound. In fact, by all indications BT has
become a full-fledged Pop artist, and has even served
as a guest producer for teeny-bopper favorites like

Britney Spears and N'Sync.
The end result of this "artistic: reinvention" is Emotional Technol
ogy, a tiring, superficial mishmash of popular styles that

stands as an insult both to intelligent electronica and to the great artist
that BT once was.
For starters, BT dabbles in genres jarringly at odds with his more
ethereal dance music overtones. In opening track "Knowledge of Self,"
fin* instance, he overlays rapping over an edgy club beat, with decided
ly awkward results. And perhaps even more regrettable are his several
Rock/Trance experiments, in which wailing guitar chords clash with
whiny singing and muddy, half-brained dance beats.
But worst of all, Emotional Technology sounds painfully forced. I n
his apparent quest to produce catchy hooks and a human, emotion
laden vibe, BT instead provides us with mediocre, cheesy vocals,
uninspired background instrumentation, and silly samples. And be
cause of the amount of overproduction, he betrays the essentials, leav
ing us with cookie-cutter beats, nonexistent melodies, and boring
grooves.
To BT's credit, however, Emotional Technology still manages
to bear the intangible mark of a skilled DJ, though the mark is
faint at best. On rare occasions, particularly during the album's
two more successful tracks "Force of Gravity" and"The Great Es
cape," BTts almost able to build a respectable groove. That is, of
course, before cannibalizing himself with a predictable beat, a
trite break, grating vocals, an unnecessary sound effect, or some
combination therein.
As a result, it's tough to shake the feeling that if only BT wasn't so
obsessed with this new image, he could have produced something re
ally wonderful, or at least something worthwhile. Or maybe that's just
my love for the "old BT" talking. Regardless, it's unfortunate to see so
much established talent go to such needless waste.
