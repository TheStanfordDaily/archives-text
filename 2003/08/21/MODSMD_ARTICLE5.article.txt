## Eshoo takes aim at e-spam 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo, whose district includes
Menlo I'ark, Palo Alto and Stan
lord, recently formulated a bill
designed tovombat e-mail spam
through the implementation of
an opt-out program that would
allow consumers to avoid un
wanted commercial — and es
pecially pornographic — mes
sages. The Energy and Com
merce Committee will tackle the
bill when Congress resumes
alter Labor Day weekend.
Introduced on June 19, the
bill currently has 66 co-sponsors,
including Democratic Congress
man Cene Green of Texas and
Congresswoman Heather Wil
son, a Republican from New
Mexico. It pitches the idea fora
"Do Not Spam" list, modeled
after the successful "Do Not Call"
list that allowed consumers to opt
out of relieving calls from tele
marketing company solicitors.
The bill requires that a com
mercial e-mail's subject line
identify the message as an adver

stisement. These e-mails must
contain a clearly stated way to opt
out of receiving future e-mails, a
return address or website that
will allow the recipient to opt out
and the physical street address of
the sender.
Companies must remove
those who choose to opt out
from their mailing lists within
10 days, said Pill Paries, Eshoo's
press secretary. These organiza
tions are also barred from dis
tributing e-mail and contact in
formation for consumers who
opt out of receiving spam for up
to live years.
According to Paries, the legis
lation, known as the Anti-Spam
Act, prohibits companies from
sending e-mail with misleading
subject headings. In order to
protect recipients from unwill
ingly viewing pornographic ma
terial, the act requires those who
send sexually-explicit messages
to provide a way for people to
opt-out without having to actual
ly open the e-mail.
The act is distinguished from
past anti-spatn efforts by its pro
posed penalties. Companies and

individuals who consistently vio
late the legislation's key statutes
may lace up to two years in
prison and / or $250,000 in
lines, Faries said.
"[Eshoo] feels like it's impor
tant to have some strong teeth in
the lgislation, as sometimes heavy
fines are the only thing people
will listen to," Faries said. "It's
very cheap to send ati e-mail,
even relative to telemarketing."
Congressman W. J. Fan/in,
chairman of the House Commit
tee on Energy and Commerce is
also expected to offer an anti
spam in early September.
His hill "has absolutely no
teeth," Eshoo said. "It cannot
keep the promise of eradicating
spam."
Faries said the Eshoo camp
has decided to launch the Anti-
Spam Act at this time because of
the dramatic increase in com
mercial e-mail. More than 50
percent of e-mail messages re
ceived t an be classified as adver
tisements or solicitations, up
from 20 percent just last year.
