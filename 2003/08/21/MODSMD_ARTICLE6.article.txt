# Santa Clara opposes Patriot Act
## Civil rights groups, county officials lead charge against legislation to prevent future prejudice 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervi
sors passed a resolution opposing the U.S. Pa
triot Act in a four-to-one vote 011 Tuesday. By
doing so, the county has joined 150 other com
munities across the country in opposing the
government's policies resulting from the con
troversial Patriot legislation.
The Patriot Act, passed by the U.S. Con
gress on Oct. 24, 2001, shortly after the Sept.
11 attacks, has been assailed by critics as com
promising critical civil liberties granted to
Americans in the Bill of Rights. Proponents, on

necessary and appropriate to ensure home

"How are you going to crack down 011 ter
rorists when investigators can't even read their
e-mails planning new attacks?" asked Adam
Haas, a rising junior. "Everyone makes these
anti-terrorism laws out to be so horrible, but it
you read the fine print, there are only select sit
uations under which these extended powers
can be utilized by government offices. It is all re
ally much ado about nothing."
According to the Coalition, it is currently
making efforts to have a similar resolution
passed in San Jose. The city of Palo Alto already
took a stand against the Patriot Act in early June.
Faheem explained that she worked as part of
the group that helped bring the matter to the
Palo Alto City Council's attention.
"We really worked hard in Palo Alto," she
said. "We talked to city council members, we
talked with the police chief, we talked with the
mayor â€” finally, when it did pass, it is now one
