# Computer worm continues to eat through campus network
## Hackers unleash new virus 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Up to 3,000 campus computers were
infected with three waves of hacker at
tacks last week — 2,800 systems with
the MS Blaster Worm alone — and the
numbers continue to climb with the ap
pearance yesterday of a new virus,
which exploits the same vulnerability in
Microsoft Windows as previous bugs.
Personal computers running Mi
crosoft Windows NT, 2000 and Xl\ in ad
dition to home computers connected to
Stanford through dial-up and broadband
services are susceptible to this new virus.
The vulnerability, referred to as
"RPC buffer overflow," was identified
by Microsoft in mid-July. At the same
time, a protective patch was released to
protect systems from infection.
The patch has been continually
updated to combat the new bugs as
they arise, Sandy Senti, executive di
rector of technology strategy and sup
port for Information Technology Sys
tems and Services. She added that
new patches are available on the ITSS
Web site.
The Internet site recommends com
puter users keep checking the patch
update site until all important patches

are installed, warning that most of the
patch installations require the system
to he rebooted.
"We're working to try to get every
one to patch their systems," Senti said.
"We are currently blocking one of the
ports the worm uses to enter the Stan
lord network."
The only way to repair systems in
fected by both the old and new hugs is to
reformat the hard drive and download
the series of patches.
"We have no information on who the
hackers are where they are based," Senti
said. "There are so many attacks we are
unable to know what's behind it."
The staff at ITSS believe the hackers
intend to use the viruses — most notably
the worm — to shut down specific Web
sites with heavy Internet traffic, especial
ly sites that provide preventive patches.
" The Microsoft Web site started to
experience heavy traffic, but they
changed the Internet address so the
worm wouldn't be able to shut it down,"
Senti said.
For now, ITSS is urging campus users
to t heck patch sites daily for appropriate
updates to prevent the further spread of
existing viruses. New patch alerts and in
formation will lie provided at http://se
