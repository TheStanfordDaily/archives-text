# Winter closure saves bucks
## Campus shut down for two extra weeks 
### HELEN KIM STAFF WRITER 
The University will close the
campus for approximately two
weeks during winter vacation in
an effort to save money, mostly as
a result of reduced utility costs
and adjustments in employees'
vacation schedules.
Director of Human Resources
Client Services Addie Johnson
said that the decision was "made
under the guidance of the presi
dent and provost with direct
input from around the Universi
ty — both faculty and staff."
According to the Stanford Re
port, the University will close the
week of Dec. 22-26, during which
essential operations will remain
active, and encourage depart
ment heads to close the week of
Dec. 29-Jan. 2,2004.
For each of the two weeks that
departments are closed, employ
ees will have an extra day off in
addition to Dec. 25,26 and Jan. 1.
Departments that will close for
the entire two weeks will have
their employees take either five
days of vacation or a combination
of personal time off, vacation and
approved leave without pay.
Chief Information Officer
Chris Handley of Information
Technology Systems and Ser
vices expressed support for the
winter closure.
"Stanford's doing this for fis
cal reasons," Handley said.
"We're going to do what's right
for Stanford — it'll help save
real dollars. It'll also relieve the
University of vacation time. I
think it's the right thing to do."
By cutting back on utility costs
and having employees use their
accrued vacation time, the winter
closure will allow the University to
cut expenses, Randy Livingston,
the vice president for business af
fairs and chief financial officer, told

the Report.
Johnson, who has been direc
tor of Human Resources Client
Services fora year, said that she
thinks the University has had a
winter closure every year for at
least the past eight years. She
added that while many facilities
and functions on campus will
close, a winter closure is different
from a complete shutdown,
which she said has never taken
place at Stanford.
"During a shutdown, every
thing gets shut down," Johnson
said. "During a winter closure,
there are people who work the es
sential functions and there are also
people who are on call in case we
need their help."
Johnson pointed out that
Human Resources has not re
ceived any notification of employ
ees losing potential income that
c( mid be earned during the winter
closure period.
"Winter closure notification
goes out several months before
winter closure, so employees can
save several vacation days," she
said. "The issue of loss of poten
tial income during winter closure
has not come up. Contrary to the
San Jose Mercury News article,
ITSS is being paid because they
are on call."
Johnson differentiated the
way employees were paid based
on an exempt and non-exempt
system.
"We tend to differentiate be
tween exempt and non-exempt,
not hourly or salary. It is impos
sible to know if we have other cat
egories of employees working
that may lie paid on an hourly
basis. As I discussed earlier, the
decision as to who works and / or
units remaining open is a local
decision."
"We have no knowledge of
complaints," she continued.
"We do not know of cases at this
time where someone will have a
loss of pay. Winter closures have
been occurring for several years
at the University."
