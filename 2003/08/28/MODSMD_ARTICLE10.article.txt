## Transitions are inevitable, even for those who stay put 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The end of the summer is about say
ing goodbye. In the next few weeks,
the Stanford Class of 2007 will be
waving tearful farewells to their childhood
friends, exclaiming how starting college at
the end of September is a horrible punish
ment while the Cardinal upperclassmen
who know better will be curling up for an
other three weeks of sleep and home
cooked meals.
The transition that people in the work
ing world presumably experience with the
arrival of Jan. 1, we students experience in
September as the new academic vear be
gins. Each September brings a time of new
possibilities, and during the fleeting hours
we have between the end of vacation and
the beginning of classes — most of which is
spent standing in line at the bookstore —
we think brieflv about what we hope to ac
complish in the next year.
For me, this summer is about the end of
my undergraduate experience at Stan
ford. And it's about saying goodbye to the
Stanford I knew.
Although I graduated in June 2002, the
past year has been a transitional one. I
didn't expect it to be: So many people stick
around the Farm that I didn't anticipate
anything would change other than pursu
ing a new degree and living in Escondido
Village.
But then some of mv friends moved

away, started paying utilities and got "real"
jobs where thev were worried about med
ical and dental coverage. December rolled
around and my four-year college room
mate asked me to be her maid of honor for
her summer wedding. In June, new grad
uates took pictures with their families and I
was thinking, "This isn't happening. I just
graduated!"
Probably most frightening thing is that
my class doesn't have the last column in the
Class Notes section of Stanford magazine
anymore, and it's going to keep moving
closer to the front with each passing year.
Just when I came to terms with this, I
found myself at a party, re-introduced to a
student I knew but couldn't place. When I
asked him how we had met, I was expect
ing to hear that he once visited someone
who had lived next door to me junior year
or some other degree-of-separation an
swer.
Instead, he sheepishly said, "You were
my Bio TA, and I didn't come to section too
often."
Wow, did I feel old.
The .American novelist Thomas Wolfe
wrote that we can't go home again, but who
knew that I could stay put and Stanford
would change without even warning me?
When I first arrived on campus, the
AMC Mercado had just opened (a student
ticket was $5.50). Condoleezza Rice was
our provost and not our national security
adviser. Everyone from home kept asking
me if I had met Chelsea vet. The monikers

"Bing Wing" and "FroSoCo hadn t been
coined. An important plotline in Gaieties
my freshman year was the departure of the
Phi Delts. We had just gone to the Final
Four in men's basketball.
It doesn't take Bob Dy lan to realize that
Stanford is a-changin'. When I was a tour
guide, we used to say that there are four
seasons on the Farm: fall, winter, spring
and construction. And now it's time for
me to dust off that bike helmet and fully
delve into graduate school.
But along with all this change, we have
an invaluable constant: The Daily, which
has been documenting news at Stanford
and how national and global news affects
Stanford since the University's inception.
Being a part of the paper has been an in
describable experience, mostly due to the
students who — between classes and their
myriad other obligations — are in the
newsroom for at least 12 hours a day, five
days a week pulling all the elements of the
paper together.
I first arrived at The Daily six volumes
ago to copy edit a guest column, and ob
serving the paper and the staff for the last
three years has been a telling experience.
Despite the arrival of a new academic
year each fall, the departure of seniors
with graduation each spring and trips
abroad for many juniors. The Daily has
always reached newsstands and dining
halls. Professors have continued to ask
students to put the crossword awav dur
ing lecture. Letters to the editor have per

sistently arrived in the opinions depart
ment's inbox.
And, after my experience this summer,
I know that will continue indefinitely be
cause the dedication writers and editors
have to The Daily is unlike anything I have
seen in my time at Stanford. The Sports de
partment bleeds Cardinal red. the News
department's coverage of kev campus is
sues is uncannily insightful and the editori
als offer us a chance to read about contro
versial topics ranging from changes in cam
pus policy to the international policy deci
sions that are shaping the world in which
our generation has been raised.
In the middle of the chaotic life at Stan
ford, The Daily provides a comforting and
invaluable link to campus life. I hope you
have enjoved The Weekly and I look for
ward to reading The Daily with you, the
Stanford community, for many years to
come.
