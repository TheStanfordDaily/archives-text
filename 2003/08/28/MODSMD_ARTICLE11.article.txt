# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Puzzled by too many options 
### BRENDAN MARTEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I wasn't president of the stu
dent body my senior year. I
didn't play in Carnegie Hall the
summer after ninth grade. I
wasn't captain of the basketball
team or a record-breaking all
star community service volun
teer. I had a pretty low-key, run
of-the-mill high school existence.
I was a member of the political
debate club. I did community
service here and there. But that
was about it.
At the time, my friends and I
felt free to label all those who
were extracurricularly ambitious
as "activities whores." In disbe
lief, we noted how they partici
pated in seemingly frivolous or
ganizations, sports and other
"productive" uses of their time.
We simply didn't understand
them and their cheery attitudes.
Who'd want to do all that when

you could sit at home doing
nothing like we did?
You might be wondering how
I got into Stanford. That's a
question that only Robin Mamlet
could answer. But I can assure
you, she didn't sign off on my ad
mission because of my "active
past" — or, for that matter, my
"future-activity potential." But
little did Mamlet know that once
I stepped foot on campus, I
planned take the activities circuit
by storm.
By the time high school grad
uation rolled around, I felt
shortchanged, like I had missed
out on what it meant to be a col
lege-obsessed, brown-nosing
young adult. Not unlike the bar
rage of regrets — and subse
quent Porsche purchases — that
a 50-year-old dad encounters
during his mid-life crisis, the sec
ond thoughts I had about the
quality and quantity of my activi
ty involvement led to a "young

life crisis."
Why didn't I fulfill this unex
plained urge during high
school? In retrospect, that would
have been much easier. After all,
I had a lot more free time thanks
to the disturbingly un-academic

nature of high school. If any
thing, you'd think I would have
at least acted out fear of the
dreaded "small envelope."
Months before I even due to
arrive tor freshman orientation,
1 began to debate what "well

rounded" list of things I should
do. In a moment — okay, a quar
ter or two — of temporary insan
ity, I decided to join the ASSU,
the mock trial team, the model

UN team, the newspaper, the
yearbook, the track and field
team, a couple community ser
vice clubs and take up classical vi
olin.
Note that I'd never done any
of these activities before in my
life. But that wasn't really a prob
lem, right? I was going to be a
chemical engineering and eco
nomics double major. I was de
bating whether it would be med
ical school or law school after my
college years. I'd just gotten into
Stanford and I had places to go.
And besides, I was on top of
things. For example, I knew that
not just any guy could go and join
the track team. If I wanted in, I

needed to be able to run fast. So, I
grabbed a stopwatch and cruised
on down to the local community
college track. Armed with a list of
times from the most recent Stan
ford track meet, all I needed to do
was time my attempts at various
distances. Then I'd see how I
measured up in comparison to ac
tual athletes and determine how
much work I had before me. I
soon found that I needed to shave
that annoying 10 seconds off my
100 meter dash — a race that
should take a good runner only
about 10 or 11 seconds to com
plete. It was no less disconcerting
to find that running for longer
than five minutes made me feel
like vomiting.
As I arrived at Stanford, the
disappointments only came
faster. I soon realized that I had
neither the time, nor talent nor

sanity to pursue all of my objec
tives. But hey, just because I
couldn't do all of my planned ac
tivities didn't mean that I
couldn't do some of them. While
I didn't accomplish everything I
had hoped for, I ended up with a
respectable list of responsibili
ties. I stuck with the mock trial
team, the newspaper and a once
a-week tutoring job at the local
elementary school.
Finally, I realized what every
one else undoubtedly had al
ready taken to heart in high
school. While "being busy" looks
good in the daybook, you can't
look at your life from the per
spective of Filling a schedule.
More importantly, I discovered
that extracurricular activities can
be extremely enjoyable and re
warding.
Just from my three little areas

of interest at Stanford, I've had
some of the best times of my col
lege career and come in contact
with dozens of people that I oth
erwise never would have met —
let alone know in any meaning
ful capacity.
While I'm a late-blooming ac
tivities whore, I'm a whore to this
day — albeit in moderation. And
all of my past high school high
mindedness aside, I'm damn
proud of it.
