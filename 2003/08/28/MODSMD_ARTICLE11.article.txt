# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Puzzled by too many options 
### BRENDAN MARTEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
I wasn't president of the stu
dent body my senior year. I
didn't play in Carnegie Hall the
summer after ninth grade. I
wasn't captain of the basketball
team or a record-breaking all
star community service volun
teer. I had a pretty low-key, run
of-the-mill high school existence.
I was a member of the political
debate club. I did community
service here and there. But that
was about it.
At the time, my friends and I
felt free to label all those who
were extracurricularly ambitious
as "activities whores." In disbe
lief, we noted how they partici
pated in seemingly frivolous or
ganizations, sports and other
"productive" uses of their time.
We simply didn't understand
them and their cheery attitudes.
Who'd want to do all that when

you could sit at home doing
nothing like we did?
You might be wondering how
I got into Stanford. That's a
question that only Robin Mamlet
could answer. But I can assure
you, she didn't sign off on my ad
mission because of my "active
past" — or, for that matter, my
"future-activity potential." But
little did Mamlet know that once
I stepped foot on campus, I
planned take the activities circuit
by storm.
By the time high school grad
uation rolled around, I felt
shortchanged, like I had missed
out on what it meant to be a col
lege-obsessed, brown-nosing
young adult. Not unlike the bar
rage of regrets — and subse
quent Porsche purchases — that
a 50-year-old dad encounters
during his mid-life crisis, the sec
ond thoughts I had about the
quality and quantity of my activi
ty involvement led to a "young

life crisis."
Why didn't I fulfill this unex
plained urge during high
school? In retrospect, that would
have been much easier. After all,
I had a lot more free time thanks
to the disturbingly un-academic

nature of high school. If any
thing, you'd think I would have
at least acted out fear of the
dreaded "small envelope."
Months before I even due to
arrive tor freshman orientation,
1 began to debate what "well

rounded" list of things I should
do. In a moment — okay, a quar
ter or two — of temporary insan
ity, I decided to join the ASSU,
the mock trial team, the model
