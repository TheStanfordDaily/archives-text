Diverse viewpoints need to be
heard at Stanford
Kudos to Andy Clavin! His
behavior and tactics may have
been reprehensible, but he has
apologized, and hopefully, the
furor concerning his secret
taping, etc., will die down, and
he will be able to resume his life
as a "rising senior." However,
the larger issue is whether di
verse viewpoints are accepted
at Stanford, and Clavin's origi
nal column deserves praise for
bringing that issue to the fore
front â€” against obvious faculty
hostility. That courage bodes
well for Clavin's chances of be
coming a more mature, effec
tive conservative.
Consider a microcosm of the
left-right debate: the Arab-Israeli
conflict, and its chief proponent
on campus, Professor Joel
Beinin. Are diverse points of
view tolerated? Dr. Beinin may
carry a Palestinian flag around,
just as I may state that Palestini
ans and their supporters pose an
existential threat to Israel, and
that Palestinians do not deserve a
state until they moderate their
views.
However, specific concerns
include Beinin's role in various
Jewish studies programs (can
someone dislike Beinin and still
complete a Jewish studies
major at Stanford?); the lack of
an effective faculty counter
weight to Beinin to support
those students to whom Israel's
existence is central in their
lives; and the questions about
the tenure process itself.
Did Beinin use his activism
to get tenure? Can someone
be pro-Israel and still work at
Columbia or Stanford? To be
flip, how are the sausages
made (never mind that I am
kosher)?
More to the point, it continues
to grate on me that the Middle
East Studies Association, of
which Beinin is a past president,
tried to intervene on behalf of
Professor Al-Arian in Tampa, the
head of Islamic Jihad in the Unit
ed States before his arrest last
year. Further, it bothers me that
many Islamic scholars, whose
doctorates were written about
the Mamelukes or Byzantines,
focus their professional energies
on the Arab-Israeli conflict, on
which many have no real profes
sorial credentials. Who organizes
and pays for these professional
activists?
Each question brings up more
questions. Hopefully, these will
be asked respectfully at the next
faculty teach-in.
