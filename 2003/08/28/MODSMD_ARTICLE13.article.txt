# PEDANTIC POETICS
## Renaming history will not eradicate past transgressions 
### ILYA BEYLIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Intellectuals have their own vo
cabulary. Instead of talking about
beers and cars like common louts,
they discuss national teleologies
and phalologocentric literature.
Students leaving graduate level
lectures may feel like they've just
been force-fed barrels of starch.
The stuff is heavy and not very ex
citing. However, academic lan
guage does add something to ver
nacular; English is notorious for
having far too few cusswords and
the academics add a rather flavor
ful selection.
An experienced history profes
sor may load more spite and dis
dain into words like "fascist,"
"bigot" and "imperialist" than the
crudest biker-thug can fit into
"cuntrag." Recently, the Palo Alto
branch of the Christian Temper
ance Union took issue with this es
oteric breed of filth. Understaffed,
the union sought outside help and
contracted an otherwise indigent
Daily columnist. What follows is a
message of that campaign, not
necessarily supported by the Daily
or this author.
Consider the word "imperial
ism" for instance. Certainly it
sounds like an unhappy system —
a condition of organized oppres
sion of the weak for the benefit of
the strong. It reminds the listener
of Roman galley slaves, blood
drenched conquistadors and mal
nourished miners in Zaire. As im
ages, these are at least as viscerally
unappealing as a steaming pile of
shit.
Yet for all its ugliness, defeca
tion is natural and necessary. If

society was implemented accord
ing to Old Dirty Bastard's plan of
sewing up our sphincters and
feeding us and feeding us, there
would be significantly less feces.
But how long could a nation
defer the unique pleasures of re
lease and bathroom reading?
ODB, a.k.a. Big Baby Jesus,
a.k.a. Dirt McGirk, and fellow
purists ignore the unconquerable
instincts of humanity — our evil
and our ugliness. The human
cannot be described without ref
erence to sin.
America, like every other na
tion, has many sins both past and
present. Claims of our democra
tic heritage and national good
will lie by omission; our history
and image have been smeared
with violence and brutality. It's
our relationship to the realities
of force and power that define us
to ourselves, to each other and to
foreigners.
Imperialism consists of two ex
periences: the emperor's and the
oppressed. For the oppressed, the
subjugation precludes her self-de
termination, repressing self-ex
pression. For the emperor, it's just
the opposite, only as master can
the human express his social fan
tasy of power and control.
Those who refuse to acknowl
edge their personal responsibility
for the sins of history and society
— sins they inherited as depen
dent participants — have not fully
realized themselves.
Criticism too often spares the
critic; too few on the American
Left acknowledge how they bene
fit from imperialism. If not for
World War II and the ensuing ex
tension of American power as

global reconstructor, protector
and bully, life in America would
not be nearly as comfortable as it is
today. Postwar affluence more
than coincided with radically ex
panded influence abroad. If the
U.S. were to curtail its military
spending and revert to isolation
ism, Americans would lose much
more as consumers than they
would save as taxpayers.
Poor economics is the lesser of
the self-excusing critic's failures.
Critics of imperialism deny their
civic complicity as well as their
personal will to power. As sympa
thetic benefactors, they combine
the profit of the master with the
righteousness of the victim, elud
ing their own guilt. Though the
leftist intellectual provides the
most incisive critiques of power
and society, lacking personal con
fession such critiques are morally
discredited by their own
hypocrisy.
Failing to confess their fantasy
of power even to themselves, the
progressive Left develops pro
grams for the future based on a
faith in the plasticity of man and
his infinite perfectibility. Pro
grams based on education and re
habilitation either ignore the
pleasure of expression or deny
the drive to dominance. As such
they invite dismissal as Utopian.
If critics on the Left fail to ac
knowledge themselves as mas
ters, apologists on the Right fail
to acknowledge anything at all.
Only the utterly blind can con
fuse a soldier fora missionary.
While America did play an indis
putably positive role defeating
the Axis powers in World War II
— rebuilding Europe and Japan,

resisting Communist totalitarian
ism and helping to fight global
poverty and plagues — America
has also sponsored assassina
tions, launched invasions and
propped up unpopular dictators.
Conservatives are quick to
condemn human sympathy as
cultural-relativism, abusing the
same principals of respect for
human life and self-determina
tion on which they base their in
terventions.
Grenada, Nicaragua, Viet
nam, these were not invasions
that respected popular sover
eignty or the basic rights of hu
mans to their property and lives.
Nor did these acts encourage in
ternational faith in the Ameri
can's goodwill. Their omission
from popular history disillusions,
disgusts and alienates the curi
ous, unnecessarily pitting the pa
triot against the intellectual.
The jingoist Right draws its le
gitimacy from the Holocaust
while the hippie Left bases its
criticism on Vietnam. Both have
historical validity, but fail the test
of completeness. Foreign inter
vention is not always good —
like it was when we entered
World War II — nor always bad
like it was when we invaded Viet
nam. The effort of American his
torians should be to undermine
these sorts of myths and thought
fully reconcile the good and bad;
to write history in a confessional
tone, admitting sin but not with
out pride.

defer the unique pleasures of re
lease and bathroom reading?
ODB, a.k.a. Big Baby Jesus,
a.k.a. Dirt McGirk, and fellow
purists ignore the unconquerable
instincts of humanity — our evil
and our ugliness. The human
cannot be described without ref
erence to sin.
America, like every other na
tion, has many sins both past and
present. Claims of our democra
tic heritage and national good
will lie by omission; our history
and image have been smeared
with violence and brutality. It's
our relationship to the realities
of force and power that define us
to ourselves, to each other and to
foreigners.
Imperialism consists of two ex
periences: the emperor's and the
oppressed. For the oppressed, the
subjugation precludes her self-de
termination, repressing self-ex
pression. For the emperor, it's just
the opposite, only as master can
the human express his social fan
tasy of power and control.
Those who refuse to acknowl
edge their personal responsibility
for the sins of history and society
— sins they inherited as depen
dent participants — have not fully
realized themselves.
Criticism too often spares the
critic; too few on the American
Left acknowledge how they bene
fit from imperialism. If not for
World War II and the ensuing ex
tension of American power as

global reconstructor, protector
and bully, life in America would
not be nearly as comfortable as it is
today. Postwar affluence more
than coincided with radically ex
panded influence abroad. If the
U.S. were to curtail its military
spending and revert to isolation
ism, Americans would lose much
more as consumers than they
would save as taxpayers.
Poor economics is the lesser of
the self-excusing critic's failures.
Critics of imperialism deny their
civic complicity as well as their
personal will to power. As sympa
thetic benefactors, they combine
the profit of the master with the
righteousness of the victim, elud
ing their own guilt. Though the
leftist intellectual provides the
most incisive critiques of power
and society, lacking personal con
fession such critiques are morally
discredited by their own
hypocrisy.
Failing to confess their fantasy
of power even to themselves, the
progressive Left develops pro
grams for the future based on a
faith in the plasticity of man and
his infinite perfectibility. Pro
grams based on education and re
habilitation either ignore the
pleasure of expression or deny
the drive to dominance. As such
they invite dismissal as Utopian.
If critics on the Left fail to ac
knowledge themselves as mas
ters, apologists on the Right fail
to acknowledge anything at all.
Only the utterly blind can con
fuse a soldier fora missionary.
While America did play an indis
putably positive role defeating
the Axis powers in World War II
— rebuilding Europe and Japan,

resisting Communist totalitarian
ism and helping to fight global
poverty and plagues — America
has also sponsored assassina
tions, launched invasions and
propped up unpopular dictators.
Conservatives are quick to
condemn human sympathy as
cultural-relativism, abusing the
same principals of respect for
human life and self-determina
tion on which they base their in
terventions.
Grenada, Nicaragua, Viet
nam, these were not invasions
that respected popular sover
eignty or the basic rights of hu
mans to their property and lives.
Nor did these acts encourage in
ternational faith in the Ameri
can's goodwill. Their omission
from popular history disillusions,
disgusts and alienates the curi
ous, unnecessarily pitting the pa
triot against the intellectual.
The jingoist Right draws its le
gitimacy from the Holocaust
while the hippie Left bases its
criticism on Vietnam. Both have
historical validity, but fail the test
of completeness. Foreign inter
vention is not always good —
like it was when we entered
World War II — nor always bad
like it was when we invaded Viet
nam. The effort of American his
torians should be to undermine
these sorts of myths and thought
fully reconcile the good and bad;
to write history in a confessional
tone, admitting sin but not with
out pride.

Intellectuals have their own vo
cabulary. Instead of talking about
beers and cars like common louts,
they discuss national teleologies
and phalologocentric literature.
Students leaving graduate level
lectures may feel like they've just
been force-fed barrels of starch.
The stuff is heavy and not very ex
citing. However, academic lan
guage does add something to ver
nacular; English is notorious for
having far too few cusswords and
the academics add a rather flavor
ful selection.
An experienced history profes
sor may load more spite and dis
dain into words like "fascist,"
"bigot" and "imperialist" than the
crudest biker-thug can fit into
"cuntrag." Recently, the Palo Alto
branch of the Christian Temper
ance Union took issue with this es
oteric breed of filth. Understaffed,
the union sought outside help and
contracted an otherwise indigent
Daily columnist. What follows is a
message of that campaign, not
necessarily supported by the Daily
or this author.
Consider the word "imperial
ism" for instance. Certainly it
sounds like an unhappy system —
a condition of organized oppres
sion of the weak for the benefit of
the strong. It reminds the listener
of Roman galley slaves, blood
drenched conquistadors and mal
nourished miners in Zaire. As im
ages, these are at least as viscerally
unappealing as a steaming pile of
shit.
Yet for all its ugliness, defeca
tion is natural and necessary. If

society was implemented accord
ing to Old Dirty Bastard's plan of
sewing up our sphincters and
feeding us and feeding us, there
would be significantly less feces.
