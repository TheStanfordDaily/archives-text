# Cardinal-free Slam
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford graduates had a
rough going during the first
round of the 2003 U.S. Open in
Flushing Meadows, N.Y., as only
Laura Granville managed to sur
vive the opening two days of com
petition.
Amber Liu, the defending
NCAA champion who is contem
plating a return to the Farm for
her sophomore campaign, was
looking to rebound from a 6-1, 6-
1 loss to Kim Clijsters that
knocked her from the Bank of the
West Classic at earlier this month.
Since winning the women's
NCAA singles title and being
named ITA Women's National
Player of the Year, Liu has com
peted in a variety of competitions,
including two matches as a mem
ber of the ITA-USA All-Star
Team. She had stressed that she
would not announce her decision
until she participated in the pres
tigious U.S. Open.
But in an unfortunate twist of
fate for Liu, she again drew the
top-seeded Belgian, who is cur
rently the top player in the world
and overpowering a women's ten
nis tour that has slithered free
from the grip of the Williams sis
ters. This time the result was less
lopsided, but Clijsters, behind
four breaks of serve, cruised into
the second round, 6-2, 6-3. Liu
seemed unfazed by the pressure
of her first Grand Slam appear
ance as she jumped to a 2-0 first
set lead by breaking Clijsters'
powerful serve. The Belgian
proved why she is No. 1 in the
world, however, in the next six
games and used a 113 mile per
hour serve to take the set.
Laura Granville, on the other
hand, was able to knock off Ansley

Cargill, 6-4, 6-0, behind a high
first-serve percentage of 60 per
cent and five breaks of serve.
Unfortunately for Granville,
though, Clijsters was next on the
docket, and the top seed sent the
former Cardinal star and two
time NCAA champion packing
with a 6-1,6-1 rout. Clijsters next
faces Svetlana Kuznetsova, a
Russian seeded 27th.
The former college standout
was looking to advance past the
second round for the first time in
five chances, but the level of com
petition dictated otherwise. Un
like Liu, though, Granville's stay
at the USTA National Tennis
Center is not yet finished. She will
compete in the doubles draw with
American Alexandra Stevenson.
They will face Iva Majoli of Croat
ia and Marta Marrero of Spain
today.
Other Stanford entrants in
cluded Marissa Irvin and
Gabriela Lastra. Irvin dropped a
tough tiebreaker in the second set
of a 6-2, 7-6 (5) loss to Martina
Sucha, while Lastra was eliminat
ed by the 14th-seeded Amanda
Coetzer, 6-0, 6-2. Coetzer also
beat Barbara Schett — 3-6,7-5,6-
2 — to advance to the third
round, while Sucha will square off
against sixth-seeded Jennifer
Capriati in her third-round
match today.
Irvin, who was playing in her
fifth U.S.Open, was looking to ad
vance to the second round for the
first time since 2000. Lastra
earned a spot in the Grand Slam
by beating Nuria Llagostera Vives
of Spain, 6-2, 6-2, in qualifying.
She had debuted at the Open in
2002 but dropped a first-round
qualifying match and did not ad
vance to the main draw.
The story of the tournament
thus far has been Maria Kirilenko,

a 16-year old, 105-pound qualifi
er from Russia who has advanced
to the third round. The 2002 U.S.
Open junior girls champion, Kir
ilenko has been training with for
mer men's superstar Yevgeny
Kafelnikov. After downing Amer
ican Theresa Logar, 6-4, 6-2, in

her opening round contest, she
fought through exhaustion to a 3-
6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 win over Anca
Barna in the second round. A
third round victory would be no
small feat, however, as Kirilenko
is slated to face fifth-seeded
Amelie Mauresmo.

Amber Liu, who finished her freshman year at Stanford as the NCAA sin
gles champion, must now contemplate a return to school versus a profes
sional career after her first-round loss at the U.S. Open.
