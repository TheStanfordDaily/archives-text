# College football elite battle to strike it rich
## 
### 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) —
College football returned to the
American sporting landscape
Saturday night complete with all
the pageantry and history fans
crave.
As Kansas State put a 42-28
hurting on California, we saw
one set of athlete-students
knocking heads with another.
We saw some players who've yet
to even sit fora class at their
school strap it up and knock
heads for good old State U. We
saw fans paint their faces, cheer
leaders click off their backflips

and bands shake their tubas.
Bettors from coast to coast no
doubt frantically ruffled through
their phonebooks for their local
wiseguy, thrilled that football was
finally back. Why else would fans
in a North Kingstown, R. 1.,
sports hangout be rooting for K-
State to run up the score and
cover a three-touchdown
spread? ESPN, of course, broad
cast this made-for-TV touch of
autumn at a time when most
sports fans focused on the Little
League World Series.
But most of all, the kickofF of

college football marks the start of
the heated race for millions of
dollars. Make that an $89.9-mil
lion race to be exact. That's the
pot of gold that the major bowls
and ABC-TV have combined to
dangle in front of America's pre
mier football colleges.
It's a chase that some say has
spiraled out of control. Schools
pour millions into programs that
play a dangerous game of who
can-top-who as Oklahoma builds
a $10-million weight facility and
Texas goes for $15 million.
Coaches jump from one school

to another, often to escape the
cheating and rule-bending they
previously oversaw. And to reap
richer contracts, of course.
The BCS's own media guide
draws out a sample revenue dis
tribution for the $89.9 million.
The two schools that qualify for
the BCS championship game in
the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 both
receive $13,886,666. The
schools picked for the Fiesta and
Orange bowls pocket the same
amount. The Rose Bowl pays its
teams through a separate con
tractual arrangement.
Since the BCS debuted in
1998, the participants in the four
major bowls have all come from
six conferences: the ACC, Big
East, Big Ten, Big Twelve, Pac
-10 or SEC. Any change in that
trend would account for the
biggest upset of the college foot
ball season. .Allowing fora sce
nario in which Miami and Vir
ginia Tech play in a BCS bowl,
the Big East could earn as much
as $17,015,555 of this year's
$89.9 million pot. Add another
$4 million or so that Big East
schools can earn through the
conference's tie-ins with four
other minor bowls and it's easy to
see what college football is truly
all about these days.
Conferences that don't land a
school in a BCS bowl — such as
the Mountain West, Conference
USA and the Western Athletic —
take home just $1 million. Some
observers call that BCS hush
money, but the weak sisters
aren't happy. At their urging, the
House Judiciary Committee
holds a hearing next week on
whether the BCS violates an
titrust laws by limiting opportu
nities of the schools outside the
BCS to earn the sport's available
millions.
Because that's what college
football has become. Winning is
certainly the goal, but cashing
larger and larger checks is what
really matters. If you can't pay
the bills, the multimillion-dollar
losses a football program can roll
up are staggering. So as you turn
on the TV and see college foot
ball in August and games on
Tuesday and Thursday and Fri
day nights, realize that TV
money is all-powerful. And when
Miami plays BC and Tennessee
battles Alabama, realize that the
stakes for winning and jockeying
for the premier bowls have never
been higher.
Let the $89.9-million race
begin.
