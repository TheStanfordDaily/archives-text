# College football elite battle to strike it rich

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) â€”
College football returned to the
American sporting landscape
Saturday night complete with all
the pageantry and history fans
crave.
As Kansas State put a 42-28
hurting on California, we saw
one set of athlete-students
knocking heads with another.
We saw some players who've yet
to even sit fora class at their
school strap it up and knock
heads for good old State U. We
saw fans paint their faces, cheer
leaders click off their backflips

and bands shake their tubas.
Bettors from coast to coast no
doubt frantically ruffled through
their phonebooks for their local
wiseguy, thrilled that football was
finally back. Why else would fans
in a North Kingstown, R. 1.,
sports hangout be rooting for K-
State to run up the score and
cover a three-touchdown
spread? ESPN, of course, broad
cast this made-for-TV touch of
autumn at a time when most
sports fans focused on the Little
League World Series.
But most of all, the kickofF of

college football marks the start of
the heated race for millions of
dollars. Make that an $89.9-mil
lion race to be exact. That's the
pot of gold that the major bowls
and ABC-TV have combined to
dangle in front of America's pre
mier football colleges.
It's a chase that some say has
spiraled out of control. Schools
pour millions into programs that
play a dangerous game of who
can-top-who as Oklahoma builds
a $10-million weight facility and
Texas goes for $15 million.
Coaches jump from one school

to another, often to escape the
cheating and rule-bending they
previously oversaw. And to reap
richer contracts, of course.
The BCS's own media guide
draws out a sample revenue dis
tribution for the $89.9 million.
The two schools that qualify for
the BCS championship game in
the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 both
receive $13,886,666. The
schools picked for the Fiesta and
Orange bowls pocket the same
amount. The Rose Bowl pays its
