### ERICA O'YOUNG EDITORIAL STAFF 
The past couple years have been a huge
sink-or-swim trial for some of music's hottest
stars. As hip hop went pop and pop desperate
ly tried to go hip hop, music stars of the nineties
struggled to redefine their image and find a se
cure niche in the changing waters of the music
world. .All across the nation, the word among
the record labels was clear — Pop is out. Urban

is m.
The latest releases from pop's million-dollar
names attested to that. Britney Spears' "Brit
ney'" came out in 2001 with funky, half-spoken,
half-sung edgy vocals, blazing onto the scene
with the very sexy, Neptunes-produced "Slave
For You." Unfortunately, what could have
been a huge transporter for America's number
one teeny bopper over the pop-urban bridge
burned to the ground, as Spears alienated her
stronghold teen audience and failed to seduce

a new one from the club-hopping hip hop
genre. "Britney" sold three-quarter million in
its opening week, much less than the 1.3 million
sales mark Spears scored tn 2000 with "Oops! I
Did It .Again." With the release of snicker-in
ducing acting debut "Crossroads," Spears
track recorded inspired bits of the media world
to wonder if the young diva's star was finally
starting to tall. .After a publicity blitz of the

single "like I Love You" at die 2002 MTV'
Video Music Awards, Timberlake's technically
skilled performances in the recording studio
and on the dance floor won him snowballing
credibility in the Riß circle. Billboard records
for Timberlake's followup singles "Rtxk Your

one of the icons of the pop decade, was hot on
the scent as well. .Aguilera's 2002 release
