# Pop stop: '90s stars scramble aboard urban train
## 
### ERICA O'YOUNG EDITORIAL STAFF 
The past couple years have been a huge
sink-or-swim trial for some of music's hottest
stars. As hip hop went pop and pop desperate
ly tried to go hip hop, music stars of the nineties
struggled to redefine their image and find a se
cure niche in the changing waters of the music
world. .All across the nation, the word among
the record labels was clear — Pop is out. Urban

is m.
The latest releases from pop's million-dollar
names attested to that. Britney Spears' "Brit
ney'" came out in 2001 with funky, half-spoken,
half-sung edgy vocals, blazing onto the scene
with the very sexy, Neptunes-produced "Slave
For You." Unfortunately, what could have
been a huge transporter for America's number
one teeny bopper over the pop-urban bridge
burned to the ground, as Spears alienated her
stronghold teen audience and failed to seduce

a new one from the club-hopping hip hop
genre. "Britney" sold three-quarter million in
its opening week, much less than the 1.3 million
sales mark Spears scored tn 2000 with "Oops! I
Did It .Again." With the release of snicker-in
ducing acting debut "Crossroads," Spears
track recorded inspired bits of the media world
to wonder if the young diva's star was finally
starting to tall. .After a publicity blitz of the
'Dream Within a Dream" concert tour, a "Live
in Las Vegas" HBO show and DV D. corny Sat
urday Night Ijve appearances, heavyweight
Skechers and Pepsi endorsements. Spears an
nounced a temporarv retirement. Pepsi, disil
lusioned with mediocre Spears-induced rev
enues, replaced the former Mouseketeer with
Destiny's Child leading ladv Bevonce Knowles,
citing Knowles' wider-range appeal as the in
centive.
Cfose on Spears' heels was ex-bov friend and
reinvented Usher/Michael Jackson wannabe
Justin Timberlake— surprisingly one of the
most viable of the pop genre crossovers. Leav

with the selling stars of die hip hop world — in

single "like I Love You" at die 2002 MTV'

skilled performances in the recording studio
