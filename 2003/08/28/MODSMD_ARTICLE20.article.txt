# "Swimming Pool" spins a seductive tale
## 
### ROBERTO PRIETO 
Francois Ozon's "Swimming
Pool" is one of those movies that
you want to love whether or not it
deserves to be. Although it fails to
live up to its potential of becom
ing a cult classic, it is ultimately an
entertaining and fascinating psy
chological study into the lives of
two strong female characters.
Sarah Morton (Charlotte
Rampling) is a rigid British mys
tery writer who feels stifled by her

life in London. She accepts her
publisher's advice of going to his
summer home in the South of
France in order to get inspiration
for her next novel. Her new
found peace and quiet is quickly
interrupted by the unannounced
arrival of her publisher's daugh
ter Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), a
Lolita-esque nvmphet who has
decided to take a break from
work fora little rest and relax
ation. Sarah does not take this in
terruption very well, especially

when Julie begins to bring home
a string of particularly unattrac
tive men to the house in order to
satisfy her sexual impulses. Julie's

charm and vulnerability eventu
ally win Sarah over and the two
begin an unlikely friendship,
which will make them partners in
crime when one of Julie's love af
fairs goes awry.
The film doesn't have a verv
complex plotline, but it makes up
for it by delving into a deep and
rich character studv of the two
leads. When Sarah first moves
into the summer home, we quiet-

ly explore the house with her, tak
ing in her new environment and
her new life. The homoerotic ten
sion between Sarah and Julie be
fore they become friends is palpa
ble, as is the unspoken admira
tion Sarah has of Julie's uninhib
ited and unapologetic youthful
sexuality. Those who are drawn
to the film by Sagnier's beautiful
body on the film's poster get plen
ty more of her luscious naked
body throughout the film.
The twist at the end of the film
follows in the footsteps of Shya
malan's "The Sixth Sense" and
Amenabar's "The Others." The
problem with twists is that they're
not always the best thing fora
film. For one, they are often anti
climactic, since the script seems
to rely mainly on this device to
justify the lack of action in the
story. This handicap can only be
made up if the characters are
brought to life in a realistic and
vibrant way, which "Swimming
Pool" does. The twist is Clevel
and original, leaving the audi
ence to their own devices to make
sense of the story and the true in

tentions of the characters. Is Julie
really who she says she is? Or is
Julie perhaps Sarah's alter ego?
We're left wondering what is real
and what isn't. But the twist is
merely the icing on the cake. It
should not detract from the real
value of the film, which is two

very good roles for two very dy
namic and charismatic actors.
Good storytelling often in
volves connecting to the charac
ters' flaws and emotions. "Swim
ming Pool" manages to deliver in
this respect, even if the story itself
is ultimately flawed.
