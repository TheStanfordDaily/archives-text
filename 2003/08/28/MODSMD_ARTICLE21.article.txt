"A Nightmare on Elm Street"
and "Wes Craven's New Nightmare"
Don't get me wrong the climactic battle in "Freddy vs.
Jason" is truly awe-inspiring in its gory magnificence, and the
simple fact that the film exists is enough to renew my faith in
the humanity. But horror fans who want a genuinely creepy
and creative double feature are better off grabbing writer/di
rector Wes Craven's clever original, "A Nightmare on Elm
Street" (1984), and his follow-up (he had little to do with the
intervening sequels), "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994).
Both films star Heather Langenkamp as a young woman
who can't convince anyone that she's being terrorized by
Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), the grinning, malevolent
demon we've come to know and love. The plot of the initial
"Nightmare" is by now known to most viewers the friends of
Nancy Thompson (Langenkamp) are, one-by-one, being mur
dered in their sleep, and Nancy knows she'll soon be next....
However, the second- and third-hand retellings (spread
mainly through many redundant sequels) that we're familiar
with do little justice to the sympathy of the film's characters,
the resourcefulness of its heroine and its ever-escalating sense
of surreal paranoia.
Even better is "New Nightmare", in which Langenkamp
plays herself, or a version of herself, anyway. She's haunted
by visions of Freddy, even though she knows he's "just" a
character in a film. Meanwhile, Craven (playing himself) is
starting to have nightmares, spurring him to work on a new
screenplay (which is, of course, the script for the movie that
you're watching).
"New Nightmare," like the original, suffers from uneven
dialogue and performances, and it has a few more in-jokes
than necessary, but it also unflinchingly and intelligendy
grapples with the question of how the act of storytelling
shapes and gives meaning to our lives, for better and for
worse. A key moment comes when Langenkamp accepts her
"role" and plunges into Freddy's realm, finally ready to con
front him. Follow her lead, and discover the haunting and
darkly beautiful world that awaits.
