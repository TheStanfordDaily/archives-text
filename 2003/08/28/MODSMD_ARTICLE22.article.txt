# Local tea cafe serves up pearls of heaven

The first rime I had "boba nai ca," it was served ele
gandy to me in a tall, ornate wine glass on the 20th floor
of Taiwan's most expensive restaurant, a very special
treat following an elaborate dinner that my wealthy
uncle had bestowed upon his awestruck ten-year-old
niece.
The next time I tasted the exotic Asian beverage was
seven years later at a tea shop called Cafe Verde — in
Mountain View, California. It was brought out in a plas
tic to-go cup by a frazzled, apron-wearing Chinese wait
ress who hastily placed the drink on the counter, mo
tioned to me to claim it, and rushed back to attend to the
long line of patrons behind me all eagerly awaiting the
appearance of their own plastic cup of "pearl tea.' My
drink costa total of $3.50, plus the few coins I dropped
in a cup placed unabashedly in front of a rackety cash
register with a taped sign reading, "TIPS — for Thank
You."
In the Palo Alto area, Cafe Verde was the first of an
epidemic of "pearl tea shops" that descended upon the
nation in the next few years. .411 across the U.S., in shop
ping plazas, malls and restaurant areas, tea shops sprang
up overnight. With snowballing success and popularity,
they clustered around the greater metropolitan cities of
higher Asian-American density - Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, New York, Chicago, Houston and elsewhere.
Pearl tea, also known as "bubble tea" or "tapioca tea,"
is the latest Asian fad to hit major cities in the U.S. since
Pokemon. The beverage, popular in the Asian coun
tries, is a milky, sweet, flavored tea mixed with large,
chewy, "pearls" of tapioca, usually served with an extra
wide straw to enable the consumption of both tea and
tapioca in one mouthful. In Taiwan, tea shops have long
been a focal point of social life, but when Taipei shop
owner Liu Han-Chieh added tea with tapioca to his
menu, the concept of the pearl tea shop took off by the
hundreds in Taiwan.
Cafe Verde opened up tentatively as a small, incon
spicuous shop hidden among the clusters of Asian
restaurants and stores along Castro Street. Initially
known only among the older, Chinese-speaking popu
lation in Mountain View, the shop's popularity quickly
gained momentum when word reached younger Asian-

Americans — particularly students from the local Stan
ford University — and subsequently, fans outside the
Asian-American community.
Verde was soon joined by eager competitors. In
2000, Alive Cafe, followed by S Cafe & Bakery, opened
on University Avenue, catering to Stanford students
and University Avenue shoppers. In 2002, Black Pearl
Cafe appeared on the nearby California Avenue, luring
pearl tea fans with late night hours, large study tables
and an Xbox station. Back on Castro Street, directly
across from Verde, CyberCafe set up its own following
by offering a networked computer cluster.
Today, Cafe Verde is still the original in its area —
the pioneer and blueprint for the offshoots it inspired
with its original success. It has been reinvented and
Americanized, complete with custom-designed art-deco
furniture, wallpaper and decorations in a signature pas
tel green, yellow and blue color scheme. Its menu, once
handwritten in Chinese with scrawling Sharpie ink, is
now a proudly displayed custom-made panel above the
counter, with English translations featuring more fla
vors than a Starbucks coffee menu. Along with the
doors, windows and cups of the cafe, the menu bears a


Mountain View's Cafe Verde on Castro street offers a
haven for studying, relaxation, business and more to
local pearl tea fans.
