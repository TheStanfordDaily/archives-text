# Roxy on animal rights and dating: Bestiality is not best
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Your dog may be your best friend, but
take it from Roxy-sometimes it's best to "just
be friends." Having witnessed some kinky
man-on-dog action from guys who had de
cent chances of getting some tail elsewhere,
Roxy is letting the cat out of the bag: love
your pets, but don't love your pets.
It's a common tale, the lonely reject
turning to his dog for solace. But this is
not the typical case at Stanford. Though
there are some loners, some true intro
verts among the student population, most
people here are moderately well-adjusted
and have a healthy appreciation for both
their friends and their pets. Roxy ap
proves of pets: goldfish, fluffy kittens, ger
bils, even a good-tempered Labrador re
triever.
Pets are a great thing. Psychological
studies have shown that having a pet im
proves your longevity. Sitting there and
stroking your pussy adds years to your life.
Your pets can play a role in your sex life

as well. Stories of freak explosions involv
ing gerbils and anal intercourse aside,
there's something appealing in having a lit
tle furry animal crawl down the small of
your back. There are few better feelings
than waking up with a warm body at your
feet, especially if that warm body showers
you with unconditional love and accep
tance (clearly a better deal than your last
relationship). Roxy's never met a dog with
worse morning breath than her latest ex, so
as long as your liberal with the milkbones,
you need never fear the morning doggie
facial.
Let's be frank, watching a hot guy
French kiss his dog can be a turn-on. Don't
be prudish, a little experimentation is a
good thing. The problem is when you turn
to your pet before your significant other.
Even though Roxy's known guys who have
had deep conversations with their cats, the
trick is to remember that our people rela
tionships sometimes need to take prece
dence over our pets.
Oh, and while animal noises can make
fora fun change in the bedroom, better be

selective where and when you decide to
spring the request on a potential hook-up:
if you've gotten them prepped with some
fore-play first, you'll be much less likely to
freak them out than if you casually men
tion it in the middle of a conversation.
(This is true for most bedroom activity that
might be seen as freaky. Warm them up
first, or the effect is probably going to be a
cold shower.)
So what to do if you're an animal lover
and your mate does not seem cool with
your pet? Talk with them. If they hate ani
mals and you love them, then are they the
type of person you should be with at all?
Roxy has no problem having Fido in the
room, so long as he doesn't get in the way.
Lots of people are okay with pets and if
you're dedicated to yours it's a good idea to
find someone who's understanding of that.
And what to do if a pet is getting in the
way of your relationship?
First, determine what it is about the
pet that annoys you. Are you mad be
cause she takes more interest in curling
up with her cat than curling up with you?

Are you wigged out because he talks to his
hamster for hours but can't spend more
than 5 minutes on the phone with you?
Chances are this is about more than
his/her pet.
Second, if it's a specific behavior with the
pet that upsets you, figure out a way to
change it. A good swipe to the head or rear
with a rolled up newspaper works wonders
for house training puppies: Why not use it
on your misbehaving mate?
Third, if the situation is beyond your
control, seek outside help. Calling the local
branch of PETA might be a start if you're
concerned that animals are getting hurt by
his activities.
When faced with animal competition,
it's easy to lose hope. There's no way you'll
be as sympathetic as their beloved pet.
Roxy's advice: if she loves her pet that
much, you'd better learn to love her pet as
part of the package. If he kisses the dog
more than you and that's a problem, then
let it go.
In any case, when it's raining cats and
dogs, it's best to get out of the rain.
