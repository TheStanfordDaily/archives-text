S.WJV.T.
While this movie's rapid transitions from one crisis to
another make "S.W.A.T." mildly diverting, the pre
dictable plot, chemistry-less characters and dull dialogue
make it an unexciting movie-going experience.
"S.W.A.T." basically consists of a constant barrage of
bullets flying, cars crashing and things blowing up. But
the movie lacks suspense — from the beginning we know
who will be up to no good — while these violent displays
are eye-catching, the movie sags between the action
scenes. Luckily, viewers needn't wait long between ex
plosions.
The best way to describe "S.WAT.": average. In a
summer piled high with dull and disappointing block
busters, "S.W.A.T." is just another mediocre flick to add
to the list.

Uptown Girls
"Uptown Girls," starring Brittany Murphy and Dako
ta Fanning, painfully underestimates the intelligence of
the audience by trying to pass off a tired formula wihtout
making an attempt to add anything of substance.
The movie, already headed for catastrophe under a
weak script and bad directing, becomes painful to watch
because the characters are so annoying — yet another
byproduct of the poorly written script.
Ultimately, the actors sold themselves out by settling
for the parts in this film. Both Murphy and Fanning have
the skill to play more interesting characters than the ones
this script limited them to. The weight the strong actors
in this film bring to the flimsy script and unsteady direct
ing create an imbalance that only ensures the movie's
failure.

American Wedding
itkftp
Although "American Wedding," the third and final
installment in the "American Pie" series, has thoroughly
mixed and baked in some the necessary ingredients of a
good movie, the final product is palatable but not satisfy
ing, even when fresh out of the oven.
Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan)
are going to wed.
Although the script is lack-luster and the basic story is
uninteresting, the performances from Jason Biggs,
Seann W. Scott and Eugene Levy keep the material fresh
and funny.
It's worth seeing "American Wedding for the wildly
funny and creative (albeit disgusting) comedy sequences,
but don't expect much more from a pie that is only half
baked at best.
