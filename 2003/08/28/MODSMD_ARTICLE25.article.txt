# Drama students at Shakespeare Festival
## 
### 
Every year, hundreds of
thousands of hungry theater
goers pour into the tiny town
of Ashland, Oregon, to sup
port what has become the $22
million dollar per annum
Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
This September, hundreds of
Stanford students (including
a lucky Sophomore College
seminar) will be treated to a
provocative season.
Stanford's connections to
the Oregon Shakespeare Fes
tival are fairly extensive, dat
ing back to Marjorie Bailey,
who established the Institute
for Renaissance Studies in
spired by a visit to the Festi
val. Alumni currently work
ing at the Festival includes
principal scenic designer
Richard L. Hay, whose lush
period set for "Present
Laughter," intimately erotic
and elegant bare-stage setting
for "Antony and Cleopatra"

and vaudevillian chair-domi
nated set for "Wild Oats"
form thrilling backdrops to
three of the Festival's most
popular shows.
The season features out
door productions of "A Mid
summer Night's Dream,"
"Richard II"and John
O'Keefe's "Wild Oats," lavish
indoor mountings of Noel
Coward's "Present Laugh
ter," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler,"
August Wilson's "The Piano
Lesson" and "Romeo and
Juliet," and intimate stagings
of "Antony and Cleopatra," as
well as the world premiere of
recent Pulitzer Prizewinner
Nilo Cruz's "Lorca in a Green
Dress."
What this year's season dis
plays is a fearless willingness
to take risks and an overrid
ing ethic to embrace artistic
diversity. In all, there are as
manv hits as misses in Libby
Appel's rich and riskv sixth sea
son as Artistic Director; ranging
from a brilliant, definitive con
ceptualization of Midsummer
to a ravishingly gothic Hedda,
to a stylish, all-concept, ques
tionable substance R & J.
The common theme seems to
be love, in all its intoxicating
permutations. A superlative
repertory ensemble of 75 ro
tates among the nine separate
casts in various combinations.
One of the Festival's many de
lights is watching Antony and
Cleopatra's majestic, erotic
Queen of Egypt transform into
The Piano Lesson's brow-beat
en, desperate single mother
Bernice (plaved by walking tour
de force Crystal Fox) in the time
it takes for you to eat dinner.
The season is ambitious, and
it is moments like this that keep
the Festival vibrant, alive and
important to its loyal audiences.
Current interest in the OSF
displayed by Stanford faculty
and students may develop and
continue the university's associ
ation with this Festival. The
Festival fosters quite an atmos
phere: its accessible community
of performers is passionately
and happily practicing their
art.
