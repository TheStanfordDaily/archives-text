### 
Every year, hundreds of
thousands of hungry theater
goers pour into the tiny town
of Ashland, Oregon, to sup

million dollar per annum
Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
This September, hundreds of
Stanford students (including

form thrilling backdrops to
three of the Festival's most
popular shows.
The season features out
door productions of "A Mid
summer Night's Dream,"
"Richard II"and John
O'Keefe's "Wild Oats," lavish
indoor mountings of Noel
Coward's "Present Laugh

August Wilson's "The Piano
Lesson" and "Romeo and
Juliet," and intimate stagings
of "Antony and Cleopatra," as
well as the world premiere of
recent Pulitzer Prizewinner
Nilo Cruz's "Lorca in a Green
Dress."

plays is a fearless willingness
to take risks and an overrid
ing ethic to embrace artistic
