### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford telephone sys
tem suffered from technical
problems Tuesday and yester
day. Information Technology
Systems and Services reported
that the phone disruptions were
temporarily resolved by trans
ferring communications traffic
from troubled lines, although
ITSS has not yet identified the
cause of the problems.
According to the Stanford
Report, now that calls have been
rerouted from problematic
lines, repair attempts will be
made. However, ITSS will not
know for certain whether the in
terruptions have been fixed

until the lines are put back into
use again.
The call disruptions began on
Tuesday morning, with 25 per
cent of campus trunk lines af
fected. On Wednesday, when
the problems continued, Nortel
Networks advised ITSS to reini
tialize - meaning to turn the
power off" and back on some of
its phone equipment. These ini
tial efforts did not fix the glitch.
Stephen McLenegan, ITSS sys
tems support manager, ex
plained to the Report that no
equipment had registered any
indications of failure or prob
lems, which will make ITSS'
work more difficult as it tries to
zero-in on the cause of the inter
ruptions.
