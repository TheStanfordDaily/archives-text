## NSO guides new students on the Farm 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the members of the Stanford Class of
2007 were just receiving their acceptance
letters in April, plans for New Student Ori
entation 2003 — which will take place
from Thursday, Sept. 18 to Tuesdav, Sept.
23 — were already underway.
Rising juniors Lauren Friedman and
Will O'Neill, rising seniors Sasha Cox and
Huy Son and recent graduate Jenny Roof
have been working for the Office of Fresh
men and Transfer Students as orientation
coordinators since the beginning of spring
quarter to implement the 200-odd events
that constitute new students' introduction
to life at Stanford.
Last year saw NSO expand to a six-day
program and move from the Dean of Stu
dents office to the jurisdiction of Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and transfer
students. This year the innovations to ori
entation programming continue.
Debuting in NSO 2003 is the Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trip, where transfer stu
dents will have the opportunity to partici
pate in a five-day outdoor retreat that oc
curs prior to orientation.
"SPOT consists of four groups of in
coming transfer students led on trips by
current Stanford students, staff and alum

ni," said Jared Scherer, director of NSO.
"We'd like to expand it at some point to in
clude a much larger number of students
and to be open to all new students as a sup
plement to the six days of orientation pro
gramming."
Many of Stanford's peer institutions
offer a similar outdoor program preced
ing orientation, and the transfer commu

nity on the Farm is an especially good
group to involve in such an offering.
"A lot of the feedback we get from the
transfer community says that transfer stu
dents don't feel as integrated as the fresh
men are during orientation," Scherer said.
"We thought they would be a great group
with which to explore the effectiveness of
this program and the hope is that SPOT

will help ease the transition for incoming
transfer students."
.\nother change to transfer program
ming is the movement of transfer check-in
from White Plaza to the students' respec
tive dorms, where they will hear their
names called out by residence staff and ex-

perience the same warm welcome
that students fondly remember
from their first day at Stanford.
In addition to the standard
parent programming offered on
the first day of orientation —
which ranges from the Parent Re
source Center in Tresidder to a
dinner with Provost Etchemendy
— Thursday will feature two ses
sions entitled "Letting Go: Par
ent-to-Parent Advice." The event
highlights resources available to
parents with advice from parents
of current students and gradu
ates about sending children off to
college.
"We used to have the Parent
Dessert, which was a chance for
parents to talk about saying
goodbye to their children. This
year we revamped that pro
gram in a new way with Letting
Go in a close partnership with
the Parents' Club," Scherer
said. "It's important for parents
to feel that it's okay to be sad
about saying goodbye — and
for them to talk about it in the
company of other parents is a
source of comfort."
As part of a greater University
effort to increase class identity
and school spirit, orientation will
showcase Cardinal athletics
through "Cardinal Fan 101" on
Saturday night when the football
team will have just finished its
game on the road against
Brigham Young University.
"The purpose of the event is
twofold," Lythcott-Haims said.
"First, it is an effort to get new
students into the stadium and ex

cited bout football and Stanford
athletics early on in their Stan
ford experience, which is particu
larly important this year since the
first home game after students
arrive is not until mid-October.
"Second, we want to introduce
new students to the key players in
the world of Stanford spirit —
the Band, the Dollies, Yell Lead
ers, Axe Committee and the new
Cardinal Competitive Cheer
group — so they are primed and
ready for that first game."
Instead of eating dinner in the
dorms that night, new students
will enjoy a barbecue on the field
in the football stadium courtesy
of Stanford Dining, while the var
ious spirit groups provide enter
tainment. The event will be em
ceed by O'Neill, who throws dis
cus on the track and field team.
The Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students office has also
partnered with the Alumni Associ
ation to sell banners reading
"Stanford Class of 2007" — as well
as appropriate class years for in
coming transfer students — on
line before new students arrive for
orientation. The banners were
first introduced in June preceding
graduation and will be available to
alumni during their reunion year.
"We've already sold over 275
banners and are thrilled about
the overwhelming response,"
Scherer said.
Lythcott-Haims added, "We
are essentially trying to start a
new tradition by taking the en
thusiasm surrounding class iden
tity that has taken off in the last
few years and creating a tangible
symbol of that spirit for students
and alumni in the form of these
banners."
Academic events, offered bv

the Undergraduate Advising
Center, have also changed in re
sponse to student needs.
"We looked at evaluations
from last year to gauge students'
reactions to past offerings," said
Roof, the coordinator serving as
the liaison between NSC) and the
UAC. "Students felt like they
could get most of the information
they were hearing from reading
the Bulletin."
The UAC is instead offering a
day of events created as an "up
side-down pyramid," beginning
with more general discussions
about academics at Stanford and
ending with nuts-and-bolts pan
els about choosing particular
courses and tracks.
"The new sessions emphasize
that Stanford offers students the
chance to explore and that your
path in life does not need to be a
straight line," Roof said.
The expansion in academic
events will allow faculty to discuss
student research and will feature
panels with a faculty member,
staff member and current senior
discussing their respective paths
through Stanford.
In an effort to increase cam
pus-wide awareness of the myri
ad offerings during orientation,
the NSO staff will host a "Rollout"
on Sept. 9 from 9 to 10:30 a.m. to
make campus departments and
staffs aware of orientation and
garner campus-wide support
throughout the six days.
"NSO consistently gets high
marks from students and parents
but we wanted to address some
perceived deficiencies," Lythcott-
Haims said. "And in a constant ef
fort to push the envelope, we are
excited to be headed in some new
directions."

the world of Stanford spirit —
the Band, the Dollies, Yell Lead
ers, Axe Committee and the new
Cardinal Competitive Cheer
group — so they are primed and
ready for that first game."
Instead of eating dinner in the
dorms that night, new students
will enjoy a barbecue on the field
in the football stadium courtesy
of Stanford Dining, while the var
ious spirit groups provide enter
tainment. The event will be em
ceed by O'Neill, who throws dis
cus on the track and field team.
The Dean of Freshman and
Transfer Students office has also
partnered with the Alumni Associ
ation to sell banners reading
"Stanford Class of 2007" — as well
as appropriate class years for in
coming transfer students — on
line before new students arrive for
orientation. The banners were
first introduced in June preceding
graduation and will be available to
alumni during their reunion year.
"We've already sold over 275
banners and are thrilled about
the overwhelming response,"
Scherer said.
Lythcott-Haims added, "We
are essentially trying to start a
new tradition by taking the en
thusiasm surrounding class iden
tity that has taken off in the last
few years and creating a tangible
symbol of that spirit for students
and alumni in the form of these
banners."
Academic events, offered bv

the Undergraduate Advising
Center, have also changed in re
sponse to student needs.
"We looked at evaluations
from last year to gauge students'
reactions to past offerings," said
Roof, the coordinator serving as
the liaison between NSC) and the
UAC. "Students felt like they
could get most of the information
they were hearing from reading
the Bulletin."
The UAC is instead offering a
day of events created as an "up
side-down pyramid," beginning
with more general discussions
about academics at Stanford and
ending with nuts-and-bolts pan
els about choosing particular
courses and tracks.
"The new sessions emphasize
that Stanford offers students the
chance to explore and that your
path in life does not need to be a
straight line," Roof said.
The expansion in academic
events will allow faculty to discuss
student research and will feature
panels with a faculty member,
staff member and current senior
discussing their respective paths
through Stanford.
In an effort to increase cam
pus-wide awareness of the myri
ad offerings during orientation,
the NSO staff will host a "Rollout"
on Sept. 9 from 9 to 10:30 a.m. to
make campus departments and
staffs aware of orientation and
garner campus-wide support
throughout the six days.
"NSO consistently gets high
marks from students and parents
but we wanted to address some
perceived deficiencies," Lythcott-
Haims said. "And in a constant ef
fort to push the envelope, we are
excited to be headed in some new
directions."
As the members of the Stanford Class of
2007 were just receiving their acceptance
letters in April, plans for New Student Ori
entation 2003 — which will take place
from Thursday, Sept. 18 to Tuesdav, Sept.
23 — were already underway.
Rising juniors Lauren Friedman and
Will O'Neill, rising seniors Sasha Cox and
Huy Son and recent graduate Jenny Roof
have been working for the Office of Fresh
men and Transfer Students as orientation
coordinators since the beginning of spring
quarter to implement the 200-odd events
that constitute new students' introduction
to life at Stanford.
Last year saw NSO expand to a six-day
program and move from the Dean of Stu
dents office to the jurisdiction of Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and transfer
students. This year the innovations to ori
entation programming continue.
Debuting in NSO 2003 is the Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trip, where transfer stu
dents will have the opportunity to partici
pate in a five-day outdoor retreat that oc
curs prior to orientation.
"SPOT consists of four groups of in
coming transfer students led on trips by
current Stanford students, staff and alum

ni," said Jared Scherer, director of NSO.
"We'd like to expand it at some point to in
clude a much larger number of students
and to be open to all new students as a sup
plement to the six days of orientation pro
gramming."
Many of Stanford's peer institutions
offer a similar outdoor program preced
ing orientation, and the transfer commu

nity on the Farm is an especially good
group to involve in such an offering.
"A lot of the feedback we get from the
transfer community says that transfer stu
dents don't feel as integrated as the fresh
men are during orientation," Scherer said.
"We thought they would be a great group
with which to explore the effectiveness of
this program and the hope is that SPOT

will help ease the transition for incoming
transfer students."
.\nother change to transfer program
ming is the movement of transfer check-in
from White Plaza to the students' respec
tive dorms, where they will hear their
names called out by residence staff and ex-

transfer students will participate in a variety of bonding and orientation activities after they move in.
perience the same warm welcome
that students fondly remember
from their first day at Stanford.
In addition to the standard
parent programming offered on
the first day of orientation —
which ranges from the Parent Re
source Center in Tresidder to a
dinner with Provost Etchemendy
— Thursday will feature two ses
sions entitled "Letting Go: Par
ent-to-Parent Advice." The event
highlights resources available to
parents with advice from parents
of current students and gradu
ates about sending children off to
college.
"We used to have the Parent
Dessert, which was a chance for
parents to talk about saying
goodbye to their children. This
year we revamped that pro
gram in a new way with Letting
Go in a close partnership with
the Parents' Club," Scherer
said. "It's important for parents
to feel that it's okay to be sad
about saying goodbye — and
for them to talk about it in the
company of other parents is a
source of comfort."
As part of a greater University
effort to increase class identity
and school spirit, orientation will
showcase Cardinal athletics
through "Cardinal Fan 101" on
Saturday night when the football
team will have just finished its
game on the road against
Brigham Young University.
"The purpose of the event is
twofold," Lythcott-Haims said.
"First, it is an effort to get new
students into the stadium and ex

cited bout football and Stanford
athletics early on in their Stan
ford experience, which is particu
larly important this year since the
first home game after students
arrive is not until mid-October.
"Second, we want to introduce
new students to the key players in
the world of Stanford spirit —
the Band, the Dollies, Yell Lead
