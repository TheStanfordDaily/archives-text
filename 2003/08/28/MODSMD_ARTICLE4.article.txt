## NSO guides new students on the Farm 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As the members of the Stanford Class of
2007 were just receiving their acceptance
letters in April, plans for New Student Ori
entation 2003 — which will take place
from Thursday, Sept. 18 to Tuesdav, Sept.
23 — were already underway.
Rising juniors Lauren Friedman and
Will O'Neill, rising seniors Sasha Cox and
Huy Son and recent graduate Jenny Roof
have been working for the Office of Fresh
men and Transfer Students as orientation
coordinators since the beginning of spring
quarter to implement the 200-odd events
that constitute new students' introduction
to life at Stanford.
Last year saw NSO expand to a six-day
program and move from the Dean of Stu
dents office to the jurisdiction of Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and transfer
students. This year the innovations to ori
entation programming continue.
Debuting in NSO 2003 is the Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trip, where transfer stu
dents will have the opportunity to partici
pate in a five-day outdoor retreat that oc
curs prior to orientation.
"SPOT consists of four groups of in
coming transfer students led on trips by
current Stanford students, staff and alum

ni," said Jared Scherer, director of NSO.
"We'd like to expand it at some point to in
clude a much larger number of students
and to be open to all new students as a sup
plement to the six days of orientation pro
gramming."
Many of Stanford's peer institutions
offer a similar outdoor program preced
ing orientation, and the transfer commu

nity on the Farm is an especially good
group to involve in such an offering.
"A lot of the feedback we get from the
transfer community says that transfer stu
dents don't feel as integrated as the fresh
men are during orientation," Scherer said.
"We thought they would be a great group
with which to explore the effectiveness of
this program and the hope is that SPOT

will help ease the transition for incoming
transfer students."
.\nother change to transfer program
ming is the movement of transfer check-in
from White Plaza to the students' respec
tive dorms, where they will hear their
