# New Webmail makes debut
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Promising faster speeds,
greater reliability and additional
features, the third version of
Stanford Webmail, known as
I MAP, was bunched by Informa
tion Technology Systems and
Services on Aug. 21. The new sys
tem is designed to increase effi
ciency for both students and ad
ministrators.
"The old system ran on one
very powerful machine and it
couldn't handle the huge load
at all," said Susan Feng, techni
cal manager at ITSS. "The new
Webmail server consists of
three machines and it is a lot
more stable."
According to Tom Cramer, di
rector of technology infrastruc
ture at ITSS, the three machines

used to run the new version of
Webmail are also less expensive
for the University. He added that
the new platform is very scalable
and will allow for greater capacity
if it is ever needed in the future.
The service uses both open
source and open standard tech
nologies, according to the Web
mail Web site. The general soft
ware used for Webmail is called
the Internet Messaging Program,
which allows access to both POPS
and IMAP accounts. ITSS cus
tomized the general program to
fit the University's needs.
ITSS took recommendations
from individuals and groups all
over campus in engineering the
new system. Cramer said the
number one complaint with the
previous Webmail system was the
performance speed.
To remedy this problem, the de
sign team lightened the page weight
of the new Webmail.
"Instead of the service being 200
kilobytes per page, the new Web
mail is about 70 to 100 kilobytes
less," Cramer said.
Ethan Rikleen, network admin
istrator at Residential Computing,
said he was most concerned that the
old edition of Webmail allowed
users to send messages anonymous
ly because there were no headings
identifying the user or computer e
mails were sent from. Users could
enter anything into the"from" field.
Addressing this problem, ITSS
changed the system so that users
can only change their "sent from"

address through general prefer
ences - not for each individual e
mail. Also, two headers were added
to every incoming message detail
ing the user and computer the mes
sage was sent from. This makes
anonymous e-mailing all but im
possible, Rildeen said.
I MAP Webmail is compatible
with every mainstream browser in

eluding Microsoft Internet Explor
er, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla and
Apple Safari. According to Cramer,
Macintosh users running Netscape
4.7 had problems with previous
Webmail versions and will probably
continue to face minor difficulties.
Among the new features includ
ed in I MAP Webmail are multiple
personalities, foreign language sup

port, an address book, multiple
folders and filtering.
"We're pretty excited about the
more prominent display of the fold
ers option," Cramer said. "It allows
people to store mail in folders on the
server. It's not broadly used or
known about on campus but it
makes Webmail more compatible
with Hotmail and Yahoo."

The plans for I MAP Webmail
were approved by ITSS in February
and the team made a concerted ef
fort to bunch the project before the
l>eginning of the school year.
While ITSS has received posi
tive feedback from students and
faculty members, Feng said there
are more improvements to lie
made before the Webmail system is
ideal. For example, there is no at
tachment icon.
"Our concern was performance
in the field," she said. "When people
are out in the field, at the airport or
something, extra icons can slow the
system down even more."
In addition, the address book
function is not yet supported but will
likely be in the future. Other icons
may be added as well, Feng said.
"We're only two weeks into pro
duction," Cramer said. "Chances
are we will discover other things to
fix as more time passes."
