# Coordinators create frosh roommate pairs by hand
## Looking for matches made in heaven 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
To Emil Martinsek and Stephanie Mika, the word
"roommate" is a verb.
As die senior and junior coordinator, respectively,
in the New Undergraduate Housing Office, rising se
nior Mardnsek and rising junior Mika have spent the
summer placing the Stanford Class of 2007 in hous
ing and matching incoming new students together as
roommates.
The coordinators' work begins in mid-June, when
the multiple forms new students fill out are returned
containing details on academic interests, music likes
and dislikes and work habits.
"In July we do an initial read-through of all the
roommate forms and highlight important information
that might be pertinent when pairing students togeth
er," Martinsek said. Such information could range
from allergies to sleeping habits.
After initially placing students into residential pro
grams like Freshman/Sophomore College and SLE, a
housing allocation program is run to sort through the

rest of the incoming class.
"The housing program was run on July 16 and
it's like the Draw for freshmen, but they don't have
a number and can't rank any preferences except
for what kind of hall they would like to live on."
Mika said.
.After the initial assignment is performed, the two
coordinators spend the rest of the summer going
through assignments by hand and carefully consider
ing what will make a successful roommate pair.
Martinsek and Mika first work on balancing the re
sults of the program, which may involve moving stu
dents to improve diversity based on geographic re
gion or high school, for example.
"Our goal is to create a microcosm of the universi
ty in every dorm and for students to have a commu
nity within their residence," Martinsek said.
New students can specify whether they would like
all-freshmen or four-class housing, and if thev would
prefer a single-sex or co-ed hallway. This year the co
ordinators have seen a rise in requests for all-fresh-
men housing â€” about 1070 new
students were hoping for an all
freshmen dorm, while Stanford
only has 850 such spots.
"People are really excited about
Branner re-opening and the
Wilbur / Stern area," Mika said.
Martinsek added, "About half
of the freshman class is in that area,
which makes it really popular.
Usually between 55 and 60 per
cent of freshmen would like an all
frosh dorm."
But the rise in requests for all
freshmen housing has also created
some unrest in the new class.
"Students are much more vocal
this year than last year about not
getting all-frosh housing if they re
quested it," Mika said.
Martinsek pointed out, "But
each year preferences fluctuate, so
we could add more all-frosh spots
but have fewer people requesting
that housing. But new students,
for some reason, feel like their
Stanford experience won't be
good unless they live in all-frosh
housing."
While there is no guarantee
that any roommate pairing will be
successful, the coordinators care
fully comb through forms and
have developed a formula for
"roommating" that takes into ac
counts many key aspects to a good
living situation.
"We want to put people togeth
er with similar study habits, bed
times and neatness," Mika said.
"We also look at a student's ethnic
ity, region they are coming from,
projected academic interest in col
lege and their ultimate academic
goal.
"Within these criteria, we
would like to pair people together
with at least three differences out

of four."
Music choices provide an un
likely source of help in the pairing
process.
"Listening to music starts a
number of conversations between
students in the dorms," Martinsek
said. "It can also be a source of con
flict when two people's music tastes
really clash. So that's another piece
of information we use as we go
through forms."
The office responsible for all of
this was previously known as the
New Undergraduate Student In
formation Project. But after a re
view conducted by the Vice Provost

of Undergraduate Education's of
fice, the VPUE's office took over all
the mailings sent to new students
except the housing mailing and
also took over the phone and email
that was traditionally sent to
NUSIF coordinators.
"I think the biggest thing that's
changed this summer is our ability
to meet the freshmen," Martinsek
said. "Now they're just paper to us
but before we got to know them
personally via the phone and
email. The more information we
have, the better a job we can do
when finding a roommate.
"We like the social phone calls

from students we used to get, but
now we only hear from students
who want housing changes."
Because students are already
placed into dorms based on their
preferences when search fora
roommate begins, limiting the
number of potential bunkmates
considerably, finding the perfect
match from a pool of over 1700 is
rare. But it can still happen.
"We have one freshman who is
an avid Janet Jackson fan and a
night owl and we were hoping to
find someone who shared these
criteria," Martinsek said. "It
turned out that, in the same dorm,

there was a student who met all of
our other requirements, tended to
stay up late and listed Janet Jack
son as a favorite artist."
And the coordinators are al
ways happy to assuage one impor
tant fear for parents.
"For some reason, parents
think that a co-ed floor means
their daughter will be living with
a male student or that their son
will be showering with the
women on his hallway," Mika
said. "We've definitely relieved
lots of parents this summer by ex
plaining exactly what a co-ed liv
ing situation entails."

The remodeled Branner dorm will be home to hoards of freshmen who will arrive on move-in day and meet their roommates for the first time. Many other
schools give incoming students contact information for their roommates beforehand, but Stanford is unique in this respect.
