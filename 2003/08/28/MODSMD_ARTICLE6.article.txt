To Emil Martinsek and Stephanie Mika, the word
"roommate" is a verb.

coordinators spend the rest of the summer going
through assignments by hand and carefully consider

"Our goal is to create a microcosm of the universi

New students can specify whether they would like
all-freshmen or four-class housing, and if thev would
