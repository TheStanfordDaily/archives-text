## Bush defends U.S. Iraqi occupation 
### 
ST. LOUIS — Responding to the mounting
death toll in Iraq, President Bush on Tuesday
sought to redefine the conflict as a pivotal contest
between civilization and chaos, and vowed,
"There will be no retreat."
Defending his handling of the war before an
audience of military veterans, Bush cast the strug
gle in postwar Iraq as a key test of America's abili
ty to defeat terrorism and as a bellwether for
democracy in the Middle East. Although the pres
ident's remarks raised the prospect of deeper U.S.
involvement in Iraq, he didn't say whether he
thinks more troops are needed to restore order.
"Our course is set. Our purpose is firm," Bush
told several thousand veterans at the American
Legion's annual convention in St. Louis. "Our
only goal, our only option, is total victory in the
war on terror."
Although the president repeatedly has linked
the war in Iraq to the larger war on global terror
ism, he suggested that the stakes have increased
since the fall of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein be
cause Iraq "is now a point of testing in the war on
terrorism." Islamic militants from throughout the
Middle East have been making their way to Iraq to
undermine American efforts to stabilize and re
build the country.
"The more progress we make in Iraq, the more
desperate the terrorists will become. They have
declared war on the civilized world, and the civi
lized world will not be intimidated," Bush said.
"Retreat in the face of terror would only invite fur
ther and bolder attacks."
He opened the door fora bigger financial com
mitment. Administration officials didn't dispute
reports that the president soon may ask Congress
for another $3 billion for operations in Iraq this
year.
With the deaths of two more American soldiers
in Iraq on Tuesday — the 277 th and 278 th since
the war started March 19 — more service mem
bers have died since Bush declared major combat
over May 1 than during the war itself.
During the same time frame, unrelenting sabo
tage and terrorist attacks have raised doubts about
the ability of U.S. troops to restore order. Some
American Legion members shared those doubts
even as they gave the president a standing ova
tion.
"I'm not sure about him, really," William Mack,
a Korean War veteran from Metuchen, N.J., said
when asked to assess Bush's wartime perfor
mance. "Definitely, we need more troops. I be
lieve we'll be there more than five years from
now."
The president acknowledged some of the re
cent setbacks in Iraq, but put more emphasis on
some of the successes: more than 8,200 tons of
ammunition seized, 1,100 Iraqi suspects arrested,
42 of the 55 "most wanted" Iraqi officials killed or
captured.
Even so, there was none of the bravado of some
of his previous remarks. Instead, Bush stressed
the difficulty of the task and his determination to
"stay the course."
He said al-Qaida terrorists are still "a grave
danger" to Americans. "No matter how long it
takes, we will bring to justice those who plot
against the United States," he said.
