# Bush eases pollution control policies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — In one of the
biggest changes to pollution regula
tions in recent years, the Bush admin
istration yesterday eased a key air-pol
lution rule affecting more than 500
older power plants and some 20,000
aging factories and refineries.
The change would allow operators
of these facilities to make significant
equipment upgrades without having
to install costly new pollution-control
equipment.
Until now, plants couldn't make
significant changes without also in
stalling enhanced air-pollution con
trols such as new scrubbers in their
stacks.
The Environmental Protection
Agency's new rule allows plant owners
to make upgrades worth up to 20 per
cent of a plant's value without in
stalling new air-pollution controls. A
$500 million coal-fired power plant,
for example, could replace $100 mil
lion in equipment yearly without
adding new pollution controls.
The change, like much of the Bush
energy plan, sides with industry in the
tension between increased energy
production and potential environ
mental degradation.
The administration's hope is that
by increasing the efficiency of older

coal-fired plants - the most affected
segment - more power can be pro
duced more cheaply. Plants still must
abide by state and federal air-pollu
tion laws, so there won't necessarily be
any increase in pollution, the adminis
tration argues.
Critics say the air will get dirtier be
cause many plants that now pollute far
less than is permitted will be allowed
to increase their emissions of particu
lates, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen ox
ides.
"These changes rip the heart out of
the Clean Air Act," New Jersey Gov.
James McGreevey said yesterday. Ten
states have sued the EPA over other
changes in pollution regulations, and
many plan to do so over the new rule
as well. New York and Pennsylvania
officials said they'd join in.
While the eased rule applies to
thousands of facilities, the contentious
debate is mostly about old coal power
plants. Coal is the nation's top electric
ity producer, the utility sector is the
leading polluter and coal is the dirtiest
way to produce power.
Acting EPA Administrator Mari
anne Horinko said the change would
give older power plants "more reliable
operations that are environmentally
sound and provide more affordable

energy.
The change could enable operators
to add equipment that increases coal
fired power plants' efficiency by 10
percent, the equivalent of 60 new av
erage-sized power plants, said Scott
Segal, the director of the Electric Reli
ability Coordinating Council. The
Washington-based council represents
a group of utilities that the Clinton ad
ministration sued in the late 1990s for
violating the rule the Bush adminis
tration is loosening.
"This rule-making guts one of the
most important parts of the Clean Air
Act," said William Becker, the execu
tive director of a Washington-based
organization that represents state and
local air regulators, the State and Ter
ritorial Air Pollution Program Admin
istrators and Association of Local Air
Pollution Control Officials. "We think
the rule is going to seriously erode
public health and environmental pro
tection."
According to Angela Ledford, the
director of Clear the Air, part of the
Washington-environmental lobby Na
tional Environmental Trust, allowing
older coal plants to operate as usual
could cause up to 20,000 premature
deaths a year due to smog-induced
respiratory illnesses.
