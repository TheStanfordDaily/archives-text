# Blaster worm chews through networks
## 
### 
(AP) — Congratulations if you're
among the 99 percent of personal com
puter users who weren't hit with the
Blaster worm last week or Soßig virus
Blaster this week. You now have a
chance to make your PC safe before the
next threat emerges.
Most home computers aren't fully
protected because most home users
don't understand the appropriate steps
to take or simply don't want the hassle.
So instead of a product review this
week, I'll attempt the impossible: Ex
plain in plain English why you need
basic security, and suggest painless
ways to make your computer safer. The
tips here are for users of Windows per
sonal computers.
Don't panic! The virtual world of the
Internet, just like the real world, has its
share of criminals and crazies. But the
odds of your PC getting hit are low,
making it appropriate to be cautious
and you won't need to suffer through
big alterations in your daily computing
habits.
In the unfortunate event you're
struck, don't give up hope. It's ex
tremely unlikely your computer will
sustain any physical damage. Corrupt
ed software and data files can often be
restored, although you may have to en

dure hours or even days of effort.
Protection is a process, not a prod
uct. Locking the front door of your
house isn't the only home security you
need; you may also buy insurance and
perhaps even hire an alarm service.
Your computer, too, needs more than
one type of protection. What's more,
the steps you take must be updated as
the bad guys come up with new tricks -
you can't set up everything one time
and then relax.
There's more than one kind of "mal
ware,"' the industry term for software
created to attack other computers.
Among the most common:
Virus. A small computer program
that is self-replicating and moves from
computer to computer, usually by at
taching itself to data files. While a few
viruses do nothing but copy them
selves, most inflict some sort of damage.
Commonly spread through e-mail at
tachments, viruses usually won't acti
vate unless the user clicks on the infect
ed file.
Trojan horse. A file that looks to be
something you want — a digital pic
ture, perhaps, or a song — that turns
out to be malicious. Unlike viruses,
Trojan horses do not copy themselves.
Worm. A type of self-replicating

virus that spreads on its own, without
having to attach to another file. Worms
can slip in by themselves. They often
don't require any direct action by the
user. The Blaster worm was like this.
Intruders. Individuals who look for
unprotected computers that they can
control remotely, usually in search of
confidential information such as credit
card numbers or bank account infor
mation. Some intruders leave behind
software that hijacks a computer's re
sources, without the user realizing
what's happening, to search for more
unprotected machines or run illegal
Web sites.
Spyware. Hidden programs that
monitor activity and send information
back to their masters. Harmless spy
ware might watch the Web pages you
visit to figure out which banner ads are
most appropriate to display; malicious
spyware can be the starting point for
identity theft.
You can start protecting your PC
without spending a dime or a lot of
time. Among the first steps:
Windows Update. Windows XP will
automatically and invisibly retrieve up
dates including all-important security
patches - whenever your computer is
connected to the Internet.
