The sequence will cover important areas of engineering mathematics and will
emphasize engineering applications and computation using MATLAB. The
intent is a) to introduce freshmen and sophomores to the relevant mathematics
and computational tools early in their college career, b) to excite their interest
in the engineering disciplines and provide early exposure to the engineering
faculty and the use of computation in solving real engineering problems. The
new sequence consisting of Engr 154, Engr 155 A, Engr 1558, and/or Engr
155 C can be used as an alternative to Math 51, Math 52, and Math 53 and will
satisfy the general engineering mathematics requirement.
