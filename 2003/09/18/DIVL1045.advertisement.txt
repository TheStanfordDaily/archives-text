Your next four years at Stanford promise to be great, but the fun isn't just confined
to The Farm. Palo Alto and the surrounding mid-Peninnsula cities offer some of
Northern California's finest restaurants and bars, with world-class cuisine to fit all
tastes and budgets. Use the accompanying maps and advertisements as a guide to
the great things to do "Off The Farm." Check out some of these restaurants and see
what you like. Orientation weekend is a great time to start exploring the diverse
and delicious flavors of the Bay Area!
