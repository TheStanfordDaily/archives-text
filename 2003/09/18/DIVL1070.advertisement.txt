EL CAMINO...
AND BEYOND
The mid-peninsula is teeming with
dining options along every majar
road. Located in Mountain View,
Castro Street is a fusion between the
class of Downtown Palo Alto and the
practicality of California Avenue. It
is crowded with exotic restaurants
and businesses. Whether you're
looking for Italian, Thai, or just a
good book, Mountain View and
Menlo Park may be your best bet.
On your way there don't forget
about the many restaurant lining El
Camino, San Antonio, and Embar
cadero. On these streets you will
rarely have difficulty parking.
