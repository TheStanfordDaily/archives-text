The brightest future
From where, one may ask, is the vision to come which will inspire men to relinquish the
ways of the past — war, competition and destruction of the planet — and so lead to the cre
ation of a path to sharing, justice and peace? For how long must men wait for a sign that this is
even feasible? Where should men look for a glimmer, even, of hope? Without doubt, there is
much happening in the world to strain the credence of all but the most convinced that this
much to be desired event is not only possible but assured.
From what basis can such a statement be made? From what superior knowledge does it
issue? How in this uncertain world can such confidence be maintained? The answers to these
legitimate questions he in the fact known to all Hierarchy (but not yet to all men) that Their
Head and Leader, Maitreya Himself, is, for many years now, present in the everyday world; that
many of Their illustrious Brothers, likewise, walk once more with men. This fact alone is quite
without precedent. It betokens something wonderful and new for men. For the first time in
coundess thousands of years these "men without fault" will teach men how to live, simply and
well, in peace and right relationship.
Thus it may be said that the future for man is assured. Men, however, must accept and
put in place the mechanism for peace: the recognition that all men are equal and one, each an
expression of the divinity which permeates all Being. When this is clearly understood, men will
have little difficulty in creating the path to peace. The divine aspects of justice and freedom will
gain new meaning and importance, and hasten the day when sharing of resources assumes its
natural, logical place as the answer to man's present dilemma and strife.
Until now, all such ideas and demonstrations of spiritual living were made by men alone.
Slow indeed has been the response to their heroic example. Nevertheless, circumstances are
now exerting on men unusual and insupportable pressures — men must adapt and change, or
perish.
As they search for answers to their problems they will find Maitreya and His Group ready
to respond, ready to guide men away from danger and further folly. They have the answers
which thus far have eluded men, the answers which alone will assure the future, the brightest
possible future, for the race of men.
