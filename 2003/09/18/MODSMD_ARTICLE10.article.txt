# Stanford falls to fifth in rankings

### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford fell from the fourth
to the fifth overall ranking in the
recently released U.S. News and
World Report's "America's
Best Colleges 2004." Princeton
and Harvard tied for number
one - Princeton's fourth consec
utive year in the top spot.
The publication is a popular
reference for students going
through the college selection
and application process, though
many universities and guidance
counselors criticize it for trying
to quantify quality of education.
"Going from fourth to fifth
strikes me as pretty much a
wash," said Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet.
"It's hard to get either excited or
bothered by it. Within the scope
of American higher education
and given the lack of precision in
these kinds of ratings, it's really
not a big deal. If the rankings re
mained the same each year, the
magazines wouldn't sell."

Yale was rated third. Ranked
fourth was the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which
tied with Stanford for that spot
last year. In this year's report,
Stanford tied with the Califor
nia Institute of Technology,
Duke University, and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania for the

fifth spot.
Incoming freshman Jack Stahl
said the change in rankings
didn't strike him as particularly
important.

"Although I was definitely
conscious of the general pres
tige and reputation of each
school to which I applied, and I
did look at the U.S. News rank
ings and I was cognizant of the
factors by which it creates its
rankings, I was not particularly
concerned with the arbitrary al
gorithm and its resultant rank
ings," he said.
The U.S. News rankings take
into consideration the assessment
by administrators at peer institu
tions, retention of students, facul
ty resources, student selectivity,
financial resources, alumni giving
and "graduation rate perfor
mance," the difference between
the proportion of students ex
pected to graduate and the pro
portion who actually do.
"The U.S. News rankings pro
vide an excellent starting point
for families because they offer
the opportunity to judge the rel
ative quality of institutions based
on widely accepted indicators of
excellence," wrote Robert J.
Morse and Samuel M. Flanigan
on the U.S. News Web site.
This was the first year that
