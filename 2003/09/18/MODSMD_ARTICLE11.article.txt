# SoCo mixes work and fun

### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
It's 2 a.m. on a Monday morning, and the sec
ond-floor halls of Rinconada are silent except for
the faint sound of Sean Paul's "Get Busy." A cu
rious student follows the music downstairs to the
dorm's computer cluster, and opens the door to a
burst of laughter and chatter - a crowd of people
buried among laptops and heaps of paper. Pow
erpoint presentations flash in the background;
others dance in the middle of the room.
It's scenes like this that make Sophomore
College a unique experience.
When students applied for this two-to-three
week program, most cited attention from faculty
and in-depth study as their reasons for cutting
summer short. After all, they had to agree to the
$4OO fee of their two-hour seminar of choice,
after entering a competitive applicant pool for
the limited spots last April.
This year's program, which offers 20 classes
across a full range of departments, ended on
Tuesday. The seminars gave rising sophomores
the opportunity to solve international crises,
delve into the art of film and even track the the

ory of evolution to its tropical source. In the
Wilbur and Stern Hall dorms, each class member
lived in hall clusters with two sophomore assis
tants-a position that combines RA and TA du
ties.
Some of the classes also included off campus
trips. Prof. Luis Fraga took his California politics
class to the state capital in Sacramento, and Prof.
Russell Berman's class on Thomas Mann's
"Magic Mountain" included a trip up Mount
Tamalpais overlooking San Francisco. And two
of the classes were taught entirely off campus, al
lowing students to explore Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station and the Oregon Shakespeare
Festival in Ashland, Ore.
"The primary purpose of Sophomore College
is to increase faculty-student interactions and to
elevate the level of intellectualism among under
graduates," said Linguistics Prof. Thomas
Wasow, who taught the course Understanding
Language, in which students investigated the
link between technology and linguistics.
"I have found that the students in it are, in
general, the most highly motivated and enthusi
astic students I have ever taught," he said. "Many
of them stay in touch in subsequent years, and I

like establishing such lasting relationships with
students."
Offering advice to his second year students,
Wasow said, "Try to find some area of study that
you enjoy so much that you want to pursue it for
its own sake, irrespective of grades."
In his fourth year teaching at Sophomore Col
lege, School of Law Prof. Gerhard Casper led a
class in dissecting the concept of constitutional
ism, especially in relation to the budding Euro
pean Union.
"Of all the teaching experiences I have had -
and I have had many - Sophomore College is the
most satisfying," he said. "The continuity and in
tensity that are provided by daily seminar meet
ings is unrivaled in the university.
"The students' learning curve is very steep,
and they reach high analytic levels quickly and
therefore they quickly develop the capacity to
challenge me," Casper added.
Many students felt the time crunch as the
short session neared its end, rushing to campus li
braries for frenzied research, logging serious
cluster time tinkering slideshows and, of course,
commiserating with their peers.
Sophomore Rocio Cardenas, a student in
Fraga's Future of California course, said that
while the workload wasn't overwhelming, some
classes definitely required more labor than oth
ers.
"I really liked the assignments in my class be
cause I thought they forced us to consider the
number of compromises and interests policy
makers face," she said.
Cardenas added that the class not only piqued
her interest in a political science major but also
helped her ease her way into her sophomore
year.
As an SA, an adviser who attends the class,
rising junior Valicia Saucedo saw her job as a
chance to become better acquainted with mater
ial she had learned as a student the previous year.
"I think I have matured a bit in my academic
abilities," she said. "I think that taking the class
over again was very beneficial to me."
While Saucedo realized her position carried a
certain amount of authority, she said for the most
part she felt like any other student.
"I wanted to be an SA for SoCo to get to know
some great sophomores," she said. "Not only did
I get to see and do all the behind-the-scenes work
that goes into preparing for all aspects of the
class, but I also got to meet and work with some
incredibly bright students."
As classes and projects took up daytime
hours, evenings were set aside for fun, even if
work was left to be done. As night fell, lounges
flooded with ping pong players and pool junkies.
As the days wore on, the strange blend of party
ing and academics became more pronounced, as
students would stumble out of their rooms to join
in the fun.
"One time at about 3 in the morning, I
stepped out of my room and heard salsa music
coming from upstairs," Saucedo said. "I wan
dered up to the second floor to discover six stu
dents from the class, plus the other SA, having a
full-out salsa dance party.
"I stayed up there for an hour before I finally
felt tired enough to go back to sleep," she added.
"It was great because it showed how much the
class had bonded."
