# Stanford poll shows Arnold leading
## Poll by Stanford profs shows Bustamante trailing in second place 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
If a Stanford poll is correct, the pending Califor
nia gubernatorial recall race may be closer than ex
pected. In an online poll conducted by The Menlo

Park-based Knowledge Networks - founded by
two Stanford professors - Republican actor,
Arnold Schwarzenegger, won 40 percent of votes,
compared to just 28 percent for Democratic fron
trunner Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
What makes these results surprising is that in
most telephone polls, Bustamante has come out
in the lead - or at least head to head with the
actor. An LA Times poll released on Aug. 24
found Bustamante with a 35 percent to 22 per
cent edge over Schwarzenegger; a Field Poll re
leased around the same time had them in a dead
heat.
The reason for the discrepancy lies in the way

the poll was conducted, said Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina, one of three professors who spon
sored the poll, conducted between Aug. 29 and
Sept. 8. While other polls allowed respondents to
choose only from the top candidates, this poll
showed participants the actual ballot that will be
used in the recall election, if and when it takes place,
and allowed them to choose between all 135 candi
dates.
"It was a much closer simulation of what those
voters with be faced with," Fiorina said.
Another difference is in the re
sponse rate of participants. As the
public has become less forgiving of in
convenient phone calls, the response
rate for typical phone polls has
dropped to 30 percent.
Meanwhile, the Stanford poll,
which gives respondents internet
access in exchange for their partici
pation - and takes it away if partici
pants do not respond - has a much
higher response rate of 60 percent.
Fiorina says this makes the poll
more accurate. But according to
Karthick Ramakrishnan, a research
fellow at the Public Policy Institute of
California, offering an extra incentive
to participate in the poll could skew
results. After all, Californians don't
have any reason to vote, aside from
civic duty.
"You might have a high percent
age of people [responding] who won't
actually be voting," he said.
According to Knowledge Net
works, the results of the poll represent
the choices of 528 of the 852 respon
dents who said they are registered to
vote and likely to vote in the recall

election.
There has been some dispute
among pollsters over whose method
ologies are correct. Officials at the
Field Poll are questioning the results
of the LA Times poll, which they say
gave too much weight to black and
Asian voters. And when the Times
came up with very different results in
a second poll, conducted after the
Aug. 24 survey, the newspaper felt
compelled to print a story headlined
"Why Polls Differ" to explain the dis
crepancies.
But regardless of all the contro
versy, no one has denied that
Schwarzenegger is indeed very pop
ular, which brings up a bigger ques
tion: Do the polls' results confirm
accusations by some observers that
residents of the Golden State pay
closer attention to Hollywood su
perficiality than to important,
meaty issues?
"I think that's an oversimplifica
tion," Fiorina said. He attributes
Schwarzenegger's success to the fact
that many Californian voters are
looking for a candidate who is not a
career politican.
"When is the time for an amateur
to run against a professional?" Fiori
na asks. "It's when the professional
has screwed up."
