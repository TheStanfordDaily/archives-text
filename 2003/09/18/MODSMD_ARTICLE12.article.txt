# Stanford poll shows Arnold leading
## Poll by Stanford profs shows Bustamante trailing in second place 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
If a Stanford poll is correct, the pending Califor
nia gubernatorial recall race may be closer than ex
pected. In an online poll conducted by The Menlo

Park-based Knowledge Networks - founded by
two Stanford professors - Republican actor,
Arnold Schwarzenegger, won 40 percent of votes,
compared to just 28 percent for Democratic fron
trunner Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
What makes these results surprising is that in
most telephone polls, Bustamante has come out
in the lead - or at least head to head with the
actor. An LA Times poll released on Aug. 24
found Bustamante with a 35 percent to 22 per
cent edge over Schwarzenegger; a Field Poll re
leased around the same time had them in a dead
heat.
The reason for the discrepancy lies in the way

the poll was conducted, said Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina, one of three professors who spon
sored the poll, conducted between Aug. 29 and
Sept. 8. While other polls allowed respondents to
choose only from the top candidates, this poll
showed participants the actual ballot that will be
used in the recall election, if and when it takes place,
and allowed them to choose between all 135 candi
dates.
"It was a much closer simulation of what those
voters with be faced with," Fiorina said.
