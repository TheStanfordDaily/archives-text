# The
						Stanford Daily Editor's Note
## Editor welcomes new students to the Farm 
### 
"Let's start at the very beginning,"
chirps Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music.
Other lyrics follow. But we'll improvise. In
high school, you have:
Curfews.
Parents.
Proms.
In college, life is full of more flavor.
You might morph into that cool cat you've
idolized since middle school sporting
hippie garb, body piercing, viper tattoos.
(On second thought, maybe not. This isn't
Berkeley.) But other changes are more cer
tain: Au revoir AP classes! Bite the dust,
locker combinations! Ta ta, gym teachers!
Instead, life will revolve
around:

Shower flips flops.
Stale pizza.
Foam parties.
Problem sets.
University courses.
This is your very be
ginning. And it's ours, too
with this special orientation
edition of Volume 224 of The
Stanford Daily. In the pages
that follow, you should get a
feel for our spectrum of cover
age. Our articles range from the
sporty (see our glossary of ath
letic terms, pages 811-B12) to
the spooky (see "Tales from the
Crypt," page CI) to the spotty

(find those yourself). And, of course, the
ability to alliterate is the standard pre-requi
site for all our editors. Like any good jour
nalist or infomercial spokesman it's
also our duty to inform. Educate. And report
accurate information.
Are you with me? Wonderful. Let's
get better acquainted.
The Stanford Daily is the Peninsu
la's oldest morning newspaper. Our pages
are written, edited and shot entirely by stu
dent journalists; in fact, many of us are gruff,
balding reporters who look exactly like Ed
Asner. Well, not so much. But we do live,
drink and drink some more in our offices in
the Storke Publications Building, across
from Roble Hall adjacent to the Stanford
Chaparral, the humor magazine that cranked
up Johnny Cash when we returned last week.
In other news, our newspaper
which circulates to about 10,000 readers on
campus, Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and even Israel (who knew?) has

undergone some major changes this year. To
better accommodate our readers, we've
added a Features section which will cover
campus life. Expect the unexpected, as the
motto of the hit television series "Big Broth
er" tells us, with more wacky articles ("Sex
and Stanford," page C 5) and longer pieces of
literary journalism ("Countdown to Orienta
tion," page C 3).

By the way, if you're lost on cam
pus, or if you're searching for the secret cac
tus garden, study our campus map (pages
AB-A9). But avoid the serial groper at all
costs as well as those fearsome Stanford
Bookstore lines (see front page).

In future issues, also look
for our new weekly Health section.
And our renovated Intermission
tabloid on Fridays, for arts and en
tertainment buffs (hidden Virginia
Woolf references abound; so buy
the flowers yourself). Finally, the
most noticeable change of all: Our
pages have been redesigned to
allow for larger photos and more
varied headlines, along with a new
font that keeps up with the journal
ism world's standards.
And now, as we get to the
end, let us go back to the very be
ginning. Or a potential beginning,
that is. I came into the newsroom of

The Stanford Daily as a freshman.
My reporting was drippy. My edit
ing was slippery. And I was far less talented
in the art of slant rhymes.
With a couple training sessions, the
ability to field harassing phone calls from
editors and some spunk, you too can join our
"special staff' (says eternal ASSU beat re
porter Morgan Springer). Drop by our office
on Santa Teresa Avenue. Just follow the
Johnny Cash music.
Welcome to Stanford.
