## Use Orientation to explore Week's programs offer new students a solid introduction to Stanford 
### 
New Student Orientation for the
Class of 2007 began when your house staff
cheered as you strode up the walk to your
dorm this morning. About 3,500 man hours
have been invested in planning this year's
program, and more than 160 volunteers have
spent the last week setting out chairs, paint
ing banners in the dorms, and ensuring that
everything is ready for the arrival of the fresh
man and transfer class.
Over the next three days, new students will
be able to choose from among over 200
events that range from this afternoon's Fresh
man Convocation, the annual program that
promises to pack the Quad, to smaller events
targeted at members of specific communities
and those with particular academic interests.
The coordinators of this year's Orientation
have done an admirable job crafting a menu of
lectures, workshops and entertainment options
as diverse as Stanford's entering class. We laud

them for the countless hours they have poured
into planning this annual program.
Today, the upperclassmen and staff mem
bers who spent all summer working on Ori
entation pass the baton off to the Class of
2007. It is up to each member of the freshman
and transfer class to take full advantage of the
opportunities presented at Orientation.
We urge students to attend a wide variety
of academic programming in order to probe
the extent of Stanford's offerings. Take time
to stop in at "From Here to There: Exploring
Your Major" and set aside part of your busy
schedule to attend a lecture offered by one of
Stanford's distinguished professors.
Orientation is also the best time to get to
know your academic adviser and your peer
academic adviser. Your academic advising
team will be an invaluable resource for your
academic growth over the coming year.
But most importantly, spend these six days
exploring. There will never again be a time
when you will have nothing to worry about
but discovering the opportunities both
academic and personal that this Universi
ty has to offer. Use these precious days to
their fullest.
