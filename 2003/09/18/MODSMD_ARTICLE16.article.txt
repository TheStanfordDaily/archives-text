International students burdened
by "unduly length" of visa checks
When I tried to return to Stan
ford after visiting my family in
China last winter break, I was not
permitted to re-enter the United
States. The trip home was intended
to last only three weeks, but since
then, I have been waiting for my re
turn visa for more than eight
months. The so-called Security Ad
visory Opinion visa check is unduly
lengthy, it has seriously disrupted
my study and research plan and it
has added significant hardships to
my life.
As I know, there are dozens of
Chinese students at Stanford who
have suffered through this visa
check for months. I fully under
stand the importance of U.S. bor
der security and the necessity of the
visa checks, but I hope the impedi
ment to these innocent students
seeking to return to their studies
can be resolved within a reasonable
timeframe.
Because of the unduly length of
these visa checks, most of my Chi
nese friends on campus dare not go
home to visit their families or
friends. This lengthy visa check has
caused great inconvenience to all
the Chinese students in the United
States, and probably also to other
international students.

Unsung heros are important too
The events of Sept. 11,2001, the
only attack on American soil in re
cent memory, shocked me and
shattered my insulated world. Two
years later, I am still greatly sad
dened by the tragedies.
However, when I saw several
tears during the moment of silence
that we held at work on the second
anniversary of 9 / 11, I was deeply
touched at the empathy of those
around me. Their compassion,
even though many of them did not
personally know anyone who was
directly affected by the tragedy,
made me proud to know and be as
sociated with them and this country
May we never forget.
My own tears did not come until
a few hours later. I updated myself
on the World Trade Organization
protests in Cancun, Mexico, and
learned that a fellow activist, Lee
Kyung-Hae, had committed sui
cide in order to symbolize the orga
nization's hand in the death and
blight of poor farmers around the
world.
I cried because I was touched by
his dedication to his people and his
cause. I cried because not even the
sacrifice of his life, a human life
in addition to the countless, anony
mous deaths in developing coun
tries due to unfair tariffs, taxes and
subsidies could remind the
American people, could awaken
the people of the world to destruc
tive policies of globalization organi
zations such as the WTO.
May we never forget our inno
cent brothers and sisters that Sept.
11 has affected. May we never for
get the peasant farmers who are
being forced into starvation be
cause subsidized farmers from rich
nations can sell competing goods at
below production costs.
May we never forget that they
too are our brothers and sisters.

Roxy: Watch the sass
You must be really desperate
for copy. I for one can not wait for
Ms. "Roxy Sass" to either graduate
â€”or grow up whichever
should happen to come first, given
her latest foray into dispensing ex
ceedingly unwise "advice" ("How
to find an off campus fling," July
31). As if this deep subject merits
column inches in a student publi
cation at a prestigious university
such as Stanford.
May I point out that no female
mammal that I am aware of has ever
had any difficulty in this particular
area, in any ecosystem, neighbor
hoods adjacent to college campuses
being no exception.
So if Ms. Sass is experiencing
"difficulty" in this area, perhaps it
is due to what comes out of her
mouth, not her gender. For those
in true "difficulties," one might
suggest a street corner on El
Camino Real, but I am sure Ms.
Sass will get that one figured out be
fore your next issue goes to press.
As for her expertise in what she
naively calls "rebounding" one
can only hope that part of her re
bounding technique will not in
clude a post-graduate series of arti
cles on how to rebound from living
with AIDS.
Please print something genuine
ly funny or worthwhile in place of
this exceedingly asinine column.

Madonna.

It is unnerving to read articles
like those of Roxy Sass ("Roxy on
animal rights and dating: Bestiality
is not best," Aug. 28) if only for the
fact that, if my generation (who
conceived you all) were so "free"
from inhibitions, which led to the
AIDS / abortion / STDs era, what
the hell is this generation of Stan
ford students going to give their
children?
Something scary.
If any fatherly advice can be
given to any of you now, it could be
this whatever principles you live
life by now, make sure they are
ones you won't be eventually em
barrassed to have passed on to the
children you give birth to.

Schools need to shed their
'anti-Israel bias'
To take up the concerns of Dr.
Daniel H. Jacobs ("Diverse view
points need to be heard at Stan
ford," Aug. 28), it seems that anti-
Semitism, while not politically cor
rect, has found a new outlet: It is
politically correct to be anti-Israel.
Why is it correct to vilify a small
nation which is standing up for its
independence, except as a form of
anti-Semitism that still spans the
globe?
The outcome of the vituperative
anti-Israel bias at Stanford,
Columbia and other great Ameri
can universities is destined to revert
to the root cause. And the root
cause is anti-Semitism or the in
ability to accept Israel as a
sovereign, self-governing, inde
pendent nation.

Diploma, version 2.0
I should like to know if the Uni
versity Board of Trustees is plan
ning to send me a new diploma fea
turing the new seal of the Universi
ty ("Board of Trustees Adopts New
Seal," Aug. 14). My "old" diploma
was issued in 2002 and it contains
the words "Organized 1891"
which, in all their wisdom and cost
cutting calculations (no doubt
spurred on by some underem
ployed management consultant),
the Board of Trustees has revised
to "1891."
I wouldn't want anyone to think
my diploma was a phony. And it
cost me nearly $120,000, so I think
I should be entitled to receive an
updated version.

Davis 'told us a bold-faced lie'
As the California recall effort
winds its way through the courts, I
think readers should clearly under
stand why there was a recall and
also understand how the voters of
California were really insulted.
The recall started because the
governor hid the facts from the
people during his reelection cam
paign. He told voters that the bud
get deficit was in the neighborhood
of $2O billion when he knew it was
much larger. He told voters that
the $2O billion was primarily due to
the national recession and the en
ergy crisis.
Only after winning reelection
did he tell voters the truth: The
deficit was nearly double what he
said it was. There was nearly anoth
er $lB billion that couldn't be ex
plained by external factors. More
over, his ego was so over-inflated
that he only waited a week after
winning to let us know that he was
lying through his teeth.
Finally, Davis didn't exactly win
by a landslide, and his competition
wasn't particularly challenging.
Against a particularly ill-run cam
paign by Bill Simon, Davis only
won with a margin of 500,000 votes
less than 10 percent of ballots
cast. In the eyes of those seeking to
recall the governor, had Davis told
the truth about the state's financial
condition, he would have lost.
The insult to the voters of Cali
fornia is that Governor Davis told
us a bold-faced lie about his ability
to manage the state's finances, and
then had the gall to tell us that he
lied just a week after he'd pulled his
stunt.
