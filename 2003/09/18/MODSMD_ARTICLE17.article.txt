# MARTEN MADNESS
## Late for a double-date with my surprise roommates 
### 
I had anticipated this moment for years.
After slogging my way through a dizzying
array of high school classes, standardized tests
and extracurricular activities, I was finally
about to begin
the college ex-

penence.
On frosh
move-in day
as I sped north
from my
hometown,
Santa Bar
bara, on High
way 101, my
mind filled
with specula
tion about
what my new
life would be
like. My

angst-driven pondering was nothing
new Stanford, as you all know, is kind
enough to give students plenty of time to
torture themselves with such anticipatory
thoughts.
My friends had all departed for their re
spective colleges in the closing weeks of
August, while I was left anxious and alone
for another month until I packed my bags
and said goodbye to my parents. What's
more, my high school friends were already
chummy with their roommates-to-be by
mid-summer courtesy of phone calls and
Internet correspondence. But things are not
so at Stanford: Until arrival day, I was com
pletely clueless as to whom I would be liv
ing with during my first year of college.
I pulled onto Palm Drive at around 4:15
p.m., a good 45 minutes before freshman

check-in was scheduled to close. Much to
my surprise and in stark contrast to Ori
entation information packets that featured
shots of smiling masses of Orientation vol
unteers I found nothing to greet me but
a banner tiredly proclaiming "Welcome to
Stanford" as it flapped idly in the breeze.
My new home looked deserted. Where
were the housing staff members that were
supposed to cheer as I strode up the sidewalk
to check in? Where were the hordes of fresh
men that I was supposed to get to know?
The Orientation packet had said that
check-in posts would remain open from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., but apparently every single
other incoming freshman in predictable
overachiever fashion had arrived in the

early hours of the morning. I couldn't believe
it: Only the first day and I already felt behind.
When 1 finally tracked down a key
bearing resident assistant, I raced down the
hall to check out my new digs. Nametags
spelling out the life history of my new
roommates wallpapered the door.
As a Californian, one of the things that
excited me most about going to Stanford
was the opportunity to meet people from
across the globe or at least, the country.
Unfortunately, my roommates were from
the states of California and Oregon. I had
been dreaming discussions infused with in
ternational perspectives, but I hadn't man
aged to make it off the West Coast.
I swung open the door. The room was

deserted. Only later that evening when my
roommates returned, I soon understood
that geographic origin was not the only im
portant determinant in establishing "who"
a person is. While they were both "left
coasters" like me, the three of us bore little
resemblance to each other one was a
communication major who aspired to write
films, the other was human biology and
philosophy double major who aimed to be
come a doctor. 1â€” a political science
major intent on going to law school
completed the trio. Surprisingly, two years
later, these are still our plans.
Despite our home states, our trio was
quite diverse. Happily enough, our dissim
ilarities promoted dialogue rather than in
spired unpleasant conflict.
In retrospect, not knowing anything
about my roommates prior to arrival al
lowed me to meet my two freshman-year
companions with an open mind. I was able
to get to know each of them for who they
truly were, rather than having a month to
analyze their personalities and character
traits based on a dossier from the housing
office, a late-night Internet instant-mes
sage conversation and a few phone calls.
On Friday, Sept. 21, 20011 learned two
lessons that I have not yet forgotten: Some
times it's best to wait until a face-to-face
meeting before forming a first impression;
and more importantly, I learned to arrive at
an important event like the first day of col
lege earlier than 4:15 p.m.
