# NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER
## I'm Packing my bags for Junior Orientation, mate 
### 
It's 7 a.m. The back-to-school butter
flies are fluttering in my stomach. Airplane
tickets in hand, I glance into my backpack
and make sure that all is ready. Laptop?
Check. Reading material? Check. Wet-

suit? Check.
Anxiety?
Check. Ner
vousness?
Check.
Hey! What's
that doing in
my bag? After
all, I'm not a
frosh, green
and raw as the
fresh-cut grass
in Wilbur
Field. I've al
ready gone
through the
joys of being

dropped off by my parents in an empty in
stitutional-like room, with ten boxes and a
bike, eager as a beaver to live the life of a
college student. I've lived through Intro
duction to the Humanities, the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric and the whole declar
ing-your-major-thing ... yeah, I'm a sea
soned Stanfordian.
So what in the world could these loaded
feelings be doing in the bottom of my pack,
taking up precious space in my meager two
pieces of luggage as I get ready for this fall
quarter? And why the wetsuit? Sure, the
pools at the Avery Aquatic Center and Roble
Gym are chilly sometimes, but they're not
that cold.
Both of these feelings, you see, have the

same cause. I'm stepping out of the careful
ly crafted safety nets of the Farm. I'm hop
ping (think kangaroo-style) off to Oz
Land a.k.a. Australia. I'm joining about
49 other Stanford students, mostly incoming
juniors and seniors, for the kick-off year of
the Stanford Overseas Studies Program in
Australia.

This program is one of the only real over
seas options for us Bio / Humßio / EarthSys
majors. And the Overseas name is the only
thing the program has in common with the
other overseas centers. Rather than staying
in one city and taking classes at the local uni
versities or at a Stanford center, I will spend
this fall driving, diving and flying up and
down the Aus
tralian coast, —————

staying on is
lands, in hostels
and at the Uni
versity of
Queensland
housing. That's
a lot of
traveling
hence the paltry
two packs.

I'm slightly apprehensive. Believe me,
the excitement is definitely there, but
there's a feeling of the great unknown lurk
ing within me that has left me a little ner
vous about the entire experience.

The freshmen who arrived at Stanford
today know what I'm talking about more
than any of my classmates. You had the
same kind of feeling this morning as you
drove up to the Stanford campus. You have
only an inkling about what the entire Stan-

ford package is about: You've read, as any
good prospective freshman would have,
"Approaching Stanford," and you might
have even gone to Admit Weekend and
chatted it up with your room host and
house hosts.

Yet you and I both know that although
you played it cool earlier today when you
first walked through those Freshman /
Sophomore College or Otero dorm halls,
flashing the ".what's up! I feel perfectly at
home here" smile to your newfound friends,
your heart was thumping like the Energizer
Bunny the entire time and it still is. You
simply don't know exactly what to expect,
and Stanford has plenty of surprises up its

Cardinal sleeve.
Stop com
plaining, I bet
you're thinking.
You get to dive
into the marine
blue depths of
the coral reefs,
discover the
rich Ozzie
coastal forests

and shop and
stroll in the streets of Sydney (Yes! A quar
ter away from the [nonexistent] Palo Alto
social scene!). Oh-so-true, and I absolute
ly cannot wait for fall quarter to start.
But please, don't abandon me yet! I want
you to be there with me this quarter as I soak
up the sun (it's going to be spring here), pick
up the Ozzie lingo, taste the Vegemite (a tra
ditional yeast-like spread) and absorb the
mellow Australian culture (hang loose,
mate). I'll be part of the pack of lab rats of

this Stanford experiment its been
stamped and approved so please wish me
luck that all goes well.
As for you, my Stanford-bound mates, I
offer you a few words of wisdom: The col
lege experience does not necessarily take
place within the walls Building 360 or in the
computer clusters of Sweet Hall. Stanford
can offer you and I some unbelievably rich
educational opportunities you just have
to find them.

You may not fancy wandering through
the land of Oz studying marine biology, but
you might land an amazing business intern
ship in Germany through the Berlin Over
seas program or perhaps you'll find yourself
working alongside top-notch Psychology
professors in what may be the next experi
ment-of-the-century.
But none of this will be handed to you on
a silver platter, as the folks at that other insti
tution across the Bay would like to think.
You have to look for these golden eggs
and be advised: The goose will not come
knocking at your door.
Although I won't be on campus to help
you find the Golden Ticket or to discuss the
iiber-extremely-important issues that I'm
sure we are all dying to dive into, I hope to
offer a perspective of the Stanford life out
side of the rolling hills of Silicon Valley. So
come along, mate, and enjoy the ride.

None of this will be handed to
you on a silver platter; as the folks
at the other institution across the
Bay would like to think.
