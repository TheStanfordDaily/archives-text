## Paradise lost: Student life in the Stanford bubble 
### 
So, Class 0f2007, are you welcomed-out yet? I certainly wouldn't
blame you; Orientation Week's itinerary is tiring enough without
having to deal with jet lag and your entire family nipping at your
heels.
I vaguely remember going to a few welcome events my freshman

year "Improving Your Study
Habits!" and "Declaring a Major!" I
found them too generic to be truly help
ful, but my mom enjoyed them. Looking
back, I realize there ought to be a seminar
telling freshmen and transfers what they
really need to know: The honest break
down (hold the pep) of Stanford social
life.
To understand the unique microcosm
that is Stanford society, first take a look
the campus itself: Sun-dappled, dotted
with superfluous fountains, its foliage
manicured to country club perfection.
It's so beautiful here; you never want
to leave! Which is great because, without
a car, you can't. EVER.
Of course, I'm only joking. The al-

ways-buzzing city of San Francisco is a stone's throw away —just
take the Marguerite, Stanford's good-in-theory shittle, I mean shut
tle, to the Caltrain station and board a train to the crappiest, remotest
part of the city (4th and King).
It's not so hard really, not on weekdays, that is. Caltrain is closed
for construction on weekends because who actually wants to go to
San Francisco on a Saturday ? On the weekend, Caltrain offers an "al
ternate busing route," an option that's as efficient and luxurious as it
sounds.
If you can't make it to San Francisco, you can easily spend a night
out on the town ... of Palo Alto. Now, I'm from Sacramento, the

easy-to-ignore state capitol, where cow-tipping and heirloom toma
toes entertain folk long after basketball season ends, and even I think
Palo Alto sucks. It's small, boring and expensive, and the mean age
of its residents is 67.
Since getting off this sprawling campus is fairly difficult, there's
no safety valve for bored Stanford students, pressurizing social life
into densely packed pockets on campus. The CoHo and Treehouse
get ridiculously crowded on Friday nights, Sigma Chi's dubiously
named "penthouse" overflows with freshmen and Everclear-spiked
jungle juice on Thursdays; whenever its houses open their doors, the
Row is as congested as San Francisco's meatpacking district.
There are definite advantages to this social insularity: You are
rarely in physical danger (so long as you stay away from the jungle
juice, that is); getting back to your room to sleep or to hook-up is a
snap; and you are surrounded by talented, intelligent, sometimes
good-looking, students. There is a genuine sense of community at
Stanford as a result, especially among the regular partyers, who begin
to silently acknowledge each other by the end of autumn quarter.
The number of amazing, funny and interesting people milling
around, just waiting to be met, is the best part of student life. Even if
there is nowhere to go and nothing to do on a given night (which isn't
common, but still happens way too often), you can count on your dor
mmates for entertainment. My favorite memories from the last two
years don't necessarily involve wild parties or trips to the city, but they
always include my closest friends. You'll find that fun nights rarely are
contingent upon the setting, more often it's the company that matters.
Exchanging numbers and screennames with new friends, making
up obnoxious dorm cheers, having long conversations extolling the
glories of UNIX without fear of public humiliation all this helps
offset the claustrophobia of the bubble. Sure, it's annoying to hear my
friends at Ivies talk about nights filled with bar-hopping and club
hopping, only to regale them with tales of common room-hopping,
but 1 still wouldn't call Stanford's social scene boring.
We have fun here, but it's our own brand of fun it's "Bubble-
Fun."
