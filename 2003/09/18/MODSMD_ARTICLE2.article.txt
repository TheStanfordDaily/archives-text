# FROSH ARRIVE
## Orientation starts today for the Class 0f 2007 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Tina Chen will probably be surprised, and perhaps a lit
tle embarrassed, when she hears the Branner staff yell out her name
as she arrives for the New Student Orientation check-in today. She
can rest assured, though, that her residence staff, along with over 160
Orientation volunteers, is doing its best to make her feel welcome.
New Student Orientation, which kicks off today and ends on
Tuesday, is comprised of hundreds of events meant to prepare this
year's large, diverse group of freshmen and transfer students for
Stanford.
The class of 2007 has 1,644 freshman and 81 transfer students, ac
cording to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet.
The incoming students represent 49 states, the District of Columbia
and 51 countries. The admissions staff, which includes deans, direc
tors and counselors who spend several months each year sorting
through applications and making difficult decisions, has brought to
gether a class with ethnic and racial diversity similar to last year's, ac
cording to Mamlet.
"But diversity for this class," Mamlet said, "and the campus as a
whole, means more than narrow geographic, racial and ethnic differ
ences. This class is enriched by diversity of all kinds at every level, in
cluding cultural, socio-economic, religious, intellectual and life-ex
perience."
Chen recalled her visit to Stanford last spring-during admit week
end, when prospective freshman traditionally tour the campus. "It
was exciting to see a lot of diversity and meet my new class," Chen

said. "I know everyone will have
different interests than I do, and
I'm excited to meet them and to
learn a lot from talking to them."
According to junior Will
O'Neill, Orientation is supposed to
built off that experience-in terms of
familiarizing the new class to Stan
ford culture. "[lt's] about creating
friendships, a class pride environ
ment and introducing [new stu
dents] to academics," O'Neill said.
The Orientation events planned

for this weekend include favorites
like MuFuUnSun (Music and Fun
Under the Sun), a capella perfor
mances and Faces, a diversity
themed production held in Memor
ial Auditorium, plus two new main
events.
"We're going to have a new
event called 'Cardinal Fan 101,'"
said O'Neill. "It's held in the foot
ball stadium and is designed to cre
ate more spirit and to let the incom
ing class know how much of a pres
ence our athletic community is and
how much they need our support."
Additionally, this year's Orien
tation featured the Stanford Pre-
Orientation Trip last weekend, a

retreat in the Sierra Nevada for
transfer students.
"It's new for us, but really old for
a lot of other universities," O'Neill
said. "We opened it up for transfer
students to start with as a way of
meeting and getting to know other
transfers. If and when we open it up
to freshmen, it'll be another way of
getting to know your classmates."
O'Neill said both transfer stu
dents and incoming freshmen re
ceive great benefit from Orienta
tion, "not only as a preparation for
the academics, but also as a way to
get involved with the extra-curricu
lar facets on campus."
Chen, who played varsity tennis

and worked on the school newspa
per in high school, is interested in
finding out what Stanford has to
offer.
"Hopefully I can find new pas
sions and interests," she said. "I'm
looking forward to taking classes I
couldn't take in high school - like
psychology or an art history semi
nar."
According to Mamlet, part of
Stanford's appeal to incoming stu
dents is that it is "unique in its range
of excellences and in the breadth
and depth of opportunities avail
able specifically to undergraduates.
"As with each incoming class,
these students are excited about

taking advantage of the many op
portunities available to them at
Stanford and have outstanding ex
periences and backgrounds that
will allow them to flourish here,"
Mamlet continued. "Success at
Stanford is largely self-defined,
however, and students have amaz
ing resources available to help
them realize their personal defini
tion of success."
Orientation aims to help stu
dents realize their personal goals
and interests and to help them "cre
ate a sense of class identity that will
last all four years," O'Neill said.
It's a daunting task for one
weekend: make new friends, adjust

to a new environment and start
preparing for a new phase of one's
life - all while preparing for classes
to start in less than week.
Despite whatever worries the in
coming class may have, Mamlet
said, "The extraordinary strength
and depth of all the applicants ap
plying to Stanford continues to as
tound me. That the students we are
welcoming to campus emerged in
our pool testifies to their wonderful
successes and future potential."
Added Chen: "I sort of know
what passions I have in life, and I
want to pursue them even further.
Hopefully Stanford will help me
become a better person."
