# FROSH ARRIVE
## Orientation starts today for the Class 0f 2007 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Tina Chen will probably be surprised, and perhaps a lit
tle embarrassed, when she hears the Branner staff yell out her name
as she arrives for the New Student Orientation check-in today. She
can rest assured, though, that her residence staff, along with over 160
Orientation volunteers, is doing its best to make her feel welcome.
New Student Orientation, which kicks off today and ends on
Tuesday, is comprised of hundreds of events meant to prepare this
year's large, diverse group of freshmen and transfer students for
Stanford.
The class of 2007 has 1,644 freshman and 81 transfer students, ac
cording to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet.
The incoming students represent 49 states, the District of Columbia
and 51 countries. The admissions staff, which includes deans, direc
tors and counselors who spend several months each year sorting
through applications and making difficult decisions, has brought to
gether a class with ethnic and racial diversity similar to last year's, ac
cording to Mamlet.
"But diversity for this class," Mamlet said, "and the campus as a
whole, means more than narrow geographic, racial and ethnic differ
ences. This class is enriched by diversity of all kinds at every level, in
cluding cultural, socio-economic, religious, intellectual and life-ex
perience."
Chen recalled her visit to Stanford last spring-during admit week
end, when prospective freshman traditionally tour the campus. "It
was exciting to see a lot of diversity and meet my new class," Chen
