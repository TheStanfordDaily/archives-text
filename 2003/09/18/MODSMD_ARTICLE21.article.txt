# University washes out planned laundry policy
## 
### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
Most students will return to cam
pus under the impression that there
will be a flat, $2B laundry fee added
onto their University bills in place
of the previous pay-as-you-go sys
tem, after an announcement last
spring by the ASSU and Housing
and Dining Services.
But the decision has been over
turned, according to officials from
both organizations. An e-mail will
be sent out at the end of this week,
explaining to students that dollar
per-laundry machines will continue
in dorms-for now.
Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector of student housing, explained
that bad timing and lack of sufficient
student input were at the root of the
policy reversal. He cited two reasons
why the flat rate system fell through.
First, once the decision to use a
flat rate had been made, it became
evident that there hadn't been
enough discussion with the student
body. The ASSU presented their
proposal for a flat laundry fee to
wards the end of spring quarter, and
in the period between the proposal
and the end of school, Housing and
Dining Services could not have ad
dressed all student concerns that
could have surfaced given a larger
window of time.
Second, Housing and Dining
Services received a flood of e-mails
from students who raised concerns

and presented interesting questions
about the new system, Whitney
said. After considering the issues
raised by these e-mails, Housing
and Dining Services and the ASSU
jointly decided that the issue "need
ed more discussion."
At the end of spring quarter,
Housing and Dining Services and
the ASSU drafted a letter explain
ing the issue, but time ran out be
fore a final draft could be sent to all
students.
Despite this, officials at Housing
and Dining Services remain recep
tive to the idea of a flat laundry fee.
"We want to do something to
â– help the students," Whitney said.
"[The system] needs to be some
thing the students really want," and
according to Whitney, the e-mails
he received suggested that this new
system still had some flaws to be
worked out before a successful im
plementation could be achieved.
ASSU Vice President Joey Na
toli explained that the idea has not
been dropped; rather, the decision
to switch to a new laundry system
will be put off "until more studies
are done."
Students have been less than
unanimous in their response to the
news that a flat fee will not be im
plemented this year.
"Free laundry is a bad idea," said
sophomore Sihong Chan. "People
would abuse it."
Some students were indifferent
and just want the system, whatever it

is, to save them money. Davis Reiss,
a sophomore, explained that how he
feels about the system depends on
how much he does laundry.
"If it's cheaper, it's cool," he
said.
However, some students feel
that the flat fee is the best way to go,
and some are upset about the new,
smaller washing machines in dorms
like Stern Hall.
"Things aren't supposed to get
worse," said sophomore Scott
Thompson, commenting on the
smaller capacity of the new ma
chines in the Donner basement.
Representatives from Housing
and Dining Services said a survey
will come out this fall that will make
sure that all student concerns are
identified and addressed.
Natoli added that the ASSU has
two priorities in developing a new
laundry system: saving the students
money and maximizing convenience.
"The ultimate goal is to reduce
the cost of living for students," he
said. The proposed system had
some flaws, but the ASSU will work
with Housing and Dining Services
to ensure the best possible system
for all students, he said.
Whitney still believes that the
"vast majority" of students favor a
one-fee system, and he will work
with the ASSU this fall to verify
that.
"We just need a little more infor
mation," he said. "We want to do
this the right way."

The proposed laundry policy, which would have charged students a flat per-quarter rate for the use of university
laundry machines, has been delayed indefinitely due to a lack of sufficient student input.
