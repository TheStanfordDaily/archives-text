# Schools may enable file-sharing
## 
### EMIR SENTURK Brown Daily Herald 
(U-WIRE) - Students at colleges and universi
ties across the nation may soon be able to
download digital music legally over their
schools' networks as early as this spring - but
they'll have to pay to do it.
File sharing is placing a burden on many
schools' networks, causing slowdowns and out
ages at a time when the recording industry is
cracking down on illegal file sharing.
Students arriving on campus this year at
Northeastern University and Boston College
took part in discussions during their orienta
tion periods about the legal hazards and
moral implications of file sharing over the
Internet.
Administrators at Brown also revamped the
University's network access policy over the

summer in an effort to drive down costs of ram
pant file-sharing activity.
But Pennsylvania State University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
among several schools that see the problem in a
different light. Both schools may launch their
own music distribution programs within the
academic year.
Penn State President Graham Spanier
envisions the school as making "what is now
illegal legal" by licensing songs from digital
music providers, making them available to
students via download and then tacking on
a certain sum of money to each student's
bill, he told the Boston Globe earlier this
month.
At MIT, though no specifics of any such pro
gram are available to the public yet, a decision
is in the process of being made.
McGovern added that active monitoring of

the campus network is not the norm at MIT, as
is generally the case at Brown.
Northeastern's Information Technology Se
curity Manager Glenn Hill does not see any
need for a similar program on Northeastern's
campus, even though the school has investigat
ed 20 or so copyright infringements in the past
eight months, he said.
"We simply haven't seen students making
the case, and we do things regarding [informa
tion technology] here based on what it is that
the students ask for," Hill said. Citing the cost
ly implications of a campus-based music distri
bution service, Hill stressed the importance of
gauging student interest.
"There's a preponderance of the preference
to not pay for music so long as it can be ac
quired without paying for it. The students are
content to handle music sharing on their own,"
he said, sidered.
