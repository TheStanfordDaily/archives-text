# New dean to manage row
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to extend academic
guidance and mentorship to students
living on the Row, the University
created a new dean's position this
summer to supplement the residen
tial education program. Prof. Eliza
beth Bernhardt received an appoint
ment for dean of the row, where she
will provide a faculty presence for
the 19 Row houses south and east of
Campus Drive.
Of the 1,600 students living on the
Row, about 600 are undeclared
sophomores. The University created
the new position in part because it
felt that students on the Row needed
more residential support in selecting
majors, developing honors theses
and obtaining general academic sup
port.
"When the freshmen move onto
campus, they receive very extensive
advising assistance," Bernhardt said.
"However, when many sophomores
move onto the Row, they do not
have a sufficient academic support
network. They need this network of
support as they progress toward de-

daring majors."
Before her appointment, Bern
hardt also served as chair of the Sub
committee on Residential Education
and Advising, where she reviewed
the challenges of advising sopho
mores and providing them with an
adequate educational support.
According to a press release from
Jane Camariho, director of Residen
tial Education, the goals of the new
appointment include "developing a
sustained and visible presence for
students living in 19 designated Row
houses." Although the University
plans to "initially target sopho
mores," it will "consider ways of of
fering academic resources that might
also be valuable to juniors and se
niors." The University also hopes
that this initiative will encourage
sophomores to declare their majors
by the end of the year.
Bernhardt and her husband will
soon assume residence at 579 Al
varado Row. As the first part of her
plan, Bernhardt looks forward to
inviting the residents of each of the
19 houses located south and east of
Campus Drive to individual dinners
at her new home.

"The intention of the dinners is to
try to get a sense of the personality of
each house and to meet individual
students," Bernhardt said. "I hope to
use these meetings to gain ideas for
events throughout the rest of the
year, including dinners with faculty
members and celebratory events for
students who have declared majors
or written honors theses."
In addition to her new appoint
ment, Bernhardt, a professor in Ger
man Studies, will continue to teach
and to direct the Language Center.
Bernhardt joined the faculty in 1995,
and according to Camarillo, since
2001 she has been "working with fac
ulty affiliates and program staff for
the language and culture houses."
Bernhardt also teaches "Letters and
Diaries of Resistance in Nazi Ger
many," a course offered through
Sophomore College.
"I'm thrilled to do this because I
love Stanford students," Bernhardt
said. "I've made a lot of really won
derful connections with sophomores
through Sophomore College, and I
truly love watching them progress
through the rest of their years here at
Stanford."
