# Transfer students head for the hills
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Thirty transfer students returned to campus
last night after spending five days in "Desola
tion Wilderness," where they participated in
the inaugural Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip.
SPOT is an experimental outdoor education
program based on those offered at some of
Stanford's peer institutions. Students spent
time away for the campus learning about Stan
ford and getting to know other students better
while camping and hiking.
Sarah Rubinfeld, a graduate student in civil
and environmental engineering, and junior
Sarah Schulman approached Director of New
Student Orientation Jared Scherer last year
about starting an outdoors pre-Orientation
program.
"The program has been a collaboration
from the start," Rubinfeld said. "The Office of
Freshmen and Transfer Students was interest
ed in starting a program but lacked the neces
sary wilderness skills. Sarah Schulman and I
are experienced wilderness leaders but had no

idea how to go about getting a program run
ning at Stanford. They contacted us looking for
advice, we convinced them it was feasible to
start this year, and the program has grown
from there."
SPOT is modeled after the programs at sev
eral other schools such as Dartmouth, Prince
ton and Williams.
"It struck me as curious that we didn't offer
a similar program at Stanford," Scherer said.
"I have always wondered why this program
didn't exist at Stanford," Rubinfeld agreed.
"Outdoor activities are very popular on cam
pus and we're located within a few hours of
some spectacular wilderness areas. It seemed
like a natural fit."
Since the original pitching of the concept,
Rubinfeld and Schulman have been working
closely with the NSO office to plan the trip.
"SPOT is essentially a mosaic - we looked
at several different programs and borrowed
the pieces that fit our vision the best," Rubin
feld said. "The most unusual thing about SPOT
is its current focus on transfer students, a pop
ulation that is typically under-served by uni

versity programs."
Ten upperclassmen and young alumni were
selected as guides following a substantial appli
cation process that included a detailed ques
tionnaire and an in-person interview. Candi
dates were evaluated on their wilderness skills,
leadership skills and general enthusiasm for
the program. Those chosen then participated
in series of training workshops leading up to
their trips.
The guides were carefully selected because
they provide an important first glimpse of the
Stanford experience to the transfer students.
They led transfer students in team-building ac
tivities, as well as helping them with backpack
ing basics such as pitching tents and preparing
packs
"Trip leaders also serve as a resource for
honest information and advice about Stan
ford," Rubinfeld said.
The excursion began Friday night with a
campout on FloMo field and ended last night
with the transfers' return from an area in the
Sierra Mountains known as "Desolation
Wilderness".

"The wilderness is an ideal place for an ori
entation program because it strips away all of
the distractions." Rubinfeld said. "It gives par
ticipants a chance to meet and become friend
ly with other new students they might never
have met on campus."
"Succeeding at the challenge of a backpack
ing trip gives participants confidence in their
ability to succeed at college," Rubinfeld con
tinued. "It's also a lot of fun."
The 30 transfer students returned in time to
participate in all of Orientation.
Any transfer who wanted to attend SPOT
was accommodated, and the goal is ultimately
to allow incoming freshmen to participate in
SPOT as well.
"We hope someday that we'll be able to roll
this out to the entire incoming class - transfers
and freshmen," Scherer said.
"We are also interested in providing a wider
range of pre-orientation activities ... although
we anticipate it may take several years before
we have the resources to run a program of that
size," Rubinfeld said.
