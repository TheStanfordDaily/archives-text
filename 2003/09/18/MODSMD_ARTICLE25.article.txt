# Honors College offers head start on theses
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
More than 130 seniors from 20 different
departments have returned to campus early
this year for Summer Honors College, a
program that gives students writing honors
theses a chance to come back to campus be
fore their peers and get to work.
Given three weeks to concentrate on
their theses as well as writing and research
workshops, the college can be a helpful re
source the approximately 30 percent of
graduating seniors who complete a thesis
each year.
"I have lots of anecdotal evidence that
Honors College helps students enormously
with both their planning and writing of an
honors thesis," said Susie Brubaker-Cole,
director of undergraduate research pro
grams. "It also makes the process more fun
and less lonely by providing community."
Honors College is a program for rising
seniors participating in departmental or in
terdisciplinary honors program and is man
aged by Undergraduate Research Programs

and academic departments that deal with
the theses. It was first launched in 1993 with
28 students as part of the Bing Teaching Ini
tiative. Students apply in the spring through
their honors department. For this reason,
yearly acceptance rates vary from admitting
all interested students to about half,
Brubaker-Cole said.
"I don't think that I would have been
able to write an honors thesis had I not gone
to Honors College," said senior Jennifer
Porter, whose thesis is about the changing
role of adolescents through the 1970s and its
impact on sex education and legislation.
"They really help you push through all the
challenges. It's always nice to have someone
holding your hand."
Seniors also added that Honors College
helped them better define and refine their
theses.
"I really feel like I have a game plan for
my thesis and I didn't before," said senior
Sabrina Lee, whose thesis is an economic
analysis of international humanitarian law.
"I realized the work I did before was unfo
cused."

Each department organizes the core ac
tivities of the program, - writing and re
search workshops where students work in
small groups with a faculty leader - and
URP organizes the residential educational
component and broader events such as pan
els and lectures on more general topics.
There are workshops, discussions, and
group working sessions on topics such as
how to use libraries and statistical tools, re
search methodologies, help refining re
search questions and structuring the thesis.
Students participating in the program get
free room and board and are housed to
gether, this year in Castano.
The usefulness of the activities also seem
to lie in motivating the seniors to work and
as a forum for personal feedback from fac
ulty and other students.
"It is not like Methodology 101," Lee
said. "We spend a lot of time in workshops
discussing our own research."
Another benefit of the program is having
the support and advice from faculty and
other students writing theses.
"One of the best things about Honors

College is that it puts you with other people
who are writing honors theses. You realize
there are other people with your problems
and worries," Lee said. "Like Alcoholics
Anonymous, it's 'honors theses anony
mous.' No one can tell you what to do, but
they can tell you stories of how other people
have done it. It makes you feel a little bet
ter."
"Having a group to brainstorm ideas
with and also having faculty to let you know
what works and what doesn't [are the best
parts of the program]," Porter said.
The most obvious way in which Honors
College helps students is by giving them
extra time to get a jumpstart on their work.
"I wanted three weeks to work here with
a library and my adviser and without having
anything else on my mind," Lee said. "I've
gotten more stuff down on paper in the first
two weeks here than I've done all sum
mer...l'd be stressed out if I hadn't come to
this."
Besides aiding students with their thesis
work, the program provides the opportuni
ty to meet other seniors and ones with simi

lar academic paths. Lee has appreciated the
sense of community and being a part of a
group within her department.
"It's not Senior Pub Night, but it's a fun
way to meet other seniors," she said.
Honors College provides students time
and resources to concentrate on their thesis
as well as a community of peers and faculty
to support them.
"It provides an invaluable opportunity
for concentrated research and an exciting
intellectual atmosphere," said Hilton
Obenzinger, associate director of URP for
Honors College. "Stanford encourages all
kinds of research experiences, and to have
such a concentrated experience under the
guidance of faculty in a small-group envi
ronment can solidify a student's commit
ment to their research."
"Most seniors who undertake a thesis
have never written anything longer than 30
pages or so," Brubaker-Cole said. "Re
search and writing is a difficult process?
even for the most celebrated and accom
plished faculty members. Undergraduates
deserve this kind of support."

The usefulness of the activities also seem
to lie in motivating the seniors to work and
as a forum for personal feedback from fac
ulty and other students.
"It is not like Methodology 101," Lee
said. "We spend a lot of time in workshops
discussing our own research."
Another benefit of the program is having
the support and advice from faculty and
other students writing theses.
"One of the best things about Honors

College is that it puts you with other people
who are writing honors theses. You realize
there are other people with your problems
and worries," Lee said. "Like Alcoholics
Anonymous, it's 'honors theses anony
mous.' No one can tell you what to do, but
they can tell you stories of how other people
have done it. It makes you feel a little bet
ter."
"Having a group to brainstorm ideas
with and also having faculty to let you know
what works and what doesn't [are the best
parts of the program]," Porter said.
The most obvious way in which Honors
College helps students is by giving them
extra time to get a jumpstart on their work.
"I wanted three weeks to work here with
a library and my adviser and without having
anything else on my mind," Lee said. "I've
gotten more stuff down on paper in the first
two weeks here than I've done all sum
mer...l'd be stressed out if I hadn't come to
this."
Besides aiding students with their thesis
work, the program provides the opportuni
ty to meet other seniors and ones with simi

lar academic paths. Lee has appreciated the
sense of community and being a part of a
group within her department.
"It's not Senior Pub Night, but it's a fun
way to meet other seniors," she said.
Honors College provides students time
and resources to concentrate on their thesis
as well as a community of peers and faculty
to support them.
"It provides an invaluable opportunity
for concentrated research and an exciting
intellectual atmosphere," said Hilton
Obenzinger, associate director of URP for
Honors College. "Stanford encourages all
kinds of research experiences, and to have
such a concentrated experience under the
guidance of faculty in a small-group envi
ronment can solidify a student's commit
ment to their research."
"Most seniors who undertake a thesis
have never written anything longer than 30
pages or so," Brubaker-Cole said. "Re
search and writing is a difficult process?
even for the most celebrated and accom
plished faculty members. Undergraduates
deserve this kind of support."
