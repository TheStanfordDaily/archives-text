# Students prefer apartments

### DEBRA O'CONNOR KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS 
ST. PAUL, Minn. â€” When
University of Minnesota student
Jade Pirlott was looking for a
place to live last year, she
yearned for a convenient loca
tion, a nice kitchen, a spacious
bedroom, air conditioning and
heated underground parking.
And, after a freshman year
spent sharing facilities with
dozens of dorm residents, she
definitely wanted her own bath
room.
Without having to move off
campus, she found what she want
ed: Riverbend Commons, a new
style of residence hall that serves
as an example of what many of
today's college students - espe
cially upperclassmen - want and
will pay extra to get.
"I think everyone who comes
to college should have the classic
dorm experience," where small,
shared rooms lead to the forced
togetherness that helps freshmen
get on their feet socially, Pirlott
said. Beyond that, though, she
wanted a change.
"This, I don't consider a dorm
at all," she said. "It's small apart
ments."

Following a national trend and
responding to student demand,
most of the residential construc
tion Minnesota has done over the
past several years has been up
scale, from two single bedrooms
connected by a bathroom to
places with full kitchens and liv
ing rooms.
"Students don't want to live in
traditional residence halls any
more, but they don't necessarily
want to live off campus," said
Chad Horsley, Riverbend's
apartment coordinator.
And they're asking for ameni
ties. Riverbend Commons, for
example, has barbecue grills on a
huge patio overlooking the Mis
sissippi River, a party room with
a full kitchen and tables on one
end and a big-screen television
and CD player with surround
sound on the other, basketball
and sand volleyball courts, a
state-of-the-art computer center,
free washers and dryers and an
ice machine. The underground
parking costs an extra $lOO a
month.
The fancier setups cost more:
A triple-occupancy room at tradi
tional U of M residence halls
costs $1,696 per semester; a "Su
per Single" at Riverbend Com

mons costs up to $3,241 per se
mester.
Across the country, "people
are considering residential living
as full service," said Jennie
Robinson, residential life direc
tor at Hamline University in St.
Paul. They want technology, in
cluding card access for security,
Internet service and cable televi
sion. Some colleges eliminate
telephone jacks in the rooms and
give students cell phones.
Students also want co-ed living
- even co-ed bathrooms, kitchens
and living rooms. But, Robinson
said, "I've only heard of a couple
of schools that are doing co-ed
rooms."
And students want a "self-di
rected community," which means
they make their own rules and get
along without a paid staff person
living with them.
Few colleges prohibit mem
bers of the opposite sex from
staying overnight anymore. The
College of St. Catherine in St.
Paul, however, draws the line at 2
a.m.
"We get a lot of students who
complain, but a lot understand
it's about privacy, about the safe
ty of the building, about the mis
sion of the Sisters," said complex

coordinator Sabrina Anderson.
St. Catherine's would like to
keep more upperclassmen on
campus, though, and is consider
ing building more housing. Be
fore construction, they'll listen
carefully to what the mostly fe
male student body wants, Ander
son says.
Women's colleges seem to be
particularly sensitive to the way
students live. In a national stu
dent survey on dormitory quality,
nine of the top 20 "Dorms Like
Palaces" were women's colleges,
with Smith and Bryn Mawr
among the top five. Loyola Col
lege in Baltimore ranked first in
dorm quality in the Princeton Re
view's annual college guide, "The
Best 351 Colleges." The top 20
"Dorms Like Dungeons" are
mostly at state universities.
"Quality-of-life issues have
become serious things for schools
to consider, especially in the re
cruitment process," said Erik
Olson, editor of the Princeton
Review. "It's a key consideration,
especially when a student is look
ing at similarly selective colleges .
. . The amount of money that
schools are sinking into develop
ing bigger, nicer dorms is as
tounding."
