## A 						new direction? Quarterback Chris Lewis loses starting job to redshirt freshman Trent Edwards 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Where did the offense go, and would it ever find its
way back to Palo Alto?

Was the defense learning how to swim or just
sinking? Stanford football's 2002 season left a
lot of questions unanswered.

With just one game under its belt this year,
the picture is not much clearer for the Cardinal.
While other college teams have four games
under their belt, Stanford has only a 31-10 win
over San Jose State on Sept. 6. After a bye last
weekend, this Saturday's tilt against Brigham

Young will be the team's first real test of the
year. It's all part of the fun of a typically
merciless schedule for the Cardinal.

It's difficult to extrapolate much from
the Stanford's performance against San
Jose two weeks ago; after all, last year's
2-9 team thrashed the Spartans 63-26;
this year's team also posted an easy win,
yet lost a scrimmage against Division-II
UC-Davis in August.

Last year, Stanford was plagued by a
poor passing game, as then-freshman Kyle
Matter and oft-injured Chris Lewis shared time
at the helm of a veteran offense that simply
could not stretch the field. The running game
did grind out decent yardage, thanks to a vet
eran offensive line and senior back Kerry
Carter. With just three returning starters,
though, Stanford has a new look on offense
this season.

The most notable part of this makeover
has been the benching of senior Chris Lewis
in favor of redshirt freshman Trent Ed
wards. Edwards has long been Lewis'
anointed successor, but head coach Buddy
Teevens has made a risky move in bench-

ing the senior, Lewis, who has traditional
ly been vocal about his playing time and
his leadership role. Teevens, an excellent
recruiter, is a "player's coach", but his

benching of Lewis shows that Teevens is
resolved to avoid the quarterback merry
go-round and accompanying media second-

guessing that plagued last season if at all possi-

ble. By going to Edwards early, the Cardinal will ideally find a
rhythm that it lacked throughout last year although Teevens
reserves the right to make changes as needed.
"There's great competition at that spot, and our most produc
tive player will continue to play," Teevens said.

This year, the offensive line returns only one starter, senior
tackle Kirk Chambers, and leading rusher Carter has given way to
junior Kenneth Tolon and sophomore J.R. Lemon. A solid, reliable
running game is indispensable to a young quarterback's success, and
while Lemon and Tolon have proven themselves solid, workmanlike
performers, much of their success will be dependent on the resiliency
of a young line that is already charged with protecting a young quar
terback who is bound to experience some growing pains in and out of
the pocket. The unit pulled together nicely last year after injuries
forced several younger players into significant roles, its task will be no
easier this season as the team tries to forge a positive offensive iden
tity.

Across the board, Stanford will continue to rotate in a large num
ber of players, and Teevens' depth chart will continue to change on a
weekly basis. The players have taken to this system, despite the un
certainty it engenders.
"I think it's good, actually," junior linebacker Jared Newberry
said. "It builds a lot of competition, so you don't get complacent. You
have to come out and perform every day in practice, and that prepares

you even more for the game."
With Luke Powell (12 receptions against the Spartans) finally
healthy and leading a talented receiving corps that includes impact
freshman Mark Bradford and skilled pass-catching tight ends Brett
Pierce and Alex Smith, the brunt of the offensive pressure falls on Ed
wards' young shoulders. Perhaps to compensate for this, the playbook
now incorporates more running plays.
"Instead of our offense being run off the pass, now it's probably
more pass off the run, a lot more play-action stuff," Lemon said.
Last year, after strong performances against Boston College and
San Jose State, Matter had the fifth-best passer rating in all of Divi
sion-I football. He now finds himself relegated to the third string,

behind the unproven Edwards and the once-heralded Lewis, who
looked so effective under former head coach Tyrone Willingham.
Despite a disappointing couple of years, though, Lewis and

his teammates have come to accept the quarterback situation
for what it is.

"[Lewis has] been solid, his attitude has been every
thing we'd hoped for," Teevens said.
The Cardinal as a whole is getting along well in
k the locker room.

"Our team chemistry right now is probably
the highest I've ever seen it," Lemon said.
"[Senior leadership] is very important for
team chemistry, and we have that this year."

First-year, first-time offensive co
ordinator David Kelly will try to keep
Stanford from bogging down like it

did last year, while former Col-

orado coordinator A.J.
Christoff, also new to

Teevens' staff, will
join the return-

i n g
Tom

Williams as
co-defensive co
ordinator.

Ten of the 11 defensive
starters logged significant

playing time in 2002, and the

unit should have a cohesiveness that it often
lacked as it went through growing pains en
masse last season.
"For most of the guys on our team
last year, the entire season was a learning
experience," Newberry said. "I think last
year, some of the guys were playing not to
mess up, not to win. That's something I

learned personally, that you can't just play
not to mess up."
The defensive line remains packed

with talented performers like junior
Amon Gordon, but will need to do a bet
ter job of getting to the quarterback than
they have in the past.
"We did not have a lot of Quarter-

back sacks, and we'd like to harass the
QB as often as possible," Teevens said.
The defensive secondary is led by last

year's standout defender, safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe, and impressive sophomore T.J. Rush
ing, whose quickness and playmaking ability

turned heads last year as a true freshman.
They'll be under a lot of pressure all season
long in the pass-happy Pac-10.
The linebacking corps re-

turns in its entirety. Its success may de
pend on whether two of its most talented
players, sophomores Jon Alston and
Michael Craven, can win back playing

time and make a bigger impact.
The defense looked promising last
year, making a lot of solid plays punc-

tuated by costly errors; for the Car
dinal to be successful this year, it
will need to tighten up. It is unlike
ly to shut down its opponents, but,
as it showed at times last year, if it
can avoid mental lapses, it can
keep things close.
Special Teams
Improved special teams play
would do a lot to enable the of
fense and take some heat off of
the oft-beleaguered defense. A
healthier Michael Sgroi returns
as kicker and Eric Johnson as
punter, and a healthy Powell
should do a lot to spark the Car
dinal's return game, although
the Cardinal coaching staff cur
rently feel that special teams
need some fine-tuning.
The Coaching
And then there's Teevens. He

brought in an excellent recruit
ing class and emphasized perfor
mance over seniority through
out the depth chart. But he's still
betting on the same system -
having replaced departed of
fensive coordinator Mike San
ford with his receivers coach,
Kelly, and sticking with
Williams as co-defensive coordi
nator. The Cardinal does,
though, make year-to-year ad
justments depending on its play
ers' strengths and weaknesses.
"You adjust and modify with
each class that comes in ... we
try to mold our offensive and de
fensive attacks around our per
sonnel," Teevens said. "The
main thing is put your players in
the position to have success. It's
been embraced by the squad, the
staff, it's really a joint effort
where everyone is contributing
to what we feel is the best offen
sive scheme, the best defensive
scheme, [and] special teams
scheme."

Coming on the heels of an exas
perating two-win campaign,
everyone - from the coaches to
the players to the administrators
to the fans - believes that Stan
ford can and should do better.
And, accordingly, the Cardinal's
performance this season will be
particularly influential on the
direction of the Stanford pro
gram.
That doesn't mean, though,
that the Cardinal is preoccupied
with thoughts and questions
about the future.
"[There is] a good quote that
Coach Kelly gave us," Lemon
said. " 'Players play, coaches
coach, and officials officiate.
And when those things cross up,
that's when you run into prob
lems.' So as a player, I think my
job is, when I get on the field, to
do whatever I can to make
something happen, and every
thing else, I can't concern myself
with, because it's really out of
my hands."
