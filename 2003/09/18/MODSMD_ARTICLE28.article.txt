# On a mission to defeat BYU
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the early 19705, Brigham Young University football
head coach LaVell Edwards turned around a lackluster
program by installing a pass-happy offensive system mod
eled on that of Stanford's Rose Bowl teams.
This weekend, the Stanford football team (1-0) heads
to LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo, Utah, as a seven
point underdog in its first meeting with the Cougars (2-1).
The two teams still occasionally display the wide-open of
fensive style that defined them over the past three
decades, but the Cougars and the Cardinal are both try
ing to rebound from seasons in which sub-par passing
games and merry-go-rounds at quarterback doomed
them to losing records.
While BYU is poised to return to the top-echelon of
the Mountain West Conference this season on the
strength of a balanced offense and aggressive defense,
pundits' predictions for Stanford are more pessimistic.
The Cardinal's 31-10 victory over San Jose State in its
season opener was an encouraging sign for a team that
some thought could go winless in Buddy Teevens' second
season as head coach. But the excitement is tempered by
the fact that Stanford drubbed the Spartans by an even
wider margin last year, only to lose eight of its last nine
games to finish with a 2-9 record.
Teevens said he feels this year's team is more prepared
mentally than last year's, with a greater understanding of
the system and better interpersonal chemistry.
"It's a very cohesive group," Teevens said. "It makes it
fun to practice."
Junior linebacker Jared Newberry added, "Last year,
the entire season was a learning experience... The morale
of the team is definitely different than it was last year at
this time."
Saturday's contest will reveal whether the team has
improved enough to succeed against quality competition.
If not, it could be another long year for the Cardinal, as
the schedule ahead is fraught with bowl-caliber oppo
nents.

Coach Buddy Teevens with sophomore Kevin Schimmelmann
at a scrimmage earlier this month.
Stanford enters the game with
redshirt freshman quarterback
Trent Edwards calling the signals
after he outplayed incumbent se
nior Chris Lewis in a season-open
ing 31-10 victory against San Jose
State.
"Our most productive players
will continue to play," Teevens ex
plained. "Trent Edwards will be
our starter, Chris Lewis and Kyle
Matter will be two and three, push
ing [for playing time]."
Edwards, rated by some as the
nation's top quarterback prospect
when he was a senior at Los Gatos
High School, put on a dazzling per
formance against San Jose State.
He completed 21 of 38 passes for
278 yards, including two touch
down tosses to senior flanker Luke

Powell, whose 12-catch perfor
mance added a breakaway threat
that was missing from last year's
offense.
Edwards faces a tougher task
against a BYU team that has far
more talent than the Spartans on the
defensive line and in the secondary.
The Cougars run an unorthodox 3-3-
5 defensive scheme designed to con
fuse and surprise opposing quarter
backs and linemen.
"It's a pressure package, and
they come from a lot of different
areas," Teevens said. "They do a
great job disguising - it puts a lot
of pressure on the quarterback to
discern what coverage scheme
they're actually employing. It chal
lenges your offensive line: Who's
coming? Where are they coming
from?"
Sophomore running back J.R.
Lemon, who gashed the Spartans'
defense for 105 yards and two
touchdowns, said he is looking for

ward to facing the Cougars' de
fense, which limited No. 3 South
ern California to 71 yards rushing
but surrendered 171 yards on the
ground to New Mexico last week
end.
"The thing I like about it is I
feel like our offense can fit it well,"
Lemon said. "We have a lot of dif
ferent screens and things you can
run. It is a very wild defense and
it's kind of built to throw you off."
Offensively, the Cougars' usu
ally prolific passing game has
looked less scary of late.
Following strong outings
against Georgia Tech and South
ern California, it looked like BYU
had found in Matt Berry a starter
worthy of upholding the school's
"quarterback factory" reputation.
But after a lackluster first half
against New Mexico, Berry broke
a bone in his throwing hand and
could miss several weeks.
That leaves the Cougars with

freshman John Beck (l-of-6 on the
season) and junior Todd
Mortensen (8-of-18). BYU head
coach Gary Crowton has named
Beck the starter for this Saturday's
game, though the two have shared
playing time up to this point.
No matter who is behind center
for the Cougars, the Stanford de
fense will likely have its hands full
with an efficient BYU running
game. Last year's starter, junior
Marcus Whalen, returns from in
jury to join reigning Mountain
West Conference Offensive Player
of the Week Reynaldo Brathwaite,
who has racked up 281 yards on 40
carries in Whalen's absence.
"We'll probably start out with
Rey and work Marcus in and see
how it goes," Crowton said.
"Hopefully, they'll give us a good
one-two punch."
For the moment, Stanford's run
defense is nationally ranked, as the
Cardinal locked up the Spartans'

ground game in its first contest.
"Obviously, San Jose State
threw the ball a lot," Teevens said.
"BYU will run the ball more than
San Jose State."
Playing in a noisy stadium that
regularly packs in 65,000 fans at an
elevation of over 4,000 feet, Stan
ford's chances may hinge on the
team's ability to adjust to the hos
tile environment.
The young offensive line, per
haps the squad's most vulnerable
unit, will look to its sole returning
starter from last year, senior tack
le Kirk Chambers, for guidance.
Chambers, who hails from Provo
has established himself as a leader
on the team.
"Kirk Chambers has been phe
nomenal," Teevens said. "Kirk's
the old hand out there. There's a
lot of young players, and he's real
ly helped settle them down, ex
plained situations they've never
encountered before."
