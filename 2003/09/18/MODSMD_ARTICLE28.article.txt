# On a mission to defeat BYU

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the early 19705, Brigham Young University football
head coach LaVell Edwards turned around a lackluster
program by installing a pass-happy offensive system mod
eled on that of Stanford's Rose Bowl teams.
This weekend, the Stanford football team (1-0) heads
to LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo, Utah, as a seven
point underdog in its first meeting with the Cougars (2-1).
The two teams still occasionally display the wide-open of
fensive style that defined them over the past three
decades, but the Cougars and the Cardinal are both try
ing to rebound from seasons in which sub-par passing
games and merry-go-rounds at quarterback doomed
them to losing records.
While BYU is poised to return to the top-echelon of
the Mountain West Conference this season on the
strength of a balanced offense and aggressive defense,
pundits' predictions for Stanford are more pessimistic.
The Cardinal's 31-10 victory over San Jose State in its
season opener was an encouraging sign for a team that
some thought could go winless in Buddy Teevens' second
season as head coach. But the excitement is tempered by
the fact that Stanford drubbed the Spartans by an even
wider margin last year, only to lose eight of its last nine
games to finish with a 2-9 record.
Teevens said he feels this year's team is more prepared
mentally than last year's, with a greater understanding of
the system and better interpersonal chemistry.
"It's a very cohesive group," Teevens said. "It makes it
fun to practice."
Junior linebacker Jared Newberry added, "Last year,
the entire season was a learning experience... The morale
of the team is definitely different than it was last year at
this time."
Saturday's contest will reveal whether the team has
improved enough to succeed against quality competition.
If not, it could be another long year for the Cardinal, as
the schedule ahead is fraught with bowl-caliber oppo
nents.
