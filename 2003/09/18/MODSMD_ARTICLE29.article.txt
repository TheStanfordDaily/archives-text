# Women's volleyball set for new season
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two consecutive appear
ances in the NCAA Championship
game, trips to the final four in seven
of the last nine seasons and a cumu
lative 65-7 record the last two years,
Stanford volleyball fans may be sur
prised to come back to the Farm to
find that their team already has two
losses.
Like in all sports, a team's record
only tells one side of the story. Only
eight games into its 2003 season, the
No. 4 ranked Cardinal's two losses
have come at the hands of the No. 2
and No. 3 ranked teams in the na
tion, Hawaii and Florida, respec
tively. The only team ranked above
the Cardinal that it has not faced is
defending national champion USC,
who beat Stanford in last year's
NCAA finals.
But the Cardinal Volleyball pro
gram does have a tremendous his
tory and has the talent and leader
ship this year to continue that suc
cess. In the past nine years, Stan
ford won four NCAA titles. Its all
time record stands at 707-174-4 and
has failed to rank in the top-10 na
tionally only once in the past 22
years.
"There's always pressure on a

team to do well, and we're not look
ing ahead to the final four or a na
tional championship," junior
Ogonna Nnamani said. "We just
need to turn that pressure into drive
and look from day-to-day on im
proving and playing our best. It was
actually really great for us to face
the top teams in the nation this
early in our season because it
showed us what we need to work on
to be successful this season."
At the helm of the program is
third year head coach John Dun
ning. In his first two seasons with
the Cardinal, Dunning has lead the
squad to the NCAA finals both
years, winning in 2001 and losing to
USC last year. He was named Na
tional Coach of the Year and Pacif
ic 10 Conference Coach of the year
in 2001. He is also only the 21st Di
vision I volleyball coach to reach
the 500-win mark and has amassed
an astonishing 71-9 record with the
Cardinal, including an 11-1 postsea
son record.
"I think that more than anything
else, [Dunning] has really expanded
my game mentally and I've learned
so much," said senior Middle
Blocker Jennifer Harvey. "Since he
came to the team, I've thought so
much more about strategy as op
posed to simply trying to overpow

er teams. We often play the odds
and take chances depending on
what he thinks will help us win each
point."
As the 2003 season is only Dun
ning's third on the Farm, this will be
his first year as the coach of a Stan
ford team that is not lead by Na
tional Player of the Year Logan
Tom. As an outside hitter, Tom
leads the Cardinal in single season
kills (621) and is second in both sin
gle season digs and single season
service aces.
"[Logan] was a huge part of the
team and is a great weapon to have
on the court," Harvey said, "But
we're not trying to compensate for
her loss. We're trying to create our
own identity. We're not a team
without Logan, we're an entirely
new team."
While Tom was a key to the
team's success in her time at Stan
ford, Dunning lacks nothing in
terms of talent on his 2003 squad.
Moving up to take over as the
team's No. 1 outside hitter is junior
Ogonna Nnamani, who is a two
time Ail-American and spent this
summer leading the U.S. National
Training Team to a bronze medal in
the Pan American Games. Last
