# Women's volleyball set for new season
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two consecutive appear
ances in the NCAA Championship
game, trips to the final four in seven
of the last nine seasons and a cumu
lative 65-7 record the last two years,
Stanford volleyball fans may be sur
prised to come back to the Farm to
find that their team already has two
losses.
Like in all sports, a team's record
only tells one side of the story. Only
eight games into its 2003 season, the
No. 4 ranked Cardinal's two losses
have come at the hands of the No. 2
and No. 3 ranked teams in the na
tion, Hawaii and Florida, respec
tively. The only team ranked above
the Cardinal that it has not faced is
defending national champion USC,
who beat Stanford in last year's
NCAA finals.
But the Cardinal Volleyball pro
gram does have a tremendous his
tory and has the talent and leader
ship this year to continue that suc
cess. In the past nine years, Stan
ford won four NCAA titles. Its all
time record stands at 707-174-4 and
has failed to rank in the top-10 na
tionally only once in the past 22
years.
"There's always pressure on a

team to do well, and we're not look
ing ahead to the final four or a na
tional championship," junior
Ogonna Nnamani said. "We just
need to turn that pressure into drive
and look from day-to-day on im
proving and playing our best. It was
actually really great for us to face
the top teams in the nation this
early in our season because it
showed us what we need to work on
to be successful this season."
At the helm of the program is
third year head coach John Dun
ning. In his first two seasons with
the Cardinal, Dunning has lead the
squad to the NCAA finals both
years, winning in 2001 and losing to
USC last year. He was named Na
tional Coach of the Year and Pacif
ic 10 Conference Coach of the year
in 2001. He is also only the 21st Di
vision I volleyball coach to reach
the 500-win mark and has amassed
an astonishing 71-9 record with the
Cardinal, including an 11-1 postsea
son record.
"I think that more than anything
else, [Dunning] has really expanded
my game mentally and I've learned
so much," said senior Middle
Blocker Jennifer Harvey. "Since he
came to the team, I've thought so
much more about strategy as op
posed to simply trying to overpow

er teams. We often play the odds
and take chances depending on
what he thinks will help us win each
point."
As the 2003 season is only Dun
ning's third on the Farm, this will be
his first year as the coach of a Stan
ford team that is not lead by Na
tional Player of the Year Logan
Tom. As an outside hitter, Tom
leads the Cardinal in single season
kills (621) and is second in both sin
gle season digs and single season
service aces.
"[Logan] was a huge part of the
team and is a great weapon to have
on the court," Harvey said, "But
we're not trying to compensate for
her loss. We're trying to create our
own identity. We're not a team
without Logan, we're an entirely
new team."
While Tom was a key to the
team's success in her time at Stan
ford, Dunning lacks nothing in
terms of talent on his 2003 squad.
Moving up to take over as the
team's No. 1 outside hitter is junior
Ogonna Nnamani, who is a two
time Ail-American and spent this
summer leading the U.S. National
Training Team to a bronze medal in
the Pan American Games. Last

team is looking to hike up its record from last year's runner-up NCAA finish.
year, Nnamani averaged 4.1 kills
per game with a .311 hitting average
and is on record to record to reach
the 2,000 career kill mark .579
more than Tom.
Stanford also returns five talent
ed seniors to the team: Harvey, Sara
McGee, Sara Dukes, Anna Robin
son and Jamie Brownell, who re
turns to the team as a redshirt ju
nior.
These seniors are joined by a rel
atively large recruiting class of five

freshmen, including Ogonna Nna
mani's younger sister Njideka and
High School Player of the Year and
No. 1 recruit in the nation Kristin
Richards.
Playing in the middle will be
Harvey, who led the conference in
blocks last season with an average
of 1.43 per game and McGee, who
was named First-Team All Ameri
can last year and set a Stanford
record with a single season hitting
percentage of .426. At the setters
positions will be Robinson and
sophomore Katie Goldhahn, who
have split the job so far this season.
Opposite Ogonna Nnamani will be
outside hitters Dukes, Richards and
junior Jennifer Hucke.

The Cardinal opened their season
on the right foot with a championship
in the University Park Holiday Inn
Class in Colorado. The Cardinal won
all three of its matches in the tourney
with a 3-0 (30-22, 30-16 30-21) win
over Colorado State, a 3-0 (30-13,30-
15,30-21) win over Bradley and a 3-2
(26-30,30-14,28-30,30-26,15-11) win
over Florida A&M. Ogonna Nna
mani was named Tournament MVP
as she led the team with 61 kills, in
cluding a career-high 30 kills against
Florida A&M.
In its home opener against San
Diego, Ogonna Nnamani again led
the match in kills as Stanford rolled
to its fourth win on the season to im
prove its record to 4-0. The follow

ing night, however, the Cardinal fell
to No. 3 Florida in a relatively quick
3-0 (17-30,25-30,18-30) loss, which
saw the Cardinal hit a measly .089
and be out blocked by the Gators.
Stanford later rebounded to re
claim its home court against St.
Mary's College in a 3-0 victory over
the Gaels.
The Cardinal then traveled to
Hawaii where it first defeated
Weber State 3-1 in the Sprint
Hawaii Invitational. For the first
time this season, Ogonna Nnamani
did not lead the team in kills
Richards, Harvey, Hucke and
Dukes all had career high matches
with 18, 16, 16 and 11 kills, respec
tively. Setting up the hitters was

Goldhahn, who also notched a ca
reer high with 65 assists in the
match.
Despite 28 kills by Ogonna Nna
mani, the Cardinal was unable to
overtake No. 2 Hawaii as it fell 3-2
in front of an away crowd of over
8,700. Richards led the team with a
career high 22 digs and Harvey led
the match with nine blocks.
The Cardinal begins its Pac-10
play this weekend as it travels north
to face Oregon and Oregon State.
USC is also ranked No. 1 in the con
ference, with Stanford at No. 2, Fol
lowed by Arizona and UCLA
which are ranked No. 10 and No. 13
in the nation, respectively and tied
for the third ranking in the confer

ence. Currently, Oregon State and
Oregon round out the league at the
No. 9 and No. 10 spots, respectively.
"It's great to be getting ready to
start Pac-10 play," Ogonna Nna
mani said. "They are both going to
be tough teams and they will fight
hard. The [Pac-10] is one of the
most competitive conferences in
the nation and no teams can be
taken lightly. We need to focus and
make sure not to be lackadaisical in
Oregon."
The Cardinal will face Oregon
State on Thursday night at 7:00 pm
and then will travel to Eugene to
face Oregon on Friday night at 7:00
pm. Both matches can be heard live
on KZSU.
