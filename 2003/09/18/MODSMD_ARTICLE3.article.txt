## Registers down at Bookstore 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU DESK EDITOR 
A corrupted file in the Stanford Book
store computer system has caused a week
long craze in the Bookstore and all of its
satellite stores as employees have been
forced to write out all receipts by hand and
tabulate all purchases with small calcula
tors, resulting in slow-moving lines and
often, disgruntled customers.
The system was still day as of closing time
last night. It is unclear when the problem will
be solved, although chaos might ensue if the
situation isn't fixed by next week when
thousands of students are expected to flock to
the Bookstore to purchase their textbooks.
Jeff Friedel, the Bookstore's sales and
marketing manager, discussed how the
glitch came.
"The problem reared its ugly head on
Monday," he said. "Since then, we've been
using a trial and error method to find the file
that's corrupted. Everyone's been working
long hours and we're all working together.
We've set up a sort of tag team: Someone
will write for a little while as another person
does something else."
The system was still down as of the
Bookstore's closing time last night.
The problem struck at a busy time for the
Bookstore. Over the past few days, students
have started buying supplies and textbooks
for the upcoming quarter, which begins next
week. Friedel noted that there were also
many tourists purchasing souvenirs, perhaps
because of Orientation Week.

"[Having the computer system break
down] is tiring, especially this time of year,"
said Friedel. "Next week is supposed to be
the bad week, not this one."
This week certainly has turned into an

exhausting one for many at the Stanford
Bookstore. Friedel pointed out on Tuesday
afternoon that technicians had already
spent 48 hours trying to fix the computers.
"People are flying up from L.A. as I
speak," he said
Friedel stressed that the glitch was not
"an end-of-the-world problem." Trying to
solve it too quickly would not have been a
good idea, though, he said.
"It's important to take the time to inves
tigate," he said. "A knee-jerk reaction could
ruin the whole system."
Friedel said that most customers had
been very understanding.
"Other systems have gone crazy on cam
pus this summer so people are commiserat
ing," he said. "They know what it's like;
they've been through it themselves. I'm
amazed at how nice everyone has been."
However, some patrons of the Bookstore,
expressed their frustration at the long wait.
"I waited 20 minutes to purchase some
thing at the sports shop, even though there
was no line," said first-year doctoral candi
date Claire Adida. "I'm a little surprised
that they're not on top of things. I had high
er expectations for a school like Stanford"
Pablo Arredondo, a law student, was
also surprised by the situation.
"It seems to me that a leading technolog
ical institution like Stanford should be set
ting the bar for efficient cash registration,"
he said.
"But most of all," Arredondo continued,
"I feel bad for the people working behind
the machines."
Arredondo had a suggestion to make
long lines more pleasant in the future:
"Some stores have set up TVs for people
waiting in line. I'd love to be watching a lit
tle CNN right now.
