# Cardinal football pulls off win against San Jose
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Buddy Teevens had planned all along to
throw Trent Edwards into the fire early in
Stanford's opening-season game.
But he probably didn't imagine Ed
wards providing the game-changing spark
the Cardinal needed against San Jose
State. In his first collegiate game, the red
shirt freshman took a discombobulated
Stanford team under his wing and guided it
to a 31-10 victory over the Spartans.
The player from Los Gatos, Calif., com
pleted 21 of 37 passes for 278 yards and two
touchdowns in leading Stanford to its third
straight victory over its Silicon Valley rival.
But rewind to the first quarter, and
the Cardinal (1-0) seemed headed for
another languid performance far too
emblematic of the 2002 season. In
cumbent quarterback Chris Lewis had
struggled in his first two series, misfir
ing on several of his throws and direct
ing two anemic Stanford drives that
racked up a total of only 22 yards.
Meanwhile, San Jose State (1-2) on a
four-yard touchdown run by Yonus Davis
and a Jeff Carr field goal had taken a
10-0 lead in the first twelve minutes of play.
So with 3:02 left in the first quarter, Ed
wards entered the game. Now this wasn't a
revelation by any means Teevens had
announced after the team's scrimmage
against UC-Davis that both quarterbacks
would play two series, and then he would
make an on-the-fly decision about who
would continue under center.
But with the blink of an eye, Edwards
set the tone for the rest of the night.
He completed his first three laserballs
two to Luke Powell and one to Gerren
Crochet and moved the ball 71 yards in
under a minute. The drive eventually
stalled and a Michael Sgroi field goal was
blocked, but the message was clear.
Edwards would not be fazed.
"I would have liked to have put that first
touchdown in," Edwards said. "But it was
nice to get out there and get those throws
in and get those pre-game jitters out."
Edwards' second series ended with an
interception as the young quarterback,
who was hit as he let go of the ball, under
threw to a streaking Greg Camarillo.
But he eventually led two touchdown
drives mostly through the air, ending both
with throws of 30 and 20 yards, respective
ly, to Powell.
The 5-foot-8 senior wide receiver was
the target of the night for Edwards and had
a career-best in both receptions (12) and
yards (172).
"I was watching film this week and I
thought to myself, 'lf I'm ever in trouble,
just look for Luke and he'll find a way to
get open," Edwards said. "That's what
happened tonight."

The Cardinal also added a cheap score
in between the two touchdown passes after
a fumble by the Spartans' Davis was recov
ered by junior linebacker Jared Newberry
at the San Jose State six-yard line.
Sophomore running back J.R. Lemon
took the next snap and pranced into the
end zone for his first of two touchdowns on
the night. Stanford took a comfortable 21-
10 lead into the locker room, and the Car
dinal was able to further subdue the Spar
tan defense in the second half with a po
tent running game.
Lemon rushed for 85 yards after half
time— finishing with a career-high 105
yards on the night and added a second
half trip to pay dirt. Incidentally, all five of
his career touchdowns have come against
San Jose State.
And the Stanford sophomore, who finds
himself entrenched in a four-man running
back rotation, obviously did much to dis
tance himself from the pack. (Junior Ken
neth Tolon started and ran for 31 yards be
fore leaving due to a jaw injury. Sophomore
Gerald Commissiong ra n for only six yards
and fumbled once. Freshman David Mar
rero ran eight times for 21 yards.)
The game wasn't only decided by virtue
of Stanford's massive offensive production
(27 first downs and 457 total yards).
The defense had its hand in the winning
cause, too, since the Spartans didn't score
after Edwards entered the game.
The unusually stingy Cardinal defense
held San Jose State to a paltry nine yards
on the ground the seventh best defen
sive effort in school history.
And as a result, Spartans quarterback
Scott Rislov had to throw the ball early and
often. He put the ball in the air a school
record 66 times, completing only 28 for 261
yards.
So how was the Cardinal defense able to
stiffen up so effectively after those first few
chaotic minutes?
"We played more soundly," Teevens
said. "We got a feel for what we had to do
defensively and most of all we got back
there and disrupted Rislov's rhythm."
Also give some kudos to Stanford's of
fensive line, which ushered in the careers
of four new starters with a fairly solid per
formance.
"Our offensive line really stepped it up
tonight," Edwards said. "Those front five
guys held their own and gave me plenty of
time to make my reads and my throws."
As much as the Cardinal did well in the
game, there were plenty of slip-ups to go
around. The youthful offensive line had
several false starting penalties. The de
fense missed tackles and mixed up cover
age. And the special teams allowed a field
goal to be blocked.
"It's certainly nicer to start [with a win]
than the alternative," Teevens said. "But
we have a lot off work to do."

get open," Edwards said. "That's what
happened tonight."

The Cardinal also added a cheap score
in between the two touchdown passes after
a fumble by the Spartans' Davis was recov
ered by junior linebacker Jared Newberry
at the San Jose State six-yard line.
Sophomore running back J.R. Lemon
took the next snap and pranced into the
end zone for his first of two touchdowns on
the night. Stanford took a comfortable 21-
10 lead into the locker room, and the Car
dinal was able to further subdue the Spar
tan defense in the second half with a po
tent running game.
Lemon rushed for 85 yards after half
time— finishing with a career-high 105
yards on the night and added a second
half trip to pay dirt. Incidentally, all five of
his career touchdowns have come against
San Jose State.
And the Stanford sophomore, who finds
himself entrenched in a four-man running
back rotation, obviously did much to dis
tance himself from the pack. (Junior Ken
neth Tolon started and ran for 31 yards be
fore leaving due to a jaw injury. Sophomore
Gerald Commissiong ra n for only six yards
and fumbled once. Freshman David Mar
rero ran eight times for 21 yards.)
The game wasn't only decided by virtue
of Stanford's massive offensive production
(27 first downs and 457 total yards).
The defense had its hand in the winning
cause, too, since the Spartans didn't score
after Edwards entered the game.
The unusually stingy Cardinal defense
held San Jose State to a paltry nine yards
on the ground the seventh best defen
sive effort in school history.
And as a result, Spartans quarterback
Scott Rislov had to throw the ball early and
often. He put the ball in the air a school
record 66 times, completing only 28 for 261
yards.
So how was the Cardinal defense able to
stiffen up so effectively after those first few
chaotic minutes?
"We played more soundly," Teevens
said. "We got a feel for what we had to do
defensively and most of all we got back
there and disrupted Rislov's rhythm."
Also give some kudos to Stanford's of
fensive line, which ushered in the careers
of four new starters with a fairly solid per
formance.
"Our offensive line really stepped it up
tonight," Edwards said. "Those front five
guys held their own and gave me plenty of
time to make my reads and my throws."
As much as the Cardinal did well in the
game, there were plenty of slip-ups to go
around. The youthful offensive line had
several false starting penalties. The de
fense missed tackles and mixed up cover
age. And the special teams allowed a field
goal to be blocked.
"It's certainly nicer to start [with a win]
than the alternative," Teevens said. "But
we have a lot off work to do."

a 31-10 victory, giving the team its first win of the season.
Buddy Teevens had planned all along to
throw Trent Edwards into the fire early in
Stanford's opening-season game.
But he probably didn't imagine Ed
wards providing the game-changing spark
the Cardinal needed against San Jose
State. In his first collegiate game, the red
shirt freshman took a discombobulated
Stanford team under his wing and guided it
to a 31-10 victory over the Spartans.
The player from Los Gatos, Calif., com
pleted 21 of 37 passes for 278 yards and two
touchdowns in leading Stanford to its third
straight victory over its Silicon Valley rival.
But rewind to the first quarter, and
the Cardinal (1-0) seemed headed for
another languid performance far too
emblematic of the 2002 season. In
cumbent quarterback Chris Lewis had
struggled in his first two series, misfir
ing on several of his throws and direct
ing two anemic Stanford drives that
racked up a total of only 22 yards.
Meanwhile, San Jose State (1-2) on a
four-yard touchdown run by Yonus Davis
and a Jeff Carr field goal had taken a
10-0 lead in the first twelve minutes of play.
So with 3:02 left in the first quarter, Ed
wards entered the game. Now this wasn't a
revelation by any means Teevens had
announced after the team's scrimmage
against UC-Davis that both quarterbacks
would play two series, and then he would
make an on-the-fly decision about who
would continue under center.
But with the blink of an eye, Edwards
set the tone for the rest of the night.
He completed his first three laserballs
two to Luke Powell and one to Gerren
Crochet and moved the ball 71 yards in
under a minute. The drive eventually
stalled and a Michael Sgroi field goal was
blocked, but the message was clear.
Edwards would not be fazed.
"I would have liked to have put that first
touchdown in," Edwards said. "But it was
nice to get out there and get those throws
in and get those pre-game jitters out."
Edwards' second series ended with an
interception as the young quarterback,
who was hit as he let go of the ball, under
threw to a streaking Greg Camarillo.
But he eventually led two touchdown
drives mostly through the air, ending both
with throws of 30 and 20 yards, respective
ly, to Powell.
The 5-foot-8 senior wide receiver was
the target of the night for Edwards and had
a career-best in both receptions (12) and
yards (172).
"I was watching film this week and I
thought to myself, 'lf I'm ever in trouble,
just look for Luke and he'll find a way to
get open," Edwards said. "That's what
happened tonight."

The Cardinal also added a cheap score
