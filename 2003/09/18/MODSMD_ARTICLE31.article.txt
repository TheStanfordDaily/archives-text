# Great Scott! He has all the answers
## 
### 
Who will win the National League
wild card race? Can the Bucs re
peat? Could I play for the De
troit Tigers? Interesting ques
tions, but not nearly as pertinent as the ones
clogging my make-believe mailbox from
eager freshmen. Without further ado, I give
you the first and only installment of
"College Queries."
Dear Scott,
What should I expect during Orientation
Week?
Curious in Colorado
Think an NFL preseason-esque combina
tion of confusion, excitement and hype,
minus the cheerleaders and season-ending in
juries. Fans and announcers struggle with the
names of the third-string special teams unit
consisting of Arena League castoffs, you have
trouble keeping the ten Johns from California
you've already met straight.

The perfect end to the week
would include University
President John Hennessy
belting "Are you ready for
some classes?" alongside
Hank Williams Jr. in
MemAud with an image of
clashing books exploding in
the background.
Dear Scott,
What's the key to academic

success at Stanford? Is college harder than
high school?
Worried in Washington

I'm flattered you assume I have the answer.
You must have heard the study that showed
that offensive lineman are the smartest foot
ball players which also revealed that sports
columnists tend to be the most intelligent
members of a newspaper staff. Who knew?
College is all about time management. In
other words, master the two-minute paper
writing drill and avoid scheduling classes that
will interfere with your ability to watch play
off baseball, Monday Night Football, the
Kobe trial and the World Series (of poker).
My good friend-and victim-Maurice Clarett
advises: When it comes to large lecture class
es, take full advantage of your TAs and the in
tegrated discussion section. If you're reading
this Maurice, please pass on the word to the
local authorities that I left, oh, it must've been
about $5OO worth of chewing gum and two flat
screen TVs in your stolen ride. Thanks.
Dear Scott,
It's totally not cool that we don't find out
who are roommates are beforehand. I mean,
what if, like, we bring clashing bedspreads or
towels? Less importantly, what if she's a rag
ing lunatic and we don't get along?
Troubled in Tulsa
I want to feel concerned for you about the
bedspreads. I really do. But have you seen
Oregon's new football uniforms? Stay away
from highlighter-yellow linens and you
should be fine. In regards to your second
question, please pass on my condolences to
your roommate.
Dear Scott,
I was a four-sport athlete in high school but
am not quite good enough to play a varsity
sport at Stanford. Are there intramural oppor
tunities?
Jock in Jersey
Yes. Intramurals at Stanford are a great
way to get some exercise and bond with the
people in your dorm. They're also a perfect
way to release some of your competitive
juices in a non-academic setting, by running
up the score against the undermanned dorm
that's starting its 63-year-old RF at center.
That said, Bill Romanowski urges you to
keep in mind the fact that no matter how heat
ed your Saturday morning inner-tube water
polo game becomes, please resist that urge to
break the orbital bone in your teammate or
opponent's face with your fist.
Dear Scott,
I've heard all the horror stories about the
'Freshman 15.' Is this freshman girl doomed?
Weight-conscious in Wichita
Eat healthy and exercise. However, if
you're not going out of your way to eat chick
en fingers and french fries for breakfast, lunch
and dinner, and the pounds start to pile on,
embrace your new look and give football
coach Buddy Teevens a holler. With Kwame
Harris plying his trade in the NFL, the O-line
could use another big body, and becoming the
first female non-kicker to appear in a Divi
sion I college football game is a feel-good
story if I've ever heard one.
Dear Scott,
I got straight A's in high school, was captain
of our state-champion football and basketball
teams and turned down a modeling contract
offer from Abercrombie and Fitch to focus on
my studies. I don't really have a question, I just
wanted to boast.
Mr. Big Fish, Little Pond
Thanks for the autobiography, Cassius
Clay. Fact is, unless you're Leßron James or
Zack Morris, people here will care about what
you did in high school about as much as they
care about what team draws the most charging
fouls in the WNBA Finals. This is a good
thing. You're at the wrong place if you wanted
a nonstop ultra-competitive environment.
Dear Scott,
I got my housing information in the mail and
I'm living in Branner. Is that good?
Naive in Nairobi
Is John Madden eloquent? Branner (still)
sucks.
Welcome to Stanford, Class of 'O7.

Kobe trial and the World Series (of poker).
My good friend-and victim-Maurice Clarett
advises: When it comes to large lecture class
es, take full advantage of your TAs and the in
tegrated discussion section. If you're reading
this Maurice, please pass on the word to the
local authorities that I left, oh, it must've been
about $5OO worth of chewing gum and two flat
screen TVs in your stolen ride. Thanks.
Dear Scott,
It's totally not cool that we don't find out
who are roommates are beforehand. I mean,
what if, like, we bring clashing bedspreads or
towels? Less importantly, what if she's a rag
ing lunatic and we don't get along?
Troubled in Tulsa
I want to feel concerned for you about the
bedspreads. I really do. But have you seen
Oregon's new football uniforms? Stay away
from highlighter-yellow linens and you
should be fine. In regards to your second
question, please pass on my condolences to
your roommate.
Dear Scott,
I was a four-sport athlete in high school but
am not quite good enough to play a varsity
sport at Stanford. Are there intramural oppor
tunities?
Jock in Jersey
Yes. Intramurals at Stanford are a great
way to get some exercise and bond with the
people in your dorm. They're also a perfect
way to release some of your competitive
juices in a non-academic setting, by running
up the score against the undermanned dorm
that's starting its 63-year-old RF at center.
That said, Bill Romanowski urges you to
keep in mind the fact that no matter how heat
ed your Saturday morning inner-tube water
polo game becomes, please resist that urge to
break the orbital bone in your teammate or
opponent's face with your fist.
Dear Scott,
I've heard all the horror stories about the
'Freshman 15.' Is this freshman girl doomed?
Weight-conscious in Wichita
Eat healthy and exercise. However, if
you're not going out of your way to eat chick
en fingers and french fries for breakfast, lunch
and dinner, and the pounds start to pile on,
embrace your new look and give football
coach Buddy Teevens a holler. With Kwame
Harris plying his trade in the NFL, the O-line
could use another big body, and becoming the
first female non-kicker to appear in a Divi
sion I college football game is a feel-good
story if I've ever heard one.
Dear Scott,
I got straight A's in high school, was captain
of our state-champion football and basketball
teams and turned down a modeling contract
offer from Abercrombie and Fitch to focus on
my studies. I don't really have a question, I just
wanted to boast.
Mr. Big Fish, Little Pond
Thanks for the autobiography, Cassius
Clay. Fact is, unless you're Leßron James or
Zack Morris, people here will care about what
you did in high school about as much as they
care about what team draws the most charging
fouls in the WNBA Finals. This is a good
thing. You're at the wrong place if you wanted
a nonstop ultra-competitive environment.
Dear Scott,
I got my housing information in the mail and
I'm living in Branner. Is that good?
Naive in Nairobi
Is John Madden eloquent? Branner (still)
sucks.
Welcome to Stanford, Class of 'O7.
