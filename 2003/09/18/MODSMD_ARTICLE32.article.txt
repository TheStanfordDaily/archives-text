# Soccer has a score to settle

### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Soccer teams in the NCAA find it hard to forget that
the now-unranked Stanford men's soccer team (1-3)
has gone to the College Cup for the last two years, and
has been a dominating force in the sport for years.
Squads walk into contests against the Cardinal des
perate to win, out to prove their own skill by defeating
such a force in college soccer.
To a certain extent, a tremendous amount of expec
tation comes along with that type of high profile per
sona.
And the only problem with that is that this year, the
NCAA is seeing a Stanford that it has never witnessed
before.
When graduation left Stanford head coach Bret
Simon without six of his most crucial players, including
team scoring-leaders Todd Dunivant and Roger
Levesque, it was clear that the 2003 season would call
for some rebuilding.
Abe Geiger and Mike Wilson return as the co-cap
tains and the only seniors on the squad.
"The greatest quality of the class that graduated was
their leadership," said Geiger, who was a valuable force
in the midfield last season. "And I think that had a

trickle-down effect, and their leadership passed on to
us. In that way everything we do will be a tribute to the
guys leaving."
The team also returns nine juniors, including goal
keeper Robby Fulton, who held the best goals against
average in the country last season. The junior class also
boasts last year's team leader for goals, forward Darren
Fernandez and the team's active leader in goals, points
and assists, Matt Janusz.
Stanford will have six returning sophomores, one of
whom, Chad Marshall, was named Soccer America's
Freshman of the Year last season.
But the seven incoming freshmen are certainly vital
this year, as they are going to need to step up and fill in
some gaps for the team to maintain its success.
"It's an awful lot to put on this group," said Simon,
who is in his third year at the Farm. "But I think that
four years from now, we will look back on this class as
one of the best that Stanford has ever seen."
Simon's faith is warranted, as the freshmen recruits
have long resumes that include amazing play in high
school and on club teams. Midfielder Marcus Ryan and
goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen were ranked 10th and
13th, respectively, on Soccer America's top recruits list.
"They're a great recruiting class. They have a lot of
potential," Wilson said. "They are really an attacking

class. They can cause trouble for some other teams in
the top third."
The Cardinal got a chance to test their new squad in
an eight-day preseason trip to Costa Rica, where the
team played professional teams for extra training.
Geiger said that the time was invaluable to them be
cause it gave them an opportunity to see new lineups
and tinker around with new positions.
"We're a young, inexperienced team. We're still
finding our feet," Geiger said.
Simon and his squad have been on a long string of
away games, and the team won their first matchup
against Cal State Fullerton, but dropped its next three
games to Old Dominion, Brown, and Yale. The losses
caused the team to drop from national rankings.
"One thing we underestimated was the intensity of
our opponents," Simon said.
"We had a lot of possession, but we had trouble
breaking the defense down," Geiger explained. "A lot
of that is that we're not [accustomed] to playing with
each other. But that'll happen."
The team heads next to Oklahoma to face No. 21
Tulsa and No. 9 Southern Methodist.
"It'll be difficult," Simon admitted. "Tulsa and SMU
both have very good teams. We just need to come out
with intensity."

team this year.
