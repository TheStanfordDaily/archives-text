The undisputed king of the Pac-10 this
year is Southern California, which hasn't
missed a step despite the loss of Heisman
Trophy-winning quarterback Carson
Palmer to graduation.
Ranked fourth in the country by the As
sociated Press, the Trojans are joined in
the Top 25 by explosive No. 16 Arizona
State, resilient No. 19 Washington,
flashy No. 22 Oregon and surprising No.
24 Washington State.
Stanford (1-0) joins Oregon (3-0), USC
(3-0) and Arizona State (2-0) as the Pac
10's only remaining undefeated teams.
USC opened its season in grand fashion,

stunning then-No. 6 Auburn, 23-0, on the
Tigers' home turf. Since then, the Tro
jans have beaten BYU, 35-18, and
Hawaii, 61-32. The offense, led by
sophomore quarterback Matt Leinart
(647 yards, 6 TD, 3 INT) and big-play
second-year receiver Mike Williams,
hasn't missed a beat following in
Palmer's footsteps, but the traditionally
staunch defense has fared worse with
each week and will need to buckle down
for Pete Carroll's squad to handle the
tougher Pac-10 programs.
Arizona State
Dirk Koetter's Sun Devils, which had
their coming-out party early last year
with a 65-24 win against the Cardinal,
carry last year's momentum into this
season behind the cannon arm of quar
terback Andrew Walter (501 yards, 6
TD, 1 INT) and a shifty assortment of
tailbacks, with Loren Wade, Randy Hill
and Hakim Hill all averaging 48 yards
per carry or higher. While the defense
isn't in USC's league, it has some big
time playmakers, like safety Jason Shiv
ers, who led the Pac-10 in tackles last
year with 121. The Sun Devils have
looked middling so far, defeating
Northern Arizona 34-14 and Utah State
26-16, but they remain a talented, dan

gerous team.
Washington
Washington came into this season as
a question mark, their fate uncertain
after head coach Rick Neuheisel was
forced out after it was discovered that he
had bet on college basketball. New
coach Keith Gilbertson has plenty of tal
ent to work with in senior quarterback
Cody Pickett, who has a knack for engi
neering comebacks, and stud junior re
ceiver Reggie Williams, who had a
whopping 98 receptions during the
Huskies' 7-6 campaign last year. The de
fense is talented, led by an experienced
secondary. A season-opening 28-9 loss
to then-No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus
was a disappointment, but the Huskies
blew past Indiana, 38-13, as they should
have done. Pickett and Williams may be
the best quarterback-receiver tandem in
the nation, but this team still needs to
find an effective running back in order
to contend - last year's backs compiled
the worst rushing performance in team
history, and this year's top rushers, Rich
Alexis and Kenny James, have com
bined to average just 2.9 yards per carry.
Oregon
Oregon got off to a strong start last

year, opening 6-0, before collapsing to
lose six of their seven games (the lone
victory coming at Stanford's expense).
This year, with 15 returning starters, the
Ducks should have the experience to
avoid a similar late-season collapse.
Quarterbacks Kellen Clemens (569
yards, 7 TD, 0 INT) and Jason Fife (283
yards, 4 TD, 0 INT) have both shown
poise while splitting time. The Ducks do
not miss Onterrio Smith too much just
yet; its running game has produced 221
yards a game. After edging Mississippi
State 42-34 and Nevada 31-23, Oregon
last weekend blew out Arizona 48-10.
Whether that momentum will help in
Saturday's showdown against national
powerhouse No. X Michigan remains to
be seen, however. Should the Ducks
manage to keep it close, they can count
on Jared Siegel, whose impressive
strength and accuracy make him the na
tion's best placekicker.
Washington State
Washington State came into the year
unranked after a 10-3 finish in 2002, in
cluding 7-1 in the Pac-10. The Cougars
lost a lot of talent to the NFL, including
quarterback Jason Gesser, cornerback
