The undisputed king of the Pac-10 this
year is Southern California, which hasn't
missed a step despite the loss of Heisman
Trophy-winning quarterback Carson
Palmer to graduation.
Ranked fourth in the country by the As
sociated Press, the Trojans are joined in
the Top 25 by explosive No. 16 Arizona
State, resilient No. 19 Washington,
flashy No. 22 Oregon and surprising No.
24 Washington State.
Stanford (1-0) joins Oregon (3-0), USC
(3-0) and Arizona State (2-0) as the Pac
10's only remaining undefeated teams.
USC opened its season in grand fashion,

stunning then-No. 6 Auburn, 23-0, on the
Tigers' home turf. Since then, the Tro
jans have beaten BYU, 35-18, and
Hawaii, 61-32. The offense, led by
sophomore quarterback Matt Leinart
(647 yards, 6 TD, 3 INT) and big-play
second-year receiver Mike Williams,
hasn't missed a beat following in
Palmer's footsteps, but the traditionally
staunch defense has fared worse with
each week and will need to buckle down
for Pete Carroll's squad to handle the
tougher Pac-10 programs.
Arizona State
Dirk Koetter's Sun Devils, which had
their coming-out party early last year
with a 65-24 win against the Cardinal,
carry last year's momentum into this
season behind the cannon arm of quar
terback Andrew Walter (501 yards, 6
TD, 1 INT) and a shifty assortment of
tailbacks, with Loren Wade, Randy Hill
and Hakim Hill all averaging 48 yards
per carry or higher. While the defense
isn't in USC's league, it has some big
time playmakers, like safety Jason Shiv
ers, who led the Pac-10 in tackles last
year with 121. The Sun Devils have
looked middling so far, defeating
Northern Arizona 34-14 and Utah State
26-16, but they remain a talented, dan

gerous team.
Washington
Washington came into this season as
a question mark, their fate uncertain
after head coach Rick Neuheisel was
forced out after it was discovered that he
had bet on college basketball. New
coach Keith Gilbertson has plenty of tal
ent to work with in senior quarterback
Cody Pickett, who has a knack for engi
neering comebacks, and stud junior re
ceiver Reggie Williams, who had a
whopping 98 receptions during the
Huskies' 7-6 campaign last year. The de
fense is talented, led by an experienced
secondary. A season-opening 28-9 loss
to then-No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus
was a disappointment, but the Huskies
blew past Indiana, 38-13, as they should
have done. Pickett and Williams may be
the best quarterback-receiver tandem in
the nation, but this team still needs to
find an effective running back in order
to contend - last year's backs compiled
the worst rushing performance in team
history, and this year's top rushers, Rich
Alexis and Kenny James, have com
bined to average just 2.9 yards per carry.
Oregon
Oregon got off to a strong start last

year, opening 6-0, before collapsing to
lose six of their seven games (the lone
victory coming at Stanford's expense).
This year, with 15 returning starters, the
Ducks should have the experience to
avoid a similar late-season collapse.
Quarterbacks Kellen Clemens (569
yards, 7 TD, 0 INT) and Jason Fife (283
yards, 4 TD, 0 INT) have both shown
poise while splitting time. The Ducks do
not miss Onterrio Smith too much just
yet; its running game has produced 221
yards a game. After edging Mississippi
State 42-34 and Nevada 31-23, Oregon
last weekend blew out Arizona 48-10.
Whether that momentum will help in
Saturday's showdown against national
powerhouse No. X Michigan remains to
be seen, however. Should the Ducks
manage to keep it close, they can count
on Jared Siegel, whose impressive
strength and accuracy make him the na
tion's best placekicker.
Washington State
Washington State came into the year
unranked after a 10-3 finish in 2002, in
cluding 7-1 in the Pac-10. The Cougars
lost a lot of talent to the NFL, including
quarterback Jason Gesser, cornerback
Marcus Trufant and defensive lineman
Rien Long, and are operating under a
new coach, Bill Doba, after Mike Price
skipped town. They do return 14
starters, however, and rode a 47-26 vic
tory over Colorado last weekend into
the Top 25. The Cougars defeated Idaho
25-0 in their opener before falling to
Notre Dame 29-26 on Sept. 6. Quarter
back Matt Kegel didn't have many sup
porters after a weak 2002 campaign as
Gesser's backup, but has managed to
minimize his mistakes so far (692 yards,
5 TD, 3 INT). Star back Jermaine Clark
was expected to produce more than he
has (3.3 yards per carry), but Jonathan
Smith has been outstanding (6.9 yards
per carry). While their 2-1 start is a nice
surprise, the Cougars' defense hasn't
been great, allowing 372 yards per game,
and the team faces a daunting confer
ence schedule.
UCLA
UCLA received a fair amount of pre
season buzz, coming off an 8-5 finish in
2002 and boasting impact players like
tailback Tyler Ebell, sophomore line

backer Spencer Havner and 6-3 corner
back Matt Ware, as well as a new coach
in Karl Dorrell. Quarterback, though,
was correctly tabbed as a major concern,
with the only serious candidates for the
job being a pair of inexperienced sopho
mores, Drew Olson and Matt Moore.
The two have combined to average just
149 passing yards per game, and Ebell is
averaging a dissapointing 49 yards per
game. Yet, thanks to a stifling defense
(292 yards per game), the Bruins battled
Colorado before losing 16-14 and kicked
their way to a 6-3 win over Illinois last
week. This is not the kind of football
UCLA fans are accustomed to, but if the
defense can continue to shut opponents
down, the traditionally high-scoring
Bruins could make a real splash in con
ference play.
Oregon State
Matt Riley has returned to Corvallis
for his second tour of duty, taking over
an 8-5 team that boasts the best running
back in the Pac-10, the powerful but
swift Steven Jackson, who rushed for a
school-record 1,690 yards in 2002. Scat
tershot quarterback Derek Anderson
remains an X-factor with a knack for
overthrowing his talented, oft-open re
ceivers, but the Beavers' defense will
keep them in most games. Standout line

backer Richard Siegel leads the unit,
while defensive end Bill Swancutt is
looking to improve upon last year's 12-
sack performance. Oregon State sand
wiched a 48-26 win over Sacramento
State and a 28-16 win over New Mexico
State around a somewhat disappointing
16-14 loss to Fresno State. Anderson has
completed just 45 percent of his passes,
while throwing seven interceptions
against just four touchdowns, but Jack
son has already accumulated 446 yards
rushing, 189 yards receiving and five
touchdowns. For the Beavers to keep
their winning record intact once confer
ence play begins, Anderson will need to
finally play up to his potential.
California
Jeff Tedford took California from 1-
10 in 2001 to 7-5 last year, but the Gold
en Bears return just eight starters (in
cluding only two on defense), fewest in
the Pac-10, and will be hard-pressed to
duplicate last year's success. Relying
heavily on junior college transfers, the
Bears opened the year with a solid slate
of non-conference opponents. They
managed an unusual 34-2 victory over
Southern Mississippi, and showed poise
in losing 42-28 to No. X Kansas State, 23-
21 to Colorado State and 31-24 to Utah.
Adimchinobe Echemandu is averaging

5.7 yards per carry, Geoff McArthur has
25 receptions for 470 yards and five
touchdowns, and quarterbacks Aaron
Rodgers and Reggie Robertson have
combined for 11 touchdowns against
just three interceptions. The defense has
struggled, allowing 209 rushing yards a
game, but the Bears have managed to
keep things close in every loss, and Ted
ford is one of the nation's top young
coaches, so it should not be a surprise if
Cal continues to overachieve.
Arizona
Stanford is coming off of a rough
year, but Arizona may be in an even
more unenviable position. Having gone
just 1-7 in conference last year, Arizona
lost its quarterback, best receiver and
top defender, have to play Louisiana
State and Purdue out-of-conference,
and does not get to play Stanford in-con
ference. Coach John Mackovic barely
survived a team-wide mutiny last sea
son, and is probably on a more tenuous
footing than any other coach in the con
ference. To their credit, the Wildcats
breezed past Texas-El Paso 42-7 in their
opener before being crushed by LSU 59-
13 and steamrolled 48-10 by Oregon.
This weekend's game at Purdue should
be little more fun, and the conference
schedule presently holds no contest in
