Splish, splash.
The Stanford men's water polo
team (1-0), national champions
two years in a row, is hoping for a
third big win.
"We graduated three Ail-
Americans and an outstanding de
fensive player from last year's
NCAA championship team
those will be tough shoes to fill,"
said head coach John Vargas, in his
second year with the team. "But I
believe we have talented young
players who will step right in a
make a valuable contribution."
Strong players remain, howev
er. Redshirt junior Tony Azevedo
and senior Mike Derse combined
for 145 goals in the 2002 season.
Azevedo missed the season open
er at UC Santa Cruz while travel
ing in Europe with the U.S.
Olympic team. The junior driver,
widely regarded as the top water
polo player in the United States,
scored four goals in last season's
7-6 victory over California in the
NCAA Championship game.
He's also a strong defensive
player. Derse had an outstanding
2002 season with 50 goals as main
ly a defensive player, but Vargas
plans on using him more in the
frontcourt offense this year.
Azevedo expects a strong sea
son from the Cardinal players and
sees team unity among the
younger players as the first step to
a wining season.
"It's really important to play to
gether solidly and focus on getting
as mature as possible as fast as we
can," he said.
Derse said that the team has "a
positive outlook" and pointed out
that many of the younger players
already have national and interna
tional playing experience.
"We can't replace the players
but we can fill the spots we lost
from last year," he said.
Among the returning players,
sophomore Thomas Hopkins, ju
nior Greg Crum and junior Matt

Moser scored 24, 19 and 11 goals
respectively last season.
They'll have plenty of opportu
nities to score since Azevedo will
likely be double and triple teamed.
Vargas praises Hopkins's passing
and quick release.
Crum will be their primary set
man. Vargas believes Moser has
shown the most improvement of
any player this past summer, great
ly developing his offensive skills.
Vargas also sees juniors Trent
Wiesen and Sam Tyre playing key
roles this season, with Tyre in the
role of primary center defender or
primary center and Wiesen on de
fense.
Azevedo hopes to have the Car
dinal playing at a high level during
the 2003 season. Both he and
Derse want to help teach the
younger players as much as possi
ble.
"My biggest thing coming into
my third year is a motivation to
bring my experience to this team
and to bring the level of the game
up to what I was experiencing this
summer," Azevedo said.
Derse wants the younger play
ers to take over his defensive posi
tion so he can focus on continuing
to improve in an offensive role.
The Cardinal lost four-time All-
American goalie Nick Ellis, but
last year's backup, sophomore
Chad Taylor, is ready to take over
the position. In seven games last
season, Taylor had 13 saves.
"Chad is an outstanding athlete
who has waited two long years to
finally get his chance at being our
full time goalie. I believe that
Chad will be the biggest surprise of
this year's team and in NCAA,"
said Vargas.
The season is already off to a
promising start with a 22-4 win
over Santa Cruz on Sept. 7. Ten
players scored goals, including
four from Moser, three from Crum
and Hopkins and two from Derse.
Sophomore driver Peter Verellas
also added three goals. Taylor had
four saves and the new backup
goalie, freshman Beau Stockstill,

had three.
Though the team is young, Var
gas thinks they're still a number
one team, and said only Mike
Derse will be leaving next year. He
sees USC, Cal, UCLA and Pep

perdine as big competitors this
season.
"Yes, we are young, but we
have enough experience to make
this team one of the best in the na
tion," Derse said. "Our style of

play will be fast paced and enter
taining, while still playing under
control, with discipline and com
posure."
Stanford will host the NCAA
Championships this December.

They play in the Southern Califor
nia Tournament in Irvine on Sept.
21 and 22 and their first home
matchup with Brigham Young
University-Hawaii at the Avery
Aquatic Complex on Sept. 24.
