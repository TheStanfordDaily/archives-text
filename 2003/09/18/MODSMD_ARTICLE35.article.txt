# Major injuries stall Cardinal
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks into a potentially
three month long season, the No. 24
Stanford women's soccer team (3-
2-0) has already faced the defend
ing national champions, beaten up
on two Ivy League teams, been
upset by a team it had not faced in
more than eight years and suffered
an endless string of injuries.
While the Cardinal squad re
turned six starters, it has two
gaping holes to fill after the grad
uation of Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Year Marcia Wallis
and the loss of senior forward
Marcie Ward to a foot injury.
Ward, a West Region Ail-Amer
ican, will use a medical redshirt
while her foot heals. Without
Ward and Wallis, Stanford is left
without a potent offensive
threat.
"Our lack of depth this year is
one of our weaknesses," said assis
tant coach Stephanie Erickson.
"Our defending is still very strong
though. It will be hard for teams to
score on us when we are playing at
the top of our game."
The Cardinal defense is led by
junior goalkeeper and team tri
captain Nicole Barnhart, a 2002
National Soccer Coaches Associa
tion of America All-American se
lection.
Also bolstering the strong de
fense are fellow tri-captains Natal
ie Spilger and Ally Marquand.
Rounding out the defense is senior
Alisan Pabon and twins Hayley
and Lindsey Hunt.
However, both the Hunt twins
have seen limited action due to in
jury. Lindsey was just cleared to
play after suffering a torn ACL and
Hayley's wrist was broken in three
places in her first practice after re
turning from a sprained ankle.
Hayley had surgery on Monday
and is slated to return in three
weeks.
"Hayley's injury was really

tough," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "She is a very im
portant part of our defense."
Also missing time due to injury
are freshman Rachel Buehler and
sophomore Megan Alderete, both
out with torn ACLs.
With the plethora of injuries,
the Cardinal has already felt the
impact of incoming freshmen Gina
Farias-Eisner and Shari Summers,
who have seen increased playing
time. Summers has started all five
matches, recording her first colle
giate goal against Dartmouth,
while Farias-Eisner has started
four of five and tallied seven shots.
Ratcliffe is another newcomer
to the Cardinal, taking over for in
terim co-head coaches Stephanie
Erickson and Paul Sapsford.
Ratcliffe comes to the (Cardinal
from Saint Mary's, where, in 2001
he led the squad to a No. 7 ranking,
the program's highest ever, while
going on to win NSCAA West Re
gion Coach of the Year honors.
Ratcliffe's first five matches as
head coach have proved to be chal
lenging, with the team making con
stant adjustments to account for in
juries. However, the team has
worked its way to a winning record
and is making improvements with
each game.
The Cardinal opened its season
with a shutout victory over Long
Beach State on Aug. 31. The match
remained scoreless until Mar
quand scored the lone goal of the
game on an unassisted shot from 25
yards out in the 83rd minute.
The game marked Barnhart's
23rd career shutout. She tallied just
one save as the stingy Cardinal de
fense allowed the Forty Niners just
one shot.
On Sept. 5, Stanford squared off
against defending national cham
pions Portland (4-2-0). The No. 20
Pilots recorded a 1-0 victory over
the Cardinal on a goal by freshman
Jennifer Tuttle.
Tuttle's goal came unassisted in
the 33rd minute of play and sailed

into the upper left corner of the
net, dashing Stanford's hopes for a
victory.
The Cardinal outshot the Pilots
9-6, but ultimately could not con
vert.
In a very physical match against
No. 6 Pepperdine (5-1-0), Stanford
was again unable to capitalize on
its offensive chances and fell 1-0 to
the Waves.
The Cardinal grossly outshot
the Waves, 18-5, but Pepperdine
goalkeeper Anna Picarelli tallied
eleven saves to keep the shutout in

tact.
"Our inability to finish is defi
nitely a concern," Ratcliffe said.
"Scoring goals has been hard for us
all year, but it is improving."
The Cardinal showed offensive
progress in its trip to Cambridge
for the Harvard Invitational. Stan
ford scored three goals in its two
matches, coming away with a victo
ry in each of its games.
Last Friday, the Cardinal beat
the Crimson 2-1, with goals by
sophomore forward Jennifer
Farenbaugh and senior midfielder

Brittany Oliveira. Both goals were
unassisted, Oliveira's coming in
the 47th minute and Farenbaugh's
in the 73rd.
Barnhart narrowly missed what
would have been her 25th career
shutout, allowing a goal in the final
minute of play to Alisa Sato of
Harvard.
However, Barnhart was able to
pick up the shutout on Sunday
against Dartmouth, when the Car
dinal downed the Big Green, 1-0.
Summers scored the decisive goal
in the 38th minute from 15 yards

out on the right side.
Stanford continues its season at
the Santa Clara/Adidas Classic
with matches against No. 2 Notre
Dame (6-0-0) and Georgia (5-2-0).
The Cardinal will do battle with
the Fighting Irish on Friday at 7
p.m. and the Bulldogs on Sunday at
11 a.m.
"[The Santa Clara/Adidas Clas
sic] will be a huge test for us," Rat
cliffe said. "We have a lot to prove,
especially against Notre Dame.
We'll definitely be going in as un
derdogs."

without a potent offensive
threat.
"Our lack of depth this year is
one of our weaknesses," said assis
tant coach Stephanie Erickson.
"Our defending is still very strong
though. It will be hard for teams to
score on us when we are playing at
the top of our game."
The Cardinal defense is led by
junior goalkeeper and team tri
captain Nicole Barnhart, a 2002
National Soccer Coaches Associa
tion of America All-American se
lection.
Also bolstering the strong de
fense are fellow tri-captains Natal
ie Spilger and Ally Marquand.
Rounding out the defense is senior
Alisan Pabon and twins Hayley
and Lindsey Hunt.
However, both the Hunt twins
have seen limited action due to in
jury. Lindsey was just cleared to
play after suffering a torn ACL and
Hayley's wrist was broken in three
places in her first practice after re
turning from a sprained ankle.
Hayley had surgery on Monday
and is slated to return in three
weeks.
"Hayley's injury was really

tough," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "She is a very im
portant part of our defense."
Also missing time due to injury
are freshman Rachel Buehler and
sophomore Megan Alderete, both
out with torn ACLs.
With the plethora of injuries,
the Cardinal has already felt the
impact of incoming freshmen Gina
Farias-Eisner and Shari Summers,
who have seen increased playing
time. Summers has started all five
matches, recording her first colle
giate goal against Dartmouth,
while Farias-Eisner has started
four of five and tallied seven shots.
Ratcliffe is another newcomer
to the Cardinal, taking over for in
terim co-head coaches Stephanie
Erickson and Paul Sapsford.
Ratcliffe comes to the (Cardinal
from Saint Mary's, where, in 2001
he led the squad to a No. 7 ranking,
the program's highest ever, while
going on to win NSCAA West Re
gion Coach of the Year honors.
Ratcliffe's first five matches as
head coach have proved to be chal
lenging, with the team making con
stant adjustments to account for in
juries. However, the team has
worked its way to a winning record
and is making improvements with
each game.
The Cardinal opened its season
with a shutout victory over Long
Beach State on Aug. 31. The match
remained scoreless until Mar
quand scored the lone goal of the
game on an unassisted shot from 25
yards out in the 83rd minute.
The game marked Barnhart's
23rd career shutout. She tallied just
one save as the stingy Cardinal de
fense allowed the Forty Niners just
one shot.
On Sept. 5, Stanford squared off
against defending national cham
pions Portland (4-2-0). The No. 20
Pilots recorded a 1-0 victory over
the Cardinal on a goal by freshman
Jennifer Tuttle.
Tuttle's goal came unassisted in
the 33rd minute of play and sailed

into the upper left corner of the
net, dashing Stanford's hopes for a
victory.
The Cardinal outshot the Pilots
9-6, but ultimately could not con
vert.
In a very physical match against
No. 6 Pepperdine (5-1-0), Stanford
was again unable to capitalize on
its offensive chances and fell 1-0 to
the Waves.
The Cardinal grossly outshot
the Waves, 18-5, but Pepperdine
goalkeeper Anna Picarelli tallied
eleven saves to keep the shutout in

tact.
"Our inability to finish is defi
nitely a concern," Ratcliffe said.
"Scoring goals has been hard for us
all year, but it is improving."
The Cardinal showed offensive
progress in its trip to Cambridge
for the Harvard Invitational. Stan
ford scored three goals in its two
matches, coming away with a victo
ry in each of its games.
Last Friday, the Cardinal beat
the Crimson 2-1, with goals by
sophomore forward Jennifer
Farenbaugh and senior midfielder

Brittany Oliveira. Both goals were
unassisted, Oliveira's coming in
the 47th minute and Farenbaugh's
in the 73rd.
Barnhart narrowly missed what
would have been her 25th career
shutout, allowing a goal in the final
minute of play to Alisa Sato of
Harvard.
However, Barnhart was able to
pick up the shutout on Sunday
against Dartmouth, when the Car
dinal downed the Big Green, 1-0.
Summers scored the decisive goal
in the 38th minute from 15 yards

out on the right side.
Stanford continues its season at
the Santa Clara/Adidas Classic
with matches against No. 2 Notre
Dame (6-0-0) and Georgia (5-2-0).
The Cardinal will do battle with
the Fighting Irish on Friday at 7
p.m. and the Bulldogs on Sunday at
11 a.m.
"[The Santa Clara/Adidas Clas
sic] will be a huge test for us," Rat
cliffe said. "We have a lot to prove,
especially against Notre Dame.
We'll definitely be going in as un
derdogs."

Senior midfielder Ally Marquand has become one of the Cardinal's main offensive threats, scoring the game-winning goal against Long Beach State. The Cardinal
women's soccer team has overcome injuries to work its way to a 3-2 record this season.
Two weeks into a potentially
three month long season, the No. 24
Stanford women's soccer team (3-
2-0) has already faced the defend
ing national champions, beaten up
on two Ivy League teams, been
upset by a team it had not faced in
more than eight years and suffered
an endless string of injuries.
While the Cardinal squad re
turned six starters, it has two
gaping holes to fill after the grad
uation of Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Year Marcia Wallis
and the loss of senior forward
Marcie Ward to a foot injury.
Ward, a West Region Ail-Amer
ican, will use a medical redshirt
while her foot heals. Without
Ward and Wallis, Stanford is left
without a potent offensive
threat.
