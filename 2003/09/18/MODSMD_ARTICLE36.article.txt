### MAISY SAMUELSON STAFF WRITER 
Sports authorities will meet today at Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center at a conference that
combines legal research with real world data.
The event, which is jointly sponsored by the De
partment of Athletics and the Law School, will
focus on seven key topics in sports, including
amateurism, minorities in sports and intellectu
al property rights.
The featured speakers will present papers on
each topic, followed by a panel discussion made
up of leading figures in the sports world.
"[The conference] brings together the best

people in the industry to discuss issues that are
on the front of the sports page every day," said
assistant Athletic Director and co-conference
organizer Jamie Zaninovich.
Stanford's unique combination of elite acad
emics and athletics creates an excellent forum
in which to examine the link between law and
sports, the event organizers said.
"The inspiration for the conference lies in
the fact that Stanford is probably the only world
class university that has an athletic program
that competes with the pre-eminent athletic in
stitutions," said emeritus law professor and co
conference organizer, Bill Gould. "[Therefore,]
we thought that Stanford was a particularly

suitable site for a discussion of the problems
and issues that are arising in both professional
and amateur athletics."
The two-day conference begins this morning
at 8 a.m. with registration and a continental
breakfast and ends late Friday afternoon after a
series of speakers, including Sandy Alderson
from the MLB and Gene Upshaw from the
NFL Player's Association among others.
The event is open to the public and the cost of
admission varies from $350 for lawyers, Athletic
Department staff and the public to $75 for admis
sion that includes meals or $5 for a meal-free tick
et. For more information visit the Athletic De
