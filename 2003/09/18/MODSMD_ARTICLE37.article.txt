# Sister act takes court
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Move over Collins' twins, a new sib
ling duo will be taking the floor in Maples
Pavilion this year. While their names
may not roll off the tongue with the same
ease as Jarron and Jason, Ogonna and
Njideka Nnamani, bring the same excite
ment and talent to the women's volley
ball program as their basketball-playing
counterparts of yesteryear.
The elder Nnamani, Ogonna, is enter
ing her third year on the Farm. Her first
two seasons have been nothing less than
phenomenal, as she was a member of the
2001 squad, which won the NCAA
championship and has been named an
All-American in both seasons.
"I'm so excited. Words can only ex
press what it means for her to be here,"
Ogonna said of her sister. "And even
better, I know it'll save a lot of money on
my phone bill."
Njideka is one of five freshmen on this
year's team. Like her sister, Njideka was
the star of their high school team in Nor
mal, 111. where she was on the team all
four years of high school and captain her
senior year. In Njideka's four years, she
amassed an amazing number of acco
lades including All-Conference and All-

State honors and was also one of Student
Sports' 2002 "Hot 100 recruits of the
Class of 2003."
Standing two inches shorter than her
outside hitting sister, Njideka played
both outside and setter in high school
and has been moving all over the court
for the Cardinal, including time in the li
brero position.
"One of [Njideka's] biggest strengths
is that she's a very versatile athlete and
can play a lot of positions," Ogonna said,
"I specialize as an outside hitter, but she
has the ability to play anywhere. She also
has great athleticism and is very quick.
She could have played other sports, but
stuck with volleyball throughout high
school."
"I'm willing to play wherever the
team needs me," Njideka added. "I
played setter on my club team, but we
have two great setters in Anna and Katie.
I really enjoy playing librero, its fun to try
something new, but I'm ready to play
wherever I'm needed."
This dynamic sibling pair is only the
third set of sisters to ever play for the
Cardinal, and the first sister-sister pair to
play at the same time. The Rush sisters,
Kari and Wendy, were the closest to this
feat as Kari played from 1980-83 and her
sister Wendy from 1984-87. Additional

ly, there is one other set of sisters playing
in the Pacific-10 Conference, Gabrielle
and Jennifer Abernathy, but they play
for California and Arizona, respectively.
The sisters could have been split up -
Njideka was highly recruited by schools
such as Florida, Northwestern and Notre
Dame but like her sister, Njideka said
that she was drawn to the Farm by, "the
great tradition of the volleyball program
and the academics of the school. Stan
ford is one of the best schools in the
country and it's hard to pass that up."
Early in the season, Njideka notched
her first kill in the team's second match
against Bradley at the University Park
Holiday Inn Classic in Fort Collins, Col.
Also early into her Stanford career,
Njideka is excited about the arrival of her
new class and her freshmen year to come.
"We have five freshman on the team,
and it's been great to get to know them,
but we've been here for a while and it's
going to be exciting to meet the new peo
ple in our class," Njideka said.
"But I love Stanford. I went on a lot of
school visits and I didn't see any other
campus like this one. It's breathtaking,"
she pauses. "I still have to pinch myself
sometimes when I walk around because I
can't believe I go to a school that looks
like this."
