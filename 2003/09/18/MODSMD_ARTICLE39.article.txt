# Advice for freshmen from a pro
## 
### 
Get out a notebook, kiddos it's time
to go to school. Today, I'm supposed
to introduce myself to all your fresh
men (and woman) out there on the
Farm. Drop some knowledge, if you will. So feel
free to take a moment, kick back in your spa
cious Lag double, and prepare to get educated
(somewhat) about sports here at Stanford.
(Warning: the advice here will be dispersed
with little regard for order, clarity or relevance.
If it seems like taking a drink from a hose, get
used to it - you'll shop one lecture that will feel
the same way, I promise.)
First of all, a cold truth...
My freshman year I watched our football team
roll through the Pacific 10 Conference on their
way to the Rose Bowl. After losing (that's
putting it nicely) the opener 69-17 to Texas, the
team ripped off five straight conference wins.
Why do I bring this up? Because you should
know that it probably won't happen this year.
(The Rose Bowl, I mean.. .not another loss like
the Texas one).

But you should still go to
football games. You should
revel in the college football at
mosphere that you've seen on
ESPN for years. You should
enjoy the band, now that
they're back off probation.
You should admire the Tree
and ask someone older than
you about "the incident" with
the shredder when the cos-

tume was stolen by Berkeley in 1998. And you
should already be planning what you're going to
do for Big Game week.
(A lot of fun can be had on the Berkeley cam
pus with 200 Stanford bumper stickers.. .not
that I would know anything about that...)
You should brace yourself for the fact that
the Dollies aren't quite like the cheerleaders
you see on the College Gameday broadcast of
FSU at Miami. But you forget that when they
start dancing in the Claw Fountain during the
Bearial. Hell, you forget it when they dance on
the Band Run. (I actually forget most of what
happened during the Band Run, but that was
back when they allowed beer.. .and allowed
you to run, for that matter.)
But enough about football.
Besides, nothing compares to the noise the
Sixth Man Club makes, when the floor starts
shaking up and down, and Jason Gardner or
Khalid El-Amin is tweaking out and complain
ing to the officials.
Nothing compares to watching the women's
soccer team dominate the competition at Mal
oney field before heading out to party on a
Thursday evening (or returning home to do a
problem set, whichever you prefer). There is no
feeling like biking as fast as you can away from
your first Math 51 section to make it to golf class
and know that your friends on the east coast are
1) freezing cold, 2) already taking midterms, 3)
wishing that they too were in California.
Our volleyball team is ridiculously good. Our
water polo team could beat at least half the
world in international competition.
Find someone who knows how to play slosh
ball, and get them to invite you to the games. If
you don't do this you're missing out on a big part
of Stanford athletics. Don't take any crap from
the Graduate School of Business in intramural
games. Get off campus to see the A's (prefer
ably on a Wednesday, when it's only two bucks)
but try not to get into a fight. And if you go
watch the Raiders - well, God be with you. Al
ternatively, find a sugar mamma and go to Pac
Bell to watch Barry Bonds launch baseballs into
the bay.
Take sailing.
And when spring rolls around, spend some of
your weekends at Sunken Diamond. (At least
go once, on a Tuesday, to one of the free non
conference games.) And as the sun sinks low be
hind the foothills, the fog rolls over the Santa
Cruz mountains, Hoover Tower washed with a
golden glow, a cold beer in the backpack be
neath your chair and the sounds of the summer
game echoing through the air.. .well there's no
place I'd rather be.
