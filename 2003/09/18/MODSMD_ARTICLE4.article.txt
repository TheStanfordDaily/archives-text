# Serial groper returns to campus
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Last year's serial groper may be back.
A Sophomore College student was groped
on Sept. 9 by a bicyclist who matched the de
scription of the man who groped several
women on campus last spring.
The suspected perpetrator of the 16 inci
dents that have been reported since May is de
scribed as a 19- to 30-year-old white or Hispan
ic male who is slightly overweight and has very
short hair. He is believed to be between 5-7 and
5-9.
The bicyclist rides up to women from behind
and grabs their backside as he rides by, then
rides away before victims have a chance to see
his face, although victims have been able to
give descriptions to the police based on his pro-

file.
The incidents have taken place at several lo
cations on Escondido and Mayfield and near
the Law School between 8:30 p.m. and 2 a.m.
Victims have all been on foot.
"Women out walking around should be alert
to those around them," said Sgt. Rick Tipton of
the Department of Public Safety. "If you're as
saulted, you should call 911 immediately. Keep
your cell phone with you at night. The sooner vic
tims act, the easier it will be for us to apprehend
[the groper]."
Stanford has many campus resources to deal
with sexual assault, including The Bridge,
Counseling and Psychological Services, the 5-
SURE anti-rape escort service and Vaden
Health Center's Campus Sexual Assault Re
sponse and Recovery Team.
So far, no has been injured by the groper.
