# Football: Thing of beauty?
## 
### 
Oh to be a freshman again. What a fun
year. You kids have so much to look
forward to: hookups galore, reaching
your ever-increasing alcohol limit,
pregnancy scares and bad roommates.
So get ready for the Sixth Man Club, PWR
research papers, arriving to all sorts of athletic
events and fraternity parties with 25 of your
closest dormmates, and oh yes, I-Hum.
See, the trick is finding the right I-Hum. Oth
erwise you'll end up talking about Ancient
Middle Eastern pest removal for the better part
of a quarter. I'll give you a hint the simpler
the title the better.
"Self, Sacred and the Human Good"?
Not even close.
"Citizenship"? Too many syllables.
"Serious Laughter"? Getting better.
"Things of Beauty"? We have a winner.
It's too bad you freshmen didn't come a cou
ple years ago when "Things of Beauty" was
around. I unfortunately did not take this gem of
an I-Hum, but one assignment from the class

lives forever in the annals of
the Senior Class. Get your
mind out of the gutter, the
word was "annals," look it up.
Anyway, as a field trip, the
class visited a Stanford Foot
ball game.
I'm not kidding.
They were told to observe
the intrinsic beauty of the
game. Watch how the offen
sive line works together in

harmony to allow the running back to majesti
cally sprint through the hole. Watch the corner
back outleap the wide receiver to tip away the
football. Watch how more than half the class
cuts lecture every day.
But you see, the point of this column is not to
discuss your upcoming year, nor is it to talk
about I-Hum, it is simply to point out that you
probably won't find many "Things of Beauty"
in Stanford Football this year.
Nice segue, huh?
Unfortunately, it's a sad reality that we will
most likely have a losing record this year. Fol
lowing a year where we had the sixth hardest
strength of schedule in College Football, we
play only three teams this year that did not at
tend a bowl game: California, BYU and San
Jose State. Of those three, only San Jose State
is a true pushover, as Cal should have gone to a
bowl game last year but NCAA violations
made them ineligible, and BYU consistently
has one of the oldest teams in football because
of Mormon players taking two years off to em
bark on their mission.
So in an effort to see some "Things of Beau
ty" this season, I went to the only game we
could call a near-sure win, against San Jose
State, at home.
And in inspiring fashion, I was pleasantly
surprised with what I saw. Arriving at the end of
the first quarter, I had already missed starting
quarterback and fifth-year senior Chris Lewis'
performance, judged by all as marginal at best,
going 3-7 for 15 yards, but was instead treated
to highly touted redshirt freshman Trent Ed
wards' first collegiate appearance.
At first, it didn't go so well. After leading the
Cardinal down the field with 1:10 left in the first
quarter, Edwards couldn't finish off the march
after an underthrown ball to an open tight end,
Alex Smith, resulted in a poorly dropped ball
and a field goal attempt by my freshman room
mate Mike Sgroi, which was blocked.
"Things of Beauty"? No.
This was closer to "Visions of Mortality."
But you freshman have yet to meet Luke
Powell, who was truly a thing of beauty once the
offense got clicking. Capping off another Ed
wards-led drive with 5:48 left in the second
quarter, Buddy Teevens (that's our coach guys)
called for a ballsy play, but one of my favorites.
Dropping back in the pocket, Edwards lofted a
ball 30 yards in the air to the front right corner
of the endzone, challenging wide receiver Luke
Powell to beat his defensive back to the spot
and/or outjump him for the ball.
Ballsy? Yes.
Smart?
You be the judge, considering that Powell is
a full two inches shorter than every starting San
Jo cornerback.
The point is however, that this combination
of a great call, great play, great throw and great
catch was truly a thing of beauty, and complete
ly unlocked the game for the Cardinal. Powell
would go on to have a career day with 12 catch
es for 172 yards and two touchdowns, and Ed
wards made it clear he should be the starting
quarterback, going 21-37 for 278 total yards and
two touchdowns.
Also of beauty was the Cardinal defense, not
allowing a point after the first quarter. San Jose
State, obviously trying to exploit the Cardinal
secondary, threw a school record 66 pass at
tempts, but we were up to the task and shut
down the Spartan offense.
So in the end, as I left Stanford Stadium,
hopping on my "definitely-not-stolen" bike, I
felt good.
We had dominated a team we should have
dominated, and with a bye week forthcoming,
could legitimately beat BYU in Provo. It looks
like we could have a 2-0 record by the time you
guys have your first IHUM section.
So while we will probably end up with a los
ing record this year, and the Rose Bowl is at
least a couple years off, there'll be some beauty
this year.
If anything, you'll be able to say something
nobody said on a Saturday afternoon last year -
in the words of Ice Cube, someone you won't be
studying in IHUM, "today was a good day."
