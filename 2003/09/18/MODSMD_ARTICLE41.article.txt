# Beck back from mission
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the Brigham Young football team takes the field against Stan
ford on Saturday, its offense will be led, not by a record-shattering Heis
man Trophy contender like Jim McMahon, Steve Young or Ty Detmer,
but by a scrappy true freshman who has completed one pass and thrown
one interception in his short career.
Before Stanford's linebackers start salivating, they should know that
John Beck isn't the stereotypical wide-eyed 18-year-old freshman. An
eagle scout who has been playing tackle football since he was eight, Beck
has been described by BYU head coach Gary Crowton as a "football
junkie" who "has got a real good feel for things."
"I don't ever feel like he's overwhelmed," Crowton said.
Maybe that's because, after he graduated from high school, Beck left
behind his family and his friends and football to travel to Portugal
for two years to spread the word of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
day Saints.
The Mormon mission wasn't mandatory, and Beck said there was no
one there to check up on him and make sure he was spending every day
knocking on doors instead of partying or relaxing.
"At one time on this mission, it was just me and this other guy out on
this island in the Azores," Beck said. "Nobody would know if we slept in,
nobody would know if we didn't go out and talk to people."
To some, that might be an invitation to slack off. To Beck, it was a test
of self-discipline, the kind of challenge he thrives on.
His reward?
"It was good to come back knowing that I worked hard."
That attitude is common among BYU football players, many of whom
go on Church missions before or during their college career. Some believe
the experience makes the players stronger and more mature, not to men
tion older, than its opponents.
"This summer, because of the learning I got on my mission, because of
the maturity that happens when you're on your own in a new country, you
grow a lot and you learn a lot and you try to bring that back into football,"
Beck said.
But he pointed out that the mission is, above all, a sacrifice.
"You don't have time to go to the gym to work out," he said. "Some
times the places I was at there wasn't even a grass field to go throw at."
As a result, when he returned to the United States and joined the BYU
football team, "Some things that were natural instincts now I had to think

about," he said.
But Beck wouldn't trade his experience abroad for more foot
ball practice.
"Just being away from family and friends, you learn a lot about yourself
about what kind of person you are, and what kind of person you want to
be," he said. "In high school you kind of don't really know what things are
the most important in life. Sports and hanging out on the weekends are the
most important.
"I really felt like when I was in high school, I was 17,18, that I was an adult.
I remember my parents saying, 'Oh, you do childish things,'... Then you come
back [from the mission] and realize, 'I was a child, but now I'm a man.'"
And on Saturday, he will be the man Stanford has to stop if it hopes to
beat the favored Cougars. Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said the
team doesn't know enough about Beck to tailor their defensive game plan
to his skills.
"He is somewhat untested, but I just know he's a talented quarterback,
and the guy will be well-coached," Teevens said. "He's a fairly mobile guy,
so that puts a little bit of pressure on you as well."
It would seem like the bulk of the pressure will be on Beck, but he said
he isn't worried.
"I'm actually pretty excited," he said. "A lot of people ask, 'Hey, are
you really nervous?' But not many freshmen get the opportunity to start in
a collegiate game, and I'm looking forward to it."
Beck's window of opportunity may be brief, as he's expected to return
to the bench when sophomore starter Matt Berry recovers from an injury
he sustained last week against New Mexico.
By his own admission, Beck's first experience on the field in the season
opener against Georgia Tech was a disaster.
"Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong in my first series,"
Beck said. "It was horrible because I knew I wasn't going to get another
chance."
On Saturday, Beck hopes and expects to play the whole game. And he
doesn't expect to play like a freshman.
"I'm a very competitive person," he said. "All my life I've been on
teams that have won."
As much as winning, Beck is also looking forward to the chance to
demonstrate that 22 years of hard work and discipline have paid off.
"There's just something about the game, and about working extra, just
going out there and giving everything," he said. "And each week you've
got one game."
He doesn't sound overwhelmed.
