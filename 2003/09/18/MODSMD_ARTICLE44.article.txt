11 Right Now" — This infectious little
ditty was originally recorded in 1970 by tlfe
British band Free (we don't know who they are ei
ther). But since the Band debuted its own versionj
during halftime of the 1972 Rose Bowl, it has moM
phed into the closest thing Stanford has to a figHt
song. Complete with an organized
card-carrying Cardinal fan, the song is payed
after every score in football and after most team
victories.
The Axe — First introduced by Stanford
leaders in 1899 to rally students for a weekend
baseball series against Cal. After Stanford fans
chopped up a bear in effigy, Cal fans succeeded in
stealing the Axe, first displaying it at a fraternity
house before locking it in a bank near campus.
The Axe remained in the vault for over 30 years,
only to be taken out for Cal's annual sopag rally.
In 1930, Stanford recovered the Axe?(iee Immor-

Band, The — The onflwe only, the truly
Leland Stanfora Junior (pause)
Utiivesnsity Marching Band. Though the Band
Shack and the velvet hammer are but sweet mem
ories, the risque field shows live on. Antics like
Tropersonating the Pope and replicating the Irish
HUro famine have resulted in bans from places
■Klmed as Notre Dame University, the state of
Oregon, Disneyland, and CBS, among others.

Big Game First played on March 10,1892, this
pfhowdown between cross-bay rivals Stanford and
Cal has been played annually ever a
hiatus only during World f War I. Last season's
matchup at Cal's Memorial Stadium marked die
105 th Big Game and ended in a 30-7 victory for
the Bears, their first Big Game win in the past
seven years. The matchup was followed by quite a
show, as thousands of Cal fans rushed the field,
tore down the goal posts, and made the Cardinal
onlookers roll their eyes, grateful to be on the
non-Neanderthal side of the rivalry.

%p^-al — The University of California at Berke
ley, also known as UCB. The school's massive in
feriority complex has fueled a rivalry between
and Stanford that has lasted well over 100 years.
Famous alumni include ... well, nobody comes |c|
mind.
Cardinal — Stanford's official nickname ancr
along with white, its official color. Made official in
the early 1980s by then-University President
Donald Kennedy (see Indians). Though Cardinal
won out, students polled at the time of the deci
sion favored robber barons. If only.

Arar aily, The Affectionate nickname for
Stanford's student newspaper, home to the best
Cardinal sports coverage within Campus Drive.
Of course, half of the student body has never read
The Daily, as the paper is most useful on Sunday
nights at Mem Aud...But that's a whole other tra
dition.

Dollies Decked out in cardinal-and-white-col
ored dresses and white gloves, these five women
stand by their man (see the Tree) and dance up a
storm at all band-attended events. Don't even try
comparing them with USC's cheerleaders. The
Dollies are much...smarter.

lway, John Stud Cardinal quarterback
from 1979-82. Elway set Stanford's season and ca
reer touchdown records with 27 and 77, respec
tively. He followed this by spending 17 seasons
with the Denver Broncos, finally earning two
Super Bowl championships in 1998 and 1999. (We
like to forget about him selfishly refusing to play
for Baltimore after being drafted by the Colts in

youngsters to remember. Wal jStero back in the

through the annual NCAA Tournament. This

upset then-No, 1 Arizona in Tbcson and then went
on to finish second in the Pacific 10 Conference.

w
ould, Dick — The legendary coach of the
men's tennjs team, Gould has led the Cardinal to
17 national titles in his 36 years on the Farm. Also
he's one of the nicest guys on campus.

jgSSt
Wr oover, Herbert — Thirty-first President of
the United States and former manager of the Car
dinal football team. Hoover helped organize the
first Big Game between Stanford and Cal in
March of 1892. However, he is the one who re
portedly forgot the game ball, forcing local mer
chants to get one from his store, delaying the start
of the game by two hours.

T
mmortal 21 —The group of Stanford stu
dents who in 1930 stole back the Axe from the evil
clutches of the Cal Bears. While two of the 21
posed as reporters and asked to
the Axe before it was returned to the vault
ers, disguised as Cal students, crowded next to the
| Axe for the picture. With the explosion of flash
bulbs and tear gas, the 21 made off with the Axe
and returned it to the Farm triumphantly.

Indians — The original Stanford mascot and
inickname, abandoned in 1972 because it was con
sidered politically incorrect. Other schools have
since picked up on the idea. Crusty alumni still
find it necessary to don Indian buttons at football
games.

SA r effrey, Clyde Track star of the late 1930s
and early 40's, Jeffrey won the 1939 NCAA
Championship in the 220-yard dash before going
on to set a 100-yard dash record with a time of 9.4
seconds. Yeah, and we cfiuldn't think of anything
else that started with a J.

ft night, Brevin Possibly as responsible as
Coach Montgomery for the success of Stanford
basketball, Knight, Class of 1997, was named an
Ail-American after leading the Cardinal into
three consecutive NCAA Tournament appear
ances, capped by the school's first-ever march
into the Sweet Sixteen. While his star dimmed
after his replacement (see Lee, Art) led Stan
ford to tjie promised land (see Final Four), his
greatness is without doubt.

/
mmr ee, Art — Also known as King Arthur for
his stirring play in Stanford's run to the 1998 Final
Four. This point-guard's (1995-99) frenzied final
minute of play (see Miracle Minute) against
Rhode Island pushed the Cardinal into San Anto
nio, where Stanford lost to Kentucky, the eventu
al national champion, in overtime. Don't blame
Art though. He spotted 26 on the Wildcats.
Leland, Dr. Ted — A former Cardinal assistant
football coach, Leland has been Stanford's fifth
Athletic Director since June 1991. During his
time on campus, Stanford has won an astounding
40 National Championships. The financial success
has been as impressive. Since Leland arrived, the
athletic department has raised over $195 million
in private donations and watched its endowment
grow from $62 million to $350 million. Not bad for
a Stanford Ph.D. ('82J§
Luisetti, Hank — All-American basketball play
er in the 1930s credited with introducing the coun
try to the one-handed shot. Though this method
of shooting has long been discredited and this bit
of basketball trivia has been long forgotten by
anyone outside of Palo Alto, a statue in his honor
continues to reside in Maples Pavilion. His No. 7
is the only basketball jersey to have been retired
by the Department of Athletics.

K K w"dsen, Mark — Also known as the Mad
Dog, this power forward (1996-2000) was notori
ously rowdy on the court and cuddly off of it. One
of the most popular players in Stanford history,
this King Kong imitator won two NBA Champi
onship rings with the Lakers and has found a new
home in Minnesota with the Timberwolves. Even
considering his shocking victory parade dance
displays, Mad Dog's still a Stanford hero.
Maples Pavilion — Opened in 1969, Roscoe
Maples Pavilion is home to both the men's and
women's basketball teams and well as the
women's volleyball team. Maples is legendary for

over 500 more victories than the next skipper on
the list. A former Cardinal baseball and football
star himself, he coached the baseball team to the

In 1988 he coached the U.S. baseball

McEnroe, John —
The most famous of
many champi
onship tennis play
ers to come out of I
Stanford. McEn
roe, who stayed at
Stanford only one
year, captured the
NCAA singles title in
1978 before going on
to win seven Grand
Slam titles. Lost some
luster by referring to
Stanford's reigning
singles champion,
Alex Kim, as "Andy"
during the 2000 U.S.
Open.

Miracle Men — In the Mid
west Regional Finals
of the 1998 NCAA
Men's Basketball W


Tournament, Stanford accomplished the unthinkable.
Trailing Rhode Island by six points with 59 seconds
remaining in the game, Art Lee came through in a big
way. Lee scored eight points, dished out two assists -
including one to a driving, dunking, screaming Mad
Dog (see Madsen, Mark) - and made the pivotal
steal to give the Cardinal its first-ever Final Four ap
pearance.
Montgomery, Mike Though he's lost the glasses
and upgraded the wardrobe, he's forever Monty. Now
entering his 18th season at the helm, Montgomery is
the all-time winningest coach at Stanford. He has led
the Cardinal to the NCAA Tournament for a school
record nine straight years,

Morales, Pablo Arguably the greatest collegiate
swimmer ever, Morales (1984-87) brok| an NCAA
record by bringing home 11 NCAA individual titles.
Murphy, Bob A former Cardinal pitching Ice,
Murphy has spent over 30 years in the broadcast
booth, calling the play-by-play for Cardinal football
and men's basketball games. Just don't get him start
ed on the ideal of a University Gate. Now there's
some righteous indignation.

m Championships Our bag, baby.
Stanford has claimed 95 team NCAA Champi
onships, including a record 70 since 1980. Stanford
also holds the record for most championships in one
academic year, which it set by bringing home six titles
in 1996-97 and the most total individual champi
onships, with 374.
Nevers, Ernie According to a 1962 Sports Illustrat
ed, this nimble runner was the greatest college foot
ball player of all time. Maybe if that said 1992, we'd
care. We love ya' Ernie, but...

iOLski "Hi, I'm Oski, and I'm a massive tool."
~, Though Cal's mascot is supposed to be the Golden
Bear, Oski looks more like a sick beaver. In contrast
to the wild antics of Stanford's Tree, Oski high-steps
along silently in one of the ugliest yellow button-up
sweaters ever seen. Come to think of it, have you ever
seen an attractive yellow button-up sweater?

ac-10 Conference of Champions and home of
the Cardinal. Along with Arizona, Arizona State, Cal,
Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA, USC, Washington and
Washington State, the Pac-10 is the only conference to
win ten team NCAA Championships in one academic
year, a feat it has accomplished several times.

The Play The most bizarre and fa
mous highlight clip in college foot
ball, courtesy of the 1982 Big
„ Game. After driving the length
of the field, then-Cardinal se
nior John Elway brought his
mm team from behind to take a
one point lead with four sec
onds left to go. Stanford exe
cuted a squib kick to run out
the clock, but what ensued
was pure chaos. The kick was
picked up by the Bears' Kevin
MPI Boen. Five laterals and 57
years later, Boen had to the
ball again and wove his way
through the Stanford band, which
had stormed the field, thinking
the game was over. The Play
ended with Boen hammering
Cardinal trombonist Gary
Tyrell as he scored the game
winning touchdown. But did
we see a knee touch back on
the thirty-yard line?

Plunkett, Jim Stanford's! only Heisman Trophy
winners (1970). Plunkett was a consensus first-team
All-Am|rican and was named MVP after leading
Stanford Jo an upset 27-17 victory over Ohio State in
the 1971 Rose Bowl. Plunkett set school and NCAA
records for total offense with 7,887 yards. He went on
to win two Super Bowl Championships with the Oak
land and Los Angeles Raider! earning 1981 Super
Bdwl MVP honors in the process. m

friends. If you're a little kid looking for a foul ball, a
student wanting to stand on the back row at Maples, a
friend holding up a harmless sign of enragement or
any other similar danger to society, watch out.
Rose Bowl —The desired goal of every Stanford foot
ball team, also known to Keith Jackson as the Grand
daddy of 'em all. The Cardinal has appeared in 12
Rose Bowls, the most recent being in 2000, its first ap
pearance since going back-to-back in 1971 and 1972.

Ml
Man Club Stanford basketball's notori
ous student section. While the club reached its heyday
during the Cardinal's 1998 run to the Final Four, it has
steadily devolved. This increasingly unfunny group is
bordering on being called the Bandwagon Bunch.
Like a sad cross-section of Atlanta Braves fans, these
guys don't understand that when a team's down, that's
when it needs more cheers. But otherwise, we love it.
Stanford Stadium Home of the Cardinal football
team since Nov. 19, 1921. Site of Herbert Hoover's
Presidential nomination acceptance speech, Super
Bowl XXIV, six 1994 World Cup soccer matches, a
couple of 1999 Women's World Cup contests.
Sunken Diamond Since 1931, it's been the place to
watch college baseball. Even though recent renova
tions have taken away the great sunning hill and made
it easier for Redcoats (see R) to clamp down, it's still
almost perfect on |Jbnny May afternoon.

eevens, Buddy The jury is still out on whether
Teevens is a legitimate football coach or a spy sent
from Cal to give them back the Axe. But he's a nice
guy, so we'll still let him be our Buddy.
Trench Dogs Nickname of the group of defensive
players whose mouths, if not their play, helped push
the Cardinal into the 2000 Rose Bowl. Troy Walters
and the offense the stars, but Willie Howard and
the dogs held enoupf ground for Stanford to celebrate
the new millennium in style.
Tree Stanford's mascot, well, the Band's anyway.
Selected every year from a group of frighteningly
eager students during try-outs, the Tree accompanies
the Band ap|l the Dories to events and generally
wreaks havlS while spreading love and joy. Looks
cuddly, but-watch out Oskif—this fern's got splinters.
Twins 2: O ne prize recruit won't do, so Stanford gets
a pair. From the Bryans of tennis to the Hausers and
of cross-country to the Collinses of bas
ketDaMo the Hunts of soccer, twins have
been almost a trademar!|of the Cardinal.

i Two-Sport Stars Another Cardinal trademark, Stan
ford has had more than its share of Bo Jackson imitators.
The Cardinal football/baseball combination includes Joe
Borchard, Toi Cook, John Elway, Chad Hutchinson,
Brian Johnson, Mark Marquess and Ernie Nevers and
current Stanford freshman Evan Moore. Kristin Folkl
earned All-American honors in volleyball and basket
ball, and the NFL's Teyo Johnson was a power forward
and a wide receiver in his time on the Farm.

%om. ltimate A club sport, Ultimate Frisbee is one
of the most popular pastimes at Stanford. Both the
men's and the women's teams are annual national con
tenders. They often like to run around at night throw
ing Frisbees at fountains and doorways in a silly little
hobby called "Frisbee golf". No balls or clubs are in
volved. .g

VanDerveer has led the Stanford women lb five Final
Fours and two national championships. She has been
named National Coach of the Year three times and led
the U.S. National team to the medal at the 1996
Olympics. jg
Vow Boys, The - After the varsity football squad suf
fered a 13-0 loss to USC in 1932, freshman Frank Alus
tiza made his teammates vow that they would never
mop another game to the Trojans. The teams kept its
word, sweeping the hated Trojans during its three var
sity years, earning the adoration of thousands and a
nickname that continues to inspire devotion.

IMMfealsh, Bill Stanford's most famous football
coach. Even though he took the Cardinal to three
Bowl games, he had more success after heading to the
NFL. With the 49ers, Walsh won three Super Bowls
and in 1993, "the Genius" was inducted into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.
