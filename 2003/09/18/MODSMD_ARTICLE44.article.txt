11 Right Now" — This infectious little
ditty was originally recorded in 1970 by tlfe
British band Free (we don't know who they are ei
ther). But since the Band debuted its own versionj
during halftime of the 1972 Rose Bowl, it has moM
phed into the closest thing Stanford has to a figHt
song. Complete with an organized
card-carrying Cardinal fan, the song is payed
after every score in football and after most team
victories.
The Axe — First introduced by Stanford
leaders in 1899 to rally students for a weekend
baseball series against Cal. After Stanford fans
chopped up a bear in effigy, Cal fans succeeded in
stealing the Axe, first displaying it at a fraternity
house before locking it in a bank near campus.
The Axe remained in the vault for over 30 years,
only to be taken out for Cal's annual sopag rally.
In 1930, Stanford recovered the Axe?(iee Immor-

Band, The — The onflwe only, the truly
Leland Stanfora Junior (pause)
Utiivesnsity Marching Band. Though the Band
Shack and the velvet hammer are but sweet mem
ories, the risque field shows live on. Antics like
Tropersonating the Pope and replicating the Irish
HUro famine have resulted in bans from places
■Klmed as Notre Dame University, the state of
Oregon, Disneyland, and CBS, among others.

Big Game First played on March 10,1892, this
pfhowdown between cross-bay rivals Stanford and
Cal has been played annually ever a
hiatus only during World f War I. Last season's
matchup at Cal's Memorial Stadium marked die
105 th Big Game and ended in a 30-7 victory for
the Bears, their first Big Game win in the past
seven years. The matchup was followed by quite a
show, as thousands of Cal fans rushed the field,
tore down the goal posts, and made the Cardinal
onlookers roll their eyes, grateful to be on the
non-Neanderthal side of the rivalry.

%p^-al — The University of California at Berke
ley, also known as UCB. The school's massive in
feriority complex has fueled a rivalry between
and Stanford that has lasted well over 100 years.
Famous alumni include ... well, nobody comes |c|
mind.
Cardinal — Stanford's official nickname ancr
along with white, its official color. Made official in
the early 1980s by then-University President
Donald Kennedy (see Indians). Though Cardinal
won out, students polled at the time of the deci
sion favored robber barons. If only.

Arar aily, The Affectionate nickname for
Stanford's student newspaper, home to the best
Cardinal sports coverage within Campus Drive.
Of course, half of the student body has never read
The Daily, as the paper is most useful on Sunday
nights at Mem Aud...But that's a whole other tra
dition.

Dollies Decked out in cardinal-and-white-col
ored dresses and white gloves, these five women
stand by their man (see the Tree) and dance up a
storm at all band-attended events. Don't even try
comparing them with USC's cheerleaders. The
Dollies are much...smarter.

lway, John Stud Cardinal quarterback
from 1979-82. Elway set Stanford's season and ca
reer touchdown records with 27 and 77, respec
tively. He followed this by spending 17 seasons
with the Denver Broncos, finally earning two
Super Bowl championships in 1998 and 1999. (We
like to forget about him selfishly refusing to play
for Baltimore after being drafted by the Colts in
Evans, Janet Might be tc o old for all you
youngsters to remember. Wal jStero back in the

through the annual NCAA Tournament. This

upset then-No, 1 Arizona in Tbcson and then went
on to finish second in the Pacific 10 Conference.

w
ould, Dick — The legendary coach of the
men's tennjs team, Gould has led the Cardinal to
17 national titles in his 36 years on the Farm. Also
he's one of the nicest guys on campus.

jgSSt
Wr oover, Herbert — Thirty-first President of
the United States and former manager of the Car
dinal football team. Hoover helped organize the
first Big Game between Stanford and Cal in
March of 1892. However, he is the one who re
portedly forgot the game ball, forcing local mer
chants to get one from his store, delaying the start
of the game by two hours.

T
mmortal 21 —The group of Stanford stu
dents who in 1930 stole back the Axe from the evil
clutches of the Cal Bears. While two of the 21
posed as reporters and asked to
the Axe before it was returned to the vault
ers, disguised as Cal students, crowded next to the
| Axe for the picture. With the explosion of flash
bulbs and tear gas, the 21 made off with the Axe
and returned it to the Farm triumphantly.

Indians — The original Stanford mascot and
inickname, abandoned in 1972 because it was con
sidered politically incorrect. Other schools have
since picked up on the idea. Crusty alumni still
find it necessary to don Indian buttons at football
games.

SA r effrey, Clyde Track star of the late 1930s
and early 40's, Jeffrey won the 1939 NCAA
Championship in the 220-yard dash before going
on to set a 100-yard dash record with a time of 9.4
seconds. Yeah, and we cfiuldn't think of anything
else that started with a J.

ft night, Brevin Possibly as responsible as
Coach Montgomery for the success of Stanford
basketball, Knight, Class of 1997, was named an
Ail-American after leading the Cardinal into
three consecutive NCAA Tournament appear
ances, capped by the school's first-ever march
into the Sweet Sixteen. While his star dimmed
after his replacement (see Lee, Art) led Stan
ford to tjie promised land (see Final Four), his
greatness is without doubt.

mmr ee, Art — Also known as King Arthur for
his stirring play in Stanford's run to the 1998 Final
Four. This point-guard's (1995-99) frenzied final
minute of play (see Miracle Minute) against
Rhode Island pushed the Cardinal into San Anto
nio, where Stanford lost to Kentucky, the eventu
al national champion, in overtime. Don't blame
Art though. He spotted 26 on the Wildcats.
Leland, Dr. Ted — A former Cardinal assistant
football coach, Leland has been Stanford's fifth
Athletic Director since June 1991. During his
time on campus, Stanford has won an astounding
40 National Championships. The financial success
has been as impressive. Since Leland arrived, the
athletic department has raised over $195 million
in private donations and watched its endowment
grow from $62 million to $350 million. Not bad for
a Stanford Ph.D. ('82J§
Luisetti, Hank — All-American basketball play
er in the 1930s credited with introducing the coun
try to the one-handed shot. Though this method
of shooting has long been discredited and this bit
of basketball trivia has been long forgotten by
anyone outside of Palo Alto, a statue in his honor
continues to reside in Maples Pavilion. His No. 7
is the only basketball jersey to have been retired
by the Department of Athletics.

K K w"dsen, Mark — Also known as the Mad
Dog, this power forward (1996-2000) was notori
ously rowdy on the court and cuddly off of it. One
of the most popular players in Stanford history,
this King Kong imitator won two NBA Champi
onship rings with the Lakers and has found a new
home in Minnesota with the Timberwolves. Even
considering his shocking victory parade dance
displays, Mad Dog's still a Stanford hero.
Maples Pavilion — Opened in 1969, Roscoe
Maples Pavilion is home to both the men's and
women's basketball teams and well as the
women's volleyball team. Maples is legendary for
its springy floor (the better to reduce knee in-

The most famous of

ers to come out of I
Stanford. McEn
roe, who stayed at
Stanford only one
year, captured the
NCAA singles title in
1978 before going on
to win seven Grand

luster by referring to
Stanford's reigning
singles champion,
Alex Kim, as "Andy"
