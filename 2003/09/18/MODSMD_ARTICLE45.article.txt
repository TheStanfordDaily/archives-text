# Women face Bears

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR 
This weekend's field hockey game against Cal
ifornia is more than just a game against a rival. It
is more than just a game against a Northern Pacif
ic Athletic Conference opponent. And it is more
than just a game against a team that barely out
matched the Cardinal last season.
"It is important for our pride and reputation. It
is important for our morale," said senior forward
Noor Dawood of the young team. "In a game as
big as this one, we always feel like we want re
venge."
After losing all three of its closely matched
games against the No. 14 Golden Bears (2-0) last
season, including the NorPac championship title,
Stanford (2-4) is looking forward to its first match
against Cal this season, which currently stands
atop the NorPac Western Conference.
"We're very well prepared to take care of our
own game," said first-year Stanford head coach
Lesley Irvine.
The Cardinal is also eyeing the game as a
chance to prove itself and perhaps even get a little
payback for its tough losses last year.
"If we can beat them early in the season it'll
give us confidence going into the playoffs. It's a
good way to prove we can perform," said NorPac
Rookie of the Week Cara-Lynn Lopresti.
But it won't be easy.
To be successful, the Cardinal will have to per
form well against Cal players such as All-Ameri
can senior midfielder Nora Feddersen and junior
forward Amber Madsen who leads her team in
goals scored (4). Madsen was also named NorPac

Offensive Player of the Week.
It will be a game that showcases an experi
enced and skilled Cal team versus an extremely
young Stanford squad that has tons of potential.
How young?
Freshmen and sophomores make up 12 of the
18 players on the Cardinal's roster this season.
But that doesn't mean we should consider
them complete foreigners to the game. The eight
incoming freshmen include participants from the
National under-20 team, the Junior Olympics,
All-Conference selection and All-Section teams.
"We are definitely a young team," Irvine said.
"We are definitely looking for freshmen to fill
roles, especially on defense."
But while freshmen, like Lopresti who scored
three goals in her first game, have exceeded in
their roles the first two weeks, Irvine is quick to
add that there is always something to be improved
upon. She pointed out that a few errors have con
tributed to the young team not always getting in
position.
Stanford has been out shot by opponents 115-
58 in the past six games. However, the margin be
tween goals scored pn average, 2.00 to 3.17, is not
as wide mostly because of senior goalkeeper
Emily Zander and sophomore goalkeeper Ana
Kravolec. The two have combined for 56 total
saves. The Stanford team has also done rather
well in penalty corners the last few games.
"All we ask of ourselves is that we keep im
proving," Irvine said.
Stanford's matchup against Cal is set for 1 p.m.
on Saturday.
