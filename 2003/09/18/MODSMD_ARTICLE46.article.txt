# Cross-country teams keep last year's pace
## Men and women runners join legacy of top-performing Card squad 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Yet again, both the men's and women's
Stanford cross country teams have lost nu
merous All-American caliber runners to
graduation.
And yet again, the Cardinal will be in
the hunt for a national title.
The men's team seeks to repeat its 2002
NCAA Championship season and looks to
be more than capable. Other than a change
in the head coach, the squad is essentially

identical to the one that took home cham
pionship last year.
Andrew Gerard will replace head coach
Vin Lananna, who accepted the position of
Athletic Director at Oberlin College in
Ohio.
Nine-time All-American senior Grant
Robison leads the Cardinal squad. Robi
son took home the Pacific-10 Conference
Individual Championship last year as well
as placing third at the NCAA Champi
onships.
In addition to Robison, the Cardinal
features All-Americans Louis Luchini,
Donald Sage, lan Dobson, Adam Ten
forde and Seth Hejny.
Luchini, Sage and Dobson all had top
nine individual finishes at the NCAAs.
Tenforde was the fifth Cardinal runner
and is expected to continue to make a

heavy impact.
Hejny redshirted during the Cardinal's
2002 championship campaign, but is ex
pected to return to his All-American form.
Additionally, contributions are anticipat
ed from juniors Ryan Hall, Chris Emme
and Robert Smitson.
On the women's side, the squad will be
without four-time All-American Lauren
Fleshman, who the team lost to gradua
tion, but the Cardinal still returns four of
its seven runners from last year's NCAA
runner-up team.
Even more key for Stanford will be ju
niors Sara Bei and Alicia Craig. Both are
considered among the nation's elite long
distance runners.
Craig finished last year in style after
being crowned the NCAA West Regional
Individual Champion and finishing third

individually at the NCAA Championships.
Rounding out the foursome of runners
who also boast NCAA Championship ex
perience are juniors Anita Siraki and
Jeane Goff. Siraki was the team's work
horse last year, competing in all seven of
Stanford's races.
Stanford head coach Dena Evans said
she is very excited about the incoming pool
of talent in the freshman class. Headlining
the group is Arianna Lambie, the most
highly sought after high school middle dis
tance runner in the nation.
Nine other freshmen join Lambie, in
cluding twin sisters Amanda and Katy
Trotter, two of the nation's top two-milers.
Footlocker National Finalist Julie Allen
also joins the team and looks to contribute.
The contributions of younger runners
have already been felt in the Cardinal's

only meet of the season. Both the men's
and women's team competed and domi
nated at the Bronco Invitational in Bel
mont.
Redshirt freshman Jonathan Pierce
took home the men's individual title, post
ing the course's third fastest time ever. The
men took the top-five places. Its 15 point
performance was 30 better than second
place finisher Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
The women were almost as dominant,
scoring 17 points and taking the top four
spots. The squad was led by Sara Bei, who
just beat out teammates Katy Trotter and
Jeane Goff.
The Cardinal has a break from competi
tion until Sept. 27, when it hosts the Stan
ford Invitational. Both the men's and
women's teams look to maintain domi
nance over the rest of the field
