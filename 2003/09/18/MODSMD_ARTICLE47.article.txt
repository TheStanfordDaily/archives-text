## Recruits Summers and Farias-Eisner aid injured team 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For highly touted freshmen soc
cer players Shari Summers and
Gina Farias-Eisner, coming to Stan
ford has been a life-long dream.
"I have always wanted to come
here," Farias-Eisner said. "I've
been wearing a Stanford sweatshirt
since I was a freshman in high
school."
Summers had a slightly different
take, but the end result was the
same.
"I wanted to go Stanford since I
was really little, just because of the
academic prestige, and when I
found out how well the soccer team
was doing, my decision was even
easier," Summers said. "Everything
around here is great: The campus is
beautiful, you're going to get an

awesome education and the soccer
is played at such a high level. It's re
ally everything I wanted in a school
put into one."
Both Summers, a graduate of
Valencia High School, and Farias-
Eisner, a graduate of Harvard-
Westlake, enjoyed highly successful
high school careers in addition to
playing together on the West Valley
Samba club team that took home
both a regional and national title in
2002.
Summers earned McDonald's
and Parade Magazine All-America
honors in 2003 as well as being se
lected to the Region IV Olympic
Development Program team.
Farias-Eisner captained the
Samba team in addition to being
named Los Angeles Daily News
Player of the Year as a senior.
Summers and Farias-Eisner
have made an immediate impact on
the Stanford squad.
With the entire team plagued by
injury, opportunities have present
ed themselves to the two freshmen.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
has asked Summers and Farias-

Eisner to step up early in their ca
reers.
"The biggest difference has been
the overall intensity and level of
play," Summers said. "The girls are
so much more experienced here [at
the collegiate level] and the pace of
play is so much quicker."
"I knew that everyone would be
amazing, but how intense every
thing is, it's just nothing like I've
ever experienced before," Farias-
Eisner added. "But the only thing
[that intensity] can do is make you
improve."
Rather than let the increased in
tensity level frustrate them, the two
freshmen have found ways to use it
to their advantage.
"[On the team] people are con
stantly battling for position out
here," Summers said. "But I think it
creates an awesome atmosphere be
cause it makes everyone work hard
and our team is only going to get
better if everyone is pushing each
other."
Summers has started all five Car
dinal matches and scored the
match's only goal in No. 24 Stan

ford's (3-2-0) victory over Dart
mouth.
Farias-Eisner has also made her
presence felt at the offensive end of
the pitch, racking up 11 shots in four
starts.
With several of the more experi
enced Cardinal players making
speedy recoveries, Summers' and
Farias-Eisner's starting jobs are not
guaranteed.
"When we have some of our up
perclassmen return from injury,
they may not retain their starting
roles," Ratcliffe said. "They have
done a tremendous job filling in and
will definitely continue to see signif
icant time as substitutes."
In addition to facing off against
No. 3 Notre Dame (6-0-0) on Fri
day, Summers and Farias-Eisner
have one more thing to be excited
about.
Moving into their dorms and
meeting the other incoming fresh
men was the unanimous response as
to what they were looking forward
to most.
"That's if we don't kill ourselves
moving in," Summers added.
