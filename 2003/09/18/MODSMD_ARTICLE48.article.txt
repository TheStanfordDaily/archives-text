## Freshman receiver Bradford has big shoes to fill

true calling (football, of course) and
was also named the California Fresh
man of the year his first year hooping it
up.
So, this obviously begs a very im
portant question.
How have these basketball skills
translated onto the gridiron?
"Basketball helped me get a sense
of how to find open spots," Bradford
explained. "You gotta also learn to box
your man out and get used to having
guys come over your back."
Basketball seems out of the ques
tion, though, since Bradford's got all
that football talent.
And Stanford can't be happier that
they ended up with the talent for the
next fifty Saturdays.
But who's counting?
One look at Mark Bradford, and
you can tell he's your consummate ath
lete. The guy has pogo-stick legs, arms
as long as Gumby and, most impor
tantly, the quiet confidence of a win
ner.
Bradford, a consensus Prep All-
American wide receiver out of high
school, was Stanford's biggest offsea
son catch.
"Bradford will be thrown in the re
ceiving ranks immediately for the Car
dinal," writes ESPN's recruiting guru,
Tom Lemming. "[He] has excellent
separation speed, good hands and

tremendous body control."
Bradford didn't always dream of
coming to Stanford.
But as Bradford's decision process
may tell us, Palo Alto might have been
his destiny all along.
The 6-foot-2,190-pound freshman
from Fremont High School in Los An
geles, was on everybody's hot list his se
nior year. He was considered by some
to be the top wide receiver on the West
Coast, by many to be one of the top 100
players in the United States and was
ranked as high as the No. 6 wide re
ceiver in the country by Rivals.com.
All the big schools came calling.
LSU, USC, Notre Dame, Washington
and UCLA all wanted him.
Stanford did too.
And for a while, it seemed like the
Cardinal was out of his long-term
plans.
In an interview he gave on Dec. 5 to
theinsiders.com, a recruiting Web site,

Bradford mentioned that USC, Notre
Dame and LSU were his favorites out
of his suitors.
But by the spring, Stanford had en
tered the discussion prominently, and
seemed to be neck-and-neck with
LSU. At the last minute, the Tigers
pulled their offer to Bradford because
they filled their scholarship commit
ment ceiling.
USC re-entered Bradford's main
focus after an unofficial visit sold him
on his prominence as a wide receiver in
their offense.
In the end, it came down to the two
Pac 10 Conference rivals vying for
Bradford's services and he chose
the Cardinal.
Though coach Buddy Teevens said
that "the high profile guys usually go
through a process like that with a last
minute decision," Bradford's
eleventh-hour resolution was pretty
atypical.
The recruit inked on with the Car
dinal at the last possible moment —on
signing day, Feb. 5. And his justifica
tion was the one all the players seem to
use.
"The recruiting process was crazy,"
he said. "But Stanford edged out
everyone with the academics."
As much impact as a Stanford de
gree had on Bradford's thinking, his of
ficial visit to Stanford and home stay
with quarterback Trent Edwards left a
lasting impression on both young guns.
Edwards was immediately enam
ored with the big-time prospect.
"It's definitely great having a guy
like that out there," Edwards says.
"He's probably going to take Luke
[Powell's] place when he's out of here
next year."
The warm feeling was mutual.
"Trent is one of the coolest guys at
Stanford," Bradford says. "He's one of
the biggest reasons I came here.
"Just having a quarterback of that
high caliber for the next four years is a
huge plus."
In his first game, Bradford dropped
his first collegiate catch opportunity—
sent to him courtesy from his pal Ed
wards so he wanted to make sure he
caught the next ball that came his way.
You might have missed it, but late
in the first half of the Cardinal's game
against San Jose State, Edwards lofted
a ball over the middle that was a little
too high for Bradford to catch.
So he improvised.
He reached up with his right hand
and pulled down the pigskin one-hand
ed as he slammed to the ground.
"It felt kind of easy when I was
doing it, but when I watched it on film,
I was like 'I don't know how I caught
that,"' Bradford jokes.
Edwards wasn't the least bit sur
prised Bradford introduced himself to
the world of college football in such a
flashy way.
"He's been making plays like that
all summer long," Edwards says.
Ask Bradford about his favorite
physical tool and he begins to sound,
oddly enough, like a basketball player.
"I really value my ability to be phys
ical," he says. "I can get the ball in traf
fic and when the ball is thrown in the
air, I know I'm going to be the one to
get that ball."
The thing is, Bradford who tries
to model his game after the ostenta
tious Freddie Mitchell used to be
one of those hoopsters.
He averaged 15 points a game as a
junior before quitting to focus on his

As much impact as a Stanford de
gree had on Bradford's thinking, his of
ficial visit to Stanford and home stay
with quarterback Trent Edwards left a
lasting impression on both young guns.
Edwards was immediately enam
ored with the big-time prospect.
"It's definitely great having a guy
like that out there," Edwards says.
"He's probably going to take Luke
[Powell's] place when he's out of here
next year."
The warm feeling was mutual.
"Trent is one of the coolest guys at
Stanford," Bradford says. "He's one of
the biggest reasons I came here.
"Just having a quarterback of that
high caliber for the next four years is a
huge plus."
In his first game, Bradford dropped
his first collegiate catch opportunity—
sent to him courtesy from his pal Ed

caught the next ball that came his way.
You might have missed it, but late
in the first half of the Cardinal's game
against San Jose State, Edwards lofted
a ball over the middle that was a little
too high for Bradford to catch.
So he improvised.
He reached up with his right hand
and pulled down the pigskin one-hand

"It felt kind of easy when I was
doing it, but when I watched it on film,
I was like 'I don't know how I caught
that,"' Bradford jokes.

true calling (football, of course) and
was also named the California Fresh
man of the year his first year hooping it
up.
So, this obviously begs a very im
portant question.
How have these basketball skills
translated onto the gridiron?
"Basketball helped me get a sense
of how to find open spots," Bradford
explained. "You gotta also learn to box
your man out and get used to having
guys come over your back."
Basketball seems out of the ques
tion, though, since Bradford's got all
that football talent.
And Stanford can't be happier that
they ended up with the talent for the
next fifty Saturdays.
But who's counting?
One look at Mark Bradford, and
you can tell he's your consummate ath
lete. The guy has pogo-stick legs, arms
as long as Gumby and, most impor
tantly, the quiet confidence of a win
ner.
Bradford, a consensus Prep All-
American wide receiver out of high
school, was Stanford's biggest offsea
son catch.
"Bradford will be thrown in the re
ceiving ranks immediately for the Car
dinal," writes ESPN's recruiting guru,
Tom Lemming. "[He] has excellent
separation speed, good hands and

tremendous body control."
Bradford didn't always dream of
coming to Stanford.
But as Bradford's decision process
may tell us, Palo Alto might have been
his destiny all along.
The 6-foot-2,190-pound freshman
from Fremont High School in Los An
geles, was on everybody's hot list his se
nior year. He was considered by some
to be the top wide receiver on the West
Coast, by many to be one of the top 100
players in the United States and was
ranked as high as the No. 6 wide re
ceiver in the country by Rivals.com.
All the big schools came calling.
LSU, USC, Notre Dame, Washington
and UCLA all wanted him.
Stanford did too.
And for a while, it seemed like the
Cardinal was out of his long-term
plans.
In an interview he gave on Dec. 5 to
theinsiders.com, a recruiting Web site,

Bradford mentioned that USC, Notre
Dame and LSU were his favorites out
of his suitors.
But by the spring, Stanford had en
tered the discussion prominently, and
seemed to be neck-and-neck with
LSU. At the last minute, the Tigers
pulled their offer to Bradford because
they filled their scholarship commit
ment ceiling.
USC re-entered Bradford's main
focus after an unofficial visit sold him
on his prominence as a wide receiver in
their offense.
In the end, it came down to the two
Pac 10 Conference rivals vying for
Bradford's services and he chose
the Cardinal.
Though coach Buddy Teevens said
that "the high profile guys usually go
through a process like that with a last
minute decision," Bradford's
eleventh-hour resolution was pretty
atypical.
The recruit inked on with the Car
dinal at the last possible moment —on
signing day, Feb. 5. And his justifica
tion was the one all the players seem to
use.
"The recruiting process was crazy,"
he said. "But Stanford edged out
everyone with the academics."
As much impact as a Stanford de
gree had on Bradford's thinking, his of
