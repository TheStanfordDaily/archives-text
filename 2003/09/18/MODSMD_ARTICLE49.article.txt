# Senior Powell on the rise, on his way out

last year.
Teevens finally got to see the real
deal in person, though.
"Luke is a talented guy," Teevens
admitted. "It's exciting for a quarter
back to be able to locate a guy like that.
He makes some big catches and can do
some things after the catch."
While at Tulane and Florida,
Teevens has seen a lot of talented re
ceivers pass through the collegiate
ranks - Reche Caldwell who now
plays for the San Diego Chargers and
Jabar Gaffney, and JaJuan Dawson
who now suit up for the Houston Tex
ans among others who made it in the
NFL.
Does the rejuvenated Powell re
mind him of any of the above?
"He's kind of a collection of a bunch
of those guys," Teevens said. "He's
kind of unique in that he's not a real big

guy but he's got a big heart. He's very,
very quick and he's a smart player and
savvy schematically."
While Powell will be trying to estab
lish himself as a bona fide wide receiver
this year, few doubts remain about his
punt returning abilities.
The All-American year of2ool saw
Powell average 16 yards per kick return
- good for second best in the nation.
This year, a rule change may aid
Powell's return quest.
In the off season, the NCAA rid it
self of the so-called "halo rule," which
penalized the kicking team if a player
came within two yards of the returner
before he caught the ball. Now, punt re
turners must call a fair catch if they
don't want to be involved in the on
coming melee and must be given only
an "unimpeded opportunity" to catch
the ball.
To many punt returners, the rule
change is perceived as a disadvantage.
However, Powell seems to think other
wise.
"[Under the new rule] defenders
have to give you an opportunity to get

the ball and tuck it in," Powell explains.
"All you need is that time and then you
can make a move on whoever is flying
at you.You just juke one way or the
other and then they go fly by you. With
the halo rule, the defenders would just
sit in front of you and it was hard to try
to shake them."
And if Powell shakes enough guys
out of their boots this season, the NFL
may come calling.
After all, there are precedents for small
Stanford wide receivers making it in the
pros.
See: Glyn Milburn and Walters.
It's true that any mildly talented se
nior in college football invariably pon
ders the promises of the professional
ranks, but Powell maintains that he's
still keeping his focus on the field.
"Right now I'm trying not to con
cern myself with that," he said. "I know
that I'm not going to grow any more so
I just can't worry about that too much."
It could be another rough year for
Powell, but if his explosiveness contin
ues, he won't be seeing much single
coverage again.
Everyone knows Luke Powell is
an explosive player.
The senior is the only Stanford
player to have three touchdowns of
75 yards or more, has averaged 18.8
yards per reception (third best in
school history) and was a First-Team
All-American kick returner in 2001.
But Powell, hampered by an
ankle injury, was not the same fire
cracker last season. The 5-foot-8,
175-pound flanker never played at
full strength and was limited to only
25 catches for 268 yards and no
touchdowns.
Whether he wants to admit it or
not, Powell has something to prove
in his last season in a Cardinal uni
form.
"Last year was so frustrating, I
can't describe it," he said. "My style
of play is to use my quickness to get
open, and I was a step slower. I
couldn't do the things I've done be
fore. Our offense wasn't very suc
cessful, and I kept thinking about
how many passes I could have caught
if I was healthy."
But he is finally healthy now.
And in showing glimpses of his
old self Powell did his best Troy Wal
ters impression during Stanford's
season-opening game against San
Jose State two weeks ago.
The Smyrna, Tenn. native caught
12 passes for 172 yards â€”both career
highs and scored two touchdowns
in making a huge statement game for
himself and the rest of the Stanford
receiving corps.
"I just felt like I couldn't be
stopped out there," Powell said.
"The coaches put me in the perfect
situation to make the big catches for
first downs. All I had to do was stick
my arms out and the ball stuck to
me."
According to Powell, the Spar

tans didn't seem too concerned
about his play-making ability coming
into the game.
"I don't think San Jose State was
preparing for me to be healthy be
cause I had a lot of single coverage,"
Powell explained. "I don't think they
respected our receiving group that
much and we were able to make

them pay for it."
Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens talked extensively about
how much he had heard about the
wide receiver before coming to Stan
ford and how all the talk didn't ex
actly match up with the player he saw


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior wide receiver Luke Powell will attempt to return to top form after being
hampered by an injury during his junior season. He is off to a promising start,
after hauling in 12 catches for 172 yards against San Jose State.
