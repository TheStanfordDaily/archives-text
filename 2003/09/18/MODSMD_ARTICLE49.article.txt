# Senior Powell on the rise, on his way out

last year.
Teevens finally got to see the real
deal in person, though.
"Luke is a talented guy," Teevens
admitted. "It's exciting for a quarter
back to be able to locate a guy like that.
He makes some big catches and can do
some things after the catch."
While at Tulane and Florida,
Teevens has seen a lot of talented re
ceivers pass through the collegiate
ranks - Reche Caldwell who now
plays for the San Diego Chargers and
Jabar Gaffney, and JaJuan Dawson
who now suit up for the Houston Tex
ans among others who made it in the
NFL.
Does the rejuvenated Powell re
mind him of any of the above?
"He's kind of a collection of a bunch
of those guys," Teevens said. "He's
kind of unique in that he's not a real big

guy but he's got a big heart. He's very,
very quick and he's a smart player and
savvy schematically."
While Powell will be trying to estab
lish himself as a bona fide wide receiver
this year, few doubts remain about his
punt returning abilities.
The All-American year of2ool saw
Powell average 16 yards per kick return
- good for second best in the nation.
This year, a rule change may aid
Powell's return quest.
In the off season, the NCAA rid it
self of the so-called "halo rule," which
penalized the kicking team if a player
came within two yards of the returner
before he caught the ball. Now, punt re
turners must call a fair catch if they
don't want to be involved in the on
coming melee and must be given only
an "unimpeded opportunity" to catch
the ball.
To many punt returners, the rule
change is perceived as a disadvantage.
However, Powell seems to think other
wise.
"[Under the new rule] defenders
have to give you an opportunity to get

the ball and tuck it in," Powell explains.
"All you need is that time and then you
can make a move on whoever is flying
at you.You just juke one way or the
other and then they go fly by you. With
the halo rule, the defenders would just
sit in front of you and it was hard to try
to shake them."
And if Powell shakes enough guys
out of their boots this season, the NFL
may come calling.
After all, there are precedents for small
Stanford wide receivers making it in the
pros.
See: Glyn Milburn and Walters.
It's true that any mildly talented se
nior in college football invariably pon
ders the promises of the professional
ranks, but Powell maintains that he's
still keeping his focus on the field.
"Right now I'm trying not to con
cern myself with that," he said. "I know
that I'm not going to grow any more so
I just can't worry about that too much."
It could be another rough year for
Powell, but if his explosiveness contin
ues, he won't be seeing much single
coverage again.
