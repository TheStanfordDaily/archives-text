# Tresidder revamps its offerings
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Dining has brought in ven
dors such as Subway and Peet's Coffee,
renovated the Coffee House and contin
ues the work that commenced over the
summer to prepare the new Tresidder
Union dining options. The first vendors
are scheduled to open in October.
Control of the Tresidder dining prop
erties transferred last June from Bon
Appetit to Stanford Dining, with plans
to bring in more national vendor chains
and focus more on student needs.
"People around the University felt
that Stanford was not fully utilizing the
available Tresidder areas," said ASSU

Vice President Joey Natoli. "Stanford
Dining thought that because they are a

vendors over the summer. Those among
consideration included Wendy's, Chick -
Fil-A, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Krispy
Kreme, and In-N-Out Burgers. In-N-
Out was rejected due to demands to own
the property, employ non-unionized
workers and build a drive-thru window.
Natoli also cited concerns about bud
get and time.
"Generally to bring in a vendor you

have to give them months if not over a
year. We were trying to sign the vendors
within a matter of weeks," he said. "In
addition, because of budget cuts the
University gave Stanford Dining a very
strict budget with which they could ren
ovate Tresidder and due to the age of
Tresidder and prior upkeep, there was a
lot of work to do"
The vendors selected thus far include
Subway, which will open in early Octo
ber, and Peet's Coffee, opening in the
middle of October. Other vendors are
also in the works.
"We are currently finalizing the sushi
concept and pizza program, we are also
