# Tresidder revamps its offerings
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Dining has brought in ven
dors such as Subway and Peet's Coffee,
renovated the Coffee House and contin
ues the work that commenced over the
summer to prepare the new Tresidder
Union dining options. The first vendors
are scheduled to open in October.
Control of the Tresidder dining prop
erties transferred last June from Bon
Appetit to Stanford Dining, with plans
to bring in more national vendor chains
and focus more on student needs.
"People around the University felt
that Stanford was not fully utilizing the
available Tresidder areas," said ASSU

Vice President Joey Natoli. "Stanford
Dining thought that because they are a
non-profit and part of the Stanford com
munity, they could do a much better job
managing the area."
Stanford Dining worked with the
Tresidder Dining Advisory Group
[TDAG], which met weekly, to select
vendors over the summer. Those among
consideration included Wendy's, Chick -
Fil-A, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Krispy
Kreme, and In-N-Out Burgers. In-N-
Out was rejected due to demands to own
the property, employ non-unionized
workers and build a drive-thru window.
Natoli also cited concerns about bud
get and time.
"Generally to bring in a vendor you

have to give them months if not over a
year. We were trying to sign the vendors
within a matter of weeks," he said. "In
addition, because of budget cuts the
University gave Stanford Dining a very
strict budget with which they could ren
ovate Tresidder and due to the age of
Tresidder and prior upkeep, there was a
lot of work to do"
The vendors selected thus far include
Subway, which will open in early Octo
ber, and Peet's Coffee, opening in the
middle of October. Other vendors are
also in the works.
"We are currently finalizing the sushi
concept and pizza program, we are also
in the process of putting a tandoor
for Indian food," said Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stan
ford Dining.
Students with points for meal plans
will be able to apply 50 per quarter to
any of the retail locations.
In addition to the advising
group, Stanford Dining also enlist
ed the help of a number of other
areas. Siddiqui cited Gene Awaku
ni's office, Shirley Everett from res
idential and dining enterprises,
Vice Provost Tim Warner, Execu
tive Director Student Housing
Rodger Whitney, Stanford Man
agement Company and Facilities
Operation Group as instrumental
in the project.
"I am truly proud of students,
my staff and many departments on
campus ... who have been crucial in
developing and executing the new
plans," Siddiqui said.
In addition to the work on the main
area of Tresidder Union, Dining
has worked on the Coffee House,
replacing Starbucks products with
their Peet's Coffee equivalents,
adding new furniture, and changing
the menu. However, work on the
Coffee House will continue
throughout the year, and Dining is
open to suggestions.
"We will be working closely with
students to develop programming
for CoHo," Siddiqui said. "We
would like to see more students' art
work on the walls and more Stan
ford history in the facility."
Jeff Catalano, a fifth-year doc

toral candidate in Geological and
Environmental Sciences and mem
ber of TDAG said that the Coffee
House will change significantly.
"Right now the CoHo is one of
only a few food options at Tresid
der, and has to be run with this in
mind," he said. "Once everything
else reopens, I think the focus of
CoHo will be more towards a cool
spot to hang out, as opposed to
feeding people lunch."
All of the previous Bon Appetit
workers will be rehired under the
new Stanford Dining ownership.
With both the Coffee House and
Tresidder, TDAG tried to account
for the needs of the whole Stanford
community.
"One difficulty we all grappled
with was how to bring in a diverse
mix of vendors that could cater to
undergraduates, graduates and
staff members," Natoli said.
Among graduate students needs
also vary.
"Some grad students want quick
food, and are pleased with the addi
tion of Subway," Catalano said.
"Other want more than just
subs, and I think the proposed food
concepts in the cave area should
meet most everyone's needs."
Dining plans to be flexible with
the vendors, changing them to meet
students' needs.
Overall, Catalano was positive
about Tresidder's prospects.
"Considering all the permitting
processes Stanford has to go
through with Santa Clara County, it
is amazing work has progressed so
far so quickly," he said. "I expect
the final product will be a signifi
cant improvement over the old
Tresidder."

for CoHo," Siddiqui said. "We
would like to see more students' art
work on the walls and more Stan
ford history in the facility."
Jeff Catalano, a fifth-year doc

toral candidate in Geological and
Environmental Sciences and mem
ber of TDAG said that the Coffee
House will change significantly.
"Right now the CoHo is one of
only a few food options at Tresid
der, and has to be run with this in
mind," he said. "Once everything
else reopens, I think the focus of
CoHo will be more towards a cool
spot to hang out, as opposed to
feeding people lunch."
All of the previous Bon Appetit
workers will be rehired under the
new Stanford Dining ownership.
With both the Coffee House and
Tresidder, TDAG tried to account
for the needs of the whole Stanford
community.
"One difficulty we all grappled
with was how to bring in a diverse
mix of vendors that could cater to
undergraduates, graduates and
staff members," Natoli said.
Among graduate students needs
also vary.
"Some grad students want quick
food, and are pleased with the addi
tion of Subway," Catalano said.
"Other want more than just
subs, and I think the proposed food
concepts in the cave area should
meet most everyone's needs."
Dining plans to be flexible with
the vendors, changing them to meet
students' needs.
Overall, Catalano was positive
about Tresidder's prospects.
"Considering all the permitting
processes Stanford has to go
through with Santa Clara County, it
is amazing work has progressed so
far so quickly," he said. "I expect
the final product will be a signifi
cant improvement over the old
Tresidder."
