# CAMPUS LIFE
## Tales from the crypt Semi-nude mud wrestling, a busty sphinx & other Stanford lore 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
Next time some misty-eyed alum starts waxing poetic to you about "da best years
of my life" on the Farm, don't think hula skirts, mandatory curfews and lantern
jawed jocks. Here's our Stanford History Cliffs Notes, complete with freak acci
dents, freakier students and maybe even a little mayhem:
Wining and moonshining
Last spring, Stanford crafted an alcohol policy that was widely booed for what many
students saw as its strictness —namely, no drinking in freshman common areas. But back
back before Prohibition, Stanford faculty were a bit more relaxed, loosened up, comfort
able. You get the draft, uh, drift, about things.
• In the early 19205, the faculty had its own yell at Stanford football games:
"Cigars, cigars,
Cigarettes, beer
Faculty, faculty,
We're right here!"
My, how times have changed. This tidbit might come in handy next time you're head
ed home one Saturday night and a friendly campus cops starts writing up a BUI slip for
biking under the influence. ("But officer, those old-time professors said ") Then again,
you'll probably be too drunk to remember.
Tubthumping

Back in the good old days, upperclassmen had a tradition of "tubbing" freshmen. It
was a bad scene. As this is a family newspaper, it will be left to the readers' imaginations.
At least no females were involved, since the campus was not yet co-ed.
According to reports, sometimes those rowdy kids overdid it. It's rather in
delicate to elaborate on what that means, since dead men tell no tales.
But the tradition was thwarted when Encina Hall was renovated;
the tubs were ripped out and replaced with showers. So frosh, don't
pout about not getting to take a bubble bath. Giving up frolicking in
the foam is a small price to pay for bruiseless buttocks.

The thicker-chicker-picker-upper
... on most campuses would be beer, but those wholesome Stan
ford students of bygone days grabbed an excuse to grope in frosh
soph mudfights known as the "Stanford Rough." Photo evidence
shows wranglers in their skivvies. The fights ceased in the 19305, a
disappointment to freshmen with anger management issues. Some
had complained that the influx of female participants was toning
down the roughhousing.
Gone to seed

Before 1920 when co-eds were living in Old Roble, the girls
decided to plant a fruit orchard across the street between. One
Timothy Hopkins said that the idea was that "a fair maiden
would pluck a ripe peach for her devoted swain." Oh puh
leeze. Anyway, the girls planted the orchard, but the trees
died from neglect before they reached maturity. Guess
once you're getting busy, horticulture gets less interesting.
(Unless, maybe, if you're Susan Orlean.)

Busted!

Hooters than hauteur with their ample bosoms. But the chesty half-woman, half-lion crea
tures did not amuse Jane Stanford after all, she didn't pawn her pearls for these girls.
"Jane didn't fancy the extreme femininity of the sphinxes originally placed in front,"
said University Archivist Maggie Kimball. "So it is understood that around 1900 she had
them switched with the masculine ones."
In line with Mrs. Stanford's sense of propriety, the male sphinxes guarding the tomb
today would not be appraised by Cosmo sex columnists as well-hung.
It ain't heavy, it's my load of books
Also hitting the stacks, so to speak, was Geology Prof. John Caspar Branner. In 1892,
Branner came to Stanford toting so many tomes that he resorted to using a freight train
car to transport his gigantic library. Yet for some reason, Branner-dwellers of recent years
haven't been similarly renowned as hard-core bookworms. Surely this year's brand-new
digs will inspire bouts of studying.
Jolly Green Giant
Enchanted Broccoli Forest got its name from Mollie Katzen's eponymous cookbook.
And Narnia was almost named "Beyond the Forest of Enchantment," but Stanford ad
ministrators had clamped down by then. The suggestion was vetoed and the house now
bears the tamer moniker of C.S. Lewis's magical land.
Shake it fast, watch yaself
Your quake-paranoid roommate, an East Coast transplant who cons you into taking
the top bunk, might be onto something. Back in the day, when Encina Hall was Dorm
Central, student Julius Hanna was killed by a collapsing chimney. A University staff
member also got the blunt end of the bricks during the "Big One," the 1906 San Francis
co earthquake.

I want you to hit me as hard as you can
Red-blooded Stanford males used to have their own fight
club. And the first rule was... to duke it out with hats. Yeah. See,
freshman sported beanies, sophomores wore porkpies and se
niors donned Stetsons. During prearranged "Plug Ugly" brawls,
students would lob the so-called "plug hats" (stiffened by dip
ping in white lead) at each other. One photo shows a group of
Ik strapping guys fresh from battle, proudly brandishing limbs
■ in casts, bandaged heads, taped jaws and arms in slings. In
"-M evitably, administrators cracked down and the fights were
■ banned.

Damn. That wasn't in the fight club rulebook.
