# CAMPUS LIFE
## Tales from the crypt Semi-nude mud wrestling, a busty sphinx & other Stanford lore 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
Next time some misty-eyed alum starts waxing poetic to you about "da best years
of my life" on the Farm, don't think hula skirts, mandatory curfews and lantern
jawed jocks. Here's our Stanford History Cliffs Notes, complete with freak acci
dents, freakier students and maybe even a little mayhem:
Wining and moonshining
Last spring, Stanford crafted an alcohol policy that was widely booed for what many
students saw as its strictness —namely, no drinking in freshman common areas. But back
back before Prohibition, Stanford faculty were a bit more relaxed, loosened up, comfort
able. You get the draft, uh, drift, about things.
• In the early 19205, the faculty had its own yell at Stanford football games:
"Cigars, cigars,
Cigarettes, beer
Faculty, faculty,
We're right here!"
My, how times have changed. This tidbit might come in handy next time you're head
ed home one Saturday night and a friendly campus cops starts writing up a BUI slip for
biking under the influence. ("But officer, those old-time professors said ") Then again,
you'll probably be too drunk to remember.
Tubthumping

Back in the good old days, upperclassmen had a tradition of "tubbing" freshmen. It
was a bad scene. As this is a family newspaper, it will be left to the readers' imaginations.
At least no females were involved, since the campus was not yet co-ed.
According to reports, sometimes those rowdy kids overdid it. It's rather in
delicate to elaborate on what that means, since dead men tell no tales.
But the tradition was thwarted when Encina Hall was renovated;
the tubs were ripped out and replaced with showers. So frosh, don't
pout about not getting to take a bubble bath. Giving up frolicking in
the foam is a small price to pay for bruiseless buttocks.

The thicker-chicker-picker-upper
... on most campuses would be beer, but those wholesome Stan
ford students of bygone days grabbed an excuse to grope in frosh
soph mudfights known as the "Stanford Rough." Photo evidence
shows wranglers in their skivvies. The fights ceased in the 19305, a
disappointment to freshmen with anger management issues. Some
had complained that the influx of female participants was toning
down the roughhousing.
Gone to seed

Before 1920 when co-eds were living in Old Roble, the girls
decided to plant a fruit orchard across the street between. One
Timothy Hopkins said that the idea was that "a fair maiden
would pluck a ripe peach for her devoted swain." Oh puh
leeze. Anyway, the girls planted the orchard, but the trees
died from neglect before they reached maturity. Guess
once you're getting busy, horticulture gets less interesting.
(Unless, maybe, if you're Susan Orlean.)

Busted!
The original sphinxes
guarding the Mau
soleum exuded a
vibe mm
more

Hooters than hauteur with their ample bosoms. But the chesty half-woman, half-lion crea
tures did not amuse Jane Stanford after all, she didn't pawn her pearls for these girls.
"Jane didn't fancy the extreme femininity of the sphinxes originally placed in front,"
said University Archivist Maggie Kimball. "So it is understood that around 1900 she had
them switched with the masculine ones."
In line with Mrs. Stanford's sense of propriety, the male sphinxes guarding the tomb
today would not be appraised by Cosmo sex columnists as well-hung.
It ain't heavy, it's my load of books
Also hitting the stacks, so to speak, was Geology Prof. John Caspar Branner. In 1892,
Branner came to Stanford toting so many tomes that he resorted to using a freight train
car to transport his gigantic library. Yet for some reason, Branner-dwellers of recent years
haven't been similarly renowned as hard-core bookworms. Surely this year's brand-new
digs will inspire bouts of studying.
Jolly Green Giant
Enchanted Broccoli Forest got its name from Mollie Katzen's eponymous cookbook.
And Narnia was almost named "Beyond the Forest of Enchantment," but Stanford ad
ministrators had clamped down by then. The suggestion was vetoed and the house now
bears the tamer moniker of C.S. Lewis's magical land.
Shake it fast, watch yaself
Your quake-paranoid roommate, an East Coast transplant who cons you into taking
the top bunk, might be onto something. Back in the day, when Encina Hall was Dorm
Central, student Julius Hanna was killed by a collapsing chimney. A University staff
member also got the blunt end of the bricks during the "Big One," the 1906 San Francis
co earthquake.

I want you to hit me as hard as you can
Red-blooded Stanford males used to have their own fight
club. And the first rule was... to duke it out with hats. Yeah. See,
freshman sported beanies, sophomores wore porkpies and se
niors donned Stetsons. During prearranged "Plug Ugly" brawls,
students would lob the so-called "plug hats" (stiffened by dip
ping in white lead) at each other. One photo shows a group of
Ik strapping guys fresh from battle, proudly brandishing limbs
■ in casts, bandaged heads, taped jaws and arms in slings. In
"-M evitably, administrators cracked down and the fights were
■ banned.

Damn. That wasn't in the fight club rulebook.
Professors and schoolgirls
Vladimir Nabokov, the author of that infamous pe

which entombs the Stanford family.

dophile love story "Lolita," started work as a cre
ative writing teacher here in the summer of 1941.
One can't help but wonder if there were any freck
led nymphette types in his class.
Also contributing to sexual scholarship was
Henry James's older bother, the eminent psy
chologist William James. He was an acting pro
fessor of psychology here in 1906. Luckily for all
those who like to describe annoying people as
"anal-retentive," James was among the first
American boosters of Freud's theories, then
widely reviled by most Stateside folk as perverse.
He was also a major influence in the field of edu
cational psychology.
French twist
The Office of Residential Education founded
La Maison Frangaise in 1975, but by 1979 decided
to give another language a go in the house. In a des
perate ploy to keep the prime Row real estate,
French and Italian Chair Ralph Hester called on
his French connections. Sure enough, Dr. Alain
Pompidou, son of then-French President Georges
Pompidou was dispatched to campus.
Upon arrival, he got down ("Saturday Night
Fever"-style) with La Maison's chef Babette on the
front lawn of the Maison. This photo op made the
front page of The Daily. When Dean of Students
» James Lyons saw the pic, he relected and overruled
the decision to suspend the Maison. Good call.
Vive le Eurotrash!
Shacking Up
As the Age of Aquarius drew to a close, English
major Sigourney Weaver built a treehouse with her
own bare hands. Then, for an entire term, she lived
there with some lucky chap described as her "male

friend" (can I get a mm-hmm, girls?). Her way with
power tools and her acting in Japanese Noh plays,
as well as her habit of showing up in class in elfin
garb, surely gave Weaver preparation for her gutsy
lead performances in the blockbuster "Alien," not
to mention the 1997 movie "Snow White: A Tale of
Terror."
It's not easy being SLE
"Alexander Payne, Oscar nominated director
of "About Schmidt," "Election" and "Citizen
Ruth" is a SLE grad," points out Meredith Rowe,
a former Cardenal RA. Take that, anyone who
would razz the home of the 24-hour final. The same
SLEster you're taunting now just might be dan
gling multimillion-dollar contracts and groupies a
few years down the line. Heck, you might end up
his groupie or her gigolo. Treat them well.
Hash me
Yeah, it's tough work to emulate Stanford's il
lustrious deviants, but someone's gotta do it. Sean
Savage finds relief from his work as a mild-man
nered Stanford computer analyst when managing
his Web site, the disturbing-mental-picture-induc
ing www.cheesebikini.com.
His site organizes "flash mobs," sudden gather
ings of people in randomly chosen locations, in
which they clap and then disperse seconds later. Al
though Harvard's Coop got flashmobbed on July
31, so far Stanford Bookstore hasn't had to try out
how many bloggers can fit in the upstairs cafe.
Carpal tunnel of love
Thanks to the oh-so-blissful wonders of modern
technology, Stanford deviants can now make their
mark on history far beyond our fair campus, even if
it does only last for their 15 seconds of fame. Stan
ford grads can post epic personals on rightstuffdat
ing.com only Stanford folk and grads of other
top-shelf colleges need apply.
