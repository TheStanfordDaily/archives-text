Back in April, when members of the Stanford
Class of 2007 received acceptance letters, plans
for New Student Orientation 2003 were already
in full swing.
Juniors Lauren Friedman and Will O'Neill, se
niors Sasha Cox and Huy Son and graduate Jenny
Roof have been at the Office of Freshmen and
Transfer Students as orientation coordinators
since last spring to implement the 200-plus events
that constitute new students' introduction to life at
Stanford.
And this weekend, with the freshmen on cam
pus, their work will be on center stage.
Parent Programming
In addition to the standard parent programming
offered on the first day of orientation which
ranges from the Parent Resource Center in Tresid
der to a dinner with Provost John Etchemendy
Thursday will feature two sessions entitled "Let

ting Go: Parent-to-Parent Advice." The event high
lights resources available to parents with advice
from parents of current students and graduates
about sending children off to college.
"We used to have the Parent Dessert, which
was a chance for parents to talk about saying good
bye to their children," says Jared Scherer, director
of NSO. "This year we revamped that program in a
new way with Letting Go in a close partnership
with the Parents' Club.
"It's important for parents to feel that it's okay
to be sad about saying goodbye and for them to
talk about it in the company of other parents is a
source of comfort."
School Spirit
As part of a greater University effort to increase
class identity and school spirit, orientation will
showcase Cardinal athletics through "Cardinal
Fan 101" on Saturday night when the football team
will have just finished its game on the road against
Brigham Young University.
"The purpose of the event is twofold," says Julie

Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen and transfer
students. "First, it is an effort to get new students
into the stadium and excited bout football and
Stanford athletics early on in their Stanford experi
ence.
"Second, we want to introduce new students to
the key players in the world of Stanford spirit
the Band, the Dollies, Yell Leaders, Axe Commit
tee and the new Cardinal Competitive Cheer
group so they are ready for that first game."
Instead of eating dinner in the dorms that night,
new students will enjoy a barbecue on the field in
the football stadium courtesy of Stanford Dining,
while the various spirit groups provide entertain
ment. The event will be emceed by O'Neill, who
throws discuss on the track and field team.
The Office of the Dean of Freshmen and Trans
fer Students has also partnered with the Alumni
Association to sell banners reading "Stanford
Class of 2007" as well as appropriate class years
for incoming transfer students online before
new students arrive for orientation.
