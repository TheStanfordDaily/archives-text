# Crummy? Yummy? A food guide for dummies
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
Even the pickiest palates can find a hidden
treasure or two among the campus's dining
options. But beware: TTiese few finds are hid
den among the campus's dining disasters
some of which may leave new students yearn
ing for their mother's grilled cheese and toma
to soup.
Dining Halls
Get out your Birkenstocks and sunglasses:
Stanford's dining halls are as Californian as
surfboards and bleach-blonde hair. Om
nipresent Mexican food, Asian food and a
salad bar are accompanied by good old Amer
ican fast food dishes.
Everyone must endure this aspect of Cali
fornia cuisine some even like it. The key is to
make sure to find a few staples like cereal or
plain white rice that can always be used as a
back-up when the pickings are slim.
It's also important to note the distinction
between eateries that operate exclusively on
points and those that accept an all-you-can
eat meal count per week.Wilbur and Man
zanita Dining work on an a la carte point sys
tem that does result in higher quality fare.
Diners can also spend their points like candy
on sweet treats, chips and highly coveted sushi
at least it's edible if you really need a fix.
Tresidder
Anyone who wants to catch a glimpse of
University employees, graduate students or
tourists can frequent any one of Tresidder's
cafes.
This summer, the CoHo got a face lift and
revamped its menu with mixed results. Ini
tially, the new java house looks promising
with its redesigned sign and Pottery Barn
decor, replete with rattan baskets and beaded
lampshades. Upon closer inspection, howev
er, the glossy catalogue look may make some
yearn for the old, broken-in furniture of the
CoHo.
Meanwhile, the new menu leaves much to
be desired. The sandwich bar that used to
offer tasty customized treats has been
dropped for pre-made panini that hardly meet
the previous standards the CoHo had set. The
new salads are as lifeless and dull as Keanu
Reeve's acting, and the foccaccia bread
"Pizzettas" looked dry and unappetizing.
One of the other big changes in the CoHo
is the switch from Starbucks to Peet's Coffee
and Tea. Though some people despise the
Seattle mega-chain's pervasive influence in
the cutthroat caffeine supply market, students

who long for their Chai tea drinks will soon
discover that Peet's has no such blend, so the
CoHo doesn't either.
Typically, the big screen TV and comfy
couches would draw crowds at night for live
performances and revelry, but it has not yet
obtained its liquor license, which will surely
deter some students from patronizing the
CoHo.
But the Treehouse, which is located next
door, remains a staple for people who prefer
burgers, Mexican food and very tasty teriyaki
bowls to salads and sandwiches. It also serves
alcohol.
With TVs, lots of indoor tables and late
night accessibility, this restaurant is a conve
nient choice at the center of campus. Just
don't stumble in there after a workout at
Tresidder fitness or all that work will have
been for naught. Unfortunately, the Tree
house is definitely not a good diet destination.
Jamba Juice, on the other hand, is a juice
bar chain that serves up fruit smoothies ah day
long. Lines are usually long, but there are no
surprises here. It's a consistent option. Wheat
grass shots are for those people who cannot
get enough of that fresh cut grass smell and
feel the need to ingest liquid chlorophyll
it's not pleasant, but it is good for you.
The cafe in the Stanford Bookstore may
not be in Tresidder exactly, but for the avid
tourist watcher, it could be a mecca. This
eatery looks like a combination bakery-gas
station. Adjacent to the pastries and breads
are freezers that house Haagen-Daz ice cream
bars and shelves stacked with candy and dried
fruits and nuts. Sure the chocolate may be Go
diva, so it would have to be a nice Palo Alto
gas station, but it still feels a bit strange to stop
there for a bite.
Lunchtime Hotspots
Often, students find themselves with class
schedules packed tighter than Cher's face so
there is barely enough time to get from one
lecture to another, let alone travel back to the
dining hall for lunch. Never fear, some of
Stanford's best eateries are nestled in the aca
demic center of campus.
The Thai Cafe is by far one of the most ef
ficient, inexpensive and delicious places to get
lunch. In the basement of the Psychology
Building, a consistently long line quickly
forms for the curt "Soup Nazi-esque" treat
ment that the proprietors serve along with
Thai soups and rice dishes.
But don't get too caught up in picking out a
drink from the refrigerator, because this line
moves fast. And be sure to check out the menu
and pick out an entree before even getting in
line, with cash in hand by the time the register

appears. Otherwise, prepare for a scowl from
the woman working the cashbox.
A newer addition to the Quad's gourmet
repertoire is the much-hyped cafe in the base
ment of Wallenberg Hall: Olives. This quaint,
Mediterranean-themed eatery serves up both
warm and cold dishes that reflect the flavors of
its chosen region. The olive pizza is rather
salty, but the sandwiches and baklahva are
quite tasty and the line is short for customers
on the run.

Techies have their own cafe as well. Bytes,
located in the Packard Building, has above av
erage food served on actual China that is
brought to its patrons' tables. The soup
changes daily at this hangout; pair it with a
salad for a great express lunch on-the-go.

If you are really in a hurry, there is one cam
pus dining that moves as fast as you do. A van
whose horn plays La Cucaracha roams cam
pus at lunchtime, beckoning diners to sample
its fare. Listen for its enchanting melody when
it parks itself in its regular spot, between Enci
na Hall and the Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building.
Members Only
The students in the Graduate School of
Business have one of the nicest cafeterias on
campus it's worth the trek to check out the
myriad of options in entrees and snacks.
The Alumni Cafe and Arrillaga Sports
Cafe also serve food of better quality than the

typical dining hall's offerings, not surprising
because they cater to alumni and athletes, re
spectively. On the other hand, the Law
School's cafe is nothing to write home about,
serving more pedestrian fare like sandwiches
and Snapple.
The Faculty Club is the most revered of
Stanford's eateries, more likely due to its ex
clusivity than the actual food. Though the
decor is soothing and the service is profes
sional, the food is standard restaurant quality,
no more, no less.
Regardless, do not give up a chance to at
tend a lunch at the Faculty Club, whether it be
with a generous alumnus or a professor, just so
you can say you've been there. Above all, it is
the place to see and be seen.

Focaccia pizzas are one of the new offerings at the recently-remodeled Coffee House. Late-night concerts and a giant television for watching
Cardinal athletics have made the CoHo an ever-popular Stanford hangout.
