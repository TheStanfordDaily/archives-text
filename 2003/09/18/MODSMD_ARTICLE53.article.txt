# Countdown to Orientation
## Students, faculty and staff prepare for the arrival of the class 0f 2007 
### MARK DOMINIK VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITORS 
There's a lot you can do in 3,500
hours: watch 1,750 movies or 7,000
episodes of "Friends," drive back
and forth between Seattle and Stan
ford University 159 times, listen to
Ultimate Dance Party 2000 once a
day for eight years, or rack up a real
ly gigantic cell phone bill.
Or, if none of the above sound in
teresting, you could always prepare for
this year's New Student Orientation.
Before the freshman class arrived
today, hundreds of volunteers spent
thousands of hours to roll out the
welcome. The Daily presents a snap
shot at the hectic, pre-Orientation
lives of three people on Stanford's
wagon, as well as a freshman who
will experience the fruits of their
labor.
The Resident Assistant
Junior Katie Kollitz is what peo
ple like to call an "analytical driver."
That is one of several discoveries
made by Kollitz, a resident assistant
in Florence Moore Hall's Faisan,
when she returned to campus in
early September. Other lessons:
Freshmen aren't supposed to drink,
eating disorders are unhealthy and
Screw-Your-Roommate could have
deeper implications than you'd ex
pect.
Kollitz learned these bits of infor
mation at this year's RA training,
which started in three weeks ago and
aims to introduce RAs to each other
and some of the issues that might
surface in the school year.
To be an analytical driver, says
Kollitz, is to want to get things done,
without all the touchy-feely senti
ment that often complicates rela
tionships.
"When I work in groups, I like to
get straight to the point, and I like to
do stuff," she explains. "I don't sit
around talking about feelings unless
that's the established goal."
Yet Kollitz has been doing exact
ly that for the past three weeks, at
RA orientation sessions. She has
met plenty of other "drivers," as they
call themselves but she has also
crossed paths with "amiables"

(those who strive to make people
feel happy) and "expressives" (those
who, unlike Kollitz, thrive on talking
about feelings).
"It's nothing that people didn't
know about themselves before," she
admits. "I'm a driver, so I'm proba
bly going to scare away all the ami
ables. Still, it's really good to have a
mix because your kids and other res
idents are going to have different
styles, too."
Kollitz says she has discovered
being an RA is more complex than
she had expected.
"I sort of went in thinking, 'lt's all
intuition, you just have to use good
judgment in a variety of situations,"'
she says. "That's still true but
now, looking back on my freshman
year, I realize that my RAs were
doing things that I didn't even no
tice."
Like planning a ski trip, for exam
ple, says Kollitz, or a Screw-Your-
Roommate dance.
"If you have a date-focused event
like Screw-Your-Roommate the un
derlying assumption is that everyone
is heterosexual," she says. "We need
to look for ways to make the event
more inclusive. A big underlying
theme throughout training has been
to try to be mindful of differences
that we may not even know about."
Kollitz has spent the past several
weeks learning how to deal with
such situations. Often, she says, it
has been intense.
"We had talks about body image,
mental health, alcohol and sexual
harassment all on the same day,"
she says.
Such talks, she says, made her real
ize the main challenge of being an
RA: The fact that no crisis is planned.
But for now, Kollitz's tasks are far
simpler. She is one of very few peo
ple who have moved into Faisan so
far, and she just finished tacking her
posters to the wall, including one of
Bob Marley and another advertising
the movie "Kiss of the Dragon."
After some inconveniences, she's
managed to set up her Internet con
nection. Why so soon? "I'd rather be
helping the freshmen move in than
be doing the same thing as them,"
she says.
Another immediate task: to agree
with her fellow staff members on a

dorm theme. "FaiSan Quentin,"
someone suggested, after the infa
mous jail. "Faisanrio" was one of
Kollitz's favorites, a nod to the
Japanese kitsch chain Sanrio. And
one of her colleagues nominated
"Faisanitorium." "That way," Kol
litz quips, "we wouldn't have to dec
orate at all!"
In the end, FaiSonicTheHedge
hog a nod to the popular Sega
game won out.
Despite the cutesiness, the train
ing schedule is quite rigorous. On
one day, RAs were asked to wake up
between 7:30 and 8:15 a.m. if they
wanted to eat breakfast in Stern Din

ing. Then, from 10 to 11:45 a.m., they
took quizzes assessing their social
styles those quizzes that granted
Kollitz her status as an analytical dri
ver.
On that same day, staff members
including Kollitz met mem
bers of office support staffs, learned
about intellectual life in residences
and discussed body image, eating
disorders and alcohol use.
The latter, says Kollitz, is an im
portant issue. But as she sees it,
"being an RA isn't being someone's
mother; it's being an educator."
That means that she'll make resi
dents aware of Stanford's alcohol pol

icy no alcohol if you're under 21
but like most of her fellow RAs, she
doesn't plan on pacing through the
halls policing her residents.
"If someone's drunk and throw
ing up, I definitely need to take ac
tion to ensure their safety I can't
sit around and do nothing," she ex
plains. "But my job is mostly to ex
plain to them what the policy is and
what the law is, so they can make ed
ucated decisions."
The Vice Provost
A note to all students who feel ac
complished after rolling out of bed
for a 9 a.m. lecture: You've got noth
ing on John Bravman.
In fact, Bravman's got four hours
on you. His day begins at 4:30 a.m.
every morning, when he wakes up to
check his e-mail. Before his pre
dawn alarm clock buzzer rings to
morrow morning, he will have
logged close to 20 hours of work
today, plus or minus a couple of
meals and four hours of sleep.
At 8 a.m. on Monday, he takes a
brief break from his grueling sched
ule. He stands at his kitchen sink,
glancing out his window at Fresh
man / Sophomore College, where he
acts as dean.
Bravman, vice provost for under
graduate education, had a good rea
son to take a couple of moments to
do such a simple thing: That was one
of very few quiet moments in his day,
before he prepares for the first of
nine back-to-back meetings with fac
ulty members and other staff.
If this a typical day, there's about
a 50 percent chance that he'll also
have some kind of evening event to
attend returning home, of course,
in time to park himself in front of his
computer and check the 300 e-mails
he received during the day. (Wait,
you said 30 e-mails, right?" asks our
hapless reporter in a Monday phone
interview. "Nope; I said 300.")
Such are the travails of Stanford's
vice provost for undergraduate edu
cation during the week before New
Student Orientation (and in fact, he
claims, during the rest of the school
year, too). Bravman does not offi
cially have a top organizational role
in pulling off Orientation, but he is
well known at Stanford for his in

volvement with undergraduate stu
dents, particularly freshmen and
prospective students.
Although he has been vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion for just five years, he has been
involved in some way with Orienta
tion for the past 15 years or so. Plus,
he spends much of his spare time or
ganizing extra projects and events at
FroSoCo; last weekend, in fact, he
was at that dorm's staff retreat.
"You wouldn't be appointed to
such a position if you didn't gravitate
toward it first," he says.
This week, on top of preparing for
individual appearances in front of
students and parents, Bravman must
work with his staff in the Undergrad
uate Advising Center, Program in
Writing and Rhetoric and Introduc
tion to the Humanities, "to help
them make critical decisions as time
goes by."
Any major crises yet? No, claims
Bravman, just minor ones, like book
lets not getting delivered to certain
programs, for example.
"It runs really well year after
year, given the magnitude of the ef
fort," he says.
The Orientation Coordinator
As the clock ticks down to New
Student Orientation, junior Lauren
Friedman's life gets busier and busier.
"I'm personally responsible for
every single table and chair, table
skirt and table cloth you will see at
Orientation," says Friedman, this
year's head orientation coordinator.
"I'm also responsible for the ice at
every event. We need to make sure
we have enough water out and acces
sible. At this point we've been work
ing so hard this summer to make sure
little details are okay."
Friedman directs a staff of four
coordinators and 160 volunteers
who help her ensure the six-day
event is properly planned and exe
cuted. In conjunction with the full
time staff of the Orientation office,
more than 3,500 man hours near
ly two full work-years have been
invested in the planning of this
year's Orientation.
"I think a lot of people don't real
