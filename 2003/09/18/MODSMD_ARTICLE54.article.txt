# Sex and Stanford: Campus dating 101
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You would think that Stanford, an elite school famous for its
mellow, happy setting and undergraduate diversity, would have
some kind of dating scene, wouldn't you? Well, you'd be wrong.
Dating, as you know, it is dead at Stanford. For immobile
freshmen, it's the worst. Dinner and a movie? It's more like
sharing your points at Wilbur Dining and ducking paper mis
siles at Flicks. For the uninitiated, deciphering Stanford's dating
code can take months even some upperclassmen still don't
get it. Here's a guide to understanding the basic terminology:
Non-Dating
It may be wishful thinking to call a half-hour conversation at
Moonßeans a date, but you did pay for her chai latte Non
dates are would-be dates in pedestrian settings: the CoHo, SLE
lounge and Flicks all apply. But to qualify for non-date status,
the meeting must have been scheduled beforehand, otherwise
it's just an extended run-in.
Dating Long-Distance / Life on a Chain
Lots of freshmen move into their dorm rooms and immedi
ately perch a picture of their hometown honey on their night
stand. But slowly, the phone calls taper off, e-mails go unan
swered. Boyfriends and girlfriends stray, and that heart-shaped
frame gets chucked out the window.
It's much better to come to Stanford with a clean slate. Oth
erwise, you'll inevitably suffer guilt and temptation until winter
break, a popular time for splits. On the upside, if you've been
eyeing someone with "a boyfriend at home," don't despair,
she'll be single soon enough.
Recurring Hook-Ups
Not to be confused with its feistier little sister, Random, the
Recurring Hook-Up requires a three hook-up minimum within a
set time span four to six weeks is standard. Eschewing
courtship rituals like dinner and mini-golf, recurring hook-ups
fast-forward past the formality and gets straight to the good stuff.
By Invitation Only
Screw Your Roommate dances, class formals, fraternity

date dashes, sorority special dinners: All outings that re
quire arm candy, often at the last minute, encompass this
brand of dating under pressure. If you are invited to an
event, expect a free meal and a bottomless cup of Franzia or
Charles Shaw.
Romantic Multitasking
Flirt while you spot each other at the gym; get your problem
set done and cuddle at the same time; or have a romantic ad
venture at IKEA. A model of efficiency, activity dating is the
Eames chair of romance fun and functional!
Dating in a Crowd
Couples who date in a crowd aren't fooling anyone with their ca
sually platonic demeanor. They use groups of friends as airbags, but
they manage to share moments of intimacy nonetheless.
A Marriage of Convenience
Commonly referred to as dormcest, this type of relationship is
great for the lazy. Why take her out to dinner when you'll be shar
ing a table at the dining hall anyway?
While they may seem blissfully convenient at first, in-dorm
relationships tend to fizzle out quickly. Nothing kills romance
faster than living together there's a reason why half of all
marriages end in divorce, you know.
But even if you manage to beat the odds, there are
major pitfalls. Be prepared for the entire dorm to know all
about your private life and to offer you unsolicited rela
tionship advice while you're selecting dressing at the salad
bar.
Whatever you do, do NOT become the much reviled Dorm
Couple, the nauseatingly affectionate, nonstop hand-holders
who make out during house meeting.
Helpful as they are, I know that these guidelines are stMl
woefully limited in their scope. Stanford's bizarre mating
dance is too charming, hilarious, accidental and sloppy to con
vey with words alone. If you really want to understand the
sweet ineptitude of dating at the Farm, you've got to experi
ence it hands-on: Wreak havoc, break hearts, flirt shamelessly,
play mind games all with people smarter than you. Wel
come to Stanford.
