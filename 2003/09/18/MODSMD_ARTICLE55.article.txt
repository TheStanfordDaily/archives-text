# Roomies matched to make perfect fit
## 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To some the word "roommate" is a
noun. But to Emil Martinsek and Stephanie
Mika, it's a verb.
As coordinators in the New Undergrad
uate Housing Office, senior Martinsek and
junior Mika spent the summer placing the
Stanford Class of 2007 in housing and
matching freshmen together as roommates.
The coordinators' work began in mid-
June, when new students returned forms
containing details on academic interests,
music tastes and work habits.
In July, the duo performed an initial
read-through of the roommate forms and
highlighted information pertinent to pair
ing students together. Such information
ranged from allergies to sleeping habits.
The next step involved in placing stu
dents into residential programs like Fresh
man / Sophomore College and SLE, was a
housing allocation program that sorted
through the rest of the incoming class.
Once this was completed, the two coor
dinators spent the rest of the summer scan
ning assignments by hand and considering
what will make successful roommate pairs.
"Our goal is to create a microcosm of the
University in every dorm and for students to
have a community within their residence,"
Martinsek says.
This year the coordinators have seen a
rise in requests for all-freshmen housing
about 1,070 new students were hoping for
an all-freshmen dorm, while Stanford only
has 850 such spots.

"People are really excited about Bran
ner re-opening and the Wilbur / Stern
area," Mika says.
But the rise in requests for all-freshmen
housing also created some unrest in the class.
"Students are much more vocal this year
than last year about not getting all-frosh
housing if they requested it," Mika says.
While there is no guarantee that any
roommate pairing will be successful,
the coordinators carefully comb through
forms and have developed a formula for
"roommating" that takes into accounts
many key aspects to a good living situa
tion
"This includes pairing people with similar
study habits," Mika said. "We also look at a
student's ethnicity, region, projected academ
ic interest and ultimate academic goals.
"Within these criteria, we would like to
pair people together with at least three dif
ferences out of four," says Mika
But most surprisingly, music choices pro
vide an unlikely source of help in the pairing
process.
"Listening to music starts a number of
conversations between students in the
dorms," Martinsek says. "It can also be a
source of conflict when two people's music
tastes really clash. So that's another piece of
information we use as we go through
forms."
Because students are already placed into
dorms based on their preferences when
search for a roommate begins, limiting the
number of potential bunkmates consider
ably, finding the perfect match from a pool
of over 1,700 is rare. But it can still happen.

"We have one freshman who is an avid
Janet Jackson fan and a night owl and we
were hoping to find someone who shared
these criteria," Martinsek said. "It turned
out that, in the same dorm, there was a stu
dent who met all of our other requirements,

tended to stay up late and listed Janet Jack
son as a favorite artist."
And the coordinators have even fielded
questions from distressed parents.
"For some reason, parents think that a
co-ed floor means their daughter will be liv

ing with a male student or that their son will
be showering with the women on his hall
way," Mika says. "We've definitely relieved
lots of parents this summer by explaining
exactly what a co-ed living situation en
tails."
