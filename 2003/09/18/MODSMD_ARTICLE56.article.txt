# A
						quick checklist of hip hangouts
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN DESK EDITOR 
As a freshman, one of the greatest fictions
is the notion that freshmen never get off cam
pus. The truth is that the absence of cars
makes this the perfect time to begin what will
certainly be a life-long experiment with pub
lic transportation and procrastination.
Not only will you ride the Caltrain in
your comfy Stanford sweatshirt, but you
will also spend hours, nay — days— putter
ing around San Francisco and Berkeley, try
ing to forget about the undigested entrails
of the I-Hum or SLE papers you will give
your TA the next morning. But hey, if a visit
to a hookah joint helps you choose a major,
who cares?
Palo Alto Hangouts
University Avenue is too obvious a lo
cale to include in this subtle dissection of
Bay Area hangouts —so we will skip it in
favor of locations you are less likely to
stumble upon.
To begin with, try out Tea Time, a quaint
shop with over 20 varieties of tea (including
Cocoa Chai) and an average client age of 70
that you can lower with your unique pres
ence.
The Dutch Goose in Menlo Park, mean
while, provides relief from Palo Alto's
sterility with its peanut-covered floor,
cheap beer and super deviled eggs.
On the other end of the spectrum, there's
Menlo Park's Cafe Barrone with its sunny
terrace and relaxed yuppiness and Black
Pearl (California Avenue), which remains
Stanford's favorite pearl-milk tea joint. The
Gelato Joint is the spot for icy Italian treats.
Entertainment
If the Marguerite isn't your idea of
smooth lane-cruising, hit up Palo Alto
Bowl, only a couple of miles from campus.
Since Stanford's last real party was back in
1891, the Saturday night Disco set-up —
complete with smoke, mirrors, music—will
be a welcome escape from your mono
chrome existence.

Not satisfied with the spastic fooz-ball
players in your lounge? Visit Dave and
Buster's, described rather alarmingly as
"Chuck E Cheese for adults" by one e-zine.
Get into a batting cage, feed your NRA fan
tasies in the shooting gallery and knock
around some pool balls.
Q-Zar Laser Tag in Redwood City is the

perfect place to invite that arrogant kid
from I-Hum and shoot his virtual brains out.
Further, if you wish to putt a safe dis
tance away from Stanford's club-wielding
graduate students, try Sunnyvale's
Golfland USA. This mini-golf venue is
home to such famous holes as Wonky Cas
tle and Requisite Windmill and boasts two

mid-level courses.
San Francisco
Your dorm scavenger hunt, run by high
ly conservative RAs, will take you to Fish
erman's Wharf, Union Square, North
Beach, China Town, the Metreon and Big

Al's Sex Shop.
For anyone new to the city, however,
there is no place more fascinating than
Haight-Ashbury. Full of egregiously expen
sive hipster-joints posing as thrift stores and
potheads posing as potheads, this street suc
ceeds in retaining its 60s hippie vibe.
Browse the awesome bookshops, camp
out in the huge music stores (Amoeba!) and
check out the wide range of eateries. Kan
zaman, an Arabian restaurant with flavored
hookahs and friendly belly-dancers, is high
ly recommended.
Other districts worthy of a stroll are the
Mission, famous for its dirt-cheap shops and
gigantic Hispanic murals and the Castro,
the hub of the rainbow movement in S.F.
and a great introduction to this city's unique
culture (one shop is named, rather charac
teristically: "Does Your Father Know?").
And if all this urban excitement makes
you yearn for the rural environs of Stanford,
amble through The Golden Gate Park's
fabulous Botanical Gardens (consisting of a
Cloud Forest and Bamboo patch among
other delights) and learn that life's a picnic
waiting to happen.
Berkeley
There are few experiences—sky-diving
and bungee jumping being among them—
that can approach the sheer adrenaline
pumping thrill of walking down Berkeley's
famed Telegraph Street in an oversize Stan
ford jersey. So don't miss out.
Apart from the usual fare of palm-read
ers and used book stores, you will encounter
Amoeba, a sprawling music warehouse.
And then, once you've tired of thumbing
through the stacks of used CDs, head to
Rasputin to compare prices.
This guide is not, as you may surmise, a
complete listing of happening places in the
Bay Area, but it should give you good enough
reason to get off your butt and explore.
And the moral of the story, as with most
other things on the Farm, is couched in
paradox: You can have a life here at Stan
ford — but only if you get out of it often
enough.

The Aquarius Theater in Palo Alto specializes in vintage and art films. The Bay Area has an active art and entertainment scene that should
sate anyone's fancies..
