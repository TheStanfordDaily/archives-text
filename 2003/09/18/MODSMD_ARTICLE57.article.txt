You've been cooped up all summer, trying to avoid the
heat by hiding out in the movie theater, listening to Beyonce's
"Crazy in Love" in your car with the air on full blast. But now
that fall's here, it's time to get out and get active.
Because your dorm can get pretty stuffy, it's good to know
the ins and outs of the great outdoors around the Stanford

campus. Whether you're into lazy afternoon hikes or extreme
sports, the Bay area boasts something for just about everyone.
While you're on campus, take the opportunity to check out
some of the great running and hiking trails around the golf
course and Lake Lagunita. There's an excellent running trail
to the Dish that will surely get your heart pounding and keep
it that way for three and a half miles. If you choose to run the
perimeter of the golf course, it's about two and a half miles,
and for those of you interested in a shorter jog, the path
around Lake Lag is almost one mile.
If you prefer the beach to the lake, Half Moon Bay, locat
ed about 45 minutes north of Stanford on Interstate 280, re
mains a popular spot for those longing to hit the beach. If
you're looking for an area to surf, Half Moon Bay State
Beach, along Highway 1, is one of the state's longest stretches
of uninterrupted beach. For campers, Francis Beach (at the
Kelley Avenue exit off Highway 92) allows for overnight
camping.
Santa Cruz is also a great close destination for those look
ing to spend an afternoon in the sun and sand and aboard
some of the state's oldest roller coasters. Monterey, about an
hour and a half south of Stanford, offers scuba diving and sea
kayaking.
If you're interested in other water sports, check into river
rafting. The season extends from March until October. While
rafting is less readily accessible, tours are available through a
number of rafting companies, such as All Outdoors Whitewa
ter Trips and Outback Adventures.
If you are at Lake Lag in the winter, swing by the kayak
club's boathouse. The club, open to students, faculty and staff,
specializes in Whitewater kayaking. It also has a Web site:
www.stanford.edu/group/KayakClub.
Don't be surprised if you run into a few sailors and wind
surfers while you're at the lake. If you're interested in getting
started with sailing, the one-unit sailing activity class is a great
way to get your feet wet. And if you really feel like going over
board, set sail with the Stanford Sailing Association.
For true outdoor aficionados, one of the most beautiful
parks, Yosemite, is just 4.5 hours north. A popular destination
for both hikers and campers, Yosemite offers the chance to get
up close and personal with the scenery that inspired photogra
pher Ansel Adams.
A haven for hikers and nature enthusiasts alike, Yosemite
offers trails for all levels. While more experienced hikers may
want to tackle Half Dome, those looking for a less rigorous
hike can choose from a number of other trails that offer some
truly magnificent scenery.
If you'd prefer a weekend trip, drive up to Lake Tahoe. The
drive can take about six hours, depending on traffic. The ski
season runs from about December through May.
There are a number of resorts in the Tahoe area, the most
popular, especially among Stanford students, include Heav
enly, North Star and Alpine Meadows. Most resorts offer spe
cial student prices or discounts, and advertise on their Web
sites.
For those of you with a truly adventurous spirit looking to
take to the skies, bungee jumping, flying, hang gliding, sky
diving and ballooning can all be done in the Bay Area. If you
really want to take off, get in touch with the Stanford Flying
Club. They can get you in the pilot's seat in no time.
