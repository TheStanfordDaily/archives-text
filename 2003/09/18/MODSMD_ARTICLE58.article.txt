# Yo, Yo! Language on the go
## 
### 
Stanford students speak a differ
ent language from the outside
world. Call it Stanfordese, Farmon
ics or Cardinalingo.
Whatever the name, freshmen
will soon be speaking this unique
tongue. In principle, this regional
language consists of taking two or
more words and rendering them
into catchy little rhythmic smaller
words.
Is Stanford Phonics for you?
Here's a short glossary to get you
started.
AA: Academic Advisor. These are
the faculty and staff members who
advise freshmen.
Co Ho: The Coffee House. The re
cently renovated Stanford hangout
in Tresidder Union that serves
sandwiches and coffee.
Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
auditorium located across from the
Co Ho. (Yo Yo!)
Flo Mo: Florence Moore Hall. A
big dormitory located just off of the
Row, named after a woman named
Florence Moore. She gave Stanford
lots of money. And she loved ice

cream, so it's served with every
meal.
Fro So Co: Freshman Sophomore
College. Fro So Co holds two titles:
First, it is the most isolated and bor
derline-off campus dorm, and sec
ond, it has the biggest rooms for
freshmen.
Mem Aud: Memorial Auditorium.
An auditorium located across from
Hoover Tower. They show FLiCKS
there every Sunday night. FLiCKS
are cheap movies with paper fights
included.
Mem Chu: Memorial Church. A
non-denominational church locat
ed in the Quad. The pews are hard
wood, but the peaceful atmosphere
of the church make it an ideal after
noon nap spot.
MuFuUnSun: Music and Fun
Under the Sun. Event that takes
place on Tuesday. Free food. Yum.
PAA: Peer Academic Adviser.
These are the upperclassmen who
advise freshmen.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman.

Hosts), who coordinate the
dorm's pro fro ro ho activities.
Phew.
Res Ed: Residential Education.

ucational programs in dormitories

So Co: Sophomore College. Billed

ing on campus or a cheap way to get
a luxury cruise to Galapagos.
Tres Ex: Tresidder Express. The
on-campus store, located in Tresid
der. They sell Cheetos, deodorant
and other tasty things. For bigger
orders, head to Safeway down El

location is a secret.
