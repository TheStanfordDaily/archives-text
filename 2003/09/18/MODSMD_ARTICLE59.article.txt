# Just the facts
## All of your questions answered 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
Despite the army of staff members assigned to your
dorm, your first few weeks at Stanford can be confus
ing. So, in honor of Jayson Blair, we fabricated this list
of questions from imaginary freshmen. Then we pro
vided our answers.
Q: How do I pay my University bill and ensure my fi
nancial aid? Penny Nuggets, Prescott, Ariz.
A: To pay your bill during the Orientation period go
to the Oak West lounge on the second floor of Tresid
der Union. If you have written your check already and
have recovered from shock over the exorbitant sum,
just look for the big box to deposit your yellow, tear
soaked envelope. If you suspect an error in your bill,
need to get loan disbursements, or need to pick up
scholarship money, there are specific counters to as
sist you. But if you have questions, come early; lines
can get long. For grief counseling head over to Vaden.
Q: What happens if I miss an orientation activity?
Paranoid Peter, Denton, Tex.
A: You fail out of college and end up a lonely pan
handler on a street corner if you're lucky. Actual
ly, once you become an undergraduate, your time
management decisions are yours alone. Orientation
activities are optional no matter what your RA
tells you. Of course, it isn't very fun to be the only one
who can't complain about how stupid the program
ming was. You may also alienate yourself from the
rest of your dorm because you didn't get to yell "Bran
ner sucks" in an auditorium en masse. So unless you
have something better to do and someone better to do
it with (hubba hubba), you might as well go.
Q: Do I need to take a math, chemistry or foreign lan
guage placement test? Jeff Beaker, New York, N. Y.
A: Math: If you do not have AP credits or college
transfer credit and wish to take math, you should take
the math placement test. Those who have AP credits
are encouraged to take the test as well. Math place
ment tests last an hour. Take them on computers in
dorm clusters. Plan to take this test before you meet
with your academic adviser. Your score, which you
will get as soon as you finish the test, is strictly per
sonal information that you can use to decide which
math class you will enroll in at Stanford.
Chemistry: If you want to take chemistry at Stanford
and do not have AP credit or transfer credit, you
should take the online placement exam, which also
takes about one hour. Your score is confidential and
will be used to place you in a chemistry course on cam
pus. Check your orientation calendar for times and lo
cations.

Foreign Languages: The University requires all stu
dents to achieve competence in foreign language
equivalent to a third quarter, first year course. If you
have studied a foreign language and plan to take the
same language at Stanford, you need to take the
placement test to determine which class to take. Some
students have completed the written section of the
test online over the summer. The oral exam is still re
quired, and times for these tests are listed in the Ori
entation guide. Students who haven't taken the online
section should contact that language's coordinator.
Q: How do I find my way around campus?
Lost Lucy, Chicago, 111.
A: Carry a map and ask people for directions - don't
worry we expect it from kids who carry their keys
around their necks on red lanyard.
Q: If I'm having trouble with a class, can I get a tutor?
Ace Notsomore, Sacramento, Calif.
A: No. If you can't hack it then go home. On second
thought, Stanford has some resources for students
looking for help in their classes. When you need more
specific attention than your Head Peer Academic
Counselor, Writing Tutor, Academic Advisor and
Peer Academic Advisor can offer you, the Center for
Teaching and Learning may be of assistance. Each
year, CTL processes about 2,000 requests for help. In
addition, the CTL offers math and chemistry tutoring
regularly. For tutoring information call the CTL at
723-1326. Another option is the community bulletin
board near Jamba Juice in Tresidder Union.
There you can find people who are able to tutor in
various subjects, particularly foreign languages. Be
sure to check out your TAs office hours and consult
with your profs as well.
Q: How do I add my e-mail, phone number and room
number to the directory? Lotsa Digits, Tampa, Fl.
A: You can add information to your file on the on-line
system (www.stanfordwho.com) by signing on to
Axess (hold your horses, that address is: axess.stan
ford.edu) account on the Internet. Once you have
logged on, go to the "your portfolio" bar on the left.
You may not want to make all of your information
available to just anyone, however. There is an option
that allows only community members to have access
to your personal contact information.
Q: How do I get involved with The Daily?
Scribble Scribbler, Los Angeles
A: You can't. Unless you have a sense of humor, like
the author of this article. The first training session is
Tuesday, Sept. 23 at 7:30 p.m. at the Daily office,
across from Roble Hall. If you're otherwise engaged
(wink wink), other training sessions will follow.
