# Kiss & tell these traditions
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has 112 years of traditions, which range
from the mundane (complaining about dining hall
food) to the riveting (like "Exotic Erotic," the an
nual clothing-optional bash).
Every Sunday, students recycle a week's worth of
newspapers in the traditional FLiCKS paper fight in
Memorial Auditorium. Those students who come
for the movie attend the 7 p.m. showing, which, con
trary to popular belief, is open to undergraduate as
well as graduate students. By 10 p.m., the less atten
tive are venting their anger in this campus-wide Bat
tle Royale known as the late show.
FLiCKS debuts with a showing of "The Matrix
Reloaded" on Sunday Sept. 28.
Many earless freshmen seize the opportunity to
venture into the city during their dorm's scavenger
hunt. Students may never again have the chance to
moon the Blue and Gold Fleet (and record it on
camera) and try to get a picture with the mayor on
the same afternoon. No one is known to have pulled
this off, but maybe this fall you can find a candidate
for governor instead.
Students don't need to go off-campus to have a
zany college experience, because some traditions
are delivered straight to your dorm. Listen for the
Stanford Band spontaneously playing outside
dorms all year long, or go fountain-hopping after a
football game.
Stanford's sports traditions change with the suc
cess of Cardinal teams. The Big Game Bonfire may
fizzle when the team is 2-6, but the Cardinal's solid
first-game win brings hope that the bonfire will roar
once more. That Saturday in November, the mighty
Cardinal will fight to regain the Axe from the
clutches of the feral Golden Bear.

Every winter, students pile into vans and buses
which wind their way up the mountains surround
ing Lake Tahoe. The powder can be hit-or-miss, but
fun is guaranteed in this different climate.
Some traditions are a bit more racy. Full Moon
on the Quad gives freshmen a chance to meet se
niors without the pressure of introductions. Be
ware: Students of all ages including graduate
students have been known to impersonate se
niors for the chance to kiss freshmen. Again, cloth
ing is optional.
Gaities Stanford's original pep musical is
replete with nudity and lame slams at Cal's athletic
and academic prowess. University President John
Hennessy and Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet
usually make cameo appearances fully clothed,
of course.
Secret Snowflake lightens up December's Dead
Week and finals with debauchery in the dining halls
as students trade dares for presents.
During Winter Quarter's chilly weather, Stan
ford's traditions hibernate, waiting to be awoken
with the Spring thaw.
Springtime "Screw Your Roommate" dances
provide an outlet for freshmen, as long as you don't
actually screw your roommate by not getting him a
date.
Boat dances and "The Game" a 24-hour scav
enger-hunt-on-steroids punctuate the year, per
haps coupled with a trip to Yosemite, but by that
time most freshmen have their own traditions to
worry about.
Freshmen year traditions are unduplicated, and
often surprisingly fun. Throw yourself into them
with abandon.
Now it's time to let it all out and learn to jump at
the right time in "All Right Now." Get out there
and do it.

not an official Stanford student until he has been kissed by a senior.
