# Branner opens doors to frosh
## Dorm was closed last year for CIP 
### SHIRIN SHIRIF STAFF WRITER 
As Branner re-opens today after a 9-
month, $20.2 million renovation, fresh
men will be greeted with refurbished
rooms - complete with new furniture,
paint, lighting and carpeting, new bath
rooms with the latest plumbing, fixtures,
and showers, and a redone lounge with
new TV cabinets, lighting, paints, and
carpeting.
"It's nicer in every conceivable fash
ion," said RAs Sagar Chandaria, a se
nior.
RA J.P. Schnapper-Casteras, a junior,
who like Chandaria lived in Branner his
freshman year, added that "It's well-lit
and the water isn't brown. Before, it just
wasn't up to today's standards."
Other changes to Branner include
several new study rooms, new kitch
enettes, a stronger foundation and struc
ture, a new laundry room, an enlarged
computer cluster, screens on windows,
and a new courtyard.
There are also new outdoor social
areas with barbecue pits, a new, larger 2-
story RF cottage, along with new fire
alarms and sprinklers. Some doubles
were converted to singles as the Residen
tial Housing and Dining Enterprises felt
that the original rooms were too small.
"I think that this has been an exciting
and rewarding project," said Executive
Director of Student Housing Rodger
Whitney. "We have brought an 80-year
old, tired, run-down and beat-up dorm
back to life so that it can start its next 80
years. It's truly a transformation."
Although the new elevator and the
new well-lit basement with study rooms,
storage space and laundry room were top
contenders, the RAs' favorite feature of
the renovation was the courtyard.
"It's useful and beautiful," Schnap
per-Casteras said. "It went from being a
marsh to being a high-class, swanky cafe;
it went from being California to being

France."
The residential renovation cost about
$l5 million while the dining renovation
cost $5.2 million. The new kitchen area
and seven-station servery, described by
Whitney as "state-of-the-art and con
temporary," was undeniably necessary as
Branner meals had been prepared in the
Manzanita kitchen for the past few years.
"I think it [Branner] is really, really
nice," said incoming freshman Lisa Fal
zone, who moved in early for athletic
commitments. "There is much more
space than I thought there would be.
Somebody who graduated eighteen
years ago recommended it to me. I've
heard that everyone outside of Branner
hates it, but that the people living there
love it."
Branner houses 174 freshmen this
year - more than 10 percent of the fresh
man class. It is the largest all-frosh dorm
and has earned the slogan, "Branner
sucks," which the other dorms chant dur
ing large freshman gatherings.
"I never thought Branner sucked, but
I do now," said senior Nic Kanaan, who
lived in Rinconada his freshman year. "I
think it sucks that one freshman dorm is
really nice when the rest are not-so
nice."
RAs Chandaria and Schnapper-Cast
eras think that the dorm rivalry is good
because it promotes interaction between
dorms. But it can also go way too far and
be "slandering, biting and dangerous,"
says Chandaria.
"I don't know why Branner sucks,"
said senior Mike Etchepare, an RA in
Otero. "It just does."
"Come see it before you say it sucks,"
warned Chandaria.
Branner's renovations came as part of the
Capital Improvement Program, a 19-year
renovation program that upgrades older
housing facilities at Stanford. Housing and
Dining Enterprises gets input from RFs,
dorm staff, and students at house meetings
as it plans for renovation. There is usually
one year of planning with one year of con
struction. Next on the CIP agenda are
Roble, which is set for renovation in 'O5-'O6
and Crothers, which is scheduled for 'O6-'O7.
