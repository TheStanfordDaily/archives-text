# Nuclear pioneer dies at age 95
## Hoover Fellow Edward Teller worked on atomic weapons projects 
### ILENA C. GEORGE DESK EDITOR 
Edward Teller, a highly controversial fig
ure in 20th century science, died on Sept. 9 at
his home on Stanford campus. The Hoover
Fellow and nuclear weapons pioneer was 95
years old.
Teller played an important role in the cre
ation of both the atomic and hydrogen
bombs and was a vocal supporter of the use
of nuclear power for both defensive and
peaceful purposes. His infamous rivalry with
colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer led him to
his testify against Oppenheimer, causing a
rift that resulted in his estrangement from
much of the scientific community. Teller's
political influence helped lead President
Ronald Reagan to take on the "Star Wars"
initiative of the 1980s. Most recently, he was
awarded the Presidential Medal of Free
dom.
Teller was born in Budapest, Hungary on
Jan. 15,1908. The son of a lawyer and a pi
anist, his parents were dismayed when he an
nounced he wanted to study mathematics, a
subject he found he had a great talent in at an
early age. He studied in Germany, receiving
a doctorate degree in theoretical physics (at
age 22) at the University of Leipzig. But as
Adolf Hitler was rising to power, the situa
tion in Germany became more dangerous
for Jewish scientist and he came to the Unit
ed States in 1938, accepting a position at
George Washington University, where he
studied radioactive decay.
He entered the world of nuclear weapons
development in an unusual way: as a chauf
feur. In 1939, leading scientists felt strongly
that America and her allies needed to devel
op a nuclear weapon before Germany as the
country became an increasingly dangerous
threat. In order to convince President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, scientist Leo Szilard
(a fellow Hungarian) decided to seek out Al
bert Einstein and request that he sign a letter
showing his support. Szilard, however, was
unable to drive, so Teller that drove the pair
to Einstein's home on Long Island. Einstein
signed the letter, which was sent to President
Roosevelt. Roosevelt agreed to support re
search into nuclear weaponry.

In 1943, Teller became a member of the
resulting Manhattan Project, where many
top scientists met secretly at the Los Alamos
laboratory in New Mexico and worked to
create the atomic bomb. The fruits of their
labor were dropped on Hiroshima and Na
gasaki, ending both thousands of lives and
World War II.
The atomic bomb released energy
through fission, or the splitting of atoms. A
hydrogen bomb (also known as a thermonu
clear bomb) does the reverse; it unleashes
huge amounts of energy through the fusion
of hydrogen atoms.
Teller became alerted to the possibility of
creating a hydrogen bomb after meeting
with Enrico Fermi - a prominent Italian

physicist working at the University of Chica
go - who suggested that the detonation of an
atomic bomb would provide enough energy
to cause hydrogen atoms to fuse, releasing
further immense quantities of energy.
At Los Alamos, Teller pushed the group
to focus their efforts on the creation of a
thermonuclear weapon, the hydrogen
bomb, but Oppenheimer, who was the scien
tific director of the project, saw this as a dis
traction and the other scientists agreed.
Work was to take place towards creation of
the atomic bomb alone. This was a source of
contention between the two scientists. The

bomb at Livermore Laboratory.
conflict between Teller and Oppen
heimer only grew with time.
After World War II had ended
and America was in the throes of
the Cold War, Teller was deeply
concerned about the prospect of the
Soviet Union gaining weapons su
premacy over the United States.
His earlier experiences in Hungary
under communism and fascism
deeply affected his views. He and
other scientists of the day continued
to urge President Truman to sup
port research for the hydrogen
bomb, which some saw as essential
to keeping the Soviets at bay.
Teller's efforts were instrumen
tal in the creation of the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, and he
served as its director from 1958 to
1960. Livermore, the nation's sec
ond laboratory for the creation of
nuclear weapons, focused its efforts
on constructing an H-bomb. His ef
forts were spurned at first by the
lab's General Advisory
Committee - led by Oppenheimer -

which added to the tension between
the scientists.
In 1954, Oppenheimer's loyalty
to the United States was questioned
as part of the "Red Scare" and the
Atomic Energy Commission was
ordered by President Eisenhower
to investigate whether or not Op
penheimer should be allowed to
keep his security clearance. Teller
was called upon to testify before the
commission's personnel security
board.
Although Teller's testimony was
largely benign, when asked whether
he considered Oppenheimer a secu
rity risk, Teller infamously said, "I
thoroughly disagreed with him in
numerous issues and his actions
frankly appeared to me confused
and complicated."
He concluded by saying, "In this
very limited sense I would like to
express a feeling that I would feel
personally more secure if public
matters would rest in other hands."
This testimony was in part what
caused the revocation of Oppen
heimer's security clearance. Subse
quent to his testimony, the scientif
ic world turned its back on Teller
and old colleagues and collabora
tors refused to associate with him.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Teller
continued to be a vocal proponent
of nuclear power and the need to
have both a strong defensive strate
gy as well as an offensive arsenal.
Although his opinions were often
unpopular, particularly with liber
als (during the Vietnam War, anti
war protestors burned his effigy),
the government often took his ad
vice to heart. In particular, he was
instrumental force behind Presi
dent Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative (nicknamed "Star Wars").
For his achievements, Teller won a vast
number of awards, including the Enrico
FemiiAward,theNationaMedalofScience
and the Harvey Prize firm the Technion-Is
rael Institute. He was a professor at the Uni
versity of California- Berkeley and was a fel
low of the American Physical Society and
AmericanNudearSoaetyandamemberof
the National Academy of Sciences. Since
1975 he had been a senior research fellow at
Stanford's Hoover Institution.
Earlier this summer, Teller was
awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom - the government's high
est civil accolade - for his work on
national defense projects.
He is survived by his daughter,
Wendy, his son, Paul, four grand
children and one great-grandchild.
