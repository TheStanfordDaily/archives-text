# Nuclear pioneer dies at age 95
## Hoover Fellow Edward Teller worked on atomic weapons projects

Edward Teller, a highly controversial fig
ure in 20th century science, died on Sept. 9 at
his home on Stanford campus. The Hoover
Fellow and nuclear weapons pioneer was 95
years old.
Teller played an important role in the cre
ation of both the atomic and hydrogen
bombs and was a vocal supporter of the use
of nuclear power for both defensive and
peaceful purposes. His infamous rivalry with
colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer led him to
his testify against Oppenheimer, causing a
rift that resulted in his estrangement from
much of the scientific community. Teller's
political influence helped lead President
Ronald Reagan to take on the "Star Wars"
initiative of the 1980s. Most recently, he was
awarded the Presidential Medal of Free
dom.
Teller was born in Budapest, Hungary on
Jan. 15,1908. The son of a lawyer and a pi
anist, his parents were dismayed when he an
nounced he wanted to study mathematics, a
subject he found he had a great talent in at an
early age. He studied in Germany, receiving
a doctorate degree in theoretical physics (at
age 22) at the University of Leipzig. But as
Adolf Hitler was rising to power, the situa
tion in Germany became more dangerous
for Jewish scientist and he came to the Unit
ed States in 1938, accepting a position at
George Washington University, where he
studied radioactive decay.
He entered the world of nuclear weapons
development in an unusual way: as a chauf
feur. In 1939, leading scientists felt strongly
that America and her allies needed to devel
op a nuclear weapon before Germany as the
country became an increasingly dangerous
threat. In order to convince President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, scientist Leo Szilard
(a fellow Hungarian) decided to seek out Al
bert Einstein and request that he sign a letter
showing his support. Szilard, however, was
unable to drive, so Teller that drove the pair
to Einstein's home on Long Island. Einstein
signed the letter, which was sent to President
Roosevelt. Roosevelt agreed to support re
search into nuclear weaponry.

In 1943, Teller became a member of the
resulting Manhattan Project, where many
top scientists met secretly at the Los Alamos
laboratory in New Mexico and worked to
create the atomic bomb. The fruits of their
labor were dropped on Hiroshima and Na
gasaki, ending both thousands of lives and
World War II.
The atomic bomb released energy
through fission, or the splitting of atoms. A
hydrogen bomb (also known as a thermonu
clear bomb) does the reverse; it unleashes
huge amounts of energy through the fusion
of hydrogen atoms.
Teller became alerted to the possibility of
creating a hydrogen bomb after meeting
with Enrico Fermi - a prominent Italian

physicist working at the University of Chica
go - who suggested that the detonation of an
atomic bomb would provide enough energy
to cause hydrogen atoms to fuse, releasing
further immense quantities of energy.
At Los Alamos, Teller pushed the group
to focus their efforts on the creation of a
thermonuclear weapon, the hydrogen
bomb, but Oppenheimer, who was the scien
tific director of the project, saw this as a dis
traction and the other scientists agreed.
Work was to take place towards creation of
the atomic bomb alone. This was a source of
contention between the two scientists. The

of the past half century, in eluding the Manhattan Project and the development of the hydrogen
bomb at Livermore Laboratory.
