# Blaster worm strikes campus
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford continues to be plagued by the
computer viruses that bombarded campus
computers over the summer, creating a
headache for returning students trying to set
up their Internet connections.
When residents arrive to sign in at their
dorm, they are given "Essential Stanford
Software" compact discs along with their
room key. Students cannot set up their In
ternet access until they have run the RPC
Cleaner utility included on the disk.
"Students can't register for internet ser
vice without using the RPC Cleaner," Kim
ball Resident Computer Coordinator Chris
Lin said. "The cleaner scans computers for
the Blaster Worm, in addition to three other
viruses, and then installs a patch."
Blaster Worm and its variants were this
summer's most widespread bug, although it
only affects the Windows 2000 and XP op
erating system - Macintosh computers, for
example, are not susceptible. The worm is
particularly problematic because it is spread
automatically to any vulnerable PC plugged
into the network; it does not spread through
bugged e-mail attachments.
"Just plugging your computer into the
wall can get you the worm," Lin said.
Around 6,000 computers were infected
over the summer, and it is predicted that 25
percent of students will arrive on campus
with infected computers.
For this reason, Okada RCC Luis Carde
nas said, it is necessary that RCCs take extra
precautions before granting Internet access
to residents.

"The two vulnerable operating systems
are prevented from having full Internet ac
cess until [students] download the patch,"
he said.
The RPC Cleaner was not issued until
Sept. 12, so students arriving on campus be
fore then were able to get Internet access
without downloading the patch. As a result,
many of these students' computers have dis
played vulnerabilities to the viruses and
their Internet has since been shut down. Ac
cess will be granted again when these stu
dents run the RPC Cleaner.
There have been three waves of virus at
tacks since July 31. It is believed that hack
ers intend to use the worms to shut down
Web sites that provide protective patches or
that experience heavy Internet traffic, mak
ing businesses and universities particularly
susceptible.
The most prominent problem that stu
dents have encountered as a result of these
virus attacks is the presence of hundreds of

itinerant e-mails in their inboxes over
the summer - for example, one stu
dent emailed the parking and trans
portation department, and that email
was sent out to the thousands of stu
dents on the parking-general list.
"Some students found that if they
sent an e-mail, it was sent to an entire
list," Cardenas said. "So students re
ceived lots of e-mails they weren't
supposed to."
The RPC Cleaner and patch is in
tended to satisfactorily clear comput

ers for Internet use. Some students,
however, continue to have problems.
"The program didn't find my
virus," sophomore Ruth Emerson
said. "Something is wrong with my
computer that I don't think affects
Windows, but my Internet won't con
nect. When I try, a window pops up
that says 'Shit! Connection failed!' "
Other students grumbled about
the problems presented by the RPC
Cleaner itself.

"It took me four hours to get my
computer working after running the
Cleaner," sophomore Joanna Kao
said. "The Cleaner just kept running
and running and wouldn't stop, even
though it told me I had no virus."
