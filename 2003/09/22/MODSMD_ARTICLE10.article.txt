## Recall must not be delayed 
### 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals will take a second look
today at its decision to table the
California recall election, origi
nally scheduled for Oct. 7. We urge the
Court to allow the recall election to go for
ward without further delay in order to
bring closure to this unfortunate chapter in
California history.
The American Civil Liberties Union —
the plaintiff in the case — contests that if
the election proceeds next month as
planned, tens of thousands of voters across
the state may be disenfranchised due to
outdated voting technology. Although it is
regrettable that voting procedures might
not be up-to-par in all of California's coun
ties, allowing the recall to be postponed
until a March polling date is not in the
state's best interest.
Remarks from Secretary of State Kevin
Shelley and many of the state's county reg
istrars support an Oct. 7 recall election.
Even Gray Davis said last week that he
would prefer a recall election that happens
sooner rather than later.
Delaying the recall race not only threat
ens to drag out a painful and divisive cam
paign but also runs the risk of outliving
voter interest. As politicians continue to
wrangle for control of the state, many Cali
fornians seem to be growing weary of the
political mess in Sacramento.
Alice Jarboe, manager of voter services in
Sacramento, told The New York Tunes yes
terday that she would like to get the election
behind her. "Every time you turn around,
the rules are changing," she said. "As a
human being, I would like to have a week
end off."
If election officials are already tiring of
the barrage of campaign ads and are grow

ing ever-more confused by the long parade
of court decisions regarding the recall, the
average Californian must be close to giving
up on trying to understand the process.
Although the three-judge panel that orig
inally heard the case may have been philo
sophically correct to postpone the election
until the six counties that currently use
punch-card ballots — the same ballots that
caused the hanging chad debacle in the 2000
presidential race in Florida — update their
voting technology, the practicalities of de
laying the election make it inadvisable.
The ACLU contends that punch-card
voting in six California counties could dis
enfranchise up to 40,000 voters. Many of
these voters are members of minority
groups. An oversight of this magnitude
would be tragic.
But there are some guarantees built into
the electoral process to ensure that such dis
enfranchisement does not take place. The
Department of Justice has already cleared
the election and has approved voting proce
dures in four counties where there is a histo
ry of minority disenfranchisement, as re
quired by the 1965 Voters Rights Act. And
the Secretary of State's office — the state
level department charged with supervising
the election — is in favor of conducting the
election on Oct. 7.
No election is perfect. But even an im
perfect election is better than no election.
Hopefully Californians will be able to make
it through the next two weeks of campaign
ing, they will be able to go to the polls on
Oct. 7 and they will be able to cast their vote
for whether or not to retain Davis as gover
nor. After Oct. 7, Davis or his successor can
work with Shelley to make sure election
procedures are fixed before polling places
open their doors again.
