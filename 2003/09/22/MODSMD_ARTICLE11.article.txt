# New dean a boon for Row
## 
### 
The appointment of German Prof.
Elizabeth Bernhardt as dean of
the Row indicates that advising for
sophomores has become an im
portant priority on the University's agenda.
Of the 1,600 students who live on the
Row, 600 are undeclared sophomores. Cut
off from the academic support of their fresh
man dormitories, these students frequently
slump into a year of academic stasis.
Bernhardt, who will live in an apart
ment at 579 Alvarado Row, will bring a
strong faculty presence to the 19 houses
she will supervise. Her plans to hold din
ners for each house under her jurisdiction
are laudable and will infuse the lower Row
with a touch of scholarship.
Since her arrival at Stanford in 1995,
Bernhardt has demonstrated a strong
commitment to undergraduate education.

She is the director of the language center,
serving as instructional leader for the insti
tution that administers hundreds of classes
to over 7,000 students every year. She has
also served as a member of the Committee
for Undergraduate Studies and as the
chair of the Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising, as well as taught
a Sophomore College class on the German
Resistance.
With her new role as dean of the Row,
Bernhardt will bring energy and dedica
tion to the undergraduate community at
Stanford. The residents of the 19 Row
houses south and east of Campus Drive
will benefit from her talents. Her appoint
ment is a solid step in the right direction to
ensuring that the University provides a
quality advising program to all undergrad
uate students.
