## ANNA ANALYZES The 						naked truth about nudity 
### 
The other night, I looked
outside to see two of my
suitemates racing back to
their rooms in only their
panties and covering their breasts.
When inside, my friend Courtney
stopped to inform everyone — we
were in the midst of hosting our first
party — that she and Megan, my
other suitemate, had lost a game and
were forced to run in the buff
around campus.
"Those girls are naked!" a boy in
the living room yelled in disbelief.
"Um, actually they aren't," an
other girl responded, as the duo
raced back outside — now
clothed — to look for their lost pos
sessions.
The excitement died soon after
and the boys stopped drooling, as
everyone got back to talking and
drinking.
While my suite is a little different
than a co-ed dorm, my friends' reac
tion got me thinking. People often
treat their dorm hallways as locker
rooms, strolling around in their
skivvies and towels when residences
are about as public as the street.
So — to anyone new to our cam
pus — here's the naked truth.
There are a few places you can ex
pect to see people without any clothes
at all. Full Moon on the Quad, Gai
eties, streakers around campus post
finals, the showers at Chi Theta Chi
and Exotic Erotic are just a few.
For a more regular peek at skin,
pseudo-nudity is your best bet.
You'll find it at any party, the Tresid
der fishbowl, locker rooms and even
in your own dorm. You can even be
innocently walking through the quad
and run into a girl who's made the
mistake of combining these fashion
no-nos: bicycle, skirt and thong.
My freshman year, the co-ed
bathroom took a little getting used
to, but at least the showers were sep
arated by gender. And of course I
couldn't walk across the hall to the
shower in only a towel. I had to be

wearing the robe, you know, just in
case I locked myself out of my room
and had to find my resident assistant
to let me back in.

And then, at my first Full Moon on
the Quad, I was slightly traumatized

by a fleet of naked
bicycle riders cir
cling the crowd. It
took me several
long glances to re
alize: Yes, these
people really were
naked.
I think it might
have stopped me
from challenging
any decent foos
ball competitors

when I learned that were I to loose
10-0, I would be forced to run
around the dorm naked. Some more
ballsy players had that fate forced
upon them.
So maybe I was a little naive, but
by the time Exotic Erotic rolled
around, I was still trying to stretch
my two-clothes-item limit to the
most amount of coverage.
But as I get older, I began to dress
down — less, after all, is more.
While I've never ran around campus
naked, I have taken some steps in a
positive direction — well, depend
ing on your feelings about nudity.
My roommates sophomore year
were big fans of throwing sponta
neous dance parties in our room.
When we girls hang out together, we
like to wear only bras and panties and
have pillow-fights — NOT! Guys:
Get your minds out of the gutter!
Anyway, when two of my friends
streaked naked during Gaieties my
sophomore year, I was more in awe
of their bravery and less in shock that
they would streak in front of 1,700
people.

And the biggest step came at the
beginning of this summer, when I
moved into Chi Theta Chi, where I
lived for three months. I feared the
infamous co-ed shower that I had

only heard about. With three show
erheads and no curtains between the
showers, it seemed like my worst
nightmare.
Weren't these the people that had
a tradition of streaking through the
quad and showering together after
special dinner? I wasn't sure about
living in a house that purposefully
chose not to install shower curtains
because it was "a tradition."
But it turns out that it really
wasn't a big deal. Granted, I was
shocked the first time I walked into
the kitchen and saw a girl baking in
only panties and an apron. And like
any other dorm, guys walked around
shirtless.
But that was about it.
Dormmates were very respectful
of other people's limits; they even
waited for others to get out of the
shower before entering.
So while it seemed like the group
shower may have been overrated, I
did take advantage of a few more op
portunities for pseudo-nakedness. I
started out lying in the yard in a bikini
to soak up the rays. But then, in pur
suit of the perfect tan, my best friend
and I took to lying on top of the roof at
Chi Theta Chi naked. It was a big step
for me. But I figured, if I couldn't get
naked on the roof of Chi Theta Chi,
my opportunities for blatant naked
ness were quickly dwindling.
So my point is: You new students
might get freaked out about nudity,
but who really cares? You are bound
to encounter it, so why not just take
it in as any new experience you'd
have at Stanford. You know, bare
your soul — and everything else
along with it.

sophomore year, I was more in awe
of their bravery and less in shock that
they would streak in front of 1,700
people.

And the biggest step came at the
beginning of this summer, when I
moved into Chi Theta Chi, where I
lived for three months. I feared the
infamous co-ed shower that I had

only heard about. With three show
erheads and no curtains between the
showers, it seemed like my worst
nightmare.
Weren't these the people that had
a tradition of streaking through the
quad and showering together after
special dinner? I wasn't sure about
living in a house that purposefully
chose not to install shower curtains
because it was "a tradition."
But it turns out that it really
wasn't a big deal. Granted, I was
shocked the first time I walked into
the kitchen and saw a girl baking in
only panties and an apron. And like
any other dorm, guys walked around
shirtless.
But that was about it.
Dormmates were very respectful
of other people's limits; they even
waited for others to get out of the
shower before entering.
So while it seemed like the group
shower may have been overrated, I
did take advantage of a few more op
portunities for pseudo-nakedness. I
started out lying in the yard in a bikini
to soak up the rays. But then, in pur
suit of the perfect tan, my best friend
and I took to lying on top of the roof at
Chi Theta Chi naked. It was a big step
for me. But I figured, if I couldn't get
naked on the roof of Chi Theta Chi,
my opportunities for blatant naked
ness were quickly dwindling.
So my point is: You new students
might get freaked out about nudity,
but who really cares? You are bound
to encounter it, so why not just take
it in as any new experience you'd
have at Stanford. You know, bare
your soul — and everything else
along with it.

The other night, I looked
outside to see two of my
suitemates racing back to
their rooms in only their
panties and covering their breasts.
When inside, my friend Courtney
stopped to inform everyone — we
were in the midst of hosting our first
party — that she and Megan, my
other suitemate, had lost a game and
were forced to run in the buff
around campus.
"Those girls are naked!" a boy in
the living room yelled in disbelief.
"Um, actually they aren't," an
other girl responded, as the duo
raced back outside — now
clothed — to look for their lost pos
sessions.
The excitement died soon after
and the boys stopped drooling, as
everyone got back to talking and
drinking.
While my suite is a little different
than a co-ed dorm, my friends' reac
tion got me thinking. People often
treat their dorm hallways as locker
rooms, strolling around in their
skivvies and towels when residences
are about as public as the street.
So — to anyone new to our cam
pus — here's the naked truth.
There are a few places you can ex
pect to see people without any clothes
at all. Full Moon on the Quad, Gai
eties, streakers around campus post
finals, the showers at Chi Theta Chi
and Exotic Erotic are just a few.
For a more regular peek at skin,
pseudo-nudity is your best bet.
You'll find it at any party, the Tresid
der fishbowl, locker rooms and even
in your own dorm. You can even be
innocently walking through the quad
and run into a girl who's made the
mistake of combining these fashion
no-nos: bicycle, skirt and thong.
My freshman year, the co-ed
bathroom took a little getting used
to, but at least the showers were sep
arated by gender. And of course I
couldn't walk across the hall to the
shower in only a towel. I had to be

wearing the robe, you know, just in
case I locked myself out of my room
and had to find my resident assistant
to let me back in.

And then, at my first Full Moon on
the Quad, I was slightly traumatized

by a fleet of naked
bicycle riders cir
cling the crowd. It
took me several
long glances to re
alize: Yes, these
people really were
naked.
I think it might
have stopped me
from challenging
any decent foos
ball competitors

when I learned that were I to loose
10-0, I would be forced to run
around the dorm naked. Some more
ballsy players had that fate forced
upon them.
So maybe I was a little naive, but
by the time Exotic Erotic rolled
around, I was still trying to stretch
my two-clothes-item limit to the
most amount of coverage.
But as I get older, I began to dress
down — less, after all, is more.
While I've never ran around campus
naked, I have taken some steps in a
positive direction — well, depend
ing on your feelings about nudity.
My roommates sophomore year
were big fans of throwing sponta
neous dance parties in our room.
When we girls hang out together, we
like to wear only bras and panties and
have pillow-fights — NOT! Guys:
Get your minds out of the gutter!
