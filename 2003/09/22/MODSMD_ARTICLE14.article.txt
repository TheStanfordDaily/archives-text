# Regents delayed by protest

### CHARLES PROCTOR THE DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) - Thursday's Uni
versity of California Board of Re
gents meeting was unexpectedly de
layed when approximately 16 stu
dent activists, protesting Regent
Ward Connerly's stance on racial
consideration, were so boisterous
that the regents had to call a recess
during the public comment period.
The students, who were from
local community colleges, UC-
Berkeley and UC-Santa Cruz, were
protesting Proposition 54, an initia
tive authored by Connerly that
would prevent the state from col
lecting information about a person's
race or ethnicity.

The students addressed the re
gents in an orderly fashion at first,
but became increasingly louder and
sharper in their attacks against Con

nerly. Finally, Regent Chairman
John Moores had to call a temporary
recess and university police officers
stood guard in front of the regents.
Although plainclothes University
of California Police Department of
ficers surrounded the students while
they protested, the students left the
building of their own free will.
The students accused Connerly of
being a "racist billionaire" and said
he represented "rich segregation
ists," not the University of California.
James Drake, a fifth-year
rhetoric and African American
studies student at UC-Berkeley,
called upon the regents to "remove
this cancer from the board" in refer
ring to Connerly. Many of the other
students also called on Connerly to
resign.

Connerly seemed hurt by the per
sonal affront, saying that the pro
testers misunderstood his inten

tions.
"There are bona fide reasons
why I think it's desirable to keep
racial information and we've tried
hard to craft that in Proposition 54,
but it's never justifiable to personal
ly attack people," he said.
Connerly, who was appointed by
Gov. Pete Wilson in 1993, added
that he has no intention of resigning
from his position. "I have until
March 1, 2005, and I will serve out
my term," he said.
Proposition 54 is a controversial
initiative that has drawn sharp criti
cism from state education officials,
law enforcement officers, and med
ical practitioners. The regents, cur
rent UC President Richard Atkin
son, and president-elect and current
UC San Diego chancellor Robert
Dynes have all come out against the
initiative. Proposition 54 will be on
the California recall ballot.
