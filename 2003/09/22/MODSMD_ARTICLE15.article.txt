# UCs consider simplifying applications
## 
### REGINA CHEN THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) - The two-day Uni
versity of California Board of Re
gents meeting took on a decidedly
less-contentious tone Thursday as
regents pushed to simplify the fresh
men admissions process and said
final farewells to UC President
Richard Atkinson, who steps down
next month.

The regents poured over UC's re
cent comprehensive review process
after a glowing faculty report praised
the system for keeping up the acade
mic competitiveness of admissions.
However, many of the regents'
questions were left unanswered.
Some regents were skeptical, asking
to see admissions data and methods
for each campus. Others questioned
the sample size.
A major concern that arose from

the report was evidence that UC's
top underrepresented minority ad
mits have increasingly chosen to en
roll at private schools.

The number of UC admits who
chose to enroll in the system during
the last five years has dropped by 2.5
percent, compared to a 4.8 percent
increase in the number who chose
private schools.
The three most popular alterna
tives were University of Southern
California, California State Univer
sity San Luis Obispo and Stanford
University.
And budget cuts to UC outreach
programs in the past two years will
worsen the problem, according to
the report.

"Access for these students will be
an even greater challenge in future
years," the report said.
Already budget cuts have touched
upon admissions in other ways.

UC will completely eliminate
paper applications by fall 2005 to
streamline the application process
and cut printing costs.
Some regents also expressed con
cern that applicants do not consider
each of the UC campuses to be equal
in quality.
"I've always been concerned that
we're creating a three-tiered system
in the UC family," said UC Regent
Ward Connerly.
The number of students referred
from their first-choice schools to
campuses with space doubled in size
from fall 2002 to fall 2003.
All of these students were accept
ed to UC-Riverside, a fact that wor
ried some regents.
A few regents suggested that UC
distribute referred students to sever
al campuses to ease the pressure on
the entire system.
Promoting UC-Riverside and

UC-Merced would take the strain off
of the overenrolled UC-Berkeley
and UCLA campuses, Connerly said.
Although the meeting was fo
cused on admissions, regents made a
ceremonial gesture to Atkinson,
who steps down after this month.

A vocal advocate of affirmative
action, he will leave to make way for
UC-San Diego Chancellor Robert
Dynes to take his place.
After receiving a standing ova
tion, Atkinson urged the board,
which will face a monumental deci
sion this year on whether or not to
cap enrollment, to find a way to pre
serve both quality and access.
"The genius of the California ex
perience is that we have created a
university that is both great and ac
cessible — a public university that
fulfills a distinctly American vision
of democracy and meritocracy,"
Atkinson said.
