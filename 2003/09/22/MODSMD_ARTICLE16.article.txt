# More students turn to federal loans

### CARMEN CUSIDO THE DAILY TARGUM 
(U-WIRE) - Paying for college
can be a challenge for some students,
and taking out federal loans is usual
ly a popular choice.
On Wednesday, The Coalition
for Better Student Loans released
the student opinion results of a na
v tional poll on this issue.
According to a survey released
by Kriger Research Center, Inc., on
behalf of the Coalition, 92 percent
of college students feel the federal
loan program is more important
today than it has been in the past,
91 percent would like Congress to
increase the amount of loans they
can borrow to pay for college ex
penses and 84 percent of students
agree if the government has limited
resources to fund student loans, it
should find a way to offer greater fi
nancial assistance through other
means.
The Coalition, according to its
prepared statement, is composed of
t financial aid administrators, parents,
loan providers and organizations
representing more than 2,000 col
leges and universities.
Students have limited resources
to pay for college, said Dallas Martin
from the National Association of
Student Financial Aid Administra
tors. But Martin, who is also a part of
the Coalition, said the Coalition sent
Congress a comprehensive "student

friendly" proposal to strengthen the
student loan program.
"We first have to increase access
to higher education, then ensure ad
equate funding when enrolled and
make it easier to pay loans when stu
dents graduate," Martin said.
Attending a public university is
supposed to be cheaper than going
to a private university, but with the
increase in tuition it might be less af
fordable to attend a state school.
Myron L. Hanson, a financial ad
ministrator at the University of
Montana, said he is concerned with
the affordability of public education,
adding loans should be more afford
able.
"Over the last 22 years, students
went from taking 41 percent in loans
in their financial aid package to 54
percent," he said. "Loan limits need
to be increased. Another option
would be the re-definition of pay
ment options so they are more af
fordable. ... These are difficult times
in higher education."
Sometimes students face the chal
lenge of having to take out more
loans after a brutal tuition increase.
Sarah Jackson, a student at the
University of Missouri and chair
woman of the school's association of
students, said there was a 20 percent
tuition increase at her university this
year. The association, she said, is
working to increase the amount of
loans students can take.
"Accessibility is our goal," she said.
