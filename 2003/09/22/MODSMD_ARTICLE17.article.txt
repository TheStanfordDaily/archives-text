### TAMI ABDOLLAH THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) - The craze against il
legal music downloading has begun
to take its toll on UC-Berkeley stu
dents.
Only a month into the school year,
the university has shut off Internet
connections to two students and told
10 others to delete illegally uploaded
music, said Brad Andrews, a systems
manager at Residential Computing.
A UC-Berkeley student was one
of 261 people sued by the Recording
Industry Association of America last
Monday for uploading music off
peer-to-peer networks such as

KaZaA and Gnutella.
But students may be spared if
they sign up with the RIAA's new
amnesty program which requires
them to enter into a contract to stop
sharing music files and delete all ille
gally obtained copyrighted files on
their computer.
Amnesty is available only for
those who have not yet been sued for
copyright infringement.
However, this does not prevent
individual song publishers from fil
ing suit against a person.
RIAA spokesperson Amanda
Collins said these lawsuits are only
the first wave against some of the
worst offenders â€” those sharing an

average of 1,000 songs.
UC-Berkeley senior Maryam
Fattahi, an economics major, was the
first student on campus to be sued.
Other defendants included a 12-
year-old girl and many unsuspecting
parents and senior citizens.
Since June 26, the RIAA has filed
more than 1,000 subpoenas. But only
261 were sued in the first round for
logistical reasons, Collins said.
The penalty for copyright in
fringement can be as much as
$150,000 per violation, according to
U.S. copyright laws.
"People need to know there is no
free pass to engage in illegal behav
ior online," Collins said. "That's the

message we're trying to get out and
that there are legal alternatives to
this activity."
Evidence against music upload
ers includes screen shots of their
music files.
This year, the university took
extra steps to educate freshmen in
residence halls on copyright viola
tion and its consequences. Tighter
regulations require that students no
tified about violations respond with
in 24 hours.
UC-Berkeley received a subpoe
na for illegal uploading on an admin
istrative computer in August that
university officials said came from an
outside hacker.
