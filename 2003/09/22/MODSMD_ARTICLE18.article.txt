# Harvard paper sues school for records
## The 						Crimson, backed by the ACLU\ seeks access to campus crime reports 
### DANA GOLDSTEIN THE BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) - The Crimson, Harvard Univer
sity's daily independent student newspaper, is
suing the school for access to the campus police
department's detailed crime reports.
The Crimson, represented by the American
Civil Liberties Union, filed suit in July, said
Harvard senior and Crimson President Amit
Paley. In August, Harvard asked a judge to
dismiss the case. According to Amber Ander
son, one of The Crimson's attorneys, a
hearing on this motion will probably take
place next month.
Paley said The Crimson's decision to sue was
"the culmination of a series of requests to the
university in the past few years to gain access to
public records."
The lack of open police reports prevented
The Crimson from investigating the Harvard
University Police Department's racial profiling
policies and adequately covering the embezzle
ment of over $100,000 from a student agency by
two Harvard students, Paley said.
Like other college and university police

forces, HUPD is required by law to make public
a brief report of any major crime that takes place
on campus. Specifics such as the names of vic
tims and suspects and the details of ongoing in
vestigations may be withheld.
In their first legal brief on behalf of The Crim
son, attorneys Anderson and Sarah Wunsch ar
gued that because HUPD is armed and has the
power to detain, question, arrest and investigate
members outside of the Harvard community,
they should be subject to the same public records
laws as any municipal police force.
"These aren't security guards, these are real
police officers," Paley said. "They don't have
power just from Harvard University. ... They
have county and state powers entrusted to them
from the colonel of the state police."
But according to a Crimson press release,
Harvard's brief argues that because the universi
ty is a private institution, its police force is not
subject to stringent public access laws. The press
release said Harvard argued that it has the re
sponsibility of protecting victims within the
small university community.
Joe Wrinn, director of the Harvard Office of
News and Public Affairs, said Harvard would
not comment on any ongoing lawsuit.
Paley said The Crimson is not looking to exploit
victims or receive special treatment.
"The Crimson follows the same normal stan
dards of journalism ethics as most papers. ...
There are laws in Massachusetts that protect vic
tims' rights."
The Crimson approached the ACLU because

it believed it would be "a good partnership,"
Paley said. "For the ACLU, it's important that
this is a liberties issue. These police officers are
not just policing Harvard students. ... They fre
quently do arrest people throughout Cambridge
who are not Harvard students."
Anderson, an attorney with the firm Dechert
LLP, was approached by the ACLU and agreed
to tackle The Crimson's case pro bono.
"Both the ACLU and I felt that the Har
vard University Police Department has a
tremendous amount of power and without the
records being publicly available, there's some
sort of missing check on that power," Ander
son said.
"The Crimson is taking an important stand in
this case that will be applicable to other colleges
and universities," she said. Anderson added that
she knew the issue of public access to police re
ports had been broached at both Boston Uni
versity and Boston College.
Anderson said the fact that Harvard police
officers carry guns makes The Crimson's case
even more compelling. "This brings with it a
type of coercive power that's unique to carrying
firearms," she said.
The Crimson is also receiving support from
Security on Campus, a non-profit organization
dedicated to raising awareness about on-campus
crimes throughout the United States.
"They support us in what we're doing and
they've taken a great interest in the result we're
trying to achieve," Anderson said, adding, "I'm
very optimistic about the outcome."
