## Football drama; pass it on 
### 
Ah, the last weekend of summer. Forget about
all that Labor Day sentimentality — the hard
truth is that summer really ended this week
end. Proof lay not only in Sunday's autumnal
equinox, though the scientific amongst you might be
content with that fact and that fact alone.

No, the real reason, the irrefutable evidence lay not in

the celestial calendar but the academic
one — as classes begin in a mere two
days.
Thankfully, the fates aligned to bring
us some great college football games
this weekend. Though summer is gone,
sports will remain.
Warm nights, barbeques and pool
parties may give way to the gridiron, the
two-point conversion and the upset.
The important fact?
Entertainment and drama, as al
ways, remain.

Where to begin? With the Thundering Herd's huge
upset of No. 6 Kansas State? With Toledo knocking off
No. 11 Pittsburgh? With Rashaun Woods' seven touch
down catches for Oklahoma State? With the hometown
Cardinal's (surprising) win over BYU in Provo? (Sweet
mother of mercy ... we have two wins already?)
Perhaps we should really begin the weekend wrap-up
with the one-man circus that has become Maurice
Clarett.
Following his suspension from Ohio State and the al
leged claim that he exaggerated a police report in which
he said that tens of thousands of dollars were stolen in
stereo goods and cash from his "borrowed" car, Clarett
is now considering filing a reverse complaint against uni
versity officials and campus police.
Ohio State's Athletic Director attempted to stem the
burgeoning soap opera by saying that the complaint
would have no effect on Clarett's reinstatement.
Oh, and lest we forget, Clarett's attorney is seeking to
meet with NFL officials to plead his case for early accep
tance into the draft.
Talk about drama.
Yet for almost an entire day it was (thankfully) on the
backburner, as actual on-field events pre-empted the
drama queen.
Let's start that examination with our own Cardinal —
now an amazing 2-0 after squeaking out a win against the
Cougars in Provo.
The good news?
This year's team already has the equal total number
of wins from last season. The running game looked
solid. The secondary, historically a weak spot, made
some great plays and looked good in man-coverage,
which will be necessary against the Pacific 10 Confer
ence air attack.
The defense came up huge with a fourth quarter
turnover (to set up the final touchdown) and a stop (to
seal the win).
Now for the bad news. We managed 53 yards passing
for the game. Luke Powell, a wide receiver, passed for
more yards than our quarterback.
It was only the odd combination of intense defense, a
great game from junior running back Kenneth Tolon
and the gift of five turnovers from BYU that made the
victory possible.
While a win is a win, clearly the "fun and gun" needs
