A group of protesters gathered in
White Plaza during New Student Orientation
on Thursday, waving signs such as "Stanford:
Where the fun goes to die" - and were forced
to disband after University officials ordered
them to leave. The students later dismissed
the protest as a practical joke; a University of
ficial said it was in "very poor taste."
Protesters said they had initially
gathered at the intersection of Campus Drive
and Escondido when campus police asked
them to relocate. Once they had moved to
White Plaze, however, they were approached
by Orientation Director Jared Scherer, who
asked them to disband.
According to Scherer, White Plaza
had been reserved that day for Orientation ac
tivities and the students were asked to leave
because they were disrupting planned activi
ties.
"There is a time, place and manner
for all types of demonstrations and activities
such as this," Scherer said. "The first day of
New Student Orientation at Stanford in
White Plaza is certainly not one of them."
Protestors said the signs were a prac
tical joke and that the administration's actions
violated the students' right to free speech, ac
cording to an e-mail from a participant to The
Stanford Daily.
"As should be obvious to anyone
who would even approach the mental capaci
ty of a Stanford freshman, we were joking,"
wrote the student. "The regrettable lack of a
sense of humor displayed by various Universi
ty officials and volunteers is, frankly, shock
ing, appalling... and downright ugly."
The student, who referred to Orien
tation organizers' actions as "tyranny," also
wrote, "Instead of treating its students like
adults, the Stanford administration has cho
sen to choke off any expressions of liberty,
personal will or sense of humor."
Later, he denied having sent the e
mail and declined to comment on the incident,
as did several other participants.
One student said an agreement had
been reached between the protesters and ad
ministration to drop the issue entirely'. Ac
cording to the students involved, no further
disciplinary action has been taken against
them.
