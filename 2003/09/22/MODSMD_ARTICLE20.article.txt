# Two and Ohhh!
## Stanford win leaves plenty to celebrate 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
PROVO, Utah —Trent Edwards won his first
collegiate start, but not in the manner he had ex
pected.
The redshirt freshman quarterback, who strug
gled all night to throw the ball against an unortho
dox Brigham Young defense, turned a naked
bootleg into a go-ahead touchdown with 3:51 re
maining in the game.
Stanford's defense made a last minute stop as
the Cardinal (2-0) matched last year's win total
with a thrilling but ugly 18-14 road victory.
"It was festive inside the locker room," said
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens. "It's a nice
step for us, but we can play better, play harder,
play longer."
Junior running back Kenneth Tolon rushed for
a career-high 141 yards on a career-high 32 carries,
helping Edwards become Stanford's first fresh
man quarterback to win his debut since Steve
Stenstrom did so in 1991.
But it wasn't easy or even pretty, for that
matter.
Luke Powell, who bobbled a few earlier punts,

had a 68-yard punt return to set up Michael Sgroi's
second field goal that cut Stanford's deficit to 14-
12 with 8:50 left in the game.
The Cardinal, however, had to punt on its next
two possessions, and with 4:21 remaining, BYU
got the ball back, aiming to run down the clock.
But on the first snap of the drive, Cougars
freshman quarterback John Beck — only the sec
ond true freshman ever to start for BYU — made
a rookie mistake.
He threw back across the field. His pass was
tipped by Stanford linebacker David Bergeron
and eventually landed in the hands of Cardinal
free safety Oshimogho Atogwe for a game-chang
ing interception.
Stanford took over at the Cougar 25-yard line,
and after two Tolon runs for a first down, Edwards
went to work with his feet.
He faked a handoff to Tolon left, then darted
out right and pranced into the end zone untouched
for a 14-yard touchdown capitalizing on the same
play that helped set up Stanford's first touchdown
(a 4-yard run by Tolon in the first quarter).
"We knew that their ends crashed hard inside,
so that was in the game plan," Edwards said. "I felt
like I was moving in slow motion."
BYU would eventually drive down the field
quickly in the next three minutes before Stan
ford's defense stopped the drive inside its own 10-
