# Two and Ohhh!
## Stanford win leaves plenty to celebrate 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
PROVO, Utah —Trent Edwards won his first
collegiate start, but not in the manner he had ex
pected.
The redshirt freshman quarterback, who strug
gled all night to throw the ball against an unortho
dox Brigham Young defense, turned a naked
bootleg into a go-ahead touchdown with 3:51 re
maining in the game.
Stanford's defense made a last minute stop as
the Cardinal (2-0) matched last year's win total
with a thrilling but ugly 18-14 road victory.
"It was festive inside the locker room," said
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens. "It's a nice
step for us, but we can play better, play harder,
play longer."
Junior running back Kenneth Tolon rushed for
a career-high 141 yards on a career-high 32 carries,
helping Edwards become Stanford's first fresh
man quarterback to win his debut since Steve
Stenstrom did so in 1991.
But it wasn't easy or even pretty, for that
matter.
Luke Powell, who bobbled a few earlier punts,

had a 68-yard punt return to set up Michael Sgroi's
second field goal that cut Stanford's deficit to 14-
12 with 8:50 left in the game.
The Cardinal, however, had to punt on its next
two possessions, and with 4:21 remaining, BYU
got the ball back, aiming to run down the clock.
But on the first snap of the drive, Cougars
freshman quarterback John Beck — only the sec
ond true freshman ever to start for BYU — made
a rookie mistake.
He threw back across the field. His pass was
tipped by Stanford linebacker David Bergeron
and eventually landed in the hands of Cardinal
free safety Oshimogho Atogwe for a game-chang
ing interception.
Stanford took over at the Cougar 25-yard line,
and after two Tolon runs for a first down, Edwards
went to work with his feet.
He faked a handoff to Tolon left, then darted
out right and pranced into the end zone untouched
for a 14-yard touchdown capitalizing on the same
play that helped set up Stanford's first touchdown
(a 4-yard run by Tolon in the first quarter).
"We knew that their ends crashed hard inside,
so that was in the game plan," Edwards said. "I felt
like I was moving in slow motion."
BYU would eventually drive down the field
quickly in the next three minutes before Stan
ford's defense stopped the drive inside its own 10-

yard line with under a minute to go.
For Kirk Chambers and Coop
er Blackhurst, two Provo natives,
the victory was a nice homecom
ing gift.

On the other side of the coin Sat
urday was a night Edwards will try
soon to forget.
He completed only 10-of-23
passes for 25 yards, threw two inter
ceptions and will be remembered -
for now at least —as the signal
caller who led Stanford to its lowest
number of yards passing (56) in
school history.
In fact, senior wide receiver
Luke Powell was Stanford's lead
ing passer in Provo after complet
ing a 31-yard pass to freshman cor
ner Mark Bradford on a trick play
in the third quarter.

Much of the credit for Edwards'
lowly performance, however, should
be given to the Cougars' defense.
BYU ran a 3-3-5 alignment that con
sistently shifted the positioning of its
defensive backs in an effort to dis
guise coverage and pressure
schemes.

And it worked to perfection
against a young Cardinal offensive
line, which at times was playing
three redshirt freshmen and one
sophomore.

"[Sometimes], we didn't know
where the pressure was coming
from," admitted tackle Kirk Cham
bers, the only senior in the group.

Edwards seemed to be at a loss to
explain his troubles.
"I tried to prepare all week by
watching film," he said. "But I've
never really played against a de
fense like that before, and I was get
ting rattled."
Despite Edwards' troubles,
Teevens never considered going to
reserve quarterback Chris Lewis.
The Stanford senior was never seen
warming up on the sideline.
And though there were probably
many fans in Palo Alto clamoring
for the former starting quarterback
to come off the bench — just as he
has done successfully in the past —
Teevens said that most of the prob
lems weren't Edwards' fault.
"Trent did what we asked him to
do," Teevens explained. "BYU is a
tough team to throw against.
"They harass you, they come
from every which way and then they
cover well. We knew it would be one

of those games," he said.
Nobody in Provo seemed to be
lieve the Cardinal, a six-and-a-half
point underdog, had any business
playing the Cougars.
The afternoon of the game, one
talk-show radio host even chal
lenged his listeners to decide
whether BYU would beat Stanford
in the air or on the ground.
Some of the local players might
have bought into that kind of
thinking and overlooked a team
considered by many to be at the
lower-end of the Pacific 10 Con
ference spectrum.
"I felt like I was getting a little
cocky, like we were doing well," said
BYU tight end Daniel Coats. "This
loss was good for us. [Now] we know
we're not as good as we think we
are."

Stanford knows its offense has
got a lot of changes to make if it's
going to be competitive in Pac-10
play.

But despite its offensive woes —
including going only 2-for-16 on 3rd
downs — the Cardinal was some
how able to escape Provo with a vic
tory.

"Bottom line, we did what we
had to do to win," Powell said. "It
was ugly, but it was a win."
