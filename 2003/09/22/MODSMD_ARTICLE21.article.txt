# Strong Cardinal defensive effort leads football to victory
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
PROVO, Utah — Stanford's defense provided a goal
line stand for the ages that capped off an incredible defen
sive performance.
With Brigham Young reaching the Cardinal's eight
yard line with 1:03 remaining in the game and Stanford
leading by four points, the outcome hung in the balance.
The Cougars had driven 70 yards in just over two min
utes — helped by two Stanford pass interference penalties
— and it seemed like BYU was going to pull off another
comeback reminiscent of years past under the likes of Jim
McMahon and Steve Young.
But the Stanford defense dug in its collective feet and
won the game.
The final four plays embodied the strong statement
made in Utah by a Stanford defensive unit that was so vili
fied last season by Palo Altans.
On first down, BYU quarterback John Beck dropped
back to when Cardinal linebacker Jon
Alston came steaming around the
outside untouched. Beck was sacked
for a 10-yard loss, forcing the Cougars
to take a timeout with 39 seconds re
maining.
Alston had been in and out of the
game all night long, entering on a for
mation called X-Backer where he re
places one of the defensive ends and
lines up outside an offensive tackle.
But he hadn't blitzed all posses
sion. Until that down.

"I didn't do anything special," said
Alston, who recorded two sacks in the
game. "I just came off the edge.
"Maybe the tackle didn't see me.
They didn't seem like they were ready
for it," he said.
On second down, Beck lofted a
pass to Chris Hale in the corner of the
end zone that was knocked away by
free safety Oshimogho Atogwe at the
last second.

Atogwe led the Cardinal with
seven tackles, four passes deflected
and two interceptions — including
the one that set up the game-winning
touchdown run by Trent Edwards.

Then, on third down, Beck threw a
little dump-off pass to Cougars run
ning back Marcus Whalen for no gain.
That meant the Cougars sat on
Stanford's 18 yard-line and goal-to-go.
BYU was out of time-outs, so it
had a quick huddle and snapped the
ball.

But Beck didn't even get off a pass.
Junior linebacker Jared Newberry
immediately rushed into the backfield
and leveled the quarterback for yet
another sack.
Turnover. Game over.
And Stanford starts 2-0 for only
the fifth time in 31 years.
"That's the type of stuff you live
for, you dream for," Atogwe said.
" You are on the field, end of the game
and you've got to stop them to win."

All told, the Cardinal defense had
five sacks for 47 yards and battered
and bruised BYU's quarterback a
countless number of times.

"We kept Beck on his back foot so
he couldn't deliver the ball like we saw
him do on film," Atogwe said. "We
were hitting him, knocking him down
and by the fourth quarter it took its
toll."

Stanford's run defense was even
more eye-opening. The Cardinal lim
ited Cougars running back Rey
Brathwaite to only 29 yards, a week
after he racked up a career-high 169

against New Mexico. In sum, Stanford
held BYU to negative five yards rush
ing— the fourth lowest total for a
Cardinal opponent in school history
— and now boasts the nation's lead
ing run defense.
Stanford did give up 310 yards
through the air, but it took Beck 46 at
tempts and a whole lot more labor to
get there.
So, you might be thinking, how
was all that possible from a team that
last season allowed 34.3 points and
384.7 yards per game — both worsts
in the Pacific 10 Conference — and
had only 24 sacks?
"Our guys came off with a lot of
fire and found some openings and
made some plays," Teevens said.
Added Atogwe: "We knew that if
we kept bringing pressure, all it took
was one offensive lineman to make a
mistake and the sack would be there."

It also helps that they've played
two teams that can't really run the
ball. Washington won't do much run
ning either next week, so the leading
run defense total might hold up for
even another game.
Stanford is widely regarded for de
veloping productive offensive skill
players like John Elway, Jim Plunkett,
Tommy Vardell and Troy Walters.
But for at least one week, Stan
ford's defense gets bragging rights.
