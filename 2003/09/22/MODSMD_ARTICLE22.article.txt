# Men back from road trip
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
For the past week, freshmen have been
arriving on campus and experiencing awe
at the beauty of the university that they
chose, and upperclassmen have been ar
riving and breathing sighs of relief at the
idea that they are back home where they
belong.
But no one in the Stanford community
has been longing for the sight of the Farm
quite like the Cardinal men's soccer
team.
Last weekend the squad wrapped up a
grueling, six-game, nine-day road trip that
pitted the still-developing team against
many of the nation's best.
The unranked Cardinal (1-4-1) traveled
to Tulsa, Okla. on Thursday for a face-off
with No. 20 Tulsa (6-1-0), a game that Stan
ford coach Bret Simon said brought out an
intense level of heart in his players.
"It was a very hard-fought, emotional
game for us," Simon said.
Despite the fierce play of the Cardinal
booters, the Hurricanes topped Stanford 2-0.
Tulsa got onto the board in the first half,
when junior Kyle Brown played the ball to
sophomore Ryan Pore, who was able to fire
a shot past Stanford goalkeeper, freshman
Andrew Kartunen, from a few yards out.
The second half gave Tulsa another scor
ing opportunity, when senior Bryan Rudd
broke through the Cardinal defense in time
to get a pass to Pore. Pore found Brown,
who launched a 10-yard shot into the net.
Kartunen, who started as a result of ju
nior Robby Fulton's quad injury, man
aged to keep the Hurricanes from causing
more damage, recording five saves on the
night, despite receiving his second loss of
the season.

Stanford attempted eights shots, three of
which were courtesy of junior forward Matt
Janusz, but none could break Tulsa goal
keeper Terry Boss, whose record now
stands at 6-1.
The loss dropped Stanford to 1-4 on the
season, the team's worst start since 1980.
"There's obviously some frustration
here," said team captain and senior Abe
Geiger. "We expect to win every game that
we play. But we know that our season isn't
doomed. We want to turn things around."
And that's exactly what the Cardinal did.
Despite the mental and physical ex
haustion that the team experienced after
the Tulsa game, Friday's daunting
matchup with No. 8 Southern Methodist
(5-1-1) showcased a familiarly powerful
Stanford squad.
The double-overtime game ended in a 0-
0 tie, bringing the Cardinal's losing streak
and SMU's winning streak to a halt.
The Mustangs took shots on frame from
all over the field, but nothing that Kartunen
couldn't handle. The freshman posted a ca
reer-high 14 saves.
Though starting at goalkeeper so early in
his career is a huge task, Kartunen said that
he was able to relax and stay confident
throughout the tournament.
"It just felt like any regular game to me,"
he said.
Kartunen's confidence and skill paid off
when he was named to the All-Tournament
team.
Sophomore Chad Marshall — who fired
off three of Stanford's seven attempts
against SMU — was also named to the All-
Tournament team.
Despite the fact that the squad did not
walk away from the tournament with a sin
