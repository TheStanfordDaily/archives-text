Opening Pacific 10 Conference play in Oregon
against the two lowest-ranked teams in the conference
is much harder than it sounds.
The Pac-10 surpassed all other conferences in the
USA Today/AVCA Coaches Top-25 Preseason Poll,
with six teams making the chart.
Noting that, the Cardinal women's volleyball squad
(8-2, 2-0 Pac-10) can't afford to take any conference
match-up lightly.
The Ducks and Beavers proved why, as they both
forced Stanford to battle for its 2-0 conference record
last weekend.
Entering the season, the Cardinal was picked to fin
ish second in the Pac-10, behind USC, while Arizona
and UCLA were ranked in a tie for third, followed by
California, Washington, Arizona State, Washington
State, Oregon State and Oregon.
"Our coaches preach that the Pac-10 is a very
strong conference and you can't go into any game
thinking that you can simply go through the motions,"
said sophomore setter Katie Goldhahn.
"But the plus side is that you have the ability to
improve every game you play. We can't get by with
out working hard throughout the entire season,"
she said.
The Cardinal first traveled to Corvallis, where it
faced Oregon State on Thursday night. Entering the
match, the Beavers were on a three game winning
streak, but faced an imposing 0-36 all-time record
against the Cardinal.
The Beavers showed tenacity as they took an early
lead in game one. The Cardinal fought back, bringing
the game to a 27r27 tie before senior middle blocker
Sara McGee sealed the game for Stanford with two
key kills.
The second game was an equally tight battle as the
