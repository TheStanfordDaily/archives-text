# Women win 2 in Oregon
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Opening Pacific 10 Conference play in Oregon
against the two lowest-ranked teams in the conference
is much harder than it sounds.
The Pac-10 surpassed all other conferences in the
USA Today/AVCA Coaches Top-25 Preseason Poll,
with six teams making the chart.
Noting that, the Cardinal women's volleyball squad
(8-2, 2-0 Pac-10) can't afford to take any conference
match-up lightly.
The Ducks and Beavers proved why, as they both
forced Stanford to battle for its 2-0 conference record
last weekend.
Entering the season, the Cardinal was picked to fin
ish second in the Pac-10, behind USC, while Arizona
and UCLA were ranked in a tie for third, followed by
California, Washington, Arizona State, Washington
State, Oregon State and Oregon.
"Our coaches preach that the Pac-10 is a very
strong conference and you can't go into any game
thinking that you can simply go through the motions,"
said sophomore setter Katie Goldhahn.
"But the plus side is that you have the ability to
improve every game you play. We can't get by with
out working hard throughout the entire season,"
she said.
The Cardinal first traveled to Corvallis, where it
faced Oregon State on Thursday night. Entering the
match, the Beavers were on a three game winning
streak, but faced an imposing 0-36 all-time record
against the Cardinal.
The Beavers showed tenacity as they took an early
lead in game one. The Cardinal fought back, bringing
the game to a 27r27 tie before senior middle blocker
Sara McGee sealed the game for Stanford with two
key kills.
The second game was an equally tight battle as the

against Oregon State.
teams traded the lead throughout.
The Beavers, however, prevailed,
with a 30-27 win to tie the match at
one game apiece.
The Cardinal turned the match
around in game three as it went up
on the scoreboard first and this
time managed to keep the lead for
a 30-22 victory.
The Beavers refused to give up,
hanging on early in game four be
fore watching the Cardinal take a
I late run to win the game and the
match, 30-19.
As she's done in nearly all of the
Cardinal's matches this year, junior
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani
lead the team with a match-high 22
kills, followed by freshman Kristin
Richards and seniors Jennifer Har
vey and Sarah Dukes, with 18, 14
and 12 kills, respectively.
On the defensive end, senior
Leahi Hall set her career-high with
17 digs at the librero position while
Harvey showed her power at the
net, leading the match with nine
blocks.
Stanford then moved on to Eu
gene, where it faced Oregon (3-7,0-
2 Pac-10) on Friday night.
Entering the match, the Ducks
had a gloomy 36-2 all-time record
against Stanford, and hadn't
topped Stanford in the past 13
years.
Behind double-doubles from
Nnamani (19 kills, 12 digs) and
Richard (14, 10) and the setting of
Goldhahn, (49 assists), Stanford
moved to 2-0 in league with a 3-0
victory over the Ducks.
However, just as in Corvallis,
nothing was handed to the Cardinal
as it was forced to fight the Ducks
to the wire in all three games.
In game one, the Ducks tied
Stanford at 21 before the Cardinal
went on a run to take the game by
six on a block by McGee.
Game two proved the most ex
citing of the matches as it saw nu
merous lead changes and game -
points for both teams.
Tied at 24, the Ducks tried to
break away from the Cardinal as it
took a slight, but significant 25-27
lead and then pushed forward to a
game point at 27-29.
Stanford, however, would not
back down and thwarted two game
points to bring the teams even
again at 29. The seesaw battle con
tinued until the Cardinal was final
ly able to break away with a 33-31
victory on a Nnamani kill.
Appearing ready to leave Ore
gon, Stanford came out strong in
game three and cruised to its easiest
victory of the match with a 30-19
** win.
"Its not that we came into these
two matches thinking that [Oregon
and Oregon State] weren't going to
be good," Goldhahn said. "We're
aware of the strength of the Pac-10
and they both played really well.
"Oregon State dug a lot of balls
and were really scrappy throughout
the match and Oregon was very
verbal and intense. These matches
were great because we really came
together and focused, which allows
us to continue to learn and im
prove," she said.
The Cardinal opens its confer
ence home schedule this weekend,
when it faces Washington State on
Friday and No. 14 Washington on
Saturday. Both games are set for 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
