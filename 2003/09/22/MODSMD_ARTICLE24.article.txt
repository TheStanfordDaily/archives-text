# Cardinal struggles to score in tournament
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 24 Stanford women's
soccer team (3-3-1) battled intense
heat, the number two team in the
nation and a feisty squad from
Georgia at this weekend's Santa
Clara/Adidas Classic, but an in
ability to execute left the team with
just a tie and a loss.
On Friday, the Cardinal fought
hard through two overtime periods
against No. 2 Notre Dame (7-0-1)
with neither side able to find the net
in the 0-0 tie.

Junior All-American goalkeep
er Nicole Barnhart saved the day
for the Cardinal in the 66th minute.
Barnhart made a diving tip-save
after a chip shot from fourteen
yards out by Fighting Irish senior
forward Amanda Guertin tried to
make its way toward the net.
"Nicole Barnhart was absolutely
tremendous for us," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "She played a
big part in keeping us in [the
match]."
Despite strong defensive play,
the Cardinal could not create offen
sive opportunities. It finished the
match with just two shots on goal,
one by sophomore midfielder Jen
nifer Farenbaugh and the other by
senior tri-captain Ally Marquand.
Farenbaugh was the Cardinal's
lone offensive spark in the two
matches in Santa Clara, notching a
total of seven shots, four of which
were on goal. The rest of the Car
dinal squad was able to get off only
five shots on goal in the two

matches.
"I wish I could say that I can see
someone stepping up [in the near
future]," Ratcliffe said. "But it's
been a problem all season. It's
mostly been our midfielders creat
ing scoring opportunities. We're
going to need the forwards to start
creating more."
Other than Guertin's near
score, the second half was essential
ly a defensive stalemate. The Cardi
nal managed only one shot, while
the Fighting Irish controlled pos
session slightly better and managed
four shots.
Heading into the first overtime,
the fatigue was evident as neither
team could even manage to get a
shot off, leading to a second and
final overtime. However, more of
the same play was evident. Each
team managed one shot in the final
ten minutes, but both shots were off
target.
The match reached the 110
minute mark with no score and
ended in a tie.
"The girls played hard [the en
tire game]," Ratcliffe said. "Notre
Dame is a very highly ranked team
for a reason. They were very
tough."
In addition to not picking up a
win, Stanford suffered yet another
setback due to injury.

Freshman forward Shari Sum
mers was forced to leave in the first
half after a knee injury. Preliminary
examinations point to a torn ACL;
an MRI will be performed either
today or Tuesday for confirmation.
Just two days after the Cardi

nal's marathon match against the
Fighting Irish, the team squared off
against Georgia (5-3-0), which had
just come off a blowout loss to No.
10 Santa Clara (3-2-3).
The Bulldogs bounced back
strongly against a tired Cardinal
team and managed to pull off a 1-0
victory over Stanford.
Georgia scored late in the game
on a header by reigning SEC Offen
sive Player of the Week senior Jessi
ca Winton. Winton's goal was assist
ed by senior midfielder Ashley King.
"I have to give Georgia a lot of
credit," Ratcliffe said. "We were
definitely tired after playing dou
ble overtime against Notre Dame
and we have limited subs because
of injury, but [the Bulldogs] did
play well."
The Cardinal outshot Georgia
15-7, with a 7-5 shot on goal advan
tage, but was unable to execute
when it came time to finish.

Stanford best scoring chance
came in the 65th minute on a shot
by junior midfielder Amy Grady.
Grady's shot was slightly off-target,
hitting the crossbar. The ball rico
cheted off the crossbar to Mar
quand, whose header went into the
hands of junior Georgia goalkeeper
Ashley Lindley.
Marquand finished the match
with five shots, three on goal.
Playing catch-up after Winton's
goal, the Cardinal managed two
more shots in the final 18 minutes,
but Stanford was unable to convert.
"What it comes down to is that
we need to find ways to score," Rat
cliffe said.
