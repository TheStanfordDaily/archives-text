# Carshare gives students a lift

### ILENAC. GEORGE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford students who do not have cars but want to get off
campus to run errands or see a movie now have an alternative
to borrowing friends' keys.
City CarShare - a non-profit organization that provides its
members access to cars on a reservation basis - began offering
its services at Stanford last Monday.
Two hybrid Honda Civics are now available for members' use.
There is one in the Tresidder parking lot and one in the Serra
St. parking lot.
Some students were enthusiastic about the prospect of hav
ing a car available for sporadic use.
"I'd be interested [in becoming a member] because, while
you might not need a car all the time, you'll have a car ready for
you when you need it," said sophomore Dimitris Economou.
The organization operates like a car rental service, with
some variations: members reserve the vehicles through the
Web site or over the phone and are charged a per-hour rate (ei
ther $4 dollars for peak hours -10 am to 10 pm -or $2 off
peak) and a $0.44 per mile usage fee. There is also a monthly
$10 dollar administrative fee. The vehicle usage fee includes
both gas and insurance.
The organization charges hefty fines for certain misde
meanors, including the late return of a car or "inconveniencing
other members." It likewise gives credit or reimbursements to
members who have to fill up the gas tank or make repairs.
City CarShare began in March of2001 and expanded quick
ly, extending its service from San Francisco to Oakland and
Berkeley within a few months. The company states that its mis
sion is "to promote car-sharing as a means to reduce automo
bile dependence and enhance the environmental and social in
tegrity of our neighborhoods and planet."
The founders were inspired by a similar organization in
Germany called Stattauto or "instead of cars." City CarShare's
Web site claims that car-sharing is hugely popular in Europe,
with tens of thousands of people participating.
Points of departure - where the cars can be found - exist
throughout San Francisco, with additional sites in Berkeley,
Oakland, Palo Alto and Mountain View. Service extends to
two other universities - UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley.
While it may be beneficial for some students to have this
service on campus, others feel they probably will not need it.
"I wouldn't use it enough to make it worth the monthly

fee," said sophomore Jessica Daniel.
"It wouldn't be worth it for me. But if
I was living in the city, it might be an
option because I would need a car
more. I think it's a good idea, I think
it's environmentally sound."
"I have friends who have cars so
there's no need for me to rent one,"
she added.

To become a member, students, staff
and faculty can fill out an online form
at www.citycarshare.org. Require
ments include passing a driver's li
cense check, finding a cosigner (who
will be responsible if the member
does not pay his balance) and paying
a $30 deposit. City CarShare waived
its $300 deposit requirement and ex
empted Stanford from its require
ment that members be at least 21
years old. Members under 21 need to
complete a driving safety course to be
held on campus. The cars are avail
able 24 hours a day.
