# ASSU offers 'Absolute Fun'
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Forget vodka.
The ASSU announced last week that it
will be receiving $50,000 a year for the
next three years from the University to
plan social events and student life activi
ties as part of a new program called "Ab
solute Fun."
Last year, the ASSU decided that one
of the biggest problems among students
was that there was not enough to do
around campus, especially events that
with alcohol. ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa and Vice President Joey Natoli
decided to tackle the issue this summer by
writing a 17-page report which details
concerns of the administration and stu
dents, as well as possible solutions.
"We collaborated with many people
who are involved in student life," said
Figueroa.
The report was given to the adminis

tration as well.
"We felt that the ASSU had done an
excellent job of surveying students and
determining what they most wanted to
see in the way of entertainment and fun
programs and activities," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awaku
ni. "We agree with the ASSU that campus
life needs an infusion of new activities.
I'm hoping that the programs and events
will begin to develop some new campus
traditions and annual events."
Some of the ideas that will be imple
mented this fall quarter are a comedy
night, a Greek Night at the Coffee House,
a couple of movie screenings in the Oval
or on Roble Field, a karaoke night, a mid
night ice cream social and a block party in
White Plaza.
"The idea for the Block Party actually
first came from Jane Camarillo, the dean
of residential education," Figueroa said.
"She said that the White Plaza area would
be ideal for an outdoor party venue.
We then talked to the police who
said that the area is removed from
residential areas and with the prop
er measures could easily work."
The rocky relationship between
students and the Stanford Police
Department was also addressed in
the report, which stated that stu
dents perceive that the presence
and aggression of police has in
creased in the past two years. Assis
tant Dean and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe said that ac
tive measures are being taken to
improve communication between
those planning social events and
law enforcement officers.

"We are planning to distribute
free wristbands to party planners to
curb underage drinking," she said.

"We're also planning to have stu
dents ride along in police cars
which are on patrol so that they can
see things from the perspective of
the police, [such as] what sort of be
havior is cause for police concern."
The social programming that is
sponsored and funded by the
ASSU aims to increase and diversi
fy the types of activities that are
available to students, in hopes of of
fering entertainment that is not just
centered around alcohol.

Alcohol and Drug Abuse Pre
vention Manager Ralph Castro ap
plauded the administration and the
ASSU for setting aside University
funds for improving student life.
"I hope that by adding fun and
exciting events and activities on
campus students will feel more em
powered to attend and participate
and thus counter the 'default' of
drinking because of a perceived
lack of fun, student-oriented alter
natives," he said.

Joey Natoli also noted that the new
events could take the burden off of
campus organizations that are typi
cally relied on for coordinating so
cial events.

"Currently on weekends, the
frats are the only places for stu
dents to party and socialize," he
said. "Hopefully the ASSU will
take some of that pressure off of
them by offering other options."
The money will also go towards
improving services and facilities
that students commonly use, such
as more golf carts for 5-SURE and
improvements in the Tresidder Fit
ness Center.

"We are going to purchase more
elliptical machines, which are in
high demand, and also put some
televisions in the Tresidder [Fitness
Center] to address complaints that
have come up in our conversations
with students," Natoli said.
