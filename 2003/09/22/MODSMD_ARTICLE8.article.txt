## Ouch! The bugs that byte 
### 
As of late last night, the odds of this newspaper
hitting our stands today were slim to none —
and it was neither because we were waiting for
a breaking story, nor because we didn't have
enough copy to fill our pages.
The culprit behind this potential travesty was none
other than a dreaded computer virus, much like the cam-

pus-wide problem (see story, front page)
that has plagued Stanford all summer
and still hasn't let go its vicious grip.
The following column is a lesson for
anyone who has ever relied on technolo
gy to save you at the last minute. For in
stance, many of you may have tried to
submit an Arthurian Literature re
sponse paper 5 minutes before the dead
line and needed to save you work on the

home folder so that it could be retrieved
in the dorm computer cluster. Others
may have e-mailed that final paper to

your TA with second counting down before the deadline.
One click and you're safe — right?
Not so. Sometimes technology can go horrribly, horri
bly wrong. And it's much worse than anything you would
have seen on "T3: The Rise of the Machines."
The consequences are as ugly as Cher, had she never
received the benefits of plastic surgery.
But, alas, I digress.
For those of you who have never set foot inside the of
fice of The Stanford Daily, let me set it up for you. Picture
a room that is a pure mess of papers, soda cans and left
over Chinese food — a janitor's nightmare (in fact, we
haven't seen a janitor in weeks) — but just before you get
frightened away, a bright, shining halo beckons you: a cir
cle of little iMac computers.
"Love the Macs."
"Love us."
"Love us."
"You must love us."
"Please love us."
(It must be through such cleverly-programmed sub
liminal messages that the company suckers people into
buying their products.)
No matter how chaotic the surrounding office area be
comes, so long as the computers maintain their healthy
glow and steady upbeat hum, no task ever seems too
daunting. So long as they print, save and store our infor
mation — we're golden.
However, when this circle of trust is broken the entire
operation starts spinning out of control, and every aspect
of our Daily existence falls apart.
As people were scrambling to finish the orientation
issue last week, the server shut down, a virus attacked and
incompatible versions of Quark (the layout program used
by The Daily) competed for dominance on the computer
screen, while we watched like innocent, little school girls
trapped on the 10th floor of a burning building.
And this all happened at 5 a.m. — when most of us
should have been tucked in bed, getting our beauty rest to
welcome the freshmen with the cheeriest of faces. (OK,
maybe not: After all, we're not RAs or Orientation volun
teers.)
Upon this near meltdown, reaction around the office
varied slightly.
"Damn."
"What?"
"Damn."
"What's going on?"
"Huh."
"What?"
"Where's Ezra!"
"Where, oh WHERE!"
Not only did the issue have to overcome computer ad
versity, but staff morale was affected as well.
Senior Alexander Kendall, health and innovation edi
tor, was one of the victims burned by the virus.
"I needed to meet with my managing editor, but he
never made it that morning," Kendall said in a moment of
shock. "He later told me he had been up so late because of
the virus that he slept through it, but really, I had been hit
by the virus too — metaphorically, of course."
When asked to comment on the effects of the virus on
the Daily, Editor-in-Chief Ramin Setoodeh said, "Viruses
are bad. Efficiency is good. Uh-oh, the servers are down.
The virus is spreading. Donnie!"
And this morning at 2 a.m., the computer situation took
another turn for the worse. Some of the Daily computers
lost access to e-mail. (Don't worry: They're back up, so
please keep sending us those well-written letters to the ed
itor.) Other server errors popped up like toast in a toaster.
In fact, as of press time, it looked like we needed to drive
the paper to the printer in Redwood City — since we
couldn't send it electronically
"I'm not coming in tomorrow," said our productionist.
"Neither am I," said another member of the staff.
"Count me out," said a third.
They were only kidding — I think.
But the moral of the lesson is this: Viruses can attack at
any moment. Even during I-Hum papers that are cranked
out as the sun rises in your dorm room. Even when spell
check is completed and every last word of your essay is
written. Even when you think all is well, because you're
that "organized" Stanford kid who does all his work a
week early.
Technology can strike.
And it can ruin your life.
In The Daily, the war isn't over yet. The virus is lurking,
latent and ready to strike at any moment. But, as always,
The Daily will persevere ... we hope ...
