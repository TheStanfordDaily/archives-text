## Stanford Daily staff set for another year 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
"A virus has infected our computers!"
"No one called me back — ever."
"Being a news editor is a life-sucking death force."
These are phrases that bounce through the walls of
the Stanford Daily newsroom, located across Roble
Hall in the antiquated Storke Publications Building.
Empty beer bottles are scattered across our floor.
Scribbled proofs cover our desks. And an entire wall is
lined with binders of old issues — starting from 1892,
when the paper was born as the Daily Palo Alto with
headlines like "Navy Man Lectures," "Fruit-Growers
Satisfied" and "Debating Team Chosen."
A name change is just one of many transforma
tions that The Daily has undergone since then. When
top dogs left the paper during World War II to fight
in the war, women staffers took charge as editors-in
chief for the first time. As the campus anti-war move
ment gained speed during the 1960s and 1970s, the
paper began leaning further to the left. Finally, in
1973, it declared itself independent — two years after
taking the Palo Alto Police Department to the
Supreme Court for searching the office for contro
versial photos.
These days, the tradition of thoughtful, incisive, in
dependent coverage continues.
"I want to write about urns," says one editor at a
Sunday meeting.
"I wouldn't read that," says a second.
"We're not writing about urns," says the third.
And thus, another decision is made.
With a printing schedule as constant as the northern
star, to paraphrase Shakespeare, the paper is published
every weekday of the academic quarter with the excep
tion of Dead Week, the time before finals. And student
journalists are here around the clock: writing, editing
planning, producing and pacing.
"In many ways, The Daily is like the Hotel Califor
nia," says sophomore Camille Ricketts, a news editor.
"You can never leave — but, you know, in a good
way."
When asked to comment for this story, sophomore
Whitney Sado — another news editor — had more a

quoteworthy question. "Can't you just make up some
thing for me to say?" she asks. The answer, of course, is
no. This ain't The New York Times, folks.
Here's a brief look at the managers of our paper.
• Senior Ramin Setoodeh, editor in chief, has writ

ten for U.S. News & World Report, Stanford Maga
zine and the uber-popular newspaper The Fresno
Bee. When he is not editing the paper, our fearless
leader watches the TV show "Big Brother" religious
ly — and forces freshmen reporters to join him.
Ramin is also a fan of self-indulgent journalism, like
this article he wrote.
• Senior Vauhini Vara, managing editor of news, re
cently completed an internship at The Wall Street Jour
nal's Paris bureau. She keeps her Daily story ideas in a
private diary in the following manner: "My date just
stood me up! Anyway, we should do a story on Friend
ster."
• Junior Mark Thoma, managing editor of news, has
devoted himself to ending the news-sports blood feud,
having written and edited for both news and sports. His
interests include the Detroit Tigers, dance music and
being Midwestern.
• Senior Arisha Hatch, managing editor of sports, is
the campus correspondent for Sports Illustrated. She
got into sports journalism to see Stanford guys naked in
the locker room. And, boy, does she have some stories
to tell (wink, wink).
• Senior Mark Dominik, managing editor of special
sections, salivates over the editorial spreads of foreign
newspapers — which he read last summer as an intern
at the World Association of Newspapers in Paris. His
editors suffer from haunting dreams in which he forces
them to refer to him as "Lord Dominik."
• Junior Lindsay Coleman, managing editor of pho
tography, spends her non-Daily hours working at a law
office in Palo Alto. (It's nothing like "Ally McBeal.")
She refuses to eat anything that is fried or greasy —
which is why we never see her at the business manager's
KFC buffets.
• Junior Beth Liebert, managing editor of graphics,
has single-handedly saved The Daily on numerous oc
casions with her super Adobe powers. She designs In
termission covers, tempts you with teasers and crops
pictures like nobody's business. Plus, she's an ace pirate
fighter.

Join The Daily! New staffers' training is tomorrow at
7:30 p.m. in the newsroom, across from Roble Hall on
Santa Teresa Avenue.

sections, apologizes for his sloppy attire. "I look terrible," cries the senior — who normally dresses in the most expensive clothes money can buy.

The Stanford Daily has a long and complicated history-too
long, in fact, to fit in such a small space. A behind-the
scenes look: This caption was written by an editor at 2:39
