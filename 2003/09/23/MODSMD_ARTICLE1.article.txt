# Students enrolling abroad shun Europe for alternative options

As Stanford students become increasingly aware
of a world beyond campus, they are going abroad in
greater numbers â€” but not to Europe.
While total enrollment in the Overseas Studies
Program has increased by 16 percent, enrollment in
the Europe programs has dropped by 12 percent this
quarter, over autumn quarter 2002.
Last year, the total enrollment of students in over
seas programs reached its highest point in 10 years,
after Stanford introduced Overseas Seminars, in
which students spend three weeks abroad just before
the school year begins.
Meanwhile, first-quarter enrollment in Europe
has been slowly declining for the past four years, es
pecially this year, led by a sharp drop in enrollment in
the Paris and Florence programs.
Some students and staff members of overseas pro
grams in Europe say the decline in interest there
could be related to the weakness of the dollar in rela
tion to the euro and the political tension between the
United States and some European countries with re
gard to the war in Iraq.
Junior Dan Fink, who will study this autumn in
Paris, speculated that the lower enrollment could be
due to "poor relations" between France and the Unit
ed States.
"But I have already talked to my host family, and
they're extremely welcoming," he added.
While enrollment in the Paris program has
dropped to 37 students this quarter from 47 in autumn
quarter of last year, enrollment in the Berlin program
has in fact slightly increased, to 18 students from 16.
That indicates that the shift in interest is probably
more related to the wider variety of options available
in recent years, said Susan Christopher, academic
program officer at OSP.
Stanford introduced the summer seminars last
year and a new program in Australia this year.
Junior John Wheaton attended the summer semi
nar at Oxford, where he studied Shakespeare.
"I'm an English minor," he said. "I'm trying to get
all the units for my major completed, so I didn't have
time to go abroad for a quarter. The summer program
offered a great alternative."
The new program in Australia attracted 47 stu
dents this quarter.
"Perhaps it drew students that would've gone
overseas and chosen another location," Christopher
said. "We think it might have also drawn other stu
dents who may not have been able to take advantage
