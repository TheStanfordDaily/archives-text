# C'mon and heckle us, I dare you
## 
### 
A lot of weird things have happened to
me lately. There was the time when I
was boarding a plane with a group of
my friends, causing one of six Hawai
ian Tropics models to exclaim, "I didn't know
there would be so many hot guys on this flight."
There was the time I found myself suspended
2,000 feet in the air, shooting down a zip line at
55 miles per hour, gapping a half-mile wide
ravine, all the while racing a short Asian man to
the other side.

Or there was the time when I first stepped on
the soccer field in Costa Rica, getting 15 minutes

of playing time against a Costa
Rican first-division team, look
ing down at my jersey and see
ing the big block letters spell
out "STANFORD."
You see, this past year, while
you all thought I was busy writ
ing columns, breaking up with
Hot Stuff and winning March
Madness pools (non-monetary,
of course), I was doing the most
incredible thing I've done at
Stanford to date.

I walked on to the Stanford Varsity Soccer
team.
After a myriad of columns about how average
athletes can make extraordinary accomplish
ments, how mediocre swimmers can win a league
title for their high school team and how "Rudy"
is the single greatest sports movie of all time, I de
cided I should do it ah myself.
I consider it my greatest accomplishment, the
fact that I achieved a goal for myself to play at the
highest possible level I could. There is no way to
tell you how important and exciting this has been
for me — it really is a dream. To be able to play
on the team that has been in the Final Four the
past two years after two years on the Farm with a
pair of cleats and a dream is incredible.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to toot my own horn,
but, "Beep Beep!"
So, after two years of watching the games from
behind the opposing team's goal, surrounded by
100 inebriated fraternity guys, excited freshmen,
and the rest of the Back of the Net Club, scream
ing at the goalkeeper about how his scholarship is
on the line if he lets in a goal, how his pants are a
bit too low, and convincing the ball boys to toss
the ball at his groin, I must resign from my post.
And you know what, I was good. I was great. I
took pride in my heckling. I never resorted to
crude jokes, vulgarities or any slurs. I like to think
that my heckling changed the game in favor of
the Cardinal, yelling "Keeper!!!!" as a defender
rushed to head the ball away, or obnoxiously sec
ond guessing the goalkeeper's choice in punching
the ball away instead of catching it or comment
ing on how the keeper's shin guards were drop
ping down his shin.
All of this was just to get in the keeper's head,
just to let him know that I was there, constantly
judging him, constantly smarter than him, con
stantly annoying the piss out of him. It was beau
tiful. It was brilliant. It was European.
Occasionally we'd get too vulgar, leading to
stern warnings from Stanford Event Services
folks and an athletic administrator. Swearing,
sexual innuendo and drunkenness were all
frowned upon. Our defense to the warnings was
that the team faced even worse heckling when on
the road, but in reality, we had no idea. As far as
we knew, the fans at other schools could have
been as vulgar as the Care Bears.
But let me tell you now. The rumors are true.
After returning from a 10-day road trip to Provi
dence and Tulsa, I realize I have absolutely no
right to the best heckler crown.
Nobody at Stanford does.
Not the "LOOK AT ME!!!" cheer, not the
"left, right, left, right" chant, not the cliche "Your
mom called — she says you suck!" yell either.
There is nothing worse than having 100 drunk
frat guys try to simply pronounce your name.
You want to go over to them, 25 yards behind
our bench and physically move their slobbering
mouth to pronounce your name correctly.
You want to smack them, to teach them, to ask
them how they got into college without being
able to read. That's what we were dealing with il
literacy! The Tulsa crowd literally spent five min
utes, without success, trying to pronounce the last
name of sophomore K.C. Coyne ("Coin").
"Hey!! Kohn-nay! Kone? Coney? Cone-ai?
Well, I don't know if that's your name but . . .
ummm... you suck!"
And just like that, they are in your head. Even
though they have proven they are stupid. Even
though they have shown they can't read. Even
though they live in Oklahoma.
You laugh at their stupidity, and as soon as
they see you respond, it's all over. They are in
your head, and everyone knows it.
So my advice for this upcoming weekend of
games: On Friday night and Sunday afternoon,
simply attend, and do what your heart tells you.
If you want to heckle, heckle. If you want to
politely clap, politely clap. But if you want to win
back the title for the Back of the Net Club, you
might just want to forget how to read.

Spencer Porter is a junior who recently walked onto
the men's soccer team as a goalkeeper. There are
two ways to heckle him: Shoot him an e-mail at
porters@stanford.edu or show up at the soccer
game and yell really, really loud.
