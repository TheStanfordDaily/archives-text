## Pac-10 pulls big upset 
### M ARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a wild weekend in the Pacific 10 Conference,
as four teams faced off against foes from the power
house Big Ten Conference. In the marquee matchup,
Oregon (4-0) overcame the odds to spring an upset on
a typically under-prepared Michigan team (3-1),
which lost its fourth straight road opener.
The win, which Oregon coach Mike Bellotti called
the biggest non-conference win of his career, spring
boarded the Ducks from No. 22 to No. 10 in the rank
ings, and dropped the Wolverines from No. 3 to No.
11.
The Ducks' defense, not known for being stingy,
held Michigan's Chris Perry — the nation's leading
rusher coming into the game — to just 26 yards.
Although the Wolverines battled back from a 24-6
second-half deficit, a longtime Achilles' heel — the
kicking game hamstrung Michigan's chances.
Oregon blocked a punt in the fourth quarter and
took it in for its final touchdown. The Wolverines also
managed to miss their only field-goal try and two of
three extra-point attempts. The Ducks also ran back a
punt 61 yards for a score in the second quarter.
Leading the way for Oregon was running back Ter
rence Whitehead (75 yards and a touchdown) and the
quarterback tandem of Kellen Clemens and Jason
Fife, who combined for 252 yards passing and 35 yards
rushing. Fife had a 15-yard touchdown run in the sec
ond quarter.
Capitalizing on Michigan's failure was No. 13 Iowa
(4-0), which dominated Arizona State (2-1), 21-2,
dropping the Sun Devils from the rankings and solid
ifying the Hawkeyes' position atop its conference.
Iowa held the Sun Devils' Andrew Walter to 160
yards passing — the worst performance of his 13-
start career while Nathan Chandler passed for 155
yards and all three of the Hawkeyes' touchdowns.
Iowa running back Fred Russell did most of the
dirty work, though, running up 154 yards rushing on
27 carries.
In other Pac-10 / Big Ten plays, California (2-3)
upset Illinois (1-3) on the road, while No. 22 Purdue
(2-1) showed no mercy on John Mackovic's hapless,
helpless Arizona squad (1-3).
The Fighting Ilhni mounted a furious rally in the
fourth quarter after falling two touchdowns behind in
the first half. But Illini quarterback Jon Beutjer was
sacked on the final play of the game as his team, hav
ing recovered an onside kick with less than two min
utes remaining, stood only four yards from Cal's end
zone.
Leading the way in Cal's 31-24 victory was junior
college transfer Aaron Rodgers, who totaled 263
yards passing. Beutjer racked up 427 yards for Illinois,
but had no ground game to support him.
Purdue had been favored to beat Arizona by 27
points, but it ended up thrashing the Wildcats by al
most twice that margin, 59-7. Arizona has now been
outscored 166-30 in its three games against major con
ference opponents.
The Wildcats trotted out three quarterbacks, who
completed a combined 13-of-31 passes for 112 yards.
The ground game was typically nonexistent, as
Clarence Farmer rushed 12 times for 15 yards.
The Boilermakers cleared their bench in the win,
and the backups fared well, as the team racked up a
perfectly balanced 289 yards passing and 289 yards
rushing.
UCLA (1-2) didn't fare much better as it took on
top-ranked Oklahoma (4-0) in Norman, Okla. The

Junior tight end Alex Smith gallops over an Arizona defender in a game last year. Smith and the Cardinal prevailed in
Provo, Utah, this weekend by defeating BYU, 18-14. The victory capped off an impressive weekend for Pac-10 teams,
as Oregon also pulled an upset.
Sooners' Antonio Perkins ran back
seven punts for 277 yards — an
NCAA record. He scored on three
of them also an NCAA record.

Drew Olson struggled again for
the Bruins, passing 35 times for just
144 yards and two interceptions. His
counterpart, Jason White, threw for
243 yards and two scores.
In Corvallis, Ore., quarterback
Derek Anderson finally got on
track, throwing for 408 yards — 208
of them to James Newson as Oregon
State (3-1) held off Boise State, 26-
24. Steven Jackson, the Pac-10's
leading rusher, added 122 yards on
the ground for the Beavers. Ryan
Dinwiddie passed for 334 yards, but

the Broncos only managed to gain 58
yards on the ground.

No. 18 Washington (2-1) had an
easy time hosting winless Idaho (0-
4) in a 45-14 romp. Cody Pickett
completed 20-of-29 passes for 236
yards, and Rich Alexis gained 115
yards on the ground, scoring twice,
while the Huskies held Vandals
quarterback Michael Harrington to
55 yards on 6-of-23 passing.
No. 21 Washington State (3-1)
got a school-record five field goals
from Drew Dunning to hold off a
gritty New Mexico State team that
managed to carve out a 13-12 half
time lead in Pullman, Wash. Matt
Kegel managed 342 yards on 31-of
44 passing, and Devard Darling had
11 receptions for 128 yards.
Last but not least, Stanford (2-0)
beat Brigham Young (2-2), 18-14,
and is one of the Pac-10's three un
defeated teams.
