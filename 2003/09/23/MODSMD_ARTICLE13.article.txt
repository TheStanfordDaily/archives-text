# Amateurism talk sparks big debate
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON STAFF WRITER 
Prominent members of the sports
world and leading academics met at Stan
ford on Thursday and Friday to discuss
hot topics in sports law. One such topic —
the NCAA's definition of amateurism as
it relates to collegiate football and bas
ketball — produced some of the most
heated discussions at the event.
The current NCAA definition of ama
teurism has been thrown into question by
the skyrocketing revenue and prestige
generated by both football and basket
ball. Many amateur athletes feel slighted,
since both sports continue to generate in
creasing revenue for the universities and
the NCAA, while grants and scholarships
for athletes have increased only with the
cost of living.
Some supporters of student athletes
believe that in order to maintain a top
notch sports program, coaches and ath
letic departments are demanding so
much from student athletes that it be
comes impossible to succeed as both a
student and an athlete. From this per
spective, it is easy to argue that basketball
and football players are being exploited,
especially since 98 percent of football
players and 98.7 percent of basketball
players do not play professional sports
after college-according to results from a
recent survey.

Stan Wheeler, a professor of law and
sciences at Yale University, pointed out
the irony of the NCAA's current concept
of amateurism.
"The more the NCAA earns in televi
sion and other profits, the more it argues

that the product is amateur athletics,"
Wheeler said. "To taint the athletes
would destroy the uniqueness of the
product. So the only way to make the bil
lions of dollars now generated by varsity
athletic programs is to prevent the ath
letes from taking any of it."
The NCAA is in the conflicting posi
tion of making money off the student ath
letes it regulates. Its rules for eligibility at
tempt to define a Concept — amateurism
— that may not be applicable in the cur
rent commercial environment of football
and men's basketball.

"By extending normal seasons into
pre-seasons and postseasons, by convert
ing playoffs to media events, by collabo
rating with the NBA and NFL to feature
the star athletes as they move to the pros
while the great bulk of varsity football
and basketball athletes must find their ca
reers elsewhere, the NCAA is in a diffi
cult moral position when it trumpets the
virtues of amateurism," Wheeler said.
Kevin Murray, a state senator from
California and author of a recent Student
Athlete's Bill of Rights expressed a simi
lar sentiment.

"The only people in this game that are
amateurs are the students playing the
game," Murray said.
In his Student Athlete's Bill of Rights,
Murray insists that athletes should re
ceive scholarships that cover their com
plete cost of living. He also believes that
athletes should be allowed to earn a min
imum amount of outside income, accept a
minimum amount of gifts and have more
comprehensive health care.
Both Murray and Wheeler believe
that while current NCAA rules prevent

athletes from being professionals, they do
not ensure that they will perform well as
students. They feel that an athlete's "am
ateurism" should be determined by how
well he or she is integrated into the life of
the university.
From the NCAA, Elsa Coles of the
general council argued that strict rules
are necessary to prevent corruption. Ac
cording to Coles, strict and obvious rules,
such as athletes being prohibited to take
any money from anyone, are easier to en
force than fuzzier rules, such as an athlete

being allowed to receive money from
friends and coaches.
"The problem is that someone is going
to buy a steak dinner and then someone
else is going to buy a weeklong stay in
Hawaii, and then someone else is going to
offer a month vacation in Europe," said
Stanford head basketball coach Mike
Montgomery.
"The thing escalates and never stops.
Which is why we have the rules that we
