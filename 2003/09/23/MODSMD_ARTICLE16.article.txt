# USC cracks down on cheating
## School uses Stanford software to detect plagiarized assignments 
### LAUREN BONIFACIO THE DAILY TROJAN 
(U-WIRE) - An Internet-based plagiarism detector
has caught several University of Southern California
computer science students cheating, making the USC
School of Engineering's number of academic dishonesty
violations the second highest out of all departments in
the university.

The large number of engineering violations does not
reflect the students' predisposition to cheat, but the ease
with which cheaters in the discipline are caught, said
USC Computer Science Prof. Michael Crowley.
Crowley estimated that cheating occurs in classes
throughout the university on levels similar to those in his
computer science classes.
"But for computer science, it's much easier to mea
sure whether someone has cheated or not," he said.
Crowley uses MOSS, or Measure of Software Simi
larity, to detect plagiarism. With MOSS, professors send
in a batch of student assignments. They then receive a re
port on the similarities between assignments.
MOSS leaves it up to the professor to decide whether
the similarities reflect collaboration between students. It
recognizes the programming languages C, C++, Java,
Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp and Scheme.
"They know me well" at the office of student judicial
affairs and community standards, he said.
"[MOSS] can do things that are practically impossible
for a human to do," Crowley said.
Although the total number of academic dishonesty
violations reported to the university has remained
steady in recent years, the number of Internet-related vi
olations is on the rise, said Christine Wozniak, assistant
director of the office of student judicial affairs and com
munity standards.
There were 152 general academic dishonesty cases
last year, 151 in 2001-02 and 148 in 2000-01.
Crowley said he gave students a programming assign
ment about three years ago and MOSS detected plagia

rism in 28 assignments out of about 70.
Curbing cheating throughout the university requires
the commitment of professors, Crowley said.
"The faculty has to care," Crowley said. "Some of the
research faculty don't want to teach anyway, so they do
it in a minimalist fashion. Luckily, there are not too many
of those."
When Crowley reminds his students he will be using
MOSS, he said he sees few violations. But after a few se
mesters, some students forget.
MOSS is an effective deterrent for cheaters, said se
nior Hunter Francoeur, a computer science and comput
er engineering student.
"Think about it. How hard is it to copy text from
someone else's computer to your computer?" Francoeur
said. "It's easy, but with MOSS it's too risky."
Cheating may happen more frequently outside of the
engineering school, Francoeur added.
"The most cheating I have ever seen has been in my
[general education classes]," Francoeur said. "Engineer
ing work requires you to write your own code and come
up with your own equations, whereas other disciplines
require you to come up with a multiple choice answer."
With bigger classes and smaller staffs at universities
nationwide, it would be difficult to catch cheating stu
dents without a systemized tool, said Alex Aiken, a Stan
ford University computer science professor who devel
oped MOSS.
"The cost of cheating has gone down and the effort
required to cheat has gone down," Aiken said.
While teaching at UC Berkeley in 1994, Aiken devel
oped the system, which compares the structures and
styles in students' computer programming codes.
The major difference between Aiken's and other plagia
rism detectors is that he made his available on the Inter
net, he said.
Expanding MOSS-like services to essays and re
search papers would be more problematic because stu
dents could be plagiarizing from several million loca
tions across the Internet, Aiken said.
MOSS-like services can compare unique phrases in a
student's writing to others in the companies' databases.
And many companies that sell ready-made papers to stu
dents also deal with college and university faculty, pro
fessors said.
