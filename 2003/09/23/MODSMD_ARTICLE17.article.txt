### CARMEN CUSIDO DAILY TARGUM 
(U-WIRE) - Rutgers Univer
sity President Richard L. Mc-
Cormick said his exhaustion was
to blame for the minor motor ve
hicle accident he was involved in
last Friday, although he had "an
odor of alcohol on his breath,"
during the time of the incident, ac
cording to the Rutgers University
Police Department.
Barry W. Roberson, Chief of
the Rutgers Police, said that al
though there was an odor of alco
hol on McCormick's breath, the
smell of alcohol does not necessar
ily mean a person is intoxicated.
Two RUPD officers and two
Piscataway, N.J., police officers
were present at the scene. Rober
son said the officers determined
McCormick did not exhibit signs
required for a Breathalyzer test.
"Unsteadiness and glassy eyes
can simply mean that he was
tired," Roberson said. "I under
stand he had a very long day."
According to the Star Ledger
article, RUPD officer M. Jason
Farella observed McCormick as
being unstable when he talked
and walked. When asked about
his encounter with the RUPD of
ficers, McCormick said he had
only been "exhausted."
"I don't want to say that I work
too hard, but I've worn myself
down," McCormick said in a
phone interview Thursday, ex
plaining the incident.
Last Friday, McCormick woke
up at 5:30 a.m., boarded a 7:30

a.m. flight to Washington, D.C.
for a meeting, and returned to
New Jersey by train a few hours
later, only to come back to a day
filled with meetings.
After his 6 p.m. meeting in
Trenton, N.J., McCormick met
with his family for dinner. He said
he was too tired to eat dinner at
the restaurant but he did have a
glass of red wine. After the dinner,
McCormick said he drove to his
parents' new apartment before
stopping at the Quick Check in
Piscataway. As he was heading
home, he said he backed into a car
without realizing it.
McCormick said he was not
aware he hit the car.
"I never would have driven
away," he said. "If I had known, of
course I would have stopped right
away."
When he pulled into his drive
way, McCormick said he saw anoth
er car pull up behind him and the
man whose car he hit stepped out
and told McCormick he hit the car.
"I said 'I'm sorry, I had no
idea,' " he said. "We then looked
at his car and sure enough his li
cense plate was slightly dented ...
There was also a scratch by his li
cense plate."
McCormick added that he as
sured the driver he would cover
any cost of repair and that the
wine had no effect on his driving.
"I was doing too many things," he
said. "I am still very, very exhausted.
I need to catch up on sleep and re
laxation. I'm going to work hard to
schedule myself less heavily and in
clude more time to rest and relax."
