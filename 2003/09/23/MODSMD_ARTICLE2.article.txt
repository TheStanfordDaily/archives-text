# Marguerite gets $3.8 mil makeover
## 20 new buses replace fleet that had operated since 1983 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
It's time to get on the bus.
This month, Parking and Transportation Ser
vices replaced the old fleet of Marguerites, Stan
ford's line of public buses that had been in service
since 1983, with 20 new state-of-the-art vehicles
that cost $3.8 million.
The new transit buses are low-floor buses with
the latest technological innovations, including a
wheelchair ramp instead of a lift, heavy-duty
cooling and heating systems and three-position
bike racks. The buses also include automatic des
tination signs, for those who might need a little di
rection at the bus stop.
"The new buses are much more comfortable,
with better-quality seats and air conditioning,
making a stop-and-go ride much more bearable,"
said junior Michael Hasper.
The buses are also more environmentally
friendly.
"If you find yourself behind one of the new
buses you will notice that they are virtually
smokeless," said Transportation Program Man
ager Kevin Mathy.
The new buses made their appearance on
Sept. 1. One of the biggest changes is that Stan
ford now owns the buses, instead of renting them
as they did with the older line of Marguerites. Ac
cording to Mathy, this gives the University
greater control over repairs and over the vendors
who operate the buses.
"I don't usually ride the Marguerites, but they
do look cooler," said sophomore Corie Geballe.
The new Marguerite design has a red sash
across the bus that contains the Stanford logo. The
capacity has increased from 23 seats to 32 seats on
the larger buses and from 20 seats to 30 seats on the
smaller buses (with no standing room).

"We've received nothing but positive feed
back concerning these changes," said Mathy.
Another change, effective Jan. 1, will be the in
stitution of a Transportation Management System
that will allow Parking and Transportation Ser
vices, using a GPS system, to keep track of the Mar
guerites, see if they are running on time or over
loaded with passengers, find out the popular spots
and even keep track of the speed of the buses.
The new Marguerite design coincides with
changes to the Marguerite routes, which began
yesterday-the same day as the Caltrain schedule
changed.
To provide more direct service to and from the
Palo Alto Train Station, the B-Line route will op
erate via Quarry Road and Welch Road instead
of Sand Hill Road. In addition to the changes to

the A and B lines, the Park and Ride Line name
will change to the C-Line.
Also, the Sharon Heights and the Menlo Cal
train shuttles will no longer be in service as stu
dents are no longer being housed in Sharon
Heights and the Menlo line was not being used
enough to finance it.
"In these difficult budget times, ensuring that
limited resources are used most effectively is es
pecially important," Mathy said. "The Palo Alto
Transit Center / Train Station has become the
focus the Marguerite transit interface. The vast
majority of Marguerite transit and train transfers
take place at this location, and the Marguerites
A-Line, B-Line and Palm Drive Express provide
extensive service between this station and the en
tire campus."

yesterday afternoon. The new Marguerites cost the University $3.8 million.
