# Shur? UnShur...

Sophomore Neepa Acharya expected
to have her blankets and towels back
when she returned to campus last week.
But that was not to be.
Acharya was among countless Stan
ford students whose Shurgard containers
couldn't be delivered when dorms re
opened to upperclassmen for fall quarter.
Shurgard storage units are a popular
way in which students at Stanford keep
their belongings safe while away for the
summer. Normally, a Shurgard worker
delivers the empty storage unit to campus
and picks up the full container a few days
later; then Shurgard re-delivers the unit
in the fall. But the process hasn't been so
simple this year, as Shurgard representa

tives have told customers to expect deliv
ery delays. According to a Shurgard rep
resentative, workers have been doing the
best they can to accommodate students.
"We are delivering from 9 a.m. until 10
p.m. and it just reaches a certain point
where you have to cut it off because it be
comes insane for not only our properties
but for our drivers to drive," the repre
sentative said.
Acharya and her friends had stored
their belongings in a Shurgard storage
container for the summer, and called last
Monday to arrange a delivery. She was
told that her things could not be delivered
until Sept. 23 — eight days after she
placed the call — because Shurgard had
hundreds of other containers that needed
to be delivered to campus.
Because Acharya and her friends
needed necessities like bedding and toi

letries, they decided to drive up to the
Shurgard warehouse in Hayward —
about 30 minutes from Stanford — even
though the $400 price tag for Shurgard
containers includes delivery to campus.
And then, the problem went from bad
to worse.
Acharya got a call from Shurgard
telling her that the warehouse personnel
were unable to find her container. They
told her that this happened to a few stu
dents every year and that they would be
calling her that night with an update, and
most likely, the whereabouts of her con
tainer.
"They didn't seem to be concerned
about finding my stuff," Acharya said,
"and I don't think that they are telling the
truth about the normality of the situa
tion."
Sophomore Tom Feulner's problems

went a step further.
"My Shurgard was supposed to be de
livered [yesterday]," he said. "It never
showed up, and when I called Shurgard,
they said that it couldn't be delivered to
Toy on because there was no room at
Toy on, so it had to be delivered to
Wilbur, which is quite far, but it didn't
show up there either."
A Shurgard representative said that
students are not calling far enough in ad
vance to ensure prompt delivery.
"On the back of the contracts [that
students signed] it asks for 10 days no
tice," she said. "And by having that no
tice, we can stage them [the deliveries] for
the students and accommodate them. A
lot of the students have been calling with
one or two days notice."

Many sheetless students have had to sleep on clothes and personal belongings until their Shurgard storage containers are delivered.
