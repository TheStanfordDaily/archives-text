# Clark Center fosters interdisciplinary unity
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
From afar, it may look like any
other stone building. But the James
H. Clark Center for Biomedical En
gineering and Sciences has a unique
design that supports the multidisci
plinary Bio-X research program â€”
and it serves as an intersection of the
medical, engineering, humanities
and the science disciplines on cam
pus.
The Clark Center is the new hub
for Bio-X, a program started in 1998
that supports multidisciplinary
work related to biology. It is a joint
project of the Schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Engineering,
Earth Sciences and Medicine that
focuses on interdisciplinary bio
medical research. The construction,
completed early this summer, cost
Stanford $138 million.
Structural Biology Prof. Michael
Levitt, chair of the department,
moved into the center in July and is
studying computational biology in
his lab.
"This is the most exciting acade
mic building in the world today," he
said. "With a wonderfully commit
ted multidisciplinary group and the
most central campus location for
the science, this is where it is all
going to happen!"
Director of'Bio-X Operations
Beth Kane said the Clark Center
was an integral part of and catalyst
for the program and ended up being
remarkably close to what its plan
ners had envisioned.
"It's such a welcoming building,"
Kane said. "There is just something
about the elegance and warmth of
this building that makes it an extra
ordinary place to work."
The center houses laboratories
for research in biocomputation, bio

physics, biodesign, chemical biolo
gy, genomics/proteomics and regen
erative medicine. The 146,000
square foot space also holds the new
Department of Bioengineering, an
auditorium, seminar rooms, a
restaurant and Peet's Coffee.
Levitt described using the facility
as being "wonderful in every way,"
appreciating the space, architecture
and "lots of opportunities for
chance meetings."
The building is made of three
pods that surround an open court
yard that has a circular stage, be
neath which there is an auditori
um. There are balconies on each
floor of the three-story building
that go around the entire perime
ter. The exterior is covered in lime
stone, similar to other buildings
near it, but the interior is mostly
glass. These windows allow visitors
to see into all the laboratories un
like other labs that are made up of
corridors and closed doors, Kane
explained.
The layout of the building is
closely linked to the program's mis
sion of encouraging interdiscipli
nary collaboration.
"So many pieces of the building
are designed to get people talking to
each other, to get students flowing
up through the building," Kane
said, describing the "dramatic
courtyard" and stairways.
Inside, rolling lab benches and
large open labs without corridors
make for easily adjustable lab lay
outs. Many labs share spaces with
one another in the spirit of the col
laborative program. Unlike tradi
tional labs, the center's lab support
spaces are on the perimeter of the
building rather than in the central
space.
Since July, 25 of approximately 40
labs have moved into the center.
Melissa Scott, a doctoral candi
date in biophysics who works in
shared lab, said, "It's nice to mix with
the other people here because the
two labs are working on similar
things." Her lab is studying protein
folding, degeneration and aggrada
tion.
Michael Bradshaw, a post-doc
toral fellow in molecular pharmacol
ogy, is working in Tobias Meyer's lab
studying the cell biology of signaling
processes. The group moved into the

Clark Center in July. He also said
that it has been exciting working
there and meeting different people
researching areas he usually does
not come across.
While both Scott and Bradshaw
said they liked meeting the new peo
ple and the collaborative environ
ment, they also said that the lab
spaces felt smaller and more crowd
ed than their previous work spaces.
While most of its occupants seem
excited about the new Clark Center,
both for the stimulating space and
the collaborative atmosphere, it is
still yet to be seen what the multidis
ciplinary Bio-X program will suc
ceed in achieving in its specially de
signed space.
"Time will tell if this has been a

productive venture in terms of com
ing up with new scientific ideas,"
Bradshaw said.
Early this month, James Clark,
who pledged $150 million to launch
Bio-X, decided to withhold $60 mil
lion of it in protest of recent federal
policies of limiting stem cell research
and possibly non-reproductive
cloning. Construction was not affect
ed because the rest of the money
Clark donated as well as that of an
anonymous donor was enough to
fund the work, but Kane said the
withdrawal has depleted funding for
the Bio-X program itself.
The first interdisciplinary scien
tific symposium in the building took
place on July 31, and the center's
grand opening is set for Oct. 24.
