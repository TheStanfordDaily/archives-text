# Clark Center fosters interdisciplinary unity
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
From afar, it may look like any
other stone building. But the James
H. Clark Center for Biomedical En
gineering and Sciences has a unique
design that supports the multidisci
plinary Bio-X research program â€”
and it serves as an intersection of the
medical, engineering, humanities
and the science disciplines on cam
pus.
The Clark Center is the new hub
for Bio-X, a program started in 1998
that supports multidisciplinary
work related to biology. It is a joint
project of the Schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Engineering,
Earth Sciences and Medicine that
focuses on interdisciplinary bio
medical research. The construction,
completed early this summer, cost
Stanford $138 million.
Structural Biology Prof. Michael
Levitt, chair of the department,
moved into the center in July and is
studying computational biology in
his lab.
"This is the most exciting acade
mic building in the world today," he
said. "With a wonderfully commit
ted multidisciplinary group and the
most central campus location for
the science, this is where it is all
going to happen!"
Director of'Bio-X Operations
Beth Kane said the Clark Center
was an integral part of and catalyst
for the program and ended up being
remarkably close to what its plan
ners had envisioned.
"It's such a welcoming building,"
Kane said. "There is just something
about the elegance and warmth of
this building that makes it an extra
ordinary place to work."
The center houses laboratories
for research in biocomputation, bio

physics, biodesign, chemical biolo
gy, genomics/proteomics and regen
erative medicine. The 146,000
square foot space also holds the new
Department of Bioengineering, an
auditorium, seminar rooms, a
restaurant and Peet's Coffee.
Levitt described using the facility
as being "wonderful in every way,"
appreciating the space, architecture
and "lots of opportunities for
chance meetings."
The building is made of three
pods that surround an open court
yard that has a circular stage, be
neath which there is an auditori
um. There are balconies on each
floor of the three-story building
that go around the entire perime
ter. The exterior is covered in lime
stone, similar to other buildings
near it, but the interior is mostly
glass. These windows allow visitors
to see into all the laboratories un
like other labs that are made up of
corridors and closed doors, Kane
explained.
The layout of the building is
closely linked to the program's mis
sion of encouraging interdiscipli
nary collaboration.
"So many pieces of the building
are designed to get people talking to
each other, to get students flowing
up through the building," Kane
said, describing the "dramatic
courtyard" and stairways.
Inside, rolling lab benches and
large open labs without corridors
make for easily adjustable lab lay
outs. Many labs share spaces with
one another in the spirit of the col
laborative program. Unlike tradi
tional labs, the center's lab support
spaces are on the perimeter of the
building rather than in the central
space.
