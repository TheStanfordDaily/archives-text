## Laundry policy: a good idea poorly executed 
### 
As students return to campus today,
many will be surprised to discover
that laundry machines still demand
four quarters before they start suds
ing. The erratic backpedling in the ASSU and
Stanford Housing and Dining Services' stance
on laundry billing for the upcoming year is in
dicative of an unprofessional decision-making
process on the part of these two organizations.
Although the ASSU and Housing Services
declared in early June that laundry would be
billed on a per-quarter, flat-fee basis for the up
coming academic year, they have since retract
ed the proposed policy and instead announced
that laundry fees will continue to be charged on
a per-load basis indefinitely.
The decision to implement the flat-fee laun
dry system was reached with seemingly little
student input during the closing weeks of spring
quarter. Open forums to encourage dialogue
between the proponents of the new plan and
the students who would be use it were poorly
publicized at best or non-existent at worst.
Once the flat-fee proposal was accepted,
undergraduates never received a proper expla
nation from the University describing the poli
cy or detailing its implementation. Reflective
of the hasty nature in which the plan was
adopted, the ASSU and Housing Services at
tempted to draft a letter discussing the new
laundry fees, but were not able to complete it
before the close of the school year.
The lack of consideration given to the new
fee approach is evidenced by the subsequent re
traction of the policy by the ASSU and Housing
Services at the end of the summer. And while it
was careless not to properly alert the Stanford
community of the new flat-fee system, it was
negligent of these organizations commitment to
students not to inform them that the policy
change — word of which had spread around

campus as ASSU officers trumpeted their
achievement — had been canceled.
Housing Services reported that it received 38
letters of complaint in response to the proposed
change and that these letters played a key part in
the decision to postpone implementing the flat
fee program. The concerns brought up in these
letters could have been addressed and recon
ciled through a more thorough evaluation pro
cess before any new policy was adopted. This
more adequate evaluation would have eliminat
ed the need to backpeddle later.
A flat-fee system admittedly offers many
benefits over a pay-per-use model. Students
would find it much more convenient not to
scrounge for quarters or locate a card deposit
machine when they want to do laundry. But the
lack of research on the part of the ASSU and
Housing Services killed a program that could
have been beneficial to many.
That said, the plan was not without its flaws.
The suggested quarterly fee of $28 for laundry
could end up overcharging students who do
not do as many loads of laundry as the flat-fee
equivalent — which in that case, would equate
to more than two loads per week. A better flat
fee system would work out some way of sim
plifying the laundry process while not punish
ing those who do fewer loads of laundry.
The ASSU and Housing Services should be
commended for trying to address the concerns
of students who prefer a flat-fee laundry
model, but their efforts have fallen short since
the student body has not ultimately benefited
from their proposed plan. The two groups
should continue to research a variety of plans
to simplify laundry services on campus, and
hopefully will be able to come forward with a
new proposal in the near future. This time,
however, we hope that they solicit more stu
dent input before announcing a change.
