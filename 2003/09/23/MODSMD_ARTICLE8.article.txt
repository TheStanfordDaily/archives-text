# CoHo remodel misfires
## 
### 
Although University Housing and
Dining Services' remodeling of the
CoHo has brought the design of
Stanford's best hangout into the 21st
century, the new menu offerings at the Coffee
House leave the palate dry.
Even though the speed of service at the
CoHo has dramatically increased, there has not
been a comparable improvement in the quality
of food served at the establishment. The new
sandwiches are unappealing; the pizza, seeming
ly delicious from afar, is unsatisfying; and the
wraps are dry. Worst of all, a meal from the re
modeled CoHo is more costly now that it was
last year, and any student with a normal
metabolism is left hungry sooner thanks to
skimpier portions.
In essence, the CoHo renovation misfired.
Dining Services officials spent too much time
picking out the right lampshades and not enough
time making sure that the menu carried a variety
of affordable, reasonably priced and filling
items.

Additionally, the campus hangout has yet to
obtain a liquor license. While few during last
week's freshman orientation missed the frothy
pitchers of beer that are normally served up
behind the Coffee House's counters, students
are back on campus in full force this week.
They will expect to be able to buy alcoholic
beverages on campus — and that means more
than being able to sip a glass of brandy at the
Alumni Center's bar. Although the Treehouse
serves beer, students will sorely miss their
lagers during Thursday night concerts at the
CoHo
We urge the management of the CoHo to ex
pand its menu, with an eye toward maintaining
low-cost options for students. Few on cam
pus — students, staff or faculty,— will be happy
eating regularly in a restaurant that offers less
than a dozen menu options, and few choices in
each broad category of food. Hopefully the
CoHo will recognize this, and adjust its menu
accordingly.
