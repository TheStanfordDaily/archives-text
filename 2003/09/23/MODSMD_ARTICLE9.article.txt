## OP-ED Bush hasn't fulfilled promises 
### RACHELLE MARSHALL 
After less than three years
in office, President
George W. Bush has
taken our country into
two wars that have yet to end, has
promoted policies that have caused
the loss of three million jobs and has
turned a healthy federal surplus into
a $500 billion deficit. He cam
paigned previously as a "compas
sionate conservative," and although
the 2004 presidential election is
more than a year away, he is already
touring the country offering new
guarantees. Now is the time to rec
ognize that Bush has persistently
hidden the truth and fallen short of
carrying out his past promises.
While pushing for his $1.2 trillion
tax cut, Bush claimed the measure
would provide Americans with an
"average tax cut of $1,083." But what
"average" actually meant was that
the richest 1 percent of Americans
received a tax reduction of nearly
$100,000, while half of all tax payers
got less than $100. Many wage earn
ers received no benefit at all.
In justifying his economic plan,
Bush stated, "We need robust tax
relief so our fellow citizens can find
a job." But 400 economists — in
cluding 10 Nobel laureates — took
out a full page ad in the New York
Times declaring that the tax cuts
would not create jobs, but instead
result in huge deficits further crip
pling the economy.
This summer, Bush's spokesman
Ari Fleischer announced, "The tax
cuts have helped create jobs and pro
mote growth." A few weeks later,
Bush declared that "our economy is
starting to grow." Yet earlier this
month, the Labor Department re
ported that 93,000 jobs were lost in
August. After three tax cuts, unem
ployment still stands at its highest
level in nine years.

Bush discussed the importance of
"compassion" while he cut funding
for school lunches, food stamps,
health care for the poor and veter
ans' benefits. He talked about pro
tecting the environment while elimi
nating or reducing regulations on air
and water quality, allowing mining
companies to fill valleys and streams
with waste and opening up wilder
ness areas for oil and gas explo
ration. The arguably misnamed
Healthy Forests Initiative has made
more national forest land available
to the timber industry. His Compre
hensive Energy Plan is "a compendi
um of subsidies and tax breaks to the
coal, oil and gas industries," accord
ing to a New York Times editorial.
Bush's education policy is no less
inconsistent with his stated objec
tives. Instead of "leaving no child be
hind," Bush's budget for next year
will eliminate a reading readiness
program for poor children, reduce
Pell grants to needy college students,
cut $200 million from a program de
veloped to promote proficiency in
reading and math, eliminate a high
school dropout prevention program
and cut more than 20,000 teachers
from professional training programs.
His self-proclaimed "compas
sion" also does not extend to
women. Because Bush canceled U.S.
contributions to the U.N. Population
Fund and an international AIDS
program serving women, African
clinics that provided reproductive
health care to impoverished women
were forced to shutdown. His nomi
nees for federal judgeships have all
opposed women's reproductive
rights. One of his current nominees,
William Pryor, referred to Roe v.
Wade as "the worst abomination of
constitutional law in our history."
Although his administration's ef
forts to protect ports, chemical plants
and other sensitive targets have been
minimal, Bush continually cites the

threat of terrorism to justify curtail
ing civil liberties. Since Sept. 11, the
government has detained numerous
Muslim immigrants on questionable
grounds, has created a more difficult
atmosphere for foreign students to
attend American universities and has
held hundreds of terror suspects —
including three Americans — while
denying them the right to hearings or
lawyers.

Bush invoked questionable evi
dence to convince the American
public of the necessity of invading
Iraq. His claims that Saddam Hus
sein possessed weapons of mass de
struction and was trying to purchase
uranium oxide for nuclear weapons
production remain unsubstantiated
to this day. He repeatedly suggested
that Iraq was involved in the attacks
of Sept. 11, although no specific links
have been provided.

He now insists that the war in
Iraq has liberated Iraqis and helped
safeguard Americans from terror
ism. But the invasion of Iraq and the
administration's failure to cope
with its aftermath have left that
country with a damaged domestic
infrastructure. The region is cur
rently a magnet for anti-U.S. mili
tants. Bush's war efforts have killed
thousands of innocent people, have
alienated American allies and have
increased anti-U.S. sentiment
around the world — in other words,
they have not made us safer.
Last spring a reporter for the New
York Times asked a White House
spokesman why Bush made state
ments that were inaccurate. The
spokesman replied, "The president is
not a fact checker." And why should
he be? Bush simply makes up his own
facts and assumes Americans will be
gullible enough to believe him.

the 2004 presidential election is
more than a year away, he is already
touring the country offering new
guarantees. Now is the time to rec
ognize that Bush has persistently
hidden the truth and fallen short of
carrying out his past promises.
While pushing for his $1.2 trillion
tax cut, Bush claimed the measure
would provide Americans with an
"average tax cut of $1,083." But what
"average" actually meant was that
the richest 1 percent of Americans
received a tax reduction of nearly
$100,000, while half of all tax payers
got less than $100. Many wage earn
ers received no benefit at all.
In justifying his economic plan,
Bush stated, "We need robust tax
relief so our fellow citizens can find
a job." But 400 economists — in
cluding 10 Nobel laureates — took
out a full page ad in the New York
Times declaring that the tax cuts
would not create jobs, but instead
result in huge deficits further crip
pling the economy.
This summer, Bush's spokesman
Ari Fleischer announced, "The tax
cuts have helped create jobs and pro
mote growth." A few weeks later,
Bush declared that "our economy is
starting to grow." Yet earlier this
month, the Labor Department re
ported that 93,000 jobs were lost in
August. After three tax cuts, unem
ployment still stands at its highest
level in nine years.

Bush discussed the importance of
"compassion" while he cut funding
for school lunches, food stamps,
health care for the poor and veter
ans' benefits. He talked about pro
tecting the environment while elimi
nating or reducing regulations on air
and water quality, allowing mining
companies to fill valleys and streams
with waste and opening up wilder
ness areas for oil and gas explo
ration. The arguably misnamed
Healthy Forests Initiative has made
more national forest land available
to the timber industry. His Compre
hensive Energy Plan is "a compendi
um of subsidies and tax breaks to the
coal, oil and gas industries," accord
ing to a New York Times editorial.
Bush's education policy is no less
inconsistent with his stated objec
tives. Instead of "leaving no child be
hind," Bush's budget for next year
will eliminate a reading readiness
program for poor children, reduce
Pell grants to needy college students,
cut $200 million from a program de
veloped to promote proficiency in
reading and math, eliminate a high
school dropout prevention program
and cut more than 20,000 teachers
from professional training programs.
His self-proclaimed "compas
sion" also does not extend to
women. Because Bush canceled U.S.
contributions to the U.N. Population
Fund and an international AIDS
program serving women, African
clinics that provided reproductive
health care to impoverished women
were forced to shutdown. His nomi
nees for federal judgeships have all
opposed women's reproductive
rights. One of his current nominees,
William Pryor, referred to Roe v.
Wade as "the worst abomination of
constitutional law in our history."
Although his administration's ef
forts to protect ports, chemical plants
and other sensitive targets have been
minimal, Bush continually cites the

threat of terrorism to justify curtail
ing civil liberties. Since Sept. 11, the
government has detained numerous
Muslim immigrants on questionable
grounds, has created a more difficult
atmosphere for foreign students to
attend American universities and has
held hundreds of terror suspects —
including three Americans — while
denying them the right to hearings or
lawyers.

Bush invoked questionable evi
dence to convince the American
public of the necessity of invading
Iraq. His claims that Saddam Hus
sein possessed weapons of mass de
struction and was trying to purchase
uranium oxide for nuclear weapons
production remain unsubstantiated
to this day. He repeatedly suggested
that Iraq was involved in the attacks
of Sept. 11, although no specific links
have been provided.

He now insists that the war in
Iraq has liberated Iraqis and helped
safeguard Americans from terror
ism. But the invasion of Iraq and the
administration's failure to cope
with its aftermath have left that
country with a damaged domestic
infrastructure. The region is cur
rently a magnet for anti-U.S. mili
tants. Bush's war efforts have killed
thousands of innocent people, have
alienated American allies and have
increased anti-U.S. sentiment
around the world — in other words,
they have not made us safer.
Last spring a reporter for the New
York Times asked a White House
spokesman why Bush made state
ments that were inaccurate. The
spokesman replied, "The president is
not a fact checker." And why should
he be? Bush simply makes up his own
facts and assumes Americans will be
gullible enough to believe him.
