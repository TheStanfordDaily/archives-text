JEWISH STUDIES
The Question of Jewish American Fiction
(174C, Oppenheimer)
There is an old debate about whether there is a specific African American literary tradition—are there
"black" novelists, or only novelists who happen to be black? We will ask the same question of fiction
by Jews in the United States. Commentators from Susan Sontag to Lenny Bruce have identified a strain
of Yiddishkayt, or Jewishness, running through our culture, affecting even non-Jews. Could it exist? Do
certain fictions have a Jewish spirit, Gestalt, temperament? If so, what does it consist of? And could a
non-Jew, then, write a "Jewish" book? Fiction by Yezierska, Malamud, Roth, Bellow, Ozick, Paley, Gish
Jen, and Zadie Smith; criticsm by Ellison, Howe, and Sontag.
The World of Jewish Cinema
(215A/315A, Plotkin)
Cinema is a rich archive of modern experience. It provides us with unique depictions of the socio-polit
ical atmosphere of the last century. The founders of the Hollywood film industry were ambitious immi
grant Jews more interested in assimilating into the world they were creating on screen than preserving
their own stories. By contrast contemporary independent and foreign cinema explores more deeply the
nuances of the Jewish narrative. This class will present films that provide fresh and alternative per
spectives on history, ethnicity, and identity. A variety of film genres will be employed to bring us clos
er to the emotional reality of displacement, memory and renewal. Special focus on films from
Argentina, France, Germany, Holland, Hungary, Israel, Mexico and the former USSR.
