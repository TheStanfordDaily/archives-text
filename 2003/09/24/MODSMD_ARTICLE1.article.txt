# Bookstore's computers back on-line
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU DESK EDITOR 
The corrupted file that caused the
Stanford Bookstore computer system
to fail on Monday, Sept. 15, was fixed on
Saturday, according to Jef Friedel, sales
and marketing manager at the Book
store. Affecting the Bookstore's satel
lite stores as well, the problem forced
employees to write out receipts by hand
and use calculators.
"Everything's up and running now,"
he said. "We were in back-up mode
from Wednesday on. As a result, we had
only two days of hand-written receipts.
After that, customers couldn't have
seen that anything was wrong. To them,
the bookstore seemed back to normal"
Friedel doesn't anticipate any fur
ther problems.
"We've replaced all of the equip
ment," he said. "Some people even
slept here all night to ensure the prob
lem was fixed. We've had to do some
catch-up work, but right now, every
thing's great."
Friedel commented that he was
looking forward to "Back to the Farm
Frenzy," a new student night that will
take place at the Bookstore on Wednes
day, Oct. 1 from 6 to 9 p.m.
"We've put last week behind us," he
said. "Right now, we're all gearing up
for that"
Senior Katie Cameron was excited
that the problem is now fixed.
"Wow, it's great that the cash regis
ters are up and running again," she said.
Another student said he couldn't
comment on the situation because he'd
been away for last week's chaos.
"I had no idea there was something
wrong," he said. "Everything looks fine
to me. There certainly are no long
lines."
Not everyone had such a positive
take on the matter. A Stanford Book
store employee who preferred to re
main unidentified was upset about the
way the issue was handled.
"The store has lost a considerable
amount of customer good will," he said. "It
was an inexcusable and unjustifiable
situation. And you can't forget that
last year the same thing happened at
the same time. You'd think they
would have learned their lesson."
"[The problemjhas given us bad
publicity and has caused a severe
disruption in business," the em
ployee continued. "Last week was
a mess and it was hard for all of us.
We were working under consider
able stress and pressure. We knew
that we couldn't respond adequate
ly to customers' requests. It's not a
good way to run a 21st century
bookstore."
The employee was upbeat about
the future of the Bookstore.
"Let's hope that this clean sys
tem will stay operating the way it's
designed to so we can return to our
customary level of good service"
