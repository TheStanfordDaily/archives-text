## NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER Stanford doesn't teach Australian 
### 
Ahh, don't you love Fall
Quarter at Stanford? Ev
eryone is renewed by the
long summer and there is
a fresh, crisp feeling of excitement
floating through the air. What mem
orable things will happen this year?
Which frats will be put on proba
tion? What activist groups will hold
protests and yummy cookie sales?
As you ponder these significant
questions (and wonder who will
commit dormcest by next Friday),
I'm sure you're busy settling into
your room and trying to make it liv
able. And don't you dare complain
to me about your miniscule double
in Lag or your quadruple in Roble.
Small as you think it is, I'm currently
sharing a bunk room with eight —
yep, you read right — eight girls, in
the Moreton Bay research station
here in Australia. Then again, the
view of the turquoise waters from
our windows is pretty unbelievable.
As you kick off the year at Stan
ford, let me introduce you to life
here on the other side of the world,
where spring has barely sprung, and
where we'll experience "today"
nearly a full day ahead of you. Aus
tralia is the land of the unexpected
— in every possible way. The flight
attendant cheerfully told us that it
was one of the newest countries on
one of the oldest continents (of
course forgetting the fact that the
Aborigines inhabited the island 40 to
50 thousand years before the Brits
sent their prisoners to this far-off
colony in 1770), and cities such as
Sydney or Brisbane sparkle with a
mix of a worldwide influence. I
walked through the streets and saw
the great remnants of England and
the rest of the European continent in
many shops and restaurants along
with a good amount of Asian influ
ence: impeccably dressed Japanese
shoppers entered the Duty Free
shops in search of the latest Louis
Vuiton bag and the city's business
district overflowing with all sorts of
French bistros and Italian cafes.
In our first few days here, we were

stationed at the University of Queens
land, or the "uni," as it is locally
known, and we wandered around the
village of Toowong. I wish I could tell
you it was full of interesting only-in-
Australia hang out spots with cool
names like "Dave's Surf Hut on the

Sunshine Coast,"
or something like
that, but I'm sorry
to disappoint.
There was a Siz
zler, a Subway, a
McDonalds (oh,
the pride of our
American im
ports), and a
Kmart. Well, at
least the employ

ees had Australian accents.
Even so, Australia has its own
cool culture. Yet, for all of its won
derful qualities, some things strike
me as odd in this country. There is no
real "culture shock," as the language
is English and the similarities to
American society are plentiful. Nah,
it's the smaller details that remind
you that you're in Australia and
nowhere else.
For example, all summer long I
grumbled about the weight of the
coins in Europe that almost makes
the adoption of the Euro unworthy
— and then I realized I should have
stopped my complaining right then
and there, for I had yet to see the Aus
tralian coin system. After all, what
treasury in their right minds would
make the coins increasingly bigger as
their worth diminished and then went
back to making them small again?
And they have $2 coins! You could
drop your change and easily lose all of
your savings in one fell swoop!
But that was only the beginning.
While there is no language com
ponent to our program, we're quick
ly realizing that there are certain dif
ferences that can make communica
tion, well, let's just call it interesting.
Aside from the accent (the most
mundane words can make all 32 girls
on the trip simply swoon when com
ing out mouth of a suntanned Aus

tralian), there are many amusing
words and phrases that constantly
keep us guessing. But that's not al
ways something you want in class.
My favorite quote in lecture so far:
Stanford student: Excuse me pro
fessor, but could you explain to us
what "catchment" means?
Australian Prof: Oh my God.
Have you understood a single word
that I have said in the past two
hours?
Talk about a blow to our egos.
Can you blame us? Despite offering
Swahili and Farsi, Stanford simply
doesn't offer Australian English 101.
And I'm sure the professors and staff
here all think we're all a little deaf, as
we've had to ask them to repeat
things so many times in hopes of un
derstanding what they've said (What
do you mean we can check our mile
here? Oh! You mean mail!)
Then there's the fact that they
drive on the other side of the road,
just like the English. Although we're
in the land of snakes with names such
as the "death adder," fatally poi
sonous blue-ringed octopi and killer
jellyfish, the biggest danger we actu
ally face is being careless, failing to
look to the right side of the road and
getting killed by a car. Pathetic, huh?
But don't worry too much about
us. We'll survive, somehow. I guess
we'll have to busy ourselves making
field trips to white sand beaches,
mangrove forests, spring brooks and
Australian cosmopolitan centers.
And we've all concluded that
there are some Australian customs
that we must bring back to Stanford
upon our return. Such as the practice
of having tea between our morning
lectures, complete with pasties and
teacakes. So as they keep telling us
here in Australia: No worries, mate
— we'll bring back a little Aussie
sunshine and culture when get back
to the Farm. You'll just have to help
us get adjusted to the winter climate.

shoppers entered the Duty Free
shops in search of the latest Louis
Vuiton bag and the city's business
district overflowing with all sorts of
French bistros and Italian cafes.
In our first few days here, we were

stationed at the University of Queens
land, or the "uni," as it is locally
known, and we wandered around the
village of Toowong. I wish I could tell
you it was full of interesting only-in-
Australia hang out spots with cool
names like "Dave's Surf Hut on the

Sunshine Coast,"
or something like
that, but I'm sorry
to disappoint.
There was a Siz
zler, a Subway, a
McDonalds (oh,
the pride of our
American im
ports), and a
Kmart. Well, at
least the employ

ees had Australian accents.
Even so, Australia has its own
cool culture. Yet, for all of its won
derful qualities, some things strike
me as odd in this country. There is no
real "culture shock," as the language
is English and the similarities to
American society are plentiful. Nah,
it's the smaller details that remind
you that you're in Australia and
nowhere else.
For example, all summer long I
grumbled about the weight of the
coins in Europe that almost makes
the adoption of the Euro unworthy
— and then I realized I should have
stopped my complaining right then
and there, for I had yet to see the Aus
tralian coin system. After all, what
treasury in their right minds would
make the coins increasingly bigger as
their worth diminished and then went
back to making them small again?
And they have $2 coins! You could
drop your change and easily lose all of
your savings in one fell swoop!
But that was only the beginning.
While there is no language com
ponent to our program, we're quick
ly realizing that there are certain dif
ferences that can make communica
tion, well, let's just call it interesting.
Aside from the accent (the most
mundane words can make all 32 girls
on the trip simply swoon when com
ing out mouth of a suntanned Aus

tralian), there are many amusing
words and phrases that constantly
keep us guessing. But that's not al
ways something you want in class.
My favorite quote in lecture so far:
Stanford student: Excuse me pro
fessor, but could you explain to us
what "catchment" means?
Australian Prof: Oh my God.
Have you understood a single word
that I have said in the past two
hours?
Talk about a blow to our egos.
Can you blame us? Despite offering
Swahili and Farsi, Stanford simply
doesn't offer Australian English 101.
And I'm sure the professors and staff
here all think we're all a little deaf, as
we've had to ask them to repeat
things so many times in hopes of un
derstanding what they've said (What
do you mean we can check our mile
here? Oh! You mean mail!)
Then there's the fact that they
drive on the other side of the road,
just like the English. Although we're
in the land of snakes with names such
as the "death adder," fatally poi
sonous blue-ringed octopi and killer
jellyfish, the biggest danger we actu
ally face is being careless, failing to
look to the right side of the road and
getting killed by a car. Pathetic, huh?
But don't worry too much about
us. We'll survive, somehow. I guess
we'll have to busy ourselves making
field trips to white sand beaches,
mangrove forests, spring brooks and
Australian cosmopolitan centers.
And we've all concluded that
there are some Australian customs
that we must bring back to Stanford
upon our return. Such as the practice
of having tea between our morning
lectures, complete with pasties and
teacakes. So as they keep telling us
here in Australia: No worries, mate
— we'll bring back a little Aussie
sunshine and culture when get back
to the Farm. You'll just have to help
us get adjusted to the winter climate.

Ahh, don't you love Fall
Quarter at Stanford? Ev
eryone is renewed by the
long summer and there is
a fresh, crisp feeling of excitement
floating through the air. What mem
orable things will happen this year?
Which frats will be put on proba
tion? What activist groups will hold
protests and yummy cookie sales?
As you ponder these significant
questions (and wonder who will
commit dormcest by next Friday),
I'm sure you're busy settling into
your room and trying to make it liv
able. And don't you dare complain
to me about your miniscule double
in Lag or your quadruple in Roble.
Small as you think it is, I'm currently
sharing a bunk room with eight —
yep, you read right — eight girls, in
the Moreton Bay research station
here in Australia. Then again, the
view of the turquoise waters from
our windows is pretty unbelievable.
As you kick off the year at Stan
ford, let me introduce you to life
here on the other side of the world,
where spring has barely sprung, and
where we'll experience "today"
nearly a full day ahead of you. Aus
tralia is the land of the unexpected
— in every possible way. The flight
attendant cheerfully told us that it
was one of the newest countries on
one of the oldest continents (of
course forgetting the fact that the
Aborigines inhabited the island 40 to
50 thousand years before the Brits
sent their prisoners to this far-off
colony in 1770), and cities such as
Sydney or Brisbane sparkle with a
mix of a worldwide influence. I
walked through the streets and saw
the great remnants of England and
the rest of the European continent in
many shops and restaurants along
with a good amount of Asian influ
ence: impeccably dressed Japanese
shoppers entered the Duty Free
shops in search of the latest Louis
Vuiton bag and the city's business
district overflowing with all sorts of
French bistros and Italian cafes.
