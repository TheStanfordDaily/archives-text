# Federal court approves recall
## Recall election to take place on Oct. 7

WALNUT CREEK, Calif.
(KRT) - California's gubernator
ial recall election must occur Oct.
7 as scheduled, a federal appeals
court ruled yesterday, overturn
ing an earlier court order post
poning the historic vote until
March.
The American Civil Liberties
Union, which had sought the
delay, said it wouldn't appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court. That cleared
what is likely the last legal obstacle
from the path to Election Day.
"With the election just two
weeks away, we do not believe we
should prolong the uncertainty
any longer," the civil rights group
said in a statement. "At this point,
it is important that the candi
dates, the campaigns and the vot
ers know that the election will be
held on a date that is certain."
Tuesday's decision by an 11-
member panel of the San Francis
co-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals came less than 24 hours
after the judges, in a courtroom
packed with news media and the
public, heard vigorous arguments
for and against delaying the elec
tion.
At issue was whether six coun
ties' planned use of error-prone
punch-card ballots - the kind
used in Florida's controversial
2000 presidential election -
would disenfranchise some
40,000 voters when voters go to
the polls.
The ACLU argued that using
the punch cards would violate the
Constitution's assurance that all
votes would be counted equally.
It also contended that the ballot
ing would violate the Federal

Voting Rights Act, which bars
voting discrimination on the basis
of race.
The ACLU sought to delay the
election until March, by which
time more accurate voting ma
chines will be used in all 58 coun
ties in California.
The appeals court ruled that
the ACLU's claims were too
speculative to warrant such dras
tic action, noting, for instance,
that some 500,000 voters already
have cast absentee ballots.
"Interference with impending
elections is extraordinary, and in
terference with an election after
voting has begun is unprecedent
ed," the judges wrote.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray
Davis' campaign to beat the recall
said the Democratic governor
was as prepared as ever to settle
up with voters.
"We are ready to beat the re
call on Oct. 7," Peter Ragone said
in a statement. "It is time to move
forward, but it is now doubly im
portant that counties do every
thing in their power to make sure
every single vote is counted."
Earlier in the campaign, Davis,
citing the same problem with
punch-card ballots that the
ACLU raised, had asked the state
Supreme Court to delay the elec
tion until March. The justices de
nied his request, and since then
Davis hasn't fought the recall in
court.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, one
of two prominent Republicans
who are running to replace Davis,
praised the appeals court's deci
sion.
"This legal process has made
clear that a March election would
deprive the people of California
the opportunity to vote without
delay and without confusion," the
actor said in a statement. "It is
time for the legal wrangling to
end. It is time for this election to
go forward."
