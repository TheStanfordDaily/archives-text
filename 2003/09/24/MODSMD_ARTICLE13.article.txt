# Stanford remembers Sept. 11
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Shortly after the events of Sept. 11,2001, junior
Maneesh Kumar boarded a bus in San Francisco during
his dorm's freshman scavenger hunt. Kumar was talking
and laughing with friends when a man on the bus stood
up and yelled derogatory remarks at him.
"I remember him shouting, 'You're so happy, you
fucking Indian. Why are you so happy?' And then there
was silence," Kumar recalled. "I just sat there, just lis
tened to it. Looking back, I should have said something
in my defense, taken a stand to feel more empowered."
The memory of his experience and a need to reflect on
9/11 and all acts of intolerance brought Kumar to the side
chapel of Memorial Church for Stanford's Multifaith
Vigil of Remembrance and Hope on Sept. 11 of this year.
The office of religious life organized the service "to
provide a movement from remembrance of events of
9/11 to hope for the future," said Dean for Religious Life
Rev. Scotty McLennan.
To remember Sept. 11, a collection of clips from Sept.
11 cell-phone conversations were played over the loud
speaker. The clips were sung in the Hebrew tradition of
a lamentation chant and were recorded onto a CD by the
National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.
"Mommy, the building's on fire. There is smoke coming
through the walls. I can't breathe. I love you Mommy,
goodbye," chanted the voice over the loudspeaker for
one of the six clips.
"I found it almost unbearable to hear their words and
to know the fate that was about to befall them," said
Assistant Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Dean of
Freshmen & Transfer Students Julie C. Lythcott-Haims,
who attended the service.
"I don't think there was a dry eye in the church after
the lamentation chant," McLennan said. "I heard some
open sobbing. It had a dramatically powerful effect on
people."
Kumar found the chant particularly poignant because
it "let you see everyone affected by Sept. 11 as an indi
vidual, not just as a mass of victims ... and the chant was
followed by a feeling of hope rather than depression."
After the chant, individuals were invited to light can
dles. Some lit a candle to remember lost loved ones,

others for their hometown, and still more for under
standing and peace. Sister Gloria of the campus Catholic
community lit a candle for love.
"I was struck by the fact that the last word of each of the
chants was love," she said. "The last word in life is love, it's
not hate, it's not violence. Our being able to hear that and
speak our words of hope in spite of how tragic the world is
today really struck me and gives me a lot of hope."
After the candle-lighting, the Rev. McLennan invited
people to engage in the Quaker tradition of breaking the
silence. Attendants sat in silence and spoke single words
and phrases if they felt moved to do so.
"Hope, vision, compassion, peace, tolerance," re
called Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann. "These shared
words created a fabric of what we're connected by. I felt
like we united as a community."
The community was quite a bit more intimate than in
past years, said the Rev. Joanne Sanders, Associate
Dean for Religious Life. About 150 people attended the
vigil, significantly less than the thousands who attended
the past two years' services on the Main Quad.
"We decided to have the service in the side chapel of
Memorial Church because we wanted a sense of
intimacy, presuming we wouldn't get the numbers we'd
gotten in the past," McLennan said. "We got hundreds,
rather than thousands."
Senior Caroline Ciccone said she had expected more
people to attend the service.
"I was very surprised by how few people were at the
service, including students, faculty, and staff," she said.
"Maybe it's because I'm from Boston, so 9 /11 was
closer to home."
The deans for religious life said they were unsure of
how many people to expect, especially because classes
were not in session at the time.
Compared to the last two years, said Rabbi Karlin-
Neumann, more people were going about their usual
business this Sept. 11. She said she had six meetings
scheduled that day. Kumar and Ciccone were in
residential staff training for the majority of the day and
attended the service during their lunch break.
"It was really important for people to have an oppor
tunity to leave their daily life and reflect with others both
on what happened and how we are putting our lives to
gether for the future," McLennan said.
