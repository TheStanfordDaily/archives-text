## Who do you really root for? 
### 
Loyalty. It is one of those buzz words that we
ail look for in our friends. We expect people
close to us to support us during the tough
and good times in our lives. This loyalty
does not vary on location or surroundings: It should
transcend our environment.
But what about in sports?
At times a team can be as loyal as a friend. They
are reliable: having a set schedule and (almost) al
ways sticking to it. They can make you jump with
joy, or cry in frustration, but either way they are
never angry at you. Who needs a dog when you have
a baseball team?
But what are you supposed to do when you
move? This was first a problem for me when I came
here during ProFro weekend. In high school, I was a
huge UCLA fan. I went to all of the football games
and a few basketball games each year. I followed the

team religiously, and I will never
forget when the Bruins lost to
Miami in the last game of the
1999 season. I have still not re
covered from the shock.
However, this devotion was
challenged that first weekend on
campus when I found myself at
the UCLA-Stanford tennis
match. Suddenly, I had a dilem
ma. I knew I should root for Stan
ford, but I instinctually found my-

self cheering for the baby blue. How could I so
quickly abandon the Bruins after years of constant
commitment?
I was a man between worlds.
This confusion finally came to a head last year. I
traveled down to the Rose Bowl to cover the Cardi
nal football game for The Daily. After a year and a
half on the Farm, I had figured that I had gotten all
the blue out of my blood.
However, walking into the Rose Bowl caused the
memories of my childhood to come roaring back.
Images of UCLA games of the past became clear in
my head as I relived years of Bruin dedication. At
one point in the game, I couldn't help but smile as I
remembered the time that the old man in front of me
dipped his sweater elbow directly into my nacho
cheese and never noticed.
The Rose Bowl had been my home away from
home for years, and now it was enemy territory.
How can one man handle such emotional pull?
For me, it has become easier with time. I no longer
recognize the names of the Bruin players, and I of
course hope that the Cardinal crushes UCLA every
time. And even though I can still do the eight-clap in
my sleep, I am a Stanford fan through-and-through.
By sophomore year, I had resolved all of my col
legiate sports angst. And with a strong sense of iden
tity I moved to San Francisco for the summer...only
to be crushed again.
It is easy to root for Stanford now. I have been en
grossed in the community for the last few years. But
now my real problem lies with my loyalty to the
Dodgers.
As an L.A. boy, the Dodgers were my team for
years. I watched them consistently fail, trading away
talented players and languishing behind the Giants.
The Dodgers have not even won a playoff game
since the 1988 World Series. And like a true friend I
stuck by their side - cried when they cried, laughed
when they laughed.
So when I moved up to Palo Alto, I assumed
that I would continue to cheer for the Dodgers. I
occasionally watched the A's, but over all I fol
lowed the players in Chavez Ravine. However,
this all changed this summer when I lived in San
Francisco.
Everyone I knew loved the Giants. Every morning
the water coolers buzzed with news of the latest trade
or the latest Bond's homerun. But that didn't phase
my L.A. devotion. I had been around fans of other
teams before and it hadn't affected me much. But
while in The City, I became immersed in San Francis
co culture. I visited almost every part of the city, and I
often watched the Giants games (due to lack of other
options).
So this put me at a crossroads. Should I continue
to root for the Dodgers, even though I have very few
ties left in Los Angeles? Or should I adapt to my sur
roundings, immersing myself in the Bay Area? I
loved the city, so why not be a full-fledged member
of the community?
There is no good answer to this question. I have
several friends who still faithfully follow their teams
from their hometowns, regardless of whether they
can ever see the games on T. V. So while I could re
main a diligent Dodger fan, the question is whether
I have that desire.
So there is my conundrum.
Some loyalties do last forever.
I will always be a Lakers and Stanford fan, regard
less of where I live. I don't know why, but for whatev
er reason I am more invested in these two teams than
I ever was with the Dodgers or Bruins. But I guess in
this respect sports teams are a lot like friends. Some
friends you keep in touch with forever, regardless of
location. But inevitably one loses contact with other
friends, allowing location and environment to over
ride loyalty.
As hundreds of new students arrived on campus
this week, I am sure many have faced the same
dilemma as I once did. How does one keep the loy
alties of an old life while creating new ties in a new
place?
Hmmm...on second thought, maybe a dog isn't
that bad an idea after all.
