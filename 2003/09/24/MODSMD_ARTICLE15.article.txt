# No. 21 Card Set for USF
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Coming off an unexpected loss to unranked Georgia
(5-3-0), the No. 21 women's soccer team (3-3-1) hopes to
bounce back tonight against San Francisco (3-5-0) in a 7
p.m. battle at Maloney field.
In its first seven matches, the Cardinal has boasted one
of the premiere defenses in the nation — a defense that
held soccer powerhouse Notre Dame scoreless in a
marathon double overtime match.
The defense is led by junior All-American goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart, who was named to the All-Tournament

team at the recent Santa Clara / Adidas Classic. She goes
into tonight's match with a 0.55 goals against average on
the season.
Barnhart's defensive unit will be challenged tonight
when it takes on the Dons, who have recorded two high
scoring victories recently. USF managed eight goals in a
match against San Jose State two weeks ago, which is
more goals than Stanford has netted all season.
On the offensive end, the Cardinal has yet to adjust to
the graduation of center forward Marcia Wallis and the
season-ending injury to forward Marcie Ward, a tandem
that combined to lead Stanford into the NCAA quarter
finals last season and a 50-11-3 overall record in the last

three years.
The Don's offensive attack is led by freshman forward
Shuree Hyatt who has notched a team-high five goals in
eight matches.
The Cardinal defense will also have to key in on junior
midfielder Annika Schmidt, who leads the Dons with five
assists.
Schmidt, a recent West Coast Conference Player of
the Week, was red-carded early in USF's last match,
which was ultimately a major factor in the Dons lopsided
loss to Arizona. USF held the lead before Schmidt was

game. The Cardinal are set to face a strong offensive team in San Francisco tonight.
forced to leave the game and the
Wildcats quickly took advantage,
scoring three unanswered goals.
While the Dons have shone of
fensively, Stanford's attack has been
its obvious Achilles's heel, as it was
unable to find the net in its past two
matches.
"We really focused on finishing
in [yesterday's] practice," said
Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "It was a light practice, but it
definitely revolved around finish
ing and executing in goal-scoring
situations. We did well with some
diagonal patterns."
Stanford will present a 4-3-3 for
mation anchored by Barnhart's
goalkeeping.
Tonight the Cardinal defense will
likely start senior Alison Pabon at
right back, redshirt freshman Heidi
Herrick at left back with senior Na
talie Spilger and junior Emilee Shim
rounding out the foursome.
While Pabon remains a probable
starter the amount of time she plays
is highly dependent on the status of a

recent leg contusion that she suf
fered in practice last week.
At midfielder, redshirt senior
Ally Marquand, junior Amy Grady
and senior Brittany Oliveira will get
the starting nod.
Marquand joined Barnhart on
the All-Tournament team at the
Santa Clara / Adidas Classic. Mar
quand, a midfielder, leads the team
in shots with 22, but has connected
only once.
And for the most part, the mid
fielders have been shouldering
much of the offensive load for the
Cardinal. All of Stanford's goals
this season have come off the foot
of a midfielder.
Up front, the Cardinal will start
sophomore Leah Tapscott, junior
Natalie Sanderson and sophomore
Jenny Farenbaugh.
Farenbaugh looks to step up for
the Cardinal offense. She has started
to put more pressure on opposing
defenses, racking up 15 shots.
With the new heightened empha
sis on finishing at the net, Ratcliffe
also has begun to stress the impor
tance of scoring early.
"As the game goes on and we
haven't scored, we get frustrated,"
he said. "And we haven't played well

[when we are frustrated]."
Tonight's game is a must-win for
the Cardinal as a tie or loss to an un
ranked team might spell disaster for
Stanford's national ranking and for
overall team morale.
"I would almost rather face a top
ten team like Notre Dame," Rat
cliffe admitted. "That way, if we
come away with a scoreless-tie, we
still feel good about [the match]."
Although the Dons are un
ranked, Ratcliffe still expects an ex
tremely tough match.
"USF is coming out of the West
Coast Conference, which is very
competitive," he said. "It is going to
be a difficult match for us, especially
if we don't get that early goal."
The Cardinal will be looking for
its forwards to increase their level of
play. Starting forwards Tapscott,
Farenbaugh and Sanderson will at
tempt to jump on the USF defense
from the start.
If the Cardinal converts early,
Ratcliffe plans on playing a posses
sion game.
"We are really looking for that
quick score," Ratcliffe said. "If we
get that, I'm confident we can get the
win by just kicking the ball around to
ourselves for the rest of the match."

(5-3-0), the No. 21 women's soccer team (3-3-1) hopes to
bounce back tonight against San Francisco (3-5-0) in a 7
p.m. battle at Maloney field.
In its first seven matches, the Cardinal has boasted one
of the premiere defenses in the nation — a defense that
held soccer powerhouse Notre Dame scoreless in a
marathon double overtime match.
The defense is led by junior All-American goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart, who was named to the All-Tournament

team at the recent Santa Clara / Adidas Classic. She goes
into tonight's match with a 0.55 goals against average on
the season.
Barnhart's defensive unit will be challenged tonight
when it takes on the Dons, who have recorded two high
scoring victories recently. USF managed eight goals in a
match against San Jose State two weeks ago, which is
more goals than Stanford has netted all season.
On the offensive end, the Cardinal has yet to adjust to
the graduation of center forward Marcia Wallis and the
season-ending injury to forward Marcie Ward, a tandem
that combined to lead Stanford into the NCAA quarter
finals last season and a 50-11-3 overall record in the last

three years.
The Don's offensive attack is led by freshman forward
Shuree Hyatt who has notched a team-high five goals in
eight matches.
The Cardinal defense will also have to key in on junior
midfielder Annika Schmidt, who leads the Dons with five
assists.
Schmidt, a recent West Coast Conference Player of
the Week, was red-carded early in USF's last match,
which was ultimately a major factor in the Dons lopsided
loss to Arizona. USF held the lead before Schmidt was

Senior tri-captain Natalie Spilger has played a key role in the Cardinal's stingy defense. The defender has helped Stanford keep opponents to an average of only 0.55 goals per
game. The Cardinal are set to face a strong offensive team in San Francisco tonight.
forced to leave the game and the
Wildcats quickly took advantage,
scoring three unanswered goals.
While the Dons have shone of
fensively, Stanford's attack has been
its obvious Achilles's heel, as it was
unable to find the net in its past two
matches.
"We really focused on finishing
in [yesterday's] practice," said
Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "It was a light practice, but it
definitely revolved around finish
ing and executing in goal-scoring
situations. We did well with some
diagonal patterns."
Stanford will present a 4-3-3 for
mation anchored by Barnhart's
goalkeeping.
Tonight the Cardinal defense will
likely start senior Alison Pabon at
right back, redshirt freshman Heidi
Herrick at left back with senior Na
talie Spilger and junior Emilee Shim
rounding out the foursome.
While Pabon remains a probable
starter the amount of time she plays
is highly dependent on the status of a

recent leg contusion that she suf
fered in practice last week.
At midfielder, redshirt senior
Ally Marquand, junior Amy Grady
and senior Brittany Oliveira will get
the starting nod.
Marquand joined Barnhart on
the All-Tournament team at the
Santa Clara / Adidas Classic. Mar
quand, a midfielder, leads the team
in shots with 22, but has connected
only once.
And for the most part, the mid
fielders have been shouldering
much of the offensive load for the
Cardinal. All of Stanford's goals
this season have come off the foot
of a midfielder.
Up front, the Cardinal will start
sophomore Leah Tapscott, junior
Natalie Sanderson and sophomore
Jenny Farenbaugh.
Farenbaugh looks to step up for
the Cardinal offense. She has started
to put more pressure on opposing
defenses, racking up 15 shots.
With the new heightened empha
sis on finishing at the net, Ratcliffe
also has begun to stress the impor
tance of scoring early.
"As the game goes on and we
haven't scored, we get frustrated,"
he said. "And we haven't played well

[when we are frustrated]."
Tonight's game is a must-win for
the Cardinal as a tie or loss to an un
ranked team might spell disaster for
Stanford's national ranking and for
overall team morale.
"I would almost rather face a top
ten team like Notre Dame," Rat
cliffe admitted. "That way, if we
come away with a scoreless-tie, we
still feel good about [the match]."
Although the Dons are un
ranked, Ratcliffe still expects an ex
tremely tough match.
"USF is coming out of the West
Coast Conference, which is very
competitive," he said. "It is going to
be a difficult match for us, especially
if we don't get that early goal."
The Cardinal will be looking for
its forwards to increase their level of
play. Starting forwards Tapscott,
Farenbaugh and Sanderson will at
tempt to jump on the USF defense
from the start.
If the Cardinal converts early,
Ratcliffe plans on playing a posses
sion game.
"We are really looking for that
quick score," Ratcliffe said. "If we
get that, I'm confident we can get the
win by just kicking the ball around to
ourselves for the rest of the match."
