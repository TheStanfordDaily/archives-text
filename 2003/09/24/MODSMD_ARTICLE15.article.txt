# No. 21 Card Set for USF
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Coming off an unexpected loss to unranked Georgia
(5-3-0), the No. 21 women's soccer team (3-3-1) hopes to
bounce back tonight against San Francisco (3-5-0) in a 7
p.m. battle at Maloney field.
In its first seven matches, the Cardinal has boasted one
of the premiere defenses in the nation â€” a defense that
held soccer powerhouse Notre Dame scoreless in a
marathon double overtime match.
The defense is led by junior All-American goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart, who was named to the All-Tournament

team at the recent Santa Clara / Adidas Classic. She goes
into tonight's match with a 0.55 goals against average on
the season.
Barnhart's defensive unit will be challenged tonight
when it takes on the Dons, who have recorded two high
scoring victories recently. USF managed eight goals in a
match against San Jose State two weeks ago, which is
more goals than Stanford has netted all season.
On the offensive end, the Cardinal has yet to adjust to
the graduation of center forward Marcia Wallis and the
season-ending injury to forward Marcie Ward, a tandem
that combined to lead Stanford into the NCAA quarter
finals last season and a 50-11-3 overall record in the last

three years.
The Don's offensive attack is led by freshman forward
Shuree Hyatt who has notched a team-high five goals in
eight matches.
The Cardinal defense will also have to key in on junior
midfielder Annika Schmidt, who leads the Dons with five
assists.
Schmidt, a recent West Coast Conference Player of
the Week, was red-carded early in USF's last match,
which was ultimately a major factor in the Dons lopsided
loss to Arizona. USF held the lead before Schmidt was

Senior tri-captain Natalie Spilger has played a key role in the Cardinal's stingy defense. The defender has helped Stanford keep opponents to an average of only 0.55 goals per
game. The Cardinal are set to face a strong offensive team in San Francisco tonight.
