# Emphasis placed on running game

It wasn't the Fun and Gun, but it sure
was fun.
Stanford's sloppy, gritty victory over
Brigham Young on Saturday has the
Cardinal football team off to just its third
2-0 start in the last 17 years. And while
the offense never really got off the
ground against the Cougars, there were
enough signs of improvement to put the
team in high spirits as it prepares for the
start of Pacific 10 Conference play this
weekend.
The win seemed improbable, given
that the Cardinal's 56 passing yards
marked its lowest output ever. When he
was hired last year, head coach Buddy
Teevens was advertised as a purveyor of
the Fun and Gun offense, known for
multiple-receiver sets and an air-it-out
mentality.
But new offensive coordinator David
Kelly said that fans who are waiting to
see the Cardinal rely on an all-out pass
ing assault are likely to be disappointed.
"The people at Stanford better un
derstand we're going to run the foot
ball," Kelly said. "I'm into one thing:
winning. All I know, coming from the
South, is two things win ball games: num
ber one, stopping the run, and number
two, running the football."
It's hard to argue with the results of
Kelly's philosophy so far this season. The
Cardinal has the top-ranked run defense
in the country, allowing a total of four net
rushing yards in its first two games. And
running backs J.R. Lemon and Kenneth
Tolon have each turned in 100-yard

rushing games.
But surely redshirt freshman quarter
back Trent Edwards will need to do a lit
tle better than 25 yards passing if Stan
ford is to have a chance against the
Huskies?
"Whatever the defense gives us, that's
what we're going to go with," Kelly re
sponded.
Against B YU, Edwards was harassed
constantly in the pocket, and rarely had
more than a few seconds to deliver the
ball to his receivers. Some may have ex
pected the Cardinal to use its experi
enced tight ends as safety valves, but se
nior tight end Brett Pierce said he was
needed as a sixth blocker to slow the
Cougar pass rush.
Pierce said he would love to run more
routes against Washington on Saturday,
but only "if they can afford to have me go
out a lot."
Kelly admitted that his young offen
sive line still has much to learn in pass
blocking, another reason that the ground
game has been more successful so far.
But Pierce said he has seen significant
improvement since spring practice.
"They're definitely coming along," he
said. "Just because they're young guys
doesn't mean they can't play."
While Stanford won't likely see blitz
packages as complex as those that BYU
ran all game, Washington's big front four
will likely pose another tough matchup
for the linemen. But judging from the at
titude in practice yesterday, the Cardinal
believes it can rise to the occasion.
"Everybody's real excited about the

Redshirt freshman quarterback Trent Edwards took most of the first team snaps in Tuesday's practice. He
was victorious in his first start for the Cardinal as it beat BYU 18-14 on Saturday.
