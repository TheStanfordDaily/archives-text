# Polo plays home opener
## Mens team hopes to rebound from USC 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Brains and brawn will unite for Stanford spectators
today in the men's water polo home opener. The team
expects a large crowd to fill the Avery Aquatic Complex
at 7 p.m. as the Cardinal hosts the Brigham Young-
Hawaii Seasiders in a non-conference game.
Stanford (4-1) placed second at the Southern Califor
nia Tournament in Irvine last weekend, losing 10-9 in sud
den-death overtime to Southern California with which it
shared the top national ranking. The Cardinal will likely
be ranked second in this week's national poll. BYU-
Hawaii (1-0) has a relatively young program. Water polo
was added as a varsity sport in the 2001 season and the
Seasiders are currently ranked No. 17 in the nation.
Tonight's game will be the first opportunity for the
Cardinal to showcase its new lineup to a local crowd.
"We're really excited to play our first home game,"
said Stanford head coach John Vargas. "We're expecting
a good turnout. We've been training for almost a month
now and we haven't had any games at home so we'll be
pretty excited and fired-up to play."
Vargas said he thinks this game will be especially ex
citing for the freshman class since the Axe Committee
will be in attendance with their famous train whistle.
"If they haven't heard the train whistle, they will hear
it," Vargas said with a laugh.
Vargas remains positive about the team's perfor
mance in the SoCal tournament despite the loss.
"I think we started out playing just okay water polo
and we finished playing very good water polo," he said.
"Each player has maybe one or two things he can im
prove on slightly, which is good news.
"We lost in sudden-death overtime and we didn't
even play our best game. I think that's a positive. We
take [home] more from this loss, maybe, than if we had

won the game," Vargas said.
In fact, the loss to the Trojans has given the Cardinal
a renewed drive. Prior to yesterday's practice, junior
driver Tony Azevedo urged his teammates to give their
all during practice.
"We need to be going 110 percent right here," Azeve
do said. "It can't be about just making it through practice
... you need to be pushing yourself."
Vargas stressed that several members of the team
have been turning in solid performances so far this year.
Eleven different Stanford players have already scored at
least one goal this season. Sophomore drivers Peter
Varellas and Thomas Hopkins lead the team with 12 and
11 goals, respectively. Sophomore goalie Chad Taylor
has tallied 35 saves in five starts.
"Spreading out the goals is a great thing, because you
just can't focus on one person," said Vargas. "We know
that Tony [Azevedo] will always have a great game, but
what's impressive is Peter Varellas, Thomas Hopkins,
Mike Derse, Greg Crum — all these guys are coming
and adding goals to the score column."
The Cardinal has three focus points for improving its
game: more individual position defense, dictating the
tempo of the game and making a commitment to team
tactics on offense.
The Seasiders opened their season Sept. 13 with an
18-2 victory over Chaminade. The high scorers for that
game were freshman Douglas Turley with four goals and
Yugoslavian junior Vanja Kalabic with three. The BYU-
Hawaii team itself is a bit of a mystery for Stanford.
"I know that they have some foreign players on their
team so they'll have a couple seasoned guys playing,"
said Vargas. "They have a real big goalie who's been
playing particularly well."
BYU-Hawaii is making a tour of the Bay Area with a
game against the Cardinal tonight and California tomor
row. They'll be playing in the UC Santa Cruz "Slugfest"
Invitational this weekend, as well.
Vargas describes the play of the freshmen as great,
though only two meter JJ Garton has had a significant
amount of playing time.
"We're hoping to put a couple more of the freshmen in,
but we'll see how things go," Vargas said.
