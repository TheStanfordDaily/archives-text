Robot searches for life on Earth
NASA has been testing a new robot that
will eventually search for life on Mars. The
robot is called Hyperion and is being tested in
the Atacama Desert in Chile, one of the most
inhospitable places on Earth. There, as on
Mars, intense ultraviolet radiation from the
sun and strong soil oxidants combine to quick
ly degrade organic molecules.
Hyperion was previously tested in the
rocky terrain of Devon Island in the northern
Canadian Arctic. Its life-sensors use fluores
cent dyes to detect compounds common in liv
ing organisms such as DNA, carbohydrates,
and lipids. The results of the Atacama testing
will help develop better prototypes in 2004
and 2005.
It's what's on the inside that counts
The American Association of Medicine
warns: heart disease is the number one killer
of women. More than 500,000 women die
each year in the United States of cardiovas
cular disease, whereas breast cancer claims
40,000 lives. Several Women typically start
showing symptoms in their 60s — about 10
years after men.
However, there are subtle differences in
how their system responds to stress, hor
mones, saturated fat and toxins like tobacco
that suggest a higher vulnerability than men.
Doctors also tend to treat men more aggres
sively than women because heart disease is
still thought of as primarily a male disease.
The best remedy is prevention — a healthier
life-style consisting of better food, regular ex
ercise, and no smoking.
Canadians discover how to produce light
Optical computer chips use photons in
stead of electrons as their mode of communi
cation. This is just an idea now, but with a new
plastic from University of Toronto, it may
soon become a reality. The scientists used a
hybrid plastic that can produce light at wave
lengths used by fiber optics.
"Our study is the first to demonstrate ex
perimentally that we can convert electrical
current into light using a particularly promis
ing class of nanocrystals," says Ted Sargent,
lead investigator. Essentially the plastic uses a
special layer of molecules around a nanocrys
tal that can covert electrons into photons.
Light can carry the most amount of informa
tion so these chips would cause a revolution in
chip building.
Maybe he was looking for the bathroom
Last month Scientific American published
an article by Dickson et al. commemorating
the discovery of Otzi, the best-preserved pre
historic human. Otzi was found in 1991 3,500
meters up in the snowy Alps on the Italian-
Swiss border. Several archaeological and an
thropological studies since then have discov
ered a lot about him.
Otzi is believed to be a 46-year old male
who died 5,000 years ago as a result of wounds
from an arrow. Much of his gear, including
tools like an axe, have given insights into how
Neolithic humans might have lived. Pollen,
seeds, mosses and fungi found both inside and
outside the body reveal his diet consisted
mostly of wheat, plants and meat. One big
question that remains unanswered is what
Otzi was doing so high up in the Alps. Dickson
et al. wrote "We see that much careful re
search still needs to be done."
Fort Knox better have a roof
Physicists from Nottingham University
have been experimenting with magnetic levi
tation by experimenting with temperatures
and magnetic fields. Among their major ac
complishments, using cold oxygen they have
levitated gold, platinum and diamonds.
Liquid oxygen (below 183 C) can provide
greater buoyancy force. For magnetic levita
tion, objects must have special magnetic prop
erties that create enough force to balance the
object's weight. Besides the theoretical value
of understanding this natural phenomenon,
there are numerous practical applications —
think bullet trains for one.
Humans were easy, now we will try with fish
Craig Venter's new project is to sequence
an entire ecosystem — the Sargasso Sea. Ven
ter is most famous for being the leading scien
tist in the Human Genome Project. This new,
$9 million project is being funded by the U.S.
Dept of Energy and hopes to sequence the
genomes of every organism to be found in the
Atlantic Ocean from the West Indies past
Bermuda and on to the Azores.
The project might help explain why the re
gion is so devoid of life - or whether it is as
empty of life as it seems to be, according to
Venter. His team was highly successful in the
Human Genome Project because they divided
the sequencing work between several auto
mated machines. They hope to use the same
methods in this new project.
