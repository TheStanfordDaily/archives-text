# Surfing in troubled waters
## Record biz cracks down on file sharing 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITERS 
You thought you were safe. You
thought you here hidden. You
thought that the electronic faceless
ness of the Internet was like that blue,
fuzzy security blanket you dragged
along at the age of two. But then the
Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA) began to sue file
swappers,- and the ugly and ominous
shark's fin of legal prosecution started
lurking in our lives.
That shark reared up out of the
water and bit four students at eastern
universities last April, making them
the initial victims in one of the first
battles of the electronic age.
The students — two at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute and one each at
Princeton University and Michigan
Technological University — eventu
ally settled with the RIAA for sums
ranging between $12,500 and $17,500.
So as you are imagining that omi
nous fin approaching, you might be
wondering: Are Stanford students at
risk? And what is the University
gonna do when the big, bad RIAA
comes-a-knockin' ?
To address these and other questions,
the Residential Computing (ResComp)
staff compiled an extensive FAQ sheet
to inform students on the University's
policy on file-sharing. The FAQ sheet
can be found at http://rescomp.stan
ford.edu/info/dmca/.
Even though rumors might have
you shaking in your boots, don't run
home to uninstall Kazaa just yet.

Richard Holeton, the head of ResComp, points out that the RIAA and other copy
right owners have no way of obtaining a student's personal information without sub
poenaing the University.
"They can't [discover a student's identity]," Holeton said, "because the [Internet
Service Provider] is the one who knows what IP address goes with what person."
Instead, the RIAA, Motion Picture Association of America and other copyright
owners lodge formal complaints with the University when they find that a student has
been illegally swapping files — complaints that the University is required by law to
address.
According to the ResComp Web site, once the University receives a complaint it
issues a warning to the student demanding that he remove the illegal file cited in the
complaint. If a student fails to respond within 24 hours, his Internet connection is ter
minated until he complies.
Other schools adopt a much harsher line. The University of San Diego blocks

Kazaa from its servers, and Cornell,
the University of Colorado and the
University at Albany all charge fees
to reconnect the Internet for stu
dents that have had their accounts
terminated.
Nonetheless, things may be
changing at Stanford. The Rescomp
FAQ sheet notes that "the number
of complaints that Stanford receives
per day has grown exponentially
over the past few years."
"Over the past five days we have
received five DMCA complaints,"
said Sandy Senti, an executive direc
tor at Information Technology Sys
tems and Services, referring to the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
To manage this increase, Infor
mation Security Services, which
processes the complaints, has al
ready hired an additional full-time
staff member to handle the com
plaints, and may hire yet another to
deal with terminating Internet con
nections. Speculation abounds that
this turn of events has been pro
pelled by the University's desire to
provide jobs for its fresh-faced CS
grads.
But what really haunts the night
mares of campus computer users is
the possibility of being hauled into
court by irate RIAA lawyers.
For this to happen, copyright
owners must first issue a subpoena
to the University in order to find
out the identity of the copyright vi
olator, as happened with the four
students were caught in April.
"As of last Friday we hadn't
received any [subpoenas]" said
Patrick Dunkley, a lawyer at the
University General Counsel's
Office.
Both Boston College and
MIT successfully challenged
subpoenas issued to discover the
identity of the their students.
However, they won their case by
means of a logistical error on the

part of the lawyers at the RIAA.
What was not addressed in the case was whether or not the RIAA's actions vio
lated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which protects students' per
sonal information from being released without their permission.
Stanford, as of yet, has not had to deal with the question of whether or not to chal
lenge a subpoena from copyright owners.
"If we receive a valid subpoena, we will generally comply with that subpoena," said
Debra Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel. "If there was a defect in the subpoena or
it is overboard, then we would try to work it out or, if necessary, challenge the im
proper aspects of the subpoena."
When the time comes, which it looks like it might — since the RIAA no longer
even balks at suing 12-year-olds — Stanford will have to make a decision whether to
protect its students, or deliver them into the sweaty palms of record company execu
tives.
