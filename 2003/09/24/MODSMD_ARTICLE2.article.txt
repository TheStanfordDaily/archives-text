# Janitors return to standard work week

Student Housing Services decid
ed to change custodian services in
residences from six to five days a
week, according to an e-mail from a
University official.
According to Rodger Whitney,
Executive Director of Student Hous
ing Services, the changes were solely
due to the custodial staff's prefer
ence for working Monday through
Friday. Previously, some janitors had
worked Tuesday through Saturday
or other irregular schedules.
"These changes have absolutely
nothing to do with budget cuts," said
Rodger Whitney Executive Director
of Student Housing Services
Manager for Undergraduate
Housing Operations Imogen
Church has confirmed this, saying
that the budget for the 2002-03 and
2003-04 school years are "absolutely
the same."
Last school year, the six-day
cleaning schedule was created to im
prove cleanliness in dorms, especial
ly in restrooms, by having a regular
cleaning shift over the weekend. The
effort was well received by the stu
dent body.
"Fridays and Saturday nights are
when the dorms get really dirty and
if work isn't done earlier it's just
going to be harder to clean up on
Monday," sophomore Vinnet Bagh
wat said.
However, the complex nature of
the scheduling and the availability of
the staff created many issues, which
were difficult to resolve. Some custo
dial staff preferred to work a regular
five-day week but were forced by the
six-day plan to work an irregular one,
with days off in the middle of the week.
There are currently no plans to try the
six-day cleaning schedule again.

Students from a variety of hous
ing ranging from Row Houses to all
freshman dorms agree that such a
cut in custodial staff cleaning sched
ule would affect the cleanliness of
their dorms.
"[The dorms] might also run out of
paper in the dispensers during the week
ends," freshman Jason Huynh said.
A number of students who have
experienced the five-day cleaning
schedule tell of overflowing garbage
bins and fetid restrooms. Church
notes, however, that the staff clean
ing is conducted in the mornings and
afternoons whereas most of the
cleanliness issues usually arise at
night after the staff have left. Thus,
the resulting hygiene of the dorm re
mains largely unchanged.
According to Lisa Thornton,
housing supervisor at Wilbur Hall,
the six-day work schedule involved
half the regular staff coming in on
Saturday. Then on Monday the
other half of the regular staff who
took Saturday off would come in to
clean the dormitories.
Though the number of staff on
these two days was reduced, senior
Mercedes Roy thought the schedule
worked.
"They still did a good job of keep
ing the place clean," she said.
Though issues of pay, overtime
and union contracts and agreements
are confidential by nature, Church
said that due to certain contractual
clauses the shifting of staff over the
weekends came at no extra cost and
no extra overtime pay was neces
sary.
In response to student concerns,
Whitney suggested that students
should have "more respect for the
place that they five in" and that they
should take an active part in keeping
their residences clean.

work a traditional Monday-through-Friday week.
