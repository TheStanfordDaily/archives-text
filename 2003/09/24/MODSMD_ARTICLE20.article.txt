# Answer girl explains new Essential Stanford CD
## 
### BONTTA SONG ANSWER GIRL 
What is this essential software CD my RCC is push
ing on me, and why is it important?
AL • Glad you asked, you oblivious freshman. As any up
perclassman will tell you, Essential Stanford Software
(ESS) is a software package distributed annually to all
Stanford students by Information Technology Systems
and Services and Residential Computing. This free CD
conveniently contains all the most essential applications
for your room computer at Stanford — that way, you can
focus your precious web time on downloading music and
porn. Great, right? Now you know.

But there's something special about
this year's ESS. Normally, installing ESS is
pretty optional — you still get hooked up
(I mean, your computer does), even if you
don't touch the CD. Besides, most people
already have some of the so-named "es
sentials" — like Internet Explorer — in
stalled on their computer. As for other CD
software — like Eudora —it might be
convenient, but it's hardlv essential.

But this year's ESS really does live up to its name. Be
sides the usual stuff, it provides protection for vulnerable
computers — any PC operating on Windows NT, 2000 or
XP — against recent strains of virus, including the famous
Sobig.F and Blaster worms. While there have always been
viruses around, this summer University network security

was shocked by the sheer viciousness of this year's crop:
spreading faster and uglier than pimples on a geek's back,
as many as 40 percent of the computers at Stanford had
been attacked by summer's end.
This special addition explains why you've probably
heard some of the upperclassmen complaining about how
long it was taking to set up an in-room connection: before,
without the long virus-scanning step, connection had al
ways been a five-minute affair.
At the moment opinions are mixed about the future of
such mandatory anti-virus installations. Depending on which
Residential Computer Consultant you talk to, estimates
range from "this'll probably be the last year they do this" to
"this could go on indefinitely." But all agree when it comes to
the Internet at Stanford: If you want to get some, be sure to
have protection.
