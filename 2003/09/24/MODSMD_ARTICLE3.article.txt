# Row, Branner renovated
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
From facelifts at Theta Delta Chi, Kappa
Sigma and 680 Lomita to a Branner
makeover, $29 million of renovated housing
greeted the students who moved in this
year.
The housing renovations were scheduled
as part of the Capital Improvement Pro
gram, a $185 million Residential and Dining
Enterprises project now in its eleventh year.
By 2010, renovation of all existing graduate
and undergraduate housing and the con
struction of new graduate housing should be
completed.
"We have brought Branner back to the
grandeur of when it was first built," said Ex
ecutive Director of Student Housing

Rodger Whitney. "It has been restored and
made better ready for the next generation
of Stanford freshman."
"It's kind of like a resort," said freshman
Carly York, a resident in Branner. "I like
the architecture and the stone stairs."
The $20 million renovation of Branner
began last September and was completed in
June. Youth athletic camps occupied the
dorm in the summer and this fall the doors
opened to 176 students, happily surprised
by their new residence.
"I did not expect something this nice,"
said freshman Jeremy Zallen, also a Bran
ner resident. "I like all the facilities, the
good quality furniture and that the rooms
are two-room triples."
Improvements in Branner include new
plumbing and electrical wiring, a rebuilt

roof, a seismic upgrade and a brand-new
kitchen. A new interior courtyard and a bar
becue area were also created. Rooms have
new furniture, bathrooms have been redone
and the whole dorm has new paint, lighting
and carpet.
The lounge area is lined with French
doors and has benches and armchairs up
holstered with plush fabric. There are also
new study rooms, kitchenettes, an upgraded
laundry room and an expanded computer
cluster.
Also improved is the restored dining
hall, expanded servery and new kitchen.
The dining hall is truly a hall, "Harry Potter
style" as described by one resident, with a
high ceiling, tall windows, light fixtures and
shiny new appearance.
Whitney said that because of the histori

cal aspects of the 80-year-old building it was
more of a challenge to renovate.
The overall response to the renovations,
according to Whitney, has been very posi
tive, especially from alumni and student
staff of Branner who had lived in Branner
previously.
While Branner's renovation was exten
sive and elaborate, the improvements of
Theta Delt, Kappa Sig, both fraternities and
680 Lomita, a self-op Row house, are a little
more subtle. Many of the changes went on
"behind the walls," with improved and re
stored infrastructure or involved upgrading
things like carpet and paint.
"It was a very substantial and thorough
renovation," Whitney said. "On the outside

what you'll see is a refreshed, re
newed and newer looking house."
"The house is in an amazing
shape, and all the work that was put
into it really shows," said sophomore
Michael Zell, who lives in Theta
Delt.
The three houses, which each
have about 60 residents, were reno
vated over the summer for a total
cost of $9 million.
The CIP program has a standard
prototype for housing that is adjust
ed for each house, taking into ac
count different architectures, needs
and traditions. Particular to the
three houses renovated this summer,
Whitney said, is that they were all
designed by an architect in the six
ties, making it a pleasure to restore
that aspect of their design. Whitney
said that residents of houses being
renovated, especially RFs and RAs,
get a substantial amount of input in
the process.
While most residents said their
houses looked nice and appreciated
the renovation and new cleanliness,
some of the fraternity residents feel
that the original characters of the
houses were not completely pre
served. Many mentioned a sterile

feeling.
"While it definitely felt more like
'our house' before, I do appreciate
the work and care that the university
has put into it," said junior Robby
Kittleson, who is living in Kappa Sig
for his second year. "Hopefully it
will feel more like home as time pass
es."
"It's so bare," said sophomore
Joey Pirolo, also in Kappa Sig.
"They did a hotel package
makeover," citing the paint being
very white and the feeling of a
"cheesy, cheap hotel lounge."
"Some of the design changes are
somewhat incongruent with how our
house has operated in years past,"
Zell said.
Whitney described the changes in
the three Row houses as a typical
CIP renovation. To improve safety,
the houses received seismic up
grades, new sprinklers and fire
alarms. To make the houses nicer
and "more livable" they received
new kitchen equipment, new study
spaces and the renovation and re
configuration of common spaces and
some student rooms. To update the
house, carpet, wiring and lights were
upgraded, walls were painted and
landscaping and groundwork was
done.
While the work done was more
of an upgrade rather than a
makeover, Whitney said it gives
the houses "newly-found life" and

makes them ready for 20 to 30
more years of wear and tear by stu
dents.
"It's very fresh and clean," said
sophomore and 680 Lomita resident
Diego Martin of his residence.
"Overall, it feels like living in a
brand new house." Martin described
the house previously as being dirty
and the bathrooms being antiquat
ed.
"It's much brighter since the dark
wood paneling has been replaced by
white walls," Zell said about Theta
Delt. "The couches in the lounges
are really nice, and the kitchen has a
nice open feel to it."
Martin and Pirolo both liked the
exterior and landscaping work done.
Sophomore Krysti Garcia, who lives
in 680 Lomita, said, "The new carpet
lets me walk around barefoot, the
walls are clean and the bathroom im
provements are amazing. The new
shower stalls are great."
One interesting change to the
bathrooms has been the removal of
urinals - much to the annoyance of
some fraternity members.
"For an all-male house, this is
kind of weird and inconvenient. And
it wastes water," Zell said.
Next on the CIP schedule is for
Florence Moore to receive seismic
improvements and other work as
well as for Escondido Village high
rises Blackwelder and Quillen to be
upgraded next summer.
