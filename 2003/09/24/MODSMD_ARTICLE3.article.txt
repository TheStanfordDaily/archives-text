# Row, Branner renovated

### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
From facelifts at Theta Delta Chi, Kappa
Sigma and 680 Lomita to a Branner
makeover, $29 million of renovated housing
greeted the students who moved in this
year.
The housing renovations were scheduled
as part of the Capital Improvement Pro
gram, a $185 million Residential and Dining
Enterprises project now in its eleventh year.
By 2010, renovation of all existing graduate
and undergraduate housing and the con
struction of new graduate housing should be
completed.
"We have brought Branner back to the
grandeur of when it was first built," said Ex
ecutive Director of Student Housing

Rodger Whitney. "It has been restored and
made better ready for the next generation
of Stanford freshman."
"It's kind of like a resort," said freshman
Carly York, a resident in Branner. "I like
the architecture and the stone stairs."
The $20 million renovation of Branner
began last September and was completed in
June. Youth athletic camps occupied the
dorm in the summer and this fall the doors
opened to 176 students, happily surprised
by their new residence.
"I did not expect something this nice,"
said freshman Jeremy Zallen, also a Bran
ner resident. "I like all the facilities, the
good quality furniture and that the rooms
are two-room triples."
Improvements in Branner include new
plumbing and electrical wiring, a rebuilt

roof, a seismic upgrade and a brand-new
kitchen. A new interior courtyard and a bar
becue area were also created. Rooms have
new furniture, bathrooms have been redone
and the whole dorm has new paint, lighting
and carpet.
The lounge area is lined with French
doors and has benches and armchairs up
holstered with plush fabric. There are also
new study rooms, kitchenettes, an upgraded
laundry room and an expanded computer
cluster.
Also improved is the restored dining
hall, expanded servery and new kitchen.
The dining hall is truly a hall, "Harry Potter
style" as described by one resident, with a
high ceiling, tall windows, light fixtures and
shiny new appearance.
Whitney said that because of the histori

cal aspects of the 80-year-old building it was
more of a challenge to renovate.
The overall response to the renovations,
according to Whitney, has been very posi
tive, especially from alumni and student
staff of Branner who had lived in Branner
previously.
While Branner's renovation was exten
sive and elaborate, the improvements of
Theta Delt, Kappa Sig, both fraternities and
680 Lomita, a self-op Row house, are a little
more subtle. Many of the changes went on
"behind the walls," with improved and re
stored infrastructure or involved upgrading
things like carpet and paint.
"It was a very substantial and thorough
renovation," Whitney said. "On the outside
