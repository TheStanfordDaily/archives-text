# Writing requirement stretched to 2 quarters

### JESSICA HANLEY 
Beginning this year, the Program
in Writing and Rhetoric will expect
students to fulfill new requirements
that the Faculty Senate approved two
years ago.
These requirements mandate that
all incoming freshmen take two quar
ters of Writing and Rhetoric — one
quarter of PWR 1 during the first
year, and another quarter of Writing
and Rhetoric 2 anytime before the
end of the second year, regardless of
Advanced Placement credit.
"Research on writing shows that
progress develops over time," said
Associate Director of PWR Marvin
Diogenes.
According to Diogenes, the sec
ond quarter of Writing and Rhetoric,
along with the Writing in the Major
requirement, hopes to fill the gap that
develops between freshmen writing
classes and senior honors theses.
The changes began developing
during the 2000-01 school year when
the Writing Review Committee eval
uated the existing program of either
one or two quarters of PWR, depend
ing on Advanced Placement credit.
During the review the committee met
with several groups of undergradu
ates and recorded their discussions re
garding the writing requirement. A
Student Advisory Board was also
formed to aid in the improvement of
the program and suggest new topics
for classes. After a year of weighing
student and faculty opinions, the pro
posed changes were passed to the
Faculty Senate for approval and are
finally being put into action.
Some freshmen seemed positive
about the extended requirement.
"College writing is really different,
so two quarters would be good for me
to get used to it," said freshman Flo
Chau.

Although the new quarters of
Writing and Rhetoric are often re
ferred to as PWR 1 and PWR 2, they
are significantly different from the
PWR 1 and 2 classes of previous
years. The new PWR 1 will be compa
rable to the former PWR 3 —it is
worth four units and requires several
demanding writing assignments, in
cluding a research paper.
The WR 2 classes will benefit from
the work done in PWR 1, but will focus
more on the multimedia presenta
tions. Students will be encouraged to
choose research topics that relate to
their interests or majors and may take
WR 2 through specific departments.
A focus of the class will be to address
different audiences and present pro
jects in an effective an engaging man
ner.
"[WR 2] provides time for presen
tations to go through parallel stages as
papers," Diogenes said.
According to Andrea Lunsford,
the director of PWR and professor of
a WR 2 class, writing encompasses a
number of media.
"Writing is so much more than
words on a screen," she said.
Both Lunsford and Diogenes ex
pressed that the presentation can be
as important as the information itself,
and they want to arm students with
the ability to convey information in a
world where paper is being replaced
by technology.
Another change is the addition of
honors PWR 1 and WR 2 classes. The
honors sections, which Lunsford and
Diogenes consider "experimental,"
will be completely voluntary, and
there is no prerequisite to sign up for
them. While the coursework will be
the same as other sections, the expec
tations in honors classes will likely be
higher due to the standards the stu
