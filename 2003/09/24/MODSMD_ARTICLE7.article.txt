Orientation went out with a big bang last
night with the O-Show, an exhibition of dance
and a cappella at Memorial Auditorium-which
drew a nearly packed crowd of cheering fresh
men.
The event lasted for about 90 minutes.
From the quintet of soulful football players,
to Fleet Street's haunting

Gregorian chant and march of candles, to the
vocal percussion of the Harmonics and to Urban
Style's choreographed rendition of "Chicago,"
the O-Show proved a welcome setting for both
the ambitious artists and casual observers in the
audience.
Senior Eric Lowe, a member of Testimony,
said he could feel the nervous energy rising from
his a cappella group as they approached the
stage.

"The audience was very receptive," Lowe
said, in a burst of pride. "Everyone always brings
out the best at these shows. Stanford's a cappel
la groups are very good about not competing
heavily. We emphasize selling our own group,
not pressuring other groups."
Senior student Chiara Cortez of Talisman
also expressed her stand that her group func
tioned spiritually as a family, and that cama
raderie and mingling were significant in the

group.
Junior Matan Shacham of Fleet Street said
the event was less of a competition than a
chance for the groups to showcase their tal
ents.
"When we're formal, we tend to strengthen
our comical effects, and vice versa," Shacham
said. "We're committed to presenting a wide va
riety of styles so that we give everyone the op
portunity to see what we have to offer."
