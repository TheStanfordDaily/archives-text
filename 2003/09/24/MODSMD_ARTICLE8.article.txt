# The 						Stanford Daily Editorials
## Time to go class shopping 
### 
Today is the first day of classes. After a
summer of lounging on the beach,
students will crack open fresh text
books, open their binders and note
books, and begin crowding into lecture halls.
Although, in the past, some University officials
have advocated moving away from Stanford's
traditional two-week shopping period for class
es, we strongly endorse this campus institution
and hope it lives on long into the future.
Stanford's shopping period is unique among
America's top universities. It permits students
to try out courses before they commit to listen
ing to a professor lecture for 10 weeks.
Just as Stanford offers thousands of different
courses in scores of departments each quarter,
the style of each class shopper varies greatly.
For those students who are shopping courses
for the first time, we offer a few bits of advice:
Serial Shoppers are the reason lecture halls
are flooded at the beginning of each quarter.
These students shop till they drop — meaning
11 courses at the beginning of each quarter that
are narrowed down to six within a week. These
student buy all the course books before the first
day of class, which prompts a textbook short
age, because they keep them all after they de
cide which courses they will actually enroll in,
and continue to attend three additional cours
es as "auditors."
When these students write research pa
pers, they schedule their rough-draft due
dates as carefully as Federal Aviation Admin
istration controllers pack planes as they de
scend to a major metropolitan airport. They e
mail their professors first and second drafts,
use the comments to fix the paper and finish
first quarter with a 4.1 Grade Point
Average — courtesy of that A+ in their Pro

gram in Writing and Rhetoric course.
Do not try to be a serial shopper. Time is a
valuable commodity at Stanford.
Off-campus Shoppers , on the other hand,
spend the first week of school shopping — at
the Stanford Shopping Center. Although tech
nically on the Stanford campus, students who
spend the shopping period at this institution are
not properly using this two-week grace period.
At 11:52 p.m. the night before class lists are
due on Axess, these shoppers can be found in
their dorm's computer clusters — perhaps
sporting brand-new sweaters from J. Crew.
They have only attended two classes in the past
two weeks, and are confused about the e-mail
their PWR teacher sent them informing them
that they had been dropped from the class.
Do not be this kind of shopper. You didn't
work hard in high school to slack off now.
Strategic Shoppers use the two-week shop
ping period to attend a manageable number of
classes and to make an educated decision about
which they would prefer to attend. After a
week, these shoppers have settled on the three
or four classes they plan to continue attending,
and have already immersed themselves in their
studies. Without the worry of having to choose
between unseen courses at the last minute,
these shoppers have been able to keep up with
the workload in all of the courses they plan to
take.
This is the ideal way to use the shopping
period.
When choosing classes in the next two
weeks, plan wisely. The shopping period is a
privilege that should be valued by Stanford
students.
