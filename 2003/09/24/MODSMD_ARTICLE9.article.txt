# Who is in charge of discipline?
## 
### 
Do you know who Chris Griffith is? If
not, don't worry. Neither do most of
your peers. Griffith is the interim
dean of students. She has served in
that capacity since Marc Wais, Stanford's long
serving dean of students, departed for New
York University last March.
Wais, known for his love of Stanford athlet
ics and his years as the resident fellow in Ju
nipero, kept a high profile during his years at
Stanford. He had a recognizable presence on
campus, and during his tenure students knew
who to go to with their concerns.
Griffith, on the other hand, has kept a low pro
file in her role as interim dean. While her dedica
tion to Stanford is unimpeachable, her low-profile
management of the Dean of Students Office has
left many students confused about who is in
charge of student discipline and activities at this
University. This confusion is not Griffith's fault —
we believe she is trying her hardest to make sure
the dean's office continues to function well in the
absence of a permanent leader — but is rather the
fault of a lack of articulation of duties in the Office
of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
In his last days at the University, Wais told
The Daily that whenever there is a departure in
upper-level management, it creates an oppor

tunity to reshuffle portfolios. While some
change within the vice provost's office may
bring fresh perspective to the office, the current
organization is difficult to navigate — even by
the best informed and most proactive students.
In the void left by Wais's departure, Associ
ate Dean of Students Morris Graves, Dean of
Freshmen and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott
Haims and Griffith have all stepped up to the
plate. But this trifecta of leaders with their ap
parently ill-defined roles is not ultimately ef
fective. The fact that no single person seems to
be ultimately in charge of student discipline —
save Gene Awakuni, the vice provost of stu
dent affairs, who is also responsible for hous
ing, dining and student hfe among other duties
— precludes much progress in that area.
Awakuni and his staff tried to find a qualified
permanent replacement for the dean of students
before the end of last academic year, but, oddly
enough, said that none of the candidates met the
necessary criteria. As the months drag on with
out a permanent leader in the dean's office, the
void left by Wais is beginning to become more
noticeable. While Griffith is an asset to the Uni
versity, she can only hold down the fort for so
long in her role as interim dean; temporary solu
tions only solve short-term problems.
