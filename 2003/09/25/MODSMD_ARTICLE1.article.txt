## Hospital workers protest layoffs 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Protestors gathered outside the
entrance of Stanford Hospital yes
terday afternoon to protest the re
cent layoff of over 100 hospital em
ployees.
Chanting slogans like, "Stan
ford, Stanford, can't you see? We
need job security," and "Hey ho,
Hey ho, subcontracting has got to
go," Stanford Hospital employees,
along with Stanford University em
ployees, students and community
members, expressed their outrage.
On Oct. 16,90 nursing assistants will
be laid off while another 20 jobs will be
lost due to further subcontracting.
AB 394, a new law passed by Cal
ifornia, requires that hospitals in
crease their nurse to patient ratio.
The law was passed over concern
that patients are not receiving quali
ty care due to a lack of hospital staff.
Stanford Hospital claims that AB
394 is requiring the elimination of
nursing assistant positions. In place
of the nursing assistants, the hospital
plans to hire registered nurses.
However, Services Employees
International Union Local 715, the
labor union that represents the hos
pital workers, claims that Stanford
Hospital is circumventing the intent
of the law.
Senior Meghana Reddy, one of
the union's representatives and or
ganizers of the protest, said, "The
purpose of AB 394 is to increase
overall staffing hours. By laying off
these workers and hiring new ones,
Stanford is merely trying to find a
way around the law. They are
putting profits before quality care."
Last year, Stanford Hospital
generated $12.5 million in revenues.
It is the only hospital in the Bay
Area that is laying off workers in re
sponse to the new law.
In negotiations last week, SEIU
and the hospital came to two agree

ments. The first agreement is that
the hospital will allow voluntary
rather than mandatory layoffs. This
means that those workers who do
not mind losing their jobs have the
option of volunteering to be laid off
and they will then receive severance
pay as compensation, which is
preferable to quitting and receiving
nothing. Those who voluntarily offer
to be laid off take the place of those
who need the job in order to support
themselves and their families.
Second, the hospital will provide

educational assistance of $1000 a
year to laid off workers. However,
some workers feel that this is not
enough compensation for the loss of
their job.
Farida Aziz, one of the nursing
assistants who has been laid off by
the hospital, said, "They say they
will give me money to go take
classes, but I'm five months preg
nant and I have to support my
three children as the main source
of income for the family. I can't af
ford to pay for health insurance

anymore, either."
Aziz started her career as a nurse
in Pakistan, where she dressed infec
tions and performed small surgeries.
She was featured in National Geo
graphic magazine for helping war
wounded in Afghanistan.
In addition to being concerned
about supporting her own family, she
expressed her concern for the pa
tients. "I'm worried that the patients
will not be receiving enough atten
tion now that they have decreased
the size of the staff," she said.
