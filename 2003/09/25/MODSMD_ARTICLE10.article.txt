## OP-ED California's algebra crisis 
### PAUL CLOPTON BILL EVERS 
California has had its
share of educational
crises such as whole lan-,
guage and fuzzy math.
Despite recent improvements, the
state is still in the grips of an alge
bra crisis.
The problem became apparent
twenty years ago when the report
"A Nation at Risk" warned of a
"rising tide of mediocrity" in the
public schools. The report claimed
that too few students were taking
the more rigorous courses in high
school. Twenty years later, enroll
ment in college-prep courses is
way up. Unfortunately, evidence
indicates that student learning is
about the same as it was back then.
Recent reports have stressed
the importance of algebra in mid
dle school; students who succeed
in algebra usftally do better in the
rest of school and in their careers
than those who do not. Well-inten
tioned school administrators often
hope that early enrollment in alge
bra will reduce the achievement
gap attributed to race or family in
come.
Hence enrollments in middle
school courses called "Algebra"
have increased. But judging from
results on objective statewide
tests, many middle-school stu
dents are not learning the subject,
even those with passing grades.
The strongest predictor of fail

ure to learn algebra is not race or
income; it is a lack of adequate
academic preparation. The prob
lem begins before students get to
their first algebra class. Many
school districts have watered
down the content of pre-algebra
courses, removing important but
difficult material. The districts
want more students to pass math
classes, and they want to guaran
tee high pass rates by making the
classes easy. But classes without
content set students up for later
failure in algebra.
The depth of the problem
varies. In some schools, the per
centage of eighth-grade algebra
students is moderately correlated
to scores on the seventh-grade
California Standards Test. In
those schools, algebra readiness is
still being used as part of the place
ment decision.
In other schools, placement de
cisions appear unrelated to aca
demic preparation. In the worst
cases, all or nearly all students are
placed in algebra by eighth grade,
regardless of readiness.
No district in California is more
guilty of misguided placement
strategies than the San Diego City
Schools. The results are disas
trous.
Failing to learn algebra in
eighth grade results in large num
bers of students repeating algebra
in ninth grade, even though suc
cess is not ensured the second time
around.

Admirably, California em
braces learning algebra by the end
of eighth grade as a long-term
goal. But strengthening academics
from kindergarten on is necessary
before this goal can fully be met.
Algebra placement rates ought to
depend on student readiness. Sev
enth-grade student scores on the
California Standards Test should
guide placement in eighth-grade
courses.
Another state policy adds to
the problem. As of now middle
schools receive more credit on
Californials accountability index
for eighth graders who take the al
gebra test than for those who take
the general math test, encouraging
schools to place too many students
in eighth-grade algebra. The state
should discourage overplacement
by taking away some credit on the
accountability index for algebra
exam failures.
California's algebra crisis is se
rious but not terminal. Schools
need to concentrate on improving
students' readiness for algebra
courses. Algebra for all is good,
but without changes we could end
up with algebra for none.
