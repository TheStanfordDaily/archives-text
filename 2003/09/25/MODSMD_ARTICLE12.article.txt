# Wireless installed in dormitories
## 
### DAVID BLACKMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, Residential Comput
ing began a pilot project to "unwire"
the Wilbur and Stern dorm com
plexes as well as the Row house Bob.
Now, Res Comp is planning to ex
pand the project, possibly into a
campus-wide effort.
Wireless networks already exist
to serve the libraries, parts of the
Quad and other academic buildings.
Head of Residential Computing
Rich Holeton called the project "a
great big collaborative interdepart
mental effort."
There are many challenges in set
ting up a wireless network in student
dormitories. Res Comp had to find
enclosures that would provide pro
tection from theft, soccer balls and
frisbees. There was another problem
as well: Many Stanford dorms are
made of reinforced concrete, a ma
terial that wireless transmission do
not travel through well.
The pilot project was a one-year
effort to compare two different
brands of wireless networking prod
ucts, specifically the wireless access
points (APs) that broadcast the
wireless signal into the air. This first
year was used as a test bed to see
what challenges would be faced,
who would need to be involved and
what equipment worked the best.
Res Comp has had a positive re

sponse to the pilot project from stu
dents and resident computer coordina
tors. More than 75 percent of students
use laptops, a fact which supports the
idea that wireless should be made more
prevalent in dorms, Holeton said.
"We should make wireless avail
able throughout the residences," he
said. "Not just the common areas."
No official reports have been
made on the differences between
brands of equipment, but the Cisco
equipment in Stern has seemed to
work the best. This might be due in
part to the existing Cisco infrastruc
ture at Stanford.
Working from experiences with
the pilot project, Res Comp crafted
a proposal to the school for extend
ing the network to every dorm on
campus. Their initial estimate for
the proposal was $1 million, with a
two-year timetable to set up every
dorm. The proposal would realize
Res Comp's goal of "ubiquitous cov
erage throughout residences and the
contiguous outdoor areas."
If the proposal is not accepted,
then Res Comp has a backup plan.
"[We have] a sort of plan B," he
explained. "If we can't get funding
for campus-wide coverage, we will
incrementally add residences [to the
wireless network] in collaboration
with Networking Systems."
Res Comp is so committed to this
project that it is working on finding
money in its common maintenance

budget with Information Technolo
gy Systems and Services for adding
dorms as funds become available.
Over the summer, Res Comp
added wireless coverage to Branner
and parts of Cowell. With the Cowell
Cluster, they took a unique ap
proach: Res Comp purchased some
of the APs for the cluster and Cowell
used house funds for additional APs.
The wireless network in Mur
ray uses a less common but newer
and faster wireless technology
called 802.llg. Res Comp is also
working on getting wireless in all
of Florence Moore Hall this year.
Over the summer, the dorm was
rewired and infrastructure was in
stalled for deploying a wireless
network.
The Res Comp pilot project is not
the only wireless network on campus.
Libraries, the School of Medicine, Law
School, Information Technology Sys
tems and many individual departments
maintain their own networks. These
networks all work together almost
seamlessly, according to Holeton.
"From the student's viewpoint,"
he said, "you pretty much see the
wireless network called 'Stanford'
wherever you go."
Res Comp also encourages stu
dents to set up their own access
points in dorms and areas that Res
Comp hasn't unwired yet. It lays out
guidelines on its Web site, http://Res
Comp/wireless/recommendation.ht

ml, telling students how to set up
their APs. These guidelines also try
to prevent students from violating
the acceptable use policy.
Both RCCs and students are
happy with the extensive wireless ac
cess on campus. Austin Shoemaker,
the RCC in Mars, expressed his views.
"It's nice to be portable in
house," he said. "It lets people get
work done in common areas."
Students who participated in the
wireless pilot project in Otero last
year agree. Sophomore Akshay
Upadhyaya was excited to be in one
of the first dorms to be unwired.
"Last year wireless was essential
to group work, because we could
meet somewhere and all access on
line materials," he said.
Sophomore Jina Hyun was also
thankful for wireless.
"I had research to do, but there
was no way I could do it in the dorm
because of the noise," she said.
Even with all the positive student
feed back, Res Comp is afraid that
given the current Stanford budget
crunch, they will be unable to secure
funding for the project. Holeton
urges students to let the university
know if they want to see the project
completed.
