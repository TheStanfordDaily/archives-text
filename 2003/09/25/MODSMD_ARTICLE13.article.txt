# New study links binge drinking and genetics

MILWAUKEE (KRT) - The
same week that the University of Wis
consin was ranked the nation's No. 2
party school, a study suggests a new ex
planation for all that binge drinking -
genetics.
College students who carried a
particular version of a common gene
tended to have more harmful drink
ing habits than those who had a dif
ferent version, according to a study
published in the journal Alcohol and
Alcoholism.
The gene, known as the serotonin
transporter gene — 5-HTT — has pre
viously been shown to play a key role in
emotions like depression and anxiety.
"One might speculate that in a new
environment like college, if one is
prone to a higher level of anxiety, one
might also be more likely to use alco
hol," said Paolo B. DePetrillo, the se
nior investigator with the National In
stitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco
holism who co-authored the study.
However, DePetrillo said the rela
tionship between drinking and emo
tions is not clearly understood, and
that further studies are needed.
For the study, researchers surveyed
about 200 Caucasian college students
aged 17 to 23 years old about their al
cohol consumption and then collected
their saliva to look at a gene that helps

regulate serotonin, a chemical messen
ger in the brain known to play a role in
depression.
Everyone inherits long or short ver
sions of the 5-HTT gene from then
parents, resulting in three possible
combinations: two short, two long or
one short and one long.
Although the majority of the gener
al population has either two short or
two long genes, about 30 percent of the
white population has one of each gene,
DePetrillo said. But the percentage
varies within each ethnic group, he
said.
Binge drinking, defined as five or
more drinks at a single sitting for men
and four for women, was more preva
lent in students with two copies of the
short form of the gene, the study
found. In addition, those students were
more likely to drink to get drunk and to
consume more drinks at a sitting than
students with other combinations.
The study also found that having at
least one copy of the long variant was
protective; those students tended to
drink less, even though they went out
to drink as often as the other students.
Alcoholism affects 1 out of every 13
adults, or about 14 million Americans,
according to the alcoholism institute.
Men typically have more problems as
sociated with their drinking, though al
cohol problems are highest among
young adults ages 18-29 and lowest
among adults ages 65 and older.
