## Fairy tale endingfor Buddy? 
### 
Once upon a football season, in a
swamp far, far away, lived a
visor-donning genius named
Steve and his trusty sidekick
Buddy. Together, they withstood Hurri
canes, fended off Seminoles, tamed
Tigers and manhandled ferocious Game
cocks with an aerial attack that could
rival the Israeli Air Force.
Clad in orange and blue and armed
with Motorola headsets and clipboards
chock full of magical X's and O's, the duo
orchestrated a prolific passing offense
while at the University of Florida togeth
er from 1999-2002. To be blunt, it was the
greatest thing to come out of Gainesville
since Gatorade. Sadly, their Florida fairy
tale ended shortly after the Gators

walked all over Mary
land, 56-23, in the 2002
Orange Bowl.
Steve Spurrier and
Buddy Teevens were
parting ways. The
Danny, Redskins
owner Dan Snyder,
tempted Spurrier to
abandon the comforts
of the college sidelines
for the NFL ($25 mil-

lion talks). Back at Stanford, where Car
dinal fans were still mourning (or curs
ing) the loss (or departure) of a man (or
sellout) named Willingham, the reaction
to Teevens's arrival involved more
"who's?" than hoopla. Rampant talk of
the Fun 'N' Gun, however, got fans in
both places excited.
Spurrier got off to a promising start.
The Redskins set a record for points
scored en route to a 4-1 record in the pre
season before funning and gunning their
way to a week-one victory over the Ari
zona Cardinals behind the arm of Shane
Matthews.
The key words in the preceding para
graph are preseason, Arizona Cardinals
and Shane Matthews. A 37-7 home loss to
the Eagles in front of a national audience
on Monday Night Football eight days later
would set the real tone for the season.
The Head Ball Coach threw his visor
and bumbled his hps in unprecedented
fashion. The Redskins finished 7-9.
If Spurrier's season was a bad dream,
Teevens's was a nightmare. Following a
loss at Boston College to open the year, 500
yards of total offense in a dominating victo
ry over San Jose State revived hope for the
Cardinal's season. But, it was not to be.
Inexperienced Kyle Matter and sur
prisingly ineffective Chris Lewis were
Danny Wuerrfel-like in combining for
12 interceptions in the first four games.
Stanford surpassed the 200-yard pass
ing mark just once in their final nine
games, which is the Pac-10 equivalent
of an Arena League football team get
ting shutout.
Cardinal fans expecting deep passing
plays had to wonder if Teevens left part
of his playbook in the seat-back pocket of
the 747 out to Stanford. Teevens called
427 run plays last season compared to 369
passes, hardly reminiscent of the pass
first-ask-questions-later game plan that
he helped employ at Florida. The Cardi
nal finished 2-9.
In hindsight, Spurrier, Teevens and
the Fun 'N' Gun were doomed to strug
gle last season from the start. Both men
replaced conservative play-calling
coaches (Marty Schottenheimer and Ty
rone Willingham) who emphasized ball
control and discipline, the antithesis of
their own coaching philosophy.
One year later, Spurrier and Teevens
have the foundation in place to eventual
ly make their respective offenses run, er,
gun. Among other changes made in the
offseason, the HBC abandoned his old
Gator fetish for a New York Jets one (the
Redskins signed four Jets free agents to
offer sheets) and his Heisman candidates
for running back Trung Canidate.
Meanwhile, Teevens inked a talented
recruiting class and oversaw the develop
ment of his first major project, starting
quarterback Trent Edwards.
Most importantly, Spurrier's Redskins
are 2-1 and lead the NFL in total offense.
The Cardinal is a surprising 2-0, largely
thanks to a defense that has given up a
grand total of four rushing yards. Willing
ham and Schottenheimer, incidentally,
have a combined record of 1-5.
The success of Spurrier and Teevens
should not be solely based on the suc
cess or lack thereof of the Fun 'N' Gun,
nor will it. In addition to passing
yardage and points, they both helped
put up pretty impressive numbers in the
win column at Florida.
A year or two from now, we may look
back on their trials last season and see
that patience — like passing —is a
virtue. Who knows, perhaps another
fairy tale is in the works.

passes, hardly reminiscent of the pass
first-ask-questions-later game plan that
he helped employ at Florida. The Cardi
nal finished 2-9.
In hindsight, Spurrier, Teevens and
the Fun 'N' Gun were doomed to strug
gle last season from the start. Both men
replaced conservative play-calling
coaches (Marty Schottenheimer and Ty
rone Willingham) who emphasized ball
control and discipline, the antithesis of
their own coaching philosophy.
One year later, Spurrier and Teevens
have the foundation in place to eventual
ly make their respective offenses run, er,
gun. Among other changes made in the
offseason, the HBC abandoned his old
Gator fetish for a New York Jets one (the
Redskins signed four Jets free agents to
offer sheets) and his Heisman candidates
for running back Trung Canidate.
Meanwhile, Teevens inked a talented
recruiting class and oversaw the develop
ment of his first major project, starting
quarterback Trent Edwards.
Most importantly, Spurrier's Redskins
are 2-1 and lead the NFL in total offense.
The Cardinal is a surprising 2-0, largely
thanks to a defense that has given up a
grand total of four rushing yards. Willing
ham and Schottenheimer, incidentally,
have a combined record of 1-5.
The success of Spurrier and Teevens
should not be solely based on the suc
cess or lack thereof of the Fun 'N' Gun,
nor will it. In addition to passing
yardage and points, they both helped
put up pretty impressive numbers in the
win column at Florida.
A year or two from now, we may look
back on their trials last season and see
that patience — like passing —is a
virtue. Who knows, perhaps another
fairy tale is in the works.
