# Polo crushes Seasiders
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team (5-1)
notched an overwhelming 16-8 victory in its home
opener last night against No. 18 Brigham Young-
Hawaii (2-1) at Avery Aquatic Center. The throngs of
students who packed the bleachers witnessed the Car
dinal swim laps around the Seasiders, who had their
hands full with Stanford's junior driver Tony Azevedo
from the start.
With the Axe Committee in attendance, the train whis
tle rang early and often. Stanford gained quick control of
the ball with a goal by Azevedo just 19 seconds into regu
lation. Azevedo scored twice in the first minute of play,
setting the pace for a 7-3 Stanford lead at the end of the
first period.
The Cardinal's powerful drivers rolled over an anemic
Seasider defense, who never presented a challenge for an
energized Stanford team that led 11-4 at the half.
Azevedo dominated the pool all night, tying his career
high with seven goals by the third period. Azevedo at
tributed his high scoring to assists and good play by his
teammates.
"I just think our team played really well today," he

said. "You know it's easy to score when everyone's doing
their job out there. Everything came from a great pass
from my teammates."
However, Azevedo was not alone in delivering a stel
lar performance for the Cardinal, as sophomore driver
Thomas Hopkins reached a career high total with five
goals in the game. The two are now tied for the team lead
with 16 goals each.
The Cardinal also showed off its solid defense against
the Seasiders. Sophomore goalie Chad Taylor had six
saves in three periods of play and freshman David Carlson
finished with three saves in the fourth.
Unlike most of its contests, Stanford came into the
game with few expectations about how its opponent
would perform.
"We had no idea," said Taylor. "We've never seen
these guys play. We've never seen the scores, so we had no
idea what was going to happen."
Still, Stanford had been on the lookout for BYU-
Hawaii's talented Yugoslavian duo, but junior Vanja Kal
abic was held to two goals while freshman Vlada
Stankovic only scored once.
"They have a couple of really good, solid players," said
Hopkins. "But we smashed them up with a couple of our
better players."

Azevedo felt that Kalabic inspired him and the team to
play their best.
"I went into the game having a role to stop number 12
[Kalabic], who's notably one of the best in the NCAA,"
Azevedo said. "It got me fired up â€” I've got to set this guy
down"
On Tuesday afternoon, Azevedo exhorted the team to
put more into its practice. He saw the results in last night's
game.
"Yesterday was one of our best practices so far and
today it showed. Yesterday we went out and fought.
Today we went out and fought," he said.
The Cardinal's victory came just days after losing its
No. 1 national ranking, with its loss to Southern California
in last weekend's Southern California Tournament.
According to Hopkins, the loss to USC spurred the
team to better play against the Seasiders.
"The loss was hard on all of us," Hopkins said. "We've
been working really hard the last couple days and we
came out like Tony [Azevedo] said, putting 110 percent
into it. When you go that hard, everything just comes."
The Cardinal will try to build on last night's success on
Oct. 4 and 5 at the Northern California Tournament held
at Avery Aquatic Center.
