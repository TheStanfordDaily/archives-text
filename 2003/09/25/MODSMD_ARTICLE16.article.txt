### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After two frustrating shutouts, the No. 21 Cardinal
women's soccer team (4-3-1) was ready for an offensive
explosion. However, nobody could have anticipated the
thrashing San Francisco (3-6-0) would receive courtesy
of the formerly sputtering offense.
Playing in front of its loudest crowd of the season at
Maloney Field, the Cardinal equaled its total number of
goals on the season in just the first half and dominated
the Dons for the entire 90 minutes, walking off the field
with a 6-1 victory.
"The fans definitely helped," said senior tri-captain
Ally Marquand. "They got us going from the start."
Marquand opened the floodgates in the third minute
of play blasting an unassisted goal from 20 yards out into
the left corner of the net.
The Dons looked entirely overmatched, giving up an
other goal just four minutes later, allowing senior Alisan
Pabon to find the net.
"The early goals were really key for us," said Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "It made us more confident on
offense and that led to even more goals."
Despite taking a comfortable 2-0 lead, Stanford never
let up on its attack. Pabon cleaned up again, putting away
a beautiful cross from sophomore midfielder Leah Tap
scott in the 18th minute.
"Leah had an awesome run down the sideline to set up
that goal," Pabon said. "She got inline and crossed it back
and I was able to score."
"Pabon did really well up front," Ratcliffe said.
"Maybe she's good luck for us up there."
With the Cardinal offense looking like the finely
tuned machine it should be, the defense showed its usual
prowess.

Freshman Emily Buehler goes in for the tackle in last night's 6-1 romp over San Francisco. The No. 21 Cardinal's offensive explosion
at Moloney Fielawas led by two goals each from seniors Allyson Marquand and Alisan Pabon.
Laura Ott was able to head the re
bound into the back of the net.
"Nicole Barnhart is arguably the
best goalkeeper in the nation," Rat
cliffe said. "You won't see that kind
of thing happen to her again."
As the match progressed, the play
became more physical. Two yellow
cards were handed out and Mar
quand was forced out for the last few
minutes of the first half when she in
jured her right leg going for a loose

ball. However, she recovered quick
ly and was able to start the the sec
ond half for the Cardinal.
Even with Marquand icing her leg
on the sideline, the Cardinal was
able to increase its lead going into
halftime, as freshman Gina Farias-
Eisner notched her first collegiate
point with an assist to junior forward
Natalie Sanderson.
With the starting squad back on
the field for the beginning of the sec
ond half, the Cardinal continued to
put pressure on the Dons and it con
tinued to be successful.
"[In our previous matches] our
offense has been there, we just
hadn't connected and we hadn't fin

ished the final ball," Marquand said.
"Tonight I think we were really on
and [the offense] worked."
Pabon narrowly missed the covet
ed hat trick when Orantes made a
diving save at the 60-minute mark.
The Stanford scoring deluge fi
nally ended in the 86th minute on a
goal by Tapscott.
The Cardinal hopes to continue
its offensive success on Saturday
when it takes on St. Mary's in Mora
ga. It will be the first time Ratcliffe
will face off against his former team.
"It'll be really tough because I
recruited all those kids," Ratcliffe
said. "I almost won't know who to
root for."
