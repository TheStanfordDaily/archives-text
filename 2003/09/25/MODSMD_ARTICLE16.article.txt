# Dons sleep with fishes

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After two frustrating shutouts, the No. 21 Cardinal
women's soccer team (4-3-1) was ready for an offensive
explosion. However, nobody could have anticipated the
thrashing San Francisco (3-6-0) would receive courtesy
of the formerly sputtering offense.
Playing in front of its loudest crowd of the season at
Maloney Field, the Cardinal equaled its total number of
goals on the season in just the first half and dominated
the Dons for the entire 90 minutes, walking off the field
with a 6-1 victory.
"The fans definitely helped," said senior tri-captain
Ally Marquand. "They got us going from the start."
Marquand opened the floodgates in the third minute
of play blasting an unassisted goal from 20 yards out into
the left corner of the net.
The Dons looked entirely overmatched, giving up an
other goal just four minutes later, allowing senior Alisan
Pabon to find the net.
"The early goals were really key for us," said Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "It made us more confident on
offense and that led to even more goals."
Despite taking a comfortable 2-0 lead, Stanford never
let up on its attack. Pabon cleaned up again, putting away
a beautiful cross from sophomore midfielder Leah Tap
scott in the 18th minute.
"Leah had an awesome run down the sideline to set up
that goal," Pabon said. "She got inline and crossed it back
and I was able to score."
"Pabon did really well up front," Ratcliffe said.
"Maybe she's good luck for us up there."
With the Cardinal offense looking like the finely
tuned machine it should be, the defense showed its usual
prowess.
San Francisco's lone goal came when midfielder An
nika Schmidt's corner kick bounced off the hands of ju
nior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart and junior defender
