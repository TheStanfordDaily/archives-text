# Frosh hits new goal
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Andrew Kartunen is widely regarded as the
best freshman goalkeeper in all of collegiate soccer
and he is already getting a chance to prove that.
With the injury to Stanford's starting goalkeep
er junior Robby Fulton, Kartunen has been thrust
into the spotlight much earlier than expected.
In many ways, his quick and unexpected ascent
into Stanford's starting lineup is rather indicative
of the way things have been all of his life with re
gards to soccer.
A little bit of good timing combined with a lot
of hard work have paid quick dividends for the
freshman thus far.
But the ride hasn't always been easy, even de
spite early signs that he was always meant to be a
soccer player. Kartunen began playing at the age
of four. His first word was "ball" and from that
day forward he spent his days chasing said object
around.
He was a field player on city and club teams
until the age of 12, when a twist of fate landed him
a job guarding the net.
"The parents of the goalkeeper on my team
had some issues with the coach," said Kartunen,
"and they went on some ego trip and pulled their
kid off the team. So we had try outs for a new goal
keeper and I was it."
Kartunen admits that he would have much
rather been on the field at the time. But he
quickly adjusted to his new position and right
away established himself as a talented goal
keeper.
By the 1998-99 season, Kartunen's unexpected
move to the position of goalkeeper had already
borne incredible results, as he was selected to the
U.S. National Team. But his rapid rise was ac
companied by some unfortunate setbacks.
In September, 1999, Kartunen traveled to
Guadalajara, Mexico for his first game outside the
United States — an unforgettable moment in any
athlete's career.
In this case, however, it wasn't all roses. While
south of the boarder, Kartunen contracted Hep
atitis A.
If that weren't enough, he also injured his
shoulder and broke his collarbone.
Recovery from Hepatitis and shoulder surgery
kept Kartunen on the sideline for his entire fresh
man year of high school.
And while he can smile telling the story now, it
is clear that that year was an incredible challenge.

"It was a tough period in my life," Kartunen
said. "It was a learning experience for me, and it
really established my personality — who I am
today."
Kartunen was eventually able to return to soc
cer as though he hadn't ever left, rejoining his high
school team and his club team, which allowed him
to play in 13 different countries.
All of the travel took its toll on Kartunen, how
ever.
"It was rough trying to do [make-up work]
while jet-lagged," he said, but the perseverance he
learned during his year-long hiatus kept him going.
By the end of his senior year, he had been ap

proached by almost every prominent Division I
soccer team in the country. But, according to
Kartunen, he didn't consider the others for a
second.
"Stanford was always my top choice," said
Kartunen, who is now exploring fields like psy
chology and philosophy as potential majors.
But his career, he hopes, will focus around
sports.
"Going pro is goal of mine," he said, "But I'm
definitely set on staying here for four years."
Given the opportunity to start much more
quickly than he had anticipated, he has definitely
gotten off on the right foot. Already he has

recorded a single-game saves mark of 14, while
also registering his first collegiate shutout against
then-No. 8 SMU.
In fact, the only thing that can make Kartunen
cringe about his experience with the Cardinal is
his new nickname.
After the team's trainer, Perry, misread his
name and called him Crouton, Kartunen's team
mates made sure that the nickname stuck.
"He's done a great job," said coach Bret
Simon. "He's very talented and very level-headed
on the field, much like Robby [Fulton] is. And he
has room to grow and be even better with every
game he plays."

Freshman Andrew Kartunen has assumed the starting position at goalkeeper much sooner than he had expected. But, as he has shown already, he is more than up to the
task, exceeding the high expectations placed on the top recruit.
