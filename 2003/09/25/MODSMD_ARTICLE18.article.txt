LOS ANGELES (U-WIRE) —
Some fights cannot be won, University
of California Regent Ward Connerly ap
pears to be learning firsthand.
The author of Proposition 54, which,
if approved, would prohibit the state
from collecting ethnic and racial data,
Connerly has focused much of his life re
moving racial distinctions from society.
After spearheading Proposition
209, which ended racial consideration in
California's public employment and ed
ucation N approved by voters in 1996 —
Connerly has sought to further erase
racial lines by drafting and promoting
Proposition 54. But earlier this month,
Connerly all but conceded defeat when
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante pledged
nearly $4 million toward advertisements
in which he urges voters to oppose it
"I'm never throwing in the towel,"
Connerly told the Los Angeles Times

after being informed of Bustamante's
pledge. "But I've been around the block.
There is no way we can match that [ad
vertising]."
To date, public support of Proposi
tion 54 has been limited. Following sev
eral months of taking heavy
criticism, Bustamante's money may
have dealt the final blow to an already
struggling initiative.
Throughout the history of Proposi
tion 54 N also known as the Racial Pri
vacy Initiative — public support has
been dwindling.
In July, the Field Poll, a non-partisan
California poll, reported 48 percent of
expected voters supported Proposition
54 while 33 percent opposed it. But ear
lier this month the Field Poll reported
that public support had fallen signifi
cantly, with 40 percent of respondents
saying they would vote "yes."
When Tom Wood, co-author of
Proposition 209, saw the initial survey
findings for Proposition 54, he said he

knew it was doomed.
"You need to start out with very
high numbers, because that number is
going to fall," he said.
And that number has fallen. Public
support has decreased as public aware
ness has increased. In July, 25 percent of
Californians said they understood the
initiative's language and intent That
number more than doubled by the mid
dle of September.
Republican Tom McClintock is
the only frontrunner in the race for
the governorship who has publicly
supported Proposition 54. And
though the California GOP formal
ly endorsed Proposition 54 in Feb
ruary, it has not contributed any
money to its campaign.
"The California Republican Party
has very limited resources," said GOP
spokesman Mike Wintemute. "Don't
ever look at the money we spend on an
initiative as a measure of the party's sup
port."
