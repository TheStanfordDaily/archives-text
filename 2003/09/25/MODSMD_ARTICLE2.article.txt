# Panel discusses pros and cons of Proposition 54
## 
### JEFF SHEN MEGUMI TSUTSUI 
On Oct. 7, California voters will
decide not only the fate of the gover
norship but also the destiny of a con
troversial bill, Proposition 54. A
group of speakers discussed both of
these issues at a panel held yesterday
afternoon in Tresidder Union.
Among those present were state
Senate candidate Ted Lempert,
State Superintendent of Public In
struction Jack O'Connell, San
Mateo County Assemblyman Chris
Kelly and Dylan Mefford, president
of the Stanford Democrats.
O'Connell argued that the propo
sition would deprive the state of
valuable information that can help it
operate more efficiently.
"Opposition to Prop 54 hampers
[the state's] ability to target re
sources where they'd make the
biggest differences," he said. "I'm
urging the community to reject Prop
54. We should make political deci
sions based on data, not anecdotes."
Kelly argued that the proposition
as a political ploy.
"It's important that we stop the
power grab that the Republican
party has started," he said. "The
government in this state should fix
serious problems instead of spend
ing its time on expensive recall elec
tions. If we don't know how to do
outreach in under-served communi
ties we can't help to improve social
services."
Lempert highlighted how he'd
started an aggressive campaign on
campus to stop opposition to the
Proposition.
"I'm urging people to vote no on
Prop 54," he said. "It doesn't make
any sense not to be able to collect in

formation that could help us provide
better services."
Placed on the ballot in July and
spearheaded by University of Cali
fornia Regent Ward Connerly,
Proposition 54 legislation would se
verely limit the collection of racial
and ethnic data by public and private
organizations, a practice that the
bill's sponsors and endorsers label as
"archaic."
California is America's most di
verse state with many multi-racial
members, yet citizens are repeatedly
asked on government forms to check
a box indicating their ethnicity. Sup
porters believe that Proposition 54
will be a step towards a colorblind
society and increase privacy.
"Proposition 54 would be a signif
icant step towards completing the
dream of a colorblind society set
forth by great leaders such as Martin
Luther King, Jr.," said Gary Re
ichart of The Stanford Review.
"This proposition would significant
ly impact California and the nation
as a whole for the better because
eliminating classification of citizens
by race by the government is the best
and only way to ensure equality
among the races and to begin to put
an end to institutionalized racism."
No one at the panel denied that a
colorblind, tolerant society is desir
able, but naysayers doubted whether
Proposition 54 can blur racial lines
and achieve that end. In fact, some
said they believed it will do more
harm than good.
"Proposition 54 doesn't lead to a
'colorblind society,' " said senior
Linda Tran of the Campaign to Stop
54. "It undermines the efforts to ad
dress the inequalities and disparities
that exist within our system."
Junior Dylan Mefford of the
Stanford Democrats concurred.
"The Stanford Democrats op
pose Proposition 54 because it dev
astates the ability of the state to ad
dress achievement gaps in educa
tional performance and attainment,
restricts medical research on issues
of concern to particular communi
ties, and impairs the ability of the
California judicial system to treat all
people equally under the law," he
said.
Health care practitioners claim
that racial data is critical for medical
research. Caucasian women, for ex

ample, are more susceptible to
breast cancer than other segments of
the population. Hispanics have a
higher incidence of diabetes, and
Asians have an increased risk of He
patitis-B. Not having racial and eth
nic statistics could impede the re
search that helps eradicate these dis
eases.
There are similar fears that a
lack of such information would
leave practices such as racial profil
ing and disparities in education
unchecked. Without racial statis
tics, some believe, pressing social
concerns cannot be identified nor
addressed.
Advocates retort that Proposi
tion 54 allows certain approved
agencies to collect racial data, but
that would require a two-thirds vote
and would vastly complicate the

process.
"The argument I hear most
against 54 is that it would negatively
affect the study of health issues to
which some racial groups are dispro
portionately afflicted," said junior
Joe Fairbanks, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans. "Argu
ments such as those blatantly exhibit
opponents' ignorance of the propo
sition. Proposition 54 would exempt
medical research from the ban on
racial data."
Not only is the issue contentious,
but Proposition 54 is the only propo
sition on the recall ballot and has re
ceived special scrutiny because of
this fact. Therefore, heated debate is
expected to continue in the next two
weeks.
Said Mefford, "We can't truly
have a colorblind society."

started an aggressive campaign on
campus to stop opposition to the
Proposition.
"I'm urging people to vote no on
Prop 54," he said. "It doesn't make
any sense not to be able to collect in

formation that could help us provide
better services."
Placed on the ballot in July and
spearheaded by University of Cali
fornia Regent Ward Connerly,
Proposition 54 legislation would se
verely limit the collection of racial
and ethnic data by public and private
organizations, a practice that the
bill's sponsors and endorsers label as
"archaic."
California is America's most di
verse state with many multi-racial
members, yet citizens are repeatedly
asked on government forms to check
a box indicating their ethnicity. Sup
porters believe that Proposition 54
will be a step towards a colorblind
society and increase privacy.
"Proposition 54 would be a signif
icant step towards completing the
dream of a colorblind society set
forth by great leaders such as Martin
Luther King, Jr.," said Gary Re
ichart of The Stanford Review.
"This proposition would significant
ly impact California and the nation
as a whole for the better because
eliminating classification of citizens
by race by the government is the best
and only way to ensure equality
among the races and to begin to put
an end to institutionalized racism."
No one at the panel denied that a
colorblind, tolerant society is desir
able, but naysayers doubted whether
Proposition 54 can blur racial lines
and achieve that end. In fact, some
said they believed it will do more
harm than good.
"Proposition 54 doesn't lead to a
'colorblind society,' " said senior
Linda Tran of the Campaign to Stop
54. "It undermines the efforts to ad
dress the inequalities and disparities
that exist within our system."
Junior Dylan Mefford of the
Stanford Democrats concurred.
"The Stanford Democrats op
pose Proposition 54 because it dev
astates the ability of the state to ad
dress achievement gaps in educa
tional performance and attainment,
restricts medical research on issues
of concern to particular communi
ties, and impairs the ability of the
California judicial system to treat all
people equally under the law," he
said.
Health care practitioners claim
that racial data is critical for medical
research. Caucasian women, for ex

ample, are more susceptible to
breast cancer than other segments of
the population. Hispanics have a
higher incidence of diabetes, and
Asians have an increased risk of He
patitis-B. Not having racial and eth
nic statistics could impede the re
search that helps eradicate these dis
eases.
There are similar fears that a
lack of such information would
leave practices such as racial profil
ing and disparities in education
unchecked. Without racial statis
tics, some believe, pressing social
concerns cannot be identified nor
addressed.
Advocates retort that Proposi
tion 54 allows certain approved
agencies to collect racial data, but
that would require a two-thirds vote
and would vastly complicate the

process.
"The argument I hear most
against 54 is that it would negatively
affect the study of health issues to
which some racial groups are dispro
portionately afflicted," said junior
Joe Fairbanks, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans. "Argu
ments such as those blatantly exhibit
opponents' ignorance of the propo
sition. Proposition 54 would exempt
medical research from the ban on
racial data."
Not only is the issue contentious,
but Proposition 54 is the only propo
sition on the recall ballot and has re
ceived special scrutiny because of
this fact. Therefore, heated debate is
expected to continue in the next two
weeks.
Said Mefford, "We can't truly
have a colorblind society."
