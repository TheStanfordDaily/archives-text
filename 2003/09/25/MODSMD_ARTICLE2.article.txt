# Panel discusses pros and cons of Proposition 54

### JEFF SHEN MEGUMI TSUTSUI 
On Oct. 7, California voters will
decide not only the fate of the gover
norship but also the destiny of a con
troversial bill, Proposition 54. A
group of speakers discussed both of
these issues at a panel held yesterday
afternoon in Tresidder Union.
Among those present were state
Senate candidate Ted Lempert,
State Superintendent of Public In
struction Jack O'Connell, San
Mateo County Assemblyman Chris
Kelly and Dylan Mefford, president
of the Stanford Democrats.
O'Connell argued that the propo
sition would deprive the state of
valuable information that can help it
operate more efficiently.
"Opposition to Prop 54 hampers
[the state's] ability to target re
sources where they'd make the
biggest differences," he said. "I'm
urging the community to reject Prop
54. We should make political deci
sions based on data, not anecdotes."
Kelly argued that the proposition
as a political ploy.
"It's important that we stop the
power grab that the Republican
party has started," he said. "The
government in this state should fix
serious problems instead of spend
ing its time on expensive recall elec
tions. If we don't know how to do
outreach in under-served communi
ties we can't help to improve social
services."
Lempert highlighted how he'd
started an aggressive campaign on
campus to stop opposition to the
Proposition.
"I'm urging people to vote no on
Prop 54," he said. "It doesn't make
any sense not to be able to collect in

formation that could help us provide
better services."
Placed on the ballot in July and
spearheaded by University of Cali
fornia Regent Ward Connerly,
Proposition 54 legislation would se
verely limit the collection of racial
and ethnic data by public and private
organizations, a practice that the
bill's sponsors and endorsers label as
"archaic."
California is America's most di
verse state with many multi-racial
members, yet citizens are repeatedly
asked on government forms to check
a box indicating their ethnicity. Sup
porters believe that Proposition 54
will be a step towards a colorblind
society and increase privacy.
"Proposition 54 would be a signif
icant step towards completing the
dream of a colorblind society set
forth by great leaders such as Martin
Luther King, Jr.," said Gary Re
ichart of The Stanford Review.
"This proposition would significant
ly impact California and the nation
as a whole for the better because
eliminating classification of citizens
by race by the government is the best
and only way to ensure equality
among the races and to begin to put
an end to institutionalized racism."
No one at the panel denied that a
colorblind, tolerant society is desir
able, but naysayers doubted whether
Proposition 54 can blur racial lines
and achieve that end. In fact, some
said they believed it will do more
harm than good.
"Proposition 54 doesn't lead to a
'colorblind society,' " said senior
Linda Tran of the Campaign to Stop
54. "It undermines the efforts to ad
dress the inequalities and disparities
