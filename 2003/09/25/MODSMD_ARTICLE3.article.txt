# University, USW workers compromise on new labor contract
## 
### ERIC ELDON STAFF WRITER 
Negotiators from United Stan
ford Workers and the University
recently finalized a contract for the
next three years that covers 1,150
workers, promising new job-pro
tection measures and an eventual
wage increase. The University also
agreed to create at least 40 new
permanent positions within Stan
ford Dining, for which the current
ly temporary workers are receiving
preference in hiring.
Negotiators finalized the con
tract on Sept. 5, and the workers
ratified the contract on Sept. 9,10
days after their previous contract
had expired.
United Stanford Workers is a
chapter of Service Employees In
ternational Union Local 715, and
the workers represented come
from the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center, Residential Housing
and Dining Enterprises, Facilities
and other departments.
The workers are directly hired
by the University rather than
through subcontractors.
With Stanford facing a year of fis
cal difficulties, the union most suc
cessfully advocated for increased
job security for its members.
According to contractual agree
ments, if layoffs are made they will
be determined based on seniority,
and "any job that the University is
looking at contracting out, that the
union believes could be a union
job, [the University and the union]
will meet to discuss alternatives,"
said Roxana Rivera, a member of
the organization.
Both sides agreed to a wage
freeze for the first year of the con
tract, and increases of 3.5 and 4
percent, respectively, for the fol
lowing two years.
"The wage freeze reflects the
tough economic circumstances fac
ing the University," said Vice Presi

dent of Public Affairs Gordon
Earle. "Due to our financial situa
tion, we instituted a wage and hiring
freeze for 2003-04. Because we ex
pect the economy and Stanford's
budget situation to improve in the
coming years, we agreed to wage in
creases for 2(105 and 2006. We have
tremendous respect for the work
force at Stanford and certainly want
to reward our employees when bet
ter economic times return. But
everyone realizes that short-term
sacrifices are necessary."
From when contract talks began
in late June until the final agree
ment, workers, union activists, stu
dents and others campaigned on
and off campus through public
hearings, marches, petitions and
surprise visits to University admin
istrators in the midst of the con
tract negotiations.
Alongside the issue of job securi
ty, the union focused its campaign
and negotiating efforts on Stan
ford's use, or, as they argued, "mis
use" of temporary workers. Ac
cording to the union, Stanford and
especially Residential Housing and
Dining Enterprises have been using
temporary workers for positions
similar to those held by permanent,
unionized Stanford workers.
Temporary workers, by nature,
do not have job security, with the
exception that if they work for a
temporary agency, that agency
may choose to continually employ
ee them in a number of different
jobs with different companies. Fur
thermore, they are generally paid
less and receive fewer benefits than
regular employees.
Because many of Stanford's tem
porary employees work only during
special events, the exact number of
temporary workers who work on
campus in positions similar to regu
lar employees is unclear. However,
Rivera said that during negotiations,
