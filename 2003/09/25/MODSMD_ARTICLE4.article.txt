# CDC cuts back services again
## Career Development Center forced to reduce its annual spending by 5 percent 
### ANN CHIN 
This year the Career Development Cen
ter will face its second consecutive year of
reduced spending as a result of University
budget cuts. The center plans to undergo an
overall reduction in the programs and ser
vices available to students as part of the 5
percent cutback.
As a result of the cuts, students may be
faced with longer waits when scheduling ap
pointments or seeking assistance in person,
said center director Lance Choy.
Plus, fewer workshops and open hous
es will be offered this year, and the cen
ter will also make cuts in its Career Re
source Center, a library of career-search
books and other materials, including the
on-line site Vault, which supplies infor
mation on various companies and indus
tries.
Like most other University employees,
the center staff will also bear part of the
burden of the budget cuts. Their salaries
will be frozen, and they will have fewer re
sources for professional development, Choy
said.
The center has already implemented
other methods of fundraising to offset the
cuts, such as an increase in the employer
registration fee for career fairs. However,
their efforts to raise funds have been under
mined by the economic recession, which led
to a drop in interest by employers in hiring
on campus.
What makes the cuts particularly disap
pointing for students is that the center's
services are needed the most when the
University is least able to expand its ser
vices.
"The recession has made the job market
very challenging for all students," Choy
said. "Demand for services seems to be in
versely related to the state of the economy."

Still, the center is taking steps to help stu
dents as much as possible.
"The budget cuts will affect the level of
services that we offer, but we have worked
hard to minimize the impact on students,"
Choy said. "In fact, the use of technology
for our reference file service will probably
improve the quality of service for students
even though we have reduced staff and of
fice hours."
The center is just one of a number of de
partments that are facing harsh budget cuts,
said University Provost John Etchemendy.
He said that the budgets of every school and
administrative unit have been cut by 3 to 10
percent.
The cutbacks in general funds this year

totaled nearly $40 million, but the Universi
ty does not anticipate such significant re
ductions in the future.
"We think that these cuts put the worst of
the reductions behind us," Etchemendy
said. "This coming year, we will have to do
some more trimming, but unless something
unforeseen happens, it will not be of a simi
lar scale."
Despite their financial challenges, the
CDC staff remains confident in its ability to
assist students.
"We believe that the core of our opera
tions is functioning well," Choy said. "The
staff is hard-working and creative. We are
committed to providing the best services
possible to Stanford students."
