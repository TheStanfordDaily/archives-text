## The
						UAC: A headless horseman 
### 
The University is close to announc
ing that History Prof. Steven Zip
perstein will pick up the reigns of
academic guidance at Stanford as
the new faculty director of the Undergradu
ate Advising Center. This announcement is
long overdue.
Since Lori White left Stanford 15 months
ago, there has been no permanent leader at
the UAC. While Chip Goldstein, interim di
rector, has done a good job ensuring day-to
day operations continue at the center, the ab
sence of a permanent director has made it dif
ficult for the center to formulate a long-term
strategic plan. Although we agree that a
search committee should take the necessary
time to find the right candidate, 15 months is
far too long for an important campus organi
zation to function without a permanent lead
er.
The University's dithering and delaying as
it searched for a new director of undergradu
ate advising has allowed fundamental prob
lems within the organization to go unad
dressed. Freshman advising — vitally impor
tant to the academic success of undergradu
ates at this institution — has not improved
significantly in recent years. We believe that
this should be in part attributed to the lack of
permanent leadership at the UAC and the
disinterest the University has taken in find
ing a new leader.
As in previous years, the UAC struggled
to fill 300 freshman academic advising posi
tions this year. Until just days before the
Class of '07 arrived on campus, staffers at the
center were frantically searching for qualified
volunteers for advising positions. Finding
someone — sometimes just anyone — at the
last minute is only a temporary fix to a prob
lem that has deeper roots. The center's new
permanent leadership must dramatically re
think the way we approach advising at Stan
ford.
Dandre DeSandies, associate director of
the UAC, admits that while Stanford has a
good advising program on paper, actually
implementing Stanford's advising plan has

proven difficult.
Of the 300 academic advisers chosen each
year, 100 are usually new to the program, ac
cording to DeSandies. Further, the number of
academic advisers who are actually faculty
members has dipped to 14 percent this year —
down from about 18 percent when White was
at the helm of the UAC. The fact that so few
members of the faculty are involved in the pro
gram is unfortunate. While a freshman may not
need advising from a Nobel Prize-winning
scholar, every student deserves quality advis
ing.
For now, the University must recognize
that many faculty do not wish to advise fresh
men and should consider hiring more full
time professional advisers. This would en
sure that more students would have a quali
fied individual they could turn to for help.
In the long term, we hope that Zipper
stein's appointment will usher in a new era of
faculty involvement in the freshman advising
program. His appointment should be seen as
symbolic of Stanford's wish to emphasize the
need for faculty to become involved in advis
ing at all levels of undergraduate education.
While we understand that many faculty
members are busy with their research, teach
ing and departmental advising, the position
of a freshman adviser should be elevated to
the status it deserves so that faculty are more
interested in filling it. Guidance received
early in students' academic careers have the
power to shape their future paths.
In recent years, too many freshmen have
begun to see their advising relationship as
simply a free mid-quarter dinner. We hope
that view changes soon. In order for the pro
gram to be effective, more meaningful bonds
must be formed between advisers and their
students so that the freshman advising pro
gram creates a firm foundation for future ad
vising relationships.
Freshman advising may not top the prior
ity list of any given faculty member, but it
should be included on the list. The guidance
young students get will ultimately determine
their future success at this University.
