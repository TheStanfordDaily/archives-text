# Cyclists must observe road rules
## 
### 
Yesterday's bloody bicycle accident
outside the History Corner under
scores the importance of bike safety
on campus. As students return to
class, White Plaza and the Quad become more
perilous because of the thousands of bikes that
flood through central areas of campus every day.
Often bicyclists speed through crowded areas of
campus and disregard the rules of the road. With
one wrong turn, this carelessness can lead to in
jury-
Bicyclists should realize that they are not
pedestrians. They are operating a vehicle, and
must show the same regard for driving condi
tions and road signs as someone driving a car.
In the state of California, penalties for violat
ing the rules of the road on a bike are sometimes
the same as those for violators driving motor ve

hicles. If for no other reason than to avoid costly
fines and possible hikes in vehicle insurance
rates, bicyclists should demonstrate caution and
care when hitting the road.
As dorky as it may sound, or look, a hel
met can make a substantial difference — as
far as injuries are concerned — in a bicycle
accident. Helmets can be purchased on cam
pus at the Bike Shop, and off campus at any
athletic store.
And perhaps the easiest way to make your
riding experience safer is to use a bicycle light.
Bike lights are distributed free when you regis
ter any bicycle.
Finally, it's important to be courteous to fel
low bicyclists and pedestrians. Getting to class
seconds earlier matters little when it puts the
safety of others at risk. Bike carefully. Your
friends will thank you.
