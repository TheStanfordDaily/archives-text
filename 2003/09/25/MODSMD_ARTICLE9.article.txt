Marshall Op-Ed manipulates facts
Rachelle's Marshall's Op-Ed in The Daily
("Bush hasn't fulfilled promises," Sept. 24) per
fectly illustrates the radical left's penchant for
class warfare.
Marshall claims that the majority of President
Bush's taxes went to the top 1 percent of wage
earners. She is correct. But she conveniently fails
to mention that the top 1 percent pay over 60 per
cent of personal income taxes. The bottom 30
percent, the ones who received no income tax cut,
also pay no federal income taxes. Marshall chose
to leave that uncomfortable fact out as well.
Should income tax cuts go to people who pay no
income taxes? If Marshall is advocating wealth re
distribution, I would much rather have her come
out and say it rather than try to obscure the class
warfare rhetoric with misleading figures.
