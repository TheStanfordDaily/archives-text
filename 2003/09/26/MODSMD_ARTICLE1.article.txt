# Eye on Washington
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Tomorrow is a day of firsts for
the Cardinal football team (2-0),
which takes on No. 18 Washington
(2-1). It is the team's first Pacific 10
Conference game and its first game
against a ranked opponent. If Stan
ford has its way, it will also be the
team's first win at Husky Stadium
since 1975.
While Washington's dominance
is daunting, Stanford hasn't shown
"niuch regard for history this season.
Having benched one of the most
heralded recruits in program histo
ry (senior quarterback Chris Lewis)
for a redshirt freshman (Trent Ed
wards), the Cardinal offense went
out last Saturday and set an all-time
record for fewest passing yards in a
game (56, including 31 by senior
wide receiver Luke Powell) and
still managed to beat Brigham
Young, 18-14.
"The BYU game was a huge
learning experience and growth
opportunity for Trent," said head
coach Buddy Teevens, who earned
his first road win with the team.
Cougars put lots of pressure
on him and came from different an
gles. Trent was pretty wide-eyed at
first, but he settled right back in
and made quick decisions with the
ball."

Stanford's defense, which
ranked ninth in the Pac-10 against
the run last year, has allowed a
grand total of four yards in its two
games giving the Cardinal the
best rush defense in the country.
Of course, when you're the
youngest team in the country, it's a
lot easier to disregard the past. Of
Stanford's 94 players, 47 are true or

redshirt freshmen, and there are
only 14 juniors and 14 seniors on the roster.
"They help us to create more depth on the squad,"
Teevens said of his many freshmen players. "There are
roles that each of these guys can play."
„ Washington has played 23 freshmen this year, but has
a veteran core of 24 juniors and 18 seniors, including se
nior quarterback Cody Pickett and junior wide receiver
Reggie Williams, arguably the best throw-and-catch tan
dem in the nation. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Williams, a
first-team All-American, led the Pac-10 last year with 94
receptions and 1,454 yards both school records.
"[Williams] is a gifted guy and will get his yards, which
makes him fun to watch," Teevens said. "We will need to
mix our coverage to attempt to keep him contained."
Last year, Pickett— who is also 6-foot-4 and 225
pounds became the first ever Pac-10 quarterback to
pass for more than 4,000 yards (4,458).
"Pickett throws well and has strong leadership abili
ties on the field," Teevens said. "He will be difficult to
contain, especially since their offensive line blocks so
well."
The duo's numbers have been down a bit this year,

though, as Pickett has thrown for 779 yards and only
three touchdowns against two interceptions, while
Williams has caught 18 balls for 277 yards and two
touchdowns.
"We are not throwing the ball with as much efficiency
as usual," said Washington head coach Keith Gilbertson.
Washington isn't much of a running team thanks in
large part to the Pickett-Williams airshow, last year's
team turned in the worst rushing performance in school
history so, while the Huskies have rushed the ball
more often under Gilbertson than under former coach
Rick Neuheisel, the Cardinal can expect the Huskies to
test its secondary early and often.
Washington running back Rich Alexis had a huge
game against winless minor-conference foe Idaho, and
has 230 yards on the season, but managed just 36 yards
in a season-opening 28-9 loss to then-No. 2 Ohio State.
The Huskies will run the ball if they're winning big or
breaking off big gains, but their focus will be on trying
to exploit the Stanford secondary a unit that ranks
last in the Pac-10 in pass defense, allowing 285.5 yards
per game.

"I think Rich is a much-improved football player and
a much-improved back from a year ago," Gilbertson
said. "I think our front blocked well [against Idaho] and
is blocking better [now]."
Stanford's attack, conversely, is focused on running
the football a fortunate thing, since the Huskies are
the Pac-10's runaway leader in pass defense, giving up
just 162.7 yards per game, but rank Bth in run defense
(115.7 yards per game). But despite their converse de
fensive strengths and weaknesses, Washington and Stan
ford rank one-two in the Pac-10 in total defense.
"Our defense has been getting better and better, giv
ing us more options," said Gilbertson.
"I know [defensive coordinators] Tom [Williams],
and A.J. Christoff is coaching in there also, who we've
known for a long time," Gilberston said of Stanford's
defense. "They have really upped their tempo ... It's a
real pressure-oriented defense and that gives you lots of
things to concern yourself with, particularly with pro
tections."
Stanford's offense is more conservative this year
under new coordinator David Kelly, and the numbers of

sophomore Kenneth Tolon (172
yards, one touchdown) and junior
J.R. Lemon (103 yards, two scores)
reflect this focus, as both are aver
aging well over four yards per carry.
"Tolon has been playing very
hard and very physically," Teevens
said. "He sees things well and is
good on critical yardage situations."
The Cardinal does have one
proven big-play threat on its side,
though, in Powell. The 5-8 former
Ail-American punt returner has
caught 17 of the Cardinal's 35 com
pleted passes this year and leads the
Pac-10 in receptions per game (8.5)
while ranking second in all-purpose
yards (151.5 per game). No other
Stanford player has more than four
receptions or 46 receiving yards.
"Luke Powell is a tremendous
athlete," Gilbertson said. "He is a
game-breaker kind of guy as a re
ceiver and as a returner."
Edwards will make his second
start at QB, and has thus far com
pleted 31-of-60 passes for 303
yards, two touchdowns and four in
terceptions.
The Cardinal defense this year is
once again being led by junior safe
ty Oshiomogho Atogwe, who has
nine tackles and a Pac-10-leading
two interceptions. Junior corner
back Leigh Torrence leads the Pac
-10 with five passes defensed, while
Atogwe ranks second with four.
Washington's defense features
senior defensive tackle Terry John
son, whose five sacks rank second in
the Pac-10 and are only one less
than the entire Cardinal has accu
mulated. He also ranks third with
7.5 tackes for a loss. But the
Huskies' biggest strength is a stingy
defensive backfield led by senior
Roc Alexander and junior Derrick
Johnson, as well as nine other re

turning letterwinners.
"We should see a different type of defensive pres
sure from Washington compared to San Jose State and
BYU," Teevens said. "The Pac-10 schools, including
us, tend to have more traditional defensive schemes
than we have been practicing with since preseason
began."
Earlier this week, Kelly said that "Washington is ex
tremely talented. The big thing about Washington is
that their kids don't feel as if Stanford can beat them.
And they don't think the Stanford kids believe we can
beat them."
Teevens and his staff are well aware of the Huskies'
abilities and their expectations after all, Washington
has gone undefeated at home six of the last eleven sea
sons.
"Washington is a great football team and well deserv
ing of its national ranking," Teevens said.
The Cardinal has already seen a lot of changes and a
few surprises since last season, though so it might not
choose to follow the script tomorrow.

The Cardinal football team faces off against No. 18 Washington tomorrow in Seattle. Stanford will try to claim its first victory at Husky Stadium since 1975.
Tomorrow is a day of firsts for
the Cardinal football team (2-0),
which takes on No. 18 Washington
(2-1). It is the team's first Pacific 10
Conference game and its first game
against a ranked opponent. If Stan
ford has its way, it will also be the
team's first win at Husky Stadium
since 1975.
While Washington's dominance
is daunting, Stanford hasn't shown
"niuch regard for history this season.
Having benched one of the most
heralded recruits in program histo
ry (senior quarterback Chris Lewis)
for a redshirt freshman (Trent Ed
wards), the Cardinal offense went
out last Saturday and set an all-time
record for fewest passing yards in a
game (56, including 31 by senior
wide receiver Luke Powell) and
still managed to beat Brigham
Young, 18-14.
"The BYU game was a huge
learning experience and growth
opportunity for Trent," said head
coach Buddy Teevens, who earned
his first road win with the team.
Cougars put lots of pressure
on him and came from different an
gles. Trent was pretty wide-eyed at
first, but he settled right back in
and made quick decisions with the
ball."

Stanford's defense, which
ranked ninth in the Pac-10 against
the run last year, has allowed a
grand total of four yards in its two
games giving the Cardinal the
best rush defense in the country.
Of course, when you're the
youngest team in the country, it's a
lot easier to disregard the past. Of
Stanford's 94 players, 47 are true or

redshirt freshmen, and there are
only 14 juniors and 14 seniors on the roster.
"They help us to create more depth on the squad,"
Teevens said of his many freshmen players. "There are
roles that each of these guys can play."
„ Washington has played 23 freshmen this year, but has
a veteran core of 24 juniors and 18 seniors, including se
nior quarterback Cody Pickett and junior wide receiver
Reggie Williams, arguably the best throw-and-catch tan
dem in the nation. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Williams, a
first-team All-American, led the Pac-10 last year with 94
receptions and 1,454 yards both school records.
"[Williams] is a gifted guy and will get his yards, which
makes him fun to watch," Teevens said. "We will need to
mix our coverage to attempt to keep him contained."
Last year, Pickett— who is also 6-foot-4 and 225
pounds became the first ever Pac-10 quarterback to
pass for more than 4,000 yards (4,458).
"Pickett throws well and has strong leadership abili
ties on the field," Teevens said. "He will be difficult to
contain, especially since their offensive line blocks so
well."
The duo's numbers have been down a bit this year,

though, as Pickett has thrown for 779 yards and only
three touchdowns against two interceptions, while
Williams has caught 18 balls for 277 yards and two
touchdowns.
"We are not throwing the ball with as much efficiency
as usual," said Washington head coach Keith Gilbertson.
Washington isn't much of a running team thanks in
large part to the Pickett-Williams airshow, last year's
team turned in the worst rushing performance in school
history so, while the Huskies have rushed the ball
more often under Gilbertson than under former coach
Rick Neuheisel, the Cardinal can expect the Huskies to
test its secondary early and often.
Washington running back Rich Alexis had a huge
game against winless minor-conference foe Idaho, and
has 230 yards on the season, but managed just 36 yards
in a season-opening 28-9 loss to then-No. 2 Ohio State.
The Huskies will run the ball if they're winning big or
breaking off big gains, but their focus will be on trying
to exploit the Stanford secondary a unit that ranks
last in the Pac-10 in pass defense, allowing 285.5 yards
per game.

"I think Rich is a much-improved football player and
a much-improved back from a year ago," Gilbertson
said. "I think our front blocked well [against Idaho] and
is blocking better [now]."
Stanford's attack, conversely, is focused on running
the football a fortunate thing, since the Huskies are
the Pac-10's runaway leader in pass defense, giving up
just 162.7 yards per game, but rank Bth in run defense
(115.7 yards per game). But despite their converse de
fensive strengths and weaknesses, Washington and Stan
ford rank one-two in the Pac-10 in total defense.
"Our defense has been getting better and better, giv
ing us more options," said Gilbertson.
"I know [defensive coordinators] Tom [Williams],
and A.J. Christoff is coaching in there also, who we've
known for a long time," Gilberston said of Stanford's
defense. "They have really upped their tempo ... It's a
real pressure-oriented defense and that gives you lots of
things to concern yourself with, particularly with pro
tections."
Stanford's offense is more conservative this year
under new coordinator David Kelly, and the numbers of

sophomore Kenneth Tolon (172
yards, one touchdown) and junior
J.R. Lemon (103 yards, two scores)
reflect this focus, as both are aver
aging well over four yards per carry.
"Tolon has been playing very
hard and very physically," Teevens
said. "He sees things well and is
good on critical yardage situations."
The Cardinal does have one
proven big-play threat on its side,
though, in Powell. The 5-8 former
Ail-American punt returner has
caught 17 of the Cardinal's 35 com
pleted passes this year and leads the
Pac-10 in receptions per game (8.5)
while ranking second in all-purpose
yards (151.5 per game). No other
Stanford player has more than four
receptions or 46 receiving yards.
"Luke Powell is a tremendous
athlete," Gilbertson said. "He is a
game-breaker kind of guy as a re
ceiver and as a returner."
Edwards will make his second
start at QB, and has thus far com
pleted 31-of-60 passes for 303
yards, two touchdowns and four in
terceptions.
The Cardinal defense this year is
once again being led by junior safe
ty Oshiomogho Atogwe, who has
nine tackles and a Pac-10-leading
two interceptions. Junior corner
back Leigh Torrence leads the Pac
-10 with five passes defensed, while
Atogwe ranks second with four.
Washington's defense features
senior defensive tackle Terry John
son, whose five sacks rank second in
the Pac-10 and are only one less
than the entire Cardinal has accu
mulated. He also ranks third with
7.5 tackes for a loss. But the
Huskies' biggest strength is a stingy
defensive backfield led by senior
Roc Alexander and junior Derrick
Johnson, as well as nine other re

turning letterwinners.
"We should see a different type of defensive pres
