# Sexy drink proves success
## 
### SAMUEL CULVER BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) —Sex sells. Or at
least that's what Suzanne Manzler
and Dana Paul hope as they roll out
Sex Kola, a new diet soda bottled in
Providence, RI. The provocatively
named concoction hit New England
shelves in early August, according
to Manzler, who co-founded the
brand with Paul.
"We've grown a great deal over
the past six weeks," Manzler said,
describing sales as "remarkable"
since production began almost two
months ago.
"The soda market was much eas
ier to get into than I thought," she
said. "We were both on the Atkins
diet at the time, and an energy drink
that tasted like a soda seemed quite
appealing."
The Sex Kola on shelves at con

venience stores in Providence is a
fruit-flavored, brightly colored liq
uid that is free of sugar, carbohy
drates and calories. It gets its
sweetness from Splenda, a sugar
derivative.

The drink is a direct competitor
to energy drinks like Red Bull, ac
cording to Manzler. But it also
serves as an alternative to diet
drinks and sodas, she said.
"Sex Kola is a unique drink that
really doesn't have an equal com
petitor," she added.
Sales are strong in at least one
Providence location.

"The sales have done well, and
we plan to keep it in stock," said
Mohamed Ben, who works at Metro
Mart on Thayer Street in the city.
But, Ben said, more established
drinks continue to sell better than
the upstart soda.
"Red Bull is still doing much bet

ter, and drinks such as Diet Coke
are much stronger," he said.
The diet drink comes in four fla
vors: Lust Lemonade, Randy Root
Beer, Scream Orange Cream and
Discipline Lemon Lime.
In addition to the eye-catching
names, the Sex Kola bottles feature
vintage-style labels inspired by Cin
namon Altoids containers, Manzler
said. The company plans to change
the labels periodically, with the hope
of making them collectible items.
Right now, four scantily clad
women in pinup poses dominate the
labels of each flavor.
"Eventually we want to hold a
contest for label girls," Manzler
said.
The co-founders are also work
ing on a slogan for the sweet drinks.
Manzler said they have a few ideas -
the current favorite being "Cut the
Bull and try some Sex."
