## California's school crisis 
### 
Classes began at Stanford on
Wednesday. Students cracked open
new textbooks and pulled fresh
notebooks out of their backpacks.
Professors handed out syllabi and gave their
first lectures. Such is the lot of California's
most fortunate students.
But at countless schools around the state,
the picture on the first day of classes was much
bleaker. As close as East Palo Alto less
than two miles from the Quad teachers are
not fully certified and facilities are not ade
quate for student learning.
At Edison-McNair Academy in East Palo
Alto, 75 percent of teachers lack full, non
emergency training credentials. Cesar Chavez
School in East Palo Alto does not provide
enough textbooks for students to take home,
some classroom lights do not work, and there
is no nurse on staff.
The local situation offers just a taste of how
grave things are across the entire state. Plain
tiffs in Williams et al. vs. State of California et al.
one of several lawsuits against California's
schools winding its way through the courts
claim that Luther Burbank Middle School in
San Francisco is infested with vermin and
roaches, and that one dead rodent has re
mained, "decomposing in a corner in the gym
nasium since the beginning of the school year."
The state of schools in California is shame
ful. Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislature
did the children of California no favors when
they approved a budget on Aug. 2 that slashes
about $2 billion from primary and secondary
education. The cuts encompassed under this
plan include a reduction of $lBO in per-stu
dent funding and cuts to textbook, summer
school, maintenance and technology funding.
The state will also forego the traditional $6OO
million increase that accounts for inflation.
The consequences of this action will undoubt
edly be severe and long-lasting.
Even the state's richest districts are suffer

ing under the recent budget cuts. The cuts
prompted the Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict to trim $3.5 million from its operating
costs this year. Although the district has large
ly been able to avoid laying off teachers, stu
dent support services have been drastically
curtailed. Counselors have been laid off, and
teacher training has been slashed in the dis
trict's attempt to break even this year.
Despite the fact that no teachers have been
laid off, morale in the district has suffered.
Susan Antink, a teacher in the district, told
The Palo Alto Weekly: "I don't want us to be
come average and that's where we are head
ing with these cuts."
Palo Alto, unfortunately, cannot control
the fate of its own school system any more. It
is one of 60 districts statewide that have tradi
tionally been able to support themselves
based on local property tax revenues. Seeking
to put a dent in the $3B billion budget deficit
facing California, Davis dipped into the funds
of the state's richer districts. It is a shame that
this move did not enrich the state's less fortu
nate schools, but rather, left the entire system
a little poorer.
At one time, California ranked in the top 10
states based on per-pupil funding to elemen
tary schools. By 2002, the state had dropped to
number 35. And since that time, the education
budget has been further slashed.
While we recognize that the state needs to
make some painful cuts to bring its budget cri
sis under control, mortgaging away the future
of this state's children is not the best way to
handle the budget troubles. As candidates
enter their last days of campaigning before the
Oct. 7 recall election, we urge them to move
education to the top of their political agendas.
Voters have a right to know where the guber
natorial candidates stand on education, and the
candidates have an obligation to the children of
California. Whoever is governor come Oct. 8
must begin to fix California's schools.
