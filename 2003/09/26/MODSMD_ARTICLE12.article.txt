# Stanford must cut carefully
## 
### 
As Stanford struggles to overcome
its second year of financial difficul
ties, offices and departments
across campus have been forced
once again to trim their operating costs by
about eight percent. While we understand and
sympathize with the need to balance Stan
ford's budget, we hope that University units
will work to ensure that the impact of these
cuts on services and opportunities offered to
students is minimal.
The Career Development Center which
provides critical support services for students
seeking jobs is one campus organization
where these painful budget cuts are beginning
to be felt. In the difficult job market currently
facing Stanford graduates, it is critical that the
CDC strive to sustain its present level of assis
tance provided to the student body.
Salary freezes at the CDC and other Uni
versity units have helped to reduce the burden
of these cuts falling on students. We applaud
Stanford's dedicated workers who will bear

the brunt of these freezes, and we recognize
that this budget-reducing measure will help
preserve many vital campus services.
Other units will be faced with budget cuts
even more severe than the CDC's. With cuts of
up to 10 percent for other components of the
University, we hope these offices and depart
ments will employ innovative methods to
stretch their funds as far as possible, so as to
limit the negative effects of the shortfall on stu
dents' educational development.
It is critical that departments and offices
carefully consider all of the potential ways that
they may lower their costs in this time of hard
ship. Significant changes in or the termination
of programs and services should only be consid
ered as a last resort. In the case that such cuts
must be made, final decisions must only be
made after extensive consultation with stu
dents, faculty and staff members. By ensuring
that lines of communication remain open be
tween all involved parties, University cuts will
leave intact programs we value most.
