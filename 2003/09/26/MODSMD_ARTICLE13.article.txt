## OP-ED Blair deals with war's aftermath 
### GERALD A. DORFMAN 
Over the more than two years
since 9/11, and especially during the
run-up to the war in Iraq, President
Bush repeatedly praised Prime Min
ister Blair of Britain as America's
best friend and closest ally.
So what has happened to our best
friend since the war ended? The an
swer is, simply, nothing good. Like
President Bush, Blair enjoyed what
the London media styled the "Bagh
dad bounce" after major hostilities in
Iraq ended. For a few weeks, Blair
(like Bush) and his Labour govern
ment experienced a surge of national
pride that translated into support in
the public opinion polls. But alas it
was not to last, and today Blair and his
government have less support than at
any time since they took office in 1997.
What was a double-digit poll lead be
fore the war has collapsed into a
three- to five-point deficit to the op
position Conservative Party. Blair,
the most trusted and respected politi
cal leader in Britain before the war, is
now the least trusted and respected.
Why such a steep fall?
A big part of the answer is that

Blair took a much greater political
risk in leading his nation into war than
did President Bush. Although Blah
took the initiative on Iraq from a po
sition of unprecedented political
strength, he also faced much stronger
domestic opposition from the start.
Even more important, the bulk of
that domestic opposition came from
within his own Labour Party in sharp
contrast to President Bush, who en
joyed his strongest support from
within his own Republican Party.
Therein lay the origin of what has
been Blair's misery. In laying out the
case for war, Blair needed to convince
his core political supporters.
Case in point, Blair never con
vinced half his Cabinet or a third of
the Labour members of the House of
Commons, none of whom ever came
to accept that Iraq posed a clear and
present danger to British security.
Moreover, they did not like Blair's
close relationship with Bush
scorning Blair as no more than Bush's
"poodle." So when Blair went to war,
his Labour colleagues did no more
than go along with what they regard
ed as "Blair's War," including its at
tendant political risks.

Blair was highly vulnerable to the
political disaster he has been suffer
ing. The failure to find weapons of
mass destruction immediately set off
shrill demands for an investigation of
the entire Iraq policy. This led to the
(questionable) accusation that Blah
had a key role in exaggerating the
case for war. Recently, Blair has suf
fered through a public judicial inves
tigation of the suicide of a govern
ment scientist who apparently made
such a charge to a BBC journalist. A
highly damaging report from this in
vestigation plus more investigations
to follow may make matters worse.
But whatever happens, the impor
tant political consequence for Blair is
already known. He has lost the most
precious of political advantages, trust
and respect, which were the strongest
elements of his success. He has in
deed paid a steep price to be Ameri
ca's best friend.
