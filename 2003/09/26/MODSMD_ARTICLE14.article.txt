Janitor article contains errors

Editor's Note: On Sept. 24, The Daily
published an article "Janitors return
to standard work week" with several
factual errors, including quotes that
were incorrectly attributed to Rodger
Whitney, the executive director of stu
dent housing.

We are writing to correct some mis
information printed in The Stanford
Daily ("Janitors return to standard
work week," Sept. 24).
First, the notion that "changes
were solely due to the custodial staffs
preference for working Monday
through Friday" is not correct. Custo
dians, who either volunteered or were
hired directly into the Tuesday-Satur
day shift, made the choice to work on
Saturdays. Staff schedule preferences
were not the reason for revising the
six-day custodial service this year.
In reality, the pilot program change
was made because both supervisors
and custodial staff felt the trash levels
on Monday had not been significantly
reduced. Also, the shift arrangement
was not improving service since staff
were only collecting trash and not
cleaning on weekends, and the staff
was then spread too thin on Monday
and during the week. The expectation
of this revised program (back to five
days for now) is that overall cleanli
ness of all undergraduate residences
will actually get even better, especially
during the week.
Secondly, the statement, "There
are currently no plans to try the six-day
custodial cleaning schedule again" is
not accurate. Student Housing Ser
vices is looking at the need for an al
ternative approach to weekend clean
ing rather than dropping the program,
as was stated clearly by Imogen Hinds
in her letter to returning students.
Once we return to some weekend-ser
vice model, we will inform all students.
Finally, the most concerning part of
the article is related to a quote stating,
"In response to student concerns,
Whitney suggested that students
should have 'more respect for the
place they live in' and that they should
take an active part in keeping their res
idences clean." This quote is blatantly
not accurate and this statement was

never made by Whitney. Students
generally have great respect for their
homes and this is valued and appreci
ated by our custodians and staff. Stu
dent Housing, not students, has the
overall responsibility to help maintain
the cleanliness, safety and long-term
care of our buildings.
However, if students in residences
can continue to help us clean-up after
events and assume some responsibility
for maintaining a cleaner environment
along with Housing resources over
weekends as in our Row Houses, we
will ultimately be able to maintain our
high cleaning standards over the full
week. Many students have suggested
this approach because they like to feel
"at home" on weekends and do not
necessarily want to be disturbed by
staff trash collection routines on Satur
day mornings.
We value student input on this issue.
Please send any comments to Imogen
Hinds at ichurch@stanford.edu.

Bravman responds to UAC Edit

The Daily's lead editorial on Sept.
25 ("The UAC: A headless horse
man") alleged a "disinterest the Uni
versity has taken in finding a new
leader" for the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center. While appropriately
underscoring some of the challenges
we face in academic advising, The
Daily has not presented a fair and bal
anced account of our search for new
leadership both for the UAC and
for undergraduate advising as a
whole. This search has been deliber
ate and not "dithering."
After an initial and unsatisfactory
search for a director of undergraduate
advising over a year ago, we decided to
substantially rethink our advising
needs, and proposed to the University
president and provost a new position
with no precedent: A faculty director
of undergraduate advising whose
aegis includes both pre-major and
major advising. The search process
broadened to include scores of indi

vidual faculty interviews, as well as a
redefinition of the UAC staff director
a managing director that will report
to the faculty director of advising.
The latter search will continue once
our new faculty director of advising,
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein, has
had some time in office to think about
the best configuration for his staff.
In the interim, as The Daily points
out, Chip Goldstein has more than suc
cessfully handled the task of maintain
ing the UAC's daily operations and the
services it provides to thousands of stu
dents. I most heartily agree with The
Daily's wish that Zipperstein's ap
pointment "will usher in a new era of
faculty involvement with the freshman
advising program," but no one should
be under the illusion that there are any
simple solutions at hand.
The Daily accurately reports the
decline of faculty involvement with
freshman advising. Rather than at
tribute this drop to the departure of the
previous director, or the delay in ap
pointing a new one, there is no simple
explanation. The percentage of faculty
engaged in freshman advising has
dropped steadily over the past decade.
But in the same period of time, Stan
ford has effected extraordinary im
provements in undergraduate educa
tion. Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nars, Overseas Seminars, the Toyon
sophomore residence program,
Sophomore College, Honors College,
the Freshman Sophomore Residential
College and Departmental Grants for
Undergraduate Research, for in
stance, are all younger than the Class of
'O7. These initiatives have helped pro
vide the highest level of student-facul
ty engagement at Stanford in the mod
ern era, but at the same time have con
tributed to a decline in the number of
faculty who are able to serve, in addi
tion, as freshman advisors.
Clearly, improving undergraduate
advising and its more important
cousin mentoring is high on our
list of aspirations, and remains as a
challenge for us to address. Hasty ap
pointments to any position within this
enterprise will only delay the achieve
ment of our goals.

weekends as in our Row Houses, we
will ultimately be able to maintain our
high cleaning standards over the full
week. Many students have suggested
this approach because they like to feel
"at home" on weekends and do not
necessarily want to be disturbed by
staff trash collection routines on Satur
day mornings.
We value student input on this issue.

Bravman responds to UAC Edit

The Daily's lead editorial on Sept.
25 ("The UAC: A headless horse
man") alleged a "disinterest the Uni
versity has taken in finding a new
leader" for the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center. While appropriately
underscoring some of the challenges
we face in academic advising, The
Daily has not presented a fair and bal
anced account of our search for new
leadership both for the UAC and
for undergraduate advising as a
whole. This search has been deliber
ate and not "dithering."
After an initial and unsatisfactory
search for a director of undergraduate
advising over a year ago, we decided to
substantially rethink our advising
needs, and proposed to the University
president and provost a new position
with no precedent: A faculty director
of undergraduate advising whose
aegis includes both pre-major and
major advising. The search process
broadened to include scores of indi

vidual faculty interviews, as well as a
redefinition of the UAC staff director
a managing director that will report
to the faculty director of advising.
The latter search will continue once
our new faculty director of advising,
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein, has
had some time in office to think about
the best configuration for his staff.
In the interim, as The Daily points
out, Chip Goldstein has more than suc
cessfully handled the task of maintain
ing the UAC's daily operations and the
services it provides to thousands of stu
dents. I most heartily agree with The
Daily's wish that Zipperstein's ap
pointment "will usher in a new era of
faculty involvement with the freshman
advising program," but no one should
be under the illusion that there are any
simple solutions at hand.
The Daily accurately reports the
decline of faculty involvement with
freshman advising. Rather than at
tribute this drop to the departure of the
previous director, or the delay in ap
pointing a new one, there is no simple
explanation. The percentage of faculty
engaged in freshman advising has
dropped steadily over the past decade.
But in the same period of time, Stan
ford has effected extraordinary im
provements in undergraduate educa
tion. Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nars, Overseas Seminars, the Toyon
sophomore residence program,
Sophomore College, Honors College,
the Freshman Sophomore Residential
College and Departmental Grants for
Undergraduate Research, for in
stance, are all younger than the Class of
'O7. These initiatives have helped pro
vide the highest level of student-facul
ty engagement at Stanford in the mod
ern era, but at the same time have con
tributed to a decline in the number of
faculty who are able to serve, in addi
tion, as freshman advisors.
Clearly, improving undergraduate
advising and its more important
cousin mentoring is high on our
list of aspirations, and remains as a
challenge for us to address. Hasty ap
pointments to any position within this
enterprise will only delay the achieve
ment of our goals.

Janitor article contains errors

Editor's Note: On Sept. 24, The Daily
published an article "Janitors return
to standard work week" with several
factual errors, including quotes that
were incorrectly attributed to Rodger
Whitney, the executive director of stu
dent housing.

We are writing to correct some mis
information printed in The Stanford
Daily ("Janitors return to standard
work week," Sept. 24).
First, the notion that "changes
were solely due to the custodial staffs
preference for working Monday
through Friday" is not correct. Custo
dians, who either volunteered or were
hired directly into the Tuesday-Satur
day shift, made the choice to work on
Saturdays. Staff schedule preferences
were not the reason for revising the
six-day custodial service this year.
In reality, the pilot program change
was made because both supervisors
and custodial staff felt the trash levels
on Monday had not been significantly
reduced. Also, the shift arrangement
was not improving service since staff
were only collecting trash and not
cleaning on weekends, and the staff
was then spread too thin on Monday
and during the week. The expectation
of this revised program (back to five
days for now) is that overall cleanli
ness of all undergraduate residences
will actually get even better, especially
during the week.
Secondly, the statement, "There
are currently no plans to try the six-day
custodial cleaning schedule again" is
not accurate. Student Housing Ser
vices is looking at the need for an al
ternative approach to weekend clean
ing rather than dropping the program,
as was stated clearly by Imogen Hinds
in her letter to returning students.
Once we return to some weekend-ser
vice model, we will inform all students.
Finally, the most concerning part of
the article is related to a quote stating,
"In response to student concerns,
Whitney suggested that students
should have 'more respect for the
place they live in' and that they should
take an active part in keeping their res
idences clean." This quote is blatantly
not accurate and this statement was

never made by Whitney. Students
generally have great respect for their
homes and this is valued and appreci
ated by our custodians and staff. Stu
dent Housing, not students, has the
overall responsibility to help maintain
the cleanliness, safety and long-term
care of our buildings.
However, if students in residences
can continue to help us clean-up after
events and assume some responsibility
for maintaining a cleaner environment
along with Housing resources over
weekends as in our Row Houses, we
will ultimately be able to maintain our
high cleaning standards over the full
week. Many students have suggested
this approach because they like to feel
"at home" on weekends and do not
necessarily want to be disturbed by
staff trash collection routines on Satur
day mornings.
We value student input on this issue.

Hinds at ichurch@stanford.edu.
