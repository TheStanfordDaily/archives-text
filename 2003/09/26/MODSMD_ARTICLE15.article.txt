## Get your own perks! 
### 
Ahh Stanford, the land
where students still swipe
their ID cards when die
door at Arrilaga is un
manned and open; where stop sign
running bikers actually turn around
and return to the cops on foot to get
ticketed; and in Big Game season,
where the athletically challenged
unite and pull fervent all-nighters pro
tecting ... the Axe? Has the Axe
Committee ever thrown a football, or
talked to a player? That's right kid
dies, things are a bit different in the
place people affectionately refer to as
"the Bubble."
Let's get something straight from
the start.

I don't like to watch sports, I like to
talk about them. Like everyone in in
tramurals and the rest of us too elitist
for intramurals, I was once an athlete
myself and have long since traded in
my adolescent glory days for ballet
classes. Ballet or
rugby, Stanford or
Palo Alto, things
aren't really differ
ent here on the in
side. The speed of
light stays constant
and I-Hum still

sucks.
So why is it so
surprising that ath
letes get special
perks? Free Stan-

ford paraphernalia, quality physical
therapy, free tuition for most of the
football team and a few other people,
and sometimes even golf carts. I fell
into a pothole sophomore year and re
quested a golf cart at the emergency
room. The doctor laughed at me.
How about ridiculously nice off
campus housing, meetings with CEOs
of important companies, and boosters
who fawn over you, cook for you and
sometimes even try to set you up with
their high school daughters? Boost
ers, by the way, are rich individuals
who support Stanford Athletics. Kind
of like groupies, but adults.

As rumors circulate as to what re
ally goes on and what doesn't, what is
NCAA legal and what isn't, allow me
to clarify: Yes, some athletes do regu
larly get propositioned for group sex,
and no, the cross country runners
aren't those "some." And you
thought it was unfair when Stern start
ed serving athletes bigger steaks?
OK, so unevenly distributed perks
wouldn't fly in some socialist frame
works, but here they're a reality, and
you have three options: (1) walk onto
a well-funded team yourself; (2) get
inspired and try to change the system;
(3) find out how to maneuver your
way through it. Note that bitching and
m***ing is not an option.
Here's our practice problem: The
bike cop calls you back for running a
stop sign on a deserted street. You du
tifully turn around while I speed off, or
better yet, give the cop a fake name
and post office box. Is your ticket my
fault? You can follow suit, or follow a
more noble path and start a hunger
strike or an email petition.
At a school where most of us have
proudly colored within the lines and
dutifully labored through Princeton
Review books, it may sound counter
intuitive: Get your own perks! Why
hate on undergrads who so self-enter
prisingly sneak into EV couples hous
ing because you're stuck in a convert
ed broom closet with five other peo
ple, no windows and a meal plan that
charges you $144.90 (19-meal plan) a
week for peanut butter and jelly?
(Unless you're in Ricker, where it's
just jelly).
Stanford is an institution like any
other. You can either fight the system
for hooking other people up or you
can get your own perks. Like making
a buddy at Kinko's and xeroxing your
course reader, or taking a shopping
trip in Zimbabwe where the currency
is officially worth nothing to the dol
lar. Or become an eating club manag
er in Toyon and siphon off funds to
buy alcohol for you and your eating
manager friends.

Hey, the athletes work hard for
their perks, so I say good for them.
They give Stanford an amazing ath
letic reputation. And if you could
care less about sports, the influx of
hot bodies from sports recruiting is
a perk in itself for the rest of us.
Now go get your own perks, and get
creative. Try getting Stanford to
fund a eight-month stay in Rio de
Janeiro studying Carnaval, like I
did. And remember not to throw up
on the Senior Pub Night Mar
guerite next week or Parking and
Transportation Services will fine
you $lOO.
