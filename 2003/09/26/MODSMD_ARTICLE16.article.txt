# Card faces Washington schools
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After playing its first home match back on Sept. 5, well
before most students had arrived on the Farm, the No. 4
women's volleyball team (8-2, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
will get its first chance to play in front of a home crowd this
weekend against the Washington schools.
Stanford will face unranked Washington State on Friday
night and then take on the No. 13 Huskies Saturday.
"We're all really looking forward to playing our first
match in Maples," said sophomore Courtney Schultz, who
will be filling in at the libero position for the injured junior
defensive specialist Leahi Hall. "Maples can be a very in
timidating place for a visitor to play and it's always great to
have the fans and the band helping us through the match."
Entering the season, the Cardinal was slated to finish second
in the highly competitive Pac-10, well above both Washing
ton and Washington State, which were ranked No. 6 and No.
8, respectively.

However, with six conference teams ranked in the USA
Today / AVCA Coaches Top 25 Preseason Poll released on
Aug. 11 more than any other conference in the nation
the Pac-10 is strong from top to bottom.
In fact, the Cardinal, Cougars and Huskies all opened
Pac-10 play with two wins last weekend. Stanford traveled
to Oregon where it beat Oregon and Oregon State while
Washington (11-0,2-0 Pac-10) and Washington State (5-6,2-
0 Pac-10) both defeated No. 16 Arizona and Arizona State.
"They are both going to be tough matches," Schultz said.
"We try to only focus on the first before we begin to think
about the second, but both of these teams are quick and tal
ented and no team in the Pac-10 can ever be taken lightly."
In addition to defeating Arizona and Arizona State last
weekend, the Cougars are 4-1 in their last five matches and
have defeated two of the three ranked teams they have
faced. However, Stanford holds a 32-3 all-time edge over the
Cougars, with one of the Cardinal's losses coming last year
in Pullman.
Stanford holds a similar edge over the Huskies with a 36-
2 all-time record. The last time the Huskies defeated the
Cardinal was 1989.
Besides facing two strong teams, the Cardinal will be
somewhat shorthanded. In addition to the injury to Hall, se
nior setter Anna Robinson and senior Sara Dukes, who has
been playing on the right side, are both out with injuries.
Filling in for Robinson will be sophomore setter Katie
Goldhahn, who will be called on to play the entire match
after splitting the time with Robinson earlier in the season.
Junior Jennifer Hucke will replace Dukes.
The Cardinal will also need strong performances from its
healthy starters, including junior Ogonna Nnamani, fresh
man Kristin Richards and senior middle blocker Jennifer
Harvey.
Against Oregon, Nnamani led the team in kills, averag
ing 5.85 per game, while Richards was close behind with a
4.57 kills per game average.
Harvey contributed with 3.57 kills per game and was an
integral part of the Cardinal defense with 1.57 blocks per
game against the Ducks and Beavers.
Both games will begin at 7 p.m in and can be heard live
on KZSU 90.1 FM.

Seniors Anna Robinson and Sarah McGee have been instrumental parts of No.4 Stanford's 8-2 start. With Robin
son and two other starters sidelined with injuries, the reserves must step up if the Cardinal is to continue its winning
ways against Washington and Washington State this weekend.
