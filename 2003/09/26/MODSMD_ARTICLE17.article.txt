# Finally, soccer returns home
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The turf will be familiar and the fans will be wearing Cardinal
red, but the level of competition doesn't get any easier for the Stan
ford's men's soccer team (1-4-1) this weekend at the Stanford /
Nike Tournament.
Since starting the season 1-1, the unranked Cardinal (1-4-1) re
turns home after a brutal eight-day road trip, which included a 0-0
tie against No. 8 SMU and a 2-0 loss to No. 20 Tulsa.
Stanford kicks off the tournament on Friday against No. 24
Fairleigh Dickinson (3-1-1), which reached the Elite 8 last season
and has won the Northeast Conference title three straight years.
The match marks the home opener for Stanford and its first-ever
meeting with the Knights.
"[Fairleigh Dickinson] has a great team," Stanford head coach
Bret Simon said. "They won a tournament playing against Brown
and Yale [last weekend], and we lost to both of those teams."
Stanford will play again on Sunday, squaring off against UC-
Irvine (2-5). The Anteaters are looking to stop their five-game los
ing skid.
Cross-Bay rival Cal (3-3-1) rounds out the tournament field and
will play the Anteaters on Friday and the Knights on Sunday.
"It'll be a good opportunity for us to watch Cal in action [before
next week's matchup at Berkeley]," said Simon.
According to junior forward Matt Janusz, the good news for the
Cardinal is that the team's defense, which was shaky after losing its
stars to graduation, now has its feet on solid ground.
"The defense is mostly figured, it's come together," Janusz said.
But uncertainty still surrounds much of the lineup, especially at
the goalkeeper position.
At press time, the coaching staff had not announced whether ju
nior Robby Fulton would be ready for a return from the injured
list, or if freshman Andrew Kartunen would start in goal after
recording his first career shutout with 14 saves against SMU.
"We're nursing Robby back to health," Simon said. "But it's too
early to tell whether or not he'll start. We're actually very fortunate
[that his injury wasn't more severe]."
The other uncertainty around the squad lies in the offense,
which has only managed three goals so far.
"That has a lot to do with the fact that we're using more
freshmen than we have in the past," Janusz said. "But we're ex
perimenting."
Senior midfielder Mike Wilson believes that Stanford can walk
off with a pair of wins this weekend if the team is able to achieve a
higher level of consistent play.
"We just have to play 90 minutes of the great play that we're
only playing in patches," Wilson said. "We just have to play hard
for the whole 90 minutes."
"It's really good to be home," Janusz said. "It's a chance to start
over, it's the start of a new season for us."
