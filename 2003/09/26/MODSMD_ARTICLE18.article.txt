# IN FIRST SEASON, RYAN GETS HIS KICKS

### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
After the Cardinal men's soccer team lost six
vital players to graduation, freshman midfielder
Marcus Ryan knew he would have to step up this
season if Stanford was to make another run at the
College Cup.
While the team hasn't gotten off to the start it
had hoped for, Ryan, who came to Stanford
ranked 10th by Soccer America on its list of the
top NCAA soccer recruits, has held his own on the
field amid high expectations and is loving
every minute of it.
"I think I'm enjoying the game more since
coming here," Ryan said.
That's saying a lot, as Ryan moved from
Hawaii in his freshman year of high school in
order to play for the Colorado Rush, one of the
most impressive club soccer organizations in the
United States.
"Actually, I think they are the best team in the
country," Ryan said, though he admitted with a
laugh that he's probably biased.
In his career with the Rush, Ryan helped the
team to amazing success, including three State
Cups and a national second-place finish.
"The highlight of it all was probably regionals,"
Ryan said, "We went to a tournament and played
the best teams from the western 14 states, and we
ended up winning it."
Ryan was recruited by several top soccer pro
grams but picking Stanford out of the bunch was
an easy decision, he said.
"I've wanted to go to Stanford for as long as I
can remember," said Ryan, who grew up in the
Sacramento area and added that he was attracted
to Stanford's combination of athletic and academ
ic excellence.

Ryan has started all six games for the Cardinal
at his favorite position, attacking center midfield
er. While he is getting minutes on the field, the job
hasn't been entirely glamorous.
Partly due to constant formation and lineup
adjustments, the Stanford offense has struggled
this season, being out-shot 97-49 and scoring just
three goals thus far.
"This is a rough way to bring in a freshman
class," said head coach Bret Simon.
"We're using a lot of new players, and a lot of
the old players have been injured," senior captain
Mike Wilson added. "[Junior] Matt [Janusz] and
Darren [Fernandez] have played together for
years, but Darren's been hurt a lot. So we're real
ly asking for the new players to blend into this
lineup."
Janusz hopes to see the confidence level of his
teammates on offense rise.
"We just need to score some goals and that
comes from being confident and pushing forward
and taking chances," Janusz said.
Wilson admits that due to the pressure on the
midfielders and strikers to bring more intensity to
the game, Ryan has "a lot of weight on his shoul
ders."
Ryan said that it is difficult to feel strained
under the pressure of the season, because he loves
what he does so much.
"I just can't get over the raw enjoyment of it,"
Ryan said.
Wilson and Simon both expressed certainty
that Ryan will live up to his reputation.
"[Ryan] is so dangerous on the field; he's a
technically strong player," Wilson said, to which
Simon added:
"Marcus is very talented; he's quick and ag
gressive and very creative on the field.
"We're very lucky to have him."
