# TACKLING FAME, GORDON IN FOCUS
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Amon Gordon doesn't understand
why he's suddenly the focus of so much
attention.
"I've been ballin' for years," says
Stanford's standout defensive tackle.
True, but this year marks the first
time Gordon has been able to settle into
a starting spot and get comfortable. A
running back in high school, the 300-
pound junior saw time at linebacker and
defensive end for Stanford before being
moved to defensive tackle this year.
Now he helps anchor a run defense
that is ranked tops in the nation after two
games a defense that will be under
scrutiny against its first Top 25 competi
tion this weekend.
But it's not the scrutiny of the coach
es or the media that will be most impor
tant to Gordon when he takes the field
against Washington this Saturday. The
Seattle native will be playing in front of
his four-year-old daughter Jasmyn, his
mother Ava, his siblings and several
other family members.
"I'm excited to go back and play in
front of my folks and peers, go back to
where I came up," Gordon said. "I've
seen numerous games [at Husky Stadi
um], and we'll just get to be in an awe
some college football atmosphere."
Raised by his mother in South Seat
tle, Gordon traveled an uphill road to
Stanford.
"I've pretty much been the man of
my house since I was eightyears old," he
said. "It was quite a struggle," growing
up dealing with concerns like "how
you're going to make rent, how you're
going to eat, how you're going to get
clothes on your back."
Football was more than an extracur
ricular activity to Gordon.
"Playing sports was a way to stay out
of trouble," he said. "It kept me off the
streets."
Now that it has led him to the Farm,
he is determined to make the most of his
opportunities.
"That's alii gotis my family," he said.
"I'm not only here for myself, I'm here
for them as well."
Gordon admits that an NFL con
tract would be the ultimate payoff and a
boon for his family, but says he's in no
hurry to leave campus.
"Right now I'm enjoying the college

experience," he said
Regarding former Stanford wide
receiver Teyo Johnson, a longtime
friend from Seattle who now plays
for the NFL's Oakland Raiders,
Gordon said, "I wouldn't say [l'm
hoping to] follow his footsteps
I've got to blaze my own trail. It'd be
nice to be where he's at, is all."
If he keeps putting on the kind of
performances he did against Brigham
Young last Saturday, when he sacked
quarterback John Beck and generally
played like a human wrecking ball, NFL
scouts will certainly take notice.
For now, Gordon is pouring his en
ergy into making sure opposing quarter
backs and running backs notice him. He
said he spends a couple of hours every
day watching film to upcoming games,
and despite his early success, he thinks
he has a lot more to learn about his own
role in Stanford's defensive scheme.
"You just find something daily, no
matter how big how small, just con
tinue to find something to improve
on," he said. "You can't become stag
nant, can't become content. Once you
get good at something, you have to
get ready to do something else and
face a different opponent."
His work ethic has helped him adjust
quickly each time he changes position.
Defensive coordinator Dave Tipton
said Gordon's experience as a line
backer and a pass-rushing defensive end
make him a unique force at defensive
tackle.
"He's a really athletic 300 pounds,"
Tipton said. "He's really athletic and re
ally quick. I think he brings a real explo
siveness, he runs well, and he also brings
a take-no-prisoners attitude.
"He knocked [BYU's] quarterback
out of the game for a while last week."
Gordon isn't afraid to admit
that he takes pleasure in pummel
ing his opponents.
"There's nothing like a big hit," he
said. "Nothinggetsyourblood goinglike
that, just the power of the clean hit The
kind where everybody's like, 'Oooh.'"
Tipton said he sees Gordon as one of
the defense's leaders.
"He never had the silver spoon given
to him," Tipton noted. "He's had a
tough life, and he's battled through that,
and I'm proud of him. It seems like he's
on the right track, and he's got a bright
future ahead of him."
