# Card can only hope to contain Williams
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Does Stanford really have a complete
understanding of the pitfalls of Reggie
Williams?
The last time the Cardinal faced the
ultra-dangerous Washington wide receiv
er, things were different. Stanford was
ranked in the top-10, alumni were still pat
ting Tyrone Willingham on the back and
Reggie was still a freshman starting to
break out of his shell.
In that game, which the Huskies won
42-28, Williams had three catches for 74
yards-including a touchdown before in
conspicuously leaving the game with a
thigh contusion.
Flash forward two years.
Williams is now a valiant, self-assured
(bordering on arrogant) junior, consensus
preseason All-American and owner of nu
merous UW and Pacific-10 Conference re
ceiving marks.
The 6-foot-4, 225-pound wideout from
Lakewood, Wash, has put up some unbe
lievable numbers that really do speak for
themselves.
Over the last two seasons, he has caught

149 balls the most by any Pac-10 receiv
er in history over such a time span.
His 1,454 receiving yards last season
were the fourth-best all-time in conference
history. Three games into his third year,
Williams is only 1,282 yards behind Troy
Walters' career Pac-10 mark for receiving.
In his last three regular-season games of
2002 Williams caught 35 passes and earned
the moniker "Mr. November." (And in two
games lining up opposite Washington
State's Marcus Trufant now a corner
back for the Seattle Seahawks Williams
caught 23 passes for 372 yards.)

Stanford, of course, has heard all about
this guy. They've watched film, talked to
opposing coaches and listened to all the
urban legends.
But they haven't seen Reggie since he's
really grown into the real Reggie.
Stanford coach Buddy Teevens, in a
suppressed rant of sorts, has no real solu
tion to this large, fast and looming problem.
â€¢ "You don't stop a guy like him," Teevens
said. "He's as good as there is nationwide.
"He's big, physical and athletic in the
air. He makes the tough catch and blocks.
He's difficult to press because he can get
off it and he's so fast that he's difficult to

run with."
Alrighty, then.
What about how Teevens is planning to
contain Williams?
"Double, triple-team, tie him up, push
him to the sideline we've talked about
everything," Teevens said. "You have to
hope the QB has an off-day as well."
That scenario, however, isn't all that
likely. Washington's trigger man, senior
Cody Pickett, became the first quarterback
in conference history to eclipse 4,000 yards
passing last season (4,458) thanks in
large part to his impossible-to-bottle-up
counterpart.
"I probably wouldn't be where I am
without Cody," Williams said. "We have
that chemistry."
Reggie hasn't been as compatible with
the rest of his teammates, though start
ing with a little incident before he even
stepped on the field as a freshman.
As the story goes, Williams was at a
team dinner during training camp at The
Evergreen State College and got up to
answer a few questions part of the
Huskies' training camp ritual for the

Stanford defenders will have their hands full with Washington junior wide receiver Reggie Williams
this Saturday. Williams has 149 receptions over the past two seasons.
newbies.
At one point, the brash young re
ceiver said something about being bet
ter than everyone else in the room-and
so the veterans subsequently removed
Williams' hair during the night.
Reggie has since claimed that he
was joking, but this brazen demeanor
has at times rubbed his teammates
the wrong way.
Linebacker Greg Carothers re
cently told the Seattle-Post Intelli
gencer that the wide receiver's you

can't-bleeping-guard-me-attitude
has infuriated him many a time dur
ing practice.
"I didn't get along with Reggie for
two years because of the things he
said," Carothers said. "Being from
Montana, you don't act like that.
"But I spent a lot of time with him
over the summer and now I really do
like him. And I like how he plays."
So why does Williams talk so
much trash?
"I like to make it known that I'm
getting the job done," Williams said.
But he has other reasons as well.
"If I'm in [my teammates'] faces,

telling them 'you're not good,' then
that's a challenge and should force
[them] to get better."
Williams offered up a major chal
lenge to his teammates before the
season started, proclaiming to the
Seattle-area media that Washington
should go 13-0 and find itself in the
Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 the date of
the national championship game.
But when Reggie's Huslaes lost to
Ohio State 28-9 in college football's
opening weekend, Williams and com
pany had themselves quite a hum
bling experience.
Interestingly enough, Washington,

with both Pickett and Williams in the
lineup together, have posted only a
17-11 mark including two bowl
game losses-heading into tomorrow's
game.
So part of Williams' supposed
changed attitude has reflected a will
ingness to trade personal accolades
for wins.
"I'm just trying to win ballgames
and championships," he said. "A lot
of those guys who had records had a
championship or a Rose Bowl while
they were [at Washington]. I don't
have one of those yet, so that's what
I'm trying to do."
