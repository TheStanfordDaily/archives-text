# Among the Intermissionaries
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
When I received an email from my co-editor Nicole
Beckley over the summer with the precious line, "I'm
looking forward to influencing the tastes and prefer
ences of thousands of young co-eds ..." I knew I was
dealing with a dogmatic egomaniac.
I couldn't have been more ecstatic.
In this age of attenuated idealism and preempted
peace, what we needed is a single vision to guide us
through the good and evil of the entertainment world; to
reveal the frayed, black and white edges of the colorful
reality show formerly known as life. In Intermission, we
have a weekly dosage of that vision. And it is ours to
abuse.
But even that quarter-long abuse must begin with an
acknowledgement: Intermission, often described taste

lessly as the neglected stepchild of The Stanford Daily, is
just that. It offers the latest in music, movies, the arts, cul
ture, fashion, indie-rock, general wackiness and sex. It is
the permanent and only dwelling place of Roxy Sass,
Stanford's much-loved, oft-reviled yet always-revered
Sex Goddess. It rocks.
Further, everything you read in Intermission is or will
be or was true. Countless rumors will be confirmed on its
pages, others will be sent packing like the paparazzi. Our
features, ranging from a Brazilian bikini wax to skydiv
ing to an expose on psychics, are already part of Stan
ford's folklore and our quirky writers have been known
to accurately capture the American aesthetic in a manner
last attributed to Walt Whitman. Here, children, is
where the vernacular comes to be revitalized, where ex
pletives seek refuge from the censors, where life is lived
one last time every Friday.
But hark! We do not amuse ourselves with menial

tasks. Instead, we make the incredible lightness of being
more bearable with our discussions of weighty issues
such as Dick Cheney's sex life, J Lo's politically charged
thriller "Gigli," and the articulate sermonizing of The
Blue Man Group," among other things. You will read
things here that will shock you, delight you and excite
you: This where the husk of subjectivity shaved off by
our fair Daily staffers comes to marinate, to soak up the
latent energy. In other words, the opinions of our writ
ers are always the right ones. And we, the Intermission
aries, will attempt to touch your heart and soul, while
Roxy will touch your boxers and panties. These are
promises. They fill be fulfilled.
And so, the journalistic lollapalooza begins. Armies
are being drafted. Life, as they say in a certain record
company, is almost in the House. And chances are, if
you enjoy the Intermission, you'll stay for the whole
show.
