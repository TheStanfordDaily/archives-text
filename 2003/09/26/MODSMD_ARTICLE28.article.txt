# Evict Stiller from 'Duplex'
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
What has happened to Danny DeVito? The short,
pudgy actor who once played Arnold Schwarzenegger's
unlikely brother in "Twins" used to be enough of an
oddity onscreen, an immediate visual pun whose insis
tent energy may have been overcompensating but was

at least reliably entertaining.
These days, DeVito appears to be stick
ing his fingers into every other facet of the

business, content to play bit parts while slid
ing behind the scenes into the more respon
sible role of producer. His producing record
thus far has been something of a pleasant
surprise, a pair of slick Elmore Leonard
adaptations ("Get Shorty" and "Out of
Sight") and Steven Soderbergh's earnest
"Erin Brockovich" are the highlights.

"Duplex," however, is DeVito's latest foray into di
recting, after the disastrous dark comedy "Death to
Smoochy." While "Duplex" doesn't altogether con
demn his abilities as a director, it does serve as an indi
cator of some questionable sensibilities.
Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore star as Alex and
Nancy, a mildly affluent New York couple (aren't they
all?) who find the perfect apartment in the middle of
Brooklyn. The catch: The upper floor of the duplex
they're eyeing is inhabited by a little old Irish lady
(Eileen Essel), whose charming Mrs. Doubtfire lilt
convinces them that she will be a perfectly hospitable
neighbor.
This, of course, is hardly the case. Immediately after
they've settled in, (lie sweet old granny turns out tube a
major headache: First she leaves her blaring television
on at all hours of the night, then calls upon the couple to
fix her pipes, catch mice, take out the trash and go shop
ping with her during the day. This is all stressful to writer
Alex because he's on a strict deadline to finish his next
book, which seems to be about—surprise!—the saga of

a family of New Yorkers.
How the movie escalates into an outright war be
tween the tenants, with Alex and Nancy plotting nu
merous schemes to actually kill the old lady, is down
right painful to watch. The script utilizes an alarming se
quence of obvious misunderstandings and liberal con
trivances that make you realize what a precious com

modity even stupid comedy is these days
"Meet the Parents" looks like gold
next to this stuff. Ben Stiller, by now the
quintessential straight man for slapstick, is doing
I nothing he hasn't done before, and Barry-
G more plays nothing but reaction shots.
Looking at Stiller's affable, Cro-
L Magnon pate and Barrymore's familiar lay-
I ers of baby fat, I was struck by how little I ac
tually cared for these characters, how paper
| thin their lives were; not for a second did
Stiller's frantic typing at a computer con

vince me that he was actually capable of writing anything
of merit, and DeVito appears to believe that populating
Nancy's workplace with familiar faces (a wasted Maya
Rudolph and Wallace Shawn) serves as enough back
story in and of itself.
The real problem lies with the movie's tone; for a dark
comedy, it simply doesn't go for enough. Alex, Nancy
and even the old lady remain perfecdy likeable for most
of the movie, their "cruel" misfortunes easily solvable in
real life. The script seems unsure of whether to save or
skewer its characters, and without an easily discernible
villain or a hint of malice towards its protagonists it winds
up being completely irrelevant.
The finale attempts to pull the rug out from under us,
but I have to confess that by then I'd already taken my
interest with me and left the duplex. What should prob
ably be an outrageously dumb ending—particularly for
those who have seen other current releases in theaters,
like a certain Nicolas Cage film—was instead a sheer de
light, the perfect frustrating cap to an evening entirely
devoid of fun or surprise.
