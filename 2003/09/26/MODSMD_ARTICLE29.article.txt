# Don't get caught in this 'Rundown'
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
The makers of' The Rundown" start with a single as
sumption: If you're watching our movie, you're proba
bly dumb.
As a sharp young Stanford student, you may not
think this assumption applies to you. But if you find
yourself sitting down to this new offering from the pro
ducer of 'The Scorpion King," my advice is to play
along. Don't think about particle physics before "The
Rundown." Don't have a debate about free will versus
determinism. Just try to be dumb. It'll help.
If you get stupid enough, you won't notice continuity er
rors like Rosario Dawson's glass getting fuller as she drinks
out of it (she must be an optimist). You won't feel cheated
when seemingly important plot points go unresolved. And,
if you do a really good job, you might even have some fun.
The character portrayed by the Rock (yes, the pro
wresder) is a bounty hunter named Beck presum
ably the writers didn't want to burden their star with too
many new letters who dreams of opening a restau
rant. Before he can get out, he's got one last job: Go to
a town called El Dorado in the Amazon rainforest, and
retrieve Travis Walker (Seann William Scott, a.k.a. Sti
fler of "American Pie" fame), the Stanford dropout son
of big boss Billy Walker.
Turns out Travis is in El Dorado looking for (you're
dumb, remember, act surprised) a golden treasure
called El Gato. Also after the treasure are Hatcher
(Christopher Walken), a mine owner who is appealing
ly philosophical in his avarice, and Mariana (Rosario
Dawson), a barmaid-turned rebel leader with a heart of
the same material as El Gato.
Travis, Beck and Mariana end up bushwhacking
through the jungle in search of El Gato, in a trek that

includes predictable amounts of ass-kicking and a sur
prising lack of hot threesome action. That's because
Beck's too noble to hit it with Mariana. He's also too
noble to use a gun. He's not, however, above playing for
a few laughs and that's where the fun comes in.
The Rock spends much of 'The Rundown" doing
what The Rock does best, which is striding away from
explosions wearing a steely grimace. But he also finds
time to take notes on radio cooking shows. And get
humped by a monkey. In short, he doesn't take himself
too seriously, and watching the former Scorpion King
loosen up is one of the film's distinct pleasures.
Another is Hatcher. The mining czar has enough
Walken weirdness he tries to explain the mission to
his band of thugs using an analogy about the tooth fairy
to make him engaging and even sympathetic.
But don't watch the film for character. If you do,
you'll start asking questions about Travis is he a jerk?
Is he a visionary? Does he want El Gato for money, or is
he really motivated by intellectual curiosity? When
none of these questions get answered, you'll realize
Travis is little more than Stifler Lite, a surfer dude
whose wisecracks are as lame as his fighting moves.
And you might start wondering why Beck doesn't
use guns. Some mishap in his past, perhaps? Did he
shoot a puppy? Filling us in on this would require a
sense of continuity, with which "The Rundown" can't be
bothered. Instead we get, "When I pick up a gun, bad
things happen."
If you know what's good for you, you'll try to become
the kind of person for whom this explanation is suffi
cient. You'll sit back and watch the Rock kick ass - don't
miss the scene where he clocks a guy with a turntable.
Think of "The Rundown" as a warm-up exercise.
Maybe when it's over, you'll be ready to appreciate pro
wrestling.
