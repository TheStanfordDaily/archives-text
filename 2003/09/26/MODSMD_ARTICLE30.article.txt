The Bad.
"Las Vegas," 9 p.m.

You won't hit the jackpot with this, an over-the
top drama set in Las Vegas that is half "CSI,"
half "Thieves" â€” and as compelling as watch
ing old timers gamble. Danny (Josh Duhamel)
is a casino roamer who works for James Caan
and dates her daughter. Tensions mount. Peo
ple shout. We snore. A

The Good.
"Whoopi."
8 p.m.

Who knew that Whoopi
Goldberg could be funny
again? We sure didn't cer
tainly not after "Hollywood
Squares," "Monkeybone"
and "How Stella Got her
Groove Back." But Whoopi's
got her groove back now,
with this comic sitcom gem.
She plays Mavis, a hot

worker that's a touch more
energetic than Bob Newhart
The writing is quick. The cast
is quicker. And a stand out,
among several strong perfor
mances, is Omid Djalili as
Nasim, an Iranian handy
man that keeps the laughs
running like a good faucet.

The not-so-ugly guy
Christopher Gorham
Jake 2.0, UPN

The hottest new computer of the fall is
. . . Christopher Gorham? In the new
UPN show 'Jake 2.0," the budding actor
from Fresno, Calif, plays the eponymous
lead character a machine that looks
human. Here's what Gorham had to say
when we pushed some of his buttons:
In the epic battle of all time, who would win
you or Spider-Manf
At this point, Spider-Man would prob
ably kick his ass, Fd have to say. Jake s still
kind of getting used to everything, and
Spider Man's fond of an old pro. So, I'd
give it to Spidey.
Are you sure? I saw those one-armed pulls
ups you were doing. Tobey Maguire can't do
that.

[Tobey's] a small man, I have to say.
He's not very tall, so yeah, I think I could
probably take him. But not on the basket
ball court though. He'd kick my ass on the
basketball court.

You re from Fresno. Does that mean you were
a farm boy?
[Laughs.] "I guess, but I didn't grow up
on a farm, so not really. Fresno's kind of
an agricultural town, but it's on the out
skirts. I kind of equate it to a giant sub

Other than a sense of humor, you have some
thing most WB stars don't a wife. Do the
groupies scare her?
She's fine with them as long as they
keep their distance. [When on 'Popular, 1
I used to get tons of mail from 13-year-old
girls and Tike, 45-year-old men.
They watched "Popular"?
Yean, well, you know, 45-year-old gay
men.
