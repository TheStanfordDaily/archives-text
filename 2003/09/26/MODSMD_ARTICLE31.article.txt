# Dave proves he is 'Some Devil'

### ERIN LASHNITS 
Dave Matthew's new solo album, "Some Devil," sur
passed my expectations. Big time. Admittedly, my expecta
tions were pretty much at rock bottom, but with the recent
releases from the Dave Matthews Band, I was prepared for
an utterly mediocre album.

Some Devil follows in the wake of DMB's mega-hit
"Everyday," which was monotonous and boring after listen
ing to it more than three times. Matthews's artistry has been
stagnating since the late nineties, but with "Some Devil" he
is finally reaching out in new directions and developing his
music with the help of a well assembled band.
Tim Reynolds, an old friend and frequent contributor to
Matthews's work, makes appearances throughout the
album, as well as on a bonus disc of live

recordings. Trey Anastasio of Phish also contributes his dis
tinctive flair to the album with a light frolicking guitar intro
to the deceptively bright sounding first track, "Dodo," and

with electric guitar and keyboard throughout the rest of the
album.
Matthews also draws on an exhaustive list of resources to
flavor individual
songs on the album. The Seattle music Group's string or
chestra (along with
Matthews himself on the sitar) provide a lilting background

to Anastasio's Grateful Dead-esque guitai
riffs on the second track "So Damny
Lucky," and /j
the Total Experience Gospel Choir adds y
backing vocals on "Save Me." Another
track to note is "Up Up and Away," which

has a great reggae influence with a Jamaican backbeat and
electric organ underneath Matthew's signature fluctuating
falsetto.
While "Some Devil" is just as chilled-out as Everyday and
Busted Stuff, the
songs are more interesting and don't lose their appeal after

two or three
times through the album. The only time the quiet atmos
phere of the album

seems a little plodding is in the double versions of the first
single released, "Gravedigger."

For a song about living forever, dying too soon, and bury
ing babies, it is suitably dark and depressing, but fails to pop

with a change in tempo or mood. The
lyrics are interesting, using lines from the
children's' rhyme "Ring around the
Rosy" in an obscure reference to the
plague, and the electric version makes
better use of the guitar lines, but the

acoustic version at the end drags the album to a close.
Even though "Some Devil" is only a side project for
Matthews as he works on new material with the rest of the
members of DMB, it is a good omen. His creativity is coming
out again in his writing, and while Some Devil is far from
perfect, it's definitely a step in the right direction.
