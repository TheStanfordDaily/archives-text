# John steps out of 'Squares'
## 
### JIMMY LIN 
When John Mayer released the Grammy-winning
"Room For Squares" in 2001, music listeners were treated
with a sound that wasn't necessarily groundbreaking but in
stead was refreshingly different and addictive. With his dis
tinctive vocals, impressive guitar skills, and catchy hooks,
Mayer proved that one could build a mainstream following
while still maintaining artistic credibility. And with the re-re
lease of his independent album "Inside Wants Out" in
2002, the songwriter showed how strong his tunes were
even without the backing of a major production studio.
Now comes Mayer's next release, the ambiguously ti
tled "Heavier Things".

The first taste many have had of this album is "Bigger
Than My Body," a song so spirited that it's impossible
not to sing along with the lines, "Someday I'll fly/Some
day I'll soar." As reminiscent as this single is of "Room
For Squares," it is a little misleading as to what the rest of

"Heavier Things" has to offer.
The new album is a welcome departure from what
many have come to love about Mayer's music. Gone are
the immediately catchy tunes that draw you in. Gone are
the lighthearted, straightforward lyrics. And gone is the
heavier prominence of Mayer's guitar-playing skills.
Rest assured, this isn't an album you can pop in the car
with a bunch of friends and start singing along to.
However, what this album offers is a deeper glance
into the strength of Mayer's songwriting skills. With the
exception of "Bigger Than My Body," each song relies
on slowly drawing the listener in. There's more empha
sis on absorbing the meaning behind each track, rather
than getting the listener to immediately bob one's head
up and down to the beat. Two of the album's stronger
tracks, "Split Screen Sadness" and "Something's Miss
ing" are perfect examples of this.

Mayer also tackles some issues on the album that one
might not expect him

to. On "Daughters," he stresses the importance of par
ents treating their daughters well. On "Home Life," he

shows some concern toward;
possibly living "Just some A
string of incompletes." It's a fj
small departure, but it shows It
Mayer aiming to slowly move \
away from the love-heavy sen
timent of his
debut album.

"Heavier Things" definitely appeals to a smaller au
dience than "Room For Squares" appealed to. Casual
fans may be disappointed by it, but those who have fol
lowed Mayer from the beginning will recognize that
these are the types of songs that he is most comfortable
playing. The album may take some time getting used
to, but that's part of its allure. Some may think that
Mayer is reinventing his sound; others will just consid
er it a refinement.
