All greatness- whether shooting along the pinball trajectory
of David Bowie's life or riding the flat hump of the Beatles' ca
reer-eventually implodes in cliche. In other words, shit hap
pens, shit evaporates and shit becomes banal. And this is a fact:
Cliches are hated, but like a certain band called Radiohead, they
are also the only things we ever agree on.

vb So, whether or not you witnessed the spectacular meltdown
of indie-pretension at Shoreline this Tuesday, let us agree on
this: Raaiohead is the greatest fucking band in the world. Be
cause when the walking seizure known as Thom Yorke erupts
at the mike with the Orwellian "2+2=5" and spills bile at you
for "not paying attention," you sit back, and for the love of holy
bejeezus, you do just that. You pay your money and you pay
your attention, you let the little man writhe and sing "the rain
drops" over and over again ("Sit Down, Stand Up"), until the
whips up a sonic storm that lasts for two hours. The Ox
ford quintet ripped through 21 songs and two encores: the
opening band-the superlative Supergrass-through no fault of
their own, seemed mild in comparison.
And to think that they're still doing it for the kids!? The best
songs in the concert come neither from the arena-rocking "The

Bends" ("My Iron Lung" was on the set list), the brusque tech
no-scapes of "Ok Computer" ("Paranoid Android" and
"Airbag") nor the supposedly ballsy "Hail To The Thief' (the
new album) but from DNA stranded chill of "Kid A" The tide
song, which always reminded me of a buzzing fridge, now
sounds triumphant and warm- the drums kick in and Thorn
croons about "Rats and children" following him as he does an
improvised jig. "Idioteque," as always, defies gravity and the
three guitars create a density that strangles all Aphex-Twin
comparisons for good.
While the Greenwood bros shoe-gaze in tandem, Ed 'O
Brien impresses with his sheer virtuosity: He slashes through
the naked vocals on "Backdrifts" and plays a wicked solo that
sounds like steel being welded (melodiously). The concert con
firms that the band is notjust a vehicle for Yorke's sublime voice:
all the band members sweat talent, wielding drums, synthesiz
ers and guitars at various points in the show. Then, as you
stretch on the grass-Thorn Yorke sweeps up a song "Lurgee"
from their disavowed debut album and teases you: 'There are
two reasons we're playing a song from our first album and I
can't tell you either." For a moment, you can see the arena-band
that Coldplay tries to imitate, and it's scary that that was so ten
years ago.
And even though this is largely a liberal crowd-skinny guys

in skinny ties-the political statements are pulled off on the sly:
on "You and Whose Army" (from "Amnesiac"), Yorke hunch
es over a piano and stares into the camera, gesturing with his
index-finger for the crowd to take him on as he mouths "you
and your cronies." It's a privilege very few bands enjoy-U2
among them- and no one in the current crop does it better than
Radiohead.
The biggest surprise of the evening, ironically, is the lul
laby sweep of "No Surprises"-which is delivered with a
heart-wrenching earnestness. And when Yorke romps
through the angry "Wolf At The Door"-certainly the closest
he has come to rap-the Radiohead formula is laid bare. This
band is special because they can arc from anger to transcen
dence in the course of one verse. And make no mistake
about it: Radiohead are no introverts; the only way they can
atone for the sadness they force upon us is by totally rocking
out in concert.
But it's almost over now. The band is playing "Everything
In Its Right Place" for a finale: Yorke is sermonizing about suck
ing lemons from the altar of his piano, while Ed and Jonny over
state the sonic trickery with turntables. Stars crackle over shim
mering stripes in the backdrop. And Yorke's voice, captured
and distorted by the turntables, is for a moment, no longer his.
Just like the music, it has come to belong to all of us.
