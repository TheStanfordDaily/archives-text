# Summer of love?
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY DESK EDITOR 
In case you made good on your
promise to sleep in all summer,
here's a rundown of what hap
pened.
Cinematically speaking, sum
mer boasted a ton of high action
low plotfare (see "Charlie's Angels:
Full Throttle", "Bad Boys II"), a
few worthwhile but light picks
("Legally Blonde 2," "The Italian
Job") and a big bomb ("Gigli," not
the Ben-Jen romance).
But summer was dominated by
two powerful forces: Johnny Depp
and a little fish named Nemo. Just
when you thought Depp was
going to disappear behind a dark
mane of indifference into cinemat
ic oblivion, after such fare as
"From Hell" and "Astronaut's
Wife," he returned to shine in "Pi
rates of the Caribbean" and to steal
the show in "Once Upon a Time in
Mexico."
The success of "Chocolat" and
"Blow" helped re-solidify Depp's
status as a bankable star, but "Pi
rates" took his lusty aloofness back
to the top. As for "Finding Nemo,"
the little fish tale stayed afloat for
nearly the entire summer, appeal
ing to a huge audience, young and
old alike.
The greatest impact of the film,
however, must be the resurrection
of Ellen DeGeneres. As the voice of
the titular fish, DeGeneres gar
nered both laughs and praise, and
took it as her cue to get back in the
spotlight, with her own TV talk
show this fall.
Musically, summer offered up
few truly outstanding forays. Bey

once's "Crazy in Love" (from her
solo album "Dangerously in
Love"), along with 50 Cent's "P-I-
M-P" and Ashanti's "Rock Wit
You" (not quite an act of lyrical ge
nius) dominated the airwaves.
Evanescence made a name for
themselves with their blend of fe
male vocal driven electro-rock, the
Ataris covered "Boys of Summer"
and Fountains of Wayne wrapped
up the summer with their kitschy
"Staci's Mom." Dylan's "Blowin' in
the Wind" never sounded so good.
Perhaps the biggest thrill of
summer however, was getting to
follow all the relentless celebrity
gossip. Ash ton and Demi? Look»,
ing to boost their careers and pro
files, the two started up a romance,
despite the fact that Ashton would
do better dating one of Demi's
daughters. Maybe if he got a hair
cut, became about 20 years older,
and developed a movie career .. .
oh wait, then he'd be Bruce Willis.
Ben and J.Lo? Are you for real?"
First there was the engagement,
then the shopping sprees, the
prime-time aren't-we-cute-we
cook-together special, and the . . .
break-up. Let's just hope that Matt
Damon finally talked some sense
into Mr. Affleck. Don't worry J. Lo
will be fine, her love don't cost a
thing.
Madonna and Christina and
Britney? Three publicity-loving
divas sharing open mouth kisses
on MTV what is the world com
ing to? We are talking about
Madonna after all. Besides, of the
couples mentioned, Madonna and
Britney would probably last the
longest. If it wasn't for Mo's pesky
husband and kids.
