### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Greetings from the trenches. While I've been around the
block several times, you may be new to the world of Roxy
Sass. So let me introduce myself to you. You can call me Roxy,
or Ms. Sass, if you want to be a formal. You could even call
me Prof. Sass, but we have to be careful because the Univer
sity frowns on professors talking to students in ways I intend
to talk to you.
Let me be frank, this is an advice column. I talk about sex,
relationships and love, usually in that order. This is not soft
core porn. (Hard-core porn, however, I have not ruled out.)
But it's not Abby either. Send me you questions and I'll tell
you no lies.
So first, the sex. Congratulations. You're in college now.
Let the kinky games begin. That girl sitting next to you in I-
Hum section may be in an altogether different position come
the weekend. That tall, dark and handsome fellow who al
ways asks for his hamburger undercooked in the dining hall
may be offering you raw meat come sundown.
Some may tell you that nobody has sex at this school. But
that is not true. Why do you think you have a PHE (Peer
Health Educator, for those of you who haven't picked up the
lingo)? They may say they re not there to hand out condoms,
but they've been trained in safe sex for a reason, and that rea
son may be sharing your narrow bed in the near future.
This quarter, Ms. Sass will also be wearing a hat as an edu
cator, and sometimes, that is the only article of clothing she
will be wearing at all. So, to begin this smarter, sexier Roxy,
freshmen should know that the SHPRC in Vaden offers all
sorts of under-the-covers goodies. Don't be shy. Showing up
is a sign that you are either having sex or plan to have sex.
This is excellent and by going you become a role model for
your entire dorm.
We have relationships at Stanford too. You remember
how you thought you were too busy in high school to date,
how you had to work long hours so you could get into Stan
ford? Bad news. You'll be even busier now that you re here.
Gads of activities, a new group of friends and classes filled
with people as smart as you don't leave much time for dating.
But you can find it.
Want to know how?
Never sleep.
If you never sleep you gain at least six hours a day. If you
must sleep, do it during the off hours of 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. That
way, you can still see all your new friends, take that 9 a.m.
class, do your problem set and get a few hours to mate before
your eyelids collapse under the pressure of your high-pow
ered lifestyle.
For those of you lucky enough to come to Stanford with a
significant other back home, I'm afraid I must warn you
about the infamous holidays Thanksgiving and Valentine's
Day. What's so scary about those, you ask?
First, beware of the Turkey Drop. You come home for
Thanksgiving eagerly anticipating the QT with your local
honey and you find out he's basting another.
Second, watch out for the V-day Heartbreaker. This
comes winter quarter right in time for the Day of Love. You
were envisioning a quick trip to Los Angeles to see your girl
friend and she tells you that she doesn't see any future for the
two of you.
And for those of you tearing your hair at the cynicism ex
pressed in this column, there is love at Stanford. It's rare, but
isn't it always? Just wait until your senior year when you look
at your partner and start to think, "gee, I love her, maybe I
should propose or something before we end up going to grad
school 3,000 miles away from each other and I have to face
the Turkey Drop all over again."
Seriously, though, you may find true love. And if you do,
drop me a line so I can pull you back into the abyss with the
rest of us.
