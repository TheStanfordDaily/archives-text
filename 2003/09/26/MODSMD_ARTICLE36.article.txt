By releasing his first novel
"Down and Out in the Magic King
dom" on-line simultaneous to its
dead-tree publication, science fic

tion writer L.ory Doctorow made a
splash as a forward-thinking

technophile. It's a
reputation that his in
terviews, his collabo

rative web log boing
boing.net and his work
for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation
have further cemented;

after all, this is the guy
that Amazon.com

founder Jeff Bezos and
cyberpunk guru Bruce
Sterling have pegged as
the future of science fic
tion.

Some of the stories in
Doctorow's debut collection
"A Place So Foreign and
Eight More" match his por

trayal as a rebellious futurist
visionary. "To Market, to
Market: The Rebranding of
Billy Bailey," for example, is a

satirical look at the way that
commercialism has permeated
society. And "OwnzOred," Doc
torow's argument for open
source code and file-sharing is

positively awash in hacker slang.
Both stories are written with the
confidence and conviction of a

man who thinks he understands
society, where it's going and where
it should be headed.
But although "To Market" and
"OwnzOred" are flashy, impressive
and convincing, they're not

the high

lights of the col-

lection. Those would be "A
Place So Foreign," "Shadow of the
Mothaship" and "Home Again,

Home Again."

In these stories, Doctorow
matches his ability for wild-yet
plausible ideas with more personal
and affecting material; each un
leashes a variation of the typical
Doctorow protagonist (an alienat
ed, displaced, angry young man)
on- respectively- a world grown
madly anachronistic through the
abuse of time travel, a society con
vinced that it's on the brink of
being destroyed by mysterious
alien intelligences and a building
where those alien intelligences
have imprisoned humanity's

crazy folk. Each weaves together
unending creativity with gentle
yearning, making for surpris
ingly powerful results.
"Home Again, Home

Again," in particular, isn't just
dazzlingly weird and searing
ly personal; it's a stylistic
tour-de-force, and its mov
ing climax is satisfyingly

apocalyptic.
It's hard not to compare
Doctorow to the hero of his
first story, "Craphound," a

treasure hunter who goes
careening from garage
sale to garage sale, rum
maging through endless

garbage in search of treasure. Doc
torow dives through the detritus of
Disney, MTV and Silicon Valley,
and, through writerly alchemy,
comes up with pure gold.
