## Alcohol probation for 3 Row houses 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Row houses Theta Delta Chi, 680
Lomita and Xanadu have all been
placed on a 30-day social probation for
violations of the no-alcohol policy that
was in place during New Student Ori
entation.
According to a press release from Di
rector of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo, the three houses "violated
the University policy of 'no alcohol' at
events during New Student Orientation,
failed to follow Party Planning Guide
lines and served alcohol to underage stu
dents who were present at social gather
ings at each of these houses."
"It was really not a big deal," said se
nior and Xanadu resident Christopher
.Dalton about the house's Band Run
pre-party on Friday night. "There was
beer and some hard liquor, but it was re
ally chill. There were only about 20 peo
ple because half of the house hadn't
moved in yet."
As a consequence for their actions,
the houses will have to participate as a
group in a program to examine their re
sponsibilities in planning events. In ad
dition, any future violations of the Party
Planning Guidelines or University event
policies could result in full alcohol pro
bation for the academic year.
"The probation is really stupid," said
sophomore Xanadu resident Vik Mal
hotra, who was not at the party.
"A house full of upperclassmen
should not suffer because of a rule
aimed at protecting frosh from drink
ing," added junior Xanadu resident
Grant Lee.
The social probation means that the
houses will not be allowed to host any
parties outside individual rooms and will
not be allowed to host any event with al
cohol.
However, because it is the beginning
of the quarter, the houses will be al

lowed to engage in "alcohol-free, house
bonding activities" like trips to San
Francisco.
According to a student at 680 Lomi
ta, a small gathering in a resident's room
on Saturday night grew into a gathering
of over 100 people and police were
called as students milled around the
area.
"While the 30-day probation is un
fortunate, the consequence of these
breaches in policy could have been more
substantial and burdensome given the
inherent illegalities of the evening," said
680 Lomita resident assistant Jose
Miguel. "I feel Residential Education
was understanding in allowing us to plan
house-bonding events with the stipula
tion that they be dry."
The decision to put the houses on so
cial probation came about yesterday
after Residential Education conducted
investigations and interviews with stu
dents, residential staff and new student
New Student Orientation staff members.
"Some people, myself included, do
think there was insufficient awareness
about NSO's alcohol policy," Miguel
said. "I personally believe that Residen
tial Education has recognized that and
will ensure a higher level of awareness
for next year."
Xanadu RA Jing Cai, a co-terminal
student, agreed that his staff was not aware
of the specific rules in place for NSO.
"The NSO policy was sent out by the
Row office on Sept. 18, but no one on
staff at Xanadu received it," Cai said.
"We made sure that no freshmen were
at the party, but what we were not aware
of was the seriousness of having any
party, regardless of size, with alcohol
during NSO. From our understanding,
this increased enforcement was a result
of increasing worries in the administra
tion about liability.
"Our penalty was deserved," he con

tinued. "University policy was violat
ed and risks should have been more
seriously considered."
Theta Delt fraternity president
Robby Bearman accepted news of
the probation in stride. The dean of
students' office is working in collabo
ration with Residential Education
because Theta Delt is also a Greek
organization. The case may be for
warded to the Organizational Con
duct Board, although no decision has
yet been made.
"We would like to make clear that
at no point on Saturday evening were
any freshmen present at our house,"
said Bearman. "Furthermore, Theta
Delt did not serve or make available
any alcohol to underage students. That
being said, we understand that the
event that took place on Saturday was
technically not allowed by NSO policy.
We are accepting the consequences of
our actions, and we are looking for
ward to the end of October, at which
time we will again be able to provide
social activities for Stanford students."
University policy for NSO stipu
lates that, "At no time should any
Stanford student provide, serve or in
any way have alcohol available to any
new undergraduate student. All stu
dent groups and residences will host
only alcohol-free parties during Ori
entation. This specifically means that
no alcohol is to be present, served, or
consumed at any parties in under
graduate residences during this time.
This includes upper-class residences
and houses on the Row."
In addition, the policy specifies
that students of legal drinking age
should consume alcohol privately
and responsibly.
Many students have questioned
the University's NSO alcohol policy
as a whole.
"I don't think that the frosh drink
ing during Orientation is such a big
deal," sophomore Mike Situ said.
"They're going to be drinking soon
anyway."
Despite the fact that three Row
houses were put on probation on the
same day, Camarillo had a positive
outlook on the incidents.
"I know and have great confidence
in the student management teams and
staff to build strong, healthy, respect
ful and legal communities despite this
unfortunate lapse," she said. "We will
continue to work on methods of insur
ing that each resident of house com
munities is clear on the importance of
maintaining an alcohol-free environ
ment during the period of NSO."
