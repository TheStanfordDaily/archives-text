# Med school unveils new curriculum
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
As the medical world pushes ahead, so
too does the Stanford School of Medi
cine.
; The school has introduced a new cur
riculum this fall that allows students to
(ievelop specialized medical interests
hnd to extend their clinical experience.
The medical school began formulat
ing these changes nearly a decade ago in
prder to keep up with a changing body of
knowledge. New discoveries often
change the medical field between the
time students learn the material and
begin their residencies. The focus of the
new curriculum is to keep students up
to-date so that they are better prepared
to treat patients during their residencies.
"This program is the first of its kind,"
said Julie Parsonnet, senior associate
dean of the medical school. "Our pro
gram has a noncompetitive atmosphere

and a flexible curriculum that we can
constantly build on. No other school can
match us in those respects."
The courses are now much more inte
grated than before as faculty works to
combine lectures with greater clinical ex
perience. First-year medical students
now have eight hours of clinical time
each week, as opposed to the one or two
hours available under the old curricu
lum.
The new program also decreases class
time in order to allow students the op
portunity to explore particular medical
subjects in depth. The school has devel
oped eight "scholarly concentrations"
similar to undergraduate majors that
give students time to focus specifically
on research and to avoid having to wait
for specialization until their residencies.
Students also have the opportunity to
stay for a fifth year to conduct research
within their particular concentration.
The medical school sponsors weekly

meetings, speakers and seminars for
the first-year students that offer insight
into the different concentrations. The
main purpose of these programs is to
help each student select the most ap
propriate concentration according to
his or her interests.
The concentrations already identi

fied by the school include biomedical
ethics and humanities, bioengineering,
biomedical informatics, immunology,
public service and community medicine,
women's health, health services and
policy research and molecular and ge
netic medicine.

"The seminars have really allowed
us to see the depth and breadth of the
things that are currently being explored
in the medical field," first-year medical
student Philip Kurien said. "When most
students leave medical school they have
the basics down but have not had the
chance to develop outside of them. I re
ally think that the new curriculum will
make us better doctors."

Though students have only been in
class for about a month, Parsonnet said
she senses incredible enthusiasm from
both students and faculty members who
have worked hard to smooth the transi
tion.

"We currently have two curricula
running at once," she said. "The first
year students are exploring the new cur
riculum, but the second-, third- and
fourth-year students have not yet transi
tioned to the new curriculum. This
stretches faculty, as they must teach the
same course in very different manners.
However, the faculty really seems to be
engaged in and dedicated to the
changes."
First-year medical student Deepika
Nehra agrees with Parsonnet. In her
short time at Stanford, she said she has
found that the professors have embraced
the new system.
"I think that the professors are very
aware and responsive to what is working
and what is not," Nehra said. "They are
really willing to work with us and to
make changes so that we don't waste
time. Overall, it is very nice to have pro
fessors who are so eager to make

more time in the clinical setting instead of the classroom.

changes if there are problems."
The new curriculum has indeed
led to minor problems during the
first few weeks of class at the med
ical school.
"There were some room sched
uling problems during the first

week, but with the size and nature
of the change, we did not expect it
to be perfect right away," Kurien
said. "Most problems have been lo
gistical and superficial."
According to Parsonnet, it is too
early to tell whether major prob
lems, if any, exist in the program.
However, as the year progresses
and the medical school receives
course evaluations from students
and professors, it plans to adjust
the curriculum accordingly.
