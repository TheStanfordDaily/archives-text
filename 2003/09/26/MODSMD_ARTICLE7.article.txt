# Senior Night now Pub-less
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
For this year's senior class, the word "pub"
wasn't the only thing missing last night from the
party formerly known as Senior Pub Night.
At this year's first Senior Night, as it is now called,
alcohol was banned on the Marguerites shuttling
students between Tresidder Union and Gordon
Biersch Brewing Company in Palo Alto, and throw
ing up on the bus resulted in a fine as always.
But this time, the no-drinking-or-vomiting rule
was more heavily enforced, and the fine of more
than $lOO was much higher than it had been at the
beginning of the previous year. Plus, after arriving at
the bar, seniors could expect their IDs to be checked
at the door, and those who weren't 21 years old were
turned away, even if they explained that they didn't
plan on drinking.
For the senior class, it was a reminder that as
Stanford's administration cracks down on alcohol
abuse, freshmen won't be the only ones affected by
stricter policies.
The reason behind the change is that though Se
nior Night is not held on campus, the University in
directly funds it, said Mikey Lee, a senior class
president.
He said the senior class presidents pay for Senior
Night with money from the class fund and use addi
tional University funding to rent Marguerites. Now
that the University is tightening its alcohol policy, it
is also being more stringent about requiring Senior
Night to follow University rules.
In past years, many seniors drank on Mar
guerites, invited underclassmen friends along to
their favorite bar and, often, took the party on the
bus with them. This year, seniors will be more heav
ily monitored at Senior Night, both by the adminis
tration and by parking and transportation services,
which wants to protect its brand-new fleet of Mar
guerites.
Still, the office of student activities has worked
together with the class presidents to come up with
the adjustments, including the name change and
mandatory carding.
While it doesn't make the presidents', and exec
utive cabinet's jobs easier, it brings this specific
event under University party policies, which have
not in the past been enforced to this extent, Lee said.
Seniors are especially riled up about the name
change, which they see as an unnecessary distinc
tion. But Joey Greenwell, assistant director of the
office of student activities, said it is a rule other stu
dents groups have also had to follow.
"I've asked students not to use bar night, or
happy hour, in names," he said. "Even though
they're not saying alcohol blatantly,
that's what the theme can be seen as."
Rajaie Wedge Batniji, one of last
year's senior class presidents, thinks
the name change is a good idea.
"Personally, I think the title Se
nior Night is actually more accurate,"
he said. "It won't be at a pub, every
week. Last year, we held pub nights at
the bowling alley, restaurants and
clubs in addition to the pubs.
"By placing the emphasis on the
senior, I think the title helps remind
everyone of what the night is about -
their classmates."
Batniji argues that seniors actual
ly drink less at Senior Nights than
they do at campus parties. But
Greenwell said the changes and
extra enforcement at this year's Se
nior Night are due in part to alcohol
related problems at last year's
events.
"Our class was a little out of con
trol," admitted Garrick Chak, Class
of 2003. He said the changes are un
derstandable but not ideal.
"[Carding at bars] is a California
law, so it doesn't surprise me, but it is
sort of weird because if you're a se
nior who is going to turn 21, you'll
feel left out," he said.
Indeed, seniors who haven't yet
reached legal age find the change
hard to swallow.
"There should be an option for se

niors to go as a senior class bonding
event and not drink," said senior
Dana Mauriello, 20, who doesn't
drink but was still banned from at
tending the event. "If the event is cen
tered around drinking, it's not a se
nior event."
Although some seniors do not
drink, the administrators and class
presidents say that it is not feasible or
legal to allow underage seniors to at
tend events held at bars and assume
they won't drink.
"This year, we're trying hard to re
duce chances of people getting sick or
worse and reduce liability," Lee said.
"Our decision to have stricter carding
comes as what we think is the best so
lution to allow only those over 21 to
drink."
Greenwell said the changes might
actually be good for the senior class.
"There is not going to be that big
of a difference in the event," he said.
"In some ways, it will even strengthen
the unity of the seniors because it is a
true senior event. In that regard, it
will bring that class closer together
and create a safer environment for
people to have a good time."
Lee said that in coming months
the class presidents and administra
tors might consider changing how Se
nior Night is managed, if seniors act
safely and responsibly.
"This collective responsibility will
be key in allowing us to reconsider
how we run this show each week," he
said. "Until then, we just have to take
some extra precautions. It only takes
one accident for it all to come un
done."

actually be good for the senior class.
"There is not going to be that big
of a difference in the event," he said.
"In some ways, it will even strengthen
the unity of the seniors because it is a
true senior event. In that regard, it
will bring that class closer together
and create a safer environment for
people to have a good time."
Lee said that in coming months
the class presidents and administra
tors might consider changing how Se
nior Night is managed, if seniors act
safely and responsibly.
"This collective responsibility will
be key in allowing us to reconsider
how we run this show each week," he
said. "Until then, we just have to take
some extra precautions. It only takes
one accident for it all to come un
done."
For this year's senior class, the word "pub"
wasn't the only thing missing last night from the
party formerly known as Senior Pub Night.
At this year's first Senior Night, as it is now called,
alcohol was banned on the Marguerites shuttling
students between Tresidder Union and Gordon
Biersch Brewing Company in Palo Alto, and throw
ing up on the bus resulted in a fine as always.
But this time, the no-drinking-or-vomiting rule
was more heavily enforced, and the fine of more
than $lOO was much higher than it had been at the
beginning of the previous year. Plus, after arriving at
the bar, seniors could expect their IDs to be checked
at the door, and those who weren't 21 years old were
turned away, even if they explained that they didn't
plan on drinking.
For the senior class, it was a reminder that as
Stanford's administration cracks down on alcohol
abuse, freshmen won't be the only ones affected by
stricter policies.
The reason behind the change is that though Se
nior Night is not held on campus, the University in
directly funds it, said Mikey Lee, a senior class
president.
He said the senior class presidents pay for Senior
Night with money from the class fund and use addi
tional University funding to rent Marguerites. Now
that the University is tightening its alcohol policy, it
is also being more stringent about requiring Senior
Night to follow University rules.
In past years, many seniors drank on Mar
guerites, invited underclassmen friends along to
their favorite bar and, often, took the party on the
bus with them. This year, seniors will be more heav
ily monitored at Senior Night, both by the adminis
tration and by parking and transportation services,
which wants to protect its brand-new fleet of Mar
guerites.
Still, the office of student activities has worked
together with the class presidents to come up with
the adjustments, including the name change and
mandatory carding.
While it doesn't make the presidents', and exec
utive cabinet's jobs easier, it brings this specific
event under University party policies, which have
not in the past been enforced to this extent, Lee said.
Seniors are especially riled up about the name
change, which they see as an unnecessary distinc
tion. But Joey Greenwell, assistant director of the
office of student activities, said it is a rule other stu
dents groups have also had to follow.
"I've asked students not to use bar night, or
happy hour, in names," he said. "Even though
they're not saying alcohol blatantly,
that's what the theme can be seen as."
Rajaie Wedge Batniji, one of last
year's senior class presidents, thinks
the name change is a good idea.
"Personally, I think the title Se
nior Night is actually more accurate,"
he said. "It won't be at a pub, every
week. Last year, we held pub nights at
the bowling alley, restaurants and
clubs in addition to the pubs.
"By placing the emphasis on the
senior, I think the title helps remind
everyone of what the night is about -
their classmates."
Batniji argues that seniors actual
ly drink less at Senior Nights than
they do at campus parties. But
Greenwell said the changes and
extra enforcement at this year's Se
nior Night are due in part to alcohol
related problems at last year's
events.
"Our class was a little out of con
trol," admitted Garrick Chak, Class
of 2003. He said the changes are un
derstandable but not ideal.
"[Carding at bars] is a California
law, so it doesn't surprise me, but it is
sort of weird because if you're a se
nior who is going to turn 21, you'll
feel left out," he said.
Indeed, seniors who haven't yet
reached legal age find the change
hard to swallow.
"There should be an option for se

niors to go as a senior class bonding
event and not drink," said senior
Dana Mauriello, 20, who doesn't
drink but was still banned from at
tending the event. "If the event is cen
tered around drinking, it's not a se
nior event."
Although some seniors do not
drink, the administrators and class
presidents say that it is not feasible or
legal to allow underage seniors to at
tend events held at bars and assume
they won't drink.
"This year, we're trying hard to re
duce chances of people getting sick or
worse and reduce liability," Lee said.
"Our decision to have stricter carding
comes as what we think is the best so
lution to allow only those over 21 to
drink."
Greenwell said the changes might
actually be good for the senior class.
"There is not going to be that big
of a difference in the event," he said.
"In some ways, it will even strengthen
the unity of the seniors because it is a
true senior event. In that regard, it
will bring that class closer together
and create a safer environment for
people to have a good time."
Lee said that in coming months
the class presidents and administra
tors might consider changing how Se
nior Night is managed, if seniors act
safely and responsibly.
"This collective responsibility will
be key in allowing us to reconsider
how we run this show each week," he
said. "Until then, we just have to take
some extra precautions. It only takes
one accident for it all to come un
done."
