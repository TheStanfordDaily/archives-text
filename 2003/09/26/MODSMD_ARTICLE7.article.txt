# Senior Night now Pub-less
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
For this year's senior class, the word "pub"
wasn't the only thing missing last night from the
party formerly known as Senior Pub Night.
At this year's first Senior Night, as it is now called,
alcohol was banned on the Marguerites shuttling
students between Tresidder Union and Gordon
Biersch Brewing Company in Palo Alto, and throw
ing up on the bus resulted in a fine as always.
But this time, the no-drinking-or-vomiting rule
was more heavily enforced, and the fine of more
than $lOO was much higher than it had been at the
beginning of the previous year. Plus, after arriving at
the bar, seniors could expect their IDs to be checked
at the door, and those who weren't 21 years old were
turned away, even if they explained that they didn't
plan on drinking.
For the senior class, it was a reminder that as
Stanford's administration cracks down on alcohol
abuse, freshmen won't be the only ones affected by
stricter policies.
The reason behind the change is that though Se
nior Night is not held on campus, the University in
directly funds it, said Mikey Lee, a senior class
president.
He said the senior class presidents pay for Senior
Night with money from the class fund and use addi
tional University funding to rent Marguerites. Now
that the University is tightening its alcohol policy, it
is also being more stringent about requiring Senior
Night to follow University rules.
In past years, many seniors drank on Mar
guerites, invited underclassmen friends along to
their favorite bar and, often, took the party on the
bus with them. This year, seniors will be more heav
ily monitored at Senior Night, both by the adminis
tration and by parking and transportation services,
which wants to protect its brand-new fleet of Mar
guerites.
Still, the office of student activities has worked
together with the class presidents to come up with
the adjustments, including the name change and
mandatory carding.
While it doesn't make the presidents', and exec
utive cabinet's jobs easier, it brings this specific
event under University party policies, which have
not in the past been enforced to this extent, Lee said.
Seniors are especially riled up about the name
change, which they see as an unnecessary distinc
tion. But Joey Greenwell, assistant director of the
office of student activities, said it is a rule other stu
dents groups have also had to follow.
"I've asked students not to use bar night, or
happy hour, in names," he said. "Even though
