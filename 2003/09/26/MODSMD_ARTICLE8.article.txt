# ISIS flat-screen project nears completion
## 
### BONITA SONG STAFF WRITER 
Innovative Student Information Ser
vices has been preparing this week for the
installation of seven 20- to 40- inch flat
screen liquid crystal display interactive
video screens in high-traffic areas across
campus.
Intended to publicize and showcase
events and activities, the ISIS screens will
join eight others at dining halls, Tresidder
Union and other locations.
Those screens were installed last May; the
new screens were activated last week, fur
thering progress towards a uniform, campus
wide information network which its initiators
claim will "revolutionize the way technology
improves campus life at Stanford."
Originally formed in 2002, ISIS is a stu
dent group.
The video screen project was developed
and launched in cooperation with Universi
ty Communications in the Public Affairs
Office.
Designed to display information from
the Events at Stanford Web site -
http://events.stanford.edu - which was
launched in May, the screens are just one of
several efforts coordinated by a more com
prehensive project dubbed "Events at
Stanford."
The alliance between ISIS and Universi
ty administrators was forged after both
groups separately concluded that the Uni
versity needed a centralized events forum.
"The most important thing was that it's
one system," said Scott Cannon, ISIS co
founder and managing editor. "Say you're a
student leader, you can post your event just
once to the Web site."
Typically, campus groups have attempted
to reach a wide audience through flyers and
e-mails. Although the University had set up

an online campus calendar through the Stan
ford Report, it relied on submissions and
was often incomplete, said Elaine Enos, di
rector of Public Events.
In contrast, the Events at Stanford pro
ject recruits calendar administrators repre
senting more than 50 departments and stu
dent organizations and trains them on how
to upload their group's information onto the
Web site.
According to an e-mail sent out to these
calendar administrators by the web editor,
Angela Navarrette, "it only takes a minute
to enter information."
With the recent activation and expansion
of the LCD screen network, calendar ad
ministrators are now being asked to add
video capabilities.
As the screens continue to infiltrate other
high-traffic areas, like the Bookstore, Meyer
Library, and the Frances C. Arrillaga Alum
ni Center, the network has become yet an
other way for groups to "get more expo
sure," Navarrette said.
At first, the managers of Events at Stan
ford had planned on using plasma screens.
The change was made, Cannon said, because
"LCDs last longer [and] it's more cutting
edge technology."
New software is also in the works.
"The next phase is personalized informa
tion," said Cannon, adding that he hopes to
implement software that stores information
about individual preferences and filters what
it displays accordingly. He also mentioned
plans for a downloadable events-informa
tion screensaver.
ISIS has no definite plans once its in
volvement in the Events at Stanford project
comes to an end, Cannon said.
"Our hope is to continue to work on this
project for at least another year, then start
tackling other problems to benefit student
life," he said.
