# Activities fair this afternoon

### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Overzealous freshmen and bored
upperclassmen rejoice: The listless
days of summer come to a swift halt
this afternoon as campus groups vie
for new members at the annual activ
ities fair.
The event, which has become the
primary recruiting tool for many
groups on-campus, will take place in
White Plaza today from noon to 4
p.m.
"The purpose of the fair is to give
the over 600 registered volunteer
student organizations an opportuni
ty to showcase and highlight their
programs and services," said Judith
Rowles, assistant director of student
activities and the staff member in
charge of the fair.
And, of course, another prime
goal is to enable the groups "to re
cruit new members," she said.
According to Rowles, typically
around one-third of the registered
student organizations host tables at
the fair. However, she said, "num
bers are up this year and we will have
more groups."
The activities fair always serves as
fertile breeding ground for the inter
ests of freshmen, who often come
away with more than they expected.
"Frosh often feel overwhelmed,"
Rowles said. "After just finishing

Orientation and their first few days
of classes, they often walk around
dazed. They sign their name up on
lots of lists at the fair and maybe end
up actually active in one or two
groups."
Some upperclassmen suffer from
the reverse problem and later
lament not taking advantage of the
activities fair their freshman year.
"I really wanted to go but I
don't know if I had classes or
what I ended up missing it," sopho
more Anthony Viola said. "I highly
recommend to all freshmen that they
go-"
This year's freshmen are excited
about the opportunity.
"I'm definitely going to sign up
for many clubs and then back out of
some later," said freshman Yi-Ren
Chen. "I might not give my e-mail
address to them. Instead, I'll e-mail
them if I'm interested."
The 200 or so student groups that
will be present at the activities fair
today have spent a lot of time and en
ergy putting together creative, infor
mative tables to impress and educate
would-be members.
"Because we're in a student group,
we really want to get the name and the
mission out there," said sophomore
Kiyomi Burchill, who will be tabling
for three groups, including the newly
created Multi-Racial Identified Com
munity at Stanford.

"It's a really great opportunity for
us as a new student group to just be
there for students," she added. "We
really do appreciate [the chance to
participate in the fair]."
Groups tomorrow will be
arranged around White Plaza, from
the lawn near Tresidder Union to
the fountain area, according to the
categories in which they are regis
tered with the Office of Student Af
fairs. For example, prospective do
gooders will be able to find all com
munity service organizations in the
same area, while the sporty need
look in only one location for athletic
groups.
Clubs at the activity fair tend to
have some kind of gimmick to lure
students to their table. Most groups
give out candy, pizza or some other
kind of food, but others offer less or
dinary hooks. For instance, in the
past, the Stanford Wushu club has
given performances of their martial
arts skills. This year, according to one
club member, the Forum for Ameri
can/Chinese Exchange at Stanford
will supply their table with a boom
box blasting Chinese pop music and a
TV playing clips of Jerry Seinfeld
making fun of Chinese people.
"Each year the gimmicks get cra
zier and crazier," Rowles said.
Clearly, the activities fair coordi
nators have something in mind for
everyone.
