# Students mobilize for Election Day
## Stanford election coalition works to inform students 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
With the California recall election
just a week away, student groups are
trying to mobilize voters for their re
spective stances regarding the guberna
torial recall and Proposition 54.
A newly formed campus group is
calling on students to vote on Oct. 7
against Proposition 54, which would
ban the collection of racial data by the
state government. Additionally, the
Stanford Republicans and Stanford
Democrats are attempting to raise
awareness regarding the merits of the
recall election and its candidates.
The Stanford Coalition to Stop 54
includes The Asian American Students
Association, the Black Student Union
and Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford, among other groups,
and plans on holding an anti-Prop. 54
rally Wednesday, keynoted by Jesse
Jackson.
Students admit that the fact that the
election will take place so close to the
beginning of the quarter makes it diffi
cult to mobilize students. But the Coali
tion says it is determined not to let that
stop it from getting information out
about the measure.
"First and foremost, our goal is to
raise awareness," said junior Hunter
Hargraves, a member of the coalition.
"The more people learn about Prop. 54,
the more likely it is they will vote no."
Meanwhile, the Stanford Republi
cans and Stanford Democrats have
staked out positions similar to their na
tional counterparts, respectively for
and against Proposition 54.
Some members of the Stanford Re
publicans are working for
Schwarzenegger's campaign, and a few
are working for State Senator Tom Mc-
Clintock. The Stanford Review has not
endorsed the recall or a candidate.
The Stanford Democrats set a goal
of raising $lO,OOO from alumni and
local Democrats to fund their efforts
against the recall and for Lieutenant
Governor Cruz Bustamante. They plan
to use e-mail and flyers, and call local
democrats to get them to vote.
"Registered Democrats outnumber
registered Republicans more than four
to one on campus," junior Dylan Mef
ford, president of the Stanford Democ
rats., said. "If every Democrat
[statewide] voted against the recall, it
would be defeated."
Both the Democrats and the Coali
tion will also hold rallies next Monday,
the day before the election.
The Democrats and those who op
pose Proposition 54 hope their efforts
will work together, though the Stanford
Democrats have not yet joined the
Coalition against the proposition.
"Linking the two issues reminds vot
ers that Republicans threaten the abili
ty of the state to realize greater equali
