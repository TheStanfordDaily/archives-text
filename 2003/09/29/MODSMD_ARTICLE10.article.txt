## You've got a Friend (ster) 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
Here's the scene: tank-top-clad
girl strolls into a low-lit room one Sat
urday night. Fondling the rim of her
red plastic tumbler, in which a chilly
beverage splashes around with
jostling ice cubes, she cranes her neck
and scans the room for familiar faces.
All at one, she is confronted by a
barrage of questions about what her
name is, where she lives. Inevitably,
she ends up giving out her e-mail ad
dress.
That girl is me. And no, I am not
checking out the Phi Psi Fratacular.
It's after midnight and I, orange juice
in hand, am finally signing up for
Friendster membership in the ambi
ent mood lighting of my local com
puter cluster. For professional pur
poses only, of course.
After much goading from Friend
ster-addicted pals, I am relenting and
joining the fray. Friendster is an on
line community that facilitates bring
ing strangers together. New members
can announce that they are looking
for anything from low-stakes, mini
mal-commitment pen pals to serious
life partners. So far, this is much like
the other online communities.
Match.com and a bevy of romance
oriented sites await business from the
much-sought-after 18-through-35 de
mographic.
But on Friendster there's a twist:
The free, "beta" version of Friendster
only allows you to connect to mem
bers registered as your friends, and
the people who are in turn friends
with them.
So if you want to meet that hottie
who is not listed as friends with your
friends, you have three choices. You
can weasel your way into that circle
by finding a remote friend-of-a-friend
linked to the Baldwin or babe. You
can pay up if you want to connect
with people you don't know, you have
to scrounge up a monthly fee. Or you
can merely pine in vain after the lus
cious pic.
In other words, navigating the
technolustful realm of Friendster is
not dissimilar to negotiating the play
ground pohtics of junior high school.
Shortly after I sign on, a friend sends
me a request to join his Friendster
network. "You have one new friend
requests [sic] to confirm!" appears on
my screen in cheerleader-peppy bold

font. "[Friend X] has tried to add you as a friend. You should approve this re
quest only if you are really friends with [Friend X]." (Emphasis is mine.) This
rather snooty tone brings me back to the days when friends would toss me
notes in algebra class behind Mrs. Kachoo's turned-away back. Scrawled in
magenta gel-pen would be the words, "Do you like John? Yes/No." Sure
enough, the notice ends, "Is [Friend X] your friend?" with two icons labeled
"yes" and "no." I click "yes," and wham, I'm in.
After signing on only a couple of friends, I am suddenly connected to
77,228 people out there desperately seeking... someone.
And what a selection, or so it seems. Each profile abounds with so-called
"testimonials": glowing attestations to the coolness of the featured member,
written by the member's friends. These de facto mash notes seem carefully
crafted for an effect of nonchalant, postmodern hauteur. Sample posting, by
an aloof-looking girl: "[Random guy] is so sexy... Even I'm obsessed with
[random guy]." Wink, wink, indeed.
"The testimonials are cool," says Candace Lewis, a junior and avid Friend
ster user. "Who doesn't want to have their friends post wonderful things
about yourself?"
Lewis says that the pressure to write positive testimonials for friends made
it difficult to untangle facts about members from glamorous fictions on
Friendster.
"I mean, of course on a testimonial, you'd only put nice things about each
other," Lewis points out. "Who's going to put on a friend's testimonial that
the person never washes their hair?"
It is a conviction (almost) universally acknowledged on campus that there
is no dating at Stanford. Perhaps this is what leads many Stanford students
to flock to Friendster when they are looking for a little something-something.
There is an added bonus. On a campus overrun with smart students with
smarting egos who strive to be the best in every arena, Friendster's ostensi
ble emphasis on friendship as well as romance allows Farm lonelyhearts to

save face. Students who would never deign to submit profiles to out-and-out
personals sites can post on Friendster claiming to be just looking for new bud
dies.
But several Stanford users say that Friendster's low-pressure, mawkish
moniker belies its true nature. They admit that while Friendster emphasizes
forging new companionships, the gussied-up photos and snap-this-up-now
testimonials suggest that members are looking for something more than an
other chat partner.
"I've really got to keep wary of the random messages I get from people
I've never met before, commenting on the pictures I put up or something in
my profile," says Lewis. "Sometimes, they can get weird. Those you just got
to laugh at and immediately delete."
Lewis says she hasn't used Friendster to hunt for dates, but nevertheless
receives responses from potential suitors.
The beta version of Friendster was introduced in March, and there are 1.5
million users currently registered at the site, said Jonathan Abrams, Friend
ster founder, in a September interview with Online Community Report.
The huge morass of available profiles was almost unanimously cited as the
major lure of the site by several Stanford Friendster users.
"Many of my friends were in it, so I joined," says junior Sonya Petkova,
who also joined the similar site Club Nexus, founded by former Stanford
graduate student Orkut Buyukkokten and former undergraduate Tyler
Ziemann.
Petkova says what drew her to Friendster were other members' opinions
on love and sex.
"Also, I could see the zodiac of people I was interested in," she says, grin
ning craftily. "Their birthdays, you know ..."
But Petkova says she doesn't log on to such sites as much as she used to.
"It's not ICQ, where you directly talk to people," she says.
Other Stanford students go even further, disdaining online contact for

real-life interaction.
When a group of guys lounging
around in Casa Zapata after din
ner are asked if they would use
the Friendster service, the ques
tion elicits a round of derisive guf
faws, compelling other students
to look up from their tables. The
guys say that despite all the
proclamations of facilitating new
friendships, the site is really a
sotto voce booty call.
Agustin Cervantes, a sopho
more, said he couldn't help but
harbor suspicions about any girl
he would meet online.
"Nah, if she ain't down to meet
me, she can't be with me," he said.
Ochuko Metitiri, another
sophomore, nodded in agree
ment.
"Eliminating the human com
ponent of a relationship at the
start is a wrong way to begin
something you hope will develop
into something substantial," said
Metitiri.
Other Stanford students who
have delved into the Friendster
domain have become wary of the
site for similar reasons.
"It's a great model, in theory -
that you can make friends with
Mends of 'your' Mends, kind of
like the six-degrees-of-separation
thing," said Graham Walker, a
medical student at Stanford, who
registered with Friendster but has
since grown disenchanted with
the site. "It's apparently just
turned into a big hookup site. Not
my bag."
The dissatisfaction with the
perceived artificiality of Friend
ster profiles was part of what in
spired Daily reporter Helen Kim
to take action. (See sidebar.) As
an experiment, she posted a
photo of a busty model on her
Friendster profile. The responses
this elicited one post read,
"You are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen!" would seem to
negate Friendster's purported
emphasis on Mendship qualities
rather than surface shininess.
Friendster's tacit emphasis on
the aesthetic inspired some Bay
Area Friendster users to post par
odic, comical and sometimes
ridiculously-sexed-up profiles
known as "fakester" profiles.
"Look around on Friendster
for an ugly face, why don't you?"

said one former Fakester who lives in the Bay Area. "Notice how everyone
is young and beautiful with bouncy bosoms and bulging pecs? Everyone is a
Fakester. At least we're honest about it."
When founder Abrams cracked down on the proliferation of Fakester
profiles in July, a group of ousted Fakesters banded together and fomented a
revolution. Friendster√üevolution is now a Yahoo group hundreds strong.
"Hundreds of Fakesters, and some real people as well, were purged from
the Friendster rolls," says the former Bay Area Fakester. "Naturally, we got
pissed, and then we got organized."
The Fakesters claim that their presence is what keeps Friendster, well,
friendly.
"Without Fakesters, [Friendster] is just another online meat market," says
Roy Batty, a Bay Area Friendster user who says he is the author of the
Fakester Manifesto, which lists the group's purpose.
"I believe people should be allowed on Friendster and other such
groupsto post artwork or collages or cartoons or whatever to express them
selves and not be limited to so-called 'real' photos," says a Friendster user
who calls herself Quotester and asked that her real name not be printed. "It's
paternalistically controlling to confine members thusly, for no meaningful
end."
For all the backlash, though, even the Friendster dissidents say they are
still frequent users of the site. Quotester, for instance, recently attended a
party thrown by someone she met on Friendster. She says she thinks it is pos
sible to form meaningful relationships on the site.
But while many Stanford students claim not to be looking for love, the site
has still served a useful purpose for one group; members of Stanford's most
recent graduating class is staying in touch through a virtual Friendster user
called StanfordOhThree.

can pay up if you want to connect
with people you don't know, you have
to scrounge up a monthly fee. Or you
can merely pine in vain after the lus
cious pic.
In other words, navigating the
technolustful realm of Friendster is
not dissimilar to negotiating the play
ground pohtics of junior high school.
Shortly after I sign on, a friend sends
me a request to join his Friendster
network. "You have one new friend
requests [sic] to confirm!" appears on
my screen in cheerleader-peppy bold

font. "[Friend X] has tried to add you as a friend. You should approve this re
quest only if you are really friends with [Friend X]." (Emphasis is mine.) This
rather snooty tone brings me back to the days when friends would toss me
notes in algebra class behind Mrs. Kachoo's turned-away back. Scrawled in
magenta gel-pen would be the words, "Do you like John? Yes/No." Sure
enough, the notice ends, "Is [Friend X] your friend?" with two icons labeled
"yes" and "no." I click "yes," and wham, I'm in.
After signing on only a couple of friends, I am suddenly connected to
77,228 people out there desperately seeking... someone.
And what a selection, or so it seems. Each profile abounds with so-called
"testimonials": glowing attestations to the coolness of the featured member,
written by the member's friends. These de facto mash notes seem carefully
crafted for an effect of nonchalant, postmodern hauteur. Sample posting, by
an aloof-looking girl: "[Random guy] is so sexy... Even I'm obsessed with
[random guy]." Wink, wink, indeed.
"The testimonials are cool," says Candace Lewis, a junior and avid Friend
ster user. "Who doesn't want to have their friends post wonderful things
about yourself?"
Lewis says that the pressure to write positive testimonials for friends made
it difficult to untangle facts about members from glamorous fictions on
Friendster.
"I mean, of course on a testimonial, you'd only put nice things about each
other," Lewis points out. "Who's going to put on a friend's testimonial that
the person never washes their hair?"
It is a conviction (almost) universally acknowledged on campus that there
is no dating at Stanford. Perhaps this is what leads many Stanford students
to flock to Friendster when they are looking for a little something-something.
There is an added bonus. On a campus overrun with smart students with
smarting egos who strive to be the best in every arena, Friendster's ostensi
ble emphasis on friendship as well as romance allows Farm lonelyhearts to

save face. Students who would never deign to submit profiles to out-and-out
personals sites can post on Friendster claiming to be just looking for new bud
dies.
But several Stanford users say that Friendster's low-pressure, mawkish
moniker belies its true nature. They admit that while Friendster emphasizes
forging new companionships, the gussied-up photos and snap-this-up-now
testimonials suggest that members are looking for something more than an
other chat partner.
"I've really got to keep wary of the random messages I get from people
I've never met before, commenting on the pictures I put up or something in
my profile," says Lewis. "Sometimes, they can get weird. Those you just got
to laugh at and immediately delete."
Lewis says she hasn't used Friendster to hunt for dates, but nevertheless
receives responses from potential suitors.
The beta version of Friendster was introduced in March, and there are 1.5
million users currently registered at the site, said Jonathan Abrams, Friend
ster founder, in a September interview with Online Community Report.
The huge morass of available profiles was almost unanimously cited as the
major lure of the site by several Stanford Friendster users.
"Many of my friends were in it, so I joined," says junior Sonya Petkova,
who also joined the similar site Club Nexus, founded by former Stanford
graduate student Orkut Buyukkokten and former undergraduate Tyler
Ziemann.
Petkova says what drew her to Friendster were other members' opinions
on love and sex.
"Also, I could see the zodiac of people I was interested in," she says, grin
ning craftily. "Their birthdays, you know ..."
But Petkova says she doesn't log on to such sites as much as she used to.
"It's not ICQ, where you directly talk to people," she says.
Other Stanford students go even further, disdaining online contact for

real-life interaction.
When a group of guys lounging
around in Casa Zapata after din
ner are asked if they would use
the Friendster service, the ques
tion elicits a round of derisive guf
faws, compelling other students
to look up from their tables. The
guys say that despite all the
proclamations of facilitating new
friendships, the site is really a
sotto voce booty call.
Agustin Cervantes, a sopho
more, said he couldn't help but
harbor suspicions about any girl
he would meet online.
"Nah, if she ain't down to meet
me, she can't be with me," he said.
Ochuko Metitiri, another
sophomore, nodded in agree
ment.
"Eliminating the human com
ponent of a relationship at the
start is a wrong way to begin
something you hope will develop
into something substantial," said
Metitiri.
Other Stanford students who
have delved into the Friendster
domain have become wary of the
site for similar reasons.
"It's a great model, in theory -
that you can make friends with
Mends of 'your' Mends, kind of
like the six-degrees-of-separation
thing," said Graham Walker, a
medical student at Stanford, who
registered with Friendster but has
since grown disenchanted with
the site. "It's apparently just
turned into a big hookup site. Not
my bag."
The dissatisfaction with the
perceived artificiality of Friend
ster profiles was part of what in
spired Daily reporter Helen Kim
to take action. (See sidebar.) As
an experiment, she posted a
photo of a busty model on her
Friendster profile. The responses
this elicited one post read,
"You are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen!" would seem to
negate Friendster's purported
emphasis on Mendship qualities
rather than surface shininess.
Friendster's tacit emphasis on
the aesthetic inspired some Bay
Area Friendster users to post par
odic, comical and sometimes
ridiculously-sexed-up profiles
known as "fakester" profiles.
"Look around on Friendster
for an ugly face, why don't you?"

said one former Fakester who lives in the Bay Area. "Notice how everyone
is young and beautiful with bouncy bosoms and bulging pecs? Everyone is a
Fakester. At least we're honest about it."
When founder Abrams cracked down on the proliferation of Fakester
profiles in July, a group of ousted Fakesters banded together and fomented a
revolution. Friendster√üevolution is now a Yahoo group hundreds strong.
"Hundreds of Fakesters, and some real people as well, were purged from
the Friendster rolls," says the former Bay Area Fakester. "Naturally, we got
pissed, and then we got organized."
The Fakesters claim that their presence is what keeps Friendster, well,
friendly.
"Without Fakesters, [Friendster] is just another online meat market," says
Roy Batty, a Bay Area Friendster user who says he is the author of the
Fakester Manifesto, which lists the group's purpose.
"I believe people should be allowed on Friendster and other such
groupsto post artwork or collages or cartoons or whatever to express them
selves and not be limited to so-called 'real' photos," says a Friendster user
who calls herself Quotester and asked that her real name not be printed. "It's
paternalistically controlling to confine members thusly, for no meaningful
end."
For all the backlash, though, even the Friendster dissidents say they are
still frequent users of the site. Quotester, for instance, recently attended a
party thrown by someone she met on Friendster. She says she thinks it is pos
sible to form meaningful relationships on the site.
But while many Stanford students claim not to be looking for love, the site
has still served a useful purpose for one group; members of Stanford's most
recent graduating class is staying in touch through a virtual Friendster user
called StanfordOhThree.

Here's the scene: tank-top-clad
girl strolls into a low-lit room one Sat
urday night. Fondling the rim of her
red plastic tumbler, in which a chilly
beverage splashes around with
jostling ice cubes, she cranes her neck
and scans the room for familiar faces.
All at one, she is confronted by a
barrage of questions about what her
name is, where she lives. Inevitably,
she ends up giving out her e-mail ad
dress.
That girl is me. And no, I am not
checking out the Phi Psi Fratacular.
It's after midnight and I, orange juice
in hand, am finally signing up for
Friendster membership in the ambi
ent mood lighting of my local com
puter cluster. For professional pur
poses only, of course.
After much goading from Friend
ster-addicted pals, I am relenting and
joining the fray. Friendster is an on
line community that facilitates bring
ing strangers together. New members
can announce that they are looking
for anything from low-stakes, mini
mal-commitment pen pals to serious
life partners. So far, this is much like
the other online communities.
Match.com and a bevy of romance
oriented sites await business from the
much-sought-after 18-through-35 de
mographic.
But on Friendster there's a twist:
The free, "beta" version of Friendster
only allows you to connect to mem
bers registered as your friends, and
the people who are in turn friends
with them.
So if you want to meet that hottie
who is not listed as friends with your
friends, you have three choices. You
can weasel your way into that circle
by finding a remote friend-of-a-friend
linked to the Baldwin or babe. You
can pay up if you want to connect
with people you don't know, you have
to scrounge up a monthly fee. Or you
can merely pine in vain after the lus
cious pic.

about yourself?"
Lewis says that the pressure to write positive testimonials for friends made
it difficult to untangle facts about members from glamorous fictions on
Friendster.
"I mean, of course on a testimonial, you'd only put nice things about each
other," Lewis points out. "Who's going to put on a friend's testimonial that
the person never washes their hair?"
It is a conviction (almost) universally acknowledged on campus that there
is no dating at Stanford. Perhaps this is what leads many Stanford students
to flock to Friendster when they are looking for a little something-something.
There is an added bonus. On a campus overrun with smart students with
smarting egos who strive to be the best in every arena, Friendster's ostensi
ble emphasis on friendship as well as romance allows Farm lonelyhearts to

save face. Students who would never deign to submit profiles to out-and-out
personals sites can post on Friendster claiming to be just looking for new bud
dies.
But several Stanford users say that Friendster's low-pressure, mawkish
moniker belies its true nature. They admit that while Friendster emphasizes
forging new companionships, the gussied-up photos and snap-this-up-now
testimonials suggest that members are looking for something more than an
other chat partner.
"I've really got to keep wary of the random messages I get from people
I've never met before, commenting on the pictures I put up or something in
my profile," says Lewis. "Sometimes, they can get weird. Those you just got
to laugh at and immediately delete."
Lewis says she hasn't used Friendster to hunt for dates, but nevertheless
receives responses from potential suitors.
The beta version of Friendster was introduced in March, and there are 1.5
million users currently registered at the site, said Jonathan Abrams, Friend
ster founder, in a September interview with Online Community Report.
The huge morass of available profiles was almost unanimously cited as the
major lure of the site by several Stanford Friendster users.
"Many of my friends were in it, so I joined," says junior Sonya Petkova,
who also joined the similar site Club Nexus, founded by former Stanford
graduate student Orkut Buyukkokten and former undergraduate Tyler
Ziemann.
Petkova says what drew her to Friendster were other members' opinions
on love and sex.
"Also, I could see the zodiac of people I was interested in," she says, grin
ning craftily. "Their birthdays, you know ..."
But Petkova says she doesn't log on to such sites as much as she used to.
"It's not ICQ, where you directly talk to people," she says.
Other Stanford students go even further, disdaining online contact for

real-life interaction.
When a group of guys lounging
around in Casa Zapata after din
ner are asked if they would use
the Friendster service, the ques
tion elicits a round of derisive guf
faws, compelling other students
to look up from their tables. The
guys say that despite all the
proclamations of facilitating new
friendships, the site is really a
sotto voce booty call.
Agustin Cervantes, a sopho
more, said he couldn't help but
harbor suspicions about any girl
he would meet online.
"Nah, if she ain't down to meet
me, she can't be with me," he said.
Ochuko Metitiri, another
sophomore, nodded in agree
ment.
"Eliminating the human com
ponent of a relationship at the
start is a wrong way to begin
something you hope will develop
into something substantial," said
Metitiri.
Other Stanford students who
have delved into the Friendster
domain have become wary of the
site for similar reasons.
"It's a great model, in theory -
that you can make friends with
Mends of 'your' Mends, kind of
like the six-degrees-of-separation
thing," said Graham Walker, a
medical student at Stanford, who
registered with Friendster but has
since grown disenchanted with
the site. "It's apparently just
turned into a big hookup site. Not
my bag."
The dissatisfaction with the
perceived artificiality of Friend
ster profiles was part of what in
spired Daily reporter Helen Kim
to take action. (See sidebar.) As
an experiment, she posted a
photo of a busty model on her
Friendster profile. The responses
this elicited one post read,
"You are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen!" would seem to
negate Friendster's purported
emphasis on Mendship qualities
rather than surface shininess.
Friendster's tacit emphasis on
the aesthetic inspired some Bay
Area Friendster users to post par
odic, comical and sometimes
ridiculously-sexed-up profiles
known as "fakester" profiles.
"Look around on Friendster
for an ugly face, why don't you?"

said one former Fakester who lives in the Bay Area. "Notice how everyone
is young and beautiful with bouncy bosoms and bulging pecs? Everyone is a
Fakester. At least we're honest about it."
When founder Abrams cracked down on the proliferation of Fakester
profiles in July, a group of ousted Fakesters banded together and fomented a
revolution. Friendster√üevolution is now a Yahoo group hundreds strong.
"Hundreds of Fakesters, and some real people as well, were purged from
the Friendster rolls," says the former Bay Area Fakester. "Naturally, we got
pissed, and then we got organized."
The Fakesters claim that their presence is what keeps Friendster, well,
friendly.
"Without Fakesters, [Friendster] is just another online meat market," says
Roy Batty, a Bay Area Friendster user who says he is the author of the
Fakester Manifesto, which lists the group's purpose.
"I believe people should be allowed on Friendster and other such
groupsto post artwork or collages or cartoons or whatever to express them
selves and not be limited to so-called 'real' photos," says a Friendster user
who calls herself Quotester and asked that her real name not be printed. "It's
paternalistically controlling to confine members thusly, for no meaningful
end."
For all the backlash, though, even the Friendster dissidents say they are
still frequent users of the site. Quotester, for instance, recently attended a
party thrown by someone she met on Friendster. She says she thinks it is pos
sible to form meaningful relationships on the site.
But while many Stanford students claim not to be looking for love, the site
has still served a useful purpose for one group; members of Stanford's most
recent graduating class is staying in touch through a virtual Friendster user
called StanfordOhThree.
