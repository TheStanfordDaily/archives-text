# Fool's experiment: Is it just about friendship?
## 
### 
Einstein coined the phrase "fool's
experiment" to refer to an experi
ment that tests the obvious. This
summer, when I first jumped onto
the Friendster bandwagon, I decided to cre
ate my own "fool's experiment" to see if
other people who browsed Friendster would
make superficial judgments based on flashy
appearances.
The first step: I uploaded a photograph of
Mina Shin, a busty Korean singer who be
came famous as "Ms. World Cup," to pass
off as my own photograph.
After the idea first sparked in my mind, I
infused my public profile with the expected
bitchy attitude of girls who are supremely
hot. Some things I included in my profile re
flect my own personality, but I tried to add as

much va-va-voom as I could.
This is the public profile I had on my
Friendster:
Occupation: Stanford student (I ain't no
dumb ho.)
Interests: [cut out the boring stuff that re
flects the real me] Tripping and dropping my
watermelons.
About Me: There's a method to my mel
onness. I have the biggest boobs of any Ko
rean girl I know. Just look at the picture.
And yes, they're real.
Who I Want to Meet: Not you. Move b—
-, get outta my way. Can't touch this.
Reading people's perverted reactions
proved to be just as amusing as was creating
"my" profile.
Dozens of strangers and a handful of

Stanford students sent me
messages asking to be my
friend and almost always
commenting on "my"
huge knockers. Most of
the Stanford students who
commented on the photo
graph were sketchy gradu
ate students who won
dered why they had not
run into me on campus. A
number of self-described

lesbians and female bisexuals also wrote to
me, saying that they were stunned by "my"
beauty and expressing their desire to be
come more intimate with me.
One heterosexual female asked if I could
divulge my secret for huge mammaries.

Here's a look at her message to me and my
corresponding response, followed by her
reply:
Heterosexual, flat-chested girl: "Hey
Helen, I just wondered if you had any tips on
how to have bigger boobs. Mine are tiny, and
I wish they weren't! But I don't want to have
surgery or any of that s—. You are so pret
ty!"
Me: "If you don't want surgery and are
not naturally endowed with huge knockers
like me, then I guess there's nothing you can
do. Sorry."
HFCG: "I figured as much. I thought you
had some secret 'cause your profile says
'there is a method to my melonness.' Guess
it's either luck or surgery, or just not caring
about boobs too much."

Another breast-obsessed person com
mented on my "massive milk bladders." To
him, I wrote "Mooo, get out of my way."
I know I set out to prove the fairly obvi
ous that many men and women
view women as mere sexual objects, and,
in particular, that cup size connotes sexual
appeal. Although I pretty much knew the
outcome of my experiment before I even
started writing "my" profile, I can't help
but admit that I am a bit saddened that
there are people audacious enough to pro
claim their sexism. Friendster is yet anoth
er Internet medium through which people
who objectify women can express their be
liefs more easily. All it takes is one
provocative picture and a sizzling profile
to match. Sadness.
