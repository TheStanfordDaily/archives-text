## Killing fun softly at Stanford 
### 
Xanadu, 680 Lomita and Theta Delta
Chi became the first campus organi
zations to be placed on Social Pro
bation this year when Jane Camaril
lo, director of Residential Education, an
nounced the disciplinary action on Thursday.
While we recognize that each organization
had violated the University's Alcohol Policy
during New Student Orientation, we believe
that these sanctions represent just the latest
step in a broader crack-down on alcohol at
Stanford. Last spring, this page voiced its dis
content with Stanford's increasingly stringent
regulation of alcohol. That view has not
changed.
We agree that the sanctions against 680
Lomita are well-deserved. University officials
could not afford to overlook the small room
party that expanded to fill much of the house
and eventually had more than 100 students in

attendance. This party was
ill-planned, and expanded
to the point at which fresh
men could easily slip in un
detected.
The other two parties,
however, are different
cases. Although technically
in violation of the Universi
ty's Alcohol Policy, both
events were small, low-key
gatherings limited to up
perclassmen who knew

each other. These events could not harm
freshmen, and did not threaten the mission of
Orientation.
Since Gene Awakuni became vice provost
of student affairs a year and a half ago, the
University has significantly upped its enforce
ment of already existing policies and has con
sistently implemented new anti-alcohol mea
sures. Unfortunately, all too often the Univer
sity's efforts to curb alcohol consumption
seem more draconian than demanded by
pressing campus problems.
While we recognize that University offi
cials are concerned about the number of stu
dents hospitalized because of excessive drink
ing and about the University's liability in the
case that a student is severely injured or dies,
threats and punishment are not the most ef
fective tools for combating excessive drink
ing. Students will drink whether or not there is
a policy prohibiting it it's just a question of
where students will drink and what they will

consume.
In many ways, cracking down on drinking
promotes less safe behavior. Students who
have no public space to drink will go behind
closed doors. While someone at a party may
consume three glasses of beer that are half
filled with froth, the temptation to take shot
after shot with only enough time to drain
the juice out of a lime in between each shot
runs much higher over the course of the night
when behind closed doors. Resident assistants
and sober monitors are much less likely to be
nearby to intervene when the situation gets
out of hand at these parties, and students can
injure themselves because no one is watching
out for their safety.
The implementation of recent University
policies aimed at regulating alcohol consump
tion has been misguided and unnecessarily
hasty. Student concerns which are both

abundant and valid
often have not been prop
erly solicited until after pol
icy had already been imple
mented. University offi
cials continue to maintain
that timing and legal issues
have prevented them from
consulting students before
they change policy. We
don't buy that excuse.
Students have the
right to demand a frank

and direct accounting of the University's
views on alcohol consumption and its plans
for the future of the alcohol policy. In the ab
sence of a permanent dean of students, under
graduates are left to wonder as to the origin of
the latest policy restricting alcohol use.
There is no single person who seems to be
accountable for the changes in policy, and no
proper authority save an amorphous
group of officials from within the Office of
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs to ap
peal to for explanations.
While the crafters of the University's poli
cies restricting alcohol-use have undoubtedly
had good intentions, the implementation of
these policies has left students feeling alienat
ed. If University officials genuinely hope to be
able to combat the problems that arise when
students drink too much, officials should
focus their energy on educating and commu
nicating with students not on drafting
more regulations.

All too often the
University's efforts
to curb alcohol
consumption seem
more draconian than
demanded by pressing
campus problems.
