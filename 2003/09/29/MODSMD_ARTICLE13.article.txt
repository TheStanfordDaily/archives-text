# Pub night changes misguided
## 
### 
Since prohibiting alcohol-service in the
public areas of freshmen dormitories,
Stanford has begun to enforce its exist
ing alcohol regulations with renewed
vigor. Seniors, who in past years enjoyed the
much-revered Senior Pub Night on Thursday
evenings, now must attend the less alcohol
friendly "Senior Night."
While we understand and sympathize with
University officials' concern for student safety,
we hope they will fully consider the repercus
sions of their actions and the message that they
are sending to students.
This year, the event's name was changed to
Senior Night. Under pressure from University
officials, the senior class presidents changed
the name in a move seeking to lessen the role
of alcohol during the evening and instead em
phasize the opportunity that the night offers
seniors to meet and bond with fellow class
mates. But by enforcing mandatory carding on
Senior Night, which ensures that only those
over 21 can attend, the University undermined
its own objectives.
In the past, students under the age of 21
have usually been able to participate in Senior
Pub Night. Even if they couldn't order a lager
or a cosmo, these students were able to share
some quality time with classmates. Under the

revised University policy, seniors who are not
yet 21 will not be admitted to Senior Night. If
the University is truly concerned about pro
viding a bonding event for seniors, it is peculiar
that this opportunity provided is not inclusive.
Trying to promote Senior Night as an event
that is not necessarily centered on alcohol by
renaming it spanks of disingenuity; regardless
of the name, the focus of the event revolves
around bar-hopping. And by not allowing
non-drinking underaged students to attend,
the focus on alcohol could likely be greater
than ever.
Rather, the name change appears to be in
dicative of Stanford's broader crackdown on al
cohol. By enacting more regulations in the place
of trust and openness, the University is sending
the message that the solution to any alcohol
problem is the elimination of alcohol itself.
For better or worse, alcohol is a critical
component of college student culture not
just at Stanford, but across the country. Stan
ford students generally conduct themselves
more responsibly than the average undergrad
uate. The sobering truth of the matter is that
students won't stop drinking just because they
are told they shouldn't. And Senior Night isn't
going to become a night of EANABS simply
because of a name change.
