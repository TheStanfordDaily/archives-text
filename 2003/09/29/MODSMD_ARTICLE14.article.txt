Blair Op-Ed misses point

To praise a European politician as
"America's best friend" in the era of
the Bush presidency is scarcely likely
to enhance his standing at home, as
the Hoover fellow wrote in his Op-
Ed contribution lamenting Tony
Blair's fall from grace ("Blair deals
with war's aftermath," Sept. 26).

But the real reason for Blair's
disastrous decline in popular sup
port is that the overwhelming ma
jority of the British public, including
Blair's Labour Party, regard Bush as
a right-wing extremist and resent
their own Prime Minister serving as
his poodle, in particular by dragging
Britain into an unpopular "pre
emptive" war and lying about the

necessity for doing so.
Obviously, this reality is nowhere
to be found in the Hoover contribu
tion because it might suggest that the
American public could become sim
ilarly disgusted and disillusioned
with their deceptive leaders.
