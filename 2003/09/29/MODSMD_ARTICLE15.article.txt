# JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK
## Taking off for Oxford And the train that doesn't really stop at Berkeley Opinions 
### 
"Next stop: Berkeley. Anyone
getting off at Berkeley must exit the
front car. That's the only one we will
open because the platform is crum
bling apart."
Those words of welcome from
the Amtrak conductor got me all ex
cited to start my summer session at
Cal, kicking off an eight-week rebel
lion from Stanford via fraternization
with the enemy.
It's hard for me to explain exact
ly why I went to Berkeley in the first
place. Curiosity? Location? The
$6OO tuition? All these things fac
tored into it, but ultimately I had
hoped that the change would be rad
ical enough to serve as a sort of aca
demic panacea, rejuvenating me out
of my Stanford rut.
I convinced myself that going to
Cal would clear up the doldrums
that seem to inevitably come with
starting junior year like a breath of
fresh air. But, of course, I was woe
fully mistaken. For one thing, there
isn't enough fresh air to go around at
Berkeley because everything smells
like pee and body odor. Everything.
All the time.
In truth, my plan was flawed from
the start: Going to the most oppo
site-of-Stanford place that I could
think of to magically solve all my
problems with Stanford itself was
too childishly simple to ever suc
ceed. It's a plan fit for a 7-year-old:

Run away from
home, and make
your parents
sorry! Tempting,
until you realize
that running away
with a knapsack
crammed with
useless shit (a
plastic tiara, Lego
people, "The
Land Before

Time" on VHS) doesn't fix any
thing. Most likely, no one even no
tices you're gone.
Foolishly, I thought that living in
Berkeley would be the best way to
get free of the Stanford bubble; that
novelties like homeless people and
litter would serve as a giant "Wel
come to the Real World, Baby" sign
for my sheltered eyes. But Berkeley
isn't exactly the real world either.
It's a velvet-flocked, blacklight-re
ceptive poster for the real world
a nostalgic late-60s to early-70s
throwback.
Nostalgia has an annoying ten
dency to make everything it touches
turn two-dimensional, and Berkeley
is no exception with its run-down
People's Park and tie-dyed woven
hemp.
Since the whole experience did
little to cure me of my personal
malaise, I couldn't summon the en
ergy to return to the Farm for au
tumn quarter. So instead, I'm going
to go to Oxford next week. Stan
ford's Overseas Studies Program
makes it easy for students to go
abroad, which works out great since
getting off campus otherwise is prac

tically impossible. Why not try
spending a quarter in the United
Kingdom? Or in any old kingdom
for that matter. Maybe my problem
isn't Stanford, maybe it's President
Bush.
This doesn't sound like the most
noble reason to go overseas it's
probably not the best thing to write
on your OSP application. But while
my exact motives for studying
abroad are fuzzy, I'm confident that
I need to ditch my daily routine
somehow. The thought of staying in
one place doing the same thing for
four years straight sends chills down
my spine.
Sure, I could stick around and try
to challenge myself from within in
stead of relying so heavily on my en
vironment for fulfillment, but that
would be really hard: It's easier to
just pack up and leave.
Granted, going to Oxford isn't
likely to spark any extreme life
changes since it's technically an ex
tension of Leland's sprawl, albeit as
signed an international phone code.
But it's in an entirely different conti
nent, with a different culture, gov
ernment and legal drinking age, and,
more than anything, what I need is
difference itself. I don't expect to en
counter Cavafy's barbarians at the
gate in England, only those guards
who wear furry hats and I'm hop
ing for lots and lots of fresh air too.
