# OP-ED
## Moral education would end cheating 
### BOB MOSER 
Pressure mounting, deadlines
looming, expectations breathing
down your neck these are some of
the reasons that many of today's
young scholars invoke to explain why
they cheated on their assignments.
Growing up in a capitalist economy
in the United States, students may
not realize that we are driven by the
alluring power of money.
In a 1996 Newsweek article enti
tled "Making the Grade," professor
Kurt Wiesenfeld artfully summa
rized the dwindling significance of
today's college degree: "Though in
trinsically worthless, grades, if prop
erly manipulated, can be traded for
what has value: a degree, which
means a job, which means money."
Exemplifying the capitalist mindset,
Wiesenfeld suggests that a college
degree is only a ticket to be punched
for admittance to the "wonderful
ride of profit."
A hunger for personal enlighten
ment, and a joy in attaining new per
spectives on the world around us
seem to be something we students
have lost in today's million-dollar-a
minute society.
It is also human nature to search
for the easiest means to an end.
Technological advances such as the
Internet have helped to connect the
world and make communication and
the sharing of information much eas
ier. With access to documents and
files of every sort on-line, a student
can be easily tempted to abuse tech
nology by plagiarizing another's
work. This seemingly short route to

success can be very tempting to a col
lege student who may at times be
overwhelmed by multiple writing as
signments, accompanied by exams.
The pressure that pushes stu
dents to use the latest quick-fix
scheme on the Internet will ultimate
ly come back to haunt employers
down the road. A diploma that is ac
quired dishonestly breeds a lifelong
cycle of misrepresentation. It dimin
ishes the value of an honestly earned
degree. It deceives future employers

who measure a prospective employ
ee's worth by the knowledge and
abilities that his or her grades and
degree imply. It further deceives an
unsuspecting public that relies on
the standards that are represented
by a collegiate diploma. Deteriora
tion of the economic structure will
be the ultimate downfall of our soci
ety if a college degree is no longer
trusted and respected by employers
While many may feel that the
honesty and integrity of our nation's
higher education system is falling
rapidly, there are solutions available
that, if applied now, will over time
help to reroute the mindset of future
generations. The initiative for
change should be student-driven

rather than imposed by authority
figures such as teachers, because
young people feel more at ease dis
cussing problems with their peers.
For example, an experiment on
peer influence in Des Moines, lowa,
is being used to promote better
moral behavior among elementary
school kids. College students from
Drake University were trained 60
hours over the summer, and used
group exercises and discussions
among students to reverse the cul
ture of cheating at the K-5 level.
This is a great example of how stu
dents right here at Stanford could
use their time to participate in an
outside activity that will help to both
build their resume and give back to
the community.
Cheating in college and high
school will be difficult to eradicate
without some patience. Social pres
sure to have a successful career and
the technological temptation to find
an easy route to success are heavy
weights that cannot be lifted easily
off the collective shoulders of
America's scholarly body. But when
equipped early on, moral education
programs that are implemented into
America's educational system will
replace the cheating mindset with
one of noble principle. We students
must take the initiative now, not
only with our own scholarly prac
tices but with tomorrow's cheaters
as well. Your children will thank you
for it.
