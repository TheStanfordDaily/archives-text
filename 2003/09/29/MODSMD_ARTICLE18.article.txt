## A 						new genre of hangover 
### 
We've all had the feeling
out late at a party, after a
few too many adult bev
erages (what, like you're
going to really leave the Beirut table
when you're on a roll like that?)...
and you wake up the next morning with
a pounding headache, dry throat and
the general feeling that you wish you
were dead.
Ah, the hangover. Truly an awful
beast.
This weekend, however, hang
overs were not confined solely to
freshman trying to remember how
they managed to walk back from
Kappa Sig on Friday night.
While there must have been plenty
of those as well, this weekend gave us
prime examples of the red-headed
stepchild of the hangover family the
sports hangover.
Exhibit A: The Oregon Ducks. Just a
week after stunning Michigan, the Ducks

looked embarrassingly
awful at home against
Washington State, giv
ing up 55 points to the
Cougars. Granted,
Oregon can place
some of the blame on
the infamous Sports Il
lustrated "cover jinx"
but we'll get to that
later.

Exhibit B: The Denver Broncos.
After trouncing the Raiders in front of
a national audience on Monday night,
the Broncos should have been able to
cruise through yesterday's game
against the Lions, taking it as mere
preparation for next weekend's battle
in Kansas City. Instead the game
turned into a 20-16 nail-biter that was
never even close to a sure thing.
Exhibit C: The lowa Hawkeyes.
Much like the Ducks, the Hawkeyes
were coming off a big win (21-2) against
Arizona State the week before. But
they seemed like a completely different
team as they fell to Michigan State 20-
10 on Saturday afternoon.
Now the Ducks, at least, can seek
some refuge in the fact that their "hang
over" had multiple causes. First of all,
those hideous yellow jerseys would give
anyone a headache, even someone who
was stone-cold sober. Second, the win
over Michigan would have inflated any
team's ego. And finally, if you read
magazines ... there was the omnipo
tent Sports Illustrated cover this week.
The issue proclaimed "Dazzling
Ducks: Rich, Cool, and 4-0 (Quack
Quack)." Whoops. Not anymore.
Any sports fan knows that the Sports
Illustrated cover is the kiss of death.
(Unless you're Michael Jordan, who
seemed to not really care at all.) In the
spring of 2001, the magazine showed a
shirtless Nomar Garciaparra as an ad
vertisement for the article inside ex
tolling his workout regimen.
A few days later it was announced
that Garciaparra had split a tendon in
his wrist and was out indefinitely.
In 1993, Barry Bonds graced the
cover under the headline, "I'm Barry
Bonds... and You're Not." In the next
two weeks, his league-leading batting
average fell by over 40 points.
Coincidence? I think not.
Hell, the magazine dedicated an en
tire article to investigate whether "the
jinx" is real last January, compiling a
list of all the covers from the 50s up to
the present where "the jinx" seemed to
work. It's chilling.
My personal favorite (if you can call
it that) was the cover a few years ago
with Pedro Martinez, in a Red Sox jer
sey, with the title "This Is the Year."
Pedro threw out his shoulder in April
and was never fully healthy all season.
The Red Sox missed the playoffs. I
wanted to fire bomb the Sports Illustrat
ed headquarters, wherever they are.
Jinxes are something you have to be
careful about especially when you
root for a team as cursed as the Red
Sox. Even as they were wrapping up the
Wild Card last week, I couldn't bring
myself to buy tickets for the first round
of the playoffs in Oakland, Calif.
I was petrified that in doing so, I
would be tempting fate, flaunting my
sports hubris at the Gods. And I would
pay with eternal heartache and misery.
So I had a friend buy the tickets, be
cause I couldn't stand the thought of not
going to the games either, of course. (Yeah,
it isn't quite logical, but stick with me.)
So I just have this simple request,
Sports Illustrated. Keep my beloved Red
Sox off your damn cover for the next
month. Don't bring your voodoo around
my team. Let them do their thing.
And let their only hangovers
come from the sweet taste of victory
champagne.

Wednesday night's game in Oakland will
be the best baseball game in the history of
the universe. Or something like that. E
