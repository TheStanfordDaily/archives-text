# Huskies hold Stanford down
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. Luke Powell was adamant
in his beliefs and maybe that's a signal of a
new attitude for Stanford football.
After Stanford lost its Pacific 10 Conference
opener to Washington 28-17 a game where
the Cardinal went toe-to-toe with the No. 18
Huskies until the waning moments Powell
seemed to typify the sentiments of a dejected
but-confident locker room.
"We have the talent to compete with top-20
teams and we have the talent to contend for the
Pac-10 championship," Powell said. "We stuck
our nose in there and got physical."
True, the Cardinal (2-1, 0-1 Pac-10) was
plagued by mental mistakes and poor execution
on both sides of the ball in the loss.
But there seems to be a prevailing sentiment
that this young Stanford squad is taking lessons
away from its losses instead of becoming deject-

Ed and quitting.
"I think we can correct some of the bad plays
we made," Powell said. "If you make the same
mistakes, then that's when you start feeling like
there are problems.
"How you bounce back from mistakes is what
makes you better in the long run."
Stanford went ahead 17-14 on a 28-yard
Michael Sgroi field goal with 8:02 remaining in
the third quarter after being stopped a grand
total of six times inside Washington's 10 yard
line.
After that field goal, however, Stanford
gained only 61 yards of total offense. Meanwhile,
Washington took the lead for good on a six-yard
touchdown reception by Reggie Williams.
The last six Stanford drives paint a telling pic
ture:
Three and out.
Five and out.

Junior running back Kenneth Tolon pushes past an opponent at the Cardinal's conference-opener against the Washington Huskies. Tolon, who had a career game last week against Brigham
Young, was unable to repeat on the Huskies' turf, running the ball for an average of only three yards per carry in the 28-17 Stanford loss.
Three and out.

Interception.
Those last two mistakes came
courtesy of Trent Edwards the
first of which turned out to be the
game-sealing pick that Washing
ton's Derrick Johnson returned 36
yards for a touchdown late in the
fourth quarter.
Edwards was an unspectacular
16-of-32 for 159 yards and two
touchdowns and two intercep
tions but showed a little moxie at
times in scrambling, making reads
and progressions.
"Trent was pretty up-and
down," said Stanford head coach
Buddy Teevens. "It's a new experi
ence for him.
"He saw [Washington] move
faster and react a little more rapidly
than he was used to. [But] he contin
ues to show poise given what he's
seen for the first time as a young
guy."
Edwards threw both of his touch
downs to tight end Alex Smith, the
first (a 12-yarder) on a crossing pat
tern and the second an 18-yard com
pletion on a streak downfield.
According to Teevens, Edwards
checked down to the secondary re
ceiver Smith on both plays, showing
a little more patience than he had
against Brigham Young a game ago.
And with all the pre-season hype
over Stanford's esteemed tight end
trio of Smith, Brett Pierce and Matt
Traverso, the two touchdowns were
the first to a tight end for the Cardi
nal this year.
"We've been trying to do that
since the beginning of the season,"
Smith said. "Based on the defenses
we've faced, we haven't been able to
get too involved. This was the first
game we thought we'd be able to be
effective."
Powell, on the other hand, wasn't
as effective as he would have liked.
The Pac-10's leading receiver com
ing into the game was limited to only
two catches for 29 yards.
"They were doubling up and
rolling over the corner so sometimes
you have to look to other guys,"
Teevens said. "But getting the ball
to him certainly helps our game."
Stanford also thought that get
ting the ball to junior running back
Kenneth Tolon who against
BYU rushed for a career-high 141
yards would help its game as well.
But Tolon only managed to aver
age three yards per carry on 29 tries
and had trouble bouncing to the out
side when the Huskies' stingy defen
sive line led by Terry Johnson
clogged up the middle.
"They were pretty well-prepared
for the things we were doing," Smith
said.
A lot of second guessing after a
loss is natural, but many might be
wondering why Stanford has all of a
sudden turned into a conservative of
fense and a pressure defensive team.
The coach has a simple answer.
"We are going to be involved in a
lot of close ballgames," Teevens
said.
If Teevens is right, then maybe -
just maybe Powell's "new" opti
mistic attitude is justified, as well.
Maybe Stanford can take a few
more lessons away from this latest
loss for the next close one.
However, the road doesn't get
any easier for the unranked Cardi
nal. After a bye week, Stanford
will face No. 10 USC on Saturday,
Oct. 11th in Los Angeles. The Tro
jans should see their ranking drop
in the next couple of days because
they were upset by unranked Cali
fornia in triple-overtime on Satur
day.

Powell, on the other hand, wasn't
as effective as he would have liked.
The Pac-10's leading receiver com
ing into the game was limited to only
two catches for 29 yards.
"They were doubling up and
rolling over the corner so sometimes
you have to look to other guys,"
Teevens said. "But getting the ball
to him certainly helps our game."
Stanford also thought that get
ting the ball to junior running back
Kenneth Tolon who against
BYU rushed for a career-high 141
yards would help its game as well.
But Tolon only managed to aver
age three yards per carry on 29 tries
and had trouble bouncing to the out
side when the Huskies' stingy defen
sive line led by Terry Johnson
clogged up the middle.
"They were pretty well-prepared
for the things we were doing," Smith
said.
A lot of second guessing after a
loss is natural, but many might be
wondering why Stanford has all of a
sudden turned into a conservative of
fense and a pressure defensive team.
The coach has a simple answer.
"We are going to be involved in a
lot of close ballgames," Teevens
said.
If Teevens is right, then maybe -
just maybe Powell's "new" opti
mistic attitude is justified, as well.
Maybe Stanford can take a few
more lessons away from this latest
loss for the next close one.
However, the road doesn't get
any easier for the unranked Cardi
nal. After a bye week, Stanford
will face No. 10 USC on Saturday,
Oct. 11th in Los Angeles. The Tro
jans should see their ranking drop
in the next couple of days because
they were upset by unranked Cali
fornia in triple-overtime on Satur
day.
SEATTLE, Wash. Luke Powell was adamant
in his beliefs and maybe that's a signal of a
new attitude for Stanford football.
After Stanford lost its Pacific 10 Conference
opener to Washington 28-17 a game where
the Cardinal went toe-to-toe with the No. 18
Huskies until the waning moments Powell
seemed to typify the sentiments of a dejected
but-confident locker room.
"We have the talent to compete with top-20
teams and we have the talent to contend for the
Pac-10 championship," Powell said. "We stuck
our nose in there and got physical."
True, the Cardinal (2-1, 0-1 Pac-10) was
plagued by mental mistakes and poor execution
on both sides of the ball in the loss.
But there seems to be a prevailing sentiment
that this young Stanford squad is taking lessons
away from its losses instead of becoming deject-

Ed and quitting.
"I think we can correct some of the bad plays
we made," Powell said. "If you make the same
mistakes, then that's when you start feeling like
there are problems.
"How you bounce back from mistakes is what
makes you better in the long run."
Stanford went ahead 17-14 on a 28-yard
Michael Sgroi field goal with 8:02 remaining in
the third quarter after being stopped a grand
total of six times inside Washington's 10 yard
line.
After that field goal, however, Stanford
gained only 61 yards of total offense. Meanwhile,
Washington took the lead for good on a six-yard
touchdown reception by Reggie Williams.
The last six Stanford drives paint a telling pic
ture:
Three and out.
Five and out.

Junior running back Kenneth Tolon pushes past an opponent at the Cardinal's conference-opener against the Washington Huskies. Tolon, who had a career game last week against Brigham
Young, was unable to repeat on the Huskies' turf, running the ball for an average of only three yards per carry in the 28-17 Stanford loss.
Three and out.

Interception.
Interception.
Those last two mistakes came
courtesy of Trent Edwards the
first of which turned out to be the
game-sealing pick that Washing
ton's Derrick Johnson returned 36
yards for a touchdown late in the
fourth quarter.
Edwards was an unspectacular
16-of-32 for 159 yards and two
touchdowns and two intercep
tions but showed a little moxie at
times in scrambling, making reads
and progressions.
"Trent was pretty up-and
down," said Stanford head coach
Buddy Teevens. "It's a new experi
ence for him.
"He saw [Washington] move
faster and react a little more rapidly
than he was used to. [But] he contin
ues to show poise given what he's
seen for the first time as a young
guy."
Edwards threw both of his touch
downs to tight end Alex Smith, the
first (a 12-yarder) on a crossing pat
tern and the second an 18-yard com
pletion on a streak downfield.
According to Teevens, Edwards
checked down to the secondary re
ceiver Smith on both plays, showing
a little more patience than he had
against Brigham Young a game ago.
And with all the pre-season hype
over Stanford's esteemed tight end
trio of Smith, Brett Pierce and Matt
Traverso, the two touchdowns were
the first to a tight end for the Cardi
nal this year.
"We've been trying to do that
since the beginning of the season,"
Smith said. "Based on the defenses
we've faced, we haven't been able to
get too involved. This was the first
game we thought we'd be able to be
effective."
Powell, on the other hand, wasn't
as effective as he would have liked.
The Pac-10's leading receiver com
ing into the game was limited to only
two catches for 29 yards.
"They were doubling up and
rolling over the corner so sometimes
