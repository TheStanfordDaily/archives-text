# Huskies hold Stanford down
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. Luke Powell was adamant
in his beliefs and maybe that's a signal of a
new attitude for Stanford football.
After Stanford lost its Pacific 10 Conference
opener to Washington 28-17 a game where
the Cardinal went toe-to-toe with the No. 18
Huskies until the waning moments Powell
seemed to typify the sentiments of a dejected
but-confident locker room.
"We have the talent to compete with top-20
teams and we have the talent to contend for the
Pac-10 championship," Powell said. "We stuck
our nose in there and got physical."
True, the Cardinal (2-1, 0-1 Pac-10) was
plagued by mental mistakes and poor execution
on both sides of the ball in the loss.
But there seems to be a prevailing sentiment
that this young Stanford squad is taking lessons
away from its losses instead of becoming deject-

Ed and quitting.
"I think we can correct some of the bad plays
we made," Powell said. "If you make the same
mistakes, then that's when you start feeling like
there are problems.
"How you bounce back from mistakes is what
makes you better in the long run."
Stanford went ahead 17-14 on a 28-yard
Michael Sgroi field goal with 8:02 remaining in
the third quarter after being stopped a grand
total of six times inside Washington's 10 yard
line.
After that field goal, however, Stanford
gained only 61 yards of total offense. Meanwhile,
Washington took the lead for good on a six-yard
touchdown reception by Reggie Williams.
The last six Stanford drives paint a telling pic
ture:
Three and out.
Five and out.

Junior running back Kenneth Tolon pushes past an opponent at the Cardinal's conference-opener against the Washington Huskies. Tolon, who had a career game last week against Brigham
Young, was unable to repeat on the Huskies' turf, running the ball for an average of only three yards per carry in the 28-17 Stanford loss.
