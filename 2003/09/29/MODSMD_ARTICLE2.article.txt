# French House vandalized
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Residents of La Maison Francaise awoke
to an eerie prank Saturday morning when
they discovered the house's entire dining
area covered with a thin layer of tinted pow
der.
Senior Rachel Hepworth, who went
down to the dining room around 7:30 a.m.
Saturday, was one of the first to notice the
strange residue.
"At first I was not really paying much at
tention, but then I saw the chalky powder all
over my clothing," Hepworth said.
According to Resident Assistant Kate
Pruitt, a senior, the slightly yellow powder
was thicker in the back of the dining room
and dissipated toward the front near the
doors. She suspects that it was either the
powder from a fire extinguisher or chalk.
In addition to the powder, Pruitt discov
ered cobwebs on the newsstand in the din
ing room, which surprised her because the
stand was new and had only recently been
placed there.
"It all looked very odd, like the French
House from the crypt," Pruitt said. "The
dust was spread so perfectly under the table
and on top of the chairs, almost as if some
one had levitated the furniture in order to
spread the substance evenly around the din
ing room."
Pruitt and House Manager Elizabeth Er
aker, a senior, called the campus's emer
gency facilities line to report the strange
powder. The two did not initially call the po
lice, but when someone used a lemon to
break one of the house's back windows sev
eral hours later, they placed a call to the
Stanford University Police Department.
Though the police surveyed the scene,
they did not reach any conclusions about
the source or identity of the mysterious

powder. Emergency facilities arrived about
eight hours after the incident was reported
and spent two hours vacuuming the dining
room. Workers will return to the house in
the upcoming week to thoroughly shampoo
the dining room carpet.
"The issue really was not a big deal
around the house," Pruitt said. "We all
think it was funny and assume that it is some
kind of prank. We are not really focusing on
finding out who did it, but it is inconvenient
that the house now has to pay for the bro
ken window and the carpet cleaning."
