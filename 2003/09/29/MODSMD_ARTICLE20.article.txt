# Flawless game needed for "W"
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. Stanford knew it
was going to have to play flawless foot
ball to beat Washington on the road
something it hadn't done in 11 previous
meetings dating back to 1975.
And the streak in the House of Hor
rors will continue for yet another year
after the Cardinal used the deadly com
bination of big plays, turnovers and
penalties to lose its conference opener.
Stanford gave up Washington's
longest run and pass from scrimmage on
the season, committed nine penalties
for 90 yards and threw two intercep
tions late in the game when it was given

a chance to come from behind.
"We did some things that we had
talked about not doing," said Stanford
head coach Buddy Teevens.
Late in the opening quarter, with the
Huskies facing a second-and-16 from
their own 47 yard-line, Stanford decid
ed to employ its most effective pressur
ing formation the X-backer align
ment that places an extra linebacker
outside the offensive tackle.
But Washington had Stanford scout
ed well.
Huskies offensive coordinator John
Pettas called for a draw to running back
Rich Alexis, and the Washington tail
back made him look like a genius.
Alexis burst through the middle
of the Stanford line and out into the
open field, eventually rumbling for
a 53-yard touchdown without even
being touched.
"He pierced our front," Teevens
explained. "We were in a pressure
situation, and [Alexis] popped it
and went the distance.
"We had manned-up so there
was nobody left to take him down.
He showed some good speed."
Then, on the ensuing Washing
ton possession to start the second
quarter, the Huskies were saddled
with a third-and-four from their
own 26.

Time for a running play, right?
Wrong.
The Huskies' always-dangerous
Reggie Williams found himself in
man-coverage on the outside against
redshirt freshman TJ. Rushing, and
the wideout took advantage.
He used a slant-and-go a
double move that completely
faked out a confused Rushing
and had eclipsed the entire Stan
ford secondary by at least 15 yards
before Washington quarterback
Cody Pickett got him the ball.
Williams did the rest of the
work, racing downfield for a 74-
yard score and Pickett's 12th ca
reer touchdown pass of 50 yards or
more.
"We gave him a big play on a
busted coverage," said Stanford de
fensive back Leigh Torrence. "It
wasn't a great play by [Williams] by
any means, but it was set up well."

Stanford also committed a slew
of ill-timed penalties that negated
kick returns, extended Washington
drives and killed the momentum of
one particular goal-line situation.
But no mistake was bigger than
the one made by Luke Powell late
in the third quarter.
Washington had just scored a
go-ahead touchdown (21-17) and
seemingly taken control of a game
it was favored to win by 13 points
when Stanford got the ball back.
Teevens decided to insert little
used freshman David Marerro at
tailback to get a fresh set of legs
some action.
Marerro, in his only play of the
entire afternoon, went in motion
from left to right and took a hand
off from Trent Edwards at full
speed.
He found his way down the
sideline and broke the play for a

big 47-yard gain into Washington
territory.
But wait.
There was that little yellow flag
behind the play.
Stanford namely Powell
was called for holding, and so the
play was erased.
The Cardinal would eventually
be forced to punt and never mount
ed a sustained drive the rest of the
game.
"It was a big play that we could
have used at that point in the
game," Teevens said.
Powell seemed to have a little
grief for the officials after the game.
"I guess because I blocked [the
cornerback] so well, they thought it
was a hold," Powell joked. "If I was
an official, I wouldn't have called
that."
Stanford still had a chance to
win the game when it got the ball

back with 2:54 remaining. But after
two fruitless plays, Edwards forced
the action and diminished any
chances of a comeback.
On third-and-10, Powell ran an
out route right to the first-down
marker.
But Washington cornerback
Derrick Johnson read Edwards'
eyes and stepped in front of Pow
ell, turning a possible first-down
completion into a 36-yard touch
down the other way for the
Huskies.
"I had been taught all week not
to throw across the field," Ed
wards conceded. "But I just forced
it, hoping we could break a big
play out of it."
Edwards eventually threw an
other interception with just over a
minute remaining, and Stanford's
miserable day at Husky Stadium
was complete.
