# Women sweep at Maples
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
did sweep both Washington State and Washington this
weekend at Maples Pavilion, the games themselves
were much tighter than the final match-score shows.
In its two home matches, the Cardinal (10-2,4-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) did go 2-0, winning both in only
three games. However, in the combined six games, the
Cardinal never took a game from the Cougars or the
Huskies by more than seven points and overall, only
outscored the Washington schools 183-147.
Moreover, the matches were strangely reminiscent
of Stanford's Oregon-Oregon State series, in which
the Cardinal narrowly defeated the Ducks and
Beavers by scores of 30-27,27-30,30-22,30-19 and 30-
24,33-31,30-19, respectively.
There is a silver lining, however.
The fact that Stanford was able to come through with
two important conference wins despite injuries to senior
setter Anna Robinson, junior defensive specialist Leahi
Hall and senior right side Sara Dukes, shows resolve.
"Even though [Washington and Washington
State] aren't our toughest competition in the Pac-10,
it's great for us to be playing them now," said sopho
more setter Katie Goldhahn, who played the entirety
of both matches due to Robinson's injury. (Goldhan
had been splitting the playing time with Robinson
earlier this season.)
"By having such strong competition in the confer
ence we are able to play a lot of close matches and
know that we are always building and getting better,
which will help us be prepared when we play teams
such as USC and UCLA."
In its conference home opener on Friday night, the
Cardinal faced the Washington State Cougars in front
of more than 1,900 fans. In only 85 minutes, despite a
strong effort by the overmatched Cougars, the Cardi
nal was able to take the match in three games 30-28,
30-23,30-18.
But the match started out close, as the Cougars
were able to hold off five game points, before falling
to the Cardinal 30-28 in game one. Washington State

then came out strong in the second, taking a 6-4 lead
before Stanford went on a six-point run and would
not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game, taking
the seven-point victory. Stanford entered game three
carrying the momentum of its 2-0 lead and was able to
put the Cougars away with little trouble, winning the
match on a Washington State service error.
Saturday night's match against the No. 13 Wash
ington Huskies proved even tighter for the Cardinal
as all three games were decided by seven points or
less, 30-23,33-31,30-24.
Goldhahn set her hitters solidly, as she had 45 as
sists and both of her middle blockers, seniors Jennifer
Harvey and Sara McGee, and outside hitters, Nna
mani and Richards, ended the game with 10 or more
kills. It was Nnamani again who led the attack, with
another 19 kills.
Despite taking an early lead in game one, the
Huskies were able to hang close to the Cardinal be
fore dropping the game 30-23 on a kill by Harvey.
Washington came out for game two fired up, keeping
even closer to Stanford before allowing the Cardinal
to reach game point at 29-23.
The Huskies, however, were able to fight off six
game points, forcing the game to a 29-29 tie before
taking the lead for the first time at 29-30. Nnamani
then came through with two key kills for the Cardinal,
as Stanford reclaimed the lead at 31-30. After a ser
vice error by the Cardinal which again tied the game,
McGee and Nnamani put two more balls down to
take game two at 33-31.
Game three was again a battle for the Cardinal, as
the Huskies would not give up without a fight. Wash
ington remained close throughout, but fell behind 22-
12 and was unable to close the gap, as Stanford took
the game and the match 30-24.
"Both Washington and Washington State came
out strong and are great at playing a very quick
game," Goldhahn said. "They are both good teams
and will be successful in the conference this year."
Stanford will travel down south to face Arizona
and Arizona State on Thursday and Friday, re
spectively. Both games will be broadcast on
KZSU, 90.1.

even closer to Stanford before allowing the Cardinal
to reach game point at 29-23.
The Huskies, however, were able to fight off six
game points, forcing the game to a 29-29 tie before
taking the lead for the first time at 29-30. Nnamani
then came through with two key kills for the Cardinal,
as Stanford reclaimed the lead at 31-30. After a ser
vice error by the Cardinal which again tied the game,
McGee and Nnamani put two more balls down to
take game two at 33-31.
Game three was again a battle for the Cardinal, as
the Huskies would not give up without a fight. Wash
ington remained close throughout, but fell behind 22-
12 and was unable to close the gap, as Stanford took
the game and the match 30-24.
"Both Washington and Washington State came
out strong and are great at playing a very quick
game," Goldhahn said. "They are both good teams
and will be successful in the conference this year."
Stanford will travel down south to face Arizona
and Arizona State on Thursday and Friday, re
spectively. Both games will be broadcast on
KZSU, 90.1.
