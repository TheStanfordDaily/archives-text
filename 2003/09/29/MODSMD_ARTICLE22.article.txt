# Men snap six-game losing streak
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
In the 32nd minute of the Cardinal's 4-1 victory over UC-
Irvine (3-6) on Sunday, Anteater junior Davis Yemane fired a
goal into the net unassisted, past Stanford's goalkeeper, fresh
man Andrew Kartunen, who was struggling to regain his foot
ing from a save he made only seconds earlier.
With the scoreboard reading 1-0 in UCl's favor, Stanford re
grouped and sent out a message to Irvine, and everyone watch
ing.
The message: We will not go quietly.
Just two minutes after the Anteaters racked up a goal, se
nior midfielder Mike Wilson aimed a free kick at junior
teammate Chad Marshall, who headed the ball into the left
corner of the net.
By the end of the game, the Cardinal made quite a statement
of energy and resilience, wiping out UCI, 4-1 in Stanford's first
victory since its season opener against Cal State-Fullerton.
The win was a refreshing triumph after dropping a game to
No. 24 Fairleigh Dickinson on Friday night, 3-1.
Marshall's initial goal started a surge of energy on the Car
dinal team, which did not allow Irvine a single good shot at the
net for the remainder of the game.
"It was just a beautifully placed kick, and we really didn't
want to go into halftime down by one," said Marshall of his sec
ond goal on the season.
The Cardinal proceeded to punch through the Anteater de
fense, relying heavily on juniors James Twellman, Darren Fer
nandez and Matt Janusz to keep pressure on the goal.
The squad scored again in near back-to-back plays in the
56th minute on a Janusz-assisted goal from senior and team
captain Abe Geiger and a Janusz goal assisted by freshman
Bret Shimizu.
Janusz also knocked in Stanford's fourth goal in the 76th
minute on a breakaway following a forced Irvine turnover.
"None of us have ever gone winless for six games in anything
before," Janusz said, "So [in today's game] there was some frus
tration and a lot of energy."
"It's relieving," said head coach Bret Simon with a post
game smile that said it all. "This is a big confidence booster
for us."
The boost was desperately needed after the face-off with the
Knights on Friday.
Entering the game, the Cardinal expected a rough battle, but
never could have predicted the slaughter that ensued.
Stanford managed, for the first time this season to out-shoot
its opponent, 14-3, but amazingly, Fairleigh-Dickinson scored
on all three of its attempts, a feat rare in NCAA soccer and
shocking to the Cardinal squad.
The Stanford team, in contrast, was unable to find the net,
despite some close shots.
"As a young team, we're still looking for a concept and
searching for what works best," Simon said. "[The Knights] are
just a great counterattacking team, and when we left ourselves
open, they punished us for it."
The Cardinal sidestepped a shutout on a goal by junior
Sean Whalen, the second of his career, on a pass from junior
Todd Leber.
That play was the only flaw in Fairleigh Dickinson goal
keeper Andrew Nucifora's night, as the senior posted save after
save on his way to a 4-1-1 record.
The tournament also included No. 18 California, who was
upset by UC-Irvine 1-0 on Friday, and followed that up with a
2-0 win over Fairleigh Dickinson Sunday afternoon.
At the end of the weekend, all four participating teams fin
ished with identical 1-1 records, which forced a decision to be
made based on the number of goals scored by each team.
Stanford won the tournament overall with five goals, fol
lowed by Cal, Fairleigh Dickinson, and UCI.
The Cardinal face-off against No. 5 Santa Clara on Thursday
at 7 p.m. on Maloney Field.
