## Ask Vinni: The Daily's new sex columnist 
### Vinni Intersimone 
Hello, and welcome to my
new column: The Sex Column.
My name's Vinni, and when I'm
not ranting about anything and
everything sex-related, I'll be
telling you how to have better sex
and I'll be answering all your
sex questions.
Now, I know you're asking:
Why on earth would I ever take
sex advice from a guy I've never
met named Vinni? And my an
swer would have to be because
I'm gay and I know what I'm talk
ing about. Gay people know sex
like monkeys know bananas. It's
part of our image. And to be per
fectly honest, we go at it a great
deal more than the average ape.
But how do I know about
straight sex, many of you might
ask. While I don't claim to be an
expert, I can tell you honestly that
I am an expert. There is no possi-

ble way any
straight guy un
derstands girls
better than I do,
just as there is
no possible way
any girl under
stands straight
men better than
I do. These two
assertions rest
mainly in the

fact that there's a battle of the
sexes waging constantly: if not
over who's better than whom, it's
over who's going to sleep with
whom. In either of those wars, I'm
the United Nations. I'm the one
who can understand both sides,
simply because I belong to neither.
There are other reasons you
want me to tell you how to handle
sex. As a guy, I understand how
horny men are, and in a few years
I too can be a sketchy grad stu
dent. As a gay man, however, I
understand how it feels to be on
the receiving end of typical male
behavior; you never know if a guy
wants you or just your body, and
you can never tell how seriously
he wants either. Sex is very much
a guessing game. Does he like
me? Should I kiss him? Would
she slap me if I put my hand
there?
With sex there is always an ac
tion to take or not to take. I'm
here to advise you what to do and
what not to do. It's a complicated
game, but if you're willing to play
and open to getting better, it's the
best game in the world.
Better than Parcheesi.
OK. There's a lot to cover;
let's get started. Today we'll be
discussing the quintessential part
of sex: enjoying the process as
much as the outcome. If you want
to be good in bed, you have to un
derstand that every single action
you take has to be done with pur
pose and care. Good sex isn't
measured exclusively by how ex
plosive your orgasm is.
Good sex is measured by how
good you made the person feel
throughout the experience. If you
grab a person not unlike the
serial groper throw him on a
bed, and have your way with him,
you have almost certainly failed
in sex, and may very well have
committed a felony again, not
unlike the serial groper. Even if
the sex wasn't all that bad, you've
missed countless opportunities to
make it better. Every individual
touch is as important as the final
outcome. Even simple caressing
can make a person feel extremely
good. It shows him that you care
for his entire body, even the non
sexual parts. It shows him that
you care for the person.
Focusing on individual touch
slows the experience down so
that you can stop and realize that
you are actually enjoying what's
going on, that this event didn't
just happen. Exploration is key.
Be graceful, and don't fumble
around. Realize that all touch
feels good if done with style and
care. People enjoy an infinitely
vast array of touch, but if you take
your time, you'll soon figure out
what makes a girl or guy feel real
ly good. And then you've won.
Go celebrate!
