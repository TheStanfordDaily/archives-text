# Hop to it... or not?
## Fountain hopping, a Stanford tradition, can be a risky activity 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
For those who splish more than you splash, a word of
advice. Beware of F.T.D.s fountain-hopping transmit
ted diseases. Fountain hopping is one of the University's
oldest and wackiest traditions. Most students come away
unscathed perhaps with only a few sniffles or a stubbed
toe. But the sport poses far greater health risks than most
students are aware.
Dr. David D. Thompson Jr., director of public health
in East Lyme, Conn., discussed why the sport might not be
such a good idea after all.
"Going in the fountains is comparable swimming in an
unchlorinated swimming pool," he said. "The tempera
ture is such in California that the water can be quite
warm.'
Thompson listed the possible illnesses that can be con
tracted through fountain hopping. They include: Giardia
lamblia, an intestinal protozoan; Hepatitis A, a virus caus
ing fever, nausea and abdominal pain; E. coli, diarrhea
causing bacteria; and Pfeudomonas folliculitis, the so
called "hot tub dermatitis" that causes pustules and a rash.
Students and peer health educators seem to have
steered clear of these nasty maladies. Peer Health Educa
tor Kristen Carothers, a junior, has never had a fountain
hopper come to her with a serious problem.
"I've only had one kid ask me for a band aid because
he ran into something on the trip," she said. "Nobody that
I know of has gotten sick with a cold or flu."
Freshman / Sophomore College Peer Health Educa
tor Sara Weekly, a junior, has never treated a student for
fountain hopping-related injuries or illnesses. She has ex
perienced problems of her own, however.
"I did manage to kick a hole in my shin freshman year
thanks to the light fixtures in the red hoop fountain," she
said. "On that same trip, another girl in my dorm tore her
leg open on the lip of the circle fountain outside Old
Union. Other than those sorts of accidents, the main thing
I would worry about is slipping while running wet from
fountain to fountain, especially in traction-less shoes like
flip-flops or sandals."
The Stanford Medical Student Guide calls fountain
hopping a "fun and free way to beat the heat," but fails to
mention that it is also a fun and free way to get very cold.
Sophomore Laura Billadello tested the waters one
"freezing" and rainy midnight. She weighed the conse
quences before diving in.
"I definitely considered what might happen to me,"
she said. "I looked at the water and I thought, 'I could
get a rash.' That probably had to do with the fact that my
mother is a dermatologist. In the end I just said, 'What
ever, its still fun.' I didn't get sick or anything."
Sophomore Lindsay Mecca went for a swim outside
Green Library with a group of 10 friends last November.
She had one painful mishap but no life-threatening acci
dents.
"I was the last person to jump in the fountain and I
forgot to watch out for the little rectangular thing on the
side when I dove in," she said. "My big toe slammed into
it. I didn't break anything, but it really did hurt."
Freshman Robert Negrete had a similarly bad expe
rience at the "hoop."
"I guess it was the Thursday night that we moved in
and some people in our dorm went as a group to foun
tain hop," he said. "I decided to run through the ring of
falling water from the inside to the outside, and when I
did that, I got up some good speed at least for running
through the water and hit my leg on a metal pipe that
was submerged. I got out of the fountain and inspected
my leg where it had hit, and there was a small gash, but
nothing very significant. There was a little blood and lit
tle puss, but it was no big deal really."
Negrete's injury didn't prevent him from continuing
the circuit.
"I fountain hopped with the other people in all the
other fountains as well," he said. "Of course, I was very
wary of submerged pipes."
