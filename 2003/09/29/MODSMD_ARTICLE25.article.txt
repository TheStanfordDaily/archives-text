# Daily Trainer extols the many virtues of running

### SARAH DOUGLAS DAILY TRAINER 
Runners are the most prevalent species of
athletes on campus. These can be spotted
trapeezing around campus drive, rushing to
class after a recent bike theft, or fleeing the
scene of a party broken up by the Stanford
Police Department. To ensure the survival of
the species, a few safety tips below are put
forth for runners and non-runners alike. Fol
lowing these simple rules can lead to in
creased fitness and the greater likelihood of
making it to the end of the year alive.
First, dangerous ultra-violet rays make
daytime running a hazard, so consider the

joys of a late road run. Invisible-Ninja night
running is an exciting after-hours pastime.
Dressing in all black and jumping in front of
oncoming cars will spice up any cardiovas
cular workout. Won't those drivers be sur
prised? Kudos to you. If you're thinking of
running on roads, consider whether to run
with or against the traffic. Running against
traffic allows you to keep an eye on those
kamikaze SUVs, but also pits you against
cyclists zooming past you at the speed of
light. For the best of both worlds, try jog
ging down the middle of the road. The yel
low line makes a nice comma, clearly
marked running path and honking cars will
alert you of safety hazards.

Another way to keep your run safe is to
exercise with a buddy. Try and find a begin
ner without much endurance. Soon you will
know the incalculable rewards of helping
your inexperienced friend challenge his lim
its as you sprint off and leave him behind you.
His long trek back fraught with tears and
wrong turns will build character. If you
buddy gets too lost, don't worry, he can hitch
hike back with in that shady Cadillac that's
been following you for the last three miles.
Let me explain to you the game of chick
en. The object is to be the last one to flinch or
swerve away from a head-on collision that is
about to occur. Good-hearted runners let the
truck win and make a show of hurling them

selves into bushes. The runner gets to cry
"chicken!" out the window. Good times.
Also, for all the single guys driving out
there, if you see any ladies running in sports
bra, honk as loudly as possible. We want you
to do that. Truly. Its not that the weather is
hot or our shirts are rubbing in weird places.
We're just playing a coy game. Be bold.
We're fast, in more ways than one, so stop
ping and soliciting our wares usually results
in roadside assistance, if you know what I
mean.
Keep these tips in minds for a fun-filled
year of running. And always remember, run
like you've just stolen something.
Especially if it's true.
