# Kappa Sig party shut down
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The first fraternity party of the new
academic year was shut down around
12:15 am Saturday morning after an in
toxicated student was sent to the hospital
in an ambulance from the Kappa Sigma
| house.
"Kappa Sig decided to shut down the
party after learning of the incident and
discussing it with the campus police,"
said fraternity president Keaton Miller, a
senior.
Many students were upset at having
to leave early.
"All of a sudden, the music stopped
and the lights turned on and the party
just ended," said sophomore Matt
Stolzar. "I was a little disappointed, but I
left passively. I figured it was Stanford,
so parties getting shut down early was
nothing new."
Sophomore Jennie Broder called the
decision to shut down the party "stupid."
"A party shouldn't be responsible for
what one person does on their own time
before the party," she said. "If the per
son had fallen and broken their leg, they
wouldn't have shut the party down to
make sure that the ground was suffi

ciently level."
Sophomore Vinay Mahagaokar was
outside waiting to get into the party
when the ambulance pulled up to the
house.
"I hoped the person was okay," he
said. "But I was pretty sure that the cops
would shut down the party. They've be
come much more strict about parties at
Stanford and if the person who got sick is
underage, they assume that people were
serving alcohol to minors."
Miller insisted that the fraternity was
not to blame for the incident.
"Kappa Sigma maintains that we fol
lowed all of the University's party-plan
ning guidelines and took every precau
tion to ensure a safe party for all our
guests," he said.
When asked about the possibility of
probation for the fraternity, he respond
ed by saying, "We care not to speculate
on any future possibilities."
Miller concluded by saying, "I am
confident Kappa Sigma handled the situ
ation to the best of its ability. It is unfor
tunate that the party had to shut down
early. Nonetheless, we wanted to take
every precaution to ensure the safety of
our residents and our guests."
