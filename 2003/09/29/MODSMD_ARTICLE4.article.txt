# ASSU Course Guide remains unmodified

### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
You hear a lot of interesting things when
you talk to Stanford students about the
ASSU Online Course Guide; many of them
fall along the lines of sophomore Matt
Squeri's quizzical response: "There's a
course guide?"
Contrary to popular belief, there is, in
deed, a course guide available online for
current students to investigate how their
predecessors felt about Introduction to In
ternational Relations, IHUM courses, or
Professor Gerhard Casper's accent.
The guide, available at
http://courseguide.stanford.edu, provides
students with a search format similar to that
found at the Axess online time schedule, al
lowing them to choose a department, a
course number or title and a specific profes
sor. A fruitful search will lead a student to a
page filled with comments about professors
that have taught the class in the past and a
chart that gives the course a rating of one to
five on topics like "Ability to Engage" and
"Assignments."

Despite good intentions, the site remains
veiled in relative obscurity. According to
ASSU Senate Chair Josh Shipp, the site's
publicity is "mainly word-of-mouth."
And lately, mouths have few kind words
for the guide.
A recent perusal of popular courses - in
cluding Economics 1, Math 51, Professor
Hurlbut's Bioethical Issues in Human Biol
ogy, and more - found not a single comment
from any quarter after Fall 2001-2002. This
means that for many, if not most, courses of
fered, course guide information has not
been updated for nearly two years.
"The course guide is a service project,"
said ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa,
"which means that it originated within the
ASSU elected structure, either the senate or
the executive, but it is now separate from
both the senate and the executive office and
is run independently by other students."
Other examples of service projects, ac
cording to Shipp, are the Stanford Concert
Network and the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
"They're autonomous entities," said
