# ASSU Course Guide remains unmodified

### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
You hear a lot of interesting things when
you talk to Stanford students about the
ASSU Online Course Guide; many of them
fall along the lines of sophomore Matt
Squeri's quizzical response: "There's a
course guide?"
Contrary to popular belief, there is, in
deed, a course guide available online for
current students to investigate how their
predecessors felt about Introduction to In
ternational Relations, IHUM courses, or
Professor Gerhard Casper's accent.
The guide, available at
http://courseguide.stanford.edu, provides
students with a search format similar to that
found at the Axess online time schedule, al
lowing them to choose a department, a
course number or title and a specific profes
sor. A fruitful search will lead a student to a
page filled with comments about professors
that have taught the class in the past and a
chart that gives the course a rating of one to
five on topics like "Ability to Engage" and
"Assignments."

Despite good intentions, the site remains
veiled in relative obscurity. According to
ASSU Senate Chair Josh Shipp, the site's
publicity is "mainly word-of-mouth."
And lately, mouths have few kind words
for the guide.
A recent perusal of popular courses - in
cluding Economics 1, Math 51, Professor
Hurlbut's Bioethical Issues in Human Biol
ogy, and more - found not a single comment
from any quarter after Fall 2001-2002. This
means that for many, if not most, courses of
fered, course guide information has not
been updated for nearly two years.
"The course guide is a service project,"
said ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa,
"which means that it originated within the
ASSU elected structure, either the senate or
the executive, but it is now separate from
both the senate and the executive office and
is run independently by other students."
Other examples of service projects, ac
cording to Shipp, are the Stanford Concert
Network and the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
"They're autonomous entities," said
Shipp, of the service projects. "They get
their own funding."
In the case of the ASSU Course Guide,
the $ll,OOO operating budget comes en
tirely from special fees - in other words,
from students.
This budget includes $3,000 for flyer
distribution, newspaper ads and equip
ment maintenance.
The other $B,OOO pays for the salaries
of staff members, including $3,000 for
the director, a position which "deserves

a high pay as it is hard to find well
rounded students with the right skill-set
and self-direction to do this job," ac
cording to the Special Fees 2003-2004
Itemization for the ASSU Online
Course Guide.
The information editors, who collect,
edit and enter the student comments for
the site, "are usually paid a wage of
about $l2-$l3 an hour since they must
do high-quality, painstaking work in
picking out the right comments and typ
ing them into a spreadsheet," the Item
ization explained.
"They get the class information from
the registrar's office, and then they have a
system for comments from students,"
Shipp said.

Ideally, the site is updated once a quar
ter, prior to the quarter, according to
Shipp.
"It hasn't been updated this quarter, and
we're trying to talk to [the Course Guide
staff] and find out why not," he said. "I am
as curious as you are [with regards to
delay]."
Yet with $ll,OOO in special fees being
funneled to a site that has seen few up
dates in the past two years, where is all the
money going?
"We're trying to get more involved
with the service projects to make sure
they're, doing their jobs,", Shipp said. "One
j of ouj?goals for this year is to sit down with
all the service projects and make sure
they're on the same page."
