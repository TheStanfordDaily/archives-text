# Row Houses, GovCo to charge for printing
## 
### ALAYNA BUCKNER 
The last bastions of free printing are falling, as
Residential Computing announced that the Row
and the Governor's Corner houses of East, Mur
ray and Yost will now charge 10 cents a page to
print-the same as all other residences.
Additionally, Sweet Hall will stop offering
free printing next year.
In the past, Res Comp provided Row houses
and Governor's Corner residences with printers.
Using money collected from residents' board
bills, the houses would then have to buy their own
paper and toner. Students would not have to pay
for individual print jobs.
Starting this year, though, Res Comp will pro
vide the 36 Row houses and three independent
Governor's Corner houses with paper and toner,
which means that students will have to pay the 10-
cents-a-page print fee that residents in other
dorms must pay.
Although the switch brings up the expected

complaint of how expensive printing is on cam
pus, not all students view the change negatively.
"It's the yin and yang of free printing," said se
nior Paloma Rosenbaum, who lives in Murray. "I
am a little disappointed that we don't have free
printing, but if it was coming from house dues,
then it wasn't really free, we just didn't know we
were paying for it." According to Rosenbaum,
printing costs used to make up more than half of
Murray's budget.
According to Res Comp's Web site on free
printing, there are four reasons Res Comp has de
cided to make the switch to a pay-per-page policy
for Row houses and Governor's Corner dorms.
First, Res Comp hopes to offset other printing
related costs. Although it increased the price per
page last year to 10 cents from seven cents, Res
Comp is still not making enough to maintain and
replace the printers in all 77 residential computer
clusters.
Second, it hopes to make the costs of printing
more equitable. Res Comp explains that students

living in the 36 Row houses and three Governor's
Corner residences print about four times the
number of pages as those in other houses. There
fore, printers in those residences wear out sooner
and have to be replaced more often. However,
because Res Comp buys new printers with the
money it makes from print accounting, everyone
paying the 10-cents-a-page fee is paying for the
new printers on the Row.
Also, whenever students from other resi
dences went to computer clusters on the Row to
print for free in previous years, the people living
in the house were actually paying for the service.
Res Comps says the change will ensure that the
amount people pay is proportionate to the
amount they print.
Despite the promised benefits, some students
grumble at the steep price.
"It was a lot easier [to print without paying],

and really convenient," said Stephanie Shelton, a
senior.
Shelton said that she used to print more
than one draft of a paper, and even notes she
took in class. Now, as the HP AC in Toyon, she
has her own printer-and understands how
much it costs.
"I don't use my own printer as much," she
said. "I have to buy the ink cartridges, and they
are really expensive. So I try to minimize print
ing."
But Res Comp says this is a main goal of the
changes. When printing is free, students can
print anything they want-regardless of whether
they need it or not. As soon as students have to
pay, however, they stop printing unnecessarily,
thus reducing the amount of wasted paper and
toner.
Res Comp also hopes to improve the quality
and stability of printing on the Row. By decreas
ing the amount printed, Row printers should
break down less. Currently, about two non-Row
printers break down a quarter, whereas on the
Row, two printers break down a week.
But residents of those houses still think the
price is too high.
"I only print the final draft-which means I
have to proofread on the computer, which kind
of sucks," said sophomore Ratul Narain. "Also,
last year I took a class where all the readings were
online. I could print [for free] at Sweet Hall, until
I used up my quota."
His roommate, sophomore Greg Laughlin
agrees.
"Ten cents a page is ridiculous-its not even
color," he said.
