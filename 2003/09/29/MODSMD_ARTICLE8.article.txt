The 1469 first edition of Pliny's
"Natural History" and a German
1930 edition of Hamlet are two of 30
rare books that will be on display at
"In Folio: Rare Volumes in the Stan
ford University Libraries," an exhib
it at the Peterson Gallery in the
Green Library's Bing Wing until
Oct. 19, at which point they will be
returned to student use.
Each of the books, owned by the
Department of Special Collections,
has been used in the last two years in
a Stanford class or academic presen
tation. Most are first editions and
hand printed.
The purpose of this particular ex
hibition, says John Mustain, the li
brarian in charge of the display, was
to "bring out the fact that [Stanford]
is a research library."
Mustain stressed that each of these
books served as an academic tool at
Stanford and not merely as a show
piece. Each of the books can be re
quested by any Stanford student or
visitor and examined in the library.
"I think that it's pretty smart that
they're [displaying the texts] because
you get to see what Stanford really has
offer," said senior Anton Dybuncio.
The books are all folios, large
books that use sheets of paper fold
ed once to create the leaves of the
book. Such a format is expensive to
publish but was often subsidized by
rich benefactors before printing

presses were in wide use for the type
of works displayed. The format was
employed to convey the importance
of special texts, such as the Bible or
"The Divine Comedy."
Today, these books are used by
University classes, including courses
in the History of Science, English,
Classics and Art departments.
Mustain said that these books
seem more special and instructive to
students because "you see [the text]
in its original state with exquisite
handmade paper. You're holding it
and realizing that you're holding the
first one ever published."
Many of the books are illustrated
as well, using copper engravings or
wood blocks, the methods common
ly employed with hand printing. In
order to protect the colors and im
ages in the folios from over-expo
sure to light, a page can only be dis
played for a certain number of days
before the page has to be turned.
"The exhibit was really impres
sive," said sophomore Silvia
Babikian. "When I came in there I
just assumed I'd be seeing old
Shakespeare texts, but in fact there
were a lot more. The diversity of the
subject material and the beauty of
the texts themselves were really in
teresting. I'm glad that there are so
many resources for students to use in
their academic work."
The exhibit is open during the
regular hours of Green Library and
is located in the Bing Wing's Peter
son Gallery.
