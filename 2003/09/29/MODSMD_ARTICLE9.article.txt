# 'Serial groper' still at-large
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The "serial groper" is still on the loose.
Despite media attention and police ef
forts to find the man, who gropes
women's backsides as he bikes by, at least
two additional incidents have been re
ported since Sept. 9. A total of 18 inci
dents have been reported since the grop
er first appeared in late spring.
The most recent descriptions of the
groper match previous reports. He is de
scribed as a heavyset white or Hispanic
male between 5'7 and 5'9". He is most
often believed to be 19 to 25 years old, al
though some estimates have placed his
age as high as 30 years old.
The two most recent occurrences took
place in front of Stern Hall and Mars, where
the suspect grabbed at two victims who
were walking at night as he rode by them.
A man matching the description of the
groper was also recently spotted peering
into Soto, but left after residents asked
him to leave twice.
Police caution students to be aware of
their surroundings when walking in the dark
and to travel in groups. If any suspicious be
havior related to the incidents is observed,
students should call the police immediately.
"The sooner victims act, the easier it
will be for us to apprehend [the groper],"
Sgt. Rick Tipton said in a previous inter
view with The Daily.
