## Stanford Hospital, Palo Alto Med Center ordered to pay Redwood City boy 
### TANIA ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Hospital and the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic were ordered last week to pay $7O million to a 9-
year-old .boy, after a San Francisco Superior Court
jury ruled he had been improperly detected for a
metabolic disorder after his birth, which led to perma
nent mental retardation.
The $7O million will be spread over the lifetime of
the child, Redwood City resident Michael Cook. At
this time, the hospital must pay Cook $2 million; the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic is responsible for another $6
million.
"Hie child requires lifetime care, speech therapy,
occupational therapy, special education in a private
school, lifetime rehabilitation, and he won't be em
ployable in his future," said Cook's lawyer, David B.
Baum of Baum & Blake in San Francisco. "Add all
that up, and you get that much money."
The immediate $2 million payment still represents
a considerable sum, according to Debra Zumwalt,
Stanford's General Counsel, who says such a hefty
verdict has not been turned against Stanford Hospital
in years.
"It's a very large verdict for Stanford Hospital and
one that we don't agree with," Zumwalt said.
Cook suffers from brain damage that could have
been prevented had the hospital followed standard
procedures, Baum said.
"This is a case of negligence," he said. "[The hospi
tal] claimed it met the standard of care but it didn't"
Hospitals are required by the California Depart
ment of Health to perform a newborn screening test at
least 12 hours after a baby's birth in order for his or her
metabolism to stabilize.
Stanford Hospital staff tested Cook just four hours
after his birth, not allowing enough time for the results
to be accurate, and for the disorder, called PKU, to be
noticed
The pediatrician examining Cook at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic also failed to recognize signs of the de
veloping disease, said Baum.
"Pediatricians look for classic signs of normal de
velopment, like when a baby keeps his head up, crawls,
grasps, notices, sits up, walks or says his first words,"
Baum said "[Cook] had none of those signs and for
the first two years didn't speak, crawl or walk."
PKU is characterized by the lack of an enzyme
needed to process most food, which can lead to men
tal retardation. Newborn babies that test positive for
PKU are put on a strict, special diet, so that they can
lead normal, healthy lives, but in Cook's case, the dis
order was not detected until he was 6 years old, caus
ing irreversible impairment.
According to Baum, the brain damage has ren
dered Cook unable to speak or acquire full use of his
body. Also, he must be fed through a tube in his stom
ach and receive attendant care for the rest of his life,
said Baum.
Stanford Hospital & Clinics expressed concern
over Cook's condition but disagreed with the trial's
verdict
"Despite the tragic nature of this case, Stanford
Hospital & Clinics does not believe there was any neg
ligence by the hospital in this incident, which acted in
full compliance with the standard of care at the time of
the incident," wrote a spokesperson in a press release.
