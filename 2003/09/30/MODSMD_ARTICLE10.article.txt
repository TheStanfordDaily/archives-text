## BLOWING INTO TOWN Isabel destroys houses, builds community 
### KATHRYN WALLACE 
This past Saturday, the Colony
Pines neighborhood in Yorktown,
Va. held its first annual barbeque.
This possibly banal, very American
event is worthy of mention for one
reason: Just 11 days ago, these neigh
bors didn't even know each other.
Funny how a natural disaster can
bring a group together.
The natural disaster in question
has a name: Isabel, as in Hurricane
Isabel. The nasty weather system
killed 23 people, flooded coastal
parts of North Carolina, Virginia
and Maryland, and took out modern
conveniences on the East coast for
six million people.
Almost two weeks later, trees are
still lying across houses; water still
flows through streets and buildings,
and early damage estimates look to
be upwards of $1 billion. That price
tag is probably significantly mitigated
by the ad hoc neighborhood rescue
squads I saw moving down streets
with power saws, removing the evi
dences of a category two hurricane.
The storm canceled my flight here
from my hometown of Yorktown,
Va. I still didn't take it seriously
though. Preparations on the whole
were pretty light since most southern
Virginians thought this was the stan
dard end-of-summer hurricane we've
heard about every year. "The Storm
of the Century is coming!" we were
told by raincoated weather forecast
ers positioned on windy coastlines.
The locals laughed at the transplants
that boarded up their windows and
ran to the grocery store for bread at
the mere mention of a hurricane.
Maybe the beaches get pounded, but
Yorktown, located on the York River
at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay,
has always been spared.

In typical overreaction, school
and government jobs were closed
Sept. 17, the day before the hurri
cane was set to hit. We heard con
flicting reports about the strength of
Isabel. Some said she was the most
powerful hurricane ever recorded;
some said she would disintegrate
into a weaker storm at landfall.
Isabel, it turned out, was both.
Thursday afternoon, Isabel blew
into Yorktown and while it was
downgraded from a category five
storm to a category two, southern
Virginia hadn't been hit like that for
100 years.
I used to fancy myself a "storm
chaser," but that afternoon I sat in
fear and darkness with my sister and
her husband, hearing trees slam into
nearby houses and watching big trees
—2O feet of more in diameter
come up by the roots during a wind
blast. In all, nine trees fell in my sis
ter's yard, four of those on her house.
Late that night, after the wind
and rain ceased, the neighbors
stumbled out of their homes to as
sess the damage. Trees had sliced
through homes like hot knives
through butter; flying debris or
falling trees smashed cars sitting in
driveways and garages; manicured
lawns were spoiled with deep
craters where trees stood just ear
lier that day. Power, phone lines
and even cell phones were out. But
everyone was accounted for and
no one in this lucky neighborhood
was injured.
And then a strange thing hap
pened. A battery-powered radio
was turned from weather news to
music. A grill was fired up. Neigh
bors opened their slowly defrosting
freezers and pooled their resources,
and a makeshift celebration began
in the middle of the street.

Maybe we'd been cooped up too
long without any of the diversions
electricity provides. Maybe the lack
of any form of modern communica
tion made us all revert to a less mod
ern form of communication: face to
face discourse. Maybe real danger
made us all realize how much we
needed the person that lived beside
us. Introductions were made.
Strangers opened up their homes to
each other. A community was born.
The next morning, possibly the
most American of activities began:
work. I didn't see anyone wring
their hands or wail for lost posses
sions. I did see tears, but they fell
from jokes or labor. There was no
neighborhood meeting to access
needs and divide tasks or any fami
ly that tended to just their own
yard. Everyone pitched in what
they could. A group took off in
pick-up trucks to clear trees off the
roads. Others moved from house to
house, pulling trees off roofs and
cars, cutting, sweeping, burying, re
pairing. By the end of the first day,
Isabel's mark was softer and
Colony Pines felt like family.
I finally made it out of Yorktown,
(landing this position of columnist
based on a letter I dictated to a sister
in Arizona from a borrowed cell
phone) but a few things have
changed because of my brush with
nature's fury: I've thoroughly read
the earthquake preparedness guides
in my student housing folder that I
would have disregarded before Is
abel, and I've met my neighbors. It
happens that we need each other, so
if you live nearby, be expecting an
invitation to my barbeque.

In typical overreaction, school
and government jobs were closed
Sept. 17, the day before the hurri
cane was set to hit. We heard con
flicting reports about the strength of
Isabel. Some said she was the most
powerful hurricane ever recorded;
some said she would disintegrate
into a weaker storm at landfall.
Isabel, it turned out, was both.
Thursday afternoon, Isabel blew
into Yorktown and while it was
downgraded from a category five
storm to a category two, southern
Virginia hadn't been hit like that for
100 years.
I used to fancy myself a "storm
chaser," but that afternoon I sat in
fear and darkness with my sister and
her husband, hearing trees slam into
nearby houses and watching big trees
—2O feet of more in diameter
come up by the roots during a wind
blast. In all, nine trees fell in my sis
ter's yard, four of those on her house.
Late that night, after the wind
and rain ceased, the neighbors
stumbled out of their homes to as
sess the damage. Trees had sliced
through homes like hot knives
through butter; flying debris or
falling trees smashed cars sitting in
driveways and garages; manicured
lawns were spoiled with deep
craters where trees stood just ear
lier that day. Power, phone lines
and even cell phones were out. But
everyone was accounted for and
no one in this lucky neighborhood
was injured.
And then a strange thing hap
pened. A battery-powered radio
was turned from weather news to
music. A grill was fired up. Neigh
bors opened their slowly defrosting
freezers and pooled their resources,
and a makeshift celebration began
in the middle of the street.

Maybe we'd been cooped up too
long without any of the diversions
electricity provides. Maybe the lack
of any form of modern communica
tion made us all revert to a less mod
ern form of communication: face to
face discourse. Maybe real danger
made us all realize how much we
needed the person that lived beside
us. Introductions were made.
Strangers opened up their homes to
each other. A community was born.
The next morning, possibly the
most American of activities began:
work. I didn't see anyone wring
their hands or wail for lost posses
sions. I did see tears, but they fell
from jokes or labor. There was no
neighborhood meeting to access
needs and divide tasks or any fami
ly that tended to just their own
yard. Everyone pitched in what
they could. A group took off in
pick-up trucks to clear trees off the
roads. Others moved from house to
house, pulling trees off roofs and
cars, cutting, sweeping, burying, re
pairing. By the end of the first day,
Isabel's mark was softer and
Colony Pines felt like family.
I finally made it out of Yorktown,
(landing this position of columnist
based on a letter I dictated to a sister
in Arizona from a borrowed cell
phone) but a few things have
changed because of my brush with
nature's fury: I've thoroughly read
the earthquake preparedness guides
in my student housing folder that I
would have disregarded before Is
abel, and I've met my neighbors. It
happens that we need each other, so
if you live nearby, be expecting an
invitation to my barbeque.
