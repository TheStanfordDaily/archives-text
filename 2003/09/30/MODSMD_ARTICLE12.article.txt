## Associate advising director discusses the challenges of academic guidance 
### DANDRE DeSANDIES 
The Daily Editorial on freshman advising
("UAC: A headless horseman," Sept. 25)
provides me with an opportunity to high
light important aspects of the freshman ad
vising program. These are items often
missed in the discussions about program
modifications. We all agree that every fresh
man deserves quality advising; we also need
to understand the challenges involved in
reaching this goal.
About six years ago, Lori White asked me
to help her revamp freshman advising. We
set out to rework the system, recruiting more
faculty advisors, strengthening training for
all advisors, and recognizing outstanding ad
vising, to name a few of the immediate
changes. White's vision was that no student
should fall through the advising cracks. To
enhance freshman advising, White also initi
ated programs with help from other staff at
the UAC, including Expanded Advising
(programs with a graduate mentor compo
nent), the Sophomore Mentor Program (fac
ulty advising students from their introducto
ry seminars), and Early Warning (faculty in
forming the UAC about students struggling
in introductory courses). One challenge of

developing and maintaining such a multi-lay
ered operation is making sure that all of the
pieces fit and that the players understand
their roles and perform them well. No doubt
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein's leader
ship will help to clarify the issues and further
improve freshman advising. It seems, howev
er, that the Editorial Board equates quality
in freshman advising with an increase in fac
ulty participation. While I believe more fac
ulty involvement will certainly be beneficial,
I would like to share what I have learned
about several other key components of ef
fective freshman advising.
A basic premise shared by those involved
in advising is that undergraduate education
at Stanford demands broad intellectual en
gagement. It makes sense for new members
of the academic community to explore this
expansive universe, learning about things
they may not have known existed. Freshmen
must make distinct adjustments to college
studying and test-taking, forming and sus
taining relationships with peers and non
parental adults, and handling greater levels
of personal autonomy. Good freshman ad
vising requires the ability to recognize and
relate to the particular needs of this entering
college age-group, to assist with this adjust

ment to college life, and to open students to
exciting educational opportunities.
I have learned that faculty who currently
advise freshman groups understand the com
plexity of the task and make excellent advi
sors. Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas invites
students to his home for Thanksgiving dinner
and unabashedly advises them to take his fa
vorite courses and professors. Earth Systems
Prof. Julie Kennedy spent close to a week
working out some sticky Advanced Place
ment issues for a freshman in her group whom
she had not yet met. One faculty member,
who happens to be a senior university official,
has taken time from his packed schedule to
find a non-responsive student in trouble at his
dorm room. While it is desirable to have more
faculty like these involved, the reality is that
faculty here have an extraordinary list of com
peting demands on their time. Most faculty
thus choose not to devote their time volun
teering for this task. There are, however,
many faculty who help freshmen in other im
portant ways, teaching introductory seminars,
attending Faculty Nights in the dorms, or
hosting faculty dinners for Expanded Advis
ing Programs. We should not forget these con
tributions when discussing freshman advising.
I have learned that many staff, graduate

students, and alumni enjoy working with
freshmen. They have a broad understanding
of the Stanford culture and are adept at con
necting students to the academy. Priscilla
Blinco is legendary in her ability to learn
about her advisees' intellectual interests and
to put them into the hands of programs or
faculty who can help her students pursue
those interests. Students commend other ad
visors to us as well Maggie Kimball,
Ralph Levine, Laura Selznick, and Eugene
Yang to name a few. Non-faculty advisors
make up the largest group of committed and
knowledgeable academic advising volun
teers. How to recognize and how to develop
even further the contribution this group
makes to freshman advising will be chal
lenges new leadership has to address.
Criticisms of freshman advising are often
narrowly focused on academic advisers, peer
academic advisers, or the lack of faculty par
ticipation. On the other hand, most members
of the dorm advising team are not even men
tioned. The resident fellow convenes the ad
vising team in each house, setting the tone for
academic advising there. They work with
head peer academic coordinators: students
employed by the UAC to provide front line
advising information in the residences. UAC

residence liaisons professional staff mem
bers who serve as advising consultants to each
dorm are available daily at the UAC to
talk with students who have questions. While
there are a host of resources, faculty and oth
erwise, from whom freshmen can draw sound
academic advice, clarification and communi
cation of these resources to the freshmen are
critical in discussions of next steps.
Finally, I have learned that it is easier for
students to complain about advising than it is
for them to pursue the answers they seek.
Freshmen bear half the responsibility for a
positive advising experience. This is a rea
sonable expectation for young adults learn
ing to accept personal responsibility for their
lives. For me, then, faculty involvement is
one part of the advising solutions discussion.
Equally important is student initiative in
seeking out the existing range of available
advising resources. Putting the pieces togeth
er to form a seamless advising system is a
challenge we all look forward to addressing
in the coming years.

Criticisms of freshman advising are often
narrowly focused on academic advisers, peer
academic advisers, or the lack of faculty par
ticipation. On the other hand, most members
of the dorm advising team are not even men
tioned. The resident fellow convenes the ad
vising team in each house, setting the tone for
academic advising there. They work with
head peer academic coordinators: students
employed by the UAC to provide front line
advising information in the residences. UAC

residence liaisons professional staff mem
bers who serve as advising consultants to each
dorm are available daily at the UAC to
talk with students who have questions. While
there are a host of resources, faculty and oth
erwise, from whom freshmen can draw sound
academic advice, clarification and communi
cation of these resources to the freshmen are
critical in discussions of next steps.
Finally, I have learned that it is easier for
students to complain about advising than it is
for them to pursue the answers they seek.
Freshmen bear half the responsibility for a
positive advising experience. This is a rea
sonable expectation for young adults learn
ing to accept personal responsibility for their
lives. For me, then, faculty involvement is
one part of the advising solutions discussion.
Equally important is student initiative in
seeking out the existing range of available
advising resources. Putting the pieces togeth
er to form a seamless advising system is a
challenge we all look forward to addressing
in the coming years.

The Daily Editorial on freshman advising
("UAC: A headless horseman," Sept. 25)
provides me with an opportunity to high
light important aspects of the freshman ad
vising program. These are items often
missed in the discussions about program
modifications. We all agree that every fresh
man deserves quality advising; we also need
to understand the challenges involved in
reaching this goal.
About six years ago, Lori White asked me
to help her revamp freshman advising. We
set out to rework the system, recruiting more
faculty advisors, strengthening training for
all advisors, and recognizing outstanding ad
vising, to name a few of the immediate
changes. White's vision was that no student
should fall through the advising cracks. To
enhance freshman advising, White also initi
ated programs with help from other staff at
the UAC, including Expanded Advising
(programs with a graduate mentor compo
nent), the Sophomore Mentor Program (fac
ulty advising students from their introducto
ry seminars), and Early Warning (faculty in
forming the UAC about students struggling
in introductory courses). One challenge of

developing and maintaining such a multi-lay
ered operation is making sure that all of the
pieces fit and that the players understand
their roles and perform them well. No doubt
History Prof. Steven Zipperstein's leader
ship will help to clarify the issues and further
improve freshman advising. It seems, howev
er, that the Editorial Board equates quality
in freshman advising with an increase in fac
ulty participation. While I believe more fac
ulty involvement will certainly be beneficial,
I would like to share what I have learned
about several other key components of ef
fective freshman advising.
A basic premise shared by those involved
in advising is that undergraduate education
at Stanford demands broad intellectual en
gagement. It makes sense for new members
of the academic community to explore this
expansive universe, learning about things
they may not have known existed. Freshmen
must make distinct adjustments to college
studying and test-taking, forming and sus
taining relationships with peers and non
parental adults, and handling greater levels
of personal autonomy. Good freshman ad
vising requires the ability to recognize and
relate to the particular needs of this entering
college age-group, to assist with this adjust

ment to college life, and to open students to
exciting educational opportunities.
I have learned that faculty who currently
advise freshman groups understand the com
plexity of the task and make excellent advi
sors. Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas invites
students to his home for Thanksgiving dinner
and unabashedly advises them to take his fa
vorite courses and professors. Earth Systems
Prof. Julie Kennedy spent close to a week
working out some sticky Advanced Place
ment issues for a freshman in her group whom
she had not yet met. One faculty member,
who happens to be a senior university official,
has taken time from his packed schedule to
find a non-responsive student in trouble at his
dorm room. While it is desirable to have more
faculty like these involved, the reality is that
faculty here have an extraordinary list of com
peting demands on their time. Most faculty
thus choose not to devote their time volun
teering for this task. There are, however,
many faculty who help freshmen in other im
portant ways, teaching introductory seminars,
attending Faculty Nights in the dorms, or
hosting faculty dinners for Expanded Advis
ing Programs. We should not forget these con
tributions when discussing freshman advising.
I have learned that many staff, graduate

students, and alumni enjoy working with
freshmen. They have a broad understanding
of the Stanford culture and are adept at con
necting students to the academy. Priscilla
Blinco is legendary in her ability to learn
about her advisees' intellectual interests and
to put them into the hands of programs or
faculty who can help her students pursue
those interests. Students commend other ad
visors to us as well Maggie Kimball,
Ralph Levine, Laura Selznick, and Eugene
Yang to name a few. Non-faculty advisors
make up the largest group of committed and
knowledgeable academic advising volun
teers. How to recognize and how to develop
even further the contribution this group
makes to freshman advising will be chal
lenges new leadership has to address.
Criticisms of freshman advising are often
narrowly focused on academic advisers, peer
academic advisers, or the lack of faculty par
ticipation. On the other hand, most members
of the dorm advising team are not even men
