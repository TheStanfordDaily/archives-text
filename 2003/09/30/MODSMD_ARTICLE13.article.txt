## Ode to my lucky cleats 
### 
It's gotta be the shoes. If Barry Zito has
taught me anything about sports psy
chology, it's that you don't mess with the
shoes. Zito, shown in an Ã¼biquitous
Boys and Girls Club commercial, is shown
teaching the basics of sports superstitions to a
group of 8-year-olds, explaining that he
points his cleats directly south when they are
in his locker. When one of the kids moves the
shoes a few degrees to the east, Barry, the
vying Thespian, delivers the immortal line:
"What are you doing dude? Don't mess with
the shoes!"
Stick to the curveball Zito.
Important lessons for a young little lea
guer, but even more essential for a Stanford
Varsity athlete such as myself. You see, while
I like to think I'm a very rational person, able
to discern coincidence from causality, some
things are just too close to call. How can I say
with ultimate certainty that God isn't out

there, pissed at Moses for
dropping that one extra
tablet with the missing five
commandments which
state the sports supersti
tions you must abide by:
1. While entering a field
of athletic play, thou shalt
not step on a chalked line.
2. If your pitcher has a
no-hitter or perfect game,
thou shalt not discuss this

with him, for he knows it already, and any
undue pressure on him will cause him to
crack like Mariah Carey after "Glitter."
(Hey, God watches TRL.)
3. Never, ever, shall Nomar Garciaparra
take less than five seconds to step out of the
batter's box, fix his batting gloves and step
back in again, after every pitch.
4. Thou shalt never, ever, change your
socks if you win.
5. Thou shalt never follow the advice of
Turk Wendell (brushing teeth between in
nings, wearing crazy necklaces, squatting for
30 seconds on the mound, waving to the cen
ter fielder at the start of every inning and not
wearing socks at all), for he is certifiably in
sane.
What I'm saying is, you can just never be
sure that God didn't do this. And because of
this, I have a bit of a confession to make.
Let me explain: At our first soccer game of
the season, a road game facing Cal State-
Fullerton, I wore my trusty old Nike Zoom
Air Total 90 cleats. And while I didn't play, I
warmed up in them and wore them while on
the bench. The good news after that game: we
won. The bad news: My cleats developed a
big hole in the left toe, rendering them prac
tically unusable.
So I switched cleats, but I now feel that
may have been in error. As soon as I made
the Nike Mercurial Vapors (oooooh, saucy!)
my number one cleats, a donation from Chad
Marshall out of the goodness of his heart, we
began to slump, going winless in our next six
matches.
Now, I could attribute this slump to a dif
ficult strength of schedule, a grueling road
trip or playing in front of hostile crowds in
alien stadiums, but that would be too ratio
nal.
It had to be the cleats.
So for our last game against UC-Irvine, a
Sunday afternoon game that pitted us against
a team that had just defeated Cal, I switched
back to the Total 90's. Now, in the event that
I played in the game, I would have had to
switch to the Vapors, but while warming up
and on the bench, it had to be the Total 90's.
I think you know what happened. We
crushed them, 4-1, not only winning the
game, but winning the tournament.
Coincidence? I think not.
In my exuberance about my contribution
to the team's success, I asked a couple of
other soccer players about their supersti
tions.
Junior striker James Twellman, after con
vincing me I must continue with my Total
90's, refused to tell me any of his supersti
tions, citing that his first superstition is that
he doesn't talk about his superstitions.
But a freshman on the women's team,
Gina Farias-Eisner, explained that her main
superstition is that she must visualize herself
playing in the game before she plays. She just
takes a moment to see herself in the match
dominating the opposition, and she feels she
will play better.
To tell the truth, this is the only supersti
tion mentioned here that actually holds
water. Visualization is a tried and true way to
prepare, not like waving to the center fielder,
re-strapping your batting gloves or hopping
over foul lines. I mean, it's fairly obvious that
while brushing your teeth between every in
ning will do wonders for your oral hygiene, it
probably won't help you strike out Barry
Bonds. Everyone sees his or her own super
stition as a way of preparing for the game at
hand, but everyone has been perverted by in
ductive reasoning and poor logic.
So congratulations, Gina, you are a more
rational person than Barry Zito. Visualiza
tion will probably yield better results than
pointing your shoes southward. But then
again, I don't think I'm going to switch my
cleats anytime soon.

Spencer Porter, a junior majoring in American
Studies, promises to not write about soccer for
the whole quarter. He'd say who he is rooting
for in the playoffs here, but he's too supersti
tious. Hit him back at porters@stanford.edu
