# Crazy start to Pac-10
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was another wild weekend in the West.
Arizona's John Mackovic coached his best
game of the year and then got fired.
Coming off the biggest upset in the
country last week, Oregon gave up 55
points at home.
The conference's top team, No. 3 South
ern California, suffered an embarrassing
upset to a nondescript California squad in
triple overtime.
Once-heralded Arizona State suffered
a crushing road loss for the second week
in a row.
Amidst all that chaos, however, at least
two things went according to plan: Stanford
came home from Washington a loser for the
12th straight time, and UCLA worked its
way past San Diego State.

No, 10 Oregon shocked then-No. 3
Michigan 34-31 last week, and rode into this
weeks game a national darling making
the much-dreaded cover of Sports Illustrat
ed. The cover jinx came through yet again,
as No. 21 Washington State summarily ran
off 38 first-half points thanks to seven
first-half Oregon turnovers en route to a
dominating 55-16 victory.
Ducks' quarterbacks Kellen Clemens
and Jason Fife combined to throw seven in
terceptions for the Ducks (4-1,1-1 Pacific 10
Conference), and received no help from
running back Terrence Whitehead, who
gained only 22 yards rushing. Meanwhile,
Cougar Matt Kegel threw for three scores
without being intercepted, and the Cougars
(4-1,1-0) racked up over 100 yards on the
ground. (Not that they really needed it.)
The real shocker this week, though, was
No. 3 USC's stunning 34-31 overtime loss to

unranked Cal at Memorial Stadium.
The Golden Bears (3-3, 1-0) matched
USC (3-1, 0-1) score-for-score until the
third overtime, when Trojans kicker Ryan
Killeen missed a 39-yard field goal. Cal's
Tyler Frederickson whose previous two
kicks had been blocked calmly lined up
and drilled a 38-yarder.
The real story, though, was the way
Golden Bear head coach Jeff Tedford's
team shocked the Trojan defense. For the
first time in 23 quarters, USC allowed a
rushing touchdown.
And Cal's Adimchinobe Echemandu
became the first man to rush for 100 yards
against the Trojans in 16 games. Reggie
Robertson replaced starting quarterback
Aaron Rodgers for Cal, in the second half
and didn't miss a beat. The two combined to
tear apart the USC secondary in racking up
326 yards on 27-of-37 passing.

USC's ground game never got on track, and
Matt Leinart experienced some growing
pains, throwing three interceptions giv
ing Cal just enough to scratch out an unex
pected victory.
Arizona State (2-2,0-1), out of the rank
ings after a 21-2 loss to then-No. 18 lowa a
week ago, fell 45-17 on Saturday to a good
but-not-great Oregon State team (4-1,1-0).
Brandon Browner intercepted three
Arizona State passes, and Steven Jackson
rushed for 120 yards as the Beavers won big
at home, despite another shaky game from
quarterback Derek Anderson. The Sun
Devils' Hakim Hill gained 115 yards on the
ground and 96 yards as a receiver, but his
team couldn't find the endzone, as Andrew
Walter completed just 17-of-42 passes.

Tight end Alex Smith catches a ball in the Cardinal's Saturday loss to No. 18 Washington. The junior scored two touchdowns his first touchdowns of the season —in the loss to the
Huskies. The outcome of the Stanford-Washington game was one of the least surprising in Pacific 10 Conference weekend that saw several upsets.
with No. 19 Texas Christian (4-0)
as 15 1/2-point underdogs, but the
Wildcats held the Horned Frogs to
just one touchdown: a 98-yard re
ception by Reggie Harrell. It took
a 34-yard overtime field goal from
Nick Browne for the visitors to go
home happy.
Robert Merrill, a true freshman,
gained 148 yards for TCU. Arizona, as
has been the case all season, didn't gen
erate anything on the ground, but true
freshman Kris Heavner passed for 276
yards to keep the Wildcats in the game.
It wasn't enough, though, to save
the job of long-embattled coach
Mackovic, who was fired on Sunday
and replaced on an interim basis by
veteran defensive coordinator Mike
Hankwitz. Arizona had been

outscored 166-30 in its previous three
games, and the announcement was
expected.
UCLA (2-2,0-0) overcame a slew
of penalties to score its first home
touchdown of the year, scoring 17
second-half points to outlast the
Aztecs (3-2), 20-10. Sophomore
Drew Olson had a solid game, com
pleting 18-of-28 passes for 258 yards,
two touchdowns and no intercep
tions. Junior Taylor's 41-yard touch
down reception broke a 3-3 tie in the
third quarter.
Stanford (2-1, 0-1) lost to No.

traveling to Los Angeles on Oct. 7

Robertson replaced starting quarterback
Aaron Rodgers for Cal, in the second half
and didn't miss a beat. The two combined to
tear apart the USC secondary in racking up
326 yards on 27-of-37 passing.

USC's ground game never got on track, and
Matt Leinart experienced some growing
pains, throwing three interceptions giv
ing Cal just enough to scratch out an unex
pected victory.
Arizona State (2-2,0-1), out of the rank
ings after a 21-2 loss to then-No. 18 lowa a
week ago, fell 45-17 on Saturday to a good
but-not-great Oregon State team (4-1,1-0).
Brandon Browner intercepted three
Arizona State passes, and Steven Jackson
rushed for 120 yards as the Beavers won big
at home, despite another shaky game from
quarterback Derek Anderson. The Sun
Devils' Hakim Hill gained 115 yards on the
ground and 96 yards as a receiver, but his
team couldn't find the endzone, as Andrew
Walter completed just 17-of-42 passes.

Tight end Alex Smith catches a ball in the Cardinal's Saturday loss to No. 18 Washington. The junior scored two touchdowns his first touchdowns of the season —in the loss to the
Huskies. The outcome of the Stanford-Washington game was one of the least surprising in Pacific 10 Conference weekend that saw several upsets.
with No. 19 Texas Christian (4-0)
as 15 1/2-point underdogs, but the
Wildcats held the Horned Frogs to
just one touchdown: a 98-yard re
ception by Reggie Harrell. It took
a 34-yard overtime field goal from
Nick Browne for the visitors to go
home happy.
Robert Merrill, a true freshman,
gained 148 yards for TCU. Arizona, as
has been the case all season, didn't gen
erate anything on the ground, but true
freshman Kris Heavner passed for 276
yards to keep the Wildcats in the game.
It wasn't enough, though, to save
the job of long-embattled coach
Mackovic, who was fired on Sunday
and replaced on an interim basis by
veteran defensive coordinator Mike
Hankwitz. Arizona had been

outscored 166-30 in its previous three
games, and the announcement was
expected.
UCLA (2-2,0-0) overcame a slew
of penalties to score its first home
touchdown of the year, scoring 17
second-half points to outlast the
Aztecs (3-2), 20-10. Sophomore
Drew Olson had a solid game, com
pleting 18-of-28 passes for 258 yards,
two touchdowns and no intercep
tions. Junior Taylor's 41-yard touch
down reception broke a 3-3 tie in the
third quarter.
Stanford (2-1, 0-1) lost to No.
18 Washington (3-1, 1-0), 28-17,
and has a bye this week before
traveling to Los Angeles on Oct. 7
to face the Trojans.
In this coming weekend's Pac-10
play, Oregon travels to take on Utah,
Arizona State hosts USC, Oregon
State plays at California, Arizona
travels to Washington State and
UCLA hosts Washington.
It was another wild weekend in the West.
Arizona's John Mackovic coached his best
game of the year and then got fired.
Coming off the biggest upset in the
country last week, Oregon gave up 55
points at home.
The conference's top team, No. 3 South
ern California, suffered an embarrassing
upset to a nondescript California squad in
triple overtime.
Once-heralded Arizona State suffered
a crushing road loss for the second week
in a row.
Amidst all that chaos, however, at least
two things went according to plan: Stanford
came home from Washington a loser for the
12th straight time, and UCLA worked its
way past San Diego State.

No, 10 Oregon shocked then-No. 3
Michigan 34-31 last week, and rode into this
weeks game a national darling making
the much-dreaded cover of Sports Illustrat
ed. The cover jinx came through yet again,
as No. 21 Washington State summarily ran
off 38 first-half points thanks to seven
first-half Oregon turnovers en route to a
dominating 55-16 victory.
Ducks' quarterbacks Kellen Clemens
and Jason Fife combined to throw seven in
terceptions for the Ducks (4-1,1-1 Pacific 10
Conference), and received no help from
running back Terrence Whitehead, who
gained only 22 yards rushing. Meanwhile,
Cougar Matt Kegel threw for three scores
without being intercepted, and the Cougars
(4-1,1-0) racked up over 100 yards on the
ground. (Not that they really needed it.)
The real shocker this week, though, was
No. 3 USC's stunning 34-31 overtime loss to

unranked Cal at Memorial Stadium.
The Golden Bears (3-3, 1-0) matched
USC (3-1, 0-1) score-for-score until the
third overtime, when Trojans kicker Ryan
Killeen missed a 39-yard field goal. Cal's
Tyler Frederickson whose previous two
kicks had been blocked calmly lined up
and drilled a 38-yarder.
The real story, though, was the way
Golden Bear head coach Jeff Tedford's
team shocked the Trojan defense. For the
first time in 23 quarters, USC allowed a
rushing touchdown.
And Cal's Adimchinobe Echemandu
became the first man to rush for 100 yards
against the Trojans in 16 games. Reggie
Robertson replaced starting quarterback
Aaron Rodgers for Cal, in the second half
and didn't miss a beat. The two combined to
tear apart the USC secondary in racking up
326 yards on 27-of-37 passing.

USC's ground game never got on track, and
Matt Leinart experienced some growing
pains, throwing three interceptions giv
ing Cal just enough to scratch out an unex
