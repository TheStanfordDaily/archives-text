# Frosh make splash

Like many other freshmen, Jackson "JJ"
Garton and Beau Stockstill might feel that
disconcerting sensation of shifting from
being a big fish in a small pond to a small
fish in a big pond. And since they are water
polo players, it's not just because that
"pond" is bigger than it was in high school.
Garton, a driver, is one of the few first
years with time in the pool for the men's
water polo team this season. He also scored
a goal in the season opener against UC-
Santa Cruz.
And although Stockstill, a back-up
goalie from Newport Beach, hasn't seen
much action so far, he's probably seen more
minutes in the water than any of the other
first years, having played under head coach
John Vargas for three years in high school.
"I did get to play a quarter in our home
opener against BYU-Hawaii, which was
very exciting," Stockstill said.
Both freshmen are part of yet another
skilled recruiting class on a team that has
won 10 national titles.
"Garton will see a lot of action this year.
JJ is known for his great defensive play, but
his speed and counter attack abilities will
be a tremendous asset," Vargas said.
"Beau has played in four CIF champi
onship games [in high school], so he's used
to playing in high-level games."
Currently in the team's first subbing ro

tation, Garton, who began swimming at the
age of five, adds energy to the waves when
he dives into the game.
"I have come in off the bench and worn
down their players with my speed," Garton
said. "Simply because I am coming off the
bench fresh helps because the other players
have been playing for a while and are
tired."
An All-Central Valley selection from
Granite Bay High School, near Sacramen
to, Garton has been compared by Vargas
to former Stanford water polo star Jeff
Guyman, who graduated in 2002, because
of his defending skills at the two-meter
position. Vargas, however, said he also
sees potential in Garton as an offensive
player.
When he arrived on The Farm this sum
mer, Garton admits that he was intimidat

ed by the older members of the team, many
of whom are stars in the water polo arena,
but after training with them for the season,
he began to feel more at ease.
"I saw that they were all just regular,
fun-loving guys that really look out for the
younger players," said Garton, whose par
ents attended Stanford and whose sister,
Jessie, plays on the Princeton water polo
team.
Stockstill dreamt of attending Stanford
since he was five, even before he had heard
of water polo.
"Once I knew what college was I knew it
was going to be Stanford," he said. "It has
amazing academics. It's in California, but
Northern California is different. I don't
feel completely detached and in a foreign
land. It's a dream come true."
Still, both Garton and Stockstill realize

that their roles are not one of a starter, but
one of sitting in reserve and supporting
their teammates.
"I'm looking forward to contributing
and learning as much as I can playing the
role of coming off the bench," Garton said.
Like Garton, Stockstill has seen a big
difference between high school and colle
giate play, in particular in the quality of
shooters he'll face at the net.
"Playing at Stanford is a big step up
from high school: shooters are stronger,
faster, smarter and more accurate, so I
need to improve my quickness, leg strength
and overall feel for the game," Stockstill
said. "I anticipate that with time and a lot
of hard work, my skills will improve to
where I feel comfortable in front of any
