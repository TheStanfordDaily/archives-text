### CHRIS FERNANDO RYANHEFFERNAN THE HEIGHTS (BOSTON COLLEGE 
(U-WIRE) CHESTNUT HILL,
Mass. Current and former
Boston College female cheerleaders
have raised allegations that sports
marketing, a division within the ath
letic department that oversees the
cheerleading program, has mishan
dled cheerleading tryouts and un
fairly discriminated against several
women involved with the program.
"What went down [was that] peo
ple were picked based on their ap
pearance," said a current cheerlead
er who spoke to The Heights under
the condition of anonymity. "The
whole thing was ridiculous and out
rageous."
Several female students in
cluding current cheerleaders, as well
as cheerleading hopefuls told The
Heights that sports marketing
played a larger role in last spring's
tryouts than in past years, requiring
the women to pose for full-body
photographs, and unfairly limiting
the number of students that head
coach Erika Beam, who is in her first
full year as coach, could accept for
the team.
"It was absolutely sports market
ing who had the final say in the
spring tryouts," the cheerleader
added. "Never before have they
said, 'This girl is definitely off, and
this girl is definitely on.' "
Beam, the student said, told her
of sports marketing's role in the
process.

"They have invested a lot more
money [into the program] this year,"
she added.
Comparatively, The Heights has
learned that cheerleading programs
at the University of Connecticut, the
University of Notre Dame, the Uni
versity of Miami, and Providence
College do not involve sports mar
keting in the selection process, ac
cording to athletic department ad
ministrators at the schools.
Colette Dribben, who was on the
cheerleading squad her sophomore
year, said that full-body shots had
not been taken in past years, prior to
BC Sports Marketing's enhanced in
volvement.
"I don't recall turning in a picture,"
she said. "I guess the point would be to
give [it] to sports marketing."
Katie Arsenault, who attended
tryouts this past spring, agreed.
"To my knowledge, this wasn't
done before," she said.
Michelle Tetrault, who made the
first cut last spring, decided not to re
turn for callbacks.
"I thought it was odd that they
took pictures," she said. "I thought
the results were going to be based on
score. I didn't think it mattered what
we looked like. I heard that they had
never done that before."
The department has increased
the importance of appearance,
added Dribben.
"In my sophomore year, my
coach [then-coach Valerie Ander
son] would hear comments about
the length of the skirts," she said.
"She told me that she was going to

try and get shorter skirts because
shorter skirts equal more money
from alumni."
But Jamie DiLoreto, assistant
athletic director for sports market
ing, disputed the claims and defend
ed the process itself.
"We let everyone know what the
expectations were," he said. "They
had time to practice the routines,
and if they had any questions, they
could speak to the coach about it. I
think the whole process was very fair
and it was legit."
Coach Beam agreed.
"In no way was it [selection]
based on appearance," she said. "We
wouldn't have bothered with tryouts
if that were the case."
The requirements and proce
dures for tryouts, he added, were
listed online at www.bceagles.com
prior to the event.
According to the Web site,
women must have a minimum 2.0
GPA, maintain a "collegiate appear
ance" "looking professional," ac
cording to Beam and be able to
perform a variety of stunts, including
toe touches and tumbles.
While DiLoreto could not define
a "collegiate appearance," he said
that students trying out for the
cheerleading squad must "look the
part as a Boston College cheerleader
in terms of how well you can do your
facial expressions, how well your
eyes are catching the crowd, if you're
always smiling. That is what we're
looking for, and physical capability
also.
"If someone can't do a back som

ersault and they fly off to the side,
my impression of that is that is not
what we're looking for. I think our
procedures were fair. It's broken
down on the scoring sheet. It is based
on those numbers."
The numbers hold up, according
to Coach Beam
"If you were to look at the cur
rent team, you would know that it's
a diverse team. We have different
shapes, sizes, nationalities," Beam
said.
Each student is awarded up to
105 points per judge based on
cheer and dance skills (20 points
each), ability to perform jumps and
stunts (40 points), gymnastic skills
(15 points), and a personal inter
view (10 points).
"Appearance," which includes
"physical condition, neatness, and
overall appearance," is worth up to
five points in both the cheer and
dance categories, according to the
cheerleading scoring sheet obtained
by The Heights.
The panel of judges consisted
of Beam, head coaches from Har
vard and Tufts Universities, an
athletic administrator from the
University of Kentucky, and
DiLoreto, in his capacity as head
of sports marketing.
When asked about full-body pho
tos, DiLoreto originally denied claims
that they were taken, saying that they
only took headshots, but later admit
ted that he didn't remember the de
tails of the process.
"I don't remember if they were full
or not," DiLoreto said.

wouldn't have bothered with tryouts
if that were the case."
The requirements and proce
dures for tryouts, he added, were
listed online at www.bceagles.com
prior to the event.
According to the Web site,
women must have a minimum 2.0
GPA, maintain a "collegiate appear
ance" "looking professional," ac
cording to Beam and be able to
perform a variety of stunts, including
toe touches and tumbles.
While DiLoreto could not define
a "collegiate appearance," he said
that students trying out for the
cheerleading squad must "look the
part as a Boston College cheerleader
in terms of how well you can do your
facial expressions, how well your
eyes are catching the crowd, if you're
always smiling. That is what we're
looking for, and physical capability
also.
"If someone can't do a back som

ersault and they fly off to the side,
my impression of that is that is not
what we're looking for. I think our
procedures were fair. It's broken
down on the scoring sheet. It is based
on those numbers."
The numbers hold up, according
to Coach Beam
"If you were to look at the cur
rent team, you would know that it's
a diverse team. We have different
shapes, sizes, nationalities," Beam
said.
Each student is awarded up to
105 points per judge based on
cheer and dance skills (20 points
each), ability to perform jumps and
stunts (40 points), gymnastic skills
(15 points), and a personal inter
view (10 points).
"Appearance," which includes
"physical condition, neatness, and
overall appearance," is worth up to
five points in both the cheer and
dance categories, according to the
cheerleading scoring sheet obtained
by The Heights.
The panel of judges consisted
of Beam, head coaches from Har
vard and Tufts Universities, an
athletic administrator from the
University of Kentucky, and
DiLoreto, in his capacity as head
of sports marketing.
When asked about full-body pho
tos, DiLoreto originally denied claims
that they were taken, saying that they
only took headshots, but later admit
ted that he didn't remember the de
tails of the process.
"I don't remember if they were full
or not," DiLoreto said.
(U-WIRE) CHESTNUT HILL,
Mass. Current and former
Boston College female cheerleaders
have raised allegations that sports
marketing, a division within the ath
letic department that oversees the
cheerleading program, has mishan
dled cheerleading tryouts and un
fairly discriminated against several
women involved with the program.
"What went down [was that] peo
ple were picked based on their ap
pearance," said a current cheerlead
er who spoke to The Heights under
the condition of anonymity. "The
whole thing was ridiculous and out
rageous."
Several female students in
cluding current cheerleaders, as well
as cheerleading hopefuls told The
Heights that sports marketing
played a larger role in last spring's
tryouts than in past years, requiring
the women to pose for full-body
photographs, and unfairly limiting
the number of students that head
coach Erika Beam, who is in her first
full year as coach, could accept for
the team.
"It was absolutely sports market
ing who had the final say in the
spring tryouts," the cheerleader
added. "Never before have they
said, 'This girl is definitely off, and
this girl is definitely on.' "
Beam, the student said, told her
of sports marketing's role in the
process.

"They have invested a lot more
money [into the program] this year,"
she added.
Comparatively, The Heights has
learned that cheerleading programs
at the University of Connecticut, the
University of Notre Dame, the Uni
versity of Miami, and Providence
College do not involve sports mar
keting in the selection process, ac
cording to athletic department ad
ministrators at the schools.
Colette Dribben, who was on the
cheerleading squad her sophomore
year, said that full-body shots had
not been taken in past years, prior to
BC Sports Marketing's enhanced in
volvement.
"I don't recall turning in a picture,"
she said. "I guess the point would be to
give [it] to sports marketing."
Katie Arsenault, who attended
tryouts this past spring, agreed.
"To my knowledge, this wasn't
done before," she said.
Michelle Tetrault, who made the
first cut last spring, decided not to re
turn for callbacks.
"I thought it was odd that they
took pictures," she said. "I thought
the results were going to be based on
score. I didn't think it mattered what
we looked like. I heard that they had
never done that before."
The department has increased
the importance of appearance,
added Dribben.
"In my sophomore year, my
coach [then-coach Valerie Ander
son] would hear comments about
the length of the skirts," she said.
"She told me that she was going to

try and get shorter skirts because
shorter skirts equal more money
from alumni."
But Jamie DiLoreto, assistant
athletic director for sports market
ing, disputed the claims and defend
ed the process itself.
"We let everyone know what the
expectations were," he said. "They
had time to practice the routines,
and if they had any questions, they
could speak to the coach about it. I
think the whole process was very fair
and it was legit."
Coach Beam agreed.
"In no way was it [selection]
based on appearance," she said. "We
wouldn't have bothered with tryouts
if that were the case."
The requirements and proce
dures for tryouts, he added, were
