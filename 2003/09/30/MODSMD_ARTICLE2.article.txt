# Work unfinished in two buildings

### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
Construction of the Lorry I. Lokey Laboratory Building and ren
ovation of Jordan Hall, slated to be completed by the beginning of
the school year, are behind schedule and will not be finished until
later in the quarter.
The Lokey Laboratory, a $62.3 million research facility for the
chemistry and biological sciences departments, will house research
laboratories, lab support spaces, chemical stores and offices. Con
struction started last February and was supposed to be completed by
July and ready in August for researchers to move in.
According to Project Management Administrative Associate Nic
Durham, the delay is currently due to mechanical issues. The fire
alarm system did not pass testing by the Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall last week. As soon as the building has the approval of the
county, researchers will be allowed to move in, which, according to
Durham, is "any day now."
"They kept saying the project was on time until the end,"
Durham said. "One of the bones of contention is when they realized
they were going to be late."
Chemistry Prof. Barry Trost said the delay has created problems
by interfering with plans made and putting arrangements on hold,
specifically in terms of moving forward with his research.
"It is a very complicated building because we are trying to get as
much performance as possible," said Trost, who researches synthet
ic chemistry and plans to move into the new facility as soon as it is
ready. "We are cramming as much in there as possible and as a re
sult we are taking engineering to the extreme. This might be part of
the reason there has been some level of delay."
Durham claims the late opening has not had major consequences,
as there are no classes held there, so students are not affected, and
researchers who will be using the building can remain in their exist
ing labs.
Those who plan on using the facilities are looking forward to the
completion of the construction.
"It's exciting that I will be working in a truly state-of-the-art facility
doing [my research] in a fashion that is safe and effective," said Trost.
"Up to now, we had to adjust research to make do and to just be func
tional. For the first time I can truly say the facility is state-of-the-art."
The 85,000 square foot building will provide space for nine prin
ciple researchers, five from the biological sciences and four from
chemistry, along with 180 students and postdoctoral fellows. The
building will also house chemical storage rooms, an amphibian re
search area and a nitrogen service tank.
Plans for the Lokey Laboratory were announced two years ago
due to the need for more up-to-date lab facilities. In particular, the
synthetic chemistry labs in the Seeley Mudd Chemistry building no
longer met new Santa Clara County building codes.
"The overriding problem was the need for a laboratory appro
priate for the kind of research being done," Trost said.
Trost contributed to getting the new building approved. He said
that shortly after he came to Stanford in the late 1980s, issues with
inadequate facilities already began to surface. Recently, Trost said,
local authorities indicated that current laboratories were not meet
ing safety codes and that they would not allow such types of activi
ties to continue.
"It has become a terribly constricting activity in terms of what can
be done and how it can be done," Trost said. "These issues were be
coming stricter, so the ability to perform research was becoming
more and more restrictive."
Researchers will be moving from the Seeley Mudd Chemistry
and Gilbert Biological Sciences buildings. Although Lokey Labora
tory is housing two different departments, it is not meant specifical
ly to be interdisciplinary and the co-residence is more a result of
both departments needing new facilities.
Meanwhile, the expected $2.6 million renovation and remodel
ing of Jordan Hall that will create new administrative, lab and office
areas is also behind schedule, although it should be completely fin
ished by November.
Construction began last June and was to be completed by fall
quarter except for the first floor lounge. None of the areas where
renovation has been completed are occupied yet, although Mike
Mithen, project manager for the remodeling, said that some people
will begin moving in late this week.
Mithen said the failure to meet the planned completion date was
due to the unexpected extent of necessary asbestos removal.
"The poor condition of the existing asbestos fireproofing re
quired that nearly all of the fireproofing be removed in the project
areas and then replaced with new, sprayed-on non-asbestos fire
proofing," he said. "It also took the County of Santa Clara a bit
longer than usual to issue the building permit, and we were unable

As students return to class in Jordan Hall, its remodeling project remains unfinished. The construction of the
Lokey Laboratory, a new facility for the chemistry and biological sciences departments is also past deadline.
