# New Islamic studies program launched

### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has created a new pro
gram and professorship in Islamic
studies this year after receiving a $9
million endowment to promote the
understanding of Muslim culture. The
funds will be used to support lectures,
language instruction, and faculty and
student research, among other activi
ties.
The Islamic studies program has
been designed to provide "additional
faculty strength, improved language
resources and library holdings, and nu
merous educational events both with
in day-to-day Stanford existence and
open to the wider community," said
Religious Studies Prof. Robert Gregg,
the program's director

The expanded program will involve
several departments and faculty mem
bers from many disciplines, Gregg
said, but won't offer degrees. Howev
er, the University plans to establish an
honors program for undergraduates.
The program is still searching for a
senior scholar in Islam, and possibly a
second Islamic scholar in political sci
ence, history or anthropology, if the
position is funded.
Though the University already of
fers undergraduate and graduate
courses in the field, many believed
there were not enough to satisfy real
and potential student interest, which
increased dramatically after the Sept.
11,2001, attacks, Gregg said.
To fund the new program in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
the William and Flora Hewlett Foun
dation matched a $2.5 million dona
tion from Bay Area residents Sohaib
and Sara Abbassi and a $2 million
gift from alum Lysbeth Warren.
Stanford maintains a "unique po
sition in terms of shaping the next
generation of leaders in industry and
government," said Sohaib Abassi, a
native Pakistani and former execu

tive at Oracle. "We were impressed
by the strong desire of the Stanford
faculty to have such a program."
Warren, who has been working
with the University to create this pro
gram since 1988, felt that it was "an
absolute necessity" that a university
of Stanford's caliber recognize "the
breadth of what Islam represents
around the world, in terms of back
ground, history, and modern cul
ture."
"The University was well on its
way to this program before 9/11 hap
pened," she said.
Some say they are glad to see an
improvement in the resources devot-

Ed to Islamic studies at Stanford.
"Although the professors were
great, I felt like there weren't as
many classes on different issues as
there could have been," said Irem
Janjua, a 2003 graduate and former
president of the Muslim Students
Awareness Network. "I didn't feel
extremely limited, but I felt it could
have been better."
John Esposito, professor of reli
gion and international affairs at
Georgetown University, and vice
chair of the Center for the Study of
Islam and Democracy, will speak on
the future of Islam at the program's
inaugural event on Nov. 17.
