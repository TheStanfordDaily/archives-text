# Animal testing sites guard against attacks

Situated in a winding labyrinth
deep below the Stanford University
Medical School, researchers ex
plore the dynamics of the nervous
system, search for methods of treat
ing cancer and develop medical in
struments to make surgery safer
and easier. Their vessels for these
explorations are more than 109,000
laboratory animals, including mice,
rabbits, monkeys, dogs and owls.
In recent weeks, their field of study
has fallen under fire, leading some
Stanford researchers to pay closer at
tention to the security of their facilities.
In the early hours of Aug. 28, two
pipe bombs exploded at the Bay
Area office of the Chiron Corpora
tion, a biotech firm alleged to have
ties to companies involved with an

imal testing and research. Windows
facing the blast were shattered and
the building suffered only minor
damage.
But an e-mail from a militant an
imal rights group known as the Rev
olutionary Cells all but declared
war on area animal research facili
ties. In their manifesto sent to Bite
Back Magazine, the activists
promised that in their war for ani
mal rights "there will be no quarter
given and no more half measures
taken." According to the San Jose
Mercury News, the FBI believes the
group is part of a newly formed
branch of the Animal Liberation
Front, an activist group that wants
all use of animal products and all
scientific animal research to come
to an immediate halt.

lence have occurred at college campus
es. At Louisiana State University, the
Animal Liberation Front vandalized a
research laboratory on Sept. 23. Last
Thursday, unidentified activists left de
vices resembling Molotov cocktails in
front of a veterinary medicine building
at Washington State University. There
were no injuries in either attack.
Cohen: 'committed to research'
In spite of the attacks, Dr. Linda
Cork, the chair of the Department of
Comparative Medicine, said she is con
fident in the security of campus facili
ties, which include electronic pad locks
and security doors at all entrances.
"When activists get into a building,
they don't worry about what the research
is about, they trash it anyway, whether the
animals benefit the research or not," said
Cork, who declined to elaborate on secu
rity measures that have been taken, for
confidentiality reasons. "Animal activists
generally see any human-animal interac
tion, no matter what its nature is, as an ex
ploitation of animals. That's not true,
though —there are many beneficial inter
actions that humans and animals have,
scientifically or otherwise."
The attack on the Chiron Corporation
and attacks on the homes of Bay Area re
searchers has made an impact on Dr.
Harvey Cohen of the Stanford Bio-X

Program, a program focused on interdis
ciplinary biosciences research. But
Cohen says he plans to continue his work.
"Of course there's reason to be ap
prehensive of future attacks, but at the
same time it should not affect our ef
forts to help people," Cohen said.
"While these attacks have made me
feel less secure, I am committed to
doing the research that can have the
most beneficial effect on the health of
children and adults. I'm very satisfied
that Stanford's policy leads to the ap
propriate treatment of animals used in
scientific experiments."
Campus animal researchers are re
quired to adhere to a slew of regulations
and procedures mandated by the state
and federal government.
"Care is taken to minimize any pain
that animals undergo, and all animal re
search undergoes very careful scrutiny
for treatment of the animals and appro
priateness of the investigation," Cohen
said. "I have no reason to think that
these policies are not observed through
out the University."
Still, campus animal research has
met opposition from animal rights ac
tivists in the past. When the current re
search facilities were being constructed
in 1985, activists blocked construction
in court for 18 months.
'ln a perfect world/ no animal testing
Though campus facilities have not
received violent threats from activists
recently, some Stanford students say
they are opposed to animal testing.
"I think it's important that the scien
tific community, at Stanford and

throughout the world, works towards
eliminating the need for animal test
ing," said sophomore Claire Wagenseil,
a member of Stanford Vegan Action. "I
believe that there are some research
universities that do not participate in
animal testing, and, in a perfect world,
animals would never be considered as
an option for medical research."
Still, Wagenseil opposes the use of vio
lence to make a point against animal testing.
"Violence is not always necessary in
advocating political change," she said.
"It's a way to draw attention to the
more radical side of the animal rights
movement, but often does more harm
than good and can draw the type of neg
ative attention that the animal rights
movement doesn't want."
'Good science'
This November, inspectors from the
Association of Assessment for the Ac
creditation of Lab Animal Care
(AAALAC) are set to investigate campus
facilities in a regular inspection. The
AAALAC has power to revoke their ac
creditation if facilities are found in viola
tion of their standards for animal research.
Such an action would cut research funding
and spark investigations by government
authorities. Stanford's participation with
the AAALAC is purely voluntary.
"We do these things to establish a
basis for good science and thoughtful
animal use," Cork said. "We must justi
fy our research scientifically. We must
ask what the purpose is, what the quali
ty of life of the animal will be and we
must take into account all ethical con
siderations regarding the research."

said. "I have no reason to think that
these policies are not observed through
out the University."
Still, campus animal research has
met opposition from animal rights ac
tivists in the past. When the current re
search facilities were being constructed
in 1985, activists blocked construction
in court for 18 months.
'ln a perfect world/ no animal testing
Though campus facilities have not
received violent threats from activists
recently, some Stanford students say
they are opposed to animal testing.
"I think it's important that the scien
tific community, at Stanford and

throughout the world, works towards
eliminating the need for animal test
ing," said sophomore Claire Wagenseil,
a member of Stanford Vegan Action. "I
believe that there are some research
universities that do not participate in
animal testing, and, in a perfect world,
animals would never be considered as
an option for medical research."
Still, Wagenseil opposes the use of vio
lence to make a point against animal testing.
"Violence is not always necessary in
advocating political change," she said.
"It's a way to draw attention to the
more radical side of the animal rights
movement, but often does more harm
than good and can draw the type of neg
ative attention that the animal rights
movement doesn't want."
'Good science'
This November, inspectors from the
Association of Assessment for the Ac
creditation of Lab Animal Care
(AAALAC) are set to investigate campus
facilities in a regular inspection. The
AAALAC has power to revoke their ac
creditation if facilities are found in viola
tion of their standards for animal research.
Such an action would cut research funding
and spark investigations by government
authorities. Stanford's participation with
the AAALAC is purely voluntary.
"We do these things to establish a
basis for good science and thoughtful
animal use," Cork said. "We must justi
fy our research scientifically. We must
ask what the purpose is, what the quali
ty of life of the animal will be and we
must take into account all ethical con
siderations regarding the research."
Situated in a winding labyrinth
deep below the Stanford University
Medical School, researchers ex
plore the dynamics of the nervous
system, search for methods of treat
ing cancer and develop medical in
struments to make surgery safer
and easier. Their vessels for these
explorations are more than 109,000
laboratory animals, including mice,
rabbits, monkeys, dogs and owls.
In recent weeks, their field of study
has fallen under fire, leading some
Stanford researchers to pay closer at
tention to the security of their facilities.
In the early hours of Aug. 28, two
pipe bombs exploded at the Bay
Area office of the Chiron Corpora
tion, a biotech firm alleged to have
ties to companies involved with an

imal testing and research. Windows
facing the blast were shattered and
the building suffered only minor
damage.
But an e-mail from a militant an
imal rights group known as the Rev
olutionary Cells all but declared
war on area animal research facili
ties. In their manifesto sent to Bite
Back Magazine, the activists
promised that in their war for ani
mal rights "there will be no quarter
given and no more half measures
taken." According to the San Jose
Mercury News, the FBI believes the
group is part of a newly formed
branch of the Animal Liberation
Front, an activist group that wants
all use of animal products and all
scientific animal research to come
to an immediate halt.
Elsewhere, similar acts of vio


BETH LIEBERT/The Stanford Daily
lence have occurred at college campus
es. At Louisiana State University, the
Animal Liberation Front vandalized a
research laboratory on Sept. 23. Last
Thursday, unidentified activists left de
vices resembling Molotov cocktails in
front of a veterinary medicine building
at Washington State University. There
were no injuries in either attack.
Cohen: 'committed to research'
In spite of the attacks, Dr. Linda
Cork, the chair of the Department of
Comparative Medicine, said she is con
fident in the security of campus facili
ties, which include electronic pad locks
and security doors at all entrances.
"When activists get into a building,
they don't worry about what the research
is about, they trash it anyway, whether the
animals benefit the research or not," said
Cork, who declined to elaborate on secu
rity measures that have been taken, for
confidentiality reasons. "Animal activists
generally see any human-animal interac
tion, no matter what its nature is, as an ex
ploitation of animals. That's not true,
though —there are many beneficial inter
actions that humans and animals have,
scientifically or otherwise."
The attack on the Chiron Corporation
and attacks on the homes of Bay Area re
searchers has made an impact on Dr.
Harvey Cohen of the Stanford Bio-X

Program, a program focused on interdis
ciplinary biosciences research. But
Cohen says he plans to continue his work.
"Of course there's reason to be ap
prehensive of future attacks, but at the
same time it should not affect our ef
forts to help people," Cohen said.
"While these attacks have made me
feel less secure, I am committed to
doing the research that can have the
most beneficial effect on the health of
children and adults. I'm very satisfied
that Stanford's policy leads to the ap
propriate treatment of animals used in
scientific experiments."
Campus animal researchers are re
quired to adhere to a slew of regulations
and procedures mandated by the state
and federal government.
"Care is taken to minimize any pain
that animals undergo, and all animal re
search undergoes very careful scrutiny
for treatment of the animals and appro
priateness of the investigation," Cohen
said. "I have no reason to think that
these policies are not observed through
out the University."
Still, campus animal research has
met opposition from animal rights ac
tivists in the past. When the current re
search facilities were being constructed
in 1985, activists blocked construction
