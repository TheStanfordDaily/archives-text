explorations are more than 109,000
laboratory animals, including mice,
rabbits, monkeys, dogs and owls.
In recent weeks, their field of study
has fallen under fire, leading some
Stanford researchers to pay closer at
tention to the security of their facilities.
In the early hours of Aug. 28, two
pipe bombs exploded at the Bay
Area office of the Chiron Corpora
tion, a biotech firm alleged to have
ties to companies involved with an

facing the blast were shattered and

Back Magazine, the activists

taken." According to the San Jose

all use of animal products and all
scientific animal research to come
to an immediate halt.
