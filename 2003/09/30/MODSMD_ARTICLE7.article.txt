## Grad student governor? 
### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Oct. 7, Nathan Whitecloud Wal
ton will find himself in a hotly contested
race alongside a bodybuilder, a busty
porn star and a former child actor.
Up against these candidates, most
people would be shaking in their boots.
Not Walton. The strikingly tall Gradu
ate School of Business student, who
used to captain the Princeton basket
ball team and is the son of the NBA
Hall of Fame player Bill Walton, looks
relaxed, dressed down in a green T
shirt and black-and-blue flip-flops.
This kid's running for governor?
Walton's casual look belies his de
manding schedule: He is now devoting
20 hours a week on the campaign trail,
as he joins the likes of muscleman
turned-politician Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger and 133 other hopefuls in Califor
nia's upcoming gubernatorial recall
race. Here's how it happened.
"We were having a family discus
sion and lamenting the fact that Arnold
could be in charge of our lives," Walton
says. On the spur of the moment, his
family suggested that he enter the race.
"I really do believe I could do a better
job as governor then Arnold would,"
he says.
Walton, an independent, is running
on the platform, "Education now, edu
cated later."
"If we make the investment now in

education, then we'll have a more edu
cated society later, which is how the
world becomes a better place," he ex
plains. Walton's other concerns include
the deficit, the environment, higher ed
ucation costs and mass transit.
Many students didn't know that a
fellow Stanford student had tossed his
hat in the recall ring. The news elicited
mixed reactions.
"I'm very surprised that someone
would be able to juggle the many re
sponsibilities of a student while running
for governor," says John Schiavone, a
sophomore.
Some students wonder about Wal
ton's chances in the celebrity-studded
election. "I think it's in the general spir
it of the recall that anyone can run for
governor if they have the initial support
and resources," says junior Sam Chang.
"It's still highly unlikely that anyone
without a lot of initial popularity will be
able to win the race."
Others questioned Walton's mo
tives for running. "It's possible that I
would vote for a student [who was] a
very serious candidate with serious
views who would do a good job," says
sophomore Eh Lazarus. "But in this
case it seems more like a gimmick-kind
of a game."
But Walton says the gutsy move has
opened doors for him.
"These are issues that I follow any
way and I care deeply about, so I would
talk about them anyway," he says.

"[Running for governor] just gives me a
platform to talk to a lot more people."
Walton is publicizing his views
through the media, even appearing on
the Game Show Network program,
"Who Wants to Be Governor of Cali
fornia?: The Debating Game." On
Oct. 7, Walton will fly to Los Angeles
to vie for the grand prize as a finalist
on the show: a $21,200 contribution to
the political treasure trove of the win
ner's choice.
But Walton faces stiffer competi
tion in the recall election than on the
game show. He may have a chance at
winning the grand prize on "Who
Wants," but most people, including
Political Science Prof. Morris Fiorina,
peg his chances of victory at the polling
booths as slim-to-none.
"It's unusual for even three [candi
dates] to remain in a race," says Fiorina.
"The problem is when there are more
than two candidates running, if you're
supporting the third candidate it makes
you think 'l'm wasting my vote.'"
Nguyen, the freshman, says he'd be
less likely to vote for a candidate who
seemed like a long shot.
"If I agreed with [a student's plat
foipi] and I thought they had a decent
chance of winning, I would vote for a
student," Nguyen says. "I'm pretty
practical and I'd rather [vote for] some
one who could win with whom I sort of

agree, than someone I totally dis
agree with."
Would-be candidates needed to
supply $3,500 and 65 signatures to
gain a place on the ballot. These min
imal requirements attracted an array
of aspiring politicians, including
many without previous experience,
such as Walton.
"Having lots of candidates is
both a good thing and a bad thing,"
says Nguyen. "It's good in that
more people are participating in
our democracy. On the other hand,
it's also a bad thing because it's
total chaos you can't have a de
bate with 135 people."
Fiorina says the candidates have
quite varied motives.
"Some of these people are doing it
to make a statement, some of them

just want to make sure a position is
enunciated, some of them were just
painfully sincere, and others were just
frivolous candidates," says Fiorina.
"It is amazing that there are that
many people willing to put up that
much money."
Fiorina does not consider Walton
a likely winner of the race. When
asked about his chances, Fiorina
steered the conversation to talk about
other leading candidates.
But Walton refuses to be daunted
by the long-shot odds.
In coming to the Farm after grad
uate work in France, Walton follows
in the footsteps of his father, who at
tended Stanford Law School. The
younger Walton, who has begun his
studies at the Graduate School of
Business, plans to later apply to a doc
toral program in political science.
Walton says that he aspires to
combine academic research with
public service. But despite his early
foray into politics, Walton insists that,
for now, his number-one priority is

academics.
"This is the first time in my life that
I've ever had the opportunity to be
just a student I've always been a
basketball player as well," he says. "I
finally get to concentrate just on
school." At least after the election is
over with.
For now, he sees himself as a role
model to young politicians.
"I think the students of America,
for one reason or another, have lost
their voice," Walton says. "In the na
tional political scene, people don't re
ally worry about what the students
are going to do or say."
"When you're young, you don't
have any money so you have no
power," says Walton. "So really the
only thing you have is your voice and
your vote, and that's what needs to be
heard."
Walton believes that students
should look beyond scholastic en
deavors and take on active roles in
politics. "Rock the boat," Walton
says. "Change the world."
