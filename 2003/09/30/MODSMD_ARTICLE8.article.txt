## Vandalism mars public space 
### 
Last week, 24 punctured bike tires were
found at Arrillaga Sports Center and
students discovered that several of
their bikes had been damaged in Es
condido Village. Inter-dorm rivalry caused
damage in Branner. Even a lime became a
weapon when pitched through a window of the
French House, resulting in broken glass and
hundreds of dollars in damage. Vandalism has
become a serious problem on campus.
These incidents highlight a disturbing trend of
increased disrespect for University property and
for the property of other students. According to
the Stanford Department of Public Safety, not
only does the vandalism rate appear to have in
creased since last year, but the seriousness of de
structive crimes on campus is also growing. In the
ninth month of this year, incidences of vandalism
have already exceeded the number of such
crimes reported in all of last year. Furthermore,
recent incidents have been as extreme as the de
struction of two century-old stone urns that for
merly adorned the front of the Quad.
These cases of vandalism are not petty
pranks, but displays of blatant aggression direct
ed against campus property. Regardless of
whether the perpetrators of these crimes are
Stanford students or members of the local com
munity, their behavior reflects an alarming lack
of respect for the space we all share. While there

is a time and a place for practical jokes, when
that mischief results in permanent or costly dam
age to University property or to the possessions
of other students, it becomes a serious crime
with real financial repercussions.
Students pay enough to attend this school
without needing to cover the costs of replacing
broken windows and vandalized bikes. Damage
inflicted on Stanford property ultimately hurts
the student body. Members of the University
community should recognize the value that
Stanford facilities contribute to this community,
and should refrain from senseless violence that
hinders the school's ability to serve its purpose.
Authorities recommend that if individuals
witness an act of vandalism on campus, they
should report it immediately to campus securi
ty. We wholeheartedly endorse this recom
mendation. Waiting several hours or even days
to notify the police about vandalism makes it
nearly impossible to hold the appropriate per
son responsible, leaves the campus less beauti
ful and adds an unnecessary burden to the
costs students shoulder.
Stanford belongs to all of us, and if we do not
act as responsible stewards of our community,
who will? The University is a place of learning,
work and residence for thousands vandalism
not only hurts the University's pocketbook, but
is a symbolic blow to Stanford pride.
