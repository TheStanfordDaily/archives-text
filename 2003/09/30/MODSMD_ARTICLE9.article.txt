# Internet access should be free
## 
### 
In the past few years, the Internet has be
come a major thread in the fabric of aca
demic life at Stanford. Professors re
quire students to keep in touch via e
mail, to download articles off the Web and to
stay abreast of current events on-line. For that
reason, 97 percent of Stanford students decide
to set up an Ethernet connection in their
rooms for quick and convenient access.
But along with all the other incidental costs
of living on campus, students are forced to pay
a $lO monthly fee for in-room Ethernet con
nections. At many state schools, there is no such
charge. We believe that this basic service should
also be free at Stanford.
Students shouldn't be forced to take on an ad
ditional financial burden for a tool that has be
come a necessity for communication and re
search. A fast connection to the Internet is an in
valuable resource for dedicated and diligent stu
dents. Students cannot be expected to rely solely
upon the sometimes far away and crowded com
puter clusters for access, particularly when they
could have a connection in their very own rooms.
Residential Computing's Web site touts the
service as far cheaper than it would be off-cam
pus, noting students get a connection 1,800
times faster than most Internet service
providers offer for less than half the price. The

Web site also boasts that there is no activation
charge for this "great value."
Rich Holeton, head of Residential Comput
ing, said that with the fee, "students get a lot of
bang for that buck." He added that the revenue
constitutes 40 percent of the Residential Com
puting's budget and students would probably
have to pay the fee one way or another, even if it
were in the form of increased tuition or housing
costs. The money has to come from somewhere,
he argued. Nonetheless, he said he understood
students' frustration over what he called "the
most universal service on campus," but he
thought it stemmed from the fact that the fee is
now a line-item on the telecommunications bill,
and not absorbed into some other charge.
Separate bill or not, an Ethernet connection
is not a luxury like cable TV; it is as indispens
able to student life as water or other basic utili
ties. Why isn't the connection included — as
other essentials are — in the cost of campus
dorm rooms or apartments?
University officials should recognize the crit
ical need for students to have trouble-free In
ternet access, and this charge should be re
moved: It is both misplaced and onerous. Inter
net access is a requirement: Should the Univer
sity put a price tag on everything students need
to perform well in class?
