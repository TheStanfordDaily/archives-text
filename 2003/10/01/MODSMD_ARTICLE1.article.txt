# Jackson to speak at rally
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
Rev. Jesse Jackson will speak against Propo
sition 54 at noon today in a White Plaza rally
sponsored by the Stanford Coalition to Stop
Prop. 54.
Proposition 54, which will be decided by Cal
ifornia voters on Oct. 7, prohibits state and local
governments from classifying people by race,
ethnicity, color or national origin in public edu
cation, contracting and employment operations,
with some exceptions.
Jackson will speak about the ramifications of
Proposition 54 for students, explained junior
Hunter Hargraves, a member of the coalition.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni will introduce Jackson. The rally will
also feature a spoken-word performance.
Jackson's background of addressing access to
education, health care issues and the elimination
of social inequities qualifies him to speak against
Proposition 54, Hargraves said.
"We hope that with a speaker with a big name
who is knowledgeable and an advocate on civil
rights issues, students will think, 'He's someone
I respect and admire,' and will come to the rally
and then be persuaded to vote against Prop. 54,"
Hargraves said.
Jackson is coming as part of his tour of north
ern California college campuses, which also in
cludes stops at San Jose State and UC-Berkeley.
The purpose of the rally, according to Har
graves, is to educate students about the ramifi
cations if Proposition 54 is passed.
"There are plenty of undergrads and grad
students, but mostly undergrads, who don't
know what Prop. 54 is," Hargraves said. "We
want to educate the Stanford community about
what will happen if Prop. 54 passes and what the
consequences are related to health care, educa
tion, hate crimes and employment."
The coalition organizing the rally is com
posed of several student groups. Other coalition
actions so far include literature drops and the
distribution of postcards and flyers around cam
pus.
