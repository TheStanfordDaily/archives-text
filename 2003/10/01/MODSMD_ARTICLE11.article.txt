## Giant flowers and the latest in science and tech 
### AMIT GARG SENIOR STAFF WRITER Dark matter hits the fan 
Galaxies: more than meet the eye. A new
study of galaxies that orbit other galaxies
found they are bound by dark matter, little
understood type of invisible matter. The as
tronomers concluded that this is true because
orbit and mass are related and the orbits
studied required there to be more mass than
observed.
These results support further the theory
that most of the Universe is invisible. As
tronomers believe that only four percent of
the Universe is observable matter, like the
stuff that you and I are made of, 23 percent is
dark matter and the rest is of the even more
mysterious dark energy.
This study "is important because it is a di
rect measurement of some of the properties
predicted for dark matter," said Anatoly
Klypin, a scientist who works at New Mexico
State University.
Germans really are flower children
Bonn University in Germany claims to
have cultivated the tallest flower ever. Titan
Arums (Amophophallus titanium) are found
naturally in the rain forests of Western Suma
tra and flower once every two or three years.
The Bonn scientists were able to grow a 274
centimeter flower weighing 78 kilograms, sur
passing the previous record of 267 centimeters
which was set in 1932 in the Netherlands.
In 2000, this Titan Arum flowered at 257
centimeters and over 15,000 people visited it
during the year. Oh, one small detail: Titan
Arums release a pungent odor of decaying
fish when they bloom.
Didn't these guys see T3?
The next step in computing may be self
healing computers, according to Armando
Fox and David Patterson, professors of Com
puter Science at Stanford and Berkeley, re
spectively. Current machines are bigger and
faster than previous ones but they are still rid
dled by unreliability and are extremely com
plex. In simple terms no matter how good a
computer is, it can still crash.
Scientists are experimenting with high-de
pendability computers, which would have
powerful recovery systems. These would in
clude undo functions to recognize and reverse
human mistakes and benchmarking programs
that would evaluate and stabilize system per
formance. Fox and Patterson believe that ei
ther additional automation or better design
will allow today's computers to become as re
liable as users expect in the near future.
Human brains should be more
like chickens'
Scientists have gained new insights into the
causes of human deafness and balance disor
ders by studying the inner ear of chickens. In
humans the loss of sensory cells in the inner ear
is the leading cause of deafness and impaired
balance and can stem from aging, infectious
disease and loud noises. The team studied over
1,800 genes in the cochlea (where sound is con
verted into nerve impulses) and the uticle
(where balance is sensed). In birds the uticle
grows cells regularly while the cochlea re
places them when they die, but humans are un
able to regrow these cells.
"Ultimately, we hope our work will lead to
some form of therapy that will replace these
cells when they are lost," says lead investigator
Michael Lovett, professor of genetics and of
pediatrics and joint director of the Division of
Human Genetics.
Dumbed down for electrical engineers
Japanese researchers have built a new type
of transistor that is transparent and ten times
faster than previous designs. The transistor is
made from a single-crystal thin-film oxide su
perconductor. Translation: it is a single crystal
sheet made of an oxide (metal + oxygen) and is
superconducting (poses little friction to elec
tron flow).
The transistor is currently too expensive to
manufacture but is a step forward in optoelec
tronics (transmitting electric signals using
light). Besides, the circuit is transparent
how much cooler can you get?
Good prank ideas
Have you eaten asparagus and then had a
very pungent urine experience? Well, turns
out 40 percent of the people have a gene that
breaks down compounds in asparagus into
pungent molecules.
Asparagus is of the same family as garlic
and onion and is supercharged with vitamins
and minerals, It also possess a sulfur-contain
ing compound known as methyl mercaptan
the same stuff that causes skunks to smell like,
well, skunks. Those people having the mercap
tan gene break the compound into six sul
furous computes that land in the urine. If you
happen to be one of those people, there is no
health risk of eating asparagus but now you
know where the smell comes from.
