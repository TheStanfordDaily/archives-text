# CELLULAR SHUFFLE
## Navigating the world ofcellular service providers 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Hunched over your Human Biology
midterm, you hear only the soft rustling of
blue books, perhaps the occasional cough.
Suddenly, your ears are assaulted by a tinny
rendition of "Material Girl" coming from the
front pocket of a backpack nearby. The red
faced owner of the bag scrambles to switch
off his cell phone. This is a typical scene and
sure-fire sign of Stanford's rapidly growing
cellular culture.
Cell phones on bikes and on hikes, for
meetings and greetings in class, at home,
day or night they came, they saw, they con
quered. People are connected 24 hours a day,
and for students on the go it has become an ab
solute necessity.
"I have my phone with my all the time,"
says sophomore Richard Vaughn. "I don't
even wear my watch anymore."
As if constant communication weren't
enough, cellular kingpins AT&T, Cingular
and Verizon tease trendy college kids with ear
and eye candy combined. Polyphonic ring
tones, sparkly faceplates, voice-ring activa
tion, camera phones. Are they unnecessary
frills, or just darn good marketing tools?
AT&T seems to be the frontrunner on the
Stanford campus. Most popular by far, the
company provides the best, affordable service,
students say.
"I chose AT&T because I liked the cell
phone I got, they have great coverage on cam
pus and locally, I got a good deal on the na
tional plan and it got decent reviews from
friends," says junior Nancy Wu, who signed up
for 500 anytime minutes and unlimited nights
and weekends. "I think carrying it around ev
erywhere is more for convenience's sake
nowadays, not really trendiness."
Stanford has teamed with AT&T to offer
students better rates and to consolidate their
payments by adding cellular fees to the same
bill as students' other communication
charges.
"I pay about $l5 a month for free nights
and weekends," says Vaughn, who uses the
Stanford AT&T service. "Any other time is 11
cents a minute, and I think there are some free
mobile-to-mobile minutes, like 450 per month
or something."
Students can sign up for this service
through Forsythe at any time during the year,
and Stanford will even put wireless lines on
hold so that subscribers won't be billed over
the summer.
The favorable location of a AT&T store on
El Camino Real, adjacent to the University,
might also explain widespread use of cell
phone company on campus. Most students
who decide to get a phone once they arrive on
campus will choose a company in close prox
imity to Stanford. The Cingular Wireless table
in front of the bookstore also plays on stu
dents' need to sign up for service and get a
phone fast.
Cingular is likely the queen to AT&T's
king. While many students complain about the
service's poor reception in dorm rooms, it

seems to fit the needs of the campus population just as well.
"I've almost never had a problem not getting reception
if it's a place where other people still have service," says
sophomore Colleen Ferrand-Andrew whose plan in
cludes 350 daytime minutes and 3,500 minutes during
nights and weekends. "We shopped around a lot before I
came out here and Cingular seemed to have good cover
age in this area."
Sprint and Verizon, the jacks of our cellular kingdom,

are not nearly as popular on campus even though students
who use these companies say they offer the same quality of
service as their competitors.
"Around Baltimore, Verizon is much more popular and
it has noticeably better coverage, but I think Verizon is con
centrated more on the east coast," says co-terminal student
Morris Cohen.
So who is the joker in this game of five-card stud? That
dubious honor goes to T-Mobile, notorious for its bad re

ception ... everywhere.
"Catherine [Zeta-Jones] is pretty hot,
so I thought I would sign up with T-Mobile.
The only problem is that I can't use the
phone in my dorm. And that makes me very
sad," said a junior who asked to remain
anonymous to avoid waking up to a horse
head in his bed.
Freshmen who arrived for school with
out a cell will likely realize how crucial
quick and easy communication is once they
become more involved in clubs and organi
zations or when they're struggling to fin
ish Math 51 problem sets at 4 a.m. without a
study buddy.
Unlimited nights and weekends have
become the savior of many a Stanford stu
dent. In class all day during the week, it's
Friday and Saturday evenings when the
campus network hums to life. Trying to
scrape together a pre-party? Don't know
what to wear downtown? Lost your girl
friend in the Sigma Chi crowd? The power
is yours if your packing your cell.
For students hailing from the East coast
and beyond, nighttime plans aren't so con
venient with the 3-hour time difference.
"The only problem with my phone is
that because of the time change, my night
time minutes start when it's midnight at
home," says Ferrand-Andrew, a resident of
Maryland. "Although, Cingular does have
this new offer that could possibly let my
nighttime minutes start at 7 instead of 9 p.m.
I think I'll look into that."
While some Stanford students seem to
have their Nokias and Motorolas glued to
their hips, others remain skeptical.
"I can't afford a cell, and even if I could
I don't need one," sophomore Afex
Rivas, who appears to live a normal and
happy, although cell phone-free life. "I
think if you need to constantly get in touch
with people, they are a good idea, but for
me, there are plenty of other modes of com
munication that work just fine. It just seems
like more of a luxury than a necessity."
For two years, junior James Huffman
was of the same mind as Rivas, successfully
dodging the cellular craze. Yet with piling re
sponsibilities, he says he's finally given in, an
other soul gone wireless.
"I really hate cell phones but they're
just too necessary," Huffman says, referring
to them as electronic leashes. "I see people
biking with them, and then of course I think
people are talking to me when really they
are just talking into a phone. They are gen
erally overused."
So why'd he crack?
"I've run into situations lately where
I've needed to coordinate with people, plus
I'm on staff for band so I need to be fairly
accessible," he says. "Also, I've got a girl
friend in the city, and I want to be able to
contact her easily."
Huffman plans to sign up for 350 any
time minutes and unlimited nights and
weekends with AT&T. While he was tempt
ed to go for the exorbitant mp3 playing
phone, he says he will settle for polyphonic

ringtones to get a better price.
When it comes to the future of cellular on campus,
there's really no debate. Phones are guaranteed to get'
smaller and sleeker. A larger variety of rings will be respon
sible for cutting off professors during lectures and large cel
lular companies will try harder to win students over.
Cell phones have provided students with greater inde
pendence, more autonomy and a both a sense of maturity
and authority. No wires attached.
