# The
						hot answer to all your lava lamp questions

### BONTTA SONG ANSWER GIRL 
QHey Answer Dudette, I wanna
pimp up my room, so I wanna get
a lava lamp ... so I mean, I was
wondering, I wanna know how
>. Yeah.
A Well, "lava" lamps, also known
as liquid motion lamps, are
filled with two immiscible liq
uids of similar densities. Or, in
your world, "dude," that means there's like,
two kinds of lava inside the lamp that don't
get along: Like, there's all this stiff-necked,
hodad lava that sits around at the bottom,
and then like, a chill, peace-loving type

that's surfin' on the top.
You see, when the
lava lamp is plugged in, an
incandescent light bulb
on the bottom of the lamp
lights up and heats the
denser liquid sitting on
the bottom. This heating
makes the liquid expand

and become less dense, creating a so-called
"buoyant forces," which pushes it upward
through the less dense liquid. Once the hot
liquid is at the top, away from the light bulb,
it cools and contracts, the other liquid
now better exposed to the bulb heats
and expands. Eventually the densities
switch off again and as a result, so do the liq
uids, at which point the cycle starts all over.

If you didn't understand that, dude,
here's another explanation one I
thought of just for you. See, there's actual
ly this bitchin' midget volcano inside the
lamp that blasts real lava when you plug it
in. The makers of lava lamps hafta boogie
all over the world to be able to find these
volcanoes for bottling, man, but as you
can see it's worth it.... I'm not just
jerking you off, either. If you look close
enough, you can see tiny (but babe-a-li
cious) virgins being thrown in when the
volcano erupts. Really. You just have to
look close. Real, real, close.
Oh, and you have to be high, too.
At any rate, the general process of mov
ing fluid around by heating and cooling it,
i.e., "convective circulation," plays a part

in all kinds of natural processes, not just
the movement of blobs in lava lamps. For
instance, atmospheric convection con
tributes to weather patterns, and the activ
ity of convective cells within the Earth's
mantle may be why the tectonic plates
and by extension, continents move.
Lava lamps, weather patterns ... it's all
connected. I know what you're thinking,
and I agree: Whoa, deep.

If YOU have any questions that need an
swering, you can email me at

please know that the pinkness and the flow
ers and the big ass question mark surround
ing my face on my mug both this week
and last were NOT my idea.
