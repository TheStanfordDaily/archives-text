## Law School should join suit 
### 
Ast week a coalition of law schools and
L legal scholars filed suit in federal court
over the government's enforcement of
the Solomon Amendment, claiming that
it violated law schools' First Amendment rights
to academic freedom. This law requires law
schools, including Stanford, to let military re
cruiters participate in their hiring programs de
spite the fact that these employers adhere to the
"don't ask, don't tell" philosophy, meaning that
they will not hire known homosexuals despite
their merit or ability.
The government has enforced this law by
threatening to withdraw many sources of feder
al funding from universities whose law schools
refuse to comply. Last year it was estimated that
Stanford stood to lose more than $7OO million a
year if the Law School did not obey the Solomon
Amendment. Despite the fact that Stanford
Law School requires all its other employers to
meet a strict non-discrimination policy, it has
been forced to allow military recruiters to come
to campus for the last two years.
With the announcement of the lawsuit this
week, it seemed there was finally an avenue for
Stanford Law School to fight back against gov
ernment threats that forced it to accept re
cruiters who violated its diversity policies.
Sadly, neither the Law School nor the Univer
sity as a whole has joined the lawsuit. If the
Law School really does want to ensure "that
our educational commitment to evaluate stu
dents only on the basis of merit" extends to its
employers as Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
law school, said in a letter to students last year
it should have been one of the first institu
tions supporting this lawsuit.

As any good lawyer would advise, consistency
of process is an important aspect of fairness. Al
lowing military recruiters to bypass regulations
while all other employers are forced to adhere to
them is not good for Stanford, its students or the
public's perception of the University.
When employers participate in University
organized recruitment, there is a mark of accep
tance and approbation attached to that organi
zation. The University should do everything it
can to remove this perceived approval from em
ployers who use discriminatory hiring practices,
including the military. If we really do support the
ideals of diversity and judging people based on
merit, we should literally put our money where
our mouth is and join this lawsuit.
The government claims that its enforce
ment of the Solomon Amendment is necessary
because our military organizations need the
best and brightest employees they can get, in
cluding lawyers. This statement is undoubted
ly true, and therefore it is incomprehensible
that the military would instantly preclude hir
ing from any portion of the population based
on a factor like sexual orientation.
The methods that the government uses to en
force this law are suspect. By threatening to cut
off funding, they hold entire universities hostage
over policies that may or may not agree with
each educational institutions' philosophy.
We recommend that Stanford join the law
suit. As University officials have touted the
value of diversity in the past, now is the time for
them to demonstrate their commitment to it.
Not succumbing to governmental pressure
would be a real indication of the University's
stance in regard to non-discrimination.
