# Islam grant boosts awareness
## 
### 
he University announced last week that
Tit has received a $9 million grant for a
new professorship and program in Is
lamic studies. Lectures, classes, re
search and an honors program will all be creat
ed with money from donations by Sohaib and
Sara Abbasi, Lysbeth Warren, and the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
We applaud this move to expose scholarly
discourse on Islam. Since the tragedy of 9 /11,
American and Western interest in Islam has
increased dramatically. Yet to date, the sup
ply of Stanford classes pertaining to Islam and
the Islamic world has not met student de
mand. The History and Political Science de
partments although they sought to offer
more courses in this popular field were un
able to absorb all the interest students had in
Islamic studies.
Before 9/11, Stanford offered fewer regular
classes on Islam-related topics. What few class
es were offered frequently examined Islam
from a Western perspective, analyzing how
Islam affects and conflicts with the Western
world. Too few classes looked at Islam as an en
tity in and of itself. The Islamic religion, which
is practiced by one-fourth of the world's popu
lation, has long merited its own field of study.

This new endowment will give students a
chance to explore a large geographical and in
tellectual area previously underserved. As part
of the new endowment, a professorship in the
Religious Studies department, along with a pos
sible second professorship in an outside depart
ment pertaining to Islam, will deepen the schol
arly research on Islam at Stanford. And an hon
ors program will give students the chance to
focus their studies on this important topic.
While we agree that the grant is beneficial to
the University, it is only one step towards a
greater understanding of Islam. The $9 million
donation will not fully meet the demand, nor will
it meet the necessity, of scholarly work on Islam
ic studies. We hope that the University will attract
more donations and reallocate some internal
funds to add more professorships in the field.
There is currently no major in Islamic stud
ies. We hope that the honors program can even
tually evolve into a program that rewards un
dergraduate and graduate degrees.
We also hope that support for Islamic stud
ies doesn't cap at $9 million. More money is
needed. We can no longer encourage an explo
ration of Islam within the framework of a "clash
of civilizations," but we must view it as a culture
worthy of its own exploration.
