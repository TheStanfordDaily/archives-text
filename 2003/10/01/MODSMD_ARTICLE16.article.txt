## NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER Is Stanford full of wusses? 
### 
7- ou got Stanford
kids comin' to your
T program? Man,
-JL. good luck with
them I heard they're a bunch of
whiners and moaners."
Yes, my friends, such were the
words spoken by some Harvard pro
fessor to one of our charismatic Aus
tralian professors a few weeks before
we flew into Australia. When we ar
rived, he simply couldn't believe the
words were true; after all, we were all
quite easy-going and high-spirited.
We happily hopped onto the buses
and couldn't wait to start our classes.
Snorkeling for class? Hiking as a field
activity? Sign us up!
And then he assigned the group
presentations. And the 3,000 word
paper, to be researched and com
pleted in two days. Together, they
were worth 80 percent of our grade
for the class.
You would have thought that a
group of baby pigs had been let loose
on the island, there was so much
squealing and complaining buzzing
around. So we grumbled and mum
bled unmentionable things under our
breaths, then buckled down and start
ed our work. We stared longingly at
the outside world, dreaming of the
beaches we had seen only a few days
earlier, with waters brimming with
dolphins, whales, turtles and surfers.
Instead, we had to turn back to
our laptop screens, fight off sleep
and the need to scream, and absorb
ourselves with our work. We met up
in the kitchen for our tea breaks,
complaining away about the course.
No wonder our professor probably
thought we were a big bunch of com
plaining babies.

Then came the straw that broke
the kangaroo's back: the grading sys
tem that would be used to evaluate
our work. Apparently in Australia,
they don't believe in the wonderful,
cushy system we have come to love at
Stanford called grade inflation.
No, our professor told us, not ev
eryone can get an "A." In fact, if you
complete an adequate job, you can

hopefully get a "C," and if you man
age to get above average, you can
cheerfully accept a "B."
All hell broke loose. "What about
my precious med school applica
tions?" some of us screamed. "How
am I going to get into law school with
a bunch of 'C's on my transcript?"
others cried out.
That night, the phone lines were
busy as our perplexed Australian pro

fessors spoke to
the folks back at
Stanford. "Don't
worry," they told
us in the morning.
"Your grades will
be 'adjusted' to
Stanford standards
at the end of the
course." So we set
tled down, relaxed
a bit and went

back to being the mellow Stanford
students we pretended to be in the
first place.
But this experience left me think
ing. Honestly, I don't think we're
much worse than our Harvard chums
in terms of expecting not good, but
excellent grades. But at the same
time, this highlights a significant
problem with the elite, top-notch uni
versity system in the United States.
All through high school, we scored
the 4.0 GPAs and dominated Ad
vanced Placement and Honors class
es. When we moved to Stanford, some
of us mellowed out (Pre-med? Nope,
not for us, a few said) and some of us
were still caught in the rat race of the
higher education system. But even if
you didn't want to be a doctor or a
lawyer, there was always the prospect
of graduate school. And with the de
pressed economy, the idea of more
school after Stanford seemed to be
getting more and more enticing. What
better way to delay getting into the
real world and then (hopefully!) be
more successful after completion.
But along with all of these dreams
of adding extra initials to your degree
was the stark reality: You still needed
to keep those grades in the over

achiever level. OK, perhaps attaining
the 4.0 was no longer a possibility
every quarter, but you were still keep
ing it up in the 3.7 level. And when the
class became difficult, you did one of
three things: dropped the class, said
good-bye to your social life and
vowed to become best friends with
your textbooks, or complained.
So now we come to this sad reali
ty. What has become of us? Are we
all a bunch of wusses that we can't
deal with a couple of "below-par"
grades? Could that awful statement
made by the professor from that
"other" university in the East Coast
really be true?
It's not our fault, you say. The top
graduate / law / medical / business
schools demand the best grades, and
if we want to get those fat envelopes
filled with acceptance letters, we have
to go along with the system.
I'm not saying that I'm above all
of this. Heck, I want to go to gradu
ate school, and it would be nice to go
back to Stanford with some decent
marks, but I do recognize that some
thing isn't right with the way that
grades are handed out back in the
States. Aside from some technical
classes where the grades are not
curved and the raw test scores are
used, many Stanford classes are
curved in all sorts of interesting
ways. In many fuzzy classes, profes
sors are really limited in the grades
they can hand out: If the paper is de
cent, they can work within the mar
gin of an A-minus to a B-plus in
order to avoid massive complaints.
I'm not sure I can offer an elegant
and happy solution to this problem,
but at least I hope I've sparked the
same kind of thought I had with a few
of you that something has gone
haywire with this grade system. And
maybe we can all try not to freak out
when a "B" or "C" appears on our
transcript. Well, just as long as we still
do better than those Harvard wusses.
