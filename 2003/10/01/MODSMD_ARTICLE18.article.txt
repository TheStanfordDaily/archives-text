Shurgard Responds
I wanted to respond to last week's article
about Shurgard Storage To Go ("Shur?
Unsur," Sept. 23).
While we do everything that we can to
provide the best customer service experi
ence, unfortunately things do fall through
the cracks, and when that happens, we are
truly sorry. Like in any business, our cus
tomer satisfaction is not always going to be
100 percent. With the intent to do an even
better job for our Stanford customers year
to year, we solicited feedback from our
Stanford customers that rented during the
2002 summer, to gauge their overall cus
tomer satisfaction. The response was that
97 percent said that they would store with us
again, and were happy with their service.
In regards to the students that were men
tioned in the article, Neepa Acharya, Aman
da Schwartz, Tom Feulner, and William
Woodward, Shurgard Storage To Go had al
ready offered to refund the $395 they paid
for their summer rental, before the article
was published. In addition, we offered to re
imburse students for items they may have
needed until their storage was redelivered
and happily provided them free storage for
next summer.

I greatly appreciate the relationship
we've had with our Stanford customers over
the years, and I want to assure them that we
have learned a lot from their feedback. We
will continue to strive to offer the best ser
vice for our Stanford customers, and look
forward to serving you again in the future.

Fool's experiment a waste of time?
This letter is in response to Helen Kim's
sidebar ("Fool's Experiment," Sept. 29).
Well, Kim's article detailed just that: a fool
ish experiment; one that shouldn't have been
written, let alone published in The Daily.
As the saying goes: Ask a stupid question,
and get a stupid answer. Put up a stupid, face
tious, overtly sexual profile dwelling on
nothing but your "watermelons" and get
stupid, facetious, overtly sexual responses
revolving around bosoms.
Ms. Kim, I'm sorry you never received a
response that read: "Despite your heaving
chest and profile laden with sexual innuendo,
I am not a superficial person, and really wish
to know what lies beneath your melons and
would like to get to know you as a person."

After all, the way you typed "Move b—"
really makes me think that you must have a
great personality.
The Internet objectifies women, but make
no mistake about it, no one objectified
women in Kim's experiment: Kim objectified
herself. It makes me a bit sick to my stomach
to read about such a biased experiment whose
sole point is to show that people, given the
right circumstances, can be superficial.
What a waste of space and of my time. I
think I'm going to spend the rest of the day
not being unreasonably cynical.

Cross Country runners speak out
In her column last Friday ("Get Your
Own Perks," Sept. 26), Julie Ruvolo assert
ed that: "Yes, some athletes do regularly get
propositioned for group sex, and no, the
cross countryTunners aren't those 'some.' "
To single out the cross country team as
somehow inadequate for the purposes of
multiple-partner intercourse is inappropri
ate and simply preposterous. It is common
knowledge that many other varsity teams,
such as golf, sailing and men's water polo,

must also forgo orgiastic pleasures of the
flesh in the name of dedication to their cho
sen sport. We hope Ms. Ruvolo will check
her facts more thoroughly before writing
similar statements in the future.

I was sincerely offended by Julie Ruvo
lo's suggestion in her Friday column ("Get
Your Own Perks," Sept. 26) that the mem
bers of Stanford cross country do not get
propositioned for group sex, while other
athletes do.
That is absolutely NOT true! I am a for
mer member of "The Machine" (as the
Cross Country team is known far and wide),
and I have certainly been propositioned for
group sex on many occasions.
Of course, I was really a middle distance
runner and sprinter and not a true cross
country guy. And, yes, most of the proposi
tions have came after I stopped running my
junior year. Come to think of it, I didn't get
any propositions until then ... and I really
have no idea if the other cross country guys

get those kinds of requests.
Hmm ... could Julie be right after all?

Education Editorial overlooks
use of classroom funds
The Daily's Editorial ("California's school
crisis," Sept. 26) on the education crisis in Cali
fornia overlooks the low proportions of dollars
spent that actually make it into the classroom.
This is one of the most salient pieces of in
formation that shows the structural problems
facing public education, not just in California
but across the country. Throwing more money
at the problem isn't going to solve it. Cutting
budgets will hurt because the bureaucrats will
not cut themselves. They will just cut the
amount of money that goes into the classrooms.
As long as there is federal, state and local
micromanagement of public schools through
an overabundance of programs, and as long
as teachers' unions insist on tenure-based
pay scales rather than merit-based scales,
public education will continue to fail.

runner and sprinter and not a true cross
country guy. And, yes, most of the proposi
tions have came after I stopped running my
junior year. Come to think of it, I didn't get
any propositions until then ... and I really
have no idea if the other cross country guys

get those kinds of requests.
Hmm ... could Julie be right after all?

Education Editorial overlooks
use of classroom funds
The Daily's Editorial ("California's school
crisis," Sept. 26) on the education crisis in Cali
fornia overlooks the low proportions of dollars
spent that actually make it into the classroom.
This is one of the most salient pieces of in
formation that shows the structural problems
facing public education, not just in California
but across the country. Throwing more money
at the problem isn't going to solve it. Cutting
budgets will hurt because the bureaucrats will
not cut themselves. They will just cut the
amount of money that goes into the classrooms.
As long as there is federal, state and local
micromanagement of public schools through
an overabundance of programs, and as long
as teachers' unions insist on tenure-based
pay scales rather than merit-based scales,
public education will continue to fail.

Shurgard Responds
I wanted to respond to last week's article
about Shurgard Storage To Go ("Shur?
Unsur," Sept. 23).
While we do everything that we can to
provide the best customer service experi
ence, unfortunately things do fall through
the cracks, and when that happens, we are
truly sorry. Like in any business, our cus
tomer satisfaction is not always going to be
100 percent. With the intent to do an even
better job for our Stanford customers year
to year, we solicited feedback from our
Stanford customers that rented during the
2002 summer, to gauge their overall cus
tomer satisfaction. The response was that
97 percent said that they would store with us
again, and were happy with their service.
In regards to the students that were men
tioned in the article, Neepa Acharya, Aman
da Schwartz, Tom Feulner, and William
Woodward, Shurgard Storage To Go had al
ready offered to refund the $395 they paid
for their summer rental, before the article
was published. In addition, we offered to re
imburse students for items they may have
needed until their storage was redelivered
and happily provided them free storage for
next summer.

I greatly appreciate the relationship
we've had with our Stanford customers over
the years, and I want to assure them that we
have learned a lot from their feedback. We
will continue to strive to offer the best ser
vice for our Stanford customers, and look
forward to serving you again in the future.

Fool's experiment a waste of time?
This letter is in response to Helen Kim's
sidebar ("Fool's Experiment," Sept. 29).
Well, Kim's article detailed just that: a fool
ish experiment; one that shouldn't have been
written, let alone published in The Daily.
As the saying goes: Ask a stupid question,
and get a stupid answer. Put up a stupid, face
tious, overtly sexual profile dwelling on
nothing but your "watermelons" and get
stupid, facetious, overtly sexual responses
revolving around bosoms.
Ms. Kim, I'm sorry you never received a
response that read: "Despite your heaving
chest and profile laden with sexual innuendo,
I am not a superficial person, and really wish
to know what lies beneath your melons and
would like to get to know you as a person."

After all, the way you typed "Move b—"
really makes me think that you must have a
great personality.
The Internet objectifies women, but make
no mistake about it, no one objectified
women in Kim's experiment: Kim objectified
herself. It makes me a bit sick to my stomach
to read about such a biased experiment whose
sole point is to show that people, given the
right circumstances, can be superficial.
What a waste of space and of my time. I
think I'm going to spend the rest of the day
not being unreasonably cynical.

Cross Country runners speak out
In her column last Friday ("Get Your
Own Perks," Sept. 26), Julie Ruvolo assert
ed that: "Yes, some athletes do regularly get
propositioned for group sex, and no, the
cross countryTunners aren't those 'some.' "
To single out the cross country team as
somehow inadequate for the purposes of
multiple-partner intercourse is inappropri
ate and simply preposterous. It is common
knowledge that many other varsity teams,
such as golf, sailing and men's water polo,

must also forgo orgiastic pleasures of the
flesh in the name of dedication to their cho
sen sport. We hope Ms. Ruvolo will check
her facts more thoroughly before writing
similar statements in the future.

I was sincerely offended by Julie Ruvo
lo's suggestion in her Friday column ("Get
Your Own Perks," Sept. 26) that the mem
bers of Stanford cross country do not get
propositioned for group sex, while other
athletes do.
That is absolutely NOT true! I am a for
mer member of "The Machine" (as the
Cross Country team is known far and wide),
and I have certainly been propositioned for
group sex on many occasions.
Of course, I was really a middle distance
runner and sprinter and not a true cross
country guy. And, yes, most of the proposi
tions have came after I stopped running my
junior year. Come to think of it, I didn't get
any propositions until then ... and I really
have no idea if the other cross country guys

get those kinds of requests.
