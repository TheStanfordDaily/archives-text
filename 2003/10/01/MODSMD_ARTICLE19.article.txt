## Is Kobe your hero? 
### 
Alanis Morissette could learn a lot
about irony from the Kobe Bryant
sexual assault case. Kobe's former
Sprite commercial used the slogan,
"Image is nothing, thirst is everything, obey
your thirst" to create an image for its product.
Endorsers once paid $2O million per year for
Kobe's glistening image. Is there enough of
that image left to save Kobe Bryant?
It could count for everything as the jury
decides whom to believe the alleged vic
tim or Kobe Bryant, the self-proclaimed
victim.
The defense is already trying to dig up
information that might damage the alleged
victim's credibility while simultaneously
crafting an image of Bryant as an innocent
victim of racism and his own fame.
Sadly, irony seems to be lost on Kobe.
When news broke of the sexual assault al
legations against him, he told reporters
from the Los Angeles Times:
"When everything comes clean, it will all
be fine, you'll see. But you guys know me, I

shouldn't have to say any
thing. You know I would
never do something like
that."
What do we really
know about you, Kobe?
We know that many of
your teammates consider
you to be aloof and arro
gant and that none of them
have exactly rushed to
your defense. And now we
know that you had sex with

a 19-year-old hotel clerk within two hours of
arriving in Eagle County, Colorado the night
before knee surgery. So we should take your
word for it?
Part of the problem, of course, is that
fans and the media bestow moral virtue on
professional athletes that is largely unmer
ited. By the standards of the NBA, good
looks and a modicum of eloquence are all it
takes to create a pristine and immensely
saleable-image.
Instead of admiring athletes for the
crimes they haven't committed, we should
admire those who contribute concrete acts
of generosity David Robinson, for ex
ample, who donated $9 million to found a
school in San Antonio; or Dikembe Mu
tombo who is raising $l4 million to build a
hospital in Africa.
"I don't believe professional athletes
should be role models," Charles Barkley
once said, "I believe parents should be role
models."
How true. But then don't pretend to be a
role model, Kobe. You can't have your cake
and eat it, too. You can't make upwards of
$2O million dollars a year in endorsements
based on your family-guy image and com
mit adultery. You can't buy your wife with a
$4 million diamond. Or can you?
But why should we expect Kobe to have
a sense of irony? Irony is defined by Merri
am Webster as "incongruity between the
actual result of a sequence of events and
the normal or expected result." As a pam
pered and idolized athlete, Kobe has never
had to face the consequences of his actions.
He makes an estimated $32 million a
year in salary and endorsements simply be
cause he happens to be good at putting a
ball through a hoop.
Fans idolize him, reporters beg for his
time, all because he happens to be a very
good basketball player. A friend even ar
gued to me that Kobe should not be held
responsible for what happened because he
probably figured, (correctly?), that any
woman would be delighted to have sex
with him. Is Kobe that confused about the
difference between image and reality?
Clearly many fans also have trouble
making this distinction. The main website
supporting Kobe Bryant, Free Kobe.com,
has the slogan "because we're running out
of heroes."
This is what we've come to?
In the absence of real heroes, we should
just make them up? Or even worse idol
ize a false hero? Is image all we crave?
Doesn't it matter to us whether the image
is true or false?
At the Teen Choice Awards, Kobe de
clared that, "an injustice anywhere is an in
justice everywhere."
He was trying to quote Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s famous line, "Injustice any
where is a threat to justice everywhere."
Forget the meaning lost in Kobe's trans
lation. What is he, some kind of martyr for
adulterous NBA players?
To compare his own situation to that of
Martin Luther King, Jr. displays a shocking
degree of arrogance even for Kobe. Clear
ly, he and his lawyers are trying to recast
Kobe as the victim of racism.
But playing the race card for a famous
American who makes almost $lO million a
year more than the entire Eagle County Dis
trict Attorney's budget, and whose image
and celebrity will likely help him in court, is
insulting to the many real victims of racism.
Is America too stupid to tell the differ
ence between Martin Luther King, Jr. and
Kobe Bryant?
Are we running that short of heroes?

once said, "I believe parents should be role
models."
How true. But then don't pretend to be a
role model, Kobe. You can't have your cake
and eat it, too. You can't make upwards of
$2O million dollars a year in endorsements
based on your family-guy image and com
mit adultery. You can't buy your wife with a
$4 million diamond. Or can you?
But why should we expect Kobe to have
a sense of irony? Irony is defined by Merri
am Webster as "incongruity between the
actual result of a sequence of events and
the normal or expected result." As a pam
pered and idolized athlete, Kobe has never
had to face the consequences of his actions.
He makes an estimated $32 million a
year in salary and endorsements simply be
cause he happens to be good at putting a
ball through a hoop.
Fans idolize him, reporters beg for his
time, all because he happens to be a very
good basketball player. A friend even ar
gued to me that Kobe should not be held
responsible for what happened because he
probably figured, (correctly?), that any
woman would be delighted to have sex
with him. Is Kobe that confused about the
difference between image and reality?
Clearly many fans also have trouble
making this distinction. The main website
supporting Kobe Bryant, Free Kobe.com,
has the slogan "because we're running out
of heroes."
This is what we've come to?
In the absence of real heroes, we should
just make them up? Or even worse idol
ize a false hero? Is image all we crave?
Doesn't it matter to us whether the image
is true or false?
At the Teen Choice Awards, Kobe de
clared that, "an injustice anywhere is an in
justice everywhere."
He was trying to quote Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s famous line, "Injustice any
where is a threat to justice everywhere."
Forget the meaning lost in Kobe's trans
lation. What is he, some kind of martyr for
adulterous NBA players?
To compare his own situation to that of
Martin Luther King, Jr. displays a shocking
degree of arrogance even for Kobe. Clear
ly, he and his lawyers are trying to recast
Kobe as the victim of racism.
But playing the race card for a famous
American who makes almost $lO million a
year more than the entire Eagle County Dis
trict Attorney's budget, and whose image
and celebrity will likely help him in court, is
insulting to the many real victims of racism.
Is America too stupid to tell the differ
ence between Martin Luther King, Jr. and
Kobe Bryant?
Are we running that short of heroes?
