# Liquor-laden Long's opens
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
A new Long's Drugs store, with a complete al
coholic beverage section, opened at the Palo Alto
Town and Country Village Shopping Center in Au
gust, just one month before Stanford put three of its
row houses on alcohol probation and renamed "Se
nior Pub Night" as "Senior Night."
The shopping center is located across the street
from both Stanford and Palo Alto High School, but
Long's representative Phyllis Prosser says the store
has been as stringent as possible in checking IDs to
prevent underage drinking.
"Our rules are pretty good in terms of sales of
alcohol and tobacco other than checking [a stu
dent's] ID, I can't imagine what else we could do
whether we are near a campus or not," she said. "I
think our policies are very responsible."
During a transaction involving alcohol, "we
have to require a valid ID," Prosser said. "A valid
ID means it's issued by a government agency, it has
their name, birth date and photo and has not ex
pired. In California, if using a driver's license, we
can actually swipe the card, so if that person is not
21 or over, we void the sale."
There are no laws prohibiting businesses that
neighbor schools from selling alcohol, although the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control
(ABC) may deny a business a retail license if it is
within at least 600 feet of schools, public play
grounds or nonprofit youth facilities. According to
the ABC, mere proximity is not sufficient reason to
deny the license; generally, ABC will deny a license
"when there is evidence that normal operation of
the licensed premises will be contrary to public wel
fare and morals."
"I don't think students are more likely to buy al
cohol when it's that close to campus," said senior
Chuck Armstrong. "If they sold alcohol at Tresid
der, that would be one thing, but going off campus
is going to be a substantial enough trip anyway that
you may as well drive three to five more minutes to
get to Ernie's (a liquor store)."
Though the Town and Country Long's has been
open for over a month, few students seem to be
aware of it or to even associate the store with the

sale of alcohol.
"I didn't even know that Long's sells alcohol,"
said Armstrong. "I go to Ernie's because Shibu [the
proprietor] knows me by my first name. To an ex
tent, distance has very little, if not nothing to do
with where students go to buy alcohol."
Students' association of certain stores to alcohol
has so far been of little concern to Stanford admin
istrators.
"We've not had a formal relationship with
stores like Ernie's or Long's," said Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni. "If we have infor

mation that there's been a problem with them sell
ing to underage students, we would contact them to
express our concern about it."
According to Stanford Chief of Police Laura
Wilson, it is unlikely that a store like Long's would
sell alcohol to minors.
"In order to maintain a business license to serve
or sell alcohol you need to follow certain rules or
regulations, and if you fail you could lose your li
cense and lose your ability to sell your alcohol,
which I imagine would be a large loss of revenue,"
she said.
