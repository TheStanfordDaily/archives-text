# NEW COACH IN TOWN
## Ratcliffe takes charge of Cardinal 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
You may not be able to
say that Paul Ratcliffe's
climb up the ranks of
women's collegiate soccer was
altogether planned, but there's
absolutely no denying that he
has been successful.
He took the helm of one of
the nation's elite collegiate pro
grams this year, becoming the
Stanford women's soccer
team's fourth head coach in
three years. Ratcliffe replaced
co-head coaches Paul Sapsford
and Stephanie Erickson, who
led the team last year on an in
terim basis after the resignation
of long-time head coach Andy
Nelson.
Getting his coaching start at
his alma mater, UCLA, Rat
cliffe's first job was more of an
assignment than a career
choice.
After playing four years
for the Bruins, he still needed
one more year to finish up his
degree.
"Because I didn't redshirt, I
needed something to do during
my fifth year," Ratcliffe said.
"That year also happened to be
the first year UCLA had a
women's program. So instead
of helping out with the men's
team, I was able to take a larger
role with the women's team and
I became assistant coach to Joy
Fawcett who they had brought
in from the National Team."
Following his graduation
from UCLA, Ratcliffe didn't
stick with coaching, but he did
stick with the game of soccer,
choosing to join the Los Ange
les United and later the Ana
heim Splash of the now non-ex
istent Continental Indoor Soc
cer League.
"I think that's one of the
things that sets me apart as a
coach," Ratcliffe said. "I have an
undying passion for the game...
I think it rubs off on others."
The termination of the CISL
and an invitation from his former
players brought Ratcliffe right
back into coaching. He spent
1994-97 as an assistant with the
Bruins, getting his first taste of
head coaching experience in 1996
when he served as interim head
coach for the women's team from
January through August.
Ratcliffe left Southern Cali

fornia for the Bay Area in 1998
when he took over the St.
Mary's program. Under his
leadership, the Gaels compiled
a 55-34-7 record and in 2001, it
was catapulted to a No. 7 na
tional ranking, its highest ever.
While Ratcliffe's base of
operations has moved only
about 20 miles, he is currently
worlds away from his former
home. Among the challenges
facing the new coach are
countless injuries to his play
ers, including a devastating
season ending foot-injury to
forward Marcie Ward.
Ward was Stanford's main
scoring option before the in
jury. The senior notched 10
goals last season, second only to
Cardinal alum Marcia Wallis
who was also named Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Year.
Ratcliffe faces the added
pressure of leading a team
that has made the playoffs in
twelve of its last 13 years.
Stanford is also coming off an
NCAA Quarterfinal appear
ance.
Clearly, winning is expected.
Ratcliffe's transition was a bit
rocky as the Cardinal lost two
of its first three matches, scor
ing only one goal during that
time period. While frustrating,
the losses did not change Rat
cliffe's approach to coaching
the team.
"What I try to do is get play
ers to concentrate on taking ad
vantage of their strengths," he
said. "It has been a process fig
uring out exactly what each
players strengths are. That's
why it has been so great having
Stephanie [Erickson] around.
She knows the players better
than anyone because she's been
here the longest. Especially for
the little things like knowing
how a player is going to react to
being played man-to-man, she
has been amazing."
It seems as if Ratcliffe's ap
proach is starting to come togeth
er. Since its opening struggles,
the Cardinal has gone 4-1-1, with
its lone loss coming just two days
after a match where Stanford
played through two overtime pe
riods, battling intense heat and
the No. 2 team in the nation,
Notre Dame.
Additionally, Ratcliffe
seems to be getting the offense
back on track. The team ex
ploded for six goals against
San Francisco last week.
"The offense has been the
biggest challenge of the year,"
Ratcliffe said. "The problems
are mostly due to injuries, but
we are sorting [them] out and
things are starting to look really
good for this year."
