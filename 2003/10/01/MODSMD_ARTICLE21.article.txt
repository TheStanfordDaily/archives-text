USA Track & Field has
named Stanford women's
cross country coach Dena
Evans as one of four
coaches who will lead the USA Na
tional Team this season.

Although she was recently pro
moted to the position of head
women's cross country coach this

alum, is by no means a new face on
Stanford's campus.

squad, she earned three NCAA Ail-
American certificates and successfully
qualified for the 1996 U.S. Olympic
Trials in the 1,500 meters. Since win
ning an NCAA Post-Graduate Schol
arship in 1996, Evans received a mas
ter's from Stanford and then went on
to work for four years as an assistant
coach for the Cardinal.
In her time here on the Farm, Evans
has lead the Stanford women's cross
country team to four consecutive Pacif
ic 10 Conference and NCAA West Re
gional women's team titles, including

four top-5 finishes at the NCAA Cross
Country Championships.
She will join a coaching staff that
includes Arkansas head coach Lance
Harter, Mark Wetmore from Col
orado University and Rhode Island's
Mike Scott.
