# Man hypnotizes female victims
## 
### KRISTIN BARRETT DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) Police continue to investigate
incidents involving several Northwestern Uni
versity students who allege they were hypno
tized and, in at least one case, sexually assault
ed in the University library.
University librarian David Bishop said no
changes in security have been made at the li
brary since the last reported incident two
months ago, but University Police say they have
increased patrols there.
"I'm not sure that I could say that anything is
being done in response to this," Bishop said.
A female victim reported to police that on
July 22 a man hypnotized her after asking her to
help with a research project. He then "spoke to
and touched the victim in an inappropriate
manner," according to a UP community crime
alert.
Police knew of one or two similar incidents
prior to the assault this summer, although the
events might not be related, said Daniel
McAleer, UP assistant chief.

Junior Sarah Bush said in an interview that
she was studying in the library's third floor
stacks during Winter Quarter when a man
asked her to participate in a psychology study
and led her to a secluded room. She answered
his questions and then he said he was going to
try "relaxation techniques" on her. Bush woke
from what she later realized was probably hyp
nosis when she became aware he was asking her
to lie down on the floor, she said.
"He led me to a classroom and we sat down
and he closed the door," Bush said. "I had never
seen anyone be hypnotized before, which is
probably why I fell for it."
When she awoke, she told him she felt un
comfortable and began to leave, but he at
tempted to block the door and to persuade her
to stay. When she insisted on leaving, he re
lented, Bush said.
Bush said she hadn't planned to file a police
report, but she realized how bizarre the incident
had been after talking with friends. She filed the
report and also sent out a mass e-mail warning
people of what had happened.
"It's so outlandish and you feel kind of fool

ish," Bush said, speculating that others might
have had similar experiences but not reported
them. "It seems like this has happened enough -
that this is not a one-time thing."
Bush said she generally feels safe on campus
and around the city.
"Maybe some things at the library might
need to be changed," Bush said. "I don't think
of it as a scary place, but a really demented per
son is using our library as a place to do this."
Hypnosis can be strong enough to overpow
er someone during a sexual assault, but only for
less than five percent of the population, said
Deirdre Barrett, a psychology professor at Har
vard Medical School who specializes in hypno
sis.
Barrett said some crimes, including at least
two murders, have been linked to suggestions
given under hypnosis, but normally such hypno
sis only exists in fictional settings such as
movies.
McAleer urged students to be cautious.
"If you don't feel comfortable, trust your in
stincts," he said. "Don't follow someone in a se
cluded area."
