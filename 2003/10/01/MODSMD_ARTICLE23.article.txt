# White House shields Rove from allegations
## 
### WILLIAM DOUGLAS KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS 
WASHINGTON (KRT) â€”The
White House vehemently denied
Monday that Karl Rove, the presi
dent's top political strategist, exposed
the classified identity of a CIA officer
who is married to a key critic of the ad
ministration's Iraq policy.
Democrats called for an indepen
dent investigation to look into the pos
sibility that a federal crime was com
mitted. Administration officials insist
ed that their own questioning of Rove
and their cooperation with a Justice
Department investigation would be
sufficient.
Revealing the name of CLA under
cover operative is a federal crime, and
doing so could end the career of the
agent and endanger that person and
others who have contact with him or her.
Conservative columnist Robert
Novak reported in July, citing two se
nior administration officials, that the
wife of former Airfbassador Joseph C.
Wilson was a CIA official.
Wilson has accused Rove of leak
ing the information about his wife to
the press, although he backed off from
that claim on Monday. Instead, he said
the White House condoned revealing
his wife's identity as revenge for his
debunking a claim made in Bush's
State of the Union address that Iraq
had tried to purchase yellowcake ura

nium from the African nation of
Niger. Bush's claim supported the ad
ministration's case for going to war
against Iraq.
White House officials said Monday
they would not conduct an internal in
quiry into the claims by Wilson.
Rove "wasn't involved," White
House Press Secretary Scott McClel
lan said. "The president knows he
wasn't involved... It's simply not true."
The flap over Wilson's allegation is
the latest and sharpest example of the
increasingly bitter in-fighting among
key members of Bush's team. The
Bush administration once prided itself
on its ability to stymie the press with a
disciplined, leak-proof front.
But during the past year there has
been conflict pitting the Defense De
partment's civilian leaders and Vice
President Dick Cheney on one side
against the State Department and the
CIA on the other over the wisest ways
to conduct foreign policy. The dispute
is now expanded by the CIA inviting
the Justice Department to investigate
the White House staff over a possible
leak rooted in disputes over Iraq policy.
"There has been nothing that has
been brought to our attention beyond
what we've seen in the media reports
that suggests that there was White
House involvement," McClellan said.
"No one was authorized to do this.
That is simply not the way this White
House operates."
