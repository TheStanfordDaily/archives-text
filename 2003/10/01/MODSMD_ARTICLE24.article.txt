# Death of 18-year-old girl raises RU-486 questions
## 
### PAUNIE SAMRETH DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) Three years ago, RU-486 or
simply "the abortion pill" was approved for
use in the United States by the Food and Drug
Administration despite much controversy and
debate over its safety.
Now, the recent death of an 18-year-old woman
from the San Francisco Bay area has again raised
questions about the drug.
Holly Patterson visited a Planned Parenthood
clinic in Hayward, CA, where she was administered
the pill. Two days later, she took a second set of pills
at home, as prescribed by the clinician.
Patterson experienced severe cramps and bleed
ing, and was rushed to the hospital by her boyfriend.
She was given pain-killers and sent home.
A few days later, Patterson returned to the hos
pital and died from septic shock caused by frag
ments of the fetus left inside her uterus.
Whether or not her death was caused by the pills
cannot be determined until an autopsy is completed.
According to Danco Laboratories, the drug's

manufacturer, RU-486 which is sold in the Unit
ed States under the name Mifeprex has been
used over 200,000 times since it was first approved.
Worldwide, the pill has been used by over a mil
lion women.
Two women died after taking the pill in the Unit
ed States, though the FDA is unclear on whether
their deaths were caused by the pill.
Neither Mifeprex nor any other type of abortion
procedure are available at the Arthur Ashe Student
Health and Wellness Center at UCLA.
"We aren't geared to do things like that," said Ann
Brooks, nurse manager at the center.
The center does, however, provide information
including referrals to students who are pregnant.
Students are sometimes referred to UCLA-affil
iated doctors, but the procedure is not done at the
UCLA Medical Center because abortions are usu
ally in-office procedures that don't require hospital
ization, Brooks said.
Clinics that administer Mifeprex are located in
areas close to UCLA, including some in Santa
Monica.
For most students, the decision to terminate a

pregnancy is a difficult one to make.
Some options discussed include keeping the
child, adoption, or ending the pregnancy by either
surgical termination or medical termination, which
is the function of RUAB6.
Most women feel there may be too much cramp
ing and bleeding involved with taking the abortion
pill, Brooks said.
"There are not too many students who go that
route," Brooks said.
Recently, students who were interested in RU
-486 but could not afford it were referred to a study
at USC that focused on the effectiveness of miso
prostol alone.
Misoprostol is usually given to patients after tak
ing RU-486. It is a prostaglandin, which is a sub
stance made naturally by the lining of the womb dur
ing menstruation that causes the contraction of the
uterus.
Previous studies using only misoprostol showed
that it successfully ended a pregnancy when admin
istered every 24 hours for three doses.
"There were no complications in our study," said
Dr. Antonia Nicosia, a clinical instructor at USC.
