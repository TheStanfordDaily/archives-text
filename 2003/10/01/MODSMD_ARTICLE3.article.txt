# Student launches dining protest
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students often gripe about the
price and restrictions of Stanford Dining
meal plans. Now, freshman Andrea Run
yan is campaigning for change. This week,
Runyan sent out an e-mail to the Roble
Hall chat list calling for a campus-wide pe
tition against mandatory dining plans along
with other forms of protest, calling Stan
ford Dining a "monopoly" with high prices
and inefficient management.
In addition to the petition, she also pro
posed a boycott of the dining halls and a
campaign to get students to switch en
masse to the least expensive meal plan.
So far, Runyan has received significant
support from others in her dorm.
"I know that the meal plan is very con
venient for some people, but I don't think
it's right to make them mandatory," Run
yan said. "It's very difficult to get out of
having to purchase a meal plan, and I think
it's unfair for me to pay for meals that I
don't eat because I might have a class or
other commitment that conflicts with the
dining hall's hours."
Instead of eating in the dining hall, Run
yan prefers to go to the grocery store and
cook for herself in one of her dorm's kitch
enettes.
According to Nadeem Siddiqui, the ex
ecutive director of Stanford Dining, he and
his staff are constantly working to make ad
justments in response to student sugges
tions. This fall, Stanford Dining introduced
several large-scale changes, including a 10-
meals-per-week dining option. In addition,
it also extended hours at Stern's Cyber Cafe
to include Friday nights from 10 p.m. to 2
a.m. Finally, dining halls around campus
now offer more ethnic food choices, and a
multi-million dollar renovation of the
Tresidder dining area is scheduled to open
later this month.
"We started a dining committee last
year to work with students and to get feed
back about the program," Siddiqui said.
"The concept of this committee is to review
the policy, including the costs and flexibili
ty of the program and to come up with new
options."
Though the committee developed the
smaller 10-meals-per-week plan, many stu
dents are adamant in their protests against
having to purchase a meal plan at all. Runyan
sent out her e-mail against required meal
plans just days after the school year began.

While Siddiqui understands that some
students might initially see the mandatory
meal plans as pricey and unfair, he said he
believes in the "living and learning" fos
tered by the Residential Education pro
gram. According to Siddiqui, meals are an
important part of Res Ed, and once stu
dents know how and why Stanford Dining
operates, they might better understand why
meal plans are required.
"When people eat.together as a commu
nity, they form friendships," Siddiqui said.
"Food brings students together from Day
One, and it is a wonderful way to take
learning to the next level around the dining
room table. Students become extremely
connected, and this provides them with a
support system."
A common complaint among students is
that they do not eat $4,000 worth of food
each year.

Siddiqui countered that Stanford's
prices are competitive with those at other
major universities. Cornell University
charges $4,450 per year for unlimited
meals, while Stanford Dining charges
$4,348 for a similar, though not unlimited,
plan.
Siddiqui says prices are higher at Stan
ford than in many other areas because the
Bay Area has one of the highest costs of liv
ing in the nation.
But meal plans at Santa Clara Universi
ty, also located in the Bay Area, are still
cheaper than those at Stanford. Santa Clara
charges $3,435 a year for 13 to 14 meals per
week, while the same number of meals
costs $4,149 at Stanford.
"The cost of the meal plan also has to in
corporate the costs of running the dining
halls and not just the food," Siddiqui said.
"The challenge is that we have to set up a

baseline. Whether students come to the
dining hall or not, it is open. Part of what
students pay for is to make sure that it can
be open and to provide stability for the pro
gram."
Other costs built into the price of a meal
plan include paying employees and main
taining and updating facilities, Siddiqui
says. An additional challenge to keeping
prices low is that Stanford operates many
smaller dining halls that feed a few hundred
students, while many other universities op
erate only one or two larger dining halls.
"We pay our staff very well; they are in
volved in a union and they receive bene
fits," Siddiqui said. "We have a tough mar
ket, and it is important to us to pay our em
ployees well so that they are interested in
the job and want to do a good job."

Though some students are pleased with dining hall fare, freshman Andrea Runyan started a petition against Stanford Dining's current
meal plan structure.
Runyan agrees with Siddiqui that
workers should receive competitive
wages. She also does not want to see
any layoffs in the dining staff if she
successfully follows through with
her plan.
"I think it's wonderful that we
pay workers the living wage, but
there are many other places on cam
pus to eat that pay workers similar
wages and where the prices are
much more reasonable," Runyan
said. "The system is begging to be
fixed."
In fact, many on-campus restau
rants are more costly than Stanford
Dining. For example, a 12-ounce
fountain soda costs 85 cents at
Wilbur and $1 at Olives Cafe. A
bowl of soup at Wilbur sets students
back $1.50; at Olives, it costs $2.95.
Although Runyan's campaign
has received positive attention in
her dorm, several students respond-

Ed to her e-mails with supportive
words for Stanford Dining. One stu
dent, freshman Jeremy Newman,
addressed the complaints in a two
page email.
"I find that our situation is not
bad at all and certainly not a source
of outrage," Newman said. "We
have the opportunity to eat healthy,
balanced meals every daV."
Newman pointed out that while
Runyan's suggestion of a dorm-wide
boycott of the dining hall sounded
good, it would be impractical to
cook food for 310 people in Roble's
small kitchenette.
Meanwhile, Siddiqui says he
knows well the difficulties of making
hungry students happy, ajid he en
courages Runyan and others to
bring him their complaints.
"I love to hear from students," he
said. "We are always looking for
new ideas and concepts.' Students
have been very open and involved in
the changes that we have made to
the dining system, and it sfiould be
that way."

"We pay our staff very well; they are in
volved in a union and they receive bene
fits," Siddiqui said. "We have a tough mar
ket, and it is important to us to pay our em
ployees well so that they are interested in
the job and want to do a good job."

Though some students are pleased with dining hall fare, freshman Andrea Runyan started a petition against Stanford Dining's current
meal plan structure.
Runyan agrees with Siddiqui that
workers should receive competitive
wages. She also does not want to see
any layoffs in the dining staff if she
successfully follows through with
her plan.
"I think it's wonderful that we
pay workers the living wage, but
there are many other places on cam
pus to eat that pay workers similar
wages and where the prices are
much more reasonable," Runyan
said. "The system is begging to be
fixed."
In fact, many on-campus restau
rants are more costly than Stanford
Dining. For example, a 12-ounce
fountain soda costs 85 cents at
Wilbur and $1 at Olives Cafe. A
bowl of soup at Wilbur sets students
back $1.50; at Olives, it costs $2.95.
Although Runyan's campaign
has received positive attention in
her dorm, several students respond-

Ed to her e-mails with supportive
words for Stanford Dining. One stu
dent, freshman Jeremy Newman,
addressed the complaints in a two
page email.
"I find that our situation is not
bad at all and certainly not a source
of outrage," Newman said. "We
have the opportunity to eat healthy,
balanced meals every daV."
Newman pointed out that while
Runyan's suggestion of a dorm-wide
boycott of the dining hall sounded
good, it would be impractical to
cook food for 310 people in Roble's
small kitchenette.
Meanwhile, Siddiqui says he
knows well the difficulties of making
hungry students happy, ajid he en
courages Runyan and others to
bring him their complaints.
"I love to hear from students," he
said. "We are always looking for
new ideas and concepts.' Students
have been very open and involved in
the changes that we have made to
the dining system, and it sfiould be
that way."
Stanford students often gripe about the
price and restrictions of Stanford Dining
meal plans. Now, freshman Andrea Run
yan is campaigning for change. This week,
Runyan sent out an e-mail to the Roble
Hall chat list calling for a campus-wide pe
tition against mandatory dining plans along
with other forms of protest, calling Stan
ford Dining a "monopoly" with high prices
and inefficient management.
In addition to the petition, she also pro
posed a boycott of the dining halls and a
campaign to get students to switch en
masse to the least expensive meal plan.
So far, Runyan has received significant
support from others in her dorm.
"I know that the meal plan is very con
venient for some people, but I don't think
it's right to make them mandatory," Run
yan said. "It's very difficult to get out of
having to purchase a meal plan, and I think
it's unfair for me to pay for meals that I
don't eat because I might have a class or
other commitment that conflicts with the
dining hall's hours."
Instead of eating in the dining hall, Run
yan prefers to go to the grocery store and
cook for herself in one of her dorm's kitch
enettes.
According to Nadeem Siddiqui, the ex
ecutive director of Stanford Dining, he and
his staff are constantly working to make ad
justments in response to student sugges
tions. This fall, Stanford Dining introduced
several large-scale changes, including a 10-
meals-per-week dining option. In addition,
it also extended hours at Stern's Cyber Cafe
to include Friday nights from 10 p.m. to 2
a.m. Finally, dining halls around campus
now offer more ethnic food choices, and a
multi-million dollar renovation of the
Tresidder dining area is scheduled to open
later this month.
"We started a dining committee last
year to work with students and to get feed
back about the program," Siddiqui said.
"The concept of this committee is to review
the policy, including the costs and flexibili
ty of the program and to come up with new
options."
Though the committee developed the
smaller 10-meals-per-week plan, many stu
dents are adamant in their protests against
having to purchase a meal plan at all. Runyan
sent out her e-mail against required meal
plans just days after the school year began.

While Siddiqui understands that some
students might initially see the mandatory
meal plans as pricey and unfair, he said he
believes in the "living and learning" fos
tered by the Residential Education pro
gram. According to Siddiqui, meals are an
important part of Res Ed, and once stu
dents know how and why Stanford Dining
operates, they might better understand why
meal plans are required.
"When people eat.together as a commu
nity, they form friendships," Siddiqui said.
"Food brings students together from Day
One, and it is a wonderful way to take
learning to the next level around the dining
room table. Students become extremely
connected, and this provides them with a
support system."
A common complaint among students is
that they do not eat $4,000 worth of food
each year.

Siddiqui countered that Stanford's
prices are competitive with those at other
major universities. Cornell University
charges $4,450 per year for unlimited
meals, while Stanford Dining charges
$4,348 for a similar, though not unlimited,
plan.
Siddiqui says prices are higher at Stan
ford than in many other areas because the
Bay Area has one of the highest costs of liv
ing in the nation.
But meal plans at Santa Clara Universi
ty, also located in the Bay Area, are still
cheaper than those at Stanford. Santa Clara
charges $3,435 a year for 13 to 14 meals per
week, while the same number of meals
costs $4,149 at Stanford.
"The cost of the meal plan also has to in
corporate the costs of running the dining
halls and not just the food," Siddiqui said.
"The challenge is that we have to set up a

baseline. Whether students come to the
dining hall or not, it is open. Part of what
students pay for is to make sure that it can
be open and to provide stability for the pro
gram."
Other costs built into the price of a meal
plan include paying employees and main
taining and updating facilities, Siddiqui
says. An additional challenge to keeping
prices low is that Stanford operates many
smaller dining halls that feed a few hundred
students, while many other universities op
erate only one or two larger dining halls.
"We pay our staff very well; they are in
volved in a union and they receive bene
fits," Siddiqui said. "We have a tough mar
ket, and it is important to us to pay our em
ployees well so that they are interested in
the job and want to do a good job."
