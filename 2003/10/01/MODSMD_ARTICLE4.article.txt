# Frosh kicked out of Roble for party
## 
### VAUHENI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Freshman Donny Bridges has
been kicked out of Roble Hall
after throwing parties last week
end where fellow freshmen were
served and sold alcohol.
Bridges, who has appealed
Residential Education's decision
to revoke his housing for the rest
of the year, has spent the past four
nights in a Lagunita single as he
awaits a decision on the appeal.
The Daily has learned that Di
rector of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo gave Bridges in
formal permission yesterday to
return to Roble in the next few
days, but Bridges must first sign a

contract promising to follow Stan
ford's residence agreement and
receive permission to move back
in to Roble from Jamila Saudi, the
residence dean for Roble, Flo
rence Moore Hall and Lagunita
Court. He also expects to be asked
to receive counseling.
If Bridges receives permission
to return, he will be under close
watch by the University.
"It's my last chance," he said.
"If I do anything else, I'm booted."
Bridges threw parties on Fri
day and Saturday nights after buy
ing about $l5O worth of alcohol in
Las Vegas. When some freshmen
decided to leave the Saturday night
party early, they offered to pay
Bridges for some alcohol, which they
took with them, he says. Other stu
dents left the party with alcohol
without paying him.
On Monday, Bridges heard that
e-mails about the incident had been
circulating among administrators.

By the time the e-mail reached
Saudi, the residence dean, Bridges
said, "it portrayed me as a cartel, a
liquor store."
Bridges decided to approach
Saudi, the residence dean, to discuss
what had happened and "try to alle
viate rumors," he said.
In that meeting, Saudi called the
incident an "egregious violation,"
said Bridges, who was told he had vi
olated the University's policies on
drinking and possession, distribu
tion and sale of alcohol. Bridges says
he believes the latter accusation was

"greatly misconstrued."
Bridges threw two parties on Fri
day and Saturday nights and also
played some drinking games on Sun
day.
"If that was grounds for expelling
people from housing, there wouldn't
be many freshmen left," he said.
Still, he recognizes that he dis
obeyed University policy.
"The law is the law," he said. "I
screwed up. Now I'm dealing with
the consequences."
The Daily will report further on
this story as it unfolds.
