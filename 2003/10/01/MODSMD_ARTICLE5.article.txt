# Financial aid plan changed
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the University tightens its
belt due to budget cuts, students
receiving financial aid have
been asked to contribute more
of their own money toward
funding their educations.
This year, financial aid stu
dents will see the first increase in
their loans and work-study
obligation, otherwise known as
self-help expectations, since
1997. Every Stanford student
receiving aid will now have to
raise an additional $750 through
campus employment and loans.

The changes are not tempo
rary.
"These changes were made
necessary because of the in
creased demand for financial
aid and the economic challenges
facing the University," said As
sociate Dean of Financial Aid
Earl Dowling. "Until the econo
my really turns around, and
families and Stanford are not
coping with the same or similar
financial challenges of the past
two years, I would have to say
these are not short-term fixes."
In spite of economic set
backs, Stanford says it is still commit
ted to its need-blind admissions policy,
granting students scholarships in
keeping with the financial aid office's
long-standing tradition of making ed
ucation accessible to every academi
cally qualified student.
In addition, the office does not
foresee a decrease in the $47 million
given last year as grants from endow
ment and institutional sources for fi
nancial aid.
"The way we determined the ex
pected contribution from parents did
not change from previous years,"
Dowling said. "As in previous years,
some families will notice a change in
the parent contribution due to a shift
in family income, a change in house
hold size or other factors."
Some students feel they are being
unjustly punished for the universi
ty's financial aid troubles. Sopho
more Ratul Narain said his expected
work contribution was raised to a
ridiculous bar.
"I'm sure they're not out to cheat
me, but every dollar that I earned the
past summer was put as my work
study for the year," Narain said. "It's
almost like, if I didn't earn that
money, I would have been rewarded
in the long run."
For other students on financial
aid, the added burden may not be as

bothersome.
"I found it fairly easy to find a job
that will pay for my work study,"
sophomore Tom Feulner said. "I just
feel bad for those students who might
not have enough time to devote to the
sort of commitment that work entails,
detracting from their studies and ex
tracurricular."

The financial aid office maintains
that it is doing everything in its power
to accommodate students' needs as
generously as possible.
"I would want students to know
that every effort was made to mini
mize the impact of these changes for
them and their families," Dowling
said.
