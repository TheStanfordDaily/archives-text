# ASSU holds first meeting
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Debate over whether or not to
support a bill endorsing the Stan
ford Coalition Against Proposition
54 dominated discussion last night
at the ASSU Senate meeting, even
tually ending in a narrow defeat for
the Coalition. The bill's passage,
which would have required a 2/3
majority, garnered seven votes in
favor and four against.
The bill would not have endorsed
a condemnation against the measure
itself, but would instead have given
the ASSU's support for the existence
and activities of the Coalition.
"We've written this bill to en
dorse the Coalition Against Propo
sition 54," said sophomore Alyssa
Schwartz, co-chair of the appropri
ations committee and co-author of
the bill. "We don't feel that we are
endorsing Proposition 54 either pro
or con, against it or for it."
Instead, Schwartz saw the bill as
an opportunity to give ASSU sup
port to general political activism
on-campus.
"We want to encourage the entire
student body to be active political
ly," she said. "This is the first exam
ple we've seen this year that we've
noticed to be actively engaging."
An array of activists from both
sides of the issue showed up to the
meeting, including two members of
the Stanford College Republicans
and two spokespersons from the
Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice (SCPJ).
Sophomore Joanna Fiduccia,
one of the members of SCPJ pre
sent, argued that the proposition
had serious ramifications for re
search at the University.

"If Proposition 54 was passed, it
would place serious limits on our
ability to do research in the state of
California," she said. "As students,
as part of this community, I think
it's important that we don't want
this to happen."
Former ASSU President Moni
ca Henestroza • agreed with these
sentiments.
"The fastest growing major on
campus is Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity," she said. "But
as you can guess, a lot of the research
that Stanford students want to do
may be closed off to them in the fu
ture [if the proposition were to pass]."
Intense debate roiled around
the fundamental question of how
political the ASSU Senate should
be.
"If our role is to stay neutral," said
junior Alex Moore, a senator, "we
probably shouldn't be doing this."
"The thing that troubles me about
this bill is that it endorses an espe
cially political group," said sopho
more Bob Sensenbrenner, vice
president of the College Republi
cans. "This sets a dangerous prece
dent because it polarizes the cam
pus. What happens if you endorse
one side of the issue and not the
other?"
Kiyomi Burchill, a sophomore
member of the Coalition, saw the
passage of the bill as an essential act
to retain the legitimacy of the
ASSU.
"I see this as a very clear-cut
issue where dozens of students
around campus have come together
to work against this proposition,"
she said. "I think as senators you
owe it to us, your student body, to
take this as an issue as to whether
you really represent the student

voice."
Burchill also stressed the fact
that ASSU endorsement would be
helpful to the Coalition in obtain
ing a $3OO grant to put on a bal
anced debate about the Proposi
tion.
Junior Joe Fairbanks, the presi
dent of the College Republicans,
argued that the 1000-member
strong Coalition For Proposition 54
should receive a similar endorse
ment if the bill were to pass.
"This bill is going to show everyone
that, yes, [the Senate is] against 54,
even if this is not what you are in
tending to do," he said.
In response, an amendment was
proposed that would have made the
bill an endorsement of both the
Coalition Against and the Coali
tion For Proposition 54. The
amendment failed in a vote of 4 to
8.
The ASSU also unanimously ap
proved a $5400 request to improve
the common space, an area in
Storke Publications building open
to all student publications.
As for bureaucratic measures, se
nior Eleanor Williams, the outgoing
Elections Commissioner, stressed
the need to start the hiring process
for a new commissioner early.
"Basically the elections commis
sioner is responsible for making
sure the elections happen in accor
dance with University policy," she
said.
The meeting ended with Senate
Chair Josh Shipp's reminder that
applications for Executive Aids
and Senate Associates are due Fri
day and available at
http://assu.stanford.edu. The posi
tions are open to freshmen and
transfer students.

ment if the bill were to pass.
"This bill is going to show everyone
that, yes, [the Senate is] against 54,
even if this is not what you are in
tending to do," he said.
In response, an amendment was
proposed that would have made the
bill an endorsement of both the
Coalition Against and the Coali
tion For Proposition 54. The
amendment failed in a vote of 4 to
8.
The ASSU also unanimously ap
proved a $5400 request to improve
the common space, an area in
Storke Publications building open
to all student publications.
As for bureaucratic measures, se
nior Eleanor Williams, the outgoing
Elections Commissioner, stressed
the need to start the hiring process
for a new commissioner early.
"Basically the elections commis
sioner is responsible for making
sure the elections happen in accor
dance with University policy," she
said.
The meeting ended with Senate
Chair Josh Shipp's reminder that
