# Americorps denied funding
## 
### SEAN HARRIS 
Students looking to volunteer after graduation
may have one less option now that Americorps. one of
the nation's largest service organizations, was denied
$lOO million in emergency funding.
From Sept. 2 to 6, more than 700 speakers in
cluding members of Congress, well-known authors,
successful business leaders and dedicated forefathers
of non-profit agencies gathered at a Washington
D.C. rally titled Voices for Americorps. The hope was
that by emphasizing the value of Americorps, as well
as the value of national and community service, there
would be enough of an effect in Congress and among
the public to reverse the recent congressional vote.
But in terms of swaying political opinion, the rally
was unsuccessful.
Despite winning an overwhelming majority in the
Senate, with support from 72 senators, the $lOO mil
lion request was not passed by the House for a second
time.
Rejection by Congress is one of a series of setbacks
for a program that has lately been suffering financial
ly, according to Americorps spokesperson Sandy
Scotep.
"This is disappointing," said Scotep, who is also
press secretary of the Corporation for National and
Community Service in Washington D.C. "It would
have allowed for 20,000 more Americorps positions in
2003. There are many strong programs that we won't
able to fund; without additional funds, we can't fund
additional programs."
The Save Americorps campaign predicts that "Cal
ifornia will face a 65.5 percent decline in volunteer
numbers and a 58 percent decrease in funding" due to
the rejection of funding," according to Bill Faries,
communications director for Rep. Anna Eshoo.
Faries says Americorps also predicts its volunteer
base will drop to 30,000 from 67,000 without the addi
tional money.
According to Scotep, the programs that are likely
to be cut are critical for making Americorps the suc
cessful federal national service program that many
consider it to be. Those programs employ individuals
of all ages, including many graduating college stu
dents, in areas of tutoring, mentoring, building hous
ing with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity,
restoring public spaces and providing public safety
training.
However, concern about cutbacks does not rest
only among the communities and programs that will
be adversely affected; it also affects thousands of grad
uating college seniors since, according to Scotep,

" Americorps is one of the largest employers of college
graduates in the country."
Students who sign up with Americorps give a
commitment for either a full-year or 1,700 hours
of service. For the full year, students are awarded
a living stipend of roughly $lO,OOO. For the part
time commitment, they receive $4,725 for educa
tion costs.
Scotep said graduating seniors will look at Ameri
corps since "it is a fantastic way to jumpstart a career,
especially for people who serve right out of college."
One individual who got involved in Americorps
immediately after completion of college is Stanford
graduate Megan Agee.
Agee entered Public Allies, a large Americorps
program in Silicon Valley, in September 2001 after
graduating from Stanford, and quickly found a match
at a non-profit in Palo Alto. Agee's organization was
called Youth Community Service, where she worked
as a club coordinator doing after-school programs at
six middle schools four in East Palo Alto and two in
Palo Alto.
She said her Americorps program allowed her to
gain a lot of responsibility, make connections, receive
numerous job opportunities and enable her to estab
lish a "non-profit network."
Agee continues to do nonprofit work in San Fran
cisco as a community organizer. She is concerned
about the effect that the Americorps losses will have
on local service organizations like hers.
"Since social organizations pick little bits of money
and only when it is available, at the policy level, a little
ripple at the top can make big waves at the bottom,"
she said.
In the summer of 2003, following the initial con
gressional decision on Americorps' request for
$lOO million, finances for California service organi
zations were cut by 90 percent, putting many orga
nizations, including San-Jose based City Year, into
a "crisis mode," said Chris Wilder, Executive Di
rector for City Year. He said the program, which
has been serving Silicon Valley since 1994 and has
700 alumni to its credit, is less than half the size that
it was a year ago.
City Year, Youth Community Service, and many
other service organizations are now unsure about
their futures as Congress starts to consider the 2004
budget for Americorps.
There is hope among individuals in national service
that President Bush will follow through on his promise
that every member of American society will provide
two years of community service and that Americorps
membership will rise by 50 percent.
