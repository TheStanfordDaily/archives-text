AITHSI EVENT
THE SUBSTANCE OF STYLE:
How THE RISE OF AESTHETIC VALUE IS
REMAKING COMMERCE, CULTURE, AND
CONSCIOUSNESS by Virginia Postrel

Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
At the Great Indoors, a hugely successful
department store chain, customers can choose
from among 250 lavatory faucets. If that
represents too little variety, there are more
than 1,500 distinct models of drawer pulls.
Like it or not, we live in an age where we can
minutely dictate every aesthetic choice, to an
extent our ancestors would certainly have
found disturbingly wasteful and superficial. It
is this censure that New York Times economics
columnist Postrel is dead-set on dismantling.
Aligning herself against "pleasure-hating"
modernists like Walter Gropius and Adolf Loos,
Postrel adopts the position that fashion has
meaning. One of her arguments charms is that
she allows Joe Q. Ray-Ban his own justification
for his purchase ("I like it") against the
interpretations of theorists who insist an
interest in surfaces is linked with deception,
status or falsehood. Postrels apt example of
the proliferation in toilet-brush design is an
effective rebuttal against such theorists-after
all, nobody buys a sleek toilet brush to
impress neighbors who will never see it, so
aesthetics must constitute much of the
rationale. Increasingly, form is simply part of
the function. Postrel begins by explaining that
appearance has a meaning commensurate
to loftier values, then examines the many
manifestations of this truth. While her
argument is intellectually sophisticated,
Postrels journalistic training ensures the
examples she cites are well-chosen and the
prose remains crisp and readable. Gracefully
representing one endpoint of a certain
debate, this ambitious book may someday
become a classic of the genre.
