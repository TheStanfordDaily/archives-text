Every Other Friday, Noon- 1 p.m.
In The Round Room,
Behind and Adjacent to Memorial Church
Fall Quarter Starts Oct. 3
Scripture Study reads both Hebrew Scriptures and New Testament
and meets every other Friday. Bring a lunch and your copy of scrip
tures (we have a copy if you don't!). All backgrounds are welcome.
Attend once or every meeting, for believers and skeptics alike! Our
format is to study and discuss the Scriptures in both a devotional and
historical-metaphorical context. We use critical thinking, historical
inquiry, and thoughtful group discussions to inform our study and
enhance spiritual practice and growth.
