# Returns on endowment look better

### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
After two years of negative returns, the main in
vestment pool for Stanford University's endow
ment received an 8.8 percent return on its invest
ment for the year ending June 30, 2003, the Stan
ford Management Company announced yester
day.
That figure places Stanford's endowment
growth last year among the highest for U.S. uni
versities and could ease the financial stress the Uni
versity has suffered since the economy began fal
tering three years ago.
The change will have implications for the entire
Stanford community, since income from the endow
ment makes up 16 percent of the $2.3 billion budget
used to run the University. However, the decision on
how to allocate funds for undergraduate education,
in particular, comes from the office of the vice
provost for undergraduate education, said Michael
Ross, Stanford's chief investment officer.

Some of the University's peer institutions
matched or exceeded Stanford's high return last
year, varying from 8 percent for Princeton to 12.5
percent for Harvard, according to The New York
Times.
Still, according to a survey released last month
by the Commonfund Institute, the average return
last year among 122 selected educational institu
tions was just 2.9 percent.
Ross says the pick-up of Stanford's investment
performance is partly due to the diversification of
Stanford's investment portfolio. Also, Stanford in
vested a smaller portion in public equities than
other universities.
