Commentary on Prop. 54

Proposition 54 is a dangerous at
tempt by Ward Connerly to make
California the first colorblind state
in America. The idea of ignoring
race in America, however, is abso
lutely absurd and we can't let Cali
fornia start any such trend. Ameri
ca was built on racial discrimination
and continues to practice it at all
levels, whether they be institutional
or personal. Racial inequality still
exists in many forms (i.e. education,
media stereotypes, racial profiling,
etc.), and to ban the collection of
racial data is to ban one's ability to
chart the progress, or lack thereof,
towards racial equality.
If I had the opportunity, I'd love
to ask Mr. Connerly one question:
What good can come out of banning
racial data collection? I am assum
ing that his line of argument would
be that ignoring race is the only way
to end racism, for as long as we con
tinue to define someone by their
race there will always be racial sep
aration, and thus, continued dis
crimination. But the problem with
this is that the racial data ban is only
on an institutional level, not a per
sonal one.
We can act like race doesn't exist
in a legal or political sense, but this
does not do anything for society on a
personal level. I would actually love
to walk down the street and not be
classified by others simply by my
race. I would love to go to an inter
view or sit in classrooms without
thinking about racial stereotypes.
But Prop. 54 isn't capable of doing
this. Instead, it would ignore race at
an institutional level while racial dis
crimination would continue to exist
on a personal level. We can't assume
that ignoring race statistically will
improve racial equality, but it is guar
anteed that it will be impossible to
chart racial discrimination if Prop. 54
passes. Please vote "no!"

One of the great dangers of
Proposition 54 — Ward Connerly's
ballot initiative that would prohibit
the taking of race-based statistics
across practically the entire public
realm — is that it would limit infor
mation available to policy-makers.
Let's take a look at what we
know. Numerous issues affect Cali
fornia citizens differently — to a
large or small extent — based part
ly on their race: health care, school
funding, business employment, in
carceration and even susceptibility
to disease. But race is clearly not
alone as a determinant in how one
is affected by policy — gender,
family background, socioeconomic
standing, among other identifiers,
also are contributing factors.
It is quite evident how inter
twined race, gender, sexual orienta
tion, family background and socioe
conomics are. But as tempting as it is
to make a facile substitution of one
category for another, it must be
avoided. For we also know that race
and class are related, but not exactly
the same; that female and Hispanic
and transgendered citizens may suf
fer unequal employment opportuni
ties, but in different ways and to dif
ferent degrees; and that a Laotian-
American woman's access to health
care may be influenced by both her
gender and her nationality.
This is to say that data about race
cannot alone shed light on public is
sues. It is also to say, however, that
race merits a seat at the table next
to gender, across from class and so
on. When a political body legislates,
is it not critical to consider all of
these forms of categorization?
Prop. 54 would answer "no," man
dating the elimination of a worth
while stream of policy data. Voters
should voice as fierce an opposition
to Prop. 54 as the measure would to
the freedom of information.

On Oct. 7th, Stanford students
will be able to have their voice
heard on Proposition 54, an ex
tremely important initiative aimed
at further eliminating the remnants
of racial bias in the California gov
ernment.
My first experience with govern

mental racial bias and integration
came as a child in San Diego. My
school district had mandated a pro
gram known as the Voluntary Ethnic
Enrollment Program. It was a volun
tary integration program that consist
ed of a group of students who were
bussed into the more affluent schools
districts from poorer communities.
This program was in effect at several
dozen elementary and secondary
schools throughout the district.
Each day, school buses would
make the long trek to take students
back to their communities. Each of
those school buses cost the district
$60,000 dollars to operate and
maintain — the same cost of hiring
two elementary school teachers.
But the problem was that the bene
fits of this program were marginal
at best, according to the superinten
dent of San Diego Schools: "The
magnet program has not produced
the kind of integration we want,
save for a handful of schools. Con
trary to popular perceptions, the
burdens of busing have been visited
on children of color."
This is the legacy of race politics
in California and is precisely what
Prop. 54 seeks to put an end to. By
taking government out of the busi
ness of categorizing people by race,
color or ethnic origin, we can put an
end to counterproductive programs
such as VEEP, which, while having
good intentions, actually take fund
ing away from the communities
they are trying so desperately to
help.
California is the most ethnically
diverse state in the nation. We have
already taken great strides in elimi
nating race as a factor through the
removal of affirmative action from
the UC system as well as the roll
back of formal integration pro
grams in many counties and munic
ipalities. Prop. 54 is a natural pro
gression in this process. By ceasing
to gather data on race, state agen
cies will finally start processing in
dividual's needs on an equal foot
ing. People will be hired or fired by
state agencies on the basis of their
qualifications, not what box they
happen to check on the bottom of
their application.
It is the task of government to en
sure that justice is dispensed to each
citizen equally and impartially. We
cannot truly give all of our citizens
equal worth as long as we continue
to categorize them by race. Prop. 54,
while not perfect, is the most ag
gressive step ever taken in this state
towards equality of opportunity for
all Californians, and that is why we
must vote "yes" on Oct. 7.

Nothing irks me quite so much as
when I read misinformation while
sitting on the john.
On an anti-Proposition 54
poster, which I first discovered on
Branner Hall's first-floor bathroom
and now seem to spot every few feet
around campus, one of the big, all
caps captions stated, "Information
is necessary for our health." This
implies that Prop. 54 would elimi
nate healthcare professionals' abili
ty to acquire such information. This
is simply not true. Section (f) of
Prop. 54 exempts lawful classifica
tion of medical research subjects
and patients. It is essential to dis
count this sort of false propaganda
and read the bill, which can be
found at http://www.racialpriva
cy.org/language.htm, and then de
cide for yourself the proposition's
merits.
Prop. 54 comes down to ending
the practice of checking racial iden
tification boxes in employment, ed
ucation, and contracting. It comes
down to getting rid of a system that
has failed this state for decades.
Our race-obsessed education sys
tem since the inception of affirma
tive action has only served to ex
pand the academic disparity be
tween minority and non-minority
students. It comes down to elimi
nating a morally wrong system of
racial classification born to propa
gate slavery through dividing peo
ple by the color of their skin rather
than the content of their character.
It is time that California regards
individuals as individuals, not as
tallies from arbitrarily assigned
boxes. When a student is failing in
elementary school, it makes no dif

ference whether he or she is
African American, Native Ameri
can or European American. We
must spend money on helping stu
dents who we know are struggling,
not waste money on collecting irrel
evant data on the superficial char
acteristics of these students.
As Carl Cohen eloquently com
mented when defending Prop. 54 to
the Board of Regents: "Will the
University of California be a happi
er or more productive institution
when all of its members have been
catalogued by ethnicity, when each
has been assigned his or her place in
the roll of ethnic categories, count
ed and listed and identified by race
— or will it be happier and healthi
er when all within it are free to go
about their intellectual business
without the burden of representing
or justifying their membership in
some racial or ethnic category?"
These racial categories that seg
regate 126 races and ethnicities in
America must come down. The
racial identification boxes that per
petuate these barriers, therefore,
also must go. I'm voting with my
conscience, for the well being of the
state, in favor of Prop. 54.

Republicans using recall vote for
partisan purposes
Recall reality: The California re
call has nothing to do with Gray
Davis' governing capability and ef
fectiveness. The recall is a Republi
can Party power-play, plain and
simple. How do I know? I listen to
what Republicans are saying.
Darrell Issa, "the father of the
recall," says Tom McClintock's
"continuing candidacy threatens to
undermine the GOP's campaign to
oust Governor Gray Davis." Tom
McClintock has given his voters
"permission" to vote for
Schwarzenegger, if that is the only
way to ensure a Republican wins.
Arnold said, "We're returning gov
ernment to the people." In the next
breath, he stated a Republican win
is all-important.
The GOP doesn't give a hoot
about the Californian people, it's all
about GOP strategy, ideology and
winning. Vote no to Republican
hypocrisy or live with Bush West.

"Mindless killing" of animals for
"science" must end
The rationale displayed by
Linda Cork, the Chair of the De
partment of Comparative
Medicine, on animal testing ("Ani
mal testing sites guard against at
tacks," Sept. 30) shows why the
treatment of laboratory animals
must be monitored by outside agen
cies. Her statement, "We do these
things to establish a basis for good
science and thoughtful animal use"
is more of a justification for the
killing of lab animals than a serious
answer to the question of why such
animals have to be killed in the first
place. Dr. Cork could hardly say,
"We do it because we like to shock
the little bastards and see them
squirm."
As an undergraduate at another
university a generation-plus ago, I
took a lab course on human biolo
gy. One day the instructor killed a
small white mouse and cut it open,
ostensibly to show its internal or
gans to the class. From my seat, all I
could see was a lot of blood, and I
could not help but think that a pic
ture would have served the purpose
better. While that particular in
structor has, hopefully, gone on to
his reward, the same mentality of
mindless killing in the name of "sci
ence" persists today. In a country
whose leaders practice mindless vi
olence on a global stage and in a
state where we are about to have a
governor whose claim to fame and
wealth largely comes from acting as
a killer robot in movies, those of us
who believe in the humane treat
ment of both humans and animals
especially have to stand up for the
rights of those who are unable to
stand up for themselves.
