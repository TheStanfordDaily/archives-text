# ORDER IN THE COURT
## Thinking of taking the LSAT? Taking it Saturday? A law student's words of warning 
### ERIC FEIGIN 
Some free advice for those of you out
there mulling over whether to take the
LSAT... and some words of warning for
those of you who will be sharpening your
pencils on Saturday:
I ran into an old college acquaintance at
the supermarket the other day. I'll call him
"Scott," since that's what his parents named
him.
Scott, who works at a local software com
pany, mentioned that he was applying to law
school for the upcoming year. When I
pressed him as to why, he answered, "I'm in
terested in federal judgeships."
BUZZ! Wrong answer, Scott! Thanks

for playing our game, and I hope you enjoy
your lovely parting gift.
Let's do the math on this, shall we? Yes,
there are hundreds of federal judges. But
there are also thousands upon thousands of
people graduating from law school every
year. Sure, every federal judge went to law
school at some point, but the implication
arrow sure doesn't run the other way.
Moreover, appointment to the federal
bench isn't a pure meritocracy. While merit
is certainly part of the equation, politics and
serendipity often play much "larger roles.
Further complicating the matter is the fact
that federal judges have cool jobs with life
tenure, meaning they can and will keep their
positions long after they're wearing plaid

pants, driving Cadillacs and living in Flori
da. Finally, even if Scott does become a fed
eral judge, this probably won't happen for a
long, long time. What's he planning to do in
the meantime?
Scott's comment is a great example of a
really bad reason to go to law school. Law
school is expensive, hard and often stressful.
Scott will not be well-served by harboring
improbable dreams about his future career
prospects. Let's look at a few other typical
bad reasons:
• I can't bear to enter the real world.
You'll have to leave school eventually.
Postponing it another three years doing
something you're not sure about isn't going
to solve your long-term problems.

• I have no idea what to do with my de
gree in anthropology, and I need a mar
ketable skill.
Laudable goal, but make sure that the
marketable skill is one you'd enjoy using.
Teaching is a marketable skill too, and this
country could certainly use more good
teachers.
• Must have money. Preferably lots of it.
Remember, money can't buy happiness.
Granted, it can buy houses, cars, planes,
swimming pools and a lot of other things
that might make you happy. But it can't buy
happiness itself. What if you're too busy
working 80 hours a week at your firm to
enjoy those things you bought?
• Everybody in my family is a lawyer.

Hey, if I did everything my father did, I'd
eat air-popped popcorn with Tabasco sauce
on it.
Curious whether law school's right for
you? Here's what I suggest: See if you're sat
isfied with a realistic picture of yourself as a
lawyer. If the only time you see the inside of
the Supreme Court is when you take the
tour, will you be happy?
Then again, my free advice is worth what
you paid for it. See you all next year at Stan
ford Law School Orientation.

any U.S. presidents reading this would like to
appoint him to the federal bench, he can be
