## Davis: The life of the party? 
### DYLAN MEFFORD 
I found myself at Sigma Chi on
Saturday night, engaging in all of the
usual debauchery with a bunch of
new freshmen, when suddenly across
the room I saw a strikingly familiar
figure. He was about 6 feet tall, thin,
decent looking and impeccably
dressed in what seemed to be an Ar
mani suit. Now, I'm straight, and so
you may be wondering what all the
fuss was about. But it was none other
than California Gov. Gray Davis.
What, you mean I was the only
one who saw him? Now I had had a
few drinks by that time in the night,
but I hadn't had that many
Okay, so maybe Governor Davis
had better things to do with his time
than party at Sigma Chi. There is,
after all, this little matter of the re
call. But not that many years ago, I'd
guarantee that you'd see none other
than Gray Davis at Sigma Chi par
ties, right here on campus. How do I
know? Because when he went here,
he was a Sigma Chi. No, really. I'm
serious.
And he'd probably have been
doing all sorts of sketchy things that
his classmates now wish they had pic
tures of so that they could sell them
to the tabloids. He was probably
even sketchier than you.
Maybe sketchy is the wrong word,
maybe he was more scary — scary in
his mechanical nature.
Over the summer, I learned from
a friend of mine who works at the
Capitol that Davis and eats a plain
turkey sandwich for lunch every day.
Me: So you mean he usually eats a
turkey sandwich for lunch?
Friend: No. I mean he always eats
a turkey sandwich for lunch.
Me: Really, what does he have on
it?
Friend: Nothing. Just bread and
turkey.
Me:No mayo?
Friend: No mayo.
This guy is a machine. I mean,
how do you eat exactly the same
thing for lunch every single day for
20 years? Maybe it happened like
this:
Davis (completely wasted after
an awesome party at Sigma Chi): So
you're telling me that I can't eat a
plain turkey sandwich every day if I
want?
Friend (also wasted): I bet you
can't eat a plain turkey sandwich for

lunch every single day for 20 years.
Davis: You're on!
Or maybe it didn't begin like that.
In any case, it got me thinking: If
Davis is a machine — and I think
we've already established that - and
one of his primary competitors plays
a machine in the movie "T3: The Rise
of the Machines," why are we having
this recall, anyway? I mean, isn't one
machine as good as another?
Davis is a machine, and a very
consistent one. But he's getting the
job done. If a politician is devoid of
human qualities, it's important that
he do a good job. So let's look at the
facts on the kind of job Davis has
been doing:
Education
He created the largest education
al reform in California history, in
cluding reducing class-sizes, raising
teacher salaries and providing incen
tives for performance. The achieve
ment gaps between races have also
narrowed since Davis took office.
Plus, he probably gave you money in
the form of the Governor's Scholar
program that he created.
Healthcare
Davis created the Healthy Family
Program, which has provided health
insurance to nearly one million chil
dren. He has also funded clinics
across the state and provided more
resources to legal immigrants seek
ing health care.
Environment
He signed into law a bill that re
quires automobile manufacturers to
meet stricter fuel efficiency stan
dards — the toughest in the nation.
Davis has also protected parks and
worked against offshore oil drilling
on the California coast.
Abortion
Davis has protected a woman's
right to choose by funding clinics that
provide needed services. Also, he has
funded more sexual education pro
grams and informational campaigns to
raise awareness of a woman's options
and needs during pregnancy.
Labor
He signed into law a bill that
makes it easier for farm workers to
unionize and earn decent wages.
Davis has worked to increase bene

fits offered by companies in the form
of support for living wage policies
across the state.
Taxes
He has cut taxes since entering of
fice. The recent restoration of the car
registration fee is causing a lot of lies
to be spread, but the tax rate is actu
ally lower today than when he took
office in 1999. The fee is the same as
it was then, and other taxes have
since been cut.
But what about the economy, the
energy crisis and Davis' catering to
special interests?
Economy
The economy is down not just in
California, but across America. Al
most every state faces deficits. Cali
fornia's is the largest because it is the
largest state and because it has in
vested more in education and health

care than most states in recent years.
President George Bush has lost
more jobs than any president since
Stanford's own Herbert Hoover in
the Great Depression. How hot was
California's economy then? For
those of you who didn't get the an
swer to that question, go read Stein
beck's "Grapes of Wrath" again.
Energy
Deregulation created the energy
crisis and caused prices to skyrocket.
The companies involved have been
shut down for a reason. They com
mitted a crime against the people of
California. Davis fought to get our
money back, and has recovered bil
lions of dollars for California taxpay
ers.
Special interests
Catering to special interests? I
suppose Davis is the only politician

who does that. Oh, right, Arnold
Schwarzenegger said he wouldn't
take money from special interest
groups and then proceeded to take
money from everyone he possibly
could. Somehow unions are special
interests and corporations are not.
Talk about a corporate whore. Even
in his Stanford days, Davis didn't
sell himself out like Schwarzenegger
is doing now.
So remember to vote "no" on the
recall on Oct. 7, and keep the Stan
ford frat boy in office. Even if he is a
machine, he's consistent and has
done a good job for California. Make
sure you support him. Who knows,
maybe he'll swing by the next party
at Sigma Chi to thank you. And he
might just try to pick you up too.
