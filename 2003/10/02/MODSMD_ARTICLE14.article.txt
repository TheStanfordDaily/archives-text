## Waking up from Stanford — and realizing it isn't a perfect dream 
### CHRISTIAN JACKSON 
Have you ever noticed how perfect life on the Farm is?
There is no denying it — waking up to the sound of chirping
birds and watching squirrels frolic on the tree outside my Row
house window is a constant reminder. Of course, there is also
that indescribable feeling of the morning air rushing through
your hair on the ride to class. And let's not forget the invari
ably vacuumed carpets of the numerous lecture halls we at
tend for classes.
A year ago, this was all new to me. You see, I transferred
here from a state school. There were a number of reasons for
my decision to transfer. Among them was a growing dissatis
faction with administrative policies. As a member of the stu
dent government, I saw a number of bills meant to improve
student life forcibly suppressed by the administration.
It got to the point where we didn't see them as allies, but
rather, as enemies. They kept us from having fun and from en
joying a fulfilling college experience. By prohibiting on-cam
pus parties from serving alcohol and making dorm staff into
makeshift law enforcers, our liberty to enjoy ourselves was
made to seem like a privilege.
Don't get me wrong though, I'm neither a social nor a clos
et alcoholic. In fact, I can't remember the last time I had a
drink. Nevertheless, it used to be that I had to travel miles off
campus to enjoy the occasional drink with my friends. That all
changed when I came to Stanford. Hearing my RF openly dis
cuss alcohol and encourage my dorm mates and me to drink re
sponsibly was one of the most impressive moments in my trans
fer experience.
For the first time, I really felt as if I was part of a family —
one that would look out after one another. This was in stark
contrast to the feeling of being objectified as a "liability" that

my school had to address. This, of course, strengthened my
love for my new environment, my new school... my new
home.
Sadly, I am beginning to realize that my new home may not
be as welcoming as I once thought. The mystifying effect of the
Farm is passing and I have begun to notice flaws in perfection.

Much like going backstage at Disneyland, the more I learn
about what makes Stanford so great, the more I realize that the
magic I once believed to be at work has been nothing more
than an illusion.

Look around you. It's not real. Everything from the people,
to the stones that form the arcades of the Main Quad, to the
pedestrian malls, to the trees, the shrubs and even the squirrels
are all part of the act. They, along with you and me, are all here
for a reason: They fit the perfect model of what Stanford is (or
should be). Indeed, it was silly of me to think that all of the won
derful elements that make up this school serendipitously came
together to represent scholastic perfection.

I've grown wiser over the past year. I've learned why I real
ly left my former school: I left because it was trying too hard to
be like Stanford. It was trying to hard to attract a group of in
credibly intelligent and diverse students and offer them a
world-class education.
Unfortunately, they failed, so the best they could do was try
to force their current students to act and behave more like
Stanford students — that is, perfect.
This is where my disillusionment with Stanford comes in.
Recently some of the actions of the administration have made
me realize that they want us students to be more like Stanford
students — perfect.
As such, they have resorted to objectifying us simultane
ously as assets and liabilities — the latter in terms of legal
matters with recent changes to the alcohol policy, the former
in terms of our potential to make financial gifts as alumni. But
damn it, I refuse to be objectified. I will be nobody's asset or
liability. I will refuse to contribute to my Stanford "family" if
I am treated as such.
In the end, I guess all I really want is to experience the illu
sion again. And when I really think about it, I don't think I'm
asking for too much. All I am want is the freedom to consume
alcohol (in moderation) in the comfort of my room two or
three times a year or to partake in a band run without feeling
like a member of a herd of cattle.
Per the articles in The Daily, I know that I am not alone. I
know that there are many more of you out there that would
like the administration to act like your caring grandmother,
rather than your strict parents. And so, I question whether the
administration cares, and whether perfection will ever return
to the Farm.

But damn it, I refuse to be
objectified. I will be nobody's
asset or liability. I will refuse
to contribute to my
Stanford "family" if
I am treated as such.
