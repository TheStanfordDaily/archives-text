## Proposition 54 ignores racial reality

Don't be fooled by a disingenu
ous proposition.
University of California Regent
Ward Connerly's opposition to af
firmative action as the African
American champion of Proposition
209 gained him national media
recognition during the months lead
ing up to the 1996 elections. At that
time, Connerly argued that every
one should be evaluated for em
ployment or school admissions ac
cording to the same standards. But
in order to advance this position,
Connerly and others had to over
look the myriad ways in which our
society — even after the limited ad
vances made possible through affir
mative action and other corrective
policies — remains unequal and
routinely affords more opportuni
ties to whites.
Now he's back with Proposition
54, which is built on the fantasy that
racial data does not matter and he
purports to advance a "color blind"
society through a form of legislated
denial. Connerly's agenda is clearer
than ever: Create the fiction of a
post-racist society in order to de
flect attention away from existing
inequalities.
Were it to pass, Prop. 54 would
have profoundly damaging effects
on the education, healthcare, rights
and safety of all Californians. Prop.
54 would outlaw the collection of
data based on race and ethnicity in
most situations.
The proposition would eliminate
means of tracking and monitoring
hate crimes at a time when many
Muslim, Arab and Southeast Asian
Californians are increasingly the
targets of hate-motivated violence.
The effects on education would in
clude the loss of crucial information
related to the recruitment and re
tention of students and differential
access to resources and services.
And the limits it would place on the
collection of data related to our
health have generated calls of alarm
from medical schools across the
state — including Stanford's School
of Medicine.
The language of the proposition
is ultimately disingenuous. You
cannot make the problem of dis
crimination go away simply by pre
tending it is not there and by elimi
nating our means of identifying it.
We cannot function effectively in a
state of public policy denial, wishing
away the social problems that are
expressed along racial and ethnic
lines.
It may be easier for some to sug
gest we forego the work it takes to
fix the inequalities of the past and to
pretend we are now beyond the
racist phase of California history.
But the realities of our multiracial
society require that we resist this ex
hortation to be comforted by fan
tasies and instead take on the chal
lenges of addressing and redressing
discrimination. There is no com
pelling reason to choose ignorance
over being informed in any policy
making situation, and as Peter
Camejo noted in the recent guber
natorial debates, Prop. 54 promotes
ignorance.
Camejo is not alone. Gov. Gray
Davis, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante
and even Arnold Schwarzenegger
have all spoken out against the
proposition and what it would mean
to California. Californians should
show how informed we are about
the world we live in by voting no on
Prop. 54 next Tuesday.
