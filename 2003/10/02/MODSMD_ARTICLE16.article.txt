## Billy Beane is not my lover! 
### 
With guys like Pedro, Hudson,
Nomar and Tejada gracing the
field, there's no shortage of All-
Star-caliber players or intriguing
matchups in the Athletics-Red Sox Division
Series. They're the names that demand mag
azine covers, bobbleheads and other com
mercial exposure. They're the type of player
you want at the plate or on the mound when
your season is on the line.
Most playoff teams have a core group of
unsung contributors and the A's and Red Sox
are no exception. Bill Mueller, David Ortiz,
Scott Hatteberg and Erubiel Durazo are the
veritable, if less heralded, reason their teams
aren't watching the postseason at home along
with the rest of us.

In addition to the matchup on the field, the
series also showcases two of the brightest
minds in baseball — and I'm not talking
about any of the sunflower-seed spitting,

pitching-change making
coaches in the dugout. No,
the A's and Red Sox
wouldn't be where they are
now if not for their respec
tive general mangers, Billy
Beane and Theo Epstein.
Beane, who is profiled
along with his well-educat
ed staff in Michael Lewis's
best seller "Moneyball," has
helped return the A's to the

postseason for the fourth-straight year, de
spite operating on one of the lowest budgets
in baseball. I'm not an A's fan and never will
be, but I've got love for Mr. Beane after read
ing Lewis's book this summer. Besides, any
soul that can make a baseball team look good
in the amphi-landfill that is Network Associ
ates Coliseum deserves some respect.
Epstein, the Yale graduate who at 28 be
came the youngest GM in baseball history last
winter, compiled a roster — albeit more expen
sive — that led both leagues in runs scored, bat
ting average and on-base percentage.
As if their individual stories aren't intrigu
ing enough, consider the fact that during the
offseason, Beane had all but signed the con
tract to take the job that eventually went to
Epstein, changing his mind at the last minute.
"I made one decision based on money in
my life — when I signed with the Mets rather
than go to Stanford — and I promised I'd
never do it again," Beane said at the time re
garding his change of heart.
Well, Billy, I made one decision in my life
that wasn't based on money — when I decid
ed to go to Stanford rather than sign that
songwriting contract with Mandy Moore —
and I promise I'll never do it again. With that,
I give you my playoff par-Ode-y to Billy
Beane, with apologies to Michael Jackson.
(Sung to the tune of "Billy Jean")
The A's were more like a scary dream than
a playoff team / He said that's fine, but what
do you mean that I am the one / Who could
help turn this poor team around / Yes, he is
the one who would make Selig look like a
clown / He told me his name was Billy Beane,
as he watched his team / Six seasons later the
A's are close to being the ones/Who will
dance on the field and the mound
Baseball experts always told him RBIs are
a key stat / And draft some high school pitch
ers to look smart/And scouts always told
him fat guys would not pan out / But fu*k the
conventional way — that's what Billy's all
about!
Billy Beane is not like the other / GMs,
who think that steals and bunting are fun /
Nine Hatteberg's are better than one / The
A's get the job done, and they hardly ever run
After another grueling season /The A's
are back / With guys who were never in de
mand / Part of the plan / He's got three
homegrown aces on the mound / So take his
strong advice, just remember that walks are
as nice / (Walks are as nice)
He told me his name was Billy Beane, as
he watched the screen / And then he smiled
at Miggy T. for taking ball four / To the cha
grin of the guy on the mound
Twice it was the Yankees and once it was
the Twins / Who bounced the A's from the
first round / Giambi left for money / Johnny
Damon and Durham too / He got Foulke and
Durazo soon / Back to that winning tune
Billy Beane is not like the other / GMs,
with piles of cash for every one / But winning
poor is extra fun
Billy Beane is not like the others / But you
must wonder if this year is the one / The A's
will make a longer run / Beane says his job is
done / But in this series it's three and done
Who knows if the A's are the ones? /
'Cause the playoffs have just begun.
