# Football still confident
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team took a tough
loss on Saturday, but you wouldn't know it
from the attitude in practice this week.
After diminutive senior wide receiver
Luke Powell plowed full-speed into a defen
sive back yesterday, knocking him over, the
whole team cheered and laughed as Powell
strutted around the sidelines like a heavy
weight boxer after a knockout.
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis found a
seam in the first-team defense and snuck
through for a touchdown on the last play of
practice, and his teammates mobbed him,
jumping up and down as though they had
clinched the conference title.
"Our players' attitude has been tremen
dous," said head coach Buddy Teevens.
"We've had two very strong practices."
The Cardinal is 0-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference after Saturday's 28-18 loss at Wash
ington, and next on the schedule is a fear
some Southern California team. So where is
the frustration and discontent that charac
terized last year's 2-9 team?
"We have very close players, they like
each other, and they hold each other ac
countable," Teevens said. "There's a great
deal of leadership among the squad mem
bers. You tie that together, and the chem
istry is very strong."
His optimism comes despite a quarter
back situation that others might call a "con
troversy," with fifth-year senior Chris Lewis
sitting on the bench while redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards struggles on the field. In
stead, Teevens calls it "competition."
"Trent continues to learn and improve as
time goes on," Teevens said. "Chris Lewis has
practiced well, although he hasn't had the
game opportunity yet. I'm really excited about
the competition at the quarterback spot."
Excited?
"They push each other in practice,"
Teevens said.
He meant it figuratively, of course.
"[Lewis] is a competitor, he wants to be in
the ballgame, but he's been very supportive of
his teammates," Teevens said. "He's worked
hard in practice. You really appreciate that
type of leadership from a senior."
So why is Edwards still the starter?
"It's the guy that performs the best, the
most consistently, that we're going to go
with," Teevens said. "Trent has been im
proving with each performance. He's seen
three really unique defenses ... He's kind of
learning as he goes, and he's doing some nice

things as a young guy."
But the coach did not rule out playing time
for Lewis in the team's upcoming contests.
"If a guy is struggling for whatever rea
son, and you have a guy that's ready to come
off [the bench], we're going to give him an
opportunity," he said. "This year we have
three guys [including third-string sopho
more Kyle Matter] who can come in at any
time. That's a comfortable position to be in."
Moving on from loss
Teevens said the team is not dwelling on
its loss to Washington, which was sealed with
just under three minutes remaining when
Edwards's cross-field pass was intercepted
and returned for a touchdown by Husky cor
nerback Derrick Johnson.
"You compete hard, you put yourself in a

position to win," Teevens said. "You'd like to
win them all, but it doesn't work that way."
"We can play better," he added. "There's
a number of mistakes we made that are easi
ly correctable, so you pull those out and we'll
get those wins."
Frosh see more action
The team is using its bye week to give
some younger players more repetitions in
practice. Yesterday, freshman running back
Gerald Commissiong was in the backfield
with the first-team offense, and freshman
wide receivers Evan Moore and David
Lofton also saw plenty of action.
Teevens said, "[The bye week] gives you
an opportunity with a lot of the younger
players to give them a little bit more individ
ual attention. Sometimes when you're in

preparation mode, you cut down the oppor
tunities for the really young players like true
freshmen."
Play-calling to diversify
Teevens said that fans can expect the Car
dinal's offensive play-calling repertoire to
expand as the young offensive line matures.
"We're still growing and developing," he
said. "As we continue to grow and improve,
we can do different things, and each week
we're seeing more."
Injury update
The Cardinal played without senior full
back Cooper Blackhurst on Saturday, and he
sat out of practice yesterday, but Teevens
said he is expected to return to action against
USC on Oct. 11.

Senior quarterback Chris Lewis takes the snap at practice. Despite the offensive woes at Washington, Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
has tried to downplay the quarterback controversy. According to Teevens, the competition at the quarterback position is healthy, and
Lewis's disposition has remained positive.

proving with each performance. He's seen
three really unique defenses ... He's kind of
learning as he goes, and he's doing some nice

things as a young guy."
But the coach did not rule out playing time
for Lewis in the team's upcoming contests.
"If a guy is struggling for whatever rea
son, and you have a guy that's ready to come
off [the bench], we're going to give him an
opportunity," he said. "This year we have
three guys [including third-string sopho
more Kyle Matter] who can come in at any
time. That's a comfortable position to be in."
Moving on from loss
Teevens said the team is not dwelling on
its loss to Washington, which was sealed with
just under three minutes remaining when
Edwards's cross-field pass was intercepted
and returned for a touchdown by Husky cor
nerback Derrick Johnson.
"You compete hard, you put yourself in a

position to win," Teevens said. "You'd like to
win them all, but it doesn't work that way."
"We can play better," he added. "There's
a number of mistakes we made that are easi
ly correctable, so you pull those out and we'll
get those wins."
Frosh see more action
The team is using its bye week to give
some younger players more repetitions in
practice. Yesterday, freshman running back
Gerald Commissiong was in the backfield
with the first-team offense, and freshman
wide receivers Evan Moore and David
Lofton also saw plenty of action.
Teevens said, "[The bye week] gives you
an opportunity with a lot of the younger
players to give them a little bit more individ
ual attention. Sometimes when you're in

preparation mode, you cut down the oppor
tunities for the really young players like true
freshmen."
Play-calling to diversify
Teevens said that fans can expect the Car
dinal's offensive play-calling repertoire to
expand as the young offensive line matures.
"We're still growing and developing," he
said. "As we continue to grow and improve,
we can do different things, and each week
we're seeing more."
Injury update
The Cardinal played without senior full
back Cooper Blackhurst on Saturday, and he
sat out of practice yesterday, but Teevens
said he is expected to return to action against
USC on Oct. 11.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis takes the snap at practice. Despite the offensive woes at Washington, Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens
has tried to downplay the quarterback controversy. According to Teevens, the competition at the quarterback position is healthy, and
Lewis's disposition has remained positive.
