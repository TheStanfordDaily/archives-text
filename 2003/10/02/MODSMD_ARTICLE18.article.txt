# Volleyball faces Arizona squads
## 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
For some teams, everything might just be getting into
the swing of things at this juncture of the season. But the
No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team must already feel
like a well-oiled machine after its action-packed 12-game
start.
Before most students had even arrived at school, the
Cardinal (10-2, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) had already
faced two of the nation's top three teams and Stanford
goes into this weekend having won each of its first four
conference contests. However, it wasn't cupcake city for
the Cardinal against Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
and Washington State. Despite being four of the lowest
ranked teams in the Pac-10, they all gave the higher
ranked Stanford squad a run for its money.
This weekend, the Cardinal will have two more ri
vals gunning for them, as the team travels south to face
Arizona and Arizona State on the road. While the two
Arizona schools went winless against Washington and
Washington State two weeks ago, they were ranked
third and seventh, respectively, in the preseason rank
ings for the conference — which has proved to be the
toughest league in the nation with five teams in the top
25 and a combined 66-25 (.725) record against non
conference opponents.
In the desert, Stanford will again be looking to outside
hitters junior Ogonna Nnamani and freshman Kristin
Richards to lead the offense. Last week against Washing
ton and Washington State, Nnamani led the Cardinal with
6.33 kills per game, while Richards was right behind her
with 4.5 kills per game. Moreover, Nnamani has recorded
more than 20 kills in one quarter of the team's matches this
season.
The duo will be receiving its sets from sophomore Katie
Goldhahn, who will continue to set the entire match due to
the wrist injury of senior setter Anna Robinson. Robinson
had been splitting the setting job with Goldhahn before
her injury.
"Ogonna and Kristin are both great hitters," Goldhahn
said. "Ogonna has more experience and as a junior you
can definitely see a difference in the way they play.
Ogonna likes high sets and she hits the ball down hard,
while Kristin likes faster, lower sets and she finds the deep
corners and sharp angles."
The Cardinal first travels to Tempe, where it will face
Arizona State (6-6,1-2 Pac 10) tonight at 6 p.m. If head-to
head play is any indicator of the caliber of play, then Ari
zona State should be the tougher match for the Cardinal
since it defeated Arizona 3-2 last weekend in their in
trastate showdown.
But the Cardinal has historically dominated the series
with Arizona State, with the Devils only managing to win
a mere four times in 46 matches.
A premiere showdown to watch tomorrow will be the

one between Stanford's leading blocker senior Jennifer
Harvey and Arizona State's Natalie Harris. Harvey is
coming off a week in which she led the nation in blocks
with seven against Washington State and three against
Washington, while Harris paces the Sun Devils with an im
pressive 4.14 kills per game.
For the second game, Stanford will travel to Tucson,
where it faces No. 10 Arizona (6-7, 0-3 Pac-10) at 6 p.m.
The Wildcats are currently on a three-game losing streak,
including its loss to the Sun Devils last weekend.
Arizona is led by sophomores Kim Glass and Bre Ladd,
who have 5.43 and 2.94 kills per game, respectively. Last
year, Glass was the AVCA Freshman of the Year with 556
kills on the season, while Ladd was a member of the Pac
10 All Freshman team.
Both games can be heard on KZSU 90.1 FM.
