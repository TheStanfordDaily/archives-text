# Soccer looks to new leadership
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
A year ago, then-sophomore forward Matt Janusz
and the rest of his class were still finding their place on
the Cardinal men's soccer team (2-5-1), looking to
seasoned veterans like Todd Dunivant and Roger
Levesque for guidance.
Now that Dunivant, Levesque and the majority of
Stanford's core players have graduated, eyes are turn
ing toward other players, including Janusz for leader
ship on and off the field.
But Janusz will be the first to tell you that he's not
filling the roles of last year's graduating seniors.
"What most people don't understand is that this is
pretty much a completely different team," he said.
"We're not filling in any gaps because this team just
isn't the same as it was [last season]."
It's one of Janusz's goals this year to separate this
team from the Cardinal squads of years ago.
"We need to get some more team unity and start to
get a team identity for ourselves," Janusz said.
For that to happen, Stanford needs to become a lit
tle more accustomed to the rapid changes that it has
undergone this season.
"People in my class weren't looked to to get the
goals [last year]; we were looking to Roger and Todd
and people like that," Janusz said. "It's new for us to
be the oldest class.
"I used to be the one always asking questions [of
the older players], and now I'm the one being asked."
Aside from the off-the-field leadership that Janusz
has been working on, he has emerged — not surpris
ingly — as an admirable athlete on the field, as he
leads with the highest number of points this season
and is the active career-scoring leader this season.
Janusz also had one of his best games of the year
last weekend against UC-Irvine, posting one assist
and two goals, despite moving from forward to at
tacking midfielder for the matchup.
"I think that it worked well for us," Janusz said of
the new formation for the Cardinal, "[Junior forwards
James Twellman and Darren Fernandez] make the
kinds of runs that I like to play the ball to."
This week Stanford had the challenge of coming up
with another formation that will be effective for
tonight's face-off against No. 22 Santa Clara.
The Broncos are well-known for a tight defense
and the team has been ranked as high as fifth in the na
tional polls this year, as a direct result of that defense.
"Our games with Santa Clara traditionally have al
ways been good," Janusz said in reference to Stan
ford's slim 15-13-5 lead in all-time meetings.
Though the Broncos have not topped the Cardinal
since 1997, Stanford head coach Bret Simon said that
his squad's strategy will be tweaked slightly
to handle Santa Clara's three-forward of
fense. •
"We're basically going to blur the line be
tween backs and midfielders," Simon ex
plained, "Leaving three defenders to cover
three forwards can get a little dicey, so we're
going to give [the defense] some help."
It's unclear whether or not the fact that
Santa Clara is coming off of a long road trip
will be an advantage or a disadvantage to the
Cardinal, but Simon guesses that it will be
the latter.
"They'll be primed for competition," he
predicted, "They are a disciplined, hard
working team.
"It's going to be the job of our coaches
and our seniors to let the younger players
know that they're going into the lion's den."
Stanford will have a couple of advantages
coming into the match as well, one of which
is that the team is very close to having its top
goalkeeper, junior Robby Fulton, back be
tween the posts. Fulton has been out with a
quad injury for the past few weeks.
"If Robby's fully recovered, he'll play [to
morrow] night," Simon said.
The Cardinal also has last week's victory
over UCI working in its favor. After going
through the frustration of a six-game winless
streak, the victory lifted some spirits.
"When you play well and don't get results,
it sits in the back of your mind and makes you
think that you're not as good as you thought
you were," Simon said. "And confidence is
always the best skill for an athlete."
Janusz is of the opinion that at this time, in
this game, confidence won't be a problem for
Stanford.
"We just have to [capitalize on] opportu
nities in the game at the right times," he said.
"We're not intimidated by [Santa Clara's]
ranking. We're just going to go out and play
our kind of soccer."

plained, "Leaving three defenders to cover
three forwards can get a little dicey, so we're
going to give [the defense] some help."
It's unclear whether or not the fact that
Santa Clara is coming off of a long road trip
will be an advantage or a disadvantage to the
Cardinal, but Simon guesses that it will be
the latter.
"They'll be primed for competition," he
predicted, "They are a disciplined, hard
working team.
"It's going to be the job of our coaches
and our seniors to let the younger players
know that they're going into the lion's den."
Stanford will have a couple of advantages
coming into the match as well, one of which
is that the team is very close to having its top
goalkeeper, junior Robby Fulton, back be
tween the posts. Fulton has been out with a
quad injury for the past few weeks.
"If Robby's fully recovered, he'll play [to
morrow] night," Simon said.
The Cardinal also has last week's victory
over UCI working in its favor. After going
through the frustration of a six-game winless
streak, the victory lifted some spirits.
"When you play well and don't get results,
it sits in the back of your mind and makes you
think that you're not as good as you thought
you were," Simon said. "And confidence is
always the best skill for an athlete."
Janusz is of the opinion that at this time, in
this game, confidence won't be a problem for
Stanford.
"We just have to [capitalize on] opportu
nities in the game at the right times," he said.
"We're not intimidated by [Santa Clara's]
ranking. We're just going to go out and play
our kind of soccer."

Junior Matt Janusz carries the ball in the open field. The midfielder has taken
on a heightened leadership role both on and off the field this season.
