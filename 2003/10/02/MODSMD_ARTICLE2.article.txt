# Jackson condemns Prop. 54
## Activist speaks at rally in White Plaza yesterday 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke against Propo
sition 54, the recall election and racial in
justice in front of a crowd of several hun
dred people in White Plaza yesterday as
part of a rally sponsored by Stanford's
Coalition to Stop Prop. 54.
Proposition 54 prohibits state and local
governments from classifying people by
race, ethnicity, color or national origin. If
approved, California, one of the most eth
nically diverse states in the United States,
would be the first in the nation to ban data
collection of this kind. The proposition

was authored by University of California
regent Ward Connerly and placed on the
ballot in July.
Jackson said that those who do not vote
or vote Republican on Oct. 7 are "like a
chicken voting for Colonel Sanders. You
might be frustrated today but you'll be fried
tomorrow."
Jackson came to Stanford as part of his
"Keep Hope Alive / No on 54" college
campus tour to denounce Proposition 54
and the gubernatorial recall election.
Jackson's arguments against the propo
sition were broad. He characterized the ini
tiative as an ideological issue rather than
expanding on its specific problems.
Proponents of Proposition 54 argue it is
an initial step toward a color-blind society
by taking government focus away from
race. They also contend it will increase pri
vacy, stop the government from giving pref

erential treatment based on race and elimi
nate what they view as an outdated racial
classification system. Advocates say the
proposition is a reflection of California citi
zens who "no longer see themselves in
racial boxes."
Meanwhile, some medical and health
care professionals argue that the proposi
tion would eliminate important statistical
health information. They maintain that
health needs and risks vary by race and thus
it is important to have racial and ethnic data
both for research and to treat patients. An
other argument against the measure is that
racial data is needed to determine how
racism affects education and that law en
forcement agencies need race-based data
to uncover racism and fight racial profiling.
Using examples and anecdotes from the
civil rights movement, Jackson said that the
same forces that fought against equal pub

lie accommodations for all citizens, the
right to vote and desegregation support
Proposition 54.
"There is no 'back in the civil rights day,'
" Jackson said. "The struggle continues."
Additional civil-rights problems, he
said, allowed the "loser to win and the win
ner to lose" in the 2000 election and result
ed in a push to end affirmative action with
Proposition 209.
Another issue Jackson spoke strongly
against was the recall election that shares
the ballot with Proposition 54. He said the
recall is "a torpedo in the ship of democra
cy. [It is] another attempt by conservatives
to undermine an election they could not
win at the polls."
Jackson's speech emphasized Democra
tic versus Republican sentiments, in partic
ular rallying the largely partisan crowd with
the cry, "We are going to take America
back in 2004." He said that if the Republi
cans can "seize this state" by winning the
recall election, that this essentially would
be giving Bush California. He described the
2000 presidential election and the recall as
Republicans "trying to win on the cheap."
Jackson also spoke out against the con
tinued war in Iraq, which he said is bank
rupting American morals, the Treasury and
President George Bush, among other
things. He said that supporters of the
proposition also want to raise tuition costs
so that the "poor who cannot go to college
go to the war and shed their blood."
He encouraged the audience to work to
wards a multi-cultural society, the Ameri
can dream, the ability for citizens to work
their way up in society and equal high-qual
ity education and health care for all, saying,
"Don't condemn genius to poverty."
Jackson ended his half-hour speech with
a chant of, "Say no on 54, no 54, no 54."

Students react
"I don't agree with much of Jesse Jack
son's ideology or methods," said sopho
more Ben Daniel, "but I certainly would
not pass up a chance to see such an influen
tial figure on campus. In my opinion, the re
striction of information is never a good
thing for society; if a problem exists, it is re
ally in the usage of this information, and
that is what should be changed."
Junior Nic Markman had already decid
ed to vote against the proposition before he
attended the rally. He came to see Jackson

in order to "have more points when
I'm arguing with people about the
proposition and so I would be better
informed."
Others were struck by Jackson's
delivery. "I'm mainly impressed by
his hopefulness," said senior
Christopher Kost. "His arguments
were not very tight, but he is very
passionate."
"The coalition was extremely
overwhelmed and pleased with the
response from the Stanford com
munity," said junior Hunter Har
graves, a member of the Coalition.
"We hope students will carry that
momentum on to the polls on
Tuesday."
Coalition member Christian Paiz,
a junior, said, "I thought [the rally]
was just amazing. It is really support
ive and startling how many people
are here."
The rally began with a perfor
mance by junior Mark Otuteye, a
spoken-word artist and activist, a

short speech by Steve Philhps, Class
of 1990, and an introduction by Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni.
Coalition members handed out
posters and pins and offered to
paint students' faces white, sym
bolic of the slogan, "Don't erase
race, erase racism." They asked
people to write down their names
and pledge to vote no on the
Proposition and to indicate
whether they are going to vote.
The coalition plans to remind
these students to vote on the day
of the election this Tuesday.
The Coalition to Stop Prop. 54 is
an association of 20 ethnic, political
and academic student organizations.
It asked Jackson to speak at the rally
to educate students about the propo
sition and to encourage them to
vote. It has also planned an event
this Saturday and another rally on
Monday.
"There are plenty of undergrads
and grad students, but mostly under
grads, who don't know what Prop. 54
is," Hargraves said. "We want to ed
ucate the Stanford community
[about] what will happen if Prop. 54
passes."
