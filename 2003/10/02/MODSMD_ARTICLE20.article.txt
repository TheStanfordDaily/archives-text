# Cubs' winnings wreck havoc with oddsmakers
## 
### MICHAEL HIRSLEY CHICAGO TRIBUNE 
LAS VEGAS (KRT) — The Cubs have be
come a bear of a problem for sports oddsmakers
in this gambling mecca.
Chicago's National League team, which last
won a World Series 95 years ago, are threatening
to gain revenge on the Las Vegas "house." That
is, the bookmakers who have taken and cashed
the betting money of hapless Cubs' fans who put
their money where their hearts were ... year
after year after year.
This could be that "next year" that lives in
those fans' fantasies.
If so, it will be a nightmare for the oddsmak
ers.
"I can tell you the Cubs winning the World
Series would be a really bad result for the sports
books," said Tony Sinisi, senior oddsmaker for
Las Vegas Sports Consultants. "Now we're at

the point where there's so much money bet on
the Cubs that they have become a huge liability
to the sports books."
"The Cubs are the one team that got into the
playoffs that the house wasn't rooting for,"
agreed Art Manteris, vice president of race and
sports book operations for Station Casinos,
comprising 11 sports books in Las Vegas. "It
may be payback time for all of those fans
who've lost money on the Cubs in all those past
years."
Whether from the heart early in the season,
or from the smarts later on - realizing that Kerry
Wood, Mark Prior, Matt Clement and Carlos
Zambrano would be a formidable pitching rota
tion in a short playoff series — bets on the Cubs
have been building all season long. Enough bets
that sports books have been dropping the odds
drastically against the Cubs winning the World
Series.
That's the way oddsmakers hedge their bets

and slow the wagering action on a team. The
Cubs, who were anywhere from 30-1 to 50-1
longshots on Opening Day, now rate 4-1 or bet
ter to win the World Series.
It varies among casinos. At the Mandalay
Bay Sports Book, for example, odds on the Cubs
and the Boston Red Sox (who haven't won a
World Series in 85 years) were 7-2, behind only
the New York Yankees at 2-1.
Manteris and Sinisi said the Cubs, for reasons
of sentimentality and national exposure, always
have been a popular team for bettors.
"People bet on them even when they were
pretty lame," Manteris said.
The Cubs and Red Sox both appeal to fans'
heartfelt wagers. But Boston was seen as a
strong team on Opening Day while the Cubs
were not, Sinisi said.
Even as the Cubs threaten to slug his busi
ness, Sinisi said, "It's hard not to root for them.
It's a great story."
