# Crime report shows bike thefts up
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Bike thefts increased by 50
percent last year, but burglaries
and most other major cate
gories of crime stayed at levels
similar to previous years ac
cording to statistics released
yesterday by the Stanford Po
lice Department.
Director of Public Safety
Laura Wilson downplayed the
importance of the statistics, not
ing that long-term crime trends
at Stanford have stayed very sta
ble over the past year.
"I always say statistics are just
one measure of safety," she said.
The federally mandated sta
tistics show that bike thefts
jumped from 186 in 2000 to 483
last year. In the same period,
burglaries dropped from 199 to
156.

Wilson blamed the depressed
economy for the increase in bike
thefts.

"Our bike theft rate mirrors
unemployment in Santa Clara
County almost exactly," she said.
"There's not going to be a lot the
police can do about that."
Many students agreed with
the police chief's assessment,
noting that though most people
know someone who had a bike
stolen, students could usually
credit the theft to a temporary
lack of vigilance.
"I'm very conscious about it,"
said junior Rafer Willenberg, the
Resident Bicycle Coordinator
for Freshman-Sophomore Col
lege. "I always lock my bike to a
solid object and never use quick
release wheels."

Other students argued that
the police should investigate

the increase in bike thefts more
thoroughly.
Sophomore Michael Li had
his bike stolen in October of last
year.

"It's a serious problem," he
said. "I think [Stanford] should
do something about it. It hap
pens every year and it's not like
it's going to stop. They could do
some investigation at least and
find out what kind of people are
stealing bikes and what they are
doing with the bikes."
Still, Li is no longer so wor
ried about having his bike stolen.
"I always lock it well now," he
said.

Wilson offered the advice
that "people should be more
aware when we have high unem
ployment."

The annual statistics also
show an increase in the number
of sexual assaults reported on
campus, up to four from one, but
Wilson said it was hard to know
what this meant.

At the same time, the number
of sexual assaults reported to
counselors on campus dropped
from 17 in 2000 to seven last
year.

"To track statistics from year
to year," she said, "there are so
many variables. Sometimes they
are limited measures."
In-dorm alcohol offenses
jumped last year from two to 16,
though the number for the entire
campus remained at approxi
mately 60.
"Students call 911 when they
think someone is in trouble [due
to alcohol]," Wilson said. "I
would not equate the increase
with greater student abuse of al
cohol but with more education
and awareness."
