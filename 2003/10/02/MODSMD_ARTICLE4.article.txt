# Center to be built for grad students
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's graduate student
community can look forward to
new work, dining and social facili
ties designed especially with its
needs in mind.

On Tuesday, the Graduate
Student Council announced the
procurement of a General Use
Permit to build the Graduate
Community Center in Escondido
Village, a project that will be com
pleted by next fall.

The Center will be financed
through a large grant from alum
nus John Arrillaga. According to
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, Provost John
Etchemedy authorized an addi
tional University debt to help
fund the project.
The idea of a graduate student
community center is over five
years old, according to GSC Chair
Steve Allison. Only after Arrilla
ga's donation has it become a sud
den reality, with construction set
to begin this quarter.
Awakuni emphasized that "If
Arrillaga had not been so gener
ous and donated the funds to
build the center, it would have
been years before the funds could
have been raised to get it done."

The announcement was the
culmination of many weekly
meetings of the project planning
committee, chaired by Awakuni.
Over the past five years, GSC
members worked to review needs,
goals, and funding options for the

two-story building covering
12,000 square feet, according to a
press release issued Tuesday.
In addition to meeting rooms,
offices, a workstation, and admin
istrative facilities, the center will
house a pub, which the Council
hopes will provide a social atmos
phere at the end of the day.
According to Awakuni, the
Center is "a much needed facility
in an area of campus that's home
to about 4,000 students and their
families."

"If you don't have a car, and
you're a graduate student, you're
pretty much stuck," claimed
Navin Sivanandam, a first-year
Physics graduate student from
England.

He added that while Tresidder
Union "works during the day,"
campus life shuts down at night, at
least for the graduate student
population.
Dana Rettell, who manages the
Coffee House and the rest of the
Tresidder complex for Stanford
Dining Services, sees no competi
tive disadvantage in the construc
tion of the new pub at the Center.

"The more the merrier," she said,
referring to the need for options in
student dining and social gathering.

The beneficiaries of the center,
as Interim Dean of Students Chris
Griffith suggested, include gradu
ate student families as well. By of
fering facilities for students from
every walk of life, "The Center
will be the place where our com
munity comes together for social, in
tellectual, and cultural events as well
as just hanging out with friends."
Recently the GSC had been con
sidering the construction of a larger
commercial kitchen in the new pub,
which would provide more food op
tions at a higher cost than that of a
cafe-style establishment.
However, consensus remains
about the need for "an alcohol and

dining service that meets student
needs," according to Allison.
After yesterday's GSC meeting,
members decided that a commercial
kitchen was not a priority, as long as
the restaurant offered "a fun and
inviting pub atmosphere for stu
dents," Allison said.
"I think this building will become
a fundamental component of gradu
ate student life," Allison said.
The GSC welcomes all sugges
tions for the Center's development.
