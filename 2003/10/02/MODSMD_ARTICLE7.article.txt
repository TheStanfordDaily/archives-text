# Gay fraternity member denied presidency
## 
### CLAUDIA ADRIEN INDEPENDENT FLORIDA ALLIGATOR 
(U-WIRE) â€” Nate Barnes' fellow fraternity
members didn't care that he was gay.
But three years ago, everything changed when
Barnes, now a senior at the University of Florida,
ran for president of Pride Student Union.
He said members of Kappa Sigma's executive
board did not want their fraternity to be associat
ed with homosexuality and asked Barnes not to
run. When he refused, Barnes said they removed
him from the fraternity.
"At that point I was pissed," said Barnes, who
later won the Pride election. "I knew I had a lot to

offer to the fraternity."
Barnes didn't want his removal to be the end of
his involvement with Florida's Greek community.
He attempted to establish a chapter of Delta
Lambda Phi, a national fraternity for gay, bisexu
al and progressive gentlemen.
But there were rifts among those interested in
chartering a Delta Lambda Phi Fraternity chapter
and the effort floundered. Barnes said he still
wishes UF had a chapter.
He is not alone.
"There's a need for gay fraternities as there is
for any other," said Doug Case, coordinator for
fraternity and sorority life at San Diego State Uni
versity.

Case interviewed more than 500 gay and les
bian members of Greek chapters nationwide in his
study, "A Glimpse of the Invisible Membership:
A National Survey of Lesbigay Greek Members."
In the study, which was conducted more than
10 years ago, he concluded that it's "hard for gay
students to be themselves" in traditional fraterni
ties.
Florida International University senior Jorge
Casas agrees. He is president of the nation's
largest chapter of Delta Lambda Phi fraternity at
FIU.
"We can just break away and be ourselves in an
environment where you're not the minority," he
said.
