## tunnel VISION 
### JESSICA HANLEY 
You're biking home from class in the middle of the
quarter. The wind is whipping against your sweatshirt and
it's starting to rain. Suddenly, you feel a wave of heat flow
up from the ground underneath your bike as you cruise
over a circular metal grating. You have just experienced
the pleasant, and slightly alarming, heat of the under
ground steam tunnels.
When Stanford University's system of steam tunnels
was constructed in 1891, it was intended to provide heat
and hot water to the buildings.
But more than a century later, the underground
labyrinth has evolved into a playground for risk-loving,
adventurous Stanford students.
Today, sophomores Anthony Viola and Josh Smith
carry on the Stanford steam tunneling tradition.
"The whole idea of [steam-tunneling] is doing it spon
taneously," Smith said. He and his friends choose to sub
merge themselves into the stuffy tunnels on random
nights, and not much planning is involved.
Their preferred entry point is a large grating behind
Memorial Church, which is substantially wide and well lit.
Some areas of the tunnel are quite dark, so Viola recom
mends bringing a flashlight.
After descending down the manhole, tunnel explorers
find themselves in a humid, dirty, brick-lined tunnel with
pipes running along the walls. They then creep along the
tunnels, turning corners and staying underground until
the heat becomes unbearable, at which point they look
for the nearest manhole and climb out.
"The scariest part is that you just come out of the tun
nels, and you have no idea where you are," Smith said.
"You don't feel like you've traveled very far."
Smith and his friends view navigating the tunnels as a
Stanford rite of passage and return to the tunnels despite
the intense heat and cramped walking space.
While Viola and Smith represent the current genera
tion of steam tunneling aficionados, Stanford students
have been navigating the sweaty maze for decades.
"In terms of exploration of the tunnels, yes, this has
been going on for years," University Archivist Kimball
said.
In fact, Stanford Magazine lists tunneling as one of 101
activities students should be sure to partake in before
graduating, according to a 2000 issue in which Tom Flat

tery, '53, recalls exploring the tunnels.
"We spent late hours mapping the tunnels under the
Quad, Green Library and the engineering buildings and
searching unsuccessfully for a branch to Roble and Lagu
nita women's dorms," Flattery said.
The hope that the tunnels could lead to Stanford
women did not begin with Flattery and his dormmates.
During the Great Depression, writers for The Stanford
Daily attempted to exploit these tunnels by selling stories
about them to other newspapers.
"One [student] told the San Francisco Chronicle that
the vast network of underground steam tunnels con

necting most campus buildings might enable a fraternity
man to sneak into a sorority," Stanford Magazine re
ported last year. Afterward, the Chronicle "ran a staged
photo of a young woman leaning coquettishly out of a
tunnel vent."
The University was quick to point out that it is not in
fact possible to enter sororities or dormitories directly
through the tunnels; the misinformed reporter was
promptly expelled.
The risks are not limited to reporting about steam tun
nels; engaging in steam-tunneling can lead to disorientation
and claustrophobia, along with serious physical injuries.

"There is definitely a risk in going steam tunneling,"
said Kimball, who knows of a student who experienced
serious burns last year as a freshman, while attempting to
navigate the dark tunnels.
But the steam tunnel system remains in place, despite
the potential for student injury.
"While there have been upgrades over the years, the
steam tunnels with their pipes running through them still
do the same job," Kimball said.
That is, while they provide warmth to students in win
ter, they will also continue to supply late-night adventures
for the daring.

Steam tunnels are located beneath Stanford's surface, and "tunneling" is a tradition with old roots. But beware; last year, a freshman was hurt in a tunnel.
