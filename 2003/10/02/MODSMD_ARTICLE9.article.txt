U""W" t's all about you! "is Stanford Din
ing's promise to its customers.
But that's a promise the non-prof-
JL it organization has not kept. In
the literature that Stanford Dining distributes
to the campus, it claims that its service offers
convenience, quality and variety. Not so much.
Stanford Dining doesn't provide meal plans
that are flexible. It doesn't serve food that
pleases the palate. It's not even cheap. In short,
students almost universally agree that Stanford
Dining is too costly and does not adequately
cater to the needs of students.
Yesterday, The Daily reported on freshman
Andrea Runyan's efforts to start a long-over
due protest against Dining Services. Hef
biggest criticism, one in which many Stanford
students share, is that the majority of the under
graduate student body must purchase an over
priced meal plan. She has proposed a boycott of
the dining hall. We hope her efforts catch fire.
We hope that students speak up — and protest
for change.
When students sign up for meal plans at
Stanford, they automatically incur a charge of
$379 to cover overhead for dining facilities and
their "efficient managing." This charge — used
to subsidize the organization's costs — signifi
cantly diminishes the monetary difference be
tween the most expensive and least expensive
meal plans available.
Residents who eat at an "all-you-care-to
eat" dining hall, for example, can only choose
from a maximum of 19 meals per week —
which costs $1,550 per fall quarter — to a min
imum of 10 meals per week with 36 meal plan
points for $1,433. A difference of $117 per quar
ter is all that separates the two dining hall plans,
and students who make use of "a la carte" plans
have even fewer options. This is neither practi
cal nor affordable.
Nadeem Siddiqui, the executive director of
Stanford Dining, has said meal plans are
mandatory as part of Residential Education's
commitment to provide a community for stu
dents in dorms. We do not buy his argument.
Community can be formed, we believe, in many
other ways — through additional dorm events,
social hours, even group cookouts.
Furthermore, students' meal plans are deter
mined by individual residences, which results in
isolation among students living in different
dorms. A student in Roble Hall, for example,
must select from the same-old meal options
(pasta, salad, chicken, beef) at Lake Lagunita,
while his peer in Wilbur must choose only from
the "a la carte" options in his dining hall. If a stu
dent fives in a dorm with one plan and has
friends in a dorm using another plan, his options
— should he want to dine with his friend — are
limited. Community, therefore, is interrupted
rather than preserved. Normally, friends in dif
ferent dorms can only eat together if they spend
precious guest points.
Stanford Dining's claims that the solution
to this problem, among others, lies in its new
Cardinal Flex Plan — which allows studerfts to
eat outside their dorms. But the plan is any
thing but flexible. Students are provided with
139 meals for the quarter, 70 meal plan points
and 46 Cardinal dollars. They are also given

the option to convert meals into usable dollars
at "a la carte" eateries. But the conversion rate
runs at a paltry $2.75 per meal, a curious ratio
considering that Stanford Dining charges
$7.85 for a student purchasing dinner outside
his meal plan.
The validity of the conversion rate is further
drawn into question by the per-meal costs in
Stanford Dining's other meal plans. Assuming
there are 12 weeks in fall quarter, meals run at
$6.80 a pop for the 19-meals-per-week option.
At the other end of the spectrum is the 10-
meals-per-week plan, which nets a per-meal
cost of $11.64.
Those lucky enough not to be on an "all-you
care-to-eat" plan — that is, students in Manzani
ta and Wilbur — are not necessarily better-off
than their peers in other dorms. Students in these
residences must purchase meal plan points and
Cardinal dollars, both of which are purported to
be equal to one dollar of purchasing power. But
students end up paying up to a 40 percent sur
charge for the privilege of having the points. Meal
plan R, for example, which offers 1,024 meal plan
points at a cost of $1,403, nets a per-point cost of
$1.37. While a charge for overhead is understand
able, a 40 percent surcharge is not.
A quick comparison of Stanford's meal plans
to those of universities around the nation provides
anecdotal evidence of the Farm's astronomical
costs of dining. The University of Wisconsin in
Eau Claire, for example, charges $3.30 for a stu
dent dinner, and the 19-meals-per-week plan at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick nets a per
meal cost of $5.63.
Of course, a primary defense of the cost of
student meals is that the cost of living in the
Bay Area is far above the national average.
We recognize this fact. But we are college stu
dents, not six-figure executives with five-bed
room homes in Palo Alto. If anything, our an
nual net income is negative, and yet our dining
plans cost 10 percent of our yearly tuition bills.
It should be no surprise, then, that Stanford
Dining's claims of convenience are as dubious as
its assertions of affordability. Lunch at the major
ity of Stanford Dining locations spans less than
two hours and dinner at Manzanita, Branner,
FloMo and Ricker ends before 7 p.m. Flexibility
is not the name of the game, nor is convenience.
To purchase meals outside of the defined dining
time periods, for example, students on "all-you
care-to-eat" plans must turn either to their bank
accounts or to their supplies of Cardinal dollars.
These problems remain independent of per
haps the greatest complain levied against Stanford
Dining. The food, usually, isn't that good — espe
cially given that each meal costs about $8. In fact,
students would be better served eating every meal
of the quarter at local food joints like Fresh
Choice, Subway, or Baja Fresh —and they would
still probably pay less than what Stanford Dining
charges them. Unfortunately, this is not an option.
Those dissatisfied with Stanford Dining
have little recourse — until now. We hope that
Runyan organizes a well-planned protest
against Dining Services. When students speak
in large numbers, an organization with a slo
gan "It's all about you!" should listen. Stan
ford Dining should put its money where stu
dents' mouths are.
