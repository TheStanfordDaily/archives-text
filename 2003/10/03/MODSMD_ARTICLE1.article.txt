# University cracks down on alcohol
## Officials to work with Greek system 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Greek community is treading
carefully this year, after high-ranking admin
istrators took notice of four "egregious" in
cidents that took place within one month last
spring involving alleged alcohol abuse, haz
ing and sexual assault.
"We cannot have another year like last
year," said Joey Greenwell, assistant direc
tor of student activities and fraternity advis
er. "Last year was an anomaly, and I have
high hopes for this year."
In a meeting called last June by Provost
John Etchemendy and Vice Provost John
Bravman with the leaders of all of the Greek
organizations concerning the alleged inci
dents, Etchemendy's first reaction after
learning of the incidents was to say he want
ed to abolish the Greek system altogether,
according to Morris Graves, associate dean
of students.
"He was speaking tongue-in-cheek when
he said that," Graves said.
According to Graves, Etchemendy went
on to say that instead of following his first re
action, he decided to have a dialogue with
the Greek leadership about both the admin

istration's and the Greek community's con
cerns.
"Etchemendy was looking to the Greek
community to take accountability and man
age themselves as organizations," said Joey
Greenwell, assistant director of student ac
tivities and fraternity adviser.
Still, the future of the Greek community
at Stanford is secure, at least for the time
being, administrators say.
"There is not some impending demise
awaiting the Greek system," said Bravman.
"The provost wanted to speak directly to the
Greek leadership about the number of seri
ous Rush-related incidents involving alco
hol. We urged the student leadership to take
control of the hazing situation, knowing that
they would compel the University to act if
they did not."
Still, the Greek community is not always
satisfied with the way things are handled by
the administration.
"The University seems suddenly para
noid about how they can be held liable when
their greatest interest used to be for the stu
dents," said senior Lizzy Bennett, Kappa
Kappa Gamma president.

The alcohol policy prohibiting alcohol from being served at frosh dorm events went into effect last spring, but many students feel
like the administration has focused more attention on enforcing these rules since students arrived on campus last month.
