# University cracks down on alcohol
## Officials to work with Greek system 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Greek community is treading
carefully this year, after high-ranking admin
istrators took notice of four "egregious" in
cidents that took place within one month last
spring involving alleged alcohol abuse, haz
ing and sexual assault.
"We cannot have another year like last
year," said Joey Greenwell, assistant direc
tor of student activities and fraternity advis
er. "Last year was an anomaly, and I have
high hopes for this year."
In a meeting called last June by Provost
John Etchemendy and Vice Provost John
Bravman with the leaders of all of the Greek
organizations concerning the alleged inci
dents, Etchemendy's first reaction after
learning of the incidents was to say he want
ed to abolish the Greek system altogether,
according to Morris Graves, associate dean
of students.
"He was speaking tongue-in-cheek when
he said that," Graves said.
According to Graves, Etchemendy went
on to say that instead of following his first re
action, he decided to have a dialogue with
the Greek leadership about both the admin

istration's and the Greek community's con
cerns.
"Etchemendy was looking to the Greek
community to take accountability and man
age themselves as organizations," said Joey
Greenwell, assistant director of student ac
tivities and fraternity adviser.
Still, the future of the Greek community
at Stanford is secure, at least for the time
being, administrators say.
"There is not some impending demise
awaiting the Greek system," said Bravman.
"The provost wanted to speak directly to the
Greek leadership about the number of seri
ous Rush-related incidents involving alco
hol. We urged the student leadership to take
control of the hazing situation, knowing that
they would compel the University to act if
they did not."
Still, the Greek community is not always
satisfied with the way things are handled by
the administration.
"The University seems suddenly para
noid about how they can be held liable when
their greatest interest used to be for the stu
dents," said senior Lizzy Bennett, Kappa
Kappa Gamma president.

The alcohol policy prohibiting alcohol from being served at frosh dorm events went into effect last spring, but many students feel
like the administration has focused more attention on enforcing these rules since students arrived on campus last month.
"The staff
_at the Of
fice of Stu
dent Ac
tivities is

not always good at getting their message across
— sometimes they come off as sort of nasty,"
said one fraternity member, who asked to re
main anonymous. "They assume the worst of the
situation and their policy of placing temporary
probations on us before a formal hearing puts us
ur(der a 'guilty until proven innocent' rule."
But Graves said that temporary sanctions
are placed only after reports are backed up with
sufficient evidence and if the health and safety
of students are at stake. So far, all of the organi
zations that have been placed on temporary
prbbation have been declared accountable by
thfe Organizational Conduct Board, the Univer
sity organization that handles violations com
mitted by student groups.
"We obviously are most concerned with stu
dents' health and safety, with their ability to
thrive academically and to grow as whole indi
viduals, so instances of behavior that impact
any of these are taken very seriously," Brav
man said. "Physical or mental abuse, sexual
misconduct, destruction of property — these
typically lead to stiff responses. If a pattern of
behavior develops within a living community,
then the University is compelled to look be
yond the individual to the group, and respond
accordingly."
In recent weeks, rumors have spread that the
exclusion of urinals in the newly renovated
Kappa Sigma and Theta Delta houses are a sign
of a Greek phase-out.
But Greenwell said the decision was a main
tenance issue.
"Urinals are harder to upkeep," Greenwell
explained. "These are both fine chapters and
they have no risks of losing their houses."
' While many students feel that the University
has become stricter toward Greek organiza
tidns, Graves attributed any changes to a "more
consistent enforcement of University policy."
Senior Ben Dey, president of Sigma Chi,
agjreed.
f "They are doing a better job of enforcing al
ready existing policies and rules and not looking
thjb other way at stuff that may seem nitpicky to
students and that in the past had been over
looked," he said.
Two years ago, the University imposed hous
ing probations on Kappa Sig, Kappa Alpha,
Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. It was the
jfiret time the University had used this kind of
measure, Greenwell said. Previous
ly i the University's policy was to send status let
ters to fraternities every year listing their viola
tions.
"The chapters were not making the improve
ments on their own," Greenwell said. "We want
-to strengthen the chapters and we want them to
succeed. We also need to protect them by fol

lowing risk reductions and reducing liability."
But some have complained about a lack of com
munication between the University and Greek
organizations.
"I think everyone knows that incidents oc
curred last spring for which Greek organiza
tions got in trouble and are currently under re
view, but the details of those incidents were
never released or acknowledged to the Greek
community," said a sorority member. "Instead,
we were invited to a meeting with the Provost
and told that the future of the Greek communi
ty at Stanford is in jeopardy. While I understand
the necessity for confidentiality, it is very diffi
cult for me, as a leader of a Greek organization,
to dispel rumors and try to explain what's going
on to my own chapter when I have not been
given any information or guidance from the
University."
There are also complaints that "the Greek
community is the first to be held responsible
when things go wrong," according to another
sorority member.
Administrators admit that Greek organiza
tions are often given harsher punishments than
residences for the same violations.
"Greek organizations are held to a higher
standard because they are the only organiza
tions that are allowed to selectively choose their
members," Graves said. "We hold them collec
tively responsible for any problems."
Greenwell said that, in general, fraternities
adhere to party-planning guidelines.
"I think that fraternities do some of the best
party planning on campus," he added. "But they
suffer because of the higher expectations that
are placed on them."
Members of the Greek community are also
concerned that as the University places more
and more fraternities on social probation, the
social life of the entire campus will suffer.
"They're not just punishing us; they're pun
ishing all of the students who go to parties," a
fraternity member said.
Greenwell said that students who attend par
ties should take responsibility for their actions.
"I think that a lot of pressure is placed by
Stanford students on Greek organizations to
host parties," he said. "But when the students
attend, they don't show respect for the party
planners or the house."
Greenwell said the University supports
Greek life on campus.
"The University has and continues to have a
commitment to Greek organizations," he said.
"I think that the community contributes a lot to
this campus. Ultimately, my hope is that Greek
life continues to grow, expand and diversify."
Several members of Greek organizations feel
that the administration is not intentionally at
tacking the Greek system.
"The University is not anti-Greek," said se
nior Keaton Miller, Kappa Sig president. "They
just want to see that Greek organizations con
tinue to maintain a high level of responsibility
and accountability."
