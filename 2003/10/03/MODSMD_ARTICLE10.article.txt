# More alcohol alternatives needed
## 
### 
It is now clear to most Stanford communi
ty members that the University is deter
mined to deter underage drinking. From
the alcohol-related housing revocation of
a freshman to the changes in the formerly enti
tled Senior Pub Night, University officials are
obviously worried about irresponsible alcohol
use on campus and they are showing their con

cern by enforcing the Uni
versity's Alcohol Policy
more vigorously than per
haps ever before. But as
well-intentioned as those
seeking to decrease cam
pus drinking may be, we
believe the University is
promoting abstinence in
all the wrong ways.
While protecting stu
dents is an admirable ob
jective, it is not enough
to simply begin a draco
nian enforcement of the
Alcohol Policy without
at the same time provid
ing alternatives to drink
ing. If Stanford truly
wants to decrease the
role alcohol plays in the
social life of Stanford un
dergraduates, it must
provide students with al

ternate activities and ways to have fun during
downtime on the Farm.
A quick scan of this weekend's events on
campus reveals nothing that could even re
motely be considered a substitute for a good
party. Unless the University starts to sponsor
alcohol-free social events on a more regular
basis, no policy will be able to keep students
from going out on their own to functions
where alcohol is likely to be a key component
of the evening.

To prevent underage drinking, it is impor
tant to target freshman during their first few
weeks on campus. If they walk away from this
first quarter with the impression that Stanford
does not provide any alternatives to drinking,
then their social behaviors will likely be set to
include alcohol consumption for the remain
der of their careers on campus.

Additionally, Uni
versity officials should
also consider the conse
quences of not providing
more dry activities for
upperclassmen. If the
strong crackdown on al
cohol continues, legal
drinkers may then be
forced to seek their fun
away from campus, ne
cessitating the use of a
car. By providing school
sponsored, alcohol-free
social activities, Stan
ford may help prevent
drunk driving, which is
both illegal and life
threatening.
We recognize that
the University has set out
to reduce drinking on
campus. While we main
tain our strong opposi
tion to the recent crack

down on alcohol, we offer this recommenda
tion to University officials in the spirit of con
structive collaboration. Reducing the promi
nence of alcohol on campus cannot be accom
plished in a vacuum. Students need to have fun
on the weekends, and currently one easy way
to do this is to go to events where alcohol is
served. Without true alternatives to drinking
— and currently there are very few — the Uni
versity cannot expect students to abstain.
