## MY COUSIN VINNI Leadership role models don't rule the day 
### 
Where have all the lead
ers gone? Where is this
generation's contribu
tion to the long list of
American progressives who have in
spired us, changed us and made us
better? Who is leading this genera
tion?
When pulling out the paper or
turning on the news, who do I see?
Arnold. Is Arnold capable of leading
this state, let alone this country ...
let alone this generation? I say no —
but not because he is a Republican
or that he will lead a locust of special
interests into California. I say no be
cause when I mention Arnold
Schwarzenegger, no one's heart
beats faster with the anticipation of
something better; no one's eyes tear
at the thought of a better reality. For
that truly is what a leader does: He
inspires so that he may change the
world.
Where is our inspiration? Where
is our Martin Luther, a man who
stood up against a church so big that
it infiltrated and dominated all as
pects of everyday existence? I look
around and I see no man willing to
nail his life to a piece of paper; no
man willing to say what he knows to
be true and not what his constituents
already believe to be true.
Where is our civil rights move

ment? Across the globe, people are
oppressed both by their respective
nations and by the actions of our own
country. We have "liberated" Iraq
from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein,
but we have replaced it with the
tyranny of American economic inter
ests, which — because we are the
world's only superpower — is in
finitely greater than the tyranny of
any one man.
Where is the leader who will
stand up against the U.S. Congress?
Where is the leader who will nail his
life to the doors of the Oval Office
and say it is not right to meddle in an
other nation just so that our own may
be better?
China is both the most populous
nation in the world and one of the
most repressive against its "citizens,"
yet I don't see President George W.
Bush, a leader in only the most ele
mentary sense of the word, launching
wars against it. I don't see him
aiding — let alone recognizing — the
people of Tibet. Where is the leader
that can? Where is the leader that will?
If our president had tried to liber
ate Tibet instead of Iraq, the Dalai
Lama, a man in exile dedicated to
liberating his people exclusively
through peaceful means, would have
tried to stop him in every way possi
ble. This is because the Dalai Lama

is a leader in every sense of the word.
He is a leader because he inspires
people, but mainly he is so because
he is willing to put them second when
humanity dictates that they must
take a backseat to the interests of
right, to the interests of justice and to
the interests of peace.
Where is our leader? When will
we see an American stand up and
put America second? We no longer
live in a world where our actions re
sult in consequences for us and only
us. Rather, we live in a world where
every action we take influences and
changes the nations and communi
ties around us, for this world is now
truly a global village. This planet is
now a community in and of itself.
We can no longer sit as ignora
muses and believe our actions to be
solely our own. What we do affects
our fellow nations, for they are no
longer foreign entities, but neigh
bors in the same village. Our next
leader will not be an American lead
er. Our next leader — this genera
tion's leader — will be a leader of
the world, for it is now the communi
ty of humanity that needs our help.
