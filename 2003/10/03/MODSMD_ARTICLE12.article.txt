Community members speak out
on Prop. 54
Imagine a state where police use
race and ethnicity to classify perpe
trators but not victims of crimes —
perpetuating the stereotype that
people of color are criminals, while
simultaneously preventing the
tracking of hate crimes committed
against them because of such
stereotypes. Imagine a state where
people of color are singled out as
guinea pigs for medical experimen
tation, but where any research into
diseases that pronouncedly affect
particular racial or ethnic groups —
from teen smoking to Hepatitis
B — is forbidden. Imagine a state
where more people of color live in
proximity to toxic waste dumps and
other environmental hazards or
where public schools with the high
est concentrations of minority stu
dents receive the lowest funding al
locations, but where none of these
racial inequalities can be monitored
for improvement by any depart
ment or agency affiliated with state
or local government.
This is the state we will be living
in if Proposition 54 passes on Oct. 7.

The amendment to California's
constitution that Ward Connelly is
billing as a protection of privacy and
a step toward a "color-blind" soci
ety will have the effect of pretending
that racism doesn't exist. But pass
ing Prop. 54 won't change the fact
that three times as many Latinos in
California have no medical insur
ance as compared to non-Latino
whites. Passing Prop. 54 won't
change the fact that minority stu
dents are disproportionately subject

to less qualified teachers and have
fewer opportunities to take ad
vanced coursework in public
schools. And as long as racism is
alive and well as an integral part of
how our society and public struc
tures function, race is not a private
matter either. State departments
and agencies are some of the most
important sources of statistics that
enable us to track and combat the
racial discrimination that is a part of
every single one of our lives.
While a "color-blind" state may
sound appealing, we must recognize
that race still matters in California.
The ability to monitor race is essen
tial to ongoing efforts to fight racism
and to strive toward a state which is
not necessarily "color-blind," but
one in which we can acknowledge
and celebrate racial and ethnic dif
ferences without maintaining a hier
archy based on those differences.

Last spring, I was in Macy's at the
Stanford Shopping Center with two
of my sorority sisters. I am black and
they are both Latina. While brows
ing the accessories department, we
were followed and watched by two
employees. I even walked towards a
different department to make sure
this was actually what they were
doing. As I expected, they followed
me. I complained to a supervisor,
who neither denied that this hap
pened nor seemed particularly sur
prised by it.
This happened in 2003 in Northern
California, the supposed home of left
wing nuts. So, you supporters of

Proposition 54, suppose after fifty
people experienced this at Macy's that
they decided to file a civil suit. Wait...
they wouldn't be able to. How is this
making California better for all of the
African Americans, Latinos, Filipinos
and other minority groups commonly
discriminated against? Only those
who have never experienced discrimi
nation can convince themselves that it
no longer exists.
If you are one of these people,
ask your friends and classmates of
color to tell your their stories. Ask
them about the guidance counselors
who told them that they would
never make it at Stanford. Ask
about the people who respond, "Oh,
then you must play a sport" when a
black student tells them that he goes
to Stanford. And once you've
learned about the reality of race in
California, you'll realize why Prop.
54 must be voted down on Oct. 7.

Raining cats, not birds
I graduated in '66. I remember the
campus and surrounding fields and
golf course having tremendous
numbers of California quail, literal
ly convoys of 100 birds. I am on cam
pus frequently, and all I see are
semi-wild cats — no quail and not
many small birds either. Does the
University do anything to control
the roving cat population, in order
to reestablish some balance in the
ecosystem on the Farm?
