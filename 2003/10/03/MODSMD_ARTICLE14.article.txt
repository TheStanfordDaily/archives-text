## Naked man, prohibition & sketchy stuff 
### 
Today we're going to look at Stanford
from a different perspective that,
call me an overachiever, makes
sense of quarterback Chris Lewis's
bench warming, Donny Bridge's excommu
nication from Roble and the fiasco that was
Sorority Rush last spring. Oh, and naked
strangers masturbating in dorm parking lots.
Because frankly, my readers, some
things just aren't adding up here in the Bub
ble. ■
In Jesse Jackson's words to Wednesday's
crowd in White Plaza referencing baseball,
"The playing field is even. Rules are public.
Goals are clear." At least in the world of
sports, things make sense. Do your best, play
fair, and above all, win.
If only things were so transparent off the
ffeld'
Freshman Donny Bridge has been tem
porarily removed from his Roble housing by

the powers that be because
he bought some booze in
Vegas, gave his friends
probably their best week
end at Stanford to date and
he maybe even made a little
profit off the excess supply.
If he's lucky enough to re
turn to the dank, dark halls
of Roble, he will be under
"close watch" and receive

counseling.
Wait, counseling? Are you joking?
The alcohol rules are getting clarified
daily. Theta Delt, 680 and Xanadu got placed
on Social Probation, SAE is rumored to be
losing their house and Pub Night is now Se
nior Night but if you're under 21 you can't go
anyway.
Maybe Stanford really can eradicate all
Underage alcohol consumption and effec
tively be liable for nothing. If students can't
drink at parties or in their own rooms, maybe
they'll just stop, especially if you target peo
ple like Donny. It makes sense, like how con
dortr distribution at high schools makes teens
jvani, to have sex.
f. If the goal is clear, where is the logic? We
Ban Start making sense of problematic events
by asking questions.
C Take Rush, for example. Last spring, hun
dreds of freshmen came out to ISC Sorority
Rush after they had been encouraged, ca
joled, and persuaded by recruitment efforts
to just give sororities a chance, only to be
"not invited back" after the first night.
Were sororities trying to make people
feel bad about themselves? Was that their
goal, or could there possibly be more at
work? Say, for example, the number of girls
each sorority was required to cut on the first
night stayed constant while the number of
girls who showed up doubled? And that for
iner assistant dean of students Nancy Howe
passed down this unexpected information
after all the rushees had gone home that first
night?
■ Voila, ask some questions, get some an
swers. Disgruntled (rightfully so) sopho
mores across campus can breathe a sigh of
relief: No, sororities don't hate you. You just
got screwed in a numbers shuffle.
I have a question. Were football players
and coaches required to make their appear
ance'on Wednesday for the Bookstore's New
Night? Imagine being an attraction
aLa book sale. Maybe, for the shoppers, it
took'the edge off the lose-lose situation. You
could save 20 percent off your bill of over
priced xeroxes if anything had actually still
been in stock.
i* Maybe you could ask Buddy Teevens
iwhy quarterback Chris Lewis is spending
tiis final year with the Cardinal keeping
the bench nice and cozy. Teevens wants to
win, right? Trent Edwards is struggling,
right?
Teevens said, "It's the guy that performs
the best, the most consistently, that we're
going to go with." OK, so if Edwards is the
only guy performing, then he's the best.
< Far be it for me to feign expertise with
the intricacies of Cardinal Football. What
I do know is this: Most of the athletics
game takes place off the field. It's in prac
tice, it's behind the scenes, in meetings
and phone calls and opinions and person
ality differences. Maybe even some foul
pPfjy; from time to time, or did you think
vteter polo players wear multiple layers
juSt for fun?
| * I don't have the answers, I'm just asking
questions. I asked Chris Lewis why he isn't
plaWng. He smiled . . . and told me I could
up my own quote. Let's use Buddy's
instead: "You'd like to win them all, but it
cjbtesn't work that way." Make sense?
; !h the meantime, consider this: The
Santa Clara County Sheriff diligently fined
lunchtime visitors at EBF $35 a piece
Wednesday afternoon, but missed the
naked man masturbating a few feet away
pext to the parking lot. Thanks, Officer
#N713.
