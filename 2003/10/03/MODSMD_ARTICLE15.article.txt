# Stanford soccer ties on the road
## Card gives up goal in 82nd minute, final score 1-1 in overtime 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal men's soccer team
knew to expect a tough game long
before last night's matchup with No.
22 Santa Clara (7-2-3) actually com
menced. Stanford has only a slight
lead in all-time meetings with the
Broncos, a team known for its dis
tinctively fierce defensive special
ists.
So when the Cardinal men
showed up at Buck Shaw Stadium
ready for a fight yesterday evening,
they got one.
The game ended in a double
overtime 1-1 tie, pushing Stanford's
record to 2-5-2 this season.
The first five minutes of the game
set the tone for the night, as each
team fired off a shot on goal early.
Freshman goalkeeper Andrew
Kartunen thwarted Broncos'
sophomore Ryan Wolfe's at
tempt, while Stanford junior Dar
ren Fernandez had his shot
blocked by Santa Clara junior
Steve Cronin.
Both teams had trouble finding
the net in what turned out to be a
physical, and at times rough,
matchup with the squads recording
three yellow cards each and combin
ing for 47 fouls.
"It was a very rough game, the
roughest we've had all year," said
Stanford head coach Bret Simon, "It
was a battle every moment of the
way."
Stanford got on the board first
in the 29th minute, after junior
James Twellman blasted a direct
free kick into the net from 20
yards out.
"They have a great defense, but
we have a great offense too," said
Twellman, who led the team's two
forward offense with three shots
on goal.

"I played [the Broncos] up top
last year and so did [junior forward
Matt Janusz]. We weren't intimidat
ed; we were just confident out
there," Twellman said.
Kartunen and the Cardinal de
fense kept the Broncos scoreless
until the 82nd minute, when Santa
Clara sophomore Kelechi Igwe
managed to find the back of the net.
By the end of regulation, the
Broncos had outshot Stanford by a
12-7 margin. Santa Clara also had 10
corner kicks to Stanford's one.
Santa Clara posted five more
shots in overtime, but couldn't force
anything into the net, while Stan
ford could not muster a shot.
"At times we played well enough
to overcome [Santa Clara's] aggres
sive, full-pressure defense," Simon
said. "We were up a goal for most of
the game but just couldn't finish it."
"We knew heading into tonight
that is would be a tough game,"
Twellman said. "It was a physical
game, but we fought hard and I think
we're going home happy with our ef
fort."
The game marks the second tie
that the Cardinal has recorded
against a ranked opponent this sea
son; the first was against then No. 8
Southern Methodist last month.
Stanford now travels to Berkeley
to face unranked California (4-4-1)
on Sunday night.
The Cardinal is a daunting 23-8-6
all-time against the Bears, including
an unimpressive 0-1-1 record in
three matches last season.
Cal dropped its first three games,
but has found its rhythm since then
and has gone 4-1-1 in its last six
matchups.
The Cardinal watched the Bears'
last two games from the stands, as
Cal played UC-Irvine and Fairleigh
Dickinson at last weekend's
Nike/Stanford Invitational Tourna
ment.
The Stanford-Cal face-off,
which marks the Pacific 10 confer
ence opener for the archrivals,
kicks off at 5 p.m. at Edwards Sta
dium.
