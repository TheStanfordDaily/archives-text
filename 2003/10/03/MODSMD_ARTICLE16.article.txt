# No. 2 polo eyes USC

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
makes a bid for regaining the top spot in the na
tion during this weekend's Northern California
Tournament hosted by the Cardinal at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
Over Saturday and Sunday 14 of the na
tion's top water polo teams will compete in 32
games, culminating in Sunday's championship
game at 5 p.m. — where the Cardinal hopes to
defeat No. 1 Southern California (8-0), the top
seed in the other half of the bracket.
Stanford's first matchup will be at 9:50 a.m.
on Saturday against unranked Santa Clara. If
the Cardinal wins that game it will go on to
compete against either No. 7 UCLA (5-3) or
No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara (7-5) at 4:30.
Junior two-meter Greg Crum expects the
games will be exciting. With many talented
teams entered in the tournament, the Cardinal
will have a challenging schedule.
"UCLA's always a tough team," he said.
"We haven't played Pepperdine yet, and
they're a really good team. There's going to be
a lot of good games."
Stanford is familiar with many of the oppo
nents it will face this weekend, most of whom
participated in the SoCal Tournament at UC-
Irvine two weeks ago. The Cardinal is out to
burn the Trojans after a heated, triple-over
time loss in the championship game of that
tournament.
The men will likely be up against UCLA for
their bracket final, but they don't discount the
chance of a UCSB upset.
"It should be the same top four teams -
USC, Cal, Pepperdine — but every team is ca
pable of an upset," Crum said. "Santa Barbara,
Long Beach State — a lot of chance for an
upset, which is always fun to see."
The Cardinal has only played one non-con
ference game since the SoCal tournament,
against BYU-Hawaii. Still, players don't think
the lack of games will hurt them in NorCal.
"At this point in the season I don't think

that's a big problem," said senior
utility Mike Derse. "It's true the
more games you play the better you
play as a team, but right now we play
each practice like a game, so I think
we're improving each day of practice
and that is really going to show this
weekend."
Crum said he thinks the teams had
the opportunity to see each other play
in SoCal and will come into this week
end's tournament with a good idea of
what to expect from each other.
"It's probably going to be better
water polo," he said. "It's going to be
a lot smoother, not as crazy."
The team has spent the last week
getting into shape and Derse expects
a much more sophisticated game
from the Cardinal. Rather than wor
rying about the other teams, the em
phasis has been on clear thinking
and preparing for all situations.
"We got into some pretty intense
long practices where we do hard
swimming and give ourselves a base
— get in shape basically," he said.
"Now as we approach NorCal we're
focusing more on team skills like
last-second shot plays — things that
are going to polish our game."
Stanford scoring has been solid
this season. Junior Tony Azevedo
and sophomore Thomas Hopkins
both set career highs in last Wednes
day's game against BYU-Hawaii,
with seven and five goals, respective

ly. They lead the team with 16 goals
apiece for the season.
While the Cardinal has a strong
offense, team members predict
that this tournament will come
down to playing better defense, es
pecially if they make it to the
championship.
"Defense was our main concern
over the last tournament," said
Derse. "We have plenty of guys who
can score goals. We have Tony
[Azevedo], Thomas Hopkins, Peter
Varellas. But where we need to stop
USC is on defense."
Derse wants to see the defense
keep the opposition at lower scores
than the SoCal championship, which
Stanford lost 10-9.
"If we can keep them to five or six
goals, I think we have a very opti
mistic chance of winning."
According to Crum, the team
needs to constantly pressure USC's
strongest weapons: Juaj Zatovic,
Gadi Hadar and Predrag Damjanov.
"I think we messed up on that last
time," Crum said. "We stepped off
their better shooters and played up
their weaker shooters and that al
lowed their better shooters to score
with ease."
"If we get the opportunity to play
SC, you can't give up ten goals and
expect to win games," he said.
Ultimately, Stanford anticipates
a home advantage.
"I know we can beat them," said
Derse. "It is going to be a tight game
and both teams are going to have to
fight to win and hopefully playing in
front of our audience, things will go
our way."

game at 5 p.m. — where the Cardinal hopes to
defeat No. 1 Southern California (8-0), the top
seed in the other half of the bracket.
Stanford's first matchup will be at 9:50 a.m.
on Saturday against unranked Santa Clara. If
the Cardinal wins that game it will go on to
compete against either No. 7 UCLA (5-3) or
No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara (7-5) at 4:30.
Junior two-meter Greg Crum expects the
games will be exciting. With many talented
teams entered in the tournament, the Cardinal
will have a challenging schedule.
"UCLA's always a tough team," he said.
"We haven't played Pepperdine yet, and
they're a really good team. There's going to be
a lot of good games."
Stanford is familiar with many of the oppo
nents it will face this weekend, most of whom
participated in the SoCal Tournament at UC-
Irvine two weeks ago. The Cardinal is out to
burn the Trojans after a heated, triple-over
time loss in the championship game of that
tournament.
The men will likely be up against UCLA for
their bracket final, but they don't discount the
chance of a UCSB upset.
"It should be the same top four teams -
USC, Cal, Pepperdine — but every team is ca
pable of an upset," Crum said. "Santa Barbara,
Long Beach State — a lot of chance for an
upset, which is always fun to see."
The Cardinal has only played one non-con
ference game since the SoCal tournament,
against BYU-Hawaii. Still, players don't think
the lack of games will hurt them in NorCal.
"At this point in the season I don't think

Junior Tony Azevedo and the No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team dropped their only game of the season to USC. The two
teams could meet again in this weekend's NorCal tournament.
that's a big problem," said senior
utility Mike Derse. "It's true the
more games you play the better you
play as a team, but right now we play
each practice like a game, so I think
we're improving each day of practice
and that is really going to show this
weekend."
Crum said he thinks the teams had
the opportunity to see each other play
in SoCal and will come into this week
end's tournament with a good idea of
what to expect from each other.
"It's probably going to be better
water polo," he said. "It's going to be
a lot smoother, not as crazy."
The team has spent the last week
getting into shape and Derse expects
a much more sophisticated game
from the Cardinal. Rather than wor
rying about the other teams, the em
phasis has been on clear thinking
and preparing for all situations.
"We got into some pretty intense
long practices where we do hard
swimming and give ourselves a base
— get in shape basically," he said.
"Now as we approach NorCal we're
focusing more on team skills like
last-second shot plays — things that
are going to polish our game."
Stanford scoring has been solid
this season. Junior Tony Azevedo
and sophomore Thomas Hopkins
both set career highs in last Wednes
day's game against BYU-Hawaii,
with seven and five goals, respective

ly. They lead the team with 16 goals
apiece for the season.
While the Cardinal has a strong
offense, team members predict
that this tournament will come
down to playing better defense, es
pecially if they make it to the
championship.
"Defense was our main concern
over the last tournament," said
Derse. "We have plenty of guys who
can score goals. We have Tony
[Azevedo], Thomas Hopkins, Peter
Varellas. But where we need to stop
USC is on defense."
Derse wants to see the defense
keep the opposition at lower scores
than the SoCal championship, which
Stanford lost 10-9.
"If we can keep them to five or six
goals, I think we have a very opti
mistic chance of winning."
According to Crum, the team
needs to constantly pressure USC's
strongest weapons: Juaj Zatovic,
Gadi Hadar and Predrag Damjanov.
"I think we messed up on that last
time," Crum said. "We stepped off
their better shooters and played up
their weaker shooters and that al
lowed their better shooters to score
with ease."
"If we get the opportunity to play
SC, you can't give up ten goals and
expect to win games," he said.
Ultimately, Stanford anticipates
a home advantage.
"I know we can beat them," said
Derse. "It is going to be a tight game
and both teams are going to have to
fight to win and hopefully playing in
front of our audience, things will go
our way."
