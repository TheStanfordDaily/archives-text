# No. 2 polo eyes USC

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
makes a bid for regaining the top spot in the na
tion during this weekend's Northern California
Tournament hosted by the Cardinal at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
Over Saturday and Sunday 14 of the na
tion's top water polo teams will compete in 32
games, culminating in Sunday's championship
game at 5 p.m. — where the Cardinal hopes to
defeat No. 1 Southern California (8-0), the top
seed in the other half of the bracket.
Stanford's first matchup will be at 9:50 a.m.
on Saturday against unranked Santa Clara. If
the Cardinal wins that game it will go on to
compete against either No. 7 UCLA (5-3) or
No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara (7-5) at 4:30.
Junior two-meter Greg Crum expects the
games will be exciting. With many talented
teams entered in the tournament, the Cardinal
will have a challenging schedule.
"UCLA's always a tough team," he said.
"We haven't played Pepperdine yet, and
they're a really good team. There's going to be
a lot of good games."
Stanford is familiar with many of the oppo
nents it will face this weekend, most of whom
participated in the SoCal Tournament at UC-
Irvine two weeks ago. The Cardinal is out to
burn the Trojans after a heated, triple-over
time loss in the championship game of that
tournament.
The men will likely be up against UCLA for
their bracket final, but they don't discount the
chance of a UCSB upset.
"It should be the same top four teams -
USC, Cal, Pepperdine — but every team is ca
pable of an upset," Crum said. "Santa Barbara,
Long Beach State — a lot of chance for an
upset, which is always fun to see."
The Cardinal has only played one non-con
ference game since the SoCal tournament,
against BYU-Hawaii. Still, players don't think
the lack of games will hurt them in NorCal.
"At this point in the season I don't think
