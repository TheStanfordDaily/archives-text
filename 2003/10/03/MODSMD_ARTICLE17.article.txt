Things have not been flowing smoothly for the Stan
ford field hockey team. In a season marked by tough
losses, the last time things were flowing at all, they were
doing so in the wrong direction.
The Cardinal (3-6,1-1 Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference) dropped five in a row, including a heartbreaking
overtime loss to No. 17 California, before defeating Pa
cific 4-2 last Saturday.
Despite the losing record and the five-game losing
streak still in the back of their minds, Cardinal players
are looking forward to the rest of the season and are op
timistic about their upcoming road trip.
"We kind of had a couple hard losses but those were
against really hard teams," said sophomore midfielder
Lyndsay Erickson. "I think that really prepared us well
for the rest of the season."
However, the Cardinal's schedule does not get any
easier on the road trip. Saturday, Stanford will take on
No. 9 Michigan State, followed by No. 20 Northwestern,
Central Michigan and the cross-Bay rival Bears.
A win over the Spartans would not only help Stanford
make up ground in the NorPac standings, but would also
help boost the morale of the team and gain momentum
for the rest of the trip.
"[A win] would be really huge since they're a higher
ranked team," said freshman forward Cara-Lynn Lo
presti. "It would prove that we can hang with those top
level teams, which I certainly think we can. The win
against UOP definitely brought us up but I think [beat
ing] Michigan State would be even more significant."
The team is still young but they have worked hard
throughout the season. The upcoming schedule serves as
a test to see just how far they've come,
"We had a very, very tough schedule this year, and in
terms of just having a young team we may not be getting
the results, but it's great experience for them on terms of
where we need to be on the national level," said Stanford
head coach Leslie Irvine.
"Going to Michigan State will show whether our skills
and our passing patterns, our aggression and everything
that we've been working on these two weeks can be
taken to the next level," Lopresti said.
