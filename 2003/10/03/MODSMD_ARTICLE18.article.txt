# No. 4 Card sets over Sun Devils
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite a weaker offensive showing than the Cardi
nal is used to, the women's volleyball team (11-2,5-0 Pa
cific 10 conference), was able to cruise on the momentum
of 18 service errors by the Sun Devils yesterday in Tempe
to win its fifth consecutive conference match 30-24,30-22
and 30-22.
In its first four conference matches, the Cardinal de
feated both Oregon teams and both Washington teams,
but not without fighting through several close games and
tight matches. Against Arizona State, however, the 18
service aces and a strong defensive showing by the Car
dinal helped Stanford to possibly its easiest win in Pac-10
play.
The Cardinal offense, usually led by junior Ogonna
Nnamani and freshman Katie Richards, only saw a com
bined 16 kills from the two outside hitters, which is three
less kills than Nnamani notched on her own against
Washington last Saturday. Middle blockers, seniors Jem
nifer Harvey and Sara McGee picked up the slack for the
Cardinal, with nine and eight kills, respectively. Total,
the Cardinal had 38 kills on the night and a .302 hitting
percentage.
It was the Cardinal defense that came through the
strongest against the Devil's. Sophomore libero Court
ney Schultz, who was filling in for the injured Leahi Hall,
was named the KZSU /Country Sun Natural Foods Play
er of the Game after digging 10 balls. Again filling in for,
the injured senior setter Anna Robinson, sophomore
Katie Goldhahn played the entire match, and had eight
digs of her own.
Stanford destroyed Arizona State at the net, out
blocking the Sun Devils 15-4, and outhitting them .302 to
.120 (in hitting percentage). Harvey led the Cardinal
with five blocks.
Tomorrow, Stanford travels to Tucson, where it will
face Arizona. The Wildcats entered the season ranked
tenth in the USA TODAY/AVCA Division I Coaches
Top 25 poll, but have since fallen out of the top 25 after
its loss to Arizona State last weekend. This will be a par
ticularly meaningful match for the Cardinal, as last year
in Arizona, the Wildcats came from two games down to
hand Stanford a 3-2 loss. Game time is set for 7 p.m. As
always, the game will be broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.
