# Soccer ready for Broncos
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The last time the No. 23 Stanford women's soc
cer team (5-3-1) squared off against Santa Clara (4-
3-3) things were different. At the time, the Broncos
were the top-ranked team in the nation and had not
suffered a defeat at the hands of the then-No. 12
Cardinal in over eight years. Entering tonight's 7:30
p.m. battle with Santa Clara, it's evident that times
have changed for both teams.
While Stanford won last year's contest, the
Broncos rebounded and eventually made it to the
second round of the NCAA tournament, losing to
eventual national champion Portland, the same
team the Cardinal would fall to in the quarterfinals.
Both teams remain competitive this year but
have struggled to fill holes left by injury and gradu
ation.

Last year, Santa Clara boasted a midfield led by
senior All-Americans Aly Wagner and Dewyn
Hawkins. The fist of accolades that follow Wagner
and Hawkins seem to be about a mile long.
The two were selected first and third in the
WUSA draft, respectively. The recent closure of
WUSA has left Hawkins jobless, but Wagner, the
2002 National Player of the Year, has been running
the field with the likes of Mia Hamm and Brandi
Chastain for the United States World Cup team.
Hawkins had to decline the U.S. Soccer's invitation
due to injury.
Even with what was dubbed the No. 1 recruiting
class in the nation by Soccer America, the two mid
fielders are sorely missed this season.
To make matters worse, the Broncos were with
out juniors Jessica Ballweg, Megan Kakadelas and
Leslie Osbourne for the first game of the season.
The trio of starters missed time as they were travel

ing with the Under-19 U.S. National Team.
Ballweg has stepped up in the midfield since her
return. She was named to the all-tournament team
in last year's College Cup as a defender, but has
done a remarkable job distributing the ball to her
forwards this year.
Santa Clara senior Veronica Zepeda, a versatile
scorer who has seen time at both the forward and mid
field positions, has been slowed by a variety of leg in
juries. She has been forced to sit out several matches
while coming off the bench as a substitute in others.
Stanford lost its top scorers as well in Marcia
Wallis and Marcie Ward to graduation and injury,
respectively. Ward's injury is just one of many the
Cardinal has suffered over the course of the short
season.
"Injuries have just killed us this year," said Stan
ford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We really haven't
gotten the chance to all play together with one con
stant team because girls have been in and out."
Both Hunt twins have missed time, with Lindsey
recovering from ACL surgery and Hayley nursing
a sprained ankle in addition to a broken wrist.
Freshman Rachel Buehler, sophomore Megan
Alderete and freshman Shari Summers also suf
fered ACL injuries.
Buehler and Lindsey Hunt have been cleared to
play and have started to see limited action.
Ward's absence has left a big hole to fill on of
fense.
"It's definitely our offense that has been weak,"
Ratcliffe said. "A lot of the time we seem to have
things together, but just haven't been able to exe
cute on the finish and actually score the goal."
Senior midfielder Ally Marquand and junior
forward Natalie Sanderson have done an ad
mirable job picking up some of the slack offensive
ly. Sanderson has come on particularly strong as of
late, scoring the game-winning goal in last week
end's double-overtime win against St. Mary's. She
also added a goal in Stanford's dominating 6-1 vic
tory over San Francisco.
Marquand has been a consistent attacker for the
Cardinal all season. While she has only two goals to
show for her efforts, she leads the team in shots.
Moreover, it was Marquand who got the ball rolling
in Stanford's offensive explosion last week against
the Lady Dons.
In her gutsy performance, she scored the first
Cardinal goal, just three minutes into the match
and despite feeling pain in her right leg after a hard
sideline collision, she was able to re-enter the game
in the second half and record an assist.
That type of persistence will be necessary if the
Cardinal is to win tonight. While The players and
circumstances surrounding the match may be dif
ferent than last year, but the intensity of both
school has not changed.
"It's going to be a really tough match," Ratcliffe
said. "TTiey are a perennially tough team. We're
going to have to be ready to play."
