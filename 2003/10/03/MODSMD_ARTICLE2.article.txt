# Frosh alcohol policy heavily enforced
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
A campus crackdown on drinking has
made the alcohol policy a subject of con
tention once again, as an addition to the policy
preventing freshman dormitories from serving
alcohol at house events has come into effect.
Events in the past few weeks suggest that
while the changes to the policy itself are rela
tively minor, Residential Education's vigi
lance in enforcing the policy has increased.
"The alcohol policy is exactly the same as it
was last year," said Jane Camarillo, director of
Res Ed. "The addition of the application to
that policy is that all-frosh houses are not al
lowed to serve alcohol at their events and was
put into effect this academic year."
Over the past two weeks, administrators
have exhibited low tolerance of violations of
the policy, for upperclassmen as well as fresh
men.

On Sept. 25, Xanadu, 680 Lomita and
Theta Delta Chi became the first campus or
ganizations this year to be placed on social
probation when they violated the rules of the
University's alcohol policy during New Stu
dent Orientation.
Also, "Senior Pub Night" was recently re
named "Senior Night." Stricter ED checking at
the bars and steeper, $100 fines for fomiting
on the Marguerite have been implemented to
discourage students from excessive drinking.
This week, the University attempted to re
voke the housing of Roble freshman Donny
Bridges, who threw parties where fellow fresh
men could buy and drink alcohol. (After ap
pealing the University's decision, Bridges is
close to being allowed to return to Roble, he
said.)
Camarillo explained the administration's
course of action.
"We do not have the luxury of 'singling out'
or 'attempting to scapegoat' anyone who is

found in misconduct," she said. "Our goal is to
be educational when possible but to hold stu
dents accountable for the consequences of
their behavior."
But while administrators are becoming
more stringent in enforcing the policy, some
students seem to be slipping through the
cracks of the crackdown.
J.J. Garton, a freshman in Otero, said that
no one he knew had dared to break the major
rule of the new policy: no drinking in the
lounges. But he said students still throw par
ties in their rooms.
"I haven't seen anyone try to drink in the
common rooms," he said. "If we had parties in
the lounges, they'd tell us to take it upstairs."
Some wonder what "taking it upstairs" ac
complishes. Often out of sight of resident as
sistants and peer health educators, some fresh
men host parties in their rooms that are just as
big as those that would normally be held

downstairs.
"You can have 20 people in a room, some
times even 40 people if it spills into the halls,
and no one has a problem," Garton said. "RAs
know what's going on and they don't care. We
know we're not supposed to have parties in the
halls, but sometimes they go into the halls any
way and no one has a problem."
Garton said that room parties have many
disadvantages.
"We spend a lot of time going in and out of
rooms," he said. "It makes it harder to actual
ly get stuff done in your room. It would work
out a lot better if we could all hang out down
stairs. Plus, it's more fun, because there's a
dance floor a few feet away."
Another anonymous Otero freshman
agreed that the residential staff hasn't been
strict about adhering to the rules.
"The RAs aren't busting us for having par
ties in our rooms," he said. "They're more con

cerned with just keeping everyone safe."
Freshmen in search of a dance floor are
going other places to get their groove on.
"Most of the parties seem to be at frats,"
said Garton. "I have a lot of upperclassmen
friends who can get me into frat parties. You
can get alcohol there."
Interpreting the new clause, which forbids
freshmen to host alcohol-serving parties in
dorm common rooms, has proven difficult for
students and resident assistants.
Senior Robin Gibbons, an RA in Fresh
man / Sophomore College, said the new rule is
somewhat difficult to interpret because that
dorm houses sophomores as well as freshmen.
But she said things are nonetheless going well.
"We've told the freshmen, 'This is the poli
cy, you are under 21,'" she said. "The policy is
clear to them now. It's not our job to be po
licemen and that hasn't been our role.
And while I'm not really sure how it
will work out, all I can say now is, so
far, so good."
A question-and-answer form dis
tributed to residential staff last year
attempted to clarify the clause.
"If a student sponsors a party in
their room and they are choosing to
serve alcohol irresponsibly with no

concern as the social host packing the
hallways with students, the residential
staff would be expected to close that
down," it reads.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni said there has been
no change to the underage drinking
policy.
"If a student attends a fraternity
party or any other party and is under
the legal drinking age, he or she
should not be served alcohol," he said.
"House staff must work with the Of
fice of Student Activities and Greek
Life to ensure they comply with party
planning guidelines."

Laura Wilson, head of public safe
ty at Stanford, has a positive outlook
on the beginning of this year.
"It does appear that there have
been fewer freshmen involved in alco
hol-related incidents," she said.
She said that she believes fewer
freshmen have had to be taken to
the hospital for alcohol-related
reasons.
Jameson Haslam, a freshman in
Soto, a four-class dorm, said the
drinking he has seen in dorm rooms
hasn't gotten out of hand.
"People who live in all-freshman
dorms definitely still drink in their

rooms," he said. "But I visited the
school last year, and I get the sense
that there is significantly less drinking
in freshman dorms now. You don't
see empty tequila bottles every
where."
Haslam, who doesn't drink him
self, said he doesn't feel the impact of
the addition to the alcohol policy.
"I find the school's still pretty le
nient," he said. "I think that, overall,
Stanford provides good resources for
safe alcohol consumption, like 5-
SURE, for example. They've also
spent a lot of time educating us on the
new policy."

hasn't gotten out of hand.
"People who live in all-freshman
dorms definitely still drink in their

rooms," he said. "But I visited the
school last year, and I get the sense
that there is significantly less drinking
in freshman dorms now. You don't
see empty tequila bottles every
where."
Haslam, who doesn't drink him
self, said he doesn't feel the impact of
the addition to the alcohol policy.
"I find the school's still pretty le
nient," he said. "I think that, overall,
Stanford provides good resources for
safe alcohol consumption, like 5-
SURE, for example. They've also
spent a lot of time educating us on the
new policy."
A campus crackdown on drinking has
made the alcohol policy a subject of con
tention once again, as an addition to the policy
preventing freshman dormitories from serving
alcohol at house events has come into effect.
Events in the past few weeks suggest that
while the changes to the policy itself are rela
tively minor, Residential Education's vigi
lance in enforcing the policy has increased.
"The alcohol policy is exactly the same as it
was last year," said Jane Camarillo, director of
Res Ed. "The addition of the application to
that policy is that all-frosh houses are not al
lowed to serve alcohol at their events and was
put into effect this academic year."
Over the past two weeks, administrators
have exhibited low tolerance of violations of
the policy, for upperclassmen as well as fresh
men.

On Sept. 25, Xanadu, 680 Lomita and
Theta Delta Chi became the first campus or
ganizations this year to be placed on social
probation when they violated the rules of the
University's alcohol policy during New Stu
dent Orientation.
Also, "Senior Pub Night" was recently re
named "Senior Night." Stricter ED checking at
the bars and steeper, $100 fines for fomiting
on the Marguerite have been implemented to
discourage students from excessive drinking.
This week, the University attempted to re
voke the housing of Roble freshman Donny
Bridges, who threw parties where fellow fresh
men could buy and drink alcohol. (After ap
pealing the University's decision, Bridges is
close to being allowed to return to Roble, he
said.)
Camarillo explained the administration's
course of action.
"We do not have the luxury of 'singling out'
or 'attempting to scapegoat' anyone who is

found in misconduct," she said. "Our goal is to
be educational when possible but to hold stu
dents accountable for the consequences of
their behavior."
But while administrators are becoming
more stringent in enforcing the policy, some
students seem to be slipping through the
cracks of the crackdown.
J.J. Garton, a freshman in Otero, said that
no one he knew had dared to break the major
rule of the new policy: no drinking in the
lounges. But he said students still throw par
ties in their rooms.
"I haven't seen anyone try to drink in the
common rooms," he said. "If we had parties in
the lounges, they'd tell us to take it upstairs."
Some wonder what "taking it upstairs" ac
complishes. Often out of sight of resident as
sistants and peer health educators, some fresh
men host parties in their rooms that are just as
big as those that would normally be held

downstairs.
"You can have 20 people in a room, some
times even 40 people if it spills into the halls,
and no one has a problem," Garton said. "RAs
know what's going on and they don't care. We
know we're not supposed to have parties in the
halls, but sometimes they go into the halls any
way and no one has a problem."
Garton said that room parties have many
disadvantages.
"We spend a lot of time going in and out of
rooms," he said. "It makes it harder to actual
ly get stuff done in your room. It would work
out a lot better if we could all hang out down
stairs. Plus, it's more fun, because there's a
dance floor a few feet away."
Another anonymous Otero freshman
agreed that the residential staff hasn't been
strict about adhering to the rules.
"The RAs aren't busting us for having par
ties in our rooms," he said. "They're more con

cerned with just keeping everyone safe."
Freshmen in search of a dance floor are
going other places to get their groove on.
"Most of the parties seem to be at frats,"
said Garton. "I have a lot of upperclassmen
friends who can get me into frat parties. You
can get alcohol there."
Interpreting the new clause, which forbids
freshmen to host alcohol-serving parties in
dorm common rooms, has proven difficult for
students and resident assistants.
Senior Robin Gibbons, an RA in Fresh
man / Sophomore College, said the new rule is
somewhat difficult to interpret because that
dorm houses sophomores as well as freshmen.
But she said things are nonetheless going well.
"We've told the freshmen, 'This is the poli
cy, you are under 21,'" she said. "The policy is
clear to them now. It's not our job to be po
licemen and that hasn't been our role.
And while I'm not really sure how it
will work out, all I can say now is, so
far, so good."
A question-and-answer form dis
tributed to residential staff last year
attempted to clarify the clause.
"If a student sponsors a party in
their room and they are choosing to
serve alcohol irresponsibly with no

concern as the social host packing the
hallways with students, the residential
staff would be expected to close that
down," it reads.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni said there has been
no change to the underage drinking
policy.
"If a student attends a fraternity
party or any other party and is under
the legal drinking age, he or she
should not be served alcohol," he said.
"House staff must work with the Of
fice of Student Activities and Greek
Life to ensure they comply with party
planning guidelines."

Laura Wilson, head of public safe
ty at Stanford, has a positive outlook
on the beginning of this year.
"It does appear that there have
been fewer freshmen involved in alco
hol-related incidents," she said.
She said that she believes fewer
freshmen have had to be taken to
the hospital for alcohol-related
reasons.
Jameson Haslam, a freshman in
Soto, a four-class dorm, said the
drinking he has seen in dorm rooms
hasn't gotten out of hand.
"People who live in all-freshman
dorms definitely still drink in their

rooms," he said. "But I visited the
