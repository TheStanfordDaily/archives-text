# Frosh alcohol policy heavily enforced
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
A campus crackdown on drinking has
made the alcohol policy a subject of con
tention once again, as an addition to the policy
preventing freshman dormitories from serving
alcohol at house events has come into effect.
Events in the past few weeks suggest that
while the changes to the policy itself are rela
tively minor, Residential Education's vigi
lance in enforcing the policy has increased.
"The alcohol policy is exactly the same as it
was last year," said Jane Camarillo, director of
Res Ed. "The addition of the application to
that policy is that all-frosh houses are not al
lowed to serve alcohol at their events and was
put into effect this academic year."
Over the past two weeks, administrators
have exhibited low tolerance of violations of
the policy, for upperclassmen as well as fresh
men.

On Sept. 25, Xanadu, 680 Lomita and
Theta Delta Chi became the first campus or
ganizations this year to be placed on social
probation when they violated the rules of the
University's alcohol policy during New Stu
dent Orientation.
Also, "Senior Pub Night" was recently re
named "Senior Night." Stricter ED checking at
the bars and steeper, $100 fines for fomiting
on the Marguerite have been implemented to
discourage students from excessive drinking.
This week, the University attempted to re
voke the housing of Roble freshman Donny
Bridges, who threw parties where fellow fresh
men could buy and drink alcohol. (After ap
pealing the University's decision, Bridges is
close to being allowed to return to Roble, he
said.)
Camarillo explained the administration's
course of action.
"We do not have the luxury of 'singling out'
or 'attempting to scapegoat' anyone who is

found in misconduct," she said. "Our goal is to
be educational when possible but to hold stu
dents accountable for the consequences of
their behavior."
But while administrators are becoming
more stringent in enforcing the policy, some
students seem to be slipping through the
cracks of the crackdown.
J.J. Garton, a freshman in Otero, said that
no one he knew had dared to break the major
rule of the new policy: no drinking in the
lounges. But he said students still throw par
ties in their rooms.
"I haven't seen anyone try to drink in the
common rooms," he said. "If we had parties in
the lounges, they'd tell us to take it upstairs."
Some wonder what "taking it upstairs" ac
complishes. Often out of sight of resident as
sistants and peer health educators, some fresh
men host parties in their rooms that are just as
big as those that would normally be held

downstairs.
"You can have 20 people in a room, some
times even 40 people if it spills into the halls,
and no one has a problem," Garton said. "RAs
know what's going on and they don't care. We
know we're not supposed to have parties in the
halls, but sometimes they go into the halls any
way and no one has a problem."
Garton said that room parties have many
disadvantages.
"We spend a lot of time going in and out of
rooms," he said. "It makes it harder to actual
ly get stuff done in your room. It would work
out a lot better if we could all hang out down
stairs. Plus, it's more fun, because there's a
dance floor a few feet away."
Another anonymous Otero freshman
agreed that the residential staff hasn't been
strict about adhering to the rules.
"The RAs aren't busting us for having par
ties in our rooms," he said. "They're more con

cerned with just keeping everyone safe."
Freshmen in search of a dance floor are
going other places to get their groove on.
"Most of the parties seem to be at frats,"
said Garton. "I have a lot of upperclassmen
friends who can get me into frat parties. You
can get alcohol there."
Interpreting the new clause, which forbids
freshmen to host alcohol-serving parties in
dorm common rooms, has proven difficult for
students and resident assistants.
Senior Robin Gibbons, an RA in Fresh
man / Sophomore College, said the new rule is
somewhat difficult to interpret because that
dorm houses sophomores as well as freshmen.
But she said things are nonetheless going well.
"We've told the freshmen, 'This is the poli
cy, you are under 21,'" she said. "The policy is
clear to them now. It's not our job to be po
