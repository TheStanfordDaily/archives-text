# Rep explains high Bookstore prices
## 
### JEFF SHEN 
Logging on to Amazon.com, students
will likely discover lower prices than those
found at the Stanford Bookstore, even with
the 7 percent student discount.
Amazon.com sells all the books assigned
for IHUM 52, Love and Deception, for
$46.31, while the bookstore's price is $10
higher, with the discount.
Students are often surprised that the
University doesn't offer better prices than
its top competitor.
In fact, the Stanford Bookstore is not
managed by the University, but rather run
by Follett Higher Education Group, which
manages approximately 580 university
bookstores in 48 states.
"The University has never run the Book
store," according to history professor David
Kennedy, who chairs the Bookstore's board
of directors. "For just over 100 years, it was
owned and operated by an [independent]
corporation called 'The Stanford Book
store,' which leased space on campus from
the University."
The bookstore has been forced to change
with the tides of both technology and mar
ket prices.
"The Board of that entity decided in the
1990s that a unitary chain like ours could not
effectively compete in a world dominated by
discount sellers and online retailers,"

Kennedy said. "We put out the management
contract, which stipulated several condi
tions such as level of inventory, and had of
fers from several parties."
Follett won the 10-year lease, which ends
in 2009.
Jef Friedel, sales and marketing manager
for the bookstore, worked at the Bookstore
before Follett took the reins.
"The administration works more
smoothly and efficiently," he said. "Fol
lett streamlined.the leadership and added
a director as well as some upper manage
ment. The relationship has worked well,
and other than that discrepancy, the cur
rent Bookstore looks much like the old
one."
He said that Follett kept many of the em
ployees and policies that governed the
Bookstore, and regular employees are still
hired through the same human resources
department.
The more germane question for students
is, why are prices higher than online retailers?
"Textbook companies fix the selling
price for us," Friedel said. "We do not tam
per with that stipulation; at the same time,
we do not charge beyond what price is set.
Textbook companies also specify at what
price we can buy books back."
Despite the heavy competition from
large online booksellers, Friedel said he be
lieves the bookstore is still the most handy

source of texts for Stanford students.
"Online companies do not necessarily
offer a better shopping experience," he said.
"Our location is far more convenient for stu
dents, we are frequently in contact with fac
ulty members and can flexibly order specific

products, and we buy back used books for
students."
According to Friedel, Follett offers a
large inventory for the bookstore, ordered
management and unique expertise on top of
the security that comes with being managed

by a large, specialized organization.
"I believe that the University has been
reasonably well satisfied, as has the Board of
the Former Bookstore, which has moni
tored and advised on the transition,"
Kennedy said.

The Stanford Bookstore is currently under the ownership of the Follett Higher Education Company. Due to high inventory, the Bookstore
often has to charge more for texts than online booksellers such as Amazon.com.
