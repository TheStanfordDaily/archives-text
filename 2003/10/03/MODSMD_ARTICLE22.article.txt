# Concert Network is music to campus ears
## 
### JASON CHEN 
Concerts at the CoHo, classical performances
at Campbell Recital Hall and even the infamous
Stanford Band appearances are all fixtures in the
campus music scene. Every week, almost with
out exception, students can choose from a host
of musical events.
What makes the music scene at Stanford so
diverse is that it is not entirely limited to student
involvement. The University's music and drama
departments are heavily involved in planning
many musical art events on campus, such as
tonight's "Friends of Music Faculty Showcase"
and the "James Joyce Is Dead And S6 Is Paris:
The Lucia Joyce Cabaret."
The Stanford Concert Network is responsible
for bringing musical groups from the outside
world to the Stanford bubble. Formerly a special
project of the ASSU, the SCN is now an indepen
• dent organization that SCN Director Niki Carelli
explains was "created for the explicit purpose of
bringing off-campus music on-campus."

Funded by a combination of ASSU special
fees, event revenues and the occasional sponsor
ship by other Stanford student organizations,
SCN has successfully managed to bring to cam
pus such popular groups as Vendetta Red,
Something Corporate and The Juliana Theory in
the past. According to Carelli, a junior, SCN se
lects bands by looking "into artists who are cur
rently popular and those who specifically appeal
to college crowds.
"We also solicit requests from students with
regards to bands they would like to see," she
added.
Although SCN is still fleshing out the details
of its larger shows for this year, it has already
scheduled a number of outside bands for smaller
CoHo performances in upcoming weeks, includ
ing Paradigm, the Fingers, Ron Jeremy Explo
sion and Slight.
SCN is not the only place to turn for on-cam
pus music entertainment. Although it does make
some efforts to reach out to Stanford's on-cam
pus student band community by scheduling

CoHo open-mike nights, many student bands at
Stanford plan their own independent appear
ances as well.
Often, student bands give private perfor
mances, partnering with a fraternity, cultural
club or other student group.
"Fraternities and row houses routinely book
bands and DJs to play at parties and other social
gatherings," said senior Jeff Mancuso, house
manager at 680 Lomita. "The DJs we book are
most often students, and bands are generally stu
dent bands as well. This helps create a music
scene on campus by letting friends play and gives
exposure to on-campus acts."
Sophomore drummer Ben Grant of the band
David Baron Element said though "this year's
graduating class took with it a couple of the main
bandleaders on campus, there are plenty left - 2
Mikes from Jersey and the Exit 9 Band, Lesser
Known, Relapse, Sinister Dexter and David
Baron Element, to name a few. These bands
should be playing regularly at least during some
quarters this year."
