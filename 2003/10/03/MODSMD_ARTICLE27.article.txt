# Editor's note: This issue of Intermission rocks
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Inspired by my undying (yet semi-secret) love for a cer
tain music professor, whose identity shall not be revealed, we
— the editors — give you "The Rock Issue." When we first
discussed the idea, I expressed my infatuation with this pro
fessor and proposed an interview, to which Karan remarked
that it would be "great in a stalkerish sort of way." Unde
terred, I finally convinced Karan that this interview was just
what Intermission needed — and that he should do it. Young
lovers can be so shy.
Here in these pages, you will find your guide to all things
rock: movies, clothes and, most importantly, music. From the

hip edginess of Fischerspooner to the whining of Rufus Wain
wright, we bring you the very best of the music scene's latest
offerings. Punk goes pop as we look at the evolution of cloth
ing, and music hits the big screen with some of the cinema's
best forays into rock story-telling (sadly none of the KISS
movies made the list). We also bring you up to date on the
coolest bands to catch in concert. Thus, calling it "The Rock
Issue" was simply a no-brainer, like having a frat-party
themed frat party.
Issues like this make me proud to say that I work for
Intermission, a job so rewarding that I am happy to do it
week after week, even though it means I have crushed my
dad's dream that I become a professional golfer (I am in
no way kidding about this). More importantly, issues like

this make me proud to have this job because it keeps me
one step further away from having to sell my eggs on the
black market.
As a big music fan myself, I try to get as close to the music
scene as possible, knowing many people in the industry person
ally, and hanging out with musicians who tend to write more po
etic verses (sample: "I have this burning sensation / when I pee
/ I'm pretty sure/ you gave it to me"). I also spend an exorbitant
amount of free time coming up with band names (best so far:
"Spontaneous Combustion," "Happy Trap" and "The Guera
Phenomenon"). So, I invite you — in the immortal words of
Limp Bizkit — to take a look around. This issue is sure to have
you singing, "I want to rock and roll all night — and party every
day!" And this we highly encourage.
