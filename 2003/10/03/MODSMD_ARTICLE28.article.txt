# Denzel makes good 'Time'
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
I've seen too many movies in which the entire cast seems to
have it in for the main character. One moment, the plot seems
to be progressing — only to be derailed with the sudden reve
lation that every supporting character has been part of some
larger con, a mass conspiracy against the hero designed for no
other purpose than to give the audience that obligatory "A-
Ha!" moment. Carl Franklin's "Out of Time," thankfully, is not
one of those films.
Rather, "Out of Time" is a Godsend in today's storm of
over-constructed thrillers. Denzel Washington plays
Matthias Whitlock, a small-town police chief in
volved in an extramarital affair with a local woman
named Anne Merai Harrison (Sanaa Lathan). Not
only is Anne Merai married to an abusive ex-foot
ball player (Dean Cain, of "Lois & Clark: The New
Adventures of Superman," who seems to equate
growing a beard with character development), but
she also has cancer.
And, if that's not enough, she will soon be giving
her husband reason to collect on the million dollar
life insurance policy he took out a few years ago. (With me?
Good. Let's move on.) Because she does not love her husband,
and falls for Police Chief Whitlock, Anne Merai names him as
the new beneficiary of her life insurance, and for reasons known
only to himself Whitlock decides to give her the $400,000 his of
fice acquired in a recent drug bust, presumably so that the two
lovers can run off together for one final fling.

When the woman disappears with
the cash and her house is burned down
with two bodies inside it, Whitlock is
left to cover for himself. The missing
money, his affair with'Anne Merai and
his new potential windfall with the life
insurance all make him the prime sus
pect. Basically, Whitlock must cover
up his own tracks from law enforce
ment while trying to solve the mystery
on his own. To make things even more
interesting, the homi
cide detective assigned
to the case is Whit
lock's estranged wife,
played by Eva Mendes
(current It-girl of the
Maxim set and tempo
rary bearer of the im
probably hot female
cop role). Watching
these two very differ
ent actors pretend to
be a couple elicits the slightest of
cringe — Mendes's curves don't hold
a candlestick to Denzel's grizzled,
throbbing screen presence — but the

movie wisely concerns itself more with Whitlock's impending
doom than his relationships.
Again, Washington proves to be one of today's most charis

matic actors. His character winds up performing some inexplic
ably bone-headed actions to milk more suspense out of the plot,
but we're still willing to follow because no one can convey sweat
and urgency like a worked-up Denzel.



Don't turn that corner!!!
