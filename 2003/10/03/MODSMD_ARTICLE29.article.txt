# Nothing is 'Lost in Translation'
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
"Lost in Translation" opens with an artis
tically-composed shot of Scarlett Johansson's
ass. She wears pink panties, and the effect is
strangely calming. Lying still before us like a
soft, inviting pillow, Johansson's ass exempli
fies writer-director Sofia Coppola's ability to
turn a titillating image into something else en
tirely.
The bright lights of Tokyo turn dreamy
beneath a lilting soundtrack. A scene in a
strip club plays like a visit to the museum.
Coppola at times seems to have systematical
ly drained her movie of excitement; it's no
wonder all the characters want to do is
sleep.
After the fifth scene of Jo
hansson moping silently in her
hotel room, you might want to do
that too. But resist. "Lost in
Translation" is worth staying up
for.
Bill Murray carries the film.
He plays Bob Harris, an actor vis
iting Tokyo to shoot a whiskey
commercial. His marriage isn't
what it once was, neither is his career, and all he
finds in the bustling Asian metropolis is bewil
derment and jet lag.
Much in the same boat is Charlotte (Johans
son), a young Yale graduate tagging along on
her husband's photo tour. She doesn't know
what she wants to do with her life, and her hus
band John (Giovanni Ribisi) is too busy to
offer much help, so it's no wonder she and Bob
end up spending a lot of time together.
Not all of this is time well spent: A number
of scenes feature Charlotte and Bob discover
ing played-out culture shocks. The Japanese
switch their l's and r's when speaking Eng
lish? And they like raw food? Quick, call
"National Geographic." However, as these
shocks accumulate we begin to see the point.
Stuck in a reputedly fascinating place, the
pair fails to be fascinated, and it is this failure

that unites them. They need something more
than a new locale to restore meaning to their
lives.

As you might expect, that something is
each other. What you might not expect, how
ever, is the subtlety and restraint with which
Coppola unravels this fact. Here again she ap
plies skilled directorial touches, and the result
is astonishing: What could be a whirlwind fling
becomes a relationship whose effects, we
sense, will last far beyond Tokyo.
Take the bedroom scene. Spoiler alert: You
will not see sex in this movie. Instead, you will
see Bob reaching for Charlotte as they fall
asleep â€” and softly tapping her foot with his
finger.
In this gesture, we see all the
tenderness Bob's been unable to
express in his life at home. Char
lotte reminds him of his capacity
for gentleness. In turn, he acts as
her mentor, reassuring her that
her lack of direction is neither ab
normal nor dire.
The relationship gives Bill
Murray an opportunity to temper
his usual humor with a wise
sweetness; he's had years of ex
perience since "Groundhog Day," and it
shows. Johansson is less successful, however,
pouting and lounging so much you sometimes
wonder if she was raised by sloths. But as she
banters with Murray, her face lights up with a
playful beauty you pity her husband John for
missing.
"Lost in Translation" is a rebirth for both
its principals, but it is a quiet sort of rebirth.
The film is shot almost entirely at twilight,
and this position between night and day is a
symbolic one. The characters have left their
former lives, but haven't quite arrived in
new ones.
An arrival of sorts does take place at the end
of the film, and it's a bit of disappointment. I'll
play the coy reviewer and say only this: Coppo
la's done such a good job with dawn that we're
unprepared for morning.
