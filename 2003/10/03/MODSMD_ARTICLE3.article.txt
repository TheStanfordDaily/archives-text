# Sally Ride to speak at science fest
## 
### HENRY BRIDGE 
Stanford alumna Sally Ride will deliver a
speech Sunday to open the Sally Ride Science Fes
tival, which aims to encourage pre-teen girls to
pursue careers in the sciences. Informational
workshops for girls, parents and teachers will also
be hosted throughout the day.
The festival will kick off with a street fair, reg
istration and lunch at 11:30 a.m. at Lomita Mall,
followed by Ride's keynote address at 12:45 p.m.
Girls in grades 5 through 8 can choose from a
full variety of themed workshops in subjects rang
ing from veterinary science to aviation, from plan
etary science to oceanology. Workshop presenters
will include Stanford faculty members and em
ployees from local organizations such as Hewlett
Packard and the American Heritage Museum.
"It's always been a passion of her's to bring sci
ence to girls because women are underrepresent
ed in the sciences," said Toni Dmartino, Ride's

publicity manager.
Workshops for adults include "Science Re
sources for Your Daughter," "We've Come a
Long Way, Baby, or Have We? Gender Equity,"
"How to Prepare for College" and "Hands On Sci
ence for the Classroom." Festival coordinators

hope to emphasize the importance of teacher and
parent support in keeping young girls active in the
sciences.

Upon completing her PhD in 1978,
Ride responded to an advertise

After eight years at NASA,
Ride returned to Stanford as a sci

ternational Security and Arms
Control for two years before be

Space Institute and a Professor of
Physics at the University of Cali
fornia, San Diego.
She currently divides her time
between teaching, researching
non-linear beam wave interac
tions and running a company
named Imaginary Lines, which
provides products and programs
to fuel young girls' scientific inter
ests.
Admission to the festival for
both adults and children is $18 in
