# Fischerspooner: Twisted and on the rise
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fischerspooner is a Lou Perlman
wet dream in drag. The group, com
prised of the electro-pop-making duo
of Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner,
are the anti-indie alternative boy band
that took New York City's hipper
than-thou art scene by storm three
years ago. But their brand of perfor
mance art is not your typical Vito
Aconcci masturbation scene or Yoko
Ono solo piece (apparently Yoko was
quite the avant-garde artist before she
got too busy breaking up the Beatles).
Save for the requisite element of audi
ence participation, Fischerspooner
shows lack of all stereotypical art per
formance pretension.
Fischerspooner's shows highlight
and glorify the shallowness of their dig
ital pop, and the lip-synched, choreo
graphed, pulsating glitz that results is
too impossibly tasty to resist. The total
audio-visual experience of Fischer
spooner is club-drug-sexy, but without
the dehydration: Fischerspooner is
bigger than ecstasy.
But how can this unabashedly er
satz group — armed with iBooks,
elaborate posturing and glitter explo
sives — possibly be the underground,
Manhattan art world darlings every
one says they are? Their paradoxical,
on-the-surface success makes Fischer
spooner more like Andy Warhol than
the Dandy Warhols could ever hope to
be.

Now on tour promoting last February's U.S. release of
"#1," and celebrating their general fabulousness, the
boys are working hard to bring the party to you. Last
month, I spoke to Warren Fischer over the phone about
San Francisco (they've played the Fillmore three times in
the last six months), reality TV, Europeans and the fu
ture of Fischerspooner.
Intermission: You have a special dedication to New York
City in the "#1" liner notes, is that where you're from?
Warren Fischer: I was actually born in Los Angeles, born
and bred actually.
INT: So is it true that once you live in New York City, you
can't live anywhere else?
WF: Hmm, maybe that's kind of true. But I like a lot of
cities; San Francisco looks so beautiful, I'd love to live there,
(pause) I just realized after I said that that you're writing for
the Bay Area, so that was a completely honest response.
I also love Rome and Venice, but the thing about Euro
pean cities is that they're very touristy. Venice, for example,
is filled with tourists. It's kind of sad. What's so great about
New York City is that it's in its prime. San Francisco and
New York are working cities.
INT: What's on your playlist right now?
WF: Let's see, Supertramp's "Crime of the Century,"
LCD, Sound System, the usual stuff — The Beatles' "Magic
Mystery Tour," Missy Elliot's first album, what's that
called?
INT: (speaking really quickly) "Supa Dupa Fly"
WF: Right, "Supa Duper Fly." Or is it "Super Dupa Fly?"
There's an "upa" somewhere in there.
INT: (speaking slower) I think it's "Supa Dupa." What if
it were "Super Duper Fly?" That sounds so bad. Anything
out recently that you like?
WF: The new Yeah Yeah Yeahs CD. I really like

"Maps," it's very romantic, sweet pop.
INT: You've described your music as "post-Napster."
Could you elaborate on that?
WF: We say we're post-Napster in that we were able to
cobble together a grassroots following and this internation
al media empire out of our 200 square-foot apartment in
New York. It's really about how it affected the business side
of things, and of course with the digital technology too. All
our songs were made on laptops, so it's inherent in the de
velopment of technology — it's a statement about the ex
pressive nature of technology.
INT: What should people expect at a Fischerspooner
concert?
WF: A mind-expanding spectacular that will take you on
a journey from the dawn of man to the end of creation. Or
just a lame pop show. One or the other. It depends on your
pH balance that day.
INT: What's your role in the show?
WF: Oh, I stay in the back and work on the machines.
Casey does more of the performance stuff. It's a master / ser
vant kind of a thing. It's pretty clear — I'm not physically on
stage jumping around. And all the performers are spent
pieces of performance trash by the end.
INT: You've done a lot of performances in gallery space,
which makes me think of the Happenings and John Cage,
not glittery explosions and smoke machines. Are you delib
erately trying to break the performance art stereotype?
WF: We love the art world, but the project was not nec
essarily designed for the art world. We were not imagining
that when we started out, but the art world really picked up *
on it, about the reasons why we were doing it. I think there's
something conceptually complicated about what your rea
sons are about making an over-the-top entertaining show.
We gave them a unique perspective. They liked that.
Were we trying to break boundaries? No, but I think
when I stare off in the horizon and rub my chin, I have new
ideas in mind. There's something very belabored about per

formance art — generally it's
about people using their bodies to
express personal issues or making
a statement about the nature of
art. But there's something more
celebratory about what we are
doing, which is unique because
performance art — no offense —
is not entertaining as a rule. We
want to be complicated yet enter
taining. We're not like a four-hour
John Cage piece. We're a new
piece.
INT: How crucial do you think
the performance, the visual expe
rience, is to-your music? Do you
think art and music are married
forever?
WF: I do, I do. I think music
clearly exists without it, but you
control more of the way people
perceive what you're making if
you present them with more in
formation to combine it with, like
David Bowie, for example. Hav
ing that image there while you lis
ten to his CD adds something to
the experience, even with the
Beatles. I mean, there's a visible
component to music. You don't
have to have it, but you get more
of a well-rounded picture, more
information from the artist. We
wouldn't get the same response,
for instance, if we looked like
N*SYNC.

INT: "#1" was released and promoted in Europe before
it got to the States. How were the European audiences?
WF: Every audience has its own flavor, but I never know
if it's the people or what they've heard about us. Some peo
ple just have different expectations.
Our first performance was in Berlin, and they were very
warm, very accepting, very excited, open minded, partly be
cause of the good press coverage there. With the English, on
the other hand, the Londoners are freaky sorts, they either
say you're the new Jesus Christ or you're Satan. They either
hate you Or they love you, which is great.
INT: Tell me some crazy Europe stories.
WF: (laughs) Well, how much time do you have?!
We did a weekend of shows in Berlin at this nightclub
during Love Parade, which is completely crazy — just
nonstop DJs and music. It's totally claustrophobic, and
a little annoying, because you can't escape a beat for like
a minute.
The first year we did it we had to play Sunday at 4 a.m.,
and we thought, "Oh no, this is going to be totally lame. They
gave us the loser slot." So we show up, and it's a frenzy — it's
the peak of the show. I guess midnight there is like the early
bird special.
We always like to include mistakes and problems in our
shows. People never know if it's a mistake or if it's staged,
which we do a lot... People fall down, they get hurt, stuff
breaks. It's a great way to frustrate the audience. The song
stops, starts, stops, starts, you know.
So we're right at the end of the show, and Casey had
worked the crowd into a lather — and then we blew the
sound system, and the audience goes silent. All of a sudden
there's no music in their world, and they're wondering if it's
staged or not.
INT: Are you surprised by the amount of positive atten
tion you've received?
WF: Hmm, let's see — I could say "No, I'm not surprised
at all," and come off as really arrogant, or I could say, "Yes,
we didn't expect it, we had no idea." Yeah, OK, I'll go with
that one. No, really, we thought it would live and die in New
York City.


Don't you wish these were Santa's elves?
