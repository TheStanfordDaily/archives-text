Celine Dion
Aerosmith. Poison. Whitesnake. Def Leopard. Celine Dion: What do all these artists have
in common? That's right, the power ballad. Transcending genre and public image, the power
ballad made it OK for even the hardest, most badass rocker to cry. And if it's tears you want,
there's no place better to be than at a Celine Dion concert.
I experienced the phenomenon of "Celine Dion: Live at Caesar's Palace" last April, and it
was an absolute extravaganza, marked by the kind of gross lavishness that only Las Vegas can
provide. Musical instruments flew through the air, gigantic roses appeared to bloom on cue,
Cirque du Soleil contortionists twirled in the background, and, of course, Celine ROCKED ...
the power ballad.
From cult classics like "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" and "Because You Loved Me,"
to her latest hit and Chrysler jingle, "I Drove All Night," Celine belted out an impressive med
ley of tunes. True to power ballad form, she repeated many a chorus and stretched out key words
like "you" and*"me" and "love" over syllables and octaves, shaking the seats with her emotion
al timbre.
Celine displayed a combination of vocal acrobatics and boundless energy — something that
any self-respecting hair metal band on speed would envy. She tirelessly jumped from one Top
40 single to another, taking breaks only to speak to the audience.
"I truly love you," she whispered. And in that moment, like a 40-something housewife lis
tening to Foreigner croon, "I want to know what love is, I want you to shooow me," I let a tear
roll down my cheek and believed her.

The Locust
Not to sound
like an obnoxious
music snob, but it's
damn near impossible
to pin down my best
rock experience. If I
counted all the ticket
stubs and faded memo
ries, my attendance
record would put me
around a solid 99 rock
shows (give or take a
few fuzzy memories);
and that's a lot of ciga
rette smoke, boot
stomping chants of
"ENCORE!" and bro
ken guitar neck memo
ries to wade through.
However, one evening
back in Detroit stands
out as epitomizing all
the nihilism, exuber
ance and "Behind the
Music" self-destruc
tion rock has to offer.
The band was The Lo
cust.
If you've never
seen the Locust per
form live, then the
physical and mental
outer limits of your
sensory capabilities

have never really been put to the test. The noise-shock band encourages fans to dress in cos
tumes and bring props for throwing: This show featured three synchronized swimmers in full
swim gear, white boys in afros and platform shoes, and a troupe of kids in mustaches and work
out short shorts. I wore a Mexican wrestling mask and could barely see anything as the crowd in
front of the tiny stage whipped around like a sweaty, maelstrom of seething punks. This freak
ish amphetamine sideshow of guitar, drums and Moog synthesizer assaults could only be sus
tained for 35 minutes before everyone present collapsed out onto the dirty sidewalks of Rosa
Parks Boulevard. Like jumping out of an airplane or being chased by a stampeding bull, this rock
show blew my mind and reminded me what it means to feel alive.

Sigur Ros
I hadn't planned on going. I wasn't really into the band. I had found their CDs pretentious
and boring — and I would never have stepped onto the Caltrain if I hadn't inherited a free press
pass from fellow Intermission writer Jennie Kim. So, because I was utterly disinterested, I
earned the right to sit bang in the front row of the Paramount Theatre in Oakland and to subse
quently drown myself in the greatest performance — visual or aural — I have ever witnessed in
my life. My skepticism was murdered and left bleeding like the rest of rock 'n' roll.
Iceland's Sigur Ros is not a minimalist outfit. There are violists on stage, a drummer in a
baseball cap, virtuousic guitarists and of course, a tall, thin lead singer who's androgynous wails
make sexless-ness totally sexy. There are large melodic explosions. Vacuums are artificially ere

ated and then inflated
with a sound that defies
classification and tran
scends rock's vilified
"verse-chorus-verse"
formula.
And "Hopelandish"
— the band's invented
tongue —is Indo-Aryan
enough for one to spend
the whole evening brutally
applying one's own mean
ing to nonsense words. The
man at the mike strikes his
guitar with violin bows and
the strings respond to the
bashing with beautiful
whimpers of sound. The
lights fluctuate and images
distort on the screen, tem
pering the landscape of the
music. The audience holds
its breath and dies, slowly.
If this isn't the future
of rock 'n' roll, then I'm
packing and moving to
Canada. So, believe the
hype, kids. The geysers in
Iceland have been spout
ing much more than just
hot air.

Jason Mraz
Forget the usual in
troductory mumbo

jumbo. I'm going to get straight to the point. Seeing Jason Mraz live is an amazing experience. I
had the pleasure of first seeing Mraz at Slim's in San Francisco on Jan. 29. At the time, I didn't
know too much about the man or his music, but by the end of the night, I wanted to know every
thing there was to know. Simply put, the concert blew me away. I was introduced to so many as
pects of Mraz-ness: his incredible voice, his strong connection with the audience, his incredible
energy and his instantly addicting songs. And how can I not mention his charismatic Djembe
player, Toca?
Since that night, I have experienced many more Mraz concerts. And every performance is just
heightened by Mraz's loyal fan base. Whenever he performs songs such as "Dreamlife of Rand Mc-

Nally," "0% Interest,"
"1000 Things" and "No
Doubling Back," —songs
that the general public have
probably never heard you
can be sure that the majority
of the audience will be en
thusiastically singing along
with him. And by the end of
the song, the rest of the audi
ence will be singing along as
well.
There are artists who
tour the country, mindlessly
playing through the same
set-list every night, making
the concert experience simi
lar to just listening to the CD
in a crowded subway station.
Jason Mraz is not one of
those artists. Every time he
performs, he proves again
and again that he's not "just
a guy who sings and plays
guitar." Quite simply, the
number one thing Stanford
needs to do this year is bring
Mraz to campus for a perfor
mance. Because if that hap
pens, I'll be there, my neigh
bors will be there, my par
ents will be there and rest as
sured, I'm bringing all of you
along with me.


Jason Mraz: Can somebody tune this, please?


The Locusts: Where is Ryan Sands?


Guess which one is the evil smurf?
