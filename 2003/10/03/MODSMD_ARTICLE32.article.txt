# 'School' really rocks the house
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
From the title credits of "School of Rock," we know
that this movie is about two things: rock music and Jack
Black. What we may not be prepared for is a solid story,
good dialogue and a lot of great characterization. As the
movie opens, we are introduced to Dewey Finn (Jack
Black), a hard rocker who has perfected (or at least prac
ticed) the arts of shirt throwing and crowd surfing. But for
all his pretensions to be a rock star, he can't get around the
fact that he owes $2,200 in rent money to his friend and
former band-mate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White). On top
of that, Dewey gets dumped
by his band, which he insults
by calling "wannabe corpo
rate sell-outs."
Out of luck and money,
Ned suggests that Dewey sell
one of his guitars to make
rent, to which he replies,
"Would you tell Picasso to sell
one of his guitars?" Dewey is
not the sharpest tool in the
shed, but for what he lacks in
brain power, he makes up for
in innovativeness and enthusiasm. Needing a way to pay off
his debt and to get the pushy and possessive Patty (Sarah Sil
verman), Ned's girlfriend, off his back, Dewey cashes in on
a seemingly golden opportunity. After intercepting a phone
call for Ned that's a job offer as substitute teacher at a prep

school, Dewey takes it upon himself to accept the job.
Here the movie makes a nice transition, as it juxtaposes the
orderliness and organization of the prep school class with

Dewey's radiating slacker style. Dewey enters in a preppy scarf
and bow-tie as Ned, asking to be addressed simply as "Mr. S," as
he doesn't know how to spell "Schneebly" properly on the board.

The students are straight-up prep kids —a little bit cold and pre
tentious, and led by the antagonistic Summer (Miranda Cos
grove).

Summer is an all-out teachers' pet, horrified when
Dewey announces that he is eliminating their gold-star grad
ing system and instituting recess all the time.
Then one day Dewey observes the kids in music class,
where they are playing hard-core classical and a light sparks
in Dewey's brain. Here, he realizes, is untapped talent. Oh
yes, it is time to finally teach the kids. That is, teach them the
chords to "Iron Man." And so, Jack Black lets loose. The
sheer animation of his character is highly worthwhile, espe
cially at the outset, where he educates the kids about rock 'n'
roll versus "the man." As Dewey convinces the kids that it
would be a good idea to form a rock band (just what every
prep school needs), Black gets the chance to showcase his
vocal and musical abilities, heretofore limited to Tenacious
D recordings and special TV guest appearances on Conan.
Dewey sets his sights on winning the $20,000 prize in the
upcoming "Battle of the Bands" competition, and readies
the kids by assigning them all roles in the band. Dewey de
scends into a self-indulgent rock fantasy, full of lighting de
scriptions and vocal crescendos, but later realizes that the
band is really for the kids. He changes from being ego-dri
ven and out for himself, to really wanting to share his love of
good ol' rock 'n' roll.
Dewey embarks on teaching the kids rock history and
appreciation — essentially Mark Applebaum's class (hey,
they could be getting college credit for this!) — and assigns
homework such as listening to Yes! and Jimi Hendrix. We
should all be so lucky.
One of the best points that the movie plays with is that there
are actually consequences for actions. Things never get ridicu
lously outlandish—even for a movie about a prep school rock
band led by Jack Black, and it seems feasible that this could ac
tually happen, with only a small dose of suspended reality. The
plot keeps moving really well, it's never trite or boring, and it is
relentlessly unsappy.
"School of Rock" is a wholly enjoyable experience that will re
ally appeal to everyone from old-school rockers that remember
(or at least try to remember) Black Sabbath concerts, like my
mom, who will want to see it for its rock references and to highly
enthusiastic Jack Black fans, like the devilishly handsome boy
who sat next to me at the screening. So only a few questions re
main: Will they get to play? Will they win? Will Dewey finally get
to crowd dive (in shorts)?



Wow, this reading stuff is hard
