"Rock 'n' Roll High School"
Sometimes rock is dirty. Not like Good Charlotte on MTV telling you about safe sex dirty, but truly scary dirty, like
Lou Reed singing about sailors passed out on the ground, or anything Keith Richards, whose beef jerky-skinned, New Age
spiritual exterior is a testimony to what years of rock living will do to you. Stay away, young Stanford students, stay away!
But if you want to just see and not touch, I can recommend the absolute greatest film. "Rock 'n' Roll High School,"
starring the Ramones, is so completely trashy and anti-establishment that just watching it will turn you into a fucking punk.
There is a high school. The draconian principal, Miss Togar, wants to stamp out rock 'n' roll. There is a cute girl. Is there
a boy? Probably, but the boy that really matters is JOEY RAMONE. We're all aware that Joey Ramone is a lanky frog
faced schlump, who looks like a spider on stage and affects a nasal British accent. So what? When you see him for the first
time, he's in an open-topped car, unattractively eating a leg of chicken. If you're odd like me, your heart throbs.
And later on, when the Ramones perform, you know what you feel is true teenaged love. Joey is master of reality; he
clutches his mike with two long hands and yowls about lobotomies. Meanwhile, Johnny treats his cheap guitar like the ex
tension of the phallus it was meant to be, Marky absolutely rocks it like a hurricane on the drums and Dee Dee is an absolute
ruin, a dumb and wide-eyed rock and roll superstar. He doesn't say one word in the whole movie, because that is what drugs
do to you, at least if you indulged like Dee Dee.
This film is something pure, a rock and roll dreamland for the demented and sexually frustrated. Some evidence from
the movie itself — (1) All enemies of good music are obvious and stupid, as well as easily defeated. (2) In this alternate 1979,
people will actually wait in very long lines to buy Ramones tickets. (3) If things go very badly, the Ramones will come to your
high school and help you burn it down.

"A Hard Day's Night"
What's with this Beatles backlash?
Lately, I've been hearing things like, "Oh, The Beatles are so pedestrian and Radiohead is, like, way better," "Boooor
ing!" "Overrated!" and bitch, bitch, moan, moan. As heinous as this all is, I can muster a tiny bit of sympathy.
After all, John and George are dead, Ringo is being respectable and Paul is acting like an old, grumpy asshole. It's easy for
the young to forget.
But for a short time, The Beatles walked the razor-thin line of being both absolutely hip and also loved by everyone,
everywhere. The film "A Hard Day's Night" is a fantastic document of that time period.
In "A Hard Day's Night," the young Beatles are energetic jockers in tight pants who manage the neat trick of repre
senting all good things — youth, freedom, sex and being smarter than all the boring sons of bitches who would rather die
than rock out.
Watch this film to remind yourself about them. Did you know that they made strange and acerbic jokes about being fa
mous, about Paul's clean grandfather? Did you know that they had impeccable tailoring? Do you see how girls screamed
for them, how a blonde with tears on her face sweetly cried, "George, George"?
Although the subject matter and French new wave-style cinematography make it very much a product of its time peri
od, it doesn't feel dated. Even with the distance that almost 40 years brings, The Beatles still have the power to make me
want to scream like a repressed, hormonal girlie when they play "I Should Have Known Better."

"Purple Rain"
When I think "rock movie," I think "PURPLE RAIN." It's a crying shame, but kids these days don't wanna give the
Purple One, (AKA Prince, the-artist-formerly-known-as-fucking-genius) the rock credibility he deserves. All they remem
ber is sneaking glances at those creepy "Diamonds & Pearls" videos on VH1 while their parents were out of the room. But
listen, "Purple Rain" boasts the best soundtrack of the last two decades and the most electric "In Concert" scenes ever
recorded on a film reel. Are you going to tell me you're not down with a movie which starts with the sexxxified gospel-rock
"Lets Go Crazy," ends with an intense "I Would Die 4 U / Baby I'm a Star" medley and features one of the hottest rock love
duets, "Take Me With U?"
Now, people wanna front like this movie is full of bad acting, misogynistic scenes and a thin, melodramatic plot. That's
chill, if you wanna be a square and get bogged down by the details. The truth is that this movie is about Prince doing it all his
own way and flexing his unmatchable funk-rock skills and delirious vision of Sex and the Sacred. And jeez, Apollonia's hot
too.
This is a movie about escaping the sins of the Father. This is a movie about believing in yourself and achieving your
dreams. And this is a movie about Prince, dripping with sweat, humping the shit out of a speaker while screaming about The
Lord. Amen.

"Almost Famous"
Written and directed by the amazing Cameron Crowe ("Jerry Maguire," "Vanilla Sky"), "Almost Famous" takes
everything that is exciting, experimental, invigorating and sentimental about rock 'n' roll and puts it in the form of a beauti
fully told visual story. Crowe's semi-autobiographical masterpiece tells of the adventures of a 15-year-old rock journalist,
William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who receives the opportunity of a lifetime when Rolling Stone commissions him to write a
piece for the magazine.
Leaving his over-possessive mother (Frances McDormand), who accuses Simon and Garfunkel of promoting "drugs
and promiscuous sex," William gets on the tour bus to follow the band Stillwater. The band, led by Russell (Billy Crudup,
doing his best Johnny Depp impression), is on their way to the top; flanked by "roadies," "groupies" and "band-aids," the
head of whom is Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, in a role that landed her an Oscar nod). On the road, William experiences the
essence of rock 'n' roll — and the inevitable growing-up that must follow.
"Almost Famous" breathes the funky, semi-dark, edgy vibe that rock should have. It's a great, aching trip, entirely de
serving of the cliched phrase: smart, funny and hip. I would argue it is the best rock and roll movie ever. It will surely have
you singing along to Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" by the end of the film, certain that "one day, you'll be cool."

Walking down Penny Lane.


Wow, he's a beast.
"The Is Spinal Tap"
These days, it's really easy to be famous: Write a few songs, whore your
self out, upload your image and bam! You're on the "Real World." It was
much harder for my favorite band, the legendary heavy-metal outfit Spinal
Tap (circa 1984): They had to ensure that their volume knobs went to 11, that
their album covers were offensive and / or sexist and that their pants were tight
enough to send the children screaming. And even then, the only moral of the
story was this: It can take years to build a relationship, a career, a reputation
and only one midget Stonehenge to destroy a band (played brilliantly and non
chalantly by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer).
In essence, "This Is Spinal Tap," was the first "Breaking the Band" reality
show. But what really makes it a success is the sadness swimming beneath its
surface — a band's longing for success in a genre that will shoot them down as
soon as they conform to it. The exploding drummers notwithstanding — "di
rector" Marti DiBergi (Rob Reiner) culls a touching portrait from the goofi
ness that leaves me feeling bad about being a bad ass.
I still love "Spinal Tap." I can listen to their Mersey Beat music and I dig
their 1980s hairstyles. Rock 'n' roll movies are almost always coming of age
movies. What's awesome about this mockumentary is that the band never
comes of age— and are all the better for it.
