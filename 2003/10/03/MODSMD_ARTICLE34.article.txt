# A 						rock star who makes the grade

### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Mark Applebaum has long hair. And he's a professor at Stanford. Collate these findings and you
reach one conclusion: hyper coolness. As the teacher of one of Stanford's most popular classes —
"Rock, Sex and Rebellion" — Mark Applebaum is an expert on rock 'n' roll and its complex relation
ships with gender, race and youth. Musically, his interests lie in three principal areas: a sound-sculpture
project, jazz piano and "uncompromising and unmarketable avant-garde music," which, as we cynics
know only too well, does not include rock 'n' roll.
For this issue we figured that — in a characteristically paradoxical style — it was time to get our
rockingness and indie-sensibilities endorsed by a higher authority. So we did the respectable-Stanford
student-thing — we dropped by office hours and fulfilled our groupie-like lusting for Stanford's main
emcee and official rock star. Here's a transcript of what ensued.
INTERMISSION: We know you're into a wide variety of music styles. What in particular do you get
out of rock music?
MARK APPLEBAUM: I think that rock has certain kinds of qualities and components and his tories
—just as every genre has its own particular unique traits... I suppose that my first interest in rock 'n'
roll has to do with the fact that it was some of the music I grew up with. I play a lot of jazz piano now,
but when I was younger, it was the two areas — classical and rock music that interested me the most and
that I played. For instance, I played in a rock band in high school.
The first two records that I ever purchased (I had saved up my allowance money when I was a little
kid and my mother took me to a record store) were a collection of Glenn Gould recordings of Mozart
piano sonatas and Led Zeppelin's fourth record. And so those two records, in some respect, character
ize that I was and continue to be a musical omnivore...
For me rock 'n' roll (and when I say rock 'n' roll I mean a very broad collection of vernacular popu
lar music genres that range from heavy metal to disco to techno to grunge to everything in between) is
"western popular music" with an important and recent social history...
In that regard, the locus of interest is extra-musical for me, as well as musical. I'm interested in cer
tain musical devices — for example, I'm fascinated by the harmonic structure of rock 'n' roll (as much
as people would argue that it's trivial). I'm fascinated by the kind of rhythms, the kind of grooves that
are associated with current rock genres. The lyrics are sometimes interesting, sometimes they're in
credibly banal. In particular, timbre, that is tone color, is really interesting and carefully considered in a
very refined way in rock 'n' roll. There is great concern with timbre as well as with production issues,
arrangement issues. Studio recording is highly finessed — a lot of snobby persons might think that clas
sical orchestration is more sensitive and carefully crafted — and while I don't deny that they are sensi
tive and carefully crafted, I would argue that there is sometimes as much or more care taken on the
micro-level of production and timbre in rock 'n' roll. In addition to that, I'm interested in the extra-mu
sical resonance of this stuff—for example, what's happening socially, who the people are who sing this
stuff, who's listening to it, why — are complicated and problematic issues that I just find fascinating.
INT: As someone engaged in rock pedagogy, what's the best one-line definition of rock music you can
give us?
MA: It's a little glib but I think that I can give you a quick 21st century sound-byte response to that —
so I'll invoke Keith Richards' definition: "Rock 'n' roll is sex and rebellion." It's not a complete response
but if you wanted the super-short version, it would be that. And hence, the name of the Music 8A class
is "Rock, Sex and Rebellion." Obviously, that class is mostly a music class — about rock music — but
I make that a list instead of "Rock: Sex and Rebellion" because we're also interested in the social di
mension of sex and the role of gender and how we think about gender through rock music. And rebel
lion is a catch-all word, but in a sense... we can differentiate between rebellion and revolution. For me,
the connotation of rebellion is a simpler act of acting in a counter-cultural manner against some order
or against some power, whereas revolution does that but in addition takes on the more mature respon
sibility of asking and answering the question —how do we make the situation better?
Rock 'n' roll is interested in a lot of rebellion and only occasionally interested in revolution. That's
a very quick way of looking at it — on a cynical day I would say that rock is about sex and conformity.
On another day — if I'm in a high modernist frame of mind, reading Adorno — I might say that rock n
roll is about commodity fetishism and pseudo-individuation. But most of the time I'm not that cynical
and antagonistic towards rock.
INT: Tell us more about the rock band you were in.
MA: It was called "Synesthesia." This was in the early/mid-80s — we played covers of all sorts of pop
tunes whether they ranged from Michael J ackson to Van Halen to whatever. (Although that's not much
of a span — now is it? — since Eddie Van Halen collaborated on the "Thriller" album by making a
guest cameo spot on Michael Jackson's "Beat It." (laughs) To give you a little background — I think of
myself as a jazz improviser. So, for me, what's really important about jazz is making it up as you go along
... what's ironic to me about my high school work is that for those tunes that we were playing in high
school, we were interested in sounding as much as possible like the record, which is so far from my cur
rent values — I would never be interested in sounding like somebody else right now.
INT: Can you name a few current rock artists and albums that you listen to or think are particularly

unique and groundbreaking?
MA: A lot of people are asked that question and a lot of people have answers for that. I think a lot of
college students could answer that immediately. It's become a much more difficult question for me. Un
able as usual to give you a straight answer to any of these questions, I need to contextualize my response
by stating something peculiar to me which has to do with the fact that as a composer and professional
I'm so deeply engaged in music that, as a result, I don't like music anymore. I continue to love music, I
continue to hate music, I continue to find it totally absorbing, but I really don't like it in the sense of en
joyment.
So most people like music as a source of entertainment, pleasure, escape...but for me there's literal
ly no music that doesn't interest me... My listening tends to be for analytic purposes, it tends to be to
try to know what's out there and it's largely tempered by my life as a composer of experimental music
... I'm always asking myself questions about my relationship to a particular piece of music... how I
might improve it...
I think most people have other — I'm going to be bold — more innocent responses to music. Now,
I will tell you what I used to be really interested in because I do remember being younger and really lik
ing music; of the pop-musicians, Led Zeppelin, and later The Beatles, were really enormous influences
on me and I admired their music a lot. In junior high, I listened to a lot of art-rock or progressive-rock:
all of those very pompous, English bands who were doing very complicated music — groups like Emer
son, Lake, & Palmer, Yes, Genesis and King Crimson. I think I admired them because I was studying
classical music and they were using some of these "high-brow" techniques. Later, I developed a much
more unsympathetic reading of those groups that makes me laugh both at the groups and at myself—
but I still continue to have a certain admiration and love for them.
And coming to the more recent things that I've been interested in — in the mid 90s I did what I re
ferred to as "Remedial Heavy Metal Studies" when I realized that I didn't know much about heavy
metal music and so I did some reading and a lot of listening and I found heavy metal to be a fascinating
phenomenon.
I later did "Remedial Techno" — you have to understand that I consider myself extremely un-hip.
I learned about raves from Time magazine which meant that, basically, they were done, [laughs] I'm not
cool enough to know about culture when it's marginal, except for my own weird, experimental compo
sition, which I'm super-cool about. Like, I'm extremely off-the-radar and nobody seems to care either,
[laughs] But I find out about popular things late. For example, I haven't spent any important time club
bing and taking ecstasy — which I've actually never done — and all sorts of other things. So I have to
conduct these "Remedial Studies" to learn more about various genres and cultural phenomena from a
distance.
I guess I'm not answering your question, [pauses] Let's just say that I was very sad to see the demise
of The Spice Girls.
INT: That's a great line.
MA: [laughs] But you have to say, in your article, "he said sarcastically," I'm not sure that the proper
tone will be quite conveyed...
INT: Can you recount any great live performances you've seen recently?
MA: As part my "Hip Hop Remedial Studies," I went last year to Shoreline to see an MTV-sponsored
Rap tour *.. from a musical point of view, I think The Roots were the most interesting group there —
but in terms of most spectacular performances, there was a turntable DJ on the Jurassic 5 set who was
amazing.
I think that some sub-genres of rock music are evidence of a kind of bifurcation where you have some
rock traditions in which the live performance remains an important expressive vehicle and in which peo
ple really care about how they sound — but in addition, some of those bands are very concerned with
the extra-musical elements in a live show.
So, for example, I think it's perfectly reasonable — in the case of Madonna or Prince or KISS — to
ask the question, what's this music trading on? And if it's trading on cool costumes, pyrotechnics or
some elaborate stunt or some spacecraft that landed on the stage or wild makeup — that is part of the
commodity we're consuming.
How many times have you heard somebody say — "I went to see KISS?" You're going to hear that
a lot more than "I went to HEAR KISS."
On the other side of that bifurcation, the intrinsic listening experience remains the chief paradigm
— often, such music is focused on the recording that's released and the experience of hearing it on the
radio, often in your home alone or with friends — under a very different set of conditions with a very
different notion of what community is. There's one kind of a community that you're experiencing when
you're sitting with 10,000 other people in a large space and somebody's spilling beer on you, or when
you're dancing with somebody, or when you go home that night with somebody you just met — that is
different from, "Here I am having a solitary experience with my headphones in my bedroom." And I
have to say I don't enjoy being with huge, stoned crowds of the people. In that regard, I tend towards
the listening at home experience.

Professor Applebaum has a campus concert next Friday, October 10 at 8pm in the Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. He'll be performing with his father, Bob Applebaum of Chicago, in The Applebaum Jazz Piano
Duo, a father-son duo including two grand pianos, four hands, twenty fingers and too many notes. They
will play sick and twisted arrangements of classic jazz standards. Tickets are $10; $5 for students.

ple really care about how they sound — but in addition, some of those bands are very concerned with
the extra-musical elements in a live show.
So, for example, I think it's perfectly reasonable — in the case of Madonna or Prince or KISS — to
ask the question, what's this music trading on? And if it's trading on cool costumes, pyrotechnics or
some elaborate stunt or some spacecraft that landed on the stage or wild makeup — that is part of the
commodity we're consuming.
How many times have you heard somebody say — "I went to see KISS?" You're going to hear that
a lot more than "I went to HEAR KISS."
On the other side of that bifurcation, the intrinsic listening experience remains the chief paradigm
— often, such music is focused on the recording that's released and the experience of hearing it on the
radio, often in your home alone or with friends — under a very different set of conditions with a very
different notion of what community is. There's one kind of a community that you're experiencing when
you're sitting with 10,000 other people in a large space and somebody's spilling beer on you, or when
you're dancing with somebody, or when you go home that night with somebody you just met — that is
different from, "Here I am having a solitary experience with my headphones in my bedroom." And I
have to say I don't enjoy being with huge, stoned crowds of the people. In that regard, I tend towards
the listening at home experience.

Professor Applebaum has a campus concert next Friday, October 10 at 8pm in the Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. He'll be performing with his father, Bob Applebaum of Chicago, in The Applebaum Jazz Piano
Duo, a father-son duo including two grand pianos, four hands, twenty fingers and too many notes. They
will play sick and twisted arrangements of classic jazz standards. Tickets are $10; $5 for students.

Mark Applebaum has long hair. And he's a professor at Stanford. Collate these findings and you
reach one conclusion: hyper coolness. As the teacher of one of Stanford's most popular classes —
"Rock, Sex and Rebellion" — Mark Applebaum is an expert on rock 'n' roll and its complex relation
ships with gender, race and youth. Musically, his interests lie in three principal areas: a sound-sculpture
project, jazz piano and "uncompromising and unmarketable avant-garde music," which, as we cynics
know only too well, does not include rock 'n' roll.
For this issue we figured that — in a characteristically paradoxical style — it was time to get our
rockingness and indie-sensibilities endorsed by a higher authority. So we did the respectable-Stanford
student-thing — we dropped by office hours and fulfilled our groupie-like lusting for Stanford's main
emcee and official rock star. Here's a transcript of what ensued.
INTERMISSION: We know you're into a wide variety of music styles. What in particular do you get
out of rock music?
MARK APPLEBAUM: I think that rock has certain kinds of qualities and components and his tories
—just as every genre has its own particular unique traits... I suppose that my first interest in rock 'n'
roll has to do with the fact that it was some of the music I grew up with. I play a lot of jazz piano now,
but when I was younger, it was the two areas — classical and rock music that interested me the most and
that I played. For instance, I played in a rock band in high school.
The first two records that I ever purchased (I had saved up my allowance money when I was a little
kid and my mother took me to a record store) were a collection of Glenn Gould recordings of Mozart
piano sonatas and Led Zeppelin's fourth record. And so those two records, in some respect, character
ize that I was and continue to be a musical omnivore...
For me rock 'n' roll (and when I say rock 'n' roll I mean a very broad collection of vernacular popu
lar music genres that range from heavy metal to disco to techno to grunge to everything in between) is
"western popular music" with an important and recent social history...
In that regard, the locus of interest is extra-musical for me, as well as musical. I'm interested in cer
tain musical devices — for example, I'm fascinated by the harmonic structure of rock 'n' roll (as much
as people would argue that it's trivial). I'm fascinated by the kind of rhythms, the kind of grooves that
are associated with current rock genres. The lyrics are sometimes interesting, sometimes they're in
credibly banal. In particular, timbre, that is tone color, is really interesting and carefully considered in a
very refined way in rock 'n' roll. There is great concern with timbre as well as with production issues,
arrangement issues. Studio recording is highly finessed — a lot of snobby persons might think that clas
sical orchestration is more sensitive and carefully crafted — and while I don't deny that they are sensi
tive and carefully crafted, I would argue that there is sometimes as much or more care taken on the
micro-level of production and timbre in rock 'n' roll. In addition to that, I'm interested in the extra-mu
sical resonance of this stuff—for example, what's happening socially, who the people are who sing this
stuff, who's listening to it, why — are complicated and problematic issues that I just find fascinating.
INT: As someone engaged in rock pedagogy, what's the best one-line definition of rock music you can
give us?
MA: It's a little glib but I think that I can give you a quick 21st century sound-byte response to that —
so I'll invoke Keith Richards' definition: "Rock 'n' roll is sex and rebellion." It's not a complete response
but if you wanted the super-short version, it would be that. And hence, the name of the Music 8A class
is "Rock, Sex and Rebellion." Obviously, that class is mostly a music class — about rock music — but
I make that a list instead of "Rock: Sex and Rebellion" because we're also interested in the social di
mension of sex and the role of gender and how we think about gender through rock music. And rebel
lion is a catch-all word, but in a sense... we can differentiate between rebellion and revolution. For me,
the connotation of rebellion is a simpler act of acting in a counter-cultural manner against some order
or against some power, whereas revolution does that but in addition takes on the more mature respon
sibility of asking and answering the question —how do we make the situation better?
Rock 'n' roll is interested in a lot of rebellion and only occasionally interested in revolution. That's
a very quick way of looking at it — on a cynical day I would say that rock is about sex and conformity.
On another day — if I'm in a high modernist frame of mind, reading Adorno — I might say that rock n
roll is about commodity fetishism and pseudo-individuation. But most of the time I'm not that cynical
and antagonistic towards rock.
INT: Tell us more about the rock band you were in.
MA: It was called "Synesthesia." This was in the early/mid-80s — we played covers of all sorts of pop
tunes whether they ranged from Michael J ackson to Van Halen to whatever. (Although that's not much
of a span — now is it? — since Eddie Van Halen collaborated on the "Thriller" album by making a
guest cameo spot on Michael Jackson's "Beat It." (laughs) To give you a little background — I think of
myself as a jazz improviser. So, for me, what's really important about jazz is making it up as you go along
... what's ironic to me about my high school work is that for those tunes that we were playing in high
school, we were interested in sounding as much as possible like the record, which is so far from my cur
rent values — I would never be interested in sounding like somebody else right now.
INT: Can you name a few current rock artists and albums that you listen to or think are particularly

unique and groundbreaking?
MA: A lot of people are asked that question and a lot of people have answers for that. I think a lot of
college students could answer that immediately. It's become a much more difficult question for me. Un
able as usual to give you a straight answer to any of these questions, I need to contextualize my response
by stating something peculiar to me which has to do with the fact that as a composer and professional
I'm so deeply engaged in music that, as a result, I don't like music anymore. I continue to love music, I
continue to hate music, I continue to find it totally absorbing, but I really don't like it in the sense of en
joyment.
So most people like music as a source of entertainment, pleasure, escape...but for me there's literal
ly no music that doesn't interest me... My listening tends to be for analytic purposes, it tends to be to
try to know what's out there and it's largely tempered by my life as a composer of experimental music
... I'm always asking myself questions about my relationship to a particular piece of music... how I
might improve it...
I think most people have other — I'm going to be bold — more innocent responses to music. Now,
I will tell you what I used to be really interested in because I do remember being younger and really lik
ing music; of the pop-musicians, Led Zeppelin, and later The Beatles, were really enormous influences
on me and I admired their music a lot. In junior high, I listened to a lot of art-rock or progressive-rock:
all of those very pompous, English bands who were doing very complicated music — groups like Emer
son, Lake, & Palmer, Yes, Genesis and King Crimson. I think I admired them because I was studying
classical music and they were using some of these "high-brow" techniques. Later, I developed a much
more unsympathetic reading of those groups that makes me laugh both at the groups and at myself—
but I still continue to have a certain admiration and love for them.
And coming to the more recent things that I've been interested in — in the mid 90s I did what I re
ferred to as "Remedial Heavy Metal Studies" when I realized that I didn't know much about heavy
metal music and so I did some reading and a lot of listening and I found heavy metal to be a fascinating
phenomenon.
I later did "Remedial Techno" — you have to understand that I consider myself extremely un-hip.
I learned about raves from Time magazine which meant that, basically, they were done, [laughs] I'm not
cool enough to know about culture when it's marginal, except for my own weird, experimental compo
sition, which I'm super-cool about. Like, I'm extremely off-the-radar and nobody seems to care either,
[laughs] But I find out about popular things late. For example, I haven't spent any important time club
bing and taking ecstasy — which I've actually never done — and all sorts of other things. So I have to
conduct these "Remedial Studies" to learn more about various genres and cultural phenomena from a
distance.
I guess I'm not answering your question, [pauses] Let's just say that I was very sad to see the demise
of The Spice Girls.
INT: That's a great line.
MA: [laughs] But you have to say, in your article, "he said sarcastically," I'm not sure that the proper
tone will be quite conveyed...
INT: Can you recount any great live performances you've seen recently?
MA: As part my "Hip Hop Remedial Studies," I went last year to Shoreline to see an MTV-sponsored
Rap tour *.. from a musical point of view, I think The Roots were the most interesting group there —
but in terms of most spectacular performances, there was a turntable DJ on the Jurassic 5 set who was
amazing.
I think that some sub-genres of rock music are evidence of a kind of bifurcation where you have some
rock traditions in which the live performance remains an important expressive vehicle and in which peo
ple really care about how they sound — but in addition, some of those bands are very concerned with

And coming to the more recent things that I've been interested in — in the mid 90s I did what I re
ferred to as "Remedial Heavy Metal Studies" when I realized that I didn't know much about heavy
metal music and so I did some reading and a lot of listening and I found heavy metal to be a fascinating
phenomenon.
I later did "Remedial Techno" — you have to understand that I consider myself extremely un-hip.
I learned about raves from Time magazine which meant that, basically, they were done, [laughs] I'm not
cool enough to know about culture when it's marginal, except for my own weird, experimental compo
sition, which I'm super-cool about. Like, I'm extremely off-the-radar and nobody seems to care either,
[laughs] But I find out about popular things late. For example, I haven't spent any important time club
bing and taking ecstasy — which I've actually never done — and all sorts of other things. So I have to
conduct these "Remedial Studies" to learn more about various genres and cultural phenomena from a
distance.
I guess I'm not answering your question, [pauses] Let's just say that I was very sad to see the demise
of The Spice Girls.
INT: That's a great line.
MA: [laughs] But you have to say, in your article, "he said sarcastically," I'm not sure that the proper
tone will be quite conveyed...
INT: Can you recount any great live performances you've seen recently?
MA: As part my "Hip Hop Remedial Studies," I went last year to Shoreline to see an MTV-sponsored
Rap tour *.. from a musical point of view, I think The Roots were the most interesting group there —
but in terms of most spectacular performances, there was a turntable DJ on the Jurassic 5 set who was
amazing.
I think that some sub-genres of rock music are evidence of a kind of bifurcation where you have some
rock traditions in which the live performance remains an important expressive vehicle and in which peo
ple really care about how they sound — but in addition, some of those bands are very concerned with
the extra-musical elements in a live show.
So, for example, I think it's perfectly reasonable — in the case of Madonna or Prince or KISS — to
ask the question, what's this music trading on? And if it's trading on cool costumes, pyrotechnics or
some elaborate stunt or some spacecraft that landed on the stage or wild makeup — that is part of the
commodity we're consuming.
How many times have you heard somebody say — "I went to see KISS?" You're going to hear that
a lot more than "I went to HEAR KISS."
On the other side of that bifurcation, the intrinsic listening experience remains the chief paradigm
— often, such music is focused on the recording that's released and the experience of hearing it on the
radio, often in your home alone or with friends — under a very different set of conditions with a very
different notion of what community is. There's one kind of a community that you're experiencing when
you're sitting with 10,000 other people in a large space and somebody's spilling beer on you, or when
you're dancing with somebody, or when you go home that night with somebody you just met — that is
different from, "Here I am having a solitary experience with my headphones in my bedroom." And I
have to say I don't enjoy being with huge, stoned crowds of the people. In that regard, I tend towards
the listening at home experience.

Professor Applebaum has a campus concert next Friday, October 10 at 8pm in the Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. He'll be performing with his father, Bob Applebaum of Chicago, in The Applebaum Jazz Piano
Duo, a father-son duo including two grand pianos, four hands, twenty fingers and too many notes. They
will play sick and twisted arrangements of classic jazz standards. Tickets are $10; $5 for students.

Mark Applebaum has long hair. And he's a professor at Stanford. Collate these findings and you
reach one conclusion: hyper coolness. As the teacher of one of Stanford's most popular classes —
"Rock, Sex and Rebellion" — Mark Applebaum is an expert on rock 'n' roll and its complex relation
ships with gender, race and youth. Musically, his interests lie in three principal areas: a sound-sculpture
project, jazz piano and "uncompromising and unmarketable avant-garde music," which, as we cynics
know only too well, does not include rock 'n' roll.
For this issue we figured that — in a characteristically paradoxical style — it was time to get our
rockingness and indie-sensibilities endorsed by a higher authority. So we did the respectable-Stanford
student-thing — we dropped by office hours and fulfilled our groupie-like lusting for Stanford's main
emcee and official rock star. Here's a transcript of what ensued.
INTERMISSION: We know you're into a wide variety of music styles. What in particular do you get
out of rock music?
MARK APPLEBAUM: I think that rock has certain kinds of qualities and components and his tories
—just as every genre has its own particular unique traits... I suppose that my first interest in rock 'n'
roll has to do with the fact that it was some of the music I grew up with. I play a lot of jazz piano now,
but when I was younger, it was the two areas — classical and rock music that interested me the most and
that I played. For instance, I played in a rock band in high school.
The first two records that I ever purchased (I had saved up my allowance money when I was a little
kid and my mother took me to a record store) were a collection of Glenn Gould recordings of Mozart
piano sonatas and Led Zeppelin's fourth record. And so those two records, in some respect, character
ize that I was and continue to be a musical omnivore...
For me rock 'n' roll (and when I say rock 'n' roll I mean a very broad collection of vernacular popu
lar music genres that range from heavy metal to disco to techno to grunge to everything in between) is
"western popular music" with an important and recent social history...
In that regard, the locus of interest is extra-musical for me, as well as musical. I'm interested in cer
tain musical devices — for example, I'm fascinated by the harmonic structure of rock 'n' roll (as much
as people would argue that it's trivial). I'm fascinated by the kind of rhythms, the kind of grooves that
are associated with current rock genres. The lyrics are sometimes interesting, sometimes they're in
credibly banal. In particular, timbre, that is tone color, is really interesting and carefully considered in a
very refined way in rock 'n' roll. There is great concern with timbre as well as with production issues,
arrangement issues. Studio recording is highly finessed — a lot of snobby persons might think that clas
sical orchestration is more sensitive and carefully crafted — and while I don't deny that they are sensi
tive and carefully crafted, I would argue that there is sometimes as much or more care taken on the
micro-level of production and timbre in rock 'n' roll. In addition to that, I'm interested in the extra-mu
sical resonance of this stuff—for example, what's happening socially, who the people are who sing this
stuff, who's listening to it, why — are complicated and problematic issues that I just find fascinating.
INT: As someone engaged in rock pedagogy, what's the best one-line definition of rock music you can
give us?
MA: It's a little glib but I think that I can give you a quick 21st century sound-byte response to that —
so I'll invoke Keith Richards' definition: "Rock 'n' roll is sex and rebellion." It's not a complete response
but if you wanted the super-short version, it would be that. And hence, the name of the Music 8A class
is "Rock, Sex and Rebellion." Obviously, that class is mostly a music class — about rock music — but
I make that a list instead of "Rock: Sex and Rebellion" because we're also interested in the social di
mension of sex and the role of gender and how we think about gender through rock music. And rebel
lion is a catch-all word, but in a sense... we can differentiate between rebellion and revolution. For me,
the connotation of rebellion is a simpler act of acting in a counter-cultural manner against some order
or against some power, whereas revolution does that but in addition takes on the more mature respon
sibility of asking and answering the question —how do we make the situation better?
Rock 'n' roll is interested in a lot of rebellion and only occasionally interested in revolution. That's
a very quick way of looking at it — on a cynical day I would say that rock is about sex and conformity.
On another day — if I'm in a high modernist frame of mind, reading Adorno — I might say that rock n
roll is about commodity fetishism and pseudo-individuation. But most of the time I'm not that cynical
and antagonistic towards rock.
INT: Tell us more about the rock band you were in.
MA: It was called "Synesthesia." This was in the early/mid-80s — we played covers of all sorts of pop
tunes whether they ranged from Michael J ackson to Van Halen to whatever. (Although that's not much
of a span — now is it? — since Eddie Van Halen collaborated on the "Thriller" album by making a
guest cameo spot on Michael Jackson's "Beat It." (laughs) To give you a little background — I think of
myself as a jazz improviser. So, for me, what's really important about jazz is making it up as you go along
... what's ironic to me about my high school work is that for those tunes that we were playing in high
school, we were interested in sounding as much as possible like the record, which is so far from my cur
rent values — I would never be interested in sounding like somebody else right now.
INT: Can you name a few current rock artists and albums that you listen to or think are particularly

unique and groundbreaking?
MA: A lot of people are asked that question and a lot of people have answers for that. I think a lot of
college students could answer that immediately. It's become a much more difficult question for me. Un
able as usual to give you a straight answer to any of these questions, I need to contextualize my response
by stating something peculiar to me which has to do with the fact that as a composer and professional
I'm so deeply engaged in music that, as a result, I don't like music anymore. I continue to love music, I
continue to hate music, I continue to find it totally absorbing, but I really don't like it in the sense of en
joyment.
So most people like music as a source of entertainment, pleasure, escape...but for me there's literal
ly no music that doesn't interest me... My listening tends to be for analytic purposes, it tends to be to
try to know what's out there and it's largely tempered by my life as a composer of experimental music
... I'm always asking myself questions about my relationship to a particular piece of music... how I
might improve it...
I think most people have other — I'm going to be bold — more innocent responses to music. Now,
I will tell you what I used to be really interested in because I do remember being younger and really lik
ing music; of the pop-musicians, Led Zeppelin, and later The Beatles, were really enormous influences
on me and I admired their music a lot. In junior high, I listened to a lot of art-rock or progressive-rock:
all of those very pompous, English bands who were doing very complicated music — groups like Emer
son, Lake, & Palmer, Yes, Genesis and King Crimson. I think I admired them because I was studying
classical music and they were using some of these "high-brow" techniques. Later, I developed a much
more unsympathetic reading of those groups that makes me laugh both at the groups and at myself—
but I still continue to have a certain admiration and love for them.
And coming to the more recent things that I've been interested in — in the mid 90s I did what I re
ferred to as "Remedial Heavy Metal Studies" when I realized that I didn't know much about heavy
