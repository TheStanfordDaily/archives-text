# Fashion retro-spective

### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
From the very beginning of Rock 'n' Roll's induc
tion into popular culture, only one idea has dominat
ed — the desire to look and act like a rock star. While
most of us will try our hardest — and ultimately fail
— resigning ourselves to sing along with Ben Folds'
"Rockin' the Suburbs," there's not harm trying to
pick up a few hints from rock's fashionably fabulous.
From the suit and tie days of The Beatles, to the
suit and tie days of Interpol, rock fashion has seen the
flashiness of Liberace and Elvis, the outlandishness
of KISS and Ziggy Stardust, and way too many span
dex-clad stars of the '70s and '80s. For most of us, the
first big diversion in our memories came with the in
troduction of grunge. Finally! A chance to wear our
most dirty, dingy, baggy jeans with a flannel shirt
(probably discarded by lumberjacks) and utterly un
kempt hair, and look really cool.
The late '90s experienced a fashion revitaliza
tion. "Clueless," of all things, put an end to grunge.
When Cher lamented, "So, OK. I don't want to be
a traitor to my generation and all, but I don't get
how guys dress today. I mean, c'mon, it looks like
they just fell out of bed and put on some baggy
pants, and take their greasy hair, Ew! And cover it
up with a backwards cap and like, we're expected to
swoon? I don't think so!" we knew grunge was
"outie"! Clad in their short pleated skirts, sweater
sets and super cute dresses, "Clueless" made dress
ing up fashionable again. They did knee socks long
before Britney strutted her "Catholic girl" stuff in
the video for "Baby, one more time." And they at
least got guys into khakis and semi-clean T-shirts.
By the end of the '90s, the music scene experi
enced a surge of "trashy class," with Puffy (P. Diddy
... whatever) and Snoop decked out in the finest
hideous fur coats and gold and diamond jewelry.
Then came J.Lo. Who else could single-handedly
bring back large-brimmed floppy hats, hoop earrings,
and ice pink lipstick? Who else could resurrect
Flashdance's single-shouldered sweatshirts and give
us the best parts of the movie in her "I'm Glad"
video? Currently featured in print ads for Louis Vuit

ton, J.Lo is a decidedly the pop rock fashion diva of
the moment. But there is another trend we must dis
cuss: punk.
Punk Fashion
You look across a clouded smoky room, and there
you see her — a raven-haired pixie, dark eye make
up, ruby-red lipstick, hot pink one-shouldered tank
under a stringy tight black sweater, black pleated
skirt and fishnets, and clunky heeled Doc Martens.
She is decidedly punk. Not punk in an "I'm Avril Lav
igne defying authority by wearing a tie" pseudo
punk way, but more in an "look at me wrong, and I'll
kick your a&*" way."
Let's take a moment here to note this: — if you
are wearing a T-shirt that says something kitschy
like "rock star" or "punk" —you aren't one.
You're just going to just have to come to grips
with this. People with true attitude don't have to
(literally) spell it out for other people. As every
thing old is new again time after time, today punk
is pop — walking through any department store,
you're sure to see steel-toed boots, leather, metal
lic adornments, chains, safety-pins and solid-col
ored baby-Ts paired with low-slung striped pants.
Guys' and girls' clothes overlap — guys favoring
tight t-shirts and tighter jeans (really dark blue
and low-riding), and girls making for an odd
bridge between military motif and punk anar
chism.
As far as color combinations go — black, black,
black — paired with funky plaids, and a few hints of
bright rad colors, hot pink, green, red and occasion
ally purple-stripes abound. Make-up is for both girls
and boys — I'm pretty sure all the members of the
Sex Pistols wore eyeliner — and no eye make-up is
too over the top for punks. Skin is pale, and lipstick is
deep blood red, or occasionally Telenovela-pink.
Punk, to be true punk, must be bought for $3 from
a manic neighbor, or found in a dumpster outside a
concert venue. The new punk style that permeates
our culture is more mainstream — geeky cool inter
secting with a former cutting edge. I mean, is it really
punk if you pay $200 for it at Diesel? Maybe not, but
if you don't have an attitude, you might as well buy
one.


I really should get back to I-hum.
