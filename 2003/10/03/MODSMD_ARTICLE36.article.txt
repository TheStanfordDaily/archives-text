# Record bin: Love less, live more
## 
### JULIAN WASS 
Once upon a time, in a land across the Atlantic, four mu
sicians entered a recording studio and did not leave for a
very, very long time. Like so many others of their time, they
were well versed in the history of guitar noise. Yet there was
something very special about these four. Perhaps it was their
leader, a man with a completely new sound swirling around
in his head. Two years and one bankrupted record label later,
the band emerged with an album.
That band was My Bloody Valentine, and the album they
produced was called "Loveless."
Singer, guitarist and producer Kevin Shields was the dri
ving force behind the group. His role in My Bloody Valen
tine was characterized by his intense perfectionism and
search for a matchless guitar sound. His vision for "Loveless"
required him to synthesize a new sound combining feedback
and processed guitar, ethereal vocals and dance rhythms. He
brought in influences from guitar-futurists like The Velvet
Underground (VU) and The Jesus and Mary Chain (JAMC)
and combined them with the light, sleepy vocals of co-vocal
ist Blinda Butcher. The opening track, "Only Shallow," fea
tures Butcher singing immediately after being awoken in the
middle of the night by Shields. Drummer Colm O'Ciosig has

a similar memory of Shields sometimes obsessive vision
when he recalls most of what he played being chopped up
and re-sequenced by Shields into beats that were unlike any
dance music.
The sound that resulted had nothing in common with VU
or JAMC except for its exploration of guitar driven sonic tex
tures, which was years ahead of its time. Brian Eno called
"Soon" — the final track of "Loveless" — "the future of pop
music." I suppose it is the future right now, and sadly, noth
ing released since sounds anything like "Loveless"; this is a
testament not to its lack of influence, but rather the sheer im
possibility of imitating it.
It may not seem evident at first because of the heavily
processing, but "Loveless" is a guitar album, as much as Hen
drix's "Electric Ladyland" or The Stooges "Fun House."
Every song is a further exploration of the limits of the electric
guitar. From the whale-like sounds heard on "Touched" to
the sheer power of "Come in Alone," almost every sound on
the album was made with an electric guitar. "To Here Knows
When" features Shields's distinct textured guitar jabs match
ing Butcher's understated vocals.
Even the softest song on the album, "Sometimes," is coat
ed with distortion in a way that seems impossible.
Although Loveless is cherished by legions of fans and crit

ics, the band was never to record another album. Then
leader, Kevin Shields, the man whose mind was filled with
fantasies of swirling melodies and guitars that don't sound
anything like guitars slowly withdrew from music altogether
amidst various unfinished and unreleased projects, never to
be heard from again.
Until now.
Aside from when it was first released in 1991, the year
2003 may be the best time to discover, or, if you already have,
to revisit "Loveless." After nearly 12 years without releasing
any new music, Shields has contributed four new tracks to the
soundtrack of the film "Lost in Translation" (see film review,
page 3). The band, minus bassist Debbie Googe, has also re
convened to complete four unfinished tracks intended for an
upcoming box set. After that, well... who knows? Shields
has downplayed the reunion while promising to release an
album of solo material. As for MBV, the band that ex-Cre
ation Records president Alan McGee called "This Genera
tion's Velvet Underground in waiting," we'll have to wait
and see if the reunion is for real. So, until we can huddle into
a venue and watch Shields and company pick up their instru
ments and launch into the opening salvo of "Only Shallow,"
the record will have to do.
And trust me, it does.
