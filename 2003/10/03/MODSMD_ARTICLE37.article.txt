# Bob: The dean of rock critics
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Robert Christgau's Web site describes him as the "Dean of Amer
ican Rock Critics," and he has the credentials to back it up. He's been
writing about music for more than 35 years, and as a senior editor at
the Village Voice he supervises the Pazz & Jop poll, a nearly compre
hensive annual survey of the nation's pop music critics.
More importantly, his writings — including a long-running "Con
sumer Guide" column in the Voice — capture, distill and transmit a
passionate-but-prickly love of music. His description of Sleater-Kin
ney's "Call the Doctor" ("Few have played rock's tension-and-release
game for such high stakes — revolution as existentialism, electric roar
as acne remedy ... ") is simply exhilarating, and his put-down of Ra
diohead's "OK Computer" ("Radiohead wouldn't know a tragic hero
if they were studying for their A-levels, and their idea of soul is Bono
... ") is pure rock'n'roll sneer.
Christgau's smart, intense and at times blisteringly funny work pro
vides a template for intelligently embracing all that rock has to offer,
with no apologies.
Intermission: How did you first start writing about music?
Robert Christgau: I was being courted by Esquire magazine because I
had done a piece of reportage — which had won a couple of awards.
There was a column there called "Secular Music;" it was being written
by David Newman who had just written a script for a movie called
"Bonnie and Clyde," so he had other concerns. Esquire asked me if I
was interested in the column. I loved the music, so I said, "Sure, I'll do
it."
At the time, there was almost nobody doing this sort of reporting,
so I got a lot of attention early on. I was a fan and I'd been deeply in
terested in rock and roll for most of my life. I was very interested in pop
art and the whole notion of popular culture as serious culture, an idea
which I was one of the first people to write about seriously.
INT: You've been writing music criticism for 35 years. How do you
stay excited about it?
RC: Well, what gets me excited about music criticism is music. As near
as I can tell, we can call music an infinitely renewable resource.
I don't go out as much as I used to, but it's pretty remarkable how
many of the shows I do go out to see are really pretty good. The world
of live music has never been my area of concentration, but as far as ex
citement is concerned, it's also an inspiration. Not only are there a few
geniuses out there, but there are also many people who do great work
or just happen to hit it right that night.
When I'm sitting here in a room at home, I know very well that I
could listen to the records in this room for months on end without re
peating myself or playing anything that I've listened to this year, that
gets me excited about music criticism.
I also really care about writing, that's the other part. Writing well
about music is extremely difficult; it never comes easy. That doesn't
mean you never get lucky. Once in a while a sharp idea or an insight or
good joke will come to you quickly. More often, it's a word-by-word
struggle.
As far as language is concerned, if I work hard enough at it, lan
guage is a pretty vast resource as well. So, instead of settling for the
same old adjectives and figures of speech, you can find a new way to
say what sometimes amounts to a very similar thing to what you said
before.

INT: Do you have any formal musical training?
RC: None.
INT: Do you think that's been an asset, a drawback, or neither?
RC: I think it was an asset at the beginning. People who had training
in the beginning have a tendency to really miss the forest for the trees.
Now, however, it's too bad that I can't speak about harmony and note
values, pitch and stuff like that, with more precision. I've listened
enough and read enough that a certain proportion of that vocabulary
is available to me, but not as much as I would like.
INT: How did the current style and format of the Consumer Guide
evolve?
RC: Basically, it began as a way of tweaking my hippie contempo
raries; at the same time, I actually managed to deal with my peculiar
compulsion to listen to every record I got in the mail. It's been a long
time since that has been possible physically or really advisable musi
cally.
When I did have time to listen to everything, I realized that I had a
lot more opinions than there was any way to process verbally unless I
came up with another format. What has changed over time is how it
was written, how seriously I took the writing in it. The prose in the
Consumer Guide has evolved a great deal, the writing has become
more careful.
The strange and paradoxical thing about the Consumer Guide,
however, is the very notion of calling it a Consumer Guide in 1969 was
a slap in the face of the hippie idealists and the anti-capitalists who
were my political allies, but who I never agreed with about the idea
that there wasn't anything good about capitalism. Rock and roll is
proof that something good can come out of capitalism. I think it got
people's attention in a provocative way.
TD: What do you think about the RIAA's recent lawsuits? Do you
have any final thoughts?
RC: Well, when I say that music is an infinitely renewable resource,
that doesn't mean that it's an economically free resource. Although I
think that the RIAA has been horrible and I believe that information
capitalism has been a dangerous force and trend, the simplistic pro
downloading, "let's share" ideology that pervades the alternative
music community is extremely short-sighted and could have disastrous
consequences. Musicians deserve to make a living for their work —
and I don't think that it's extreme to call downloading stealing.
INT: How important do you think criticism is to the music scene
today?
RC: I think it's more important than it used to be. The decline of tra
ditional outlets combined with niche marketing means that there's
much more of a need for informed commentary, gatekeeping and
tastemaking, which is what critics do.
To its immense benefit, America has always had alternative infor
mation dispersal routes, and, you know, the press is far more impor
tant to what happened in music in Great Britain than here because
radio in the United States was varied and vital. Nowadays, it's less so,
despite the existence of college radio, because the mainstream chan
nels have become far more homogenous. For just that reason, in
formed writing now assumes a larger role in the music world today.

mation dispersal routes, and, you know, the press is far more impor
tant to what happened in music in Great Britain than here because
radio in the United States was varied and vital. Nowadays, it's less so,
despite the existence of college radio, because the mainstream chan
nels have become far more homogenous. For just that reason, in
formed writing now assumes a larger role in the music world today.
Robert Christgau's Web site describes him as the "Dean of Amer
ican Rock Critics," and he has the credentials to back it up. He's been
writing about music for more than 35 years, and as a senior editor at
the Village Voice he supervises the Pazz & Jop poll, a nearly compre
hensive annual survey of the nation's pop music critics.
More importantly, his writings — including a long-running "Con
sumer Guide" column in the Voice — capture, distill and transmit a
passionate-but-prickly love of music. His description of Sleater-Kin
ney's "Call the Doctor" ("Few have played rock's tension-and-release
game for such high stakes — revolution as existentialism, electric roar
as acne remedy ... ") is simply exhilarating, and his put-down of Ra
diohead's "OK Computer" ("Radiohead wouldn't know a tragic hero
if they were studying for their A-levels, and their idea of soul is Bono
... ") is pure rock'n'roll sneer.
Christgau's smart, intense and at times blisteringly funny work pro
vides a template for intelligently embracing all that rock has to offer,
with no apologies.
Intermission: How did you first start writing about music?
Robert Christgau: I was being courted by Esquire magazine because I
had done a piece of reportage — which had won a couple of awards.
There was a column there called "Secular Music;" it was being written
by David Newman who had just written a script for a movie called
"Bonnie and Clyde," so he had other concerns. Esquire asked me if I
was interested in the column. I loved the music, so I said, "Sure, I'll do
it."
At the time, there was almost nobody doing this sort of reporting,
so I got a lot of attention early on. I was a fan and I'd been deeply in
terested in rock and roll for most of my life. I was very interested in pop
art and the whole notion of popular culture as serious culture, an idea
which I was one of the first people to write about seriously.
INT: You've been writing music criticism for 35 years. How do you
stay excited about it?
RC: Well, what gets me excited about music criticism is music. As near
as I can tell, we can call music an infinitely renewable resource.
I don't go out as much as I used to, but it's pretty remarkable how
many of the shows I do go out to see are really pretty good. The world
of live music has never been my area of concentration, but as far as ex
citement is concerned, it's also an inspiration. Not only are there a few
geniuses out there, but there are also many people who do great work
or just happen to hit it right that night.
When I'm sitting here in a room at home, I know very well that I
could listen to the records in this room for months on end without re
peating myself or playing anything that I've listened to this year, that
gets me excited about music criticism.
I also really care about writing, that's the other part. Writing well
about music is extremely difficult; it never comes easy. That doesn't
mean you never get lucky. Once in a while a sharp idea or an insight or
good joke will come to you quickly. More often, it's a word-by-word
struggle.
As far as language is concerned, if I work hard enough at it, lan
guage is a pretty vast resource as well. So, instead of settling for the
same old adjectives and figures of speech, you can find a new way to
say what sometimes amounts to a very similar thing to what you said
before.

INT: Do you have any formal musical training?
RC: None.
INT: Do you think that's been an asset, a drawback, or neither?
RC: I think it was an asset at the beginning. People who had training
in the beginning have a tendency to really miss the forest for the trees.
Now, however, it's too bad that I can't speak about harmony and note
values, pitch and stuff like that, with more precision. I've listened
enough and read enough that a certain proportion of that vocabulary
is available to me, but not as much as I would like.
INT: How did the current style and format of the Consumer Guide
evolve?
RC: Basically, it began as a way of tweaking my hippie contempo
raries; at the same time, I actually managed to deal with my peculiar
compulsion to listen to every record I got in the mail. It's been a long
time since that has been possible physically or really advisable musi
cally.
When I did have time to listen to everything, I realized that I had a
lot more opinions than there was any way to process verbally unless I
came up with another format. What has changed over time is how it
was written, how seriously I took the writing in it. The prose in the
Consumer Guide has evolved a great deal, the writing has become
more careful.
The strange and paradoxical thing about the Consumer Guide,
however, is the very notion of calling it a Consumer Guide in 1969 was
a slap in the face of the hippie idealists and the anti-capitalists who
were my political allies, but who I never agreed with about the idea
that there wasn't anything good about capitalism. Rock and roll is
proof that something good can come out of capitalism. I think it got
people's attention in a provocative way.
TD: What do you think about the RIAA's recent lawsuits? Do you
have any final thoughts?
RC: Well, when I say that music is an infinitely renewable resource,
that doesn't mean that it's an economically free resource. Although I
think that the RIAA has been horrible and I believe that information
capitalism has been a dangerous force and trend, the simplistic pro
downloading, "let's share" ideology that pervades the alternative
music community is extremely short-sighted and could have disastrous
consequences. Musicians deserve to make a living for their work —
and I don't think that it's extreme to call downloading stealing.
INT: How important do you think criticism is to the music scene
today?
RC: I think it's more important than it used to be. The decline of tra
ditional outlets combined with niche marketing means that there's
much more of a need for informed commentary, gatekeeping and
tastemaking, which is what critics do.
