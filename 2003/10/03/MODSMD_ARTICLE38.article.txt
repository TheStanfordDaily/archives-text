# Intermission gets 'Well Hung at Dawn'
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman, co-authors of the
Rolling Stone column "Well Hung At Dawn," are irreverent
critics whose wicked prose lends a much-needed edge to the
staid pages of America's official sellout magazine.
They've been known to fiercely defend indie-aesthetics and
generally spew witty one-liners about bands they hate. And
they hate a lot of bands. But, as I found out in this interview,
Jason and Michael — who began working together at "Ray
Gun" magazine — are essentially rock critics with an infec
tious and undiminished passion for music; they know the only
way to do this job well is to not do it seriously. Kind of like
rock 'n' roll.
INTERMISSION: For the benefit of our readers, could you
explain exactly what the title of your column means?
MICHAEL KRUGMAN: [laughs] Well, I'll tell you. The first
time we heard the expression was from our good friend and
hero, the great Julian Cope, and he was saving it for an album
title later on, which he is yet to use, so I figure we're good with
it. And it actually implies what they did to traders in the morn
ing — the trader would be well hung at dawn. And of course,
you know, we were also referring to the size of our enormous
genitals. The combination of the fact that we were treasonists
and packing enormous genitals really went together nicely, I
think.
JASON COHEN: That's a double entendre? I missed that.
INT: Do you guys receive a lot of hate mail?
[laughter]
JC: Not nearly enough.
MK: You know, we actually [made some wise-cracks] a few
weeks before Warren Zevon died, just hoping to get some
hate mail because we miss getting the hate mail. And nobody
responded.
JC: You can't do it on purpose I think. It happens by accident
— the Radiohead thing obviously is an ongoing thing, where
everyone knows we hate Radiohead and they love to argue
with us. Other times it's just random — when Pearl Jam were
struck by that tragedy up in Roskilde it was just a throwaway
one-liner we made about how they always wanted to be like
The Who. Just a little thing, and little did we know it was going
to get us on page six of the New York Post.
INT: [extremely hurt] Why do you hate Radiohead?
(they both laugh)
MK: Well, you know it's funny — it's one of those things
where we've been hating them for so long that we've kind of
lost the ability to describe why. We could both go on to any
number of political reasons — to me they're really a bunch of
phony-baloneys in terms of their anti-corporate stance and
yet still working for EMI and all that stuff. Largely, I think
their music is very dull and pretentious. And I think a lot of
their fans [do too], but they can't admit it at this point, so they
just keep going.

JC: I don't know if they really are cynical as far as being capi
talist in their hearts —but I do know that in their hearts they
have this weird thing where they're afraid to write songs ...
and they're afraid to think that people might actually like
[them]. Kind of the same as with Kurt — he got so worked
about the fact that "'Nevermind' was too popular and too
good so I have scale back" — and unfortunately for him he lit
erally couldn't live with that. But with Radiohead, so far they
can.
MK: I know a ton of people who went out and bought "Hail
To The Thief" — they're all excited: "The new Radiohead!
The new Radiohead! This is the one that's going to be their
'song' record!" and of course it's not and it's really kind of
wanky and whiny and there's some interesting instrumental
stuff but for the most part, Thorn Yorke is a plank.
JC: And then they get credit for playing "Creep." They not
play it long enough and now when they do — everyone's like
"Oh isn't it cool that they re-imagined the song that'd been
such a monkey on their back." And they're just doing it be
cause people want to hear "Creep."
MK: And then there's that whole level of "we refuse to play
the song people want to hear." Everything about them rubs us
wrong. They're humorless and they don't tickle our enormous
genitals, basically.
INT: But on the opposite end of the spectrum — you recently
referred to The Rapture as "The Crapture." Why do you hate
them?
MK: You know, what's funny is that people always seem to
latch on to what we hate when the truth is that week after
week we are telling people what we love ... The whole punk
funk explosion — mostly the New York bands like The Rap
ture and Interpol —we're too old [for it]. I'm going to be forty
next year and Jason's close. And so I remember the "Mud
Club," hearing "Too Many Creeps" when it came out and the
truth is that hearing it redone by a bunch of pseudo-hip truck -
er-hat-wearing-wankers really doesn't move me.
INT: I'm curious — what do you guys think of the "rock crit
ic establishment"?
JC: The rock critic establishment — there doesn't seem like
there is much of one anymore. There doesn't seem to be an
audience ... I find it hard to believe that there's a 16-year-old
kid out there like we were who eagerly consumes a bunch of
people's prose and uses that as a guide to tell them what to like
and to discover older bands and really latches on to an aes
thetic, because everything [these days] is 75-five words long.
MK: And if those kinds are out there, they're being told to lis
ten to John Mayer because the rock critics and magazines
working today are so afraid of losing their audience that they
feel obligated to write about this music that seems to be sell
ing. It's this ... kind of snake eating its tail thing. The truth is
that no rock critic is going home and listening to John Mayer
JC: And maybe the audience isn't there ... And [what really
gets me] is NME in a way, because it really used to be this bas
tion of more intelligent and obscure stuff and you can see

them being forced to play the same game and maybe that's be
cause they're owned now by Time Warner, but it's also be
cause of the audience ...
MK: There's another problem — because of the rise of the
hip-ness of American bands, British indie-bands are getting
the short-shift. So we're finding bands all the time that we
think are brilliant, but unfortunately the rock critic establish
ment has become very establishment. So there is no more un
derground, which is where great bands used to come out of.
The Rapture — it's sad but true — they should be an under
ground band, but they're some hell not.
INT: What current bands are you into? What music did you
grow up listening to?
MK: We love The Strokes. Like a lot. We've gotten a lot of
crap like — oh, we don't like what's popular. And the truth is
we just like what's good — I love that they're getting huge; I
would like them to get bigger. We like The White Stripes.
We're not contrary for the sake of being contrary.
JC: Michael has a story with a jacket.
MK: When 1 was in high-school, it was the beginning years of
punk, and I was hanging out with punk people and I was also
hanging out with some hippies. I was moved by the politics
and music of both things — this was back in 1978-79 and I had
a jacket with the "Steel Your Face" logo with The Clash logo
above it. And it used to make the hippies out of their mind be
cause this was still a point in time when punk was the devil and
the punks would go out of their mind, because, you know, hip
pies suck. And we've always sort of operated like that... You
know I never understand why I could never listen to The Jam
and The Buzzcocks and other bands, [in the same way] as Van
Halen, or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and the Interna
tional Submarine Band. And you know: Music is music is
music. And that's one of the good things that's happened in
recent years — that people aren't as bound by genre. But for
both of us our main fields of interest are British, psychedelic,
indie.
INT: Sure, there seem to a lot of great indie-bands out there.
But who's the next Beatles?
MK: People often look for that. Maybe there isn't anything
left to innovate. Maybe there isn't anything new under the sun
... All of these New York bands — Stellastarr and The Fever
— I've just heard it done a million times. The trick, like The
Strokes, is to do it with a modern slant, is to turn it into some
thing new. You know, we were in the middle of Travis-mania
when The Strokes came along.
JC: I mean, who were the last Beatles? In the end — does Nir
vana get any credit? Which hip-hop act gets credit and even
that — is it ultimately significant? It's still very significant, ob
viously, but not Beatles-significant or Elvis-significant.
INT: Thanks a lot guys. I'd just like to let you know that the
other rock critic we're interviewing for this feature is Robert
Christgau.
MK: [laughs] I say you've gone from one end of the spectrum
to the other with that. He's the dean and we're the dropouts.

erally couldn't live with that. But with Radiohead, so far they
can.
MK: I know a ton of people who went out and bought "Hail
To The Thief" — they're all excited: "The new Radiohead!
The new Radiohead! This is the one that's going to be their
'song' record!" and of course it's not and it's really kind of
wanky and whiny and there's some interesting instrumental
stuff but for the most part, Thorn Yorke is a plank.
JC: And then they get credit for playing "Creep." They not
play it long enough and now when they do — everyone's like
"Oh isn't it cool that they re-imagined the song that'd been
such a monkey on their back." And they're just doing it be
cause people want to hear "Creep."
MK: And then there's that whole level of "we refuse to play
the song people want to hear." Everything about them rubs us
wrong. They're humorless and they don't tickle our enormous
genitals, basically.
INT: But on the opposite end of the spectrum — you recently
referred to The Rapture as "The Crapture." Why do you hate
them?
MK: You know, what's funny is that people always seem to
latch on to what we hate when the truth is that week after
week we are telling people what we love ... The whole punk
funk explosion — mostly the New York bands like The Rap
ture and Interpol —we're too old [for it]. I'm going to be forty
next year and Jason's close. And so I remember the "Mud
Club," hearing "Too Many Creeps" when it came out and the
truth is that hearing it redone by a bunch of pseudo-hip truck -
er-hat-wearing-wankers really doesn't move me.
INT: I'm curious — what do you guys think of the "rock crit
ic establishment"?
JC: The rock critic establishment — there doesn't seem like
there is much of one anymore. There doesn't seem to be an
audience ... I find it hard to believe that there's a 16-year-old
kid out there like we were who eagerly consumes a bunch of
people's prose and uses that as a guide to tell them what to like
and to discover older bands and really latches on to an aes
thetic, because everything [these days] is 75-five words long.
MK: And if those kinds are out there, they're being told to lis
ten to John Mayer because the rock critics and magazines
working today are so afraid of losing their audience that they
feel obligated to write about this music that seems to be sell
ing. It's this ... kind of snake eating its tail thing. The truth is
that no rock critic is going home and listening to John Mayer
JC: And maybe the audience isn't there ... And [what really
gets me] is NME in a way, because it really used to be this bas
tion of more intelligent and obscure stuff and you can see

them being forced to play the same game and maybe that's be
cause they're owned now by Time Warner, but it's also be
cause of the audience ...
MK: There's another problem — because of the rise of the
hip-ness of American bands, British indie-bands are getting
the short-shift. So we're finding bands all the time that we
think are brilliant, but unfortunately the rock critic establish
ment has become very establishment. So there is no more un
derground, which is where great bands used to come out of.
The Rapture — it's sad but true — they should be an under
ground band, but they're some hell not.
INT: What current bands are you into? What music did you
grow up listening to?
MK: We love The Strokes. Like a lot. We've gotten a lot of
crap like — oh, we don't like what's popular. And the truth is
we just like what's good — I love that they're getting huge; I
would like them to get bigger. We like The White Stripes.
We're not contrary for the sake of being contrary.
JC: Michael has a story with a jacket.
MK: When 1 was in high-school, it was the beginning years of
punk, and I was hanging out with punk people and I was also
hanging out with some hippies. I was moved by the politics
and music of both things — this was back in 1978-79 and I had
a jacket with the "Steel Your Face" logo with The Clash logo
above it. And it used to make the hippies out of their mind be
cause this was still a point in time when punk was the devil and
the punks would go out of their mind, because, you know, hip
pies suck. And we've always sort of operated like that... You
know I never understand why I could never listen to The Jam
and The Buzzcocks and other bands, [in the same way] as Van
Halen, or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and the Interna
tional Submarine Band. And you know: Music is music is
music. And that's one of the good things that's happened in
recent years — that people aren't as bound by genre. But for
both of us our main fields of interest are British, psychedelic,
indie.
INT: Sure, there seem to a lot of great indie-bands out there.
But who's the next Beatles?
MK: People often look for that. Maybe there isn't anything
left to innovate. Maybe there isn't anything new under the sun
... All of these New York bands — Stellastarr and The Fever
— I've just heard it done a million times. The trick, like The
Strokes, is to do it with a modern slant, is to turn it into some
thing new. You know, we were in the middle of Travis-mania
when The Strokes came along.
JC: I mean, who were the last Beatles? In the end — does Nir
vana get any credit? Which hip-hop act gets credit and even
that — is it ultimately significant? It's still very significant, ob
viously, but not Beatles-significant or Elvis-significant.
INT: Thanks a lot guys. I'd just like to let you know that the
other rock critic we're interviewing for this feature is Robert
Christgau.
MK: [laughs] I say you've gone from one end of the spectrum
to the other with that. He's the dean and we're the dropouts.
Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman, co-authors of the
Rolling Stone column "Well Hung At Dawn," are irreverent
critics whose wicked prose lends a much-needed edge to the
staid pages of America's official sellout magazine.
They've been known to fiercely defend indie-aesthetics and
generally spew witty one-liners about bands they hate. And
they hate a lot of bands. But, as I found out in this interview,
Jason and Michael — who began working together at "Ray
Gun" magazine — are essentially rock critics with an infec
tious and undiminished passion for music; they know the only
way to do this job well is to not do it seriously. Kind of like
rock 'n' roll.
INTERMISSION: For the benefit of our readers, could you
explain exactly what the title of your column means?
MICHAEL KRUGMAN: [laughs] Well, I'll tell you. The first
time we heard the expression was from our good friend and
hero, the great Julian Cope, and he was saving it for an album
title later on, which he is yet to use, so I figure we're good with
it. And it actually implies what they did to traders in the morn
ing — the trader would be well hung at dawn. And of course,
you know, we were also referring to the size of our enormous
genitals. The combination of the fact that we were treasonists
and packing enormous genitals really went together nicely, I
think.
JASON COHEN: That's a double entendre? I missed that.
INT: Do you guys receive a lot of hate mail?
[laughter]
JC: Not nearly enough.
MK: You know, we actually [made some wise-cracks] a few
weeks before Warren Zevon died, just hoping to get some
hate mail because we miss getting the hate mail. And nobody
responded.
JC: You can't do it on purpose I think. It happens by accident
— the Radiohead thing obviously is an ongoing thing, where
everyone knows we hate Radiohead and they love to argue
with us. Other times it's just random — when Pearl Jam were
struck by that tragedy up in Roskilde it was just a throwaway
one-liner we made about how they always wanted to be like
The Who. Just a little thing, and little did we know it was going
to get us on page six of the New York Post.
INT: [extremely hurt] Why do you hate Radiohead?
(they both laugh)
MK: Well, you know it's funny — it's one of those things
where we've been hating them for so long that we've kind of
lost the ability to describe why. We could both go on to any
number of political reasons — to me they're really a bunch of
phony-baloneys in terms of their anti-corporate stance and
yet still working for EMI and all that stuff. Largely, I think
their music is very dull and pretentious. And I think a lot of
their fans [do too], but they can't admit it at this point, so they
just keep going.

JC: I don't know if they really are cynical as far as being capi
talist in their hearts —but I do know that in their hearts they
have this weird thing where they're afraid to write songs ...
and they're afraid to think that people might actually like
[them]. Kind of the same as with Kurt — he got so worked
about the fact that "'Nevermind' was too popular and too
good so I have scale back" — and unfortunately for him he lit
erally couldn't live with that. But with Radiohead, so far they
can.
MK: I know a ton of people who went out and bought "Hail

derground, which is where great bands used to come out of.
The Rapture — it's sad but true — they should be an under
ground band, but they're some hell not.
INT: What current bands are you into? What music did you
grow up listening to?
MK: We love The Strokes. Like a lot. We've gotten a lot of
crap like — oh, we don't like what's popular. And the truth is
we just like what's good — I love that they're getting huge; I
would like them to get bigger. We like The White Stripes.
We're not contrary for the sake of being contrary.
JC: Michael has a story with a jacket.
MK: When 1 was in high-school, it was the beginning years of
punk, and I was hanging out with punk people and I was also
hanging out with some hippies. I was moved by the politics
and music of both things — this was back in 1978-79 and I had
a jacket with the "Steel Your Face" logo with The Clash logo
above it. And it used to make the hippies out of their mind be
cause this was still a point in time when punk was the devil and
the punks would go out of their mind, because, you know, hip
pies suck. And we've always sort of operated like that... You
know I never understand why I could never listen to The Jam
and The Buzzcocks and other bands, [in the same way] as Van
Halen, or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and the Interna
tional Submarine Band. And you know: Music is music is
music. And that's one of the good things that's happened in
recent years — that people aren't as bound by genre. But for
both of us our main fields of interest are British, psychedelic,
indie.
INT: Sure, there seem to a lot of great indie-bands out there.
But who's the next Beatles?
MK: People often look for that. Maybe there isn't anything
left to innovate. Maybe there isn't anything new under the sun
... All of these New York bands — Stellastarr and The Fever
— I've just heard it done a million times. The trick, like The
Strokes, is to do it with a modern slant, is to turn it into some
thing new. You know, we were in the middle of Travis-mania
when The Strokes came along.
JC: I mean, who were the last Beatles? In the end — does Nir
vana get any credit? Which hip-hop act gets credit and even
that — is it ultimately significant? It's still very significant, ob
viously, but not Beatles-significant or Elvis-significant.
INT: Thanks a lot guys. I'd just like to let you know that the
other rock critic we're interviewing for this feature is Robert
Christgau.
MK: [laughs] I say you've gone from one end of the spectrum
to the other with that. He's the dean and we're the dropouts.
