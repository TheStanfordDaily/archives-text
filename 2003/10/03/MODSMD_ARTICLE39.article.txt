### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Bothered by the burden of a boomerang-shaped penis? If
you or your lover is plagued by the same condition that Tom
Cruise has, then fret not. Although it may have been one of the
reasons for Tom's split-up with Nicole, most crooked penises
are merely natural variations of penis shapes—unless it's so
bent that it won't fit all the way inside the hole. But even these
seemingly hopeless penises can be put to good use, as Roxy's
experience has proven.
One hot hot night this summer, Roxy got down and dirty
with a tall sexy stud she met at the beach. After giving each
other pleasure (circuitry is so sexy!), Roxy held the L-shaped
penis in her hand and decided that instead of her usual deep

thrusting rides, she wanted to try using it as a G-spot stimulat
ing vibrator instead. The result? One of the best and longest
lasting orgasms ever! Only second in line to that one time Roxy
did three guys simultaneously in the South Stacks at Green.
The harder tall sexy stud tried to ram it in, the Gloser Roxy was
to reaching the peaks of the mountains which stood as semi
porous barriers to the white water rapids of her lust. Goodbye
crooked vibrator; hello crooked fella!
But if this entire idea still doesn't sound hopeful for you,
there are some other measures that you could take to solve
your problem. Visiting your physician may be the safest way to
get a hand on the problem (and see if you really are gay) while
waiting for advice; however, Roxy would like to share some of
the old tricks that might work just as well as a visit to the doc
tor.

Trick number one: tie a stick to the dick and hope that
after time, it'll straighten out. Although it may be painful every
time you get aroused and hard, why wouldn't it work? Anoth
er solution is to find a female who has a crooked vagina so that
the crooked dick could fit into the crooked vagina like a hand
does in a glove. It might be a little tough to get it in at first, but
hey, what can be better than glove sex? Oh, right—crooked
sex.
If anything, you can become creative by having sex at
strange new positions, perhaps a boomerang position in which
both or multiple partners are bent at 90 degree angles to emu
late the shape of the dick. Whatever solution you choose, rest
assured that you are not alone. Many other penises out there
share in your twisted pain. Don't let that stop you from turning
pain into pleasure.
