# Students prepare to celebrate Yom Kippur
## Services and activities will be open to all students this weekend 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yom Kippur celebrations this weekend will pro
vide both Jewish and non-Jewish students with a full
range of cultural activities. Among other events, liber
al, conservative and orthodox services will be offered
to reach out to the broader Stanford community.
The holiday begins Sunday night with a pre-Yom

Kippur meal for about 100 pre-registered students.
The services will take place Sunday and throughout
the day on Monday. Workshops hosted by Hillel will
also take place between the services, and some stu
dents plan to fast for 25 hours. Two break-fasts will be
offered on Sunday night as well.
"It's hard because classes are still in session,
whereas normally I would take the day off for
prayer," said sophomore Shari Ilsen, chief financial
officer for the Jewish Leadership Council. "Nonethe
less, Yom Kippur is essentially the most important
Jewish holiday of the year, so it's important that
everyone can feel connected to it in some way."
Beginning with Rosh Hashanah, there is a 10-day

period of introspection for Jews culminating with
Yom Kippur â€” the Day of Atonement.
"It is a holiday on which we ask one another for
forgiveness, and, according to tradition, are then
given a 'clean slate' to begin the new year," says
Adina Danzig, interim executive director of Hillel.
"It is a time that we think about ourselves as individ
uals and how we wish to be better in the coming year.
It is usually observed through prayer, fasting and ask
ing those we may have wronged for forgiveness."
Given the importance of Yom Kippur, Hillel is ex
pecting several hundred students to observe the holi
day, a much larger number than last
year's services, which fell before
many students had arrived on cam
pus. Non-Jewish students are also
welcome to attend, and a handful
has pre-registered.
"We have a robust pluralistic cele
bration of this and all holidays, [so] we
now offer three services," Danzig said.
Rabbi Mychal Copeland will lead

the liberal service and Rabbi Joey
Felsen will deliver the orthodox service.
"Services at Stanford have always
appealed to a broad Jewish commu
nity," said sophomore Amanda
Schwartz, who frequents Jewish
community events. "However, I
think the additional rabbis will draw
in an even larger crowd from Stan
ford and the neighboring area."
Though Yom Kippur is intended
to be a solemn holiday, event coordi
nators said they hope the services
kick off an energetic new year for
the Hillel organization.
