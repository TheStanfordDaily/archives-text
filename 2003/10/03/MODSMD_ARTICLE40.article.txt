# Setting the Ruf on fire
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
This morning started out great. My drawmate Ami bounced
into my room to tell my that she had just been offered a job at one
of her top-choice companies. We squealed. We hugged. Then, we
sat down on my bed to talk about it: Aren't we lucky, aren't we
smart, and so on. You know how it is; you go to Stanford, too.
But then something odd happened. Our euphoria dissipated,
and our conversation drifted into silence. After a while, Ami said
something like, "God. I'm so depressed."
"Me, too," I responded, not knowing why.
Then, I realized just why we had gone from ecstasy to depres
sion in 60 seconds. As we had been talking, the new Rufus Wain
wright album I was supposed to review, "Want One," had been

playing in the background.
"You think you're so
young and beautiful and im- ,
portant?" Rufus seemed to |
be asking, before answering:
"Just you wait and see when
you turn, turn 23." The song in
which he sings those words is titled "Vicious World," and Rufus
wants to make sure his listeners realize how vicious the world really
is. Especially when you reach that foreboding age.
Why is Rufus so unhappy? Easy. After spending the past few
years swimming through a more-or-less constant, coked-up orgy,
Rufus is pleased to announce he's gone clean. Good for him, and all
that. Unfortunately, reformed addicts make depressing musicians
â€” even when the song's instrumentation consists, rather incongru
ously, of tweeting recorders that sound like the kind you learned to
play in the fifth grade, as far as I can tell.
Last time I saw Rufus Wainwright in concert, he was wearing a
big fur coat and making big, generous jokes and proclaiming his love
of life, cigarettes and chocolate milk to a room full of gay men and
30-something women. Everyone was smiling, including Rufus. In
retrospect, I realize he must have been as coked-up as ever on that
night. But so what? The important thing is that it was fun, really fun.
I laughed a lot.
Fast-forward to today, when I nearly let Rufus convince me
with his lyrics and anthemic whine that maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if I fell out my third-floor window in Roble and ended it all. Fortu
nately, I was able to drag myself to my laptop and click on the stop
button in MusicMatch Jukebox before anything too drastic hap
pened.
Meanwhile, as far as I've heard, Rufus is still be festering in a
swamp of earnest sobriety. It's like, honey, do I need to pour a line
into your nostril for you to make happy music again?


Don't think I'm not taking this up with my stylist.
