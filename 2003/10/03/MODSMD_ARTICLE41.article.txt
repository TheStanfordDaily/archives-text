# Vertical Horizon even balder than before

### BRENDAN MARTEN DESK EDITOR 
While I've always wanted to be a rock superstar, I am intimidated by the process of writing
songs. How does one come up with so many different melodies and messages for one's com
positions and still ensure that every song is not just pleasing to the ear, but also groundbreak
ing?
Unfortunately, we're not all wired like Kurt Cobain. But luckily for the
group Vertical Horizon, lead vocalist and sing writer Matt Scannell has
found an ample substitute approach that is nearly as commercially viable.
Find a decent "moderate rock" sound and develop a sappy song theme.
Repeat it 10 or 11 times and you've got yourself a best-selling rock record
Appropriately enough, Vertical Horizon's newest release "Go" almost
invariably exemplifies this radio-friendly approach to making music.
Scannell sets the stage with "When You Cry" by crooning about his significant other and
cheerfully exclaiming that he's "only sad when there's tears in your eyes." But this chick obvi
ously had her share of Scannell's saccharine and over-reflective nature, and by track two has
already dumped him.
At this point, the record quickly loses the little momentum it had. Scannell spends the ma
jority of the remaining songs dwelling on his loss, reapplying the following formula: Reminisce

about good times, have the girl deny the guy, and most importantly, be sure the guy still gives
a shit and is willing to be tread upon emotionally for all time and eternity
It is ironic that the album's press release comments that the record could have alternatively
been entitled "Go, Already!" — in reference to the long period since Vertical Horizon's last
release in 1999, the double-platinum "Everything You Want" — as this title could equally
apply to the record's content.

The song "Sunshine" initially appears to be a breath of fresh air, but the re
lief only lasts for some 19 seconds, as Scannell offers the predictable whim
per of a refrain, "I see you, do you see me too?" that neatly sums up the only
question that is posed for the rest of the album.
"Underwater," the closing track of the record, brings a welcome change of
pace that is both too little and too late. In this mellow acoustic piece, which
stands in contrast to the rock-guitar-riff-ridden cuts that gorge the earlier tracks
of the album, Scannell still pointlessly pleads, "I feel your touch, will you pull me up again?"
But finally, it isn't the overused theme of pain and anguish that wears most on the listener,
but rather, the nauseatingly persistent soft-boiled attitude of Scannell that borders on insin
cerity. Sinatra can sing all damn day about how his heart has been broken, but that's alright,
because it's easy to believe the guy. On the other hand, Scannell lacks such a sense of credi
bility and comes off as if he's more interested in publishing profitable pop tunes than whoev
er it was that left his ass high and dry after track one.
