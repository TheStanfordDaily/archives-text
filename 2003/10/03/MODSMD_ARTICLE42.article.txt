## Saves the Day can't save itself 
### JOSHUA SMITH 
With Saves the Day's fourth album, "In Reverie," the former emo
punks do their best to emulate the breakup-happy girls they sing about —
and they leave punk rock alone in the cold.
The young New Jersey quartet (along with bands like A New Found
Glory) was prominent in bringing
sophomoric, yet emotionally bru
tally honest, pop-punk to
America's suburban high |
schools. "In Reverie" com
pletes the band's arc from punk
to pop-punk to pop that began
with the its 1998 debut album, "Can't
Slow Down" and continued through 2001's "Stay What You Are."
From the mainstream-sounding rock 'n' roll hook that kick-starts the
opener "Anywhere With You," listeners can tell Saves the Day has ven
tured onto a path more traveled. That being said, "In Reverie" is more
than just a foray into pop from some emo kids; it represents a maturing
band attempting to achieve artistic respectability. And to a certain extent,
they succeed. Even with synthesizers, saccharine harmonies and the
soapy-clean sound favored by producer Rob Schnapf (early Beck, The
Anniversary) Saves the Day manages to preserve its earlier innocence and
attain an attractive indie rock vibe.
The new slower, more subdued style works best in songs like "Driving
in the Dark" where a quietly forceful drumbeat effectively leads the syn
thesizers through a catchy chorus that successfully balances the addition
al instrumentation. However, too much of the album sounds like "Rise"
or "Wednesday the Third," with cheesy keyboards and harmonies that
simply make the songs too poppy for their own good. More agreeable re
sults occur when Saves the Day tries to power through the fluff and rock
out, as on "Morning to Moonlight" or "Where are You?"
Throughout the album, lead singer Chris Conley's familiar delicate,
high-pitched voice sounds more melodic than in the past. The emotional
edginess is gone. For the most part, the vocals are relegated to the back of
the mix, flowing in and out of the guitar lines. The singer's lyrical content
has clearly developed along with his maturing vocal style. The words on
"In Reverie" are more vague yet more powerful than on previous efforts.
"She is the sloping clouds / forever scrolling, unfolding," Conley sings on
"She," an acoustic love ballad (nope, no breakups here!) that even adds a
violin by its conclusion.
"In Reverie" shows Saves the Day moving closer to bubbly pop with
mixed results. The songs are more grown-up, involving characters who
can actually hang on to girlfriends. For Saves the Day, hanging on to its
traditional fan base will prove more of a challenge.
