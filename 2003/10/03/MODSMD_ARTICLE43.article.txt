# Chagall hangs at SF MOMA

### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
With the requisite handful recognizable paintings
like "I and the Village" (1911) or "The Birthday"
(1915), Mark Chagall is about as well-known as any 20th
century artist. During his 98-year life, he produced a
great oeuvre of paintings, drawings and commissions like
the stained glass windows at the United Nations. The
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is currently of
fering a wonderful retrospective, "Mark Chagall,"
through Nov. 4.
The show gathers an impressive array of images from
collections like the Russian state museum in St. Peters
burg, the rarely traveled Moscow Jewish Theatre im
ages, and numerous private collections; the scope of the
exhibit bears witness to the SF MOMA's increasing
stature; it is now undeniable that this West coast institu
tion has become a peer of the modern art museums of
New York, including the NY MOMA, the Guggenheim
and the Whitney.
Chagall's life (1887-1985) and biography (he lived in
Russia, Paris and New York and worked alongside
artists like Modigliani, Leger, Chaim Soutine and poets
like Guillaume Apollinaire) lay him right across the
most crucial period of modern art, as abstractionism
grew out of impressionism and cubism into the domi
nant form of 20th century art. For his own part, Chagall
clung fiercely to his own brand of whimsical, often sur
realistic representationalism, while at times incorporat
ing styles and elements from those around him, like
Braque, Gaugin and Modigliani.
Like his contemporary Pablo Picasso, the roi of 20th
century European Art, Chagall resists classification. He
moved fluidly across so many styles throughout his ca

reer and attached himself to no artistic school (or
schools). What brings his oeuvre together is a joyous, un
matched commitment to color â€” almost all Chagall
paintings are full of strong, bright colors-as well as a
ubiquitous freedom of spirit.
Chagall is also unique among 20th century masters in
his commitment to painting and to celebrating Judaism
and Jewish culture, particularly the pre-modern forms
of the oft-persecuted Russian Jewry
This exhibit is packed with treasures. It covers most
of Chagall's career, with particular strength in the teens,
20s and 30s and some weakness in the last few decades
of his life. But it also includes sketches, watercolors and
large-scale paintings. A few of the gems to look for: A
1917-18 painting "The Apparition" which is his version
of an annunciation scene, with himself the painter as
Mary receiving Gabriel. Set in a duotone X pattern, with
one half of the canvas washed in bright blue and the
other half in grays and whites, it's an absolutely beauti
ful and unique work. See it now, as it will return to its
private home after the show.
"The Red Jew" from 1915 is pure Chagall; the pa
thetic solitary figure has a red beard, one green hand,
two disparate and misshapen shoes and is surrounded
by Chagall's usual array of dreamily placed background
items: a tree, a house, a paintbrush, some Hebrew let
ters. Save a few minutes for the second-to-last room,
which is Chagall's mid-career series illustrating the
Bible. "The White Crucifixion" (1938) is an awesome
example of how the 20th century's shaking (but not for
saking) of traditionally rigid forms can render images in
new and powerful ways. Chagall's is a Jesus to remem
ber.


What? No goats with violins in this painting?
