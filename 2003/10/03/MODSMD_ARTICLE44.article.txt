# No 'LOVE' FOR THIS 'SPEAKERBOXXX'
## 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
Outkast's new album release, "Speakerboxxx /
The Love Below" is not your average hip-hop
album. In this double album, the duo made up of
Big Boi and Andre 3000, who in the past have
worked together as Outkast, split up between the
two CDs. Big Boi's "Speakerboxxx" sounds more
distinctly Outkast, with a harder edge. Andre, on
"The Love Below," barely raps at
all, mostly singing as if he's parody
ing cheesy love songs from the
1940s.
The first two songs on ,
"Speakerboxxx" are an instant
turnoff. Fortunately, it gets a little bet
ter after that. "Unhappy," the third track, takes
the slightly annoying techno beats that punctuate
the beginning of the album, and adds a decent
melody, resulting in a catchy combination. In
"Bowtie," backup singers lend a much-needed
punch to the otherwise bland rap. In the midst of
an album about alcohol, getting laid and housing
projects, "War" stands out as a fairly serious,
smart song. Big Boi really showcases his rapping
ability in this song, as he asks "When will we wake
up out of this dream / Come here and smell the
Folgers, the soldiers / The human beings, Man act

ing as if he was the Supreme Being."
"The Love Below" is like an entire album of in
terludes. Outside of "Hey Ya," which sounds pop
ish enough for it to be a hit, and "Roses," a laugh
able song about "Caroline / the reason for the
word bitch," which has a good beat and some sub
stance to the melody, the album oscillates between
just plain annoying and annoying â€” but at least
sort of funny.
This makes for an in
teresting contrast with
"Speakerboxxx," which,
outside of those few singles,
is entirely unremarkable.
Maybe if Outkast had com
bined the two albums, re
moving the worse half of each, they would have
come up with something pretty good. Unfortu
nately, there's a lot of extraneous material includ
ed in both albums, so it's hard to listen to either of
them all the way through.
My recommendation for this album? Down
load a couple of the good singles from the internet,
because even at only $14, the album is just not
worth buying. A few catchy songs on "Speaker
boxxx" don't make up for the fact that "The Love
Below" sounds like a Disney soundtrack gone
horribly wrong.


Peace out, kast.
