# New housing could be built
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost John Bravman is establishing a housing com
mittee that will offer suggestions for the creation of 300 more
undergraduate bed spaces on campus, as a solution for Stan
ford's housing shortage.
Though Bravman did not discuss any immediate plans for a
new dormitory, the last time the University established such a
committee in 1997, it resulted in the creation of Freshman /
Sophomore College and the sophomore program at Toyon.
The University has long considered increasing the number
of bed spaces available to undergrads, Bravman said. In recent
years, the University has converted many rooms from singles
to doubles and doubles to triples to meet demand and maintain
its four-year housing guarantee.
"It is no secret that ideally we would like to have more beds on
campus," Bravman said. "It is very difficult, however, to raise
enough money for such a large project. We need to make a strong
pitch to raise the funds needed to increment our bed space."
Bravman said the University has not yet received any do
nations for this housing initiative.
Students agree that the University needs to take action to
alleviate the overcrowding problem. When sophomore Adam
Schwartz moved into his room last year in Naranja, he found it
very small for two people. He later learned his room had once
been a single, but had been converted into a freshman one
room double.
"It just doesn't seem right that someone once paid the same
amount of money that I did for that room, yet I had a room
mate, an extra bed, an extra desk and an extra dresser,"
Schwartz said.
When the new committee convenes within the next few
weeks, Bravman hopes to evaluate the Draw and the Residen
tial Education Program in addition to the University's need for
more bed spaces.
"We have done a lot for undergraduate education in the
past few years, and we want to make sure that the residential
system is part of that and contributes to the overall undergrad
uate experience," Bravman said.
Though Bravman has not yet released the names of indi
viduals serving on the committee, he said that it would be com
posed of a relatively small group of faculty, students and ad
ministrators.
