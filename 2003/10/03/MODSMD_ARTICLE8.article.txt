## BRANNER NO LONGER SUCKS 
### brendan selby 
"Branner sucks!" From the
moment the chanting began
in crowded Memorial Audito
rium during New Student Ori
entation, it became unmistak
ably clear that Branner Hall,
the grand dame of frosh
dorms, was back in business.
After a nine-month, $20 mil
lion facelift, Branner has once
again opened its doors, to a
new crop of freshmen.

The new Branner has been labeled by
both residents and outsiders as a palace, a
resort and "a mansion of freshman orgy
ness." It has been open for just a short
while, but already, it is easy to see why.
Upon entering Branner, one is greeted
by potted plants, artwork on the walls, high
ceilings, spacious balconies and marble
bathroom stalls — all of which give the in
terior of the dorm an aesthetically pleasing
appearance. The lounge is upholstered, re
plete with wainscoted paneling, and a fire
place and expansive French windows look
out on an ample new courtyard.
"Before coming here, I didn't know the
history of Branner at all, but when I talked
to other people about Branner, they all
told me how lucky I was," says freshman
Shaun Phillips, a swimmer from Tennessee
living on the second floor. "It struck me as

being like a hotel."
Indeed, it is hard for some residents to
complain about their situation. When
asked to name the worst aspect of living at
Branner, Phillips looks puzzled. Turning to
his roommate, he asks, "Is there anything
really bad here? Oh yeah, the sinks. They
turn temperature all of a sudden."
Temperamental plumbing aside, the re
sponse to renovations has been over
whelmingly positive. According to fresh
man Heidi Boyd, another Branner resi
dent, "People who used to live here tell us
how nice it looks after the renovation.
They told us it had bats and asbestos be
fore, so that's an improvement."
Reviews of the food are also favorable:
"Amazing," says freshman Kanyi
Maqubela. "It's like Wilbur, except you

don't have to pay $10 for every meal."
'Branimal House'
In past years, Branner has earned a rep
utation for being a noisy and chaotic hub of
social activity. With its 165 freshmen, the
new Branner is sure to carry on this tradi
tion. After all, it isn't called "Branimal
House" for no reason.
"Everyone is so excited to be here,"
Maqubela says. "On the weekends it's
pretty loud. There was a toga party last
weekend."
Still, the new policy prohibiting alcohol
from common areas in all-frosh dorms en
sures that this year's social scene will not
degenerate into a drunken bacchanal. For
some residents, that's just fine.
"I think it's a good rule," Phillips says.
"[The policy] is definitely going to tone
down large house gatherings. I personally
do not drink, so I don't have to worry about
people running around with beers in the
halls and being crazy."

Senior Kevin
Shen, one of
Branner's resi
dent advisers,
evaluates the
policy favor
ably.
"The drink
ing is less preva
lent than it was
three years
ago," he says.
"Kids are hav
ing fun, but we
are anxiously
awaiting more
alternative pro
gramming that
was promised
along with the
alcohol policy."
Since most of
the students in
the dorm ap
plied for all
frosh housing,
Branner is full
of students who
are content liv
ing there.
Nonetheless,
there are a few
freshmen resi
dents for whom
living in an all
frosh dorm was
not a top choice.
Freshman
Jessie Becker
applied for

four-class housing but was placed in Bran
ner instead. She was initially worried by
the large number of residents.
"It makes it easy to meet people, but
hard to remember them," she says.
The hectic atmosphere is also a cause
for concern. "It's harder to find more chill,
calmer people," she says.
However, when asked whether she still
wishes she had been placed in a dorm with
upperclassman, Becker replies, "No, not
anymore. I like knowing that everyone else
around me is a freshman, too."
Trouble in Paradise?
Alas, despite everything in its favor,
Branner's good standing has been marred
by persistent allegations of "suckiness." A
perennial cheer heard at any event replete
with freshmen is "Branner Sucks!"
Residents seem unperturbed, however.
"We're like the Yankees," Phillips says.
"Everyone loves to hate us."
No matter how vicious the insults,

Branner residents find that their superior
facilities are an easy cushion to fall back
on.
"When we're sitting in our rooms and
we hear anti-Branner chants outside, we
just sit with our $20 million renovation
and shake our heads," Boyd says.
Still, the playful inter-dorm rivalry
typified by the phrase "Branner Sucks"
has led to some outcomes that really do
suck — such as vandalism. Recently, a
group of rowdy students from another
dorm tried to do away with one of Bran
ner's new couches.
"Dorm rivalries and the 'Branner
Sucks' mentality are fine when there's no
threat to anyone's safety or property dam
age," Shen says. "When it crosses those
lines, then it is something that we find
rather annoying."
For now, the residents of the new Bran
ner are basking in the joys of a multi-mil
lion-dollar renovation.
Says Shen, "It's a lot nicer."

don't have to pay $10 for every meal."
'Branimal House'
In past years, Branner has earned a rep
utation for being a noisy and chaotic hub of
social activity. With its 165 freshmen, the
new Branner is sure to carry on this tradi
tion. After all, it isn't called "Branimal
House" for no reason.
"Everyone is so excited to be here,"
Maqubela says. "On the weekends it's
pretty loud. There was a toga party last
weekend."
Still, the new policy prohibiting alcohol
from common areas in all-frosh dorms en
sures that this year's social scene will not
degenerate into a drunken bacchanal. For
some residents, that's just fine.
"I think it's a good rule," Phillips says.
"[The policy] is definitely going to tone
down large house gatherings. I personally
do not drink, so I don't have to worry about
people running around with beers in the
halls and being crazy."

Senior Kevin
Shen, one of
Branner's resi
dent advisers,
evaluates the
policy favor
ably.
"The drink
ing is less preva
lent than it was
three years
ago," he says.
"Kids are hav
ing fun, but we
are anxiously
awaiting more
alternative pro
gramming that
was promised
along with the
alcohol policy."
Since most of
the students in
the dorm ap
plied for all
frosh housing,
Branner is full
of students who
are content liv
ing there.
Nonetheless,
there are a few
freshmen resi
dents for whom
living in an all
frosh dorm was
not a top choice.
Freshman
Jessie Becker
applied for

four-class housing but was placed in Bran
ner instead. She was initially worried by
the large number of residents.
"It makes it easy to meet people, but
hard to remember them," she says.
The hectic atmosphere is also a cause
for concern. "It's harder to find more chill,
calmer people," she says.
However, when asked whether she still
wishes she had been placed in a dorm with
upperclassman, Becker replies, "No, not
anymore. I like knowing that everyone else
around me is a freshman, too."
Trouble in Paradise?
Alas, despite everything in its favor,
Branner's good standing has been marred
by persistent allegations of "suckiness." A
perennial cheer heard at any event replete
with freshmen is "Branner Sucks!"
Residents seem unperturbed, however.
"We're like the Yankees," Phillips says.
"Everyone loves to hate us."
No matter how vicious the insults,

Branner residents find that their superior
facilities are an easy cushion to fall back
on.
"When we're sitting in our rooms and
we hear anti-Branner chants outside, we
just sit with our $20 million renovation
and shake our heads," Boyd says.
Still, the playful inter-dorm rivalry
typified by the phrase "Branner Sucks"
has led to some outcomes that really do
suck — such as vandalism. Recently, a
group of rowdy students from another
dorm tried to do away with one of Bran
ner's new couches.
"Dorm rivalries and the 'Branner
Sucks' mentality are fine when there's no
threat to anyone's safety or property dam
age," Shen says. "When it crosses those
lines, then it is something that we find
rather annoying."
For now, the residents of the new Bran
ner are basking in the joys of a multi-mil
lion-dollar renovation.
Says Shen, "It's a lot nicer."

Branner residents have a lot to smile about now that the dormitory's $20 million renovation is complete. The new
Branner features potted plants, artwork on the walls, high ceilings, spacious balconies and marble bathroom stalls.
"Branner sucks!" From the
moment the chanting began
in crowded Memorial Audito
rium during New Student Ori
entation, it became unmistak
ably clear that Branner Hall,
the grand dame of frosh
dorms, was back in business.
After a nine-month, $20 mil
lion facelift, Branner has once
again opened its doors, to a
new crop of freshmen.

The new Branner has been labeled by
both residents and outsiders as a palace, a
resort and "a mansion of freshman orgy
ness." It has been open for just a short
while, but already, it is easy to see why.
Upon entering Branner, one is greeted
by potted plants, artwork on the walls, high
ceilings, spacious balconies and marble
bathroom stalls — all of which give the in
terior of the dorm an aesthetically pleasing
appearance. The lounge is upholstered, re
plete with wainscoted paneling, and a fire
place and expansive French windows look
out on an ample new courtyard.
"Before coming here, I didn't know the
history of Branner at all, but when I talked
to other people about Branner, they all
told me how lucky I was," says freshman
Shaun Phillips, a swimmer from Tennessee
living on the second floor. "It struck me as

being like a hotel."
Indeed, it is hard for some residents to
complain about their situation. When
asked to name the worst aspect of living at
Branner, Phillips looks puzzled. Turning to
his roommate, he asks, "Is there anything
really bad here? Oh yeah, the sinks. They
turn temperature all of a sudden."
Temperamental plumbing aside, the re
sponse to renovations has been over
whelmingly positive. According to fresh
man Heidi Boyd, another Branner resi
dent, "People who used to live here tell us
how nice it looks after the renovation.
They told us it had bats and asbestos be
fore, so that's an improvement."
Reviews of the food are also favorable:
"Amazing," says freshman Kanyi
Maqubela. "It's like Wilbur, except you

don't have to pay $10 for every meal."
