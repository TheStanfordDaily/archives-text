# The 						Stanford Daily Editorials
## Row should remain open to all 
### 
On Jan. 30, 2001, Stanford announced
that it would house the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity at 592 Mayfield and the
Sigma Nu fraternity at 557 Mayfield.
University officials made an admirable effort to
communicate with students before making this
final decision, and we commend them for ad
dressing many student concerns. As the process
of moving the fraternities onto the Row is now
complete, we recognize that there is value in

their Mayfield location.
But we are concerned that
the presence of the frater
nities has resulted in less
available Row housing —
and in particular, less of an
opportunity for women to
reside on the Row. We
hope that in the future,
when deciding whether to
house more fraternities on
the Row, the University
will realize there is a limit
ed number of Row houses
and this prime real estate
must be divided in a fair
and careful manner.
Before the University
decided offer Row houses
to Sigma Nu and Phi Psi,
they conducted extensive
research on the prefer
ences of the campus com

munity at large. A 2001 Row Task Force com
missioned by Jane Camarillo, director of Resi
dential Education, exhaustively sought to so
licit student input.
One specific method was an e-mail survey
sent to a random sample of Stanford students,
of which several hundred responded. In addi
tion, an open meeting was scheduled to discuss
available options and students were encour
aged to attend. We have always endorsed this
sort of open communication with students, and
we applaud the cautious and deliberate deci
sion-making process that the University en
gaged in before granting Row residency to the
fraternities.
At the end of the deliberation process, 557
and 592 Mayfield were selected because they

were determined to be less desirable for se
niors, who have only one last chance to live on
the Row. More than half of the students in
these houses live in one-room doubles or
triples. So instead of taking away prime hous
ing from non-Greeks, assigning the fraternities
to these two Row houses may potentially free
up singles in other upperclassman dorms.
We recognize that allowing fraternities to
live on the Row provides benefits for the en

tire student body, as
Greek houses generally
hold more events for the
community than non-
Greek houses. Joey
Greenwell, assistant di
rector of the office of stu
dent activities, explained
that Greek chapters with
central meeting spaces
are able to better coordi
nate their community ser
vice, philanthropy and so
cial events.
However, the poten
tial upside to the fraterni
ties' new housing does not
mitigate the fact that
fewer non-Greeks will be
able to live on the Row in
future years as a result of
this action. We must keep
in mind that no matter

what opportunities the fraternities enjoying
Row residency have to offer the campus, the
majority of students do not belong to such or
ganizations and are being shut out of housing
options that they otherwise may have had
open to them — the luck of the Draw permit
ting, of course.
In particular, women now have less of an
opportunity to secure housing on the Row. In
the future, Stanford must be certain not to ded
icate too much of the Row to fraternities, de
spite the many functions and services that they
could offer the student body. We believe that
all students have the right to a chance to live on
the Row, and we hope the University will tread
carefully when deciding whether or not to ded
icate any more houses to fraternities.
