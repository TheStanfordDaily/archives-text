• How to Breathe Underwater: Stories by Julie Orringer
Trapped in awkward, painful situations, the young protagonists of Orringer's debut collection discover
surprising reserves of wisdom in themselves. Their trials are familiar if harsh-the illness and death of parents
and friends, social ostracism-but Orringer's swift, intricate evocation of individual worlds gives depth and
integrity to her nine stories, set everywhere from Florence to New Orleans to Disney World. The collection's
tide comes from "The Isabel Fish," in which 14-year-old Maddy is learning how to scuba dive after
surviving a car accident in which her older brother's girlfriend drowned. Maddy is sure her brother hates
her, and when he kills the fish she is raising for a science fair project, she can hardly blame him. It is only
when they go diving together that she realizes he feels as guilty as she does. In "Note to Sixth-Grade Self
written in a telegraphic second person-the narrator details her torments at the hands of a popular girls who
speaks with a stutter. The cruelty of children is also dissected in "Stations of the Cross," in which Jewish Lila
Solomon attends her friend's first Communion in the Deep South, and finds herself reluctandy playing a
part in an enactment of the Crucifixion. In "When She Is Old and I Am Famous," fat Mira must cope with
the arrival of her supermodel cousin: "Aida. That is her terrible name. Ai-ee-duh: two cries of pain and one
of stupidity." By the end of the story, Aida has won over Mira, who finally empathizes with her bids for
attention. No matter how wronged they have been, Orringer's characters are open to reconciliation and even
willing to save their tormentors. It is this promise of grace-and Orringer's smooth, assured storytelling-that
distinguishes the collection.
• Bring Me Your Saddest Arizona (John Simmons
Short Fiction Award) by Ryan Harty
The stark landscapes of the desert Southwest form the backdrop for Harty's poignant and intelligent debut
collection. Two of the eight stories explore the complicated relationships between brothers: a young football
player feels the pull of opposing loyalties when his brother, home from the Marines, kills a rival's dog in
"What Can I Tell You About My Brother"; in "Crossroads," a Marine bound for Vietnam and his younger
brother go to a Led Zeppelin concert in a debauched outing that might be one of their last, best times. Harty
shows a keen interest in characters who are down on their luck, as in "Between Tubac and Tumacacori," in
which a heroin addict tempts his former partner to leave his girlfriend and begin dealing again, but suffers
a twinge of conscience. The longest story is also one of the most affectingly unusual: in "Don't Call It
Christmas," Will, a low-level writing instructor in San Francisco, embarks on a hesitantly tender affair with
a tough homeless girl while his mother lies comatose in an Arizona hospital; the girl's gutterpunk boyfriend
causes trouble, but when Will's mother wakes, happiness seems briefly possible. "Why the Sky Turns Red
When the Sun Goes Down" explores the emotional side of a technologically advanced future, as a couple
agonizes over their beloved robotic son, who has begun to experience mechanical breakdowns. No one
would call these stories uplifting, or optimistic, but they are all fully realized and elegantly told-and often
quietly surprising. Hardy excels at creating a three-dimensional desert suburbia populated by seeking,
reaching characters, for whom happiness is always just a bit out of reach.

The Red and the Blacklist: A Memoir of
a Hollywood Insider by Norma Barzman
Barzman arrived in Hollywood from Radcliffe in 1941, a good-looking 21-year-old who wanted to be a
writer or director, not an actress. She met Ben Barzman at a party for Hollywood "progressives"; before
long, they were in the Communist Party together. Ben stayed focused on his career of script writing. Norma,
especially after they married, made do with anything, mainly writing for Hearst's Examiner. By 1944, they
knew they were both under surveillance; by 1949, they realized they had to leave the country or face HUAC
(House Un-American Activities Committee) and jail for refusing to inform. They settled in Paris, their base
for nearly 20 years. Even though Ben subscribed to leftist ideals about equality, his wife's career made him
uncomfortable, so from 1955 on, Norma made babies, had affairs and researched movie ideas for Ben. From
her stories-dealing with the likes of Picasso, Sophia Loren, Peter Sellers, Anthony Quinn and Ingrid
Bergman-it seems the life of a Cold War expatriate was more attractive than anything America was offering.
Still, blacklisted men like Ben and his sometime collaborator Joseph Losey "hugged their bitterness," while
the women just adapted. Visiting the Soviet Union and watching the Communist betrayal of May 1968 in
France were profoundly disillusioning, but Norma found new hope stateside in the '70s amid women's
liberation and the push to restore the reputations of the blacklisted Hollywood artists. Her unique,
absorbing and richly detailed memoir is a contribution to both, restoring women to the history of this
period and documenting the bravery with which some people stood by their ideals.
