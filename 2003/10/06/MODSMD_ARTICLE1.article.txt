# Sally Ride urges young girls not to abandon sciences
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, approximately 750
middle-school-aged girls gathered on Lomita
Mall to catch a glimpse of their role model.
Decked out in sneakers and tightly pulled
ponytails, some girls looked as if they could
have been waiting for their favorite Stanford
athlete. Others, unable to suppress their bub
bly excitement, seemed to be waiting for a pop
star.
The girls, though, were all there to see then
favorite scientist.
About 950 people in all including the girls
and their parents attended the Sally Ride Sci
ence Festival yesterday, at which former astronaut
and Stanford alumna Sally Ride gave the keynote
address. Lasting from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the
festival aimed to encourage middle-school girls'
interests in math, science and technology.
The festival included a street fair with ex
hibits, food, music and discovery workshops
held by female scientists.
"The reason we focus on this age group is to
capture girls' enthusiasm [for science] out of el
ementary school, and show them that there are
women who have successful careers in every
thing from veterinary sciences to astrophysics,"
Ride said.
The Sally Ride Science Club and the
Hewlett-Packard Corporation presented the
festival, and female professionals in fields rang
ing from veterinary medicine to aviation host
ed the workshops.
Ride said there is a need to encourage mid
dle-school girls in the sciences because "In ele
mentary school there are as many girls as there
are boys who are interested in science. They've
got the aptitude and they've got the interest,
but a significantly higher percentage of girls
start to drift away from science once they reach
middle school."
Ride pointed to peer pressure as crucial in
girls' development of disinterest in science.
"It's not because they're not interested, or
have gotten dumber," Ride said. "The reasons
tend to be societal. Middle school is a time when
kids tend to do what their friends want them to
do. They pick up these signals and think, 'Maybe
if I do this instead, I'll fit in more.' "
According to the National Center for Edu
cation Statistics, the number of girls and boys
who like math and science is about the same in
fourth grade, but by eighth grade, twice as
many boys as girls show an interest in these
subjects.
Many of Ride's endeavors including
Imaginary Lines, Inc., the educational compa
ny she co-founded aim to keep girls interest
ed in the sciences.
Ride explained how she herself became in
terested in science.
"I was just fascinated by the way the world
worked," she said. "I was honestly interested
in the things you can learn with science, like
why the sky is blue. That's physics. It was real
ly an interest that came from inside me, a nat
ural curiosity."
According to the 2000 Report of the Con
gressional Commission on the Advancement of
Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering
and Technology Development, women make
up only 19 percent of the science, engineering
and technology workforce.
"The more different approaches you have to
a problem, the more diverse of a group you can
have thinking about it, the more likely you are
to solve the problem," Ride said of the need for
more women scientists.
"The most important thing a parent or
teacher can do is to give [their daughters] en
couragement and build up their confidence,"
Ride said. "Let them know that there are a lot
of other girls who share their interests."
