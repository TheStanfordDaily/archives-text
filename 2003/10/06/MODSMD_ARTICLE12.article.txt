## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK Magic is lost in Blaine's bland stunt 
### 
London's Tower Hill tube
stop is busier than usual this
brisk (that's British for
freezing cold) Sunday
morning. Today is day 30 of David
Blaine's 44-day stunt at Tower
Bridge, and by 10 a.m. a healthy
crowd has gathered to watch the ma
gician starve himself in a glass box.
The newly-erected fence, put up
last week to prevent mischievous
Britons from hurling eggs, raw meat
and beer cans at the seven by three
foot cage, doesn't deter a few
teenagers from yelling obscenities at
Blaine. When I ask a heckler why he
bothers, he shrugs and says, "Be
cause he's an idiot in a box, innit he?"
Ah, yes, but he's an idiot in a box
dangling in midair. Even 30-feet
above the ground, Blaine is very ac
cessible to the crowd, most of whom
are supportive or just curious. At
best, the whole spectacle resembles
weird performance art straight out
of the pages of Franz Kafka's short
story, "A Hunger Artist," Blaine's
inspiration for the stunt. In typical,
cheery Kafkaesque fashion, the
hunger artist starves to death in the
end, alone and forgotten Blaine
probably has a different finale in
mind.
Maybe he's trying to make a
statement about the irony of alien
ation in a public space. Maybe he's

doing it for the re
ported $8 million
Sky One Network
is paying him for
the exclusive rights
to in-box footage.
All I know for cer
tain is that this is
the crappiest magic
trick I've ever
seen.

It's not as
though David Blaine is the first to go
hungry for so long. There was this
other famous guy before him ...
what was his name? Oh yeah,
GANDHI. He was sort of a magician
too: His best trick was when, presto
change-o, he freed a nation from
colonial rule! So Blaine's bout of
anorexia isn't even novel, let alone
magical.
But apparently, the face of magic
as we know it is changing. Young
magicians are eschewing the flashy
showmanship that made Siegfried
and Roy and David Copperfield
household names in favor of un
scripted street acts. Looking at
David Blaine, unshaven and scruffy
in his grimy Perspex box, makes me
miss those fancy Vegas performers.
Blaine looks terribly unimpressive.
Call me old-fashioned, but I like my
magicians gay and orange.
I understand Blaine's desire to

make his magic as un-staged as pos
sible, but this stunt is too actual and
too obstructive for my taste. Besides,
everyone knows that those famous
magicians' acts are grand illusions,
but the wonder, the how did he do
that? that's real. And that's what
I miss. Hokey as they are, traditional
big-name magicians are supremely
talented at reminding you that there
are still things in this world you sim
ply cannot explain.
Any sense of mystery is becoming
dangerously passe in our need-to
know culture, and Blaine's stunt is
about as transparent as it gets
from the glass walls to the water line
and urine tube hanging from it. (I
have to say, nothing kills the mystery
quite like a urine tube.) By 10:25
a.m., I've seen enough.
As I elbow my way out of the
crowd, I think about the bizarreness
of it all. In Kafka's story, the hunger
artist whispers just before dying, "I
always wanted you to admire my
fasting ... But you shouldn't admire
it." What a creepy, David Blaine
like thing to say. I don't want a mod
ern day hunger artist; I just want to
know where all the magic has gone.
