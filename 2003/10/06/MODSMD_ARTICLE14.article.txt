Program addresses
cat overpopulation
In response to Friday's letter to
The Daily regarding the diminishing
numbers of quail on campus ("Rain
ing cats, not birds," Oct. 3), we be
lieve the writer is not alone in his dis
may. Those of us who have worked
at Stanford over the past 40 years
have seen continuous building all
across the University. Whereas
quail, raccoons and other wildlife
flourished in abundance, open fields
have been replaced now with mas
sive buildings, parking structures
and acres of paved parking. This sce
nario has been repeated again and
again campus-wide. The expansion
deemed necessary to the Universi
ty's growth has devastated the
wildlife habitat.
The Stanford Cat Network orga
nized in 1989 to address the welfare
of the homeless cat population on
campus. Contrary to common belief,
many stray cats are opportunistic
and ineffectual hunters, eventually
starving to death without human in
tervention to sustain life. Most of the
cats on campus arrived as pets of stu
dents who did not understand the
concept of lifetime commitment to
their care or the importance of neu
tering. They were lost or abandoned
on campus and, if they survived, pro
duced litters of feral kittens.
The Network operates under an
agreement with the University to
manage the homeless cat population
on campus with an aggressive pro
gram to ensure all cats are spayed or
neutered, vaccinated and fed daily at
designated feeding stations. Care
givers both monitor the welfare of
those un-socialized cats returned to
live on campus and watch for the lost
or abandoned newcomers. Some 50

tamable cats and kittens are re
moved from campus each year and
placed in permanent homes through
our "no-kill" adoption program.
In 1989, there were an estimated
500 homeless cats on campus. In
2003 the population is under 100. Al
though our efforts have been suc
cessful in stabilizing and caring for
the campus cat population, they are
necessarily ongoing. We continue
diligently to identify and rescue new
cats abandoned on campus by stu
dents and others, and we provide hu
mane education to avert this ongo
ing human problem.

Prop. 54 misrepresented by
opponents
Nneka Chike-Obi's letter to the
editor condemning Proposition 54
was one of the most inane and laugh
able arguments I have read to date
("Community members speak out
on Prop. 54," Oct. 3). She urges com
munity members to vote against
Prop. 54 because our ability to sue
Macy's may be in danger when em
ployees look at us in an odd way. You
know things are bad in the world
when we can't sue a store because an
employee looked at us wrong.
The actual point Chike-Obi was
making was that, due to restrictions
on government collections of racial
data, we would somehow be pre
vented from tracking racial profil
ing abuses. Inasmuch as Prop. 54 is
a restriction placed on government
and Macy's is not a government-run
business, the proposition does not

affect the store's or other private
business' ability to collect racial
data.
If arguments such as Chike-Obi's
against Prop. 54 are indicative of how
most students at Stanford think, then
we know anti-Prop. 54 organizations
have not only succeeded in making a
generally intelligent community
more ignorant about the issue, but
also have succeeded in a wide disin
formation campaign that, sadly, will
most likely spread and bring down
the proposition on Tuesday.
The doomsday scenario anti-
Prop. 54 organizations have por
trayed is merely a scare tactic used
to frighten minorities into thinking
they will be the subject of greater
and more malicious hate crimes.
The lies have overshadowed the
truth that the proposition specifical
ly provides exemptions for law en
forcement officials, medical re
search and the Department of Fair
Housing and Employment, which
collects data and enforces laws
aimed at ensuring equal treatment
for minorities.
Furthermore, the proposition
legally cannot overrule federal man
dates that require portions of the
state government to collect racial
data to ensure compliance with
equal opportunity laws and educa
tion reform programs.
If Californians want to finally
eliminate the institutionalized
racism of the state government while
protecting medical research, equal
opportunity in the workplace and
law enforcement's ability to fight
hate crimes, they must vote "yes" on
Prop. 54. And don't worry, you'll
still be able to sue Macy's.
