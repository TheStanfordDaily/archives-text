## Playoff series proves crazy and dramatic 
### 
Ah, playoff baseball. I should admit, right
off the start, that the editors of this vol
ume told me that my columns were sup
posed to be specifically about college
sports in-depth studies of the Pacific 10 Con
ference race to the Rose Bowl; my problems with
the BCS; the east coast bias in the bracket of 64 in
March; the drama of Omaha ... whatever.

After the baseball that I saw in Oakland and on
television this past week, playoff baseball is all
that I can write about.

Let's start from the beginning Game 1 last
Wednesday night in Oakland, at the Net. A dream
of a match-up as Pedro Martinez, the league lead
er in E.R.A., faced off against Tim Hudson the
league runner up.
If you were looking for beer-league softball
scores and big innings, your chances weren't too
good.

The Red Sox went up early on Todd Walker's
first-inning home run, but couldn't muster much

more offense against the bald
Oakland starter. The home
town team put up a three spot in
the third and for awhile it
looked like that might be
enough for Hudson.
Then in the fifth the Red Sox
sprang back to life with a solo
shot by catcher Jason Varitek.
Hudson was able to pitch out of a
jam and kill the rally with solid

pitching and the first of what
would be many stellar defensive plays by Eric
Chavez.

The rally finally came not against Hudson, but
against Ricardo Rincon as Walker went deep for
the second time that night with a two-run shot in
the seventh inning.
Now with most teams, this might be the game
up by one run, going into the ninth inning. But
the Red Sox bullpen imploded right on schedule,
giving up the tying run in the bottom of the ninth.
The drama finally ended just before midnight
on the A's Ramon Hernandez's now well-docu
mented bases-loaded bunt in the bottom of the
12th.
Game 2 was an ugly affair on both sides, per
haps the result of a day game so close on the heels
of what ESPN's Jim Caple referred to as "the most
emotionally draining baseball I have seen."
So the teams flew across the country to Boston
with plenty to think about (or not think about) in
both clubhouses.
Oakland was trying not to think about how
they had gone up 2-0 against both the Twins and
Yankees and lost those series. About how they
had lost their last six games when a win would
have sent them into the next round of the playoffs.
About how they haven't won a postseason series
since 1990.
In Boston, however, the streaks run a little bit
longer like back to 1918, the last time Boston
won the last game of the season.
Baseball, after all, is a game of streaks. Of luck,
superstition, chance, fate, whatever you want to
call it.
How else to explain the fact that most of the
Red Sox team gave themselves buzz cuts before
Game 3 in an attempt to change their fortune?
How else to explain the absurdity of that game,
which for the first four innings included more er
rors than hits? Which included a play where Eric
Byrnes managed to miss home plate but had time
to shove Jason Varitek? In which Miguel Tejada
managed to be involved in two interference
calls?
Strange days, my friends, strange days.
Strange enough for the series to stretch into
extra innings for the second time in three games,
only to be ended by Trot Nixon's Kirk Gibson
esque walk off homerun (Nixon strained his calf
two weeks ago), to continue the series and the
season.
Nixon, it should be noted, got his buzz cut in the
dugout, immediately before entering the game as
a pinch hitter. Freaky.
And when things couldn't get any more dra
matic, Game 4 appeared.
The A's jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the second
inning only to have it erased by ex-Athletic John
ny Damon's two-run moon shot in the third.
But it couldn't be that easy the A's came
back on the newly rejuvenated bat of Jermaine
Dye who launched a shot over the Green Monster
for a 4-2 lead.
It looked bleak for the hometown team. But
after another Todd Walker home run the team
and the crowd came back to life.
The bottom of the eighth found Nomar on third
and Ramirez on first.
Keith Foulke, Oakland's best closer, was on the
mound. David Ortiz, one of Boston's best batters,
was at the plate.
Only ons problem Ortiz was hitless for the
series. Sixteen trips to the plate, and no hits. Bat
ting .000. However you want to say it. He was a
nonfactor, an automatic out, a dead spot, a pitch
er's dream.
Until yesterday, when he dropped the collar
and let go with a base-clearing double to win the
game.
"This is the time of the year when heroes are
made," said Kevin Millar after the game.
Fact. All is forgiven, David. If only redemption
could be that easy for us all.
Game 5, tonight at 5 p.m. Pedro vs. Zito for all
the marbles. Wouldn't have it any other way.
Matt Babin hopes his children don't become Red Sox
fans so they can escape the emotional destruction that
comes along with it. Email him at babin@stanford.ediL
