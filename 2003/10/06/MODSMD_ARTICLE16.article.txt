# Bears maim Cardinal
## Cal soccer scores three straight goals to defeat Stanford at Berkeley 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Early in last night's game against California (5-4-1),
the Cardinal men's soccer team looked as though it
might be able to top the Golden Bears, a feat that last
season's College Cup squad was unable to perform.
Junior forward Darren Fernandez took advantage
of the situation when Cal goalkeeper Mike Osguera
got thrown off balance. Fernandez scored on a wide
open net after a high free kick by junior James Twell
man led Osguera to lose his footing. As he hit the
ground, Stanford sophomore Chad Marshall found
Fernandez for an easy score in the eighth minute of
the game.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal (2-6-2), the goal only
helped Stanford avoid a shutout, as the team dropped
the game to the Golden Bears, 3-1.
"Scoring first, sets us up in good position; it pumps
us up," said freshman goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen.
"But lately when we score first we end up making mis
takes that cost us the game."
According to Stanford head coach Bret Simon, Cal
showed no mercy in capitalizing on his team's errors.
After the Cardinal defense misplayed a ball, Cal
junior Mike Munoz was able to power through and
blast a left-footed shot underneath the reach of a div
ing Kartunen.
The goal was a key contributor to a revival of ener
gy for the California team, which was playing in front of
its largest crowd of the season.
"When they scored that first goal, the momentum
[of the game] really shifted," Kartunen said.
Bears' star forward, junior Carl Acosta, found the
net on a pass from freshman teammate Andrew Ja
cobson in the 34th minute. The goal marked the sev
enth time that Acosta has scored in the last nine
games.
The Cardinal managed only one other shot on goal
in the face-off, but the attempt from freshman mid
fielder Marcus Ryan was thwarted by Osguera.
At halftime, the matchup was at 2-1, and a win was
still within the grasp of the Stanford squad. But Cal had
other plans for the final score.
Propelled by the fast-paced style that typifies the
Bears offense, California drove past the Cardinal de
fenders one final time in the 55th minute on a goal from
junior Kyle Navarro.
