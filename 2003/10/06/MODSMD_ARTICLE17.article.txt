# Men fall to Cal after sudden death overtime in NorCal championship
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a game that may foreshadow this season's
NCAA final, the No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team fell to rival No. 4 California 10-9 in a sudden
death battle for the Northern California Tourna
ment championship last night at the Avery Aquatic
Complex.

In a thrilling tournament packed with several close
games, many expected the Cardinal to be facing No. 1
Southern California in a repeat of the Southern Cali
fornia Tournament two weeks ago.
But Cal fought its way back from a 6-1 deficit in the
third period to tie its semifinal game against USC with
nine seconds left in regulation. Cal went on to score
twice in overtime for an 8-6 win over the previously
unbeaten Trojans a team that had defeated the
Bears just last week.
"There were a lot of close games," said senior
utility Mike Derse. "It was a really exciting tourna
ment. Everyone played their hearts out. There were
four, maybe more, overtime games. That shows that
the level of water polo being played is greatly in

creasing over the last tournament and as the season
goes on."
Junior driver Tony Azevedo agreed that the high
level of play this season made for a good tournament.
"There are so many teams of number one quality,"
he said. "For the top teams there were one goal differ
ences in all the games, so for us to get away from
UCLA and Pepperdine and come here against Cal is
the best thing that could happen. Obviously we want
ed the win, but this is going to make us improve more
than any other team out there."
According to Derse, the championship game
match-up was not a given since so many teams per
formed well throughout the tour
nament.
"I wouldn't say there were nec
essarily upsets," he said. "The top
five teams are all really tough.
They all have their days. Unfortu
nately, today wasn't ours."
The Cardinal and the Golden
Bears jockeyed for position on
Sunday evening, with six ties by
the end of the fourth period (8-8)
and a seventh to bring the game
into sudden-death overtime.
Azevedo tied the game at 8-8 on
a penalty shot with three seconds
left in regulation.
After a slow start, both teams
began to pick up the pace. The
Bears kept up a strong defense
with six saves by Cal goalie Tim
Kates in the first period. Sopho
more driver Thomas Hopkins
scored twice for Stanford but Cal
tied it 2-2 with 1:28 left in the peri
od. The Bears continued their
strong defensive effort and the
teams entered the half with a Cal
lead of 5-3.
"I thought we came out a little
slow," said Derse. "I don't like

being down by three goals."
Junior two-meter Greg Crum
tied the game 5-5 with a wrap
around on an assist by Azevedo
with 2:38 left in the third period.
After another Cal score, Derse
tied the game again on a power
play.
Azevedo tied the game twice
in the fourth period, including a
spectacular shot from eight me
ters out with three seconds left
in regulation.
He tied it again with 1:45 left
in the second overtime, leading
the Cardinal with four goals for
the game. But the Cardinal was
not able to gain the upper hand
and lost to a goal by Cal's Milos
Ribic 1:09 into sudden-death
overtime.
"I think we showed a lot of
character right there at the end. In
overtime, I thought we had them.
We had some good chances but a
couple things didn't go our way
and Cal ended up with the victo
ry," Derse said.
The loss has taught the Cardinal
a lesson for games further down
the road, according to Azevedo.
"This tournament's gotten us
ready so that if we go into over
time, we're not going to lose in
sudden-death. This is great.

We're learning how to play sud
den death, how to play tired. No
matter how many sudden-deaths,
we're going to be the ones that
are accustomed to it," Azevedo
said.
The Cardinal won handily in its
first game Saturday morning
against unranked Santa Clara.
Stanford scored the game's first 12
goals and went on to a 16-2 victory.
Azevedo and Hopkins led the
team in scoring with three goals
apiece.
Sophomore Peter Varellas led
scoring in the Cardinal's second
game against No. 7 UCLA. His
three goals contributed to a 7-4 vic
tory over the Bruins. After a 1-1 tie
in the first period, Stanford pulled
ahead to a 4-2 lead at the half.
UCLA brought it to within
one goal (5-4) in the third period,
but goals by Varellas and Hop
kins in the forth gave Stanford a
secure win.
Stanford faced a tougher oppo
nent in No. 3 Pepperdine. Pepper
dine had an 8-3 lead entering the
final period of Sunday morning's
semifinal, but the Cardinal sprang
into action, scoring four straight
goals to bring the score to 8-7 with
3:04 left in play. The Waves' Mike
Hausmann scored with 2:08 remain

ing to bring the lead to 9-7, but
Azevedo pulled the Cardinal back
within one goal. Crum tied the game
at 9-9 with 36 seconds left, and Gar
ton scored the game-winning goal
with a mere second to play.

Pepperdine went on to beat
Southern California 9-7 in over
time in the consolation game.
With so many shake-ups among
the top five teams in the NorCal
tournament, the rankings for

next week are anything but pre
dictable.
The Cardinal will travel south
to Los Angeles for another
match against No. 1 USC at 4
p.m. on Saturday.
