# Women spike U of A and ASU
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Flash back to Oct. 12 last year: The
Stanford women's volleyball team is
leading Arizona two games to zero in
front of nearly 10,000 fans in Tucson
before the Sun Devils rally in game
three and take the match from the
Cardinal in five.
The memory of that match and
the momentum from its decisive win
over Arizona State the night before
should have been enough to spark
the Cardinal as it entered the
McKale Center Friday for the first
time since last season.
Up against a talented Arizona
team that came out fighting, the Car
dinal (12-2,6-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
faltered in game one, losing 23-30. In
the game, Stanford had only nine kills,
six hitting errors and a .107 hitting per
centage, while the Sun Devils had 19
kills and a .364 hitting percentage.
"We knew what happened to our
team last year in Arizona and it's a
very tough place to play," said Stan
ford's leading hitter junior Ogonna
Nnamani. "We knew what we were up
against entering the match and unfor
tunately in the first game we couldn't
get our rhythm quite right and we
seemed to be a step behind. But you

have to give them a lot of credit in
Game 1. They had a great game plan
and did a great job executing it."
The momentum of the match, how
ever, took a turn in the Cardinal direc
tion at the start of Game 2, as Stanford
regrouped and took the next three
games, extending its winning streak to
six matches and getting a bit of re
venge on the Sun Devils.
"We didn't come out as ready as
they did, but in game two we
changed our intensity," Nnamani
said. "Even though we felt intense
before Game 1, you can't really get a
feel for how the match vCill go until
you start playing and we were able
to step it up a notch. We started to
play together more and focused on
our game plan."
After hitting a dismal .107 in Game
1 with only nine kills, Stanford hit .375
in Game 2, .484 in Game 3 and .469 in
Game 4 and had as many hitting errors
in the last three games as it had in the
first alone. Arizona, on the other
hand, saw its offense go dead in games
two and three, hitting well under .100
in both games, with only 10 kills in
each.
While Arizona out hit Stanford 60-54
in the match, it was Stanford's net play,
which propelled the Cardinal to victory.
Led by senior middle blocker Jennifer

Harvey, who has a team high 1.80 blocks
per game, Stanford out-blocked Ari
zona 11-3, including five by Harvey.
Furthermore, despite the fact
that the Sun Devils had six more kills
than the Cardinal, Stanford hit with
greater accuracy and consistency.
The Sun Devils had 34 hitting errors
and a .191 hitting percentage in the
match, while the Cardinal only had
12 hitting errors six of which
came in game one and an overall
.364 hitting percentage.
Both Nnamani and Arizona's lead
ing hitter, Kim Glass, ended the match
with 19 kills on the night. However, in
her 40 swings, Glass had nine errors
and a .250 hitting percentage while
Nnamani had no errors and hit an im
pressive .576.
Stanford again played the match
without its full starting lineup, as se
nior setter Anna Robinson remained
sidelined with a wrist injury. Sopho
more Katie Goldhahn, who had been
splitting time with Robinson before
her injury, again stepped up, setting
the entire match and ending the night
with 42 assists and led the Cardinal de
fense with 13 digs.
Stanford will get a break from
conference play and will face Pacific
University on Tuesday at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m.
