# PHEs to receive stipends this year
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Peer health educators, traditionally volun
teers, received a nice surprise this year when
Residential Education decided to institute
stipends for the staff for the first time.
PHEs will now receive $BOO for the 2003-
04 academic year. The amount is still quite
nominal, though, in comparison to the money
given to staff like RAs.
"I'm really happy [about the stipend] even
though it's only 1 / 10th of what RAs are
being paid," said Kara Guzman, a junior
PHE in Soto. "I think Res Ed realized that
PHEs are doing just as much as other staff
like HPACs and RCCs. At least here in Soto,
where there are six staff members, we all
share the responsibility."
Vaden's Health Promotion Services is re
sponsible for hiring and training PHEs.
Under the guidance of Co-Directors Carol
Pertosky and Kate Bedford, HPS conducts
interviewing and training for the staff.
Peer health educators must complete a four
unit course during spring quarter, consisting of
two hours of class, two days a week. Given this
time commitment, it is not very surprising that
the role of peer health educator exceeds pro
viding contraceptives and cough syrup.
"PHEs are definitely not just condom
providers, in spite of that old stereotype,"
said sophomore Shari Ilsen. "When I had a

problem with my knee, my PHE not only had
the resources to take care of the problem, but
he also was very attentive to make sure that I
visited Vaden in case it got worse."
Becoming a PHE is a three-part process.
First, the prospective candidates complete a
written application of three to four open
ended questions. From there, the field is nar
rowed down to an informal interview in front
of former PHEs, with Bedford presiding. Fi
nally, the applicants sit down for a one-on
one interview with the HPS directors.
After Pertosky and Bedford make their
decisions, dorms' Resident Fellows are noti
fied of potential PHEs for their staff.
The 70 to 80 people that applied last year
were unaware of the change while they were
going through their training.
"It took a great deal of advocacy from last
year's PHEs in order to attain the stipend. We
couldn't have done it without them," said ju
nior Felix Su, a PHE
in Toy on. "Carol [Pertosky] has been talking
about getting a stipend for years and years,
and thanks to her and last year's PHEs, Res
Ed is finally making it happen."
With the payment of PHEs, Res Ed is ac
knowledging the demands of this residential
staff role.
"The PHE program is great," Su said.
"And it's nice that Res Ed recognizes our role
and is giving us the stipend as a token of ap
preciation."
