# 'Black Plaza' back
## Students celebrate highest black presence 
### STUTI GOSWAMY 
No one passed through White Plaza Friday after
noon.
However, hundreds did stop to explore the energy
and presence of "Black Plaza," the third annual activi
ties fair for Stanford's African American community.
Organized by the NAACP, BSU, BGSA, and BCSE,
the outdoors activities fair showcased tables set up by
academic organizations, sororities, fraternities, reli
gious groups and dance companies.
This year's theme promoted "Black to our Past,
Black to our Future." When Stanford opened in 1891,
there was one black student. Today, there are several

hundred black undergraduate students, including 203
freshmen.
According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Edu
cation (JBHE), Stanford has the largest percentage of
blacks in a freshman class among the nation's 30 top
ranked schools at 12.3 percent. More significantly, the
Journal said, the number of black freshmen at Stan
ford has increased by 62 percent since 2000. Stanford
boasts one of the highest black student yields
meaning 68 percent of admitted black students decid
ed to enroll.

of all the top U.S. universities.
diversity of Stanford and the pres

ple of the main reasons they chose
Stanford over other top schools.
When asked about the impor
tance of diversity on campus, Okoli
said, "Attending Stanford to me is
just another move to a new home in
which I will talk, laugh and learn
with people from all walks of life,

from all over the world."
Black Plaza began in 2000, when
Lawrence Neely decided the cam
pus needed a stronger black com
munity. The mechanical engineer
ing graduate student said, "Stanford
on the whole is so decentralized.
You may see someone once and not
see them ever again."

To solve this problem, he created
Black Plaza, an open forum aimed
at helping black students orient
themselves during the first weeks of
school. New students can discover
the opportunities available to them,
and returning students can socialize
with old friends.

On Friday, the students crowd
ed the center of campus to enjoy
Popeye's Chicken and listen to hip
hop, rap, and reggae music. Each
student received a black T-shirt
with "Stanford" emblazoned on
the front and all of the African
American campus organizations
listed on the back.

Jan Barker Alexander, associ
ate dean of students and director
of the BCSE, greeted the students,
encouraging them to forge a one
on-one connection with fellow stu
dents and faculty. Students
learned about the Martin Luther
King Papers Project from current

researchers and the NAACP
stance on Proposition 54 (the
NAACP opposes it) from sopho
mores Carmin Powell and Ashlea
Graves.
Further activities and entertain
ment are planned for the future.
"Funky Fridays" has been set up as
a gathering of African American
students on the first Friday of every
month to discuss pertinent issues
and socialize.

The goals of Black Plaza remain
numerous, but for Friday, the em
phasis was on fostering a sense of
community. As Powell and Graves
clearly stated, "We are here."
