# 'Black Plaza' back
## Students celebrate highest black presence 
### STUTI GOSWAMY 
No one passed through White Plaza Friday after
noon.
However, hundreds did stop to explore the energy
and presence of "Black Plaza," the third annual activi
ties fair for Stanford's African American community.
Organized by the NAACP, BSU, BGSA, and BCSE,
the outdoors activities fair showcased tables set up by
academic organizations, sororities, fraternities, reli
gious groups and dance companies.
This year's theme promoted "Black to our Past,
Black to our Future." When Stanford opened in 1891,
there was one black student. Today, there are several

hundred black undergraduate students, including 203
freshmen.
According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Edu
cation (JBHE), Stanford has the largest percentage of
blacks in a freshman class among the nation's 30 top
ranked schools at 12.3 percent. More significantly, the
Journal said, the number of black freshmen at Stan
ford has increased by 62 percent since 2000. Stanford
boasts one of the highest black student yields
meaning 68 percent of admitted black students decid
ed to enroll.
