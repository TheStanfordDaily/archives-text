# Bazaar auction Web site is on-line again
## 
### NANCY WANG 
Bazaar, Stanford's own version of eßay, is once
again up and running.
The service was discontinued over the summer and
is currently undergoing re-organization at the manage
ment level. Unbeknownst to most University students,
Bazaar is now available, but attention has been divert
ed from publicity for the service to solidifying its be
hind-the-scenes operation.
The service (http://bazaar.stanford.edu) is part of
Stanford Student Enterprises and was launched last fall
as an online auction service through which students
might sell or purchase anything from textbooks to bicy
cles to housing.
Senior Elizabeth Yin, Bazaar's founder and this
quarter's manager, spawned the idea her freshman year
and recalls that "there were almost 2,000 posts within
the first three months of operation."
The Web site offers an easy-to-navigate format and

boasts many posts since the beginning of this school
year, but is not free like eßay or many other auction ser
vices.
When asked to comment on the service, however,
many students gave puzzled looks or said that they had
never used it.
"I've never heard of it before," said freshman Celen
Zepeda.
After learning more about the service, however,
Zepeda added, "I think it's a great idea. It's a good way
for someone to find out what's selling at other dorms."
Bazaar has seen a recent decline in usage. In several
categories offered on the site, such as electronics, the
most recent listing are from April.
Veteran Stanford students, such as senior Andrew
Park, said that they had heard of the service as an up
grade of su.market, an older online marketplace also
aimed at an easy exchange of products within the Stan
ford community.
Park said, though, that "I've never used [Bazaar]. If

everyone else were using it, it might be worth it."
Freshman Amy Wu agreed.
"It seems a convenient way for students to buy inex
pensive products from one another," she said.
Junior Satoko Kakihara remembers seeing flyers
and e-mails last year, but also admitted that she has
never taken the initiative to use the service.
"To me, it's a big mystery," she said. "I just
see posters with pictures of lamps on them.
Maybe if they laid out why this was better than
other methods of buying, more people would use
the service."
When asked about the status of Bazaar, Yin said that
"We hope to be up and running and publicizing again
soon. I'm very hopeful that this will be the case, but we
need to tackle some organizational aspects of Bazaar
first.
"Ultimately, many people feel that Bazaar would be
much better if it were a free service to the student body,
and this is the goal we're working towards," she said.
