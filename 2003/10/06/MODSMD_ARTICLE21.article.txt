# Cantor unveils student program
## 
### PRIYANKA PATHAKNARAIN 
A group of 15 students circled
the illuminated 'Walking Man'
sculpture at the Cantor Arts Cen
ter last Thursday night, running
their hands over its form and talk
ing about their reactions to it.
This may not be how most
Stanford students spend their
nights, but similar scenes were
common throughout the night, as
about 40 students gathered at
this year's inaugural "First
Thursdays at the Cantor Arts
Center" program.
The program was designed in
response to the perceived need for
greater connection between the
on-campus museum and the Stan
ford student body.
The program hosts student
events at Cantor the first Thursday
of every month during the academ
ic calendar, excluding the month of
January.
Senior Margaret Reynolds
headed the "discussion-based
tour" that was the keynote event of
the evening.
The theme was an exploration
of people's reactions to the various
ways Cantor's art pieces are pre
sented. Participants were encour
aged to share their feelings.
"Its main goals are two-fold,"
Reynolds said. "To bring students

to the museum, thereby allowing
students to forge an ongoing rela
tionship with the museum's collec
tions and resources, and to engage
students in artwork in order to ex
plore how art can be used to foster
dialogue about multi-disciplinary
topics."
Overall, Reynolds felt, the inau
gural program was a success.
"I am amazed at the number of
people who showed up," she said.
Vivian Wang and Aisha Ali
were the other two guides who led
groups.
"We didn't expect such a re
sponse," Wang said as the tour
started out.
The brief tour of four art pieces
consisted primarily of Reynolds
sharing how she personally reacted
to the art.
After the tour, the group head
ed out to the courtyard for refresh
ments and music provided by the
band The David Baron Element.
Student reactions to the night
were largely positive.
Chadie Severin, a freshman
who was visiting the museum for
the first time, found it to be an
"amazing place."
"I would love to come back and
see this place at leisure," she said.
Students also liked the feelings
based approach.
"I enjoyed myself," said Cabr
era Kristy, a graduate student in

Education. "Though I don't know
much about art, I found it an inter
esting experience to try and relate
to a piece. It's a different idea."
Sophomore Tiffany Tanaka
agreed.
"I really liked the place," she
said. "It was an interesting way of
looking at museum pieces, one that
I haven't tried before."
Reactions, however, were not
unanimous.
"The tour was okay, [but] I felt
we didn't spend enough time on
each piece," Severin said. "We
were sort of rushing through the
entire thing."
Other students were more am
bivalent.
"I was expecting the traditional
information-about-the piece kind
of tour, not really about how we
feel about the placement of a
piece," freshman Jasmine Chiu
said. "It was, well, a bit different."
Reynolds defended the theme.
"To me, I think mostly I felt that
interacting with art is a fundamen
tal question, because it gets to the
root of 'What is art itself?' "
Reynolds said. "Definition of art is
how the viewer interacts with the
piece, it is a theme we are experi
menting with. It's not even the only
theme possible, but we decided to
try this one first."
The next "First Thursday at the
Center" will be held Nov. 6.
