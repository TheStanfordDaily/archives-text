# Robertsons want donation back
## 
### BRIAN KLADKO THE RECORD 
(KRT) Times have changed
since 1961, when Charles and Marie
Robertson, heirs to the A&P grocery
store fortune, donated $35 million in
company stock to Princeton University.
A dashing young John F.
Kennedy was in the White House. It
was the era of Camelot and the
Peace Corps, when many an Ivy Lea
guer actually dreamed of becoming a
government bureaucrat.
So the Robertsons targeted their
gift to the graduate program of the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public
and International Affairs, one of the
nation's premier centers for the
study of politics and policy. Their
largesse, everyone agrees, made the

school what it is today.
Now, the Robertsons more
precisely, Charles and Marie
Robertson's heirs want their
money back. All $5OO million of it.
Their complaint: The Wilson School
has not fulfilled the couple's vision of a
school that trains graduate students to
work in the federal government, partic
ularly in international affairs.
More Wilson alumni work in busi
ness and finance, they say, than in the
U.S. government, even though the
Robertson endowment pays almost
every graduate student's tuition.
"My parents' purpose was to try
to help train the very, very finest in
dividuals to serve the federal govern
ment, to promote peace, to promote
democracy, to defend peace, and to
defend democracy around the

world," said William Robertson,
who, along with his two sisters and a
cousin, is suing the university.
If they prevail in court, the heirs say
they have no intention of keeping the
money for themselves; instead, they will
bestow it on another school that agrees to
follow the family's wishes.
The Robertsons' emphasis on fed
eral employment as the epitome of
public service was rooted in the ethos
of the early Sixties.
What changed? The university, in
its legal papers, cites the Vietnam War,
Watergate, and the resulting "negative
public image of government" â€”an
image that made federal employment
considerably less appealing.
In addition, the university says,
Uncle Sam isn't hiring like he used to,
leading many civic-minded folks to
seek work at private think tanks and
non-profit organizations. Such groups,
says Ana Echevarria, a second-year
Wilson student, are "key to the way
government functions."
The Robertson heirs, using infor
mation from the Wilson School's most
recent alumni directory, found that 13
percent of those who had graduated
since 1948, the year the graduate pro
gram began, worked for the U.S. gov
ernment, and only about 7 percent
were federal employees dealing with
international affairs.
To William Robertson, those num
bers amount to a betrayal of his par
ents, and of the foundation set up to ad
minister the gift.
"The charter itself is really very, very
clear," he said. "And it specifically pro
vides for training students for govern
ment service. It doesn't say 'public ser
vice,' it says 'government service,' and
then it goes on to say more specifically
federal service in international affairs."
In legal documents, the university
contends that federal service in inter
national affairs has been an "aspira
tional goal," not a requirement.
