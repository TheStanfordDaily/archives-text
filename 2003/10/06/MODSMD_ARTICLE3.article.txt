# Political Science department changes major requirements

### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Political science major requirements have shifted yet
again.
After drastic changes last year that placed greater em
phasis on introductory courses, students objected that the
curriculum was inflexible and prevented them from ex
ploring their interests in depth. In response, several new
minor changes are designed to give students more options.
Instead of requiring students to take three out of four
introductory courses from among the field of internation
al relations, American politics, political theory and com
parative politics, the department now only requires them
to choose two such classes, said Political Science Prof.
Michael McFaul, a key player in implementing the
changes.
"The reason behind this is that last year, many students
came to us and said that they had to take too many intro
level courses," he said. "Students want to get into higher
level courses as soon as possible, so we wanted to make
sure we accommodated that."
The faculty members who authored last year's curricu
lum said more introductory classes would provide students
with a broader foundation of knowledge and give them
more direction in constructing their four-year plans.
"I feel two intro courses is a good measure for poli sci
students and that requiring three out of the four intro
courses was particularly restrictive because it limited stu
dents' ability to take some amazing upper level classes,"
said junior Courtney Smith, who plans to major in political
science.
Last year's changes were also prompted by Stanford's
efforts to focus more attention on undergraduate educa
tion. This year, McFaul said the political science faculty
hopes to place more emphasis on preparing its undergrad
uates for graduate study.
In addition to requiring one more upper division course
than before, the new curriculum also allows students to
count a methods course as an introductory class. McFaul
said he hopes this provision will encourage more students
to take methods courses - classes in which students are
taught how to approach reading and analyzing a political
science text. These courses have routinely been neglected
in recent years, he said.
"This recognizes that learning the methods of political
science has become an increasingly important part of the
discipline," McFaul said. "Before, methods was just an
elective course, and students need an incentive to take
things like that."
In promoting methods courses, the department aims to
give its undergraduates a taste of the subjects focused on
by many of its graduate students.
"I think in a small way the changes in the curriculum re
flect our desire to expose undergrads to political science as
it exists at the graduate level," McFaul added. "For a long
time there's been a disconnect between what we teach un
dergrads and what we do in our professional lines of work
and I think we're trying to build a few bridges between un
dergraduate and graduate teaching."
The new changes do not affect students who have al
ready declared political science as their major. Still,
many undeclared sophomores and juniors are not happy
about having to restructure their academic plans. Others
are frustrated that they have taken classes that they
might not have taken had they known the curriculum was
going to change.
"It aggravates me that I had to sit through a class that I
was very disinterested in," said sophomore Marco
DeLeon, who plans to major in political science. "If I
would have known I only needed to take two introductory
classes, I would have chosen to take more classes in my
concentration,"
Whether more changes will follow in the years to come
remains questionable. Several students said they wished
they had not procrastinated in declaring their major, so
that they wouldn't have to worry about these alterations.
While more students may be prompted to declare their
major in political science now, others have stalled their
plans in order to adapt more easily to any future changes.
"Since I've been at Stanford, I feel the poli sci require
ments have been slightly ambiguous," Smith said. "Know
ing there might be further changes, I decided to hold off on
fulfilling the intro class requirement."
