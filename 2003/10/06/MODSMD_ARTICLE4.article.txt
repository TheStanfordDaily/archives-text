# Undeclared juniors face new sanctions
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of undeclared juniors has almost tripled in the last
two years, a trend that has some University administrators worried.
To prevent juniors from deferring the decision any longer, the
Office of the Registrar will place holds on winter quarter registration
for any students who have not declared by the end of fall quarter.
The hold will be removed as soon as students declare their major.
In a mass email sent to undeclared students, Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Bravman said that the biggest reason
to declare is not bureaucratic but educational.
"[As a declared major], you learn about special opportunities in
your major, such as research positions and lectures, through e-mail
distribution lists," he explained.
Bravman also encouraged people who are almost ready but still unde
cided to just declare a major because they can always change their mind later.
