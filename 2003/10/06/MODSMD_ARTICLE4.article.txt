# Undeclared juniors face new sanctions
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of undeclared juniors has almost tripled in the last
two years, a trend that has some University administrators worried.
To prevent juniors from deferring the decision any longer, the
Office of the Registrar will place holds on winter quarter registration
for any students who have not declared by the end of fall quarter.
The hold will be removed as soon as students declare their major.
In a mass email sent to undeclared students, Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Bravman said that the biggest reason
to declare is not bureaucratic but educational.
"[As a declared major], you learn about special opportunities in
your major, such as research positions and lectures, through e-mail
distribution lists," he explained.
Bravman also encouraged people who are almost ready but still unde
cided to just declare a major because they can always change their mind later.
University officials do not know why
the number of students still undeclared
junior year has shot up in recent years.
"Talking with many students has
not led to an answer," Bravman said.
"I've been told that many students
now eagerly await the letter telling
them that they are not yet declared
and see it as some type of badge of

honor to have received it. That's sad
dening for all of us who have been
working hard to make Stanford's ed
ucation the best there is."
Different departments have dif
ferent processes for declaring a
major. Some require essays and
meetings with tentative advisers.
Other departments assign advisers
randomly if the student does not have
one in mind. In addition, students
have to declare their major on Axess.
Bravman said that some students
say they have a hard time finding ad
visors and that the administration is

working to facilitate that process.
"The main obstacle to declaring a
major is finding an advisor, because
everything else is just paperwork,"
said Kristin Wiens, a junior.
Other students said they simply want
ed to wait until they made up their mind.
Junior Cristin Carey said that she has
not declared yet because she did not
know she was going to major in Psychol
ogy until a week ago. She also com
plained about the difficulty of the process.
"[Declaring] seemed like such a
huge pain that I just waited until I had
to," she said.
