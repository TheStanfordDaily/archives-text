### TANIA ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Who ever said that dating doesn't exist
at Stanford?
Move over, "Blind Date" "Random
Hookups" is coming to town.
"Random Hookups" is a television pro
gram sponsored by Absolute Fun an
ASSU campaign launched to improve cam
pus life that hopes to show that romance
and the Farm can go hand-in-hand.
Undergraduate and graduate students
will be paired up to go on a date to nearby
locales in Palo Alto, Mountain View and
Menlo Park with a film crew accompa
nying them.
Their entire date will then be aired on
the show as part of SCTV's programming.

"This program got started as a way to
help improve campus social life," said
ASSU Vice President Joey Natoli, a junior.
"Also, many people within the ASSU had
noticed that a lot of students watch reality
TV, specifically dating game shows. So we
thought it would be fun to have one just for
Stanford students."
The students are selected by filling out
an application with questions regarding
their preference for a mate and by submit
ting their picture. Applicants can be of any
sexual orientation, gender and race. A se
lection committee then interviews and
pairs up a smaller pool of applicants, where
two students are finally chosen to go on a

date.
The show will be taped and
edited in the fall, and will air dur
ing the winter.
"I think it will be very funny,"
said graduate student Allison Lee.
"But I don't see people taking it
very seriously."
The program has already re
ceived a large response from stu
dents during last week's Activities
Fair.
Sophomore Erica Hanson, one
of the students who signed up to be
on the show, believes it's a good
idea.
"People at Stanford don't date
as much, so it's a good way of
meeting new people," she said.
For those students who didn't
sign up at the activities' fair, there's
still a chance for to participate. The
Random Hookups Web site
(http://assu.stanford.edu/ran
domhookups) will be up in the next
two weeks, with information on
how to be on the show, as well as
how to help with directing, filming,
editing and making thought bub
bles that are drawn to put words in
the couple's mouths on-screen.
"It will definitely be more en
tertaining for the dating scene,"
said sophomore Valerie Sanchez.
