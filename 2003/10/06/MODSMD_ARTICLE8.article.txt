## GOOD WILL HUNTING 
### ELENA WRIGHT JASMINE HANIFI 
Its 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, but these freshmen aren't sleeping. Dorm scavenger hunts
in the city are a Stanford tradition on par with steam tunneling and Full Moon on the Quad.
What did they find this year? Two freshmen document their adventures.

Today is the only Saturday I'll be obligated to get up at the wee hour of
8:13 a.m. for a long, long time. I hope. My wonderful roommate awakens me
politely. She's already dressed, showered, brushed her teeth and packed a
sweater.
"Just checking to make sure you were up," she says. "We're meeting
downstairs in 27 minutes."
"Which means when?" I mumble, as I turn over in my oh-so-comfy bed.
8:51 a.m.: We get assigned to our groups (group 12 pride!) and are told that
it'll be 65 degree? in the city today. I'm not in a group with "Skip," my hall
mate, which means I'm already on a losing team. Ever since last night, when
I had come upon him clad solely in a neon orange Chippendale-esque
Speedo, I have known that Skip is the man to beat on the hunt today. I scan
my group for someone who looks like he'd be equally willing to strip to his
birthday suit, but come up short. We're all herded like cows onto large buses.
Skip moos.
10 a.m~* We step out of the bus and are handed the list of what we should
look for. One entry ambiguously urges us to "Hook up with a dormmate (and
when we say 'hook up,' we mean...)," leaving interpretation to the reader.
Group 12 holds an impromptu rendezvous at the nearest McDonald's. One
of the particularly gung-ho freshmen in our group scampers out of our booth
to make an announcement.
"Hello!" he says. "Is there any 7-year-old here we could" he consults
his hunt list "serenade? We're looking for things... we are on a scavenger
hunt..."
His voice gradually trails off. The few people in the store barely look up.
A family in the booth next to us continues feeding bacon to their baby in si
lence. TTiis task might require more finesse than we had originally anticipat
ed.
11:05 a.m.: One item on our list: "Stage a protest outside City Hall." Al
though I want it to be a "No on 54" protest, I am outvoted. "That would be
t00... real" says the glances directed at me.
Now the lone sophomore in our group takes it upon himself to rail against
the blah gray weather. Flinging his hands into the air, he shouts, "This weath
er is not to be tolerated!"
We accost a grizzly man passing by and ask him if he has any tattoos. He
does, and he consents to pose for us.
I realize that finding a drag queen for one of our tasks will be more diffi
cult: "Excuse me, are you a man in drag?"
What if the answer is no?
11:22 a.m.: We obtain a pack of flavored condoms, and five people lick one
for the camera. One frosh male assures us he'll save the rest for later. "That's
practical," nods another.
We continue down Market Street. As we pass a couple of homeless men,

one mumbles something unintelligible. Two girls grip each other and trot
quickly to safety at the front of the group, as one squeals, "I've never been hit
on by a homeless man before! Tee hee!"
11:39 aan.: A rosy-cheeked teenager mingles with us outside a public re
stroom, asking vacantly what is going on. "That's cool, that's cool," he says.
He strikes us as, ahem, not being in full possession of his faculties. Urging us
to take his picture, he pulls down his camouflage cut-offs for emphasis. "I'm
wearing tights!" The faint-of-heart among us keep their eyes averted.
11:43 a.m.: Otero makes a deal with us: We'll be the extra bodies they need
stuffed in the restroom with them ("Remember, partial nudity gets extra
points!"), and they'll spell out FROSOCO with us. The restroom, though
large, has not been properly aerated. Nevertheless, Otero somehow manages
to convince us that the FroSoCo set needs to crowd in the back so the Otero
folk can be seen in the photo. We eye a sign that reads, "Door automatically
opens after 20 minutes." After we exit the stall, I share a knowing glance with
an Oteroan as some innocent tourist walks in to use the facilities. Little does
the hapless man know what he is about to encounter...
11:50 a.in.: I volunteer to be temporarily handcuffed. Having a random
guy take multiple pictures of me was not part of the bargain, but it happened
anyway. Me: "Hey! Don't take pictures of me!" My desired response from
him: "Oh sorry, my bad. Would you like to destroy the film personally?" His
actual response: devious chuckling.
"Why are you posing for a picture if you don't want it on film?" some
one asks. My arresting officer says the photographer is affiliated with the
station he has come prepared. Visions of my picture on "Wanted"
signs and on future episode of "Cops" haunt me.
12:10 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret.
12:24 p.m.: Guys and girls are made over in Victoria's Secret make-up bou
tique. While there, we encounter another group of Stanford students. The
tallest guy is made up in pink. Lots of pink. He asks the workers for more lip
stick, and they happily oblige. While on the chair, his cell phone goes off.
"Oh, it's my girlfriend," he says, and then answers the phone." Hi, I'm get
ting lipstick put on right now. I'll call you back. Love you too."
He tells me later he's Donny, "the one from the paper," recently kicked
out of Roble. I ask to take a picture with him. "Am I your drag queen?" he
asks playfully.
1:10 p.m.: Eating Chinese food to the strains of R. Kelly's " I Believe I Can
Fly." Odd.
3:02 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret. Again.
3:45 pan.: We're at the base of the cable car fine, where a long line of peo
ple wait rather than walk up two blocks to the next stop (something I'll never
understand... but I digress).
"Ladies and gentlemen. We have an announcement to make. We are stu
dents representing our college, and we would be most pleased if we could sing

someone 'Happy Birthday.' Is it anyone's birthday today?"
The crowd appears bemused. At long last, the little girl who we've seen
handing out "Free Personality Test!" pamphlets for hours says softly, "Yes,
me. It's my birthday."
One conscientious undergrad says, "Yeah, but if she doesn't have an ID
for proof, it's useless." Majority decision is made to sing to her a song anyway
and take her picture. Happy birthday, Mackenzie!
3:10 p.m.: We meet Elvis. He's passing out e√üay ticket stubs to passersby,
and he's happy to take a picture with us. He croons, "Viva Las Vegas." Not
the song, just that sentence, ad nauseum. None of our fellow pedestrians
seems surprised that the King is alive, well and hanging out in the Arts district.
But maybe his presence is not so incongruous in them here parts.
3:43 pan.: We head south, toward SFMOMA and the Metreon. As we
cross Market, we encounter a colorful character preaching. We don't catch
most of his sermon; we just hear, "No sloppy seconds!" and are struck by a
cold glare. We cross quickly.
3:49 pan.: Location: Metreon. While my group diligently sends one of our
RAs, an e-call from one of the computers there, I watch a music video for the
song "Chicken-head" alongside a riveted security guard. I was unfamiliar
with this particular piece, but what I glean from the video is that several scant
ily clad females, adorned with beauty-pageant sashes reading, "Miss Hoochie
Mama" and "Miss Gold Digger," are vying for the attention of one "Chick
en-head." Almost makes me yearn for my Visual Rhetoric class. Ah, the com
plexities of modern art. And we haven't even visited SFMOMA yet!
4:55 p.m.: We make it back to the meeting place, with five minutes to
spare! Our friends regale us with details of their own journeys. Answers
range from "The silver man kissed me, but it took him a really long time" to
"Yeah, I did the mooning thing" to "My only regret is that there's going to be
a picture of me in drag. I just hope nobody sees it."
5:10 p.m. My friend tells me that our friend David "got the most play" of
anyone in their group. An female stranger kissed him thrice. "And not short
kisses, either. They got longer and longer. No tongue, though." The obser
vation is made that he has never seemed happier in the two weeks and two
days we've been here. He adjusts his glasses and beams.
5:15 p.m. As predicted, Skip has carried his team. He streaked, licked and
stripped like a hero. His teammates' sole gripe is that he wore one girl's new
Victoria's Secret panties for much of the day, and may have ruined them.
5:18 p.m. Impossible task of the day seems to be to apply for a position as
a stripper. One girl tells me she was coldly rejected when she expressed inter
est; the manager at an establishment told her, "Just go." Another girl said,
"They wouldn't let us apply, but they'd let us strip." Everyone is disappoint
ed.

6:50 p.m. We've been together for scarcely two hours, and, already, the
rumor mill is churning. One particularly good story is how a Schiff guy was
chased out of a porn shop with a bat. The New Yorker who tells us this says,
"I'm from a big city. I know crazy people. But the people in San Francisco are
friggin' CRAZY." His eyes widen, and he shakes his head slowly back and
forth. "Friggin' crazy." The other freshmen nod sagely in agreement.

7:30 a.m.: Trying to avoid the
shower queue in Donner, I wake up
far too early. Falling back asleep on
my futon, I wake again to shouts and
door-pounding. The 30 freshmen on
my floor sleepily shuffle after the RA,
in one long straggly line, down to the
lounge.
8:30 a.m.: Our eyes widen as we
survey the list of scavenger-hunt mis
sions: 30 points will go to the Donner
ite willing to get it on in the San Fran
cisco zoo. We will garner extra points
for "creativity" (read: nudity).
"Remember, we are not responsi
ble if you are arrested," our HPAC
warns us for the fifth time in 15 min
utes.
9:10 a.m.: Who's willing to "ex
plore a Larkin dorm member in the
Exploratorium," as the list instructs?
Or to read dirty novels in the chil
dren's section of City Lights? On the
bus, team morale is high as our group
maps out a route through San Francis
co.
9:50 a.m.: We get off the bus at
Union Square; options abound. Our
first stop is Puma, where we poke
about, looking for the in-store DJ's
turntables. When a clerk ushers us out
of the store, cursing under his breath
the first of many employees to in
form us that under no grounds are we
allowed to take photos in their estab
lishments we walk on.
One of our team members steals a
kiss from a Larkin guy: one point.
Next up: the Virgin Megastore,
where I pretend to give birth next to
the classical CDs. A male team mem
ber kindly holds my hand through the
process.
10 a.m.: The quietest member of
our group gropes one of the faceless
black plastic mannequins in the Nike
superstore. Guess that's his friendly
way of exclaiming "Tag, you're it!"
just before yet another clerk tells us in
no uncertain terms to leave the build
ing.
One of the girls and I search for ex
pensive clothes in Neiman Marcus to
try on a difficult feat since the fur
coats are virtually locked to their
hangers. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group accompanies one of the more
flamboyant guys to Macy's for a full
makeover.
10:15 a.m.: Missions accom
plished! Our rouged and lipsticked
male team member is positively radi
ant. Flushed with victory, we infil
trate Victoria's Secret, only to en
counter some very irate salespeople.
I try to convince them to let Brian
enter the dressing room with me so
that I can take a photograph of him
trying on a pale pink push-up bra, but
to no avail.
10:25 a.m.: No go at Tiffany's. My
friend laments the failure: "A $lO,OOO
ring would have looked so good on
me, t00..."
10:30 a.m.: Snapped a pic of the
first fully naked frosh of the day.
10:40 a.m.: In true Stanford spirit,
we attack a 20-year-old wearing a Cal
baseball cap. I belt out "You've Lost
That Loving Feeling" to a puzzled
tourist. Rory poses at the Drake with
a cap supplied by an amiable bellhop.
Mackenzie leaps onto a cable car to
sing the Rice-A-Roni jingle.
11:30 a.m: Ghirardelli Square wel
comes our tired feet. Under the near
by Larkin Street sign, we and a group
of Larkinites nab the opportunity to

win three points for a Donner-Larkin
kiss. One of the guys from our group
succumbs to a peck from two Larkin
girls.
Noon: Ted dives into the fountain
at Ghirardelli Square, braving 60-de
gree temperatures and shrieks from
pre-teen onlookers.
The dorm scarfs down a gargantu
an "Vermonster" sundae at Ghi
rardelli's. Scoops of cookie dough,
mint chocolate chip and strawberry
cheesecake disappear in record time.
One of us challenges the Rhyme
Guy at the foot of the steps leading up
to the Square to a rhyme-off. He an
swers to the effect of, "What is a
rhyme-off? / Maybe you should take
some time off / To consider it mister /
And then buy me some pizza."
1:15 p.m.: We lose three of our
group members to an arcade with
Dance Dance Revolution and an
IMAX showing.
The rest of us bark at the sea lions,
protest wax use (um, yeah) at the wax
museum and yell "Cal Sucks" repeat
edly for points.
1:35 p.m.: Six of us spell "DON
NER" with our bodies in front of a
grassy lot near the pier. "Can't we
make the picture look dirtier?" one
guy pleads.
2:20 p.m.: Midway up a very steep
hill, two more girls decide to return to
Union Square for quality time at the
San Francisco Shopping Center. The
remaining five of us trudge onward.
2:25 p.m.: ... and onward.
2:35 p.m.: Dear God, will these
hills ever end?
2:37 p.m.: Inspired by the sight of
an orange traffic cone, Rory and Ted
strip and utilize the traffic cone in a
most amusing manner. Too bad only
one of them can wear the cone at a
time ...
3 p.m.: Sauntering toward the
Haight-Ashbury intersection, we en
counter more cardinal sweatshirts
than I saw during all of Admit Week
end. Students most of them from
Branner streak down Haight in
twos and threes sporadically. (Wait,
isn't that kid in my I-Hum section?)
The hippies seem to consider the
naked coed scene passe. "You Stan
ford students think you're hot shit,
doncha?" one stringy-haired burnout
calls to me.
4 p.m.: After visiting a few...
ahem ... specialty stores, we end up
at Mom's Tattoo and Piercing Parlor,
where Rory and a couple other Don
nerites bite the bullet for the sake of
their teams and end up looking really
badass. Until they beg us for Advil,
anyhow.
5 p.m.: Finally, dinner! We un
steadily navigate our way to
Tommy's Joynt, on the corner of
Van Ness Avenue. The people who
have been marked for life in the
piercing parlor are still giddy with
the euphoria of pain, it seems. We lo
cate the restaurant relatively quick
ly, but getting our food is a different
story. The loooong buffet line ex
tends in two directions. What's left
of our group scatters.
7 p.m.: Donner Group Three re
forms once again in Front of the
Opera House, among the RAs and
other groups. The evening is chilly,
but everyone forgets to moan about
the weather in favor of more pressing
matters: obsessing about how they
need to wash their hands and mar
veling at how well their respective
groups did.




Dorm scavenger hunts provide a plethora of photo opportunities. (From
top right, clockwise): The San Francisco treat: A ride on a cample car;
make-over madness; a man shows us his tattoo; Wright embraces a
stranger for a quick shot and she scores ... points for her team.

The dorm scarfs down a gargantu
an "Vermonster" sundae at Ghi
rardelli's. Scoops of cookie dough,
mint chocolate chip and strawberry
cheesecake disappear in record time.
One of us challenges the Rhyme
Guy at the foot of the steps leading up
to the Square to a rhyme-off. He an
swers to the effect of, "What is a
rhyme-off? / Maybe you should take
some time off / To consider it mister /
And then buy me some pizza."
1:15 p.m.: We lose three of our
group members to an arcade with
Dance Dance Revolution and an
IMAX showing.
The rest of us bark at the sea lions,
protest wax use (um, yeah) at the wax
museum and yell "Cal Sucks" repeat
edly for points.
1:35 p.m.: Six of us spell "DON
NER" with our bodies in front of a
grassy lot near the pier. "Can't we
make the picture look dirtier?" one
guy pleads.
2:20 p.m.: Midway up a very steep
hill, two more girls decide to return to
Union Square for quality time at the
San Francisco Shopping Center. The
remaining five of us trudge onward.
2:25 p.m.: ... and onward.
2:35 p.m.: Dear God, will these
hills ever end?
2:37 p.m.: Inspired by the sight of
an orange traffic cone, Rory and Ted
strip and utilize the traffic cone in a
most amusing manner. Too bad only
one of them can wear the cone at a
time ...
3 p.m.: Sauntering toward the
Haight-Ashbury intersection, we en
counter more cardinal sweatshirts
than I saw during all of Admit Week
end. Students most of them from
Branner streak down Haight in
twos and threes sporadically. (Wait,
isn't that kid in my I-Hum section?)
The hippies seem to consider the
naked coed scene passe. "You Stan
ford students think you're hot shit,
doncha?" one stringy-haired burnout
calls to me.
4 p.m.: After visiting a few...
ahem ... specialty stores, we end up
at Mom's Tattoo and Piercing Parlor,
where Rory and a couple other Don
nerites bite the bullet for the sake of
their teams and end up looking really
badass. Until they beg us for Advil,
anyhow.
5 p.m.: Finally, dinner! We un
steadily navigate our way to
Tommy's Joynt, on the corner of
Van Ness Avenue. The people who
have been marked for life in the
piercing parlor are still giddy with
the euphoria of pain, it seems. We lo
cate the restaurant relatively quick
ly, but getting our food is a different
story. The loooong buffet line ex
tends in two directions. What's left
of our group scatters.
7 p.m.: Donner Group Three re
forms once again in Front of the
Opera House, among the RAs and
other groups. The evening is chilly,
but everyone forgets to moan about
the weather in favor of more pressing
matters: obsessing about how they
need to wash their hands and mar
veling at how well their respective
groups did.




Dorm scavenger hunts provide a plethora of photo opportunities. (From
top right, clockwise): The San Francisco treat: A ride on a cample car;
make-over madness; a man shows us his tattoo; Wright embraces a
stranger for a quick shot and she scores ... points for her team.

Its 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, but these freshmen aren't sleeping. Dorm scavenger hunts
in the city are a Stanford tradition on par with steam tunneling and Full Moon on the Quad.
What did they find this year? Two freshmen document their adventures.

Today is the only Saturday I'll be obligated to get up at the wee hour of
8:13 a.m. for a long, long time. I hope. My wonderful roommate awakens me
politely. She's already dressed, showered, brushed her teeth and packed a
sweater.
"Just checking to make sure you were up," she says. "We're meeting
downstairs in 27 minutes."
"Which means when?" I mumble, as I turn over in my oh-so-comfy bed.
8:51 a.m.: We get assigned to our groups (group 12 pride!) and are told that
it'll be 65 degree? in the city today. I'm not in a group with "Skip," my hall
mate, which means I'm already on a losing team. Ever since last night, when
I had come upon him clad solely in a neon orange Chippendale-esque
Speedo, I have known that Skip is the man to beat on the hunt today. I scan
my group for someone who looks like he'd be equally willing to strip to his
birthday suit, but come up short. We're all herded like cows onto large buses.
Skip moos.
10 a.m~* We step out of the bus and are handed the list of what we should
look for. One entry ambiguously urges us to "Hook up with a dormmate (and
when we say 'hook up,' we mean...)," leaving interpretation to the reader.
Group 12 holds an impromptu rendezvous at the nearest McDonald's. One
of the particularly gung-ho freshmen in our group scampers out of our booth
to make an announcement.
"Hello!" he says. "Is there any 7-year-old here we could" he consults
his hunt list "serenade? We're looking for things... we are on a scavenger
hunt..."
His voice gradually trails off. The few people in the store barely look up.
A family in the booth next to us continues feeding bacon to their baby in si
lence. TTiis task might require more finesse than we had originally anticipat
ed.
11:05 a.m.: One item on our list: "Stage a protest outside City Hall." Al
though I want it to be a "No on 54" protest, I am outvoted. "That would be
t00... real" says the glances directed at me.
Now the lone sophomore in our group takes it upon himself to rail against
the blah gray weather. Flinging his hands into the air, he shouts, "This weath
er is not to be tolerated!"
We accost a grizzly man passing by and ask him if he has any tattoos. He
does, and he consents to pose for us.
I realize that finding a drag queen for one of our tasks will be more diffi
cult: "Excuse me, are you a man in drag?"
What if the answer is no?
11:22 a.m.: We obtain a pack of flavored condoms, and five people lick one
for the camera. One frosh male assures us he'll save the rest for later. "That's
practical," nods another.
We continue down Market Street. As we pass a couple of homeless men,

one mumbles something unintelligible. Two girls grip each other and trot
quickly to safety at the front of the group, as one squeals, "I've never been hit
on by a homeless man before! Tee hee!"
11:39 aan.: A rosy-cheeked teenager mingles with us outside a public re
stroom, asking vacantly what is going on. "That's cool, that's cool," he says.
He strikes us as, ahem, not being in full possession of his faculties. Urging us
to take his picture, he pulls down his camouflage cut-offs for emphasis. "I'm
wearing tights!" The faint-of-heart among us keep their eyes averted.
11:43 a.m.: Otero makes a deal with us: We'll be the extra bodies they need
stuffed in the restroom with them ("Remember, partial nudity gets extra
points!"), and they'll spell out FROSOCO with us. The restroom, though
large, has not been properly aerated. Nevertheless, Otero somehow manages
to convince us that the FroSoCo set needs to crowd in the back so the Otero
folk can be seen in the photo. We eye a sign that reads, "Door automatically
opens after 20 minutes." After we exit the stall, I share a knowing glance with
an Oteroan as some innocent tourist walks in to use the facilities. Little does
the hapless man know what he is about to encounter...
11:50 a.in.: I volunteer to be temporarily handcuffed. Having a random
guy take multiple pictures of me was not part of the bargain, but it happened
anyway. Me: "Hey! Don't take pictures of me!" My desired response from
him: "Oh sorry, my bad. Would you like to destroy the film personally?" His
actual response: devious chuckling.
"Why are you posing for a picture if you don't want it on film?" some
one asks. My arresting officer says the photographer is affiliated with the
station he has come prepared. Visions of my picture on "Wanted"
signs and on future episode of "Cops" haunt me.
12:10 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret.
12:24 p.m.: Guys and girls are made over in Victoria's Secret make-up bou
tique. While there, we encounter another group of Stanford students. The
tallest guy is made up in pink. Lots of pink. He asks the workers for more lip
stick, and they happily oblige. While on the chair, his cell phone goes off.
"Oh, it's my girlfriend," he says, and then answers the phone." Hi, I'm get
ting lipstick put on right now. I'll call you back. Love you too."
He tells me later he's Donny, "the one from the paper," recently kicked
out of Roble. I ask to take a picture with him. "Am I your drag queen?" he
asks playfully.
1:10 p.m.: Eating Chinese food to the strains of R. Kelly's " I Believe I Can
Fly." Odd.
3:02 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret. Again.
3:45 pan.: We're at the base of the cable car fine, where a long line of peo
ple wait rather than walk up two blocks to the next stop (something I'll never
understand... but I digress).
"Ladies and gentlemen. We have an announcement to make. We are stu
dents representing our college, and we would be most pleased if we could sing

someone 'Happy Birthday.' Is it anyone's birthday today?"
The crowd appears bemused. At long last, the little girl who we've seen
handing out "Free Personality Test!" pamphlets for hours says softly, "Yes,
me. It's my birthday."
One conscientious undergrad says, "Yeah, but if she doesn't have an ID
for proof, it's useless." Majority decision is made to sing to her a song anyway
and take her picture. Happy birthday, Mackenzie!
3:10 p.m.: We meet Elvis. He's passing out e√üay ticket stubs to passersby,
and he's happy to take a picture with us. He croons, "Viva Las Vegas." Not
the song, just that sentence, ad nauseum. None of our fellow pedestrians
seems surprised that the King is alive, well and hanging out in the Arts district.
But maybe his presence is not so incongruous in them here parts.
3:43 pan.: We head south, toward SFMOMA and the Metreon. As we
cross Market, we encounter a colorful character preaching. We don't catch
most of his sermon; we just hear, "No sloppy seconds!" and are struck by a
cold glare. We cross quickly.
3:49 pan.: Location: Metreon. While my group diligently sends one of our
RAs, an e-call from one of the computers there, I watch a music video for the
song "Chicken-head" alongside a riveted security guard. I was unfamiliar
with this particular piece, but what I glean from the video is that several scant
ily clad females, adorned with beauty-pageant sashes reading, "Miss Hoochie
Mama" and "Miss Gold Digger," are vying for the attention of one "Chick
en-head." Almost makes me yearn for my Visual Rhetoric class. Ah, the com
plexities of modern art. And we haven't even visited SFMOMA yet!
4:55 p.m.: We make it back to the meeting place, with five minutes to
spare! Our friends regale us with details of their own journeys. Answers
range from "The silver man kissed me, but it took him a really long time" to
"Yeah, I did the mooning thing" to "My only regret is that there's going to be
a picture of me in drag. I just hope nobody sees it."
5:10 p.m. My friend tells me that our friend David "got the most play" of
anyone in their group. An female stranger kissed him thrice. "And not short
kisses, either. They got longer and longer. No tongue, though." The obser
vation is made that he has never seemed happier in the two weeks and two
days we've been here. He adjusts his glasses and beams.
5:15 p.m. As predicted, Skip has carried his team. He streaked, licked and
stripped like a hero. His teammates' sole gripe is that he wore one girl's new
Victoria's Secret panties for much of the day, and may have ruined them.
5:18 p.m. Impossible task of the day seems to be to apply for a position as
a stripper. One girl tells me she was coldly rejected when she expressed inter
est; the manager at an establishment told her, "Just go." Another girl said,
"They wouldn't let us apply, but they'd let us strip." Everyone is disappoint
ed.

6:50 p.m. We've been together for scarcely two hours, and, already, the
rumor mill is churning. One particularly good story is how a Schiff guy was
chased out of a porn shop with a bat. The New Yorker who tells us this says,
"I'm from a big city. I know crazy people. But the people in San Francisco are
friggin' CRAZY." His eyes widen, and he shakes his head slowly back and
forth. "Friggin' crazy." The other freshmen nod sagely in agreement.

7:30 a.m.: Trying to avoid the
shower queue in Donner, I wake up
far too early. Falling back asleep on
my futon, I wake again to shouts and
door-pounding. The 30 freshmen on
my floor sleepily shuffle after the RA,
in one long straggly line, down to the
lounge.
8:30 a.m.: Our eyes widen as we
survey the list of scavenger-hunt mis
sions: 30 points will go to the Donner
ite willing to get it on in the San Fran
cisco zoo. We will garner extra points
for "creativity" (read: nudity).
"Remember, we are not responsi
ble if you are arrested," our HPAC
warns us for the fifth time in 15 min
utes.
9:10 a.m.: Who's willing to "ex
plore a Larkin dorm member in the
Exploratorium," as the list instructs?
Or to read dirty novels in the chil
dren's section of City Lights? On the
bus, team morale is high as our group
maps out a route through San Francis
co.
9:50 a.m.: We get off the bus at
Union Square; options abound. Our
first stop is Puma, where we poke
about, looking for the in-store DJ's
turntables. When a clerk ushers us out
of the store, cursing under his breath
the first of many employees to in
form us that under no grounds are we
allowed to take photos in their estab
lishments we walk on.
One of our team members steals a
kiss from a Larkin guy: one point.
Next up: the Virgin Megastore,
where I pretend to give birth next to
the classical CDs. A male team mem
ber kindly holds my hand through the
process.
10 a.m.: The quietest member of
our group gropes one of the faceless
black plastic mannequins in the Nike
superstore. Guess that's his friendly
way of exclaiming "Tag, you're it!"
just before yet another clerk tells us in
no uncertain terms to leave the build
ing.
One of the girls and I search for ex
pensive clothes in Neiman Marcus to
try on a difficult feat since the fur
coats are virtually locked to their
hangers. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group accompanies one of the more
flamboyant guys to Macy's for a full
makeover.
10:15 a.m.: Missions accom
plished! Our rouged and lipsticked
male team member is positively radi
ant. Flushed with victory, we infil
trate Victoria's Secret, only to en
counter some very irate salespeople.
I try to convince them to let Brian
enter the dressing room with me so
that I can take a photograph of him
trying on a pale pink push-up bra, but
to no avail.
10:25 a.m.: No go at Tiffany's. My
friend laments the failure: "A $lO,OOO
ring would have looked so good on
me, t00..."
10:30 a.m.: Snapped a pic of the
first fully naked frosh of the day.
10:40 a.m.: In true Stanford spirit,
we attack a 20-year-old wearing a Cal
baseball cap. I belt out "You've Lost
That Loving Feeling" to a puzzled
tourist. Rory poses at the Drake with
a cap supplied by an amiable bellhop.
Mackenzie leaps onto a cable car to
sing the Rice-A-Roni jingle.
11:30 a.m: Ghirardelli Square wel
comes our tired feet. Under the near
by Larkin Street sign, we and a group
of Larkinites nab the opportunity to

win three points for a Donner-Larkin
kiss. One of the guys from our group
succumbs to a peck from two Larkin
girls.
Noon: Ted dives into the fountain
at Ghirardelli Square, braving 60-de
gree temperatures and shrieks from
pre-teen onlookers.
The dorm scarfs down a gargantu
an "Vermonster" sundae at Ghi
rardelli's. Scoops of cookie dough,
mint chocolate chip and strawberry
cheesecake disappear in record time.
One of us challenges the Rhyme
Guy at the foot of the steps leading up
to the Square to a rhyme-off. He an
swers to the effect of, "What is a
rhyme-off? / Maybe you should take
some time off / To consider it mister /
And then buy me some pizza."
1:15 p.m.: We lose three of our
group members to an arcade with
Dance Dance Revolution and an
IMAX showing.
The rest of us bark at the sea lions,
protest wax use (um, yeah) at the wax
museum and yell "Cal Sucks" repeat
edly for points.
1:35 p.m.: Six of us spell "DON
NER" with our bodies in front of a
grassy lot near the pier. "Can't we
make the picture look dirtier?" one
guy pleads.
2:20 p.m.: Midway up a very steep
hill, two more girls decide to return to
Union Square for quality time at the
San Francisco Shopping Center. The
remaining five of us trudge onward.
2:25 p.m.: ... and onward.
2:35 p.m.: Dear God, will these
hills ever end?
2:37 p.m.: Inspired by the sight of
an orange traffic cone, Rory and Ted
strip and utilize the traffic cone in a
most amusing manner. Too bad only
one of them can wear the cone at a
time ...
3 p.m.: Sauntering toward the
Haight-Ashbury intersection, we en
counter more cardinal sweatshirts
than I saw during all of Admit Week
end. Students most of them from
Branner streak down Haight in
twos and threes sporadically. (Wait,
isn't that kid in my I-Hum section?)
The hippies seem to consider the
naked coed scene passe. "You Stan
ford students think you're hot shit,
doncha?" one stringy-haired burnout
calls to me.
4 p.m.: After visiting a few...
ahem ... specialty stores, we end up
at Mom's Tattoo and Piercing Parlor,
where Rory and a couple other Don
nerites bite the bullet for the sake of
their teams and end up looking really
badass. Until they beg us for Advil,

ite willing to get it on in the San Fran
cisco zoo. We will garner extra points
for "creativity" (read: nudity).
"Remember, we are not responsi
ble if you are arrested," our HPAC
warns us for the fifth time in 15 min
utes.
9:10 a.m.: Who's willing to "ex
plore a Larkin dorm member in the
Exploratorium," as the list instructs?
Or to read dirty novels in the chil
dren's section of City Lights? On the
bus, team morale is high as our group
maps out a route through San Francis
co.
9:50 a.m.: We get off the bus at
Union Square; options abound. Our
first stop is Puma, where we poke
about, looking for the in-store DJ's
turntables. When a clerk ushers us out
of the store, cursing under his breath
the first of many employees to in
form us that under no grounds are we
allowed to take photos in their estab
lishments we walk on.
One of our team members steals a
kiss from a Larkin guy: one point.
Next up: the Virgin Megastore,
where I pretend to give birth next to
the classical CDs. A male team mem
ber kindly holds my hand through the
process.
10 a.m.: The quietest member of
our group gropes one of the faceless
black plastic mannequins in the Nike
superstore. Guess that's his friendly
way of exclaiming "Tag, you're it!"
just before yet another clerk tells us in
no uncertain terms to leave the build
ing.
One of the girls and I search for ex
pensive clothes in Neiman Marcus to
try on a difficult feat since the fur
coats are virtually locked to their
hangers. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group accompanies one of the more
flamboyant guys to Macy's for a full
makeover.
10:15 a.m.: Missions accom
plished! Our rouged and lipsticked
male team member is positively radi
ant. Flushed with victory, we infil
trate Victoria's Secret, only to en
counter some very irate salespeople.
I try to convince them to let Brian
enter the dressing room with me so
that I can take a photograph of him
trying on a pale pink push-up bra, but
to no avail.
10:25 a.m.: No go at Tiffany's. My
friend laments the failure: "A $lO,OOO
ring would have looked so good on
me, t00..."
10:30 a.m.: Snapped a pic of the
first fully naked frosh of the day.
10:40 a.m.: In true Stanford spirit,
we attack a 20-year-old wearing a Cal
baseball cap. I belt out "You've Lost
That Loving Feeling" to a puzzled
tourist. Rory poses at the Drake with
a cap supplied by an amiable bellhop.
Mackenzie leaps onto a cable car to
sing the Rice-A-Roni jingle.
11:30 a.m: Ghirardelli Square wel
comes our tired feet. Under the near
by Larkin Street sign, we and a group
of Larkinites nab the opportunity to

win three points for a Donner-Larkin
kiss. One of the guys from our group
succumbs to a peck from two Larkin
girls.
Noon: Ted dives into the fountain
at Ghirardelli Square, braving 60-de
gree temperatures and shrieks from
pre-teen onlookers.
The dorm scarfs down a gargantu
an "Vermonster" sundae at Ghi
rardelli's. Scoops of cookie dough,
mint chocolate chip and strawberry
cheesecake disappear in record time.
One of us challenges the Rhyme
Guy at the foot of the steps leading up
to the Square to a rhyme-off. He an
swers to the effect of, "What is a
rhyme-off? / Maybe you should take
some time off / To consider it mister /
And then buy me some pizza."
1:15 p.m.: We lose three of our
group members to an arcade with
Dance Dance Revolution and an
IMAX showing.
The rest of us bark at the sea lions,
protest wax use (um, yeah) at the wax
museum and yell "Cal Sucks" repeat
edly for points.
1:35 p.m.: Six of us spell "DON
NER" with our bodies in front of a
grassy lot near the pier. "Can't we
make the picture look dirtier?" one
guy pleads.
2:20 p.m.: Midway up a very steep
hill, two more girls decide to return to
Union Square for quality time at the
San Francisco Shopping Center. The
remaining five of us trudge onward.
2:25 p.m.: ... and onward.
2:35 p.m.: Dear God, will these
hills ever end?
2:37 p.m.: Inspired by the sight of
an orange traffic cone, Rory and Ted
strip and utilize the traffic cone in a
most amusing manner. Too bad only
one of them can wear the cone at a
time ...
3 p.m.: Sauntering toward the
Haight-Ashbury intersection, we en
counter more cardinal sweatshirts
than I saw during all of Admit Week
end. Students most of them from
Branner streak down Haight in
twos and threes sporadically. (Wait,
isn't that kid in my I-Hum section?)
The hippies seem to consider the
naked coed scene passe. "You Stan
ford students think you're hot shit,
doncha?" one stringy-haired burnout
calls to me.
4 p.m.: After visiting a few...
ahem ... specialty stores, we end up
at Mom's Tattoo and Piercing Parlor,
where Rory and a couple other Don
nerites bite the bullet for the sake of
their teams and end up looking really
badass. Until they beg us for Advil,
anyhow.
5 p.m.: Finally, dinner! We un
steadily navigate our way to
Tommy's Joynt, on the corner of
Van Ness Avenue. The people who
have been marked for life in the
piercing parlor are still giddy with
the euphoria of pain, it seems. We lo
cate the restaurant relatively quick
ly, but getting our food is a different
story. The loooong buffet line ex
tends in two directions. What's left
of our group scatters.
7 p.m.: Donner Group Three re
forms once again in Front of the
Opera House, among the RAs and
other groups. The evening is chilly,
but everyone forgets to moan about
the weather in favor of more pressing
matters: obsessing about how they
need to wash their hands and mar
veling at how well their respective
groups did.




Dorm scavenger hunts provide a plethora of photo opportunities. (From
top right, clockwise): The San Francisco treat: A ride on a cample car;
make-over madness; a man shows us his tattoo; Wright embraces a
stranger for a quick shot and she scores ... points for her team.

Its 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, but these freshmen aren't sleeping. Dorm scavenger hunts
in the city are a Stanford tradition on par with steam tunneling and Full Moon on the Quad.
What did they find this year? Two freshmen document their adventures.

Today is the only Saturday I'll be obligated to get up at the wee hour of
8:13 a.m. for a long, long time. I hope. My wonderful roommate awakens me
politely. She's already dressed, showered, brushed her teeth and packed a
sweater.
"Just checking to make sure you were up," she says. "We're meeting
downstairs in 27 minutes."
"Which means when?" I mumble, as I turn over in my oh-so-comfy bed.
8:51 a.m.: We get assigned to our groups (group 12 pride!) and are told that
it'll be 65 degree? in the city today. I'm not in a group with "Skip," my hall
mate, which means I'm already on a losing team. Ever since last night, when
I had come upon him clad solely in a neon orange Chippendale-esque
Speedo, I have known that Skip is the man to beat on the hunt today. I scan
my group for someone who looks like he'd be equally willing to strip to his
birthday suit, but come up short. We're all herded like cows onto large buses.
Skip moos.
10 a.m~* We step out of the bus and are handed the list of what we should
look for. One entry ambiguously urges us to "Hook up with a dormmate (and
when we say 'hook up,' we mean...)," leaving interpretation to the reader.
Group 12 holds an impromptu rendezvous at the nearest McDonald's. One
of the particularly gung-ho freshmen in our group scampers out of our booth
to make an announcement.
"Hello!" he says. "Is there any 7-year-old here we could" he consults
his hunt list "serenade? We're looking for things... we are on a scavenger
hunt..."
His voice gradually trails off. The few people in the store barely look up.
A family in the booth next to us continues feeding bacon to their baby in si
lence. TTiis task might require more finesse than we had originally anticipat
ed.
11:05 a.m.: One item on our list: "Stage a protest outside City Hall." Al
though I want it to be a "No on 54" protest, I am outvoted. "That would be
t00... real" says the glances directed at me.
Now the lone sophomore in our group takes it upon himself to rail against
the blah gray weather. Flinging his hands into the air, he shouts, "This weath
er is not to be tolerated!"
We accost a grizzly man passing by and ask him if he has any tattoos. He
does, and he consents to pose for us.
I realize that finding a drag queen for one of our tasks will be more diffi
cult: "Excuse me, are you a man in drag?"
What if the answer is no?
11:22 a.m.: We obtain a pack of flavored condoms, and five people lick one
for the camera. One frosh male assures us he'll save the rest for later. "That's
practical," nods another.
We continue down Market Street. As we pass a couple of homeless men,

one mumbles something unintelligible. Two girls grip each other and trot
quickly to safety at the front of the group, as one squeals, "I've never been hit
on by a homeless man before! Tee hee!"
11:39 aan.: A rosy-cheeked teenager mingles with us outside a public re
stroom, asking vacantly what is going on. "That's cool, that's cool," he says.
He strikes us as, ahem, not being in full possession of his faculties. Urging us
to take his picture, he pulls down his camouflage cut-offs for emphasis. "I'm
wearing tights!" The faint-of-heart among us keep their eyes averted.
11:43 a.m.: Otero makes a deal with us: We'll be the extra bodies they need
stuffed in the restroom with them ("Remember, partial nudity gets extra
points!"), and they'll spell out FROSOCO with us. The restroom, though
large, has not been properly aerated. Nevertheless, Otero somehow manages
to convince us that the FroSoCo set needs to crowd in the back so the Otero
folk can be seen in the photo. We eye a sign that reads, "Door automatically
opens after 20 minutes." After we exit the stall, I share a knowing glance with
an Oteroan as some innocent tourist walks in to use the facilities. Little does
the hapless man know what he is about to encounter...
11:50 a.in.: I volunteer to be temporarily handcuffed. Having a random
guy take multiple pictures of me was not part of the bargain, but it happened
anyway. Me: "Hey! Don't take pictures of me!" My desired response from
him: "Oh sorry, my bad. Would you like to destroy the film personally?" His
actual response: devious chuckling.
"Why are you posing for a picture if you don't want it on film?" some
one asks. My arresting officer says the photographer is affiliated with the
station he has come prepared. Visions of my picture on "Wanted"
signs and on future episode of "Cops" haunt me.
12:10 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret.
12:24 p.m.: Guys and girls are made over in Victoria's Secret make-up bou
tique. While there, we encounter another group of Stanford students. The
tallest guy is made up in pink. Lots of pink. He asks the workers for more lip
stick, and they happily oblige. While on the chair, his cell phone goes off.
"Oh, it's my girlfriend," he says, and then answers the phone." Hi, I'm get
ting lipstick put on right now. I'll call you back. Love you too."
He tells me later he's Donny, "the one from the paper," recently kicked
out of Roble. I ask to take a picture with him. "Am I your drag queen?" he
asks playfully.
1:10 p.m.: Eating Chinese food to the strains of R. Kelly's " I Believe I Can
Fly." Odd.
3:02 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret. Again.
3:45 pan.: We're at the base of the cable car fine, where a long line of peo
ple wait rather than walk up two blocks to the next stop (something I'll never
understand... but I digress).
"Ladies and gentlemen. We have an announcement to make. We are stu
dents representing our college, and we would be most pleased if we could sing

someone 'Happy Birthday.' Is it anyone's birthday today?"
The crowd appears bemused. At long last, the little girl who we've seen
handing out "Free Personality Test!" pamphlets for hours says softly, "Yes,
me. It's my birthday."
One conscientious undergrad says, "Yeah, but if she doesn't have an ID
for proof, it's useless." Majority decision is made to sing to her a song anyway
and take her picture. Happy birthday, Mackenzie!
3:10 p.m.: We meet Elvis. He's passing out e√üay ticket stubs to passersby,
and he's happy to take a picture with us. He croons, "Viva Las Vegas." Not
the song, just that sentence, ad nauseum. None of our fellow pedestrians
seems surprised that the King is alive, well and hanging out in the Arts district.
But maybe his presence is not so incongruous in them here parts.
3:43 pan.: We head south, toward SFMOMA and the Metreon. As we
cross Market, we encounter a colorful character preaching. We don't catch
most of his sermon; we just hear, "No sloppy seconds!" and are struck by a
cold glare. We cross quickly.
3:49 pan.: Location: Metreon. While my group diligently sends one of our
RAs, an e-call from one of the computers there, I watch a music video for the
song "Chicken-head" alongside a riveted security guard. I was unfamiliar
with this particular piece, but what I glean from the video is that several scant
ily clad females, adorned with beauty-pageant sashes reading, "Miss Hoochie
Mama" and "Miss Gold Digger," are vying for the attention of one "Chick
en-head." Almost makes me yearn for my Visual Rhetoric class. Ah, the com
plexities of modern art. And we haven't even visited SFMOMA yet!
4:55 p.m.: We make it back to the meeting place, with five minutes to
spare! Our friends regale us with details of their own journeys. Answers
range from "The silver man kissed me, but it took him a really long time" to
"Yeah, I did the mooning thing" to "My only regret is that there's going to be
a picture of me in drag. I just hope nobody sees it."
5:10 p.m. My friend tells me that our friend David "got the most play" of
anyone in their group. An female stranger kissed him thrice. "And not short
kisses, either. They got longer and longer. No tongue, though." The obser
vation is made that he has never seemed happier in the two weeks and two
days we've been here. He adjusts his glasses and beams.
5:15 p.m. As predicted, Skip has carried his team. He streaked, licked and
stripped like a hero. His teammates' sole gripe is that he wore one girl's new
Victoria's Secret panties for much of the day, and may have ruined them.
5:18 p.m. Impossible task of the day seems to be to apply for a position as
a stripper. One girl tells me she was coldly rejected when she expressed inter
est; the manager at an establishment told her, "Just go." Another girl said,
"They wouldn't let us apply, but they'd let us strip." Everyone is disappoint
ed.

6:50 p.m. We've been together for scarcely two hours, and, already, the
rumor mill is churning. One particularly good story is how a Schiff guy was
chased out of a porn shop with a bat. The New Yorker who tells us this says,
"I'm from a big city. I know crazy people. But the people in San Francisco are
friggin' CRAZY." His eyes widen, and he shakes his head slowly back and
forth. "Friggin' crazy." The other freshmen nod sagely in agreement.

7:30 a.m.: Trying to avoid the
shower queue in Donner, I wake up
far too early. Falling back asleep on
my futon, I wake again to shouts and
door-pounding. The 30 freshmen on
my floor sleepily shuffle after the RA,
in one long straggly line, down to the
lounge.
8:30 a.m.: Our eyes widen as we
survey the list of scavenger-hunt mis
sions: 30 points will go to the Donner
ite willing to get it on in the San Fran
cisco zoo. We will garner extra points
for "creativity" (read: nudity).
"Remember, we are not responsi

black plastic mannequins in the Nike
superstore. Guess that's his friendly
way of exclaiming "Tag, you're it!"
just before yet another clerk tells us in
no uncertain terms to leave the build
ing.
One of the girls and I search for ex

try on a difficult feat since the fur
coats are virtually locked to their
hangers. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group accompanies one of the more
flamboyant guys to Macy's for a full
makeover.
10:15 a.m.: Missions accom
plished! Our rouged and lipsticked
male team member is positively radi

and he's happy to take a picture with us. He croons, "Viva Las Vegas." Not
the song, just that sentence, ad nauseum. None of our fellow pedestrians
seems surprised that the King is alive, well and hanging out in the Arts district.
But maybe his presence is not so incongruous in them here parts.
3:43 pan.: We head south, toward SFMOMA and the Metreon. As we
cross Market, we encounter a colorful character preaching. We don't catch
most of his sermon; we just hear, "No sloppy seconds!" and are struck by a
cold glare. We cross quickly.
3:49 pan.: Location: Metreon. While my group diligently sends one of our
RAs, an e-call from one of the computers there, I watch a music video for the
song "Chicken-head" alongside a riveted security guard. I was unfamiliar
with this particular piece, but what I glean from the video is that several scant
ily clad females, adorned with beauty-pageant sashes reading, "Miss Hoochie
Mama" and "Miss Gold Digger," are vying for the attention of one "Chick
en-head." Almost makes me yearn for my Visual Rhetoric class. Ah, the com
plexities of modern art. And we haven't even visited SFMOMA yet!
4:55 p.m.: We make it back to the meeting place, with five minutes to
spare! Our friends regale us with details of their own journeys. Answers
range from "The silver man kissed me, but it took him a really long time" to
"Yeah, I did the mooning thing" to "My only regret is that there's going to be
a picture of me in drag. I just hope nobody sees it."
5:10 p.m. My friend tells me that our friend David "got the most play" of
anyone in their group. An female stranger kissed him thrice. "And not short
kisses, either. They got longer and longer. No tongue, though." The obser
vation is made that he has never seemed happier in the two weeks and two
days we've been here. He adjusts his glasses and beams.
5:15 p.m. As predicted, Skip has carried his team. He streaked, licked and
stripped like a hero. His teammates' sole gripe is that he wore one girl's new
Victoria's Secret panties for much of the day, and may have ruined them.
5:18 p.m. Impossible task of the day seems to be to apply for a position as
a stripper. One girl tells me she was coldly rejected when she expressed inter
est; the manager at an establishment told her, "Just go." Another girl said,
"They wouldn't let us apply, but they'd let us strip." Everyone is disappoint
ed.

6:50 p.m. We've been together for scarcely two hours, and, already, the
rumor mill is churning. One particularly good story is how a Schiff guy was
chased out of a porn shop with a bat. The New Yorker who tells us this says,
"I'm from a big city. I know crazy people. But the people in San Francisco are
friggin' CRAZY." His eyes widen, and he shakes his head slowly back and
forth. "Friggin' crazy." The other freshmen nod sagely in agreement.

7:30 a.m.: Trying to avoid the
shower queue in Donner, I wake up
far too early. Falling back asleep on
my futon, I wake again to shouts and
door-pounding. The 30 freshmen on
my floor sleepily shuffle after the RA,
in one long straggly line, down to the
lounge.
8:30 a.m.: Our eyes widen as we
survey the list of scavenger-hunt mis
sions: 30 points will go to the Donner
ite willing to get it on in the San Fran
cisco zoo. We will garner extra points
for "creativity" (read: nudity).
"Remember, we are not responsi
ble if you are arrested," our HPAC
warns us for the fifth time in 15 min
utes.
9:10 a.m.: Who's willing to "ex
plore a Larkin dorm member in the
Exploratorium," as the list instructs?
Or to read dirty novels in the chil
dren's section of City Lights? On the
bus, team morale is high as our group
maps out a route through San Francis
co.
9:50 a.m.: We get off the bus at
Union Square; options abound. Our
first stop is Puma, where we poke
about, looking for the in-store DJ's
turntables. When a clerk ushers us out
of the store, cursing under his breath
the first of many employees to in
form us that under no grounds are we
allowed to take photos in their estab
lishments we walk on.
One of our team members steals a
kiss from a Larkin guy: one point.
Next up: the Virgin Megastore,
where I pretend to give birth next to
the classical CDs. A male team mem
ber kindly holds my hand through the
process.
10 a.m.: The quietest member of
our group gropes one of the faceless
black plastic mannequins in the Nike
superstore. Guess that's his friendly
way of exclaiming "Tag, you're it!"
just before yet another clerk tells us in
no uncertain terms to leave the build
ing.
One of the girls and I search for ex
pensive clothes in Neiman Marcus to
try on a difficult feat since the fur
coats are virtually locked to their
hangers. Meanwhile, the rest of the
group accompanies one of the more
flamboyant guys to Macy's for a full
makeover.
10:15 a.m.: Missions accom
plished! Our rouged and lipsticked
male team member is positively radi
ant. Flushed with victory, we infil
trate Victoria's Secret, only to en
counter some very irate salespeople.
I try to convince them to let Brian
enter the dressing room with me so
that I can take a photograph of him
trying on a pale pink push-up bra, but
to no avail.
10:25 a.m.: No go at Tiffany's. My
friend laments the failure: "A $lO,OOO
ring would have looked so good on
me, t00..."
10:30 a.m.: Snapped a pic of the
first fully naked frosh of the day.
10:40 a.m.: In true Stanford spirit,
we attack a 20-year-old wearing a Cal
baseball cap. I belt out "You've Lost
That Loving Feeling" to a puzzled
tourist. Rory poses at the Drake with
a cap supplied by an amiable bellhop.
Mackenzie leaps onto a cable car to
sing the Rice-A-Roni jingle.
11:30 a.m: Ghirardelli Square wel
comes our tired feet. Under the near
by Larkin Street sign, we and a group
of Larkinites nab the opportunity to

win three points for a Donner-Larkin
kiss. One of the guys from our group
succumbs to a peck from two Larkin
girls.
Noon: Ted dives into the fountain
at Ghirardelli Square, braving 60-de
gree temperatures and shrieks from
pre-teen onlookers.
The dorm scarfs down a gargantu
an "Vermonster" sundae at Ghi
rardelli's. Scoops of cookie dough,
mint chocolate chip and strawberry
cheesecake disappear in record time.
One of us challenges the Rhyme
Guy at the foot of the steps leading up
to the Square to a rhyme-off. He an
swers to the effect of, "What is a
rhyme-off? / Maybe you should take
some time off / To consider it mister /
And then buy me some pizza."
1:15 p.m.: We lose three of our
group members to an arcade with
Dance Dance Revolution and an
IMAX showing.
The rest of us bark at the sea lions,
protest wax use (um, yeah) at the wax
museum and yell "Cal Sucks" repeat
edly for points.
1:35 p.m.: Six of us spell "DON
NER" with our bodies in front of a
grassy lot near the pier. "Can't we
make the picture look dirtier?" one
guy pleads.
2:20 p.m.: Midway up a very steep
hill, two more girls decide to return to
Union Square for quality time at the
San Francisco Shopping Center. The
remaining five of us trudge onward.
2:25 p.m.: ... and onward.
2:35 p.m.: Dear God, will these
hills ever end?
2:37 p.m.: Inspired by the sight of
an orange traffic cone, Rory and Ted
strip and utilize the traffic cone in a
most amusing manner. Too bad only
one of them can wear the cone at a
time ...
3 p.m.: Sauntering toward the
Haight-Ashbury intersection, we en
counter more cardinal sweatshirts
than I saw during all of Admit Week
end. Students most of them from
Branner streak down Haight in
twos and threes sporadically. (Wait,
isn't that kid in my I-Hum section?)
The hippies seem to consider the
naked coed scene passe. "You Stan
ford students think you're hot shit,
doncha?" one stringy-haired burnout
calls to me.
4 p.m.: After visiting a few...
ahem ... specialty stores, we end up
at Mom's Tattoo and Piercing Parlor,
where Rory and a couple other Don
nerites bite the bullet for the sake of
their teams and end up looking really
badass. Until they beg us for Advil,
anyhow.
5 p.m.: Finally, dinner! We un
steadily navigate our way to
Tommy's Joynt, on the corner of
Van Ness Avenue. The people who
have been marked for life in the
piercing parlor are still giddy with
the euphoria of pain, it seems. We lo
cate the restaurant relatively quick
ly, but getting our food is a different
story. The loooong buffet line ex
tends in two directions. What's left
of our group scatters.
7 p.m.: Donner Group Three re
forms once again in Front of the
Opera House, among the RAs and
other groups. The evening is chilly,
but everyone forgets to moan about
the weather in favor of more pressing
matters: obsessing about how they
need to wash their hands and mar
veling at how well their respective
groups did.




Dorm scavenger hunts provide a plethora of photo opportunities. (From
top right, clockwise): The San Francisco treat: A ride on a cample car;
make-over madness; a man shows us his tattoo; Wright embraces a
stranger for a quick shot and she scores ... points for her team.

Its 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, but these freshmen aren't sleeping. Dorm scavenger hunts
in the city are a Stanford tradition on par with steam tunneling and Full Moon on the Quad.
What did they find this year? Two freshmen document their adventures.

Today is the only Saturday I'll be obligated to get up at the wee hour of
8:13 a.m. for a long, long time. I hope. My wonderful roommate awakens me
politely. She's already dressed, showered, brushed her teeth and packed a
sweater.
"Just checking to make sure you were up," she says. "We're meeting
downstairs in 27 minutes."
"Which means when?" I mumble, as I turn over in my oh-so-comfy bed.
8:51 a.m.: We get assigned to our groups (group 12 pride!) and are told that
it'll be 65 degree? in the city today. I'm not in a group with "Skip," my hall
mate, which means I'm already on a losing team. Ever since last night, when
I had come upon him clad solely in a neon orange Chippendale-esque
Speedo, I have known that Skip is the man to beat on the hunt today. I scan
my group for someone who looks like he'd be equally willing to strip to his
birthday suit, but come up short. We're all herded like cows onto large buses.
Skip moos.
10 a.m~* We step out of the bus and are handed the list of what we should
look for. One entry ambiguously urges us to "Hook up with a dormmate (and
when we say 'hook up,' we mean...)," leaving interpretation to the reader.
Group 12 holds an impromptu rendezvous at the nearest McDonald's. One
of the particularly gung-ho freshmen in our group scampers out of our booth
to make an announcement.
"Hello!" he says. "Is there any 7-year-old here we could" he consults
his hunt list "serenade? We're looking for things... we are on a scavenger
hunt..."
His voice gradually trails off. The few people in the store barely look up.
A family in the booth next to us continues feeding bacon to their baby in si
lence. TTiis task might require more finesse than we had originally anticipat
ed.
11:05 a.m.: One item on our list: "Stage a protest outside City Hall." Al
though I want it to be a "No on 54" protest, I am outvoted. "That would be
t00... real" says the glances directed at me.
Now the lone sophomore in our group takes it upon himself to rail against
the blah gray weather. Flinging his hands into the air, he shouts, "This weath
er is not to be tolerated!"
We accost a grizzly man passing by and ask him if he has any tattoos. He
does, and he consents to pose for us.
I realize that finding a drag queen for one of our tasks will be more diffi
cult: "Excuse me, are you a man in drag?"
What if the answer is no?
11:22 a.m.: We obtain a pack of flavored condoms, and five people lick one
for the camera. One frosh male assures us he'll save the rest for later. "That's
practical," nods another.
We continue down Market Street. As we pass a couple of homeless men,

one mumbles something unintelligible. Two girls grip each other and trot
quickly to safety at the front of the group, as one squeals, "I've never been hit
on by a homeless man before! Tee hee!"
11:39 aan.: A rosy-cheeked teenager mingles with us outside a public re
stroom, asking vacantly what is going on. "That's cool, that's cool," he says.
He strikes us as, ahem, not being in full possession of his faculties. Urging us
to take his picture, he pulls down his camouflage cut-offs for emphasis. "I'm
wearing tights!" The faint-of-heart among us keep their eyes averted.
11:43 a.m.: Otero makes a deal with us: We'll be the extra bodies they need
stuffed in the restroom with them ("Remember, partial nudity gets extra
points!"), and they'll spell out FROSOCO with us. The restroom, though
large, has not been properly aerated. Nevertheless, Otero somehow manages
to convince us that the FroSoCo set needs to crowd in the back so the Otero
folk can be seen in the photo. We eye a sign that reads, "Door automatically
opens after 20 minutes." After we exit the stall, I share a knowing glance with
an Oteroan as some innocent tourist walks in to use the facilities. Little does
the hapless man know what he is about to encounter...
11:50 a.in.: I volunteer to be temporarily handcuffed. Having a random
guy take multiple pictures of me was not part of the bargain, but it happened
anyway. Me: "Hey! Don't take pictures of me!" My desired response from
him: "Oh sorry, my bad. Would you like to destroy the film personally?" His
actual response: devious chuckling.
"Why are you posing for a picture if you don't want it on film?" some
one asks. My arresting officer says the photographer is affiliated with the
station he has come prepared. Visions of my picture on "Wanted"
signs and on future episode of "Cops" haunt me.
12:10 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret.
12:24 p.m.: Guys and girls are made over in Victoria's Secret make-up bou
tique. While there, we encounter another group of Stanford students. The
tallest guy is made up in pink. Lots of pink. He asks the workers for more lip
stick, and they happily oblige. While on the chair, his cell phone goes off.
"Oh, it's my girlfriend," he says, and then answers the phone." Hi, I'm get
ting lipstick put on right now. I'll call you back. Love you too."
He tells me later he's Donny, "the one from the paper," recently kicked
out of Roble. I ask to take a picture with him. "Am I your drag queen?" he
asks playfully.
1:10 p.m.: Eating Chinese food to the strains of R. Kelly's " I Believe I Can
Fly." Odd.
3:02 p.m.: Kicked out of Victoria's Secret. Again.
3:45 pan.: We're at the base of the cable car fine, where a long line of peo
ple wait rather than walk up two blocks to the next stop (something I'll never
understand... but I digress).
"Ladies and gentlemen. We have an announcement to make. We are stu
dents representing our college, and we would be most pleased if we could sing

someone 'Happy Birthday.' Is it anyone's birthday today?"
The crowd appears bemused. At long last, the little girl who we've seen
handing out "Free Personality Test!" pamphlets for hours says softly, "Yes,
me. It's my birthday."
One conscientious undergrad says, "Yeah, but if she doesn't have an ID
for proof, it's useless." Majority decision is made to sing to her a song anyway
and take her picture. Happy birthday, Mackenzie!
3:10 p.m.: We meet Elvis. He's passing out e√üay ticket stubs to passersby,
and he's happy to take a picture with us. He croons, "Viva Las Vegas." Not
the song, just that sentence, ad nauseum. None of our fellow pedestrians
seems surprised that the King is alive, well and hanging out in the Arts district.
But maybe his presence is not so incongruous in them here parts.
3:43 pan.: We head south, toward SFMOMA and the Metreon. As we
cross Market, we encounter a colorful character preaching. We don't catch
most of his sermon; we just hear, "No sloppy seconds!" and are struck by a
cold glare. We cross quickly.
3:49 pan.: Location: Metreon. While my group diligently sends one of our
RAs, an e-call from one of the computers there, I watch a music video for the
song "Chicken-head" alongside a riveted security guard. I was unfamiliar
with this particular piece, but what I glean from the video is that several scant
ily clad females, adorned with beauty-pageant sashes reading, "Miss Hoochie
Mama" and "Miss Gold Digger," are vying for the attention of one "Chick
en-head." Almost makes me yearn for my Visual Rhetoric class. Ah, the com
plexities of modern art. And we haven't even visited SFMOMA yet!
4:55 p.m.: We make it back to the meeting place, with five minutes to
spare! Our friends regale us with details of their own journeys. Answers
range from "The silver man kissed me, but it took him a really long time" to
"Yeah, I did the mooning thing" to "My only regret is that there's going to be
a picture of me in drag. I just hope nobody sees it."
5:10 p.m. My friend tells me that our friend David "got the most play" of
anyone in their group. An female stranger kissed him thrice. "And not short
