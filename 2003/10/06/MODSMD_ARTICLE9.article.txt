## Vote 'no' on gubernatorial recall 
### 
As California prepares for a special elec
tion tomorrow, each voter will need to
make an unprecedented choice in the
state's political history. Some have ar
gued that the recall provision of the state's constitu
tion properly puts power in the hands of the people,
while others have maintained that it undermines the
legitimacy of the gubernatorial election that was
held last November. We agree that the people of the
state should have some means of recourse if excep
tional circumstances arise that justify the recall of
the state's executive. However, we do not believe
that Gov. Gray Davis has committed any act that
merits his removal from office.

We acknowledge that Davis has not done the best
job of administering the state during the past five
years. In particular, by allowing state spending to ex
pand as revenues decreased resulting in budget
deficits —and by not revealing the full extent of the
anticipated shortfall to the public until after being re
elected, Davis slighted the people of California and
compromised the state's economic prospects.
However, many of California's current problems
are not solely attributable to Davis. While Califor
nia is in the midst of an economic downturn, the rest
of the country is in the same situation. And it is dif
ficult to discern precisely how much control Davis
truly had when handling controversies such as the
energy crisis that struck the state two years ago.
Although Davis has his flaws, recalling him is not
necessarily the correct way to remedy the situation.
The governor has not been charged of any felonies
or high crimes. Criticism of Davis has led to nothing
more than than criticism. We do not believe that a
governor should be recalled when there is merely
disagreement over his adopted policies.
The ability to recall a governor is a powerful and
possibly valuable tool available to Californians,
when employed in the proper manner. It provides
the people with a unique ability to hold their state
executive directly accountable to the same laws that
bind all citizens, and it allows the population at large
to take action if others will not.

But recalling Davis on subjective charges such as
"poor management" of the state would set a dan
gerous precedent for both California and the coun
try as a whole. State officials are elected to act in the
best interest of their constituents, and constantly
wielding the recall threat could seriously inhibit the
ability of politicians to become effective leaders and
negotiators.
A governor might not adopt a policy if he feared it
would incense the small minority of voters that is re
quired to initiate a recall election. We live in a politi
cal system based on majority rule, but the recall pro
vision risks putting the state's political future in the
hands of well-coordinated minority interest groups.
In an era of professional-signature gatherers, at
taining approval from registered voters totaling 12
percent of those who voted in the last gubernatorial
election is not the difficult feat as it may have been
92 years ago when the recall provision was first added
to the California state constitution. The process now
may unfairly favor those interests that can afford to
bankroll an expensive signature-collecting process.
Some claim that a recall election is needed to cor
rect an unfair election process last fall. We do not
agree. Despite low job-approval ratings during his
first term as governor, Davis was reelected last year
over Republican challenger Bill Simon. As an in
cumbent Democratic candidate running against a
right-wing conservative in a liberal-leaning state, the
victory in many ways could be viewed more as a re
jection of Simon than as a mandate for Davis. But a
recall election would not necessarily be any fairer;
with a field of 135 candidates on the ballot, it is more
likely that a candidate with a smaller plurality of the
vote would be elected than during any normal elec
tion process.
While Davis likely could have done a better job of
running the state during his tenure in office, his ac
tions do not warrant removal from office. Californi
ans should feel free to express their discontent with
Davis and his policies, but they should save extreme
measures such as recalls only as a last resort in situa
tions that offer no other alternative means of redress.
