# Campus voters cast ballots on recall, Proposition 54
## 
### ROBBIE YAN 
Many students are voting today in the Califor
nia recall election, which has been in the media
spotlight both in California and across the nation.
On the ballot, students will decide whether to re
call Gov. Gray Davis, which candidate to replace
him with if Davis is recalled and whether to sup
port Propositions 53 and 54.
Proposition 54, the subject of considerable
attention on campus, would prohibit the collec
tion of ethnic and racial data on the local and
state level. Proposition 53, which has been given
less media attention, would earmark funding
for local and state infrastructure projects.
According to the estimates of several on
campus political interest groups, a large num
ber of Stanford students are expected to cast
their ballots in today's election, although the
final outcome is still unpredictable.
An online survey conducted last week by
Stanford political scientists and Knowledge
Networks, a Menlo Park-based research firm,
showed that Republican candidate Arnold
Schwarzenegger has garnered considerable
support for the recall election.
The poll result found that 59 percent of the
956 sampled voters would vote to remove Davis
from office. Meanwhile, 43 percent of sampled
voters would choose Schwarzenegger to re
place Davis.
On campus, many high-profile activist
groups have taken a stance on the recall and
Proposition 54.
The Stanford Coalition Against Proposition
54, made up of several campus groups, has been
actively campaigning against the proposition, in
recent weeks.
Junior Hunter Hargraves, a member of the
coalition, said that if Proposition 54 is passed, it
would hinder the ability of Stanford scholars to
conduct their research.
"Proposition 54 places limitations on how
data sets and methods for collecting certain
kinds of data, which endangers that kind of aca
demic freedom," he said.
Some professors, though, said that Stan
ford's research is based more on data collected
at the national level and would therefore be less
affected than public universities by the results
of the election.
"Stanford's research budget is much more
sensitive to the national government," said
Communications Prof. Shanto Iyengar, one of
the professors who conducted the poll. "Cali
fornia doesn't figure very prominently."
Political Science Prof. Doug Rivers agreed.
"Stanford can continue doing what it's doing,"
he said.
The Stanford College Republicans have ex
pressed support for the recall, Schwarzenegger
and Proposition 54. Junior Joe Fairbanks, pres
ident of the College Republicans, said he ex

pects most of the in-state students he knows to
cast their votes. He is confident that Prop. 54
will pass.
"Depending on who becomes the governor,
if it's Schwarzenegger or McClintock, I'm con
fident the economy will get better," Fairbanks
said. "Stanford will have far more money to
spend on improvements on education. I'm con
fident an improved economy will help us bring
the money back in."
But the Green and Democrat organizations
on campus disagreed.
Junior Tim Telleen-Lawton, president of
the Greens at Stanford, predicted that there
would be an even split among the Stanford
Green-affiliated students with regard to the re
call itself. In choosing the candidate to replace
Gray Davis, however, Telleen-Lawton said
most would vote for Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante,
a Democrat. The Greens at Stanford's position
is for the recall and against Proposition 54.

against the recall and Proposition 54.
The ongoing effort to encourage
students to vote is expected to pay off in
the turnout rate at the ballot boxes.
Sophomore Alyssa Schwartz, chair
of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
Advocacy Committee, said that the
Committee has put forth its best effort
to "get out the vote" for the recall elec
tion. The organization distributed
voter registration forms to all upper
classman dorms, set up a table to reg
ister to vote at White Plaza two weeks
ago and organized a panel on Proposi
tion 54.
Still, some students say confusion
about the registration process prevent
ed them from signing up on time.
"Seeing as I live in California and
experience a lot that goes down here, I

now realize the importance on voting,
and I really wanted to participate in
this reelection," said sophomore Ju
lian Pena. "However I didn't register
in time; the deadline was not made
clear tome."
Many students and campus work
ers expressed opposition to the recall
and Proposition 54.
"I'm going to vote no on the recall
because I don't think Gray Davis did a
bad job," said junior Jeff Conkey. "I
think he was just blamed for a lot of
things."
Fausto Guerrero, a Mexican immi
grant who has worked at Stanford
Dining for 28 years, expressed distrust
of Schwarzenegger.
"I don't like Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger," he said. "I don't think he can take
care of California. He's a racist, talks
bad about minorities, women. He's too
cocky. He just has money, that's it."
