# AXESS OF EVIL?
## Despite some students' frustrations, Axess serves as the computing backbone of the University. But the program was new to Stanford when the Class of '04 were freshmen. The Daily takes a look at the software that makes Stanford work. 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
It knows where you live, where you go to class, how much money you owe ... it even
knows about that C-minus in Stat 60. Is it the Russian mafia? No, it's even more devious.
It's Axess, Stanford's most powerful administrative tool.
From class enrollment to transcripts, from financial aid to major declarations, is there

anything it can't do? Without Axess,
Stanford students would not be able to
sign up for classes, apply for housing or
even graduate. Just to provide a taste
of what life was like before this Death
Star of a Web site came on-line, alum
nus and Residential Computing em
ployee Ethan Rikleen recounts his
Axess-free undergrad years.
"When I was a student we used to
wait in fine at Old Union to turn in our
paper study fists with our adviser's sig
nature," he remembered. "On the days
they were due the line would some
times reach the Claw.
"We used to do the housing draw by
showing up with our draw group's fist
on paper, reaching into a bin and
pulling out a little envelope the size of
a business card," Rikleen continued in
the tone of an urban legend. "That was
actually pretty fun. I think I still have
my old draw cards somewhere."
Since then, many of the services
that were handled separately, such as
phone bills and transcript requests,
have been rolled into one. Axess took
flight in 2000 when the University
adopted software created by Bay
Area-based People Soft. The same
company supports software used for
personnel and student information
systems at 400 colleges and universi
ties nationwide.

"The former system that supported
admissions, financial aid, the bursar's
and the registrar's offices was outdat
ed," said University Registrar Roger
Printup. "I doubt any Stanford student
is playing the original version of Pac-
Man on their computers. Similarly, of
fices like mine cannot afford to use
software that was designed in the early
1980s, which is when the old system
was designed."
While Axess has become a major
part of the Stanford experience, stu
dents are divided in their opinions of
the red-and-yellow Web site that con
trols their hopes and dreams.
"I hear some complaints about the
clunky interface," said graduate stu
dent Jason Anderson, a Residential
Computer Consultant at Crothers
Memorial. "Like having to click about
four links just to get an unofficial tran
script— it treats you like an idiot.
'Click here to receive transcript. Are
you sure? Click here to get completed
transcript. Are you still sure?' "
He also points out that Axess
doesn't allow students to pick up their
transcripts in person. Instead they are
mailed to post office boxes, not even a
stone's throw away from Old Union. .
While the system can seem frustrat
ing and illogical at times, Anderson
said Axess offers a lot of services that
students couldn't even have conceived
of several years ago, including the abil
ity to shop for classes online and view

financial aid awards or tuition bills (as painful as they may be).
Aside from class enrollment, students flood Axess when applying for Draw numbers.
Much like hunting season, housing season prompts many a Stanford student to rifle
through their collection of friends and acquaintances and zone in on the people they think
will most likely tolerate them and their whistling belly button trick for the next nine

months. During this time, Axess becomes an essential tool with the power to make or
break an entire academic year. Although Axess is the interface through which students
learn their fateful assignment, University officials say that Axess itself is not responsible
for any draw complications.
"From our perspective, the Draw ran smoother last year than it has in previous years,"
said Todd Benson, the director of Housing Assignment Services. "It's true that every year
some Draw groups get split up even if they do everything they can to stay together.

"It's important to note that the
split groups had nothing to do with
Axess," he continued. "It is just
the system that collects students'
application information. The
Draw is a computer program that
uses this information submitted
via Axess to assign housing."
Every year there are inevitably
students who forget to apply for
housing on the Web site, at risk of
losing their guaranteed housing
for the next year. Who needs shel
ter anyway? It's not like Stanford
students ever sleep, and hey, there
are couches in Meyer Library,
right?

Luckily, this year with the re
opening of Branner, there is plen
ty of available housing for students
who happened to miss the applica
tion deadline and who attend the
walk-on housing meetings held
daily during the first five weeks of
each quarter, said Benson.
"There has never been a prob
lem that has directly influenced
students' housing assignments,"
said Benson, briefly mentioning a
minor crisis in the spring of 2002
.when-the Axess site shut down on
the night of the draw due to high
traffic. "We extended the Axess
deadline so that students could
still apply online, but Housing As
signment Services staff ended up
entering many applications that
were e-mailed to us into the sys
tem by hand."
While advisors and students
alike say that Axess is pretty easy
to learn and use, many forget what
a quandary the system must pre
sent to the newest members of the
Stanford family. Already intimi
dated by genius upperclassmen,
crazy bicyclists and Wilbur's cattle
call showers, freshmen are practi
cally abandoned to navigate the
system on their own.
"I think there should be a tuto
rial to help freshmen understand
exactly how the system works,"
said sophomore Laura Surma, still
traumatized by her first experi
ence with Axess. "Last year I
wanted to enroll in bioethics, but
little did I realize that I could take
it for one or two units. I ended up
having to drop the one unit class in
order to take it for two units. Keep
in mind I didn't know that an early
dropped class wouldn't count and
I was really worried it would show
up on my transcript."
Other students have run into
similar glitches, and even find
themselves confused when trying
to explain exactly what went
wrong.

While Stanford's tendency to
continually update software likely means the Axess we have all come to know and love
will someday be replaced, it has become a symbol of this generation's Stanford experi
ence. Students can sleep in peace as time schedules and dining plans dance in their
dreams knowing that Axess is looking out for them, at least between the hours of 6
a.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. and 2 a.m. on weekends.

traffic. "We extended the Axess
deadline so that students could
still apply online, but Housing As
signment Services staff ended up
entering many applications that
were e-mailed to us into the sys
tem by hand."
While advisors and students
alike say that Axess is pretty easy
to learn and use, many forget what
a quandary the system must pre
sent to the newest members of the
Stanford family. Already intimi
dated by genius upperclassmen,
crazy bicyclists and Wilbur's cattle
call showers, freshmen are practi
cally abandoned to navigate the
system on their own.
"I think there should be a tuto
rial to help freshmen understand
exactly how the system works,"
said sophomore Laura Surma, still
traumatized by her first experi
ence with Axess. "Last year I
wanted to enroll in bioethics, but
little did I realize that I could take
it for one or two units. I ended up
having to drop the one unit class in
order to take it for two units. Keep
in mind I didn't know that an early
dropped class wouldn't count and
I was really worried it would show
up on my transcript."
Other students have run into
similar glitches, and even find
themselves confused when trying
to explain exactly what went
wrong.

While Stanford's tendency to
continually update software likely means the Axess we have all come to know and love
will someday be replaced, it has become a symbol of this generation's Stanford experi
ence. Students can sleep in peace as time schedules and dining plans dance in their
dreams knowing that Axess is looking out for them, at least between the hours of 6
a.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. and 2 a.m. on weekends.

It knows where you live, where you go to class, how much money you owe ... it even
knows about that C-minus in Stat 60. Is it the Russian mafia? No, it's even more devious.
It's Axess, Stanford's most powerful administrative tool.
From class enrollment to transcripts, from financial aid to major declarations, is there

anything it can't do? Without Axess,
Stanford students would not be able to
sign up for classes, apply for housing or
even graduate. Just to provide a taste
of what life was like before this Death
Star of a Web site came on-line, alum
nus and Residential Computing em
ployee Ethan Rikleen recounts his
Axess-free undergrad years.
"When I was a student we used to
wait in fine at Old Union to turn in our
paper study fists with our adviser's sig
nature," he remembered. "On the days
they were due the line would some
times reach the Claw.
"We used to do the housing draw by
showing up with our draw group's fist
on paper, reaching into a bin and
pulling out a little envelope the size of
a business card," Rikleen continued in
the tone of an urban legend. "That was
actually pretty fun. I think I still have
my old draw cards somewhere."
Since then, many of the services
that were handled separately, such as
phone bills and transcript requests,
have been rolled into one. Axess took
flight in 2000 when the University
adopted software created by Bay
Area-based People Soft. The same
company supports software used for
personnel and student information
systems at 400 colleges and universi
ties nationwide.

"The former system that supported
admissions, financial aid, the bursar's
and the registrar's offices was outdat
ed," said University Registrar Roger
Printup. "I doubt any Stanford student
is playing the original version of Pac-
Man on their computers. Similarly, of
fices like mine cannot afford to use
software that was designed in the early
1980s, which is when the old system
was designed."
While Axess has become a major
part of the Stanford experience, stu
dents are divided in their opinions of
the red-and-yellow Web site that con
trols their hopes and dreams.
"I hear some complaints about the
clunky interface," said graduate stu
dent Jason Anderson, a Residential
Computer Consultant at Crothers
Memorial. "Like having to click about
four links just to get an unofficial tran
script— it treats you like an idiot.
'Click here to receive transcript. Are
you sure? Click here to get completed
transcript. Are you still sure?' "
He also points out that Axess
doesn't allow students to pick up their
transcripts in person. Instead they are
mailed to post office boxes, not even a
stone's throw away from Old Union. .
While the system can seem frustrat
ing and illogical at times, Anderson
said Axess offers a lot of services that
students couldn't even have conceived
of several years ago, including the abil
ity to shop for classes online and view

financial aid awards or tuition bills (as painful as they may be).
Aside from class enrollment, students flood Axess when applying for Draw numbers.
Much like hunting season, housing season prompts many a Stanford student to rifle
through their collection of friends and acquaintances and zone in on the people they think
will most likely tolerate them and their whistling belly button trick for the next nine

months. During this time, Axess becomes an essential tool with the power to make or
break an entire academic year. Although Axess is the interface through which students
learn their fateful assignment, University officials say that Axess itself is not responsible
for any draw complications.
"From our perspective, the Draw ran smoother last year than it has in previous years,"
said Todd Benson, the director of Housing Assignment Services. "It's true that every year
some Draw groups get split up even if they do everything they can to stay together.

"It's important to note that the
split groups had nothing to do with
Axess," he continued. "It is just
the system that collects students'
application information. The
Draw is a computer program that
uses this information submitted
via Axess to assign housing."
Every year there are inevitably
students who forget to apply for
housing on the Web site, at risk of
losing their guaranteed housing
for the next year. Who needs shel
ter anyway? It's not like Stanford
students ever sleep, and hey, there
are couches in Meyer Library,
right?

Luckily, this year with the re
opening of Branner, there is plen
ty of available housing for students
who happened to miss the applica
tion deadline and who attend the
walk-on housing meetings held
daily during the first five weeks of
each quarter, said Benson.
"There has never been a prob
lem that has directly influenced
students' housing assignments,"
said Benson, briefly mentioning a
minor crisis in the spring of 2002
.when-the Axess site shut down on
the night of the draw due to high
traffic. "We extended the Axess
deadline so that students could
still apply online, but Housing As
signment Services staff ended up
