# Answer Girl dishes out the truth about colorblindness
## 
### BONITA SONG ANSWER GIRL 
Q Answer Girl, I went on a scavenger hunt
this weekend, but I didn't want to get
naked for those bonus points. But I had an
idea. My Resident Assistant says he's
color-blind, so I took a bunch of pictures in skin-tight
spandex, since the only real difference you can see is the
hot pink on my body in the pictures. Somehow he caught
me, so not only did I not win, but now there are pictures all
over the dorm with me wearing hot pink spandex. Was he
full of shit when he said he was color blind, or is there
something I'm not getting here?
A Man. There's so many things I'd like to
• say about this. But the funny thing is that
none of them have anything to do with
• colorblindness. At any rate, I digress.
Well sonny, to answer your question: Unless he's actu

ally completely blind, and can't see at all, he should still
be able to distinguish hot pink spandex from skin.
And no, he's not blind. Trust me on this.
You see, almost all people with color blindness

which means about 1 in 12 males and
1 in 300 women can still see some
colors. And in this case, what's more
important is that most can tell the dif
ference between bright and dull col
ors.
That is, even if your RA can't tell
the difference between bright green
and bright red which might be the
case if he has red-green colorblind
ness I bet he'd be able to tell be
tween bright green and pale green.
In other words, if you're a pasty

white boy which I'm assuming is probably true he'd
still notice the color difference between your scrawny
melanin-deficient neck and your blazing Richard Sim

mons arse. It's just that the spandex might look to him
something like what people usually call blue, or in a rarer
case, he might see grey; it just depends on what kind of
colorblindness he has.
You probably should have gone for something a little
less flamboyant. Next time since I see more of this in
your future think Carlton Banks, not Jane Fonda. You
see, even just a lighter pink might have done the trick.
That is, I guess, if he was also willing to believe you
shaved your back hair.
Overall, young man, colorblindness doesn't usually af
fect a person's life all that much. For most, it's just that
they see a different set of colors like seeing things un
derwater, only a bit more severe.
But hey, it wasn't all a waste. I'm guessing this was the
very first time anyone's ever associated you with the word
"bright." And there's something to be said for that.
