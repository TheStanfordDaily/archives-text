# Bustamante is best alternative
## 
### 
All California voters, no matter how they
mark their ballots on whether or not to
recall Gov. Gray Davis today, have the
option of voting for his potential re
placement. Voters must take this responsibility se
riously. With 135 candidates on the ballot, this may
seem a daunting and difficult task, especially when
considering that the names aren't even listed in al
phabetical order. However, each vote counts, and
the decision as to who should lead California is one
that comes with many implications for both the
state and its residents.
With all the candidates running for governor, it's
impossible to locate a standout everyone can sup
port. But when considering the state's best inter
ests, we believe Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is the
most qualified candidate to succeed Davis if he is
recalled. Although Bustamante has not played a
prominent role formulating state policy, he was
voted in during the cyclical election process last fall
along with Davis, and amid a field of non-politicos
running to replace the current governor, he has in
valuable experience in the political and public
spheres that cannot be overlooked. Before becom
ing lieutenant governor, Bustamante served in the
state legislature as an assemblyman and then be
came the state's first Latino speaker of the assem
bly. These credentials make Bustamante the most
desirable alternative to Davis.
This recall election puts Bustamante in a tough

position: He both works for the governor and is
in at least one sense trying to take over Davis's
job. Campaigning diplomatically has certainly been
a challenge for Bustamante, despite his reportedly
antagonistic relationship with Davis. Yet Busta
mante has distinguished himself from the other
candidates, both by his composure throughout the
recall circus and his knowledge of the state of Cali
fornia and where it should be headed.
Bustamante has not jumped into the recall elec
tion from another field simply to give politics a try.
He is not running because of the novelty of the race
or to get a spot in the limelight of what has been
called a "political free-for-all." He is trying to main
tain legitimacy in Sacramento and keep his political
party in control should Davis be ousted. In short,
he's doing what any serious and dedicated politi
cian would do.
Unlike most other candidates, Bustamante will
be able to hit the ground running if and when he
takes office he won't have to learn the ins and
outs of the system before making any substantive
decisions and needed changes. And at a time when
California's economy is said to be falling apart, a
new governor will need as much time as possible to
repair the wounds of our state.
So even if voters think the second part of the re
call question is nothing more than a choice among
the lesser of 135 evils, given the alternatives, elect
ing Bustamante is the best choice for California.
