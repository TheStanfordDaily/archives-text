# Props. 53 and 54 should not pass
## 
### 
While the recall election may be fore
most in most voters' minds when they
journey to the polls today, there are
two other issues on the ballot that Cal
ifornians must decide: Propositions 53 and 54.
Prop. 53, which aims to rebuild the state's infras
tructure via the general fund, has received the least
amount of attention that has been split between the
recall and Prop. 54. If passed, Prop. 53 would amend
the state constitution and place up to three percent of
the state budget into an infrastructure investment
fund, which would maintain and build state public
works such as highways, parks, canals, trails, reser
voirs, state prisons, office buildings and pipelines.
While we endorse proper expenditures on capital
projects, money has been budgeted towards these
endeavors in the past. Supporting this proposition
would only create more inflexibility at a time where
our state budget should be as flexible as possible. The
state must now amend the damage accumulated over
several years, and by allocating funds for these spe
cific projects, it would only create more regulations.
It also may take away more money from the state's
general fund of which only 30 percent is now
available for discretionary spending.
We also urge voters to vote "no" on Prop. 54. If

passed, it would ban state and local
from collecting racial data. Supporters of the proposi
tion argue that it would create a colorblind society by
eliminating forms and surveys that ask people to indi
cate their race or nationality. We believe this is an
oversimplification of a very complex reality.
Recently, opponents of the proposition have
amassed an increasing amount of support, including
Rev. Jesse Jackson, actor Danny Glover and the Cal
ifornia Teacher's Association. Additionally, Gov.
Gray Davis and recall gubernatorial candidates Cruz
Bustamante, Peter Camejo and Arnold
Schwarzenegger have all spoken out against Prop. 54.
If Prop. 54 passes, it could produce harmful effects
for education and healthcare because it would elimi
nate data used to identify important trends in these
areas. The proposition proposes to ban the collection
of racial data, except in cases of medical research, fed
eral requirements, various law enforcement functions
and in investigating housing and employment com
plaints. But it's unclear how the proposition would af
fect other areas if passed. We urge voters to vote "no"
on this proposition, as it would bring wide-sweeping
changes to agencies across the state and there is little
evidence to demonstrate that the harm in ceasing to
collect racial data would not outweigh the benefits of
this information.
