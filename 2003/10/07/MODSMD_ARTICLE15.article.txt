## BLOWING INTO TOWN Recall election: extreme democracy 
### 
As you read this, millions of
your fellow Californians
are waiting patiently in
line at their neighbor
hood polling place, participating in
an exercise of extreme democracy.
Maybe if you are from California,
the idea of firing an elected official
just 11 months after 60 percent of the
state didn't even bother to vote for or
against him doesn't seem so strange.
Well, I'm not from this state. I'm
from Virginia, where we patiently
tolerate bad leaders until the next
election, unless, of course, something
egregious happens. But even when
Yorktown's sheriff was accused of
sexual misconduct, we waited until
his re-election to send him packing.

Not that I think the recall is a bad
idea. In fact, as the entire nation has
tuned in to California politics,
watching the debates and learning
about some of the antics that
prompted the recall action in the
first place, I hope elected officials
everywhere are watching ... and
feeling very scared and very ac
countable for their actions.
Whether or not you agree with
the recall, or have found a candidate
to your liking among the muscled
and moneyed choices out there, this
action has brought life to the in
creasingly apathetic California vot
ing populace and somehow sparked
national interest in a state election.
First, let's look at how we got
here. The recall wasn't a Republican
Party machination, though Republi
can money did finance the bulk of
the 1.3 million signatures gathered.
A small-fry anti-tax activist, Edward
"Ted" Costa came up with the idea
to recall Democratic Governor
Gray Davis over Saturday morning

breakfast just a
month after Davis
took office. Re
publican Party
leadership
thought a recall ef
fort would be as
unsuccessful as
the last 31 at
tempts to oust a
governor. Addi
tionally, the party

wanted a wounded governor to be ii
office come 2004, believing that i
would help President Bush secure
the bounty of California's electorate
votes in his 2004 re-election bid. Ah
party politics always seeking tc
protect the people's interests.
Since, going by the numbers
most of you didn't vote or probabl)
care last November, I'll recap: Davis
won his re-election bid in an under
whelming victory against an ever
less desirable Republican opponent.
Bill Simon Jr.
But voters didn't have all the in
formation. During the election, the
obviously troubled economy was
massaged a bit to Davis's benefit.
Voters believed California was look
ing at an $8 billion shortfall. A few
weeks after the election, that figure
was amended to $36 billion. Oops.
It's not clear why the numbers
were off, but what is clear is that
Davis bungled a couple of pretty big
issues. The energy crisis is tough
it would be hard for any elected offi
cial to successfully navigate that
kind of problem. But Davis's mis
take in locking California into some
pretty silly energy contracts will cost
taxpayers $6 billion or more. Think
of the potholes $6 billion could fill,
or the education needs that could be

met, or simply the cash that could be
back in your pockets.
And then taxpayers can't blame
Davis for all of the budget woes.
Times are tough all over and the tech
industry bust was bound to cut all
kinds of public spending. But the ur
gent needs of the state should have
been apparent to the governor be
fore Standard & Poor's downgraded
California's bonds to junk status.
If California were a private compa
ny, someone's head would have rolled
for these blunders. Maybe California,
as fruity and flighty as the rest of the
county sees it, is onto something: run
states and cities like companies.
Yes, Costa has affiliations with
Libertarians and Republicans. And
Rep. Darrell Issa's (R-Vista) $1.7
million sure did help gather signa
tures. But all kinds of Californians
signed the petitions and hopefully all
kinds of Californians are in booths
right now, voting their conscience.
The bottom line is that Costa's
breakfast epiphany has created ex
citement and an overdue concern in
the national media for the affairs of
the Golden State. I hope Arnold
Schwarzenegger's candidacy isn't the
primary reason for all of the interest,
though I'm sure it accounts for some.
Even if it is, and even if only a handful
of people learned the meaning of "fis
cal responsibility" or "gubernatori
al," then Costa's efforts and all of
the 1.3 million people who signed on
to his idea weren't in vain.
Thanks, Ted, for making politics
as-usual very unusual and exciting
indeed, if only for a few months.

Since, going by the numbers
most of you didn't vote or probabl)
care last November, I'll recap: Davis
won his re-election bid in an under
whelming victory against an ever
less desirable Republican opponent.
Bill Simon Jr.
But voters didn't have all the in
formation. During the election, the
obviously troubled economy was
massaged a bit to Davis's benefit.
Voters believed California was look
ing at an $8 billion shortfall. A few
weeks after the election, that figure
was amended to $36 billion. Oops.
It's not clear why the numbers
were off, but what is clear is that
Davis bungled a couple of pretty big
issues. The energy crisis is tough
it would be hard for any elected offi
cial to successfully navigate that
kind of problem. But Davis's mis
take in locking California into some
pretty silly energy contracts will cost
taxpayers $6 billion or more. Think
of the potholes $6 billion could fill,
or the education needs that could be

met, or simply the cash that could be
back in your pockets.
And then taxpayers can't blame
Davis for all of the budget woes.
Times are tough all over and the tech
industry bust was bound to cut all
kinds of public spending. But the ur
gent needs of the state should have
been apparent to the governor be
fore Standard & Poor's downgraded
California's bonds to junk status.
If California were a private compa
ny, someone's head would have rolled
for these blunders. Maybe California,
as fruity and flighty as the rest of the
county sees it, is onto something: run
states and cities like companies.
Yes, Costa has affiliations with
Libertarians and Republicans. And
Rep. Darrell Issa's (R-Vista) $1.7
million sure did help gather signa
tures. But all kinds of Californians
signed the petitions and hopefully all
kinds of Californians are in booths
right now, voting their conscience.
The bottom line is that Costa's
breakfast epiphany has created ex
citement and an overdue concern in
the national media for the affairs of
the Golden State. I hope Arnold
Schwarzenegger's candidacy isn't the
primary reason for all of the interest,
though I'm sure it accounts for some.
Even if it is, and even if only a handful
of people learned the meaning of "fis
cal responsibility" or "gubernatori
al," then Costa's efforts and all of
the 1.3 million people who signed on
to his idea weren't in vain.
Thanks, Ted, for making politics
as-usual very unusual and exciting
indeed, if only for a few months.
