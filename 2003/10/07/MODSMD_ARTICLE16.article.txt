Multiracial Identified Community
at Stanford against Prop. 54
In light of the recent debate over Proposition 54,1 feel it is
necessary to express my concern that multiracial identity has
been misappropriated in support of Ward Connerly's infor
mation ban. Connerly has often espoused that the existence
of multiracial people demonstrates that racial categorization
and the one-drop rule are outdated. Furthermore, he appeals
to the sympathies of multiracial individuals and families,
claiming that multiracial individuals should not be forced to
check boxes. While the dilemma over which box to check is
common to multiracial people, it is in no way a justification to
be rid of boxes and data collection entirely. Prop. 54 may dis
proportionately impact people of color, and while the race or
identity of many multiracial people may be debated, many, if
not all, continue to identify as people of color. The one-drop
rule may have origins in a structure that is no longer in place,
yet it is a historical legacy that we continue to live with, and is
very much relevant in each of our lives.

Consequently, a failure to collect racial data will nega
tively affect all multiracial people. The Multiracial Identi
fied Community at Stanford (MICS) is part of the Coalition
to Stop Prop. 54. Please vote no on Prop. 54 today.

Yom Kippur a "solemn day"
Your headline on Friday ("Students prepare to cele
brate Yom Kippur," Oct. 3) reveals a deep ignorance of the
Jewish tradition on the part of The Daily. Yom Kippur, the
holiest day of the Jewish calendar, is a solemn day of re
pentance and introspection. Many Jews spend the holiday
fasting and in prayer. One would not "celebrate" Yom Kip
pur any more than one would "celebrate" Good Friday.
