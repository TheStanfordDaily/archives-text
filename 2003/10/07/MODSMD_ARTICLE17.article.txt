## Coalition urges 'no' on Prop. 54 
### STANFORD COALITION AGAINST PROP. 54 
Today, California voters face a
choice. We can choose to affirm our
rich diversity and commitment to elim
inating racial injustice, or we can pre
tend that we live in a truly colorblind so
ciety and prove to ourselves and the
world that we simply do not care
about race. When you pare arguments
both for and against Prop. 54 down to
this choice, suddenly the danger to Cal
ifornian society becomes clear.
The proposition, according to its
supporters, would prohibit "state
and local governments from using
race, ethnicity, color or national ori
gin to classify current or prospective
students, contractors, or employees
in public education, contracting or
employment operations," in addi
tion to banning the collection of
racial data in other sectors such as
health care, medicine, and law en
forcement (from http://www.racial
privacy. orgAanguage.htm).

What does this mean for Califor
nia? For starters, crucial data in educa
tion — such as how different racial
groups excel at reading, writing, and
arithmetic, graduate from high school,
and progress on tests and programs
such as the California Public School
Accountability Program would be
lost. Prop. 54 would undermine efforts
to disseminate information about dis
ease prevention and health education
among communities that need it the
most. It would destroy affirmative ac
tion programs in public colleges and
universities, the same programs that
the Supreme Court recently affirmed
as constitutionally legal a few months
ago. And it would constrict the state's
efforts to track and fight racial profil
ing in law enforcement and employ
ment discrimination. In fact, it would

make racial and ethnic discrimination
easier to commit but harder to identi
fy and substantiate.
While the proposition negatively
affects the more public arenas of Cali
fornia life, it also endangers the private
Stanford community by limiting the
scope and depth of any research pro
duced here. Most Stanford professors,
researchers and students in the social
sciences will tell you that they rely on
data from the state of California for
their research, and that much of that
data involves race. Departments and
programs such as Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity (the University's
fastest growing major), Human Biolo
gy, Political Science, Sociology, Psy
chology and the schools of Medicine,
Education and Law deal with this data
and conduct research that involves
looking at how we integrate race into
our daily lives. That's why Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine, wrote
a letter to the editor of the San Jose
Mercury News, claiming that "[Propo
sition 54] would do harm to the very
people it aims to protect." It's also why
26 professors, from departments in
cluding Linguistics, History, and Cul
tural and Social Anthropology, and
Deborah Stipek, dean of the School of
Education, have endorsed our coali
tion's actions to defeat Prop. 54 on the
Stanford campus.
Supporters point to Prop. 54's ex
emptions, claiming that they would
permit most data collection in medical
and law enforcement fields. Yet the
exemptions have ambiguous lan
guage, language that most legal schol
ars agree will be interpreted by the
courts if Prop. 54 passes. We simply do
not know how long this analysis by the
courts will take nor should we run the
risk of how broadly or narrowly the
courts will interpret Prop. 54.
Supporters also claim that, exemp

tions aside, Prop. 54 is a "symbolic
measure," proclaiming California to
be a Utopia where race does not exist.
We have no doubt that Ward Conner
ly, the proposition's author, will peddle
this initiative to Washington, Texas
and Florida, just like he did following
the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996.
Nor do we doubt that one day he will
introduce a bill in Congress eliminating
the use of racial categories in federal
departments such as the Census and
national programs in education and
health care. And this perhaps is Prop.
54's biggest hazard to society: It claims
we are in a place we obviously are not.
Because disparities still exist between
white students and Latino students in
elementary schools, because people of
color continue to be pulled over by the
police and murdered at higher rates
than white people, because diseases
such as tuberculosis and AIDS still af
flict black communities at much higher
rates than white communities, race and
the research necessary to track, ana
lyze and eradicate these disparities still
matter.

The Stanford Coalition Against
Prop. 54, a coalition comprised of over
20 student groups, knows this. What
we don't know, however, is the place of
race in a state that refuses to acknowl
edge its importance. And we certainly
do not know just exactly what Prop.
54's effect on eliminating the collection
of racial data will be; these are deci
sions and effects that will require addi
tional time and interpretation. So join
us in rejecting what we do not know
and tackling instead what we do know:
The barriers people of color face every
day. Vote "no" on Proposition 54
today.

forcement (from http://www.racial
privacy. orgAanguage.htm).

What does this mean for Califor
nia? For starters, crucial data in educa
tion — such as how different racial
groups excel at reading, writing, and
arithmetic, graduate from high school,
and progress on tests and programs
such as the California Public School
Accountability Program would be
lost. Prop. 54 would undermine efforts
to disseminate information about dis
ease prevention and health education
among communities that need it the
most. It would destroy affirmative ac
tion programs in public colleges and
universities, the same programs that
the Supreme Court recently affirmed
as constitutionally legal a few months
ago. And it would constrict the state's
efforts to track and fight racial profil
ing in law enforcement and employ
ment discrimination. In fact, it would

make racial and ethnic discrimination
easier to commit but harder to identi
fy and substantiate.
While the proposition negatively
affects the more public arenas of Cali
fornia life, it also endangers the private
Stanford community by limiting the
scope and depth of any research pro
duced here. Most Stanford professors,
researchers and students in the social
sciences will tell you that they rely on
data from the state of California for
their research, and that much of that
data involves race. Departments and
programs such as Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity (the University's
fastest growing major), Human Biolo
gy, Political Science, Sociology, Psy
chology and the schools of Medicine,
Education and Law deal with this data
and conduct research that involves
looking at how we integrate race into
our daily lives. That's why Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine, wrote
a letter to the editor of the San Jose
Mercury News, claiming that "[Propo
sition 54] would do harm to the very
people it aims to protect." It's also why
26 professors, from departments in
cluding Linguistics, History, and Cul
tural and Social Anthropology, and
Deborah Stipek, dean of the School of
Education, have endorsed our coali
tion's actions to defeat Prop. 54 on the
Stanford campus.
Supporters point to Prop. 54's ex
emptions, claiming that they would
permit most data collection in medical
and law enforcement fields. Yet the
exemptions have ambiguous lan
guage, language that most legal schol
ars agree will be interpreted by the
courts if Prop. 54 passes. We simply do
not know how long this analysis by the
courts will take nor should we run the
risk of how broadly or narrowly the
courts will interpret Prop. 54.
Supporters also claim that, exemp

tions aside, Prop. 54 is a "symbolic
measure," proclaiming California to
be a Utopia where race does not exist.
We have no doubt that Ward Conner
ly, the proposition's author, will peddle
this initiative to Washington, Texas
and Florida, just like he did following
the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996.
Nor do we doubt that one day he will
introduce a bill in Congress eliminating
the use of racial categories in federal
departments such as the Census and
national programs in education and
health care. And this perhaps is Prop.
54's biggest hazard to society: It claims
we are in a place we obviously are not.
Because disparities still exist between
white students and Latino students in
elementary schools, because people of
color continue to be pulled over by the
police and murdered at higher rates
than white people, because diseases
such as tuberculosis and AIDS still af
flict black communities at much higher
rates than white communities, race and
the research necessary to track, ana
lyze and eradicate these disparities still
matter.

The Stanford Coalition Against
Prop. 54, a coalition comprised of over
20 student groups, knows this. What
we don't know, however, is the place of
race in a state that refuses to acknowl
edge its importance. And we certainly
do not know just exactly what Prop.
54's effect on eliminating the collection
of racial data will be; these are deci
sions and effects that will require addi
tional time and interpretation. So join
us in rejecting what we do not know
and tackling instead what we do know:
The barriers people of color face every
day. Vote "no" on Proposition 54
today.
