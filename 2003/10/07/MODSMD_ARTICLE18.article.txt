## 54's impact on health 
### BARBARA KOENIG 
Last week the Center for Biomedical
Ethics co-sponsored a conference at
Stanford called "Colorblind Racism?
The Politics of Controlling Racial and
Ethnic Data." The goal of the meeting
was to examine the impact of Proposi
tion 54 on social justice in California, fo
cusing on education, health care, and the
legal system.
I helped put together the panel de
voted to health care, titled "Data, Dis
ease, and Difference: Why are Inequali
ties in Health so Pervasive?" Some of
you may wonder why Stanford's
bioethics center co-sponsored this event
with the Center for the Comparative
Study of Race and Ethnicity and the
Equal Justice Society. The answer is a
simple one: the persistence of profound
health disparities across the U.S. popu
lation is not simply a technical issue of
data collection and numbers, but is also
a matter of profound moral significance.
Health is linked intimately to one's life
chances in every society, thus the provi
sion of health care services is an impor
tant indicator (and a potent symbol) of
inclusion in a community. Success marks
a just and fair society; failure in assuring
equality in access to health care, includ
ing public health services, is a symptom
of failure a diagnostic sign of injus
tice. Without data, we can't know when
we are failing, or whether efforts to do
better are working.
I believe that lingering health dispar
ities are one of the most significant fail
ures of the struggle for civil rights over
the past 40 years. Compared to discrim
ination in housing, say, this should have
been an easy social inequity to correct.
Doctors are professionals after all, and
it's hard to imagine that they treat some
patients differently than others. How is
it possible, for example, that African
American patients with potentially cur
able early-stage lung cancer are referred
for surgery less often than whites? In
deed, it may be the medical profession's

commitment to its image of egalitarian
ism and scientific objectivity that is part
of the problem. When as a medical an
thropologist I lecture to groups of physi
cians and other health professionals
about the extent of health disparities,
the first reaction is usually disbelief. Al
though trained to respect data they find
the overwhelming evidence of lingering
racial disparities documented most
recently by the Institute of Medicine's
report, "Unequal Treatment: Con
fronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in
Health Care" impossible to believe.
"That can't be," they respond, "I treat all
my patients the same." But the data,
documented in study after study, are
clear and we know that is not the case.
How do we correct the problem?
Should "color blindness" be the goal?
Or will the elimination of health dispari
ties be accomplished by carefully at
tending to differences, whether culture,
race, ethnicity, social class, national ori
gin, or language facility defines them?
We have a national goal of eliminat
ing health disparities by the year 2010, a
goal originally set during the tenure of
Surgeon General David Satcher. Some
people believe that we have all the an
swers; that we understand all the com
plex causes of disparities, including dif
ferences in mortality rates that have per
sisted for decades, so why keep collecting
more data? But we don't have answers,
and in some cases we don't even know
which questions to ask. In particular, we
don't understand the interaction of
health care outcomes with other social
domains. That's one reason why Prop. 54
as written is dangerous, because it would
prevent researchers from examining the
links between health outcomes and fac
tors including educational attainment,
increasing income stratification per
haps the biggest threat to social justice
facing our society, persisting residential
segregation and skewed exposure to en
vironmental hazards not to mention
the possible health effects of racism itself
through mechanisms that are still poorly

understood. How do social inequalities
get "into the body?" We've only begun
to investigate these issues.
Finally, how we categorize difference
matters, and matters deeply. A central
dilemma is: to what extent are health dis
parities the result of unequal distribu
tion of resources, and thus a conse
quence of varied socioeconomic status
(and in some cases racism, whether bla
tant or unconscious), and to what extent
are inequities in health status the result
of inherent characteristics of individuals
defined as ethnically or racially differ
ent? How we conceptualize and talk
about race when we ask these questions
has profound moral consequences. Will
we end up "blaming the victims" for
their cultural beliefs and practices or as
suming the existence of biological differ
ences, rather than investigating them?
Part of the answer depends on how we
ask the questions, on how we construct

categories of difference in health care re
search. The current system of racial and
ethnic classification is not necessarily the
only way or the best way to define dif
ference in biomedical research. It clear
ly needs revision and updating, in partic
ular "de-linking" our views of race from
the history of scientific racism, one goal
of the proposition's sponsors.
Prop. 54 will have served a good pur
pose if it leads to a critical examination
of how we use data about "difference."
But we need to interrogate racial and
ethnic categories, working to make
them more relevant and meaningful for
researchers and clinicians, not eliminate
them. In the end, access to health care
and social justice are intimately linked.
