## Private and institutional racism is redefined by Proposition 54 
### CHRIS VAUGHAN 
The central problem with ballot initiatives is that they hand over to the
mass of voters the ability to put into law or strike from the law a complex
piece of policy with a simple, non-negotiated majority vote. Legislative
processes are bound to be confusing, drawn-out, and muddled affairs, but
what is achieved are laws filtered and shaped according to various interests
and viewpoints. Ballot initiatives, on the other hand, tolerate no shades of
gray and make no distinctions beyond "yes" and "no," majority and mi
nority, new law and not a law.
Proposition 54, Ward Connerly's race-data-eliminating ballot initiative,
is no different. The distinction it misses is between private racism and in
stitutional racism. The former is usually found in an individual's personal
feelings toward those of other races bigotry and prejudice are two ex
amples. (Of course, private racism is often made public, and the public may
make judgments on the private, but that is another issue altogether.)
On the other hand, institutional racism is, by definition, racism meted
out in the functions of organizations or structures. It may exist even when
no private, individual racist is there to promulgate it. With institutional
racism, minorities suffer even as it is difficult or impossible to identify an
individual agent causing that suffering. Income gaps persist as hiring dis
crimination ebbs, overtly segregationist residential districts of old prove
to be stubborn integrators today, etc. None of this is to say that racists no
longer exist, but instead that in many institutions, industries, and organi
zations, racial inequalities unequivocally exist even in the absence of
agents provocateur.
How would Prop. 54 respond to the distinctions between private and in
stitutional racism? The initiative seeks, basically, to remove race from in
dividuals' mental space. To Connerly it might seem logical that when we
think less about race, we become less racist, and that the institutions around
us then become less racist. Two things should be said here: first, the link be
tween thinking less about race and becoming less racist has never, to my
knowledge, been substantiated on a wide basis. Second, and of vast im
portance, is that no matter what happens on the level of private racism, in
stitutional racism will push on. However, Prop. 54 has nothing to say about
institutional racism, and it is difficult to envision how the initiative would
address let alone reform processes that continue to dole out benefits
inequitably. In more ways than one, race demands better than a black-and
white treatment. That Prop. 54 would reduce it to such is cause for concern
(and, I would argue, an examination of ballot initiatives generally), if not
the best reason for the initiative's rejection.
