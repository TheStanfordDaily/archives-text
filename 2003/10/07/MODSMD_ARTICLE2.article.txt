## Job-seekers find Career Fair lacking in liberal arts choices, plan to explore other avenues for "fuzzy" employment 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Between tables staffed by Lehman
Brothers, Microsoft and Lockheed Mar
tin, Stanford students seeking careers out
side of consulting, engineering or banking
are unlikely to find employment today in
White Plaza at the first Career Fair of the
school year.
Of the 160 companies attending the

fair, which is held annually by the Career
Development Center and draws more em
ployers than any other fair held during the
year, 25 are in consulting, 14 in engineer
ing, 8 in information technology, 7 in in
vestment banking, 5 in computers and 4 in
biotechnology.
While 11 opportunities fall under gov
ernment, none are found under the listings
of art or advertising. Communications/
media and international affairs only list two

companies each and only one law firm is
registered for the fair.
According to the CDC's registration
data, that breakdown matches with stu
dent interests. The most popular career
interest among students registered with
the CDC is business, followed by technol
ogy and engineering fields and public ser
vice and arts / media, CDC Director
