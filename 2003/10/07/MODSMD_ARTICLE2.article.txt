## Job-seekers find Career Fair lacking in liberal arts choices, plan to explore other avenues for "fuzzy" employment 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Between tables staffed by Lehman
Brothers, Microsoft and Lockheed Mar
tin, Stanford students seeking careers out
side of consulting, engineering or banking
are unlikely to find employment today in
White Plaza at the first Career Fair of the
school year.
Of the 160 companies attending the

fair, which is held annually by the Career
Development Center and draws more em
ployers than any other fair held during the
year, 25 are in consulting, 14 in engineer
ing, 8 in information technology, 7 in in
vestment banking, 5 in computers and 4 in
biotechnology.
While 11 opportunities fall under gov
ernment, none are found under the listings
of art or advertising. Communications/
media and international affairs only list two

companies each and only one law firm is
registered for the fair.
According to the CDC's registration
data, that breakdown matches with stu
dent interests. The most popular career
interest among students registered with
the CDC is business, followed by technol
ogy and engineering fields and public ser
vice and arts / media, CDC Director

Students network with potential employers at last year's Career Fair, held annually in White Plaza. This year's fair will be held today
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Lance Choy said.
But the diversity of majors at
Stanford suggests a greater range of
interests that may not be accounted
for in the CDC's data.
The fact that 236 student were
majoring in economics at the begin
ning of last year, according to the
Registrar's Office, points to the
popularity of business career plans.
But the history and English de
partments claim 129 undergradu
ates each, and the number of stu
dents studying international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy are similar.

The CDC will offer a Liberal
Arts Career & Internship Fair at the
end of January, but some worry that
is too late to start the job hunt and
turn to other resources, instead.
Tiffany Humbert-Rico, who
graduated from Stanford last year
with a degree in psychology, re
members attending one career fair
where she observed a heavy "engi
neering focus." In search of coun
seling jobs, she turned to Monster
trak, an online job database,
which directed her to her current
internship.

Choy said the CDC offers re
sources other than the Career Fair
that can help students look for jobs
on their own.

"One of the primary jobs of the
CDC is to help students learn how to
contact employers and not just wait
for companies to come on-campus,"
Choy said. "Just using fairs can be
extremely beneficial for some stu
dents, but limiting to others."
Indeed, after attending career
fairs in the past, Allison Lee, a
coterminal student in communica
tions, found most opportunities of
fered to liberal arts majors are in
consulting a field where many in
terested students, Lee said, have al
ready made contacts. Lee also ob
served a limited selection of man
agement, retail and government op
portunities.

Although technological fields are
relatively prominent in the fair, Neil
Achtman, a coterminal student in
electrical engineering, considers ca
reer fairs "econ-oriented rather
than techie-oriented."
Last week the CDC held two
preparatory workshops for stu
dents hoping to successfully "en
gage the recruiters" at the fair, ac
cording to Choy.
Lee, who attended a graduate
student workshop, viewed the hour
long session as "sort of a plug for the
CDC." Still, she said, it provided her
with helpful strategies on how to ap
proach potential employers.

The effect of the still-weak econ
omy will continue to affect both em
ployers and students at today's
event.

"At last year's fair, there were
companies which did not actually

have any openings, but were collect
ing resumes in case they were able to
hire in the future," recalled Acht
man.
Employers have paid more this
year to register for the fair, accord
ing to Choy $7OO or $lOO for non
profit organizations. For many com
panies, the costs quickly add up; em
ployers also must consider travel
costs and student interest in then
field when deciding whether to at
tend the fair.

The prominence of investment
banking and high-tech industries
may arise as smaller companies find
it cost-ineffective to travel to a uni
versity where they might only re
cruit a few students all day, accord
ing to Choy.
Senior Joe Shermetaro, recruit
ing director for Stanford Consult
ing, said today's job search will be
"even tougher for Stanford students
since we live in the tech environ
ment of Silicon Valley," compared
to the experience of students in
other regions.
Many seniors say that the Ca
reer Fair is just one of many ways to
find a job; Cardinal Recruiting, for
example, is a free service that
hooks students up with potential
employers.
"Actual job offers usually seem
to result from personal connec
tions," said Shermetaro, whose in
ternship last summer has already se
cured him a job.
The fair will take place from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m.

Of the 160 companies attending the

fair, which is held annually by the Career
Development Center and draws more em
ployers than any other fair held during the
year, 25 are in consulting, 14 in engineer
ing, 8 in information technology, 7 in in
vestment banking, 5 in computers and 4 in
biotechnology.
While 11 opportunities fall under gov
ernment, none are found under the listings
of art or advertising. Communications/
media and international affairs only list two

companies each and only one law firm is
registered for the fair.
According to the CDC's registration
data, that breakdown matches with stu
dent interests. The most popular career
interest among students registered with
the CDC is business, followed by technol
ogy and engineering fields and public ser
vice and arts / media, CDC Director

Students network with potential employers at last year's Career Fair, held annually in White Plaza. This year's fair will be held today
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Lance Choy said.
But the diversity of majors at
Stanford suggests a greater range of
interests that may not be accounted
for in the CDC's data.
The fact that 236 student were
majoring in economics at the begin
ning of last year, according to the
Registrar's Office, points to the
popularity of business career plans.
But the history and English de
partments claim 129 undergradu
ates each, and the number of stu
dents studying international rela
tions, political science and psycholo
gy are similar.

The CDC will offer a Liberal
Arts Career & Internship Fair at the
end of January, but some worry that
is too late to start the job hunt and
turn to other resources, instead.
Tiffany Humbert-Rico, who
graduated from Stanford last year
with a degree in psychology, re
members attending one career fair
where she observed a heavy "engi
neering focus." In search of coun
seling jobs, she turned to Monster
trak, an online job database,
which directed her to her current
internship.

Choy said the CDC offers re
sources other than the Career Fair
that can help students look for jobs
on their own.

"One of the primary jobs of the
CDC is to help students learn how to
contact employers and not just wait
for companies to come on-campus,"
Choy said. "Just using fairs can be
extremely beneficial for some stu
dents, but limiting to others."
Indeed, after attending career
fairs in the past, Allison Lee, a
coterminal student in communica
tions, found most opportunities of
fered to liberal arts majors are in
consulting a field where many in
terested students, Lee said, have al
ready made contacts. Lee also ob
served a limited selection of man
agement, retail and government op
portunities.

Although technological fields are
relatively prominent in the fair, Neil
Achtman, a coterminal student in
electrical engineering, considers ca
reer fairs "econ-oriented rather
than techie-oriented."
Last week the CDC held two
preparatory workshops for stu
dents hoping to successfully "en
gage the recruiters" at the fair, ac
cording to Choy.
Lee, who attended a graduate
student workshop, viewed the hour
long session as "sort of a plug for the
CDC." Still, she said, it provided her
with helpful strategies on how to ap
proach potential employers.

The effect of the still-weak econ
omy will continue to affect both em
ployers and students at today's
event.

"At last year's fair, there were
companies which did not actually

have any openings, but were collect
ing resumes in case they were able to
hire in the future," recalled Acht
man.
Employers have paid more this
year to register for the fair, accord
ing to Choy $7OO or $lOO for non
profit organizations. For many com
panies, the costs quickly add up; em
ployers also must consider travel
costs and student interest in then
field when deciding whether to at
tend the fair.

The prominence of investment
banking and high-tech industries
may arise as smaller companies find
it cost-ineffective to travel to a uni
versity where they might only re
cruit a few students all day, accord
ing to Choy.
Senior Joe Shermetaro, recruit
ing director for Stanford Consult
ing, said today's job search will be
"even tougher for Stanford students
since we live in the tech environ
ment of Silicon Valley," compared
to the experience of students in
other regions.
Many seniors say that the Ca
reer Fair is just one of many ways to
find a job; Cardinal Recruiting, for
example, is a free service that
hooks students up with potential
employers.
"Actual job offers usually seem
to result from personal connec
tions," said Shermetaro, whose in
ternship last summer has already se
cured him a job.
The fair will take place from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m.
