## Spencer takes a break and talks hockey

Ur â–  first thing they always did
was run you." This was going to
be the first line of my column
-1. this week, the first line of "Mon
eyball," the often-quoted Michael Lewis book
about how the Oakland A's win so many
games year after year with one of the lowest
payrolls in baseball. I was going to use the fan
tastic book to highlight the Boston-Oakland
series, which culminated last night in a
(Spencer is writing this yesterday and actually
does not know the outcome of a game that will
be played in his future, but he will make the call
that it will be a) Boston win.
But thanks to deadlines of pre-game
o'clock, and my editor's strange aversion to me
writing articles about games that haven't hap
pened yet, I'm not going to write about it. I'm
not going to write about how Lewis shows that
nine Scott Hattebergs are better than the start
ing lineup of the Yankees. I'm not going to
write about how I must have

been a genius in little league,
because my career was rid
dled with walks.
Riddled... good word.
I'm not going to write
about how Trot Nixon hit
the biggest shot of this year
in baseball, a pinch hit, extra
innings, walk-off, deeeep-

center-field home run, only

to tell the nation that he did not swing, THE
LORD did. If only I had picked up Him in my
fantasy baseball league. Stupidly, I chose Trot
Nixon, so I miss out on this hne:
THE LORD 1-1...1HR..2 R81....1.000
BA.
But I'm not going to write about that,
about how Byung-Hyun Kim (whose name
my dad claims translates to "Home Run" ...
hahaha) flipped off the Boston crowd, or how
a guy decked out in Red Sox paraphernalia
saw my brother and his friends similarly
decked out in A's gear after Game 1 and pre
emptively attacked, "If you ahh going to in
fahm me that the A's beat the Red Sox, I am
already awaya."
I'm not going to write about any of that.
As compelling as all it is, even though I went
to Game 5 last night (Remember! I haven't
gone yet, I'm writing this yesterday ... just
keeping everybody on the same page), and
even though "Moneyball" is my Baseball
Bible (Trot Nixon begs to differ), I'm going
to write about hockey.
And I hate hockey.
I've never enjoyed watching hockey, and
not thanks to any misappreciation of the game.
I used to play in-line hockey all the time in my
youth, and let me tell you, I was a force. But
I've never been able to really enjoy hockey on
TV maybe a Stanley Cup game once in a
while, or a quick check to see if Lemieux is
playing, but that's about it.
And as you slowly grasp what this column is
all about, I'll beat you to the punch Atlanta
Thrashers star Dany Heatley drove his Ferrari
around a residential neighborhood at 80 mph,
losing control of the car, and plowing into an
unforgiving brick wall. Heatley, the MVP of
the all-star game, is likely out for the season
with jaw and knee injuries as well as a myr
iad of legal troubles. This would be a tragedy
already without even knowing the full extent
of it.
The sad part is what happened in the pas
senger's seat. Dan Snyder, an up-and-coming
young center for the Thrashers, suffered ex
tensive brain damage, falling into a coma he
would not wake up from, dying Sunday night in
an Atlanta hospital.
Now, maybe I identify with Snyder be
cause he was a guy who scrapped his way to
the top in one of the most brutal sports on the
planet.
Maybe we can all identify with a hard
working guy in a hard working league. But the
irony is cruel. Just as he finally made it to the
pinnacle of accomplishments, the man who
many people in the NHL strive to be took it
all away from him.
I don't watch hockey. I couldn't tell you the
points leader from last year or the MVP of the
league. And to tell the truth, I'm not even sure
who won the Stanley Cup. I'd say I have about
an average interest in the sport, as compared
with the rest of the country. I don't go to games,
watch them on TV, or check scores in the paper
the next day.
But I do respect the athletes. I respect the
guys that hate the masks in front of their faces,
the guys with no teeth and broken ankles, but
unbreakable toughness that lace it up
every day.
Which makes it so much worse, that a guy
that fought so hard was taken down so tragi
cally. It makes playoff baseball seem a bit in
consequential, Trot Nixon's drive an af
terthought, the "plight of the Red Sox" merely
inappropriate.
So while the rest of the country watches
the World Series in what will be the biggest
story of October, keep in mind that no matter
who wins, the consequences are not nearly
life or death.

Spencer Porter, a junior majoring in American
Studies, will most likely go back to rambling on
and on and on about how he successfidly
walked onto the men's soccer team. E-mail him
atporters@stanford.edu to congratidate him.
