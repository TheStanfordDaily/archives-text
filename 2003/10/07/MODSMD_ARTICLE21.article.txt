# Card drops two games
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Playing under the lights in front of its biggest home crowd of
the season, the stage was set perfectly for the women's soccer team
(5-5-1) to come away with a much-needed victory at the Stanford
/ Nike Invitational. However, the Cardinal did not bank on facing
a No. 19 Santa Clara (6-3-3) team that arguably played its best
match of the season.

Stanford left the field on Friday night with yet another trying
defeat in which it was unable to come up with even one goal, los
ing by a count of 2-0.
The Cardinal was unable to keep up with the speed and quick
ness of the Broncos, while the Santa Clara players always seemed
to be in the right place at the right time.
"They scored on a couple soft goals," Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "The first goal was an amazing shot. It's not some
thing we're going to see very often, so it was very frustrating."
For Santa Clara, it was its freshmen who came up big. Both
goals were scored by members of what "Soccer Buzz Magazine"
dubbed the top recruiting class in the nation.
That "amazing" first goal came in the 18th minute off a free
kick inside the box that Santa Clara received after a Brittany
Oliveira foul. Bronco freshman midfielder Marian Dalmy took a
short pass from freshman forward Tina Estrada and drilled the
ball into the top right corner of the goal, out of reach of diving
Stanford goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the Broncos added to their
lead just six minutes later on a shot by midfielder Lauren Zealear.
"That goal was upsetting for us," Ratcliffe said. "We didn't put
enough pressure on the ball when [Zealear] was shooting we
weren't aggressive enough. But on the same token, it wasn't a re
ally hard-hit ball."
The second goal, coupled with the temporary loss of senior
midfielder and team tri-captain Ally Marquand, took much of the
life out of the Cardinal.

Marquand landed hard after leaping to contest a header and
stayed down for several scary moments. She left in the 33rd
minute, but would return in the second half.

After Marquand's initial departure, the Broncos were able to
maintain pressure on the Cardinal defense, by keeping the ball in
front of the Stanford net for the rest of the match and thus allow
ing for very few scoring opportunities.
"We did a really good job with our defensive organization,"
Santa Clara head coach Jerry Smith said. "We didn't let [the Car
dinal] have any sustained attacks. One thing Stanford does a good
job of is getting hold of the ball and getting a little rhythm. We dis
rupted that pretty well."
However, Smith acknowledged that his defense broke down a
bit in the final minutes, allowing several scoring chances for the
Cardinal. Smith cited overly-conservative defense for the miscues.
Ultimately, everything came together for the Broncos on Fri
day night, while the Cardinal still struggled with its offense.
"All in all, I think it was a nice, solid performance from our
team that we normally get in the second half of the season, and
[Friday night] started the second half of the season for us," Smith
said. "I think a lot of experiments from the first half are over and
things are really starting to pay off for us."
The offensive struggles continued for Stanford on Sunday
when it faced Loyola Marymount for the conclusion of the Stan
ford / Nike Invitational.
The Cardinal suffered a 2-1 loss to the Lions, allowing goals in
the 39th and 59th minutes. It was again a freshman who hurt Stan
ford as midfielder Whitney Temple drove the first goal into the
