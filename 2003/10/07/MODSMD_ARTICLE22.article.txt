# Cardinal travels to So. Cal for tournament
## 
### MIA LEE 
Behind the deceptively sub
dued scenes of empty grand
stands and retreating sunlight,
the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis team brings practice to a
close and gears up for another
year of hard-hitting tournament
success.

The Riviera / ITA Women's
All-American Championships
take place Oct. 4-12 and heralds
the start of the collegiate tennis
season. The Pacific Palisades,
Calif., tournament gives an elite
group of 32 NCAA Division I sin
gles players (and 16 doubles
teams) an opportunity to boost its
confidence and ratings. Singles
main draw play begins Oct. 9,
with 24 players selected at-large.
The remaining eight will have
survived grueling pre-qualifying
round play.
"I am of the opinion that [a
tournament] this early can only
help you do well," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood despite
the stiff competition that her
Cardinal team will inevitably
face in the tournament.
Stanford women's tennis is
sending seven players to The
Ail-American.
Three of the seven selected
Stanford players sophomore
Alice Barnes, senior Lauren
Barnikow and junior Erin Bur
dette are heading straight to
main draw. Their preseason
rankings speak to this accom
plished end, as they are ranked
sixth. 10th and 11th nationwide,
respectively.
Barnikow is confident in her
second consecutive entry into
the main draw.
"I haven't played a tourna
ment since last year at NCAAs,
so I consider this [tournament]
warming up," Barnikow said.
In 2002, Barnikow advanced
to the consolation quarterfinals

at Riviera with a three-set victory
over Adria Engel of Arizona
State. Unfortunately for
Barnikow, a series of taxing con
ditioning sessions took their toll,
forcing her to withdraw from the
match.

"It was kind of a funny tour
nament," said Forood regarding
the leg problems that plagued
all three of last year's contes
tants. (Barnikow, Burdette and
sophomore Amber Liu.)
Notably absent from this

year's All-American lineup is
'second-ranked Liu, the sopho
more who clinched an NCAA
Singles Championship Title last
May over her top-seeded rival,
now-graduated Vilmarie Castel
lvi of Tennessee.

"Amber made the decision
that she would like to limit her
individual collegiate tourna
ments," Forood said.
Liu, who is currently fo
cused on improving her profes
sional standing, will instead
compete in a $25,000 WTA
satellite this week.
Liu, however, is not without
her ties to The All-American.
"It got her established [as a
player] last year," Forood noted.
In fact, at this time last Oct.,
Liu stood 67th in the preseason
rankings.
The latest additions to the Car
dinal women's tennis roster will
also look to leave their mark on the
2003 All-American.
Anne Yelsey, a freshman
ranked seventh in the United
States Tennis Association Girls'
18, just completed her pre-qualify
ing match at Riviera with a three
set loss to Laura Gordon of
UCLA, 3-6,6-4,3-6.
Freshman Teresa Logar, who
is entering the qualifying brack
et at All-American, likened her
self to "a deer in the headlights."
Working nonstop to prepare
herself for her first rounds of colle
giate play, Logar has, as a result,
been forced to battle a case of ten
donitis in her right knee.
"I've never been a person to
take off time," Logar said of
the injury, which forced her to
leave practice on Wednesday
of last week.
However, in light of the appar
ent setback, Logar remains opti
mistic and wryly determined.
"That's what Advil's for," she
said.
A National Junior Champi
on, Logar is ranked fourth in the
USTA Girls' 18. She has already
played twice in the professional
circuit, including an appearance
at the US Open this summer.

Senior Lauren Barnikow pounds the ball back at her opponent. She will be competing in The Riviera / ITA
Women's All American Championships this week in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
The Cardinal also bears great po
tential in the doubles arena. Stan
ford returns its top-ranked doubles
team, made up of Barnikow and
Burdette, which hopes to comple
ment their 2003 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Doubles Team of the Year
award with a title this week.
Stanford is distinguished as the
record-holder of titles at Riviera,
with a total of eight since the tour
nament's inception in 1983.
"We want to show the rest of
the nation that we're ready [for
them]," said Barnikow.
Main draw action begins to
morrow afternoon and the tour
nament will culminate on Sunday,
Oct. 12th.

tournament] this early can only
help you do well," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood despite
the stiff competition that her
Cardinal team will inevitably
face in the tournament.
Stanford women's tennis is
sending seven players to The
Ail-American.
Three of the seven selected
Stanford players sophomore
Alice Barnes, senior Lauren
Barnikow and junior Erin Bur
dette are heading straight to
main draw. Their preseason
rankings speak to this accom
plished end, as they are ranked
sixth. 10th and 11th nationwide,
respectively.
Barnikow is confident in her
second consecutive entry into
the main draw.
"I haven't played a tourna
ment since last year at NCAAs,
so I consider this [tournament]
warming up," Barnikow said.
In 2002, Barnikow advanced
to the consolation quarterfinals

at Riviera with a three-set victory
over Adria Engel of Arizona
State. Unfortunately for
Barnikow, a series of taxing con
ditioning sessions took their toll,
forcing her to withdraw from the
match.

"It was kind of a funny tour
nament," said Forood regarding
the leg problems that plagued
all three of last year's contes
tants. (Barnikow, Burdette and
sophomore Amber Liu.)
Notably absent from this

year's All-American lineup is
'second-ranked Liu, the sopho
more who clinched an NCAA
Singles Championship Title last
May over her top-seeded rival,
now-graduated Vilmarie Castel
lvi of Tennessee.

"Amber made the decision
that she would like to limit her
individual collegiate tourna
ments," Forood said.
Liu, who is currently fo
cused on improving her profes
sional standing, will instead
compete in a $25,000 WTA
satellite this week.
Liu, however, is not without
her ties to The All-American.
"It got her established [as a
player] last year," Forood noted.
In fact, at this time last Oct.,
Liu stood 67th in the preseason
rankings.
The latest additions to the Car
dinal women's tennis roster will
also look to leave their mark on the
2003 All-American.
Anne Yelsey, a freshman
ranked seventh in the United
States Tennis Association Girls'
18, just completed her pre-qualify
ing match at Riviera with a three
set loss to Laura Gordon of
UCLA, 3-6,6-4,3-6.
Freshman Teresa Logar, who
is entering the qualifying brack
et at All-American, likened her
self to "a deer in the headlights."
Working nonstop to prepare
herself for her first rounds of colle
giate play, Logar has, as a result,
been forced to battle a case of ten
donitis in her right knee.
"I've never been a person to
take off time," Logar said of
the injury, which forced her to
leave practice on Wednesday
of last week.
However, in light of the appar
ent setback, Logar remains opti
mistic and wryly determined.
"That's what Advil's for," she
said.
A National Junior Champi
on, Logar is ranked fourth in the
USTA Girls' 18. She has already
played twice in the professional
circuit, including an appearance
at the US Open this summer.

Senior Lauren Barnikow pounds the ball back at her opponent. She will be competing in The Riviera / ITA
Women's All American Championships this week in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
The Cardinal also bears great po
tential in the doubles arena. Stan
ford returns its top-ranked doubles
team, made up of Barnikow and
Burdette, which hopes to comple
ment their 2003 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Doubles Team of the Year
award with a title this week.
Stanford is distinguished as the
record-holder of titles at Riviera,
with a total of eight since the tour
nament's inception in 1983.
"We want to show the rest of
the nation that we're ready [for
them]," said Barnikow.
Main draw action begins to
morrow afternoon and the tour
nament will culminate on Sunday,
Oct. 12th.
