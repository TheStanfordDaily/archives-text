# Men open season
## 
### KAIYA REEVE 
Ah, it's that time of year again. The nets are
taut, the rackets are strung and the courts are
ready for action. The 2003-2004 men's tennis
season has begun.
The start of the season also marks the be
ginning of the end of Dick Gould's illustrious
career as head coach of the Stanford men's
tennis team. On Thursday, he announced his
decision to retire at the end of this season after
38 years of guiding players to victories and
multiple championships.
"Stanford has provided me with an incred
ible 38-year journey," Gould said in a press re
lease. "I will be forever indebted to the won
derful young men with whom I had the great
pleasure to work, and who in turn have taught
me so much and made my life so rich."
A Stanford graduate, Gould has led his
teams to 17 NCAA championships and was
named 2000 NCAA Coach of the Year. Dur
ing his career, he has coached some of the most
celebrated players in tennis history, including
John and Patrick McEnroe.
Next year, associate head coach John
Whitlinger will take over the role of head
coach. No stranger to the Stanford tennis
scene, he was a two-time All-American
NCAA Singles and Doubles Champion for
the Cardinal and is in his 18th year of coaching
on the Farm.
"I'm very excited about taking over the
program as head coach," Whitlinger said. "I
hope to maintain the excellence that Coach
Gould started 38 years ago. I have learned so
much from him as a player, and over the last 18
years as coach.
"I am forever grateful for all he has done
for me. He has been an incredible friend and
mentor," he continued.
The team kicked off the start of the season
by sending three players to Chattanooga,
Tenn., on Monday to play in the Icy Hot /
ITA Men's Ail-American Championships.
This is the first of the three major tourna
ments this fall, gathering 300 top players

from across the country, making it the largest
collegiate sports event of the season.
Stanford players K.C. Corkery, James Pade
and Sam Warburg were invited to participate
this year, plunging into the competitive scene
with only four days of practice on the Stanford
courts under their belts.
Comparatively, most other teams that will
be participating in the invitational have been
able to get court time for about a month.
Coach Gould maintains full confidence in
his players, noting that "The three guys who
are going [into the tournament] have played a
lot during the summer and are as good as any
one in the country on any given day."
The roster for this year includes four fresh
men, all with huge potential to make a mark on
the national scene. Nico Martinez from
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is a standout student
of Stanford alumnus and All-American Vimal
Patel. Eric McKean, hailing from Hermosa
Beach, Calif., will most likely start as a doubles
player after proving to be one of the top play
ers in southern California.
Chris Rasmussen from Moraga, Calif.,
reached the round of 16 at the National Ju
nior Championships, and is currently a top
northern California junior competitor.
The final freshman on the roster, James
Wan, is the 2002 Boys' 16's National Cham
pion and comes to The Farm from Wood
bury, N.Y. He was ranked first in the 18 and
under division and has a very strong chance
of beginning his Stanford tennis career in the
starting lineup.
Returning to the courts for their sopho
more years are Pade, Jon Wong and Corkery,
an All-American. Corkery has an impressive
21-1 record from last season and is ranked No.
1 on the Stanford roster.
Pade comes into the 2003-2004 season with
a 20-4 record and is looking to be on the top of
the lineup this year.
Junior Sam Warburg comes into the sea-

Sophomore K.C. Corkery returns the ball. Corkery, along with three other men's tennis players will
travel to Tennessee for
son with a 44-6 dual meet record
and is ranked on the national col
legiate level at No. 28. Phil Sheng,
will be playing more extensively
this year after a more limited
schedule during the 2002-2003
season.
Seniors Carter Morris and Joe
Kao round out the roster, looking at
their last year on The Farm. Morris
will be competing this season after
taking the summer off due to health
reasons.
Gould has high expectations for
the team this season.
"I have a lot of confidence in the
guys," Gould said. "I'm looking for
ward to this year. "Corkery, Pade
and Warburg will begin match play
tomorrow in Tenn. The Champi
onship game will be played on Sun
day, Oct. 12.

from across the country, making it the largest
collegiate sports event of the season.
Stanford players K.C. Corkery, James Pade
and Sam Warburg were invited to participate
this year, plunging into the competitive scene
with only four days of practice on the Stanford
courts under their belts.
Comparatively, most other teams that will
be participating in the invitational have been
able to get court time for about a month.
Coach Gould maintains full confidence in
his players, noting that "The three guys who
are going [into the tournament] have played a
lot during the summer and are as good as any
one in the country on any given day."
The roster for this year includes four fresh
men, all with huge potential to make a mark on
the national scene. Nico Martinez from
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is a standout student
of Stanford alumnus and All-American Vimal
Patel. Eric McKean, hailing from Hermosa
Beach, Calif., will most likely start as a doubles
player after proving to be one of the top play
ers in southern California.
Chris Rasmussen from Moraga, Calif.,
reached the round of 16 at the National Ju
nior Championships, and is currently a top
northern California junior competitor.
The final freshman on the roster, James
Wan, is the 2002 Boys' 16's National Cham
pion and comes to The Farm from Wood
bury, N.Y. He was ranked first in the 18 and
under division and has a very strong chance
of beginning his Stanford tennis career in the
starting lineup.
Returning to the courts for their sopho
more years are Pade, Jon Wong and Corkery,
an All-American. Corkery has an impressive
21-1 record from last season and is ranked No.
1 on the Stanford roster.
Pade comes into the 2003-2004 season with
a 20-4 record and is looking to be on the top of
the lineup this year.
