# Women's volleyball takes on Pacific
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball
team (12-2,6-0 Pacific 10 Conference) is getting
a short break from its tough Pac-10 schedule, it
certainly isn't getting any time off, as the Cardi
nal faces No. 23 Pacific (8-5) today just three
days after returning from a road trip to Arizona
on Saturday.
"It feels kind of crazy," said junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani who is leading Stanford
in kills per game (5.39). "I was happy to have
Saturday off, but it flew by and all of a sudden its
time for another game. Once the season starts,
we have games all the time and it starts to feel
like a long train ride that keeps going and
going."
Thursday, the Cardinal was in Tempe, Ariz.,
where it defeated Arizona State. Stanford then
traveled to Tucson and picked up a victory over
Arizona to improve to 6-0 in the Pac-10. All six of
these league matches have been battles for the
Cardinal because the Pac-10 boasts one of the
strongest conferences, with the most teams

ranked in the nation's top 25, including No. 1
use.
While facing a non-conference team will give
Stanford a chance to take a deep breath, Pacific
is a very strong squad that enters the Farm 8-5 on
the season. This record is a bit misleading, as
three of the Tiger's five losses have come against
ranked teams No. 2 Hawaii, No. 7 Pepper
dine and No. 15 UC-Santa Barbara and they
scored a huge win in their first match of the sea
son over No. 14 Santa Clara back on Aug. 29.
"It will be nice to play a non-conference team
and see a different style of play," Nnamani said.
"This will also give us a chance to see how we are
outside of the Pac-10. They are a very good team
and have a lot of talent, so we definitely have to
come into the match ready to play."
Historically, Pacific has been a very success
ful program and is one of only four teams that
have participated in every NCAA Women's
Volleyball Tournament. Last season, the Tigers
fell just short of the 20-win benchmark with 19
wins and went 12-6 in Big West Conference ac
tion.
The last time the two teams met was last sea

son on Oct. 22 in Stockton, Calif. In the match,
the Cardinal swept the Tigers 3-0, 30-28, 30-18
and 30-26. All-time, Stanford holds only a very
slight edge over Pacific. The teams stand at 26-
23, with Stanford's last loss of the series coming
in 2001.
This year's matchup will be a battle for the
net. Pacific is led by senior three-time AVCA
All-American middle blocker Jennifer Joines.
In her junior season, Joines notched her 1,500 th
career kill and 500 th career block and with just
282 kills this season she will become the school's
all time leading hitter. Moreover, if she is named
Ail-American, she will be the second four-year
All-American in school history.
Joines, however, will be squaring off against
the nation's leading blocker, Stanford senior
Jennifer Harvey. Not only does Harvey lead the
team and the nation in blocks per game at 1.80,
she has also propelled the Cardinal to become
the leading blocking team in the nation with 3.57
blocks per game. Furthermore, Harvey leads the
team in hitting percentage at .435, which puts
her at 11th in the nation.
Game time is set for 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion
