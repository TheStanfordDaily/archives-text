# Strikers rally against UCs
## 
### ROGELIO MORALES DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) Supporters and members of the
United Auto Workers union participated in a peace
ful but lively one-day strike on Friday, protesting what
the union called unfair labor practices committed by
the University of California.
Union members went on strike throughout the UC
system - causing the cancellation of many course dis
cussion sections.
The strike took place at the intersection of Le
Conte Avenue and Westwood Boulevard, where
scores of striking teaching assistants, readers, tutors
and sympathetic members of other unions circled the
intersection from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.
Yelling chants such as "No justice, no teach" and
"Union power," strikers drew the support of some
passing cars and pedestrians.
The UAW represents over 10,000 teaching assis
tants, readers and tutors at the eight undergraduate
UC campuses.
The one-day strike was in response to the UC's al
leged 64 unfair labor practice charges, which the
UAW has filed with the Public Employee Relations
Board - a quasi-judicial administrative agency that
oversees the collective bargaining process for state
employees.
Union members decided to strike when negotia
tions with the university broke down Sept. 30.
Paul Schwartz, a UC spokesman, has dismissed the
charges filed by UAW, maintaining that the universi
ty has offered the union fair proposals.
Beth Rayfield, a spokeswoman for the UAW, said
the burden to bargain in good faith falls on the uni
versity.
In a show of solidarity, other unions turned out to

support the UAW strike.
Claudia Horning, state president of the Coali
tion of University Employees union, said she par
ticipated in the strike to reciprocate past support of
her union.
"[CUE] had a very similar situation with the uni
versity in the fall of last year, and the UAW showed
great support for us [in our labor dispute with the
UC]," Horning said, referring to the lengthy negotia
tion process her union underwent.
After a two-year dispute, CUE negotiated a 3.5
percent pay raise over two years for the organization.
The pay raise period concluded in May 2003. The past
support by the UAW has won it partiality among the
other university unions.
"We fully support the UAW with their fight here,"
Horning said.
About 15 American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees union members, whose
union is not directly involved in the labor dispute,
donned their bright green union shirts and marched
alongside their union counterparts to show their sup
port.
Although many TAs, readers, and tutors were pre
sent at the rally, all declined to comment.
Several union members asked their colleagues to
refrain from commenting, citing fears that their legal
matter might be hurt by statements.
But Rayfield expressed confusion about the inci
dent.
"That should not be happening," she said. "We
want people to be talking."
Rayfield added that a gag order had not been
placed on the picketers by the union leadership.
Jason Willoughby, recording secretary of the
UAW at UCLA, said the strike had a significant
turnout.
