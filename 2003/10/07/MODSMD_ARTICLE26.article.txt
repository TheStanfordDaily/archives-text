# University of Maryland trustee criticized for suggestion to double tuition
## 
### JUSTIN FENTON THE DIAMONDBACK 
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK,
Md. A university system trustee and ally
of Gov. Bob Ehrlich set off a storm of criti
cism this weekend after suggesting tuition
should be doubled at Maryland's public uni
versities in order to increase the system's
reputation.
Yesterday, university officials denounced
a proposal from regent and Ehrlich cam
paign fund-raiser Dick Hug that the Univer
sity of Maryland's tuition and fees be in
creased from approximately $6,700 to
$15,000 over the next five to six years, an idea

/
Hug said would generate $6OO million in ad
ditional revenues, encourage students to
graduate faster and create an appearance of
greater prestige.
Though Ehrlich does not endorse the
idea, Hug plans to publicly pitch the idea at
Thursday's Board of Regents finance com
mittee meeting at Towson University.
"I agree with the governor [that the idea
is not favorable] that's the safest thing I
can say," Provost Bill Destler said. "I think
that everybody at the university, at least in
the administrative ranks, is quite concerned
about the rising cost of tuition at the institu
tion, and we're doing everything we can to
limit those increases."

University President Dan Mote refrained
from criticizing Hug, instead saying his ex
treme position "frames the [state funding]
discussion very well."
"It's a bit of a brave statement to be that
far out there by himself," Mote said. "He's
basically raising the question that needs to be
raised: If you want quality programs, who's
going to pay for it? This is a time for people
of the state to make their opinions known."
Added Student Government Association
President Tim Daly: "Regent Hug just
doesn't get it. He doesn't get it that public
higher education is supposed to be for the
public good. This is clearly an example that
his ideology is so out of touch with Maryland

families."
A Sept. 21 editorial in The Baltimore Sun
first introduced Hug's ideas, but The Wash
ington Post picked up the issue this weekend,
including a story in Sunday's editions in
which Ehrlich cast doubt on the possibility of
such increases taking place.
"It's Dick's opinion, and Dick's opinion
only," Ehrlich told the Post. "He hasn't
talked to anyone I know of in the administra
tion. That would be a very dramatic change,
particularly for working-class parents."
Ehrlich spokesman Greg Massoni reiter
ated the governor's position yesterday,
telling The Diamondback that Ehrlich does
not share Hug's views but "appreciates Dick

Hug creatively looking at options."
University tuition increased 21 percent
this fall after sharp funding reductions,
sparking a debate over what role the state
should play in the funding and operations of
the university. In his state of the campus ad
dress, Mote said members of the university
community must start looking for alternate
ways to generate funds, while campus, sys
tem and state officials confirmed that they
are exploring how to free the university from
state regulations.
Sunday, Hug said despite criticism in the
press he has had many people complimenting
him for "raising the issue and putting it out for
debate, which is really what I'm trying to do."
