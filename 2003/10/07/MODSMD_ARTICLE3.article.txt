# High turnout crowds PE classes
## 
### RAGHAV THAPAR 
More than 40 people showed up for
the first day of Phil Marrone's Ad
vanced Beginning Golf class knowing
that only 14 of them would get in. Six of
the remaining students were put on the
waiting list, hoping someone else
would drop the class. The remaining
students were left to try and find an
other golf class or forced to wait anoth

er quarter to hit the greens.
While some athletic classes are rel
atively easy to get into, students who
attempt to take more popular classes
such as golf, Pilates, kickboxing and
yoga have to deal with the possibility of
not being able to take certain classes.
To deal with crowded situations,
the Athletic Department employs a
priority system that gives students in a
designated last-name bracket prefer

ence into a class. However, even hav
ing last-name priority often means
nothing for students, as instructors in
very crowded classes require students
to put their ID cards in a lottery.
Some students feel that the last
name priority system itself makes it dif
ficult to take classes they really want.
"It doesn't seem fair that all athletic
classes have priority in the same quar
ter," Sophomore Shari Ilsen said. "If
different sets of classes have priority
each quarter, people can actually take
classes they want every quarter."
One factor that affects the turnout
for a class is the time it meets. Classes
offered in the mid-afternoon are often
a lot more popular than ones that take
place in the early morning or late after
noon. Nanci Conniff, who teaches
yoga and Pilates, noted that recreation
classes, offered to supplement over
crowded physical education classes,
are harder to fill because of the time
they are offered.
To compensate for student demand
for popular athletic classes, some have
filled past their projected capacity.
Sophomore Lisa He tried unsuccess
fully to get into a Pilates class this fall.
"The room was packed and the in
structor let in 32 people, which was a
lot more than they originally planned
to accept," she said.
One solution to the problem would
be to add more athletic classes and sec
tions — but the department lacks
space for additional classes.

"We have issues with time and
space as anything else," Conniff said.
"At Roble Gym our space and time
are shared with club sports, PE for all
students and programs for faculty and
staff."

Students exercise their abs in a Pilates class in Roble Gym. The popularity of
some of Stanford's athletics courses, such as Pilates, means students must
fight for few available spaces.
