# Special fee refund deadline approaches
## 
### ELYSIA GRUBER 
As the Friday deadline approaches for requesting
special fee refunds, students are logging on to
refund.stanford.edu to ask for their money back.
About 8 percent of undergraduates and 10 percent of
graduates ask for refunds, although the numbers vary
from year to year, said ASSU Financial Manager Kyle
Alisharan. Typically, students ask for about half of the
total fees back, which translates to about 40 percent to 50
percent of the groups listed.
Students vote in the spring of each year on which
groups should receive special fees the following year.
The next year, the fees are distributed by the ASSU.
Those who plan on requesting refunds must do so early
in the academic year.
For some students, the decision to request refunds
from some groups and not from others stems from their

own connection with the groups.
"I chose to get the refund because I needed some
extra money, but I only took away money from groups I
did not affiliate with," said Jay Villegas, a senior who re
ceived a refund of $7B. "I like the flexibility of deciding
where our money goes."
Some students, such as sophomore Elizabeth Call
away, use the refund option as to make a statement.
"It wasn't even the money," Callaway said. "I just got
the money back from organizations that I didn't feel rep
resent me."
Others ask for refunds from groups they feel do not
contribute to the University as a whole.
"I never felt these groups did anything for the Stan
ford Community," sophomore Brian Nguyen said. He
received a refund of about $5O.
