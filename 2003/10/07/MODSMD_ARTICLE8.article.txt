### KARA ROWLAND, WHITNEY GARRISON ANTHONY LAMESA CAVALIER DAILY 
(U-WIRE) CHARLOTTESVILLE,
Va. University of Virginia police and local law
enforcement officials announced Friday the in
dictment of 33 people including former and
current university students and employees - for
alleged involvement with the illegal sale of nar
cotics. A total of 15 of the suspects had been ar
rested in Charlottesville, Va., as of 2:00 p.m. Fri
day. All but two charges filed against the suspects

are felonies.
Of the 33 indicted suspects, three are universi
ty employees, eight are non-students, seven are
former students and 15 are current students. Eight
of the 15 people arrested Thursday night are cur
rent students, according to statistics released by
the university's police.
The indictments were the result of a 15-month
undercover investigation, titled "Operation
Spring Break Down," conducted by the Jefferson
Area Drug Enforcement Task Force in Virginia.
JADE is composed of local and University Po
lice officers as well as agents from the Federal Bu

reau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobac
co and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement
Agency. The coalition was formed in 1995.
Over the course of the investigation, JADE
seized drugs including marijuana, cocaine, opium,
ecstasy and Psilocybin Mushrooms with an esti
mated street value of at least $20,000.
The remaining suspects are being sought in
other states as well as overseas, said Lt. Don
Campbell, JADE task force coordinator.
"It's not going to be real long until we find the
remaining suspects," Campbell said.
In a press conference at Scott Sta
dium Friday, University Police Chief
Paul E. Norris, Jr. said the operation
was aided by tips from within the
University.
"Most of the information that led
to this investigation was provided by
University students and staff," Nor
ris said.
Charlottesville City Police Capt.
Chip Harding said Operation Spring
Break Down is focused on appre
hending narcotics dealers, not con
sumers.
Though some of the suspects know
each other, authorities stressed that
the accused are not part of one drug
ring.
Suspects were arrested in a vari
ety of locations including bars, City
Hall and local residences, starting
around 7 p.m. Thursday and ending
after 2 a.m. Friday, Campbell said.
"We knew who the people were,"
Campbell said, adding that none of
suspects attempted to resist arrest.
"We did not anticipate any problems
and we had no problems."
Agents secured warrants from
both Albemarle County and Char
lottesville grand juries in Virginia,
using evidence obtained by under
cover detectives who set up drug
purchases with suspects and secretly
videotaped the transactions.
Some suspects currently are re
leased on bail, which averaged
$2,500 but varied according to the
type and amount of the drugs in
volved, according to Campbell, who
notes that sentencing likewise will
vary with the drug.
"Some of them could get 12
months maximum, some of them
could get 20 years," he said, adding
that he doubts any of the suspects

would receive the maximum sen
tence.
Campbell said agents had pos
sessed enough evidence to make the
arrests for some time, and that there
was no reason in particular that the
sting occurred Thursday night. Offi
cers who made the arrests were split
into five teams, with about five or six
officers in each.
Officials at the magistrate's office
decline to say when the arrested in
dividuals will appear in court.
If any of the students arrested are
convicted, University Judiciary
Committee Chair Alexis Gregorian
said a dean or the police can bring
charges against them under either
standard two or ten of the Universi
ty standard code of conduct.
"If accused of a standard ten vio
lation, they would have to prove how
any sort of drug violation would af
fect the pursuit of the University's
proper academic goals," Gregorian
said.
She added that violations of stan
dard two could be charged regarding
the violation of the health and safety
of members of the University com
munity.
For the 15 University students
who were indicted, JADE detec
tives sent each a letter inviting the
suspect to join a secret society,
"Zeta Tau," instructing the recipi
ent to meet near the Rotunda
Thursday evening. Five students re
sponded to the letter and were
asked for identification to verify
their invitations to join the society.
The five then were escorted into a
van decorated with an insignia for
the supposed secret society. Under
cover agents drove the suspects to
City Hall, where they were informed
that they were under arrest.
Campbell joked that the name
"Zeta Tau" stood for "Zero Toler
ance."
Fifth-year engineering student
Eric W. Reid was one of the students
arrested at City Hall. Reid said he

thinks the ruse was a "horrible use"
of the University's secret society tra
dition, adding that he plans to plead
not guilty to his charges.
Reid claims his arrest was a prod
uct of racial profiling.
The police "assumed since I was a
black man driving around in a BMW
that I used drug money to purchase
it," he said. "The truth is that my
mother bought me that car."
Other suspects were apprehend
ed later that night.
Fourth-year college student
Omeed Jafari was at the Buddhist
Biker Bar from about 11 p.m. until
closing time Thursday night. Jafari
said he saw three JADE agents run
upstairs while two stood by the door.
"I think they knew exactly who and
what they were looking for," he said.
Jafari adds that there were ru
mors spreading about people getting
arrested, but the bar remained full
until close.
"I don't think it had any bearing
on people that night," Jafari sid. "I
think they were just shocked to see
ATF agents and not just police walk
ing around."
Mellow Mushroom Manager An
drew Irby was off-duty Thursday
night but was patronizing the estab
lishment at the time of the arrests on
the Corner.
"We were sitting at the bar and
these cops roll up seven deep or so.
Our bartender met them halfway,"
he said.
Irby adds that the officers asked
the bartender for specific people.
The bartender said he did not think
that they were there. Then, Irby said,
one of the JADE agents shined a
flashlight in the face of one of the
cooks and said, "That's him." Irby
adds, however, that the agent was
mistaken and the cook was left
alone.
Slaughter said he helped the
JADE agents narrow down their
search to two bars by observing that
a companion of one suspect was car

rying a glass mug. Both O'Neill's
Pub and The Biltmore Grill offer
"mug night" Thursdays.
Sarah Aquilome, a manager at
O'Neills, was off-duty Thursday
night but had stopped by the bar just
before the police came.
"They were just walking through
looking for people," she said. "They
had a list but they didn't find any
one" at O'Neills.
Aquilome said everyone left
when they saw the agents. As she ex
ited the bar, she said she saw one
man get arrested outside on the
street. According to Aquilome, the
suspect did not run but seemed con
fused when the JADE agents hand
cuffed him.
Andrew Otto, Assistant General
Manager at The Biltmore Grill, was
on duty Thursday night.
"Our stance on this is to make no
comment on anything that happened
that night," Otto said. "We aren't
going to make any more of it."
Slaughter confirms that the
JADE agents found the suspects for
whom they had been searching at
The Biltmore Grill and made the ar
rests there.
Though several of the eight stu
dents arrested are members of a fra
ternity, Greg Moore, Interfraternity
Council vice president for member
ship, said their alleged actions are
not representative of the present
state of Greek life at the University
because of the small number of fra
ternity members involved.
"I'd be a little more concerned if
there was a third or a ton of fraterni
ty members involved," Moore said.
"One or two doesn't matter. Those
were individuals acting on their own
free will."
Moore adds that the recent drug
bust bears no resemblance to the
1991 University drug raid, dubbed
"Operation Equinox," which result
ed in the seizure of three fraternity
houses by federal law enforcement
officials.

(U-WIRE) CHARLOTTESVILLE,
Va. University of Virginia police and local law
enforcement officials announced Friday the in
dictment of 33 people including former and
current university students and employees - for
alleged involvement with the illegal sale of nar
cotics. A total of 15 of the suspects had been ar
rested in Charlottesville, Va., as of 2:00 p.m. Fri
day. All but two charges filed against the suspects

are felonies.
Of the 33 indicted suspects, three are universi
ty employees, eight are non-students, seven are
former students and 15 are current students. Eight
of the 15 people arrested Thursday night are cur
rent students, according to statistics released by
the university's police.
The indictments were the result of a 15-month
undercover investigation, titled "Operation
Spring Break Down," conducted by the Jefferson
Area Drug Enforcement Task Force in Virginia.
JADE is composed of local and University Po
lice officers as well as agents from the Federal Bu

reau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobac
co and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement
Agency. The coalition was formed in 1995.
Over the course of the investigation, JADE
seized drugs including marijuana, cocaine, opium,
ecstasy and Psilocybin Mushrooms with an esti
mated street value of at least $20,000.
The remaining suspects are being sought in
other states as well as overseas, said Lt. Don
Campbell, JADE task force coordinator.
"It's not going to be real long until we find the
remaining suspects," Campbell said.
In a press conference at Scott Sta
dium Friday, University Police Chief
Paul E. Norris, Jr. said the operation
was aided by tips from within the
University.
"Most of the information that led
to this investigation was provided by
University students and staff," Nor
ris said.
Charlottesville City Police Capt.
Chip Harding said Operation Spring
Break Down is focused on appre
hending narcotics dealers, not con
sumers.
Though some of the suspects know
each other, authorities stressed that
the accused are not part of one drug
ring.
Suspects were arrested in a vari
ety of locations including bars, City
Hall and local residences, starting
around 7 p.m. Thursday and ending
after 2 a.m. Friday, Campbell said.
"We knew who the people were,"
Campbell said, adding that none of
suspects attempted to resist arrest.
"We did not anticipate any problems
and we had no problems."
Agents secured warrants from
both Albemarle County and Char
lottesville grand juries in Virginia,
using evidence obtained by under
cover detectives who set up drug
purchases with suspects and secretly
videotaped the transactions.
Some suspects currently are re
leased on bail, which averaged
$2,500 but varied according to the
type and amount of the drugs in
volved, according to Campbell, who
notes that sentencing likewise will
vary with the drug.
"Some of them could get 12
months maximum, some of them
could get 20 years," he said, adding
that he doubts any of the suspects

would receive the maximum sen
tence.
Campbell said agents had pos
sessed enough evidence to make the
arrests for some time, and that there
was no reason in particular that the
sting occurred Thursday night. Offi
cers who made the arrests were split
into five teams, with about five or six
officers in each.
Officials at the magistrate's office
decline to say when the arrested in
dividuals will appear in court.
If any of the students arrested are
convicted, University Judiciary
Committee Chair Alexis Gregorian
said a dean or the police can bring
charges against them under either
standard two or ten of the Universi
ty standard code of conduct.
"If accused of a standard ten vio
lation, they would have to prove how
any sort of drug violation would af
fect the pursuit of the University's
proper academic goals," Gregorian
said.
She added that violations of stan
dard two could be charged regarding
the violation of the health and safety
of members of the University com
munity.
For the 15 University students
who were indicted, JADE detec
tives sent each a letter inviting the
suspect to join a secret society,
"Zeta Tau," instructing the recipi
ent to meet near the Rotunda
Thursday evening. Five students re
sponded to the letter and were
asked for identification to verify
their invitations to join the society.
The five then were escorted into a
van decorated with an insignia for
the supposed secret society. Under
cover agents drove the suspects to
City Hall, where they were informed
that they were under arrest.
Campbell joked that the name
"Zeta Tau" stood for "Zero Toler
ance."
Fifth-year engineering student
Eric W. Reid was one of the students
arrested at City Hall. Reid said he

thinks the ruse was a "horrible use"
of the University's secret society tra
dition, adding that he plans to plead
not guilty to his charges.
Reid claims his arrest was a prod
uct of racial profiling.
The police "assumed since I was a
black man driving around in a BMW
that I used drug money to purchase
it," he said. "The truth is that my
mother bought me that car."
Other suspects were apprehend
ed later that night.
Fourth-year college student
Omeed Jafari was at the Buddhist
Biker Bar from about 11 p.m. until
closing time Thursday night. Jafari
said he saw three JADE agents run
upstairs while two stood by the door.
"I think they knew exactly who and
what they were looking for," he said.
Jafari adds that there were ru
mors spreading about people getting
arrested, but the bar remained full
until close.
"I don't think it had any bearing
on people that night," Jafari sid. "I
think they were just shocked to see
ATF agents and not just police walk
ing around."
