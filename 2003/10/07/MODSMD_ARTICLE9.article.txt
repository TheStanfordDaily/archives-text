## Tongue slashing, plaque cultures & other science fads 
### AMIT GARG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Laziness no longer only reason not to
brush teeth
Science and art came together when
Montana State University hosted the first
Bioglyphs, an exhibition of bioluminescent
paintings. Biofilms are composed of bacte
ria that take on different characteristics
when they grow as a film. Dental plaque is
one example. To come up with the exhibit
undergraduate and graduate students
thought up designs and cultured bacteria
accordingly. "[Artists and researchers] had
to learn how to paint with this 'invisible ink',
so we all worked together learning how to
paint with this new medium," said Peg
Dirckx, a visual communicator at the Cen
ter for Biofilm Engineering. Subsequent ex
hibits are planned for the future.
But it could be good for pleasing your
partner
The latest fad among some thrill seekers
is slashing your tongue so it will look more
serpentine. And that has not only parents
but quite a few doctors worried. Piercing
your tongue is bad enough; cutting it into
two has a very high risk of infection and un
controlled bleeding. You may also need to
leam to talk again since the tongue is im
portant in forming pretty much all sound.
Legislators in Illinois are considering a bill
that would require the procedure to be per
formed only by medical professionals. At
the moment estimates are that 500 to 2,000
people have had their tongues split.
What if they could make beer cans out
of this stuff?
Researchers at Princeton have discov
ered that electron spin and electron-elec
tron interactions are responsible for the
cooling power in sodium cobalt oxide. In
1997, Japanese researchers discovered
material made with this compound had
nearly 10 times the cooling capacity of or
dinary metals. The Princeton team ap
plied a magnetic field in the plane of the
material and observed that the electrons
were trapped. "This finding is exceptional
because it is rare to see a field alter the
magnitude of the thermopower, let alone
suppress it to zero," said Phaun Ong, lead
author of the study. Cooling power is es
pecially important for devices that convert
electricity into heat and vice-versa, such as
refrigerators.
Earth gets gassy
Future climate changes will be more
rapid according to scientists at the Hadley
Center for Climate in the United King
dom. The study modeled both carbon and
sulfur cycles, along with natural forcings
due to solar changes and volcanic activi
ties. Previous studies failed to account for
the natural forcings that are critical for the
global climate and that have alleviated the
greenhouse effect. That respite is tempo
rary though, according to the researchers.
They predict that human emissions of car
bon are and will continue decreasing in the
21st century but that the carbon that has
been accumulating in the soil will be re
leased into the atmosphere. They caution
that the worst climate changes may occur
even after humans have reduced gas emis
sions.
Beware high-speed jets of material
Astronomers are baffled by a new image
from the Hubble showing high-speed jets of
material flowing out from a nebula. The jets
are rushing outward at about 4 million kilo
meters per hour, faster than any other
known jet. The nebula, named Henize 3-
1475, is a planetary nebula (but actually has
nothing to do with planets, it just look likes
planets to early observers looking through
telescopes) about 18,000 light years away.
The central star responsible for the jets is
more than 12,000 times as luminous as our
sun and weights three to five times more.
Astronomers speculate the jets might be
due to an invisible companion star or a
cyclic magnetic process.
Brazil: where animals go to die
The Brazilian government released last
month a new list of endangered species.
This list has 395 entries: 160 birds, 96 in
sects, 69 mammals, 34 invertebrates, 20 rep
tiles and 16 amphibians. It does not even in
clude aquatic animals. The previous list
from 1989 counted 219. Not all is pessimism
some animals in the previous list like the
black caiman, the wild cat and the harpy
eagle are not on the new list because their
populations have recovered. On the other
hand, many other species are now threat
ened, including primates, many species of
butterflies, insects, spiders and snakes.
"Brazilian fauna is not being cared for,"
said Marina Silva, Minister of the Environ
ment, citing deforestation and human en
croachment as the primary problems. Brazil
has the biggest biodiversity in the world,
cradling almost l/3rd of all living species.
