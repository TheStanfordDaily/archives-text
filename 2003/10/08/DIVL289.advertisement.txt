WITHOUT EMPLOYER SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND
RESERVE, IT MIGHT NOT GET OFF THE GROUND.
As the American military gets smaller, the role of the National Guard and Reserve has never been
greater â€”and the support of their employers never more critical.
The Guard and Reserve make up half of today's military forces. Along with being trained and ready
for combat, they support peacekeeping missions, rescue operations and humanitarian relief efforts. As soldiers,
sailors, airmen and Marines, they'll be in a position to serve our country. As their employer, so will you.
For more information on how you as an employer can help,
contact your state committee at our web site: www.esgr.org.
