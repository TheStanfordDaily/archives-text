Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who lost his life to terrorists in Pakistan,
was not only a journalist but also an avid musician who carried his mission of dialogue
through words and music in all his travels. In every city he lived, he joined a band,
orchestra or chamber group and made new friends through his passion for music, friend
ship and humanity. The Daniel Pearl Foundation (www.danielpearl.org) is encouraging
a celebration of Danny's birthday by music-making worldwide. The Office for Religious
Life and Chamber Music LIVE! at Stanford will join musicians around the globe in pre
senting the second annual Daniel Pearl Music Day.
Daniel Pearl graduated from Stanford in 1985 with a bachelor's degree in communica
tion. At a memorial at Stanford last winter, Danny's classmates remembered him as a
magnificent violinist, whose music and writing both reflected, "precision, intensity, soul
fulness, gentleness, compassion from within."
