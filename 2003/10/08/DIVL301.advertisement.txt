The Program In Ethics In Society
The Program in Ethics in Society is designed to foster scholarship, teaching and reflec
tion of fundamental issues in personal and public life. The program is grounded in
moral and political philosophy, but it extends its concerns across a broad range of tradi
tional disciplinary domains. The program is guided by the idea that ethical though has
application to current social questions and conflicts, and it seeks to encourage moral
reflection and practice in areas such as international relations, politics, science, medi
cine, law and business.
