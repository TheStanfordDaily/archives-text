## Davis recalled, Schwarzenegger elected 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected
governor of California last night following the recall of
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.
With 56 percent of precincts reporting as of press
time, 54 percent of the ballots cast (2,328,062) voted to
recall Davis, with 1,980,304 voting against the recall.
Schwarzenegger was the choice to replace Davis on
1,945,754 ballots (50 percent), compared to 1,293,364
(33 percent) for Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, 529,259 (14
percent) for Republican state Sen. Tom McClintock
and 105,160 (3 percent) for Green Party candidate
Peter Camejo.
"I came here with absolutely nothing, and Califor
nia has given me absolutely everything," Schwarzeng
ger said in his victory speech. "I will do everything I can
to live up to that trust. I will not fail you, I will not dis
appoint you, and I will not let you down."
Bustamante, who was elected to his lieutenant gov
ernorship in 2002, said last night that he will serve the
remaining three years of his term.
"You meet on the battlefield and fight your battles,
but when the battle is done you have to be able to work
for the people of California," he said.
While California chose to banish its governor 11
months into his second term, it resoundingly chose to
retain the collection and use of racial data by govern
ment agencies. Proposition 54, which sought to ban the
state from collecting racial and ethnic data, was voted
down by 62 percent of the electorate (2,559,616 votes
against, 1,577,406 votes for).
Voters turned out in force to take part in what be
came California's first gubernatorial recall and only the
second in American history. The Secretary of State's
office estimated a 60 percent voter turnout, up from the
50.7 percent who voted in last November's gubernato
rial election.
"Tonight the voters did decide it's time for someone
else to serve, and I accept their judgment," Davis said
in his concession speech. "I'm calling on everyone to
put chaos and division behind us and do what's right for
this great state of California."
Schwarzenegger, an Austrian immigrant and action
movie star, was successful in his first run at public of
fice. Bustamante, a moderate Democrat from the cen
tral valley with a history of terse relations with Davis,
was seeking to become the state's first Hispanic gover
nor since 1875.
By 9:30 p.m. last night, McClintock had conceded
defeat and Schwarzenegger's camp had kicked off its
victory party as early results were resoundingly in the
governor-elect's favor. Davis conceded shortly after 10

Yesterday, Gray Davis became the first governor to be recalled in California
state history.

Similarly, Bustamante has said he
is willing to work with the governor
elect.
Schwarzenegger's campaign
spent $21.5 million of the total
$75 million spent by recall candi
dates, including approximately
$lO million of his own money. It
cost the state $67 million to hold

the election.
Proposition 53, an initiative that
would have set aside 1 percent of the
state budget to rebuild infrastruc
ture every year beginning in 2006,
was voted down by 64 percent of
California voters (2,542,392 votes
against, 1,414,121 votes for).
The only other gubernatorial re
call occurred in 1921, when North
Dakota recalled potato farmer Lynn
Frazier after the wheat market col
lapsed. He bounced back from his
recall to win a U.S. Senate seat in the
1922 elections, and went on to serve
four terms.
