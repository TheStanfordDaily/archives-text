## Bookstore refunds unflexible 
### 
While this may come as a surprise to
some students, today is the last day to
return textbooks that were bought on
the first day of the quarter at the Stan
ford Bookstore and students who buy textbooks
after today will only have one week to return them.
This is a change from previous years' policy that al
lowed returns right up until the drop deadline, and we
firmly oppose the Stanford Bookstore's new policy.
The obvious problem with this policy change is
that it will disrupt the shopping period that many
Stanford students take advantage of every year. In
the past, students could buy books for all the classes
they were shopping, knowing that they would be able
to return them if they decided not to take the class be
fore the drop deadline. Unfortunately, this will no
longer be possible.
The shopping period generally helps students find
classes that are the best fit for them. However, it is
now harder to take full advantage of this period of
early-quarter exploration. Now, students will be
forced to go to class without purchasing books, hop
ing that they can understand what's going on, or, con
versely, take the risk of buying books they will be un
able to return if they drop a class.
Not only is this policy at odds with Stanford's

shopping period, but there has been very little adver
tisement about the policy change. While the return
date is printed on Bookstore receipts and on signs in
the store, many students will not notice this change
unless their attention is specifically directed to the
new return date. Instead, they will probably assume
that returns can be made until the drop deadline.
Though the Bookstore is a business, it's also a part
of campus that depends on students for much of its
success. While we recognize that it must function as a
business, it must be amenable to student needs be
cause it holds a near-monopoly on the textbook mar
ket at Stanford.
Furthermore, the new policy puts the Bookstore's
return policy behind similar return policies at Bor
ders and Barnes and Noble which accept returns
for up to a month after the purchase date. This is
alarming, given that the Bookstore should be a busi
ness that caters to student needs. For that reason, its
policies should be designed to make sense within the
campus community. Even though the Bookstore is
independent of the University, it still has a responsi
bility to provide the community with an adequate
standard of service and convenience. We urge book
store managers to consider the needs of their cus
tomers and change this policy immediately.
