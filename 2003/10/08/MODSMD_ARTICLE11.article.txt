# Libraries should stay open late
## 
### 
As the quarter picks up and students
begin looking for late-night study loca
tions, they might be disappointed to
learn few options exist. Green Library
continues to close promptly at midnight, forcing
students to use the less-than-ideal 24-hour study
room at Meyer Library. We think this should
change, and we write this Editorial early in the
hopes that Green Library's hours are changed be
fore the most trying weeks of the quarter Dead
Week and finals week arrive.
This year, in contrast to previous years, Green
is no longer offering extended hours during the
quarter's peak study weeks. Whereas students
have previously been allowed to study until 2
a.m. during these vitally important weeks, the
doors of Stanford's main research library will
now close at midnight with no exceptions.
Unless the University is seriously out-of-touch
with students' study habits and believes students
finish studying for finals at the stroke of mid
night, we believe there is no legitimate explana
tion for this change of policy.
Understandably, the recession has forced Stan
ford to trim budgets and cut certain services. Ac
cording to Library administrators, a University man

date to reduce expenses made it impossible for
Green to pay the staff needed for it to offer extend
ed hours. Yet an elite institution such as Stanford,
with its endowment of nearly $9 billion should place
a priority on student learning and decent library ac
cess for students.
While other top universities such as Columbia,
Duke and Johns Hopkins offer students an array of
late-night study options, Stanford offers a single
room. And the Meyer 24-hour study lounge, with its
badly worn tables, fluorescent lighting and lack of re
source materials, is not a sufficient resource for the
roughly 18,000 undergraduate, graduate and profes
sional students who might need to study at Stanford
past midnight.
Green sets its hours at the start of each quar
ter based on its available budget. With finals
studying still months away, we urge University
officials to seriously consider extending Green's
hours for the end of this quarter. In light of all the
potential services on campus that could be cut, li
brary hours seem like they should be one of the
last things to go. Access to an adequate study
space is such a fundamental part of student learn
ing; we hope that the University will adequately
meet this need come December.
