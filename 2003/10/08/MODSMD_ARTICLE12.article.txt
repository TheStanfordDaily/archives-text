## Fraternities contribute to campus 
### ANDREW DAVIDSON JOEL GEDALIUS 
While it may be easy to stereotype
Greek organizations (especially of
the housed variety) as beer-swilling
fratties and non-academically orient
ed slackers, the Row simply would
not exist without its Greek heritage.
Residents of La Maison
would have nowhere to live if Pi Phi
hadn't built the house early in the
20th century. Grove May

field residents and the Row
Office itself would have to re
locate if it weren't for the
Theta Delts. The majority of
the houses on the Row were
built by Greeks and deeded
over to the University (for lit
tle or no financial compensa
tion) when numbers dwin
dled or, in the case of the
sororities, the university out
lawed them.
Awarding a house to a
Greek organization does re
duce the total number of
spots on the row available to

non-Greek students. How-
ever, the 34 spots that were
lost to the general student popula
tion last year pales in comparison to
the benefits a housed fraternity of
fers. Since moving into 592 Mayfield
one year ago, Phi Kappa Psi has
sponsored two blood drives, at
which we achieved a participation
rate from our residents that was
greater than 98 percent. Having a
convenient and central meeting
space in our house has helped im
measurably in putting on the Phi Psi
500, held in conjunction with Kappa
Kappa Gamma, which raised over

$l,OOO for the Urban Ministry of
Palo Alto. We sponsor Row Tutor
ing, a drop-in project in which our
brothers offer peer tutoring free of
charge to residents of the Row. As
an organization, we volunteer 500
man-hours of community service
each year. What row house can say
that each one of its residents has
given 10 hours of his or her life to
community service in the past sever
al months?

Having a house has helped Phi
Kappa Psi in more ways than just or
ganizational planning and efficiency.
Having our house gives us a venue to
display the end product of our annu
al Phi Psi Arts Scholarship, which
enables Stanford students to realize
their artistic potential. Without a
house we would have a much more
difficult time putting on our Speaker
Series which highlights the best and
the brightest professors and re
searchers at Stanford in a cozy envi
ronment. Having the house also en

ables us to put on quality social pro
gramming, such as bringing Pseudo
pod to the student body free of
charge. Without freshman and four
class dorm parties, it's soon going to
be apparent that Greek organiza
tions, especially of the housed vari
ety, are responsible for the majority
of campus social life.
As an organization, we are ex
tremely grateful to be housed again
after 26 years of surviving as an un

housed group. We recognize
that our house is a privilege
and not a right, and we are
sympathetic to the concerns
of the students. We open up
our public spaces to student
groups such as the Stanford
Knitting Club, which used
our lounge spaces each
Wednesday night last year.
While it is true that Phi
Kappa Psi moving into 592
Mayfield (which was built by
Alpha Tau Omega around
1914) precludes several
Stanford students from liv
ing on the row, it's important
to note that we are not just
taking up space on the Row.

We're doing the most that we can
with what we have and hope that our
dedication and contributions to cam
pus life can justify our status as a
housed fraternity.
