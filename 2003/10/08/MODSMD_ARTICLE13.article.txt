# OPINIONS
## NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER Let's be accountable, people 
### 
Every once in a blue moon,
our lovely student govern
ment body, the ASSU, pre
sents an idea or a plan to
improve student lives. When this
random act finally works its way
through the system (no offense to
my good friends in the ASSU), the
student body goes through several
stages. The first is shock. (Gasp! The
ASSU is actually doing something?
Wait, I didn't even know we had a
student government!) Next: denial.
(It just can't be it must've been a
typo in The Daily). And lastly, ac
ceptance. (No, The Daily wouldn't
he to me ... right?)
Then time goes by, and we all for
get anything ever happened. A few
months later we hear that something
went wrong and it didn't work out.
Still rummaging through your pock
ets for those damn quarters, right?
What ever happened to that

flat-fee laundry plan?
Maybe you hated it. Maybe
you didn't like the idea of giv
ing the University even more
control over your life. But you
know what we can't leave
it at that, my dear mates. We
have to learn from some inter
national lessons and you
don't have to be an interna
tional relations major to know
that flaking out is not the way
to go in life.
Let's take some larger issues
as examples bigger fish, if
you will and consider the
ever-looming predicament of
global climate change. Perhaps
you like the idea of warmer wa
ters; after all, wouldn't it be nice
to swim in Half Moon Bay with
out developing hypothermia?

Yet what is good for one soul isn't
necessarily good for another. Case in
point: It is predicted that nearly half
of all of the coral reefs in the beauti
ful Great Barrier Reef here in Aus
tralia could be wiped out if the waters
become too warm. Think about it:
Your kids may never get to see the
beautiful sea anemones or the intri
cate coral structures.
So what are our governments
both Australian and American
doing about this imminent problem?
The United States seemed almost
ready to sign the Kyoto Convention
Protocol, an incentive-based agree
ment that would help control the
production of carbon dioxide
through programs like tradable
emissions permits. We didn't sign it.
Ironically, even though the ef

fects of warmer
oceans will unfor
tunately devastate
its iconic coral
reefs, neither did
Australia. So even
though we, as
wealthy, devel
oped countries,
believe we have
the right to be an
international

policing force, we refuse to sign the
treaties until developing countries
sign them. But they won't sign them
until larger countries agree to ratifi
cation. Sounds like a case of Catch
-22 to me.
And even with the most conser
vative estimates, the ramifications of
global climate change are not insub
stantial. The little seaside condo in
the Caribbean that you have your

eyes on once you finish law school
and make the big bucks? It might be
underwater by the time you have the
money to buy it.
Or let's talk about the Anti-To
bacco Initiative: Health Czar, a.k.a.
Secretary of Health and Human Ser
vices, Tommy Thompson, promised
Americans this May that we would
have our John Hancock on that in
ternational effort to crack down on
tobacco advertising. Hmm, whatev
er happened to that? After its ap
proval by the United Nations, 192
countries ratified it. Need I tell you
what the United States did? Have
our buddies over at Philip Morris,
despite their warm and fuzzy adver
tisements, "suggested" to our gov
ernment officials that signing the
treaty may not be such a great idea?

It makes me sad to think that we
would rather protect our commer
cial interests rather than prevent to
bacco-related deaths later on.
Tobacco companies are slyly
switching their advertising contracts
from developed countries with
their harsh anti-tobacco laws and
costly lawsuits —to less developed
nations. This means that young kids
in countries with softer marketing
laws will once again be exposed to Joe
Camel and the Marlboro Man, and
the health care costs associated with
smoking are just too much for many
nations to handle socially and eco
nomically. This treaty is not just
about protecting American citizens.
It is about preventing cancer world
wide.
What does it come down to? Ac
countability. I know, I know, you're
sick of that word. Every candidate

seems to toss it around when
elections creep up on us, but de
spite its abuse, it is still a valu
able term. And one that we
should really take more seri
ously.
So back to that laundry
plan. Clearly, this isn't really an
issue worthy of too many of
your thoughts, but it is yet an
other lesson to add to our fold
ers. We have to hold our lead
ers accountable for their
promises whether it's the
ASSU or the President of the
United States. I know that
these international agreements
are a lot more complicated than
they appear, but if countries
like the United States and Aus
tralia are going to sit on their
high horses, "empowering"
other countries by "helping"

them create democratic govern
ments, then we should also be re
sponsible when it comes to environ
mental and health issues even
when they might come at a cost to
some of our most powerful industries.
This isn't to say that we should
jump at every opportunity and sign
international treaties that may not
be feasible, but there are so many
countries willing to make sacrifices
in order to preserve the environment
and prevent health problems. Why
can't we do the same?

Want to see some pictures of the Stan
ford in Australia group at the Great
Barrier Reef? If the warmer waters end
up killing these reefs, these pics might be
worth millions someday! E-mail

typo in The Daily). And lastly, ac
ceptance. (No, The Daily wouldn't
he to me ... right?)
Then time goes by, and we all for
get anything ever happened. A few
months later we hear that something
went wrong and it didn't work out.
Still rummaging through your pock
ets for those damn quarters, right?
What ever happened to that

flat-fee laundry plan?
Maybe you hated it. Maybe
you didn't like the idea of giv
ing the University even more
control over your life. But you
know what we can't leave
it at that, my dear mates. We
have to learn from some inter
national lessons and you
don't have to be an interna
tional relations major to know
that flaking out is not the way
to go in life.
Let's take some larger issues
as examples bigger fish, if
you will and consider the
ever-looming predicament of
global climate change. Perhaps
you like the idea of warmer wa
ters; after all, wouldn't it be nice
to swim in Half Moon Bay with
out developing hypothermia?

Yet what is good for one soul isn't
necessarily good for another. Case in
point: It is predicted that nearly half
of all of the coral reefs in the beauti
ful Great Barrier Reef here in Aus
tralia could be wiped out if the waters
become too warm. Think about it:
Your kids may never get to see the
beautiful sea anemones or the intri
cate coral structures.
So what are our governments
both Australian and American
doing about this imminent problem?
The United States seemed almost
ready to sign the Kyoto Convention
Protocol, an incentive-based agree
ment that would help control the
production of carbon dioxide
through programs like tradable
emissions permits. We didn't sign it.
Ironically, even though the ef

fects of warmer
oceans will unfor
tunately devastate
its iconic coral
reefs, neither did
Australia. So even
though we, as
wealthy, devel
oped countries,
believe we have
the right to be an
international

policing force, we refuse to sign the
treaties until developing countries
sign them. But they won't sign them
until larger countries agree to ratifi
cation. Sounds like a case of Catch
-22 to me.
And even with the most conser
vative estimates, the ramifications of
global climate change are not insub
stantial. The little seaside condo in
the Caribbean that you have your

eyes on once you finish law school
and make the big bucks? It might be
underwater by the time you have the
money to buy it.
Or let's talk about the Anti-To
bacco Initiative: Health Czar, a.k.a.
Secretary of Health and Human Ser
vices, Tommy Thompson, promised
Americans this May that we would
have our John Hancock on that in
ternational effort to crack down on
tobacco advertising. Hmm, whatev
er happened to that? After its ap
proval by the United Nations, 192
countries ratified it. Need I tell you
what the United States did? Have
our buddies over at Philip Morris,
despite their warm and fuzzy adver
tisements, "suggested" to our gov
ernment officials that signing the
treaty may not be such a great idea?

It makes me sad to think that we
would rather protect our commer
cial interests rather than prevent to
bacco-related deaths later on.
Tobacco companies are slyly
switching their advertising contracts
from developed countries with
their harsh anti-tobacco laws and
costly lawsuits —to less developed
nations. This means that young kids
in countries with softer marketing
laws will once again be exposed to Joe
Camel and the Marlboro Man, and
the health care costs associated with
smoking are just too much for many
nations to handle socially and eco
nomically. This treaty is not just
about protecting American citizens.
It is about preventing cancer world
wide.
What does it come down to? Ac
countability. I know, I know, you're
sick of that word. Every candidate

seems to toss it around when
elections creep up on us, but de
spite its abuse, it is still a valu
able term. And one that we
should really take more seri
ously.
So back to that laundry
plan. Clearly, this isn't really an
issue worthy of too many of
your thoughts, but it is yet an
other lesson to add to our fold
ers. We have to hold our lead
ers accountable for their
promises whether it's the
ASSU or the President of the
United States. I know that
these international agreements
are a lot more complicated than
they appear, but if countries
like the United States and Aus
tralia are going to sit on their
high horses, "empowering"
other countries by "helping"

them create democratic govern
ments, then we should also be re
sponsible when it comes to environ
mental and health issues even
when they might come at a cost to
some of our most powerful industries.
This isn't to say that we should
jump at every opportunity and sign
international treaties that may not
be feasible, but there are so many
countries willing to make sacrifices
in order to preserve the environment
and prevent health problems. Why
can't we do the same?

ford in Australia group at the Great
Barrier Reef? If the warmer waters end
up killing these reefs, these pics might be
worth millions someday! E-mail

Every once in a blue moon,
our lovely student govern
ment body, the ASSU, pre
sents an idea or a plan to
improve student lives. When this
random act finally works its way
through the system (no offense to
my good friends in the ASSU), the
student body goes through several
stages. The first is shock. (Gasp! The
ASSU is actually doing something?
Wait, I didn't even know we had a
student government!) Next: denial.
(It just can't be it must've been a
typo in The Daily). And lastly, ac
ceptance. (No, The Daily wouldn't
he to me ... right?)
