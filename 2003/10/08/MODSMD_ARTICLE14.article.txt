Houses on probation cramp
party scene
The University should remember
that when they place multiple houses
(Theta-Delt, 680, and Xanadu) on
probation, it closes down potential
social outlets for all students, and
consequently floods any party that
actually does get held. The crowding
makes it harder for the hosts to en
force any rules without guest-lists,
lines, and pushy hired muscle. Some
times you have to wait more than 30
minutes to get in to a party under
these conditions unless you know
someone living in the host house. So
social activity not only becomes un
certain, but elitist and blatantly exclu
sive as well.
Also, waiting in line for any party
just plain sucks. Standing there,
wishing the hired muscle ("securi
ty") would stop herding you and
threatening to turn the whole crowd
away if people didn't stop pushing: It
just sucks. Furthermore, I wish that
someone (Jane Camarillo? John
Bravman? John Etchemendy?)
would take responsibility for the
new policy and the new brand of en
forcement. Then students and ad
ministrators might sit down, discuss
it, and make real progress. As it
stands, responsibility is divided
among so many that it is nearly im
possible to even know to whom we
might address our complaints.

To 'celebrate' or not to
celebrate
In reference to Matan Shacham's
letter to the Daily on Oct. 7 ("Yom
Kippur a 'solemn day' "), no deep
ignorance of the Jewish faith has
been demonstrated at all. In fact, if
Shacham had done a few minutes of

research on the Web, he would have
discovered that the very first defini
tion of the word "celebrate" in Web
ster's dictionary is "to perform (a
sacrament or solemn ceremony)
publicly and with appropriate rites."

A defense of David Blaine's
'bland' stunt
I don't think Jennie Kim fully
understands David Blaine as a per
former or as a person ("Magic is lost
in Blaine's bland stunt," Oct. 6).
She says that the face of magic is
changing, and that the days of flashy
showmanship are waning. Though
this may be true, the sense of mys
tery in magic is by no means becom
ing passe, as she later asserts.
Younger artists sometimes take
magic to the streets in their efforts
to make it more approachable, af
fordable, or what have you, but in
no way does that mean that the mys
tery of magic is gone. In some ways,
that up-close-and-personal style
makes the experience all the more
believable; the tricks are not hidden
behind curtains, smoke or mirrors,
and audience members verify that
they can still be fooled from two
feet away. Blaine, who has been
practicing magic almost as far back
as age 4, has long since established
himself as a world-class magician,
astonishing even the most old-fash
ioned magic lover.
Though he seems to have
changed his medium of entertain
ment from street magic tricks to
shocker stunts (he even prefers peo
ple to call him an artist rather than a
magician), the magic is still there,
depending on how one defines
magic. One of Merriam-Webster's
definitions of "magic" is "an ex
traordinary power or influence
seemingly from a supernatural

source; something that seems to cast
a spell." The purpose of Blaine's
stunts from standing in a block of
ice for three days to standing on a
two-foot-wide, 109-foot-tall pillar
for two days is to show what hu
mans are capable of in the ways of
mental and physical endurance. For
some more avid believers in the su
pernatural nature of magic, his
stunts are fantastic feats that do cast
spells of sorts.
True, Gandhi fasted as well and
helped to free India from colonial
rule (as Kim sarcastically reminds
us), but none of his fasts lasted as
long as the 44 days of Blaine's "The
Above the Below" act; most actual
ly lasted less than half that time.
(Though Blaine's fast is lengthy, the
world's longest belongs to James
Hall: 67 days, while lost on the Se
ward peninsula, Alaska, from July
to Sept. 1900.) Blaine's idea com
ing more from the 1955 film "The
Glass Cage" than from the pages of
Kafka may not be novel, but his
act is an astounding reminder of
human ability. He is not trying to de
ceive the masses or gain fame
through his acts (though the latter is
obviously a consequence), but
rather he is trying to prove some
thing: "We are all capable of in
finitely more than we believe. We
are stronger and more resourceful
than we know, and we can endure
much more than we think we can. In
truth, the only restrictions on our ca
pacity to astonish ourselves and
each other are imposed by our own
minds." Sure, as a traditional magic
act, his suspension in glass above the
Thames leaves us wanting more, but
as a statement about human en
durance, it is far from "bland," and I
feel that Kim should respect the act
for what it truly means.
