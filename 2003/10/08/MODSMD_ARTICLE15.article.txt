## Boston's got the Greatest Show on Earth 
### 
Ringling Brothers and Barnum and
Bailey Circus claims to have "The
Greatest Show on Earth." After this
week, there is no way I can salute
that three-ringed world of amazement as the
World's Greatest Show, because that title has
been passed on.
Many baseball fans call the Boston Red
Sox a good team. Many call them a destined
team. Most probably call them a cursed team.
But after attending and watching this year's
2003 American League Division Series what I
call the Red Sox, quite simply is, "The Great
est Show on Earth."
Who can deny the miracle making and
heart-breaking efforts this team has supplied
since 1918? Every March "this is the year,"
and every trophy-less October the hiberna
tion until March begins. The only way to
watch the team and keep some hair on your
head is to expect absolutely nothing, which is

how I entered the playoffs
last week.
After stumbling off the
Red Sox rollercoaster Mon
day night, I realized that
what the Red Sox do better
than any Superbowl
matchup, any episode of
"Joe Millionaire," any Tracy
Morgan commercial, is en
tertain. These guys never
leave a dull moment.

Whether you you've never heard of the
Red Sox, don't care about them or for them, or
love-to-hate-to-love them most Octobers, you
have to admit, you've never been more enter
tained than by the Sox the past seven days.
Admit it.
Has anything ever been scripted better for
the screen than the 2003 Boston Red Sox in
the ALDS going two down after losing Game
1 in "here we go again" fashion only to take
Game 5 in the exact same way?
There has never been a show or movie with
so many twists, so many sub-stories, so many
key moments, so many pacemaker stopping
plays. It's like reading a choose-your-own-ad
venture book where you're forced to take un
expected paths and still win in the end.
Any diving catch, any two-and-out game
winning squeeze bunt, any late-inning, late
breaking cut-fastball that could be called a
strike, anything short of a topless lady running
out of the stands and kissing Pedro, could have
and did happen in this series.
Admit it.
We had Boston's bullpen blowing late-in
ning leads. We had Boston's bullpen saving
late-inning leads. We had Derek Lowe com
ing into start games. We had Derek Lowe
coming in to close games.
We had Jogging-Manny pimping non-RBI
basehits with a finger pointed to the sky. We
had Jogging-Manny pimping the absolute
crap out of laser beam bombs in his Air Jor
dans and sweatpants.
We had guys representing the tying run
missing home plate and guys getting obstruct
ed getting called out in Tom Brady "tuck rule"
fashion. We had guys "Cowboying Up."
We had Varitek holding it down. We had
guys knocking themselves out in the outfield.
We had game winning bombs. We had game
losing bunts. We had Pedro throwing 95 mile
per hour flames.
We had John Burkett surviving on 68 mile
per hour balloons. We had David Ortiz, a
combination of Mo Vaughn and Andre the
Giant, going after feeble guys in the stands.
We had Ortiz bear-hugging Byung-Hyun
Kim's feeble dugout interpreter. We had
aneurisms. We had fun.
Tell me, what was missing?
You weren't entertained watching Pedro
Martinez and Lou Merloni, doffed in hooded
sweatshirts heckle Ted Lilly like they were in
Little League?
You weren't entertained by a Red Sox
team claiming to have shaved its heads in a
team rally effort when you knew it was only a
failed covert operation to cut Johnny
Damon's mullet?
Admit it.
If history was any guide for this team, they
should've lost Monday night, as they had to the
A's in 'BB and '9O. But that would have been ex
pected, just as history would say Boston is no
match for New York in the postseason.
The Greatest Show on Earth, however, is
everything you least expect. And though I
vowed to hold no expectations for this team
this postseason, they had me on the edge of hy
perventilation with the bases loaded and two
out in the bottom of the ninth on Monday
night, as I'm sure they had all those waiting for
a championship reaching for the Depends.
That's how you entertain.
And as four Sox vs. Yanks American
League Championship Series grandstand tick
ets sold for $B,OOO on eßay after the game, and
as "Yankees Suck" chants echoed through the
Oakland Colosseum to begin the Boston Big
Top's tour through The Big Apple, Bamum
and Bailey's ringmaster had to be sitting be
hind the Boston dugout taking notes in his
best shorthand.

Red Sox, don't care about them or for them, or
love-to-hate-to-love them most Octobers, you
have to admit, you've never been more enter
tained than by the Sox the past seven days.
Admit it.
Has anything ever been scripted better for
the screen than the 2003 Boston Red Sox in
the ALDS going two down after losing Game
1 in "here we go again" fashion only to take
Game 5 in the exact same way?
There has never been a show or movie with
so many twists, so many sub-stories, so many
key moments, so many pacemaker stopping
plays. It's like reading a choose-your-own-ad
venture book where you're forced to take un
expected paths and still win in the end.
Any diving catch, any two-and-out game
winning squeeze bunt, any late-inning, late
breaking cut-fastball that could be called a
strike, anything short of a topless lady running
out of the stands and kissing Pedro, could have
and did happen in this series.
Admit it.
We had Boston's bullpen blowing late-in
ning leads. We had Boston's bullpen saving
late-inning leads. We had Derek Lowe com
ing into start games. We had Derek Lowe
coming in to close games.
We had Jogging-Manny pimping non-RBI
basehits with a finger pointed to the sky. We
had Jogging-Manny pimping the absolute
crap out of laser beam bombs in his Air Jor
dans and sweatpants.
We had guys representing the tying run
missing home plate and guys getting obstruct
ed getting called out in Tom Brady "tuck rule"
fashion. We had guys "Cowboying Up."
We had Varitek holding it down. We had
guys knocking themselves out in the outfield.
We had game winning bombs. We had game
losing bunts. We had Pedro throwing 95 mile
per hour flames.
We had John Burkett surviving on 68 mile
per hour balloons. We had David Ortiz, a
combination of Mo Vaughn and Andre the
Giant, going after feeble guys in the stands.
We had Ortiz bear-hugging Byung-Hyun
Kim's feeble dugout interpreter. We had
aneurisms. We had fun.
Tell me, what was missing?
You weren't entertained watching Pedro
Martinez and Lou Merloni, doffed in hooded
sweatshirts heckle Ted Lilly like they were in
Little League?
You weren't entertained by a Red Sox
team claiming to have shaved its heads in a
team rally effort when you knew it was only a
failed covert operation to cut Johnny
Damon's mullet?
Admit it.
If history was any guide for this team, they
should've lost Monday night, as they had to the
A's in 'BB and '9O. But that would have been ex
pected, just as history would say Boston is no
match for New York in the postseason.
The Greatest Show on Earth, however, is
everything you least expect. And though I
vowed to hold no expectations for this team
this postseason, they had me on the edge of hy
perventilation with the bases loaded and two
out in the bottom of the ninth on Monday
night, as I'm sure they had all those waiting for
a championship reaching for the Depends.
That's how you entertain.
And as four Sox vs. Yanks American
League Championship Series grandstand tick
ets sold for $B,OOO on eßay after the game, and
as "Yankees Suck" chants echoed through the
Oakland Colosseum to begin the Boston Big
Top's tour through The Big Apple, Bamum
and Bailey's ringmaster had to be sitting be
hind the Boston dugout taking notes in his
best shorthand.
