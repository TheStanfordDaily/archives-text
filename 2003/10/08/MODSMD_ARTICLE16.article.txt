# Cardinal spikes Tigers
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
There's now more at stake when the No. 4 Stan
ford women's volleyball meets up with No. 23 Pacific.
What many non-Stanford volleyball addicts don't
know is that Cardinal head coach John Dunning has a
coaching history that extends beyond Stanford be
yond the NCAA National Championship Title of
2001, beyond a Pacific 10 Conference Championship,
beyond the years of Cardinal alum Logan Tom and
the near-90 percent winning record.
For the 16 years leading up to Dunning's arrival on
the Farm, he led Pacific to two NCAA Champi
onships, five Big West titles and 16 consecutive post
season tournament bids.
So, needless to say, when the Tigers make a trip to
Stanford it definitely means something.
"It's always a weird, interesting match whenever
we play UOP because of our ties," said junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani who finished with a match
high 18 kills. "People really love [Dunning] on both
sides. It's so hard to lose somebody of that caliber so
the game's just an emotional war whenever we play
them."
Game 3 was no doubt the turning point in the
match for the Cardinal. After starting the night out
strong with a dominating 30-17 victory in Game 1,
forcing 12 Pacific hitting errors, the Tigers quickly re
grouped and took Game 2 from a very confident Car
dinal team on a score of 30-25.
With the score tied at 12-12 in Game 2 after a kill
by sophomore outside hitter Ashley Groothuis the
Tigers went on a 14-9 run marked by four Stanford at
tack errors.
"They didn't make any errors and we did," said se
nior middle blocker Jennifer Harvey. "It wasn't that
we were playing bad volleyball, but we gave them a lot
of points."
The Cardinal never recovered from the Pacific run
and was forced to jog into the locker room tied at a
game apiece despite a strong Game 1 effort.
Which is where Dunning came in where all that
experience, all of that history with Pacific and its play
ers, all the subtleties of knowing, really knowing, who
he's up against and what weapons he has to exploit the
opposing team's weaknesses began to take affect.
Stanford came out in Game 3 with a renewed sense
of purpose, opening up a 7-0 lead to begin the game
and the Tigers were never able to close that gap, los
ing 30-23.
Game 4 saw more of the same dominating Cardi
nal squad as it finished the match in emphatic form,
beating Pacific 30-19 off a match-ending kill by junior
outside hitter Jennifer Hucke.
"We regrouped in the locker room and came out
strong in Game 3," Nnamani said. "And, more im
portantly, we didn't give them any chance to come
back again in Game 4, which is definitely a positive."
The Cardinal will return to Pac-10 action this Sat
urday against No. 9 California at Haas Pavilion. As al
ways, the match can be heard on KZSU 90.1 FM.
