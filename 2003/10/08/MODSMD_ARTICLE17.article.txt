# Field hockey drops three in Michigan
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR 
The Stanford women's field hockey team (3-9) struggled
offensively during its four-day tour of Lansing, Mich, which
culminated yesterday with a 2-1 loss to unranked Central
Michigan (4-7).
The Cardinal managed only one goal in three games and,
for the first time this season, Stanford was shutout in consecu
tive matches, collecting its second and third goose egg of the
year against No. 9 Michigan State (9-3) and No. 20 Northwest
ern (5-6), respectively.
This isn't to say that the outcome can be wholly con
tributed to a lack of effort. The Cardinal faced two of the na
tion's toughest teams this weekend in Northwestern and
Michigan State.
"It's frustrating because we are creating opportunities but
just not finishing. That's really what we have to focus on," said
Stanford head coach Lesley Irvine. "Just because we've been
shutout twice in a row, doesn't mean that we haven't had some
nice offensive progressions. The shot totals don't always re
flect that."
Regardless, back-to-back zeroes are not something the
Stanford field hockey team wants to look at.
And the fact that Stanford has been outshot 28-70 in its last
three games is definitely cause for concern.
Saturday's matchup against Michigan State was the first of
a four-game road trip for the Cardinal, which will travel to
Berkeley this weekend before playing an alumni game at Stan
ford on Oct. 19.
The Cardinal started out its road trip with a tough 5-0 loss
to the Spartans. Going into the game, Stanford had been con
fident about facing a higher ranked team.
"They're obviously a very, very strong team," Irvine said.
"But we approach the game with the belief that we can win it."
Confidence, though, is not always enough to prevent those
goose eggs from appearing on the final box score as Stanford
definitely found out.
While Cardinal sophomore goalkeeper Ana Kravolec kept
it close through much of the first half with seven saves, the
game was blown open as Michigan State exploded with three
goals in an interval of less than five minutes.
Spartan senior midfielder Alexandra Kyser scored her first
goal of the game with an assist from junior midfielder Veerle
Goudswaard. Their roles were reversed when Goudswaard
quickly followed scoring a goal of her own with Kyser provid
ing the assist.
Freshman Jennifer Beeuwkes rounded out the first half of
scoring with an unassisted goal in the final minute.
The Spartans continued the damage in the second half.
After Stanford replaced Kravolec with senior goalkeeper
Emily Zander, Kyser and Veerle teamed up once again to
make it 4-0 and junior Annabet Beerman scored the final goal
of the game off a penalty corner.
The Cardinal was outshot 30-5 in the match.
Stanford picked up its second goose egg in Sunday's 2-0 loss
to Northwestern and once again the Cardinal was outshot 22-9.

"We've had some good offensive moments," Irvine said.
"We've been pleased with the way we've been able to pene
trate the circle, but we just have to concentrate on finishing and
getting shots on goal. Shooting is something we're going to be
focusing on."
Wildcats freshman goalkeeper Sherri-Anne Nyberg was
able to keep the Cardinal from scoring. Nyberg had seven
saves and took the win.
Meanwhile, Stanford goalkeeper Emily Zander provided
Stanford with a chance to take control of the game. With twelve
saves, Zander made a great effort to keep the score close.
"We feel that we have a rock back in the cage supporting
the team in Emily," senior forward Noor Dawood said.
The team felt they were in position to take the win through

out the game.
"We felt like we were in the game all along even in the last
few minutes," Zander said. "The energy and whole spirit of
our team was really up the entire game."
"I really felt like we were going to win the game," Dawood
added. "There were huge chunks of the contest that we dom
inated.
"The real problem was that we didn't get the ball into our
offensive 25 enough and get shots off or win comers, which is
one of our strong points," she said.
The game was 1-0 in the first half, after Northwestern fresh
man midfielder Meghan Small scored with an assist from

sophomore midfielder Ellen Schlafly.
The score read the same for another
43 minutes until junior midfielder
Candice Cooper took an unassisted
shot at the goal and scored at the end
of the second half.
"It was a goal that started with mis
takes down die field and turned into a
chain reaction," Dawood said. "It def
initely was disappointing when North
western scored because the momen
tum of the game was going our way.
We felt like we had a good chance of
pulling the game out but after that
point it seemed a lot further away."
"We had some great moments
but just didn't finish," Irvine added.
"We really felt it was just a matter
of time before we scored but a sim
ple defensive error preceded the
second goal and then it was too
late."
The road doesn't get any easier for
the Cardinal now. On Saturday, Stan
ford will travel across the bay to face
No. 17 California.
