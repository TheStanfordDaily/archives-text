# Petition started to honor Sleep and Dreams professor with stamp
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most Stanford students will never have the
opportunity to lick their professors, but that
could all change if one woman's campaign to
have Psychology Prof. William Dement com
memorated on a postage stamp is successful.
Dement taught the popular Sleep and Dreams
course for 33 years and is one of the world's
leading experts on sleep research.
Although the rules of the United States
Postal Service state that an individual must be
dead at least 10 years before postal tribute, Illi
nois resident Valarie Arseneau is starting a
38,000-signature petition to have this posthu
mous requirement removed in light of De
ment's contributions to society.
Arseneau grew up in Manteno, 111., the site
of Dement's original research on sleep disor
ders in 1953.
"Because of Dr. Dement's contribution to
medicine, my two sons have a grandfather," she
said. "I have made it my personal mission to see
to it that Dr. Dement receives the kudos that he
is so deserving of while he is still alive to appre
ciate them."

Her father suffered from a
life-threatening case of Ob
structive Sleep Apnea in
1983.
"It was because a local
neurologist was aware of Dr.
Dement's work that my fa
ther did not succumb to his
mysterious illness," she said.
"My father was 51 at that
time and this Jan. 10 he will

turn 74."
Arseneau is a board certified respiratory
technician who conducts sleep studies. She
came up with the idea to honor Dement in Au
gust while thinking about his testimony to Con
gress on the nature of sleep disorders in 1990.
Passionate about her campaign, she compares
Dr. Dement's contributions to the field of med
icine with those of Hippocrates.
"Besides breathing, sleep is the most impor
tant activity that we engage in and it is shroud
ed in such mystery that people don't even think
to question if they are truly sleeping," she said.
"I always tell my patients that those of us in
sleep are so far ahead of the curve that the av
erage person can't even see the curve."

She has begun collecting signatures for a pe
tition she plans to send to the U.S. Postal Ser
vice in Washington D.C.
"38,000 is the number of people who perish
in their sleep of a heart attack annually in this
country because of untreated Obstructive
Sleep Apnea," Arseneau said. "That number is
200 less than the capacity of Wrigley Field in
Chicago."
Dr. Dement seems honored by the cam
paign, though he tries to focus on his continuing
research rather than his achievements.
"I have only briefly heard about Ms. Arse
neau's initiative," he said. "[But] anything that
will increase public awareness about the dan
gers of sleep deprivation and sleep disorders
has my enthusiastic approval and support."
Students agree with Arseneau that Dement
deserves recognition for his life's work.
"Dr. Dement has dedicated nearly his en
tire life to researching sleep disorders and rais
ing public awareness about the dangers and
prevalence of drowsy driving," said senior Phil
Sayegh. "After having taken Sleep and
Dreams and being a TA for the course two
years straight, I am sure he would be extreme
ly flattered by the postage stamp idea. Sleep re

search and awareness is truly his passion, and
he would be even more excited to know that
the stamp would potentially educate even
more people."
Senior Nathalie Cassidy, who took Sleep
and Dreams two years ago, concurred.
"In his class, he genuinely wanted and
worked hard in an attempt to get people aware
of problems associated with lack of proper
sleep habits, and I think he would like the fact
that this would get some publicity to the gener
al public about it," she said.
Cassidy felt the class made her more aware
of the need to conduct more research on sleep
disorders. She thinks that Dement has posi
tively impacted many people through his re
search.
"I saw interviews with people whose lives
had been affected by various sleeping disorders
and how their lives had changed as a result of
treatment, and so I do believe that he has defi
nitely changed, if not saved many lives," she
said.
Dement does wonder, though, if the educa
tional quality of a stamp might be diminished
with the large traffic in e-mail communication.
"I have been working on public awareness

about the dangers of sleep deprivation for more
than 20 years," he said. "I was chairman of a
commission chartered by the U.S. Congress
one of whose goals was to raise public aware
ness. I have led professional organizations in
this campaign. I have given countless inter
views. I've written countless magazine articles."
Sayegh detailed one of Dement's recent
achievements in the social application of sleep
research.
"Just last week, New Jersey became the first
state in the nation to criminalize drowsy driving
in the event that a fatal accident occurs that can
be evidenced to have been caused by drowsy
driving, which is a great legislative step that will
likely influence other states to adopt similar
laws," he said.
While Arseneau's prospective postage
stamp features a portrait of Dement, he would
prefer a more research-oriented design.
"It would probably be too much detail, but it
would be good if the view could include some
thing from a sleep clinic or laboratory," he said.

fort to commemorate Dement can go to

that this would get some publicity to the gener
al public about it," she said.
Cassidy felt the class made her more aware
of the need to conduct more research on sleep
disorders. She thinks that Dement has posi
tively impacted many people through his re
search.
"I saw interviews with people whose lives
had been affected by various sleeping disorders
and how their lives had changed as a result of
treatment, and so I do believe that he has defi
nitely changed, if not saved many lives," she
said.
Dement does wonder, though, if the educa
tional quality of a stamp might be diminished
with the large traffic in e-mail communication.
"I have been working on public awareness

about the dangers of sleep deprivation for more
than 20 years," he said. "I was chairman of a
commission chartered by the U.S. Congress
one of whose goals was to raise public aware
ness. I have led professional organizations in
this campaign. I have given countless inter
views. I've written countless magazine articles."
Sayegh detailed one of Dement's recent
achievements in the social application of sleep
research.
"Just last week, New Jersey became the first
state in the nation to criminalize drowsy driving
in the event that a fatal accident occurs that can
be evidenced to have been caused by drowsy
driving, which is a great legislative step that will
likely influence other states to adopt similar
laws," he said.
While Arseneau's prospective postage
stamp features a portrait of Dement, he would
prefer a more research-oriented design.
"It would probably be too much detail, but it
would be good if the view could include some
thing from a sleep clinic or laboratory," he said.

William Dement
Most Stanford students will never have the
opportunity to lick their professors, but that
could all change if one woman's campaign to
have Psychology Prof. William Dement com
memorated on a postage stamp is successful.
Dement taught the popular Sleep and Dreams
course for 33 years and is one of the world's
leading experts on sleep research.
Although the rules of the United States
Postal Service state that an individual must be
dead at least 10 years before postal tribute, Illi
nois resident Valarie Arseneau is starting a
38,000-signature petition to have this posthu
mous requirement removed in light of De
ment's contributions to society.
Arseneau grew up in Manteno, 111., the site
of Dement's original research on sleep disor
ders in 1953.
"Because of Dr. Dement's contribution to
medicine, my two sons have a grandfather," she
said. "I have made it my personal mission to see
to it that Dr. Dement receives the kudos that he
is so deserving of while he is still alive to appre
ciate them."

Her father suffered from a
life-threatening case of Ob
structive Sleep Apnea in
1983.
"It was because a local
neurologist was aware of Dr.
Dement's work that my fa
ther did not succumb to his
mysterious illness," she said.
"My father was 51 at that
time and this Jan. 10 he will

turn 74."
Arseneau is a board certified respiratory
technician who conducts sleep studies. She
came up with the idea to honor Dement in Au
gust while thinking about his testimony to Con
gress on the nature of sleep disorders in 1990.
Passionate about her campaign, she compares
Dr. Dement's contributions to the field of med
icine with those of Hippocrates.
"Besides breathing, sleep is the most impor
tant activity that we engage in and it is shroud
ed in such mystery that people don't even think
to question if they are truly sleeping," she said.
"I always tell my patients that those of us in
sleep are so far ahead of the curve that the av
erage person can't even see the curve."

She has begun collecting signatures for a pe
tition she plans to send to the U.S. Postal Ser
vice in Washington D.C.
"38,000 is the number of people who perish
in their sleep of a heart attack annually in this
country because of untreated Obstructive
Sleep Apnea," Arseneau said. "That number is
200 less than the capacity of Wrigley Field in
Chicago."
Dr. Dement seems honored by the cam
paign, though he tries to focus on his continuing
research rather than his achievements.
"I have only briefly heard about Ms. Arse
neau's initiative," he said. "[But] anything that
will increase public awareness about the dan
gers of sleep deprivation and sleep disorders
has my enthusiastic approval and support."
Students agree with Arseneau that Dement
deserves recognition for his life's work.
"Dr. Dement has dedicated nearly his en
tire life to researching sleep disorders and rais
ing public awareness about the dangers and
prevalence of drowsy driving," said senior Phil
Sayegh. "After having taken Sleep and
Dreams and being a TA for the course two
years straight, I am sure he would be extreme
ly flattered by the postage stamp idea. Sleep re

search and awareness is truly his passion, and
he would be even more excited to know that
the stamp would potentially educate even
more people."
Senior Nathalie Cassidy, who took Sleep
and Dreams two years ago, concurred.
"In his class, he genuinely wanted and
worked hard in an attempt to get people aware
of problems associated with lack of proper
sleep habits, and I think he would like the fact
that this would get some publicity to the gener
al public about it," she said.
Cassidy felt the class made her more aware
of the need to conduct more research on sleep
disorders. She thinks that Dement has posi
tively impacted many people through his re
search.
"I saw interviews with people whose lives
had been affected by various sleeping disorders
and how their lives had changed as a result of

nitely changed, if not saved many lives," she
said.
