# Recall elicits variety of perspectives

### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's blockbuster victory in
yesterday's election that removed Gov. Gray Davis
from office has made waves not only throughout the
state but also in the Stanford community.
Many on Stanford's left-leaning campus said they
voted against recalling Davis.
"He's already elected, and, even though he's not
very popular, I don't think anyone's very popular
right now, because we don't have any money," said
junior Joey Liaw, referring to California's huge
deficit.
But Aleksandr Gurevich, who graduated last
year from Stanford, said he voted for Schwarzeneg
ger because he agrees with his political views.
"I'm fiscally conservative, but on social issues, I'm
more liberal," he said, adding that Schwarzenegger's
policies seem to match his own beliefs.
Gurevich is from the former Soviet Union,
where, he says, a recall election of this type would
have never taken place.
"There, you couldn't recall Stalin," he said.
Still, some students expressed distrust of
Schwarzenegger's treatment of minorities.
Senior Laura Rice, who is of Native American
descent, said she almost cried when she heard
Schwarzenegger make comments against Indian
gaming, which she saw as an affront to the Native
American community.
"It'll be awful for the Native Americans in Cali
fornia who have been screwed over so many times
already," she said.
Rice made the 90 minute drive back home to Va
caville, south of Sacramento, to vote against the recall
and Proposition 54 and for Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
Danny Cox, a coterminal student in earth systems,
recalled seeing a car smashed with a wrecking ball on
television, a stunt symbolizing Schwarzenegger's
plans to eliminate car taxes that Davis increased.
"It's sad," Cox said. "It's all about show busi
ness."
About one-third of registered voters on campus
took to the polling booths to cast their votes, clerks
at Stanford's polling centers estimated.
At the polling center at El Centro Chicano, about
400 people voted; at Florence Moore Hall, about 230
people voted. While 1,225 people were registered to
vote at El Centro Chicano, only 592 people were
registered at Florence Moore Hall.
Many of the people who showed up to vote yes
terday at campus polling centers were asked to fill out
provisional ballots because they were not listed on the
rosters kept at each center. Voting provisionally
means that a voter's ballot is counted offsite once it is
confirmed that they have only voted once, rather than
at the polling center immediately after voting ends.
This probably took place because students are
registered for a certain polling center based on the
residence in which they lived when they first regis
tered to vote, which means that students who five on
one side of campus could be registered at the polling
center on the other side.
Of the 400 people who voted at El Centro Chicano,
about 275 were on that list, estimated Dany Hart, a
clerk there. Of the 226 people registered at Florence
Moore Hall, 144 were registered to vote there.
"A lot of people did not show up in the roster, so
they had to vote provisionally," said Richard Aguin
sky, a clerk at the Florence Moore center, who was
surprised at the number of people who did not ap
pear on his list.
