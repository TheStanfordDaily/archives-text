It's time to get involved in world affairs
was the message conveyed last night at
"America Debates Its Role in the World,"
an event cosponsored by the United Na
tion Foundation's "People Speak" initia
tive and held at the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center.
"It is crucial, particularly on election
night, to precipitate dialogue with stu
dents to get them concerned not only with
local politics, but world politics as well,"
said Nancy Mooney, representative of the
foundation.
The Stanford event was one of 14 na
tionwide forums that will be held in com
ing weeks. Over this week and next week,
the program will try to encourage public
education on foreign policy and national
security in a "town hall-like" setting
through panels and open discussions.
The event was highlighted by a 45-
minute presentation by a panel of five ex
perts in foreign affairs, including two
Stanford faculty members, Prof. William
Perry, former Secretary of Defense and a
senior fellow at the Institute of Interna
tional Studies, and Political Science Prof.
Michael McFaul, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution. Gloria Duffy, chief
executive of The Commonwealth Club,
Elizabeth Randall, senior research schol
ar for International Security and Cooper
ation and Jane Wales, president and chief
executive of The World Affairs Council of
Northern California, also spoke.
McFaul and the other panelists agreed
that the greatest threat to the United
States is nuclear weaponry, and that the
best way to avert a crisis would be through
international cooperation.

Wales said the United States needs to
focus on a shared understanding of "who
we are and how we want to be seen." She
alluded to the fact that when American
troops landed in Najaf, Iraq, local people
chanted, "Democracy, Whisky, Sexy."
"It is dangerous for us to be perceived
by the words of Baywatch rather than by
the words of the Constitution," Wales
said.
McFaul stressed the importance of in
dividuals becoming more active in de
fending their political views.
"You can all unilaterally do something
in the world, you don't need to be George
Bush," McFaul said. "Don't just sit on
your hands, go out and do something. We
are no longer in the middle of the twenti
eth century; this is the beginning of the
twenty-first century."
The panelists agreed that the U.S.
needs to nurture its relationships with
other countries during peacetime.
Sophomore Nicholas Hsu, who attend
ed the event, said that programs like this
are unique and critical for a Stanford
community that, for the most part, does
not get much political exposure.
"Discussion of international affairs
does not play a big role on campus be
cause we are so isolated," he said. "It is
important for the University to have ac
complished and scholarly discussions on
foreign affairs. As Stanford students, we
need to have foreign affairs made more
accessible for us."
Hsu believes that programs like "Peo
ple Speak" are unique for Stanford stu
dents not only because they are free, but
because they allow students to feel in
spired to play a greater role in shaping for
eign police
