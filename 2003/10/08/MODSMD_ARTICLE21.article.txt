# College students look to egg donations
## 
### MARISA MUNTEAN DAILY TROJAN 
(U-WIRE) Advertisements offering
up to $5,000 for human egg donations
caught the eye of one junior majoring in
political science at the University of
Southern California.
After meeting with the counselors at
the Manhattan Beach Center for Egg Op
tions, Christina Carrdellio decided to be
come a donor.
"It's hard to miss the ads in the paper,"
Carrdellio said. "The money tempted me
at first, but the more I looked into it and
researched it, I realized there was more to
it than that. Some people want to give birth
so badly, but simply can't without help."
Carrdellio has not yet donated, but has
been on the donor list since July and is
waiting for the agency to match her with a
recipient.
Because couples are paying to receive
donated eggs and sperm, they carefully re
view profiles of the donors. Agencies even
keep donors' baby photos on file.
"Most of our donors are college stu
dents," said Maria Eby, vice president of
marketing at the California Cryobank, a
sperm bank in Westwood. "We try to re
cruit students because they're young and
healthier."
Couples often spend up to $30,000 to
find eggs of a certain ethnicity or eye color.
Donating sperm is a convenient job
for college students, involving little time
commitment, the freedom to make your
own hours, and reimbursement of $75 per
visit or up to $9OO per month, Eby said.
To help find the most desirable donors,
the cryobank has other locations in Palo
Alto, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass., to at
tract volunteers from Stanford and Har
vard, Eby said.
The decision to donate sperm or eggs to

infertile couples is not easy to make.
"Before a woman can donate her eggs,
she meets with us to discuss any questions
she may have," said Dr. David Tourge
man, an assistant professor at the USC
medical school.
For a man to qualify as a sperm donor,
he must take a physical examination, offer
his medical history and attend or be a grad
uate of a four-year university. Once the
bank accepts him, a donor visits the center
two to three times per week and submits to
a blood test every three months to ensure
the health of the sperm, Eby said.
"Natural pregnancies always have
risks," Eby said. "We don't want to cre
ate any more risks with the donated
sperm."
The requirements are not hard to
meet, but only 3 to 5 percent of the people
who call in response to advertisements
become sperm donors, Eby said. Most
men decide that donating is simply not for
them.
"If all bodily fluids were worth this
much money, I'd sell them all," said Dylan
Shell, a graduate student studying robotics
who has never donated. "I'm surprised
more people aren't doing it. What's the
phone number to call?"
Not all students are as enthusiastic
about giving up their semen and eggs to in
fertile couples.
Luis Barrios, a third year architecture
student cites "morals" as a major reason
he would never donate his sperm.
"If a couple is infertile, well, that's life,"
Barrios said.
Some students fear meeting the prod
uct of their sperm or eggs, though laws
are now on the books in many states re
lieving donors of any obligations to the
child.
To prepare for egg donation, the donor
must take hormones to synchronize her

menstrual cycle with the recipient's. She
also receives an injection to stimulate the
ovaries, Tourgeman said.
"We're not asking the ovaries to do
anything unnatural. Twenty to 40 eggs are
normally produced each month, and if
they aren't used, they're lost," said
Tourgeman.
Eggs are retrieved from the ovaries in a
small procedure. The egg recovery takes
up to an hour with the donor under either
anesthetic to relieve any pain. The eggs
are collected by inserting a needle
through the vagina and into the ovary.
The eggs are aspirated out and the donor
can leave the hospital within four to eight
hours.
"People assume it's more harmful than
it actually is," Carrdellio said.
"Donating eggs should not have any
long-term adverse affects," Tourgeman
said. "If a woman later on in life has diffi
culties with childbirth, in all likelihood it is
not related to the egg donation in the
past."
Men have more ease in sperm donation
that women do donating their eggs. Sperm
donors must go to their bank at least two
times per week and provide semen sam
ples.
The sample rooms are small but fully
equipped with artwork on the walls, a
TV / VCR combo, and a stack of maga
zines.
Lab technicians examine the samples,
which are then quarantined in cryogenic
tanks for three months before use.
Couples think carefully before turning
to egg centers and sperm banks. Donors
must give the same consideration to their
opportunity to help.
"The recipient gives birth to a child and
as the donor, you have the satisfaction of
knowing you helped someone," Tourge
man said.
