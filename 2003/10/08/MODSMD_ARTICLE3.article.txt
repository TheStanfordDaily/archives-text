# Student activists reflect on election

### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
While many Stanford students have
been following the recall election, stu
dent activists felt the Shockwaves of
Schwarzenegger's victory more than
others.
Since the recall became reality this
summer, dozens of students have spoken
out on the issues, jumped on candidates'
bandwagons and followed the daily elec
tion news.
The Stanford Republicans and Stan
ford Democrats were among the groups
keeping a sharp eye on the polls during

yesterday's election.
Stanford Republicans, who threw a
party last night at Lagunita where they
played Twisted Sister's "We're Not
Going to Take it Anymore," point to
California's budget crisis as a sign that
Davis' economic policies were a bust.
"When Davis was elected, there was a
$lO billion surplus, and now there's a $3B
billion deficit, which shows that his poli
cies just weren't working," said sopho
more Bob Sensenbrenner, a member of
the Stanford Republicans who predicts
the governor-elect will repeal the new tax
increase as soon as he takes office.
"Schwarzenegger will bring back

spending restraints to prevent the legisla
ture from spending money that we're
going to need in the future," he said.
The Stanford Democrats, who gath
ered at Toyon yesterday to mourn
Schwarzenegger's win and celebrate the
failure of Proposition 54, were disap
pointed by California voters' decisions to
recall Davis.
But junior Dylan Mefford, the organi
zation's president, said the long-term im
plications of Schwarzenegger's win have
been overstated and dismissed specula
tion that the recall might be a sign that
President George Bush could have
more support in California during
the upcoming presidential elections
than anticipated.
"Schwarzenegger is pro-choice
and pro-environment, and it sounds
like he might raise taxes," Mefford
said. "So on many of these issues,
he's more in line with democrats,
with Gray Davis."
The economy was a hot issue
among Stanford students. While the
more liberal contingent on campus
believes the recall diverted attention
from serious financial problems fac
ing the state, conservatives ex
pressed their faith in Schwarzeneg
ger's ability to clean house and ener
gize the economy.
"I think the results show that
California voters want to come up
with a solution other than more
taxes and spending," said sopho
more Bob Sensenbrenner, a mem
ber of the Stanford Republicans.
"Schwarzenegger won't be as be
holden to special interest groups as
Dfovis. He's not going to accept
huge checks from prison guards in
turn for passing legislation."
"I think the whole system in Cali
fornia is kind of absurd," said senior
Michael Zakaras, a campus democ
rat and editor of the left-wing Stan
ford Progressive. "It's a classic ex
ample of money buying power."
Zakaras said he would be
shocked if the economy rebounds in
the near future.
"I'd be surprised that someone
with so little political experience and
knowledge could know the system
well enough to do a better job than
Davis did himself," he said.
Zakaras said Davis has been un
fairly targeted for California's bud

get crisis.
"Davis is getting blamed a little
too much for everything that has
been going on in California politics
during the last few years," Zakaras
said. "The republicans in the senate
and the assembly refused to pass any
form of state budget or implement
any taxes."
Junior Joe Fairbanks, president
of the Stanford Republicans, said
that although he is happy with the
outcome of the election, he is some
what disappointed that republican
candidate Tom McClintock didn't
get the attention he deserved.

"I personally thought McClin
tock was far better qualified for the
job than Schwarzenegger," Fair
banks said. "He had the most clear
and feasible plans to bring the econ
omy back to what it was before Davis
took office."
Though some campus liberals
were disappointed by the recall of
Davis, many celebrated the defeat of
Proposition 54, which would have
prohibited the collection of ethnic
and racial data at the state and local
levels.
"I am nothing but elated," said
Hunter Hargraves, a spokesperson

for the Coalition to Stop Prop. 54.
"Both Stanford and the state have
said that they value the importance
of upholding race and diversity and
integrating that into daily life, educa
tion, law enforcement and health
care. This really is about informa
tion, and I think voters have spoken
that they would rather know than
not know."
Fairbanks said he is disappointed
by the defeat of Proposition 54.
"I believe it was a chance for Cal
ifornia to become a colorblind soci
ety," he said, calling the defeat a
"major setback."
