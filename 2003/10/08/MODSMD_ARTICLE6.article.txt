# Police chief discusses crime with ASSU
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Director of Public Safety Laura Wilson,
the chief of Stanford's police force, ad
dressed the ASSU Senate at its meeting last
night, discussing everything from the new
freshman alcohol policy to bike theft on
campus.
Alcohol "Crack-Down"
"The police 'crack-down' on alcohol
use by students is a myth," Wilson said.

She went on to say that alcohol-related
offenses, including citations and arrests,
have not changed radically over past
years.
"In essence, statistics more or less stay the
same," she said, although she noted that an
increase in hospitalizations due to alcohol in
toxication have increased.
"I'm not particularly interested in my of
ficers issuing minor-in-possession citations,"
she told the Senate. "I want them to be fo
cusing their attention on gross violations,"
such as out-of-control parties that flagrantly

disregard laws.
"What we're looking for are people
passed out on the lawn, hanging off of bal
conies," Wilson said. "There was a party re
cently where there was a DUI and two med
ical transports. Those are the types of things
that catch our attention."
However, she was quick to add that this
does not mean that an underage student
flaunting a red cup will not face conse
quences.
Responding to a question about the en
forcement of the new ban on alcohol in

freshman dorms, Wilson responded: "The
police department does not enforce Univer
sity policy. It enforces the law." Nonetheless,
her goal for the department is "to work with
the University, not in opposition or as an is
land."
Wilson also clarified some questions on
bike safety and bike theft
"Last year, President Hennessy said he
wanted greater attention spent on bicycle
safety," she said. This, in turn, has led to an
increased focus on making sure that bi
cyclists stop at stop signs and use a light
at night.
"It is a priority for us to be out
there" making sure bicyclists are riding
safely, she said.
As for bike theft, Wilson admitted
that there has been a rise in the number
of bikes reported stolen, which is up 52
percent from 317 in 2001 to 483 in 2002.
Wilson said that the increase is largely a
societal issue, not a question of en
forcement.
"Our bike theft rate almost mirrors
our unemployment rate in Santa Clara
County," she said. "If people are out of
work, it's an easy target."
Just the Facts, Ma'am
With only 32 sworn officers, the
Stanford police force fielded 12,176 dis
patched calls last year, wrote over 2,000
reports and made 417 arrests, including
43 felony arrests, Wilson said. Two
thirds of those arrests were non-stu

dents, she said.
There were also 42,000 parking cita
tions issued last year.
"All of the money goes to Santa
Clara County," she said. "Stanford
University doesn't get a dime. In my
opinion, that's a poorly negotiated con
tract. We generate about a million dol
lars a year in revenue for Santa Clara
County."
The most prevalent crime on-cam
pus is structure burglaries there
were 154 of them last year. Vehicle bur
glaries come in at a distant second, with
89 thefts last year.
And the Beat Goes On
The Senate also approved a re
quest from the senior class of $5OO to
help pay for Full Moon on the Quad,
which is scheduled to take place
Thursday night.
Before concluding the senators
also discussed a proposal to establish
a special-fees committee. Both the
cost of special fees to students and the
number of students requesting a re
fund have been rising. The goal of the
committee would be to examine the
special fees process.
