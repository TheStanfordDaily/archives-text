## BUMP ON A BLOG Stanford students bare it all online in blog form 
### ROBERT LIU 
A friend told me a while ago that he had started doing
this thing called Livejournal (www.livejournal.com),
which he explained was "sort of like an online diary."
Ever the caring, sensitive friend, I responded, "Online
diary? You f—ing pansy!" I thought no more about it
until a few days later when, totally bored, I decided to
check out his site.
Livejournal (as well as Xanga, Blogger and other
such journal sites) works like this: The creator of the
diary registers with the Web site in order to start a per
sonal Web page. The user can then post text entries and
edit the layout without going through the hassle of deal
ing with HTML. Other people can directly access the
completed personal page, read entries and post com
ments. The user can also link the page (called a blog) to
those of his or her friends. Or he can join a "blog ring" of
other users with similar interests.
My friend's blog had three entries, of which the most
recent entry read, "DIE MUTHERF —ER DIE
MUTHERF—ER DIE." This was followed by a long
diatribe against our school and its teachers. The other
two entries were about how much he disliked stupid peo
ple and how stupid everyone at our school was. After
reading through his journal I realized a couple of things.
First, that it would take years of psychological counseling
for my friend to resolve his anger issues. And second,
that reading about someone else's miserable life was ac
tually sort of fun.
A lot of fun, actually. So much so that I caved in and
decided to create my own blog. Instead of ranting against
the establishment, I would lace my page with hilarious
observations about the state of the world interspersed
with profound spiritual wisdom. It would be like "The
Daily Show" as moderated by the Dalai Lama. I envi
sioned the possible scenarios the rave response of
some hot girl who would happen upon my blog while
shopping online: "Rob, I didn't know you very well be
fore this, but after randomly stumbling upon your Live
journal I now realize that you're an amazingly intelli
gent, witty and sensitive person. Through this window
into your thoughts, I feel like we share a deep spiritual
bond that also translates into intense physical attraction.
TAKE ME NOW!!"
Actually, that was the only scenario I imagined, but it
was enough to convince me that I needed to get in on this
online diary thing ASAP. So I set up my own Livejour
nal, put up a few entries and waited for the accolades.
One day a hot girl actually did come up to me, except she
called the blog "narcissistic and irrelevant." I quickly
shut down my page afterwards.
At Stanford, I have discovered a sizeable community of
bloggers who have apparently not been dissuaded by some
object-of-desire's insistence that their journals sucked. Or, at
least, these bloggers value their intellectual and artistic ex
pression more than getting laid. Curious about the demo
graphics of this group, I conducted a totally unscientific sur
vey by randomly clicking on blogs in a Stanford blog ring.
The results: Girls slightly outnumber guys (15 girls'
blogs, as opposed to 12 guys' blogs).
Sophomores (seven blogs), juniors (five blogs) and se
niors (seven blogs) are all roughly equally represented, with
fewer freshmen (three blogs) and graduate students (four
blogs). And then there was the outlier: One dude was 53
years old. A significant portion have dubious taste and play
elevator Muzak in the background of their blogs (eight).
There are three types of blogs in the Stanford com
munity.
The first type is what I call the "non-egocentric
blog," in which the writer uses the medium as a forum
for his or her opinions on topics ranging from political
events to movie reviews. Some of these are simply a col
lection of links and newspaper articles that the author
feels are relevant. At Stanford, the most famous non
egocentric blog is almost certainly the one produced by
Lawrence Lessig, a professor at the law school (Prof.
Lessig could not be reached for comment). Prof.
Lessig's blog, found at www.lessig.org, is concerned
with current political and legal debates, focusing espe
cially on digital and cyber law. It is often referenced by
other mainstream web sites, and includes several posts
by presidential candidate Howard Dean.
The second type I'll brand the "egocentric but non
superficial blog," in which the author makes observa
tions about personal characteristics, friends and pro
found spiritual and philosophical questions. My overly
melodramatic friend's blog contains this line: "Anyways,
I had a great summer. A summer of change, of growth,
of growing up, of nothing much." This immediately
elicited comments such as "I don't think I want my name
attached to a blog that allows people like you to post
blogs like the last one" and "I think I need a beer to af
firm my manhood after that statement." Judging by the
number of comments this type of blog generates, some
people must find them entertaining.
Yet another category of blog manages to be both ego
centric and superficial. The authors of these blogs pay lit

tie attention to whether their entries are interesting,
choosing instead to list mundane details from daily life.
My friend, whose blog clearly falls into this category, gra
ciously allowed me to take the following excerpts from his
oh-so-stimulating journal: "So tired... Gotz to eat, exer
cise, and do some errands. Errrr ", "Hmm... what
to say... ", and my personal favorite, "Hot dogs ROCK.
S— I wish I could eat them all day. Oh wait I do."
Some people manage to pull off this type of blog pretty
well because they lead interesting lives. Most Stanford stu
dents, who spend their time sitting in classrooms, doing
homework or dashing off to extracurricular activities, donot
Another of my findings: The blog community at Stan
ford is huge. The Xanga blog ring I visited contains 193 dif
ferent personal pages. There are likely countless others out
there that are either use a different service from Xanga or
are not linked with the blog ring. These kind of numbers
made me wonder what makes blogging so popular. To an
swer this, I asked a random sampling of people, "Why are
blogs so popular?" Here are some of the responses I got
"People are inherently egocentric and believe that
their lives are interesting enough to record."
"It's fun to post your thoughts to the world and to
read what other people are thinking."
"Because they allow someone to be impersonal
about their personal life."

The most thoughtful reply, however, comes from Gra
ham Walker, a graduate student at the Medical School.
Blogging is "just another way that our society is trying to
keep in touch, even though we're seemingly further apart
than ever," Walker says. "I'm dating someone in Chicago,
my parents are in Kansas City. I have friends at jobs and
grad schools across the country (and world). Blogging's a
great way to keep up-to-date with how someone's doing in
the grand scheme of things and also with the minutae that
make that person interesting. Stuff you don't get on a
phone call. Blogging kind of provides this open forum
where you can share your thoughts, no matter how mun
dane or bizarre. The quirkier the better."
These reasons, perhaps, explain the staying power of
meticulous online descriptions of people's relationship
woes and sci-fi convention visits. Okay, it may be true
that most blogs fall squarely in the egotistical / superfi
cial category, very few get read by anyone except the au
thor's indulgent friends, and this kind of writing is no way
to lure in a readership of luscious hotties. But blogs con
tinue to thrive because there is something innately satis
fying about being able to keep up with the happenings in
other peoples' fives, as well as being able to broadcast
your own every move. As my friend (the one with the
boring blog) put it, "It's not always interesting, but
you're still reading it, aren't you?"

ing with HTML. Other people can directly access the
completed personal page, read entries and post com
ments. The user can also link the page (called a blog) to
those of his or her friends. Or he can join a "blog ring" of
other users with similar interests.
My friend's blog had three entries, of which the most
recent entry read, "DIE MUTHERF —ER DIE
MUTHERF—ER DIE." This was followed by a long
diatribe against our school and its teachers. The other
two entries were about how much he disliked stupid peo
ple and how stupid everyone at our school was. After
reading through his journal I realized a couple of things.
First, that it would take years of psychological counseling
for my friend to resolve his anger issues. And second,
that reading about someone else's miserable life was ac
tually sort of fun.
A lot of fun, actually. So much so that I caved in and
decided to create my own blog. Instead of ranting against
the establishment, I would lace my page with hilarious
observations about the state of the world interspersed
with profound spiritual wisdom. It would be like "The
Daily Show" as moderated by the Dalai Lama. I envi
sioned the possible scenarios the rave response of
some hot girl who would happen upon my blog while
shopping online: "Rob, I didn't know you very well be
fore this, but after randomly stumbling upon your Live
journal I now realize that you're an amazingly intelli
gent, witty and sensitive person. Through this window
into your thoughts, I feel like we share a deep spiritual
bond that also translates into intense physical attraction.
TAKE ME NOW!!"
Actually, that was the only scenario I imagined, but it
was enough to convince me that I needed to get in on this
online diary thing ASAP. So I set up my own Livejour
nal, put up a few entries and waited for the accolades.
One day a hot girl actually did come up to me, except she
called the blog "narcissistic and irrelevant." I quickly
shut down my page afterwards.
At Stanford, I have discovered a sizeable community of
bloggers who have apparently not been dissuaded by some
object-of-desire's insistence that their journals sucked. Or, at
least, these bloggers value their intellectual and artistic ex
pression more than getting laid. Curious about the demo
graphics of this group, I conducted a totally unscientific sur
vey by randomly clicking on blogs in a Stanford blog ring.
The results: Girls slightly outnumber guys (15 girls'
blogs, as opposed to 12 guys' blogs).
Sophomores (seven blogs), juniors (five blogs) and se
niors (seven blogs) are all roughly equally represented, with
fewer freshmen (three blogs) and graduate students (four
blogs). And then there was the outlier: One dude was 53
years old. A significant portion have dubious taste and play
elevator Muzak in the background of their blogs (eight).
There are three types of blogs in the Stanford com
munity.
The first type is what I call the "non-egocentric
blog," in which the writer uses the medium as a forum
for his or her opinions on topics ranging from political
events to movie reviews. Some of these are simply a col
lection of links and newspaper articles that the author
feels are relevant. At Stanford, the most famous non
egocentric blog is almost certainly the one produced by
Lawrence Lessig, a professor at the law school (Prof.
Lessig could not be reached for comment). Prof.
Lessig's blog, found at www.lessig.org, is concerned
with current political and legal debates, focusing espe
cially on digital and cyber law. It is often referenced by
other mainstream web sites, and includes several posts
by presidential candidate Howard Dean.
The second type I'll brand the "egocentric but non
superficial blog," in which the author makes observa
tions about personal characteristics, friends and pro
found spiritual and philosophical questions. My overly
melodramatic friend's blog contains this line: "Anyways,
I had a great summer. A summer of change, of growth,
of growing up, of nothing much." This immediately
elicited comments such as "I don't think I want my name
attached to a blog that allows people like you to post
blogs like the last one" and "I think I need a beer to af
firm my manhood after that statement." Judging by the
number of comments this type of blog generates, some
people must find them entertaining.
Yet another category of blog manages to be both ego
centric and superficial. The authors of these blogs pay lit

tie attention to whether their entries are interesting,
choosing instead to list mundane details from daily life.
My friend, whose blog clearly falls into this category, gra
ciously allowed me to take the following excerpts from his
oh-so-stimulating journal: "So tired... Gotz to eat, exer
cise, and do some errands. Errrr ", "Hmm... what
to say... ", and my personal favorite, "Hot dogs ROCK.
S— I wish I could eat them all day. Oh wait I do."
Some people manage to pull off this type of blog pretty
well because they lead interesting lives. Most Stanford stu
dents, who spend their time sitting in classrooms, doing
homework or dashing off to extracurricular activities, donot
Another of my findings: The blog community at Stan
ford is huge. The Xanga blog ring I visited contains 193 dif
ferent personal pages. There are likely countless others out
there that are either use a different service from Xanga or
are not linked with the blog ring. These kind of numbers
made me wonder what makes blogging so popular. To an
swer this, I asked a random sampling of people, "Why are
blogs so popular?" Here are some of the responses I got
"People are inherently egocentric and believe that
their lives are interesting enough to record."
"It's fun to post your thoughts to the world and to
read what other people are thinking."
"Because they allow someone to be impersonal
about their personal life."

The most thoughtful reply, however, comes from Gra
ham Walker, a graduate student at the Medical School.
Blogging is "just another way that our society is trying to
keep in touch, even though we're seemingly further apart
than ever," Walker says. "I'm dating someone in Chicago,
my parents are in Kansas City. I have friends at jobs and
grad schools across the country (and world). Blogging's a
great way to keep up-to-date with how someone's doing in
the grand scheme of things and also with the minutae that
make that person interesting. Stuff you don't get on a
phone call. Blogging kind of provides this open forum
where you can share your thoughts, no matter how mun
dane or bizarre. The quirkier the better."
These reasons, perhaps, explain the staying power of
meticulous online descriptions of people's relationship
woes and sci-fi convention visits. Okay, it may be true
that most blogs fall squarely in the egotistical / superfi
cial category, very few get read by anyone except the au
thor's indulgent friends, and this kind of writing is no way
to lure in a readership of luscious hotties. But blogs con
tinue to thrive because there is something innately satis
fying about being able to keep up with the happenings in
other peoples' fives, as well as being able to broadcast
your own every move. As my friend (the one with the
boring blog) put it, "It's not always interesting, but
you're still reading it, aren't you?"

A friend told me a while ago that he had started doing
this thing called Livejournal (www.livejournal.com),
which he explained was "sort of like an online diary."
Ever the caring, sensitive friend, I responded, "Online
diary? You f—ing pansy!" I thought no more about it
until a few days later when, totally bored, I decided to
check out his site.
Livejournal (as well as Xanga, Blogger and other
such journal sites) works like this: The creator of the
diary registers with the Web site in order to start a per
sonal Web page. The user can then post text entries and
edit the layout without going through the hassle of deal
ing with HTML. Other people can directly access the
completed personal page, read entries and post com
ments. The user can also link the page (called a blog) to
those of his or her friends. Or he can join a "blog ring" of
