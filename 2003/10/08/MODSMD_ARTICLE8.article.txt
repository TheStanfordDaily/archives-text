# Do online communities for Asians alienate other surfers?

### ARAMHUR 
You're walking down the street. Weird all the people
you see are Asian. Job offers and scholarship fliers are shoved
in your face. Around you, people engage in heated debates or
just chat carelessly.
Welcome to Asian Avenue.
But what is Asian Avenue? When asked this question,
Stanford students' guesses ranged from "a street in China
town" to "an Asian store." Asian Avenue, however, is actual
ly an online community geared specifically to Asians.
According to the Pew Internet Project, 75 percent of
Asians are wired, beating out web usage by all other minorities
by at least a 30 percent margin. In order to take advantage of
this emerging market niche, an increasing number of sites are
being custom-designed for Asians.
The issue, some say, is that the recent boom in the number
of such sites remains an exclusively Asian phenomenon im
plying that users of other ethnicities are being excluded from
the catered benefits of the web.
Even as public facilities providing free Internet access have
been acting to mitigate the digital divide, ethnic-oriented sites
have created a new cyber ailment: the racial divide.
Asian Avenue is the brainchild of Community Connect
Inc., a company that targets Asians, Latinos and African-
Americans through a trio of ethnic sites: Asian Avenue, Mi
Gente and Black Planet. Launched in 1997, Asian Avenue
boasts more than three million members.
The secret behind its success? Its vast networking pool. Unlike
the multitude of Internet sites that provide run-of-the-mill pack
ages comprised of free chat rooms access and e-mail accounts,
Asian Avenue stands out by supplying members with valuable in
formation about jobs, career options and scholarships.
Due to its specialized nature as an ethnic niche, the site is
far from diverse. Only 8 percent of the total members of Asian
Avenue are non-Asian. According to Benjamin Sun, chief ex
ecutive of Community Connect Inc., the company receives an
average of five to 10 e-mails each week accusing it of aggra
vating segregation on the web.
Racial tension within ethnic sites also concerns the sites'
critics. A former user of Black Planet, who opted to remain
anonymous, claims he canceled his membership due to racism.
"Someone posted on a forum that there was racism in the
site," he says. "People started putting up some ugly words, and
I got so disgusted that I just came out."
Self-segregation by race or ethnicity is widely acknowledged
to be a prevalent phenomenon in "real," offline society; some
claim that while online interaction between people from differ
ent backgrounds could help alleviate this, online content
providers are not fulfilling their social responsibility to unite peo
ple from different backgrounds. Sun, however, defends ethnic
sites, contending that there is no exclusionary policy in effect.
"Our sites aren't exclusive," he says.
He argues that the accusations brought against ethnic sites
are not specific to the online realm.
"Take any example from reality," Sun says. "Ethnic-orient
ed hospitals or youth groups aren't accused of creating racial
barriers. Such race-based division can happen in any society."
Meanwhile, the corporate world simply views ethnic-spe
cific sites as another lucrative market. Sun says that Asian-tar
geted businesses purchase only 13 percent of Asian Avenue's
advertising space, while advertisements by large corporations,
such as Hewlett-Packard and Target, occupy the majority of
space. By making such figures available, Sun implies that per
ceptions of Asian Avenue as a racially exclusive business site
are based on incorrect assumptions.
But why do these sites attract such an enthusiastic follow
ing? Some think that minorities derive a sense of social en
gagement from the cyber world, deficient in "real," main
stream society.
"It is but a mere manifestation of a larger problem," says se
nior Jun Suh. "Even three or four generations after immigra
tion, Asian-Americans still refuse to fully assimilate them
selves into the mainstream American culture and thus segre
gate themselves."
Others dismiss such assessments of the sites' power to
stymie positive inter-ethnic interaction. "I think people still
rely upon physical [offline] human interaction to develop then
identities. Until that changes, I don't see these sites having any
negative impact," says sophomore Derrick Jue.
Freshman Soung-Hun Lee contends that users flock to ethnic
sites not because they feel excluded from mainstream society,
but because they can share common interests more easily. "It's
an exaggeration to relate that to racial segregation," says Lee.
The cyber racial divide is widening even at this very mo
ment; Just yesterday 6,825 members were logged onto Asian
Avenue, with considerable usage on Black Planet (33,066) and
Mi Gente (8,369). The question, however, is whether ethnic
sites engender a new divide or simply reflect the divide already
inherent in offline society. In a swiftly shrinking "global vil
lage," can there also be room for celebration of diversity?
The once-popular melting pot model of American society,
emphasizing assimilation to mainstream society, has lost rele
vance, and public sentiment has shifted to the salad-bowl
model. The beauty of diversity depends on groups of individ
uals coexisting while simultaneously belonging to one society.
The various ethnic sites springing up on the web are a direct re
flection of reality part of the salad bowl of the cyber realm.
