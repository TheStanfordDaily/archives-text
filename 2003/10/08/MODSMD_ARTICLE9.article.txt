# Answer Boy solves the job-hunt riddle
## 
### 
Q: I sallied forth to the career fair today and,
in the four hours since, prospective employers
haven't been blowing up my pager, so to speak.
My sign's hung out, but Goldman Sachs and
Merrill Lynch are not exactly coming a
knockin'. I have a 4.61 GPA, worked my fingers
to the bone teaching basket-weaving to help
people in need reenter the workforce with
saleable skills and am writing and producing my
own rock opera. Answer Boy, what gives?
A: Well, my overzealous friend, you're on

the right path. I can see you now, the picture
of professionalism: a snappy briefcase, a
polka-dot bow tie and the well-parted hairdo
with the quirky cowlick that says "I'm respon
sible, but I know how to let loose." You wild
cat, you.
However, now is the time to relax. Give
your prospective employers time. They're
probably busy negotiating $139.5 million
golden-parachute retirement packages for
themselves or using corporate funds to
buy their daughters' dream dates with

Ashton Kutcher / Paul Walker / [fill in
overrated, under-talented celebrity of the
week here].
Nonetheless, feel free to follow up with the
recruiter. Give 'em a call. This will establish
you as a go-getter. Maybe you can talk about
your rock opera. Maybe not.
In the future, ask the recruiter what the
next step in the application process is. That
way you'll avoid this soul-wrenching limbo.
Work on your handshake as well a nice,
firm grip is the goal, and I have a feeling you're

a weak-fish kind of guy.
And while it's good to
bring a resume, bringing 100
copies is overkill. You
should know at least a little
about the companies you
approach. It's a bad thing
when your first question is,
"Just what the hell do you
guys do, anyway?"
Plus, you could always
just kiss the proverbial ass.
