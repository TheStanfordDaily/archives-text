And jobs to people.
It wouldn't be clear to every firm that
a man with an M.F. A. in poetry was
the right choice to head an automated
block trading unit. Or that a designer of
solar-powered race cars was the right
woman to help launch a new venture in
computational chemistry. But after we
talked to them, it was clear to us.
The D. E. Shaw group is an investment
and technology development firm.
Since 1988 we've grown into a number
of closely related entities with approxi
mately US $5 billion in aggregate
capital by hiring smart people from a
wide range of backgrounds and letting
them implement—and manage—what
they invent. A robotics guru.
A nationally ranked blackjack player.
An operatic mezzo-soprano. And a lot
of people who are just exceptionally
strong in CS, EE, math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings
quantitative analysis, software devel
opment, information technology,
computer architecture, business devel
opment, computational chemistry,
finance, and accounting. We're looking
for creative but pragmatic people: artic
ulate, curious, and driven. Our working
environment is intense but surpris
ingly casual. We provide unusual
opportunities for growth. And we com
pensate extraordinary people extraor
dinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will host an
information session on Thursday,
October 30 at 6:00 PM in the Gates
Building, Room 104. On-campus inter
views will take place October 31.
