# Stanford in Moscow will close this year

Citing low student interest and fiscal infeasi
bility, Stanford's Overseas Studies Program an
nounced yesterday it will be temporarily clos
ing its center in Moscow at the end of the year.
"There's a general budget issue at the Uni
versity," said Amos Nur, director of the Over
seas Studies Program. "If we have plenty of
money we can go along with the program for a
while. But since we had a budget cut, like
everyone else, we had to take a harder look at
all our programs.
"The other programs we instituted major
cuts in expenses," Nur continued. "In Russia,
we realized that the only way we can cut it is by
transforming it into a program that has very
low fixed costs."
The closure is temporary, according to the
OSP, and provisions are being made for re
opening the center in a format that is more
cost-effective. Currently, the center is a fixed
cost program; there are expenses, such as staff
salaries, that do not vary with the number of
people enrolled. When few students partici
pate, the cost becomes prohibitively expensive
for the students.
"This has been brewing for a long time,"
said Jack Kollmann, academic coordinator of
the Center for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies, who taught in Moscow in
1997. "The faculty has had contact with OSP
for years. We've understood for a long time
that the Moscow campus was expensive and
was drawing relatively few students.
"OSP let it get expensive," Kollmann con
tinued. "Not so much the present administra
tion. They invested money in it hoping it would
grow and it didn't. It might have been more
cost-effective if it has grown. Moscow has got
ten expensive since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Space is costly. Salaries have become
real salaries, in dollars. Also, Stanford chooses
to pay Stanford wages to people it hires around
the world."
Students who had traveled to Stanford in
Moscow expressed disbelief and disappoint
ment at the news of the center's closing.
"As of right now they're stopping the pro
gram, they're not saying 'let's cut costs,' " said
Michael Keiser, a co-terminal student who
spent part of his undergraduate career in
Moscow. "It's just shocking to toss it away, it's
a 10-year investment."
Keiser said he thought the decision was
paradoxical, because interest in international
relations has been on the rise. This surge in in
terest has been expressed at Stanford through
the recent donation to expand Islamic Studies
