# Stanford in Moscow will close this year
## 
### ILENA GEORGE DESK EDITOR 
Citing low student interest and fiscal infeasi
bility, Stanford's Overseas Studies Program an
nounced yesterday it will be temporarily clos
ing its center in Moscow at the end of the year.
"There's a general budget issue at the Uni
versity," said Amos Nur, director of the Over
seas Studies Program. "If we have plenty of
money we can go along with the program for a
while. But since we had a budget cut, like
everyone else, we had to take a harder look at
all our programs.
"The other programs we instituted major
cuts in expenses," Nur continued. "In Russia,
we realized that the only way we can cut it is by
transforming it into a program that has very
low fixed costs."
The closure is temporary, according to the
OSP, and provisions are being made for re
opening the center in a format that is more
cost-effective. Currently, the center is a fixed
cost program; there are expenses, such as staff
salaries, that do not vary with the number of
people enrolled. When few students partici
pate, the cost becomes prohibitively expensive
for the students.
"This has been brewing for a long time,"
said Jack Kollmann, academic coordinator of
the Center for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies, who taught in Moscow in
1997. "The faculty has had contact with OSP
for years. We've understood for a long time
that the Moscow campus was expensive and
was drawing relatively few students.
"OSP let it get expensive," Kollmann con
tinued. "Not so much the present administra
tion. They invested money in it hoping it would
grow and it didn't. It might have been more
cost-effective if it has grown. Moscow has got
ten expensive since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Space is costly. Salaries have become
real salaries, in dollars. Also, Stanford chooses
to pay Stanford wages to people it hires around
the world."
Students who had traveled to Stanford in
Moscow expressed disbelief and disappoint
ment at the news of the center's closing.
"As of right now they're stopping the pro
gram, they're not saying 'let's cut costs,' " said
Michael Keiser, a co-terminal student who
spent part of his undergraduate career in
Moscow. "It's just shocking to toss it away, it's
a 10-year investment."
Keiser said he thought the decision was
paradoxical, because interest in international
relations has been on the rise. This surge in in
terest has been expressed at Stanford through
the recent donation to expand Islamic Studies
and a new plan for a large develop
ment campaign for international
studies that is currently in the works.
OSP does not know how or when
the necessary changes will be imple
mented to re-open the program.
"The basic thing we are looking
at is to have a program that's affili
ated with some kind of learning in
stitution for instance, a center
for political studies and see if we
can make an arrangement," Nur
said. "I cannot tell you how long it
will take but if we find the right pro
gram and the right institution. It
could happen very fast."
Nur said the search process has
begun and that there are several po
tential organizations whose in
volvement will allow the program to
re-open by providing resources
such as space to hold classes.
"It depends on how lucky we'll
be in finding one of these institu
tions and how ready they are to ac
commodate us," he said. "I think it's
realistic to assume that by spring of
2005 we'll have something."

Stanford in Moscow has a slight
ly different perspective.
"The basic problem that is the
core of the current situation is real
ly financial," said Maxim Bratersky,
director of Stanford in Moscow. "I
think it's a very good program but,
simply, the flow of people is not
enough to support it in this shape.
"The bottom line of the problem
is that Moscow and Russia have a
booming economy with prices going
up and there are no cheap solutions
at all," he continued. "I'm opti
mistic in the sense that something

will be created on this spot, but it
will be something really different.
Everything is relative; there would
be no problem if we had more stu
dents, but the relative expenses [of
labor and real estate in Moscow] are
just too high to continue. If we had
more students, this problem
wouldn't arise at all."
The closure of the Moscow cen
ter follows closely on the heels of
the termination of two other over
seas sites: Puebla in Mexico and
Buenos Aires in Argentina, which
were discontinued after last year.

"In Puebla, it wasn't our program
it was a program with the univer
sity there," Nur said. "Students went
there and took courses at the univer
sity. We didn't have our own direc
tor or professors. Students by and
large didn't find the content very ex
citing. Buenos Aires, it was the same
thing. It was very nice, with good
people, but it didn't have extra, com
pelling content."
Lack of interest in the Russia
program partly stems from the fact
that there are a limited number of
students studying Slavic languages
and related fields at Stanford. Nur
explained that efforts were made to
try and attract students from larger
majors such as biology and eco
nomics but to no avail.
"The interest just isn't there,"
said Nur. "Once the Soviet Union
collapsed it wasn't that exciting any
more."
Kollmann mentioned other fac
tors contributing to the relative un
popularity of the site.
"The challenge of the foreign
language, the fact that Russia is no
longer as exciting as it seemed a few
years ago for possible careers," he
said. "Bright young people are de
ciding to do other things."
This is not true for all students.

"It was definitely a dividing point
in my life" Keiser said. "I can clear
ly say before [Moscow] and after.
It's hard to get further away from
what you know. We have something
very unique ... Moscow is 11 time
zones away. It's an experience."
"I thought it was a fantastic pro
gram," said Christian Eversull, a
medical student who went to
Moscow as an undergraduate in
1998. "It was well staffed and the
people there bent over backward to
give the students any kind of acade
mic experience. From my point of
view it's unfortunate that other peo
ple won't have that opportunity."
Despite the enthusiasm ex
pressed by several students, polls
conducted by the OSP found that
students expressed greater interest
in studying in China, India and the
Middle East, with lower interest in
Russia, Nur said.
In response to the information
gathered about students' interests,
the OSP is investigating new op
tions. This year, a program opened
in Australia, with 47 students en
rolled. According to Nur, a center in
Beijing is set to open in the near fu
ture, with new sites on the horizon.
"I'm working on three other pos
sible centers: India, Mexico and

Spain," Nur said. "India is a no
brainer. The demand is there, the
content what India has to offer in
terms of insight in terms of culture
and history a lot of students want
to go there and it's difficult to go
there without some infrastructure.
"It's a shameful situation that
we're not more heavily involved in
learning to understand Mexico," he
continued. "We're talking about
something that would involve an af
filiation with National Institution of
Public Health."
Spain remains an attractive op
tion, but hasn't been explored in
depth.
"We've just begun to look at pos
sible arrangements," Nur said.
"Half of Stanford undergraduates
speak Spanish, so the demand for
Spanish programs is high."
Nur said global politics has shifted
relations between the United States
and China have essentially replaced
the connection between the United
States and the former Soviet Union as
pre-eminent in people's minds.
"It doesn't mean that Russia is
less important to go to than a place
like Chile," Keiser said. "It's a very
interesting time there. There's still a
transition between communism
and, hopefully, democracy."
