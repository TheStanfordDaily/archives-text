## Now is the time to get pumped

Yesterday morning, Californians
woke up to a new governor. Almost
60 percent of the state's registered
voters went to the polls on Tuesday
and voted to unseat Gov. Gray Davis. The peo
ple, who passed the recall and voted over
whelmingly for Arnold Schwarzennegger to
replace Davis as governor, have spoken.
We hope that the recall a sad chapter in
California history can end with Davis's con
cession to Schwarzennegger TUesday night. We
hope that no one will mount an effort to recall
the state's new governor. And we hope that this
provision of the state constitution will be used
much more sparingly and carefully in the future.
Now that Schwarzennegger has won the
election to replace Davis, he has significant

challenges to face. California is in the midst
of a budget crisis. The state's schools are in
dire straits. And the Golden State's image is
seriously tarnished.
Schwarzenneger must get ready to be a se
rious leader and tackle these issues. One-lin
ers from his movies will not solve the prob
lems facing California. He and his advisers
must carefully craft well thought-out policies
to get the state back on track.
After a long and divisive effort to recall
Davis, Schwarzennegger and Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante should work together to restore
harmony and stability to the state. The two
are both very talented, and we hope that they
will both contribute to building a shining fu
ture for the Golden State.
