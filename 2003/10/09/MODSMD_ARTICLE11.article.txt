# Students need more S.F. options

With a lack of parties and social
activities on campus, many stu
dents may look to San Francis
co to fill the lull in weekend ac
tivities. However, getting there can be a
problem. For the second year in a row, Cal
train remains closed on weekends — though
a substitute Caltrain bus is offered to replace
this service. But students wanting to explore
the city in the evening, after 8:30 p.m., may
find themselves stranded.
Last year, the ASSU began a Marguerite
shuttle service to provide transportation from
the city after midnight on Saturdays. Howev
er, ASSU Vice President Joey Natoli claims
that demand dropped off for the Marguerite
service soon after the program began. The ser
vice was soon discontinued.
We urge the ASSU to give the program

another try. When it was originally con
ceived, planners hoped that the shuttle ser
vices would later be expanded to offer trans
portation to the entire Bay Area. The pro
gram was hardly given time to prosper.
Perhaps Marguerite services could be or
ganized for certain cultural, musical and
sporting events, when demand is greater.
While bus riders may have dwindled in the
past, it may have been due to the lack of
marketing. Many students didn't even know
of the program existed.
Regardless of small fluctuations in de
mand for transportation to the city, students
need a consistent option for off-campus ac
tivities. We can hardly boast a 30-mile prox
imity to San Francisco when a great portion
of our student population can't get there —
or can't make it back home from the city.
