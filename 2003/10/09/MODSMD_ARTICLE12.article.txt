## Food for thought 
### STEVEN TADELIS 
As a resident fellow of Burbank, I
eat in Stern hall every day. I've been
doing this for three years now and I
have one thing to say: I am a happy
camper. I was therefore extremely
disappointed to read the rather unin
formed and misguided critique of
Stanford Dining written up in the
Daily's editorial "A bad taste in our
mouths" from Oct. 2. Not only did I
find the exposition harsh, and the
judgment of Stanford Dining's per
formance very shallow and poor, I
was offended by the information
that the author presented in the edi
torial.
As an economist, let me look at
some "bang-for-your-buck" argu
ments first. At the end of the editori-

al it says, "The food usually
isn't that good especially
given that each meal costs
about $B. In. fact, Students
would be better served eating
every meal of the quarter at
local food joints like Fresh
Choice, Subway or Baja Fresh
and they would still proba
bly pay less." Indeed, the food
at Spago is better. But Fresh
Choice? Subway? Baja
Fresh? Maybe I have a taste

for healthier, more colorful and fla
vorful food than the author of the ed
itorial, but I find the average quality
of Stanford dining superior to these
other places. As for the costs, let me
use Fresh Choice as a comparison,
since I have frequented the place
thanks to the preferences of my two
young ones. Fresh Choice gives you
a great bang for your buck at $7.55
for lunch and $9.17 for dinner, that
is, if you don't care much about eat
ing meat products, you like Jell-0
for dessert and you drink tap water.
Turning to some ill informed
facts, the third paragraph of the edi
torial says that students "automati
cally incur a charge of $379 to cover
overhead for dining facilities and
their "efficient managing." This
number is not charged by any meal

plan, but it is rather a result of a very
misguided calculation, that later ap
pears in the editorial. Namely, the R
meal plan for Manzanita and Wilbur
a la carte dining (also called the Lite
A La Carte meal plan), costs $1,403
in return for 1,024 meal plan points,
which the author of the editorial
then interprets as "a per-point cost
of $1.37." The same surcharge is
charged for the other a la carte plans,
but since they have more value, the
per-point cost is a bit cheaper (think
of this as a volume discount). Now
let's think about this for a second in
two ways. First, for a la carte service
Stanford Dining needs to have a
more accurate way of providing
well-defined portions, since you pay
per item and it is not all-you-can-eat.
This translates immediately into.

more labor, and therefore more
labor costs. Unlike what the editori
al says, this charge is not needed "to
subsidize the organization's costs,"
but rather to compensate Stanford
Dining for adding the a la carte flex
ibility that some students so eagerly
ask for in the surveys that Stanford
Dining initiates. Yes, it is all about
you. Second, let's compare the point
cost of a simple lunch at Wilbur to a
meal at the Treehouse (in Tresid
der). A full-blown burrito at Wilbur
is 5.95 points, and a 12 oz. drink is 0.8
points, making this filling lunch a
whopping 6.75 points. At the Tree
house this will cost you $7.78. The
conversion rate is 1.15, indeed less
than the a la carte plans. However,
unlike the Treehouse, Wilbur and
Manzanita offers a larger variety of

food (and yes, diversity costs money)
and the wait in line is much shorter.
The editorial says, "While a charge
for overhead is understandable, a 40
percent surcharge is not." Well, it is
on average closer to 30 percent, and
controlling for alternative options
makes it at 15 percent, a very reason
able overhead.
As for the flexibility of where to
eat, the editorial says that "a student
in Roble Hall, for example, must se
lect from the same old meal options
at Lake Lagunita, while his peer at
Wilbur must choose only from the a
la carte options in his dining hall."
Here too the author of the editorial
presents information that contra
dicts the facts. As most students on
campus know, every student with an
all-you-can-eat meal plan (like at

Roble) can eat at any other
all-you can-eat cafeteria,
including Stern, FloMo and
Ricker. Moreover, every
student with points can eat
anywhere he or she wishes!
The follow-up statement in
the editorial says that
"Normally, friends in dif
ferent dorms can only eat
together if they spend pre
cious guest point," which
again is plainly incorrect.

Stanford Dining has put in the effort
to centralize the computer system
that reads students' cards precisely
to allow for this flexibility. Putting
on my economist's hat again, this has
an extra benefit: If the food in some
dining hall goes down in quality, stu
dents can vote with their feet and
move on elsewhere, sending a clear
signal to the providers. You see, it is
all about you.

Steve Tadelis is an assistant professor
in the economics department, a resi
dent fellow in Burbank and the hus
band of the CFO of Stanford Dining.
He adds, however, that he has other
ways to get her approval, and writing
favorably about Stanford Dining in
the Daily is not top on that list. He can
