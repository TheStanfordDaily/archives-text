## ORDER IN THE COURT? Why Congress fears library porn 
### 
Last term, the Supreme
Court decided United
States vs. American Li
brary Association, holding
that Congress could deny federal
funding for Internet connections in
public libraries that refused to install
filtering software to prevent patrons
from accessing indecent content.
Finding that the statute was permis
sible in light of the government's in
terest in preventing minors from
viewing harmful content, six justices
agreed that the policy would not in
fringe First Amendment rights as
long as adult patrons could ask to
have the filters turned off. It was a
sad day for librarians, the American
Civil Liberties Union and diehard
fans of Internet pornography.
Let's put the constitutional ques
tion aside and talk about this policy
for a minute. What on earth was
Congress thinking? Who the heck
goes to the public library to surf for
porn? Maybe things are different at
the Library of Congress, but at my
local library, I don't see a lot of shady
looking guys in dirty trench coats
camping out in front of the computer
screens. In every library I've ever
been to, the terminals are out in the
open you'd need some real chutz

pah to even go so far as to view the
mildly titillating content found on the
Victoria's Secret Web site.
The Court noted a Congressional
study suggesting that about 2,000 peo
ple accessed indecent materials from
local libraries. Even if we accept those
numbers, isn't that just a drop in the
bucket compared to the number of
people who use public libraries? Fur
thermore, given the embarrassment
factor, aren't these hits more likely to
have come from the small subset of li
braries where the computers are more
privately located, and thus unlikely to
be viewed by an innocent child passer
by? Finally, if we're worried that these
2,000 people were themselves minors,
do we really think that library filters
will suddenly make them fine models
of sexual prudence?
There's simply no justification for
Congress imposing such a burden on
the library-going population at large.
And make no mistake; even if filters
can be turned off by request, they're
a huge burden. The technology isn't
perfect, and it never will be: It fails to
block some pornographic Web sites,
and blocks some non-pornographic
ones. While this first problem merely
highlights the ineffectiveness of
Congress's plan, the second creates

some serious pnvacy issues.
Say I five in a small town and I'm
worried I've contracted HIV. If want
to research STDs on the Internet, I
have to go up to the librarian who
may very well be my next door
neighbor and ask, "Could you
please deactivate the porn filter?" I,
for one, would never be able to do
that. (I'm aÂ»guy I've been known
to wander around the supermarket
for half an hour looking for eggs
rather than ask for help.)
The idea that libraries are red
fight districts is so silly that I wonder
whether protecting kids isn't simply
an excuse for something more insid
ious. Who really gets hurt by the de
cision? People who can't afford pri
vate Internet connections. So the
rich not only get tax breaks, they
also get a monopoly on Internet
porn? Say it ain't so. The Internet,
even those parts of it that some soft
ware filter labels as "indecent,"
should be open to all.
