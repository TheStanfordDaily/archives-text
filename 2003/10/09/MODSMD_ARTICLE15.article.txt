# OP-ED
## Stanford Dining tries to satisfy all 
### NADEEM SIDDIQUI, JANE CAMARILLO, SHIRLEY EVERETT TIM WAGNER 
We are disheartened to that the
editorial pubhshed on Oct. 2 ("A
bad taste in our mouths") did not
take into account the many positive
changes made by Stanford Dining —
the same changes that were applaud
ed by The Stanford Daily editorial
board just last winter, on Feb. 28,
2002.
The editorial also did not recog
nize Stanford Dining's operational
realities. To better understand its
performance and cost structure, one
must to compare our meal plans to
schools and universities with similar
residential education programs, geo
graphical conditions, cost of living
and labor market. In these aspects,
Stanford Dining meets, and in most
cases exceeds, industry standards.
Stanford Dining employs more
than 250 talented and committed
staff members who share one com
mon goal: to serve our students, fac
ulty, staff and guests with the highest
quality nutritious food and excep
tional service, in a fiscally responsi
ble manner. Your mean-spirited ed
itorial greatly affected our staff, all
of whom are passionate, work ex
tremely hard and take pride in then
work, which is evidenced by the very
positive customer survey ratings
they receive.
As an auxiliary service Stanford
Dining must generate its own rev
enue and fully manage all of its costs
on a break-even basis. Dining offers

competitive wages and excellent
benefits to staff (including dental,
health, life, retirement, vacation and
sick pay), and this is reflected in the
pricing of our products and services.
Stanford Dining employs union
labor in one of the highest priced
labor markets in the country, and
must also pay utilities, insurance,
overhead cost, maintenance and re
pair, and the "debt service" on all of
its renovations. No tuition dollars
support Stanford Dining.
Students on meal plans with Stan
ford Dining, along with the 36 student
managed Row Houses, Dining Soci
eties and Eating Clubs, are all re
quired to subscribe to a mandatory
meal plan depending on their resi
dence. This is in support of Residen
tial Education's philosophy to pro
mote intellectual discussion during
meals. A large number of these Row
House residences offer food services
at prices similar to the ones offered by
Stanford Dining, but with fewer meals
per week and fewer choices per meal.
The Residential Education pro
gram is an essential element of com
munity-building and faculty involve
ment, and is fundamental to the un
dergraduate experience. While this
de-centralized style of service is pro
grammatically highly effective, it is
operationally less cost effective.
The availability of small dining
rooms where individual houses can
share meals is distinctive in compar
ison with our peers. This enables
residential staff and students to con
nect in ways that would not be possi
ble if dining options were solely of

fered in a few large and impersonal
dining commons located across
campus. Serving meals in many lo
cations does not allow the
economies of scale like most univer
sities that provide service in a more
centralized manner.
Student groups and the Dining
Committee play an essential role in
working with Stanford Dining to de
velop new meal plan options. Based
on that collaboration, 12 different
meal plans are now offered, which
speaks directly to Stanford Dining's
flexibility and responsiveness in
meeting student preferences. This is
in sharp contrast to other universi
ties: For example, Harvard Univer
sity requires all housed students to
participate, regardless of their resi
dence, in a mandatory meal plan
that provides only one option (21
meals per week).
Stanford Dining's continuous
commitment to enhancing services
while reducing operational costs
without sacrificing quality is
paramount. In the future, we trust
that you will take into account these
operating realities in your editorials.
