## If you have to dance, please do it alone 
### 
One of the best aspects of profes
sional sports is that you can sit
down to watch a game thinking
you've seen it all before, and over
the next several hours be reminded that you
haven't.
Case in point: Monday night's football game.
What, did you think I was going to write
about: the baseball playoffs?
For those who missed it, including half of
the sorry fans in attendance who left early to
beat that annoying late-night Tampa, Fla.
traffic, the Indianapolis Colts became the
first team in NFL history to come back and
win a game after trailing by 21 or more
points with less than four minutes to play.
The Colts scored four touchdowns in the
fourth quarter to tie the game against a Buc
caneers defense that had given up a total of

two touchdowns in the pre
vious 15 quarters.
Believe it or not, the
most absurd part of the
game wasn't a single play,
the officiating or a coaching
decision, but the three sec
onds of TV delivered by a
Tampa Bay defensive line
man in his pre-recorded
self-introduction: "Simeon
Rice, Playa University."
Simeon Rice went here?

As would any true Playa alumnus, Rice
(who went to Illinois) figured prominently in
the outcome of the game, being penalized
for unsportsmanlike conduct on the correct
interpretation of an obscure rule that set up
the game-winning field goal in overtime.
Rice's remark was one of the many
smaller, weekly reminders the NFL pro
vides that we haven't in fact seen it all, and
illustrates the disturbing trend of players
drawing attention to themselves by what
ever means necessary.
The most common means is through cele
bration. Tune-in to Fox or CBS on Sunday
and it's like watching a three-hour episode of
"Making the Video," as players bust out
ridiculous dance moves after plays that
would make Brittney Spears blush and Bey
once squirm.
Warren Sapp's display after his first, and
hopefully only, career touchdown reception
two weeks ago was horrendous. You know
that cheesy and overused quote you see on
coffee mugs and in your friends' AIM pro
files, "Dance like nobody's watching"? Well,
for some players Sapp included the
advice should read, "Dance like nobody's
watching when, and only when, nobody's
watching."
Sapp can be forgiven, if only because the
old saying, "Act like you've been there be
fore" did not apply to him. But even for play
ers more accustomed to finding the endzone,
the good old-fashioned spike seems to have
gone the way of the typewriter.
Refined touchdown dances of the past,
such as Ickey Woods's "Ickey Shuffle" and
Ernest Givins's "Electric Slide," have
given way to a new breed of celebration.
Tony Gonzalez jumps and slams the foot
ball over the goalpost as a testament to his
dunking days as a two-sport start at Cal and
Packers players perform the Lambeau
Leap.
These are tolerable, within reason, but
celebrations at the end of every play, taunt
ing sacked quarterbacks and showing up op
ponents at every opportunity? Not so much.
Last Sunday, I saw footballs that were
spun like tops, slammed against walls and
flung toward other players. I saw strutting,
posing and pelvic thrusts. To make matters
worse, these occurred after routine inter
ceptions, six-yard receptions and tackles
following big gains. Will we soon see chore
ographed moves for winning the coin toss?
Defensive players mimic undertakers,
digging an imaginary grave into the turf after
leveling quarterbacks, flail their arms or
prance like oversized gazelles.
Where do they teach moves like this or
that celebrating the routine is fashionable?
Playa University?
The rest of the league could learn a lesson
in class from the Colts' performance Mon
day night. Peyton Manning and Marvin Har
rison, who had plenty to celebrate, saved the
majority of it for the locker room and they
weren't any less fun to watch.
Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting
that referees turn the NFL into Beaumont
from "Footloose," but league officials
shouldn't pretend to be cracking down on
excessive celebration and taunting when it's
happening more often than ever.
The solution? Have referees celebrate
more. Nothing would get the crowd going
like a little jig or shimmy from the zebras
after throwing the yellow hanky for a hold
ing penalty. Penalize excessive celebration
and taunting more often, abandon the gener
ic hand signals and mimic the dance or mo
tion that drew the flag.
When this happens, I will have seen it all.

worse, these occurred after routine inter
ceptions, six-yard receptions and tackles
following big gains. Will we soon see chore
ographed moves for winning the coin toss?
Defensive players mimic undertakers,
digging an imaginary grave into the turf after
leveling quarterbacks, flail their arms or
prance like oversized gazelles.
Where do they teach moves like this or
that celebrating the routine is fashionable?
Playa University?
The rest of the league could learn a lesson
in class from the Colts' performance Mon
day night. Peyton Manning and Marvin Har
rison, who had plenty to celebrate, saved the
majority of it for the locker room and they
weren't any less fun to watch.
Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting
that referees turn the NFL into Beaumont
from "Footloose," but league officials
shouldn't pretend to be cracking down on
excessive celebration and taunting when it's
happening more often than ever.
The solution? Have referees celebrate
more. Nothing would get the crowd going
like a little jig or shimmy from the zebras
after throwing the yellow hanky for a hold
ing penalty. Penalize excessive celebration
and taunting more often, abandon the gener
ic hand signals and mimic the dance or mo
tion that drew the flag.
When this happens, I will have seen it all.
