## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford (2-1, 0-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) may have had the weekend off, but
the rest of the Pac-10 teams were busy
jockeying for position.
UCLA (3-2,1-0) almost doubled its sea
son point total in shocking Washington (3-
2, 1-1), 46-16, dropping the Huskies from
the national rankings. Oregon (4-2, 1-1)
also fell out of the rankings after losing, 17-
13, to nonconference foe Utah (4-1).
But the status quo was maintained else
where. No. 9 Southern California (4-1,1-1)
rallied in the second half to defeat Arizona
State (2-3, 0-2), 37-17, No. 12 Washington
State (5-1,2-0) rolled past visiting Arizona
(1-5, 0-2), 30-7, and No. 24 Oregon State
(5-1,2-0) moved into the national rankings
after trumping California (3-4,1-1), 35-21,
in Berkeley.
In Los Angeles, the offensively-chal
lenged Bruins fell behind the Huskies at
halftime, 16-7 and then came out in the
second half and posted 39 unanswered
points. Drew Olson passed for 281 yards,
while Manuel White Jr. and Tyler Ebell
combined for 152 yards rushing. The Bru
ins scores four rushing touchdowns on the
day. Washington quarterback Cody Pick
ett was intercepted twice, and backup
Cory Paus once.
Utah quarterback Alex Smith looked
polished in his first collegiate start,
throwing for 340 yards and both of the
Utes' touchdowns. Oregon, a week after
making nine turnovers against Washing
ton State, made only two, but didn't score
in the second half. Terrence Whitehead
managed just 45 yards rushing on 18 car
ries for the Ducks.
USC, a week after a shocking loss to
Cal, rode a breakout game by LenDale
White to an easy win over the Sun Devils.
White ran for 141 yards and two scores,
while both Mike Williams and Keary Col
bert totaled over 100 yards receiving.
Ryan Killeen booted three field goals and
four extra points without a miss to aid the
Trojan cause.
The Cougars rolled up 513 yards to the
Wildcats' 198 as Arizona proved as futile
under new coach Mike Hankwitz as
under John Mackovic, who was fired two
weeks ago. Matt Kegel passed for 315
yards for the Cougars, while freshman
Kris Heavner managed just 128 yards
through the air for the Wildcats.
