The Stanford men's varsity crew team will start its fall
season on Saturday as host of the Fall Regatta at the new
The Stanford Rowing and Sailing Center.
The long-awaited 16,500 square-foot boathouse cost $5
million to build and is located near the Port of Redwood
City. The official dedication of the center will take place on
Oct. 19 at 10 a.m. during Alumni Weekend.
This weekend's three-mile regatta is the first official
event on the men's crew schedule, one that will test the Car
dinal's depth and leadership. The men's team will not re
turn Jamie Schroeder, due to his participation in the
Olympic trials. Last season, Schroeder was named to the
All-Pacific 10 Conference team.
"Each year presents new and unique challenges," said
Stanford men's varsity coach Craig Amerkhanian. "With
[Schroeder] taking the year off to train for the U.S.
Olympic Team, new personalities and attitudes will
emerge. This is extremely exciting."
The team is led by seniors Matt Altman, Tully Mc-
Gowan, Shane Anderson and junior Zach Cooper, who
"know where they would like this team to finish and will do
what is necessary to accomplish this," according to
Amerkhanian.
The men's varsity eight finished fourth in last spring's
Pac-10 championships.
"As a team we see this race [on Saturday] as another
piece of our training leading up to our spring season," Alt
man said. "Also, we welcome all Stanford staff and students
to visit and enjoy our new boathouse and watch us row."
On Saturday, the men will compete against Sacramento
State and Arizona State. They will race again in the Head of
the American race on Oct. 25 in Rancho Cordova, Calif.
The Pac-10 season does not begin until March 20 when
the Cardinal will face Santa Clara, Sacramento State, and
the University of Southern California.
After finishing last year with a Pac-10 Championship and
a third place finish at the NCAA championships, the
Women's Varsity Eight looks to balance experience with
young talent. Captained by true senior Melissa Haury and
fifth-year senior, Second Team Ail-American coxswain
Wendy Hobeler, the woman's varsity team returns five se
niors.
2003 Second Team All-American Missy Fiesler will re
turn for her junior season in the stroke seat for the
women's eight team. Additionally, last year's Pac-10
Women's Newcomer of the Year, sophomore Abby
Loughrey, will return as the seat seven rower.
Despite the loss of would-be junior Samantha McGee to
the Olympic trials and First Team All-American Sabrina
Kolker to graduation, the team has a group of freshmen
who figure to make an impact from the start.
