# Hit and miss for women's tennis
## Four women fall in preliminaries; three head to main draw 
### MIA R. LEE 
It's a case of good news,
bad news for the Stanford
women's tennis team in its first
event of the year.
The bad news? All four of its
players attempting to qualify
for the main draw of the Riv
iera / ITA All-American
Championships lost.
The good news? Three more
Cardinal players already had
automatic spots in the main
draw, which begins today.
Freshmen Anne Yelsey and
Teresa Logar, sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates, and senior
Emilia Anderson all failed to
earn spots in the 32-woman field
at the Riviera Country Club in
Pacific Palisades.
Yelsey, who was seeded
16th in the prequalifying
bracket, lost an intense
three-set match to sopho
more Lisa Gordon of UCLA
3-6, 6-4, 3-6.
Anda Perianu, a junior at
Oklahoma, inflicted a punish
ing first-round loss on Ander
son 6-0, 6-1. Perianu, ranked
40th in the country, is seeded
13th at the event.
Logar posted a 6-3, 6-2 win

over Gitte Ostermann of Ne
braska in the first round of
qualifying on Tuesday. Oster
mann, a junior, played the No. 1
position for the Cornhuskers in
the 2001-02 season.
The tables turned later in
the day for Logar, when sec
ond-seeded Diane Hollands
clinched a swift 6-0, 6-3 victo
ry from her. Hollands, a junior
at Arizona, is currently
ranked 24th.
Anderson, who won her
first consolation match by
overpowering Florida State's
Anca Dumitrescu, 6-2,6-4, fell
in her second match, Michelle
DaCosta 6-2, 6-3.
And while Tweedie-Yates
had the most success among the
four Cardinal players in qualify
ing, she still was unable to cap
ture one of the eight available
spots in the main draw.
She defeated Alexis Martire
of Harvard in the first qualifying
round, 6-2, 7-5, and then beat
top-seeded Claire Carter of
Washington, 6-0, 6-4, before
being eliminated by Jennifer
Magley of Florida, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
There is hope, however,
for the Cardinal. Senior Lau
ren Barnikow, junior Erin
Burdette and sophomore
Alice Barnes were given
berths into the main draw due
to their previous success in
collegiate play.
All three players will be in
action beginning today.
