# Open beds, empty rooms remain in dorms
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
This quarter, more vacancies
than usual have opened up in un
dergraduate housing, leaving some
students wondering why extra beds
are available on campus in spite of
the housing crunch.
When freshman Troy Steinmetz
moved into his dorm room in Twain
several weeks ago, his roommate
showed up for the first day of orien
tation activities and then moved out
shortly after. Steinmetz was told to
wait a few days until the reassign
ment process before he settled into
his room. The University did not as
sign Steinmetz another roommate,
and he currently lives alone in a
double and does not expect to have
a roommate until winter quarter.
"At this point it would be a little
strange for someone random to
move in, but I understand that the
situation is out of my control,"
Steinmetz said. "I definitely cannot
complain about having the extra
space, though."
Steinmetz is not the only Twain
resident without a roommate. In
fact, Twain presently has 12 vacan
cies. Some of the rooms are entirely
vacant, but several residents have
rooms to themselves, at least for fall
quarter.

According to Todd Benson, the
director of housing assignment ser
vices, the University has been antic
ipating the higher number of vacan
cies for the past 18 months.
"Undergraduate enrollment and
demand for on-campus housing is
always highest during winter quar
ter," Benson said. "This is because

fewer students go overseas or enroll
in off-campus programs in winter
than in any other quarter."
Rodger Whitney, the executive
director of student housing, added
that because of the difference in en
rollment during the fall and winter
quarters, the University must plan
ahead in order to meet its guaran
tee to students that they will have
housing when they return to cam
pus. For this reason, the
"uprates" the conversion of sin
gles to doubles or doubles to
triples were necessary, even

though some of the open spots were
not immediately filled.
"It was important to do the up
rates before the year started be
cause we didn't want to have to con
vert singles to doubles and so on
during the middle of the year be
cause of the inconvenience this
would cause to the students living in
those spaces," Benson said.
In addition, the University want
ed to ensure that students would
not be forced to live in off-campus
apartments such as Oak Creek
Apartments and Sharon Green

Apartments when they returned in
the winter, Whitney said.
The demand for on-campus
housing fluctuates from year to
year, and it is often difficult for
Stanford to predict how many stu
dents will choose to live in Univer
sity housing. Several factors influ
ence the number of students living
on campus, Benson said, including
enrollment in off-campus programs
and the state of the off-campus
housing market.

Despite a surplus of open beds on campus, these unlucky students still share a dreaded Lag double in Naranja.
The opening of the Stanford in
Australia program this fall is anoth
er reason why more students are
currently off-campus than in previ
ous fall quarters. The program en
rolls 47 students in the fall but does
not have winter enrollment, which
means that while the University has
extra vacancies now, students re
turning from Australia and other
overseas studies programs will fill
them in the winter.
