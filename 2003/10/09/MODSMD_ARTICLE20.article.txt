# Psych One Initiative revamps class
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Students in James Gross's Introduction to
Psychology class had hands-on experience with
the human brain this week â€”literally. They got
to go beyond the biological mechanisms of the
brain and actually touched and handled a real
human brain.
That opportunity, a first for the Psych One
class, was just one result of this year's Psych
One Initiative, a major reworking of the intro
ductory course.
Brain-handling aside, students in the new
Psych One will also enjoy a standardized syl
labus across quarters, more experienced teach
ing assistants and smaller sections.
"We show students the corpus collosum, and
then a clip of a real person who has a severed
one," said Jazmin Quill, the assistant director of
the initiative. "We love this stuff, and we want
to share it."
Freshmen entering Psych One this year will
not have to compete for a spot in Prof. Phil Zim
bardo's popular lecture. The famed professor
has retired from teaching the introductory

course in psychology, though he was integral in
helping design the revamped course.
Instead, students looking for an introduction
to psychology will get what psychology profes
sors hope is the best of their field culled into a
single course.
"I'm really excited, I've taught it for six or
seven years," said Gross, the director of the ini
tiative. "It was a good course and is now a bet
ter course."
The new class is getting positive reviews
from teaching assistants who have worked with
the course for many years.
"I've had more contact from students in this
first two weeks than I can recall having had in
entire quarters, in previous years," said Kelly
McGonigal, a fifth-year graduate student who
has worked with the class twice before. "I think
[the process of redesigning] has led to tangible
benefits for students and has translated into a
really great vibe."
Gross pointed out that the course used to
have very divergent goals and cover different
topics depending on who was teaching it.
"Phil had his own magic that he worked, and
others had their own versions of teaching Psych

One," he said.
In the past, teaching assistants were selected
at the last minute in a slightly disorganized man
ner. There was no defined way to connect sec
tions to the rest of the class, and technology was
not evenly incorporated throughout the course.
Gross set out to revamp the course with the
help of a grant from the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education. Similar funds have
been used to decrease lecture sizes for introduc
tory math courses and improve introductory
economics classes.
"Psych One should be part of the general ed
ucation experience of everybody at Stanford,"
Gross said.
Gross applied the funds towards choosing
better teaching assistants and training them
more. The new teaching assistants, all graduate
students, will work the whole year in Psych One,
building up expertise in the course.
Gross is developing a video library to
demonstrate different psychological concepts.
He shrank sections from 25 people to 14 people,
at most.
