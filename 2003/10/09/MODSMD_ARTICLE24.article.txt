# Bob Graham ends presidential campaign
## 
### MARCUS MROWKA U-WIRE (DC BUREAU 
(U-WIRE) Florida Senator
Bob Graham announced he would
end his troubled campaign for the
Presidency Monday on "Larry King
Live", making him the first among
the 10 Democrats to drop out.
"I made the judgment I cannot be
elected President of the United
States," Graham told King. "I am
very proud of what we have been able
to accomplish during this campaign
and I am gratified by the number of
people across the country who be
lieved in us."
Graham cited a late start after
heart surgery and his obligations in
the Senate as causes for his dismal
campaign figures. According to a re
cent New York Times/CBS News
Poll, only three percent of those sur
veyed indicated Graham was their
choice to be the Democratic nominee.
Fundraising problems were also a
problem for Graham. He reportedly

raised under $2 million in the third
quarter, compared to Howard
Dean's $12.5 million.
Graham, 66, is former chairman of
the Senate intelligence committee
and is serving his third term in the
Senate which ends in January of 2005.
He also served in the Florida legisla
ture and two terms as Governor of
Florida before his Senate bid in 1986.
Graham has not yet made a decision
on whether he will seek reelection for
his Senate seat.
"I commend [Graham] for being a
strong advocate for the Democratic
Party not only as a presidential candi
date, but also during his decades of pub
lic service to the people of Florida," said
Terry McAuliffe, Democratic National
Committee Chairman, in a recent press
release on Graham's decision.
"I will miss seeing Bob Graham on
the campaign trail," said Howard
Dean, former Governor of Vermont
and Democratic presidential con
tender. "He was an honorable oppo
nent who treated his fellow aspirants

for the Democratic nomination with
respect."
Graham left the possibility of ac
cepting the party's vice presidency
open. Many political analysts have
said that the Graham campaign had
been eyeing the vice-presidency all
along.
"I am prepared to do whatever I
can to contribute to a Democratic vic
tory next November and the leading
of this nation to a new and better
track," Graham said.
"I think the chance of Graham
being selected for the vice-presidential
spot is less likely now than before he
ran," said Jon Gould, Assistant Direc
tor of the Administration of Justice at
George Mason University. "Things
like the coverage of his daily notebook
exposed his quirkiness and the fact
that he couldn't get much support in
the primary could make people see
him as a less viable candidate."
The remaining nine Democrats
will take part in a debate Thursday on
CNN.
