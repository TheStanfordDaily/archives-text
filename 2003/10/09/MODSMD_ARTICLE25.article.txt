# Alcohol tax may prevent underage drinking

### AMBER DILLEY DAILY LOBO 
(U-WIRE) ALBUQUERQUE,
N.M. The next time beer lovers
purchase their favorite brew, they
may be paying a little more, if one
nonprofit organization has its way.
The National Academy of Sci
ences recently proposed an increase
in excise tax on alcohol, more specif
ically beer, as a way to curb underage
drinking. In the report, released last
week, raising the cost of beer and al
coholic products will effectively re
duce alcohol consumption by minors.
Advertising paid for by revenue gen
erated by the tax could also reduce
underage alcohol consumption.
Research conducted by the acade
my has found that underage drinking
costs taxpayers $53 billion a year in
court costs. Alcohol-related traffic
accidents caused by minors also cost
$l9 billion a year, prompting the
academy to call for the increased tax.
The proposal, still in its planning
stages, is slated to go before legisla
tion next year and if passed could
take effect as early as 2005.
The report does not state how
much the proposed tax increase is.

According to its Web site, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences is a pri
vate, nonprofit society of scholars en
gaged in scientific and engineering
research, dedicated to the further
ance of science and technology for
the public's welfare.
The report also blames the media
industry for glorifying alcohol to mi
nors and calls for the creation of an
impartial foundation funded by the
country's alcohol industry to monitor
what the report calls an "absurd in
crease in underage drinking."
The federal excise tax on beer is cur
rently 33 cents per six-pack, accord
ing to the Beer Institute's web site.
The Beer Institute is the national
trade association for the malt bever
age industry.
There has been a nationwide re
sponse from nonprofit organiza
tions such as Mothers Against
Drunk Driving to the report and its
proposed steps to end underage
drinking, according to the acade
my's Web site.
"MADD supports the tax and
feels that it is a means for recovering
the cost to society caused by the mis
use of alcohol," said Terry Huertaz,
MADD New Mexico executive di

rector. "It's also a way to support al
cohol prevention programs."
Linda Atkinson, director of Albu
querque, N.M.'s DWI Resource
Center said she agreed the proposal
is a good idea.
"We think it is something that se
riously needs to be considered,"
Atkinson said. "The tax increase in
1991 cut underage drinking by 20
percent but we knew it was not raised
enough and the issue needed to be re
visited."
Federal alcohol taxes were last
raised in 1991 when the excise tax
was doubled, resulting in a 9 percent
drop in beer sales, according to a
study conducted by the DWI Re
source Center.
Many local business owners said
they support the tax and don't feel it
will interfere with their business
should the proposal be carried into
legislation and passed into law.
Tony Torte, manager of Kelly's
Brewery, said the increase in alcohol
tax, should it happen, shouldn't ef
fect business too much.
"It could possibly hurt business in
a very small way, but if it will deter
teenagers from drinking, then it's
definitely a good thing," Torte said.
