# Berkeley protestors face hearing
## 
### SHUANA SWEENY DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) Three prominent anti-war organizers -
among 119 University of California at Berkeley students
arrested during protests on the Berkeley campus last
March - will face hearings next week on possible Berke
ley code violations.
Michael Smith, Rachel Odes and Snehal Shingavi, all
active members of the Berkeley Stop the War Coalition,
were charged in May with four breaches of Berkeley's
Student Code of Conduct.
All three students declined to comment on the
charges.
Charges include unauthorized entry, obstruction and
disruption of business, disturbance of the peace and fail
ure to comply with university or public officials, accord
ing to a May 1 letter sent to one of the students from

Berkeley Student Judicial Affairs.
Berkeley officials declined to comment on any more
of the details of the case because of student privacy laws.
But the three students said they were being unfairly
singled out during what was an overwhelmingly peaceful
day of civil disobedience following the first night of U.S.
attacks on Iraq.
The district attorney dropped all charges against the
119 students arrested. Subsequently, Berkeley officials
sent a letter of warning to those students, Smith said.
"This is clearly designed to intimidate organizers on
campus and chill protest and free speech," Smith said.
The three students are trying to push back the hearing
date, set for Oct. 14, saying it does not give them ade
quate time to prepare their defense.
"We just think that two weeks is impossible to get
people scheduled there so that we can adequately be
there to defend ourselves," Shingavi said.
