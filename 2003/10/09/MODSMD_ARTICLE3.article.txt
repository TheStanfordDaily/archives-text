# IT'S A FULL MOON TONIGHT

### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
A "kiss workshop" describing different
ways of smooching. A dorm viewing of
"Sex and the City." A keg of root beer to
make ice cream floats. These are all sug
gestions e-mailed to dorm PHEs in prepa
ration for Full Moon on the Quad tonight,
in an attempt by the University to discour
age freshmen from pre-partying before
this year's event, which is supposed to be
alcohol-free.
There was a time when Full Moon on
the Quad was a free-for-all kissfest, in
which seniors and freshmen (and really,
everyone in between) united at midnight
under the first full moon of the year to
share a kiss or several.

But in recent years, as students and ad
ministrators have become more conscious
of the risks associated with what used to be
considered harmless fun, safety and health
issues have figured much more promi
nently in the event's planning.
This year, student groups and adminis
trators are adding an extra push to their ef
forts to keep Full Moon safe, by spending
an extra $5OO on entertainment program
ming an effort to make the event more
than just a kissing orgy. Student rock band
Midget Mosaic will perform, along with
Everyday People and the Stanford Band.
Plus, a DJ and KZSU have been hired.
"This is an opportunity for students to
gather in a monitored and lively environ
ment," Himinkool said.
According to Nanci Howe, assistant

dean of students and director of student
activities, the University is trying to pre
vent the alcohol-related hospitalizations
and reports of unwanted sexual advances
that took place last year.
"We want people to have a good time,
but do it safely," Howe said.
Laura Wilson, director of public safety,
said counselors at the Vaden Health Cen
ter told her last year that they had seen a
number of cases involving sexual assault,
battery and students who "participated in
sexual intercourse while under the influ
ence of alcohol and wished that they had
not."
The Office of Student Activities,
ASSU and senior class presidents are tak
ing a preventative, educational approach
to combatting these problems, by working

with RAs, RFs, PHEs and Vaden repre
sentatives to "promote responsible behav
ior before and at the event," according to
Mary Himinkool, a senior class president.
Representatives from each of those
groups are communicating with students
about drinking and safety issues,
Himinkool said.
. "Students are also encouraged to rec
ognize their comfort boundaries and re
main within these lines," she added.
In addition to these preventive mea
sures, there will three deputy officers
and six security officers in order to en
sure the safety of the 3,000 students that
are expected to attend the event. Ac
cording to Himinkool, $2,000 is being
