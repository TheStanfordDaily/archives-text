# SCN brings Jason Mraz to campus in November
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Solo artist Jason Mraz, whose
first single, "The Remedy," has re
ceived nationwide airplay, will
perform at Memorial Auditorium
on Nov. 10.
Mraz will come to campus
for the Stanford Concert Net
work's first large-venue concert
of the year.
"Over the course of the last
year, we've had a number of stu
dents come up to us and suggest
Jason as someone they'd love to
see play here," said senior Niki
Carelli, the director of the Con
cert Network. "We were lucky
enough to snag him just as he's be
ginning to blow up — in the last
six months he's gone from playing
small clubs to packing large the
aters."
Mraz will stop at Stanford be
fore playing a nearly sold-out per
formance at the Warfield in San
Francisco.
"I like the song that they play
on the radio — that's the only one
I've heard, though," said junior
Lyndsie Schmalz. "I probably
won't go to the concert, because I
usually don't have the time, and I
don't like paying."
While many have not heard of
Mraz, he has performed with well
known artists such as Bob Dylan,
Paula Cole and Jewel.
"We think that Jason is a per
fect fit for the Stanford audience
because his folk-rock singer-song
writer style is much like favorite

Stanford artists John Mayer and
Jack Johnson," Carelli said. "He's
an incredible, young, energetic,
up-and-coming artist who has a
strong college fan base."
The Stanford Concert Net
work has in previous years host
ed such musical acts as Nappy
Roots, Vertical Horizon and
Jack Johnson. The Concert Net
work is also responsible for
booking performances for Big
Game.
"I didn't know the Concert
Network actually had people
come who were on the radio and
stuff," said Schmalz. "I remember
everyone going to see Jack John
son, but I had never heard of him
before."
The two dorms with the high
est attendance at the Mraz con
cert will win reserved front-and
center seats, as well as a special
prize.
"He puts on a fantastic live
show, which is definitely a key
consideration for us," Carelli said.
"And although the show only be
came official this week, rumors
have been flying and our staff has
already heard a tremendous
amount of excited buzz from stu
dents."
Students can purchase tickets
for $l7 from their RAs until Oct.
12. On Oct. 13, tickets will go on
sale to the public in White Plaza.
Ticket sales will continue daily
from noon to 1 p.m. and will be
available in the Stanford Ticket
Office. Tickets are $23 for the
general public.
