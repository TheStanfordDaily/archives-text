## Vinni's Intro Sem on kissing 
### 
The time of year has come
for our freshmen to take their
rightful place as fellow Stanford
students by dragging their thor
oughly intoxicated asses onto
the Quad to be molested and vi
olated in a tradition known as
Full Moon on thfe Quad — or,
more appropriately, Full Mono
on the Quad. Frosh arrive with
$40,000 of tuition debts. They
leave with 40,000 diseases.
But it's fun, right? Group orgies
have always existed in academic so
cieties. The Greeks did it, the Ro
mans did it and Europeans—in

general
do it, so why
shouldn't
we? Aside
from the
various
strains of as
sorted ail
ments per
petuated by
group or
gies, die ac
tivity is rela
tively harm-

less. So let's go over how to get the
most bang for your buck, if you
know what I mean.
First off, Full Moon on the
Quad isn't really an orgy so much
as an immense group make-out
session. What better time is there
to go over how to kiss?
Most of you, I'm sure, al
ready know how this goes —
but it never hurts to see if
you've been wrong this entire
time. The key is to relax. Like
all things sexual, your kissing
should have a certain groove, a
certain rhythm to it. To be able
to get into that groove you bet
ter have clean teeth, fresh
breath and, most importantly,
moist lips.
No one wants to kiss sandpa
per lips, let me tell you. Girls and
many gays are usually safe due to
the various cosmetics that keep
them ready to kiss at the drop of
a condom, but most straight guys
walk around with lips that could
scratch the paint of my car. Buy
some chap stick, and, for the love
of God, use it.
So you're on the quad with
clean teeth, fresh breath and
moist lips ready to stick your
tongue down every human being
within reach... but did you re
member your bottle of Listerine?
This is key. At this point there
might very well be enough alco
hol in your system to power a
small country and kill an entire le
gion of bacteria but do you really
want to wake up with mono for
the next few weeks?
I didn't think so.
Bring some kind of disinfec
tant but don't say Vinni made you
do it when the cop doesn't buy
your story that the lx)ttle of vodka
was for purely medical purposes.
At this point, your sobriety
and the sobriety of the people
around you will determine the
best course of action to take, so
I'll just address how to kiss in
general and let you apply it to
tonight's event. Look into his
eyes. If it's special, there should
be a glint of awe, of wonder
when he looks back at you. If it's
just about making out, it won't
be there, but if the person really
cares for you you'll be able to see
it. Promise.
Lean in and let nature take
it's course. Don't initially jut
your tongue into the person's
mouth. TTiat's not sexy and has
absolutely no style or appeal to
it. A better course of action is to
kiss both his lips together and
then slowly move on to kissing
each lip individually and then, if
you get the OK, gently slip your
tongue in and meet his own. Un
less you're seconds away from
getting into bed, go slow. It
makes it so much more fun and
it's your only shot at being even
slightly romantic.
One of the reasons Full
Moon on the Quad is such an in
teresting event is that it takes
kissing off its righteous, yet
rightful, pedestal of expressing
deep, true affection and recog
nizes that sex, and kissing along
with it, is also adventurous. So
have fun tonight, remember to
bring your Listerine bottle and,
unless you want a very annoyed
gay sex columnist after you, stay
the hell away from my boy.
