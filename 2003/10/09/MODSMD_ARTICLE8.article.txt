# Under the midnight moon
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Tonight is Stanford's largest annual festival of spit swap
ping and nudity: Full Moon on the Quad. An age-old initi
ation ritual as important as fountain hopping and the frosh
scavenger hunt, Full Moon promises to bring out more
than just the werewolves.
If this year resembles previous ones, Stanford students
of all ages with, ahem, a few non-Stanford students as
well will be out and about in the quad at midnight.
They'll come to smooch, streak and observe the spectacle.
But prospective Full Mooners might want to know that
making out with dozens of strangers does carry some
health risks.
Dr. Tom Nash, an infectious disease expert at New
York Presbyterian Hospital cited some of the possible dis
eases that can be picked up through kissing. Make-out mal
adies include herpes complex, mononucleosis, rhinovirus,
hepatitis B and possibly hepatitis C, according to Nash.
Also called fever blisters or cold sores, labial herpes is a
virus that remains lodged in the spinal cord and can cause
recurring outbreaks throughout life. Herpes sores are situ
ated on the face or in the mouth and often cause pain, burn
ing or itching before bursting and crusting over.
Mononucleosis, or mono, causes a painful sore throat,
swollen lymph nodes, low-grade fever, nausea and extreme
fatigue. It's often called the "kissing disease."
Rhinovirus, or the common cold, can also be spread at
Full Moon.
Hepatitis B is a virus transmitted through exposure to
blood or bodily secretions including saliva. It can lead to
chronic hepatitis B infection and eventually liver failure or
liver cancer. Most Stanford students have been immunized
for hepatitis B.
Nash said that the chance of contracting hepatitis C
through kissing was unlikely, though perhaps possible.
Transmitted through the blood, hepatitis C can lead to se
vere liver problems and chronic infection.
Students who lived in Freshman Sophomore College
last year received a three-part message from their PHE de
tailing the health risks of Full Moon. But lurid descriptions
of mono and herpes didn't deter FroSoCo resident
Chethena Kulkami from heading over to the quad to check
out the spectacle.
Kulkami, now a sophomore, opted not to participate in
the festivities, however.
"As we were biking over there, someone told me they
knew this guy in their I-Hum section who had mono and
was going anyway because he thought it was a big deal to go
your freshman year," she said. "I was pretty grossed out!"
Nick Wilhelm, who attended Full Moon two years
ago, found the event more of a fright of passage than a
rite of passage.
"I had a friend who got a really bad case of mono in high
school and it did cross my mind that that was one of the
risks," he said. "It sort of made me a little nervous."
Events at the quad that night made Wilhelm even more
nervous.
"The first girl who tried to kiss me was bigger and taller
than I was," he said. "She came on pretty strong. It kind of
scared me."
Another equally frightening episode occurred later in
the evening.
"There was this one guy who went around groping
girls," Wilhelm said. "I don't know if he was a Stanford stu
dent or what. He grabbed this one girl's butt while her
boyfriend was standing right there. The boyfriend got pret
ty annoyed and he started fighting with the groper."
Hopefully the infamous serial groper of the past few
weeks won't make a guest appearance tonight.
FroSoCo frosh Nate Rooks said he was "definitely
scared of all the things you can catch."
"It sounds pretty sketchy," Rooks said. "I'm pretty sure
I'm going to go but I'm undecided. I think I'm going to pull
a plastic glove over my face," Rooks joked. "Or maybe I'll
find a cool girl here and kiss her there. That would proba
bly be a better idea."
Peer Health Educator Sara Weekly advises worried stu
dents to get a flu shot and reminds them that they can al
ways "taper their depth of kiss accordingly a.k.a. mouth
closed, only on the cheek, etc."
Weekly had more creative advice for Full Mooners:
"If they wanted to be really inventive," she said, "they
could use a dental dam there's grape flavor at the
SHPRC or saran wrap to cover their mouths. Just re
member what side was used before," Weekly cautioned.
She pointed out that boozing it up before the germ-fest
wouldn't help ward off gross diseases.
"Alcohol in the form of beer or liquor is not a good dis
infectant," she warned.
Weekly didn't mention tongue and hp rings, but you
should be on the lookout anyway. They can tear up your
mouth pretty badly.
