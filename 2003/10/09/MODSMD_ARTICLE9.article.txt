# Kisser's dilemma: Game theory and Full Moon
## 
### ROBBIE YAN 
While many students are using mouth
wash, chewing gum or taking a shot of tequi
la in preparation for Full Moon, they might
not realize the technical aspects of this pres
tigious Stanford tradition.
There are three types of people in the
world: People who go to Full Moon and par
ticipate, those who attend but don't partici
pate and those who don't attend at all. The
third category is populated primarily by
computer geeks who sit in front of their com
puter screens all day long and will probably
be downloading "Baywatch" tonight while
everyone else is having fun. We hope that
this group will be excited by this article and
will perhaps reconsider. But our central
question is why there are people who attend
the event but do not participate.
Let us model the behavior of two students
that randomly meet each other on the Quad

during "Full Moon." Without loss of gener
ality, call them Alice and Bob. The two must
independently make one of two choices
without knowing the other party's decision
beforehand: to kiss or not to kiss.
From Alice's perspective, if she decides
to kiss, one of two things could happen: One,
Bob decides to kiss as well. In this scenario,
both of them derive 1,000 points from this
blissful experience (of course, the point
value might vary from person to person de
pending on previous experience and how the
kiss is conducted, but for the sake of simplic
ity, let's say a fixed value, 1,000 points). Two,
Bob decides not to kiss. In this case, Alice
loses 1,000 points due to feelings of rejection
and a loss of self-confidence; Bob, on the
other hand, derives 2,000 points from this in
cident because his self-esteem is boosted.
Now, consider the case when Alice decides
not to kiss: One of two things could happen
as well. If Bob does decide to kiss, this see

nario is symmetric to the one we just dis
cussed: Bob loses 1,000 points for loss of con
fidence while Alice gains 2,000 points for
boost in self-esteem. If Bob decides not to
kiss, however, nothing happens. The two
people just say hi and then leave each other.
Neither party gains or loses any points.
The payoff matrix is drawn as follows.
Readers familiar with game theory might re
alize that this model is similar to the famous
"prisoner's dilemma."
Let's perform an analysis from Alice's
perspective. In the case when Bob decides to
kiss, if she decides to kiss, she gains 1,000
points; if she decides not to kiss, she gains
2,000 points. So in this case, she should re
frain from kissing. In the case when Bob de
cides not to kiss, if she decides to kiss, she
loses 1,000 points; if she decides not to kiss,
she doesn't gain or lose anything. She should
not, then, kiss in this case, either. Hence, ei

ther way, the optimal decision for Alice
would be to refrain from kissing.
The same analysis goes for Bob. Whatev
er Alice decides, Bob will avoid kissing. Our
game theoretic analysis concludes, then, that
neither of them would decide to share a
Stanford moment tonight. It's our belief that
the above analysis provides the actual rea
son why people don't kiss each other when
the tradition is in place and the atmosphere
is inviting.
While readers might be disenchanted
with the upsetting truth-revealing reason
stated above, they must realize that the
above analysis is based on one key assump
tion: The two parties must make their deci
sions independently. Hence, to ensure that
you can kiss tonight, go take the initiative
and start discussing this game theoretic anal
ysis with someone you are interested in be
fore he or she makes up her mind!
