We're good at fitting people to jobs
%
And jobs to people.
It wouldn't be clear to every firm that a man with
an M.F. A. in poetry was the right choice to head an
automated block trading unit. Or that a designer
of solar-powered race cars was the right woman to
help launch a new venture in computational chem
istry. But after we talked to them, it was clear to us.
The D. E. Shaw group is an investment and technol
ogy development firm. Since 1988 we've grown into
a number of closely related entities with approxi
mately US $5 billion in aggregate capital by hiring
smart people from a wide range of backgrounds and
letting them implement—and manage —what they
invent. A robotics guru. A nationally ranked black
jack player. An operatic mezzo-soprano. And a lot
of people who are just exceptionally strong in CS,
EE, math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative
analysis, software development, information tech
nology, computer architecture, business devel
opment, computational chemistry, finance, and
accounting. We're looking for creative but prag
matic people: articulate, curious, and driven. Our
working environment is intense but surprisingly
casual. We provide unusual opportunities for
growth. And we compensate extraordinary people
extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will host an information
session on Thursday, October 30 at 6:00 PM in the
Gates Building, Room 104. On-campus interviews
will take place October 31. To apply for an inter
view, log on to http://cardinalrecruiting.stanford.
edu/intent2oo3/. If this isn't possible, please send
a resume and cover letter stating your GPA and
standardized test scores, broken down by section
where applicable, to oncampus@deshaw.com. All
applications must be received by October 12.
Members of the D. E. Shaw group do not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital
status, disability, or any other protected class.
