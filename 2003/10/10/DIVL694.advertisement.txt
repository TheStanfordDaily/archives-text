Some Gifts Just
Do More Than Others.
Think about it. Most gifts are pretty unimaginative. A toaster makes toast. A blender just blends. And
there are some gifts that no one knows what they're supposed to do.
But give Savings Bonds, and you'll be giving the gift of future possibilities—from a down payment
on a car to help with college tuition. With eight denominations to choose from, there's a size for every
occasion. You can select the popular Series EE Bond or the inflation-protected I Bond. They're
available through most banks, where you work, or automatically through the new Savings Bonds
