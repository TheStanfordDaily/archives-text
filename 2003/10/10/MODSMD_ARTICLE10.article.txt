# Stanford to help research Internet
## $7.5 mil grant seeks to determine optimal way to orchestrate Internet 
### MELISSA CHEE 
Stanford is one of eight organiza
tions that recently received $7.5 mil
lion from the National Science
Foundation to design a brand-new
Internet, in an attempt to create a
new infrastructure to meet ever-in
creasing demands on the global net
work.
"The Internet has been far more
successful then anybody ever
dreamed of or ever anticipated,"
said Kevin McKeown, associate pro
fessor of electrical engineering and
computer science. "It was never en
visioned to be used by hundreds of
millions of people."
Some specialists theorize that if
everyone had high-speed Internet
connections, the pressure would
cause the system to crumble. As
technology becomes more inter
twined with daily life, mapy find that
possibility alarming.
"There's an open debate," McK
eown said. "This research is
premised on the question of, 'lf to
morrow everyone had a very high
speed connection to the core of the
Internet, would the Internet be able
to scale for that kind of capacity?'
"Most of us who work in this
field of research feel that the whole
thing would probably fall apart," he
added.
Rui Zhang-Shen, a doctoral can
didate in electrical engineering,
agreed.
"The Internet was not designed
to work in such high capacity and
under the current scenarios," he
said. "As demand keeps increasing
and new applications emerging, the
current technologies will have a
harder and harder time keeping
up."
The National Science Founda
tion, which says the topic is crucial, is
funding the research.
Stanford and the seven other or
ganizations will combine forces to
study how they would design the In
ternet from scratch today, empow

ered with the knowledge of how the
Internet has evolved.
The institutions are Carnegie
Mellon University, Rice University,
UC-Berkeley, Fraser Research, In
ternet 2, Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center and ATT Research.
"We are not constrained at all by
the current infrastructure," Zhang-
Shen said. "We are to think, 'lf we
were to start from scratch and re

build the Internet, what would we
do?' This freedom is extremely ex
citing."
McKeown is heading up Stan
ford's research, along with Zhang-
Shen and Greg Watson, a senior re
search engineer.
Their work will be based around
ideas of how to build the backbone
architecture of the Internet to create
a secure, reliable network.
