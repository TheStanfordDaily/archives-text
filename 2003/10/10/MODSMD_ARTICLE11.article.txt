# Berkeley defends admit policies
## 
### KIM-MAI CULTER JANINE PLISKA DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) - An article pub
lished in the Los Angeles Times Sat
urday put the University of Califor
nia-Berkeley's admissions policy
under fire after a confidential report
revealed that the campus accepted
nearly 400 students with SAT I
scores less than 1,000 for the fall
2002 semester.
The article reported that 381 stu
dents scoring less than 1,000 on the
SAT I were accepted while 641 ap
plicants with near perfect scores
were turned away. The accepted stu
dents made up about 5 percent of the
entering class.
Commissioned by the UC Board
of Regents Chairman John Moores,
the report attacks UC's recent com
prehensive review policy, which
takes a holistic look at applicants
using dozens of factors including
personal background.
It found that UC Berkeley's ad
missions "might not be compatible
with (the school's) goal of maintain
ing academic excellence," and urged
further study of admissions at all un
dergraduate campuses.
The newspaper also reported that
a look at statistics on these admitted
students showed they had on aver
age lower GPAs and less semesters
of honors and AP courses than the

high-scoring applicants who were
turned away.
UC Berkeley admissions officials
defended the university's policies,
criticizing the study for overempha
sizing SAT I scores. In recent years,
former UC President Richard
Atkinson has pushed to devalue the
SAT I in admissions.
The study did not heavily analyze
GPA or other predictors of academ
ic performance in college.
"It's very much focused on factor
and it's a skewed perspective," said
Student Regent Matt Murray.
"Even Richard Atkinson and the na
tion agreed that the SAT I has sig
nificant flaws."
The hundreds of low-scoring stu
dents were accepted on other factors
â€”such as exceptional personal tal
ent or otherwise strong academic
performance, said Richard Black,
assistant vice chancellor of admis
sions and enrollment.
Although the report did not ac
count for race, ethnicity or socioeco
nomic status, a "substantial portion"
of those admitted were underrepre
sented students from the state's low
est performing schools, Black told
the Times.
Only 33 of the 381 students were
athletes, Black said.
"The first thing is that we don't
believe that any single score or sin
gle test is a measure of academic
ability," Black said. "That's the
whole premise of comprehensive re

view. That's why we look at dozens
of academic indicators in evaluating
each student."
"Taking into account a handful of
factors puts UC Berkeley's admis
sions policies in line with system
wide guidelines, which require the
campus to bring together a student
body with high academic achieve
ment, personal talent and a broad di
versity in backgrounds," said UC
Berkeley professor David Stern,
who chairs a faculty admissions com
mittee.
Before using comprehensive re
view, the campus accepted nearly
the same percentage of students
with low SAT I numbers 369 stu
dents scoring under 1000 in 1997,
Black said.
Throughout this period, UC
Berkeley's admissions process has
undergone small revisions, never re
maining exactly the same from year
to year.
Put in place at UC Berkeley after
the affirmative action ban, compre
hensive review has suffered heavy
criticism as a backdoor to pump up
numbers of underrepresented mi
nority students.
Before, UC Berkeley accepted
more than half of its admits solely on
academic factors.
UC Regent Ward Connerly blast
ed the policy and said to the Times
that the report was "damning" evi
dence that race remained an unstat
ed factor in admissions.
