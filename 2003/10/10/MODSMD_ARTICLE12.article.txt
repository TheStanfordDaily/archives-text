## Gym facilities should be improved 
### 
Stanford is renowned across the coun
try for its status as an athletic power
house. The Cardinal lays claim to 374
individual NCAA championships
the most in the nation and nine consecu
tive Sears Cups. In light of these achieve
ments, the sorry state of
weight-lifting and exer
cise facilities on-campus
is perplexing. We be
lieve the University
should increase the ath
letic resources available
to its student population
by expanding upon its
selection of equipment
and making the existing
centers more accessible
to all students.
A total of three
weight-lifting facilities
are available for student
use at Stanford: Arrillaga
Family Sports Center, the
most elaborate and com
plete of the three; Roble
Gym; and Tresidder Fit
ness Center. Although
the University advertises

varsity athletes. Under no circumstances
not even during public-access hours are
non-athletes permitted to use this equip
ment, a regulation that is inequitable and un
fair. Meanwhile, comparable general-use
machines generate 10- to 15-minute-long

waits.
Conditions at Tresid
der and Roble are not
much better. Although
Tresidder is open up to 17
hours per day, the facili
ty's equipment is outdat
ed and rundown. Tresid
der offers only a limited
selection of free weights,
and many of its machines
are obsolete. Roble's se
lection of free weights is
incomplete and the room
in which the facility is
housed is restrictively
small.
Between the three
facilities, there are only
four treadmills, and the
elliptical machines — a
favorite among exercis
ers — have yet to appear

Arrillaga as a world-class facility, access to the
gym and the entirety of its equipment as a non
varsity athlete is restricted.
During weekdays, Arrillaga does not open
until 11 a.m. to students. At 2 p.m., the facili
ty closes for varsity athletic training. Stu
dents must then wait until 5:30 p.m. to regain
access to the facility.
While access to Rob\e and Tresidder is less
restricted, more students should be able to
use all of Stanford's facilities more consis
tently— or a new gym with better equip
ment for the student body at large should be
constructed.
Currently, a sizable number of the equip
ment at Arrillaga is reserved exclusively for

in reasonable numbers at the gyms. Thus,
those seeking any semblance of an aerobic
workout are then left without any conve
nient gym option.
The cost to attend Stanford is high. Stu
dents should not be forced to pay for sepa
rate gym memberships on top of tuition
costs, especially when facilities at many
other universities are more complete. We
urge the University both to increase gener
al-student access to Arrillaga and to up
grade and expand the facilities at Tresidder
and Roble. The University has one of the
most successful sports programs in the na
tion, and its facilities should reflect its ath
letic prowess.

are more complete."
