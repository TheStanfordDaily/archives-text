Tunnel journeys forbidden
because of danger

I read with concern the Daily fea
ture that chronicled the adventures
of two sophomores as they traversed
the underground steam tunnels on
campus ("Tunnel vision," Oct. 2).
Although exploring the steam tun
nels is characterized as a "tradition
with old roots," and we value our
Stanford traditions, this one is forbid
den by the University due to the sig
nificant risks it presents.
By their own description, the two
sophomores present a picture of a
dark, humid, dirty tunnel in which
hot steam is generated to supply heat
and hot water to University build
ings. The risks are obvious and real,
in particular, the risk of serious phys
ical injury. Just ask the student who
suffered severe burns last year. So,
go forth and experience Stanford
traditionsâ€”just do it safely, and
above ground.

Row editorial should
consider all the facts

In response to the recent editorial
on the Row ("Row should remain
open to all," Oct. 3) some additional
information would be helpful to clar
ify the situation.
First, in the 2001 Row Task Force
cited in its editorial. The Daily fails to
mention that a key tenet of the Task
Force report was its cap on Greek
Row housing to approximately a
quarter of all Row houses. Since this
cap has been met, there are no plans
to allocate any additional Greek
housing on the Row (a fact covered
in past Daily articles).
Second, there was some imbal

ance in the past between men and
women on the Row, but this has im
proved in recent years. The inclusion
of sororities in Row housing and the
allocation of smaller houses to our
newest housed fraternities have
helped improve this imbalance.
Third, another point often ne
glected in campus discussions about
Greek Row houses is that they were
built and largely paid for by fraterni
ty and sorority alumni. The other 75
percent of the students currently liv
ing on the Row are benefiting from
the contributions that many Greek
alumni made to originally finance
these houses. As long as a healthy
balance of different housing options
remains available on the Row, allo
cating houses to some fraternities
and sororities seems appropriate
and consistent with Stanford's long
standing commitment to Greek
chapters at Stanford.

Stanford Dining not so bad

I just read your editorial on Stan
ford Dining ("A bad taste in our
mouths," Oct. 2) and initially agreed
that the costs for the food were a bit
on the high side. However, as I sit
down now to my bowl of boxed Mac
aroni and Cheese, I realize that the
half hour of time I just invested in
this culinary masterpiece was clearly
not worth it and that $11.64 really
isn't bad at all.
Now four years into my student
loan payments and five bites of Mac
and Cheese later, I find myself long
ing for the days of Stanford Dining. I
regret that I took for granted the
aural delights of bacon frying and
the salt-and-pepper-haired chef be
hind the grill greeting me with the
sweet yells of "Omelet! Quesadilla!"
At the time, Wilbur Dining Hall

didn't seem so delectable compared
to what mom used to make. But now,
eight bites into my Mac and Cheese,
I would gladly surrender the left half
of my tongue to find someone who
would come to my house 10 times a
week and lay out a spread of endless
spaghetti, sandwich fixings, made
to-order breakfast foods, salads,
desserts and that fun automatic soda
dispenser all for $11.64 per meal.
I just ask you current students to
imagine yourselves one year after
graduation. You're living in your
own apartment with your hand-me
down pots and pans and a new set of
Wal-Mart silverware. When you're
finishing your second meal of Mac
and Cheese that day and thinking
about whether to clean that nasty
neon-orange crusted pan or just
throw it out, Stanford Dining will be
looking really good at $11.64.

Where did the crossword
puzzle go?

I've been doing the crossword
puzzle in The Daily since 1978. At
that time, it was usually in Prof. Fet
ter's physics class with a cup of coffee
from Nuts 'n' Mud. I've been reading
The Daily backwards, starting with
the crossword and then through
Sports, Entertainment, Opinions and
finally News for over two decades
now, and I miss the crossword. Please
let me know that it's just on vacation
and will be back soon.
