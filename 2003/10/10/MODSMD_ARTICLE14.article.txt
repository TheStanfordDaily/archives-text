## MY COUSIN VINNI Democrats need to inspire voters 
### 
We are now in an era of
conservatism, and it
hurts to be a liberal.
Our heads of state are
men and women who also head the
Republican Party and the conserva
tive right. No one is listening to
Democrats, and even if they were,
I'm not convinced it would help.
The cycle of power between politi
cal parties is nothing new. We ruled
during the era of Clinton, and we are
now ruled over during the era of Bush.
Throughout U.S. history, liberals and
conservatives have traded roles as po
litical power shifts. This tradeoff re
flects the near infinite amount of rea
sons voters choose the way they do.
It's imperative for the Democratic
party to learn from what's happened
over the past few years. The
Democrats simply do not have it to
gether. Proof of this lies in the fact that
in a post-Vietnam era, Democrats al
lowed President George W. Bush to
engage in war without first identifying
a clear and present danger to our na
tional security. To this day, the Bush
administration has found no conclu
sive evidence of substantial biological,
chemical or nuclear weapons in Iraq.
They have found no clear link be
tween Iraq and Osama Bin Laden.
How could Democrats let this hap
pen? Was the Vietnam War and the
resulting loss of 58,000 American fives
and $2OO billion not lesson enough
that America has no role as the mili
tary dictator of the world? Conserva
tives no doubt disagree with this

point, but Demo
cratic leaders
should not.
Where is the
passion? The gen
eration that came
before stood up to
war. Their Demo
cratic leaders even
tually stood with
them while ours
still sit comfortably

in their Congressional chairs, nodding
their heads to the tirade of base
rhetoric that streams from the mouths
of their conservative peers. When will
Democrats stand?
Right now, the Democratic Party
is obsessed with engaging in the polit
ical process. While actor-turned-ac
tivist Charlton Heston stands before
crowds everyday shouting "when they
pry it from my cold, dead fingers," lib
erals meanwhile quietly fight for gun
control through the process of passing
legislation like the "Brady Bill."
Democrats are right in fighting
through the political process because
that's how policy is properly decided
upon. But they fail themselves and
their constituents when they rely on
that process to inspire people, in
stead of directly connecting with
their constituents. When was the last
time a Democrat inspired you?
Republicans cling to their "family
values" and moral righteousness.
They fight for what they believe to be
true and inspire their constituents by
reminding them constantly that they

share the same values, and that these
shared values lead to common goals.
Democrats have even greater
moral righteousness by supporting
racial equality, social welfare, em
ployees' rights and the environment.
But they forget that their con
stituents don't assume that their own
morals are the same as their party's.
Democratic leaders are so caught up
in the process of fighting on Capitol
Hill that they have forgotten their
constituents need to be inspired and
assured that the Democratic Party is
still fighting for them.
Democrats must stand up and be
re-recognized. They must remind the
voters of who they are and of why the
Democratic Party is better than the
Republican Party because it is.
When I think of the Democratic
Party, I think of a party that stands for
the most important things. I think of a
party that stands for the individual
above business. I think of a party that
stands for the environment above cor
porate expansion. I think of a
woman's right to choose; a gay per
son's right to be free; every person's
right to be educated and healthy.
When I think of the Democratic
Party, I think of a party that fights
above all for the people and their
rights. Where is the Democrat who
will stand up and remind us of this?
