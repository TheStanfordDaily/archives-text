# OP-ED
## Moscow program should stay open 
### ROB PERSON 
I was greatly saddened to read that
Overseas Programs has decided to
close the Stanford in Moscow program
this year. As an alumnus of the 2000
Stanford in Moscow program, I strong
ly believe that it provides a great ser
vice to the University as an institution
and to its students.
Underlying the decision to close the
Moscow center while pushing to open
new centers appears to be a belief on the
part of the OSP leadership that Russia is
simply not relevant since the collapse of
the Soviet Union and that there's little
need for students to study there. Need
less to say, this assumption is far from ac
curate. On the contrary, Russia remains
one of the great mysteries of modem so
cial science, as the post-Soviet transition
to democracy and authoritarianism
continues to defy explanation based on
current understandings. It would not be
inaccurate to say that we understand
less about Russia today than we did 15
years ago. Thus, from an academic
point of view, there is very much a need
to continue studying Russia.
One hardly needs to argue Rus
sia's relevance from a policy perspec
tive, though the OSP leadership
seems to have overlooked this impor
tant aspect as well. Despite the Sovi
et collapse, Russia remains a major
global power. Russia's role in the op
position to the war in Iraq, its partici
pation in the Mideast Quartet, its
emerging role as a major energy
source for the United States, and its
sometimes troubling links to regimes
in Iran and North Korea are all rea
sons why Russia remains relevant to
international relations. Furthermore,
there is little doubt that the Russian
economy is booming. As it continues

to grow, business opportunities in
Russia will multiply, making an un
derstanding of Russia essential for
those who wish to do business there.
To close the Stanford in Moscow
center now would mean walking away
from all this essential unfinished busi
ness. Stanford has a tradition of being a
leader in Russian and East European
studies in the United States. The origi
nal collection of the Hoover Institution
was based on Herbert Hoover's acquisi
tions in Russia, and continues to be one
of the premier Russian archives outside
of Russia. Similarly, organizations like
the Center for Russian, East European
and Eurasian Studies and the Institute
for International Studies have helped
make Stanford a great center of learn
ing about this remarkable part of the
world. The Stanford in Moscow pro
gram is part of that tradition. Undoubt
edly, closing the program will have neg
ative consequences for Stanford's capa
bilities and reputation as a leader in
Russian and Eurasian studies.
Perhaps most important to consider
is the disservice done to Stanford stu
dents by the closure of the Moscow
program. For many of us who studied
in Moscow, the experience was a major
milestone in our Stanford careers and
our lives. For myself, my time in
Moscow had an immeasurable impact
on my life: Because of the experience I
had in Moscow, I chose to devote my
self to the field of Russian studies and
pursue a doctoral degree in the field.
Someday I hope to teach Stanford stu
dents who, like me, want to know more
about this perplexing region. Howev
er, it's doubtful there will be such stu
dents at Stanford by that time.
The reason for my pessimism is that
one cannot truly understand Russia by
reading a book or listening to a lecture.

One must live Russia to understand
and tackle the questions I raised earli
er. OSP is essentially pulling the rug
out from under future generations of
Stanford Russian studies students, be
they students of international rela
tions, political science, history, sociolo
gy, economics, business or Slavic lan
guages and literature. In the long term,
this is a high price to pay for short-term
budget considerations.
Nevertheless, I do recognize that
the University and OSP face budget
constraints at present. There are
ways to reduce the costs of Stanford
in Moscow without abandoning the
whole program. By reducing the cen
ter's operations to autumn quarter
and by seeking less expensive facili
ties, I am sure that a solution can be
found to make the program more
economically viable. Yet I am skepti
cal about the willingness of the OSP
leadership to work toward a solution.
Having discussed the matter with
faculty at Stanford, I am led to be
lieve that the decision to close the
Moscow center was made without
any consultation with faculty and stu
dents who have an interest in keeping
the center open. This, along with a
desire to push forward with the open
ing of other centers amidst a bad
economy, suggests that OSP would
rather simply get rid of Moscow than
find a way to continue its operation.
Though costly in the short run, the
benefit brought to Stanford by the
Moscow program far outweighs its
costs. It's time for the University to un
derstand this fact and find a way to pre
serve Stanford in Moscow.
