# CARDINAL TODAY
## Football shoots for SoCal surprise 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The time for practice and preparation has
ended.
After easing into the schedule with a light
September slate, taking the field just three
times in the season's first six weeks, the Stan
ford football team faces a strong Pacific 10
Conference opponent each of the next seven
Saturdays.
The squad's 2-1 start is promising, but BYU
and San Jose State are the kind of teams Stan
ford is expected to beat. This weekend's game
at No. 9 Southern California (4-1) may be the
kind that the young Cardinal can only hope to
survive.
With a productive offense and one of the best
defenses in the nation, this year's Trojan team
has continued the program's recent trend of dis
mantling heralded opponents. A season-open
ing shutout of then-No. 6 Auburn announced to
the country that the loss of Heisman Trophy win
ner Carson Palmer hadn't slowed last year's Or
ange Bowl champions, and a 27-0 run to end last
week's win over Arizona State showed that USC
can still be dominant against tough conference
foes.
Not that Stanford is intimidated; the Cardi
nal has been itching to get back on the field and
show it's not the same squad that suffered an
embarrassing 47-17 home defeat to the Trojans
last year.
"We're excited to get back into our season,"
said Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens.
"We've had a productive two weeks with our

open week, and we're certainly facing a
formidable opponent in USC."
Defensive end Will Svitek, a senior, said the
players' mindset will be the key to avoiding a re
peat of last year's blowout loss.
"Last year, we were kind of waiting for some
thing bad to happen, and when it did happen, we
would collapse," he admitted. "That's not going
to happen this year. There's a lot of character on
this team."
Stanford's skill will be tested at least as
much as its character against a USC squad
that is stocked with talent at virtually every
position. Defensively, the biggest challenge
will be containing the gifted wide receiver
tandem of Mike Williams and Keary Col
bert.
Colbert, a four-year starter, and Williams, last
year's Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, combined
for three touchdowns against virtually the same
Stanford secondary in last year's game at Stan
ford Stadium.
The Cardinal defense may be able to put
more pressure on Trojan quarterback Matt
Leinart than it did against Palmer last year, but
this year's team appears to still be vulnerable to
long passing plays.
"They do have big-play capability," Teevens
said. "Can you eliminate it? Obviously you can
try, but no one's had success doing that against
Williams or Colbert. [Applying] pressure and
keeping them off balance is important."
Svitek added, "In the past Stanford's been
known for giving up big plays. When you have a
defense that does a lot of stunts, with a lot of com
munications involved, there's probably a bigger

chance for error."
The Cardinal has no intention of abandon
ing its attacking defensive style, so the burden
will be on the defensive backs to perform well in
single coverage. It won't be easy at 6-foot-2
and 6-foot-5, respectively, Colbert and
Williams enjoy significant height advantages
over most cornerbacks they face, and Stan
ford's are no exception.
Junior Stanford comerback Stanley Wilson
said he isn't worried.
"Most tall receivers usually want to push off,
so you just have to know what their tendencies
are," he said. "There's techniques to stop just
about any receiver."
Stanford will need to use techniques for stop
ping a defensive line to neutralize USC's "Wild
Bunch," regarded as the best defensive line in
college football.
"Offensively, we have to try to keep them off
balance," Teevens said. "We need to be produc
tive with the run, we'd like to control the ball as
effectively as possible, but also mix in the pass
productively as well."
That sounds like a daunting task, but it's not
impossible. Two weeks ago, unranked Califor
nia stunned the then-No. 3 Trojans at Berkeley
with a 34-31 win in triple-overtime.
USC head coach Pete Carroll isn't taking
anything for granted.
"We're concerned that they're coming off a
bye," he said. "I'm sure that they're going to have
new things prepared for us in an attempt to keep
us off balance. We're going to go in expecting the
unexpected, and we will have to make some ad
justments as the game goes on."
