# For rookie QBs, the heat is on

Stanford's defensive line doesn't have a
nickname.
"We like to let our play speak for itself,"
said junior defensive end Will Svitek.
Ranked third in the nation in run de
fense after three games, the Cardinal's play
so far has spoken to Pacific 10 Conference
opponents.
"They come out with a real interesting
style on defense," said USC head coach
Pete Carroll. "Very aggressive, very attack
ing and it caught the first couple of teams
totally off-guard because they did not know
what to prepare for."
Carroll knows a little bit about good
Pac-10 defenses â€” his team boasts the
most feared unit in the conference. The
"Wild Bunch," a group of four veteran
starters who routinely dominate the line of
scrimmage, is touted as the best defensive
line in the nation.
"We see them and we want to be that
great defensive line," said junior Svitek.
When the Cardinal and the Trojans
meet on Saturday at the Los Angeles Coli
seum, the outcome could hinge on which
team can protect its inexperienced quarter
back from the defensive onslaught.
For Stanford's Trent Edwards and
USC's Matt Leinart, both first-year
starters, pressure has come in more than
one form this year.
Edwards, a redshirt freshman, carries
the burden of a young player who has had
to battle for the confidence of his team
mates after being chosen to start ahead of
fifth-year senior Chris Lewis. Heralded by
some as the top quarterback prospect in the
nation coming out of high school, Edwards
must also live up to high expectations.
Leinart, a sophomore, directs a team
that won the Orange Bowl last year and has
the experience to go far this year. His pre
decessor at the position was Heisman Tro
phy winner Carson Palmer.
Is Edwards the next Elway? Is Leinart
the next Palmer? It's way too early to say,
and on Saturday the better question may be
whether either one can avoid becoming the
next meal for hungry beasts like Stanford's
Amon Gordon and USC's Mike Patterson.
Leinart has the benefit of a strong and
experienced offensive line, with a pair of
bookend tackles that rivals any in the
country. On the left side, senior Jacob
Rogers earned All-Pac 10 honors last
year, and on the right side, Winston Jus
tice was named a first-team Freshman-
All-American.
In contrast, Edwards plays behind a
young group that boasts just one returning
player with significant experience: senior
Kirk Chambers.
Against Brigham Young's all-out blitz
ing attack, the line failed to provide Ed
wards with any time to find a receiver, and
the Cardinal's passing game set a school
record for futility with just 56 yards. The
team rebounded somewhat against Wash
ington, gaining 159 yards and scoring two
touchdowns through the air, a sign that
both Edwards and his young blockers are
improving.
