# For rookie QBs, the heat is on

Stanford's defensive line doesn't have a
nickname.
"We like to let our play speak for itself,"
said junior defensive end Will Svitek.
Ranked third in the nation in run de
fense after three games, the Cardinal's play
so far has spoken to Pacific 10 Conference
opponents.
"They come out with a real interesting
style on defense," said USC head coach
Pete Carroll. "Very aggressive, very attack
ing and it caught the first couple of teams
totally off-guard because they did not know
what to prepare for."
Carroll knows a little bit about good
Pac-10 defenses — his team boasts the
most feared unit in the conference. The
"Wild Bunch," a group of four veteran
starters who routinely dominate the line of
scrimmage, is touted as the best defensive
line in the nation.
"We see them and we want to be that
great defensive line," said junior Svitek.
When the Cardinal and the Trojans
meet on Saturday at the Los Angeles Coli
seum, the outcome could hinge on which
team can protect its inexperienced quarter
back from the defensive onslaught.
For Stanford's Trent Edwards and
USC's Matt Leinart, both first-year
starters, pressure has come in more than
one form this year.
Edwards, a redshirt freshman, carries
the burden of a young player who has had
to battle for the confidence of his team
mates after being chosen to start ahead of
fifth-year senior Chris Lewis. Heralded by
some as the top quarterback prospect in the
nation coming out of high school, Edwards
must also live up to high expectations.
Leinart, a sophomore, directs a team
that won the Orange Bowl last year and has
the experience to go far this year. His pre
decessor at the position was Heisman Tro
phy winner Carson Palmer.
Is Edwards the next Elway? Is Leinart
the next Palmer? It's way too early to say,
and on Saturday the better question may be
whether either one can avoid becoming the
next meal for hungry beasts like Stanford's
Amon Gordon and USC's Mike Patterson.
Leinart has the benefit of a strong and
experienced offensive line, with a pair of
bookend tackles that rivals any in the
country. On the left side, senior Jacob
Rogers earned All-Pac 10 honors last
year, and on the right side, Winston Jus
tice was named a first-team Freshman-
All-American.
In contrast, Edwards plays behind a
young group that boasts just one returning
player with significant experience: senior
Kirk Chambers.
Against Brigham Young's all-out blitz
ing attack, the line failed to provide Ed
wards with any time to find a receiver, and
the Cardinal's passing game set a school
record for futility with just 56 yards. The
team rebounded somewhat against Wash
ington, gaining 159 yards and scoring two
touchdowns through the air, a sign that
both Edwards and his young blockers are
improving.
Leinart put up 235 yards and
threw three touchdowns against
BYU earlier this season, but he also
was picked off three times, a sign
that pressure influenced his deci
sion-making.
On Saturday, Leinart could be
hindered by injuries he suffered in
last week's 37-17 win over Arizona
State.
"We don't know yet how Matt
Leinart is going to be," Carroll said
on Tuesday. "We did not let him run
around yesterday, so we'll see how
he does today and tomorrow and
then we'll try and make an assess
ment."
The Cardinal is prepared for
Leinart, and if the toughness he ex
hibited in returning to last week's
game is an indicator, that's who
they'll face when USC takes the
field.
Stanford isn't taking him lightly.
"I think this guy is pretty good,"
said junior cornerback Stanley Wil
son. "He gets the ball to his re
ceivers."
Wilson, who summed up Stan
ford's defensive philosophy by say

ing, "You can never really be too ag
gressive," said the Cardinal would
likely continue its risk-taking style
against the Trojans.
"When you're blitzing all the
time, you're living on the edge and
hoping you can get a sack," he said.
But Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said that might be especial
ly difficult given Leinart's style of
play.
"They have a lot of three-step or
quick five-step drops to get the ball
up and out, and that's a hard thing to
attack," Teevens said. "If you stop
for just a moment, the quarterback
gets the ball out of his hand. Not
many people have had success pres
suring Leinart."
On the other side of the ball,
USC's specialty is getting into the
backfield to make big plays. Stan
ford junior running back Kenneth
Tolon and sophomore J.R. Lemon
may need to follow the example of
California rusher Adimchinobe
Echemandu, who revealed a chink
in the Trojans' armor by running
the ball up the middle with great
success.
If that happens, and Edwards
gets time to find his receivers, then
there's a chance that the Cardinal
players could be the "wild bunch"
on Saturday in celebrating an upset
victory.

hoping you can get a sack," he said.
But Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said that might be especial
ly difficult given Leinart's style of
play.
"They have a lot of three-step or
quick five-step drops to get the ball
up and out, and that's a hard thing to
attack," Teevens said. "If you stop
for just a moment, the quarterback
gets the ball out of his hand. Not
many people have had success pres
suring Leinart."
On the other side of the ball,
USC's specialty is getting into the
backfield to make big plays. Stan
ford junior running back Kenneth
Tolon and sophomore J.R. Lemon
may need to follow the example of
California rusher Adimchinobe
Echemandu, who revealed a chink
in the Trojans' armor by running
the ball up the middle with great
success.
If that happens, and Edwards
gets time to find his receivers, then
there's a chance that the Cardinal
players could be the "wild bunch"
on Saturday in celebrating an upset
victory.

J.R. Lemon (above) and Kenneth Tolon II. look to plow out yards on the
ground against USC to minimize the pressure on quarterback Trent Edwards
and the Stanford defense. The task will not be easy, as the Trojans
boast one of the nation's most fearsome defensive lines.
Stanford's defensive line doesn't have a
nickname.
"We like to let our play speak for itself,"
said junior defensive end Will Svitek.
Ranked third in the nation in run de
fense after three games, the Cardinal's play
so far has spoken to Pacific 10 Conference
opponents.
"They come out with a real interesting
style on defense," said USC head coach
Pete Carroll. "Very aggressive, very attack
ing and it caught the first couple of teams
totally off-guard because they did not know
what to prepare for."
Carroll knows a little bit about good
Pac-10 defenses — his team boasts the
most feared unit in the conference. The
"Wild Bunch," a group of four veteran
starters who routinely dominate the line of
scrimmage, is touted as the best defensive
line in the nation.
"We see them and we want to be that
great defensive line," said junior Svitek.
When the Cardinal and the Trojans
meet on Saturday at the Los Angeles Coli
seum, the outcome could hinge on which
team can protect its inexperienced quarter
back from the defensive onslaught.
For Stanford's Trent Edwards and
USC's Matt Leinart, both first-year
starters, pressure has come in more than
one form this year.
Edwards, a redshirt freshman, carries
the burden of a young player who has had
to battle for the confidence of his team
mates after being chosen to start ahead of
fifth-year senior Chris Lewis. Heralded by
some as the top quarterback prospect in the
nation coming out of high school, Edwards
must also live up to high expectations.
Leinart, a sophomore, directs a team
that won the Orange Bowl last year and has
the experience to go far this year. His pre
decessor at the position was Heisman Tro
phy winner Carson Palmer.
Is Edwards the next Elway? Is Leinart
the next Palmer? It's way too early to say,
and on Saturday the better question may be
whether either one can avoid becoming the
next meal for hungry beasts like Stanford's
Amon Gordon and USC's Mike Patterson.
Leinart has the benefit of a strong and
experienced offensive line, with a pair of
bookend tackles that rivals any in the
country. On the left side, senior Jacob
Rogers earned All-Pac 10 honors last
year, and on the right side, Winston Jus
tice was named a first-team Freshman-
All-American.
In contrast, Edwards plays behind a
young group that boasts just one returning
player with significant experience: senior
Kirk Chambers.
Against Brigham Young's all-out blitz
ing attack, the line failed to provide Ed
wards with any time to find a receiver, and
the Cardinal's passing game set a school
record for futility with just 56 yards. The
team rebounded somewhat against Wash
ington, gaining 159 yards and scoring two
touchdowns through the air, a sign that
both Edwards and his young blockers are
improving.
Leinart put up 235 yards and
threw three touchdowns against
BYU earlier this season, but he also
was picked off three times, a sign
that pressure influenced his deci
sion-making.
On Saturday, Leinart could be
hindered by injuries he suffered in
last week's 37-17 win over Arizona
State.
"We don't know yet how Matt
Leinart is going to be," Carroll said
on Tuesday. "We did not let him run
around yesterday, so we'll see how
he does today and tomorrow and
then we'll try and make an assess
ment."
The Cardinal is prepared for
Leinart, and if the toughness he ex
hibited in returning to last week's
game is an indicator, that's who
they'll face when USC takes the
field.
Stanford isn't taking him lightly.
"I think this guy is pretty good,"
said junior cornerback Stanley Wil
son. "He gets the ball to his re
ceivers."
Wilson, who summed up Stan
ford's defensive philosophy by say

ing, "You can never really be too ag
gressive," said the Cardinal would
likely continue its risk-taking style
against the Trojans.
"When you're blitzing all the
time, you're living on the edge and
hoping you can get a sack," he said.
But Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said that might be especial
ly difficult given Leinart's style of
play.
"They have a lot of three-step or
quick five-step drops to get the ball
up and out, and that's a hard thing to
attack," Teevens said. "If you stop
for just a moment, the quarterback
gets the ball out of his hand. Not

suring Leinart."
