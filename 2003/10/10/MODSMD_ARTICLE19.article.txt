# ATOGWE A Deeper Look

### NATHAN KURZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Apparently, Stanford's hard-hitting starting free safety
does have a soft spot.

Oshiomogho Atogwe collects comic books.
"It's a real relaxing hobby," he said. "It allows me
to get away from actual reality and move into a
fantasy world."

But why would the junior defender be in
need of that kind of escapism right now, when he's
doing his very best to masquerade as the Incredi
ble Hulk on the football field.

Atogwe has been instrumental in bringing
about a defensive turnaround for the Cardinal from
a year ago.

Consider the following:
In 2002, the defense allowed, on average,
34.3 points, 385 yards in total offense, 3.7 yards a
rush and a 56 percent completion rate.

But through three games this season, op
ponents have averaged only 17.3 points, 324
yards, 2.1 yards a rush and a 48.3 percent com
pletion rate.

Might Atogwe's presence as
"quarterback of the defense" (as Stan
ley Wilson puts it) have anything to
do with this defensive revolution?

Listen to the Field
General, and he implies he's
got the defense operating
at optimum efficiency.

22-year-old Atogwe said. "That kind
of subtle stuff makes a big difference
in the defense."
Atogwe has made more than a
subtle difference in the Cardinal de
fensive scheme this season al
though that was pretty much expect
ed of him after a solid sophomore
year.
Stanford's leading returning tack
ier from a year ago was supposed to
be the cog in the defense this season,
the stabilizing force in a more-experi
enced-but-less-proven group.
He's been that and more.
Atogwe is second on the team
with 21 tackles, has intercepted two
passes (good for second in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference) and has forced
three fumbles.
"He's all over the place," said
USC coach Pete Carroll, who will get
an up-close look at the Cardinal free
safety this week. "He's nicely sized
and physical and seems to be taking
advantage of the scheme they're
putting him in."
Atogwe played defensive back in
high school and was actually recruit
ed by Stanford at that position. (He
didn't make the switch to safety until
the spring of 2000, when the Cardinal
had to replace two starting safeties
due to graduation plus Coy Wire,
who moved to linebacker.)
To make matters more complicat
ed, Atogwe switched from strong to
free safety in the offseason, putting
more pass and less run coverage re
sponsibility on Atogwe's shoulders.
Translation? He gets more free
reign in the secondary.
And that's bad news for wide re
ceivers going over the middle
since they'll always be looking over
their shoulder, hoping to sidestep the
vengeance of No. 21.
Then again, what more would you
expect from a Tank Williams pro
tege? Atogwe watched Williams,
now a safety for the NFL's Ten
nessee Titans, instill fear in many a
receiver during his days at Stanford.
So what's his key to delivering the
perfect blow?
"The weight room helps because
[your added-size] makes you a lot
more confident so you think you can
take on the world," Atogwe said.
But?
"It's more the desire," he ex
plained. "It's an instinct thing. When
you think about it, you are liable to
make a mistake. When he's coming,
you just go and hit him. You have to
believe that there's nothing a guy can
do to stop you if you really want to
get him down."
The 6-foot, 205-pound safety
seems to have a sixth sense for the
ball.
It might have something to do
with the fact that Atogwe started
playing football at age seven in
Windsor, Ontario, following his

then-l 1-year-old brother to practice.
"I played because he played,"
Atogwe said of his brother. "As I got
older, he took me under his wing and
showed me how to play."
Atogwe's uncanny football sense
might also be embedded in his foot
ball roots at running back.
O.J. (as his family and friends
call him) grew up idolizing Walter
Payton, who played just across the
border in Chicago. From grade
school to high school, he spent time
honing his running back skills in
hopes of becoming the next
"Sweetness."
But once he arrived at Stanford as
a cornerback, Atogwe realized the
aggressiveness and attacking style he

loved best was better suited for de
fense.
Obviously, he's come a long way
since then.
"He's a great guy to be around,"
said Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens. "He's not real outspoken
or loud or verbose, but his message is
unity and that is certainly heard by
everyone in the defensive group."
Atogwe can be vocal when he
needs to.be, especially when peers in
the secondary, including starting red
shirt freshmen T.J. Rushing and
Trevor Hooper, need encouragement.
"I try to get them to have confi
dence in themselves," Atogwe said.
"The thing that keeps a younger guy
from playing up to his potential is

worrying about making a mistake.
"You think that if you do some
thing wrong, somehow the coach
won't play you. I try to reassure them
that they know what they're doing.
As soon as they've got that locked in,
I tell them to just go out there and
play."
Atogwe the instinctive general,
the hard-hitter and the comforting
mentor is also a devout Christian
who attends church and bible study
every week.
"I've always looked to God for
strength and comfort," he said. "It's
the center of my world."
Right now, Atogwe is the center
of Stanford's defense, too. Almost
like Charles Xavier and the X-Men.

"It's a real relaxing hobby," he said. "It allows me
to get away from actual reality and move into a
fantasy world."

But why would the junior defender be in
need of that kind of escapism right now, when he's
doing his very best to masquerade as the Incredi
ble Hulk on the football field.

Atogwe has been instrumental in bringing
about a defensive turnaround for the Cardinal from
a year ago.

Consider the following:
In 2002, the defense allowed, on average,
34.3 points, 385 yards in total offense, 3.7 yards a
rush and a 56 percent completion rate.

But through three games this season, op
ponents have averaged only 17.3 points, 324
yards, 2.1 yards a rush and a 48.3 percent com
pletion rate.

Might Atogwe's presence as
"quarterback of the defense" (as Stan
ley Wilson puts it) have anything to
do with this defensive revolution?

Listen to the Field
General, and he implies he's
got the defense operating
at optimum efficiency.

22-year-old Atogwe said. "That kind
of subtle stuff makes a big difference
in the defense."
Atogwe has made more than a
subtle difference in the Cardinal de
fensive scheme this season al
though that was pretty much expect
ed of him after a solid sophomore
year.
Stanford's leading returning tack
ier from a year ago was supposed to
be the cog in the defense this season,
the stabilizing force in a more-experi
enced-but-less-proven group.
He's been that and more.
Atogwe is second on the team
with 21 tackles, has intercepted two
passes (good for second in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference) and has forced
three fumbles.
"He's all over the place," said
USC coach Pete Carroll, who will get
an up-close look at the Cardinal free
safety this week. "He's nicely sized
and physical and seems to be taking
advantage of the scheme they're
putting him in."
Atogwe played defensive back in
high school and was actually recruit
ed by Stanford at that position. (He
didn't make the switch to safety until
the spring of 2000, when the Cardinal
had to replace two starting safeties
due to graduation plus Coy Wire,
who moved to linebacker.)
To make matters more complicat
ed, Atogwe switched from strong to
free safety in the offseason, putting
more pass and less run coverage re
sponsibility on Atogwe's shoulders.
Translation? He gets more free
reign in the secondary.
And that's bad news for wide re
ceivers going over the middle
since they'll always be looking over
their shoulder, hoping to sidestep the
vengeance of No. 21.
Then again, what more would you
expect from a Tank Williams pro
tege? Atogwe watched Williams,
now a safety for the NFL's Ten
nessee Titans, instill fear in many a
receiver during his days at Stanford.
So what's his key to delivering the
perfect blow?
"The weight room helps because
[your added-size] makes you a lot
more confident so you think you can
take on the world," Atogwe said.
But?
"It's more the desire," he ex
plained. "It's an instinct thing. When
you think about it, you are liable to
make a mistake. When he's coming,
you just go and hit him. You have to
believe that there's nothing a guy can
do to stop you if you really want to
get him down."
The 6-foot, 205-pound safety
seems to have a sixth sense for the
ball.
It might have something to do
with the fact that Atogwe started
playing football at age seven in
Windsor, Ontario, following his

then-l 1-year-old brother to practice.
"I played because he played,"
Atogwe said of his brother. "As I got
older, he took me under his wing and
showed me how to play."
Atogwe's uncanny football sense
might also be embedded in his foot
ball roots at running back.
O.J. (as his family and friends
call him) grew up idolizing Walter
Payton, who played just across the
border in Chicago. From grade
school to high school, he spent time
honing his running back skills in
hopes of becoming the next
"Sweetness."
But once he arrived at Stanford as
a cornerback, Atogwe realized the
aggressiveness and attacking style he

loved best was better suited for de
fense.
Obviously, he's come a long way
since then.
"He's a great guy to be around,"
said Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens. "He's not real outspoken
or loud or verbose, but his message is
unity and that is certainly heard by
everyone in the defensive group."
Atogwe can be vocal when he
needs to.be, especially when peers in
the secondary, including starting red
shirt freshmen T.J. Rushing and
Trevor Hooper, need encouragement.
"I try to get them to have confi
dence in themselves," Atogwe said.
"The thing that keeps a younger guy
from playing up to his potential is

worrying about making a mistake.
"You think that if you do some
thing wrong, somehow the coach
won't play you. I try to reassure them
that they know what they're doing.
As soon as they've got that locked in,
I tell them to just go out there and
play."
Atogwe the instinctive general,
the hard-hitter and the comforting
mentor is also a devout Christian
who attends church and bible study
every week.
"I've always looked to God for
strength and comfort," he said. "It's
the center of my world."
Right now, Atogwe is the center
of Stanford's defense, too. Almost
like Charles Xavier and the X-Men.
Apparently, Stanford's hard-hitting starting free safety
does have a soft spot.
