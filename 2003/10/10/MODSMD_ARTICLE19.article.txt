# ATOGWE A Deeper Look

Apparently, Stanford's hard-hitting starting free safety
does have a soft spot.

Oshiomogho Atogwe collects comic books.
"It's a real relaxing hobby," he said. "It allows me
to get away from actual reality and move into a
fantasy world."

But why would the junior defender be in
need of that kind of escapism right now, when he's
doing his very best to masquerade as the Incredi
ble Hulk on the football field.

Atogwe has been instrumental in bringing
about a defensive turnaround for the Cardinal from
a year ago.

Consider the following:
In 2002, the defense allowed, on average,
34.3 points, 385 yards in total offense, 3.7 yards a
rush and a 56 percent completion rate.

But through three games this season, op
ponents have averaged only 17.3 points, 324
yards, 2.1 yards a rush and a 48.3 percent com
pletion rate.

"quarterback of the defense" (as Stan
ley Wilson puts it) have anything to
do with this defensive revolution?

Listen to the Field
General, and he implies he's
got the defense operating
at optimum efficiency.
