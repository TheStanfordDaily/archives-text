Incidents following or related to the campus "serial grop
er" have pushed the number of sexual assault cases on cam
pus to its highest level in years, according to the Stanford Uni
versity Department of Public Safety.
A total of 21 cases related to the serial groper have been
reported since last May, the most recent occurring on the
night of Oct. 6.
Stanford police are still trying to track down the offender.
They believe the same man has committed all of these crimes,
which are officially termed "sexual offense battery with
hands."
"We are attributing this to one person because his M.O. is
the same," Sgt. Rick Tipton said.
The high number of sexual assault cases on campus has
police worried.

"The nature of the activity isn't particularly unusual on
campus, but the number of cases does make this case unusu
al," said Director of Public Safety Laura Wilson. "This type
of activity always causes us concern."
One student, who wished to remain anonymous, was as
saulted on Sept. 22, the same day that three other incidents
were also reported.
"I was busy talking to my friend when I heard a bike be
hind us," she said. "I figured that person wanted to get by-so
I moved over. As I moved over, this guy grabbed my butt. His
hand was halfway outside my skirt and halfway up my thigh.
The victim said that after the "serial groper" touched her,
he rode slowly away from Mars, where the incident took
place.
"At first I thought it was a friend of mine and that at any
minute he was going to turn around, but nope," she said.
Incidents of a similar nature have
been reported in recent weeks.
A man matching the description
of the serial groper heavy-set,
light-to-olive skin tone, between 5-
foot-7 and 5-foot-9, with a buzz cut
was reported to be bothering two
girls who live on the first floor of
Soto. When asked to leave, he did,
but then returned. When asked to
leave a second time, he left and did
not come back.
However, the police department
cautioned community members not
to jump to conclusions when linking
thisincident to the serial groper.
"We have a general description
[of the prowler] that's similar, but it
matches the description of many
dining service workers, janitorial
staff and animal lab workers, to

name a few," Tipton said. "We can't
assume it's the same man just be
cause this general description
matches and it's convenient. There's
really no indication that it's the same
person."
Wilson said, however, that the
police department is "investigating
the possibility" that this case is relat
ed to that of the serial groper.
Further, accounts of a man
matching the description of the seri
al groper prowling in the women's
restroom at Soto were spread
through dorm e-mail lists.
An unrelated but similarly ques
tionable incident occurred last
week when a naked man was found
masturbating between two Shur
gards outside Enchanted Broccoli
Forest.
According to junior Itamar
Rosenn, who witnessed the act, the
middle-aged man jumped into a blue
Saturn and drove away when he saw
that Rosenn had noticed him.
