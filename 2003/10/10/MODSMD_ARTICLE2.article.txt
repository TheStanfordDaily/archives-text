Incidents following or related to the campus "serial grop
er" have pushed the number of sexual assault cases on cam
pus to its highest level in years, according to the Stanford Uni
versity Department of Public Safety.
A total of 21 cases related to the serial groper have been
reported since last May, the most recent occurring on the
night of Oct. 6.
Stanford police are still trying to track down the offender.
They believe the same man has committed all of these crimes,
which are officially termed "sexual offense battery with
hands."
"We are attributing this to one person because his M.O. is
the same," Sgt. Rick Tipton said.
The high number of sexual assault cases on campus has
police worried.

"The nature of the activity isn't particularly unusual on
campus, but the number of cases does make this case unusu
al," said Director of Public Safety Laura Wilson. "This type
of activity always causes us concern."
One student, who wished to remain anonymous, was as
saulted on Sept. 22, the same day that three other incidents
were also reported.
"I was busy talking to my friend when I heard a bike be
hind us," she said. "I figured that person wanted to get by-so
I moved over. As I moved over, this guy grabbed my butt. His
hand was halfway outside my skirt and halfway up my thigh.
The victim said that after the "serial groper" touched her,
he rode slowly away from Mars, where the incident took
place.
"At first I thought it was a friend of mine and that at any
minute he was going to turn around, but nope," she said.
