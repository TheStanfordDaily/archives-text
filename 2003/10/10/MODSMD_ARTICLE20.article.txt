# Despite upset at Cal, USC still a top dog
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Southern California is ranked No. 9 nation
ally, dominated lowa in the Orange Bowl last
year, and has more wins this season than Stan
ford has in two seasons combined. A veritable
factory of NFL stars, sunny USC is the creamof
the Pacific 10 Conference crop, while Stanford
is a young team fighting its way up from last
year's 2-9 debacle.
The Trojans have one thing in common with
the Cardinal, though they hate Cal.
It was California, a team picked in the pre
season media poll to finish behind Stanford and
ahead of only Arizona in the Pac-10, which
handed then-No. 3 USC a legitimate nation
al-championship contender a shocking loss
two weeks ago.
The Trojans (4-1, 1-1 Pac-10) are resilient,
though, and enter tomorrow's game a 22-point
favorite over Stanford (2-1,0-1).
This year's squad has had to cope with the
loss of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback
Carson Palmer, lightning-quick running back
Justin Fargas and Ail-American safety Troy
Polamalu to the NFL, but its approach and its
performance remain similar to last year.
Knowing the way Pete Carroll coaches and
the talent the Trojans bring to the table, a re
peat of last year's late-season surge into a BCS
bowl is not at all out of the question espe
cially now that freshman LenDale White, who
rushed for 141 yards last week, may finally have
given the team the running game it needs to
complement solid sophomore quarterback
Matt Leinart and big-time receiver Mike
Williams.
But, what happened against Cal?

For a team like Southern Cal that's going to
be in the polls and in the BCS hunt all season,
the loss to Cal is going to be there week after
week a big blue-and-gold albatross around
the Trojans' necks.
The Golden Bears beat USC in triple over
time, 34-31, on Sept. 27 in Berkeley. After USC
rallied from a 14-point second-half deficit to tie
it on a Ryan Killeen field goal with 16 seconds
remaining in regulation, the teams played three
wild extra stanzas, featuring a fumble, a blocked
field goal, and excellent passing by Cal's Reggie
Robertson and Leinart. In the third period,
Killeen missed a 39-yarder, and Cal's Tyler
Fredrickson quickly made a 38-yarder to win it
at the other end.

It was a great game, but it was also a stunning
game. Cal had played its best football and USC
had put forth a middling effort, yes, but a loss is
still a loss Southern Cal's first in eleven
games.

"When you're on a streak, you get to think
ing [losing] will never happen to you, but it can,"
Carroll said matter-of-factly after the loss. "A
lot of things happened .. .too many things got
away from us."
Cal, for its part, didn't have much pity for
their highest-ranked victim since 1975. USC's
storied legacy sometimes brings a storied atti
tude with it, Bears receiver Jonathan Makon
nen intoned.

"They always take us lightly," Makonnen
said. "They really don't respect us. They're a
talented team, but they were kind of lackadaisi
cal out there."
