# SPORTS
## Simply put, spectating is for suckers 
### 
No, guys, I'm not writing about base
ball, so let's all relax. I wouldn't
have even known the Playoffs were
going on if my sister didn't live two
blocks from Wrigley Field. I actually had to
do a Google search just to see if it was
Wrigley Field or Stadium.
I don't follow baseball, or any other pro
fessional sport for that matter, because I hate
spectating. I used to go to Dodger games for
the pure joy of eating those Carnation choco
late ice creams and chanting "Daaarryyyl."
Not like you have a choice when you're
twelve.

Once I was in Stanford Stadium, for Big
Game 2001. I vaguely remember waking
from my jello-shot slumber on Cal's side just
in time to get hit in the head by a rock.
In fact, the only time I have ever enjoyed
spectating, I was abroad "expanding my hori
zons." Beer and sausages in hand, I gave my

love to Mika Hakkinen and
spit Finnish profanities at
his Ferrari competitors.
That's Formula One racing,
by the way. And if that
doesn't count as "athletic,"
then all you bowling, chess,
table tennis, and "Too Fast,
Too Furious" aficionados
can just give up already.
And golf is very, very bor
derline.

Could someone explain to me why syn
chronized swimming is a sport?
Marginalized from the "athletes don't
wear makeup" school of thought, and cast
into the pit of artistic blasphemy along with
cheerleaders, they also get called anorexic
behind their backs. Yet these women have
more impressive and encompassing physical
prowess than arguably any team at Stanford:
they're as flexible as ballerinas, can propel
themselves out of the water, hold their breath
forever, make pretty designs and do it all in
sync. Check them out at gostanford.ocsn.com
if you can't wait for their season in January.
If physical prowess were the clarifying fac
tor between sports and non-sports, yoga
would be an Olympic sport and shooting
would be left to the NRA. Cirque du Soleil
gets spectators, but that's art, not sport, un
less we're talking about the Cirque's
provocative Zumanity show in Vegas, which
is (I quote the Web page) "eroticism." Which
also attracts spectators, as freshman boys
across campus slink off to Ford Center to
"watch the gymnasts".
If showing skin were the determining fac
tor between highly-spectated sports and
empty bleachers, then the NCAA 2001 and
2002 Champion women's tennis team would
be seeing a lot more visitors, and we would be
questioning the legions of male fans amped
up by watching a bunch of virile college men
in tight pants tackling each other. Or the fans
watching wrestlers tussle around in spandex
singlets.
If white tigers were the dividing factor be
tween successful magic shows and ... never
mind.
I can understand spectating, be it art or
sports. It's a release, a time to be passive
and play observer, entertainment,
voyeurism, playing out archetypal themes
of mythic victory, whatever. What I can't
relate to is Cubs fans honking and scream
ing for hours after a game, or 6th Man
members who obsessively get their friends
to take their IDs to basketball games so
they can gain "points" and "rewards" when
they can't make a game. Or frat boys in full
body paint. This is all great and celebrato
ry, but wouldn't you rather get on the field
yourself?
I know, I know, spectators are a necessary
part of any successful athletic enterprise. But
if you love the sport so much, why watch
someone else do it? It's a tease, really. They
get to get dirty, work their asses off, feel the
surge of adrenaline and camaraderie, excite
ment and endorphins.
It's like if you were watching me eat a
giant piece of fudge cake smothered with
mocha almond fudge and raspberries. Which
I do often. Are you going to pay to watch
this? Start a fan club and make some "Julie
eats good" jerseys? Or if you're an old man
with lots of money, you can become my
booster and pay for my housing.
Get your own chocolate. Get your own en
ergy high, your own endorphins, give your
self a workout.
Check out the running club at
running.stanford.edu (as they enthusiastical
ly advertise in chalk every fifty yards of Cam
pus loop). Sign up for the student specials at
Yoga Source or Yoga Ladera. For a really
humbling experience, take a ballet class and
try lifting your leg. I'm serious.
If you'd rather be passive, or an enthusias
tic passivist, as many sports spectators are,
then have at it. Make the game yours and you
may find yourself unexpectedly entertained -
without paying Showtime $44.95 this Sat
urzay for the fun.

Want some company to watch the baseball
playoffs this weekend? Don't ask Julie.But if
you think you've got something worthwhile to
say, e-mail her at julieolo@stanford.edu.

In fact, the only time I have ever enjoyed
spectating, I was abroad "expanding my hori
zons." Beer and sausages in hand, I gave my

love to Mika Hakkinen and
spit Finnish profanities at
his Ferrari competitors.
That's Formula One racing,
by the way. And if that
doesn't count as "athletic,"
then all you bowling, chess,
table tennis, and "Too Fast,
Too Furious" aficionados
can just give up already.
And golf is very, very bor
derline.

Could someone explain to me why syn
chronized swimming is a sport?
Marginalized from the "athletes don't
wear makeup" school of thought, and cast
into the pit of artistic blasphemy along with
cheerleaders, they also get called anorexic
behind their backs. Yet these women have
more impressive and encompassing physical
prowess than arguably any team at Stanford:
they're as flexible as ballerinas, can propel
themselves out of the water, hold their breath
forever, make pretty designs and do it all in
sync. Check them out at gostanford.ocsn.com
if you can't wait for their season in January.
If physical prowess were the clarifying fac
tor between sports and non-sports, yoga
would be an Olympic sport and shooting
would be left to the NRA. Cirque du Soleil
gets spectators, but that's art, not sport, un
less we're talking about the Cirque's
provocative Zumanity show in Vegas, which
is (I quote the Web page) "eroticism." Which
also attracts spectators, as freshman boys
across campus slink off to Ford Center to
"watch the gymnasts".
If showing skin were the determining fac
tor between highly-spectated sports and
empty bleachers, then the NCAA 2001 and
2002 Champion women's tennis team would
be seeing a lot more visitors, and we would be
questioning the legions of male fans amped
up by watching a bunch of virile college men
in tight pants tackling each other. Or the fans
watching wrestlers tussle around in spandex
singlets.
If white tigers were the dividing factor be
tween successful magic shows and ... never
mind.
I can understand spectating, be it art or
sports. It's a release, a time to be passive
and play observer, entertainment,
voyeurism, playing out archetypal themes
of mythic victory, whatever. What I can't
relate to is Cubs fans honking and scream
ing for hours after a game, or 6th Man
members who obsessively get their friends
to take their IDs to basketball games so
they can gain "points" and "rewards" when
they can't make a game. Or frat boys in full
body paint. This is all great and celebrato
ry, but wouldn't you rather get on the field
yourself?
I know, I know, spectators are a necessary
part of any successful athletic enterprise. But
if you love the sport so much, why watch
someone else do it? It's a tease, really. They
get to get dirty, work their asses off, feel the
surge of adrenaline and camaraderie, excite
ment and endorphins.
It's like if you were watching me eat a
giant piece of fudge cake smothered with
mocha almond fudge and raspberries. Which
I do often. Are you going to pay to watch
this? Start a fan club and make some "Julie
eats good" jerseys? Or if you're an old man
with lots of money, you can become my
booster and pay for my housing.
Get your own chocolate. Get your own en
ergy high, your own endorphins, give your
self a workout.
Check out the running club at
running.stanford.edu (as they enthusiastical
ly advertise in chalk every fifty yards of Cam
pus loop). Sign up for the student specials at
Yoga Source or Yoga Ladera. For a really
humbling experience, take a ballet class and
try lifting your leg. I'm serious.
If you'd rather be passive, or an enthusias
tic passivist, as many sports spectators are,
then have at it. Make the game yours and you
may find yourself unexpectedly entertained -
without paying Showtime $44.95 this Sat
urzay for the fun.

Want some company to watch the baseball
playoffs this weekend? Don't ask Julie.But if
you think you've got something worthwhile to
say, e-mail her at julieolo@stanford.edu.
