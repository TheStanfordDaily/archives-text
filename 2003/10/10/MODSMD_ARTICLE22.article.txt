# Polo looks to rebound
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One week after an agonizing defeat to
California in sudden-death overtime in the
championship game of the Northern Cali
fornia Tournament, the No. 2 Stanford
men's water polo team heads south to do
battle against No. 4 Southern California.
Just last week, the Trojans were ranked at
the top of the division, but they too were
beaten by the Golden Bears in NorCal and
have dropped three spots in the latest
coaches' poll.
Stanford (8-2) and USC (10-2) are the
only teams in the Mountain Pacific Sports
League with only two losses.
"SC is coming off of two tough losses in
the last tournament and we're coming off of
a tough loss, so both teams should be fired
up," said junior field Trent Wiesen. "We're
out to make a point. Despite what the rank
ings might say, I think most people still have
the two of us at the top."
This weekend's game will figure largely
in how both the Cardinal and the Trojans
are considered for the at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament.
"This is definitely a big one for the at
large bid," said junior driver Matt Moser.
"Right now, it's the four teams that are at
the top: us, USC, Pepperdine and Cal. In
the Southern California tournament, we
lost to [USC] in triple overtime and we're
definitely looking for revenge coming
back."
The MPSF is the strongest league in the
nation, with teams fighting it out to earn the
wild-card spot in the NCAA tournament
this December.
"For the most part, the top eight teams
in the country are usually from MPSF. Be
cause of the way the tournament is set up,
there's going to be a Division II team and
also a team from the East Coast, but usual
ly the wild-card comes from the MPSF,"
Wiesen said.
It is especially important then, that Stan
ford distinguishes itself from the four teams
that are currently at the top of the MPSF
rankings.
"In a lot of ways I think this weekend is
going to send a message to the rest of the
league and it's a good chance for whichever
team wins to separate themselves from the
rest of the pack. We're going down pre
pared to battle and they're going to come
out the same way," Wiesen said.
And given the way the panel decides

who makes the wild-card spot, the fact
that the Cardinal has already lost once to
the Trojans makes winning this game a
necessity.
"Stanford and SC only have two losses.
Everyone else has three or four at least and
a lot of the criteria for the at-large bid is
games-against. SC has a win against us, so
we really need a win against them too,"
Moser explained.
The Southern and Northern California
Tournaments have shown the Cardinal that
it must come out strong against the Trojans

from the very start of the game.
"We've been coming out kind of flat,
like against Cal," Moser said. "They caught
back up and got the lead. It was the same
thing against Pepper dine, we had to work
hard in the last half. We ended up outscor
ing them 7-1 in the last quarter and so we're
going to try to come out the first quarter
and seal the deal right away."
"We feel like we've had moments of bril
liance on both offense and defense, but we
haven't been able to bring everything to
gether for one game," he said.

One of Stanford's greatest weaknesses
may be the size of its bench. The team has
an excellent number of strong players, but it
can't bring as many fresh players into the
pool as the starters grow tired.
"We don't have a very deep bench...to
have to play two games a day and then go
into triple overtime it starts testing how
much you can really bring forward," Moser
said.

After falling to Cal last weekend, the Stanford water polo team tries to get back on track and secure its position for an at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament when it faces fellow MPSF heavyweight USC in Los Angeles.
In light of his outstanding playing
during the NorCal Tournament, ju
nior driver Tony Azevedo was
named MPSF Co-Player of the
Week, sharing the award with Cal's
Atilla Banhidy. Although Azevedo
leads the Cardinal with 26 goals for
the season (ten of which he scored
during the NorCal tournament), he
feels the award meant little in terms
of his playing.
"I go out there and try to play
hard every time," Azevedo said.
"If our team wins, then I'll be the
man. I would have much rather
have had the win than gotten the
co-player."
The match is set to tipoff at 4 p.m.
at USC.

and seal the deal right away."
"We feel like we've had moments of bril
liance on both offense and defense, but we
haven't been able to bring everything to
gether for one game," he said.

One of Stanford's greatest weaknesses
may be the size of its bench. The team has
an excellent number of strong players, but it
can't bring as many fresh players into the
pool as the starters grow tired.
"We don't have a very deep bench...to
have to play two games a day and then go
into triple overtime it starts testing how
much you can really bring forward," Moser
said.

After falling to Cal last weekend, the Stanford water polo team tries to get back on track and secure its position for an at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament when it faces fellow MPSF heavyweight USC in Los Angeles.
In light of his outstanding playing
during the NorCal Tournament, ju
nior driver Tony Azevedo was
named MPSF Co-Player of the
Week, sharing the award with Cal's
Atilla Banhidy. Although Azevedo
leads the Cardinal with 26 goals for
the season (ten of which he scored
during the NorCal tournament), he
feels the award meant little in terms
of his playing.
"I go out there and try to play
hard every time," Azevedo said.
"If our team wins, then I'll be the
man. I would have much rather
have had the win than gotten the
co-player."
The match is set to tipoff at 4 p.m.
at USC.
