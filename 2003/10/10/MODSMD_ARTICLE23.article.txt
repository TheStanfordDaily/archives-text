# 'Big Spike' big test for Stanford
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It might not draw the same atten
tion as Big Game, but this Saturday's
"Big Spike" volleyball's equiva
lent to the heated Stanford / Califor
nia football showdown is the first
time that the Cardinal and Golden
Bears will face each other with both
teams ranked in the top-10.
In the most recent USA / AVCA
Coach's Poll, which came out on Oct.
6, Stanford (12-2, 6-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) stood at No. 4 while Califor
nia (14-0,6-0 Pac 10) was at No. 9.
Furthermore, both teams are un
defeated in Pac-10 play, which is con
sidered the toughest conference in the
nation, with five teams ranked in the
nation's top-25. USC remains No. 1,
UCLA stands at No. 8 and Washing
ton is No. 13.
Against non-conference teams,
the Pac-10 is 67-25 (.728) and Califor
nia and USC are two of three teams in
the nation that remain undefeated.
Saturday's match marks the start of
three of Stanford's toughest Pac-10
matches. While the Cardinal is unde
feated in conference at 6-0, they have
yet to face Cal, UCLA and USC. Stan
ford will face UCLA and USC next
Thursday and Friday on the Farm.
"We're definitely taking one
match at a time and preparing for
each team separately," senior middle
blocker Jennifer Harvey said. "Right
now we're focused on Cal and what
we need to do to play well on Satur
day, we're really excited for these
next three matches because they are
all against really good teams."
Historically, Stanford holds an
edge in the series, leading 51-3 all time
against the Golden Bears, including
two wins over Cal last year and every
year before that back to 1982, when
Stanford lost in Berkeley 3-1.
"Our coach did mention our histo
ry against Cal and that we've always
done very well against them and that
can be an added mental factor for
both teams," Harvey said. "They are
going to be very excited to play us and
if I was them I'd reallv want to beat us.

They've had such a great season so far
and they're not going to want to lose
their undefeated record, so it's going
to be important for us to match their
intensity."
Cal enters the match coming off
two big wins in Arizona where it
swept Arizona and Arizona State for
the first time since 1989 and a 3-2
win over No. 14 Santa Clara on
Wednesday. Like the Golden Bears,
Stanford is also coming off a sweep in
Arizona and a non-conference win
over No. 23 Pacific.
Another similarity between these
two teams is that they are both led on
offense by junior outside hitters
Stanford by Ogonna Nnamani and
California by Mia Jerkov. Jerkov,
who is just 35 kills shy of the 1,000-ca
reer benchmark, is averaging six kills
and 3.17 digs per game. Nnamani, a
two time Ail-American, averages 5.4
kills per game, and recorded 20 or
more kills in three matches. Nnamani
reached the 1,000-kill mark at the end
of her sophomore year.
Setting for California will be fresh
man Samantha Carter, who currently
leads the conference in assists per
game (13.35) and could become the
first freshman to ever end the season
leading the Pac-10 in that category.
Stanford has a strong freshman of its
own in outside hitter Kristin
Richards, who has a double-double in
four of the last six conference match
es.
Stanford will also be looking for a
strong performance from Harvey,
who currently leads the nation in
blocking and has helped Stanford to a
5-1 record in every match where she
has at least seven blocks. She is aver
aging 1.76 blocks per game and is hit
ting with a .401 percentage.
"The key to this match for us is
going to be defending their different
options and picking up on the major
things that they are doing well in the
match," Harvey said. "As the game
goes on, we'll have to see their ten
dencies and work to shut them
down."
Game time is set for 3 p.m. on Sat
urdav at Haas Pavilion in Berkeley.
