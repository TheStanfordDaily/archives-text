# Card heads to desert
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
This weekend the Stanford women's soccer
team (5-5-1) will open up Pacific 10 Confer
ence play in the heat of Arizona's desert, tak
ing on Aiizona (4-5-1) and Arizona State (6-2-
2).
The Cardinal is hoping to bounce back after
two consecutive losses that came at the hands
of No. 19 Santa Clara (6-3-3) and unranked
Loyola Marymount (7-2-3).
Throughout the season, Stanford has been
unable to execute consistently on offensive.
While the Cardinal has been able to create
goal-scoring opportunities, finishing has been
a constant problem for the squad.
In fact, last weekend, the Cardinal outshot
Loyola Marymount 8-1 in the opening period,
but still went into the half trailing 1-0.
"We have been working on finishing in
front of the goal all week," Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "Hopefully things
will come together this weekend. We really
need these wins."
In tonight's Pac-10 opener, the Cardinal
will face the Wildcats and their potentially
dangerous offense in Tucson.
Arizona is led by sophomore midfielder
Mallory Miller, who has netted five goals and
added two assists.
While Miller tops the 'Cats points list, she is
closely followed by 2002 Pac-10 Honorable
Mention junior forward Candice Wilks, an ex
tremely athletic player capable of giving the
Cardinal defense even more trouble.
Wilks has found the net four times and
added an assist, but has missed two matches
due to numerous injuries that she has been bat
tling since last spring. A healthy Wilks will un
doubtedly keep the Cardinal defense plenty
busy.
Defensively, Arizona has shown some
weakness and has been plagued by inconsis
tent play in goal. Redshirt sophomore Natalie
Juarez and junior Krystal Werges have been
sharing time with Juarez getting the majority
of the minutes. However, she was lifted just
after the half in the Wildcats's recent loss to
San Diego.
No matter who winds up in the opposing

goal, the Cardinal hopes to get its offense back
on track in Arizona.
"We want to be more aggressive than usual
against Arizona," Ratcliffe said. "In addition
to finishing, we've been concentrating on exe
cuting a possession game that should put addi
tional pressure on [the Wildcat] defense."
Sunday's matchup at Sun Devil Soccer Sta
dium could prove to be even more challenging
for the Cardinal.
Arizona State fields a young team that did
not lose any starters to graduation or injury in
the past year. This is in stark contrast to a Car
dinal team that lost two of its top offensive
players to graduation in Marcia Wallis and
Callie Withers, in addition to losing forward
Marcie Ward to a season-ending foot injury.
Stanford will change their game plan slight
ly heading into Sunday's game against the Sun
Devils.
"We will have to be a bit more conservative
against Arizona State," Ratcliffe said. "I think
they have a little more talent [than Arizona],
but really, both matches are going to be
tough."
Arizona State has showcased a balanced of
fense and defense. The Sun Devils have five
shutout wins and have scored three or more
goals in a game on four separate occasions.
The Sun Devils offense has yet to be shutout
this season.
However, Arizona State has not been con
sistently tested this year. The team's only
match against a ranked-opponent came at the
very beginning of the season and was also the
Sun Devils's worst loss.
By contrast, the Cardinal has faced four
ranked teams, and although it came away with
a 0-3-1 record, each match was extremely tight.
Stanford's tie happened to come against
ASU's only ranked opponent, No. 2 Notre
Dame.
While the Cardinal is facing two tough con
ference opponents on the road at a critical
point in its season, leaving Arizona with two
wins is not out of the question.
"The starting lineups finally have pretty
much been solidified," Ratcliffe said. "That
helps things out as we are finally getting some
continuity. We just need the offense to exe
cute."
