# Field hockey ready for Bears

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR 
They have faced a No. 16 team, a
No. 10 team, and a No. 9 team. They
have faced rivals and they have gone
into a conference matchup with a five
game losing skid.
But in terms of difficulty, this Satur
day's match against No. 17 California
(5-2, 4-0) may be one of the toughest
games for the Stanford field hockey
team (3-9,1-1) yet.
"It's hard, but in a different way
than the other teams, because it's al
ways hard against Cal, whether we're
ranked or they're ranked," said senior
goalkeeper Emily Zander.
Stanford has had a tough schedule
this year, having to face teams like
Michigan State and Connecticut. Nine
of the twelve teams it has faced so far
have been ranked in the top-20.
The Cardinal has endured tough
losses in which it could have taken the
lead or tied the game. It has gone
through small bumps, the most recent
being a three-game losing streak that
includes back-to-back shutouts, and
larger ones, such as its five-game losing
skid earlier this year.
So the Cardinal heads into Bear ter
ritory this Saturday for the final game of
its four-game road trip with a little
weight on its shoulders.
"It's a lot harder mentally because
there's so much pressure," Zander said.
Add on top of that the fact that it is
facing a Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference opponent, an old rival, and a
team that Stanford has gone into over
time in its last three matches and the
Cardinal has a lot to deal with this
weekend.
"I definitely think it's hard just be
cause both teams really get up for [the
game]," said senior co-captain Noor
Dawood.
Despite the tough schedule, Stan
ford is excited about Saturday's game.
"I think it's actually a really good

thing for us because it's after a road trip
that was a little hard on our confidence.
It's never hard to get up the energy and
excitement for the Cal game, so I think
it's going to be a really good thing for
us," Dawood said.
Cal has won six straight against
Stanford, including a 4-3 overtime
thriller earlier this season, but most of
the matches have been very close.
"Both teams are competitive with
one another and we both know each
other very well so it's a well matched
game," said Stanford head coach Leslie
Irvine.
Stanford lost 2-1 in overtime to Cal
twice last season in games that decided
the NorPac Western Division and the
NorPac Championship.
"[Overtime] is really frustrating,"
sophomore Lyndsay Erickson said.
"You're so close to the win and to lose
in sudden death and have just one small
play end the game is the most frustrat

ing ever. But this time we're not going
to go into overtime. We can beat them
in [regulation]."
To win, Stanford will have to con
tain the NorPac offensive player of the
week, senior midfielder Nora Fedder
sen, who just became the all-time lead
ing scorer in Cal history, and NorPac
rookie of the week, freshman forward
Valentina Godfrid.
The Cardinal's points leaders, Er
ickson (13) and freshman midfielder
Cara-Lynn Lopresti (12), hope to be
the ones finding the net Saturday.
In the midst of it all, Stanford is
trying to spoil Cal's hopes of clinching
the NorPac Western Pacific title this
season.
"We plan on spoiling it by winning
the game," Irvine laughed. "But we
also have other goals in terms of hope
fully going into postseason play, so we
certainly look beyond the Cal game.
But it would be nice to take the win."
