### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Game after game this season, the Stanford
men's soccer squad (2-6-2) has unveiled a new
formation style, an altered strategy, or a shuffled
lineup in hopes of finding its footing with its de
veloping team.
In this weekend's matches against Oregon
State (7-4-0) and No. 8 Washington (7-1-1), the
Cardinal will continue to experiment with jum
bled lineups only this time it's not by choice,
and will create more challenges on the field than
stability.
Senior co-captain and defender Mike Wilson
will be absent from Stanford's starting ten for
the first time this season, as he is in Tehran, Iran
competing with the New Zealand national
team.
The team has also suffered several injuries
this week, which render a couple of other key
players' status in question for Friday night's
game.
According to junior forward Darren Fer
nandez, the lineup will likely be forced to move
into a 4-4-2 formation for the weekend's con
tests.
"We've got a lot of talent," Fernandez said.
"But everyone on the team is going to have to step
up [this weekend]."
Despite the fact that more than one starter

could be missing from the field Friday night, one
vital starter will be making his comeback.
Junior goalkeeper Robby Fulton, who has
been on the Cardinal sidelines since mid-Septem
ber with a quad injury is, according to head coach
Bret Simon, "probable" to start against OSU on
Friday.
Fulton, who last season had the lowest goals
against average in the country, will replace
freshman Andrew Kartunen, who proved a
force between the posts during his six-game, 31-
save stint as Stanford's starting goalkeeper.
But whether Stanford, which is coming off a 3-
1 loss at Berkeley last Sunday, can pull together a
fluid lineup or not, its opponents will not be easily
contained.
"[The Beavers] have a lot of the same players
back from last year," Simon said. "They are very
aggressive; they have a very direct attack style."
Simon expects a "territorial game" in which
OSU will use its contingent of gifted strikers to
keep the ball in its top half for the majority of the
game.
Oregon State currently leads the Pacific 10
Conference in team points, shots, and goals, and
four of its players rank among the ten highest scor
ers in the conference.
The Beavers also boast a major offensive
threat in senior Alan Gordon, who was the top
scorerin the Pac-10 last season.
Despite the daunting stats on this year's OSU

squad, the team is 1-14-2 all-time against Stan
ford, and has never bested the Cardinal on its
home turf.
Sunday's game with the Huskies will present
just as formidable a challenge, as the team has
dropped only one matchup this season - a 1-0
loss to defending champion UCLA.
Though Washington suffered a losing season
last year, the team remained in the top-40 due to
the depth and skill of its athletes.
Washington has not lost a step in working
that talent into a top-ten competitor, and given
that the Huskies are 14-14 in all-time meetings
with the Cardinal, spectators should expect a
relentless 90-minute battle on the field.
Fernandez said that the key to winning this
weekend lies on both sides of the Stanford squad.
"The offense has got to pick it up and get
some more goals, and the defense has to hold as
well," he said. "We've been scoring goals and
then we've all been sitting back and taking it
easy while the other team [scores on us].''
Simon believes that maintaining strong team
chemistry despite the lineup switches will also be
a crucial factor for his squad.
"It's going to be important to stick together as
a team and keep improving," he said.
The Beavers meet Stanford Friday at 7 p.m.
and Washington rolls in on Sunday for a 1 p.m.
kickoff. Both contests will take place at Maloney
Field.
