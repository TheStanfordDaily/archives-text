# ASSU bookshare service initiated
## 
### BARRETT SHERID AN STAFF WRITER 
Students tired of saving only
$l5 on an already-owned textbook
at the Stanford Bookstore or pur
chasing books days in advance to
grab a rare used copy can rest as
sured that their student represen
tatives feel their pain.
The ASSU is set to begin a text
book trading service this winter with
a buy-back program that will pay stu
dents cash for their used books, ac
cording to ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli. Though plans are being
finalized, funding has not been se
cured, and the program's existence is
not yet guaranteed.
The goal of the program is to
"be able to buy books back from
students at a rate that's better than
what's offered on campus" at the
bookstore, Natoli said.
"That's friggin' awesome," said
sophomore Matt Branham. "It
shows the ASSU is looking out for
students and it obviously makes
complete sense, because by taking
out the middleman they're saving
students a whole bunch of
money."
On Dec. 10-12, the ASSU will
erect a tent in White Plaza where
students can sell their old, un
wanted books to the ASSU for
cash. For now, the buy-back pro
gram will only take books from a
few courses.
"Our thought is, let's focus on
four or five classes that are offered
very often, typically have the same
book and are very large," Natoli
said. "If we can concentrate on a
quarter of the kids in those classes
or a fifth of the kids in those class
es, we could offer them those
books at a real-world rate."
The discrepancy between the
real-world rate for used books and
what Stanford charges for them is
greater than that for new text
books, he said.
"They're a for-profit business,"
Natoli said of the Bookstore.
"They have infrastructure costs.

They have logistical costs. They're
part of a gigantic conglomerate.
They may have deals with publish
ers requiring them to sell X num
ber of used books and Y number
of new books."
The ASSU program, tentative
ly called the ASSU Book Service,
will operate as a not-for-profit or
ganization, according to Natoli,
and will act as middleman be
tween buyers and sellers, keeping
only a small amount of the rev
enue in order to recoup labor
costs.
The books purchased this De
cember will be re-sold to students
at the beginning of winter quarter
in a similar manner.
No decision has been made on a
return policy yet.
This is just the latest in a string
of efforts by students to solve the
problem of overpriced used books
on campus.
"In the past 10 years, there
have been student groups who
have attempted this, but due to a
variety of reasons they've all
failed," Natoli said.
The last effort, by a group
called Leap Frog, stopped opera
tions "three or four years ago!;"
Natoli said.
ASSU Senate Chair Josh
Shipp, a junior, expressed his de
light in the program.
"It's a great service to students
just because the Bookstore does
have a monopoly, and if we can
even lower the cost of books to
some people, then that's a victory
in the war against rising costs,"
Shipp said.
Natoli's ultimate goal is to be
able to create a peer-to-peer net
work through which students can
exchange textbooks without the
middleman. Such an effort would
likely work through the Internet.
"Cost-of-living issues are really
salient among students," he said.
"Whether it's a quarter per load of
laundry or $lO for Internet, these
dollar issues are important for stu
dents."
