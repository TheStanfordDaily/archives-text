# Senate plans for future
## 
### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
In its first meeting of the academic year, the Faculty Senate
wasted no time yesterday in adopting a policy toward student
initiated courses, announcing a change to next year's academic
calendar and unveiling plans for a new, large-scale environmen
tal sciences initiative, not unlike Bio-X.
New Faculty Senate Chair Tom Wasow hit the ground run
ning as he led the senate through the loaded session.
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psychology and head of the
Committee on Undergraduate Standards and Policy, presented
the Senate with a report on Student Initiated Courses (SICs) and
a new policy his committee drafted last year that solves some of
the problems that the program currently faces. Among these
problems are excessive class size and limited faculty oversight of
both content and grading.
The policy defines SICs as "courses in which major instruc
tional responsibilities are assigned to students." It embraces the
principle of SICs but points out that the courses currently lack suf
ficient safeguards to ensure a high quality of instruction and grad
ing.
Senate members voiced their support for SICs, but also pre
sented problems that they hope will be solved by the adoption of
this new policy.
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts applauded the princi
ple of SICs because of the fact that it introduces students to the
rigors and responsibilities associated with teaching and primes
them for teaching positions later in life.
"[Providing students] the chance to have that responsibility
will benefit all of us down the road," he said.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman
added that "when done well [SICs] can be a transformative ex
perience."
Ruth Gelber, an associate professor of religious studies, said
she is "strongly in favor" of SICs. However, alluding to a course
that she felt had been "hijacked," she said that she wished there
were more ways to ensure that the courses will not stray from
their originally approved curricula.
"I just wish there were some mechanism for pulling the plug,"

she said. "There are times it might be crucial."
Thomas's new policy brings all SICs "under a departmental
umbrella" in other words, every SIC will need to be affiliated
with a department and have an official course number. He hopes
that having courses officially affiliated with a department will
encourage faculty members to be more responsible for the
courses they sponsor, he said.
This new requirement will put the responsibility on each de
partment to decide what criteria to use in determining what SICs
are worthy of affiliation.
Additionally, the new policy will require students to be in
good academic standing, to have an actively involved faculty
sponsor, and to go through course instruction training at the
Center for Teaching and Learning. This, the policy states, will
ensure a high quality of instruction and evaluation.
The Senate approved the policy unanimously after adopting
a couple friendly amendments.
University President John Hennessy announced a new pro
ject underway to promote research and teaching collaboration
in the field of environmental science. After the success of the
Bio-X initiative, he said, Stanford now seeks to establish a new
seed research program.
The program will comprise faculty from every one of Stan
ford's seven schools.
Hennessy estimates that the number of involved faculty will
be around 100 but said that most of these 100 members will be
existing faculty.
"This will help us build a program that is the best of any in the
country," he said. "We will affect the environment in a positive
manner."
Faculty responded favorably to this announcement, com
mending the initiative's interdisciplinary nature.
"This is excellent framework to do interdisciplinary research,"
said Andrea Goldsmith, a professor of electrical engineering, en
couraging the senate to look at the possibility for more interdepart
mental research and collaboration in future discussions.
University Provost John Etchemendy announced a change
to next year's academic calendar at yesterday afternoon's meet-
ing.
Because the first day of freshman
orientation, as originally planned,
would fall on the same day as Rosh
Hashanah, he announced that the
first day of orientation will be moved
to the following week.
This means that classes next year
will start on Monday, September 27.
This also means that fall quarter will
be three days shorter than usual.
"This is not a good solution,"
Etchemendy said. "But it's the best
solution. This is a one-time change."
Ordinarily when there are reli
gious conflicts with the academic cal
endar, he said, "appropriate accom
modations" can be made, but for the
first day of freshman orientation,
there were no acceptable alterna
tives.
