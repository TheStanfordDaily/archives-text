# Student hacks Arizona's computer network

### TY YOUNG ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT 
(U-WIRE) - University of Arizona officials caught a
student hacking into the University's Integrated Learn
ing Center computer network Friday, gaining access to
passwords and e-mail accounts of all those using com
puters in the center.
The student was using a software program on his lap
top to search the network for computers in use. In so
doing, he had access to all information on the ILC net
work, said Mike Bernardo, a senior support systems an
alyst at the U of A ILC.
The student's unauthorized software program shut
down the network, alerting Center for Computing and
Information Technology workers and library officials
that there was a problem.
When school security officials arrived, the student
was still at his laptop, illegally accessing the server,
Bernardo said.
Library and CCIT staff members confiscated the lap
top and held the student in a meeting room. It was there
that the student admitted to using the illegal software
that shut down the network, Bernardo added.
Bernardo was one of the staff members who walked
in on the student.
"He was very calm when we caught him," he said.
"We took him to another room and he explained what he
was doing."
The student did not say why he was accessing the serv
er and did not admit to anything more than "snooping."
The University of Aizona Police Department was
called in to take the student into custody. No charges
have been filed because the police computer forensics
department needs to continue their investigation of the
student's laptop.
UAPD spokesman Sgt. Eugene Mejia said there is
nothing to substantiate any claims until police discover
the intentions of the student. Police are only saying that
the student was using illegal software that crashed the
ILC system.
"We don't know if this was something intentional on
his part or whether it was part of the software that he was
using," he said. "He was accessing the information and
did not have the right to do so."
Because the investigation is ongoing, the student's
name is being withheld.
This is the fourth time in the past month that UA net
works have crashed in this fashion.
"While investigating these outages, we found this very

strange activity in regards to Ethernet addresses and IP
addresses on our network," said Ted Frohling, manager of
the U of A Security Incident Response Team.
Frohling was working at CCIT when the call came in
from ILC staff Friday. He said the police were called be
cause the activity was very suspicious and had the same
signs of the previous network shutdowns.
"Typically, UAPD is not called unless there is some
thing very egregious going on," he said. "This was some
thing that was very egregious."
In all four cases, the people accessing the servers were
using IP addresses on campus. While there is a firewall
set up to protect the UA servers, those responsible were
already on the safe side and not denied access.
The software that the student was using, according to
Frohling and Bernardo, was designed to allow the per
son using it to scour the network to gain access to files in
other computers. The person would have access to peo
ple's open e-mail accounts, along with the passwords
they had been using.
Software like this is readily available on the Internet,
giving people the opportunity to steal encrypted infor
mation, Frohling said.
"It doesn't take a lot of expertise to use it," he said.
"But [the software] does need some expertise to use it
correctly."
Frohling said issues of network security are always a
high priority, but with the recent crashes caused by out
side individuals, CCIT may increase its efforts to stop
them.
In the past, CCIT network administrators have wait
ed for networks to crash before responding. Frohling
said that will soon change.
"We'll try to be more vigilant about things like this
and be a little more proactive, looking for signatures of
this activity."
But as CCIT looks to improve security, it is faced with
the reality that there are few preventative measures that
can stop expert hackers.
"If [hackers] do their job correctly, they will be unno
ticed," he said. "But typically they are not experts at
what they're doing. They leave traces."
Library network security teams will also be on the
lookout for unusual activity. Bernardo said it is unfair
that students and staff have to worry about these issues.
He added that hackers need to be stopped before inci
dents like the one on Friday become more serious.
"Hackers are constantly active and looking for vul
nerabilities to exploit," he said. "We are always looking
into ways to stop these vulnerabilities."
