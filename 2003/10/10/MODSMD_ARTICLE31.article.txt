### MOLLY BORGSTROM MICHELLE DIAMENT THE DAILY CARDINAL 
(U-WIRE) - Brant Thunder
cloud, a University of Wisconsin-
Madison freshman accused of
stabbing a fellow student on Sept.
13, could receive two years of pro
bation and have his record ex
punged under a plea agreement,
the district attorney's office said
Wednesday.
Thundercloud, 18, was charged
Sept. 16 with a felony count of neg
ligent operation or handling of a
dangerous weapon. He waived his
right to a preliminary hearing in
court Wednesday and plead not
guilty to the charge.
By doing so, Thundercloud

opened the door to accept the dis
trict attorney's offer of a plea bar
gain.
Thundercloud's charge will be
reduced from a felony to a misde
meanor if he pleads guilty or no
contest to the lesser charge of bat
tery by use of a dangerous weapon,
according to Doug McLean, the as
sistant district attorney prosecut
ing the case.
If he successfully completes the
two years' probation, the misde
meanor charge will be expunged
from his record, McLean said.
Thundercloud's attorney,
Laura Arbuckle, called the offer "a
very reasonable resolution," and
added her client is considering it.
"Any time you can have a client
escape a conviction that will last

with him a lifetime, absolutely it's
beneficial," Arbuckle said.
Before she and her client can
decide to accept the offer, she will
need to review the police reports
on the case, Arbuckle said. Those
reports are never made available to
attorneys until the preliminary
hearing, according to Arbuckle.
The felony charge carries a pun
ishment of up to a $lO,OOO fine and
three-and-a-half years in prison if
convicted.
Thundercloud is accused of cutting
a two-inch gash into the arm of
UW-Madison freshman Christo
pher 801 l during a confrontation
with him and UW-Madison fresh
man Andrew Woolley. 801 l need
ed eight stitches, according to the
criminal complaint.
