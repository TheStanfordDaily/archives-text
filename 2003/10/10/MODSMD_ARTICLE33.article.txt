## Full Mooners Kiss & Tell 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS HELEN KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
A freshman man clad in spandex shorts and a dark
green toga flexed his arms, while showing off rows of tal
lies representing women he had kissed at last night's Full
Moon on the Quad.
"I've had mono already, so I'm inoculated," said
freshman Ben said, claiming that he had already locked
lips with 35 lucky ladies. "I'm not from California, so this
is a new thing [to me] and I wanted to take [part in it]."
Full Moon on the Quad, an honored Stanford tradi
tion, drew swarms of people ranging from sketchy grad
uate students, starry-eyed freshmen, sweaty naked
streakers and cross-dressers. Originally intended for se
nior men to initiate freshmen women into the Stanford
community, Full Moon has evolved over the years into
what some may term an orgy of epic proportions.
"It's an event; a tradition," said freshman Sam, who
participated in this year's Queer Moon on the Quad.
"I'm always tied down [with things to do]. It's a fun event
and I get to meet people. Not all kisses are serious
sometimes. I'm never going to be able to do this again, so
why not go for it now?"
Sam, boyfriend of renowned Daily sex columnist
Vinni Intersimone, claimed that he had kissed 26 men, as
the two had made an agreement beforehand that they
could make an exception and kiss others only last night.
While many people expect the event to be nothing but
orgasmic, most students who attended chose to roam
around the quad without participating in slimy deep
throated tongue battles.
"You can tell everyone wants to make out, but are just
walking around confused," said freshman Leah Sawyer.
Toward the outskirts of the crowds of people on the
quad, a Listerine table and a table full of condoms stood
to protect and disinfect students who may give into their
animal instincts.
Stanford's mascot, the Tree, could be found frequent
ly rinsing his mouth with Listerine in between kisses. By
12:05 a.m., the tree, a.k.a. junior Will Rothacker, had al
ready smooched 50 women in an effort to break the
record of former tree Chuck's 645 kisses. Going high
tech, he plans to record the number of people he kissed
with a hand-held counter device.
When asked what he did to prepare last night's festiv
ities, Rothacker said, "Antibiotics are only the beginning
... try vitamins, ginseng, 151, wheat grass, nehgahpleze
(special tree drink) and a load of 'immunity boost' from
Jamba Juice. To prepare for the quest, I have been train
ing on the ancient battlegrounds of various freshmen fe
males along with a highly flammable and easily inflatable
friend."

Not all students were there to spread the love so gen
erously and chose to fly only with their regular co-pilot.
Many couples attended the event to share romantic kiss
es with only each other.
Seniors Colby and Leslie, who said they are in a rela
tionship, took a break from locking lips to say that they
"just came here to chill."
Other couples had a different agenda, namely to
watch over freshmen that they had taken under their
wings since they arrived on campus last month.
Sophomores Rick and Ashley said that although they
are in a relationship, they were not going to kiss each
other. They went to Full Moon on the Quad "because a
lot of [their] friends are freshmen and want to watch
[their freshmen friends]."
While many people who attended last night's events
were definitely strange, the main quad was also trod
upon by strangers.
Sadath, a senior from the University of Redlands, said
that he has a lot of friends who attend Stanford and de
cided to take part in the Stanford tradition as a senior.
The first time he participated in Queer Moon on the
Quad, he was a freshman, but now returned this year as
a senior making the tradition his own.
Some students were very adamant about adhering to
the spirit of the tradition.
Junior Josh Childress said that he had not kissed any

one yet and does not plan on it.
"I kind of want to wait until next year when I become
a senior," he said. "Even if the girl is really attractive, I'd
merely consider it."
While many students stated tradition as a reason for
their participation in Full Moon on the Quad, freshman
Dan said that the probability of his kissing someone "de
pends on whether [he feels] up to it at the moment."
Yet other students were spirited enough to cross dress
for fun.
Junior Greg Eastman, a staff member in West Lagu
nita, was running around in a tight sparkly purple dress
with a stuffed bra.

"Our staff members decided to dress formally for Full
Moon on the Quad, and I decided to dress like this,"
Eastman said.
This year's Full Moon was not tongue-twisting fun for
all who attended. Two fire trucks and an ambulance
pulled up behind Memorial Church around 12:30 a.m. to
pick up at least one student who appeared to have suffered
from severe alcohol poisoning. Administrators Nanci
Howe and Morris Graves were also present at the scene.
"They had to report to an emergency call," said a
Stanford security officer on the scene. "They're taking
care of her."
On one side of the main quad, shattered alcohol bot

ties covered the ground and posed a possible health
threat to the naked streakers padding around barefoot.
Crowds of students appeared visibly drunk and
clouds of pot smoke hung thick in the air. This behavior
flies in the face of the University's recent crackdown on
Stanford's drinking and party culture.
On a lighter note, the Tree has a message for all the
foxy females who shook the Tree's leaves.
"Yes, this is to THE girl I kissed last night: Baby, it
might seem like I kissed other girls last night, but I
didn't," Rothacker said. "I remember you because
you're special... I just faked it with everyone else. I
want to get to know you better.

Full Moon on the Quad was held last night on, well, the quad. Students gathered in spandex, drag and sometimes, nothing at all to smooch under the nearly full moon as
part of one of Stanford's most celebrated traditions.

Many students appeared to have had too much to drink at last night's festivities. Palo Alto Fire personnel were on the
scene, as well as Stanford security officers and key administrators Morris Graves and Nanci Howe.

A few minutes before 1 a.m., two fire trucks and an ambulance arrived behind Memorial Church to attend to a female,
who, according to a passerby, was suffering from alcohol poisoning.
