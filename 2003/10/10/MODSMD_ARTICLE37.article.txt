# Ninjas kick-start Intermission
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
On the eve of the deadline of our last issue, the editor in chief asked my co-editor (partner
in crime?) Karan and I had planned for the week. We looked at each other blankly until finally
I shouted, "It's a secret!" We clearly had no idea.
Later that night, much much later, to be more specific, I e-mailed Karan with a brilliant idea:
"Let's write about NINJAS!!"
While most sane people would dismiss this as an insanely stupid idea, at 2 a.m., Karan wrote
back, "That is a REALLY REALLY GOOD idea. We can TOTALLY be politically incorrect
and refer to all martial artists as being NINJAS."
We love capital letters.
After some preliminary investigatory work, a few hours of internet surfing, and more cups of
coffee than should occupy any one person's diet, we discovered a number of fascinating thmgs.
One, therealultimatepower web site. Wow, this is a site to behold. Two,
http://www.jefflindsay.com/Ninja.html. I'm still not really sure if this is real or not, but I am so get
ting my next pizza delivered by a real live ninja. Three, ninjas are cool! I then took off in search
of some real live ninjas.
I decided to consult my fiesty blonde kick-boxing instructor, Michele Mandell, who used to
study with Larry Lamb. Yes, the same Larry Lamb wno trained the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Tur
tles" themselves. Having learned tae kwon do and wushu from Mr. Lamb, I figured she was a
good source to ask about the ninja phenomenon:
Me: "Do ninjas still exist, like, are the Ninja Turtles real?"
Michele: "I don't know if ninjas still exist. There might be some in China."

Me: ( hmmmm ) "Do you know any personal ninjas?"
Michele: "No. I don't know any personal ninjas."
It looked like finding ninjas was going to be harder than I had imagined.
Downtrodden, I wondered what a ninja would do in this situation. He would definitely look
up a childhood idol, Cartoon Network's "Hong Kong Phooey," on the Web. Though only 16
episodes were produced of this cartoon, it is undoubtedly a classic in its own time (that time being
the 19705). What other show taught children to do moves like the "Rice Paddy Flying Dragon
kick," the "Number Five Special" or the "Fortune Cookie Flip Flop"? Though the Web site fea
tured a safety warning, I found that I could request the "The Hong Kong Book of Kung Fu" (
"Phooey's indispensable crime fighting bible"), or if I was really lucky, sign up to attend the Hong
Kong School of Kung Fu. Wow, that Hanna Barbera thought of everything!
So, once again, we at Intermission are bringing you the best coverage of what's cool, what's
hip and what's the next big thing (hot female ninjas are IN, people. Especially in "Kill Bill").
While it may seem like an easy job, it's decidedly harder than it looks. Each week we wade
through endless amounts of trash (CDs by groups like "Watch Them Die," and "Spirituals ...
the Best of Spain," books about linear programming, and invitations to the San Jose Museum of
Quilts) to bring you the best in art and entertainment news, gossip, and frivolity.
Intermission knows that its readers demand content of the highest quality, which is why we
don't waste our time covering conspiracy theories (Are Arnold and Stanford's serial groper one
in the same?), or "True Hollywood Story"-type fare (such as "The return of Darryl Hannah,"
whose last and perhaps only great movie was "Splash").
Instead, we agree with Madonna, prolific author, when she says, "everybody is kung-fu
fighting!!"
