# 'Mystic River' flows like fine wine
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
"When my daughter married you," a crusty
father-in-law tells Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn),
"I knew she got an old-school man." You know
the type: He might not know much about fore
play, and he might not want to hold you after
ward, but in between he'll get the job done right.
"Mystic River," directed by the very

old-school Clint Eastwood,
is a little like a night
with such a man.

Not to deceive
you: This is not a
sexy movie. In fact,
sex very bad sex
—is what starts up
the huge machine of
tragedy the film be
comes.

Three boys are
playing in the blue-collar Boston suburb of East
Buckingham when one is kidnapped and sexu
ally abused. The memory of this event simmers
in the boys' minds for 25 years until, following
the death of one of their daughters, it boils over.
The bereaved father is Jimmy, and his boy
hood buddies are .(Kevin Bacon, whose

presence for once does more than lower the cast's
Bacon numbers), and Dave (Tim Robbins). Sean
is the cop assigned to the case, and Dave the
long-ago kidnap victim is the family friend
who helps the Markums with their loss.
Or is he? Robbins's every move marks him as
a haunted man, and his increasingly strange be
havior leads his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Hard

en) to suspect he's hiding something.
All this is laid out a bit clumsily a subplot
involving Sean's estranged wife seems particu
larly tacked on. Eastwood sets his characters up
for disaster with little regard for grace or subtle
ty, and I worried that the rest of the film would
show a similar ham-handedness. Then he
grabbed me by the guts.
In its second act, "Mystic River" manages to
become both thrilling and character-driven. We
get all the titillation of a good mystery that
white-knuckle feeling of impending doom, fol
lowed by shock as the twists start piling up. And,
as though we weren't gripping our seats tightly
enough, Eastwood thrusts us up close to each of
his people, making us care more about them
than seems entirely safe.
Harden is wonderfully terrified as Celeste,
her stumbling gait and halting speech revealing
the paralyzing effect of her suspicion. When
Sean interrogates her, the camera corners her
like an animal.
Perm's Markum visibly struggles with the
warring impulses of decency and rage. I couldn't
take my eyes off that face, ugly in the way only a
movie star can be, twisting through tears and
anger before falling slack in despair. Robbins's
doughy mug, by contrast, is just right for a man
still trembling with a little boy's fear.
When that fear begins to take over, the film
threatens to go over the top. But it doesn't,
largely due to the leavening effect of Sean's part
ner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne).
After a wacked-out performance in "The
Matrix Reloaded," Fishburne is back in top
form here. Only a master could make the line
"You better go check" bitingly funny. Fishburne

cuts Whitey's bad-cop cynicism with a roguish
ness that lifts the film from despair; if he can still
joke, there's hope for the rest of us.
This hope for human nature gives "Mystic
River" its punch. We recoil when the charac
ters do evil because we know they're capable
of doing good. Jimmy sums up the central
tragedy of the film in a remark about Dave's
boyhood disaster it could all so easily have

been different.
"Mystic River's" biggest problem is its run
time, about 10 minutes too long. My advice:
Don't pay too much attention to the final scenes.
Endings are overrated; you don't always need to
be held. Sometimes, you need to reel in shock
for a while, feel the blood scouring out your
veins. The Greeks called that feeling catharsis.
And the Greeks were nothing if not old-school.
