# 'Intolerable' dishes out divine cruelty
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
When a famous TV producer (Geoffery Rush) en
ters his rustic hillside mansion to find his wife screwing
around with the pool supply salesman, we know we
can only be in Los Angeles. And after a tussle involv
ing a handgun and a very pointy life-time achievement
award, a lawsuit is bound to follow.
So begins "Intolerable Cruelty" by the Coen broth
ers (the geniuses behind "Fargo" and "The Big

Lebowski"), a comical look at the world
of rich lawyers, richer divorcees and a lot <
of pre-nuptial agreements.
Miles Massey (George Clooney) is an
incredibly debonair, smooth-talking,
dental hygiene-obsessed man who's also
a highly crooked lawyer. He is good at

what he does, very good, very successful
and very... bored —as he proclaims to
a confidant, "You don't decide to be-

come bored, it just happens." Miles has
attained almost everything he could professionally hope
for, and it seems like there are no challenges left, until he
meets Marilyn (Catherine Zeta-Jones, a woman so gor
geous that she literally glows on screen, and has the most
perfect eyebrows known to mankind).
After hiring the mildly annoying Gus (Cedric the En
tertainer) to catch her husband cheating, Marilyn takes
him to court for his infidelity. Miles represents Rex,
Marilyn's husband, and though it would seem that Rex
has a losing case, Miles, armed with an incomparable
swagger and knack for witty repartee, is not to be un
derestimated.

After Marilyn is brutally rebuffed in her case against
her infidel husband, she seeks the ultimate revenge to
get back at the lawyer who cheated her at her own game.
She is suave, sophisticated,and unshakable. The phrase
"never let them see you sweat" is undoubtedly her inner

mantra, as she tackles Miles with her schemes. Both
Miles and Marilyn seem to be looking for a challenge,
and, in finding each other, they have finally met their
match.

Clooney and Zeta-Jones play their characters to a tee
with unfailing delivery. The Coen brothers use "In
tolerable Cruelty" to paint very vivid pictures. They do
a fabulous job of setting things up and giving the viewers
clues at to what they have in store, but not showing their

entire deck of cards. They center the film
around anticipation, strong characterization,
a few sexual jokes and a lot of paper-eating.

The vibe is the wacky and off-beat.

"Intolerable Cruelty" does a great
job of really getting the viewer involved with
the characters. While Miles and Marilyn
have dinner, we see their relationship bloom
with a short interaction flanked by impecca
ble banter and small bits of poetry. The
Coens come up with the most random little

jokes with which-to spice up their pictures,
and insert clever plays on words deserving of
the highest appreciation. As rapper Eve says, "love for
my wordplay / that's hard to find," but in a Coen broth
ers' picture, you've got to love it.
"Intolerable Cruelty" is highly successful because it
takes itself seriously, but with an intelligent sense of
humor. It is in itself a sort of farce, making fun of
lawyers (asking the totally original question —can
they ever really be trusted?), while at the same time
questioning the valor of "true love." The movie works
extremely well because the plot thickens, there are
more twists and turns than one might expect, and it
fluctuates between anticipated events and horribly
surprising ones. By the end of the movie we are not
quite sure what to expect, but what unfolds is an end
ing that beautifully ties everything back together in a
highly entertaining and extremely satisfying way.
Clooney and Zeta-Jones have never looked so good.
