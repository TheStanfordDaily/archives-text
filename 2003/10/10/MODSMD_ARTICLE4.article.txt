# Daniel Pearl remembered through music
## 
### REBECCA LIAO 
A concert was held yesterday
evening at Memorial Church in honor
of Daniel Pearl Music Day.
The concert was planned by the De
partment of Music and the Office for
Religious Life. Remembering Daniel
Pearl's life through celebrating his love
of chamber music, faculty from the
music department performed several
classical pieces.
Daniel Pearl, Class of 1985, was kid
napped and killed in Pakistan in Feb
ruary 2002 while researching a story. A
violinist, fiddler, and mandolin player,
Pearl had a passion for music. He
joined a chamber group, band or or
chestra in every town in which he lived.
He tried to use his music to communi
cate across cultural divides.
Stanford's concert is one of over 200
concerts that will be held in 29 different
countries from Oct. 7 through Oct. 19
to commemorate the anniversary of
Daniel Pearl's birthday.
Other concert locations include Los
Angeles, Jerusalem, Paris, Shanghai,
New York, and Washington, D.C.,
among others. Artists range from in
ternationally renowned performers
such as Ravi Shankar to local musi
cians. They play a myriad of styles re
flecting Pearl's own diverse interests:
classical, bluegrass, folk, jazz, and
many others.
At Stanford's memorial, much of
the performing was done by Stanford
professors.
Prof. Jennifer Lane, accompanied
by Prof. George Barth on the piano,
opened with an excerpt entitled "We
Cannot Retrace Our Steps" from the
opera "The Mother of Us All" by Vir
gil Thomson. Prof. Mark Applebaum

followed with his contemplative, enig
matic composition "Elegy." Soloist
Livia Sohn carried the mood with her
passionate rendition of "Sink or Swim."
After the performance of "Zwei
Gesange" by Profs. Lane, Barth, and
Shiftman. The audience did not ap
plaud until several moments after the
piece concluded; audience members
said that the piece was so moving that it
took them a moment to react. "Terzet
to," performed by Profs. Geoff Nuttall
and Barry Shiftman with Sohn was sim
ilarly well-received. The last few notes
were greeted with a standing ovation.

"I really liked the first and last
pieces," said Prof. Benny Lo, who at
tended the event. "Jennifer Lane has a
wonderful voice. The music was so ex
pressive, and the [violin] trio was so ex
citing. More importantly, I learned a
lot about Daniel Pearl and how much
he loved music. It is really fantastic that
we use the same medium to give thanks
and remember him."
The Daniel Pearl Foundation, es
tablished by Pearl's friends and family,
had envisioned holding a memorial
concert in every city he had lived in.
Though unable to do so in the inaugur

al Daniel Pearl Music Day last year,
that goal has been realized successfully
this year.
"We are thrilled that this year lead
ing artists from many musical styles
and traditions are joining with us in a
clarion call for asserting the oneness of
humanity," said Prof. Judea Pearl, fa
ther of Daniel Pearl and president of
the Daniel Pearl Foundation.
"Danny's determination to spread
truth, music, and friendship around the
world strengthens our conviction that
humanity will triumph and harmony
will prevail."
