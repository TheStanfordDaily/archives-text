# Ninjas flip through comic book
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
The thing about the Wu-Tang Clan is that they're rappers with
a Kung Fu complex. But as you all know, any force as potent as
the Clan must be balanced, in the holistic scheme of things, by a
polar opposite white karate fighters with a penchant for the
word "motherfucker!" My continuous and obsessive search for
this equalizer has led me to nothing less than a comic-book, "My
New Fighting Technique is Unstoppable," where potty-mouthed
martial artists come to show off their choicest expletives and oc
casionally, badass fighting moves.
Created by David Rees, author of the cult comic book "Get

Your War On," this collection of pixilated black-and-white car
toons is certain to become the illustrated Bible of the Ninja /
Karate generation. Or at the very least, it'll encourage "white
people" to use more expletives, crucial if they are to thrive in the
21st century.
The book's cast of characters revolves around "Normal Man,"
a deadly-serious karate fighter who's out to perfect his butt-kick
ing techniques. Even Karate Snoopy (dawg!) the most dread
ed fighter in the ensemble admits: "So-called "Normal Man"
is getting to be an ABNORMAL pain in my ass!"
Once you get past this premise, however, it takes a while for
this collection's sense of humor to tighten its black belt around
you. Lines like "What the fuck! I'm stuck in permanent kicking

position!" are delicious both in and out of context, but others are
more deadpan and violent. All the characters suffer from temper
problems, which I wholeheartedly admire.
More importantly, the fighters are stark parodies of the macho
American man ready to engage in combat without reason. In
the final strip, Normal Man says: "I have a very simple fighting
style ... It is called 'Wait For Motherfuckers' style ... As soon as
someone comes by, they will learn about this style the hard way."
The same could apply to the reader.
The images Rees' uses seem like badly resized, copy-pasted
clip-art, which lends the book a charming indie-feel. And really,
how can you not pine for a world order in which the scariest char
acter is an oversize Snoopy on steroids?
