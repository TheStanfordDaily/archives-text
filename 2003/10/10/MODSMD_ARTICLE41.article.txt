### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Trying to write a review of the soundtrack to a
Quentin Tarantino movie is a lot like giving birth
to an underdeveloped fetus.
Let me explain.
The problem is that a Tarantino soundtrack,
even more so than other movie soundtracks, is in
extricably linked to the movie itself. Sound waves
are weaved, symbiotically, to light images. One is
incomplete without the other. Whereas the
soundtrack to a film like "Rushmore" can, and
does, stand on its own, the music to a film like, say,
"Pulp Fiction" takes on a reincarnated life when
backlit by the movie

Take the Stealers Wheel classic "Stuck in the
Middle With You." Upon hearing that song, how

can any "Reservoir Dogs"
veteran not immediately
think of a shuffling
sadistic Michael Mad
sen toying with his help
less torture victim? Or
will "Pulp Fiction"
acolytes ever be able to dissev-

er Dusty Springfield's "Son of a Preacher Man"
from Uma Thurman's honey voice?
The power of the "Kill Bill" soundtrack lies in
the fact that, even without having seen the film, I
know that its songs will come to evoke the same
strong associations. The ominous intro guitar riffs
on Tomoyasu Hotel's "Battle Without Honor or
Humanity" already define shots on the teaser
trailer: a 747 gliding into Tokyo, the neon lights of
a thoroughfare glinting off Uma Thurman's black
motorcycle visor, a white-clad Lucy Liu holding a

blade against a snowy backdrop.
Other songs on the disc strive for Tarantino's
goal of becoming as cinematically classic as
"Stuck in the Middle With You." Is he being pre
tentious? You bet. No one's ever accused him of
humility. But, then again, few directors today de
serve to be as cocky as he.

The opening song on the disc is "Bang Bang
(My Baby Shot Me Down)" by Nancy Sinatra. It
is the only song whose lyrics appear in the book
let (although the English translation of a Japan
ese song also appears), and no other song on the
CD fits so perfectly in the movie. With lines like
"Bang bang, my baby shot me down" and "Bang
bang, I shot you down," it feels like Sinatra wrote
the song for Tarantino's flick about the deserved
revenge of a former bride.

Other tunes, from the loose and flirty
"Grefen Hornet" by A 1 Hirt to
The RZA's deadly serious "Ode
to Oren Ishii," are reminiscent
of the eclectic music taste Taran
tino showed in his earlier films.
Listening to them without the
context of the movie, you have
no idea where they'll fit in. But
then arrives that moment in the song, maybe
the penultimate riff or the catchy chorus,
where you know just know that the song
fits snugly into Tarantino's newest genre
blending world.

For pure listenability, the soundtrack isn't
quite as good as the "Pulp Fiction" mix or, in
deed, soundtracks for non-Tarantino movies.
But to a film fan and especially to a Tarantino
fan, the soundtrack is gold, a beautiful com
mingling of cinema and sound.
