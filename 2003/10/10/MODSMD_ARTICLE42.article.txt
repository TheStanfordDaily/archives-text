# 'Kill Bill' slashed at the core
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
Yes, kids, Quentin Tarentino is back with a
new movie one that will make your heart
pound, your eyes bulge and your blood flow
freely. Too freely, perhaps. The magnum opus
in question is "Kill Bill," an homage to the
chop-socky kung-fu films that littered Tarenti
no's mindscape as an avid film viewer in his for
mative years.

Uma Thurman stars as The Bride, a woman
who on the day of her wedding was shot by a

ruthless crimelord (the Bill of the title)

and left to die at the altar. Four

years later, she rises from .
a coma with nothing other '
than revenge on her mind.
Before she can actually get
to Bill, however, she must
cross off everyone on her
ultimate Death List, which
includes a team of female
assassins known as the
Deadly Viper Squad (Vi-

vaca A. Fox, Lucy Liu and Darryl Hannah)
who were all present the day of her wedding.
Straight from the get-go, we can already see
that Tarentino is the loosest (and most self-in
dulgent) he's been in years; the opening se
quence alone includes faux retro titles, a Klin
gon quote and scores of overly helpful freeze
shot titles introducing the characters, their co
denames and any other in-jokes the Q wishes
to share with himself. On the one hand, it's
great to watch a movie directed through such
fierce vision, but with "Kill Bill" ballooning
into two films (the second part to be released in
February), a little more effort on the part of
Miramax to hold back their favorite director

would have done some good.
The truth is that 'Kill Bill" is far too self-in
dulgent, constructed around a tiny sliver of plot
(the title is all you need to know) and the sim
ple desire to see girls getting dirty and fighting
with samurai swords. If this were the work of
any other auteur I wouldn't be nearly as
miffed, but the fact that it's a Tarentino movie
heightens our sense of loss; instead of filling the
film with character quirks and punchy dia
logue, the bulk of the time is spent on crawling
slow-mo action shots and character poses that

certainly up the cool factor but also lobot
omize the narrative. The original script
clocked in at a whopping 200-plus pages,
but I have trouble believing those pages
contained anything other than effusive
! blow-by-blow descriptions of the action.
"Bill" could have easily been a single

movie affair.
But the film is far from unwatchable.
Uma Thurman turns in a superhuman
j performance, and the final fight, set in
I a Japanese tearoom / dance bar, is
J damn near wondrous â€”but that hardly

justifies the narrative vacuum. Re
venge movies may be simple, but a plot still
needs the barest of facts to have some sem
blance of story. By the end we still don't know
much of anything about the Bride's history,
nor her full relationship to Bill. And the ac
tion is cartoonishly ultraviolent, spilling and
spewing blood as tf it ran from never-ending
sprinklers. This might be due to the hallowed
history of grind house movies that Tarentino
wishes to emulate, but the beauty of "Pulp
Fiction" was in how it defused the violence of
its situations with compelling character salva
tion. "Kill Bill" has much more primitive mo
tive, and for that it suffers.
