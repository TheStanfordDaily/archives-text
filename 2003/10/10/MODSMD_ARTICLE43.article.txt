# Unclothed at Stanford
## Indie-rock cabaret 
### NICHOLAS CASEY 
Staged at the Nitery Theatre in Old Union, "James Joyce
Is Dead and So Is Paris: The Lucia Joyce Cabaret" was the
chance product of a rare collision between historical show busi
ness and indie-rock musicality. Kudos to the Pig Iron Theatre
group for the production, which is no longer playing on campus but
has relocated to the Project Artaud Theatre in San Francisco (2 p.m.
and 8 p.m., tonight and tomorrow night).
This is how it opens: You walk into the theater and the woman is
staring at you, derangedly no-doubt, in front of one of those old band
stand-style mics, her foot propped up with a stack of books. She's Lucia
Joyce ( Lu-chi-a , it's Italian), the insane daughter of the Irish James
but you don't know that yet. You're just sitting down, minding your
own business under a drooping Eiffel Tower model, trying to avoid eye
contact with the seductively 60-year-old woman walking through the
audience, passing out Kool-Aid, sporting her underthings.
And ladies and gentlemen, if you've made it to your seat, you're in
for a lot more than elderly lingerie. This is the biographical play about
James Joyce's daughter who history might rather have swept under
the rug. She was 29 when she was sent to the bin in a straight jacket,
and all she wanted to do was be a cabaret singer. Jacketed or not, she
now serenades you at that old-school microphone with her latest rock
tunes about 1920s Italy, Samuel Beckett and, of course, straight jack
ets. Half "Cuckoo's Nest," half "Marat / Sade," it's a portrait of the
artist as a young schizophrenic.
The music, of course, is befitting. The woman is screaming. Now she
has a banjo. Now she has a banjo, is screaming and standing on the
table in front of me. I do not know if she is going to lose her balance and
fall on me and for some reason I am half hoping that she will. (Hubba
hubba.) Pig Iron has an ear for the music of insanity, and on this alone,
we, the audience, are sold. This is, in its purest form, an "indie-rock
cabaret" indeed, if I were to imagine such a being, in that Platonic
land of archetype; here it is, between the feel-good Broadway musical,
and Brechtian alien plays: Lucia, you are not swept under the rug.
Pig Iron emerged as a fresh new theatrical voice, from a land, Philly,
where avant-garde might often be smashed. I love you Pig Iron, but if
your insanity went a minute longer, I would have had to ask the poor
English professor in the next seat to shoot me.
