# Sanaa shares her precious 'Time'
## 
### By: ANDY MOON PAUL NAVARRO STAFF WRITERS 
Some people think that Sanaa Lathan is a ninja. Much like
Gray Davis supporters, they are wrong. Lathan appears in
the new Denzel Washington movie, "Out of Time," which
opened in theatres last Friday. The African-American ac
tress also starred opposite Omar Epps in 2000's "Love and
Basketball" and in the 2002 hit "Brown Sugar," opposite
Taye Diggs. Intermission had the opportunity to sit down
with the actress, a Berkeley graduate who currently resides in
Los Angeles. (When asked if she was a ninja, she declined to
comment.)
Intermission: So how was it to work with Denzel?
Sanaa Lathan: It was great; he lives up to what I imagined. I've
always been a fan I've always admired him as a real "actors'
actor." Just watching him on the set was like watching Michael Jor
dan in his heyday. He knows his stuff, he makes it look easy. He's ef
fortless, he's a perfectionist. And you can't help but learn by just
being in a scene with him.
INT: What drew you into acting? Was there any actor or actress
that was particularly inspiring to you?
SL: I grew up in the business; both of my parents are artists,
and I've always been around it. My earliest memories are of my
mother, [who] was on Broadway as a dancer ... [and] of being
in the wings, of the lights, the costumes, the music... you
know, I was just in it. And I've always been doing it. I think it

was just a natural career for me to go in to

INT: How do you think the movie industry is doing these days in
terms of offering roles to women, especially women of color?
SL: I think in the last couple of years, women for instance
Renee Zellweger and Nicole Kidman are getting these juicy,
character-driven roles. There was a long period when they only had
men in those kinds of roles. In terms of women of color, there is a lot
to be desired. I think that just in the terms of the amount of scripts
and the amount of films made there is a lot to be desired.
INT: Do you feel that you're a role model in the African- Amer
ican community?
SL: No, I think that it's something that's put on you. I just try and
do my work and I'm happy that people respond to it... and that's
all you can ask for...
INT: Do you have any political or social motivations?
SL: I'm involved in this organization that I'm really excited about
called "Peace Games." It's a group that goes into schools [with] a
curriculum that teaches kids K-8 about positive conflict resolution.
[lt teaches them] about self-esteem and creating a sense of pride
about their community.
It really, really works. It's in a couple of schools in Boston and a
couple of schools in LA and it has 250,000 requests to be in schools
all over the world. And I think it's really important in terms of all the
violence that is prevalent in entertainment and music; and there is
just such a high rate of child-on-child violence. So I'm just trying to
raise awareness and money about that.

INT: Do you think there is more pressure making a film because
your performance is captured and doesn't last only one night?
SL: Actually that is what I like about it! A play only [lasts] in the
minds of the people who were there. But film is forever. The thing
that excites me the most about film is my grandkids. I'll be like,
"That's your grandma isn't she cute? Look at her!" That's exciting
to me, that when I'm 80 I'll be able to show my grandkids "Out of
Time."
INT: But when you're on film you don't get the audience feed
back the way you do on stage, right?
SL: Oh, the actual experience of being on stage is like a drug.
It's like an actual chemical is released in your body. When
you're on stage you actually get to go through the journey of the
arc of the character and you have the whole audience giving
you that energy. And it's different every night because you
have a whole different group of people. That's priceless and
you can't trade that for anything. In film you do a little bit here
and it's all out of order so you never get the feel of the whole arc
of the character.
INT: For all those Stanford kids looking for a good movie week
end, what do recommend?
SL: Oh, there's so many ... the first things that comes to mind
is "Cinema Paradiso." I mean, of course "The Godfather," "So
phie's Choice," "A Woman Under the Influence," "The African
Queen," "Malcolm X." I'm not one of those people who has only
three favorites.
