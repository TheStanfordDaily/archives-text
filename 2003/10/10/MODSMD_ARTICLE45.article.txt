# Wu-Tang sticks it to the Fu's
## 
### JULIAN WASS STAFF WRITER 
Way back in the early 90s, when
all the other west coast kids and I
were freaking out over Dr. Dre's
"The Chronic" and asking each
other what exactly "Gimme That
Nutt" meant, east coast kids were
rocking Wu-Tang's "Enter the Wu-
Tang (36 Chambers)."
Seemingly a world away musical
ly and lyrically from the laid back G-
Funk that epitomized the California
sound, the Wu-Tang Clan rapped
cryptic lyrics over gritty beats. We
had so many questions. Where is
Shaolin? What are Gods and

Earths? And where is Raekwon's
"Killer Tape"? To those of us who
had just learned "G's up, Hoes
down," it all seemed rather obtuse.
Such is the way of the Wu and its
nine members... or ten if you count
Cappadonna....or 30 if you count
everyone's aliases. With 36 cham
bers, Wu-Tang Clan utilized sam
ples from both 70s soul and Kung Fu
movies.
The Kung Fu samples give the
album a conceptual feel, even
though this is far from a concept
album. If you have a lexicon, or a
Wu-loving friend who can decipher
the coded lyrics, you find that the
themes in the songs are not as
strange as you think they are; most
of the songs are about their life in
Staten Island, which they lovingly
call Shaolin. Gods and Earths are
actually just men and women, re
spectively.
The nature of the lyrics com
bined with the ambiance that RZA
created as the backdrop for this
album was difficult for many kids, as
I remember. I had a friend in high
school who said that every time his
friends played this album he got re
ally scared and asked them to turn it
off.
Eventually he overcame his fears
and grew to like it very much. I sup
pose I went through a similar expe
rience. My lack of understanding
hindered me from enjoying this
album to the fullest. I learned a lot,
though. I learned lots of new words.
I learned a lot of names. I learned
that this is a great album, one of the
best of the 90s. And I learned that it
didn't really matter where Raek
won's "Killa Tape" was after all.
