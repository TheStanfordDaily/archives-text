# Hear Dido vent in 'Life for Rent'
## 
### JENNY STINGLE 
Don't be surprised if "Life for Rent" is used as the sound
track for the next Mandy Moore movie or if it pops up as a
freebie inside Cosmo this CD offers emotional girls an
anthem for every type of boy problem. In this schizophrenic
album, Dido alternates between being dependent on men,
and being an independent woman capable of leaving her un
worthy "boys" behind.

Having just broken up with her longtime fiance, Dido's
inner turmoil about her breakup is obvious in

every track. Clearly Dido wants to be
happy being alone, yet cannot escape her ,
super-needy side which is most evident in [
her lyrics. In songs like "Don't leave'
Home," "This Land of Mine," the hidden

track after "See the Sun" and "Stoned," '
Dido disregards all feminist notions and shows how damn
much she just wants a man.

Musically Dido rarely experiments with her ethereal, lilt
ing voice or poppy ballads, making this album reminiscent
of "No Angel." Concentrating closely, I found it hard to dif
ferentiate among the tracks on this album. However, al
though she may overuse it a tad, Dido has found an equation
that works. Many of her songs are extremely catchy and her
smooth and almost aching singing is surprisingly reassuring.
The first song "White Flag," which has already been adopt
ed by radio stations, is particularly appealing. I listened to
this one while walking and was ashamed, yet intrigued, to
find a little jump in my step listening to Dido cry about how
she "will go down with this ship and... won't... surren

der." Damn straight Dido, sing it woman.
Another winner is "Stoned," which initially distin
guishes itself with thumping electronic beats reminiscent
of music played in sketchy European clubs, but then
melds into another typical Dido creation complete with
whispery vocals and a catchy, mid-tempo chorus. Dido
loses her optimism and sings about the omnipresent
theme of unrequited love. Poor Dido, so much love to give
and no one to take it.

She attempts to break the monotony in "Who Makes

You Feel" (here Dido ditches her lul
laby-like crooning for a forceful tone)
and "Sand in my Shoes" (she gets
crazy when she opens up the song
with the sound of sirens and speeds up
the tempo). Though most songs
sound the same, there are a couple

you can skip. "Mary's in India" is a very boring, droning
narrative and "See the Sun" asserts that the end of a rela
tionship is not the end of the world, yet after listening to
over an hour to the shamelessly man-hungry Dido begging
for a little love I don't believe a word she says.
Although the lack of musical experimentation and di
verse lyrical themes make this album as unimaginative as
the black-and-white CD cover of a sheepish-yet-sultry
looking Dido, if you like Dido's style and are a fan of her
new or previous singles this album is a good investment. A
mellow CD to let play in the background while doing work
or to cry along with after being abandoned by a member of
the opposite sex, "Life for Rent" definitely has its uses but
fails to be groundbreaking or exceptional.
