## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
The founding director of Stan
ford's Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Program, Laura
Selznick, has been appointed to
the brand new position of special
assistant for diversity outreach. In
her new role, Selznick will seek to
break down the barriers between
students and all of the academic
resources on campus.
Selznick's appointment by
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman was of
ficially announced at yesterday's
Faculty Senate meeting. Her di
rect affiliation with the Under
graduate Research Programs of
fice will end and her office will be
moved to the third floor of Sweet
Hall.
Selznick's departure came as a
shock to many students, who
spoke glowingly of her.
"I could not imagine a better
freshman academic advisor than
Laura Selznick," said sophomore
Chris Couvelier. "In particular,
her academic encouragement cou
pled with her position in the URO
office opened my mind to the
realm of research at Stanford, and
has inspired me to venture into
areas which otherwise would have
been far outside my zone of com
fort."
Selznick explained that al
though she will not be involved in
the daily workings of the URP, she
will still be there for advice.

"I feel like I'm becoming a
grandmother in a way to URP,"
she said. "When you're a grand
mother, it doesn't mean you care
any less about your kids. You're
not responsible for cooking din
ner, but you're always there with
the backup and the wisdom."
The new position will place
Selznick in Bravman's central
staff, with Bravman as her direct
superior. Selznick explained that
her new role is not yet clearly de
fined, leaving her room to define it
as she goes.
"It's kind of like being an am
bassador without portfolio," she
said.
Selznick said she has brain
stormed ideas, but wants to get
student feedback before she
comes up with any action.
Bravman created the job in the
late summer, after reflecting on
input from last year's Diversity
Action Council, which highlighted
issues of underrepresentation in
VPUE programs.
"I want to make sure that all of
the programs that VPUE and oth
ers have developed over the last
many years are sought after by all
of Stanford's students," he said.
Bravman said he found it easy
to create the position, even in a
time of budget cuts, as both Uni
versity President John Hennessy
and University Provost John
Etchemendy recognized the im
portance of this mission.
The position was posted in Au
gust, a search committee narrowed
down the candidates, and Bravman
selected Selznick in mid-September.
Selznick said she is looking for
ward to her new role.
"It's a new challenge," she said.
"When you do the same thing for a
while all the time, after a while,
you're ready for a change."
