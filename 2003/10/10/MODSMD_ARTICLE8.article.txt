# Graduate School of Business introduces new research newsletter
## 
### HENRY BRIDGE 
The Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness recently launched the first issue of the
StanfordKnowledgebase, a free online
newsletter devoted to new research and cur
rent events in the fields of economics, busi
ness, and public policy.
The StanfordKnowledgebase is intended
to address a more general audience than the
GSB's two preexisting publications: the
Stanford Social Innovation Review, which is
targeted at socially conscious business exec
utives and non-profit leaders; and Stanford
Business, a quarterly magazine which is ori

ented more toward alumni experiences.
"Our faculty have always supported the
development of research news articles about
selected research at the school as a way to
make the information accessible to all kinds of
readers," said Barbara Buell, director of com
munications at the GSB. "The target audience
is business practitioners, opinion leaders,
media, students and alumni. We believe that
it's a good read for people who want to think
deeply about complex business issues."
The newsletter focuses on summaries of
the latest academic research from GSB fac
ulty.
"We package the most relevant material

available in a digestible and accessible for
mat," said Cathy Castillo, editor and devel
oper of the StanfordKnowledgebase.
Among other articles, this month's edi
tion features a piece on the results of a re
search paper by Assistant Professor of
Strategic Management V. Brian Viard. His
paper concluded that a reduction of "switch
ing costs" (costs associated with changing
phone carriers, for example) in a market
leads to an overall decrease in prices. The en
tire paper is available to the public from a
link that the article provides.
A full range of multimedia content is also
available on the website. A large portion of

these resources is the GSB's original content
such as audio files of lectures, streaming videos
of guest speakers, business case studies and the
full texts of numerous research papers.
StanfordKnowledgebase also collects
thematically related media from other
sources by grouping together related articles
from other sources and linking to video clips
of news stories.
While most of the video content is avail
able to the public, only Stanford community
members can access some of the articles, due
to licensing issues.
The StanfordKnowledgebase is also the
first GSB publication to implement a sub

scription service, allowing readers to get the
newsletter delivered directly into their inbox
every month.
Graduate School of Business Dean
Robert L. Joss has a positive outlook on the
service.
"This publication helps us expand our
mission of creating ideas to deepen and ad
vance the understanding of management,
and transferring that intellectual capital to
the broader community," Joss said. "I hope
thoughtful leaders in business, government,
and the non-profit sector will benefit from
this important and free source of informa
tion."
