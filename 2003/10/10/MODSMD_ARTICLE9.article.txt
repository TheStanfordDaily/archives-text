# Norma Barzman recalls Communist witch hunts

Screenwriter and author Norma
Barzman came to the Stanford
Bookstore last night to speak about
her memoirs, "The Red and the
Blacklist" a book that The New
York Times called "noble" and Van
ity Fair billed as "raunchy."
Most of the dozen attendees at
the talk were people that lived dur
ing the times that Barzman wrote
about: the 40s, 50s and 60s. Barzman
promised a good time, saying that
the event would be "funny and sexy,
just like the book."
From Feb. 1943 to Feb. 1949,
Barzman was a "proud member" of
the Communist Party in Holly
wood. She and her husband, Ben
Barzman, were prominent screen
writers in a Hollywood era marred
by blacklists and witch hunts. After
Ben finished writing a controversial
screenplay, the two were forced

into exile in France. Though they
had intended to go there on a three
week vacation, they ended staying
for 30 years.
During that span, the Barzmans
were forced to rebuild their lives,
leaving fame and celebrity behind.
Though they were forced out of
the United States because of their
politics, as foreigners in France,
they were forced to remain apolit
ical.
"We couldn't even walk in pa
rades," Barzman said.
The 30-year exile was difficult, es
pecially for Barzman's husband,
who she says "felt awful and reject
ed. It changed his life."
Barzman told stories about her
life in Hollywood, where she lived
and worked side-by-side with figures
such as Humphrey Bogart and John
Wayne. In one tale, she talked about
when her husband worked with John
Wayne. In one light-hearted ex

change, she said, John Wayne told
her husband, "I love you, you god
damn communist." Ben Barzman
replied, "And I love you, you god
damn fascist."
In another episode of her life, a
young woman drove up to Barz
man's house and walked timidly to
ward her. After Barzman greeted
her, the young woman warned her
that there were two sheriffs at the
bottom of the hill watching everyone
that drove toward their house. Two
years later, Barzman found out that
the young woman was Marilyn Mon
roe.
Barzman classifies "The Red and
the Blacklist" not as a blacklist novel
but as a feminist novel. In her eyes, it
is about a woman who was faced
with challenges that threatened her
life and her career, and how she
managed to survive.
"It is difficult to tell why I hung in
there," she said.
