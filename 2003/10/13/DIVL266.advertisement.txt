Reagan: A Life in the Letters by Annelise Anderson, Martin Anderson, and Kiron Skinner (Skinner is unable to attend Stanford Bookstore event)
Hoover Institution fellows Skinner and the Andersons (all editors of the bestselling Reagan, in His Own Hand) use a carefully arranged and astutely annotated sampling from Reagan's lifetime of correspondence to narrate the arc of "the great
communicator" 's life. Always charming, always unassuming, always genuine, Reagan's letters tell the story of his family, his health, his Hollywood and political careers, and his evolution as a political thinker with an authority (and a charm) no other
documents can. Reagan regularly corresponded with friends, movie business colleagues, fellow politicians and conservative allies, as well as with simple fans. To William Buckley in 1984: "the Middle East is a complicated place-well not really a place, it's
more a state of mind." To Mickey Rooney, from the Oval Office, in 1985: "I'll bet you don't remember the first time we met. The year was 1937... I was new in Hollywood living in the Montecito apartments. Someone had run over a dog in the street
outside. You came in to look for a phone book so you could find the nearest veterinarian and take the d0g.... I figured this had to be a nice guy." The book includes more than 1,000 letters (some to unknowns, others to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, George
Bush Sr., Dr. Spock, Joseph Coors, Henry Kissinger and Margaret Thatcher), fewer than 25 of them previously published. Taken together, they provide remarkable and otherwise unobtainable insight into a singularly important and fascinating American
life: "Dutch" up close and personal.

Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom by Cynthia Lee
"Provocative and persuasive. In this well-written and meticulously documented book, Cynthia Lee demonstrates how the law has defined 'reasonableness' in criminal law to favor men against women, straight men against gay men, and whites against blacks.
Lee's synthesis of many seemingly different examples, with thoughtful responses to the various objections that might be raised, is legal scholarship that can make a difference in our social practices. This is a serious and compelling book that should lead to
reform." - Frank H. Wu, author of Yellow: Race in America beyond Black and White. A man murders his wife after she has admitted her infidelity: another man kills an openly gay teammate after receiving a massage; a third man, white, goes for a jog in
a "bad" neighborhood, carrying a pistol, and shoots an African American teenager who had his hands in his pockets. When brought before the criminal justice system, all three men argue that they should be found "not guilty"; the first two use the defense
of provocation, while the third argues he used his gun in self-defense. Drawing upon these and similar cases, Cynthia Lee shows how two well-established, traditional criminal law defenses - the doctrines of provocation and self-defense - enable
majority-culture defendants to justify their acts of violence. While the reasonableness requirement, inherent in both defenses, is designed to allow community input and provide greater flexibility in legal decision-making, the requirement also allows
majority-culture defendants to rely on dominant social norms, such as masculinity, heterosexuality, and race (i.e., racial stereotypes), to bolster their claims of reasonableness. At the same time, Lee examines other cases that demonstrate that the
reasonableness requirement tends to exclude the perspectives of minorities, such as heterosexual women, gays and lesbians, and persons of color.
Cynthia Lee was born and raised in the Bay Area, graduated from Stanford University and attended Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley. Additionally, she taught Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure I and 11, and Professional
Responsibility at the University of San Diego School of Law from 1993-2001. In 2001, Lee joined the lawfaculty at George Washington University School of Law where she currently teaches Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure and Professional Responsibility.

Her Husband: Hughes and Plath, Portrait of a Marriage by Diane Middlebrook
Joining the recent spate of books about Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, all of which concern the sources of their poetry and their dysfunctional marriage, Middlebrook's is sure to be the gold standard. Astutely reasoned, fluidly written and developed with
psychological acuity, the work is a sympathetically balanced assessment of two lives that flamed brighdy with the incandescent fire of creative genius. Accessing newly available materials in the Hughes archives at Emory University, Middlebrook (Anne Sexton)
offers fresh evidence of Hughes's beliefs in shamanism, psychic telepathy and the predatory instinct, and she breaks new ground in tracing the couple's interactive creative relationship, suggesting that neither would have produced his or her best poetry
without the other. She shows how Hughes's faith in mysticism not only led him to believe that his marriage to Plath was fated, but also acted as a counterweight, inspiring him to seek his muse in erotic entanglements with other women. She conjectures
that Plath, too, needed erotic aggression to release her creative impulses, demonstrating the particulars of her struggle with the conflicting demands of motherhood. And she effectively demolishes Hughes as the demon who destroyed Plath, stating that
during their marriage he displayed "a high level of tolerance toward what other people considered... antisocial, crazy... behavior ; she also writes that Plath s emotional breakdown was a recurrence of the clinical depression that occasioned her first attempt
at suicide in 1953. In the end, the book is most valuable in interpreting Hughes's sources of poetic inspiration and emotional behavior, and in providing a balanced assessment of the legacy of a troubled marriage and the works of art it engendered.

America r s New Vision: Our Leaders by Doris Lee McCoy
What if you could sit down with some of the best, most creative minds in the land and ask them to take an inventory of America: What have we accomplished? Where have we failed? How can we best prepare for the future? Whom would you include?
Gen. Colin Powell, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Steve Forbes. Entrepreneurs like J.W. Marriott... big-league business consultants Tom Peters and Ken Blanchard ... politicians such as John Glenn and Elizabeth Dole ... and personalities
like John Walsh, Quincy Jones, and Larry King? I've done just that. I've personally talked to these personalities and many more, and in my 90,000-word book AMERICA'S NEW VISION: Our Leaders Point the Way I offer the reader a wonderfully rich
stew of opinions and ideas from a host of liberals and conservatives, writers and politicians, actors and astronauts, entrepreneurs and entertainers. The tragic events of last September 11 heighten the need for this book. As American flags dot the landscape
as never before and volunteers strive selflesslv to help in any way they can.Sometimes these leaders utter off-the-cuff observations, sometimes deep and even revolutionary thoughts. Their words together provide a roadmap for the reader trying to navigate
through a maze of today's unpredictability and unrest. Nowhere, under one book cover, have so many of our distinguished leaders shared their wisdom on such a variety of topics. In effect, they preordained the structure of this book when they told me
what they see as the biggest challenges to America in addition to terrorism: change, family, education, business, spirituality, violence, ethics, environment, health, re-awakening American spirit and so on. Clearly, as the outpouring of volunteers to Ground
Zero has shown. Americans want to do something. This book will inspire that kind of charge. Not everyone can go to New York or Washington or talk one-on-one with our national figures, but they can read AMERICAS NEW VISION and feel a closer
connection to those same leaders. In short, America wants to "get healthy" again, and this book will be a strong step toward that reinvigoration. The leaden point to all manner of solutions, from the practical to the inspirational, from the oft-heard to
the outrageously individualistic. Some, like Notre Dame president-emeritus Theodore Hesburgh, suggest literally bulldozing the ghettos. Other suggestions include fostering community service, promoting a national Thank-You Day for teachers, and
hopefully, abolishing self-pits'. At the same rime, many of these leaders reveal their deepest humanity. AMERICA'S NEW VISION is practical as well as inspirational, and in wisdom is distilled from the life experiences of some of the key decision makers
of our time. It will speak to a generation of Americans who:
• need to keep abreast of trends because their livelihood depends on it.
• are struggling to make sense out of a confusing, rapidly changing world.
• are patriotic and view their leaders - business, political, and artistic with interest, curiosity, and respect.
