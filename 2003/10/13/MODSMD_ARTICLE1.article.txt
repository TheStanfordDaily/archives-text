# Grad housing plans unveiled
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Preliminary plans are under way for a new grad
uate student residence near the Law School that
would alleviate the pressing need for graduate
housing on campus.
Dean of the Law School Kathleen Sullivan said
that a major donor has expressed interest in fund
ing at least part of a graduate residence, which
would house several hundred students.
Although architectural plans have not been fi
nalized, the residence would most likely be shaped
as a quadrangle with an open courtyard and built
on the parking lots of the Law School and Stern
Hall. The projected date of completion is 2005 at
the earliest.
"If all went well, this could be the greatest con
tribution to University housing in recent years,"
Sullivan said.
A new residence would represent a significant
change for Stanford graduate students, who are
guaranteed only one year of housing on campus.
Stanford undergraduates, on the other hand, are
guaranteed four years of housing.
There are 1,200 graduate students without cam
pus housing, including a third of Stanford's 570 law
students. Living in Palo Alto, where the cost of liv
ing is astronomical, is difficult for those students,
who often have little income to spend, Sullivan
said.
The Law School began thinking of ways to re
pair that problem in 2001, when it decided that
housing for law students near classes is an impor
tant priority and came up with the idea for a new
Law School residence.
"The greatest advantage of the Law School is
the small size and close-knit community, and that's
defeated if our students are commuting long dis
tances to get to the Law School," Sullivan said.
The residence would probably also house other
graduate students, Sullivan said. Chris Griffith, as
sociate dean of graduate student life, said students
will be "thrilled" if the residence is built.
"New construction of student residences is al
ways an improvement to the quality of life," she
said. "For graduate students who work in labs, do
research and have long days of work, it's great to
be able to ride your bike across campus and be
home."
Sullivan hopes that improved campus housing
for law students will bring the University's housing
options in line with the choices at its peer institu
tions. The Law schools at Yale University, New
York University and the University of Michigan
three of Stanford Law School's competitors
all offer housing near classrooms.
"Student demand for close housing is going to
be an increasing problem in the future," Sullivan
said, pointing out that Harvard University has a
housing crunch, too. "We're trying to get to that
problem sooner than others."
Sullivan also added that more graduate housing
on campus could help cut down on the chronic traf-
fic jams on roads near campus.
"One thing this does that is very
good for campus is that if law stu
dents live next to campus, they don't
have to drive," she said. "This cuts
down radically on commutes and
traffic."
Some critics have expressed con
cern that the new residence might be
too large, take up too much space,
threaten the houses on nearby Sal
vatierra Walk or be located too close
to Stern.
Students who work in Rogers
House, which is located on Sal
vatierra Walk and houses the peer
counseling center The Bridge, said
they weren't aware of any plans for
construction that might threaten
Rogers House. However, they

called the building "historically im
portant."
Sullivan said the Law School is
taking those worries into account.
Still, the new residence would def
initely decrease parking availabil
ity near the Law School and Stern.
In part, the reason for building
the residence on a parking lot stems
from the fact that the General Use
Permit, which regulates how Stan
ford uses its land, requires that any
new housing be built on Stanford's
existing property. Because space is
so limited on campus, parking lots
have been targeted as some of the
spots that could be cleared in favor
of new housing.
Sullivan stressed that the plans
for the residence will not be final
ized for several months.
"The gift has not yet been
given," she said. "The dorm has not
yet been designed or approved.
This is all in preliminary planning
stages."
