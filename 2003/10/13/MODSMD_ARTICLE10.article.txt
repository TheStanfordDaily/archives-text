## Full Moon should not die 
### 
Last Thursday night, Stanford stu
dents partook in the Farm's age-old
tradition of Full Moon on the Quad.
For the most part, freshman and se
niors and sophomore, juniors and gradu
ate students, too enjoyed kisses under the
light of the moon. Meanwhile, the Band
played on and streakers darted across the
Quad. Planners executed a commendable
event, downplaying the importance of alco
hol by emphasizing alternatives to drinking.
But we are concerned that the University's
efforts to lessen alcohol usage across campus
may have backfired, playing a role in the two
arrests and at least four hospitalizations that
occurred early Friday morning.
In past years, alcohol has played a fairly
prominent role in the revelry of Full Moon
on the Quad. But this year, with an in
creased security presence and dorm staff
members who discouraged drinking, many
attendees agreed that there was very little
alcohol present at Full Moon on the Quad it
self. This result is partly due to planning by
coordinators.
But many if not most of Full Moon
attendees consumed alcohol before coming
to the Quad. More importantly, a number of
individuals drank excessively and put them
selves and others in danger through their
reckless behavior.
The Alcohol Policy has been the source of
great criticism on campus lately, but students
must take the responsibility upon themselves
not to engage in dangerous drinking prac
tices. If students hope for the University to
lessen its control on campus alcohol con
sumption, they should set an example by re
sponsibly conducting themselves at public
gatherings.
However, we also question if this year's in
crease in severe alcohol-related problems is
related to the University's recent campus
wide implementation of the Alcohol Policy.

Not including the arrests and hospitaliza
tions, other students were intoxicated to the
point where they needed assistance in stum
bling home. Although there may have been
less alcohol actually consumed on the Quad
this year, the number of extreme cases of
drinking seems to have drastically increased
from last year's Full Moon on the Quad.
On Friday, Assistant Dean and Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe said she had
serious reservations about Full Moon on the
Quad happening again. We hope the Univer
sity does not take action that will lead to the
death of one of Stanford's most celebrated
and revered traditions. Almost all Stanford
graduates recall their experiences of Full
Moon on the Quad with glowing pride
and while public drunkenness at the event
has escalated in recent years, canceling Full
Moon on the Quad would only sidestep larg
er issues at hand.
University officials must re-examine the
revised Alcohol Policy when deciding why
more students seem to have been hospital
ized at this year's event. While a stricter
anti-alcohol attitude probably prevented
light drinkers from consuming alcohol at
Full Moon on the Quad, such students were
never in any great risk in the first place be
cause they generally drink responsibly.
On the other hand, those who desired to
drink heavily likely continued to do so this
year but they drank behind closed doors
instead of in the open with their classmates.
The culture of drinking in private tends to
prompt more intense alcohol consumption
over a short period of time, which should be
a concern to the University.
We believe that Full Moon on the Quad
should continue as an annual event long into
the future. For this to occur, both the Uni
versity and students need to work together to
ensure that everyone involved has a safe and
responsible night.
