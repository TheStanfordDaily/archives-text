Stanford Dininaunresponsive to the
needs ofYost residents
Stanford Dining's Op-Ed ("Stan
ford Dining tries to satisfy all," Oct. 9)
attempting to explain their cost struc
ture was informative but trite. Forcing
a meal plan upon us, according to the
article, is designed to "promote intel
lectual discussion during meals." It fur
ther explains that they offer twelve dif
ferent meal plans, "Which speaks di
rectly to Stanford Dining's flexibility
and responsiveness." As Steven
Tadehs aid in his defense of Stanford
Dining ("Food for thought," Oct. 9),
let me give you a case study.
Yost's meal plan changed this year
to one with 124 points and 10 meals a
week in Yost, plus two from outside
dining halls. No meals are offered in
Yost on Friday or Saturday. Gone this
year is an open kitchen, which is the
staple of any house outside the larger
dining halls. Also gone is our own
chef, m spite of the fact that Stanford
Dining had an entire summer to fill
the position but failed to do so. This
presents a problem, as the chef in
Murray is now forced to cook for two
houses, a burden that certainly should
not be placed upon one person. To top
it off, we are not given options in meal
plans, as those in our neighboring La
gunita or Sterling Quad, but instead
are forced to pay for the highest meal
plan on campus.
What do we have at Yost to show
for this exorbitant cost? Little variety,
a Coke machine at night, cereal arid
enough points to last us six weeks, as
suming we eat on the weekends. Mr.
Tadelis also indicates that those living
in Roble may eat at Stern, FloMo,
Ricker or Lagunita. We outside the
normal dining halls cannot. If a class
ends at noon and another begins at
12:30 p.m., we have half an hour to get
back to Governor's Corner, eat and
leave again.
Stanford Dining has come to us and
asked for suggested changes. When
we respondeaTmuch of their response
rested on finding a chef to work with
us. They have not followed through.
They have failed me as a consumer,
and for that I have requested the same
flexibility offered our neighbors in
choosing where we eat and now much
we eat. Instead, thev have held to the
belief that it serves Residential Educa
tion's mission bv fostering a good en
vironment at Yost. It hasn't, and it
won't. Yost's Resident Fellow and res
idential staff have been working hard
to foster a good living environment.

which has been compromised by the
dining experience.
I am not suggesting that we be re
lieved of the Stanford Dining experi
ence. I am asking for consumer flexi
bility. Let us become eating associates
at a Row House or enter mto a meal
plan at Lagunita. Stanford Dining must
earn the right to use the slogan, 'It's all
about you." I merely ask that they
work with us.

Students speak out concerning
Moscow center's closing
On behalf of the 13 students cur
rently attending the Stanford in
Moscow program, we would like to ex
press our sincere disappointment upon
hearing of our center s closure.
While we understand the financial
constraints facing OSP and the entire
campus right now, we are also deeply
saddened by the academic and cultural
loss that will result in the absence of the
Moscow center.
Rather than argue the merits of
OSP's decision to close the program,
we would instead like to emphasize the
value that the Stanford in Moscow pro
gram has had over the past 10 years.
Many students and administrators may
not be aware of the unique opportuni
ty that Moscow provides, given its un
paralleled position in the international
system. Russia as a place is neither Eu
ropean nor Asian, but serves as a win
dow to the entire continent. It is an out
let to the Middle East with its indige
nous Muslim population (and current
ly the only program offering an Islamic
Studies focus). It is a country in the
throes of transition, and we are active
ly witnessing the birth of a state and the
resurrection of an economy after 70
years of the most fascinating national
experiment of all time.
But anvone can read about Russian
history. Thanks to the Stanford Over
seas Studies Program, we have been
able to come to Moscow and see Rus
sia through the eyes of her citizens. We
are not just visiting Moscow â€” we are
living here. Now almost a month into
our "time here, we have been chal
lenged by language and cultural barri
ers that we could never have imagined
existed. Some of us even arrived with
out any Russian language skills at all,
and the one-of-a-kind Intensive lan
guage program has helped us quickly
adapt. As Americans. Russian culture
is completely alien to our current realm

of understanding. The Stanford pro
gram has created a path to true inter
national awareness.
We can only hope that whatever
shape the program may take in the fu
ture it will be as valuable and enriching
as the current program has been for us.

Students do not pay for Arrillaga
gym facilities
While your editorial on campus
gyms ("Gym facilities should be im
proved," Oct. 10) was correct in its ulti
mate aim, its criticism of the current sit
uation at Arrillaga weight room was
greatly misguided. In the editorial, you
complain that a "sizable number" of
the equipment at Arrillaga is reserved
for varsity athletes only, and also com
plain about the gym's recreation hours.
Since one of the central points of
the editorial is the excellence of Stan
ford athletics, it is important to note
that nearly every top athletic univer
sity in the country has completely
separate training facilities for its var
sity athletes. Here at Stanford, this is
not the case, despite the fact that
and this is the crux of the issue all
of the equipment in Arrillaga weight
room (more than $1 million worth)
was paid for entirely by athletic de
partment funds.
Not one cent of any student's tu
ition money went to paying for the Ar
rillaga weight room, indeed, it is athlet
ic department revenue (largely from
football ticket sales) that paid for this
equipment. When you stipulate, "The
cost to Stanford is hign. Students
should not be forced to pay for sepa
rate gym memberships on top of tu
ition costs," you may very well be right.
But the blame for the lack of recre
ational workout options here at Stan
ford is the fault of the University itself,
not the people who run Arrillaga
weight room. This is the athletic de
partment's main varsity athletic train
ing facility, paid for entirely bv the ath
letic department. That this million-dol
lar facility is open to the recreational
public at all is a privilege which the
recreational users have paid not one
dime of tuition for, and this must be
recognized before criticism is offered.
