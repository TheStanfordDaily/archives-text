## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK Learning to speak like a true Brit 
### 
It's a terrible feeling when you find
yourself in a foreign land and can't
understand a word that the people
around yo are saying. It's even worse
when you realize they're speaking
your language.
Of course the English speak En
glish, but it's a different kind of En
glish. They have words here I've never
heard before; certain terms are specif
ic to England or even just to Oxford.
But after being here for a full two
weeks, I feel confident in presenting to
you a helpful glossary consider it
my unabridged version of the Oxford
English Dictionary.
14 Crotch Crescent: Our house
manager's address. The fifth grader
inside me giggles every time.
Been Cheaper than water in most
pubs, so drink up!
Boots: Britain's leading super
drugstore, a wondrous place where
you can get a three-course meal, mas
cara and tampons for under a tenner.
Bush, George W.: The Devil, also
known as Satan or Lucifer. Boy oh
boy, do people hate him here.
Crunchy Nut Flakes: My favorite
British cereal. They are indeed, as the
box promises, "ludicrously tasty!"
Digestiv: Part cookie, part biscuit,
all carbohydrate-laden goodness.
Dodgy: Try replacing "sketchy"
with "dodgy" at least once in your vo
cabulary today. They mean the same
thing here, and "sketchy" is getting
worn out at Stanford.
Football: Known to Americans as
soccer and to the English as a perfectly

valid reason for liv
ing. Not to be con
fused with American
football, which the
English define as "a
combination of
rugby and World
Warn."
Kebab Vans:
Cheap restaurants
on wheels and the
only source of food
in Oxford after 6

p.m. If it weren't for Ahmed, we'd all
starve.
Manky: Nasty, icky, gross and eww.
Exactly what it sounds like, which I
love.
Metrosexuals: Although not limit
ed to England, metrosexuality is espe
cially visible here because of David
Beckham. His ever-changing hairstyle,
haute couture wardrobe and painted
nails make him the gayest straight man
possible thus, a model metrosexual!
(Note: Expect metrosexuality to
spread like wildfire in Madrid.)
More generally, metrosexuals are
straight, affluent men with a taste for
the stereotypically homosexual, in
cluding: regimented gym routines,
gourmet delis, designer labels, con
temporary art, tanning beds and the
Royal National Theatre. They fre
quent hip male salons like London's
Refinery, where back waxes and exec
utive facials are especially popular.
Mickey Mouse: A cultural icon
that both defines America and gives
you good reason to hate it. There isn't

a strict definition to go by, but if some
thing is called Mickey Mouse here, it's
not good.
Posh and Becks: Short for Victoria
"Posh Spice" and David Beckham, the
Bennifer of English popular culture.
Nobody really seems to like them any
more, yet they are everywhere.
Road Chef: A chain of restaurant /
rest-stop hybrids with the most unap
petizing name ever.
Schwarzenegger, Arnold: The first
person mentioned as soon as natives
learn you are from California. Uncon
trollable laughter typically follows.
Shirty: Pissy, or with a bad attitude.
Getting shirty with the bouncer will
get you nowhere.
Snog, get off with, pull: Hello and
OK Magazine use these phrases inter
changeably. I'm pretty sure that they
are all related to kissing and /or mak
ing out.
"Wife Swap": A hugely popular
British reality-TV show where wives
switch families for two weeks. Sadly,
it's not at all like the kinky Roald Dahl
short story; more like "Trading
Spaces" meets "The Surreal Life," but
entertaining nonetheless.
Zodiac, The: Oxford's version of The
Fillmore, only without the purple velvet
walls. Frank Black, Stiff Little Fingers,
Mommy and Daddy and The Wan
nadies all played here in the same week.
It's heaven for the music-obsessed.
