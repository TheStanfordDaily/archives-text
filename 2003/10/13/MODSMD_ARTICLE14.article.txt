## Exploring shades of Gray Davis 
### 
Rejection can be painful. Just ask
anyone who was ever picked last
for the recess kickball game in
elementary school.
Or one who was dumped by voters in
the first recall of a sitting governor in
more than 50 years.
We all read about the many chal
lenges faced by the now-outgoing Gov.
Gray Davis leading up to his ouster. But
in the barrels of ink spilled writing about
the recall, I never saw a single story
about the assault on his psyche and sense
of well-being.
Curious, I decided to ask around on
the topic. First, I checked in with a few of
my neighbors in Crothers Hall.
"Gov. Davis's shattered ego might be
one of the most powerful stories in the
campaign," said Erica Goldberg, a sec
ond year law student.
Goldberg's classmate, Jordan Barry,
concurred. "He must feel like a huge
ass," he said.
Given the prestige associated with
Stanford Law School, and the rumor
that Crothers was the home of at least
one former Stanford Law student who
today sits on the U.S. Supreme Court, I
was dubious that Goldberg or Barry
knew much about rejection themselves,
but I asked anyway.
They agreed that the public nature
of the embarrassment was especially
galling.
Both are interviewing for highly
competitive summer jobs at several
prestigious law firms jobs that
often turn into offers of full-time em
ployment upon graduation. As sur
prising as it may sound, law students
are frequently rejected from jobs, so
they can empathize with Davis. •
"The worst part of the interviewing
process is not just getting rejected by
firms, but having others know that you
got rejected," said Goldberg. "It is
easier to rationalize when you get re
jected privately."
Next I turned to the psychologists.
Davis can take some solace that

when it comes to stress and I can only
assume that waking up to a headline
screaming "BLOWOUT!" would lead
to something akin to stress things
could have been worse.
Psychologists say that the most
stressful situations are those that involve
imminent danger or catastrophe. Think
mine collapses, airline crashes and
armed conflict.
Having never been cast opposite
Arnold Schwarzenegger in a blockbuster
action movie, Davis likely was never
physically threatened by his muscle
bound rival. Yet Davis did face the ter
mination the only pun of the column,
I promise of his political career, and
those same psychologists say that, catas
trophes aside, losing a job can be one of
the worst stressors in a person's life.
Carolyn Aldwin, professor of human
development at UC-Davis, told me that
while everyone responds differently to
stress, most politicians at Davis' level
leam to be thick-skinned.
"Richard Nixon was the exception,"
she joked.
Todd Migliaccio, professor of sociol
ogy at Sacramento State University, said
that a woman might have an easier time
handling the implications of recall.
"Men define themselves by and as
sociate their masculinity with their
work," he said. "The results of the
Oct. 7 vote can be construed as a cas
tration of power."
According to Migliaccio, men threat
ened with a loss of power will often try to
reassert control or show that they are not
afraid. He sees Davis' last-ditch effort to
challenge Schwarzenegger to a debate in
this light.
At a campaign appearance with New
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Davis said
that even though he was no Mr. Uni
verse, he was ready to go "toe-to-toe"
with his Republican challenger.
Psycho-speculation aside, it is unde
niable that other politicians and public
figures have paid a steep price when
faced with public embarrassment and

damaged reputations
In July, British weapons scientist
David Kelly committed suicide when
he became the subject of much scrutiny
about his role in revealing that Prime
Minister Tony Blair's administration
may have "sexed up" the potential
threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
Dr. Thomas Stuttaford, the medical
correspondent for The Times, wrote that
watching Kelly testify before the British
foreign affairs committee, "There was
evidence that, judging from previous
television footage, his usually sensitive,
intelligent and introspective nature had
been stretched beyond its limits."
Vince Foster, a lawyer in the Ginton
White House when it was embroiled in
scandal, committed suicide in 1993. In a
note found after his death, he wrote, "I
was not meant for the job or the spotlight
of public life in Washington. Here ruin
ing people is considered sport."
Yet with images of Jay Leno an
nouncing Gov. Schwarzenegger and
Davis declaring his "no-cry zone" still
fresh in my mind, the situation seems
riper with comedy than concern. And
Davis, with degrees from our very own
Stanford and Columbia Law School, a
bronze star for meritorious duty in Viet
nam and a veteran of California politics,
appeared vigorous in his uniquely un
charismatic way to the last.
If the experience of the last governor
to be recalled is any guide, Davis might
even rise from the ashes sooner than any
would suspect. North Dakota Gov. Lynn
Frazier was ousted by voters in 1921. A
year later he was elected to the U.S. Sen
ate where he served for 18 years.
How soon California will recover is
another story. Aldwin has an opinion
that could well be shared by others.
"The real damage may be to the psy
che of California voters," she said.

Rejection can be painful. Just ask
anyone who was ever picked last
for the recess kickball game in
elementary school.
Or one who was dumped by voters in
the first recall of a sitting governor in
more than 50 years.
We all read about the many chal
lenges faced by the now-outgoing Gov.
Gray Davis leading up to his ouster. But
in the barrels of ink spilled writing about
the recall, I never saw a single story
about the assault on his psyche and sense
of well-being.
Curious, I decided to ask around on
the topic. First, I checked in with a few of
my neighbors in Crothers Hall.
"Gov. Davis's shattered ego might be
one of the most powerful stories in the
campaign," said Erica Goldberg, a sec
ond year law student.
Goldberg's classmate, Jordan Barry,
concurred. "He must feel like a huge
ass," he said.
Given the prestige associated with
Stanford Law School, and the rumor
that Crothers was the home of at least
one former Stanford Law student who
today sits on the U.S. Supreme Court, I
was dubious that Goldberg or Barry
knew much about rejection themselves,
but I asked anyway.
They agreed that the public nature
of the embarrassment was especially
galling.
Both are interviewing for highly
competitive summer jobs at several
prestigious law firms jobs that
often turn into offers of full-time em
ployment upon graduation. As sur
prising as it may sound, law students
are frequently rejected from jobs, so
they can empathize with Davis. •
"The worst part of the interviewing
process is not just getting rejected by
firms, but having others know that you
got rejected," said Goldberg. "It is
easier to rationalize when you get re
jected privately."
Next I turned to the psychologists.
Davis can take some solace that

when it comes to stress and I can only
assume that waking up to a headline
screaming "BLOWOUT!" would lead
to something akin to stress things
could have been worse.
Psychologists say that the most
stressful situations are those that involve
imminent danger or catastrophe. Think
mine collapses, airline crashes and
armed conflict.
Having never been cast opposite
Arnold Schwarzenegger in a blockbuster
action movie, Davis likely was never
physically threatened by his muscle
bound rival. Yet Davis did face the ter
mination the only pun of the column,
I promise of his political career, and
those same psychologists say that, catas
trophes aside, losing a job can be one of
the worst stressors in a person's life.
Carolyn Aldwin, professor of human
development at UC-Davis, told me that
while everyone responds differently to
stress, most politicians at Davis' level
leam to be thick-skinned.
"Richard Nixon was the exception,"
she joked.
Todd Migliaccio, professor of sociol
ogy at Sacramento State University, said
that a woman might have an easier time
handling the implications of recall.
"Men define themselves by and as
sociate their masculinity with their
work," he said. "The results of the
Oct. 7 vote can be construed as a cas
tration of power."
According to Migliaccio, men threat
ened with a loss of power will often try to
reassert control or show that they are not
afraid. He sees Davis' last-ditch effort to
challenge Schwarzenegger to a debate in
this light.
At a campaign appearance with New
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Davis said
that even though he was no Mr. Uni
verse, he was ready to go "toe-to-toe"
with his Republican challenger.
Psycho-speculation aside, it is unde
niable that other politicians and public
figures have paid a steep price when
faced with public embarrassment and

damaged reputations
In July, British weapons scientist
David Kelly committed suicide when
he became the subject of much scrutiny
about his role in revealing that Prime
Minister Tony Blair's administration
may have "sexed up" the potential
threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
Dr. Thomas Stuttaford, the medical
correspondent for The Times, wrote that
watching Kelly testify before the British
foreign affairs committee, "There was
evidence that, judging from previous
television footage, his usually sensitive,
intelligent and introspective nature had
been stretched beyond its limits."
