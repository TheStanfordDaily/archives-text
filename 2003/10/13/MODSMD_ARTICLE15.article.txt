## 'Mild Bunch' has rough day of game play 
### 
With dazzling plays from fresh
men Evan Moore, David Mar
rero and Michael Okwo, the
future of Stanford football
looked bright on Saturday night at the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
But the present looked pretty bleak.
The Cardinal's run defense, ranked third
in the nation before the game, surrendered
220 yards and made Southern California
freshman running back LenDale White look
like Maurice Clarett (back when he used to
be a football player instead of a legal gadfly).
What could have been worse than that?
It's hard to say, but several other aspects of
Stanford's performance were almost as bad.
The defensive secondary is full of track
athletes who can usually outrun everyone
but were unable to stop almost anyone on
Saturday, let alone USC iiber-receiver Mike
Williams, who torched them for 102 yards

and three touchdowns in
the second quarter alone.
Pass rush would be a
misnomer for Stanford's
efforts to get to Trojan
quarterback Matt Leinart.
The only thing that was
hurried in the first half
was his rate of touchdown
scoring: USC's quarter
backs weren't sacked

once.
The worst yet most excusable per
formance was by Stanford's offensive line
men, who spent more time in quarterback
Trent Edwards' grill than a 48-oz. porter
house.
With three sacks and two forced fumbles,
USC end Kenechi Udeze was the wildest of
the "Wild Bunch II" defensive line, so
named because it apparently reminds Tro
jans fans of Willard Scott. No, not the portly
weathercaster, but the Bubba who helped
anchor USC's original 1969 Wild Bunch line.
Especially given a serious injury to start
ing center Brian Head, it would have been
unfair to expect Stanford's inexperienced
blockers to, contain what many consider to
be the best defensive line in the country.
But Stanford only got the ball to diminu
tive dynamo Luke Powell twice. After slic
ing up San Jose State's defense for 172 yards
in the season opener, the s'B" senior receiv
er has gained just 70 yards in the three
games since.
On Saturday, it looked like he spent most
of his energy going in motion, running laps
around the backfield before the snap to
"confuse" the defense so that Stanford could
rush the ball up the middle for no gain.
As for the passing game, Edwards often
threw the ball with pinpoint accuracy un
fortunately, he was aiming it out of bounds
half the time in a desperate attempt to avoid
being sacked.
As futile as the Cardinal looked against
the Trojans incidentally, it was about as
futile as San Jose State looked against Stan
ford there are positives to be found.
Moore, the 6-foot-7 wide receiver re
minded everyone of Teyo Johnson.
Marrero, running the ball, showed he
possesses both burst and pop, two words that
I admit mean the same thing when referring
to balloons, but in this context are intended
to mean "quickness" and "power." Um, and
he also scored a touchdown.
True freshman tight end Patrick Danahy
had only one catch, but he made it count,
corralling a deflected Chris Lewis pass in the
end zone to finally give the long-suffering
fifth-year senior quarterback something
positive to write home about.
And freshman Michael Okwo delivered
what may have been the most satisfying
play of the game for those few Stanford fans
who were still watching, when he delivered
a positively evil, bone-crunching block on
special teams.
O.J. Atogwe's strong-armed robbery of
the ball from a USC kick returner, which he
parlayed into a touchdown, was a brilliant
play that saved the Cardinal from total hu
miliation. Nick Sebes's 51-yard kickoff re
turn was another highlight on special teams,
which were really quite special compared to
the offense and defense on Saturday.
USC is an excellent team, overtime losses
to Weenies notwithstanding, and the bare
fact that the young Cardinal lost the game
isn't shameful.
What was troubling was the absolute ease
with which the Trojans moved the ball in the
first half against a Stanford defense that I
had come to believe was a legitimate
strength. Compared to USC's fearsome de
fensive front, Stanford's crew might have
been nicknamed the "Mild Bunch."
Stanford kept playing hard throughout
the game despite the embarrassing deficit,
and from the improved attitude on the team
this year, it's reasonable to believe head
coach Buddy Teevens when he said they will
take the 44-21 defeat as "a learning experi
ence."
Last year, that was a type of lesson that
the Cardinal "learned" far too many times.
