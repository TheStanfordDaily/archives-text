# No cause for celebration

LOS ANGELES Apparently
Southern California hadn't heard
anything about Stanford's sup
posed defensive resurgence. Or at
least the Trojans didn't play like
it.
USC scored 41 points and
racked up 413 yards of total of
fense in the first half alone en
route to blowing out the Cardi
nal 44-21.
The Trojans won their
twelfth game in a row at home
and became only the 10th school
in NCAA history to win 700
games.

Meanwhile, Stanford (2-2, 0-2
Pacific-10 Conference) was domi
nated in a fashion similar to last
year's debacle, when the Trojans
scored four touchdowns through
the air and three on the ground in
Palo Alto to win effortlessly 49-17.
This time around, some new
faces (and some old ones too)
shredded Stanford's defense
with ease.
USC quarterback Matt Lein
hart, in his first season trying to
replace the irreplaceable Carson
Palmer, did his best impression
of the former Heisman Trophy
winner, completing 18-of-27
passes for 260 yards and three
touchdowns.

Freshman tailback LenDale
White had his second consecu
tive 100-yard game making him
the first USC rookie to ever ac
complish the feat. Moreover, on
Saturday his two touchdowns
were his sixth and seventh in the
last four games.
Sophomore wideout Mike
Williams, who also burned the
Cardinal last year, had an even
bigger game this time with seven
catches for 129 yards and three
touchdowns.
"We were very aware of him
and we knew he's a game-break
ing type of guy," Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens said. "We
didn't cover him as well as we
should have. But then again, how
can you cover him?"
All the talk leading up to Sat
urday's game was about the
marked improvement of Stan
ford's defense from a year ago.
The Cardinal defense entered
the game ranked first in rushing
defense and third in scoring de
fense in the conference.
And Stanford hadn't allowed
an opponent to eclipse the 30-
point mark this season some
thing it did an astounding eight
times last year until now.
So what went wrong?
"We just didn't execute the
defense we had set up,"
linebacker David Bergeron said.
"We bring a lot of pressure and
like to blitz a lot.
"They did a great job of pick
ing up our blitzes. That left our
secondary guys in one-on-one
coverage for too long."
For all intents and purposes,
the game was decided early in
the crazy second quarter (when
six touchdowns were scored, in
cluding four in the first five min
utes).
USC pulled away quickly
after Williams caught his second
TD from Leinhart to put the
Trojans ahe&d 27-0.
Nick Sebes,, however, re
turned the ensuing kickoff 51
yards down the left sideline into
USC territory. Four plays later,
freshman David Marrero picked
up his first career touchdown
with a 15-yard touchdown run to
put the Cardinal on the board.
(It was only the third rushing
touchdown allowed by the Tro
jans all year long.)

Special teams came into play
yet again for Stanford on the sub
sequent kickoff, when junior Os
himogho Atogwe stripped the
ball cleanly from the hands of
Trojan returner Marcell All
mond and ran it back 22 yards for
another touchdown.
All of a sudden, Stanford was
within reach, 27-14.
"It was huge," Sebes said.
"We were just hoping to feed off
that."
Instead, the Trojans fed off
the challenge; what could have
been a major turn of momentum
away from USC turned out to be
nothing more than a minor bump
in the road.
It took USC only two minutes
and 10 seconds and six plays to
go 74 yards down the field for an
other score this one a three
yard run from White.
After a Stanford three-and

out, the Trojans added another
score a three-yard touchdown
reception by Williams and
headed into the locker room with
the game in hand.
As many problems as Stan
ford had defensively, there were
just as many issues on offense.
Freshman quarterback Trent
Edwards had another unimpres
sive outing on the road, complet
ing only 8-of-19 passes for 67
yards and an interception. He was
sacked twice and seemed to strug
gle with the boisterous Coliseum
crowd with three delay-of-game
penalties.
So with 3:41 left in the third
quarter, Teevens inserted back
up quarterback Chris Lewis into
a blowout game.
Lewis continued to run the
conservative offense employed

by Teevens. He would eventually
lead an 18-play drive in the latter
stages of the game, which culmi
nated in a tipped touchdown pass
to freshman Patrick Danahy with
22 seconds remaining.
On the whole, Lewis complet
ed 11 of 21 attempts for 89 yards
for a touchdown and also threw
an interception.
But the game was already way
out of hand by that point.
"I put Chris in to get him on the
field and get some snaps,"
Teevens said. "I told him to play
his game and not try to do any
thing special and he did some pos
itive things."
So is this the beginning of an
other quarterback controversy?
"Trent is still the No. 1 guy
right now," Teevens said. "I want
there to be pressure on both guys.
The person playing at the quar
terback spot will be the most pro
ductive guy."
Stanford will celebrate Home
coming this weekend with a game
against Washington State.

All the talk leading up to Sat
urday's game was about the
marked improvement of Stan
ford's defense from a year ago.
The Cardinal defense entered
the game ranked first in rushing
defense and third in scoring de
fense in the conference.
And Stanford hadn't allowed
an opponent to eclipse the 30-
point mark this season some
thing it did an astounding eight
times last year until now.
So what went wrong?
"We just didn't execute the
defense we had set up,"
linebacker David Bergeron said.
"We bring a lot of pressure and
like to blitz a lot.
"They did a great job of pick
ing up our blitzes. That left our
secondary guys in one-on-one
coverage for too long."
For all intents and purposes,
the game was decided early in
the crazy second quarter (when
six touchdowns were scored, in
cluding four in the first five min
utes).
USC pulled away quickly
after Williams caught his second
TD from Leinhart to put the
Trojans ahe&d 27-0.
Nick Sebes,, however, re
turned the ensuing kickoff 51
yards down the left sideline into
USC territory. Four plays later,
freshman David Marrero picked
up his first career touchdown
with a 15-yard touchdown run to
put the Cardinal on the board.
(It was only the third rushing
touchdown allowed by the Tro
jans all year long.)

Special teams came into play
yet again for Stanford on the sub
sequent kickoff, when junior Os
himogho Atogwe stripped the
ball cleanly from the hands of
Trojan returner Marcell All
mond and ran it back 22 yards for
another touchdown.
All of a sudden, Stanford was
within reach, 27-14.
"It was huge," Sebes said.
"We were just hoping to feed off
that."
Instead, the Trojans fed off
the challenge; what could have
been a major turn of momentum
away from USC turned out to be
nothing more than a minor bump
in the road.
It took USC only two minutes
and 10 seconds and six plays to
go 74 yards down the field for an
other score this one a three
yard run from White.
After a Stanford three-and

out, the Trojans added another
score a three-yard touchdown
reception by Williams and
headed into the locker room with
the game in hand.
As many problems as Stan
ford had defensively, there were
just as many issues on offense.
Freshman quarterback Trent
Edwards had another unimpres
sive outing on the road, complet
ing only 8-of-19 passes for 67
yards and an interception. He was
sacked twice and seemed to strug
gle with the boisterous Coliseum
crowd with three delay-of-game
penalties.
So with 3:41 left in the third
quarter, Teevens inserted back
up quarterback Chris Lewis into
a blowout game.
Lewis continued to run the
conservative offense employed

by Teevens. He would eventually
lead an 18-play drive in the latter
stages of the game, which culmi
nated in a tipped touchdown pass
to freshman Patrick Danahy with
22 seconds remaining.
On the whole, Lewis complet
ed 11 of 21 attempts for 89 yards
for a touchdown and also threw
an interception.
But the game was already way
out of hand by that point.
"I put Chris in to get him on the
field and get some snaps,"
Teevens said. "I told him to play
his game and not try to do any
thing special and he did some pos
itive things."
So is this the beginning of an
other quarterback controversy?
"Trent is still the No. 1 guy
right now," Teevens said. "I want
there to be pressure on both guys.
The person playing at the quar
terback spot will be the most pro
ductive guy."
Stanford will celebrate Home
coming this weekend with a game
against Washington State.
LOS ANGELES Apparently
Southern California hadn't heard
anything about Stanford's sup
posed defensive resurgence. Or at
least the Trojans didn't play like
it.
USC scored 41 points and
racked up 413 yards of total of
fense in the first half alone en
route to blowing out the Cardi
nal 44-21.
The Trojans won their
twelfth game in a row at home
and became only the 10th school
in NCAA history to win 700
games.

Meanwhile, Stanford (2-2, 0-2
Pacific-10 Conference) was domi
nated in a fashion similar to last
year's debacle, when the Trojans
scored four touchdowns through
the air and three on the ground in
Palo Alto to win effortlessly 49-17.
This time around, some new
faces (and some old ones too)
shredded Stanford's defense
with ease.
USC quarterback Matt Lein
hart, in his first season trying to
replace the irreplaceable Carson
Palmer, did his best impression
of the former Heisman Trophy
winner, completing 18-of-27
passes for 260 yards and three
touchdowns.

Freshman tailback LenDale
White had his second consecu
tive 100-yard game making him
the first USC rookie to ever ac
complish the feat. Moreover, on
Saturday his two touchdowns
were his sixth and seventh in the
last four games.
Sophomore wideout Mike
Williams, who also burned the
Cardinal last year, had an even
bigger game this time with seven
catches for 129 yards and three
touchdowns.
"We were very aware of him
and we knew he's a game-break
ing type of guy," Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens said. "We
didn't cover him as well as we
should have. But then again, how
can you cover him?"
All the talk leading up to Sat
urday's game was about the
marked improvement of Stan
ford's defense from a year ago.
