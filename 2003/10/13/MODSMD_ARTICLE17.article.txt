# USC defense trips up Card
## 
### NATHAN KURZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES Stanford learned first hand why USC's
defensive line has itself a nickname.
Trent Edwards learned pretty quickly, in fact.
On Stanford's third play from scrimmage, Edwards went
back to pass with Stanford facing a third-and-long.
He planted his feet and uh oh found Trojans defen
sive end Kenechi Udeze right in his face. Udeze leveled Ed
wards with a punishing hit, knocking the ball loose for a fum
ble that was recovered by the other defensive end, Omar
Nazel, at Stanford's 16 yard-line.
"I've watched them on film all week," said a frustrated
Edwards after the game. "You can't match their speed.
They've handled some really talented offensive lineman
like at Auburn."
It was, obviously, an ominous start to a miserable night
for Edwards and company.
But it was a theme that continued all game long.
At the center of that havoc was Udeze, who was the most
effective of the four.
He finished with four tackles three of which were for
a loss and had a game-high three sacks, two forced fum
bles and even blocked a Michael Sgroi field goal attempt
late in the first quarter.
Defensive tackle Mike Patterson had four tackles and
a fumble recovery. Nazel had two tackles and a fumble re
covery. And Shaun Cody arguably the most revered
nationally of the four mega-talents didn't even get his
name on the scoresheet, a testament to the depth and re
siliency of the line.
"USC's defensive line is as good of a front as we'll face,"
said Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens. "They're quick off
the ball and are good rushers."
He added, "They were everything we thought they'd be."
The defensive line is nicknamed the "Wild Bunch II" in
honor of USC's famous 1969 defensive front, which includ
ed A 1 Cowlings, Jimmy Gunn. Willard Scott, Tody Smith,
Charlie Weaver and Tony Terry.
You've obviously got to be an extremely confident
group to openly acknowledge a moniker, but self-assur
ance never seems to be lacking from the traditionally
hubristic Trojan defenders.
"I thought all four of us did a good job of getting to the
quarterback," Udeze said. "The secondary gave us a step
and I was fortunate enough to get there."

For good reason, the four veterans are all on watch lists
for 2003 post-season honors.
Listen to Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville talk about
this bunch after it accounted for 17 tackles, including six
tackles for a loss, three sacks, two pass deflections, one fum
ble forced and one fumble recovered in USC's opening
weekend win.
"My quarterback didn't have a chance," Tuberville ad
mitted after the game. "He was running around for his life.
"We just couldn't get any rhythm going. You could just
tell our offensive line didn't feel good about being able to
block those guys."
The quartet has already run back an interception for
a touchdown, created a safety and blocked two field
goal attempts.
This kind of big-play ability showcases the kind of athleti
cism that the four defenders bring to the football field.
"They're an impressive group," Stanford linebacker

David Bergeron said. "They are a very athletic group who do
a great job of finding lanes and getting to the quarterback."
Nazel and Udeze were known commodities heading into
the season. Udeze set a USC record with his Pac-10 leading
six forced fumbles a year ago, while Nazel put up modest
numbers at the other end position.
Patterson also returned as a junior to follow up on his
team-leading seven tackles for loss and four fumble re
coveries.
The only question mark was Cody, who had been a fresh
man All-American in 2001 before being plagued by knee
ligament damage a year later. He had the unenviable task of
trying to replace the steady Bernard Riley, who had 19 ca
reer starts and had 25 tackles in the seven games in which he
played last year.
Thus far, all four have wrecked their fair share of chaos
around the nation.
Stanford was just their latest victim.

Senior quarterback Chris Lewis slips past a USC linebacker in Saturda y's blowout loss for the Cardinal. Despite missing
this tackle, the Trojan defense is one of the best in the country and bears the nickname the "Wild Bunch II" for its resemblance
to the famous defensive contingent of USC's 1969 season.
