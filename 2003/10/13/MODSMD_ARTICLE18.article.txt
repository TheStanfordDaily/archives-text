# Water polo drops another game to Trojans
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WHITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team returned
home this weekend with mixed results after a Saturday
loss to No. 4 Southern California and a Sunday victory
over No. 9 Loyola Marvmount.
The Cardinal is now 9-3 for the season. But with this
second loss to USC, the team must play harder to ensure
a bid for this season's NCAA Championships, which will
be hosted by Stanford at the Avery Aquatic Center on
Dec. 6 and 7.
Stanford came out strong during its Saturday game
against USC. The Trojans, however, proved to be more
than the Cardinal could handle, beating Stanford 9-7 in
regulation. This is the men's first loss in conference play,
giving them a 1-1 record in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation. Saturday's defeat follows a previous loss to
the Trojan men in the championship game of the South
ern California Tournament three weeks ago.
Junior driver Tony Azevedo led the Cardinal in
scoring with four goals against USC. Two of his goals
came at the end of the second period, for a 3-1 Stanford
lead at halftime. Junior driver Matt Moser scored twice
for Stanford and sophomore driver Thomas Hopkins
added another goal for a game total of seven goals.
Sophomore goalie Chad Taylor made seven saves for
the Cardinal.
But the Trojans came back with six goals in the third
period. It scored again in the fourth period, notching a
staggering seven unanswered goals. USC goalie Bozidar
Damjanovic made four saves in the third period and

eight for the entire game.
Stanford encountered smoother waters in yesterday's
game against Loyola Marvmount in Los Angeles. Moti
vated by Saturday's defeat, the Cardinal rolled over the
Lions for an 11-4 victory, despite an impressive 11 saves
for the game by LMU's goalie lan Elliot.
The Lions took an early lead in the first period, but
Hopkins returned the goal 24 seconds later to tie the
score at 1-1. Senior utility Mike Derse brought in an
other goal for the Cardinal to bring the lead to 2-1 at
the end of the first period. Goals by Azevedo and
freshman two-meter JJ Garton brought Stanford
ahead 5-2 at halftime.
The Cardinal shut down the game in the fourth peri
od with a 4-0 run against the Lions with goals by Azeve
do and Hopkins. Azevedo led the game in scoring with
five goals. Hopkins was a close second with four goals for
the game.
LMU has an even record, with 9-9 for the season, but
is far from being a contender for the finals. Stanford is 9-
3 overall and 2-1 in the MPSF. USC is 12-2 overall and 3-
0 in the conference.
USC has tallied critical wins against Stanford and Cal
ifornia in conference play, positioning the Trojans well
for a bid to the finals in December. But the Cardinal
needs to turn in strong performances and victories in
both conference and non-conference play to ensure a
tournament berth.
Stanford will have a chance to improve its conference
record and take a step closer to the NCAA tournament
next weekend with two noontime games against UC-Santa
Barbara and UC-Davis at the Avery Aquatic Center.
