University officials are questioning the future of Full
Moon on the Quad, after four alcohol-related hospital
izations, plus an arrest for driving under the influence of
alcohol and an arrest for public drunkenness, took place
early Friday morning.
"I have serious reservations about this event happen
ing again," said Assistant Dean and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe. "But it is too early to say what the
future of Full Moon is."
Howe made clear that Friday morning's incidents
were unacceptable. She added that if the University de
cides that the event is too risky, it may be discontinued.
"We can't have this event if it continues like that," said
Howe. "But it is really up to the students to decide with
their actions."
The San Jose Mercury News published an article on

the alcohol-related incidents on Friday, drawing public
attention to the situation. However, the University main
tains that its concerns stem from the severity of the ac
tions themselves.
"We're concerned any time a student is hospitalized
or arrested, and our concern increases when one event
produces multiple incidents that affect the well-being of
our students," said Chris Griffith, acting dean of students.
The alcohol-related incidents took place despite a
stronger emphasis in recent years on safety at Full Moon
on the Quad. This year, for example, the Office of Stu
dent Activities, ASSU and senior class presidents worked
with RAs, RFs, PHEs and Vaden Health Center repre
sentatives to discourage drinking on the night of the
event.
"While most of the 2,000 to 3,000 students who partic
ipated in Full Moon on the Quad respected the spirit of a
fun, alcohol-free activity, we are very concerned and dis
appointed that some students did not honor that spirit,

thereby posing a safety risk to themselves and their
peers." Griffith said in a press release.
In addition to the four students who were taken di
rectly to the hospital from Full Moon as a result of police
or administrators stepping in. other students were later
taken to the hospital by friends and dorm-mates.
Three deputy officers and six security officers were
present at the event.
"I think that the security is only related to handling the
event itself," Howe said. "They can't control what people
do before coming to the Quad."
Director of Public Safety Laura Wilson attributed the
problems to students "front-loading in their dorms prior
to the event." Â«
For administrators in the Office of Student Activities,
the next step in deciding the future of Full Moon on the
Quad will be to talk to students and the ASSU to figure

At Full Moon on the Quad last week, ambulances arrive behind Memorial Church to rush students to the emergency room. Four students were taken to the hospital
early Friday morning for alcohol-related emergencies.
out exactly what happened.
"Full Moon on the Quad has
been enjoyed by generations of
Stanford students," Griffith said.
"But the event cannot generate the
kinds of problems we saw on
Thursday. It takes the good judg
ment and goodwill of all who
tend to make it a safe event. Most
of the students who attended this
year's Full Moon participated re
sponsibly. Unfortunately, some

did not."
Many students feel that the Uni
versity cannot prevent the tradition
of drinking before Full Moon on the
Quad, and therefore cannot stop the
subsequent hospitalizations that
may occur.
"You can't stop freshmen from
drinking any more than you can stop
the moon from getting full," said se
nior Rebecca Dowell.
Sophomore Ali Jamal agreed.
"I think the drinking policies are
ineffective because they are unreal
istic," he said. "People who are
going to drink are going to drink,
and they are probably going to
drink a lot."
