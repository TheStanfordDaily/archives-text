Edward 'Teddy" Underwood, a 21-year
old senior and member of the Sigma Chi fra
ternity, was arrested early Saturday morning
fortwocountsofhit-and-runproperty damage
and driving under the influence.
Underwood was returning to campus
when his car collided with a Marguerite bus
stop bench near Campus Drive and Bow
doin Street. Police officers heard the colli
sion and arrived at the scene, but the car
had driven away.
Nobody was waiting at the bus stop at the
time of the crash, but there had been nu
merous people waiting at the spot minutes
earlier, according to witness accounts.
Officers then received calls of another
crash at Mayfield Avenue, on the inner
Row near Sigma Chi. Police arrived to find
an abandoned Isuzu Rodeo that had
jumped the curb and collided with a blue
emergency pole.
The officers were unable to find the driver
or passengers at the scene but were ap
proached by a witness who knew the driver.
Later that night, Underwood was ar
rested and booked into the San Jose main
jail at 2:29 a.m.
Underwood declined to comment for this
story.
"The investigation is still continuing,"
said acting Lt. David Lee.
Ben Dey, Sigma Chi president, said that
Underwood was not with Sigma Chi mem
bers at the time of the crash and was not re
turning from an official fraternity function.
