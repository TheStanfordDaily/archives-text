# Stanford Dining makes switch to Pepsi
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
In the battle of beverages, Pepsi has defeated Coke
at Stanford, at least.
Last Wednesday, Stanford Dining initiated a cam
pus-wide switch from Coca-Cola to Pepsi. In the next
two weeks, students can expect to drink Pepsi products,
including Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Twist, Mountain
Dew, Gatorade and Dole juices, instead of Coke prod
ucts such as Sprite, Poweraid and Minute Maid previ
ously offered in the dining halls.
The Pepsi machines were first unveiled at Manzanita
Dining nearly a week ago. Though signs in the dining
halls advertised the switch, some students were still
caught off guard.
"I haven't eaten at Manzanita for awhile, so I didn't
even know they were switching the machines," said se
nior Chris Lee, a resident assistant in Kimball.
Pointing to five cases of Coke stashed in the corner
of his room, Lee added that he "definitely prefers
Coke to Pepsi."
Stanford Dining saw the switch as an opportunity
to reduce food costs without changing the quality of

food offered in the dining halls, said Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stanford Dining. When
Stanford Dining's contract with Coca-Cola expired
this summer, Siddiqui negotiated with both the Coke
and Pepsi companies.

"We reviewed the prices, services
and quality offered by both compa
nies and decided that the contract of
fered by Pepsi was best for us in the
long run," Siddiqui said.
Though Siddiqui could not dis
close the exact costs of Pepsi versus
Coke due to contract issues, he said
that the difference in price was signif
icant. In addition, Siddiqui said that
Pepsi offers faster service than Coke
for broken machines.
The new, five-year contract with
Pepsi will affect only the machines in
dining halls run by Stanford Dining.
Vending machines will continue to
offer Coke products, and retail dining
establishments, such as the Market
place at Wilbur and Stern's Cyber
Cafe, will sell cans of Coke.
"I have found people who are Coke
fans, and I have found people who are
Pepsi fans," Siddiqui said. "I know that
this switch might not please everyone."
The change comes at the heels of
another Stanford Dining switch earli
er this year, when US Foods replaced
food provider Cisco.
Senior Ricardo Trigueros, a Coke
fan, was not particularly thrilled to see

new machines in the Manzanita din
ing facility.
"I used to drink Coke with my
meals, but I don't think that Pepsi has
enough caffeine for me," Trigueros
said. "It's been a disaster. It was very
disorienting. I like routine, and all of a
sudden they carted in a new machine
one day."
Trigueros wishes that Stanford
Dining had sought more student
input before the switch.
Senior John Cieslewicz, however,
â–  does not feel so strongly about the
changes.
"I like milk," Cieslewicz said. "As
long as they keep water and milk in
the dining halls, I'll be happy."
