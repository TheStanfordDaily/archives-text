# Stanford Dining makes switch to Pepsi
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
In the battle of beverages, Pepsi has defeated Coke
at Stanford, at least.
Last Wednesday, Stanford Dining initiated a cam
pus-wide switch from Coca-Cola to Pepsi. In the next
two weeks, students can expect to drink Pepsi products,
including Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Twist, Mountain
Dew, Gatorade and Dole juices, instead of Coke prod
ucts such as Sprite, Poweraid and Minute Maid previ
ously offered in the dining halls.
The Pepsi machines were first unveiled at Manzanita
Dining nearly a week ago. Though signs in the dining
halls advertised the switch, some students were still
caught off guard.
"I haven't eaten at Manzanita for awhile, so I didn't
even know they were switching the machines," said se
nior Chris Lee, a resident assistant in Kimball.
Pointing to five cases of Coke stashed in the corner
of his room, Lee added that he "definitely prefers
Coke to Pepsi."
Stanford Dining saw the switch as an opportunity
to reduce food costs without changing the quality of

food offered in the dining halls, said Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stanford Dining. When
Stanford Dining's contract with Coca-Cola expired
this summer, Siddiqui negotiated with both the Coke
and Pepsi companies.
