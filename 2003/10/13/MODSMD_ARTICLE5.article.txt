# Protesters gather at Dell computer event
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER 
Dell and the National Recycling Coalition co-host
ed a computer-recycling drive on Saturday at Varsity 1
Lot, but they were met with protests from the student
organization Resistance Art and Social Protest.
With flyers about the hazards of electronic waste
and pre-written letters to Michael Dell asking for solu
tions to toxic waste, the protesters complained that
Dell recycles just 10 percent of its computers.
"Of those that are recycled, many are shipped to
third-world countries where miniscule parts are re
moved, and the remaining parts, often toxic, are left
behind," said Jessica Guh, president of the protest
group.

Reusable parts of the computers recycled on Satur
day will be given to non-profits, who distribute them to
families in need, according to Heather Perry, an envi
ronmental engineer at Stanford.
Talley Summerlin, site producer for the event, said
that last summer and spring, Dell went on a tour of 15
U.S. cities to raise awareness of computer recycling
and Dell's recycling programs.
"We realized that people were learning a lot, so we
decided to add an educational component," Summer
lin said.
Dell chose Stanford as the site because "Stan
ford has always been a good Dell customer, and
we've never brought up the e
waste issue in California before,"
she said.
Guh emphasized the importance
of environmentally sound prac
tices.
"This recycling drive is great, an
excellent idea," she said. "But a lot
of practices with third-party recy
clers aren't environmentally
friendly. We are encouraging Dell
to use greener technology and
more responsible practices."
Summerlin defended Dell's recy
cling practices.
"Dell's recycling has always met
high environmental standards," she
said. "Lately, our online program
has been made easier and more af
fordable. Dell designs for the envi
ronment and works to get sensitive
material out of computers."
Guh admitted that Dell has im
proved a lot since being pressured
by customers and environmental
ists. She gave the example of Dell
previously using prison labor, be
fore consumers pressured the cor
poration to stop that practice.

Julie Muir, a representative of
Peninsula Sanitary Services, said the
problem is complex.
"One-day events get the word
out about computer recycling," she
said. "Protesters keep Dell on its
toes, and Dell has already done a lot
to eliminate waste and reduce toxic
ity."
She pointed out that this recy
cling drive was for all brands of com
puter, not just Dell, and most of the
computers that were brought in
were knock-off brands that had not
been sold with any recycling infor
mation.
Dell and the National Recycling
Coalition also held a workshop for
professional recycling coordina
tors from all around San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties on Fri
day.
Human Biology Prof. Armin
Rosencranz offered the opinion that
Dell should be "commended rather
than condemned" for holding a re
cycling drive.
"Dell has only a fraction of the
market share and seems to be be
having better than others in the
same market, such as IBM," he said.
"E-waste is a large problem, but it's
often a problem of consumers not
knowing what to do with their old
computers."
