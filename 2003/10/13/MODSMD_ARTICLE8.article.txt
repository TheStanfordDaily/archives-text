# Solutions posed for Arab-Israeli conflict
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
A Jewish Israeli and a Muslim
Palestinian told an audience of about
30 people on Saturday night that the
only solution to the Arab-Israeli con
flict is the creation of a Palestinian
state.
Hosted by the Israeli Students
Organization, Rami Elhanan
whose 14-year-old daughter was
killed by a Palestinian suicide
bomber in 1997 and Ghazi Brigi
eth whose 14-year-old and 31-
year-old brothers were shot to death
by Israeli soldiers in 2000 repre
sented the Israeli & Palestinian Be
reaved Families for Peace, an organi
zation that consists of more than 400
families that have lost loved ones in
the conflict.
"Today the only solution possible
is to stop the occupation," Elhanan
said. "Ruling 3.5 million people with
out any democratic rights whatsoev
er is wrong - it's against Judaism, it is
the origin of all the violence, the
anger between the two peoples."
According to Elhanan and Brigi
eth, who have been touring the na
tion with their message, the key to
ending the violence in the Middle
East requires not only creating an in
dependent Palestine but also ap
proaching the conflict from a politi
cal, not religious, perspective and
using impartial U.S. mediation.

"We beg you not to keep standing
silent," Brigieth said. "As long as we
[Palestine] keep paying the price, I
am sorry to say that the Israelis and
the Jewish will keep paying the
price."
Professor Joel Beinin, who has
specialized in Middle Eastern history
at Stanford for 20 years, agreed that
the resolution will require "a truly in
dependent state in most of the West
Bank and all of the Gaza Strip and
good parts of East Jerusalem, al
though there would have to be some
compromise in East Jerusalem."
A few members of the audience
expressed to the speakers their
strong differences of opinion, articu
lating criticism against the United
States for its heavy involvement in
the conflict, as well as against Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Elhanan compared a lack of U.S.
support in the Middle Eastern con
flict to the lack of support given to
the Jewish community during the
Holocaust, but also communicated
the need for the United States to take
a more neutral stance.
"Sixty years ago, when they took
my grandparents to the ovens in
Europe, the free and civilized
world stood aside and never lifted a
finger," Elhanan said. "And
today —6O years later —as two
crazy peoples are massacring each
other mercilessly, the free and civi
lized world is not only standing
aside, but the only power that has
the key to do anything is support
ing one side unconditionally, pro
longing our misery."
Beinin agreed with Elhanan and
Brigieth.
"I agree that the U.S. has for the
last few decades played a very nega
tive role because, with some minor
exceptions, it has been allied with Is
rael," Beinin said. "If it wants to me
diate, it needs to take a more even
handed stance. If it doesn't, there's a
chance the conflict will drag on for
some time."
Elhanan criticized the negative
portrayal of Arafat in the United
States and Israel.
"The Israeli government and the
American government are making
enormous efforts to demonize the
democratically elected leader of the
Palestinian people," Elhanan said.
"You will find out that if you demo
nize the leader of the other people,
making him irrelevant, then there is
no one to talk to, and if there is no

one to talk to, then there is nothing
to talk about."
Brigieth emphasized what he per
ceived to be the significance of both
Arafat and the United States in the
peace process.
"We don't want the American
leadership to ignore our elected
leaders," he said, "and we don't want
to ignore them either."
Elhanan said more political
awareness in the United States is
needed.
"Citizens of the United States are
not aware of what is done on behalf
of their name," he said. "They are
not aware that their tax money is
building the separation wall, that
their tax money is financing the Is
raeli security budget. If the United
States uses its tax money to build
schools and hospitals, and not walls,
then things will change."
Beinin commented on the impor
tance of Elhanan and Brigieth shar
ing their experiences.
"I think they're very impressive
people," he said. "No one has paid a
higher price in the conflict than they
have - they've lost close members of
their family. That they more or less
agree on what the resolution should
be is also important. I think that's a
model for peaceful coexistence, and
it's inspiring."

a more neutral stance.
"Sixty years ago, when they took
my grandparents to the ovens in
Europe, the free and civilized
world stood aside and never lifted a
finger," Elhanan said. "And
today —6O years later —as two
crazy peoples are massacring each
other mercilessly, the free and civi
lized world is not only standing
aside, but the only power that has
the key to do anything is support
ing one side unconditionally, pro
longing our misery."
Beinin agreed with Elhanan and
Brigieth.
"I agree that the U.S. has for the
last few decades played a very nega
tive role because, with some minor
exceptions, it has been allied with Is
rael," Beinin said. "If it wants to me
diate, it needs to take a more even
handed stance. If it doesn't, there's a
chance the conflict will drag on for
some time."
Elhanan criticized the negative
portrayal of Arafat in the United
States and Israel.
"The Israeli government and the
American government are making
enormous efforts to demonize the
democratically elected leader of the
Palestinian people," Elhanan said.
"You will find out that if you demo
nize the leader of the other people,
making him irrelevant, then there is
no one to talk to, and if there is no

one to talk to, then there is nothing
to talk about."
Brigieth emphasized what he per
ceived to be the significance of both
Arafat and the United States in the
peace process.
"We don't want the American
leadership to ignore our elected
leaders," he said, "and we don't want
to ignore them either."
Elhanan said more political
awareness in the United States is
needed.
"Citizens of the United States are
not aware of what is done on behalf
of their name," he said. "They are
not aware that their tax money is
building the separation wall, that
their tax money is financing the Is
raeli security budget. If the United
States uses its tax money to build
schools and hospitals, and not walls,
then things will change."
Beinin commented on the impor
tance of Elhanan and Brigieth shar
ing their experiences.
"I think they're very impressive
people," he said. "No one has paid a
higher price in the conflict than they
have - they've lost close members of
their family. That they more or less
agree on what the resolution should
be is also important. I think that's a
model for peaceful coexistence, and
it's inspiring."
