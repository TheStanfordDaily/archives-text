"Don't tell your parents," warned
my babysitter, turning back as she left
the room. "This is just between us. I'll be
right back."
Huddled on the wooden floor, with my
knees to my chest, my second-grade self
nodded silently. The babysitter returned
carrying a black stereo with the oversize
tape-recorder buttons, which she plugged
into the low wall outlet next to me.
"This is hip-hop," she said, as she
pushed the play button and the resonant,
masculine bass growled alive.
Frankly, I was not impressed by the
tunes I heard. All the fuss over some
thing minor like pimps discussing their
defecation habits? Of course, that's
what all those red-faced self-appointed
moral guardians on the evening news
claimed that hip-hop is all about: a tight
knit triumvirate of bloodthirstiness,
cash-greed and ho-lust, punctuated with
a few shots of Bacardi, the occasional
paean to Momma and shrill denials of
responsibility for anything from cheat
ing to child support.
Inphanyte Records (that's pro
nounced In-fuh-NIGHT, for your infor
mation) is about none of these things.
But it is about hip-hop. In a different
way than those iced-out headliners and
shimmying hoochies on MTV and BET
would have you know. For one thing, as
the founders of Stanford's first com
pletely student-operated record label,
juniors Fred Alexander and Jonathan
Jones are happy to claim ownership
over their new brainchild.
"It's like Inphanyte is Stanford's
child, and we're going to watch it grow,"
Alexander says. "Hopefully, it'll get
real old."
Against the afternoon sun, he pulls
his pristine black-and-white baseball
cap over his eyes.
I am having a power lunch with the
guys on the picnic benches outside
Suites. I must admit, I had some doubts
about this interview. When I first
showed up to meet Alexander and
Jones, I wandered by the buffet table at
the Avanti eating club, searching the
room for a pair of guys in baggy jeans.
Then someone called out, "Nicole!
Over here!" I turned around and saw
two guys in impeccable urban-casual-
Friday garb leaning back in their chairs
around a table.
"Not again," I inwardly sighed. I had
interviewed this type before: postado
lescent slicksters who thought they were
too cool for school, their speech drip
ping with the word "dude" and double
entendres galore.
But make no mistake: These guys put
the pro into im-pro-sario. No shiftless,
yeah-I-wanna-be-Clive-Davis-when-I
grow-up attitudes here. Replete with
musical chops and campus-wide con
tacts, Alexander and Jones have their
stuff together, and this shows now that
they're talking with me. They've obvi
ously rehearsed their promotional spiel,
and when I ask them a hard question,
they even boot up Alexander's laptop to
consult a press release they've prepared
for this interview.
They do this when I ask them to shed
light on the name they have chosen for
their new company.
"Inphanyte is not just a record label,
it is a way of life," Alexander says, wax

ing philosophical. "If you live your life
infinitely, you approach things with a
perspective of the future rather than
only the past and present. You are
working toward constant progression."
I say that the Inphanyte name, with
its street inflection, reminds me of other
names of hip-hop record labels: Bad
Boy, Def Jam, Def Soul, Roc-A-Fella,
but with a Christian inspirational-poster
twist. Turns out that this sense of the
name is intentional; both of the guys are
gospel-choir veterans.
The duo say they will produce both

hip-hop and other genres as well. They
plan to release two compilations. One
will be an "urban-style" compilation,
with rap, R&B, gospel and jazz. The
other will be an alternative album rock
and grunge (Jones draws the line at
punk).
In other words, it's quality music
the way it used to be back in the day
when sampling and re-mixing didn't
trump creativity. "Even though In
phanyte is a term that has an urban draw
to it, we want to bring in pop, rock,
grunge . . . I've played in two metal

bands," says Alexander.
So how did this all start? Inphanyte
"was originally Fred's vision," Jones
says. Both of the guys got involved in the
Stanford University Recording Group,
which started up in their freshman year.
They were frustrated by what they
perceive as the inherent difficulty in pub
licizing musical projects on a large Stan
ford campus full of students with tastes
which varied as widely as their residences.
"We both saw how the University
Recording Group is lacking in the Stan
ford community," Alexander says. "First

of all, if we went up to any of the people
around here [Alexander gestures to the
upperclassmen chatting at the surround
ing picnic tables], nine times out of ten,
they're going to say 'No.'
"Also, because of that ignorance, it
doesn't give people a chance to get in
volved," Alexander continues. "We
want students to be involved at every
level: signing, editing, graphic design ..
." In order to accommodate demand,
they have extended the deadline for in
terested students to contact them by e
mail for audition slots until Oct. 17.
"Being the heirs of SURG, we had
connections going into this project,"
Jones says. But they want to get in
volvement from students of all colors
and musical preferences. I am happily
surprised that they plan to produce an
alternative compilation as well. As we
all brush away a bee flying close to my
slice of melon, I tell them how the black
students at my high school dances
would clear the floor whenever "Smells
Like Teen Spirit" played. Alexander
nods in recognition.
"I've never discriminated against
music," Alexander says. "I was in march
ing band in high school, and one of my
good friends there was a Nirvana fan. I
had seen Kurt Cobain and knew that he
died but didn't know what effect he had.
Once on a long bus trip, I listened to my
friend's music and it was great. [Cobain]
was extremely talented."
And Alexander and Jones are per
fect gentlemen to boot so much so
that it is I who must bring up the main
stream hip-hop industry's correct obses
sion with sex sex sex. They look slightly
puzzled, as if it's not an issue that
they've considered in their powwow ses
sion to prepare for this interview.
When I ask what they think of the jig
gle-fests on MTV, they look bored for
the first time in the whole hour we've
been together.
"I'm not down with any of that,"
Alexander says, in an uninterested tone.
They act as if the question is settled and
they are prepared to move onto more
interesting topics.
Jones summed up the team's concep
tion of their role.
"I do not see my self as a moral lead
er," he says. "I am not the president or
some governmental official, or most im
portantly, a parent. I do, however, see
my self as a moral example for other
young businessmen and musical artists.
I hope that the class and dignity that I
plan to use when I express myself
through Inphanyte will influence others
to do so as well not to compromise
character or beliefs, but to be one's self
while recognizing that one's actions do
influence many generations."
Right now, they care more about the
music than any messages moral arbiters
would inscribe on it. What's on rotation
in their theoretical jukebox? I ask.
"I respect the Neptunes' diversity
and appreciation for different musical
genres," says Alexander. "I like music
from Led Zeppelin to Jay-Z. A constant
trend of successful producers is that they
are musically open to a wide range of
genres and styles. I like Diesels repre
sents class, in addition to being relaxed. I
don't want to put myself in a box."
Whatever the future holds in store,
that's one thing it sounds like these two
incipient Inphanyte moguls aren't like
ly to do.

"Inphanyte is not just a record label, it is a
way of life. If you live your life infinitely,
you approach things with a perspective of
the future rather than only the past and
present. You are working toward constant
progression," Fred Alexander
