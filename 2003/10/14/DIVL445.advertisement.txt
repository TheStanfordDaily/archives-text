Popular legal-fiction writer Throw takes on
the divisive topic of the death penalty in
this concise, thoughtful essay. A self-pro
claimed "death penalty agnostic," Throw
didn't consider himself an expert on the
issue even during his years as a prosecutor
or when he helped in the defense of some
high-profile capital cases. Nonetheless, in
early 2000, after Illinois governor George
Ryan declared a moratorium on further
executions, Turow was appointed to a
14-member blue-ribbon commission
charged with helping reform the state's
capital punishment system. Ryan's
groundbreaking moratorium began a wave
of similar actions nationwide as more and
more guilty convictions were questioned,
whether via new DNA evidence or an
overzealous prosecutorial machine (in two
key cases in Illinois, a little of both). Throw
traces the recent history of the death
penalty through his own experiences, and
though he was ambivalent about it at the
start, he comes away with definite
convictions. This is not a scientific study,
Throw admits, but he does supply ample
notes to back up many of the claims he
makes throughout the book. Also included
is the commission's report as submitted to
Governor Ryan. Together with Mark
Fuhrman's more procedural study, Death
and Justice [BKL Jlo3],Throw's reflections
will spark further discussions on this
troublesome issue.
