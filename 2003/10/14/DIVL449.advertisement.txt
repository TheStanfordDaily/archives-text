Stanford Students:
Please come to a quarterly gathering of students who are
experiencing loss and grief. This gathering, sponsored by
Counseling and Psychological Services, the Deans for Religious Life,
and the Residence Deans is an opportunity for students to
share with one another their experiences, suggestions
and concerns as mourners.
We will meet for dinner and discussion,
beginning at 6:00 p.m. on
Wednesday,
October 15
in Vaden Health Center
at 866 Campus Drive
(across from Wilbur Field)
in the second floor conference room.
Please feel free to invite other students who may be dealing
with grief and bereavement.
You can RSVP to your Residence Deans or to rabbipkn@stanford.edu.
We look forward to your joining us.
Please feel free to explore Stanford's
grief website at http://grief.stanford.edu.
The site provides an overview of campus and
community grief resources and offers an opportunity
to create a virtual memorial.
