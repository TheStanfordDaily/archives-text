# Caltrain offers express service
## 
### JESSICA DANIEL 
Stanford students can look forward to major up
grades in Caltrain service this spring, including new
trains, faster service and the re-opening of a week
end train schedule.
The improvements are part of Caltrain's CTX
construction project, which began in 2002, that aims
to modernize parts of the railway, update train
technology and improve train schedules.
The new express service is not yet in effect, but
new trains called Baby Bullets are already operat
ing alongside older trains in the regular Caltrain
schedules.
Once implemented in the spring of 2004, the
Baby Bullet service will shorten the commute time
between San Francisco and San Jose by at least 20
minutes. Caltrain said the new trains will be quieter
and more modern, with laptop tables and plug-ins.
The trains will also stop at four of the other most
heavily trafficked stations: Palo Alto, Mountain
View, Millbrae and Hillsdale.
Sophomore Amy Lee, who commuted on the
Caltrain from her sister's apartment in San Francis
co to her job in Palo Alto during the summer, was
skeptical about the effect of a shorter commute
time on students.
"It would affect a lot of students working in the
area over the summer, and during the school year it
might affect those who go to the city a lot, but that
doesn't seem to happen a lot here," she said.
But sophomore Lisa Chen said a faster Caltrain
might convince her to take more trips to the city.
"I don't take the Caltrain now, because I don't
have time," she said. "If it was more convenient,
I'd take the train as opposed to driving, but I want
to be able to go out on a weekend and stay out
late."
Caltrain representative Jayme Kunz agreed that
the new service would have a limited effect on stu
dents, but added that regular commuters, such as
faculty and staff, would probably profit from the
new Baby Bullets.
"Students tend to have more variation in their
schedules," Kunz said. "Some days they will end
their classes at 12:30 p.m., but the Baby Bullet
schedules will only run during peak commuter
hours in the mornings and evenings."
For students, the more important change will be
the reinstatement of weekend service, also set for
the spring.
"I think the main effect on students will be the
resumption of trains on the weekends," said senior
Jaime Ashander. "I don't think they'll really even
notice whether there's faster service."
Caltrain stopped weekend service in June last
year.
