# Answer Girl dishes the truth about lightning balls
## 
### 
Q: Answer girl, my Head Peer Ad
vising Coordinator has one of
those lightning storm balls that
you touch to make the electricity
your hand. Since the add deadline
has passed, I don't really have any excuse to
stop by any more, so I was hoping you could
help me out. How does the thingamabob
ber work, so I can go tell my adviser all
about it?

A: Ahh, yes. I know how addicting
those can be. You touch the sur
face of one of those glowing,
mesmerizing balls called
"plasma spheres" by connoisseurs and sci
ence geeks and the lightning-like sparks
magically draw toward your hand. I doubt
there's anything better out there for making

you feel like Zeus. Or I
guess maybe like Zeus
mixed with Charlton Hes
ton as Moses in "The Ten
Commandments."
Truth be told, however,
you'd be making a more ac
curate comparison if you
thought of yourself as the
stuffed bear from the
Downy Fabric Softener

commercials. Not that you're chunky and
beady-eyed although hell, what do I know,
maybe you really are chunky and beady
eyed. But that's not my point; whether you
are, or are not, chunky and beady-eyed (and
I'm not alleging either way), when you touch
the ball you're sharing at least one feature

with a teddy bear tossing in the dryer: You're
experiencing the flow of tiny electric currents
along the surface of your body.
You see, plasma balls have a central elec
trode that heats and ionizes the gas inside the
globe usually it's argon and / or other inert
gases at low pressure creating "plasma,"
that is, hot ionized gas. Since "ionization" just
means you're kicking electrons away from
their nuclei, this process has two conse
quences: First, you have all these excited elec
trons zipping around, and they're trying to
find a way to let off their energy. So they do
in the form of light. Different elements give
off characteristic colors for example, neon
will give off a reddish-orangey glow, while
argon will make purple-lavender.
Second, the electrons interact to create

currents i.e., moving charges inside the
globe; that's why you see the light traveling in
those great hghtning-like streams. That's also
why the streams gather at your hand when
you touch the glass: You're grounding the
currents. That is, the currents travel along the
surface of your body but no, not through it
toward the ground, where their charges
get spread out and diluted.
If you want your own plasma ball but
have been impoverished since that last gam
bling spree, or ex-girlfriend, or whatever,
you can make your own: There're tons of
Web sites for Martha Stewart cadets just
like you. And who knows one day it
might even lure hotties into your room.
