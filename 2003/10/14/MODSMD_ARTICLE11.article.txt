## Stanford Store should fold 
### 
Some good ideas just don't work in
the real world. The Stanford Store
operated by Stanford Student Enter
prises, the business unit of the ASSU
is exactly that: a good idea that has gone
sour upon execution.

Over the past five years, the Stanford
Store has never turned a profit. Further
more, losses have increased since that time,
to the point where the store reported a
$53,603 loss on $227,939 in expenditures in
fiscal year 2002, according to Form 990s filed
with the Internal Revenue Service. While
losses might be expected during the first few
years of operation, the Stanford Store is no
longer a new business.

Losses of this scale are not acceptable. It
is time that Stanford Student Enterprises re
alized that this experiment much like the
aborted "FLiCKS to Go" program, which
ended last year has failed. It is time to cut
the ASSU's losses short.

If Stanford Student Enterprises had no
ties to the student body, we would not be so
concerned about the losses posted by the
Stanford Store. But because the parent or
ganization is supposed to "guarantee the
long-term financial viability of the ASSU,"
the bottom line is much more important to
the student body.

The ASSU ensures that our elected rep
resentatives are able to act on the behalf of
students. Without the $9,000,000 endow
ment that the ASSU has built up over time,
our student government would not have its
current leveraging power. When one of
Stanford Student Enterprises's business
units posts a loss, the money to cover this

loss must come from somewhere. In good
years, the profitability of the other business
es under the umbrella organization might
make up for one faltering business. But in
bad years especially when the stock mar
ket heads south the ASSU either must
make up for its loss out of its endowment or
must take on more debt to pay for this loss.
Neither of these options is a good solution.
One of Stanford Student Enterprises's
missions is to train future business leaders. It
is true that the Stanford Store whether
profitable or not does give students valu
able leadership experience. But what kind of
leaders is Stanford Student Enterprises
training when it allows them to run busi
nesses in perpetuity without turning a prof
it? Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron, comes
to mind.

Although the Stanford Store provides
some competition to the Stanford Book
store, it is not an effective competitor. Its lo
cation effectively precludes this possibility.
Even if the Stanford Store were filled with
people all day long thus proving that it
actually competes with the Bookstore
we do not believe that the principle of com
petition alone justifies the continued exis
tence of Stanford Student Enterprises's
brainchild.

The Stanford Store was undeniably a nice
idea. But a lot of nice ideas like the sum
mer bomb "Gigli" â€”just don't work out in
real life. We hope that Stanford Student En
terprises will realize that it's holding a pair of
3s to the Bookstore's Royal Flush. Even a
poker novice would fold before losing any
more money.
