# Keep Moscow's doors open
## 
### 
By the end of this academic year, the
Stanford in Moscow center will
close its doors. Although officials
from the Overseas Studies Pro
gram claim that the temporary hiatus is nec
essary because of budget constraints, it is our
opinion that an alternative approach should
be adopted to allow the Moscow program to
remain open.

Amos Nur, director of the Overseas Stud
ies Program, predicts that a more cost-effec
tive center could re-open in Moscow in 2005.
We believe this plan puts students at a disad
vantage who intend to study in Moscow
early next year especially given the fact
that most students, when putting together
their four-year plans, decide to leave a quar
ter of junior year open for studying abroad.
But now, as a result of the announcement to
shut Russia's doors to Stanford students,
those who want to study in Moscow will
need to drastically change their plans.
Program officials cite cost as the reason
for closing the program. Fixed expenses,

they say, have raised the per-student price of
the Stanford in Moscow center to pro
hibitive heights as student participation has
declined in recent years, and administrators
hope to establish a new center that is affili
ated with an existing institution in Moscow
to help lower these costs.

But by closing the program, the Overseas
Studies Program is shirking its commitment
to helping educate students on Russia and
Eastern European cultures. Although the So
viet Union has fallen, Russia remains a major
power in the global community. In fact, the
accelerating economy of the country elevates
the Moscow program's relevance in today's
interconnected global community.
Overseas Studies Program's plan to re
institute a Moscow center by the spring of
2005 does not fulfill the needs of current
students sophomores in particular. The
Overseas Studies Program should re-think
its plan for Russia and meet the needs of
students who are left out in the cold by its
decision.
