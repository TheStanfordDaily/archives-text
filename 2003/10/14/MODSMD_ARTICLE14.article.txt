Students comment on
Full Moon on the Quad
I don't know what the statistics
show, but to the naked eye, it seems
like there were a lot more alcohol
related ambulance rides this year at
Full Moon on the Quad than ever
before. I don't know what the ad
ministration is officially attributing
this to, but any reasonable, objec
tive, mildly intelligent observer
might conclude that the new strict
policies are back firing and acting-
Dean of Students Chris Griffith and
Residential Education have to start
answering some tough questions.
It's hard to see how any of the op
pressive new rules could foster a
safer environment in any world that
models itself after reality.
My first experience of this was
when I decided to call an ambulance
for a friend who had had a lot too
much to drink. It was a tough call,
because it seemed like he could
have made it through, but I wanted
to err on the side of safety, so I di
aled 911. Busy. 9-911. An ambu
lance was sent, which arrived in a
reasonable amount of time, but the
first people to get to his room were
from the Department of Public
Safety. At first, we all mistook them
for actual help. We soon realized
that they weren't there to answer
questions or to perform any medical
procedures. They just wanted to
know if the University could get in
trouble for what had happened.
Once they were reassured that no li
ability issues existed, they proceed
ed to hang around and get in the way
of the paramedics the people
who we actually wanted there in the
first place. Afterward, my sick
friend had to deal with meetings,
penalties and other hassles that
ResEd puts one through. Next time,
we won't call the ambulance when
faced with a judgment call.

Look at some of their other
flawed solutions to problems:
(1) Putting as many fraternities
on probation as conceivably possi
ble. No registered parties for the
campus. Bummer. Know what's
more fun? Unregistered parties.
(2) Banning alcohol in public
spaces in freshman dorms. Solution:
private spaces. Oh well. It's cooler
when there are no experienced
drinkers around to tell you you're
being a little overzealous.
(3) Placing undercover cops at
parties to hand out MIPs. Solutions:
Don't register the party, drink
enough at 9 p.m. to keep you drunk
until 2 a.m. and make your articles
of clothing running shoes (Po-po ...
GO!).

The new brilliant idea is to end
the age-old tradition of Full Moon
on the Quad. Maybe they'll be mild
ly successful in doing this. Maybe it
won't be Full Moon on the Quad
anymore but Full Moon on the Paly
High School football field and the
whole campus will bike and drive
there and it will take a fatal accident
to realize it's one of the dumbest
ideas since 50-year-old men with
video cameras at Exotic Erotic.
Right now, we should be thankful
that the only evidence we have that
either the rules or the intentions of
the administration are flawed is a
few happy ambulance rides to Stan
ford Hospital.
In The Daily's Full Moon article
("Full Moon's future cloudy," Oct.
13), the administration claims the
spikes in the alcohol-incident chart
are attributable to students' lack of
responsibility. I think it's easier to
make the case that the administra
tors are simply incompetent in their
abilities to keep the students safe.
Not enough people are blaming the
administration for the school's alco
hol problems and it's time we asked
them to do their jobs which means
putting student safety over and
above Stanford's liability concerns.

I am writing this letter in re
sponse to the Stanford administra
tion's threat to end one of the last
remnants of fun on this campus,
namely Full Moon on the Quad.
First, the idea that alcohol can be
removed from Full Moon on the
Quad is crazy. Alcohol has been an
effective social lubricant for thou
sands of years, and it is desperately
needed when you have 3,000 social
ly awkward kids playing spin the
bottle. Institutionalized sobriety is
something that the federal govern
ment gave up on long ago: Stanford
cannot stop people from drinking,
and I'm amazed that officials are
clueless enough to think that they
can. Stanford can ban every social
activity on campus, but debauchery
will happen regardless. Stanford has

two choices when dealing with this:
pressure people not to drink, but
they will just get drunk elsewhere;
or accept that people will drink and
simply encourage people not to
overdo it. "Beer before liquor,
you'll never be sicker" is probably
more sound advice for freshmen
than "let's all have root beer floats!"
Next, having four people in the
hospital and two arrests at an event
with around 3,000 people really
isn't that bad of a record. Visit a
large nightclub or concert and
you'll realize that when you get a
lot of people together, someone
will probably be drunk, and some
one might get arrested. It happens.
This doesn't justify giving a long
running tradition the kiss-off, espe
cially when people don't have to
drive to get there. Rioting is a rea
son to ban something, six very
drunk people out of 3,000 is not.
The Stanford administration's
threat reminds me of a sign I saw at
the beginning of the year: "Stan
ford: Where Fun Goes to Die." As
Homer Simpson once said, "It's
funny because it's true."

In response to the article "Full
Moon's future cloudy"on Oct. 13,1
strongly disagree with the Universi
ty's proposal to halt the tradition of
Full Moon on the Quad next year.
University's officials "rolled"
down the wrong slippery slope and
blamed the traditional Full Moon
on the Quad for the intoxications
and eventual hospitalizations. They
believe that cancelling the activity
would avoid alcohol intoxications
from happening again on campus.
This is the same as hypothesizing
that the number of alcohol intoxica
tions will decrease if the number of
student activities decreases. If the
hypothesis is true, the University
should ban all activities that involve
more than one student, since any
group activities and gathering will
create potential cases of alcohol in
toxications. If the argument holds
true, the University should dissolve
all student organizations, fraterni
ties and other campus groups.
The core of the problem is the
lack of alternative activities on
campus or in the neighborhood.
Freshmeji are not allowed to have
cars on campus and activities on
campus are the only channels for
them to interact with other students
in a social manner. Instead of trying
to crack down the number of alco
hol intoxication cases, the Universi
ty should co-operate with Counsel
ing and Psychological Services and
other peer advising groups to pro
vide other activities for students.
Education and raising public
awareness are the first moves that
University officials should take to
curb the increasing number of alco
hol violations.

Russia is still Exciting'
"Once the Soviet Union col
lapsed [Russia] wasn't that exciting
any more," said Geophysics Prof.
Amos Nur, director of the Overseas
Studies Program, in The Daily
("Stanford in Moscow will close this
year," Oct. 9). I beg to disagree with
my good friend and colleague: Rus
sia and the rest of the former Soviet
Union have become different and
more, rather than less, interesting
since the collapse of the Soviet
Union and its hold on Eastern Eu
rope. Where there were only nine
states there are now 27. Stanford's
Moscow Program has been a gate
way for Stanford undergraduates,
not only to Russia, which stretches
from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of
Japan and the Pacific Ocean, but
also the countries of East-Central
Europe, the Baltic states as well as
the rest of the region that has grown
in geo-strategic importance the
predominantly Islamic Central
Asia.
To concentrate on Russia, since
the fall of communism, Russia has
become, perhaps, the most contest
ed terrain for the struggle of democ
racy and the rule of law against
despotism, environmentalism
against predatory exploitation of
natural resources, enlightened fed
eralism against imperialism and Is
lamic extremism, international co
operation and economic integration
against confrontation and power
politics. It's gross domestic product
has been growing at a steady 6 to 7
percent annual rate. With a 40 per
cent annual increase, Russia's has
been one of the fastest growing
emerging markets. Cultural life in

Russia is booming and has been a
growing presence in Europe and the
United States (closer to home, e.g.,
Mariinsky Ballet performing at
Zellerbach in Berkeley). To make
things even more exciting, Russia
has the largest stockpile of biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear weapons
outside the United States. Policy
and opinion makers in the U.S., in
cluding President Bush, have shown
a growing respect for and interest in
Russia. In the last few days, Russia
has been the only country that has
consistently shared the front page of
The New York Times with Iraq and
California gubernatorial campaign.
It is gratifying to know that Stan
ford is well positioned to be one of
the leading world centers for the
study of Russia and the region.
Among the area studies at Stanford
Russian, East-European and
Eurasian studies have no peer and
hold their own against any other
university in the United States. Our
library and archival resources, in
cluding those of the Hoover Institu
tion, are second to none. The ten
year-old Moscow program has been
integrated into the academic pro
grams here on campus. Its numbers
have been fluctuating over the
years, but since 1997 the enroll
ments in the fall quarter program
have kept at 18 students per year.
We hope that in the course of the re
structuring, Overseas Studies Pro
gram and the academic programs
will find ways to promote the pro
gram on campus in order to increase
the enrollments. But in terms of
numbers, because being in Russia
requires some knowledge of the lan
guage, the Moscow Program will
never compete with Oxford and
Australia, or Madrid and China
(given the numbers of legacy speak
ers of Spanish and Chinese). Yet, in
terms of faculty and graduate stu
dent involvement, the breadth of of
ferings, the quality of academic and
on-site experience for the under
graduates, the Moscow program
and many alumni agree has been
absolutely first-rate.
This is not to say that the program
cannot be improved or made more
cost-effective. The Stanford faculty
in the area of Russian East-European
and Eurasian Studies stand ready to
help facilitate the restructuring Nur
has in mind for the program. We look
forward to a fruitful and successful
collaboration.

Faculty Senate rightfully renewed
support for Sit

I am delighted by the decision of
the Faculty Senate to support the Stu
dent Initiated Courses program. As
someone who has had the opportuni
ty to both participate in student-initi
ated classes and to teach one, I am re
ally appreciative of the opportunity
these courses provide for students to
share their intellectual and personal
passions with other students, as well
as to develop their teaching abilities.
Many students share the con
cerns of the faculty that the courses
should maintain a high-quality stan
dard and would welcome more fac
ulty involvement in creating and
teaching them. Thank you for con
tinuing to believe in the program.

More e-waste management
programs are needed
As a student who was working at
the actual Dell computer recycling
event Saturday, I want to commend
both the recycling event organizers
and the students who continued to
voice their concerns over general e
waste management. I wouldn't call
them protesters, since they thanked
both the people who brought in their
computers and us for the recycling
service. Passionate individuals and
nonprofit organizations are what
brought attention to toxic computer
waste issues in the first place. With
so much more that needs to be done,
I appreciate all efforts to spread
the word about the social and envi
ronmental implications of the im
proper disposal of e-waste. The
event was a great success with over
1,000 people bringing in their obso
lete computers for safe reuse or re
cycling, and I hope that newly in
formed community members work
to make future e-waste management
programs happen in the future.

would avoid alcohol intoxications
from happening again on campus.
This is the same as hypothesizing
that the number of alcohol intoxica
tions will decrease if the number of
student activities decreases. If the
hypothesis is true, the University
should ban all activities that involve
more than one student, since any
group activities and gathering will
create potential cases of alcohol in
toxications. If the argument holds
true, the University should dissolve
all student organizations, fraterni
ties and other campus groups.
The core of the problem is the
lack of alternative activities on
campus or in the neighborhood.
Freshmeji are not allowed to have
cars on campus and activities on
campus are the only channels for
them to interact with other students
in a social manner. Instead of trying
to crack down the number of alco
hol intoxication cases, the Universi
ty should co-operate with Counsel
ing and Psychological Services and
other peer advising groups to pro
vide other activities for students.
Education and raising public
awareness are the first moves that
University officials should take to
curb the increasing number of alco
hol violations.

Russia is still Exciting'
"Once the Soviet Union col
lapsed [Russia] wasn't that exciting
any more," said Geophysics Prof.
Amos Nur, director of the Overseas
Studies Program, in The Daily
("Stanford in Moscow will close this
year," Oct. 9). I beg to disagree with
my good friend and colleague: Rus
sia and the rest of the former Soviet
Union have become different and
more, rather than less, interesting
since the collapse of the Soviet
Union and its hold on Eastern Eu
rope. Where there were only nine
states there are now 27. Stanford's
Moscow Program has been a gate
way for Stanford undergraduates,
not only to Russia, which stretches
from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of
Japan and the Pacific Ocean, but
also the countries of East-Central
Europe, the Baltic states as well as
the rest of the region that has grown
in geo-strategic importance the
predominantly Islamic Central
Asia.
To concentrate on Russia, since
the fall of communism, Russia has
become, perhaps, the most contest
ed terrain for the struggle of democ
racy and the rule of law against
despotism, environmentalism
against predatory exploitation of
natural resources, enlightened fed
eralism against imperialism and Is
lamic extremism, international co
operation and economic integration
against confrontation and power
politics. It's gross domestic product
has been growing at a steady 6 to 7
percent annual rate. With a 40 per
cent annual increase, Russia's has
been one of the fastest growing
emerging markets. Cultural life in

Russia is booming and has been a
growing presence in Europe and the
United States (closer to home, e.g.,
Mariinsky Ballet performing at
Zellerbach in Berkeley). To make
things even more exciting, Russia
has the largest stockpile of biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear weapons
outside the United States. Policy
and opinion makers in the U.S., in
cluding President Bush, have shown
a growing respect for and interest in
Russia. In the last few days, Russia
has been the only country that has
consistently shared the front page of
The New York Times with Iraq and
California gubernatorial campaign.
It is gratifying to know that Stan
ford is well positioned to be one of
the leading world centers for the
study of Russia and the region.
Among the area studies at Stanford
Russian, East-European and
Eurasian studies have no peer and
hold their own against any other
university in the United States. Our
library and archival resources, in
cluding those of the Hoover Institu
tion, are second to none. The ten
year-old Moscow program has been
integrated into the academic pro
grams here on campus. Its numbers
have been fluctuating over the
years, but since 1997 the enroll
ments in the fall quarter program
have kept at 18 students per year.
We hope that in the course of the re
structuring, Overseas Studies Pro
gram and the academic programs
will find ways to promote the pro
gram on campus in order to increase
the enrollments. But in terms of
numbers, because being in Russia
requires some knowledge of the lan
guage, the Moscow Program will
never compete with Oxford and
Australia, or Madrid and China
(given the numbers of legacy speak
ers of Spanish and Chinese). Yet, in
terms of faculty and graduate stu
dent involvement, the breadth of of
ferings, the quality of academic and
on-site experience for the under
graduates, the Moscow program
and many alumni agree has been
absolutely first-rate.
This is not to say that the program
cannot be improved or made more
cost-effective. The Stanford faculty
in the area of Russian East-European
and Eurasian Studies stand ready to
help facilitate the restructuring Nur
has in mind for the program. We look
forward to a fruitful and successful
collaboration.

More e-waste management
programs are needed
As a student who was working at
the actual Dell computer recycling
event Saturday, I want to commend
both the recycling event organizers
and the students who continued to
voice their concerns over general e
waste management. I wouldn't call
them protesters, since they thanked
both the people who brought in their
computers and us for the recycling
service. Passionate individuals and
nonprofit organizations are what
brought attention to toxic computer
waste issues in the first place. With
so much more that needs to be done,
I appreciate all efforts to spread
the word about the social and envi
ronmental implications of the im
proper disposal of e-waste. The
event was a great success with over
1,000 people bringing in their obso
lete computers for safe reuse or re
cycling, and I hope that newly in
formed community members work
to make future e-waste management
programs happen in the future.

Students comment on
Full Moon on the Quad
I don't know what the statistics
show, but to the naked eye, it seems
like there were a lot more alcohol
related ambulance rides this year at
Full Moon on the Quad than ever
before. I don't know what the ad
ministration is officially attributing
this to, but any reasonable, objec
tive, mildly intelligent observer
might conclude that the new strict
policies are back firing and acting-
Dean of Students Chris Griffith and
Residential Education have to start
answering some tough questions.
It's hard to see how any of the op
pressive new rules could foster a
safer environment in any world that
models itself after reality.
My first experience of this was
when I decided to call an ambulance
for a friend who had had a lot too
much to drink. It was a tough call,
because it seemed like he could
have made it through, but I wanted
to err on the side of safety, so I di
aled 911. Busy. 9-911. An ambu
lance was sent, which arrived in a
reasonable amount of time, but the
first people to get to his room were
from the Department of Public
Safety. At first, we all mistook them
for actual help. We soon realized
that they weren't there to answer
questions or to perform any medical
procedures. They just wanted to
know if the University could get in
trouble for what had happened.
Once they were reassured that no li
ability issues existed, they proceed
ed to hang around and get in the way
of the paramedics the people
who we actually wanted there in the
first place. Afterward, my sick
friend had to deal with meetings,
penalties and other hassles that
ResEd puts one through. Next time,
we won't call the ambulance when
faced with a judgment call.

Look at some of their other
flawed solutions to problems:
(1) Putting as many fraternities
on probation as conceivably possi
ble. No registered parties for the
campus. Bummer. Know what's
more fun? Unregistered parties.
(2) Banning alcohol in public
spaces in freshman dorms. Solution:
private spaces. Oh well. It's cooler
when there are no experienced
drinkers around to tell you you're
being a little overzealous.
(3) Placing undercover cops at
parties to hand out MIPs. Solutions:
Don't register the party, drink
enough at 9 p.m. to keep you drunk
until 2 a.m. and make your articles
of clothing running shoes (Po-po ...
GO!).

The new brilliant idea is to end
the age-old tradition of Full Moon
on the Quad. Maybe they'll be mild
ly successful in doing this. Maybe it
won't be Full Moon on the Quad
anymore but Full Moon on the Paly
High School football field and the
whole campus will bike and drive
there and it will take a fatal accident
to realize it's one of the dumbest
ideas since 50-year-old men with
video cameras at Exotic Erotic.
Right now, we should be thankful
that the only evidence we have that
either the rules or the intentions of
the administration are flawed is a
few happy ambulance rides to Stan
ford Hospital.
In The Daily's Full Moon article
("Full Moon's future cloudy," Oct.
13), the administration claims the
spikes in the alcohol-incident chart
are attributable to students' lack of
responsibility. I think it's easier to
make the case that the administra
tors are simply incompetent in their
abilities to keep the students safe.
Not enough people are blaming the
administration for the school's alco
hol problems and it's time we asked
them to do their jobs which means
putting student safety over and
above Stanford's liability concerns.
A.J. MAGNUSON
Senior, Symbolic Systems
I am writing this letter in re
sponse to the Stanford administra
tion's threat to end one of the last
remnants of fun on this campus,
namely Full Moon on the Quad.
First, the idea that alcohol can be
removed from Full Moon on the
Quad is crazy. Alcohol has been an
effective social lubricant for thou
sands of years, and it is desperately
needed when you have 3,000 social
ly awkward kids playing spin the
bottle. Institutionalized sobriety is
something that the federal govern
ment gave up on long ago: Stanford
cannot stop people from drinking,
and I'm amazed that officials are
clueless enough to think that they
can. Stanford can ban every social
activity on campus, but debauchery
will happen regardless. Stanford has

two choices when dealing with this:
pressure people not to drink, but
they will just get drunk elsewhere;
or accept that people will drink and
simply encourage people not to
overdo it. "Beer before liquor,
you'll never be sicker" is probably
more sound advice for freshmen
than "let's all have root beer floats!"
Next, having four people in the
hospital and two arrests at an event
with around 3,000 people really
isn't that bad of a record. Visit a
large nightclub or concert and
you'll realize that when you get a
lot of people together, someone
will probably be drunk, and some
one might get arrested. It happens.
This doesn't justify giving a long
running tradition the kiss-off, espe
cially when people don't have to
drive to get there. Rioting is a rea
son to ban something, six very
drunk people out of 3,000 is not.
The Stanford administration's
threat reminds me of a sign I saw at
the beginning of the year: "Stan
ford: Where Fun Goes to Die." As
Homer Simpson once said, "It's
funny because it's true."

In response to the article "Full

strongly disagree with the Universi

so much more that needs to be done,
I appreciate all efforts to spread

Students comment on
Full Moon on the Quad
I don't know what the statistics
show, but to the naked eye, it seems
like there were a lot more alcohol
related ambulance rides this year at
Full Moon on the Quad than ever
before. I don't know what the ad
ministration is officially attributing
this to, but any reasonable, objec
tive, mildly intelligent observer
might conclude that the new strict
policies are back firing and acting-
Dean of Students Chris Griffith and
Residential Education have to start
answering some tough questions.
It's hard to see how any of the op
pressive new rules could foster a
safer environment in any world that
models itself after reality.
My first experience of this was
when I decided to call an ambulance
for a friend who had had a lot too
much to drink. It was a tough call,
because it seemed like he could
have made it through, but I wanted
to err on the side of safety, so I di
aled 911. Busy. 9-911. An ambu
lance was sent, which arrived in a
reasonable amount of time, but the
first people to get to his room were
from the Department of Public
Safety. At first, we all mistook them
for actual help. We soon realized
that they weren't there to answer
questions or to perform any medical
procedures. They just wanted to
know if the University could get in
trouble for what had happened.
Once they were reassured that no li
ability issues existed, they proceed
ed to hang around and get in the way
of the paramedics the people
who we actually wanted there in the
first place. Afterward, my sick
friend had to deal with meetings,
penalties and other hassles that
ResEd puts one through. Next time,
we won't call the ambulance when
faced with a judgment call.

Look at some of their other
flawed solutions to problems:
(1) Putting as many fraternities
on probation as conceivably possi
ble. No registered parties for the
campus. Bummer. Know what's
more fun? Unregistered parties.
(2) Banning alcohol in public
spaces in freshman dorms. Solution:
private spaces. Oh well. It's cooler
when there are no experienced
drinkers around to tell you you're
being a little overzealous.
(3) Placing undercover cops at
parties to hand out MIPs. Solutions:
Don't register the party, drink
enough at 9 p.m. to keep you drunk
until 2 a.m. and make your articles
of clothing running shoes (Po-po ...
GO!).

The new brilliant idea is to end
the age-old tradition of Full Moon
on the Quad. Maybe they'll be mild
ly successful in doing this. Maybe it
won't be Full Moon on the Quad
anymore but Full Moon on the Paly
High School football field and the
whole campus will bike and drive
there and it will take a fatal accident
to realize it's one of the dumbest
ideas since 50-year-old men with
video cameras at Exotic Erotic.
Right now, we should be thankful
that the only evidence we have that
either the rules or the intentions of
the administration are flawed is a
few happy ambulance rides to Stan
ford Hospital.
In The Daily's Full Moon article
("Full Moon's future cloudy," Oct.
13), the administration claims the
spikes in the alcohol-incident chart
are attributable to students' lack of
responsibility. I think it's easier to
make the case that the administra
tors are simply incompetent in their
abilities to keep the students safe.
Not enough people are blaming the
administration for the school's alco
hol problems and it's time we asked
them to do their jobs which means
putting student safety over and
above Stanford's liability concerns.

I am writing this letter in re
sponse to the Stanford administra
tion's threat to end one of the last
remnants of fun on this campus,
namely Full Moon on the Quad.
First, the idea that alcohol can be
removed from Full Moon on the
Quad is crazy. Alcohol has been an
effective social lubricant for thou
sands of years, and it is desperately
needed when you have 3,000 social
ly awkward kids playing spin the
bottle. Institutionalized sobriety is
something that the federal govern
ment gave up on long ago: Stanford
cannot stop people from drinking,
and I'm amazed that officials are
clueless enough to think that they
can. Stanford can ban every social
activity on campus, but debauchery
will happen regardless. Stanford has

two choices when dealing with this:
pressure people not to drink, but
they will just get drunk elsewhere;
or accept that people will drink and
simply encourage people not to
overdo it. "Beer before liquor,
you'll never be sicker" is probably
more sound advice for freshmen
than "let's all have root beer floats!"
Next, having four people in the
hospital and two arrests at an event
with around 3,000 people really
isn't that bad of a record. Visit a
large nightclub or concert and
you'll realize that when you get a
lot of people together, someone
will probably be drunk, and some
one might get arrested. It happens.
This doesn't justify giving a long
running tradition the kiss-off, espe
cially when people don't have to
drive to get there. Rioting is a rea
son to ban something, six very
drunk people out of 3,000 is not.
The Stanford administration's
threat reminds me of a sign I saw at
the beginning of the year: "Stan
ford: Where Fun Goes to Die." As
Homer Simpson once said, "It's
funny because it's true."

In response to the article "Full
Moon's future cloudy"on Oct. 13,1
strongly disagree with the Universi
ty's proposal to halt the tradition of
Full Moon on the Quad next year.
University's officials "rolled"
down the wrong slippery slope and
blamed the traditional Full Moon
on the Quad for the intoxications
and eventual hospitalizations. They
believe that cancelling the activity
would avoid alcohol intoxications
from happening again on campus.
This is the same as hypothesizing
that the number of alcohol intoxica
tions will decrease if the number of
student activities decreases. If the
hypothesis is true, the University
should ban all activities that involve
more than one student, since any
group activities and gathering will
create potential cases of alcohol in
toxications. If the argument holds
true, the University should dissolve
all student organizations, fraterni
ties and other campus groups.
The core of the problem is the
lack of alternative activities on
campus or in the neighborhood.
Freshmeji are not allowed to have
cars on campus and activities on
campus are the only channels for
them to interact with other students
in a social manner. Instead of trying
to crack down the number of alco
hol intoxication cases, the Universi
ty should co-operate with Counsel
ing and Psychological Services and
other peer advising groups to pro
vide other activities for students.
Education and raising public
awareness are the first moves that
University officials should take to
curb the increasing number of alco
hol violations.

Russia is still Exciting'
"Once the Soviet Union col
lapsed [Russia] wasn't that exciting
any more," said Geophysics Prof.
Amos Nur, director of the Overseas
Studies Program, in The Daily
("Stanford in Moscow will close this
year," Oct. 9). I beg to disagree with
my good friend and colleague: Rus
sia and the rest of the former Soviet
Union have become different and
more, rather than less, interesting
since the collapse of the Soviet
Union and its hold on Eastern Eu
rope. Where there were only nine
states there are now 27. Stanford's
Moscow Program has been a gate
way for Stanford undergraduates,
not only to Russia, which stretches
from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of
Japan and the Pacific Ocean, but
also the countries of East-Central
Europe, the Baltic states as well as
the rest of the region that has grown
in geo-strategic importance the
predominantly Islamic Central
Asia.
To concentrate on Russia, since
the fall of communism, Russia has
become, perhaps, the most contest
ed terrain for the struggle of democ
racy and the rule of law against
despotism, environmentalism
against predatory exploitation of
natural resources, enlightened fed
eralism against imperialism and Is
lamic extremism, international co
operation and economic integration
against confrontation and power
politics. It's gross domestic product
has been growing at a steady 6 to 7
percent annual rate. With a 40 per
cent annual increase, Russia's has
been one of the fastest growing
emerging markets. Cultural life in

Russia is booming and has been a
growing presence in Europe and the
United States (closer to home, e.g.,
Mariinsky Ballet performing at
Zellerbach in Berkeley). To make
things even more exciting, Russia
has the largest stockpile of biologi
cal, chemical and nuclear weapons
outside the United States. Policy
and opinion makers in the U.S., in
cluding President Bush, have shown
a growing respect for and interest in
Russia. In the last few days, Russia
has been the only country that has
consistently shared the front page of
The New York Times with Iraq and
California gubernatorial campaign.
It is gratifying to know that Stan
ford is well positioned to be one of
the leading world centers for the
study of Russia and the region.
Among the area studies at Stanford
Russian, East-European and
Eurasian studies have no peer and
hold their own against any other
university in the United States. Our
library and archival resources, in
cluding those of the Hoover Institu
tion, are second to none. The ten
year-old Moscow program has been
integrated into the academic pro
grams here on campus. Its numbers
have been fluctuating over the
years, but since 1997 the enroll
ments in the fall quarter program
have kept at 18 students per year.
We hope that in the course of the re
structuring, Overseas Studies Pro
gram and the academic programs
will find ways to promote the pro
gram on campus in order to increase
the enrollments. But in terms of
numbers, because being in Russia
requires some knowledge of the lan
guage, the Moscow Program will
never compete with Oxford and
Australia, or Madrid and China
(given the numbers of legacy speak
ers of Spanish and Chinese). Yet, in
terms of faculty and graduate stu
dent involvement, the breadth of of
ferings, the quality of academic and
on-site experience for the under
graduates, the Moscow program
and many alumni agree has been
absolutely first-rate.
This is not to say that the program
cannot be improved or made more
cost-effective. The Stanford faculty
in the area of Russian East-European
and Eurasian Studies stand ready to
help facilitate the restructuring Nur
has in mind for the program. We look
forward to a fruitful and successful
collaboration.

Faculty Senate rightfully renewed

I am delighted by the decision of
the Faculty Senate to support the Stu

someone who has had the opportuni

these courses provide for students to
share their intellectual and personal

Many students share the con

teaching them. Thank you for con

More e-waste management

As a student who was working at
the actual Dell computer recycling
event Saturday, I want to commend
both the recycling event organizers
and the students who continued to

them protesters, since they thanked
both the people who brought in their

nonprofit organizations are what
brought attention to toxic computer

so much more that needs to be done,
I appreciate all efforts to spread
