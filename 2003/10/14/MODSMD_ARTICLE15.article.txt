# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## Full Moon on the Quad adds to campus life, as long as you're ready for mono 
### 
Last Thursday night during Full
Moon on the Quad, this campus
didn't look like the Stanford I
know.

Of course I'm not speaking from per
sonal experience. I learned of Full Moon
on the Quad my first week here from a few
3Ls in the know. (They also taught me
"3L" means third-year law student.)
I planned on making my way to the
Quad at midnight on the appointed
evening not to prey on freshmen boys,
mind you. And I would not have been
armed with the recommended lip balm
and bottle of Listerine, but instead I
planned to go with a pen and paper to doc
ument this whole torrid evening of drunk
en kiss-making because I'm a journalist
and that's what we do. We document stuff.

I may well be the only one suffering
from the flu / mono / strep that stayed
home that night well, if you believe the
health reports from Wednesday's Stan
ford Daily, anyway. The word is you are
more apt to be stricken with a life-altering

germ at the kiss-fest on the Quad than if
you licked a hospital floor, and those are
your odds even if you wore a dental dam
Thursday night.
So that's right. I stayed home with my
Kleenex and missed an event so spectacu
lar that it's one of Sports Illustrated's rea
sons to attend our school and also merits a
write-up in the high-gloss Stanford circu
lars that go to prospective students and (il
logically) their parents.
Curious about the goings-on, I inquired
among students at Branner and Kimball.

What I learned is that Full Moon on the
Quad is a time-honored tradition that
dates back almost a century, when men
outnumbered women on campus 10 to
one. The whole scam was probably
cooked-up by some hard-up seniors who
convinced the freshmen women that they
had to meet on the Quad and kiss them if
they wanted to receive credit for then
classes. This was before the days of urban
legends.com, so it was easier to pass "tra
ditions" off.
And so it went as a quiet rite of passage

attended only by senior
men and freshmen
women (no, really, just
registered seniors and
freshmen) for decades. ]
And then, somewhere \
along the line, it got %
crazy. Everyone wanted j
a piece of the action.
Some say the expansion ;j
of the night started with L
the wide-spread decep

tion of the Watergate era, but eventually
just anyone started showing up all
classes and even non-students to steal
kisses by impersonating a senior or fresh
man. â€¢

Music, drunken revelry, nudity and
even some unintended unpleasantness
were the norm. It was only a matter of
time before it would then become a struc
tured evening of restraint with scheduled
musical guests, security detail, commit
tees to discuss comfort boundaries and
even a Safe Zone manned with school
representatives.

"It was like a massive orgy," said Chris
Wallis, a senior from Sacramento, of the
experience just a few short years ago.
"Now it's more sedate."
This year, the University implemented
revisions to its Alcohol Policy that prohib
it the customary frosh dorm pre-party
boozing.
"That and all the articles about getting sick
scared people this year," said Will Bullock, a
senior and head peer academic coordinator at
Branner. "There was more talk about safety,
gropers basically more stress on the nega
tive side of the Full Moon [event]."
"It wasn't what I thought it would be,"
said Ryan Fortune, a freshman from Palo
Alto. "I heard about it all during Admit
Week and everyone was talking about it,
but it ended up being kind of awkward."
"I heard lots of excuses to not kiss," said
"Michelle," a freshman from Palo Alto
who didn't want to reveal her real name
for fear that her parents might know she
attended the event. "People [said], 'l'm a
sophomore,' 'I have mono,' 'l'm looking
for my friends.' But there did seem to be a

lot of making out going on."
That's the way of harmless traditions; li
ability changes everything. Indeed, every
year there is some kind of "incident." Un
wanted sexual advances or alcohol poison
ings top the list. (This year four Stanford
students were hospitalized with alcohol
poisoning and two others were arrested on
alcohol-related charges.)
But for all of its real or imagined dan
gers and silliness, for one night Stanford
sounded alive. The strains of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band broke through my Nyquil-induced
haze, and I realized for the first time that
there is more to Stanford nightlife than
the swarm of bike-peddling chemistry stu
dents that race through the campus after
midnight.
And for any of you who made the mis
take of kissing the Tree, I still have some
Nyquil and vitamin C you can borrow.
