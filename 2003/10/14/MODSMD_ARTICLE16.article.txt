# THE 						BOTTOM LINE
## Homeless people on campus need our help 
### 
Stanford is an institution that prides itself on fos
tering a sense of social responsibility among its
students. When Tom Wasow, professor of phi
losophy and linguistics, noted the contrast be
tween the "booming affluence around Stanford" and
the poverty in the surrounding communities several
years ago, the University community rose to the cause.
Under pressure from local residents, the city of Palo
Alto has since made slow but steady progress in ad
dressing homelessness, including plans for the construc
tion of the Opportunity Center, which is a new drop-in
facility that wall be located near Town and Country Vil
lage. Stanford students, faculty and staff, along with or
ganizations like campus minister Jim Burklo's Urban
Ministry, have made tremendous strides in improving
resources for the homeless in nearby areas and increas
ing awareness of local poverty through fundraising and
volunteering in shelters.
However, the University's own homeless population
has not been assisted or even mentioned in these
recent efforts.

Stanford is not the ivory tower it may seem to be, and
it is certainly not immune to the problems afflicting sur
rounding communities. There is indeed a homeless pres
ence at Stanford, although not to the same degree as
communities outside campus. These individuals sleep in

campus buildings and walk among
students, faculty and staff every day.
I first met a woman who I will
call Jane Doe when she came to
my office to ask for the San Francis
co yellow pages. When I told her that
I did not have a copy, Jane stood
there quietly for a moment and then
asked if she could help herself to
some candy from my desk. As soon
as she nearly emptied my candy
dish, I knew Jane was no ordinary
visitor. I suddenly became uneasy

without really knowing why.
I did not confirm my first impression of her until the
next time she stopped by again, just for candy. When
she left, I watched her walk down the sidewalk in the
same black clothes she had worn before to gather four
large duffel bags hidden in some bushes. She glanced re
luctantly over her shoulder at me knowing that her se
cret had been revealed.
Jane was homeless.
I've since seen Jane around campus with her bags. I
know she has spent nights sleeping in University build
ings and days riding around on the Marguerite. Al
though I never gave her any personal details, she knows

my name and is familiar with what my job is. She seems
to want me to notice her.
After these encounters with Jane, I wonder what to
do about the concern I feel, knowing that she and others
like her have no choice but to make Stanford their home.
Currently, the Stanford Police are generally only
contacted when someone wishes to have a homeless per
son removed; they have no means of providing assis
tance to solve the problems faced by homeless individu
als. Is there a resource to contact other than the campus
police?
The Haas Center for Public Service currently spon
sors a handful of student organizations that work on this
issue outside of campus, including Habitat for Humani
ty, Neged Ra'av & the Kennedy Kosher Co-op, Night
Outreach and the Stanford Project on Nutrition. All of
these groups focus primarily on outlying communities.
Currently, there isn't any strong outreach effort tar
geting those in need within Stanford's borders. But the
existence of homelessness on campus clearly demon
strates that it is not merely a tangential issue for the Stan
ford community.
So why aren't more people doing something about it?
