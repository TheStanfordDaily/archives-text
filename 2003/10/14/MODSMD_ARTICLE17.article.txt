## Porter eyes his Dream Job' at ESPN

ring me your finest meats and
3 cheeses for a grand club-
I S house feast, for I am the

"It ain't iffy if it's Griffey."
"And that's his 39th home run, not in this
game: That would be a record."
Every man has his destiny. Every dog his
day. Every Zimmer his tumble on the infield
grass.
Amazingly, writing this column is not my
destiny. I believe I'm destined to bigger and
better things. No, really, I am. OK, so maybe
not, but for the next five minutes, let's just
pretend.
. My destiny, as I see it, is to be on TV every
day, saying phrases like those you see above,
from the Ã¼biquitous "Booya!," to the sub
lime post-error call, "Obviously, he hasn't
watched Tom Emanski's 'Defensive Drills'.

It's endorsed by
Fred McGriff, you know."
My destiny, my fate, my
dream job, is to be a Sports-
Center anchor.
So when I saw that ESPN
was having a contest to be a
Sports Center anchor, the
aptly named "Dream Job
Contest," I jumped at the
chance. I hopped in my car

and tore north on Interstate 280 this Saturday,
pulled up to the Metreon, hopped out and
awaited my destiny.
As with most things, my destiny took its
lovely time to get to me. I stood in line for an
hour or so, waiting with other Sports Center
hopefuls in a stagnant line. They ranged
from college kids like me to 60-year-old
men, fresh off their shift at some unremark
able factory, swearing at Priest Holmes and
how he dominated their (and my) Fantasy
Football team the past week.
There was the token female as well, two
actually: College girls who seemed to be out
of their element at every point in the process.
They reminded me of Charlie Sheen in
"The Arrival" (what an underrated movie),
when he goes into the Alien polluting facto
ry, and everyone in the theatre is screaming
at the screen telling him to get out of there,
but secretly wanting to see what the Aliens
will do to him if they find him. It was exactly
like that.
The weeding-out process started with a
written application that was pretty standard,
just more sports oriented than normal. As we
finished the application, a bouncer ushered us
into a billiards room. This was my first indica
tion that maybe the girls were here for the
wrong reasons they started hitting on the
bouncer.
Our second stage of showing off our stuff
came in the billiards room: A written test,
with 30 sports trivia questions to be complet
ed in seven minutes. This was exactly what
my Sports SAT II idea had been, but these
questions ran the gamut from sheepishly
easy, to absurdly strange, to blatantly impos
sible:
"What college did Michael Jordan go
to?" Answer: UNC
"What actress married Mike Tyson?"
Answer: Robin Givens
"Who was the number two pick in the
1984 NBA draft?" Answer: Uhh.. .Buddy
Teevens?
After the written test, the factory worker
was riding high, he proudly pronounced that
Sam Bowie was the No. 2 pick in 'B4, sand
wiched between Olajuwon and MJ. Of
course, I was seven months old at the time.
The girls, meanwhile, sat at the end of the
table, hoping to slink away as the rest of the
group wondered who the Yankees beat in
the World Series in 2000 (the Mets), what
NBA team Dick Vitale coached (the Cavs),
and how the guy next to me, who OWNS a
Jordan-UNC jersey, said Jordan went to
LSU. The girls, and I'm not making this up,
were talking about their jeans.
What happened next was just cruel. They
shepherded my group of 10 into yet another
room, this time all of us scrunched around a
table with a group leader picking us out at
random and asking us ridiculous questions
about inane and obscure topics. Basically, it
was I-Hum section, and nobody had done
the reading.
The first question the moderator asked
(all of you readers out there who are think
ing I'm a misogynist pig, listen up, the mod
erator was a woman, so there!) was directed
at one of the two girls.
"Diane, give me your top three lineback
ers of all time."
Wait for it. Wait for it. OK, start to giggle.
As poor Diane had a facial expression of
"What's a linebacker?" the rest of the table
happily awaited their turn to answer the
question. I swore I saw the factory worker
drool. The moderator mercifully let her pass
on that question, and didn't make her an
swer another.
Soon enough, it was time for me to shine,
as I was asked one question. My fate, my des
tiny, my dream job, revolved around one
question, one little, measly, cruel question.
It was about hockey. And I hate hockey.
The question?
"Who is the most underrated hockey
