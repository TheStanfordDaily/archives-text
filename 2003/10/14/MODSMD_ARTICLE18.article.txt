# Loss at Cal tough to 'Bear'
## 
### AARON LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
A big streak was finally bro
ken in the "Big Spike" on Satur
day. And for the Cardinal
women's volleyball team, it could
mean big trouble in its quest to
win its 10th Pacific 10 Conference
title in school history.
Twenty one years and 10 days
of frustration came to an end for
California this weekend, as the
Golden Bears (16-0,7-0 Pac-10)
rallied from a 2-1 deficit to de
feat Stanford 30-22,29-31,28-30,
30-28, 15-9 at Haas Pavilion in
Berkeley. It was the first time
Cal defeated the Cardinal since
Oct. 1,1982.
"It's pretty disappointing,"
said sophomore setter Katie
Goldhalm, "It was really hard
for us after the match. We were
giving up points at critical times,
and we just didn't execute our
game plan well enough."
The loss dropped Stanford
(13-3, 6-1 Pac-10) from No. 4 to
No. 7 in the latest AVCA / USA
Today Coaches Poll, while Cal,
off to its best-ever start, moved
into the top five for the first time
in school history.
Frustration stemmed from
the fact that Stanford was in a
position to win its 41st straight
match against its cross-bay
rival: Not only did the Cardi
nal have a 2-1 lead in games, it
also started Game 4 with an 8-
2 lead.
And although Stanford outhit
the Bears .256-.200 in Game 4,
Cal, which was led by junior out
side hitter Mia Jerkov who fin
ished with a match-high 31 kills,
managed to rally back to defeat
the Cardinal 30-28, shifting the
momentum of the entire match,
and also energizing the partisan
crowd of 3,021.
Now, despite the fact that
Pac-10 play is not even
halfway complete, the loss
throws a small bump in the
Cardinal's quest to win at
least a share of the confer
ence title. Top-ranked and
defending NCAA champion
Southern California (16-0, 7-
0 Pac-10), which has won 28
consecutive matches dating
back to last season, has
dropped just one game thus
far, looking unstoppable ever
since they swept matches over
No. 2 Hawai'i and No. 3 Flori
da in the opening tournament
of the year.
At the same time, Stanford's

first conference defeat could
add fuel to the fire as it heads
into its most important home
series of the season, Thursday
and Friday night against
UCLA and USC.
The Cardinal, no doubt, has
vengeful memories after being
defeated by the Women of Troy
at Maples Pavilion last season in
an epic back-and-forth battle,
one in which Stanford failed to
close out with a 14-9 lead in
Game 5.
Goldhahn and her team
mates, who were back in practice
yesterday, are currently focused
solely on the upcoming matches
this weekend.
"If we look too far into [the
conference season], that's going
to mess us up. We're not going to
worry about the standings,"
Goldhahn said. "We're going to
keep that goal of winning the
Pac-10. Teams that are not sup
posed to be beating other teams
have been, so anything is possi
ble. We're always keeping that in
mind."
In its match against Cal, Stan
ford could be commended for
fighting back in Game 2 and
Game 3. The Cardinal trailed 25-
22 in Game 2 and looked as
though it would head into the
locker room down two games be
fore going on a 9-4 run, capped
off by one of junior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani's team-high
25 kills.
Then, the Cardinal fell be
hind 7-2 in Game 3 before taking
control and eventually taking the
tight battle, 30-28 on one of se
nior middle blocker Sara
McGee's 11 kills of the match.
For the Cardinal, freshman
outside hitter Kristin Richards
finished with 17 kills, senior
middle blocker Jenn Harvey
tallied 13 kills, and junior op
posite Jen Hucke hit .600 on
10 attempts.
Still, Stanford was outhit .333-
.266 and was outdug 63-44.
"Everybody on our team
knows that the way we played
against Cal isn't going to win
matches. We're all working on
being smarter volleyball play
ers in general," Goldhahn
said.
Stanford will take on the Bru
ins on Thursday at 7 p.m. and the
Women of Troy on Friday at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion. Live cov
erage of both matches can be

LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman outside hitter Kristin Richards and the No. 7 Cardinal suffered its first conference loss of the season
on Saturday afternoon in Berkeley. Stanford lost to Cal for the first time since October 1,1982. The Cardinal
will be in action this Thursday ana Friday night at Maples Pavilion against UCLA and USC, respectively.
A big streak was finally bro
ken in the "Big Spike" on Satur
day. And for the Cardinal
women's volleyball team, it could
mean big trouble in its quest to
win its 10th Pacific 10 Conference
title in school history.
Twenty one years and 10 days
of frustration came to an end for
California this weekend, as the
Golden Bears (16-0,7-0 Pac-10)
rallied from a 2-1 deficit to de
feat Stanford 30-22,29-31,28-30,
30-28, 15-9 at Haas Pavilion in
Berkeley. It was the first time
Cal defeated the Cardinal since
Oct. 1,1982.
"It's pretty disappointing,"
said sophomore setter Katie
Goldhalm, "It was really hard
for us after the match. We were
giving up points at critical times,
and we just didn't execute our
game plan well enough."
The loss dropped Stanford
(13-3, 6-1 Pac-10) from No. 4 to
No. 7 in the latest AVCA / USA
Today Coaches Poll, while Cal,
off to its best-ever start, moved
into the top five for the first time
in school history.
Frustration stemmed from
the fact that Stanford was in a
position to win its 41st straight
match against its cross-bay
rival: Not only did the Cardi
nal have a 2-1 lead in games, it
also started Game 4 with an 8-
2 lead.
And although Stanford outhit
the Bears .256-.200 in Game 4,
Cal, which was led by junior out
side hitter Mia Jerkov who fin
ished with a match-high 31 kills,
managed to rally back to defeat
the Cardinal 30-28, shifting the
momentum of the entire match,
and also energizing the partisan
crowd of 3,021.
Now, despite the fact that
Pac-10 play is not even
halfway complete, the loss
throws a small bump in the
Cardinal's quest to win at
least a share of the confer
ence title. Top-ranked and
defending NCAA champion
Southern California (16-0, 7-
0 Pac-10), which has won 28
consecutive matches dating
back to last season, has
dropped just one game thus
far, looking unstoppable ever
since they swept matches over
No. 2 Hawai'i and No. 3 Flori
da in the opening tournament
of the year.
At the same time, Stanford's

first conference defeat could
add fuel to the fire as it heads
into its most important home
series of the season, Thursday
and Friday night against
UCLA and USC.
The Cardinal, no doubt, has
vengeful memories after being
defeated by the Women of Troy
at Maples Pavilion last season in
an epic back-and-forth battle,
one in which Stanford failed to
close out with a 14-9 lead in
Game 5.
Goldhahn and her team
mates, who were back in practice
yesterday, are currently focused
solely on the upcoming matches
this weekend.
"If we look too far into [the
conference season], that's going
to mess us up. We're not going to
worry about the standings,"
Goldhahn said. "We're going to
keep that goal of winning the
Pac-10. Teams that are not sup
posed to be beating other teams
have been, so anything is possi
ble. We're always keeping that in
mind."
In its match against Cal, Stan
ford could be commended for
fighting back in Game 2 and
Game 3. The Cardinal trailed 25-
22 in Game 2 and looked as
though it would head into the
locker room down two games be
fore going on a 9-4 run, capped
off by one of junior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani's team-high
25 kills.
Then, the Cardinal fell be
hind 7-2 in Game 3 before taking
control and eventually taking the
tight battle, 30-28 on one of se
nior middle blocker Sara
McGee's 11 kills of the match.
For the Cardinal, freshman
outside hitter Kristin Richards
finished with 17 kills, senior
middle blocker Jenn Harvey
tallied 13 kills, and junior op
posite Jen Hucke hit .600 on
10 attempts.
Still, Stanford was outhit .333-
.266 and was outdug 63-44.
"Everybody on our team
knows that the way we played
