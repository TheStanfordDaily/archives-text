# Soccer splits two in Arizona
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
When the Stanford women's soccer team
(6-6-1,1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) gave up an
early goal to Arizona (4-7-1, 0-2) in its con
ference opener on Friday night, an underly
ing feeling of "here we go again" started to
make its way through the Cardinal bench.
But for the first time this season, Stanford
was able to post a come-from-behind win,
defeating the Wildcats 3-2 in a match high
lighted by senior midfielder Ally Mar
quand's hat trick.

However, Stanford did not fare as well on
Sunday when it battled No. 23 Arizona State
(8-2-2). The Cardinal was shutout by the Sun
Devils and ultimately lost 1-0.
With the way the Stanford offense has
been sputtering along this season, even the 1-
0 deficit courtesy of a goal from Wildcat
junior forward Candice Wilks, a 2002 Pac-10
Honorable Mention selection seemed al
most insurmountable.

Before this weekend, the Cardinal was av
eraging just 1.09 goals per match, had been
shutout five times and had scored more than
one goal on only one occasion.
"I think we definitely got a little down
after [Arizona's] first goal," Cardinal head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "But it was some
thing we talked about before the match:
Fighting back after getting behind and never
thinking we were out of it."
Stanford's comeback was led by Mar
quand, who didn't give the team much time to
feel sorry for ifself. Marquand scored the

Sophomore Lindsey Hunt and the Stanford women's soccer team won its first

midfielder Ally Marquand was injured in the game against the Sun Devils.
equalizer less than five minutes later
on a bullet from the top of the box.
"Ally's offensive play was just
tremendous," Ratcliffe said. "The
midfield really kept us in that match."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
that five-minute period at the start of
the first half was not the only time it
trailed.
Arizona capitalized on a miscom
munication between junior goal
keeper Nicole Barnhart and junior
defender Emilee Shim. Again it was
Wilks who caused the damage, net
ting her sixth goal of the season.
"That goal was totally pre
ventable," Ratcliffe said. "[Ari
zona's] first goal came on an out
standing individual play, but the sec
ond one really just shouldn't have
happened."
This time, the Cardinal had to en
dure just 54 seconds of frustration.

Marquand came to the rescue again,
beating Arizona goalkeeper Natalie
Juarez with a shot from eight yards
out.
Marquand's second goal proved
to be the swing in momentum Stan
ford needed.
The Cardinal was able to reduce
the amount of costly miscues and, un
like many of its previous contests, it
was able to convert offensively and
score the go-ahead goal.
Freshman midfielder Rachel
Buehler entered the game as a sub
stitute in the second half and her
presence paid off for the Cardinal.
In the 65th minute, Buehler got the
ball to Marquand, who was 15
yards out on the left side, and Mar
quand drove the ball past the goal
keeper, completing her hat trick
and giving Stanford its first lead of
the game.
That was all the Cardinal need
ed, as it played stellar defense for
the remaining 25 minutes of the
match.
Sunday's battle with the Sun Dev
ils proved costly for Stanford in more

ways than one. Not only did the Car
dinal pick up a loss in an important
conference match, but the team's
leading goal-scorer, Marquand, went
down in the 23rd minute with a knee
injury.
Marquand was unable to return in
the second period, and her status for
the rest of the season is uncertain with
preliminary examinations indicating
MCL damage.
The struggling Stanford offense
outshot ASU 11-8, but it could not
finish its opportunities, leading to a
shutout loss.
"Losing Ally was really tough,"
Ratcliffe said. "Obviously she's been
running the show on offense and I
think we looked a little lost without
her. We have good players up front,
but they are not natural goal scorers,
so things haven't been easy."
The Cardinal offense clearly
missed Marquand. In just 23 minutes,
she recorded a team-high two shots
on goal.
Ironically, the weekend also
marked the return of sophomore de
fender Hayley Hunt from a broken

wrist. Hunt came on as a substitute
against the Wildcats and started Sun
day's match against the Sun Devils.
"I thought our defense was great
[on Sunday]," Ratcliffe said. "Hayley
had a lot to do with that. She played
very strongly at center back."
Despite the strong defensive play,
a mistake by the Cardinal keeper
gave ASU the lead. Barnhart mis
judged an Amy LePeilbet free kick
from nearly 50 yards out and it
slipped through her hands and into
the goal.
"In [Barahart's] defense, she's
playing sick right now and still doing
a great job," Ratcliffe said. "It's just
unfortunate that a mistake like that
was the difference-maker in the
game."
Sunday marked yet another frus
trating loss for the Cardinal in which
almost everything that could go
wrong did go wrong.
"We played good soccer all week
end," Ratcliffe said. "I feel bad be
cause most of our losses have been re
sults of little mistakes that we just
haven't been able to overcome."

Marquand's second goal proved
to be the swing in momentum Stan
ford needed.
The Cardinal was able to reduce
the amount of costly miscues and, un
like many of its previous contests, it
was able to convert offensively and
score the go-ahead goal.
Freshman midfielder Rachel
Buehler entered the game as a sub
stitute in the second half and her
presence paid off for the Cardinal.
In the 65th minute, Buehler got the
ball to Marquand, who was 15
yards out on the left side, and Mar
quand drove the ball past the goal
keeper, completing her hat trick
and giving Stanford its first lead of
the game.
That was all the Cardinal need
ed, as it played stellar defense for
the remaining 25 minutes of the
match.
Sunday's battle with the Sun Dev
ils proved costly for Stanford in more

ways than one. Not only did the Car
dinal pick up a loss in an important
conference match, but the team's
leading goal-scorer, Marquand, went
down in the 23rd minute with a knee
injury.
Marquand was unable to return in
the second period, and her status for
the rest of the season is uncertain with
preliminary examinations indicating
MCL damage.
The struggling Stanford offense
outshot ASU 11-8, but it could not
finish its opportunities, leading to a
shutout loss.
"Losing Ally was really tough,"
Ratcliffe said. "Obviously she's been
running the show on offense and I
think we looked a little lost without
her. We have good players up front,
but they are not natural goal scorers,
so things haven't been easy."
The Cardinal offense clearly
missed Marquand. In just 23 minutes,
she recorded a team-high two shots
on goal.
Ironically, the weekend also
marked the return of sophomore de
fender Hayley Hunt from a broken

wrist. Hunt came on as a substitute
against the Wildcats and started Sun
day's match against the Sun Devils.
"I thought our defense was great
[on Sunday]," Ratcliffe said. "Hayley
had a lot to do with that. She played
very strongly at center back."
Despite the strong defensive play,
a mistake by the Cardinal keeper
gave ASU the lead. Barnhart mis
judged an Amy LePeilbet free kick
from nearly 50 yards out and it
slipped through her hands and into
the goal.
"In [Barahart's] defense, she's
playing sick right now and still doing
a great job," Ratcliffe said. "It's just
unfortunate that a mistake like that
was the difference-maker in the
game."
Sunday marked yet another frus
trating loss for the Cardinal in which
almost everything that could go
wrong did go wrong.
"We played good soccer all week
end," Ratcliffe said. "I feel bad be
cause most of our losses have been re
sults of little mistakes that we just
haven't been able to overcome."
When the Stanford women's soccer team
(6-6-1,1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) gave up an
early goal to Arizona (4-7-1, 0-2) in its con
ference opener on Friday night, an underly
ing feeling of "here we go again" started to
make its way through the Cardinal bench.
But for the first time this season, Stanford
was able to post a come-from-behind win,
defeating the Wildcats 3-2 in a match high
lighted by senior midfielder Ally Mar
quand's hat trick.

However, Stanford did not fare as well on
Sunday when it battled No. 23 Arizona State
(8-2-2). The Cardinal was shutout by the Sun
Devils and ultimately lost 1-0.
With the way the Stanford offense has
been sputtering along this season, even the 1-
0 deficit courtesy of a goal from Wildcat
junior forward Candice Wilks, a 2002 Pac-10
Honorable Mention selection seemed al
most insurmountable.

Before this weekend, the Cardinal was av
eraging just 1.09 goals per match, had been
shutout five times and had scored more than
one goal on only one occasion.
"I think we definitely got a little down
after [Arizona's] first goal," Cardinal head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "But it was some
thing we talked about before the match:
Fighting back after getting behind and never
thinking we were out of it."
Stanford's comeback was led by Mar
quand, who didn't give the team much time to
feel sorry for ifself. Marquand scored the

Sophomore Lindsey Hunt and the Stanford women's soccer team won its first

falling to Arizona State 1-0 in Tempe. Ariz., this weekend. Cardinal senior
midfielder Ally Marquand was injured in the game against the Sun Devils.

on a bullet from the top of the box.
"Ally's offensive play was just
tremendous," Ratcliffe said. "The
midfield really kept us in that match."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
that five-minute period at the start of
the first half was not the only time it
trailed.
Arizona capitalized on a miscom
munication between junior goal
keeper Nicole Barnhart and junior
defender Emilee Shim. Again it was
Wilks who caused the damage, net
ting her sixth goal of the season.
"That goal was totally pre
ventable," Ratcliffe said. "[Ari
zona's] first goal came on an out
standing individual play, but the sec
ond one really just shouldn't have
happened."
This time, the Cardinal had to en
dure just 54 seconds of frustration.

Marquand came to the rescue again,
beating Arizona goalkeeper Natalie
Juarez with a shot from eight yards
out.
