# Students back anti-military suit
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
A group of Stanford students will ask
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate tonight
for support in persuading University Pres
ident John Hennessy to allow the Law
School to join a lawsuit against the De
partment of Defense and other govern
ment agencies.
About 20 law students are campaign
ing to convince the University to join the
Forum for Academic and Institutional
Rights (FAIR), a group of law professors,
law schools and students, which filed the
lawsuit on Sept. 19. The group aims to ex
press their opposition to the Solomon
Amendment, passed in 1996, which per
mits the Secretary of Defense to deny fed
eral funding to universities that bar
ROTC or military recruitment on campus.
The controversy has been brewing on
campus for the past several weeks, as law
students have been circulating petitions
asking Stanford students to defend the
Law School's refusal to host military re
cruiters.
Stanford Law School does not allow
the military to recruit on campus, because
the government's practice of barring
openly gay people from.serving in the mil
itary contradicts Stanford's policy of
nondiscrimination.
The Solomon Amendment, according
to the petition, forces students to "choose
between abandoning their values and los
ing upwards of hundreds of millions of
federal dollars."
Since 2001, the government has be
come increasingly aggressive in denying
funding to universities that do not comply
with its recruiting efforts. So far, however,
Stanford has not been penalized.
Vice President for Public Affairs Gor
don Earle said the University will not join
the plaintiffs, though it continues to sup
port individual expression regarding the
lawsuit.
He acknowledged the widespread sup
port for the lawsuit among law students
but said that adding the University to the
current list of plaintiffs would not change
how the issue is settled in court.

Law student Jennifer Labrocca, one of
the students trying to convince Stanford to
join FAIR, disagreed with the Universi
ty's stance.

"We hope to increase awareness
among the student body that the Universi
ty has chosen not to stand up for its acade
mic principles or for its students' rights,"
Labrocca said.
Dean of the Law School Kathleen Sulli
van disagreed with the government's policy
of withholding funds from universities that
do not allow its recruiters on campus.
"It raises serious First Amendment
questions for the government to condition
all federal funds to a university upon its
agreement to forego its policy against dis
crimination in employment," Sullivan
said. "The Supreme Court has repeatedly
held that the government may not use car
rots any more than sticks to coerce surren

der of constitutional rights."
The government filed a motion to dis
miss the case on Sept. 26, which was fol
lowed by a hearing in a district court in
New Jersey at the. end of last week. The
court's decision on the suit is expected
within two weeks.
According to Labrocca, FAIR aims "to
promote academic freedom, support edu
cational institutions in opposing discrimi
nation and vindicate the rights of institu
tions of higher education."
The Law School attempted to join
FAIR last year, but the University,
which was hesitant to jeopardize its rela
tionship with the federal government,
did not give the school permission,

Labrocca said.
Barefoot, who is president of Outlaw, a
group representing lesbian, gay, bisexual
and trans-gender students in the law
school, is nonetheless helping to spear
head efforts to overcome what he called
"unbridled authority of military bureau
crats."
Labrocca hopes student activism will
coax Stanford into joining FAIR. Because
all of the member of the petition are
anonymous, the University would avoid
retaliation from the government, she said.
If Stanford does not join the lawsuit,
Labrocca hopes to see some Law School
faculty members enter as independent
parties.
