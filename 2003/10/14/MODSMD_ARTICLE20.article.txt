# Pac-10 still an enigma to many
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
In the Pacific-10 Conference this weekend, the
game that everyone expected to be closest ended up
being the most lopsided, and the team which was
most expected to have an easy weekend lost at home
to a non-conference foe. .
Go figure.
Oregon (4-3, 1-2 Pac-10) came into Saturday's
road matchup against Arizona State (3-3, 1-2) as a
two-point favorite, but the Ducks left town with a 45-
point loss. Washington (3-3, 1-1) was simply out
played by Nevada (4-2), which won, 28-17, in the
school's biggest upset since the Wolfpack moved up
to Division I-A in 1992.
UCLA (4-2, 2-0) was favored by 17 at Arizona
(1-6, 0-3), but needed a fourth-quarter intercep
tion return for a touchdown to squeak out a 24-21
victory.
One game did go as the odds-makers predicted,
though. Stanford (2-2,0-2), a 21-point underdog, lost
44-21 at No. 5 Southern California (5-1,2-1).
Oregon quarterback Kellen Clemens' first two
passes against the Sun Devils were both intercept
ed. His first was returned 50 yards by Jamar
Williams for a touchdown and his second was re
turned to the six-yard line by Chris MacKenzie to
set up one of Hakim Hill's two touchdown runs.
Oregon did not complete a pass until 2:20 re
mained in the first half.
Things didn't get any better for the Ducks after
halftime, as Arizona State scored on every one of
its second-half possessions, totaling 38 points.
Andrew Walter was 18-of-28 for 316 yards and
three TDs for the Sun Devils. Clemens and his re
placement, Jason Fife, combined to go 9-of-26 pass
ing for 127 yards.
Huskies QB Cody Pickett,
who set a Pac-10 record for pass
ing yards last season, was sacked
five times by defensive end
Jorge Cordova and also threw
three interceptions. The Wolf
pack also blocked two field
goals in the first Nevada-Wash
ington game since the Huskies'
2-0 victory in 1903.
Andy Heiser threw for 299 yards
168 of them to Maurice Mann
and three scores for Nevada. The
resurgent Rich Alexis finished with
122 yards rushing, but the Huskies
fell behind 21-7 and 28-10 in the
third quarter, and the team could
not generate a comeback, failing to
score in the final period.
UCLA defensive tackle Rodney
Leisle was an unlikely ballcarrier,
but he scored for the second
straight week, intercepting Arizona
freshman QB Kris Heavner's ill-ad
vised shovel pass behind the line in
the fourth quarter and rumbling 55
yards for the game's final score.
Both teams subsequently missed
field goals.
The Wildcats had built a surpris
ing 21-10 halftime lead, thanks in
part to an even more surprising
running game. Tailback Clarence
Farmer looking like the Pac-10's
2001 rushing leader for the first
time since, well, 2001 broke
loose for 132 yards rushing and 32
yards receiving, and Mike Bell
gained 94 yards on just eight car
ries.

However, Heavner and starter
Nic Costa combined to throw four
interceptions, enabling the Bruins
to battle their way back into the
game. Arizona outgained the Bru
ins 519-333, but came up short for
the sixth consecutive week.

No. 6 Washington State (5-1, 2-
0), No. 22 Oregon State (5-1, 2-0)
and California (3-4, 1-1) all were
idle this week.

This Saturday, USC plays Notre
Dame (2-3) in South Bend, Ind.,
Stanford hosts Washington State,
Washington travels to face Oregon
State, Cal pays UCLA a visit and
Arizona State flies cross-country to
face North Carolina (1-5).
