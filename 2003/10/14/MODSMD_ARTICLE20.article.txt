# Pac-10 still an enigma to many

### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
In the Pacific-10 Conference this weekend, the
game that everyone expected to be closest ended up
being the most lopsided, and the team which was
most expected to have an easy weekend lost at home
to a non-conference foe. .
Go figure.
Oregon (4-3, 1-2 Pac-10) came into Saturday's
road matchup against Arizona State (3-3, 1-2) as a
two-point favorite, but the Ducks left town with a 45-
point loss. Washington (3-3, 1-1) was simply out
played by Nevada (4-2), which won, 28-17, in the
school's biggest upset since the Wolfpack moved up
to Division I-A in 1992.
UCLA (4-2, 2-0) was favored by 17 at Arizona
(1-6, 0-3), but needed a fourth-quarter intercep
tion return for a touchdown to squeak out a 24-21
victory.
One game did go as the odds-makers predicted,
though. Stanford (2-2,0-2), a 21-point underdog, lost
44-21 at No. 5 Southern California (5-1,2-1).
Oregon quarterback Kellen Clemens' first two
passes against the Sun Devils were both intercept
ed. His first was returned 50 yards by Jamar
Williams for a touchdown and his second was re
turned to the six-yard line by Chris MacKenzie to
set up one of Hakim Hill's two touchdown runs.
Oregon did not complete a pass until 2:20 re
mained in the first half.
Things didn't get any better for the Ducks after
halftime, as Arizona State scored on every one of
its second-half possessions, totaling 38 points.
Andrew Walter was 18-of-28 for 316 yards and
three TDs for the Sun Devils. Clemens and his re
placement, Jason Fife, combined to go 9-of-26 pass
ing for 127 yards.
