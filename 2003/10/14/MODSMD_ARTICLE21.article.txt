# One-goal losses haunt Stanford men's soccer
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's soccer team's
weekend contests with Oregon State (8-
4-0,2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) and No. 8
Washington (8-1-2,2-1-1 Pac-10) demon
strate the sort of luck that the squad has
been having this year.
Tough luck, that is.
Both matchups ended in 1-0 losses for
the Cardinal (2-8-2, 0-3 Pac-10), which,
despite vigorous efforts in both games,
could not prevent its opponents' two sur
prising goals from landing in the net.
The first of those two goals hit in the
25th minute of Friday's faceoff against
the Beavers. Oregon State, a team well
known in the Pac-10 for its offensive
domination, was pushing close to the
Stanford goal, though the Cardinal de
fenders seemed to have the situation
under control.
Suddenly, the ball sprang up from the
foot of OSU freshman Carlos Cornejo,
and flew 20 yards into the upper-right
corner, out of the reach of junior goal
keeper Robby Fulton.
In an instant, Cornejo, who was only a
sporadic starter for the Beavers and had
never scored in his collegiate career, be
came the man responsible for OSU's sec
ond conference win of the season.
The cruelty of chance continued in a
strikingly similar fashion when the Cardi
nal met Washington on Sunday after
noon.
In the 42nd minute, Washington
chipped a corner kick into the midfield,
and then to freshman Will Flanagan.
Flanagan, who, like Cornejo had
never before scored in NCAA play, let
off a slow-moving shot in traffic which
snuck by several players from both teams
as well as Fulto before rolling into
the back of the net, untouched.
Fulton confirmed after the game that
his vision was shielded long enough to pre
vent him from seeing the ball spin past.
"This game can be kind of cruel," said
Stanford head coach Bret Simon. "You
see unexpected heroes rise up when your
team is on a roll. Confidence and good
fortune tend to go together."
The Cardinal fought harder than spec
tators have seen all year, not allowing
OSU or Washington to control posses
sion.
Stanford in fact, outshot Washington

on Sunday by a six-shot margin, making it
only the second time this season that the
squad has racked up more attempts than
its opponent.
The Cardinal just couldn't get a shot
into the goal.
Junior midfielder Aaron Maines
launched a close attempt on Friday night,
but it went slightly wide. Junior forward
James Twellman and freshman midfield
er Marcus Ryan both got good looks in
the final minutes against Washington,
but couldn't hit their mark.
"We're creating chances, and we're
close to getting them," Simon said.
The struggles of the Stanford squad
can be partially attributed to the fact
that senior midfielder Mike Wilson
was out of the country this weekend,
and junior Matt Janusz, who leads the
team in points, was sidelined with a
groin pull.
"Those are two guys with experience
and the ability to create goals," Simon said,
"And goals are at a premium right now."
Despite the Cardinal's scoring prob
lems, the weekend proved a triumph for
Fulton, who made his return to Stan
ford's starting lineup Friday night after a
six-game absence due to injury.
Sunday's game put Fulton over the
2,500-minute mark in his career, allowing
him to officially become the Cardinal's
all-time leader in goals-against average.
In 2,573 minutes of play, Fulton has al
lowed only 15 goals, setting his collegiate
GAA at 0.52.
Fulton, however, was not aware that
he had received this distinction after the
game, and was more focused on his
team's effort and recovering fully from
his injury.
"It feels great to be back," he said,
"I'm not 100 percent yet. I'm not to the
point where I can kick [very well] yet."
Simon was thrilled to have Fulton back
in goal, though he remarked that fresh
man Andrew Kartunen did an excellent
job during Fulton's time on the bench.
"Robby is a veteran. He really calms
us," Simon said. "He jumped back in
without missing a beat."
Stanford will continue conference
play this weekend in away matches with
Fresno State and top-ranked defending
champion UCLA. The Cardinal face the
Bulldogs on Friday in Fresno at 7 p.m.
and the Bruins in Los Angeles at 1 p.m.
on Sunday.
