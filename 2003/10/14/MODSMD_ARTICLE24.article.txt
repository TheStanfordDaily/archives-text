## Strip clubs enlist students in fight against new law Petitioners seek signatures of UCLA students to overturn lap-dance ban 
### ROGELIO MORALES DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —The strip
clubs are striking back.
In response to the Los Angeles City Council's
unanimous vote to ban lap dances, signature gath
erers — backed by the city's adult club indus
try — descended upon UCLA late last week, stir
ring discussion and debate about the increasingly
contentious issue.
The circulating petition asks city residents to
help repeal a pending ordinance that imposes a
six-foot distance between male and female strip
pers and their patrons.
The measure, which passed by a vote of 13-0 in
City Hall, is awaiting the signature of Los Angeles
Mayor James Hahn, who is expected to approve it.
The proposed ordinance prohibits strip club
clientele from touching performers, tipping di
rectly into dancers' G-strings, and receiving lap
dances.
Violations of the ordinance will be punishable
by up to six months in jail and up to $2,500 in fines.

John Bowers, a signature gatherer who recent
ly worked to get the necessary signatures for Cal
ifornia's gubernatorial recall election, roamed
around UCLA's Bruin Plaza on Friday seeking
students and voters to sign the petition.
Throughout the day, Bowers noticed trends,
albeit perhaps predictable ones.
"A lot more men are signing the petition than
women," Bowers said.
Strategists for the city's strip clubs are hoping
to collect nearly 57,000 signatures by Oct. 25 in
hopes of qualifying a "lap dance" measure for the
municipal ballot.
If the strip clubs succeed in having their peti
tion certified, the council must either repeal its or
dinance or call an election within 140 days.
Bowers, who gathered "lap dance" signatures
on the University of Southern California campus
on Oct. 2, noted a contrast between the two Los
Angeles schools.
"USC students signed the petition (with great
enthusiasm)," he said. "People at UCLA seem
more conservative."
However, many UCLA students have ex
pressed displeasure about the lap dance ban. Lau
ren Boitano, a senior, signed the petition against
the proposed ordinance.
"I think it's such a stupid thing to outlaw," Boi
tano said. "People want to give them and people
want to get them." She also said she had been un
aware of the new ordinance before she signed the

petition.
Huei Jang, a senior business-economics stu
dent, favors rescinding the lap dance ban for eco
nomic reasons.
"I think it would be good for the economy [be
cause] it gets people to spend money," Jang said,
adding that the issue infringes on a citizen's civil
rights.
"People have the right to engage in this form of
entertainment if they wish as long as they don't
hurt anyone," he said.
Although a good number of UCLA students
signed the petition, many did not.
Ana Adam, a senior, declined to sign the pe
tition because she believes lifting the ban
would legitimize the degradation of women
and men.
"I'd rather be cleaning toilets than doing lap
dances," she said. "If you had respect for yourself,
you wouldn't [give lap dances for money]."
Adam also said she would vote against the
movement to repeal the lap dance ban if the mea
sure's opponents succeed in gathering the neces
sary number of signatures
. Other students have focused on different is
sues concerning the adult club industry. Some be
lieved measures should be taken to prevent pros
titution.
Supporters of the pending ordinance argue
that strip clubs, bikini bars and adult bookstores
contribute to prostitution, drug use and violence.
