# Early apps might be limited by law

### VIRGINIA ZIGNEGO OKLAHOMA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) NORMAN, Okla. A proposal that
would limit colleges' use of early-decision admission
policies may soon take flight in Congress.
Although there has been no official proposal from
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the idea has
been floated around Capitol Hill by a member of
Kennedy's office, according to David Hawkins, direc
tor of public policy for the National Association for
College Admission Counseling.
The proposal would be one revision made to the
Higher Education Act. It would reduce federal sup
port for colleges that use early-decision policies, give
extra consideration to children of alumni or have a
lower graduation rate for minority students.
According to the NACAC's Web site, early-ad
mission decisions are a process by which students
commit to their first-choice college. If admitted, they
must enroll. Students may apply to other institutions,
but can only have one early decision application pend
ing.
Although NACAC does not have a position on
whether Sen. Kennedy's proposal is good or bad, the
organization is concerned that this proposal would
only be counterproductive.
"Colleges must have the flexibility to conduct ad
mission in a way that enables them to assemble the
student body [needed] to serve their mission, their
community or their state," Hawkins said. "Banning
early decision would constitute a significant 'camel's
nose into the tent' of admission policy by the federal
government."
Hawkins also points out another more serious con
sequence of disciplining colleges for their admission
policies: although only 18 percent of colleges and uni
versities nationwide offer early decision, penalizing
colleges for having early-decision policies would open
the door for additional regulation of the college ad
mission process.
Jim Manley, press secretary for Kennedy, could
not comment on whether any decisions had been
made regarding whether to include early-decision
penalties in the bill.
"Sen. Kennedy is looking at several options for
what should be included in the Higher Education
Act," Manley said. "No specific decisions have been
made yet, but Sen. Kennedy is looking forward to
moving this bill ahead."
The University of Wisconsin does not offer an
early decision option. Instead, it uses rolling admis
sion, a process where applications are reviewed as
they are completed. Admission decisions are adminis
tered to students throughout the admission cycle.
Rob Seltzer, Wisconsin's director of admissions,
said this admission process is preferable from the stu
dent's point of view.
"Rolling admission reduces the tremendous
amount of pressure a student is under senior year," he
said. "It's better than the student who has to commit
before financial aid or living arrangements are even
settled."
However, Seltzer also said he understands why col
leges would find early decision preferable.
"Early decision makes a college's stats look better,
and they have their class settled earlier," he said. "But
it restricts students' freedom of choice."
