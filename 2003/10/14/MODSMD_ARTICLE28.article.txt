# Hundreds protest for, against Chief Illiniwek
## 
### CHARLES EDWARD SCOTT JR. DAILY ILLINI 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111.â€”
Charlene Teters, a Spokane Indian and
founder of the anti-Chief Illiniwek mascot
movement, returned to the University of
Illinois to lead Friday's Progressive Re
source/Action Cooperative anti-Chief
rally. More than 500 protesters and sup
porters attended the rally.
"[Chief Illiniwek] is a symbol of a na
tional problem," Teters said. "If you con
sidered yourself antiracists, then this is
your issue, too."
Teters founded the anti-Chief Illiniwek
movement in 1989. With Friday's rally
falling before the Columbus Day holiday
Monday, Teters complained about how
Columbus is celebrated as a hero of Amer
ican history even though his voyage to the
New World started the chain of events that

led to the decline of the American Indian
civilization.
"In American history they start with
1492," Teters said. "If you look at Ameri
ca before 1492, this is Indian land."
Organizers of the rally said they had
much of the same reasoning.
"We wanted to draw attention to the
fact that Columbus is celebrated as a noble
figure in history even though he was re
sponsible for the first act of genocide and
slavery of Native American people," said
Frank StCc, a senior and PRC member.
About 100 students also attended the rally
to show their support for keeping the
Chief.
"This rally is another example of the lack
of education about the Chief," said An
drew Fitzgerald, a sophomore and presi
dent of the pro-Chief slate of student gov
ernment. "If they took the time to learn
what the Chief is about and the process

that we go through to actually portray
these people, then they will not feel the
way they do."
After Teters' speech, almost 150 Chief
protesters marched to the Hemy Adminis
tration Building. As the group marched
they shouted: "We don't want your Chief
no more. Racist mascots create hate."
Anti-Chief activists William Cook and
Sherry Naanes arrived with their protest
wagon filled with posters containing anti-
Chief messages.
Marchers were allowed to enter the
Henry Administration Building and enter
the Board of Trustees office, but board
members were not in the building, so the
group left voice-mail phone messages.
Teters said the Chief creates a hostile envi
ronment for Native American students.
"The Chief has no clue how it feels to be
Native," said Yolanda Davis, a Native
American student attending Parkland

College. "We really need to get rid of
Chief Illiniwek."
Teters said she was pleased with the big
drawing for the rally.
"We will keep coming back until this
thing is gone," Teters said. "When they
refer to us as chief, brave, redskin, we are
being referred to as less than human."
Stec said the group was honored to have
Teters as the keynote speaker for the rally.
"[Teters] will draw attention to this
issue so it will end soon," Stec said.
But Chief supporters also showed their
resolve on the issue.
Joe Deien, a freshman, was part of a
group of 10 Chief Illiniwek supporters who
came to the rally together.
"There is no disrespect to Native
Americans," he said. "Everything is done
to respect their tradition. Everyone has the
right to protest. But I don't support them.
I think they are wrong."
