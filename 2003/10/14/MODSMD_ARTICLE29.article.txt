# Designated driver fined despite sobriety
## 
### ABBY MILLS UNIVERSITY DAILY KANSAN 
(U-WIRE) LAWRENCE, Kan. Students are fre
quently reminded about the dangers of drunk driving. But
as one University of Kansas student recently discovered,
there are also hazards in being a designated driver.
KU student Ryan Hatfield received a $92 ticket for ob
structing traffic while picking up friends at a Lawrence,
Kan., watering hole a few weeks ago. He said he plans to
appeal the ticket.
"I already gave up my whole night to drive
around drunk people," the Tonganoxie, Kan., ju
nior said. "I'm not paying $92 on top of that."
Hatfield, a member of Theta Chi fraternity, was
on B ADD duty when he received the ticket Sept. 29.
Brothers Against Drunk Driving, and its counterpart
for sororities, Sisters Against Drunk Driving, are pro
grams that provide sober drivers to members of the
Greek community.

Hatfield pulled in front of the Wagon Wheel Cafe at
about 2:30 a.m. and turned on his hazard lights so the
men could get in. As he sat there, a policeman walked up
to him.
The officer told him he had to move because he could
block traffic, Hatfield said. Hatfield said he yelled to the
people he was picking up that they had to wait and meet
him behind the building, but they had already opened the
back driver's side and passenger doors.
At that point, the officer asked Hatfield for his diver's
license and issued him the ticket.
The ticket wasn't warranted, Hatfield said, because
no other traffic was around to block and the officer
never gave him the opportunity to move because he never
backed away from the diver's side widow and would have
been hit by the door had the car moved.
"I figured between blocking traffic or running over a
police officer, I should probably block traffic," he said.
Hatfield said he wants the ticket to be repealed when
he goes to court today.
