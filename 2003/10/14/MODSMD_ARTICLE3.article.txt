# Career center eliminates bidding process
## 
### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A significant change to the Career De
velopment Center's Cardinal Recruiting
service, which matches Stanford students
with potential employers, has some stu
dents frustrated.

In a revamp this year, the center has
done away with Cardinal Recruiting's bid
ding system, which used to make it easier
for some students to obtain interviews with
their top-choice companies.
The bidding process operated in this
way previously: Some companies would
choose several students to interview based
on their resumes, but reserve some slots for
students who listed them as their top
choice.

In short, if a student wanted to interview
with his top-choice company but did not
think his resume was up to par, he could
submit a bid and have a good chance of se
curing an interview slot anyway.
Now that all companies in the Cardinal
Recruiting system handpick every employ
ee, students who are not selected in ad
vance are unlikely to be interviewed.
Senior Ami Shah thinks the bidding sys
tem made Stanford unique.
"Unlike other schools, Stanford,
through the bidding system, allows stu
dents to have an equal playing field in get
ting jobs no matter what their GPA or
major is," she said.
The change will place more emphasis on
a student's resume, whereas the bidding
system provided a more level playing field,
regardless of GPA or major, Shah argued.
Shah, an economics major, is not the
only student who has voiced concerns
about the change.
"I think what most people are com
plaining about is that, now, if you're not
pre-selected, that's the end of the game,"
said senior Michael Neruda, president of
Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional business
fraternity. "There aren't any second
chances through bidding."
Formerly, engineering organizations
were allowed to use solely the pre-select

system to choose their interview candi
dates, while other companies mainly
consulting and business firms were re
quired to choose only half their candidates
through the pre-select system and the rest
through the bidding system.
Lance Choy, director of the center, said the
decision to eliminate the bidding system was
sparked by complaints from companies who
wanted a greater say in potential interview can
didates.

"We were losing companies, as they refused
to take part in the bidding process," Choy said.
Stanford is not the only school employ
ing only a pre-select form of recruitment.
According to Choy, the majority of big
name schools that once used a bidding sys

tern have phased it out. He said Stanford
was one of the last schools to drop the sys
tem.
Choy acknowledged that students' con
cerns are valid but pointed out that "students
never were really guaranteed an interview by
the bidding system."
The center believes that using only the
pre-select system will benefit Stanford by at
tracting more companies that might have
been reluctant to hire students through the
bidding system.
Along with the change in the recruiting
process, the center has also implemented
new software that many students have

found difficult to navigate. For in
stance, students often fail lto fill out
a demographic pull-down menu in
the recruiting program. Without
this information, students cannot
be considered to work.
Staff members at the Career De
velopment Center said the problems
are being addressed.

"We had a lot of problems early

on," said Beverly Principal, director
of employment. "However, now
there are no major lingering prob
lems with the software."
The center maintained that re
cent changes it has made to its oper
ations have been successful.

"Since the start of the year, more
companies have started engaging us in
recruiting," Choy said.

Two companies that have joined
Cardinal Recruiting since the start of
the year are The Walt Disney Compa
ny. and The Boston Consulting Group.
Previously, Disney conducted its own
interviewing process by holding infor

mation sessions and gathering resumes
on its own. The shift to a pre-select sys
tem has allowed Disney recruiters to
have resumes gathered for them and
has thus made it is easier for the com
pany to recruit here, according to a rep
resentative.

The center is planning to do a full
analysis on the impact of the change. The
analysis will try to determine if the re
moval of the bidding system is a more ef
fective way of meeting student needs.
"So far, the system has worked
pretty well, and we expect it to be
even better than the old one," Prin
cipal said.
