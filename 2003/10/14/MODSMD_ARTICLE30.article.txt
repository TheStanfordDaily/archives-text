# Pledge hospitalized for head injury
## 
### MELISSA SINDELAR DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN 
(U-WIRE) OXFORD, Miss. After accepting his bid
to Sigma Chi fraternity last Monday, University of Mississip
pi freshman Reid Harris Waldrip celebrated into the night
until 12:30 a.m. Tuesday when he received a head injury and
blacked out, according to his mother Robin Waldrip.
Waldrip's mother said her son has a blank spot of the
night's events from 12:30 a.m. until about 1:15 a.m., with no
recollection of what happened. Waldrip has been in the In
tensive Care Unit at the North Mississippi Medical Center
in Tupelo. He was switched to a regular room this past Sat
urday.
"Truthfully, all the doctors who have looked at his brain
scan said he should have died Monday night," Robin
Waldrip said. "God has taken care of him and he continues
to be a living, breathing miracle."

She said her son has multiple skull fractures with some
left frontal lobe brain damage, affecting the right side of his

body.
Freshman Clay Liazon visited his friend both Saturday
and Sunday and said sometimes Waldrip cannot feel his
right hand, although he can move it.
"We held a broken conversation," Liazon said. "He can
think mentally. He's having trouble verbalizing and has to
take time to think about what he's saying sometimes."
Robin Waldrip said the amount of force it would have
taken for her son to receive those fractures would be equiv
alent to his falling two stories.
" He didn't fall," she said. "He has no abrasions, no
scratches. I asked him if he'd just fallen, but he didn't."
Randy Corban, director of university police, said they
know Waldrip was hit on the head. He said he had not heard
the rumor that Waldrip was hit with a full beer bottle.
Robin Waldrip said the family has not yet considered any
legal actions.
"We're not into finger pointing, just getting our son well,"
she said. "We would love to know the full story, but what the
story is doesn't change Reid's condition."
