# Students open clinic in San Jose
## 
### ANTHONY SANCHEZ 
Language and money are no longer bar
riers for many people without health care
due to the opening of the new Pacific Free
Clinic in San Jose, a project that is the brain
child of students in the Stanford Medical
School.
The clinic provides free basic health
care services to anyone who is of low in
come or is not proficient in English, regard
less of immigration status, said a represen
tative.
The services provided range from
screenings to medications, from high-blood
pressure to medical-insurance referrals
along with language translation in Spanish,
Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese.
The clinic has its beginnings in 1999,
when Stanford medical students conducted
free health screenings in an outreach pro
gram called the Asian American Health
Initiative in San Jose. They discovered that

immigrants were isolated from medical care
due to linguistic or financial hindrances.
Upon this discovery, the students wanted to
create a clinic that provided free medical
services with translators to overcome lan
guage barriers.
"It took dedication and perseverance
and it was difficult at times," said Sharon
Kwan, a medical student. Kwan, who is cur
rently on the Advisory Board that steers the
clinic, is one of the original students who or
ganized and conjured support for the pro
ject. •
David Wang, a medical student who is
one of the managers at the clinic, was part of
the clinical crusade as well. "We had to talk
to a lot of people, and community groups
and it took a very long time to get support,"
he said. "It was also hard to balance classes
and then devote time for the clinic but we
managed to pull through and get the re
sources we needed for this project."
After many false starts, the clinic
finally opened in May 2003. The
clinic is jointly sponsored by the
Stanford School of Medicine and the
School Health Clinics of Santa Clara
County.

"We have met success since
we've opened," Kwan said. "We
serve about 15 or 20 patients every

Saturday. The patients always have
such a grateful look on their face and
they appreciate the care they are
given."

Kwan continued, "I see the clinic
continuing to serve the under
served in the San Jose in the years to
come. We need passionate volun
teers to continue the success and im
pact of this clinic."

The clinic is open every Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Overfelt
High School, located at 1835 Cun
ningham Road in San Jose.
