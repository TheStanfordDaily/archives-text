# Nobel Laureate to teach in spring

### CAROL YU CAO 
John Maxwell Coetzee, who received the
2003 Nobel Prize in Literature earlier this
month, will be returning to Stanford in the
spring as the Isaac and Madeline Stein Visit
ing Writer of 2004.
Coetzee was last on campus in 2002, as a
visiting professor of English. He conducted a
seminar on 18th-century literature, focusing
primarily on the text of Samuel Richardson's
"Clarissa," a drama exploring sexuality and
socially unacceptable relationships. Al
though the Creative Writing Program has
yet to finalize its plans for Coetzee's class
spring quarter, Virginia Hess, Director of the
Program this year, commented that Coet
zee's previous classes were in smaller, semi
nar-type settings for which prospective stu
dents would submit written manuscripts for
evaluation and selection.

"Coetzee, like Tacitus, Swift and Samuel
Beckett, is a great writer who can face and
make you see the full frailty, species-inflicted

suffering, cruelty, absurdity andpretentious
ness of human beings - the crazy pageant,
public and private, of their destructive de
sires - but, like them also, in imagining the
moral perversity of human life, can perverse
ly make you thrill to the power of language,
life and the imagination," said English De
partment Chair Robert Polhemus.
Coetzee currently teaches at the Univer
sity of Chicago, where he is the Distin
guished Service Provider in the Committee
on Social Thought.
Educated at the University of Cape Town
and the University of Texas-Austin, he is the
author of a variety of novels, essays and liter
ary criticism. He is the only author to have
been a two-time recipient of England's
Booker Prize.
Eavan Boland, director of the creative
writing program, ascribes Coetzee's winning
of the Nobel Prize to his "being so obviously
a writer putting forth this personal vision in
times of great political stress and distress,
contributing to the human spirit."
