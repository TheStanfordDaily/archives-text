## Neptune's seasons and fatal diseases 
### 
Seasons on Neptune
Hubble photographs over the course of
six years suggest that Neptune has seasons
just like Earth. Neptune is a giant, icy
planet near the edge of the solar system
and takes 165 years to orbit the Sun. Sea-

sons there last roughly
40 years. "Neptune's
cloud bands have been
getting wider and
brighter," said Lawrence
Sromovsky of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin-
Madison. "This change
seems to be a response to
seasonal variations in
sunlight, like the season
al changes we see on

Earth." The astronomers in the study be
lieve this is a remarkable finding because
the Sun is 900 times dimmer at Neptune
than on Earth, and thus the planet would
not be expected to have seasons.
NYC tries to control Pollution
New York City's plan to control pollu
tion on school buses has stalled. About a
year and a half ago, the N.Y. Power Au
thority offered to equip about 1,000 diesel
school buses with pollution control. As of
now, a few buses have received old con
trols and none has been fitted with new
equipment. Advocates of the program
have voiced disappointment and anger.
Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for At
lantic Express, the largest of the bus com
panies, said, "I think the frustration really
is with the technology, not the bus compa
nies." According to the most recent plan
the retrofitting will only be completed by
September 2004.
Probing the Earth's Core
David Stevenson, a geophysicist from Cal-
Tech, has proposed new way to study the core
of the Earth project a probe down to it. The
probe would travel at five meters per second
and reach the core in about a week. It would
send data back in form of seismic waves, which
could be detected by existing equipment. The
benefits of this study would be to learn more
about the core and all phenomena related to it
such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The method would work in theory, the prob
lem is that it requires about 10 A l5 joules,
which is equivalent to the energy released by a
7.0 earthquake or a nuclear device.
New Guidelines for Blood Pressure
The National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute has revised its high blood pres
sure guidelines in response to growing
knowledge of how it affects the body. The
old standard was anyone with pressure
above 140 /90 was considered to be at
risk. Now NHLBI has added a category
and defined 120-139 / 80-89 to be pre-hy
pertension. The new guidelines are in
tended to increase awareness, especially
to the 45 million Americans who are at
pre-hypertension. People with pre-hyper
tension can control pressure without med
ication, by regular exercise, weight loss
and a more balanced diet. Hypertension
increases risk of stroke, causes kidney
problems, damages various arteries and
organs and can kill.
Silicon may be good Light Emitter
Australian researchers have demon
strated for the first time that pure silicon can
be a good light emitter. Silicon dominates
the microelectronics industry (think com
puters) but is not used in optoelectronics
because it is believed to transmit fight poor
ly. This team found that silicon can have a
fight emission efficiency of 6.1 percent at
room temperature and up to 10.2 percent at
130 Kelvin. "The result means that 'radia
tive recombination' can be one of the dom
inant recombination channels in pure crys
talline silicon," said Thorsten Trupke, one
of the authors. "This is in stark contrast to a
widely accepted perception that silicon is an
inherently poor light emitter." Radiative
recombination means that fight scattered
from different points can be combined.
Hepatitis B among Asian-Americans
The Asian Liver Center at Stanford
urges awareness, especially among the API
community. The leading cause of fiver can
cer is hepatitis B the virus lodges itself
into the fiver cells and causes them to mu
tate. "The problem is there are no symp
toms," of hepatitis B, said Sam So, a sur
geon at the Liver Center. "If [people] don't
get simple blood tests, they don't know
they have a chronic infection." According
to statistics from the Centers for Disease
Control, Asian Americans compose as
much as 50 percent of the 1.25 million in
fected and 5,000 deaths from hepatitis B,
even though they are only 4.5 percent of
the U.S. population. The Bay Area is a hot
spot for fiver cancer given it has a large
Asian population and many first-genera
tion immigrants.

Hepatitis B among Asian-Americans
The Asian Liver Center at Stanford
urges awareness, especially among the API
community. The leading cause of fiver can
cer is hepatitis B the virus lodges itself
into the fiver cells and causes them to mu
tate. "The problem is there are no symp
toms," of hepatitis B, said Sam So, a sur
geon at the Liver Center. "If [people] don't
get simple blood tests, they don't know
they have a chronic infection." According
to statistics from the Centers for Disease
Control, Asian Americans compose as
much as 50 percent of the 1.25 million in
fected and 5,000 deaths from hepatitis B,
even though they are only 4.5 percent of
the U.S. population. The Bay Area is a hot
spot for fiver cancer given it has a large
Asian population and many first-genera
tion immigrants.
