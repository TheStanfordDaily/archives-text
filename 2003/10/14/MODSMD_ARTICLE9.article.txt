## Stanford Unplugged 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Last year, I was sitting in my "Finding Voices, Forging
Selves" I-Hum lecture when all of a sudden somebody's
laptop made the famous "bah dada dih, da dih" noise.
"You've got mail!" the professor chimed in, right in the
middle of a sentence about eschatology (or was it episte
mology?) in "The Confessions of St. Augustine."
Yup, the student certainly did have mail. And he also
had wireless.
All of us techie Stanford students have wireless, right?
Or if we don't now, don't we want it?
Residential Computing is betting on it. In collaboration
with Information Technology Systems and Services, it has
started a wireless pilot project. Tons of equipment has al
ready been donated, including wireless access points, wire
less PC cards and management software. Wilbur and Stern
Halls, the Cowell Cluster and the Row house Bob are the
first participants for the program.
Lots of other dorms are also opting to go wireless
but they need to be willing to shell out the money.
Great, it's nice that Residential Computing has these
ambitious plans and that many residential computing
consultants are on the ball with unwiring their dorms, but
what about the other folks? There's an unwiring hierar
chy here a nasty pecking order. And a lot of out-in-the
woods dorms will be seeing wires for a long while yet.
OK, I didn't desperately need wireless. Hell, I didn't
even know what wireless was when I bought my laptop
13 months ago. But when I did figure out what it was, I
got excited.
Whoop-dee-do, I said to myself. Now I can sit in the
lounge and watch CNN and check weather.com at the
same time. But no such luck. As I sat there waiting for the
AOL Instant Messenger box to pop up, the little icon at
the bottom of my screen was kind enough to inform me
that I was out of the range of wireless access.
Wireless-deprived techies and fuzzies from all corners
of the campus agree that they're missing out.
Sophomore Rebecca Osaikwe griped about the lack of
wireless in her dorm.
"I lived in Soto last year, and I didn't have wireless, and
now I live in Narnia, and I don't have wireless either," she
said. "Nor do I have good cell phone reception. But that's
because I live at the end of the world."
Osakwe had originally planned to buy a wireless card.
"I went the first week of school to the Bookstore and
asked if they were still selling wireless cards," she said. "But
then I found out that it didn't matter anyway. I think it's an
noying. But I think it's a bigger deal that my printer's real
ly slow and I can't check my e-mail from my computer."
Sophomore Laura Surma, a resident of Narnia, said
that it would be "really nice to have wireless Internet
access."
"Right now I have all of these wires all over my desk
that I'd really like to get rid of," Surma said. "I'd also be
able to work freely in study rooms."
Junior Piotr Kosicki had some words of wisdom on the
wireless craze.
"What's happening is that wireless cards are becoming
standard for any laptop. Unwiring all of the dorms would
be a pretty big investment for the school," Kosicki said.
"But it's a convenience for us lazy college students. We
don't want to have to lug around a heavy cable; we want
to just push one button and have the whole world at our
finger tips."
Getting 24/7 high-speed Internet access in our room
for 10 bucks a month just isn't enough. We want to be able
to go online without the blue cable. And not just in the li
braries, but in the lounges, and in classrooms, and in our
own rooms of course.
Oh, but there are wireless drawbacks. Wireless and
reinforced concrete (the stuff our walls are made of)
don't go together too well. It's kind of like when you
miss half of a cell phone conversation just by standing
in your room. And then you're forced to go out to the
parking lot to chat.
Justy Burdick, a residential computing consultant in
Freshman / Sophomore College, talked about some
other problems. Burdick has just helped the dorm go
wireless and so far residents are happy with the results.
"It's not very helpful to have wireless in rooms because
it's not as reliable as the regular in-room connection,"
Burdick said.
He pointed out that lots of people using wireless at the
same time could clog the system and slow things down.
"If you're not using your wireless connection, please
disable it," Burdick said. "It will make it a lot better for the
other people."
Burdick predicted that "most, if not all dorms will
have some sort of wireless installed within the next five
to 10 years."
So maybe we're spoiled, technologically-addicted
brats. But we want our wireless and we want it now!
