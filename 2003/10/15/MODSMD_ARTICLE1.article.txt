# Seniors suggest speaker options
## 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Oct. 20 deadline for Commencement
speaker nominations approaching, just 6 percent of se
niors have submitted their picks.
About 100 of Stanford's 1,600 seniors have nomi
nated speakers, according to Senior Qass President
Mikey Lee, who believes that the number of nomina
tions will increase drastically as the deadline approach
es.
Some students attribute the low response rate so far
to a lack of publicity.
"They need to increase awareness that it is our re
sponsibility to choose someone," said senior Abby
Levine.
Senior Dana Craig, vice president of Commence
ment and special affairs, said that seniors may worry
that their vote doesn't matter.
"Students have a jaded view of the speaker selection
process," she said. "People seem to think that the Uni
versity has already chosen the speaker beforehand."
Craig said these rumors are unfounded.
"The administration has a voice and it will obvious
ly be heard, but it's mainly a senior class decision," she
said.
The selection last year of Peruvian President Ale
jandro Toledo as Commencement speaker raised com
plaints among that year's senior class. Lee said the
choice was justified.
"Enough people nominated Toledo for him to be
asked," he said. "It wasn't out of the blue."
According to yesterday's count, the top 10 nomina-

tions for Commencement speaker in
cluded former Secretary of State Made
line Albright, U2 lead singer Bono, for
mer President Bill Clinton, U.S. Sen.
Hillary Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, former South African President
Nelson Mandela, late-night talk-show
host Conan O'Brien, Governor-elect
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Time maga
zine columnist Joel Stein and TV per
sonality Jon Stewart.
In an effort to motivate seniors to
add their input to the decision-making
process, the senior class officials will be
in White Plaza today from noon to 2
p.m. to collect nominations.
After the nominations are collected,
the senior class presidents will present
University President John Hennessy
with a list of 20 potential speakers and a
suggested top five choices, based large
ly on class interest but also accounting

for other factors such as appropriate
ness and Stanford affiliation.
"Our main push this year has been
to get a huge pool of speakers," Craig
said. "We're tying to get a good idea of
who the most representative speaker of
our class would be."
So far, Craig said she has not seen a
group mobilizing behind one nominee.
Along with Hennessy, the senior
class presidents will select a speaker
based on class nominations, the per
son's tie to Stanford and the likeli
hood that the nominee will accept the
invitation.
"The administration strongly rec
ommends a solid Stanford tie," Lee
said. "We highly encourage people to
nominate those who have University
affiliation because we take that highly
into account to distinguish that it is a
Stanford graduation, not just any grad
uation."
In the past five years, all of the com
mencement speakers have been con
nected to Stanford. Of the current top
ten list, five of the nominees are affiliat
ed with Stanford.
