# How Sweet It Is

### MELISSA CHEE 
As Halloween approaches,
what more could an under
graduate ask for than a
haunted house, candy store
and bar all in one? Kiki's Candy Bar, a
shop on Emerson Street in downtown
Palo Alto, fits the bill on all three counts.
From Oct. 23 until Nov. 1 Kiki's
Candy Bar will be transformed from a
bright pink and orange candy haven to a
spooky center of sinister surprises. Tick
ets cost $l5, with proceeds benefiting
Palo Alto's All School's Fund.
In the upstairs haunted house watch
out for the huge black spider waiting to
capture you in its web of darkness. And
whatever you do never scream, or
you'll awaken the sleeping creatures.
Make sure to enjoy delicious choco
lates before you embark because they
may very well be your last. Visit the
Witches Den, where haunting eyes will
watch your every move and don't miss
the Living Dead graveyard scene. You
can even get a souvenir photo under an
eerie full moon.
Typically, Kiki's Candy Bar has
other attractions that draw Stanford
students too. The namesake candy
cocktail bar has all the attributes that
will amuse all fans of sweet treats
and don't worry if you are still under 21;
the bar couldn't be more dry if it were in
a freshman dorm party no really, it's
alcohol-free.
"I think what drew me there is that I
had heard about the candy bar," says
Ami Shah, a senior. "I'm not really into
candy all that much, but the idea of this
bar where you can order drinks like it's
actually a real bar is appealing to me."
"The candy bar IS Kiki's," says se
nior Dana Mauriello. "It's really a desti
nation for us, an escape. We go and
linger over really sugary candy drinks
and malt balls. Added plus: the cute high
school boys that work as bartenders."
In the back of the store, wooden
stools are arranged around a bar that
serves non-alcoholic "candy cocktails."
Fifteen different flavors of drinks are
served from Creamsicle and Fuzzy
Navel to Margarita and Cosmopolitan.
The hardest decision is whether you
go with the Double Bubble Bubbly gar
nished with gumballs or a Kiki-Rita with
Margarita Jelly Belly's? Or you can al
ways go retro with a Green River or
A&W long neck soda.
After getting "burned out" in the
tech business, Christy Weinstein decid
ed to make her debut in the candy busi
ness and now offers a confection for
every taste, from bulk candy to old-fash
ioned chewing gum brands in her store.
Weinstein opened Kiki's last Febru
ary and says her customers include
adults, college students and kids. It's a
place where lollipop trees still grow and
truffle town awaits.
"The atmosphere is just plain fun,"
Mauriello says. "We love to go there as
an escape from the stress of college, be
cause at Kiki's we can act like the kids we
are not adults we have to pretend to be."
Students suggest a stop at Kiki's
makes Halloween extra sweet and of
fers a relaxing escape from the demands
of school.
"It's nice especially because you're at
college and you're all stressed out but
then you go to this atmosphere where
it's so fun and there's candy ... it's real
ly relaxing," says Shah.
"I love Kiki's," adds Mauriello. "If
more people knew about it, more people
would go and if more people went, more
people would be in love with it like we
are. It'd be the new CoHo, the new Star
bucks. There's lots of sugar, what more
do you need? It's a good escape for any
one and it just puts you in a good mood.
Good mood guaranteed."
