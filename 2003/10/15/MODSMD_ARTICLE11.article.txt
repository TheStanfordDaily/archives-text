# Answer boy: Can we recall student representatives?
## 
### 
S* I was super psyched last week
• when Gray Davis was recalled
and Arnold Schwarzenegger be
came the governor of California,
is flicks (though I have my doubts
about FLiCKS), especially "Conan the
Barbarian" and "Last Action Hero." Can
we recall our student senators and replace
them with celebrities, too? I'm thinking
Ben Savage (of "Boy Meets World" fame)
and Kyle Alisharan (the easygoing athlete
on Canada's "Saved By the Bell" clone,
"Breaker High").

A • I certainly
/\ • sympathize
/ 1 with your fix-
JL ation on the
famous, Obsessive. Who
can help but be enamored
by Robert Downey, Jr.'s
struggles with substances,
Justin's turmoil with Brit
ney and Gary Coleman's
self-deprecating guberna
torial remarks? Celebri-

ties are here to entertain us, onscreen and
off. Except for that little kid from "The

Ring," who still gives me nightmares.
The good news is that you can, indeed,
recall your student representatives. Ac
cording to Section 3, Article J, Subsec
tions 1 and 2 of the widely revered ASSU
Constitution, all it takes is "a vote of the
student population" (as vague as the new
freshman Alcohol Policy) or a 2/3 vote by
the Senate to succeed in your very own
do-it-yourself recall. But, of all shocking
shockers, you must come up with a reason
for removal, which "shall include, but not
be limited to, actions that clearly violate
the intent" of the ASSU-or too many

meeting absences.
That "not be limited to" clause is impor
tant. It gives you leeway to impeach some
one for, say, receiving oral sex or allegation
that couches cost $lO,OOO. How "unbecom
ing," indeed.
But, you celebrity whore, a word of cau
tion: Savage, a senior, and Alisharan, a
graduate student, are ineligible of becoming
undergraduate senators.
