## Parking citations should change 
### 
If you've received a parking ticket in the
last year, you are not alone. More than
43,000 parking citations were issued
from January 2002 to December 2002,
and more than 24,800 citations have been
written since January 2003, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Laura Wilson, who spoke at
last week's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting, The most general violation was for
not having the proper permit (A lot, C lot, Z
lot or the residential lot) and for being parked
at a meter after time had expired.
Stanford law enforcement officers issue
the tickets, yet the revenue generated
over $1.5 million for 2002 alone doesn't
go to Stanford. Instead, the funds go to
Santa Clara County, Wilson said.
The problem at hand lies in a poorly ne
gotiated contract between Stanford and
Santa Clara County that was put into effect
nearly 30 years ago, when there was no
method for "forcing" people to pay their ci
tations. The Santa Clara County Sheriff had
to give permission to Stanford officers to
write citations and the bail had to go to
Santa Clara County. Until the mid 19905, an
arrest warrant could actually be issued if vi
olators failed to pay tickets. Currently, the
Department of Motor Vehicles can hold ve
hicle registration until fines are paid.
But the laws about parking citation is
suance and revenue collection have changed
since Stanford entered into this contract with
Santa Clara County 30 years ago. Stanford
can now legally collect the revenue from park
ing citations, although, Wilson added that the
relationship between Stanford and Santa
Clara County "is very complex."
Because parking revenue is only a small

piece of a much larger equation, the Univer
sity has not actively pursued trying to
change this particular agreement.
Though they haven't pursued it in the past,
it is the University's right to change this poli
cy. Not only would a contract renegotiation
provide a steady source of revenue, but park
ing is not a problem that will soon dissolve.
Localized control of parking laws and prac
tices works better for everyone. For an entire
county, a collection of $35 parking tickets may
seem like small change but for students on
limited budgets, each parking ticket can make
a dent. What often increases the aggravation
is that parking violators can never see the re
turn of their fees. If the revenue from the fines
went back to Stanford, at least students, facul
ty and staff could at least be consoled by the
thought that the money would go to improve
the community.
And while we understand that parking
cannot function on a free-for-all basis, the
process can still be logical. It makes no sense
that Stanford police officers are taking time
away from other activities to be writing tick
ets payable directly to Santa Clara County.
We suggest that the University consider the
needs of the thousands of students, faculty
and staff, and work to change their contract
with Santa Clara County. Since they now have
the ability to enforce these tickets, renegotiat
ing the contract to incorporate the Universi
ty's interest would be more understandable.
No one likes shelling out $35 (or more, de
pending on the violation), but shelling out
money to a place outside our own community
doesn't make sense either. It is time for this
antiquated agreement to get written up
and go away.
