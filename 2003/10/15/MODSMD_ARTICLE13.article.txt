Burst the bubble
The Daily's editorial board is
right to lament the difficulty stu
dents have in traveling to San Fran
cisco ("Students need more S.F. op
tions," Oct. 9), but its recent editori
al left out an exciting new solution,
City Car Share.
Thousands upon thousands of peo
ple would love it if Parking & Trans
portation Services could waive a
magic wand and finish CalTrain's up
grade. But with all magic wands being
needed in Sacramento these days,
P&TS did the next best thing and
brought City Car Share on campus.
The non-profit organization from
San Francisco offers a program that is
not just a consistent option for off
campus travel, it is flexible too. City
Car Share members reserve a car
when they want to use it, and pay only
for what they drive. Rates are $4 per
hour ($2 per hour between 10 p.m.
and 10 a.m.) plus 44 cents per mile.
Our members' average monthly
bill is about $65, compared to the
hundreds of dollars it costs each
month just to own a car in the Bay
Area. We are waiving the deposit for
members of the Stanford communi
ty and have made special provision
for 18 to 20 year-olds to join. It's all
part of our effort to make the Bay
Area beyond the Bubble more ac
cessible to Stanford students.
Two new Honda Civic Hybrids
are available to use immediately.
One each is parked in a designated
space at the Serra lot and at Tresid
der. More cars will be added as more
members join.
Stanford students are not alone in
referring to their college as "the Bub
ble," shielded from the outside world
for better or worse. This can be a good
thing during rolling blackouts or recall
elections. But when it keeps students
from experiencing the greatest city on
Earth and all there is to see in Bay
Area, it is time to find a way to burst
through the Bubble.
Stanford students could do a lot
worse than being at Stanford with
out access to a car. They could be at
Cal, for instance, or even USC. But
much of what is beautiful about this
area is best accessible by car. And

now with City Car Share on campus,
the cars are accessible, too.
City Car Share applications are
available online at www.citycar
share.org. Please call (415) 995-8588
with questions.

"Anfi-military" label unwelcome
I am writing to express my anger
after reading your article entitled
'Students back anti-military suit' on
Oct. 14. As one of the students sup
porting the campaign urging Stan
ford to join FAIR, it is both factual
ly incorrect and personally insulting
to find myself on the front page of
your newspaper depicted as anti
military. I have had the pleasure and
honor of serving my country in the
United States Air Force for six
years before coming to Stanford
Law School, and I continue to serve
as a Staff Sergeant in the Air Force
Reserve.
Choosing to disagree with the
manner in which a federal agency
conducts an unconstitutional cam
paign of coercion does not make me
or my fellow students "anti-mili
tary." Additionally, the article
missed the point that law schools
were prohibiting discriminatory em
ployers from recruiting because of a
prohibition on discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation. The De
partment of Defense, a civilian
branch of the government that ad
ministers / manages the actual
branches of the military, has openly
admitted that their policies are dis
criminatory. Granting the military
equal access to law school recruit
ment offices would violate a nation
al law school-wide standard. Al
though it would be easy to pigeon
hole this debate into one of
marginalized ideologies like
"pro- and anti-gay" or "pro- and anti
military" or even "pro- and anti
' Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy"
when in reality it is a substantive de
bate over constitutional rights.
The government wrote to 25 law
schools threatening to withhold fed
eral funding for the entire university
if they did not comply with their

standards. When one of the law
schools, Yale, wrote a response to
the Department of Defense asking
the government to clarify the stan
dards of compliance they expected,
they were told that their response in
and of itself was evidence of non
compliance. The department's po
lices are an outrage on any level, no
matter how you feel about our na
tion's defense system or its internal
policies. While I can understand
how your reporter may have mistak
enly construed this issue as "anti
military," I would hope that The
Daily would take more care before
labeling a group of students "anti
military" on your front page or on
any page without understanding
the actual issues at hand. As some
one who has spent six years serving
in the United States military, attend
ing funerals of friends who have fall
en in combat and consoling those
who have returned home injured, I,
for one, would appreciate it.

FAIR supporters should
be deported
It may be true that the military re
cruiting policies are flawed, even dis
criminatory. And, to protest this
makes sense; the military policies
should be revised to reflect the first
amendment. However, to protest this
by refusing to allow military re
cruiters on campus is a monstrosity of
a contradiction. How can American
citizens openly fight the people that
put their lives at risk for this country?
These people go to war to fight for
our freedoms. Without these people,
there would be no first amendment.
So how is it that FAIR supporters
claim they are fighting for people's
freedoms when they're actually hurt
ing those that are protecting our free
doms in the first place?
If you want to fight for fairness in
military recruiting, don't do it by at
tacking our military and, ultimately,
our freedoms.

space at the Serra lot and at Tresid
der. More cars will be added as more
members join.
Stanford students are not alone in
referring to their college as "the Bub
ble," shielded from the outside world
for better or worse. This can be a good
thing during rolling blackouts or recall
elections. But when it keeps students
from experiencing the greatest city on
Earth and all there is to see in Bay
Area, it is time to find a way to burst
through the Bubble.
Stanford students could do a lot
worse than being at Stanford with
out access to a car. They could be at
Cal, for instance, or even USC. But
much of what is beautiful about this
area is best accessible by car. And

now with City Car Share on campus,
the cars are accessible, too.
City Car Share applications are
available online at www.citycar

"Anfi-military" label unwelcome
I am writing to express my anger
after reading your article entitled
'Students back anti-military suit' on
Oct. 14. As one of the students sup
porting the campaign urging Stan
ford to join FAIR, it is both factual
ly incorrect and personally insulting
to find myself on the front page of
your newspaper depicted as anti
military. I have had the pleasure and
honor of serving my country in the
United States Air Force for six
years before coming to Stanford
Law School, and I continue to serve
as a Staff Sergeant in the Air Force
Reserve.
Choosing to disagree with the
manner in which a federal agency
conducts an unconstitutional cam
paign of coercion does not make me
or my fellow students "anti-mili
tary." Additionally, the article
missed the point that law schools
were prohibiting discriminatory em
ployers from recruiting because of a
prohibition on discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation. The De
partment of Defense, a civilian
branch of the government that ad
ministers / manages the actual
branches of the military, has openly
admitted that their policies are dis
criminatory. Granting the military
equal access to law school recruit
ment offices would violate a nation
al law school-wide standard. Al
though it would be easy to pigeon
hole this debate into one of
marginalized ideologies like
"pro- and anti-gay" or "pro- and anti
military" or even "pro- and anti
' Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy"
when in reality it is a substantive de
bate over constitutional rights.
The government wrote to 25 law
schools threatening to withhold fed
eral funding for the entire university
if they did not comply with their

standards. When one of the law
schools, Yale, wrote a response to
the Department of Defense asking
the government to clarify the stan
dards of compliance they expected,
they were told that their response in
and of itself was evidence of non
compliance. The department's po
lices are an outrage on any level, no
matter how you feel about our na
tion's defense system or its internal
policies. While I can understand
how your reporter may have mistak
enly construed this issue as "anti
military," I would hope that The
Daily would take more care before
labeling a group of students "anti
military" on your front page or on
any page without understanding
the actual issues at hand. As some
one who has spent six years serving
in the United States military, attend
ing funerals of friends who have fall
en in combat and consoling those
who have returned home injured, I,
for one, would appreciate it.

FAIR supporters should
be deported
It may be true that the military re
cruiting policies are flawed, even dis
criminatory. And, to protest this
makes sense; the military policies
should be revised to reflect the first
amendment. However, to protest this
by refusing to allow military re
cruiters on campus is a monstrosity of
a contradiction. How can American
citizens openly fight the people that
put their lives at risk for this country?
These people go to war to fight for
our freedoms. Without these people,
there would be no first amendment.
So how is it that FAIR supporters
claim they are fighting for people's
freedoms when they're actually hurt
ing those that are protecting our free
doms in the first place?
If you want to fight for fairness in
military recruiting, don't do it by at
tacking our military and, ultimately,
our freedoms.

Burst the bubble
The Daily's editorial board is
right to lament the difficulty stu
dents have in traveling to San Fran
cisco ("Students need more S.F. op
tions," Oct. 9), but its recent editori
al left out an exciting new solution,
City Car Share.
Thousands upon thousands of peo
ple would love it if Parking & Trans
portation Services could waive a
magic wand and finish CalTrain's up
grade. But with all magic wands being
needed in Sacramento these days,
P&TS did the next best thing and
brought City Car Share on campus.
The non-profit organization from
San Francisco offers a program that is
not just a consistent option for off
campus travel, it is flexible too. City
Car Share members reserve a car
when they want to use it, and pay only
for what they drive. Rates are $4 per
hour ($2 per hour between 10 p.m.
and 10 a.m.) plus 44 cents per mile.
Our members' average monthly
bill is about $65, compared to the
hundreds of dollars it costs each
month just to own a car in the Bay
Area. We are waiving the deposit for
members of the Stanford communi
ty and have made special provision
for 18 to 20 year-olds to join. It's all
part of our effort to make the Bay
Area beyond the Bubble more ac
cessible to Stanford students.
Two new Honda Civic Hybrids
are available to use immediately.
One each is parked in a designated
space at the Serra lot and at Tresid
der. More cars will be added as more
members join.
Stanford students are not alone in
referring to their college as "the Bub
ble," shielded from the outside world
for better or worse. This can be a good
thing during rolling blackouts or recall
elections. But when it keeps students
from experiencing the greatest city on
Earth and all there is to see in Bay
Area, it is time to find a way to burst

worse than being at Stanford with
out access to a car. They could be at
Cal, for instance, or even USC. But
much of what is beautiful about this
area is best accessible by car. And

now with City Car Share on campus,
the cars are accessible, too.
