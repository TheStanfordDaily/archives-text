## NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER Loving and loathing America 
### 
What do the following
items have in com
mon? The Golden
Arches, Levi's jeans
and Mickey Mouse.
You guessed it: They're all Ameri
can pop culture icons. They've been
plastered all over the world and are
instantly recognizable wherever you
travel. You can get your familiar ham
burger, salty fries and tall, bubbly
Coke or see a warm and fuzzy Disney
movie on the silver screen in nearly
every corner of the planet. This may
be a relief to weary travelers looking
for a reminder of home or to young
sters hungry for anything American,
but to many people around the world,
these are terrifying reminders that
one cannot escape the superpower
that is the United States.
As a group of Americans traveling
in a large pack throughout the east
coast of Australia, we can't help but
be noticed. As soon as one word
leaves our hps, we are instantly recog
nized as foreigners.
And not just any random foreign
ers our group is undeniably
American. We are greeted with a fas
cination and interest wherever we
go. (Perhaps the cardinal red Stan
ford garb also gives us away.) While
on a ferry from the mainland to
Stradbroke Island, we met a group of
college-aged Australian guys leaving
for their school holidays. In a matter
of minutes, our Stanford crowd was
chattering away with the blokes and
dancing to the familiar tunes of Em
inem and Puff Daddy blasting out of
their car, the Aussies delighted to be
interacting with such a big group of
"real" Americans. Many of them
knew a cousin, or a cousin who had
been to New York, or a friend who
had a neighbor who had once lived in
California, but here were 47 instant
American friends! And, to enchant
ment of these seven guys, 32 of them
were girls.
Yet between our fluffy, happy-go
lucky conversations about what music
we listened to or what movies we had

seen recently, an intriguing topic
emerged —and one that would be
repeated throughout our adventures
in Australia: What they really thought
of American culture.
Let me start by saying that the
phrase "that was too American" or
"you sound like an American" is not a
compliment in Australia.
How can it be, we wondered, that
Australians could have such a love
hate relationship with their fellow En
glish-speaking country? Although
they were reticent to tell us, Aussie
blokes revealed that they generally
thought Americans were too loud,
too eager to show off ("They always
want to stand out!" complained one

young guy who had
attended university
courses with
American ex
change students)
and generally cul
turally insensitive.
We were slight
ly taken aback.
Yes, we knew
about the stereo-

type of the Stupid American Tourist
the bumbling traveler who can't
speak anything but English and com
mits more verbal blunders than
George W. Bush when he pronounces
"Weapons of Mass Destruction" in
public discourse.
Yet this love-hate relationship is
not so simple, as relationships rarely
are. Sadly, many of their stereotypes
about American culture come from
Hollywood films, where the junkiest
and most ostentatious aspects of the
United States stand out. The blatant
violence in our movies is a stark re
minder to the rest of the world of the
violence we inflict on other countries
in the name of terrorist annihilation.
Even though many Aussie citizens
glower at our foreign policy, Australia
(among many nations) simply cannot
forget the importance of the support
of the United States in both defense
and trade and perhaps this adds to
their resentment. Whenever the Unit-

Ed States goes to war, whether fight
ing fascism, communism or terrorism,
Australia will usually trail along, act
ing as what Australian citizens see as
"America's lapdog" —hence their
involvement in both World Wars, and
the wars in Vietnam and Iraq. The -
misconception, however, is that all *
Americans support the actions of our
current government. I was disap- l
pointed to hear from one University •
of Queensland student that he -
thought most Americans were "igno- "
rant, pro-Bush rednecks."
I understand the loathing of some ~
übiquitous American exports. Believe •
me, I won't defend the speedy spread >
of fast food franchises throughout the "
world or the übiquitous presence of '
American music in the most remote lo
cales but Ido wish that Australians, •
and others around the world, could
come to see that not all Americans fit
the stereotype they have manufac
tured in their minds.
As Stanford students, we're often -
told that one day, we'll become "the
leaders of tomorrow's world." With
the ambition and drive that I've wit
nessed in Stanford students, I don't
doubt the validity of such a statement.
But my greater hope is that we can
help erase the idea that American cul
ture is always threatening and force
ful; that while there are some trashy
components, good things come out of
it, too. To do such a thing, however,
we'll have to work on our greatest
weaknesses: acting humbly. This
marks a shift from our current way of
thinking, since humility is character
trait that is neither really taught nor
emphasized in our culture and even
less so at Stanford, where the goal is to
be the best and the brightest. But if we
want other cultures to see past our
Golden Arches and Disney charac
ters, and see the rest of our culture, it
may be a way to start.

Even though many Aussie citizens
glower at our foreign policy, Australia

may be a way to start.

What do the following
items have in com
mon? The Golden
Arches, Levi's jeans
and Mickey Mouse.
You guessed it: They're all Ameri
can pop culture icons. They've been
plastered all over the world and are
instantly recognizable wherever you
travel. You can get your familiar ham
burger, salty fries and tall, bubbly
Coke or see a warm and fuzzy Disney
movie on the silver screen in nearly
every corner of the planet. This may
be a relief to weary travelers looking
for a reminder of home or to young
sters hungry for anything American,
but to many people around the world,
these are terrifying reminders that
one cannot escape the superpower
that is the United States.
As a group of Americans traveling
in a large pack throughout the east
coast of Australia, we can't help but
be noticed. As soon as one word
leaves our hps, we are instantly recog
nized as foreigners.
And not just any random foreign
ers our group is undeniably
American. We are greeted with a fas
cination and interest wherever we
go. (Perhaps the cardinal red Stan
ford garb also gives us away.) While
on a ferry from the mainland to
Stradbroke Island, we met a group of
college-aged Australian guys leaving
for their school holidays. In a matter
of minutes, our Stanford crowd was
chattering away with the blokes and
dancing to the familiar tunes of Em
inem and Puff Daddy blasting out of
their car, the Aussies delighted to be
interacting with such a big group of
"real" Americans. Many of them
knew a cousin, or a cousin who had
been to New York, or a friend who
had a neighbor who had once lived in
California, but here were 47 instant
American friends! And, to enchant
ment of these seven guys, 32 of them
were girls.
Yet between our fluffy, happy-go
lucky conversations about what music
we listened to or what movies we had

seen recently, an intriguing topic
emerged —and one that would be
repeated throughout our adventures
in Australia: What they really thought
of American culture.
Let me start by saying that the
phrase "that was too American" or
"you sound like an American" is not a
compliment in Australia.
How can it be, we wondered, that
Australians could have such a love
hate relationship with their fellow En
glish-speaking country? Although
they were reticent to tell us, Aussie
blokes revealed that they generally
thought Americans were too loud,
too eager to show off ("They always
want to stand out!" complained one

young guy who had
attended university
courses with
American ex
change students)
and generally cul
turally insensitive.
We were slight
ly taken aback.
Yes, we knew
about the stereo-

type of the Stupid American Tourist
the bumbling traveler who can't
speak anything but English and com
mits more verbal blunders than
George W. Bush when he pronounces
"Weapons of Mass Destruction" in
public discourse.
Yet this love-hate relationship is
not so simple, as relationships rarely
are. Sadly, many of their stereotypes
about American culture come from
Hollywood films, where the junkiest
and most ostentatious aspects of the
United States stand out. The blatant
violence in our movies is a stark re
minder to the rest of the world of the
violence we inflict on other countries
in the name of terrorist annihilation.
Even though many Aussie citizens
glower at our foreign policy, Australia
(among many nations) simply cannot
forget the importance of the support
of the United States in both defense
and trade and perhaps this adds to
their resentment. Whenever the Unit-

Ed States goes to war, whether fight
