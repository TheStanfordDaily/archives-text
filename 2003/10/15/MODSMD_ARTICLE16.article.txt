In response to Monday's article ("Full
Moon's future cloudy"), we were disap
pointed to read administrators' com
ments regarding reservations about the
Stanford tradition happening again in the
future. We feel that the article and the im
plications of the statements lead to a con
clusion that is hasty and based on alcohol
incidences for which we created the best
possible safety net.
Last Thursday's event was organized
in conjunction with the Office of Student
Activities and spearheaded by the Senior
Class Presidents and the ASSU. In the
weeks before the event, we established a
committee to address the issue of most
concern: the safety of all attendees.
The committee, which targeted three
specific areas alcohol, sexual assault
and contagious disease â€”consisted of
Assistant Director of Residential Educa
tion Josh Schiller, alcohol and drug edu
cation guru Ralph Castro and Carole
Pertofsky from Vaden Health Clinic,
Jamie Scalero from the Department of
Public Safety, Director of Public Events
Elaine Enos, the four senior class presi
dents, the ASSU executive cabinet and
senate, representatives from The Stan
ford Band, the junior and sophomore

class presidents, as well as Nanci Howe
of the Office of Student Activities.
Committee members set the ground
work after three hour-long meetings: de
tailed e-mails to residential staffs pointed
to alcohol as the primary subject to com
promise the safety of the attendees and
urged house leaders to "have frank con
versations with" and "[ask] residents to
not drink as heavily and be responsible."
Peer Health Educators set up tables in a
safe-zone, providing water and Listerine
to those attending. Dozens of uniformed
"Quad Squad" student volunteers
watched for trouble. Three deputies from
the Department of Public Safety and six
members of Stanford's Special Event Pa
trol roamed through the crowd, taking
care of the more serious cases. At the end
of the night, police lieutenant Hilary Karp
thanked us for our well-handled event.
This is not patting ourselves on the
back, mind you. When the dust had set
tled, there were still four people who had
been taken to the hospital for drinking
too much, one DUI and one arrest for
public drunkenness. While we applaud
the responsibility of those who stepped in
to take the intoxicated attendees to the
hospital, these incidences are of obvious
and deep concern to us.
But we pose the following question:
Are four incidences out of almost 3,000
attendees enough to warrant the immedi
ate threat of cancellation of the event?
Even with the utmost care, preparation

and education, those incidences still took
place. While we obviously would like the
statistic to be reduced to zero, we find it
impossible to control the personalities
and actions of every attendee.
Despite this challenge, a few of us will
be involved in an ASSU executive-initi
ated commission to look into Full Moon
on the Quad. The commission's first
agenda will include a discussion of what
went wrong this year, alcohol safety,
event safety and drastic changes that may
need to take place to further ensure the
safety of all present.
We agree with Police Chief Laura
Wilson's attribution from yesterday's ar
ticle that the problems probably came
from students "front-loading" or pre
partying in their dorms before the event.
Often, there are incidences and many
campus events similar to those faced on
Thursday. The fact that there are tradi
tionally several at this event has to do
with the fact that so many people attend.
The response to these incidences should
be on educating people to be safe when
pre-partying and to limit the amount of
alcohol they consume. Taking it out on
Full Moon on the Quad will not target the
root of these problems.
