## Throwbacks all about the superhumans 
### 
How many of us ran around the
house in a cape when we were lit
tle? How many of us jumped off
the swingset thinking we'd never
land? How many times did we save the world
in a pair of OshKosh B'Goshs? We all did.
But not Nolan Ryan. He came out of the
womb throwing 110 miles per hour. Not Wilt
Chamberlain. He could dunk when he was
six. Not Walter Payton? My dad used to tell
me that guy ran through brick walls for off
season training. These guys never pretended
to be superheroes; they didn't need to.
You know baby Batman and Superman
must've spent plenty of nights in little race
car beds and child-sized bodysuits dreaming
of throwing seven no hitters and scoring 100
points a clip.
Superhuman.
Bobby Orr, Ozzie Smith, Pistol Pete,
whoever. There's too many to name, and

they're all closer to myth
than man. We've never ac
tually met them, but who
cares, right? Their tales are
just too good. We've all sat
on Pop's knee while he fed
us stories of Paul Bunyon,
Carlton Fisk, Pecos Bill,
and Johnny Unitas: Stories
of times when the game
meant more, the players

were miraculous and life stood still when
these guys came riding into town. That spirit
of old used to be captured in the greatest su
perhero costume: the throwback jersey.
If you ever rocked a Spudd Webb Hawks
jersey you'd know exactly what I'm talking
about. The instant that throwback pops over
your head you're into the atmosphere off a
52-inch vertical leap, crushing the rim with a
360 windmill flush. As soon as you slip on the
Jim Brown retro you can smell the Cleveland
turf under your hooves and hear the childish
yelps of impaled defenders. These things are
magic.
We've forgotten that, though, as Super
pimp is the new name of the game and ev
eryone's doing it in the latest throwback.
Fat Joe in the Astros SXL rainbow jersey
showing off the new Lamborghini on Cribs.
Twelve-year-old Lil' Bow Wow in the
Kareem Abdul Jabar UCLA replica on Rap
City.
Even Grandpa, mowin' the lawn in the
Lite Brite-esque rainbow Nuggets throw
back to reel in the granny down the block.
I heard a kid at the movie theater showing
off the fresh Angels gear he'd dropped two
"hundo" on after he'd seen P. Diddy rockin'
it on TRL just so that he could pimp it at
"Finding Nemo."
TV's Uttered with ads of NeUy "schoolin'
me on the hookup" of all the matching
throwback apparel at Champs Sports.
My cousin copped his first Celtics throw
back after spotting R. Kelly in it in the "Igni
tion," video, because wearing it, he said,
would guarantee he'd "crush ass."
Crush ass? Well yes, you really can't
argue that, but what happened to Bill Rus
sell? The guy had 11 World Championship
rings. El-eeee-ven that's like winning a
gold medal as a bhnd marksman, it's just im
possible. Who cares, let's celebrate a guy
that crushes statutory ass.
And why not? R. KeUy's got the cars, girls
and fashions. Throw P. Diddy and Master P
in the same boat. They've got it all, and no
one's got it aU.
So why are they trying to get footholds in
the fashion industry and NBA?
Why'd Garth Brooks try out for the
Padres at the fat old age of 40?
Why'd Shaq try to be a movie star and a
rapper?
Why'd Jordan play baseball and start his
own branch off Nike?
To be Superhuman.
Do everything, defy reason, and blow the
world away. You see superstars pimping the
$4OO jersey, but they're stiU merely super
stars. They're doing everything to get to Su
perhuman, though, even fooling us.
What did Outkast and Nelly do to earn
their own throwbacks? Sure I can't rap but
there's a million of us that can. And throwing
Tim Couch and Juwan Howard on the back of
retro jerseys! Superhuman Couch? The sto
ries we'll be able to tell about these marvels!
"Well Kip, Tim Couch once led his team
to the playoffs and R. Kelly once pissed on a
fourteen year old!"
The throwback business is now worth
$5O million-plus a year and turns out
throwbacks in colors, combinations and
patterns you never even knew could exist.
The pride no longer rests in the superhu
man on the jersey back, if in fact the name
actually belongs to a superhuman, but in
the matching Pumas that took us three
months to track down.
Our capes today read Mitchell and Ness
on the label, and the house we're now run
ning through is tossing a party. But before
we save the world by rescuing the girl from
the sleazy guy in the corner, let's try to re
member to think not of the superpimps but
of the Superhumans.

Bret Bechis's best throwback is a white velour
Nuggets warm-up and he's got the hat to
match. E-mail him at bbechis@stanford.edu to

How many of us ran around the
house in a cape when we were lit
tle? How many of us jumped off
the swingset thinking we'd never
land? How many times did we save the world
in a pair of OshKosh B'Goshs? We all did.
But not Nolan Ryan. He came out of the
womb throwing 110 miles per hour. Not Wilt
Chamberlain. He could dunk when he was
six. Not Walter Payton? My dad used to tell
me that guy ran through brick walls for off
season training. These guys never pretended
to be superheroes; they didn't need to.
You know baby Batman and Superman
must've spent plenty of nights in little race
car beds and child-sized bodysuits dreaming
of throwing seven no hitters and scoring 100
points a clip.
Superhuman.
Bobby Orr, Ozzie Smith, Pistol Pete,
whoever. There's too many to name, and

they're all closer to myth
than man. We've never ac
tually met them, but who
cares, right? Their tales are
just too good. We've all sat
on Pop's knee while he fed
us stories of Paul Bunyon,
Carlton Fisk, Pecos Bill,
and Johnny Unitas: Stories
of times when the game
meant more, the players

were miraculous and life stood still when
these guys came riding into town. That spirit
of old used to be captured in the greatest su
perhero costume: the throwback jersey.
If you ever rocked a Spudd Webb Hawks
jersey you'd know exactly what I'm talking
about. The instant that throwback pops over
your head you're into the atmosphere off a
52-inch vertical leap, crushing the rim with a
360 windmill flush. As soon as you slip on the
Jim Brown retro you can smell the Cleveland
turf under your hooves and hear the childish
yelps of impaled defenders. These things are
magic.
We've forgotten that, though, as Super
pimp is the new name of the game and ev
eryone's doing it in the latest throwback.
Fat Joe in the Astros SXL rainbow jersey
showing off the new Lamborghini on Cribs.
Twelve-year-old Lil' Bow Wow in the
Kareem Abdul Jabar UCLA replica on Rap
City.
Even Grandpa, mowin' the lawn in the
Lite Brite-esque rainbow Nuggets throw
back to reel in the granny down the block.
I heard a kid at the movie theater showing
off the fresh Angels gear he'd dropped two
"hundo" on after he'd seen P. Diddy rockin'
it on TRL just so that he could pimp it at
"Finding Nemo."
TV's Uttered with ads of NeUy "schoolin'
me on the hookup" of all the matching
throwback apparel at Champs Sports.
My cousin copped his first Celtics throw
back after spotting R. Kelly in it in the "Igni
tion," video, because wearing it, he said,
would guarantee he'd "crush ass."
Crush ass? Well yes, you really can't
argue that, but what happened to Bill Rus
sell? The guy had 11 World Championship
rings. El-eeee-ven that's like winning a
gold medal as a bhnd marksman, it's just im
possible. Who cares, let's celebrate a guy
that crushes statutory ass.
And why not? R. KeUy's got the cars, girls
and fashions. Throw P. Diddy and Master P
in the same boat. They've got it all, and no
one's got it aU.
So why are they trying to get footholds in
the fashion industry and NBA?
Why'd Garth Brooks try out for the
Padres at the fat old age of 40?
Why'd Shaq try to be a movie star and a
rapper?
Why'd Jordan play baseball and start his
own branch off Nike?
To be Superhuman.
Do everything, defy reason, and blow the
world away. You see superstars pimping the
$4OO jersey, but they're stiU merely super
stars. They're doing everything to get to Su
perhuman, though, even fooling us.
What did Outkast and Nelly do to earn
their own throwbacks? Sure I can't rap but
there's a million of us that can. And throwing
Tim Couch and Juwan Howard on the back of
retro jerseys! Superhuman Couch? The sto
ries we'll be able to tell about these marvels!
"Well Kip, Tim Couch once led his team
to the playoffs and R. Kelly once pissed on a
fourteen year old!"
The throwback business is now worth
$5O million-plus a year and turns out
throwbacks in colors, combinations and
patterns you never even knew could exist.
The pride no longer rests in the superhu
man on the jersey back, if in fact the name
actually belongs to a superhuman, but in
the matching Pumas that took us three
months to track down.
Our capes today read Mitchell and Ness
on the label, and the house we're now run
ning through is tossing a party. But before
we save the world by rescuing the girl from
the sleazy guy in the corner, let's try to re
member to think not of the superpimps but
of the Superhumans.
