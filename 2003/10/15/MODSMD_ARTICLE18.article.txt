# Cardinal off and running
## 
### SEAN HOWELL 
The men's cross country team
pulled off a dazzling feat before they
had competed in even one race this
season: They all came back. Each of
the seven runners who helped Stan
ford to the NCAA Championship
last year has returned to chase an
other title.
Four of those runners recorded
top-10 finishes at last year's NCAA
Championships and six were All-
Americans.
"We have a fantastic situation
this year," said head coach Andy
Gerard. "We're a year older, which
means we're more experienced and
more confident, and the runners
have gotten some good work in over
the summer."
Because the main qualifying for
the NCAA Championships doesn't
take place until the NCAA Region
al in mid-November, Gerard has
used the first three races to rest
some of his runners and experiment
with his lineup.
"Until [the Pac-10 Champi
onships], we'll be using a variety of
lineups, resting people and moving
people around," he said.
Only one of the seven top re
turnees, senior Adam Tenforde, has
competed in all three races this sea
son. He has been the team's anchor
so far after a breakout year in 2002
in which he finished fourth in the
NCAA Western Regional and sixth
at the Pac-10 Championships.
Tenforde made a strong showing
at the Stanford Invitational on Sept.
27, placing second in the 8,000-
meter division and recently finished
third at the Finish Lynx/Murray
Keatinge Invitational.
The Cardinal secured five of the
top six spots in the 8,000 at the Stan
ford Invitational as senior lan Dob
son, the team's fourth runner at last
year's NCAA Championships, won
the race in 23:46, one second off the
course record.
Stanford also swept the top five
spots in the 4,000, won by junior
Ryan Hall, an All-American last
year.
The team secured the top four
spots at the Keatinge, where senior
Louis Luchini won the race in his

first collegiate competition since his
fifth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships last year.
With Grant Robison, Stanford's
top runner last season, held out of
every race so far, partly because he
competed late into the summer
with the track team, and with Lu
chini and Ail-American senior
Donald Sage having competed in
only one race apiece, Tenforde has
been the one constant in the Cardi
nal's lineup.
"The key to his success is that
he's stayed healthy and that he's
been training consistently," Gerard
said of Tenforde. "He's a big con
tributor to the team, and he's getting
better and better with each race."
The men's team has a great
chance to repeat as NCAA Champi
ons, especially with the return of
Seth Hejny, a seven-time All-Amer
ican in cross country and track and
field. He redshirted last season but
was Stanford's fifth runner at the
NCAA Championships in 2001,
helping the Cardinal to a second
place finish.
The women's team, which fin
ished second at the NCAA Champi
onships last season, is in a different
situation altogether. The squad has
some holes to fill after the depar
tures of Lauren Fleshman, Malindi
Elmore and Erin Sullivan, three of
its top five runners.
The arrival of 10 freshmen, in
cluding twin sisters Amanda and
Katy Trotter, will make that job a bit
easier.
"The freshman class has the tal
ent and potential to provide instant
results," said head coach Dena
Evans.
That talent was on display at the
Cardinal's most recent race, the
Keatinge. Freshmen Amanda Trot
ter, Arianna Lambie and Katy Trot
ter finished 1-2-3 as Stanford swept
the top seven spots.
The Cardinal experienced a
bump in the road at the Stanford In
vitational a week before, losing to
UCLA in the 6,000 meters and to
California in the 4,000 meters. That
pain was alleviated, however, by the

McWalters, who finshed second in
the 6,000.
Junior Alicia Craig set a new
course record at the Stanford Invita
tional in the 6,000, and junior Sara
Bei won the 4,000. They were the
Cardinal's first and third runners,
respectively, at the NCAA Champi
onships last year.
"[Bei] and Craig will complete a
formidable one-two punch in our
lineup," Evans said.
Any questions about the quality
of Stanford's newcomers have been
answered in the first three races of
the season. The one that still lingers
is whether they will be able to do
enough to help the Cardinal capture
its first NCAA Championship since
1996.

this year," said head coach Andy
Gerard. "We're a year older, which
means we're more experienced and
more confident, and the runners
have gotten some good work in over
the summer."
Because the main qualifying for
the NCAA Championships doesn't
take place until the NCAA Region
al in mid-November, Gerard has
used the first three races to rest
some of his runners and experiment
with his lineup.
"Until [the Pac-10 Champi
onships], we'll be using a variety of
lineups, resting people and moving
people around," he said.
Only one of the seven top re
turnees, senior Adam Tenforde, has
competed in all three races this sea
son. He has been the team's anchor
so far after a breakout year in 2002
in which he finished fourth in the
NCAA Western Regional and sixth
at the Pac-10 Championships.
Tenforde made a strong showing
at the Stanford Invitational on Sept.
27, placing second in the 8,000-
meter division and recently finished
third at the Finish Lynx/Murray
Keatinge Invitational.
The Cardinal secured five of the
top six spots in the 8,000 at the Stan
ford Invitational as senior lan Dob
son, the team's fourth runner at last
year's NCAA Championships, won
the race in 23:46, one second off the
course record.
Stanford also swept the top five
spots in the 4,000, won by junior
Ryan Hall, an All-American last
year.
The team secured the top four
spots at the Keatinge, where senior
Louis Luchini won the race in his

first collegiate competition since his
fifth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships last year.
With Grant Robison, Stanford's
top runner last season, held out of
every race so far, partly because he
competed late into the summer
with the track team, and with Lu
chini and Ail-American senior
Donald Sage having competed in
only one race apiece, Tenforde has
been the one constant in the Cardi
nal's lineup.
"The key to his success is that
he's stayed healthy and that he's
been training consistently," Gerard
said of Tenforde. "He's a big con
tributor to the team, and he's getting
better and better with each race."
The men's team has a great
chance to repeat as NCAA Champi
ons, especially with the return of
Seth Hejny, a seven-time All-Amer
ican in cross country and track and
field. He redshirted last season but
was Stanford's fifth runner at the
NCAA Championships in 2001,
helping the Cardinal to a second
place finish.
The women's team, which fin
ished second at the NCAA Champi
onships last season, is in a different
situation altogether. The squad has
some holes to fill after the depar
tures of Lauren Fleshman, Malindi
Elmore and Erin Sullivan, three of
its top five runners.
The arrival of 10 freshmen, in
cluding twin sisters Amanda and
Katy Trotter, will make that job a bit
easier.
"The freshman class has the tal
ent and potential to provide instant
results," said head coach Dena
Evans.
That talent was on display at the
Cardinal's most recent race, the
Keatinge. Freshmen Amanda Trot
ter, Arianna Lambie and Katy Trot
ter finished 1-2-3 as Stanford swept
the top seven spots.
The Cardinal experienced a
bump in the road at the Stanford In
vitational a week before, losing to
UCLA in the 6,000 meters and to
California in the 4,000 meters. That
pain was alleviated, however, by the

Senior Adam Tenforde and the Stanford men's cross country team have begun their quest to repeat as

faces the challenge of replacing three of its top five runners.
strong showing of freshman Teresa
McWalters, who finshed second in
the 6,000.
Junior Alicia Craig set a new
course record at the Stanford Invita
tional in the 6,000, and junior Sara
Bei won the 4,000. They were the
Cardinal's first and third runners,
respectively, at the NCAA Champi
onships last year.
"[Bei] and Craig will complete a
formidable one-two punch in our
lineup," Evans said.
Any questions about the quality
of Stanford's newcomers have been
answered in the first three races of
the season. The one that still lingers
is whether they will be able to do
enough to help the Cardinal capture
its first NCAA Championship since
1996.
