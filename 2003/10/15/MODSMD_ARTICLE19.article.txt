# Burdette bows out

### MIA LEE 
After unseating the top seed in the tournament during
an unpredictable week of season-opening play, Stanford ju
nior Erin Burdette had her eyes set on the tournament title
in the final of the Riviera / ITA Women's All-American
Tennis Championships.
But Burdette, attempting to become the first Stanford
woman in 13 years to clinch a title at the tournament, fell on
Sunday to California's Raquel Kops-Jones, 3-6,2-6.
No. 2-seed Kops-Jones, ranked third in the nation,
charged through to the final where she dispatched of Bur
dette in less than two hours to become the first African
American woman to win a national singles title at the
NCAA Division I level.
The showdown at Riviera came as no shock to Burdette.
"I grew up in the same age division as Jlaquel, and I al
ready knew she fought hard," she said. "She's very good at
dictating play."
Burdette and Kops-Jones have met twice in previous
years, at quarterfinals and semifinals of the Omni Hotels
Northwest Region Championships, with each player win
ning a match.
Kops-Jones had a leg up coming into the final after
breezing by unseeded Julie Coin of Clemson in the semifi
nals, a match that ended in a decisive win for Kops-Jones, 6-
3.6-2.
Meanwhile, across the net from Burdette in the semifi
nal, stood the top-ranked and top-seeded Agata Cioroch. A
senior at Georgia, she dropped just two matches last season
in the No. 1 position.
Burdette faced Cioroch only once before, at the 2002
Collegiate Kickoff Classic in Las Vegas, which ended in a 7-
5.7-6 Cioroch victory.
But this time the unseeded Cardinal remained undaunt
ed, honing her aggressive strokes and stamina to prevail in
three sets, 6-3,3-6,6-3.
Stanford head coach Lele Forood watched from the
sidines.
"Agata has an interesting game," Forood said. "She
starts out as a counter-puncher, [sitting] at the baseline just
trying to read her opponent. She found this didn't work,
and really started making her shots in the second set.
"But Erin's play was at a very high standard and she was
able to serve effectively," Forood continued. "[Overall],
she was just kind of back on her game."
In light of her unprecedented triumph in the Riviera
semifinals, Burdette has made an impressive recovery from
what Forood describes as an "injury-plagued season" in

2002.
"I think it set a very good tone for me," Burdette said.
"It's definitely going to help my confidence this year."
Stanford team member Alice Barnes, a sophomore, also
praised Burdette's efforts.
"[To Stanford], the star of the tournament was
Erin," Barnes said. "I think she worked really hard
over the summer because she's come out playing really
well. She probably won't tell you that because she's
modest."
Sixth-ranked Barnes had her own share of sensational
efforts at Riviera. Her first-round match against qualifying
Dianne Hollands of Arizona unfolded into a relentless
three-hour campaign. Barnes finally managed to pull out a
win, 7-5,4-6,7-6(5).
"Dianne was giving me trouble because she's a very fit
player,"said an enthusiastic Barnes. "She's had good condi
tioning and she was running me around. It was a really close
match and I really enjoyed it."
Barnes went on to lose in the next round to Tammy

Encina of Tennessee, 6-7(4), 1-6. However, she remains op
timistic.
"I think it was good to get a win-a tough one-early on.
Other than that, I need to work on getting 'match-fit'," she
said.
The Card also served up a win in the doubles consolation
finals following a disappointing first-round performance.
The top-ranked tandem of Lauren Barnikow and Erin Bur
dette was overpowered last Thursday, 5-8, by 18th-ranked
Amanda Johnson and Tory Zawacki, a newly formed pair
from Duke.
"We weren't being aggressive and finishing things off at
the net," Burdette said. "We knew we needed to come out
with more fire."
Barnikow and Burdette rallied back quickly to post a
swift 8-3 final victory over Jenny Kuhn and Julie Smekodub
of Tulane.
Forood best summed up Stanford's showing at the Ail-
American in saying, "Any wins down there are quality.
Losses are [simply] an opportunity to reflect."
