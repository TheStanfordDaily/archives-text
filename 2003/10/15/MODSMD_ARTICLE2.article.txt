# CLAS tries for degree privileges

### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Center for Latin American Stud
ies has submitted a proposal to the School
of Humanities and Sciences in hopes of re
gaining the power to grant degrees to un
dergraduate and master's students.
Anthropological Sciences Prof. Jim
Fox, the center's director, introduced the
proposal yesterday to the School of Hu
manities and Sciences — one of the first
steps in determining whether the pro
gram's degree-granting privileges will be
reinstated. If they are, undergraduates
will be able to earn degrees in Latin
American Studies as early as January, and
master's students will begin enrolling next
year.
Fox has been working for months to re
vive Latin American Studies after its de
gree-granting privileges were cut in 2001
amid controversy among faculty and stu
dents. He says the center has put the old
friction in the past.
"It's all water under the bridge," Fox
said. "We've used the time from January
2002 to the present to build as strong a re
lationship as we can with the affiliated fac
ulty."
Over the past several months, Fox has
presented various versions of new degree
program proposals, all of which have been
returned with suggestions for revision.
But Fox and his colleagues are confi
dent that the latest proposal addresses
concerns that have been raised regarding
the old program's structure.
Under the old program, undergradu
ates were required to take just one intro
ductory course before delving into their
chosen area of study.
Under the newly proposed program,
students would also take theory and meth
ods courses and an additional introducto
ry course in one of four tracks: culture and
identity, social science, environment and
ecology or health and medicine.
Also, the master's program will last
four quarters in addition to a summer of
field study, while the old program re
quired just three quarters of study on
campus. The students have to return for a
fourth quarter — an unusual require
ment for a master's program — so that
they can build off of their summer field
study and refine their academic pursuits
accordingly.

Professors said that the newly pro
posed program is much better organized
than the one that was cut two years ago
and are optimistic that it will be approved.
"There's a real housecleaning that has
gone on here, a real reintegration of
strengths, so I am hopeful it will gain fac
ulty support and approval," said William
Durham, professor of anthropological sci
ences and human biology.
According to Judith Goldstein, cog
nizant dean for graduate and undergradu
ate studies, the School of Humanities and
Sciences will decide by the end of the quar
ter whether to formally recommend that
Latin American studies start granting de
grees again. Academic council committees
and the Faculty Senate will make the final

decision, which Fox expects by December.
Durham said he feels that Stanford must
nurture Latin American studies if it hopes
to stay involved in that arena of scholarship.
"There's wide agreement that a major
is appropriate and sorely needed to really
keep Stanford a participant in the intellec
tual dialogue concerning the issues and
concerns of the Americas, especially with
respect to Latin America," he said.
Education and Economics Prof. Mar
tin Carnoy, who has been involved in
Latin American studies at Stanford for 30
years, agreed.
"We are a major U.S. university with
incredible connections to Latin America,"
Carnoy said, pointing out the Stanford has
an overseas program in Chile and that Pe

ruvian president Alejandro Toledo, a
Stanford alumnus, spoke at Commence
ment this June. "Here we have a major
American university with very close ties to
Latin America; we should have a Latin
America program. We should have under
graduates who can do a degree program in
Latin American studies."
Before the old program was slashed,
only six or seven undergraduates earned
degrees in Latin American studies each
year, Fox estimated, and an additional 12
or 13 students received master's degrees.
The Center for Latin American Stud
ies does still offer a minor as well as an
honors program, and they maintain an in-

dependently-endowed visiting
scholars program.
The University's decision to dis
continue Latin American Studies,
Fox said, was related to the quality
of the program, not the level of stu
dent interest.
Even though relatively few stu
dents traditionally earn degrees in
Latin American Studies, Fox be
lieves the program will be benefi
cial to students outside of the
major, too.
"We think having this intellectu
al community built around some
students who are really fired up
about Latin America will have a
sort of wave effect throughout the
University," Fox said. "Students
who are maybe not quite so inter
ested will still get a lot out of then
contact with our students."
