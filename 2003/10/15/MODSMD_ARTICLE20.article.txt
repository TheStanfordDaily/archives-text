# Obnoxious Stanford fans, shut up already
## 
### ALEX CLOSE THE DAILY BAROMETER 
You wanna know what really pisses me
off? Fans who don't know when to shut up.
You all know who I'm talking about;
you've all seen them. Hell, you might even
have been one at some game or another. A
lot of times I think alcohol can be attributed
to this atrocity. As we all know, however, al
cohol should never be an excuse.
Well, unless it's an excuse as to why you
got your ass kicked while watching an away
game last week.
Don't get me wrong, I love talking smack
to opposing players during games. It's great.
It's especially fun when you realize you've
gotten into their head. Once you realize that
all they can think about is the dirty mean
things you're saying to them and can no
longer function on the field or court.
It's beautiful. I think of it as doing what I
can for the team I'm supporting.
Now there are really only two mistakes a
proper smack-talking fan can make.
The first is to take their insults too far.
You generally want to keep things related to
the sport. I suppose it's okay to make fun of
someone for being short or tall or looking
young or old.
You never want to make fun of their
mother, that's just not cool. There's a good
chance their mom is there.
I'll tell you one thing, I wouldn't want to
mess with my mom in the stands; she can get
ruthless.
The next rule, which should never ever be
broken because it causes a complete backfire
for your team, is that a fan should immedi
ately stop talking trash as soon as his team
starts losing.
This, however, by no means should be
taken to suggest that a fan should stop yelling
when their team goes under. It only means
that a good trash talker should start encour
aging his own team rather than berating the
other when the score goes against his favor.
You see, in an athletic event, no one can
have anything bad to say to the winning
team. Both teams are there for one reason
and one reason only, to win. So no matter
what you say to the team in the lead, they can
refute your comment with a simple, "look at

the scoreboard jackass."
In the end, talking trash to a winning team
only makes you, your team and your institu
tion look stupid.
When your team is getting beat, they
need you to make them feel more confi
dent, and perhaps to boost their energy.
This is not accomplished by berating the
team that is beating them. In fact, that only
makes the winning team want to win by
more.
I would like to dedicate this week's col
umn to the men's soccer team.
As most of you know, the boys traveled
to the Bay Area this past weekend and
completely dominated both Cal and Stan
ford.
What most of you don't know is that the
Stanford fans are probably the worst in the
Pac-10. Maloney Field has always been
known as a bad place to play. Two years ago
they pretty much brought OSU goalkeeper
Peter Billmeyer's mother to tears with their
comments about her son.
See, that breaks rule number one, but
two years ago the Cardinal was winning.
This year the Beavers went up a goal 20
minutes into the game and those idiotic
(aren't Stanford students supposed to be the
best and the brightest) fans kept on talking
trash.
Not only were they talking trash, rumor
has it the.Stanford fans were utilizing the late
Joe Zaher and Stephen Hensor as buttons to
push on the Beaver players.
It's too bad, all that yelling and screaming,
all those comments and their team still got
their backsides handed to them on a silver
platter.
What did they expect, that making fun of
our dead homies was going to make us play
worse ... that Palo Alto sun must be warp
ing those kids' minds.
I guess it is tough when your team has
only won two games all season.
There's only one thing OSU students can
do to show that we are not only better but
also brighter than those crimson clad jokes.
When OSU plays Stanford in Corvallis on
the second of November at 1 p.m., we can all
show up and let the Cardinal players know
how horrible they are.
Even when they are losing by three goals.
You wanna know what really pisses me
