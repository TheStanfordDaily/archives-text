### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal men's golf
team competed at the Alister
MacKenzie Invitational a year ago,
it found itself in a tie for dead last
place after the second round.

UPDATE

So when Round 2 wrapped up
yesterday afternoon in Fairfax,
Calif., and the squad was in sixth
place in a field of 16, the Cardinal
had no reason to fear a repeat of last
year's performance.
The team managed to shoot a
combined 561 in the first two rounds
of play, putting it within 15 strokes
of leader Northwestern. Behind
Northwestern in the standings are
UCLA, Oregon State, San Jose
State and host California, all of
which are within seven strokes of
the of the Cardinal.
Sophomore Kyle Gentry tops
the list of Stanford golfers, carding a
four-under-par 138 going into the
final round, which places him in a tie
for seventh.
Close behind at one-under is ju
nior Kevin Blue, who is currently in
18th place, and freshman Zack
Miller is in 23rd with an even par
142.
Senior Ail-American Blake
Mastalir shot a 143, good enough for
30th, and freshman Matt Shin is in
the number 46 spot with his 145
score.
UCLA boasts the top player of
the tourney thus far, as Steve Con
way posted a 10-under-par 132, and
shot the lowest single round of the
competition with a 65.
Northwestern is dominating with
four of its five competing golfers in
the top-seven, including Tom John
son, who is in second with a 135.
Northwestern's Bryson Young is
in a three-way tie for third with Illi
nois' Joe Affrunti and Brian Kelley
of OSU. All three put up a score of
136.
Today will mark the end of the
tourney, as all 16 teams will shoot
their final 18 holes at the Meadow
Club.
