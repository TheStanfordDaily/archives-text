# Student brawl caught on tape at SJSU game
## 
### KEN LOTICH COURTESY OF THE SPARTAN DAILY 
U-WIRE The scene in the stands near the
end of the first quarter at the Sept. 18 football
game between San Jose State and Nevada was
one of utter chaos.
In the first few rows of the student section at
Spartan Stadium, punches and shoves came from
both sides of the crowd. More and more people
got involved, digging deeper into the stands.
Security personnel in yellow jackets ap
peared, along with two police officers doing
their best to break up the brawl.
Individuals were removed from the scene,
and the fight seemed to be under control.
A man in a blue shirt sneaked in one last
punch to someone a row below him, as securi
ty officials stood right next to the person. A
small scuffle emerged.
Security officials quickly restrained the man
in the blue shirt, as others around him flexed
their muscles and gave each other high-fives.
All of this was caught on camera, and the
video ended up in the hands of University Po

lice Department Capt. Shannon Maloney.
The video clip is an unusual and isolated in
cident found at an SJSU event, Maloney said.
"This fight was the worst I've seen in a long
time at this school, if not ever," Maloney said.
Incidents similar to the one at the Nevada
game are reasons why the NCAA had close to
150 representatives from different universities
meet on Feb. 20 in Dallas for a sportsmanship
and fan behavior summit.
On Sept. 16, the group released a report of
their findings to enable colleges to identify the
best practices they can use for local application.
The report contains different perspectives
and findings from their networking in Dallas.
It addresses the environment the game is
played in, security measures and different ways
universities have curbed bad behavior. The re
port also contains psychological and sociologi
cal perspectives on what causes spectator ag
gression.
SJSU Interim President Joseph Crowley
said the report released by the NCAA is very
timely, due to the increasing amount of inap
propriate fan behavior at college games.

"It seems to me there are more and more
problems with fan behavior, although not
specifically at San Jose State," Crowley said.
Crowley added that fans must realize bad
behavior will take away from the enjoyment of
the game.
"What we can do is provide a notice to the
general public that this type of behavior won't
be tolerated and violators will be prosecuted,"
Crowley said. "Games are to be played for the
players and the spectators there is no room
for fights in the stands."
Specific events at universities are also fisted
in the report, ranging from crowds storming
onto football fields to riots in the streets.
Ted Butryn, an assistant professor in
human performance, addressed the reasons in
his research as to why fans sometimes behave
aggressively.
"There has been fan violence for centuries,"
Butryn said. "Fans have had strong allegiances
to their teams, which has caused mass riots tak
ing thousands of fives."
Geoff Von Dollen, assistant athletic director
for SJSU, said he has noticed particular fan be

havior at games that have more riding on them.
"Fans can get really hyped for certain
games," Von Dollen said. "The importance of
a game especially rivalry games have
been the ones that have caused incidents."
Von Dollen said action on the field could
also have an impact on crowd behavior.
"If a referee makes a bad call, you'll hear
the 'boos' from the crowd, which may cause
them to get easily angered by others in the
crowd," Von Dollen said.
According to the report released by the
NCAA, the prohibition of alcohol at games is
not the solution to ensuring better fan behavior.
"In our experience, alcohol sometimes
causes this behavior," [Anne Palmer, general
manager of Spartan Stadium] said. "Some
times it has to do with the activity on the field
or interaction with the opposing team."
The report states: "Eliminating alcohol
from the intercollegiate athletics environment
will not eliminate incidents of fan violence.!
There are multiple reactions to alcohol con
sumption, and the vast majority of people in
volved in sports riots are not inebriated."
