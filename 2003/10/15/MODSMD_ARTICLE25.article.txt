## Alcohol poisonings plague Oklahoma University continues to struggle with enforcement of strict alcohol policy 
### JOSH RABE OKLAHOMA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) NORMAN, Okla. Pos
sessing alcohol in University of Oklahoma
residence halls is a violation of the Student
Code, but some on-campus residents have
found a solution to the problem.
Don't bring in a bottle of liquor. Instead,
drink the whole bottle and carry the alco
hol in your bloodstream.
It worked for one OU student until he
was taken to the hospital for potential alco
hol poisoning. In the last three weeks, four
OU students have been taken to Norman
Regional Hospital in Norman, Okla., for
medical assessment after drinking too
much.
Police say it is not clear whether the stu
dents consume the alcohol on or off campus.
"The university has tried very hard with
its alcohol education programs," said OU
President David L. Boren. "Unfortunately,
it is a nationwide problem with students in
this age group."
Around 1,400 college students die each
year from accidental injuries related to al
cohol, according to the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. About
5 percent of all four-year college students
have some involvement with police as a re
sult of drinking each year, including an esti
mated 110,000 students who are arrested
for alcohol violations.
In the most recent over-consumption in
cident, an OU student was taken to the hos
pital for medical evaluation shortly after 3
a.m. Thursday when a witness reported to
OU police that the student drank too much
and may have needed medical attention,
according to police records.
The student appeared "sometimes co

herent, sometimes not" when police ar
rived at her residence hall, according to po
lice records. The student was also described
as being "generally uncooperative with her
friends in the dorms and with officers."
Norman Regional Hospital Emergency
Medical Services paramedics determined
that the student required medical observa
tion following a field evaluation. Her
brother then transported her to the hospi
tal, according to police records.
Similar incidents occurred Sept. 27, 28
and 29.
One student was found near a residence
hall volleyball court, intoxicated to the
point where he was incoherent and semi
conscious. Another student was found fully
unconscious on the fifth floor of his resi
dence hall. The third was found on the sev
enth floor of another residence hall, lying
unconscious near an elevator, according to
police records. All were transported to
Norman Regional Hospital for evaluation
and treatment.
Boren describes the university's ap
proach to alcohol problems as a three
pronged system including enforcement of
university alcohol violations, keeping off
campus drinking in check and sponsoring
education for drinking responsibly.
Information on drinking responsibly is
available to students, but the message is ob
viously not getting through to everyone,
Sgt. Gary Robinson of the OU Department
of Public Safety.
"There is a difference between having
the information out there and having peo
ple actually using it," Robinson said.
Although alcohol violations on campus
increased between 2000 and 2001, fewer
students paid a criminal penalty for the in
fractions, according to the 2003 Sooner
Safety Report.
In 2001, 38 percent of liquor law viola
tions were referred to the campus discipli
nary system rather than the legal system. In
2002, the number of liquor law cases han
dled by university discipline rose to 71 per

cent of 488 total violations.
"First-time experimentation with alco
hol should not be a criminal offense,"
Boren said. "We use the law and police too
often to solve what is essentially a social
problem."
First-time alcohol violators can expect a
$4O university fine. The fine doubles for the
second offense, and the penalty can also in
volve facing the university disciplinary
process. Discipline is mandatory for the
third offense.
On the other hand, first-offense munici
pal citations start off at around twice the
university cost. Police involvement can
lead to jail time as well and charges that ap
pear as a criminal record.
"Students can request the case to go be
fore a Campus Disciplinary Board or nego
tiate a settlement," said Amy Holt, director
of Housing and Food Services regarding
university discipline.
"Sanctions may vary," she said. "How
ever, they all have an educational compo
nent to them. In conjunction to the discipli
nary system, students living in housing will
also meet with their Center Coordinator to
talk about the behavior and how it impacts
those who live around them."
Alcohol education programs go on in
housing throughout the year, she said.
Robinson said students need to be less
selfish when another student's life is threat
ened by complications associated with al
cohol consumption.
"If you have got a severely drunk per
son, one of the things you can do is get them
in a room and monitor them to make sure
they are all right," Robinson said. "If you
are not sure, call the police because this
person might die."
If the police find a drunk person alone,
they are left with few options, he said.
"There is no detox center in Cleveland
County," Robinson said of the Norman
area. "If we can't find anyone to take care
of the person, they only have two options:
the hospital or jail."

medical assessment after drinking too
much.
Police say it is not clear whether the stu
dents consume the alcohol on or off campus.
"The university has tried very hard with
its alcohol education programs," said OU
President David L. Boren. "Unfortunately,
it is a nationwide problem with students in
this age group."
Around 1,400 college students die each
year from accidental injuries related to al
cohol, according to the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. About
5 percent of all four-year college students
have some involvement with police as a re
sult of drinking each year, including an esti
mated 110,000 students who are arrested
for alcohol violations.
In the most recent over-consumption in
cident, an OU student was taken to the hos
pital for medical evaluation shortly after 3
a.m. Thursday when a witness reported to
OU police that the student drank too much
and may have needed medical attention,
according to police records.
The student appeared "sometimes co

herent, sometimes not" when police ar
rived at her residence hall, according to po
lice records. The student was also described
as being "generally uncooperative with her
friends in the dorms and with officers."
Norman Regional Hospital Emergency
Medical Services paramedics determined
that the student required medical observa
tion following a field evaluation. Her
brother then transported her to the hospi
tal, according to police records.
Similar incidents occurred Sept. 27, 28
and 29.
One student was found near a residence
hall volleyball court, intoxicated to the
point where he was incoherent and semi
conscious. Another student was found fully
unconscious on the fifth floor of his resi
dence hall. The third was found on the sev
enth floor of another residence hall, lying
unconscious near an elevator, according to
police records. All were transported to
Norman Regional Hospital for evaluation
and treatment.
Boren describes the university's ap
proach to alcohol problems as a three
pronged system including enforcement of
university alcohol violations, keeping off
campus drinking in check and sponsoring
education for drinking responsibly.
Information on drinking responsibly is
available to students, but the message is ob
viously not getting through to everyone,
Sgt. Gary Robinson of the OU Department
of Public Safety.
"There is a difference between having
the information out there and having peo
ple actually using it," Robinson said.
Although alcohol violations on campus
increased between 2000 and 2001, fewer
students paid a criminal penalty for the in
fractions, according to the 2003 Sooner
Safety Report.
In 2001, 38 percent of liquor law viola
tions were referred to the campus discipli
nary system rather than the legal system. In
2002, the number of liquor law cases han
dled by university discipline rose to 71 per

cent of 488 total violations.
"First-time experimentation with alco
hol should not be a criminal offense,"
Boren said. "We use the law and police too
often to solve what is essentially a social
problem."
First-time alcohol violators can expect a
$4O university fine. The fine doubles for the
second offense, and the penalty can also in
volve facing the university disciplinary
process. Discipline is mandatory for the
third offense.
On the other hand, first-offense munici
pal citations start off at around twice the
university cost. Police involvement can
lead to jail time as well and charges that ap
pear as a criminal record.
"Students can request the case to go be
fore a Campus Disciplinary Board or nego
tiate a settlement," said Amy Holt, director
of Housing and Food Services regarding
university discipline.
"Sanctions may vary," she said. "How
ever, they all have an educational compo
nent to them. In conjunction to the discipli
nary system, students living in housing will
also meet with their Center Coordinator to
talk about the behavior and how it impacts
those who live around them."
Alcohol education programs go on in
housing throughout the year, she said.
Robinson said students need to be less
selfish when another student's life is threat
ened by complications associated with al
cohol consumption.
"If you have got a severely drunk per
son, one of the things you can do is get them
in a room and monitor them to make sure
they are all right," Robinson said. "If you
are not sure, call the police because this
person might die."
If the police find a drunk person alone,
they are left with few options, he said.
"There is no detox center in Cleveland
County," Robinson said of the Norman
area. "If we can't find anyone to take care
of the person, they only have two options:
the hospital or jail."
