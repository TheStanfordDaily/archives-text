# Berkeley Urban Outfitters pulls 'Ghettopoly' after complaints
## 
### RACHEL KING DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) A controversial board
game was yanked from the shelves of Urban
Outfitters locations in Berkeley, Calif., and
across the country last week, after critics
launched a campaign against the game, call
ing it racist and discriminatory.
Ghettopoly not affiliated with the
Hasbro board game Monopoly was re
moved from stores after several organiza
tions attacked the game. Some of the groups
that are opposed to the game include the
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and the National Asian
Pacific American Legal Consortium.
Ghettopoly's logo is a black man with a
bottle of malt liquor in one hand and a gun
in the other, and the game pieces include a
marijuana leaf, crack cocaine, a basketball
and a pimp.
Players travel around the board, choos
ing "Hustle" or "Ghetto Stash" cards and
buying stolen properties, including "Busta
Rap Recording," "Smitty's XXX Peep
Show," and "Tyrone's Gun Shop."
Urban Outfitters, a retail clothing store
which also sells novelty items such as a Jesus
action figure and a "White Trash" doll,
began selling the game a month ago, but re

moved remaining inventory from its shelves
on Thursday.
Store managers at the Berkeley and San
Francisco locations declined to comment.
Although the game's creator, David
Chang, said the game is meant to be funny,
not everyone agrees that the game is just for
laughs. Some said the jokes reinforce nega
tive stereotypes about minorities.
One "ghetto stash" card reads, "You got
yo whole neighborhood addicted to crack.
Collect $5O from each play a."
"It depicts the idea that only minorities
live in the ghettos and all they do is drink
and smoke weed," said UC-Berkeley
sophomore Donna Yee.
Chang, who immigrated with his family
from Taiwan at the age of 8, said in a press
statement that the game is meant to be "ex
treme and eye-catching."
"Ghettopoly is controversial because it's
both fun and real life," Chang said. "The
graphics on the board depict every race in
the country and both genders. It draws on
stereotypes not as a means to degrade, but
as a medium to bring together in laughter."
The criticism has not hurt the game's
popularity, however. It has already sold out
on the game's Web site.
Chang's second game, "Redneckopoly,"
is due out later this fall.
