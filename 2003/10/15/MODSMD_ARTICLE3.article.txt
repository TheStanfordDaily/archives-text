# Santa Cruz Ave. to undergo construction
## 
### DAVID HERBERT 
The busy section of Santa Cruz Av
enue that connects Sand Hill and Alpine
roads will be closed for six months in 2005
for improvements, a move that has re
ceived mixed reviews from Stanford stu
dents and local residents.
The construction is scheduled to last
from April to October of 2005.
Motorists will still be able to turn onto
Junipero Serra Boulevard from Alpine
Road and continue on Sand Hill Road,
but they will not be able to use Santa Cruz
to move from one to the other, said Stan
ford Director of Community Relations
Andy Coe.
The Santa Cruz Avenue construction
involves revamping the two intersections
and widening the road to improve the
flow of traffic, as part of a much larger ef
fort to upgrade the roads around campus.
Several years ago, Sand Hill Road was
extended to El Camino Real in an effort
to ease traffic congestion. Plans are also
in the works to expand Sand Hill Road
from two lanes to four lanes.
"This work is long overdue," Coe said.
Despite the long-term benefits of the

project, some at Stanford and in the sur
rounding area are worried about the
short-term implications.
"It's going to be a nightmare," said
Jennifer Windsor, a resident of the near
by Sharon Green Apartments. "I had no
idea they were even thinking of doing
this."
According to Coe, the overwhelming
majority of Menlo Park residents have
shown in numerous polls that they like the
plan.
"There is almost two-to-one support
for the project in Menlo Park," he said.
Coe said that Stanford is trying to raise
awareness about the project in neighbor
ing communities.
"We are doing a lot of outreach to res
idents and businesses," he said.
Some are also concerned about the
short-term economic implications. Leticia
Tamayo, an assistant manager at Longs
Drugs in the Sharon Heights shopping
center, predicted that the construction
will affect business.
"Many of our customers from Stanford
will be inconvenienced and may turn to
more accessible pharmacies," she said.
Coe disagreed.

"This shouldn't change shopping pat
terns because the closure will be tempo
rary," he said.
For Stanford students, the project will
make it much more difficult to get to the
Safeway in Sharon Heights, colloquially
known as "Secret Safeway."
"I would have no idea how to get there
without that stretch of road," said junior
Schuyler Ullman, a frequent patron of the
grocery store.
Ullman raised a concern that the pro
ject would not be completed within the
proposed time frame.
"Until very recently, a portion of Cam
pus Drive West had been closed for con
struction for as long as I'd been here," he
said. "Who's to say this will be any differ
ent?"
Still, many remained optimistic, at
least for now.
"If it works like it should, and traffic
moves better, then I'm all for it," Tamayo
said.
Ullman agreed.
"I'll be gone when it is completed, but
if future generations of Stanford students
can have improved access to Secret Safe
way, then I say, let's do it," he said.
