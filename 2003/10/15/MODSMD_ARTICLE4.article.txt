# Law students seek ASSU support
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Four Stanford law students urged the ASSU last night
to support efforts to push the University to join a lawsuit
against the Department of Defense. The suit, issued by
an association of academic institutions, alleges that the
government violates the First Amendment by threaten
ing to remove federal funding from universities that for
bid its recruiters to visit their campuses.
The Law School's non-discrimination policy prevents
organizations that discriminate based on race, gender,
sexual orientation and other classifications from recruit
ing on the Law School campus.
"Because of the military's explicit 'Don't ask, don't
tell' [policy] and their continued persecution of members

that are gay, they are incompatible with our non-dis
crimination policy," law student Luke Barefoot said.
Congress passed the Solomon Amendment in 1994,
which threatened to withdraw federal funding from
schools that do not allow military recruiters on campus.
"The message of the Solomon Amendment is, 'We
will tell you what your discrimination policy will or will
not be,' " said Anne Irwin, another law student.
In 2001, the Department of Defense reinterpreted the
Amendment to allow the federal government to with
draw federal funding from the entire university, even if
just one school forbids military recruitment. This, said
Barefoot and Irwin, makes Stanford liable to lose $430
million in federal funding.
"That's more than any other in
stitution in America is facing,"
Barefoot said.
"Unlike other law schools, Stan
ford has not yet been unlucky
enough to receive a non-compliance
letter," Barefoot said. "Stanford is
not yet directly at threat."
In the past, the Law School has
found a loophole in the law by al
lowing interested law students to
meet with military recruiters at un
dergraduate sites on campus such as
the Career Development Center,
according to Irwin. The University
does not include sexual orientation
in its non-discrimination policy, she
said, but the law school does.
"If I were an undergraduate, that
would offend me," she said. "It's as
if [undergraduates] were housing
the recruiters that we rejected."
In response to the Department
of Defense's potential sanctions
against schools like Stanford, an
anonymous association of law
schools formed the Forum for Aca
demic and Institutional Rights,
which filed a suit against the de
partment on First Amendment
grounds.
Stanford has declined to join
FAIR and has prohibited Law

School faculty, as a collective, from
joining FAIR using the Stanford
name, Barefoot said. Faculty mem
bers can, however, join the suit as in
dividual plaintiffs.
"What we're trying to do is put
pressure on [University President
John] Hennessy," said law student
Ryan Clark.
The Senate decided to vote next
week on whether to advocate Stan
ford joining of the association.
In other Senate news, Nanci
Howe, assistant dean and director of
student activities, reassured sena
tors that the possibility of Full Moon
on the Quad for next year is not
dead and buried yet.
"I'm going to be working with the
ASSU to work on Full Moon on the
Quad for next year," she said.
"There were concerns for Full
Moon, but I don't want people to
feel that there's been some Univer
sity decision to cancel Full Moon.
The issue really is how do we work
to resolve some of the issues we've
had this year."
Also, ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli announced the beginning of
the Absolute Fun campaign.
"Tomorrow night will be the first
Absolute Fun event," he said.
"We're giving out free Cold Stone
ice cream at 11 p.m. [in White
Plaza]. There will be sorbet. There
will be a variety of options for all
types of dietary needs and philo
sophical thought."
