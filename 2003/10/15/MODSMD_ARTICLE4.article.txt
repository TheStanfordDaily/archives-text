# Law students seek ASSU support
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Four Stanford law students urged the ASSU last night
to support efforts to push the University to join a lawsuit
against the Department of Defense. The suit, issued by
an association of academic institutions, alleges that the
government violates the First Amendment by threaten
ing to remove federal funding from universities that for
bid its recruiters to visit their campuses.
The Law School's non-discrimination policy prevents
organizations that discriminate based on race, gender,
sexual orientation and other classifications from recruit
ing on the Law School campus.
"Because of the military's explicit 'Don't ask, don't
tell' [policy] and their continued persecution of members

that are gay, they are incompatible with our non-dis
crimination policy," law student Luke Barefoot said.
Congress passed the Solomon Amendment in 1994,
which threatened to withdraw federal funding from
schools that do not allow military recruiters on campus.
"The message of the Solomon Amendment is, 'We
will tell you what your discrimination policy will or will
not be,' " said Anne Irwin, another law student.
In 2001, the Department of Defense reinterpreted the
Amendment to allow the federal government to with
draw federal funding from the entire university, even if
just one school forbids military recruitment. This, said
Barefoot and Irwin, makes Stanford liable to lose $430
million in federal funding.
