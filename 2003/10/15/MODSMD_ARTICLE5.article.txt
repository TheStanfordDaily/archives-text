# Lagunita alarms wake sleeping residents
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Early yesterday morning, Lagunita Court residents
were awakened twice by false alarms that were trig
gered by a malfunctioning fire-alarm system.
The alarms prompted an evacuation of all the
dorms in Lagunita, leaving hundreds of students out
side, some wearing overcoats over their pajamas.
"I was upset," said senior Kevin Dious, an Ujamaa
resident. "Initially I thought maybe it was a glitch,
since it went off earlier. And then it happened again a
second time, and it was unacceptable."
The first alarm was triggered by a lounge smoke de

tector in Naranja at 4:03 a.m. The Palo Alto Fire De
partment responded, and when they did not find any
danger, they turned off the alarm and reset the system.
Soon after the fire trucks left, however, the alarm
went off again, at 4:45 a.m., in the same place. The fire
fighters silenced the alarm system and called Stanford
facilities to take care of the problem.
"I was pissed, really mad," said Hamida Hamza, an
Ujamaa freshman. "TTie second alarm happened just
as everyone went back to sleep."
Hamza says she slept through her alarm and was 15
minutes late to math class in the morning.
"I wanted to punch somebody,"
said Eucalipto freshman Chetan
Puttagunta. "We were all pissed."
Not everyone was so upset by the
alarms, and some students did not
even notice them.
"I slept through it," said sopho
more Grant Sohn, who lives in Uja
maa. "I'm a heavy sleeper."
The case was a normal false
alarm for the fire department, ac
cording to Battalion Chief Don Lo
quiao. He said that it was unlikely
that a student caused the alarm.
"It was more that an independent
system was not being functional," he
said.
Loquiao said he could not com
ment on the possibility that planned
alarms that took place at 9 p.m. that
evening contributed to the false
alarms.
