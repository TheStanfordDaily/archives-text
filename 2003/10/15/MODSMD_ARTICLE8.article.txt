Last year, the military did not re
cruit on the Stanford Law School
campus because students did not
show sufficient interest in military
careers; the absence of recruiters
was unrelated to the military's
policy of not hiring openly gay
people. The Law School did not
attempt to join the Forum for
Academic and Institutional
Rights' lawsuit last year but dis
cussed bringing a lawsuit in its
own name. Finally, the members
of FAIR are anonymous, which is
why Stanford would have no rea
son to fear retaliation from the
federal government.
