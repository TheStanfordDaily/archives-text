## I'm a sex slave 4 U 
### 
Sometimes late at night when I'm feed
ing the rapacious washing machine
down the hall by sticking yet more
quarters into its gaping, hungry coin
slots, I fantasize about the time when Stanford
provided laundry service for its undergrads.
Wouldn't it be great to have have someone
take care of those little errands for you?
A certain guy who I knew thought the

same. His parents rhap
sodized about how he could
wash his hands of washing
his clothes once he came to
Stanford. So when he ar
rived at his dorm and found
to his chagrin that the suds
ing program had been can
celed, his mom got prag
matic. "You'll just have to
find a girlfriend," she said.
Her son followed the ad-

vice, and his laundry issue was resolved
thanks to his rather subservient (in my ever
humble opinion) sweetheart.
It's a widespread complaint that there are
two extremes of Stanford dating: random
hook-ups and virtual marriage, with nothing
betwixt the two, whether you're gay or
straight. This myth has more than a kernel of
truth: People seem to get annoyed when you
tell them that you're looking to date casually
rather than commit. When people who are
not habitual hook-uppers do find a warm
(hot?) body willing to settle down, they seem
to latch on to it as if one's partner were the
erotic equivalent of the last glass of pinot
noir at Wine and Cheese night.
But Stanford students are not always set
tling into garden-variety, long-term relation
ships. Lately, I've observed a rise in the fre
quency of "friends with benefits" (a.k.a
"friends-with-privileges," a.k.a, "perpetual
sack hoppers"). In such a relationship, people
sexually service each other on a regular basis
without committing to each other. What's sur
prising about this upswing is that the same
trend can be observed for students of different
ethnic backgrounds—there are none of the
cultural discrepancies that you would expect.
Proponents of repeated no-strings (except
maybe G-strings)-attached trysts say that
they're just being practical.
"I feel as if we should be able to, as young
adults, find some type of middle ground that
would allow for both partners to gain satis
faction from the relationship while not
being deterred from their studies," says stu
dent Donte Rayford. "This middle ground
should be called the not-random-but-more
than-often hookup."
Is he saying that Stanford students should
have mere sex partners?
"Yes and no," he says. "There should be
that certain someone that you can turn to in
order to release the sexual frustrations which
are bound to develop in us all. But the activi
ties shared between these two individuals
shouldn't be restricted to sex."
Rayford sees "friends with benefits" as ex
pedient in terms of time. "When you are stuck
in a relationship, if your partner wants to
spend some quality time with you, you really
don't have much of a choice. The not-ran
dom-but-more-than-often hookup partner
shall be content with spending time with you
only when you're free."
"Who needs an extra five units?" concurs
freshman Quaneisha Jenkins.
One Stanford female in a long-term rela
tionship who preferred not to be identified
says, "People don't casually date because they
don't have time. Considering how much work
Stanford students do, they're not going to de
vote a lot of effort into dating around if things
don't seem promising. People see me as being
'married,' but I really wouldn't bother to
maintain a casual relationship because I have
other things to do."
Most of us are familiar with that hoary
adage, "Why buy the cow when you can get
the milk for free?" Considering some recent
stories told by female friends and acquain
tances, I think there's a parallel, albeit less sex
ually gratifying, phenomenon going on with at
least some of those friends with benefits: Why
buy the bull when you can get the s— for
free?
In other words, these masochistic
ladies(and some men as well) seem to be
putting up with the drama of a relationship
without exacting any of a relationship's con
comitant security. Usually one of the
"friends" wants more than the other will
give, but they take what they can get. I can't
help but think of that quintessential piece of
elevator music, the Eurythmics' "Sweet
Dreams:" "Everybody's looking for some
thing / Some of them want to use you /
Some of them want to be used by you/
Some of them want to abuse you / Some of
them want to be abused." Why let yourself
be exploited when you could have a quality
relationship or get to know a variety of peo
ple casually?
Some people, like freshman Shamika
Walker, refuse to settle. "I would do whatever
it took, within legal and spiritual limits, to ob
tain the ideal long-term relationship," she says.
Why don't more of us dare to satisfy our naked
ambition when it comes to romance?
