Centennial Chats
Centennial Chats are informal gatherings of unique Memorial
Church figures in celebration of the 100 year old church.
Sponsored by the Office for Religious Life.
All are welcome!
*Oct. 16 - Memorial Chureh
Wedding Coordinator, Betsy Koester
Come hear tales of wedding woe and bliss from
every religious and cultural tradition, including
Sufi, Jewish and Muslim. Betsy has overseen wed
dings in the church since 1984 and is a 1958
Stanford graduate.
*Nov. 12 - University Organist,
Robert Huw Morgan
Join Robert for a chat about the four organs and
the life of the University Organist. Listening to
the organist play was recently listed by the NY
Times as one of the top things to do if you visit
Palo Alto.
*Dec. 9 - Memorial Church's Chief
Conservator, Lesley Bone
Lesley will delve into the history, art and
architecture of this unique structure. She oversaw
the church's restoration after the 1989 earthquake
and co-wrote Glory of Angels.
All "chats" begin at 5 p.m. in the Side Chapel of Memorial Church.
