# MEChA upset at KKK comparison by The Review
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
An article and editorial in yesterday's Stanford
Review that accused the campus chapter of
MEChA of supporting racism has garnered a
strong, negative response from Stanford's Chi

In an editorial titled "MEChA: Social Justice
Group or KKK?" The Review called MEChA "a
racist organization that advocates revolution and
segregation," dubbing it "the modern-day Ku Klux

Stanford MEChA, or Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan, is a Chicano/Latino student
group that focuses on social activism and cultural

MEChA. "But they were misinformed and, based
on that misinformation, made judgments on our
group that were libel."
Godinez-Avina's co-chair, sophomore Francis
co Cendejas, said that The Review's claims were
based on two documents that date from the 19605,
when MEChA was established. He says that
MEChA no longer subscribes to all the views put
forth in the documents.
The Review said those two documents, El Plan
de Aztlan and El Plan Espiritual of Santa Barbara,
have racist and separatist messages. By extension,
he said, MEChA is also guilty.
"Our point is to emphasize that here's an orga
nization that still, under its historical foundations,
has racist literature that they may have disavowed
but haven't renounced," said junior Stephen
Cohen, public relations manager of The Review.
"Even if there is only a weak connection, The Re
view still feels that connection is worth investigat
ing and looking it."
MEChA said that El Plan de Aztlan is not sup
ported by any MEChA group, and that the nation-
