# MEChA upset at KKK comparison by The Review
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
An article and editorial in yesterday's Stanford
Review that accused the campus chapter of
MEChA of supporting racism has garnered a
strong, negative response from Stanford's Chi
cano 7 Latino community.
In an editorial titled "MEChA: Social Justice
Group or KKK?" The Review called MEChA "a
racist organization that advocates revolution and
segregation," dubbing it "the modern-day Ku Klux
Klan of Chicanos."
Stanford MEChA, or Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan, is a Chicano/Latino student
group that focuses on social activism and cultural
awareness. The group's members said they felt
hurt by the accusations of the article and editorial,
which they said were inaccurate.
"We are open to criticism from the communi
ty," said junior Laura Godinez-Avina, co-chair of
MEChA. "But they were misinformed and, based
on that misinformation, made judgments on our
group that were libel."
Godinez-Avina's co-chair, sophomore Francis
co Cendejas, said that The Review's claims were
based on two documents that date from the 19605,
when MEChA was established. He says that
MEChA no longer subscribes to all the views put
forth in the documents.
The Review said those two documents, El Plan
de Aztlan and El Plan Espiritual of Santa Barbara,
have racist and separatist messages. By extension,
he said, MEChA is also guilty.
"Our point is to emphasize that here's an orga
nization that still, under its historical foundations,
has racist literature that they may have disavowed
but haven't renounced," said junior Stephen
Cohen, public relations manager of The Review.
"Even if there is only a weak connection, The Re
view still feels that connection is worth investigat
ing and looking it."
MEChA said that El Plan de Aztlan is not sup
ported by any MEChA group, and that the nation-
al organization stated in a press re
lease that the document only has his
torical value.
"It's important to know where
the movement came from," Cende
jas said. "It's very clearly a product
of the radicalized 605."
MEChA says the article is not, in
fact, a founding document. But ju
nior Gary Raichart, editor-in-chief
of The Stanford Review, contested
that claim.
"It was a founding document, and
it was one of their initial docu
ments," Raichart said.
MEChA does not renounce the
second document, El Plan Espiritual
of Santa Barbara, which it said had a
positive message about education
and cultural awareness.
"If they haven't renounced El
Plan Espiritual of Santa Barbara,
they haven't renounced the racism
inherent in the organization," said
junior Gary Raichart, editor in chief
of The Stanford Review.
But Cendejas said he feels that
the document was misinterpreted.
"They had a very negative inter
pretation of the message," he said.
"It has a lot of very solid suggestions
and ideas about empowering youth
with education."
Cendejas did, however, acknowl
edge the document's controversial
language.
Education and Economics Prof.
Martin Carnoy said The Review
should issue a formal apology to
MEChA.
"I don't think MeCHA is claim
ing that they find other people infe
rior," he said. They are just saying,
'we want to stick together as a group,
build up our culture and keep our
culture going.' It's clearly not a
threat to the dominant culture to
have a culture with very little eco
nomic or social power want to stick
together."
Carnoy dismissed the editorial's
claim that MEChA is racist because
of its opposition to the white power
structure.
"Union organizations also have
antipathy to the white power struc
ture," he pointed out. "The white
power structure has power, so peo
ple don't like it. It's one of many or
ganizations that have antipathy for
the white power structure. What's
wrong with that?"
The editorial compares the fact
that MEChA asks its members to re
sist the "dilution of their culture" to

the Ku Klux Klan's belief that non
white cultures are detrimental to
American society.
Carnoy called that claim "the sil
liest thing I've ever heard," pointing
out that his own Jewish mother's
urgings that he marry a Jewish
woman did not make his mother
racist.
"My family preferred not to have
blending of cultures because, in part,
they wanted to keep the culture
going and I think that applies to
probably every immigrant culture,"
he said. "Are Italians racist because
they try to stick together?"
The editorial called for Stanford
MEChA to renounce its affiliation
with the national organization and
denounce the alleged policies of the
national organization.
While the co-chairs of MEChA
said they renounced what The Stan
ford Review stated were MEChA's
national policies, they would not re
nounce MEChA.
"It's part of our history," Cende
jas said. "In the 70s, we were the
group that spearheaded getting
space for the Chicano community,
which resulted in El Centro Chi
cano. From there MEChA has
spanned out to different groups
based on the needs of the communi
ty. This is why we wouldn't want to
repudiate the name of MEChA."
Cendejas emphasized that the
purpose and goal of Stanford
MEChA lies in its work, such as ad
vocating affirmative action and the
rights of campus workers.
According to The Review,
MEChA ranks eighth among stu
dent groups receiving the most spe
cial fees from the ASSU.
MEChA said that the $40,536 it
receives in special fees is distributed
among many groups in El Centro
Chicano.
Sophomore Joseles De la Cruz, a
MEChA spokesperson, expressed
concerns about the effects of the ar
ticle and editorial on the group's
ability to obtain special fees, which
would also harm the groups
MEChA supports.
"We see this as an attack on all
our groups in El Centro," Godinez-
Avina said.
In response, Cohen said, "The
Stanford Review has absolutely no
intention for alienating and offend
ing the Chicano community both at
Stanford and at large."
The Review still stands by every
thing written in the article and edito
rial.
