# There's a lot you can sain from college...like the Fifteen Freshman

"Watch out for the freshman 15!" your
dad yells from the car as it pulls away and you
wave your goodbyes. Thanks dad, you think
as you trudge back to the bare concrete slab in
Otero that you now call home. No friends,
hard classes, high expectations and right
when you could use some comfort food a
heavy side-dish of guilt in the form of the
Ã¼biquitous myth of the freshman 15.
While the term floats through halls of high
schools nationwide, few students can put
their finger on the moment when "Congratu
lations on Stanford" melts into "Watch your
weight!" Even fewer know the origins of this
campus legend. Why 15 pounds? Do you
wake up one day and find you're unable to
squeeze into those low-rider jeans?
Not exactly, says a study published earli
er this year by Cornell University. Accord
ing to research conducted by alumni, fresh
men generally gain 4.2 pounds during the
first 12 weeks of school. While students may
not be adding a small child to their total
weight, these pounds still represent a cultur
al phenomenon.
Students participating in the study gained
a half pound per week on average, 11 times
more than people should gain at this age, and
20 times more than adult Americans pack on
in this length of time.
As far as where the name "freshman 15"
comes from, Vaden dietician Vivian Crisman
attributes it to fancy-pants alliteration, remi
niscing how she was told to beware the
"freshman 10" when she first left for college
in the 80s.
For many students, the myth is nothing
more than an empty if not laughable
threat. Yet for others, the fear of bulging
waistlines has turned dining hall food into
public enemy number one.
Shelves of ramen in the Wilbur Market
place call out to you like the Sirens luring
ships to their doom in Homer's "Odyssey."
Navigating your way through the West Lag
kitchen, you might sense that last piece of
cheesecake staring at you from behind.
"No!" you shout, to the shock of bystanders,
"you'll never take me alive!"
"A lot of weight is probably added be
cause not as much food was offered at home
as in college," Crisman explains. "Our eyes
are often bigger than our stomachs, meaning
if you see it, you eat it."
Sometimes it seems all too easy to sit
down with a tray cluttered with five different
entrees, four of which are probably some sort
of starch. (Generally speaking, rice, pasta,
baked potatoes and dinner rolls don't consti
tute a meal, although they may appear to in
the alternate dimension of Stern and Wilbur
dining.) Crisman says that students should
take an overstuffed feeling as a cue to maybe
skip dessert.
Still, many students say they feel the need
to bulk up during mealtimes because dining
halls are only open for so many hours during
the day. Unless you are the only human being
with the ability to hibernate (lucky duck),
this rationale fails to make the grade.
"This is where snacking comes in handy,"
Crisman says. "Maybe you ate dinner at 7
p.m. and four hours later you're hungry. This
is when it's good to have a small bite for the

energy to keep you going."
According to the Cornell report, dining
hall food only accounts for 20 percent of
freshman weight gain. Crisman calls atten
tion to the role of exercise as well as to the
times at which students eat. This means you,
all you midnight vending machine bandits
(myself included).
"Eating isn't necessarily always driven by
hunger," Crisman says. "A lot of kids snack
when they aren't hungry. Eating becomes a
social affair. People order out for Dominoes
during study sessions, et cetera."
Additionally, the days of high school
track and little league practice are long gone
by now for a majority of Stanford students
who find it nearly impossible to include ex
ercise into their overbooked (OVer
cooked?) schedules. While reading in the
Bender Room of the Bing Wing may prompt
the need for some shut-eye, it's not exactly
the calorie-burner we all wish it were.
"It's good to have a regular activity with
out being exercise compulsive," advises
Crisman, who endorses Stanford's activity
courses. "Try to find a way to fit it in,

whether it be hiking in the hills or playing ul
timate Frisbee."
Alcohol is an unlikely culprit in all these
proceedings, but Crisman says it is a number
one source of calamitous calories gained by
enthusiastic freshmen out to soak up the
party scene. After all, the beer belly has
practically become an American institution
for a reason.
According to Crisman, the weight that is
gained during the first quarter of freshman
year is in no way indicative of an individual's
permanent weight patterns and in most cases
can be linked solely to their adjustment to
college life. Froshies taking 20 units of
physics piled on top of hoards of clubs and ac
tivities can hardly be blamed for irregular
eating and exercise habits. When it comes
down to a choice between Math 51problem
sets and showering, it seems overly cruel to
put the ix-nay on the eetoes-chay.
"Gained weight doesn't necessarily stick
with students through their senior year,"
Crisman says. "But there is a threat of devel
oping unhealthy habits your freshman year
that can stay with you."

Eighty-five percent of the students who
participated in the Cornell study were fe
male. This is not surprising, as many people
envision women when they think of weight
problems, perhaps to the detriment of their
male peers.
"Both men and women are affected by
weight gain during their freshman years,"
Crisman says. "Both of them face the same
buffet style meals and the same lack of exer
cise. There is hardly any difference, except
that women are usually more concerned
about it."
Campus dieticians work around the clock
counseling and constructing nutrition plans
for students who suffer from eating disorders
and irregularities. As far as Stanford is con
cerned, the Vaden Health Center strives to
provide predominantly young women with a
padded room when it comes to eating disor
ders and body image, hoping to educate them
before any serious problems develop.
"Some students come to Stanford recov
ering from eating disorders, and others de
velop'them after they arrive," Crisman says,
emphasizing that eating disorders are equal
ly prevalent at all ages. "It's not so much
based on the situation, but more on the indi
vidual."
The Bridge, Stanford's peer counseling
center, has made strong efforts to combat
body image and weight issues spurred by
terms such as "freshman 15." The Mirror, a
student organization devoted to educating
students in appearance and diet issues, works
to train students to approach their peers and
friends who may be suffering from anorexia
or bulimia.
"We rarely get calls from people who are
worried about their own eating disorder,"
says senior Caroline Moore-Kochlacs, who
works at the Bridge. "It is scary to approach
a friend about this stuff, and it takes some
emotional support."
Students who call to report their concerns
about a friend are asked to come into the
Bridge and role-play with peer counselors to
calm their fears.
Moore-Kolachs also touched on the low
profile "negative Freshman 15," which refers
to large weight loss at the beginning of stu
dents' first year on campus.
"The negative freshman 15 is common
here because of the high stress environ
ment," she explains. "You're constantly
around perfectionists. You find yourself
wanting to eat that piece of cake and as soon
as you give in you feel like you have to run
Campus Drive or something."
The Bridge is one of several campus orga
nizations sponsoring a talk by dietician and
author Jessica Weiner on Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. in
the Roble Parlor. Weiner's presentation "Do
I look fat in this? Decoding Stanford Body
Culture," will address eating disorders and
self-esteem issues.
In large part, the "freshman 15" has be
come a staple in the college vocabulary, de
spite its questionable validity. Yet whether
you are slim like a string bean or pleasantly
pear-shaped, it's important to know that ev
eryone has looked in the mirror and seen
the same anxieties staring back at them. It's
also important to know that if you think
your cheesecake is staring at you, you prob
ably have more serious things to worry
about.

Many freshmen pack on the pounds during their first months at Stanford. This curiously strange
student exposes his beer belly for the entire campus to see.
