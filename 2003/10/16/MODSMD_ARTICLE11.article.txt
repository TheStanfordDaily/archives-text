# Daily trainer serves up Stanford food pyramid
## 
### SARAH DOUGLAS DAILY TRAINER 
Despite recent student objections to our
despotic Dining Services, there have been no
malnutrition-related deaths reported in the
last three weeks. Starvation among Stanford
students is at a minimum and emaciation is
happily a fashion choice, not a life necessity.
But most students can be seen happily
stuffing their faces at every meal. As fresh
men discover the joys of mass-produced
food, returning students settle into a famil
iar, alternative definition of "nutrition."
Basic to our routine is our own version of
the FDA's Food Pyramid, adapted to suit
the lifestyle of intellectually voracious
Stanford students.
Forming the all-important base of the
pyramid is 6-11 servings a day of the Pizza
group. Containing highly-processed carbo
hydrates, cheese oozing with saturated fat

and a bit of tomato paste if you're lucky,
this "super-meal" is an excellent choice at
any time of day. Preferred hot in the
evening and cold in the morning, foods in
the Pizza group do your metabolism the
most good after 1 a.m.
Just above the Pizza group is the High-
Caloric Beverages group, with 3-5 servings
per day. Poweraide, soda, coffee and alco
hol stave off student thirst while getting
pesky calorie consumption out of the way.
Hydration is important, so drink up.
Next comes the Cup-o-Noodles group
at 2-3 daily servings. The Dining Services
sadly neglects this food group in an attempt
to push their own home-cooked imitations.
But nothing can stand in for the high-sodi
um, high-fat noodles that come conve
niently in a styrofoam cup.
Just above the Cup-o-Noodles group
come the equally important Dessert and
Breakfast groups. A donut, piece of cake or

FroYo at every meal satisfies the 2-3 daily
serving requirement of the Dessert catego
ry. Don't neglect your chocolate intake.
Don't neglect your waffle intake, either.
The cafeteria does an excellent job of
catering to our waffle and pancake nutri
tional needs, so take advantage of a chance
to begin a healthy day and give yourself
that second serving of Belgian goodness.
At the apex of our food pyramid is the
rather anti-climactic Use Sparingly catego
ry. Fruits, vegetables, cafeteria mystery
meat, fish products and oatmeal may over
balance your diet, so avoid these foods
whenever possible.
Follow these guidelines and we'll see you
at the end of the year: a few pounds heavier,
but definitely happier. Life is good, so eat up.
