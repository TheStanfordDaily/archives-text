## PHEs should get paid more 
### 
This is the first year in which Peer
Health Educators will be paid for
their work in campus residences.
Carol Pertosky and Kate Bedford
from Vaden Health Promotion Services,
along with the Office of the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs, should be commended for
their efforts in bringing about this change. But
more change is needed for Peer Health Edu
cators to work to the best of their abilities.
Resident Assistants and Head Peer Ad
vising Coordinators receive more than
$5,000 in yearly compensation for their du
ties as residential staff. In the future, the
salary of Peer Health Educators should in
crease to recognize the importance of the
dorm staff position and to endow the job
with the respect it deserves.
Peer Health Educators deal with a variety
of issues, including medical emergencies,
eating disorders and mental health issues.
They educate students about health re
sources on campus, organize dorm program
ming, distribute over-the-counter medica
tions and administer basic first aid. They
deal with some of the most serious issues in
a residence, and their jobs include a vast

amount of responsibility.
The high compensation for other resi
dence staff enables ful committment to the
dorm community. But the small compensa
tion accorded to Peer Health Educators pre
vents the program from reaching its full po
tential. For many Peer Health Educators, an
additional job is necessary to make ends
meet. This means they have less time and en
ergy to devote to dorm staff responsibilities
and dorm activities in general.
The Peer Health Educator program is a
vital part of the Residential Education sys
tem. It must be recognized as such, and the
first step in this recognition is providing
compensation comparable to other resi
dential staff members. While the recent
move to pay these staff members $7OO a
year is admirable, it is only the first step in
the right direction. In a time of budget cuts,
this may seem like a difficult recommenda
tion. But to ensure the vitality of Residen
tial Education programs and to promote
wellness on campus, we hope that the com
pensation of Peer Health Educators will in
crease over time to reflect the true value
they bring to dorms.
