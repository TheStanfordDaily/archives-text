# Vaden's services need publicity
## 
### 
Stephen Bohler had just started his
freshman year at New York Universi
ty. He had already joined the diving
team and made the decision to major
in romance languages. The 18-year-old native
of Dayton, Ohio showed no signs of depres
sion or emotional problems before he
jumped to his death from one of the top
floors of NYU's Elmer Holmes Bobst Li
brary on Saturday. His suicide came as a
shock, said former Stanford Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, now NYU's vice president
for student affairs.
The devastation of Bohler's suicide was
compounded by the fact that it came one
month after the suicide of John D. Skolnik, a
20-year-old junior from Evanston, 111., who
jumped from the 10th floor of the same library.
While the motivations of these two young
men to take their own lives may never be
known, their untimely deaths force the spot
light on a widespread but little-mentioned
problem of depression at universities across
the nation.
Fortunately, Stanford offers a number of
valuable services to ensure the mental well
being of students who are willing to use
them. Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Services, said
that more students are using mental health
services than in the past. But the University
community can still better inform its mem
bers of the importance of mental well-being
to prevent tragedies such as the recent sui
cides at New York University.
Vaden Health Center offers short-term
counseling services to students who come
to seek help. After 10 free, 50-minute ses

sions with a counselor, students who need
more help are referred elsewhere. Vaden
can only offer short-term services to most
students, according to health workers, be
cause the demand is too high to be able to
offer long-term care to everyone who
comes in. WTiile we recognize the chal
lenges of ensuring the mental well-being of
15,000 undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, we wish it were possible for Vaden to
offer more long-term care and support for
those who need it.
The biggest obstacle that stands in the
way of campus mental well-being is educa
tion. Teaching students about the services
available to them is a difficult task. Students
in need of emotional guidance tend to seek
help more tentatively than a student with a
common cold, so Vaden must go the extra
mile to make its services easily accessible to
every student. Vaden currently advertises its
services to students, but a more comprehen
sive advertising campaign would give those
considering a trip to Vaden an extra push to
seek help.
We hope that the tragedies at New York
University can serve as a warning to Stan
ford: Students need someone to trust when
they run into trouble away from home.
Students on campus laughingly refer to
the "Stanford duck syndrome," in which stu
dents appear calm and collected on the sur
face but are frantically paddling underneath
to keep their heads above water. It is
Vaden's responsibility, now more than ever,
to let all members of the campus community
know there is no reason to let stress and fear
pull them under.
