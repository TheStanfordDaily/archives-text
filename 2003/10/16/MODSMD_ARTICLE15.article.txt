## ORDER IN THE COURT? Word, what's up with da grammar? 
### 
Ah, the faithful compan
ions of the writer con
cerned with the correct
ness of her grammar.
The Oxford English Dictionary. The
Chicago Manual of Style. Strunk and
White. Ballmer and Gates.
Wait, a minute ... Ballmer and
Gates? Yes, Microsoft's dynamic
duo, not content simply to rest on
their laurels as undisputed heavy
weights of the personal computing
software market, have an even more
ambitious target now: the English
language. Apparently, Steve Jobs
wasn't a challenging enough oppo
nent so now they're stepping into
the ring to take on William Safire.
I refer, of course, to the Mi
crosoft Word grammar and spell
checker: that annoying little func
tion responsible for underlining
nearly every sentence I type with
green or red bumps. When I click on
the green underline, it gives me
quasi-helpful suggestions for how I
might improve my mastery of the
English language. "Fragment (con
sider revising)," it says. Meanwhile,
the red underlining continually
shocks me with the revelation that
the word I'm trying to use isn't even

in the English language.
In theory, I could just ignore this
perpetual editor. But I'm a very
weak person, and those multicol

ored underlines
are an unbearable
reminder that the
software disap
proves of me. And
I'm too grade
driven to simply
turn it off: Even
though I hate it, I
need to know
what the software
thinks of me. But

some of its criticisms get extremely
personal: Apparently, my last name
is simply an unfortunate misspelling
of the word "feign." That hurts.
But there are deeper reasons to be
concerned that Microsoft —rather
than Mrs. Dawson, my beloved
ninth-grade English teacher —is
now the final arbiter of grammatical
correctness. Where does Microsoft
get off telling me how to write? If they
want to tell me I need 11 gigabytes of
RAM to run their new operating sys
tem, fine. But they cross the line
when they tell me I can't end a sen
tence with a preposition. If I think

"wrkjhhk" should be a word, I'm
damn well entitled to use it.
Microsoft makes for a poor
guardian of lingual sanctity. I used
to be a member of the software en
gineers' union, and let me tell you:
Among groups above the age of 2,
nobody has a worse command of
the English language. These are the
guys who ran screaming from every
humanities course they thought
about taking. Oh, the e-mails I used
to get: "Whose working in these
issue?" or "Red you're proposal
talk buy phone?" Do we really want
a bunch of techies, for whom Yoda
presents an unreachable standard
of comprehensibility, telling us how
to write?
If you agree with me, write Bill
Gates a grammatically incorrect let
ter urging him to remove this poi
sonous feature from future versions
of Word. Join me in saving our lan
guage from the techie invasion.

In full disclosure interests of, once
worked for Microsoft as an intern Eric
Feigin did. Work for them now, many
of his friends do. Powerful, the Dark
Side is. Reached can he be at eric_fei
