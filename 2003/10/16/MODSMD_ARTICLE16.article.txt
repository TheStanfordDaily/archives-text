# UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN
## It's lights out for this Farm girl 
### SARAH LUSTBADER 
FLORENCE, ITALY Any
day now, the fights will go out, the
water will shut off and I will not be
surprised. I worked in downtown
Manhattan during the apocalyptic
mayhem of the Aug. 14 blackout and
had the good fortune to come to Flo
rence in time for the nationwide
power outage in Italy on Sept. 28. The
first incident hit 50 million people in
various cities in the United States and
Canada, while the second deprived
nearly all of Italy's 57 million resi
dents of power. However, during the
first I watched the world's financial
capital freeze and panic, while I could
have easily slept through the second
and I wouldn't have noticed a thing.
To be fair, Italy had luck on its
side. The power went out at 3:15 a.m.
on Sunday, when most of Italy's fights
were out anyway, and nearly all of it
was restored within eight hours. Pret
ty much everything is closed on Sun
days, so Florence didn't look dramat
ically different. Although some un
fortunate late-night subway riders in
Rome needed rescue, Florentines,
having no metro system, could claim
no such trauma. Those who were still
out walked home in the dark, but the
city is small enough that most were
probably planning to walk home any
way. My host family made sure the
gelato hadn't melted, checked on the

train schedules and watched 15 min
utes of news coverage, but didn't give
the matter too much thought. The
weather was moderate, and few hous
es are air conditioned, so no one was
put out by the blackout. The flow of
traffic was not drastically altered,
since many intersections require cars
to yield to pedestrians instead of
using traffic lights.
New York, during its blackout,
didn't know what to do with itself.
There, the power was cut at 4 p.m. on
Thursday, at which point everyone in
my office looked around helplessly, not
quite knowing what to do in front of
their blank computer screens. Outside,
Wall Street workers poured out of their
offices by the thousand and began long
journeys home up Broadway or across
the Brooklyn Bridge in the 90-degree
heat. The absence of functioning traffic
lights led to unprecedented road rage
and a monstrous game of chicken.
Among the commuters I passed on my
five-mile trek home, some seemed ter
rified, many were angry, while others
had decided to take advantage of the
time off and start happy hour a bit early.
For better or for worse, it was an ex
traordinary event.
It was not only luck that gave the
Florentines an easier blackout than
the New Yorkers. Surely one factor is
a lesser reliance on technology and
electricity in Italy. But more than a re
duced inconvenience, the Florentines

displayed a greater tolerance for such
inconveniences. They have grown
used to delays. In my time here, I've
seen train stnkes, bus strikes and tick
et seller strikes. When getting my visa
to study here, the Italian consulate
kept me waiting for six hours, after
which they told me to return the fol
lowing week. Getting a book at the li
brary and mailing a letter will take you
much longer here, and no one seems
to mind. If there is a bus strike, they
shrug and leave some extra time to
make their dates for dinner. Ironical
ly, it was the Italian system that man
aged to restore power in 8 hours,
while residents of Dayton, Ohio, wait
ed for 36. The Italians returned to
work the following day, unscathed,
while New Yorkers competed for
blackout bragging rights the week
after their outage. In many other
ways, these cities are quite similar.
But, when the October blackout
comes and I have no doubt it will
I am grateful I'll still be here in Flo
rence. Maybe I won't notice it at all
this time.
