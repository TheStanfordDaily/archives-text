Students should reach out
to homeless
Columnist Jody Kloczkowski
brings up very good questions in her
article, "Homeless people on cam
pus need our help" (Oct. 14). As the
current president of Night Out
reach, I want members of the Stan
ford community to know how to
help someone in need when the
time comes.
Any person in need of housing,
food or clothing assistance can be di
rected to the Drop-In center located
on the edge of campus on El Camino
near the downtown Palo Alto
bus/train station. Open from 8:30
a.m. to 11 a.m. every weekday, the
Drop-In Center provides basic ser
vices including informed case man
agers that can direct people to the
appropriate housing, food and med
ical care programs in the area. Dur
ing other times one can find infor
mation about emergency assistance,
shelters, medical care, food and drug
and alcohol programs and referrals
on Night Outreach's Web site
(www.stanford.edu/group/nightoutr
each). The programs listed are spon
sored by various organizations and
are located throughout the area
from San Mateo to San Jose.
Like Kloczkowski, I also don't
believe the problems of poverty and
homelessness can escape us on our
campus. But I must clarify that Night
Outreach was formed specifically to
address issues of poverty and home
lessness locally and help bridge the
divide between our insulated stu
dent lives and the real people facing
these problems every day. A few of

these people I have seen on Out
reach walks on campus. The only
thing that distinguishes those on
campus and those "outside" are the
mere boundaries of the place they
take refuge in. I therefore strongly
urge students to get involved with
Night Outreach or another organi
zation that encourages its members
to see and know these people as
human beings and understand what
they are facing. Hopefully, the orga
nization will strive to understand the
roots of poverty and homelessness
everywhere and to raise awareness
about the harsh reality they face,
and finally brainstorm ways to
change the causes.
Sometimes it is thought that
poverty and homelessness is a fact of
life, a structural result of our overall
very successful society. But for those
few who cannot tell a person in need
that "that's how things are" and who
KNOWS the status quo is not good
enough, I invite you to get educated
and get involved. Helping those on
campus, helping those in Palo Alto
or San Francisco they are all the
same community in need.

Students must take responsibility
for drinking
While the administration's
threats to eliminate Full Moon on
the Quad due to a few mishaps at
this year's event are completely un
called for, students' attribution of
those unfortunate happenings to the

new alcohol policy are misguided
and ludicrous.
While I admire the loyalty some
have in defending their peers, some
times it is ok to admit when people in
your posse screw up. So a few stu
dents overestimated their tolerance
and got a little over-liquored for the
occasion. It happens. Ta-da.
The legal drinking age in the
United States is 21. Contrary to pop
ular belief, the University is not
being unreasonable or oppressive by
"enforcing" this. Newsflash: It is not
your God-given right to get drunk.
The Beastie Boys say you gotta
fight, for your right, to paaaar-tay, so
fight if you must but at least find a
better premise upon which to base
your argument than that it "forces"
people to drink in private. Nobody is
being forced to drink anything here.
By no means should the adminis
tration cater to this infantile mental
ity. As a reputable institution of
learning, it is their duty and obliga
tion to aim for something a little,
higher than the lowest common de
nominator. Just because folks are
going to drink doesn't mean that the
University ought to support or en
able them. Congrats to Stanford for
having come up with something re
sembling an actual policy to replace
the alcohol non-policy of yesteryear.
There will always be instances of
error in judgment, "miscalculations"
but no amount of quibbling over
policy can save people from them
selves.
