## Scott's got the jones for some Homecoming 
### 
I have a confession to make. While lying in
bed last weekend, I had a very disturbing
thought. You might want to sit down for
this one.
OK, ready?
I thought — oh, this is difficult to say —
about how much I wish I were back in high
school.
I know it's absurd! I understand it's analo
gous to the Cubs suddenly wishing they were
back in the Division Series, or a sophomore
spontaneously deciding that he misses writing
PWR research proposals.
What's the explanation for such a wretched
thought?
Did my 93rd sighting of Wilbur Dining's
sweet and sour chicken evoke fond memories
of lunch after lunch in the high school cafete
ria? Possibly.
Was watching the football team's miserable
performance Saturday night

enough to make me long for
those brisk Friday evenings
in high school when I'd stand
with my friends in the
bleachers and make fun of
our own cheerleaders in be
tween plays? Perhaps.
I mean, seriously. As if
two bye weeks this season
weren't enough, the Cardi
nal decided to take a third

week off against the Trojans. Did anyone
happen to see the Los Angeles Police De
partment blotter Sunday morning? Multiple
suspects donned in cardinal and white were
wanted for indecent national television expo
sure and false impersonation of the Stanford
football team.
But what really made me nostalgic for the
days of crowded halls and block scheduling
was the realization that, while this Saturday's
game against No. 6 Washington State should
take on added significance, it likely won't.
Saturday is Homecoming and that's proba
bly news to many.
Home-freakin'-coming! In high school, it
was the most hyped and drama-filled event of
the fall. More often than not, it was equally un
fulfilling in the end, but that's beside the point
because it was fun nonetheless. The Home
coming game and the week leading up to it
were reasons to get excited about your school's
football team regardless of its record. It was a
rallying force in the name of school spirit.
But for most students at Stanford, it's just
another football game.
Sure, it's great to see alumni tailgating out
side of what hours later will be an unusually
crowded Stanford Stadium. It's fun collaborat
ing with the old folks on cheers of "Go! Stan
ford! Go! Stanford! Go! (wait, it's com
ing... oh no it's not.)"
The addition of student tailgating tents and
a postgame a cappella concert this year is a
great step in the right direction, but the excite
ment that went along with Homecoming in
high school is still lacking.
Perplexed, I called my sister Jenna, a senior
in high school who knows quite a bit about
planning the perfect Homecoming. As a mem
ber of the student government's executive
board, she's putting die finishing touches on
her own Homecoming, which coincidentally
falls on the same day as ours.
The first and most important step for creat
ing a memorable Homecoming experience, ac
cording to my sister, is deciding on a theme. Ev
erything else revolves around the theme, from
the floats and your evening attire to the Earth
and the moon.
Through a painstaking and time-consum
ing process, I narrowed down the list of Stan
ford's potential themes to one. While "Sugar
Bowl Fever" and "Stanford Football Through
the (21st) Century" were worthy candidates,
this year's theme is (drumroll please)
"MuFu'N'GuUnSun" or Music and Fun 'N'
Gun Under the Sun.
The theme lends itself beautifully to a solar
powered float-filled parade down Palm Drive
led by the don't-call-them-a-high-school-band
Band.
I'm picturing a float commemorating last
year's thrilling 16-6 Homecoming victory over
Arizona. An instant classic if I ever saw one.
And who can forget Stanford's epic 63-26 win
against San Jose State in last year's home open
er? A giant visor float is a must and a cake float
a la the final, chaotic scene in "Animal House"
would be fitting.
I'm currently taking nominations for the
2003 Homecoming King and Queen, both of
whom will see playing time against the
Cougars. For what it's worth, my nominations
for Homecoming Court are the Tree, who
should be able to keep the Cougar offense in
check if his lockdown coverage ability is any
where near as good as his reported hp-locking
ability, and Destiny, former Washington State
and Alabama coach Mike Price's one-night
stand career-wrecker.
As for the actual football game, I think my
sister sums it up best.
"It's really just important that you play a
team you know you can beat."
Oops. Now that I think about it, an upset
win Saturday would more than make up for the
things I miss about high school Homecoming.
Go Cardinal!

Saturday is Homecoming and that's proba
bly news to many.
Home-freakin'-coming! In high school, it
was the most hyped and drama-filled event of
the fall. More often than not, it was equally un
fulfilling in the end, but that's beside the point
because it was fun nonetheless. The Home
coming game and the week leading up to it
were reasons to get excited about your school's
football team regardless of its record. It was a
rallying force in the name of school spirit.
But for most students at Stanford, it's just
another football game.
Sure, it's great to see alumni tailgating out
side of what hours later will be an unusually
crowded Stanford Stadium. It's fun collaborat
ing with the old folks on cheers of "Go! Stan
ford! Go! Stanford! Go! (wait, it's com
ing... oh no it's not.)"
The addition of student tailgating tents and
a postgame a cappella concert this year is a
great step in the right direction, but the excite
ment that went along with Homecoming in
high school is still lacking.
Perplexed, I called my sister Jenna, a senior
in high school who knows quite a bit about
planning the perfect Homecoming. As a mem
ber of the student government's executive
board, she's putting die finishing touches on
her own Homecoming, which coincidentally
falls on the same day as ours.
The first and most important step for creat
ing a memorable Homecoming experience, ac
cording to my sister, is deciding on a theme. Ev
erything else revolves around the theme, from
the floats and your evening attire to the Earth
and the moon.
Through a painstaking and time-consum
ing process, I narrowed down the list of Stan
ford's potential themes to one. While "Sugar
Bowl Fever" and "Stanford Football Through
the (21st) Century" were worthy candidates,
this year's theme is (drumroll please)
"MuFu'N'GuUnSun" or Music and Fun 'N'
Gun Under the Sun.
The theme lends itself beautifully to a solar
powered float-filled parade down Palm Drive
led by the don't-call-them-a-high-school-band
Band.
I'm picturing a float commemorating last
year's thrilling 16-6 Homecoming victory over
Arizona. An instant classic if I ever saw one.
And who can forget Stanford's epic 63-26 win
against San Jose State in last year's home open
er? A giant visor float is a must and a cake float
a la the final, chaotic scene in "Animal House"
would be fitting.
I'm currently taking nominations for the
2003 Homecoming King and Queen, both of
whom will see playing time against the
Cougars. For what it's worth, my nominations
for Homecoming Court are the Tree, who
should be able to keep the Cougar offense in
check if his lockdown coverage ability is any
where near as good as his reported hp-locking
ability, and Destiny, former Washington State
and Alabama coach Mike Price's one-night
stand career-wrecker.
As for the actual football game, I think my
sister sums it up best.
"It's really just important that you play a
team you know you can beat."
Oops. Now that I think about it, an upset
win Saturday would more than make up for the
things I miss about high school Homecoming.
Go Cardinal!
