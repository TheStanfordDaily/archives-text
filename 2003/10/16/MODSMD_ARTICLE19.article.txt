# Card set to face Bruins
## 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
took a wrong turn last Saturday in Berkeley
and slipped out of the lead in the Pacific-10
Conference. Returning to the top of the
conference won't be an easy task either, as
this weekend the Cardinal faces two of the
highest ranked teams in the conference at
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (13-3, 6-1 Pac-10) entered its
match against the Golden Bears ranked
fourth in the nation and undefeated in the
Pac-10. But a narrow loss to California has
moved the Cardinal to No. 7 in the nation
and second place in the conference.
In its two home matches tonight and to
morrow night, the Cardinal faces its rivals
from the South. Stanford will battle No. 11

UCLA (13-3, 5-2 Pac-10) tonight and has a
much-anticipated showdown tomorrow
against top-ranked and defending NCAA
champion USC (16-0,7-0 Pac-10).
But Stanford must first get through the
Bruins before even worrying about the
hard-hitting Trojans.
"UCLA is definitely a great team and it
has proven itself in the country this year," said
junior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani. "[The
Bruins] are a fighting team. We have to make
sure that we come out sharp and physical be
cause they are very resilient and tough."
Moreover, the team is looking to bounce
back from its disappointing defeat at the
hands of California. UCLA, on the other
hand, enters Maples on a high note after de
feating Arizona State in its last contest. Ac
cording to the Cardinal, this situation may
not be so bad.

"The loss to Cal actually helped our
mentality," Nnamani added. "We always
need to play with a killer instinct and that
definitely has re-emerged. Losing matches
like that is a big part of volleyball and we're
just now getting to the point in the season
when the best volleyball is being played
we're mentally ready for it."
UCLA is one of the few teams in the
conference that leads the Cardinal in
head-to-head competition, winning 34 of
61 all-time matches. But, the Bruins have
not managed to take a match from Stan
ford since 2000. Last year, the Cardinal
swept UCLA, beating the Bruins 3-1 on
Oct. 5 on the Farm and 3-0 in Los Angeles
on Nov. 1.
The Bruins are led by junior middle block
er Brynn Murphy, who comes in with 3.86
kills per game and 216 kills on the season, and

outside hitter Heather Cullen, who averages
3.17 kills per game. Murphy was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week two weeks ago after
the Bruins played against the Washington
schools, in which she posted a career-high 43
kills. Last year, Cullen led the Bruins with 30
aces and this year is second on the team with
171 kills and 3.17 hits per game.
However, Stanford will not be intimi
dated, especially with senior middle block
er Jennifer Harvey waiting on the other
side of the net. Harvey leads the Pac-10 in
blocking, carrying a 1.66 blocks per game
average and an impressive 22 solo blocks
this season.
Offensively, the Cardinal will be looking
to Nnamani and freshman Kristin Richards
to pace its attack.
Tonight's game will begin at 7 p.m. and
will be broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.
