# Alumni return for Homecoming
## 7,500 Stanford graduates expected for the weekend 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From "Classes without Quizzes" to a
panel discussion with U.S. Supreme
Court Associate Justice Anthony
Kennedy, Stanford graduates will get a
chance this weekend to experience the
perks of Stanford without the home
work.
Stanford's Reunion Homecoming,
which begins today, will bring to the Farm
graduates of all ages from the Class of
2003 to those who have been out of col
lege for decades. Organizers expect the
event to draw 7,500 Stanford graduates,
making Stanford's alumni program one of
the largest in the country, and second only
to Princeton's program.
With the spread of attendance calling
campaigns, in which classes attempt to call
each classmate and beat previous records
of attendance, Reunion Homecoming has
more than tripled in size over the last 10
years.
"If you figure you'll see half of your
classmates, it's hard to miss," said Leslie
Winick, director of Reunion Homecom
ing.
A highlight of this year's Reunion
Homecoming is a Saturday morning panel
discussion in Memorial Auditorium enti
tled "We the People 2003," which will fea
ture Kennedy, Kathleen Sullivan and fel
low constitutional scholars Pamela S. Kar
lan, Lawrence Lessig and Jack Rakove.
The weekend will also feature class
panels, with the classmates from specific
years speaking about life after Stanford, as
well as class reunion parties and class tail
gates between 300 and 1,000 people, who
will gather from 11 a.m. until game time.
"I'm particularly excited about my
15th reunion because we've broken the
record for attendance at a 15th which

isn't even one of the major reunions like
the 10th or 20th," said David Smolen,
who graduated in 1988 and is the events
coordinator for Reunion Homecoming.
"I'm really excited about the enthusiasm
my class has shown."
This year, about 30 student coordinators
have started leading teams that are assigned
to specific tasks, ranging from registration
to project organization. In addition to these

paid workers, there are a number of student
groups and individual volunteers.
"It's really the main way of keeping
alumni connected to the school and their
class," said sophomore Colleen Ferrand-
Andrew, the class of 1973 team leader for
Reunion Homecoming. "It makes a huge
difference in how people feel like they're a
part of Stanford even if they don't go here
anymore."

As much as the weekend is an opportu
nity to catch up with old classmates, the
alumni also enjoy conversing with current
students and trading Stanford stories.
"Every year, alumni say they want even
more student interaction, so we encourage
students to come out and talk to the grad
uates," Winick said. "This is a huge event
with a great opportunity for individual re
flections."
