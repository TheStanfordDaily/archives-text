# Wilson back from Tehran
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Last season, Stanford senior Mike
Wilson started every game, scored a
total of five goals and came up big for
his team in key moments during
NCAA tournament play.
But the two games that changed it
all for Wilson came last December,
when he stepped onto the field in the
Cardinal's Final Four charge.
When the matches were over and
Stanford was the national runner-up,
Wilson gathered up the game tapes and
sent them home to New Zealand for
the eyes of the country's national team.
These recordings of Wilson in action,
coupled with some games he played
upon returning home that winter, clearly
caught the attention of the coaching staff.
Wilson was named to the New Zealand
national team this past spring and saw his
first game action last weekend.
Wilson and the 'All Whites' the
name references New Zealand's rugby
team, the All-Blacks joined forces
on Oct. 12 for a game in Tehran, Iran.
Now that the energetic Stanford co
captain is back on Cardinal turf, he has
been able to reflect on the experience.
"It's so different [from college
play]." Wilson said, "The biggest thing
is that we don't all come together very
often. We don't have as much time to
prepare."
In fact, the Kiwi team flew out to

Tehran five days early in order to get
practice time before the matchup.
Wilson came off of the bench in the
second half to play for the All Whites at
his usual midfield position.
"It would have been great if we'd
won," said Wilson of the squad's 3-0
loss to Iran. "But Iran is a good team.
They won the Asian Federation cham
pionship last year. It was a great expe
rience for me."
Part of the reason that Wilson has
had such a positive experience under
the pressure of international competi
tion is the fact that three of his team
mates can relate to him so well
they're all Stanford soccer alumni.

rently plays in Finland in addition to
the New Zealand team. Simon Elliot
('9B) is a member of Major League
Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, and
Ryan Nelsen ('01) anchors the defense
of the DC United.
"In terms of role models, [Davis, El
hot and Nelsen] are great," Wilson said
of his teammates. "The way they go
about their work puts down a good
blueprint for me to follow."
Of the three, only Nelsen played at
the Farm with Wilson. Wilson was a
freshman in Nelsen's last year.
"The game [against Iran] was a
chance for the team to have a look at

our young players," Nelsen ex
plained, "And Mike did extremely
well. During training he was really
just first-class."
And if anyone should know, it's
Nelson. Since being drafted fourth
overall in 2001, he has become the
United's team captain. He has
ranked as high as second in team
scoring, while also being named to
the 16-member 2003 MLS All-Star
team. Nelson has played with the
All-Whites since 1998 and last year
scored the tournament-winning goal
at the Kiwi's Oceania Cup against
rival Australia.
"[Playing for a national team] is
tough," Nelsen said. "College level
play is a big step down from interna
tional or even professional."
Nelsen said that even the best
college players end up not making
it in the pros, so the fact that
Nelsen has beaten the odds and
Wilson is off to a good start in in
ternational play speaks highly of
both of their abilities.
Good thing, since the stress of
playing outside of the United States
can be a little taxing, according to
Nelsen.
"Americans just don't under
stand how soccer is in other coun
tries," he said. "I've been to Yan
kees games and NFL games and
those are nothing. [ln Iran] we
played in front of 60,000 people, and
they don't make you feel welcome.
"If we had won, I don't think
we'd have survived," Nelsen
quipped.
Both Nelsen and Wilson have
some time off from the All-Whites
for a while.
Nelsen is now fighting alongside
his United teammates for an MLS
playoff berth after a three-year
drought, while Wilson, who re
turned home from Tehran yester
day, is already back at the Cardinal's
practice despite the rigors of exten
sive travel.
Maybe he's been listening to the
words of Nelsen, who said, "The
players that make it are the ones
who take every opportunity."
Or maybe, as his coaching staff
would tell you, "That's just Mike."

"In terms of role models, [Davis, El
hot and Nelsen] are great," Wilson said
of his teammates. "The way they go
about their work puts down a good
blueprint for me to follow."
Of the three, only Nelsen played at
the Farm with Wilson. Wilson was a
freshman in Nelsen's last year.

Junior Mike Wilson returns to Moloney Field after playing with the New Zealand National Team. His
first game-action with the National Team occurred last Sunday in a 3-0 New Zealand loss to Iran.
our young players," Nelsen ex
plained, "And Mike did extremely
well. During training he was really
just first-class."
And if anyone should know, it's
Nelson. Since being drafted fourth
overall in 2001, he has become the
United's team captain. He has
ranked as high as second in team
scoring, while also being named to
the 16-member 2003 MLS All-Star
team. Nelson has played with the
All-Whites since 1998 and last year
scored the tournament-winning goal
at the Kiwi's Oceania Cup against
rival Australia.
"[Playing for a national team] is
tough," Nelsen said. "College level
play is a big step down from interna
tional or even professional."
Nelsen said that even the best
college players end up not making
it in the pros, so the fact that
Nelsen has beaten the odds and
Wilson is off to a good start in in
ternational play speaks highly of
both of their abilities.
Good thing, since the stress of
playing outside of the United States
can be a little taxing, according to
Nelsen.
"Americans just don't under
stand how soccer is in other coun
tries," he said. "I've been to Yan
kees games and NFL games and
those are nothing. [ln Iran] we
played in front of 60,000 people, and
they don't make you feel welcome.
"If we had won, I don't think
we'd have survived," Nelsen
quipped.
Both Nelsen and Wilson have
some time off from the All-Whites
for a while.
Nelsen is now fighting alongside
his United teammates for an MLS
playoff berth after a three-year
drought, while Wilson, who re
turned home from Tehran yester
day, is already back at the Cardinal's
practice despite the rigors of exten
sive travel.
Maybe he's been listening to the
words of Nelsen, who said, "The
players that make it are the ones
who take every opportunity."
Or maybe, as his coaching staff
would tell you, "That's just Mike."
