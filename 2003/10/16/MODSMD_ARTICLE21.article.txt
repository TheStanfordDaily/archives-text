# Women's soccer: What happens to a dream deferred?
## 
### 
The movie "Bend it Like Beckham,"
has a fairy-tale ending. Jess, an Indi
an girl living in London, earns a soc
cer scholarship to Santa Gara Uni
versity and realizes her dream of playing com
petitive soccer in America. Jess's traditional
Indian parents once highly skeptical of
women playing sports and "showing their legs
to the whole world" come to be proud of
their daughter's talent.
The movie is neither original nor nuanced,
but it has the ring of truth. In life, as in the movie,
sports do have an overwhelmingly positive im
pact on the lives of young female athletes.
Athletic competition places young women
in an arena that encourages teamwork, skill
and practice, and legitimizes their passion for
sports. The positive psychological effects on
women who play sports are well documented.
Studies show that teenage girls who partic
ipate in athletics are less likely to become preg
nant, more likely to graduate from high school
and show higher self-esteem than those who
do not participate.
For Jess, playing soccer unleashes a new
spirit and a love of life that remained hidden

under the accepted defini
tions of femininity imposed
by her culture. Before join
ing the soccer team, she suf
focated under the well-in
tentioned traditionalism of
her family. At home, cook
ing and marriage are the
main topics of conversa
tion. Only on the soccer
field does Jess's passion and
intensity gain recognition.

There, she is no longer self-conscious about a
scar on her leg because physical attractiveness
is irrelevant to success.
Both Jess and her friend Jules ultimately
dream of playing professional soccer in the
Women's United Soccer Association, the only
women's professional soccer league in the
world. They watch WUSA footage together
and Jules declares, "Wow. We don't have any
thing like that over here."
Unfortunately, the only women's profes
sional soccer league in the real world did not
end like a fairy-tale. On Sept. 15, just days be
fore the Women's World Cup, the WUSA an

nounced it was suspending operations, citing a
lack of corporate sponsorship. In three sea
sons, the WUSA lost $lOO million and failed
to generate its projected TV ratings and atten
dance figures. The WUSA's average atten
dance slid from around 8,000 fans per game in
its inaugural season to just 6,700 a game last
season. Projected television ratings of 2.0
never materialized; the 2003 season earned
ratings of just 0.1 on the PAX network.
Part of the WUSA's failure can be at
tributed to a slowing economy and poor mar
keting. Marketing experts believe that the
WUSA overemphasized young girls and then
families, while failing to capture a fan base of
adults and men. Seventy percent of spectators
at WUSA games were female and 89 percent
of attendees were under the age of 18. Like
any new professional sports league in a con
gested market, the WUSA faced an uphill
struggle. It takes a critical mass of viewers to
elicit television sponsorship, and yet television
sponsorship is often critical to creating a fan
base. Some women's college basketball teams
have managed to earn profits and robust at
tendance figures most notably the Univer

sity of Connecticut and Tennessee but, in
the beginning that was not true, even for these
highly successful programs.
There is no doubt that women are capable
of putting on a show that fills stadiums, as evi
denced by last year's average of 1,226,000
households that watched the match-up be
tween Duke and Connecticut on ESPN2. The
telecast was ESPN2's third most-watched col
lege basketball game ever, including postsea
son and men's action. Women's NCAA bas
ketball attendance has grown for 18 straight
years and don't forget that 90,185 fans packed
the Rose Bowl to see the U.S. women's team
defeat China for the 1999 World Cup.
Public euphoria from that victory helped
spawn the WUSA. The real question is
whether a consistent fan base can be sustained
over a long season.
Beyond marketing and management
problems, the poor attendance numbers and
television ratings of both the WUSA and the
WNBA raise questions about the potential
profitability of women's professional sports
leagues.
Ultimately, corporate sponsors will not

write a check to save a dream just because it
may be "the right thing to do." Nike paid $9O
million to high-school phenom Lebron James,
but was unwilling to even outfit WUSA teams.
The market, unfortunately, simply does
not respond to the intangibles that are created
by the existence of professional women's
sports leagues.
"The positive impact our sport has had on
youth players, both boys and girls, and their
perception of women as athletes, has been in
spiring to experience first hand," said Julie
Foudy, one of the WUSA's founding players
and a Stanford graduate. "It is empowering
for kids to have role models like the players of
the WUSA."
The truth is Jess and Jules's soccer dreams
are a little less bright now without a profes
sional league to aspire to.
One fan said it best in a sign at the United
States-Sweden World Cup game: "Price of
Saving the WUSA: Millions. Saving my
daughter's dream: Priceless."

The movie "Bend it Like Beckham,"
has a fairy-tale ending. Jess, an Indi
an girl living in London, earns a soc
cer scholarship to Santa Gara Uni
versity and realizes her dream of playing com
petitive soccer in America. Jess's traditional
Indian parents once highly skeptical of
women playing sports and "showing their legs
to the whole world" come to be proud of
their daughter's talent.
The movie is neither original nor nuanced,
but it has the ring of truth. In life, as in the movie,
sports do have an overwhelmingly positive im
pact on the lives of young female athletes.
Athletic competition places young women
in an arena that encourages teamwork, skill
and practice, and legitimizes their passion for
sports. The positive psychological effects on
women who play sports are well documented.
Studies show that teenage girls who partic
ipate in athletics are less likely to become preg
nant, more likely to graduate from high school
and show higher self-esteem than those who
do not participate.
For Jess, playing soccer unleashes a new
spirit and a love of life that remained hidden

under the accepted defini
tions of femininity imposed
by her culture. Before join
ing the soccer team, she suf
focated under the well-in
tentioned traditionalism of
her family. At home, cook
ing and marriage are the
main topics of conversa
tion. Only on the soccer
field does Jess's passion and
intensity gain recognition.

There, she is no longer self-conscious about a
scar on her leg because physical attractiveness
is irrelevant to success.
Both Jess and her friend Jules ultimately
dream of playing professional soccer in the
Women's United Soccer Association, the only
women's professional soccer league in the
world. They watch WUSA footage together
and Jules declares, "Wow. We don't have any
thing like that over here."
Unfortunately, the only women's profes
sional soccer league in the real world did not
end like a fairy-tale. On Sept. 15, just days be
fore the Women's World Cup, the WUSA an

nounced it was suspending operations, citing a
lack of corporate sponsorship. In three sea
sons, the WUSA lost $lOO million and failed
to generate its projected TV ratings and atten
dance figures. The WUSA's average atten
dance slid from around 8,000 fans per game in
its inaugural season to just 6,700 a game last
season. Projected television ratings of 2.0
never materialized; the 2003 season earned
ratings of just 0.1 on the PAX network.
Part of the WUSA's failure can be at
tributed to a slowing economy and poor mar
keting. Marketing experts believe that the
WUSA overemphasized young girls and then
families, while failing to capture a fan base of
adults and men. Seventy percent of spectators
at WUSA games were female and 89 percent
of attendees were under the age of 18. Like
any new professional sports league in a con
gested market, the WUSA faced an uphill
struggle. It takes a critical mass of viewers to
elicit television sponsorship, and yet television
sponsorship is often critical to creating a fan
base. Some women's college basketball teams
have managed to earn profits and robust at
tendance figures most notably the Univer

sity of Connecticut and Tennessee but, in
the beginning that was not true, even for these
highly successful programs.
There is no doubt that women are capable
of putting on a show that fills stadiums, as evi
denced by last year's average of 1,226,000
households that watched the match-up be
tween Duke and Connecticut on ESPN2. The
telecast was ESPN2's third most-watched col
lege basketball game ever, including postsea
son and men's action. Women's NCAA bas
ketball attendance has grown for 18 straight
years and don't forget that 90,185 fans packed
the Rose Bowl to see the U.S. women's team
defeat China for the 1999 World Cup.
Public euphoria from that victory helped
spawn the WUSA. The real question is
whether a consistent fan base can be sustained
over a long season.
Beyond marketing and management
problems, the poor attendance numbers and
television ratings of both the WUSA and the
WNBA raise questions about the potential
profitability of women's professional sports
leagues.
Ultimately, corporate sponsors will not

write a check to save a dream just because it
may be "the right thing to do." Nike paid $9O
million to high-school phenom Lebron James,
but was unwilling to even outfit WUSA teams.
The market, unfortunately, simply does
not respond to the intangibles that are created
by the existence of professional women's
sports leagues.
"The positive impact our sport has had on
youth players, both boys and girls, and their
perception of women as athletes, has been in
spiring to experience first hand," said Julie
Foudy, one of the WUSA's founding players
and a Stanford graduate. "It is empowering
for kids to have role models like the players of
the WUSA."
The truth is Jess and Jules's soccer dreams
are a little less bright now without a profes
sional league to aspire to.
