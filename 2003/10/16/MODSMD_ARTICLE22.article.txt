# SIDELINED AGAIN?

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The 2003 soccer season has been familiar
for senior tri-captain Ally Marquand in many
ways, with this her fifth year on The Farm. But
there has been one very important change for
the second team All-Pacific-10 midfielder.
Marquand has been plagued by injury
throughout her Stanford career and this year
has certainly been no different, but she has
been able to play through pain and become the
Cardinal's leading scorer while doing so.
In her three previous seasons at Stanford,
Marquand had notched a total of just five goals
while taking a primarily defensive role on the
field. This season, she's already found the back
of the net six times.
And she's still got seven regular season
matches to go.
In large part, Marquand's scoring explosion
can be attributed to teammate Marcie Ward's
season-ending foot injury.
"With Marcie out, I think we've all had to
step up in ways that we weren't really planning
on," Marquand said. "I think everyone has re
ally contributed to the offense and filled in
holes left by graduation and injury. I've been
able to score a few goals and it's been really
fun, definitely a change for me."
The Cardinal has struggled to score all sea
son, prompting even more aggressive play out
of Marquand.
"Ally's a senior and a leader on this team,"
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "She's
realized that we're not scoring goals and she
took it upon herself to try and score goals."
Not only is Marquand scoring, but she is
scoring at key moments for Stanford. Her first
goal of the season came against Long Beach
State and proved to make the difference in the
Cardinal victory.
Marquand's most impressive performance
came last weekend against Arizona when she
recorded a hat trick, including the game-win
ning goal in the 65th minute. Her first two goals
were equally important and timely as they both
came almost immediately after Wildcat goals,
halting any Arizona momentum.
"She really came through for us that day,"
Ratcliffe said, "and she was real close to scor
ing two more. It's all the more impressive be
cause she did it from the midfield position."
However, Marquand's trip to the desert
'wasn't all sunshine and roses. On a defensive
play in the Cardinal's loss to Arizona State, she
injured her left knee.
"I was back-pedaling and I planted my left
leg funny and pivoted wrong," she said.

"Something didn't feel right. I tried to shake it
off for the next couple of minutes, but I even
tually had to take myself out."
Things did not look good when Marquand
originally believed to have an MCL tear. How
ever, the ever-resilient midfielder looks to be
back on the field for this weekend's conference
matchups with No. 3 UCLA (9-1-2, 2-0) and
use (5-4-4,1-0-1).
"We're just trying to figure out exactly
what's wrong with it this week," she said.
"We've been treating it as best as we can so
hopefully I can play some this weekend."
Knee injuries are nothing new for Mar
quand. In 2000, she was forced to redshirt due

to a torn ACL and in 2001, she again missed
time with knee problems.
"I've had some really bad luck with my
knees," she said. "But I knew [this time] it
wasn't anything too major because it didn't
give out totally. It didn't collapse."
So far, Marquand has been healthy enough
to start all 13 matches for Stanford. However,
her physical play has forced her to come out of
several contests.
In the Cardinal's win over San Francisco,
she collided with an opposing player while try
ing to make a tackle. In the Cardinal's loss to
Santa Clara, she fell hard on her shoulder after
going up for a header.

Both times she showed her grit and came
back to play the second half.
"I seem to be one of those players that gets
random injuries and beat up a lot," Marquand
said. "It's been that way for four years, so it's
nothing really new on that end."
For the Cardinal to secure a playoff berth, it
will need a strong finish to the conference
schedule. Without a doubt, Marquand's health
and new-found scoring prowess will be critical
over this stretch
"Clearly, Ally is very important to this
team," Ratcliffe said. "Her offensive produc
tion wasn't something I had expected, but we
have needed every bit of it."
