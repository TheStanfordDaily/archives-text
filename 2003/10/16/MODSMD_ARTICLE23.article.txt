## Mich, rep fights gay life class 
### DANA GOLDSTEIN BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) In Lansing, Mich., state Rep.
Jack Hoogendyk, a rookie legislator from
Kalamazoo, has drafted a list of potentially "in
appropriate" courses offered by Michigan's 12
publicly funded colleges and universities.
Hoogendyk, recently named the "most con
servative house member" by the non-partisan
newsletter Inside Michigan Politics, hopes to
amend Michigan's constitution in order to
allow the state legislature to cut funding from
institutions offering classes that two-thirds of
legislators find "inappropriate."
The proposal differs from one drafted in
2000. That budget appropriations bill would
have cut by 10 percent the funding of any state
college or university offering classes promoting
"a sexual lifestyle ... other than heterosexual
monogamy."
Included on Hoogendyk's current hit list are
introductory women's studies courses, film
classes that focus on women directors' portray
al of gender and an assortment of classes ad
dressing homosexuality.
But the catalyst for Hoogendyk's action is a
three-year controversy surrounding the Uni
versity of Michigan's "Literature and Culture"
class in the English department titled "How to
Be Gay: Male Homosexuality and Initiation."
Taught since 2000 by Prof. David Halperin,
the description of the class on the UM Web site
says the class's goal is to "examine the general
topic of the role that initiation plays in the for
mation of gay male identity."
According to the course description, the
subject will be approached in three ways:
through literature, through a reading of studies
in queer "sub-cultural practices" and "as a class
project, since the course itself will constitute an
experiment in the very process of initiation that
it hopes to understand."
This last statement that the course would
act as an experiment in gay initiation was
the lightening rod that attracted conservative
activists and lawmakers to the provocatively ti
tled course.
Halperin said "all sorts of students" sign up
for his course. Calling the class "a project" in
gay initiation meant "simply that a course that
surveys and examines some of the materials
that gay men have used to create an identity ...
will necessarily be a course that itself performs
the work of gay initiation," he said. "Gay initi
ation consists precisely in sharing, circulating

and examining such materials."
But Gary Glenn, director of the American
Family Association of Michigan and one of the
original proponents of legislation that targeted
Halperin's class in 2000, said Halperin was any
thing but a dispassionate intellectual.
"He wrote that the purpose of so-called gay
and lesbian studies was to express political mil
itancy," Glenn said. "I'm not interested in what
Halperin says when the spotlight is on him. I
think it's far more revealing to read what he
wrote when no one was watching."
In addition to his duties as an English pro
fessor, Halperin is the co-director of the Les
bian-Gay-Queer Research Initiative, a project
run out of UM's Institute for Research on
Women and Gender. Last March he gave the
introductory remarks at a UM conference on
"gay shame."
Glenn, who has traveled the United States
as a talk show personality, said, "The people
around the country are laughing at the Univer
sity of Michigan over them having a class so
brazenly entitled, 'How to be Gay.'" Glenn
said the AFA is opposed to the course because
it "is forcing taxpayers to pay to teach young
meri how to be gay."
'Tt legitimizes behavior that literally puts
the lives of young people at risk," Glenn con
tinued, adding that homosexuality was a
lifestyle choice, as opposed to race, which was
unchangeable. "There are no former African
Americans," he said.
Hoogendyk said he is working to draft a leg
islation that will have a high chance of passage
within Michigan's House of Representatives.
To enact a legislative check on college and uni
versity curricula, two-thirds of both the Michi
gan House and Senate would need to support
an amendment to the state constitution. The
amendment would then go on a ballot initiative
that would have to be approved by a simple
majority of Michigan's voters.
Halperin said despite rumblings in Lansing,
"The entire university students, student
newspaper, student government, faculty, my
department, the administration, etc. has
consistently defended my right to teach the
course. No one on campus wants the curricu
lum to be determined by politicians or by peo
ple outside the university."
Even Hoogendyk admits his legislation
probably will not keep UM from offering what
ever courses it chooses. "I think that they will
probably find private funding to offer the
class," he said, "which is fine."
