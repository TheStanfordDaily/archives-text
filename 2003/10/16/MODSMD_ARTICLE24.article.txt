(U-WIRE) COLUMBUS, Ohio—
The man who has been tabbed the
"naked photographer" is lurking near the
Ohio State University campus and in the
school's surrounding areas.
During the past few years, reports have
been filed in the Columbus, Ohio area re
garding a man wearing only shoes and a
hat who approaches women and pho
tographs them. The latest report was filed
last Thursday.
"We have had about 28 cases that we
have accredited to him over the last two
years," said Sherry Mercurio, spokes

woman for the Columbus Division of
Police.
"A majority of those have not in
volved any physical contact whatsoever.
"It is a shock value more than any
thing," she continued. "He takes the pic
ture, whether or not he is actually taking a
photo, or it is just a light that goes off, then
runs."
Police have noticed a trend that has
some in the OSU area uneasy about the
future actions of the photographer. The
suspect started with just taking the pic
tures, but more recent reports have estab
lished him making physical contact with
some of his victims.
"He has progressed over the course of

two years to this point," Mercurio said.
"But it is not a point where he has pro
gressed to attacking. There has been con
tact, but he is not attacking."
While Columbus police do not believe
he is an extreme danger to society, they
are still working hard at getting him off the
streets.
Last Friday, a composite of the "naked
photographer" was released. Police have
no reason to believe there is more than
one culprit.
"There is enough of a sjmilar charac
teristic," Mercurio said. "Tlie actual way
in which he carries out these incidents has
been identical. They are very, very confi
dent it is the same person."
