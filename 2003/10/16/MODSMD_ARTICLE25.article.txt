# Analysts say UC budget might be cut

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES, Calif. Despite California Gov.-
elect Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign promises to preserve edu
cational funding, the University of California system's budget may
be "on the chopping block," some political analysts believe.
Facing an $8 billion deficit for the 2004-05 academic year, many
have said they believe Schwarzenegger's pledged audit of the state
budget will not find enough free revenue to maintain educational
funding without raising taxes or making cuts to other programs, such
as health care or prisons. Schwarzenegger has vowed to not raise
taxes.
"You have to worry about the UC because the way Arnold talks,
he hasn't given himself a lot of wiggle room," said Bruce Cain, direc
tor of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley.
Members of Schwarzenegger's transition team did not respond to
phone calls Monday and Tuesday.
In addition to the $8 billion budget gap, Schwarzenegger will in
herit a $10.7 billion bond deficit that will be paid over the next five or
more years. If he chooses to repeal the car tax, which tripled the an
nual car fee a $l5B expense for the average California resident
the state budget will be off kilter an estimated additional $4 billion.
53 percent of this year's state budget went to education -12.2 per
cent for higher education. Only 5 percent of the state's $72 billion
budget could be redistributed without the legislature's approval, said
Department of Finance spokeswoman Anita Gore.
Though Schwarzenegger has vowed to champion education,
some faculty and political analysts worry he is not as passionate
about higher education as he is about kindergarten through high

school. His most notable prior political experience was leading a
campaign for Proposition 49, which passed in November and grants
as much as $550 million annually for after-school programs.
"The fear is that he will interpret his promise [to preserve fund
ing] through not cutting K-12," said UCLA political science profes
sor Barbara Sinclair.
Unlike K-12 education, which is legally guaranteed a certain
amount of funding based on per capita income, the UC has no legal
formula that dictates its budget, making it more vulnerable.
Last month the state Department of Finance asked all state agen
cies to devise plans for sustaining a 20 percent budget cut, which
would be $6OO million for the UC. UC budget Vice President Larry
Hershman said if the UC faced such a cut and didn't cut universi
ty programs student fees would need to increase $4,000 annually
to offset it.
The UC raised student fees 10 percent in December and another
30 percent over the summer. UCLA undergraduates will pay $5,819
this year.
"At the rate we are going, UCLA and Berkeley will look more
like Stanford [University] and [the University of Southern Califor
nia]," Cain said, referring to the skyrocketing cost of a UC education.
Both Stanford and USC's tuitions exceed $28,500 for 2003-04.
All of Schwarzenegger's actions, whether in line with campaign
promises or not, will be under the eye of public scrutiny, as many peo
ple are expecting the bodybuilder-turned-actor-turned-governor to
fail.
"He is inheriting a very difficult budget situation, and almost any
thing he does risks jeopardizing his credibility," said UCLA political
science professor John Zaller. "Whether the risks are greater for rais
ing taxes or cutting education or having the state bond rating
fa 11... is something for him to decide."
