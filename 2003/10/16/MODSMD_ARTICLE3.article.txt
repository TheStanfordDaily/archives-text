# Law school dean to step down
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Dean of the Law School Kathleen Sulli
van announced yesterday that she will step
down as dean on Sept. 1,2004, although she
will remain at Stanford to direct a new con
stitutional law center.
The decision came as a surprise to some,
including her executive assistant, Diana
Jantzen-Otani.
"I didn't have any idea," said Jantzen-
Otani, who did not discover until late yes
terday afternoon that Sullivan had plans to
end her deanship. "It came out of left field."
Sullivan said she is looking forward to re
turning to the study of constitutional law.
"When I committed to a five-year term
as dean in 1999, I told [former] President

Gerhard Casper that I did not intend to
leave my first love, constitutional law, for
ever," she wrote in a letter to the Law
School community that announced her de
cision. "I have decided that it is now time
for me to return to a life devoted to re
search, teaching and public advocacy in
constitutional law."
University President John Hennessy said
he accepted "with reluctance" Sullivan's de
cision to end her five-year tenure as dean.
"Kathleen Sullivan has been one of the
preeminent deans in U.S. legal education,"
Hennessy said in a press release. "She has
articulated a strong vision for the Law
School and has led the school unerringly to
ward that vision."
During her time as dean, Sullivan over
saw the first major renovation of the Law

School in 25 years, launched new centers for
the study of e-commerce and created a legal
services office in East Palo Alto where law
students assist impoverished clients.
She also recruited seven new professors
to a 42-member faculty and increased the
racial and gender diversity of the faculty and
student body.
"She's been an absolute inspiration to
work for," said Jantzen-Otani, who re
members being asked by Sullivan during
her first week of work to complete a
weighty project.
"She said, 'We're getting re-accredited
with the [American Bar Association], and I
want you to handle the project,"' Jantzen-
Otani recalled. "That's reaffirming, that
somebody who hires you entrusts
you with that job. It's great to work
with someone who gives you that
kind of autonomy and trust."
Sullivan, who holds degrees from
Cornell University, Oxford Univer
sity and Harvard University, is con

sidered one of the country's most in
fluential lawyers and an expert in
constitutional law. She came to Stan
ford from Harvard in 1993 and be
came dean in 1999.
Sullivan was unavailable to
comment on her decision to step
down or the nature of the new con
stitutional law center. Her succes
sor will be named several months
from now by a search committee
appointed by Hennessy.
