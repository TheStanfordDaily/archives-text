# GSC supports student tax relief
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
After voting last night to continue its
advocacy of tax relief for graduate stu
dents, the Graduate Student Council de
cided to send a member to a conference of
the National Association of Graduate and
Professional Students in Washington,
D.C., early next month.
The activities in Washington, D.C., will
focus on lobbying for the sponsorship of an
amendment to the Higher Education Act
that would add room and board to a list of
tax-free "qualified educational expenses,"
according to at-large representative Mori
ah Thomason.
Stipends covering rent and food costs

are awarded when-fellowship and scholar
ship awards exceed the costs of tuition and
fees. According to a statement issued last
December by the council, such stipends
were tax-exempt until 1986, when the IRS
edited its tax code. In contrast, the Higher
Education Act still regards room and
board expenses among necessary "costs of
attendance."
The council hopes that an amendment
for tax relief will bridge the gap between
the act and the tax code.
The amendment will also include provi
sions to exempt undergraduate savings ac
counts from taxes, raise deductibles on stu
dent loan interest payments and make it
easier for students to qualify for stu
dent loans.
Eliminating current tax deduc
tions on stipend checks would be of
particular help to graduate students
in the Palo Alto area, where housing
costs are high. According to Amit
Ganguli, stipends "account for only
90 percent of the total that Stanford
itself acknowledges as 'cost of atten
dance.' "
Ganguli estimated that most
graduate students spend 35 percent
of their stipend checks on rent,
which essentially places them below
the poverty fine.
Exempting stipends from taxa
tion is also "one way of leveling the
playing field," said Michelle Zamo
ra, a graduate student in modern
thought and literature in reference
to students at colleges who do not
provide stipends as generous as
those offered by Stanford.
As for students already in school,
tax relief could encourage them to

finish their degrees under tight fi
nancial circumstances rather than
discontinuing their studies, said rep
resentative Alex Ene.
Some questioned the fairness of
exempting student stipends, since
the paychecks of working students
and other members of the labor
force will continue to be taxed.
Alice Lincoln, a representative at
large, warned that requesting addi
tional tax relief "comes across as a
bit socially irresponsible," since
graduate students "will ultimately
make a lot more money."
Ganguli pointed out that gradu
ate students would still pay taxes on
income that does not go towards
rent and said that providing tax re
lief for those who would go on to
contribute to society is an ideal way
to support higher education.
Law student Carter Rummel
nonetheless thinks the current tax
code is fair enough.
"It's hard to see why income from
being a graduate student should be
tax-exempt when no income from
other jobs, except serving in the mil
itary in a combat zone, is given a sim
ilar free ride," he said.
Morris Cohen, a research assis

tant for electrical engineering and
physics, agreed.
"Grad students don't have a
briefcase full of money to toss
around, but no one goes to grad
school so they can become a million
aire before they graduate," he rea
soned.
The council has been a member
of the National Association of Grad
uate and Professional Students since
its establishment in 1996 and will
join organizations like the National
Science Foundation at the upcoming
conference, which will take place
Nov. 5-9. Members have not yet cho
sen the representatives to attend
next month's event.
Singh attended a lobby day in
February with the National Coali
tion of Graduate Students For An
Affordable and Accessible Educa
tion, a group within the organiza
tion hosting the November confer
ence.
"It was a very educational expe
rience, especially in the area of civics
and government," he said.
Lincoln is eager to see more of a
response to tax relief advocacy, as it
is currently "something a lot of peo
ple on campus aren't aware of."
