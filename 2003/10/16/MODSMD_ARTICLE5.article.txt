The Undergraduate Advising
Center has appointed History Prof.
Steven Zipperstein as its faculty direc
tor, a new position that has been cre
ated in response to the center's weak
reputation.
"Part of what seems central to ed
ucation is a faculty member's ongoing
relationships with students," said Zip
perstein, who will be engaged in the
position on a part-time basis while
maintaining his regular professorial
responsibilities.
Assistant Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Carol Porter said
the University is committed to faculty
engagement in undergraduate advis
ing.
"Stanford feels strongly about
having faculty involved in the advising
of undergraduates, and we're all try
ing to figure out how to make that
work more effectively," she said.
Despite Stanford's declared com
mitment to undergraduates, it is not
uncommon to hear students express
dissatisfaction with undergraduate
advising. While opportunities do exist
to explore majors, such as Sophomore
College and Freshman and Sopho

more Introductory Seminars, a sub
stantial portion of the junior class has
yet to declare a major.
And despite the center's recent ef
forts to provide undergraduates with
more guidance, many students say
they have had negative experiences
with their academic advisers, al
though the peer academic advisers
often met with better reviews.
"My PAA was awesome she
was like my friend, so we talked about
lots of different things," said sopho
more Silvia Babikian, who is now a
PAA herself. "My AA was there, but
she left at the end of last year, so we
got stuck with a random adviser."
To both students and administra
tors, the fact that so many juniors are
still undeclared is symptomatic of in
adequate advising.
"If students had more exposure
[to academic departments] or more
collaborative relationships before
they get to that juncture of choosing
their major, perhaps they would find
it easier to do," Porter said. "I know
that many students wait to declare
their major because they can't find
an adviser in their department in a
timely way."
The inability to find an adviser is,
in fact, exactly what has kept junior

Renee Hudson from declaring her
major as English.
"I think a lot of professors are hard
to approach," Hudson said. "I've
known my major since I was 8 years
old, so it's kind of ridiculous that I
haven't declared yet and that John
Bravman's all about putting my ac
count on hold just because I'm hold
ing out on finding a good adviser, and
I really haven't found one yet."
Zipperstein agreed with Porter
that closer student-faculty relation
ships might help students decide on
their major more quickly.
"As I see it, Stanford, like so many
of its peer institutions,"is wrestling
with how to bring students and facul
ty together in an incredibly uneco
nomic yet essential way namely,
one-on-one contact," Zipperstein
said.
Hudson has so far been unsuccess
ful in developing the sort of relation
ship that Zipperstein describes.
"I got an adviser in my depart- â€¢
ment, and he was really nice to me,
but I didn't feel as comfortable talking
to him as I would've liked," she said.
"When I told him I wanted to switch
advisers, he was nice about it but did
