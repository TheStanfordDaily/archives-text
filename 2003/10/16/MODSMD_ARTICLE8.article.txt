# Student group rallies around Howard Dean
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
With the Democratic primaries as early as
January, a group of Stanford students has
galvanized in support of Howard Dean, the
former Vermont governor who has struck a
chord among some liberal college voters in
his campaign for the Democratic party nom
ination.
About 100 Stanford students have joined
the mailing list of Generation Dean-Stan
ford, the local chapter of an organization cre
ated by the Dean campaign as part of a grass
roots effort to garner the support of younger
voters.
Sophomores Paul Kreiner and John
Hamilton founded Stanford's Generation
Dean chapter during spring quarter of last
year, after hearing about Dean during an in
troductory class in American politics and at
tending a local "MeetUp" sponsored by the
campaign.
The Meet Ups, organized online, are a
way for Dean supporters to gather together
and discuss ways to help the campaign in
their own communities.
"We liked what we heard about Dean and
the meeting and wanted to get involved,"
Kreiner said. "One of the campaign workers
at the event suggested we start our own or
ganization on campus, so we did."
The Dean generation
Dean has gained a considerable amount
of support among college students and
young professionals, an age group that has
typically been regarded as politically apa
thetic and thus ignored by most politicians.
Although his platform is part of his appeal,
many of his college-aged supporters say they
are drawn to his personality as well.
"The thing that strikes people whenever

they meet Dean is that he is not different
when he's onstage and when he's offstage,"
said Arizona State University senior Tony
Cani, one of five national coordinators for
the Generation Dean campaign. "He's not
worried about what the media will report
he just answers questions honestly. He's a
regular guy who cares about the people he's
talking to; he is charismatic, he has a great
sense of humor and he's going to be presi
dent."
According to Cani, more than 10,000 indi
vidual members are registered on the Web
site, and he expects that number to double as
the site adds new features in the next few
weeks.
The Stanford chapter of Generation
Dean is one of 725 groups also registered on
the site, representing high schools, colleges
and young professionals from every state.
There are also groups started by Americans
living abroad in places like the United King
dom, Canada and Spain.
A grassroots approach
The impact of Generation Dean illus
trates the impact of Dean's push for the sup
port of young voters, supporters believe.
"The Dean campaign is the first presi
dential campaign in a while to truly utilize
grassroots organizing, and Generation
Dean is the perfect example of this," said
sophomore Ben Elberger. "By organizing
college students across the nation, Howard
Dean is involving young people in a mean
ingful and important way in the political
process."
At a recent rally at Arizona State Univer
sity, Dean said to a crowd of 3,500 students,
"A lot of politicians like to stand up in front
of young people and talk about how young
people are the 'foot soldiers' of their cam
paigns. You're not the foot soldiers of my

campaign. You're driving my campaign."
Some students who are dissatisfied with
the Bush administration support Dean as a
candidate who is unafraid to challenge the
status quo. In his speeches, Dean frequently
criticizes President George Bush's policies
and the war in Iraq.
"By getting involved in Generation Dean
here on campus, I feel I'm working for a
cause that will make America a better place
for all people," said Elberger, who also vol
unteered for the Dean campaign in New
Hampshire over the summer. "I figure, how
often do you get to work for someone that re
ally will make the whole country a better
place?"

Too far left?
Junior Dylan Mefford, president of the
Stanford Democrats, predicted that if Dean
secures the Democratic Party nomination,
the debate on the war in Iraq will help him
win the presidential election as well.
"Dean will do particularly well against
Bush on the Iraq issue because the war has
proven to be a complete failure," Mefford
said. "The majority of Americans now be
lieve that the war in Iraq was not worth fight
ing, and that number will only grow as the
American casualties mount."
One concern of the Democratic Party,
however, is that Dean's views may be too far

left of the center for him to do well in the gen
eral election.
Some Republicans are even donating
money to Dean's campaign in hopes that he
will win the Democratic nomination, as they
see him as the easiest contender for Bush,
according to a recent Newsweek article
But some Republicans on campus have
voiced disagreement with Dean's left-wing
views.
"Howard Dean is a representative of the
truly liberal wing of the Democratic Party,
one which is increasingly moving away from
the values of mainstream America," said
sophomore Bob Sensenbrenner, vice presi
dent of the Stanford College Republicans.
