## Vinni hits up the hookup 
### 
Today we'll be dis
cussing hookups and
dating but, because
we're at Stanford,
mainly hookups.
Such liaisons come in all
shapes and sizes. They happen
when you're sober, when
you're drunk, when you're
happy and when you're sad
but mostly when you're drunk.
They happen for all sorts of rea
sons: You're mad at your
boyfriend for looking at anoth
er boy; you're mad at your girl-

friend for
sleeping
with an
other man;
or you're
just plain
wasted.
Regard
less, there
is a right
way and a
wrong
way, and it
bods down
to more

than not chewing your arm off
to get out of a nasty situation.
Your basic hookup happens
when you're drunk and single
and just want some ass. You see
a cute guy / girl / what-have-you
across the room of a frat party
and are like "damn! That's what
I'm talking about" or, in my
case, "wow, that boy's really
cute, I wonder if he'll like me."
You go over, try to act slick,
but it doesn't matter because
you're both already so drunk,
you each sound like a complete
ass. One thing leads to another
and in less than 60 seconds
you've put something some
where and wake up the next
morning not really knowing
which thing went where.
Now, despite what some of
you may assume (notice the
"ass" in "assume"), it does mat
ter if you had sex, didn't have sex
or don't remember if you had
sex. If you don't remember,
there's not much you can do
about it. I recommend checking
both your phone for his number
and your blood for his disease.
Keep in mind: If you don't re
member what happened, and es
pecially if you're a bit sore, you
could have slept with the entire
Berkeley football team and we
both know, or rather don't
know, where they've been.
If you are unlucky enough to
remember what happened and
had sex, here's what to do: If
you didn't say more than two
words, and I'm assuming we all
know what those two words de
manded, then you don't owe
the person anything. Good re
lationships don't start because
of random hookups. Unless you
remember the person to be par
ticularly special, move on.
Chances are, they've already
forgotten about it and moved
on themselves.
All that changes under spe
cial circumstances. If you in any
way manipulated him into bed,
you owe him a date. I'm not say
ing you should hookup with
him again; in fact that's the
exact opposite of what I'm say
ing. What I'm saying is that if
the person wasn't as willing as
you to have sex, he put himself
on the line for you, and now it's
your responsibility to put your
self on the line by not making
him feel like a washed-up piece
of old laundry.
Now, I know you all gasped
when I wrote "responsibility"
in a sex column, but, if you did,
you all need to wake up! Mean
ingless hookup sex is only
meaningless if both of you feel
in your heart of hearts that it
was meaningless otherwise
it's something extremely per
sonal and extremely fragile be
cause it's linked, in one way or
another, to a person's most pri
vate feelings.
Don't be a baby, don't be a
wimp. It's not that hard to tell if
the sex meant something and it's
not that hard to tell if you got him
into bed against his better judg
ment. Just give his a call. That's
all that I ask. He'll feel better be
cause at least you're not a com
plete jerk. And so will you be
cause more action is always wait
ing around the corner.

For a good time, e-mail Vinni.
