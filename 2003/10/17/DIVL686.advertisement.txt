A saner view of life
At first sight, it would appear that the world is now in deeper crisis than ever before. War and ter
rorism have quickened the pace of events and filled the hearts of millions with fear. Were this the true
reading of the present situation there would indeed be cause for fear and lamentation. Happily, this view
is superficial and hides the many changes for the better which, quietly, with little attention, are likewise
taking place. War and terror are sensational and make potent news. Far-reaching actions which
enhance the lives of millions seldom make headlines, and are lost amid the tumult of imperious gov
ernments and uneasy dictators.
The world is deeply indebted to the many United Nations agencies whose careful, selfless work
goes steadily on amid the rhetoric and bravado of the power-drunk politicians. The time is fast coming
when men will realize that the needs of the world are the needs of men and women everywhere: for food
and work, for health-care and education. These are the priorities which should guide men's actions and
engage their energy and resource. These are the perennial needs of all; humanity neglects them at its
peril.
Specialist non-governmental groups likewise add their insights and researches, awakening men to
the dangers in the headlong rush to further abuse this already ailing planet.
Many see who erstwhile did not. Many walk who formerly sat and watched their brothers run and
play. For the first time in their lives, the world is full of hope for many who suffered in silence.
To these quiet and patient ones, life is opening its windows, letting in the sunshine and fresh air.
Through the work of the many agencies new, invigorating energy now flows, and the people respond
and rejoice. These, the servers, are the true heroes of this time. Not those who drop the bombs from
the high clouds but those who sense the needs of their brothers and sisters, and act, no matter the cost.
When Maitreya makes His appearance, openly, to all, He will inspire the creation of a saner atti
tude to life grounded in serving the needs of men and women everywhere. He will show that the con
flicts of the present are not inevitable. That leaders of nations have a responsibility to humanity at large,
and not alone to their subjective feelings or ideology. He will call for caution and wisdom with regard
to today's weapons of terrible power, and warn of the fruitlessness of war 'for the sake of peace'.
Peace, He will show, is not difficult to find if honesdy sought. Peace, He will say, will be achieved
only with justice and freedom for all. Thus will Maitreya set the target for change. Thus will men be
inspired to take the simple step into the unknown and to see the fulfillment of the dreams and longings
for peace which men have for long held in their hearts.
