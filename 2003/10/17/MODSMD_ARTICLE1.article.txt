# HOMECOMING
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Just when Stanford needed a serious
ego booster, another top-ten team is
rolling into Palo Alto this weekend.
Homecoming couldn't come at a better
time for the Cardinal — which will play its
first game at Stanford Stadium in over a
month — one week after getting blitzed at
No. 4 USC, 44-21.
Then again, Stanford (2-2,0-2 Pacific 10
Conference) gets the unenviable task of
hosting sixth-ranked Washington State (5-
1,2-0) Saturday at 2 p.m.
And if the Cardinal is going to be com
petitive, it will have to find a way to shake
off the potentially psychologically-de
structive loss in Los Angeles.
The so-called staunch Stanford defense
gave up 413 yards of total offense and 41
points in the first half alone, and the young
offense struggled to move the ball against
a talented, physical front four.
"It's always hard to lose in that fash
ion," said Stanford nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo. "It's difficult to swallow. But
now we face another high-ranked team.
We want to jump right back in it and show
what we can do."
Like the Trojans, the surprising
Cougars boast an extremely complete ball
club; it leads the conference in scoring de
fense and turnover margin. It ranks second
in rushing offense, passing offense, rush
defense, pass efficiency and kick returns,
among others.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens,
for one, believes last week's experience
will only help the younger players learn
how to battle.
"It was difficult to prepare for a team
like USC that is so potent in so many dif
ferent areas," he said. "But now our guys
understand what it takes to compete at
that level."

In practice this week, Teevens tried to
build off the team's second half perfor
mance— the defense held USC to four
first downs and 80 yards of total offense —
to get things moving in the right direction
for this week.
But he knows his team has a lot of work
to do.
If Stanford wants to avoid another
blowout against yet another talented
opponent, several problems need to be
rectified.
The supposed stingy run defense of the
Cardinal — which at one point was ranked
first in the nation — has now given up 385
yards on the ground in the last two games.
The emphasis this week, therefore, will
be tackling well, especially at the point of
attack, according to Oshinowo.
"We didn't tackle as well as we wanted
to," he said. "We've had some communi
cation difficulties on the stunts we've run
but we've been working on that."
The Cardinal also needs to get more
production from the quarterback posi
tion. Trent Edwards, in his third consec
utive ineffective game, was pulled for the
first time in favor of fifth-year senior
Chris Lewis. (Teevens said Lewis got in
the game because they wanted to get
Lewis some snaps, but also said that the
quarterback earned his way into the
game based on his practice perfor
mance.)
Since his stellar debut against San Jose
State, Edwards has completed just 34-of
74 passes for 251 yards with five intercep
tions and two touchdowns.
But the Stanford coach is still sticking
with his young quarterback for now.
"Trent continues to execute and make
good plays and decisions," Teevens said.
"At times there are things he'd like to have
back, but I feel like he's progressing."
Stanford also has to involve deep threat
Luke Powell more in the offense. Powell

has only made nine catches in his last three
games after opening the season with 12 re
ceptions — two of them for touchdowns.
"People are aware that he's the guy
we look towards, and maybe they try to
change his significance in the offense,"
Teevens said. "As the defense focuses
on Powell, maybe the ball goes to other
players."
Those other players might be freshmen,
if last week's game was any indication.
Against USC, freshmen running
back David Marrero and tight end
Patrick Danahy both picked up their
first collegiate touchdowns and 6-foot
7 wide receiver Evan Moore recorded
his first catch and finished with 5 re
ceptions for 52 yards.
"They're gifted athletes and are picking
up the system," Teevens said. "Their con
fidence levels are where they feel they can
compete productively at this level."
Defensively, Stanford's corner
backs will need to elevate their game
— literally — to stay with gifted 6-
foot-3 wide receiver Devard Darling,
who had an 84-yard touchdown last
week against Arizona.
On special teams, the Cougars boast
one of the nation's best kickers (Drew
Dunning) and one of the most dangerous
return men (Sammy Moore, who averages
125 all-purpose yards per game).
Obviously, Stanford will be in for a
challenge of monstrous proportions come
kickoff.
But, if nothing else, there's probably
something to be said for the comforts of
home.
"It's important for our players to be
back on campus," Teevens said. "We've
traveled for a while and it's just nice to
have some regularity."
Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium. And, as always, the game will be
broadcast on KZSU, 90.1 FM.

Just when Stanford needed a serious
ego booster, another top-ten team is
rolling into Palo Alto this weekend.
Homecoming couldn't come at a better
time for the Cardinal — which will play its
first game at Stanford Stadium in over a
month — one week after getting blitzed at
No. 4 USC, 44-21.
Then again, Stanford (2-2,0-2 Pacific 10
Conference) gets the unenviable task of
hosting sixth-ranked Washington State (5-
1,2-0) Saturday at 2 p.m.
And if the Cardinal is going to be com
petitive, it will have to find a way to shake
off the potentially psychologically-de
structive loss in Los Angeles.
The so-called staunch Stanford defense
gave up 413 yards of total offense and 41
points in the first half alone, and the young
offense struggled to move the ball against
a talented, physical front four.
"It's always hard to lose in that fash
ion," said Stanford nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo. "It's difficult to swallow. But
now we face another high-ranked team.
We want to jump right back in it and show
what we can do."
Like the Trojans, the surprising
Cougars boast an extremely complete ball
club; it leads the conference in scoring de
fense and turnover margin. It ranks second
in rushing offense, passing offense, rush
defense, pass efficiency and kick returns,
among others.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens,
for one, believes last week's experience
will only help the younger players learn
how to battle.
"It was difficult to prepare for a team
like USC that is so potent in so many dif
ferent areas," he said. "But now our guys
understand what it takes to compete at
that level."

In practice this week, Teevens tried to
build off the team's second half perfor
mance— the defense held USC to four
first downs and 80 yards of total offense —
to get things moving in the right direction
for this week.
But he knows his team has a lot of work
to do.
If Stanford wants to avoid another
blowout against yet another talented
opponent, several problems need to be
rectified.
The supposed stingy run defense of the
Cardinal — which at one point was ranked
first in the nation — has now given up 385
yards on the ground in the last two games.
The emphasis this week, therefore, will
be tackling well, especially at the point of
attack, according to Oshinowo.
"We didn't tackle as well as we wanted
to," he said. "We've had some communi
cation difficulties on the stunts we've run
but we've been working on that."
The Cardinal also needs to get more
production from the quarterback posi
tion. Trent Edwards, in his third consec
utive ineffective game, was pulled for the
first time in favor of fifth-year senior
Chris Lewis. (Teevens said Lewis got in
the game because they wanted to get
Lewis some snaps, but also said that the
quarterback earned his way into the
game based on his practice perfor
mance.)
Since his stellar debut against San Jose
State, Edwards has completed just 34-of
74 passes for 251 yards with five intercep
tions and two touchdowns.
But the Stanford coach is still sticking
with his young quarterback for now.
"Trent continues to execute and make
good plays and decisions," Teevens said.
"At times there are things he'd like to have
back, but I feel like he's progressing."
Stanford also has to involve deep threat
Luke Powell more in the offense. Powell

has only made nine catches in his last three
games after opening the season with 12 re
ceptions — two of them for touchdowns.
"People are aware that he's the guy
we look towards, and maybe they try to
change his significance in the offense,"
Teevens said. "As the defense focuses
on Powell, maybe the ball goes to other
players."
Those other players might be freshmen,
if last week's game was any indication.
Against USC, freshmen running
back David Marrero and tight end
Patrick Danahy both picked up their
first collegiate touchdowns and 6-foot
7 wide receiver Evan Moore recorded
his first catch and finished with 5 re
ceptions for 52 yards.
"They're gifted athletes and are picking
up the system," Teevens said. "Their con
fidence levels are where they feel they can
compete productively at this level."
Defensively, Stanford's corner
backs will need to elevate their game

foot-3 wide receiver Devard Darling,
