## Til death — or financial woes — do us part 
### JOEL STEIN 
Editor's Note: In honor of the alumni who
are gracing our campus for homecoming
weekend, here's a little blast from the past:
an Intermission column written in 1992 by
journalist alumnus Joel Stein. Currently a
humor columnist for Time Magazine, you
can also catch him making commentary on
VHl's "I Love the '80s" and "I Love the
'70s" marathons.

It may be shocking to current students
to see how little has changed in a decade
here on the Farm ...
There comes a time when you have to
walk forward and embrace your future like
it was your rich, fat aunt. Close your eyes,
hold your breath and pray for a check with
a rainbow on it.
Luckily, this time hash't come yet.
But it will. And if yoii don't prepare,
you'll be as sorry as you were when you
found out they already cast the new Brady
Bunch movie. So get off your haunches and
find a wife. Or the appropriately gendered
mate of your choice. I'm going with wife.
Worked for Billy Joel. And I'm better
looking. .
Finding a wife is one of the two most im
portant things you can do While you're at
Stanford. The other is complex and con
cerns explosives and a key to Ed Meese's
office. Stick with the wife thing.
Marry early. Your grandparents mar
ried before puberty, and they're gumming '
their way to Valhalla.
Senior year is much too late to start
looking. Every Thursday night, in a desper
ate attempt to justify this "Senior Presi
dent" scam, 100 people get dressed up, go
to a local bar and talk to the people they ate
dinner with.
The vast majority of them are looking to v
tie that big, ugly knot. Because if they don't
find someone at Senior Pub Night, they'll
find them at another bar. And they won't
have half the earning potential.
That's right. If you marry a Stanfordite,
your cash flow is effectively doubled. Espe
cially if you're willing to walk over to the
trailer park and feign interest in graduate
level physics.
Buying a big, gaudy, Tom Shane-sized
engagement ring for yotir secretary may
sound romantic in a demented Arnie Beck
er kind of way, but it'll do nothing for that
second home. It also may land you in front
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Because, unless you're willing to chance
it and see what happens when Chelsea's
braces come off, waiting a couple of years
will only reduce your power fating in the
great game of life. Odds are, you'll have to
sell the cattle ranch.
So for those of you who are too busy to
do the research yourself, I've set up this *
convenient, easy-to-read questionnaire.
Keep it on you at all times and bring it into
conversation as smoothly as you did the
Purity Test:

vorce is Financially Preferable — Ques
