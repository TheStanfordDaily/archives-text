# HERE COMES THE BRIDE

### STUTI GOSWAMY 
An unavoidable thing happens once you experience
Stanford: You start loving it. And you love it to such an ex
tent that five, 10,30 years down the road, there might be a
strong inclination to share "the happiest day of your life"
with the school that gave you so many happy days. Memo
rial Church, affectionately called MemChu, attracts more
than pre-midterm prayers and the afternoon tour group.
Imagine your wedding in the middle of the Main Quad,
two doors down from your freshman math class, one block
away from your first bike crash and 20 feet away from the
drunken kiss you had during Full Moon. I bet your fiancee
would love that story.
MemChu is celebrating its 100th anniversary by offer
ing monthly Centennial Chats, informal gatherings in the
Side Chapel. This month, Betsy Koester, the church's
wedding coordinator since 1984, shared her most heart
warming and her most heart-stopping experiences.
Koester visited Stanford in March of 1954 from New
York City. Her first impression was that the campus had
the most beautiful chapel she had ever seen. Graduating
here in 1958, she returned in 1984 to oversee weddings.
She has coordinated almost 2,500 weddings and has
enough personal experiences to prove that weddings are
far from generic, uneventful ceremonies.
As an interfaith church, MemChu encourages all reli
gions and cultures to celebrate weddings there. The
church has held Catholic, Protestant, Buddist, Hindu,
Jewish and Muslim ceremonies along with many others. A
minimum three-month reservation is required and either
the bride or groom must have graduated, taught or
worked at Stanford.
On average, weddings cost $22,000. Take a deep
breath. That's half an academic year's tuition for a two
hour event. However, MemChu is priced at $1,400, which
includes services, a sexton, CD of the ceremony and three
counseling sessions. You can add an organist and clergy
for $200 more.
So how does one go about planning a Stanford wed
ding? First, a call is made to the wedding coordinator to re
serve a date and time. The counselor and couple will talk
about their backgrounds, communication skills, financial
situation, intimacy and religion. The counselor recom
mends a few books like "Why Marriages Succeed and
Fail" and "The Good Marriage."
Koester shared her tales of "wedding woe and bliss."
She once went out of the office over Labor Day and when
she returned she had 60 voicemails on her machine. She
called back one frequent number and was connected to
the Stanford Hospital delivery room. A woman excitedly
answered that her daughter wants to schedule her wed
ding for the summer. She was adamant about an Aug. 16,
3 p.m. wedding despite repeated apologies that the time
was already booked. Finally, Koester had to politely sug
gest that the couple should call her later, when the daugh
ter was out of labor.
Most weddings at MemChu are beautiful and run
smoothly, according to Koester. Yet as the elegantly gray
haired coordinator pointed out, "when I started this job,
my hair was brown." An especially tense moment hap
pened five minutes before a ceremony, when the brides
maids' dresses had still not arrived. The bride was ready
but her best friends were still in cut-off jeans and tank tops.
Finally, Koester thought, "Well, we have choir robes."
Another last minute fiasco occurred when Koester
went to bring the bride's family into the church so the cer
emony could start. Instead of waiting in the room, the fam
ily was crawling around the grass outside. Her worst fears
were confirmed. The diamond wedding ring was lost
somewhere in the lawn. The wedding went on as sched
uled sans a wedding ring. While the wedding party left for
the reception, Koester and her ingenious coordinating
team rented a metal detector and for an hour, swept up
and down the grass praying for some encouraging
"beeps." Luckily, they found it
and returned the ring to its delighted owner.
Other crazy and unscripted things have happened at
MemChu â€” enough to satisfy a few Hollywood romantic
comedies. However, all ceremonies have been character
ized by happy endings. No one has ever been stood-up on
his or her wedding day in MemChu's history beginning
with the first wedding on Feb. 27,1903.
