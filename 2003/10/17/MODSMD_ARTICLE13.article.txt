## Students present research projects to peers and alumni

With project titles ranging from senior Lynnea
Mills's "Loving Your Sister and Loving Ice
Cream" to sophomore Yuriy Teslyar's "One Di
mensional Quantum Mechanical Modeling of
Nanotransistors," this year's second annual Sym
posium of Undergraduate Research in Progress
attracted a diverse turnout.
Organized by the Undergraduate Research
Programs (URP) office to coincide with Stan
ford's Reunion Homecoming weekend, more
than 70 students, representing a variety of disci
plines, presented their projects to a crowd of stu
dents and alumni.
To present at the symposium, prospective stu
dent researchers were required to go through a
short application process involving the submission
of a project description and abstract, along with
the name of a faculty sponsor.
After applying, the student presenters were cho
sen based mostly on their level of motivation and
interest, explained sophomore Caitlan Quancy,
who works at Undergraduate Research Programs.
"But the students who apply are largely self-se
lective, so we don't really end up having to cut
many projects," she said.
While getting involved in research at Stanford
as an undergraduate does require a certain level of
motivation, it doesn't require previous research
experience.
"When I applied to join Sophomore Research
College, the only previous experience I had with
research was through my one BioSci 44x experi
mental lab class," junior Melissa Wong said.
Summer Research College is not the only way
to get involved. The Undergraduate Research
Programs office offers a variety of major, minor
and specialized Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities grants, ranging from $500 to $3,000.
In addition, individual academic departments
at Stanford — and even individual faculty mem
bers — will offer research opportunities to under
graduate students.
"I first got involved in research my sophomore
year, when I saw [Psychology Prof. Michael] Ram
scar's flyer on the wall advertising for research as
sistants," said junior Kevin Holmes. "I liked what
was going on, so I stayed on and decided to get
even more involved, working in the lab over the
summer, and here I am."
Wong, who presented her Summer Research
College project at the symposium this year, said
she enjoys discussing her research.
"I think explaining it to others
helps me to focus on and understand
my own work better, and I had a lot
of fun too," she said.
Others, such as junior Michael
Hasper, had somewhat different
motivations: "Presenting my re
search project at SURP was 'highly
suggested' as part of my President's

Scholarship award," he explained.
Many of the people who attend
ed SURP were alumni who re
turned o the Farm for the annual
Homecoming Weekend.
Sophomore Emily Shen came to
SURP just to look around.
"I wanted to see what projects
people were working on, and I want
ed to support my friends who were
presenting their research projects
today," she said. "In the future, I
definitely want to do some research
of my own."
