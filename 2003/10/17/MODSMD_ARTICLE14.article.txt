# New fitness center in the works

### EUGENIE KIM 
The Athletic department is in the early
planning stages for the construction of a
new 75,000 square-foot recreation center
expected to break-ground in early 2004.
"We are in the midst of planning, and
we have just received concept and site ap
proval from the Board of Trustees for the
construction of a new athletic center," said
Ray Purpur, an associate athletic director.
The new facility will include three bas
ketball/volleyball courts, six squash
courts, two racquetball courts, a climbing
room, a fitness room and a recreational
weight room slated to be 1 1 / 2 times the
size of the weight room in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center.
Planners hope the new recreational
facility will alleviate many of the con
cerns students have expressed about the
existing recreational athletic facilities on
campus.
"This will be an improved place for stu
dents, faculty and staff to use," Purpur
said.
In recent years, an increasing number
of students have complained about the
lack of sufficient workout equipment to
satisfy the needs of the non-athletes and
other exercisers on campus.
"They just need more floor space and
more equipment to accommodate all the
students," said sophomore Adam Harris.
"I also wish we had more access as non
athletes to Arrillaga."
At Arrillaga, considered by many to be
the best-equipped workout complex, the
fitness room is open for general recreation
al use on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and from 5:30 to 11 p.m. The result is that
there are often "rush hours," during which
exercisers must wait in line to get into the
room and then possibly wait in another line
for the more popular machines.
According to Assistant Athletic Direc
tor Sherry Posthumus, the irregular hours
at Arrillaga are designed to fit the needs of
varsity teams with those of the rest of the
Stanford population. She added that the
times were not chosen with only varsity
athletes in mind.
"It seems to be the best system right
now because there are 34 varsity teams
that have to go through that weight room,
so it's tight," Posthumus said. "But we re
alize that we've got a whole bunch of other
students on this campus, not just athletes.

We try to schedule our hours in such a way
that they meet the needs of the students
and faculty."
A varsity athlete who asked to remain
anonymous said he sees the current time
schedule as the best way to balance avail
able space with demand.
"Even during athlete-only hours, three
or four teams are using the equipment si
multaneously, so the problem is not neces
sarily specific to non-athletes," he said.
When asked about Arrillaga and the
other fitness facilities — Tresidder Fit
ness Center, Roble Gym and the Ford
Center — many students expressed dis
content, while others were complimenta
ry-
"The facilities are terrible," said senior
Irene Lu. Freshman volleyball player Josh

Schwarzapel, on the other hand, called
them "state-of-the-art."
Regarding Tresidder Fitness, students
expressed appreciation for its late hours
but criticized the cramped quarters and in
adequate equipment. In addition, exercis
ers said the glass walls surrounding the
room coupled with its location in the heart
of Tresidder Union give them the eerie
feeling that they are being watched.
"Tresidder is the main place for non
athletes to work out, yet it is the place that
needs the most improvements," sopho
more Aisha Ali said. iu, io
Senior Melanie Wong agreed.
"It's much too small, there's not
enough equipment for everybody, and it's
a fishbowl," she said. "There's also no air
conditioning, so there's not enough air cir-

culation and the room gets very stuffy."
In response to criticism, Posthumus
said that the Athletic Department makes
a concerted effort to address the com
plaints of those who would like to see im
provements in the fitness centers.
"It was just around two years ago that
we asked for a one-time $50,000 incre
ment to go into our budget for Tresidder
so that we could replace everything that
was in there," Posthumus said. "We
squeezed as much as we could in that little
space. People will e-mail me complaints
and concerns that they have,: and I take it
from there."
With regard to the specific issue of
Tresidder ventilation, Purpur said there
