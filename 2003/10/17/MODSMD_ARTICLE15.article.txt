# American Studies revamping curriculum
## 
### REBECCA LIAO 
The American Studies program is creating a more
rigorous curriculum in hopes of drawing higher enroll
ment. The changes came in response to criticism that
the program lacked structure.
The School of Humanities and Sciences and the Fac
ulty Senate has shown its concern about the program for
several years, giving it increasingly short periods of re
newal. Most recently, the senate passed a two-year re
newal late last spring, effective from 2005 to 2007.
Interdisciplinary programs are usually renewed for a
five-year period if the University thinks they are doing
well. In outstanding cases, they are re-authorized for
eight years. Senate members wanted to emphasize the
need for improvements in the American Studies pro
gram by granting it a relatively short renewal.
Administrators emphasized that the future of the
program is in no way threatened, but some have sug
gested that it needs reforms if it is to merit a longer re
newal period.
"The intellectual focus of American Studies is not
clear, particularly in light of the shifting intellectual
landscape at Stanford," said Russell Berman, the cog
nizant dean for undergraduate studies at the time of the
renewal.
In response, the American Studies faculty has been
aggressively revamping the program to make it more
academically rigorous and structured.
The number of units required for the major has been
upped from 60 to 75. Also, starting this year, those who
declare a major in American Studies must fulfill a core
requirement of three classes in the area of history, three
classes in literature and the arts and one course in the
area of comparative race and ethnicity. Though course
selection remains flexible, more specific courses are
now required.
Additionally, students are required to design a con
centration comprised of five courses and to take a "cap
stone" seminar during their senior year.
Many who declared their major before June 2002
had designed their own program with the guidance of a
faculty adviser. Although a thematic focus was still re
quired, class selection was completely up to the student.

While much of the criteria used to review interdisci
plinary programs is subjective, the senate is also con
cerned with more quantitative measures, Berman said,
pointing out that the number of students graduating
from the program is considerably lower than its peak in
the mid-1990s and far below the 10-year average.
"The two year renewal was a way of making sure that
the program was not up for evaluation the minute a new
director arrived on campus," said the new director of
the program, English Prof. Shelley Fishkin.
Judy Goldstein, cognizant dean in the School of Hu

manities and Sciences, echoed those sentiments.
"The review process directs resources in a particular
direction, and everyone agreed that the University, the
program and, of course, students would be better served
if we waited," she said.
Fishkin said that the reforms to the program might
not be over.
"A university of Stanford's caliber should have one
of the best American Studies programs around," she
said. "I will do everything in my power to make that
happen."
