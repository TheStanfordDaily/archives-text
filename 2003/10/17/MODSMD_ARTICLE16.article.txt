# Congress considers student privacy bill
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford officials have taken a strong stance against
the Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a bill that will
be pitched in Congress this fall that would allow stu
dents and parents to sue universities for harmful priva
cy violations.
The new bill is a modification of the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, known as
FERPA, which discontinues federal funding to any

universities that release private records. No institutions
have ever been penalized under this law, but the Uni
versity remains concerned about the possibility.
Administrators argue that the bill could lead to friv
olous lawsuits and would not significantly change the
way student records are handled.
"I don't think giving individuals the ability to sue the
University, in addition to the threat of the cutoff of fed
eral funds, would make anyone at the University be
have any differently," said University Registrar Roger
Printup. "Those of us who handle a great deal of stu

dent information are fully conscious of our responsibil
ities under the law and endeavor to act in compliance
with it."
All student information that is not considered "di
rectory" information is treated as private, Printup said.
People within the University who have a legitimate ed
ucational interest can access private information, but
that information is unavailable to people outside the
University.
Except in special situations, such
as when lending agencies need infor
mation to provide students with fi
nancial assistance, students are re
quired to give permission before
their records are released. For exam
ple, they ask for their transcripts to
be released by using Axess.
The new legislation, proposed by
New Jersey Congressman Robert
Andrews, is a direct response to a
Supreme Court case last year in
which a Gonzaga University alum
nus tried to sue the school for releas
ing private information that prevent
ed him from getting a job as an ele
mentary school teacher. The
Supreme Court ruled in favor of the
school because FERPA did not ex

plicitly grant people the right to sue.
Sheldon Steinbach, vice presi
dent and general counsel of the
American Council on Education,
said, "The instances of individuals
having purported FERPA violations
have been so infinitesimal as to not
warrant a change in the law," ac
cording to an article in the Chronicle
of Education.
He added that it would create ad
ditional costs for colleges, including
litigation and court fees or settle
ments to avoid going to court.
"Stanford believes that this pro
posed legislation adds no substan
tive protections for students, but in
creases the likelihood of expensive,
often frivolous, litigation," said
Thomas Fenner, deputy general
counsel for the University.
Others argue that the new legisla
tion is unnecessary because state
laws already grant students the right
to sue for privacy infringements.

Several students expressed mixed
feelings about the new legislation.
"This bill seems to really put stu
dents' rights at the forefront, a prior
ity that's often forgotten," said
sophomore Allen Huang. "But, at
the same time, I think it's just creat
ing more bureaucracy, and instead of
protecting students' rights, it just
paves the way for universities to be
tied up in lawsuits."
Sophomore Devarati Mitra
agreed.
"As long as there are conse
quences for violating students' pri
vacy, I don't think creating more op
portunities for litigation is the solu
tion," she said.
Other possible changes imple
mented by the bill include extending
privacy rights to home-schooled stu
dents and allowing universities to
accept electronic signatures to per
mit access to online records by third
parties.
