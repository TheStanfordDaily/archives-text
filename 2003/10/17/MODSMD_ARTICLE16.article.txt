# Congress considers student privacy bill
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford officials have taken a strong stance against
the Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a bill that will
be pitched in Congress this fall that would allow stu
dents and parents to sue universities for harmful priva
cy violations.
The new bill is a modification of the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, known as
FERPA, which discontinues federal funding to any

universities that release private records. No institutions
have ever been penalized under this law, but the Uni
versity remains concerned about the possibility.
Administrators argue that the bill could lead to friv
olous lawsuits and would not significantly change the
way student records are handled.
"I don't think giving individuals the ability to sue the
University, in addition to the threat of the cutoff of fed
eral funds, would make anyone at the University be
have any differently," said University Registrar Roger
Printup. "Those of us who handle a great deal of stu

dent information are fully conscious of our responsibil
ities under the law and endeavor to act in compliance
with it."
All student information that is not considered "di
rectory" information is treated as private, Printup said.
People within the University who have a legitimate ed
ucational interest can access private information, but
that information is unavailable to people outside the
University.
