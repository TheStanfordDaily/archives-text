# Researchers isolate key Down Syndrome gene

Researchers at the Stanford Down Syndrome
Research Center have located a gene that could
play an important role in the eventual treatment of
the genetic disorder.
"[The center] has findings that suggest that it's
really possible, in a reasonably short period of time,
to gain a functional understanding of this disorder
that will allow us to treat it someday," said School
of Medicine Prof. William Mobley, whose findings
will be published in Science magazine. "We're not
talking about cures, we're talking about treatments
that might be really effective."
Down Syndrome, which occurs when a baby has
one extra chromosome, causes a number of physio
logical maladies, such as facial deformation and
congenital heart defects, as well as a variety of de
velopmental disabilities.
People with Down Syndrome often exhibit the
same kind of brain degeneration as those sufffering
from Alzheimer's disease. As early as the age of 30,
people with the disorder experience a loss of mem
ory and logic skills, personality change and a gener
al decline in self-sufficiency.
"We know which cells get sick in a mouse model
of Down Syndrome, and what we're finding is that
a relatively limited number of genes may be re
sponsible for those neurons getting sick," Mobley
said. "If you find out what those genes are, and we
think we can, then you can intervene and stop the
problem, or at least make it not as bad."
In a normal brain, when one neuron receives a
signal from another, the receiver sends back a pro
tein known as Neuron Growth Factor. If that pro
tein never gets back to the other neuron, it be
comes sick over time, and the synapse may stop
functioning.
The protein is particularly important for spe
cific types of cells, and without it, these neurons
fail to produce the same proteins that they do nor
mally.
Down Syndrome generally prevents the protein
from reaching its target cell, but when researchers
reduced expression of a single gene, they discov
ered that the transport system was significantly re
stored.
Craig Garner, professor of psychiatry and be
havioral sciences, called Mobley's findings ground
breaking.
"[These cells are] very important for our learn
ing and memory, and in Alzheimer's, this system is
just hammered," he said. "The prediction from his
studies is that a very similar thing is happening in
Down Syndrome. That's great news, because there
are actual treatments for Alzheimer's based on
working with the [same] system."
One of the most significant as
pects of the center's research is its
potential to treat children.
"When you're young, your
brain is still very plastic, so it's not
too young to treat kids with Down
Syndrome," Mobley said. "If you
start to administer treatment to
children, you might be able to pre
vent failed operation of neural cir
cuits. Then maybe you can make
their life better, and maybe these
kids won't have learning disabili
ties, and maybe people when they
get older won't get Alzheimer's, so
I'm hopeful."
The research team included
medical and undergraduate stu
dents, in addition several research
fellows.
