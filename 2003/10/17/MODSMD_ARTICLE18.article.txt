## Commencement search begins 
### 
Graduation is more than eight
months away — though many
seniors may prefer to think it's
even further off than that — but
the nomination process for the Class of
2004's Commencement speaker has al
ready started. Through Monday, members
of the senior class can each nominate a po
tential speaker for this year's ceremony.
But there is currently no opportunity for
involvement of students not involved in
class government beyond this initial stage
of input. We believe the procedure for se
lecting this year's Commencement speak
er should be reformed to be more demo
cratic and should more accurately reflect
the preferences of the senior class.
TTris year's Commencement search will
work like this: After the Senior Class Pres
idents finish collecting nominations from
students, they will compile a list of the top
20 choices to share with University Presi
dent John Hennessy. They will also com
pile a shorter list of their top five choices
among those nominated. Then, the group
will decide upon a speaker based on the
following criteria: class interest, appropri
ateness, University affiliation and the like
lihood of acceptance.
This is a departure from last year, when
the speaker nomination procedure explicit
ly said that the final selected candidate
would be one of the students' top 10 nomi
nations. Many seniors from the Class of
2003 were still unhappy with the final
speaker selection, despite this assurance. If
the terms are to be more lax this year, we
think this could potentially result in an even

less popular speaker choice than last year.
We agree that the list of potential candi
dates suggested by seniors should be sub
jected to the collaborative screening pro
cess of President Hennessy and the Senior
Class Presidents. By doing this, a concise
list of realistic choices will be produced.
However, this list should then be returned
to the senior class for a second vote, and
this time each senior would choose. Such a
reform would help guarantee that the
Commencement speaker choice would
more accurately reflect the overall prefer
ence of the Class of 2004.
As seniors nominate speakers in the
next few days, we encourage them to
search out those who would be interesting,
informative and relevant. Seniors might
want to consider possibilities such as Bill
Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Gray Davis, Nel
son Mandela, Reese Witherspoon, Joel
Stein, Ted Koppel or Roger Ebert. Indi
viduals like these would be able to give a
unique and valuable address to the Class
of 2004.
It is not too late for the University to
adopt a more open approach to Com
mencement speaker selection. While se
niors will still nominate Commencement
candidates, voter apathy is inevitable when
the proposed selection plan contains no
guarantee of representation in later por
tions of the process. The Senior Class Pres
idents should work to ensure that seniors'
voices guide the Commencement decision
from start to finish, so that the person at the
podium in June is a speaker that satisfies
the expectations of the senior class.,
