# CDC should help out fuzzies more
## 
### 
The onset of fall quarter inevitably
entails a fresh batch of seniors
scrambling for employment after
graduation. The Career Develop
ment Center, seeking to meet the needs of
these students, has provided excellent re
sources and networking opportunities tar
geted at potential investment bankers,
consultants and technical industry work
ers. However, we believe that liberal arts
majors, who often need substantial career
assistance since their future employment
paths can be less clear-cut, have been
largely under-assisted by the Center's ser
vices in the fall.
Last week's Career Fair offered few op
portunities for non-technical or non-busi
ness-oriented students. The reason behind
this is that the Center intentionally focus
es on different areas at its various year
round career fairs. While this adds consis
tency and cohesion to each individual ca

reer fair event, the Liberal Arts Career
Fair does not occur until winter quarter,
when many internships and job slots for
liberal arts majors have already been
filled. While techie classmates have a host
of organizations standing in White Plaza
to provide them with information at the
beginning of the school year, liberal arts
students have to suffer through the anxi
eties of finding employment.
Winter quarter is too late to provide
the initial career fair for liberal arts stu
dents. The Career Development Center
needs to work harder to accommodate
earlier on the needs of liberal arts majors,
so equal job search opportunities exist for
fuzzies and techies alike. Although the
economy is currently in a downturn, fuzzy
jobs do exist — and we believe it should
be the priority of the Center to expose
such job opportunities to students as early
in the academic year as possible.
