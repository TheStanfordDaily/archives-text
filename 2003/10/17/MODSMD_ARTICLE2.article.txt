# Matt Kegel steps in and takes control

If you are surprised Washington State is atop
the conference standings and boasts a top-ten
ranking, you sure aren't alone. The Cougars
were picked to finish seventh in the preseason
conference media poll after losing three players
to the NFL and their coach to an odd quagmire.
The biggest blow, arguably, was the graduation
of quarterback Jason Gesser. The Hawaiian kid and
unquestioned leader of the resurgence in Washing
ton State football, won 24 games in three years as a
starter. He set Cougar career records for total of
fense (9,007 yards), passing (8,830 yards), and touch
down passes (70) and was the Pacific 10 Conference
Co-offensive MVP in 2002.
Obviously, new head coach Bill Doba — who
took over for the departed and later scandalized
Mike Price — had to find someone to replace the
irreplaceable.
He turned to Gesser's natural successor, fifth
year senior Matt Kegel, who had served as the
latter's backup for the last two years.
"Entering the season, Matt was sort of like a
redshirt freshman," Doba explains. "He'd been
around here for five years but hadn't gotten a
chance to start.
"I think he was our question going into the
season. But he proved to me in the spring that he
could do the job."
Now, everyone else around the Pac-10 is seeing
that Kegel can do the job. Through six games, the
burly quarterback is lll-for-200 for 1,595 yards with
10 touchdowns and only four interceptions. (As a
means of comparison, Gesser, at the same point last
year, was 115-for-192 for 1,597 yards with 13 touch
downs and four interceptions.)
Kegel's ability to step in and pick up right where
his predecessor left off is probably the best explana
tion as to why the Cougars are off to such a fast start.
Washington State is in reality one or two plays
away from being undefeated. The Cougars' only
loss was at Notre Dame — an overtime game it
could have won if Drew Dunning, considered by
many to be the best placekicker in the nation, had
converted a 34-yard chip shot. (Alternatively,
Washington State's defense blew a 19-6 lead in the
fourth quarter to a team that hadn't scored an of
fensive touchdown in over 12 quarters.)
That game seems to be a distant memory for
the Cougars, however — especially with the way
