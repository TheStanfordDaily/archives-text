# Matt Kegel steps in and takes control
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
If you are surprised Washington State is atop
the conference standings and boasts a top-ten
ranking, you sure aren't alone. The Cougars
were picked to finish seventh in the preseason
conference media poll after losing three players
to the NFL and their coach to an odd quagmire.
The biggest blow, arguably, was the graduation
of quarterback Jason Gesser. The Hawaiian kid and
unquestioned leader of the resurgence in Washing
ton State football, won 24 games in three years as a
starter. He set Cougar career records for total of
fense (9,007 yards), passing (8,830 yards), and touch
down passes (70) and was the Pacific 10 Conference
Co-offensive MVP in 2002.
Obviously, new head coach Bill Doba — who
took over for the departed and later scandalized
Mike Price — had to find someone to replace the
irreplaceable.
He turned to Gesser's natural successor, fifth
year senior Matt Kegel, who had served as the
latter's backup for the last two years.
"Entering the season, Matt was sort of like a
redshirt freshman," Doba explains. "He'd been
around here for five years but hadn't gotten a
chance to start.
"I think he was our question going into the
season. But he proved to me in the spring that he
could do the job."
Now, everyone else around the Pac-10 is seeing
that Kegel can do the job. Through six games, the
burly quarterback is lll-for-200 for 1,595 yards with
10 touchdowns and only four interceptions. (As a
means of comparison, Gesser, at the same point last
year, was 115-for-192 for 1,597 yards with 13 touch
downs and four interceptions.)
Kegel's ability to step in and pick up right where
his predecessor left off is probably the best explana
tion as to why the Cougars are off to such a fast start.
Washington State is in reality one or two plays
away from being undefeated. The Cougars' only
loss was at Notre Dame — an overtime game it
could have won if Drew Dunning, considered by
many to be the best placekicker in the nation, had
converted a 34-yard chip shot. (Alternatively,
Washington State's defense blew a 19-6 lead in the
fourth quarter to a team that hadn't scored an of
fensive touchdown in over 12 quarters.)
That game seems to be a distant memory for
the Cougars, however — especially with the way
they played in their Pac-10 opener.
Traveling to Eugene a week
after Oregon was anointed the cover
of Sports Illustrated to reward its
domination of Michigan, Washing
ton State turned the same trick on
the Ducks.
Kegel and company bewildered
Oregon early, rushing out to a 31-2
lead and finishing with a whopping
55-16 victory in a game where the
Cougars intercepted seven Duck
passes
"It was unbelievable to me,
standing right there on the sideline,"
Doba confessed.
The Washington State defense,
of course, dominated that game. But
Kegel quietly threw three touch
downs and helped steady the
Cougar offense in one of the most
hostile environments around.
At this point, it might be too early
to start comparing Kegel to Gesser,
whose consistency over the last
three years was a major staple of the
Washington State offense.
But some cannot resist.
"Jason was more of a playmaker,
scrambler and all that stuff," Doba
said. "Matt is a pocket passer [and
our quarterback coach Timm
Rosenbach] has done a great job of
getting him to stay in the pocket."
Kegel is an intimidating presence
at 6-foot-5 and 239 pounds and hails
from a very different background
(rural Idaho) than Gesser.
But even if Gesser and Kegel are
different people, Doba sees continu
ity in the leadership role played by
both.
"As soon as our bowl game was
over last year, [Matt] was in our of
fice asking how he could help out
with recruiting," Doba said. "He

took the bull by the horns and orga
nized the offseason scullies and
called defensive players to make
sure they were there."
Offensive coordinator Mike Lev
enseller has been impressed by Kegel's
ability to pick up the offense as well.
"The offense has gone as he's
gone," he said. "The more he's han
dled the ball, the more we can do.
"It shows because he doesn't
have as many questions as he once
did. He studies a lot of video and un
derstands what he's doing. He
makes us better."
The scenario in which Kegel first
comes to Palo Alto is substantially
different from Gesser's intial start at
Stanford Stadium.
Back in 2001, the Cougars trav

eled to Stanford in a game between
two undefeated teams at the top of
the conference leaderboard. At that
time, Washington State wasn't being
taken seriously by some and was
being labeled a fluke.
But it won its first game at the
Farm since 1988 as Gesser threw a
crucial touchdown pass midway
through the fourth quarter to lead
the Cougars to an improbable 45-39
victory. '
Since that game, the Cougars
have gone 19-6 and embedded them
selves in the consciousness of the na
tional football audience.
Tomorrow, Kegel brings a high
ly-regarded team to town with the
shadow of his predecessor fading
with each successive week.
