## DANIEL TELLS ALL Bush needs to drop a class or two 
### 
In the void of Axess's add and
drop deadlines, Stanford stu
dents start thinking about the
difference between ambitions
and abilities: What you want to get
done and what you can actually can
do. Perhaps you're writing your
honors thesis on Italian phe
nomenology and still think you can
complete that physics major, or in
stead you maintain hope that you
can climb a mountain of 20 units of
economic classes in one quarter.
While everything is possible, the sit
uation begs the question, "What will
be sacrificed?"
Unlike Stanford students, Pres
ident George W. Bush hasn't had
to face the finality of a drop dead
line during his presidential term.
Alternatively, his administration
has pursued what can only be de
scribed as an "add-only policy."
U.S. commitments around the
world continue to increase while
explanations of how to pay for
them shrink accordingly.
As it turns out, the battle for
Baghdad was the easy part in the
military action against Iraq. With
military abilities of Roman pro
portions and a cabinet of experts
on war making, President Bush
successfully deployed American
soldiers and removed Saddam
Hussein. But rebuilding Iraq after
the war, a lesson in"Peace Stud
ies," has proven a far more diffi
cult and expensive "class."

The $87 billion recently ap
proved by the U.S. Congress bare
ly allows for electricity and clean
water, while Americans soldiers'

lives remain in
danger on ever
more-hostile
Iraqi streets. The
Bush administra
tion's painstaking
effort to avoid
yielding control
of Iraq to the
United Nations
has provoked
questions of its

long-term motivations and has in
cited further opposition to the
United States.
Things are hardly improving.
Success in Iraq (getting an
"A") requires that the administra
tion drop both some pride and
some of the costs of reconstruc
tion by genuinely working
through the United Nations. Yet
Bush and his team continue to add
more units to their load. This
week's U.N. Security Council res
olution shows little improvement
over Bush's prior post-war at
tempt to gain UN support without
substantial U.N. involvement in
the rebuilding process. As a result
of these methods, the United
States will now retain the lion's
share of burdens in Iraq.
And Iraq is only the beginning.
With weapons of mass destruction

so conspicuously absent in the re
gion, Bush has strained to highlight,
the alternative rationale for war:
democratizing the whole of the
Middle East, one nation at a time.
Yet the increased negative nature
of. Middle Eastern sentiments to
ward the United States and the es
calating violence in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict promise only to
complicate such efforts.
"Can it be done?" is the obvi
ous question, but one that seems
absent from the White House
vernacular. In a final display of
ambition, Bush pushed through
another massive tax cut this year,
thus emptying government cof
fers and guaranteeing Congres
sional reluctance on "compas
sionate conservative" issues like
the pledged $10 billion to fight
AIDS in Africa and domestic ed
ucation initiatives.
Tough decisions require allo
cating limited resources. Al
though at times impressive, unbri
dled ambition can be a thin dis
guise for self-indulgence. While
America —or Stanford students
— may appear to have infinite ca
pacity for work, they don't. Some
times too much adding just
doesn't add up.
