## Seniors: go select your speaker 
### JOHN HENNESSY 
In the next few days, the pro
cess for suggesting Commence
ment speakers will come to a
close. I am writing to encourage
the members of our senior class to
make your opinions known to
your senior class officers.
In recent years, the selection of
the speaker has typically been
based on a few fundamental prin
ciples. The speaker should be
someone with a connection to
Stanford and with valuable per
spective to share with the recipi
ents of both undergraduate and
graduate degrees. In the past, we

have chosen Commencement
speakers who can give a com
pelling address that will enlighten
and engage graduates and their
families.
Name recognition alone does
not qualify someone as the kind of
speaker we would like to invite to
speak at Commencement. In fact,
some of the best speakers in recent
years have been people who were
not major media names, but had a
deep connection to Stanford and
an ability to impart wise insights.
When I review the unranked
list with the senior class officers, I
will take into account any strong
preferences expressed by the

class, and I will look to the class of
ficers to articulate the motivation
behind various suggestions.
Of course, I will also take into
account the relevance of the
speaker to the entire Stanford
community-including graduate
students, alumni and other Stan
ford supporters.
You are embarking on a very
exciting year and Commencement
is the capstone. I look forward to
working together with all of you to
make this a meaningful celebra
tion of your accomplishments.

John Hennessy is the president of
Stanford University.
