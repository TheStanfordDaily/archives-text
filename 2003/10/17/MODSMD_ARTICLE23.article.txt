Stanford fens should be
respectful at games
Fan behavior is always a concern
when hosting athletic events. It is a con
stant struggle to encourage passionate
and exuberant fans that enhance the ex
citement at events and create a home
field advantage while still providing a
safe, family-friendly environment for
spectators and opposing teams.
I was dismayed to read the recent
article from an Oregon State Univer
sity student writer printed in The
Daily ("Obnoxious Stanford fans,
shut up already," Oct. 16). In the arti
cle, Alex Close mentions that Stan
ford fans are probably the worst in the
Pac-10 and that Maloney Field has al
ways been known as a hostile environ
ment in which to play. If that wasn't
disappointing enough, I was appalled
to read that this past weekend Oregon
State soccer players were allegedly
subjected to taunts and derogatory
comments about two of their former
teammates who tragically passed
away last year. This is extremely dis
appointing, as I would expect better
from Stanford students. The students
responsible for this behavior should
be ashamed of themselves.
There is no place in college athlet
ics for behavior like that. What ever
happened to supporting your team
and its student-athletes in a positive
way? A home-field advantage is
gained by having a loud, boisterous
crowd supporting your team. The
other team does not need to be
ridiculed and harassed in order to ac
complish this. Stanford is better than
this. We should be encouraging our
own rather than belittling others.
I appeal to Stanford students' bet
ter judgment in helping create a more
positive family-friendly environment
at Stanford's sporting events. To those
few delinquents who verbally attack

the visiting team and give Stanford a
bad name, please refrain from making
fools of yourselves. To all others, don't
encourage or condone this activity. I
ask you to alert Stanford game man
agement personnel of anyone using
profanity or verbally attacking a visit
ing team or player. These people are
not welcome at Stanford athletic
events and will be asked to leave.
Don't let a few misguided individuals
tarnish the reputation of Stanford
University, the Athletic Department
and in this case, the men's soccer team.

The Daily did not represent all
the fects in MEChA article

I am writing in response to the arti
cle about MEChA ("MEChA Upset
at KKK Comparison by The Review,"
Oct. 16). I am not a conservative or lib
eral interested in picking sides; I am
merely a student concerned with the
practice of fair journalism. The Daily
ommited the fact that MEChA re
fused an interview with The Review. If
the Daily had mentioned this, the de
bate would have been viewed in a far
different light. The Review may have
misinterpreted MEChA's founding
principles, but without an interview,
how was The Review expected to fully
understand MEChA's principles?

The Review went overboard on
its KKK comparison
The Stanford Review's editorial
on MEChA is a perfect example of
how poor writing can dilute an other

wise fair and reasonable point.
To their credit, The Review's edi
torial board goes to painstaking
lengths to make clear it doesn't wish
to ban MEChA from campus nor
condemn the members who see it
merely as a social advocacy group.
They only wish MEChA to renounce
racism. However, the KKK was a cal
lous and inaccurate point of compari
son. To millions of African-Ameri
cans, Jews, Catholics and immigrants,
the KKK represented and continues
to represent hate in its most violent
and repugnant form. Even if I accept
the argument that MEChA's history
is rooted in racism — a serious accu
sation — that doesn't make them the
moral equivalent of terrorists, which
even The Review must admit is exact
ly what the KKK amounts to: a do
mestic version of al-Qaeda.
The Review tries to weave in a de
bunking of the common wisdom sur
rounding the KKK, arguing that
they've changed. I hope you'll excuse
this "papist" if he remains skeptical. I
suspect that given the amount of
space The Review devotes to equivo
cating their KKK analogy, even the
editors knew the comparison wasn't
working. They published the piece
anyway. Maybe they should have
shifted the rhetoric to a less loaded
racist organization, such as the CCC.
Or maybe they should have just
dropped the device altogether.
The Review's argument is worth
debating on its merits, but it gets buried
in an editorial too weighed down in
emotional and historical baggage. I
don't know if the editors made an hon
est mistake at incisive analysis or were
crafting a shock piece from the start.
What I do know is that they lost at least
person who was willing to listen.
