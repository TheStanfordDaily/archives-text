# Thief steals iPod, Xbox during EBF happy hour

### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
An Apple iPod and a Microsoft
Xbox, valued at $510 collectively,
were stolen from a student's first
floor room in Enchanted Broccoli
Forest late Wednesday night during
the dorm's weekly "Happy Wednes
day" social. Police say that someone
cut open the window screen to enter
the room.
"This was an isolated incident, as
far as we know," said Lt. Hilary
Karp, who is handling the case. "We
haven't had any series of burglaries
at this house."
The student, senior Juan
Sanchez, said that the burglary oc
curred sometime between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:30 a.m. while he was hanging
out with his friends.
"[The culprit] threw my monitor
on the ground but failed to even
touch the CPU," Sanchez said.
"Looking at what they tried but
failed to take, these people were ob

viously idiots. However, the loss of
the X-Box has sapped the spirit of
[Sanchez's draw group]."
Hilary described the incident as a
"crime of opportunity," in that the
room's window was open and the cul
prit had an easy way in. The police
have no leads in the case, and Sanchez
could not think of anyone who might
have committed the crime.
"There isn't a whole lot we can
do, especially when there are no pat
terns and when there was a party that
attracted a lot of unassociated peo
ple to the house," Karp said. "But
students should always lock their
doors and close their windows when
they leave their rooms."
Sanchez had his own warnings.
"It appears that they cut their way
in with a knife or another sharp ob
ject," he said. "I was only out of my
room for an hour - what if one of us
had come in 25 minutes earlier?
Everyone should keep these kinds of
things in mind, especially if you're
living on the first floor."
