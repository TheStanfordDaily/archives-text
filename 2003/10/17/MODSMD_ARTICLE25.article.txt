# SPORTS
## Offthe field and in high demand 
### 
For those of you who think sports is
actually about sports, you
shouldn't be reading columns any
way. Go read the stats.
Who really cares about sports? The
front page of the sports section makes me
wonder about the state of sports today.
Here's a sampling of recent stories:
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez beat
up a 72-year-old bench coach; Kobe's
doomed to sullied infamy because he did
something sexual with some chick; and
Arnold is California's new governor. But
wait, we want the details: Martinez threw
the dude to the ground by his head,
Bryant (allegedly) asked the girl to (re
portedly) kiss his (so-described) penis
after the (consensual / assault) encounter
and didn't Arnold do something offensive
to womankind?
Wait, am I being too vulgar? This sh**

sells, and if you person
ally think you're above
it, then stop reading The
National Enquirer and
Us Weekly and People.
The public doesn't
remember stats, only
the sports fanatics who
read them do. The pub
lic does remember that
Magic has HIV, Lou

Gherig was gay and Jacko (that's Enquir
er-speak for Michael Jackson) likes Peter
Pan. All the other players played and did
sports stuff. Tonya Harding whacked
Nancy Kerrigan in the knee, and.. .oh
yeah, they competed in the Olympics too.
In the spirit of assigning arbitrary dec
imal points to figure skating and other art
forms, and to all that is entertaining in the
sports world, here are three theories on
the football drama triangle that is Buddy,
Trent Edwards and Chris Lewis. I wonder
would we be having any drama if the game
were objective?

Theory No. 1: Buddy rolls into Stan
ford last year on the wings of his big "fun
'n' gun" offensive strategy, packing in the
receivers and throwing, throwing, throw
ing. The previously rock solid offense,
with almost the same lineup, is still per
forming, but certainly not well. If we had
to knock one person out of the equation
to explain why things didn't add up, it may
as well be the thrower. Buddy maintains
his offensive claim to fame and replaces
the quarterback. Oh, wait, it's a running
team now, so Trent is excused.

That's funny, because the equation is still
not adding up and the Cardinal is 0-2 in
Conference games. Either Lewis is playing
scapegoat to Teevens's frustrations, or he
just can't throw anymore, but not like we'd
know anyway since he gets no playing time.
Theory No. 2: Teevens doesn't like
Lewis. Take your pick: bad attitude, trou
ble-maker, authority dynamics, projec
tion of Buddy's Jungian shadow compo
nent. Besides, Teevens finished off Ed
wards's recruiting courtship when Tyrone
Willingham took off before the letter of
intent got signed.
Maybe Teevens likes Edwards, then.
Of course, at least we know T-Dub would
have played Lewis. He made it clear that
you pay your dues and come into rewards,
like when Randy Fasani started after it
was already established that Lewis was
performing better. Lewis paid his dues
and hasn't reaped, kind of like when we
blow hundreds of dollars at the Bookstore
for course readers we never touch. Or like
when the Stanford law enforcement ex
tracted over $1.5 million in parking cita
tions last year, then forked over all the
revenue to Santa Clara County.
Theory No. 3: Teevens understands
the college game. His stats are not looking
good, and he may very well get canned
after a second losing season. This is bad,
bad news. He can play the younger guys
and build up the image that the team's
bright future is in his hands, so we should
all stay loyally tuned in for next season
and keep him on board.
Teevens didn't create Lewis, but Freud
did not invent the unconscious and I did
not invent these theories - you can still
use them to get you places, like winning.
Or you can take too long.
Sounds like our triangle drama affair is
in for some more interesting episodes.
Will Lewis fade out completely from the
field and newspaper articles? Will
Teevens, on thin ice and desperate, break
loyalties and just play the guy? Will Ed
wards ever get sick of everyone hating on
him, and, I don't know, deface a locker?
In the meantime, follow the game if
that's your thing, or do like the rest of us
and follow all the things that you
shouldn't care about but do, like why
Roy's tigers slept in bed with him and
what color vests Kobe's bodyguards have
this season.
Khaki, my readers, khaki.
