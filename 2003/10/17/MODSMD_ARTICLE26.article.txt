# Card mounts comeback
## Volleyball avoids Bruin sweep at Maples Pavilion 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Down two games to zero and trailing No. 11
UCLA 25-27 in game three, things didn't look to
good for the No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
team.
Stanford, however, had not been swept at
home since Sept. 2000 and was not about to let
that streak end tonight at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal came back from the two-point deficit
and took the game on a block by senior Jennifer
Harvey and sophomore Katie Goldhahn.
The Cardinal then carried the momentum
from game three and shocked the Bruins (13-4,6-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) as it stole a match that
seemed to be within UCLA's grasp.
This was a huge win for Stanford, which was
not only coming off a surprising loss to California
last Saturday, but is also facing No. 1 USC
tonight. A loss tonight to the Bruins — especial
ly its first sweep at home in three years — on top
of the loss to the Golden Bears, could have taken
the wind out of the Cardinal's sails as it came onto
the floor against the defending national champi
on Trojans.
"I'm on such a high and everything just
seemed to go so fast," said junior Jennifer Hucke
who played right side for the Cardinal tonight.
"We stuck together and pulled out the win. Be
tween games two and three we just told each
other that we weren't going to lose in three games
or four games and that this is exactly what we
practice for. So we knew that we could do it."
In addition to being lifted by the exhilara
tion of this come from behind victory over the
Bruins, Stanford will have the memory of its
loss to USC in last year's NCAA finals to moti
vate itself tonight. It was Dec. 21 of last year
when the Trojans defeated the Cardinal 3-1 in
New Orleans to end Stanford's hopes of back
to-back championships.
Throwing a slight kick in Stanford's spirit —
both tonight and last night — is a foot injury to
senior middle blocker Sara McGee, who has been
very dependable both on offense and defense for
the Cardinal this year. Last night, the Cardinal
worked past that injury, and adapted to the shuf
fling of players as senior Sara Dukes stepped up
to fill in for McGee in the middle and Hucke con
trolled the right side.

"Sara Dukes did a great job in the middle and
it felt natural for me to go back to the right side,"
Hucke said. "I think this win is really going to
help us a lot against USC because now, even
though we have a new lineup, we know that we
can win as long as we stay motivated and don't let
ourselves get down."

In addition to the changes in the lineup, one of
the biggest differences between the Cardinal
team tonight and the team that came out against
Cal was on defense. Stanford, which was out dug
by the Golden Bears, did the same to UCLA with
85 digs to the Bruins 76. Moreover, Stanford had
five players with double-digit digs, including
freshman outside hitter Kristin Richards, who led

the team with 18.
The Stanford offense, on the
other hand, was slow to warm up last
night, as Stanford's two outside hit
ters, junior Ogonna Nnamani and
freshman Kristin Richards hit .037
and .000 in games one and two, re
spectively.
The two hitters showed their
strength, however, as Nnamani
picked up her game to end the match
with 25 kills and a .181 hitting per
centage. Richards —in addition to
her 18 digs — had 17 kills and a .190
hitting percentage. Harvey added to
the Cardinal offense from the mid
dle with 11 kills and a .381 hitting
percentage — the highest of any
Cardinal hitter on the night and was
only beaten by senior setter Anna
Robinson who hit .400 with two kills.
Tonight, however, the Cardinal
has no room for a lethargic offense
against the dangerous Trojans.
Stanford already has quite a task
in front of itself as the Trojans have
yet to drop a match this season with
a 16-0 mark (7-0 Pac-10), including
four wins over ranked opponents.
Last year in the regular season,
Stanford and USC split their
matches with both going to five
games and each team winning on
the other's home floor.
Stanford will be looking to
change that pattern as the Trojans
come to the Farm for the first time
since the Cardinal's loss to USC in
the NCAA Championship last
season.
"Its always hard not to have a
practice day between games, espe
cially this time because UCLA and
USC are both such good teams,"
Nnamani said.
"We always think about one
game at a time, but we know that
both of these will be tough matches
and we have an extra incentive
against USC because of what hap
pened last year - ldsing to someone
in the finals is just something that
you don't forget."

Down two games to zero and trailing No. 11
UCLA 25-27 in game three, things didn't look to
good for the No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
team.
Stanford, however, had not been swept at
home since Sept. 2000 and was not about to let
that streak end tonight at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal came back from the two-point deficit
and took the game on a block by senior Jennifer
Harvey and sophomore Katie Goldhahn.
The Cardinal then carried the momentum
from game three and shocked the Bruins (13-4,6-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) as it stole a match that
seemed to be within UCLA's grasp.
This was a huge win for Stanford, which was
not only coming off a surprising loss to California
last Saturday, but is also facing No. 1 USC
tonight. A loss tonight to the Bruins — especial
ly its first sweep at home in three years — on top
of the loss to the Golden Bears, could have taken
the wind out of the Cardinal's sails as it came onto
the floor against the defending national champi
on Trojans.
"I'm on such a high and everything just
seemed to go so fast," said junior Jennifer Hucke
who played right side for the Cardinal tonight.
"We stuck together and pulled out the win. Be
tween games two and three we just told each
other that we weren't going to lose in three games
or four games and that this is exactly what we
practice for. So we knew that we could do it."
In addition to being lifted by the exhilara
tion of this come from behind victory over the
Bruins, Stanford will have the memory of its
loss to USC in last year's NCAA finals to moti
vate itself tonight. It was Dec. 21 of last year
when the Trojans defeated the Cardinal 3-1 in
New Orleans to end Stanford's hopes of back
to-back championships.
Throwing a slight kick in Stanford's spirit —
both tonight and last night — is a foot injury to
senior middle blocker Sara McGee, who has been
very dependable both on offense and defense for
the Cardinal this year. Last night, the Cardinal
worked past that injury, and adapted to the shuf
fling of players as senior Sara Dukes stepped up
to fill in for McGee in the middle and Hucke con
trolled the right side.

"Sara Dukes did a great job in the middle and
it felt natural for me to go back to the right side,"
Hucke said. "I think this win is really going to
help us a lot against USC because now, even
though we have a new lineup, we know that we
can win as long as we stay motivated and don't let
ourselves get down."

In addition to the changes in the lineup, one of
the biggest differences between the Cardinal
team tonight and the team that came out against
Cal was on defense. Stanford, which was out dug
by the Golden Bears, did the same to UCLA with
85 digs to the Bruins 76. Moreover, Stanford had
five players with double-digit digs, including
freshman outside hitter Kristin Richards, who led

the team with 18.
The Stanford offense, on the
other hand, was slow to warm up last
night, as Stanford's two outside hit
ters, junior Ogonna Nnamani and
freshman Kristin Richards hit .037
and .000 in games one and two, re
spectively.
The two hitters showed their
strength, however, as Nnamani
picked up her game to end the match
with 25 kills and a .181 hitting per
centage. Richards —in addition to
her 18 digs — had 17 kills and a .190
hitting percentage. Harvey added to
the Cardinal offense from the mid
dle with 11 kills and a .381 hitting
percentage — the highest of any
Cardinal hitter on the night and was
only beaten by senior setter Anna
Robinson who hit .400 with two kills.
Tonight, however, the Cardinal
has no room for a lethargic offense
against the dangerous Trojans.
Stanford already has quite a task
in front of itself as the Trojans have
yet to drop a match this season with
a 16-0 mark (7-0 Pac-10), including
four wins over ranked opponents.
Last year in the regular season,
Stanford and USC split their
matches with both going to five
games and each team winning on
the other's home floor.
Stanford will be looking to
change that pattern as the Trojans
come to the Farm for the first time
since the Cardinal's loss to USC in
the NCAA Championship last
season.
"Its always hard not to have a
practice day between games, espe
cially this time because UCLA and
USC are both such good teams,"
Nnamani said.
"We always think about one
game at a time, but we know that
both of these will be tough matches
and we have an extra incentive
against USC because of what hap
pened last year - ldsing to someone
in the finals is just something that
you don't forget."
