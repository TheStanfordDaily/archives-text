# Soccer seeks to avenge NCAA loss
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Dec. 15,2002: Stanford men's soccer lost to UCLA, 1-0 in the
NCAA title game.
Nov. 10,2002: The Cardinal lost to UCLA, 1-0.
Oct. 18,2002: Stanford lost to UCLA, 1-0 in overtime.
In fact, you would have to go back to Oct. 8,2000 to find a Car
dinal win over the Bruins and back to four matchups before that
to find a Stanford / UCLA game decided by more than one goal.
Senior co-captain Abe Geiger summarized the rivalry best
when he joked: "There is a giant burr in our butts that is UCLA."
Top-ranked defending national champion UCLA has been a
competitive burden to most of the teams in the NCAA this season
on the way to a 10-1-0,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference record. The Bru
ins' one loss this year came in a 1-0 meeting with now-No. 2 Mary
land in early September.
So when the Cardinal (2-8-2, 0-3-0 Pac-10) travels down to
Los Angeles for a faceoff on Sunday, it will have quite a job
ahead of it.
"I think we're a little nervous," said freshman midfielder Bret
Shimizii. "It's not only a rivalry but it's our biggest game of the
year.
"Confidence-wise we know we can play as a team. But also I'm
going to be thinking, 'How am I going to be able to contribute to
that?"'
The Cardinal will have to find a way around UCLA's biggest
strength: its bench. Twenty Bruins have started at least once this
season and 13 have started at least six games. UCLA also is known
for an unbreakable defense that makes building offensive charges
a challenge for opponents.
Stanford also still has a lineup in limbo. While senior Mike Wil
son and junior goalkeeper Robby Fulton have returned to action
for the Cardinal, junior forward Matt Janusz has not yet been
given the "OK" to take the field this weekend.
But Stanford head coach Bret Simon believes that the experi
ences that the Cardinal has collected over the course of the season
will allow them to play better this weekend, both against UCLA
on Saturday and against Fresno State (8-3-0,0-3-0 Pac-10) on Fri
day.
"We've played very well. We're gaining great composure and

Junior forward Darren Fernandez has notched two goals this season. Stanford will need his best efforts when it takes on
the defending national champion Bruins on Sunday in Los Angeles.
making some real progress," Simon
said. "And to the players' credit,
they haven't given up on each
other."
While Stanford prepares rigor
ously for the weekend's tough
games, UCLA is working just as
hard.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal
is not a ranked team, the matchup is
anything but trivial for the Bruins,
according to UCLA head coach
Tom Fitzgerald.
"[Stanford] has the toughest
schedule in the country.. .and we
know they're much better than their
record," Fitzgerald said. "And hav
ing the toughest schedule in the
country can really prepare you for
big games like this one."
But before Stanford can avenge
its series of losses to UCLA, it will
have to face the Bulldogs in Fres
no, and considering that the last
meeting of the two teams ended in
a 0-0 tie, Friday night will certainly
be a challenge.
In addition to the fact that the
Bulldogs' stadium is a historically
tough place to play, Fresno returns
many of its players from last season.
"Veterans tend to find wins in
these close games," Simon said.
"And young players like ours tend to
get exploited a little bit.
"So we are taking this all game by
game. The biggest thing will be to
gain confidence and the way to do
that is by winning Friday night."
And once Stanford leaves Fres
no, it can concentrate on the battle
with UCLA.
"It's been a frustrating season,"
Geiger said. "But a big win this
weekend could turn that around."
Fitzgerald agrees Stanford can
keep its playoff hopes alive if the
Cardinal can pickup two wins this
weekend. However, the squad has a
2-28-4 record against the Bruins.
Then again, as Geiger will tell
you, "The records are getting
thrown out the window for this one."
The Cardinal will meet Fresno
State Friday evening at 7 p.m. before
Sunday's 1 p.m. faceoff against
UCLA at Drake Stadium. The
Bruin matchup will be televised on a
delayed basis on Monday, Oct. 20 at
7 p.m. on College Sports TV.
