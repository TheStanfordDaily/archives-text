# Soccer seeks to avenge NCAA loss
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Dec. 15,2002: Stanford men's soccer lost to UCLA, 1-0 in the
NCAA title game.
Nov. 10,2002: The Cardinal lost to UCLA, 1-0.
Oct. 18,2002: Stanford lost to UCLA, 1-0 in overtime.
In fact, you would have to go back to Oct. 8,2000 to find a Car
dinal win over the Bruins and back to four matchups before that
to find a Stanford / UCLA game decided by more than one goal.
Senior co-captain Abe Geiger summarized the rivalry best
when he joked: "There is a giant burr in our butts that is UCLA."
Top-ranked defending national champion UCLA has been a
competitive burden to most of the teams in the NCAA this season
on the way to a 10-1-0,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference record. The Bru
ins' one loss this year came in a 1-0 meeting with now-No. 2 Mary
land in early September.
So when the Cardinal (2-8-2, 0-3-0 Pac-10) travels down to
Los Angeles for a faceoff on Sunday, it will have quite a job
ahead of it.
"I think we're a little nervous," said freshman midfielder Bret
Shimizii. "It's not only a rivalry but it's our biggest game of the
year.
"Confidence-wise we know we can play as a team. But also I'm
going to be thinking, 'How am I going to be able to contribute to
that?"'
The Cardinal will have to find a way around UCLA's biggest
strength: its bench. Twenty Bruins have started at least once this
season and 13 have started at least six games. UCLA also is known
for an unbreakable defense that makes building offensive charges
a challenge for opponents.
Stanford also still has a lineup in limbo. While senior Mike Wil
son and junior goalkeeper Robby Fulton have returned to action
for the Cardinal, junior forward Matt Janusz has not yet been
given the "OK" to take the field this weekend.
But Stanford head coach Bret Simon believes that the experi
ences that the Cardinal has collected over the course of the season
will allow them to play better this weekend, both against UCLA
on Saturday and against Fresno State (8-3-0,0-3-0 Pac-10) on Fri
day.
"We've played very well. We're gaining great composure and

Junior forward Darren Fernandez has notched two goals this season. Stanford will need his best efforts when it takes on
the defending national champion Bruins on Sunday in Los Angeles.
