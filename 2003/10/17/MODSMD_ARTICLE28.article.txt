# CORKERY FINDS NCAA SUCCESS
## Shoulder injury forces No. 1 seed to withdraw from Omni Hotel Regionals 
### KAIYA REEVE 
There are not many people who can boast
that they've met their sports hero, that lofty
being who seems to outplay and outscore every
opponent thrown at him.
But when Stanford sophomore K.C. Cork
ery had the opportunity to meet his idol, profes
sional tennis player Paul Goldstein, Corkery
certainly didn't do what the typical fan would do.
There was no autograph-seeking, no re
quests for pictures.
Instead Corkery trounced his No. 1 seeded
opponent and idol64,64in the quarterfinals of
the USTA Men's $15,000 Pro Tournament in
October 2001.
Yes, he is that good.
Corkery, a sophomore, is coming off a 2003
campaign where he earned both All-American
and Pacific-10 Freshman of the Year Honors
while posting a 21-1 record.
He has built up a more prestigious resume
during his freshman year than many players
could dream of putting together throughout
their entire collegiate career.
Looking at this impressive array of ac
complishments, it is easy to assume that all of
the attention might inflate his ego. However,
this is clearly not the case.
At best, he is accepting of his talent on the
court and humble in character.
"I always wanted to go to Stanford, but I
never in all honesty thought I'd be good enough
to come here," said Corkery. "I wasn't recruited
very highly by anyone."
Clearly, Corkery has proved himself to be
more than capable of competing at the Division
I level.
"He is definitely one of the top players in the
country, there is no question in my mind," said
associate head coach John Whitlinger. "He is no
doubt capable of winning NCAA Champi
onships."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould agreed.
"He has unlimited potential," Gould
added. "In my 38 years [at Stanford] there are
probably only two or three players I've had
who have had as good of an understanding of
the game and of what's going on during the
match as K.C."

A versatile player, Corkery isn't reliant on
just one stroke or strategy.
"I think of myself as an all court player. I try
to serve and volley a lot and I feel comfortable
playing baseline as well. I just try to mix things
up," Corkery said.
"My serve is my biggest weapon. I pride my
self in not having too many weaknesses and I
like to be able to do just about everything."
Not only is he a superb singles player, but
Corkery is also making his mark as a prominent
doubles competitor.
Paired with fellow Cardinal standout James
Pade, they began the preseason last year un
ranked. By midseason in January, they had shot
up to No. 9 in the rankings.
"I've played more singles but I really enjoy
playing doubles, especially since I've been here
at Stanford," Corkery said. "I really enjoy play
ing with Pade and we've had lots of success to
gether."
On Friday, the men's tennis team will see
tournament action in Eugene, Ore., where they
will compete in the Omni Hotels Regional
Championship.
The winners of the event will then be able
to play in the Omni Hotels National Indoor
Championship in Ann Arbor, Mich, on Nov.
6-9.
At last year's Regional Championship, the
dynamic duo of Corkery and Pade battled
with fellow Stanford teammates Carter Mor
ris and Sam Warburg during the finals, over
coming them 8-5 and taking home the cham
pionship trophy.
Unfortunately, there is no chance for a re
peat win this year, due to the shoulder injury that
keeps Corkery from his normal serving
prowess.
Instead he will have to cheer on his eight
teammates from the sidelines after the injury
forced the No. 1 seed to withdraw from the tour
nament.
The timetable for Corkery's return is uncer
tain, but the sophomore hopes to heal quickly so
he will be able to rejoin the team.
"I'm just happy to be on the team," Cork
ery said.
"I think after my year off from playing, a
lot of people thought I should stay out and
play professionally, but I did not want to
miss the opportunity of coming to Stan
ford."
While this upcoming tournament might not
be in Corkery,s schedule anymore, it is safe to
say that Stanford will always welcome him back
to the courts.
