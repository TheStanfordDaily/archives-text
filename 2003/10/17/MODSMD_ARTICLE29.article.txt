# Women square off against L.A. schools

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Up to this point the Stanford women's soc
cer team (6-6-1,1-1 Pacific 10 Conference) has
had a frustrating season filled with devastating
injuries and disappointing losses. Consequent
ly, the Cardinal will be a heavy underdog when
it faces No. 3 UCLA (9-1-2, 2-0) at Maloney
Field tonight at 7 p.m.
But when a rivalry is as fierce as the current
Cardinal-Bruin one, none of that matters.
"You throw out all the rankings when it
comes to games like this," senior tri-captain
Ally Marquand said. "It's going to be a battle."
Stanford posts an all-time 5-5-1 record
against UCLA, reflecting just how evenly
matched the teams have been over the years.
However, the Cardinal has gotten the best
of the Bruins in recent years, posting a 3-1
record in its last four contests, including a 6-0
whipping in 1999.
Stanford has struggled to score all season
long and with UCLA's staunch defense,
tonight will be no different.
"We don't really have a natural goal-scor
er," Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said.
"Someone's going to have to get hot and we
need to start catching some breaks. Neither of
those things has happened yet."
It's possible that the Cardinal offense could
be even less effective this weekend as Mar
quand, its leading scorer, has been experienc
ing soreness in her left knee since she twisted it
in last weekend's loss to No. 24 Arizona State
(8-2-2,2-0).
The midfielder has been sitting on the side
lines during this week's practices, but she will
most likely be available for this weekend.
Even with Marquand at full strength, the
Cardinal will have its work cut out for itself
tonight. Not only have the Bruins suffered only
one loss, they have won games against strong
teams.
UCLA has faced four ranked opponents,
posting a 2-1-1 record with its only loss coming
to top-ranked North Carolina (14-0), the heavy
favorite to take home the national title.
Offensively, the Bruins are led by the senior
duo of midfielder Whitney Jones and forward
Sarah-Gayle Swanson who lead the team with
five goals apiece.
The Cardinal defense will also have to con
tend with the recent hot streak of sophomore
forward Iris Mora.
This week Mora was named to Soccer
America's Team of the Week after scoring
seven points on two goals and three assists in
UCLA's victories over San Diego, Washing
ton and Washington State.
UCLA plays a dominant possession game
and has outshot its opponents 254-67 this year.
This is bad news for the Cardinal who have had

little success getting the ball near the goal
against top teams and even less success finding
the back of the net.
Stanford's most recent offensive explosion
came against Arizona on a hat trick by Mar
quand, but according to Ratcliffe, such an im
pressive individual effort is unlikely to occur
again.
"Ally's play was great that game, but realis
tically we can't hope for that every night," Rat
cliffe said. "We have to spread the ball around
and for the most part it's going to be a few dif
ferent people stepping up to score a goal."
While Friday's matchup will undoubted
ly be tough, the Cardinal does have at least

one thing working in its favor: it has finally
established a consistent starting lineup as
several players have recently returned from
injury.
"The whole team has gotten really beat up
this season," Marquand said. "We've had a lot
of injuries and we're finally all back and at least
kind of healthy."
Sophomore left back Hayley Hunt re
turned to the Cardinal lineup against Arizona
and already looks to play an important role in
the defense.
The Cardinal will follow up Friday's contest
with UCLA with another tough conference
clash on Sunday at 1 p.m. against Southern Cal

ifornia (5-4-4,1-0-1).
The Women of Troy boast a strong defense,
led by junior goalkeeper Julie Peterson who
has tallied 37 saves on her way to five shutouts.
Offensively, it has been a freshman who has
kept USC going. Rosa Anna Tantillo has
recorded a team-high six goals including a re
cent game-winner against Washington State.
With only seven regular season matches left
the outcome of this weekend's games become
particularly important for the Cardinal's
chances at a playoff berth.
"We will have to bring our top game this
weekend," Ratcliffe said. "Not just against
UCLA, but USC will be really tough as well."

Junior midfielder Amy Grady wins the ball in an early-season b attle. Grady and the Cardinal will need their A-game tonight when they take
on third-ranked UCLA. The struggling Cardinal offense will need to find a way to score against a staunch UCLA defense.
