# MORTON GIVES TOUGH LOVE
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Cardinal offensive line is the
youngest in the Pacific 10 Conference, but
offensive line coach Steve Morton doesn't
mind so much.
"I'm almost 50 years old, but I know
rap music and I can go clubbing," Morton
joked. "I love these guys. I mean, they
make me tear my hair out, what I have left
of it, but that's okay. I love what I do."
Morton, who came to Stanford last year
as part of head coach Buddy Teevens' staff,
has a wealth of experience, having coached
almost 30 years for big-time programs like
Washington State, Washington and South
ern California. But he didn't come to Stan
ford with a Hollywood attitude.
"A coach once told me, 'The big time is
where your feet are,' " Morton said. "So if
you're at West Junior High somewhere
and you're coaching, that's big time. If you
have that attitude, things will take care of
themselves."
Morton doesn't want a big-time atti
tude from his players, either.
"This is what I told the guys two years
ago when I came here," he said. "I'm im
pressed with your four-digit SAT scores,
but you're being coached by a three-digit
guy. All you've got to do is hit somebody.
I said, 'This game was made by P.E. majors
for P.E. majors. And that doesn't mean
petroleum engineer.'"
The players, for their part, have been
receptive to Morton's approach.
"Morton's awesome," said senior left
tackle Kirk Chambers. "He's a great
coach with fundamentals . . . he'll get on
our case when it needs to happen, and
we understand that. It's part of the
coach-player relationship."
Given that approximately half of the
Cardinal roster is made up of true or red
shirt freshmen, the Stanford coaching staff
has had to learn how to be patient.
"Each game is an adventure, each ad
venture is new, and each one is a learning
process," Morton said. "They're young,
they're not as strong as the guys across
from them, they're inexperienced. Some
times they have to be coached through
things that a year from now they'll catch
on their own."
Opposing defenses, all too aware of
the o-line's youth, don't make things any

easier.
"I mean, teams blitz us getting off the
bus for pre-game warm-ups," Morton
said.
Despite its unique age makeup, the o
line has become a close-knit group off
the field.
"We get to together every Thursday
night and have a dinner and watch the
ESPN Thursday night game, and kind of
bond in that way," Chambers said. "It's
kind of different because there's a lot of
youth there, but you just make that effort
to reach out and create that bond."

Senior center Drew Caylor explained
the group's closeness.
"The o-line, you know, we're all fat
guys, we don't exactly get the girls, so we
tend to just bond as a group," he joked.
Offensive linemen are entrusted with
protecting their quarterback on the field,
and it's a duty the Cardinal doesn't take
lightly, even when it's struggling.
"They're going to get their hits on
your quarterback, and you try to avoid
those, but once it gets kind of out of line,
you have to take care of that," Chambers
said. "You say, hey, if you guys get a

chance to cut this guy or some
thing . . . but we're not going to be cheap
out there, we're not going to go out and
chop block a guy."
Morton tries to foster this kind of
proactive attitude.
"You appeal to them," he said. "You
know, what are you going to be doing 20
years from now when you're in a sales
meeting? Are you going to sit with your
feet up on the desk and not work hard?
You're setting habits right now, so you

better get your job done."
Morton knows a lot of the habits
of Washington State and the other
Pacific 10 Conference teams, hav
ing played and coached in the Pac
10 for the better part of three
decades.
Morton lettered at Washington
State as a center in 1973-74, and then
coached the offensive line there
1975-1986, before returning to the
Apple State to coach Washington's
o-line 1992-1998.
Teevens believes the line is head
ed in the right direction, and his
players are believers, too.
"We've seen the strength and
athleticism of our young guys on the
offensive line," he said. "I think they

understood what happened [against
USC]... They had kind of a wide
eyed response, and I don't think
we'll see that again."
Caylor is excited by the potential
offered by so much youth.
"I've experienced a lot of suc
cess here, obviously under the old
coaching staff, and I firmly believe
we will under this coaching staff,"
he said.
"It's very exciting to see what's
going on, there's so much young
talent out here."
Morton admits working with so
many inexperienced players has
been exasperating at times, but he
thinks they're getting the picture.
"I'm mad at them most of the
time," he said, pausing. "Not at
them, but what they do. It's like your
parents: 'We love you. But what you
just did was stupid. So let's fix that.'

on their own."
Opposing defenses, all too aware of
the o-line's youth, don't make things any

easier.
"I mean, teams blitz us getting off the
bus for pre-game warm-ups," Morton
said.
Despite its unique age makeup, the o
line has become a close-knit group off
the field.
"We get to together every Thursday
night and have a dinner and watch the
ESPN Thursday night game, and kind of
bond in that way," Chambers said. "It's
kind of different because there's a lot of
youth there, but you just make that effort
to reach out and create that bond."

Senior center Drew Caylor explained
the group's closeness.
"The o-line, you know, we're all fat
guys, we don't exactly get the girls, so we
tend to just bond as a group," he joked.
Offensive linemen are entrusted with
protecting their quarterback on the field,
and it's a duty the Cardinal doesn't take
lightly, even when it's struggling.
"They're going to get their hits on
your quarterback, and you try to avoid
those, but once it gets kind of out of line,
you have to take care of that," Chambers
said. "You say, hey, if you guys get a

chance to cut this guy or some
thing . . . but we're not going to be cheap
out there, we're not going to go out and
chop block a guy."
Morton tries to foster this kind of
proactive attitude.
"You appeal to them," he said. "You
know, what are you going to be doing 20
years from now when you're in a sales
meeting? Are you going to sit with your
feet up on the desk and not work hard?
You're setting habits right now, so you

better get your job done."
Morton knows a lot of the habits
of Washington State and the other
Pacific 10 Conference teams, hav
ing played and coached in the Pac
10 for the better part of three
decades.
Morton lettered at Washington
State as a center in 1973-74, and then
coached the offensive line there
1975-1986, before returning to the
Apple State to coach Washington's
o-line 1992-1998.
Teevens believes the line is head
ed in the right direction, and his
players are believers, too.
"We've seen the strength and
athleticism of our young guys on the
offensive line," he said. "I think they

understood what happened [against
USC]... They had kind of a wide
eyed response, and I don't think
we'll see that again."
Caylor is excited by the potential
offered by so much youth.
"I've experienced a lot of suc
cess here, obviously under the old
coaching staff, and I firmly believe
we will under this coaching staff,"
he said.
"It's very exciting to see what's
going on, there's so much young
talent out here."
Morton admits working with so
many inexperienced players has
been exasperating at times, but he
thinks they're getting the picture.
"I'm mad at them most of the
time," he said, pausing. "Not at
them, but what they do. It's like your
parents: 'We love you. But what you
just did was stupid. So let's fix that.'
That's coaching."
The Cardinal offensive line is the
youngest in the Pacific 10 Conference, but
offensive line coach Steve Morton doesn't
mind so much.
"I'm almost 50 years old, but I know
rap music and I can go clubbing," Morton
joked. "I love these guys. I mean, they
make me tear my hair out, what I have left
of it, but that's okay. I love what I do."
Morton, who came to Stanford last year
as part of head coach Buddy Teevens' staff,
has a wealth of experience, having coached
almost 30 years for big-time programs like
Washington State, Washington and South
ern California. But he didn't come to Stan
ford with a Hollywood attitude.
"A coach once told me, 'The big time is
where your feet are,' " Morton said. "So if
you're at West Junior High somewhere
and you're coaching, that's big time. If you
have that attitude, things will take care of
themselves."
Morton doesn't want a big-time atti
tude from his players, either.
"This is what I told the guys two years
ago when I came here," he said. "I'm im
pressed with your four-digit SAT scores,
but you're being coached by a three-digit
guy. All you've got to do is hit somebody.
I said, 'This game was made by P.E. majors
for P.E. majors. And that doesn't mean
petroleum engineer.'"
The players, for their part, have been
receptive to Morton's approach.
"Morton's awesome," said senior left
tackle Kirk Chambers. "He's a great
coach with fundamentals . . . he'll get on
our case when it needs to happen, and
we understand that. It's part of the
coach-player relationship."
Given that approximately half of the
Cardinal roster is made up of true or red
shirt freshmen, the Stanford coaching staff
has had to learn how to be patient.
"Each game is an adventure, each ad
venture is new, and each one is a learning
process," Morton said. "They're young,
they're not as strong as the guys across
from them, they're inexperienced. Some
times they have to be coached through
things that a year from now they'll catch
on their own."
Opposing defenses, all too aware of
the o-line's youth, don't make things any

easier.
"I mean, teams blitz us getting off the

said.
