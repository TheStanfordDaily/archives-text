## Harvard looks to curtail drinking 
### REBECCA D. O'BRIEN HARVARD CRIMSON 
(U-WIRE) — With more and
more Harvard University students
being hospitalized for severe alcohol
abuse, the school's officials have
launched an initiative to look into
new ways to curtail irresponsible
drinking, from adjusting social atti
tudes to expanding treatment op
tions.
Yesterday, Harvard Dean Bene
dict H. Gross announced a commit
tee charged with investigating how
administrators, students and univer
sity health officials can prevent and
reduce binge drinking.
According to Gross, the commit
tee will not seek to clamp down on
student parties or tighten regula
tions, but will instead address what
he perceives to be the social problem
of alcohol abuse at Harvard.
Gross' announcement came after
24 Harvard undergraduates were
treated by Harvard University
Health Services for alcohol poison
ing this September - a substantial in
crease from the 15 admits for alco
hol-related illnesses last September.
The committee, established by
Gross and Harvard Provost Steven
E. Hyman, will be chaired by Currier
House Master Joseph L. Badaracco
and is expected to produce a set a
recommendations for ways to im
prove alcohol education and treat
ment by this spring.
Harvard's Board of Overseers
has pushed for the creation of a com
mittee following discussions with
concerned parents and in reaction to
the spike in hospitalizations, accord
ing to Gross and Hyman. Harvard
President Lawrence H. Summers has
also voiced support for the commit
tee, whose other members have not
yet been made public.
Gross said he hopes to spark dis
cussion at the university about irre
sponsible alcohol consumption and,
more broadly, the social dimensions
of drinking. The committee will seek
input and advice from students, ad
ministrators and medical experts, he
said.
Specifically, efforts will be made
to improve the Harvard UHS's re
sponse to crises as well as expanding
counseling and support for students
with recurring alcohol problems.
"The main goal is to reduce heavy
drinking, via educational and thera
peutic programs," Gross said. "I'm
doing this because I think it's a seri
ous health problem."

Hyman said that the problem
needs to be addressed from the dual
perspective of prevention and re
sponse.
"The goal is not to have a com
mittee that meets and declares victo
ry because we've had a meeting,"
Hyman said. "The goal is to proper
ly address the many sides of the
problem with binge drinking, rang
ing from health risks to academic
problems to sexual assault."
Though Gross declared his inter
est in the issue of alcohol last spring
following the release of the Leaning
Committee's report to address sexu
al assault at Harvard, Gross said that
his concerns have been heightened
by the UHS statistics.
Gross said that while it appears
that the number of people drinking
regularly has remained somewhat
level over the past 10 years, the num
ber of people who are getting dan
gerously sick has gone up consider
ably, especially among women. He
also said he is concerned that stu
dents may trivialize the dangers of
alcohol use.
"People joke about alcohol abuse
now, like they used to joke about
drug abuse and date rape when I was
in college," Gross said. "Last year,
we had a discussion of sexual vio
lence on campus, and put a program
in place to address it. I think it's now
time to discuss the dangers and con
sequences of alcohol abuse."
Sobering Statistics
Recent spikes in UHS alcohol ad
missions have contributed to the
sense of urgency about the alcohol
situation on campus.
The 60 percent increase in admits
from last September to this Septem
ber includes a marked jump in the
number of first-years treated for al
cohol poisoning. Of the 24 admits
this September, 13 were freshmen.
Last September, 8 of the 15 students
treated were freshmen.
In at least two of this year's 24
cases, the victims fell into comas, ac
cording to UHS statistics.
The total number of alcohol
check-ins has risen in the past six
years, from 18 total in the 1997-
1998 school year to 123 total in the
2002-2003 academic year. The sta
tistics show that typically, the Har
vard UHS sees the most alcohol-re
lated cases in November and De
cember.

Director of the Harvard UHS
David Rosenthal said that he is not

sure whether the increase in UHS
visits is due to an increase in binge
drinking or to a greater willingness
to seek medical attention.
Only in recent years has the ad
ministration made it clear that there
are no disciplinary repercussions for
check-ins that are purely alcohol-re
lated, Rosenthal said.
Hyman said that while he does
not believe Harvard's drinking prob
lem is bad compared to other schools
in the United States, "the problem is
bad enough to be taken seriously."
"It's very discouraging," Hyman
said. "We obviously don't have our
messages down right. We have to ad
dress these problems more clearly
and effectively."
Road to Recommendations
"One thing we might want to
teach is how students can learn to
read the signals from their own body
that they've had enough," Hyman
said.
Hyman, who will sit on the com
mittee, said that he hopes that there
will be concrete changes made at the
end of the year.
"Obviously we can do both edu
cation and treatment, but I think the
issue is doing education in a certain
way," Hyman said. "We are starting
from the position that students carry
understanding about alcohol but
don't always act on it."
Hyman also stresses the impor
tance of creating an "alliance" of
House masters, tutors, doctors and
students in order to coordinate ef
forts at prevention and response.
Harvard History of Science pro
fessor Everett R. Mendelsohn, said
he hopes the committee will focus
first on the aspects of the social
scene at Harvard that may lead to ir
responsible drinking.
"I'm less interested in discipline
and rules in this case than I was in the
case of rape, because in this case it's
often self abuse. We need to focus on
cultural and structural self-educa
tion," Mendelsohn said.
Harvard Undergraduate Council
President Rohit Chopra, a senior,
said he's been assured that the com
mittee will not focus on discipline or
on the Administrative Board.

"I'm pleased that the University
is admitting its failure in providing
proper treatment to those in need,"
said Chopra, who adds that he hopes
the administration will also look into
improving its resources for treating
mental health problems.

teach is how students can learn to
read the signals from their own body
that they've had enough," Hyman
said.
Hyman, who will sit on the com
mittee, said that he hopes that there
will be concrete changes made at the
end of the year.
"Obviously we can do both edu
cation and treatment, but I think the
issue is doing education in a certain
way," Hyman said. "We are starting
from the position that students carry
understanding about alcohol but
don't always act on it."
Hyman also stresses the impor
tance of creating an "alliance" of
House masters, tutors, doctors and
students in order to coordinate ef
forts at prevention and response.
Harvard History of Science pro
fessor Everett R. Mendelsohn, said
he hopes the committee will focus
first on the aspects of the social
scene at Harvard that may lead to ir
responsible drinking.
"I'm less interested in discipline
and rules in this case than I was in the
case of rape, because in this case it's
often self abuse. We need to focus on
cultural and structural self-educa
tion," Mendelsohn said.
Harvard Undergraduate Council
President Rohit Chopra, a senior,
said he's been assured that the com
mittee will not focus on discipline or
on the Administrative Board.

"I'm pleased that the University
is admitting its failure in providing
proper treatment to those in need,"
said Chopra, who adds that he hopes
the administration will also look into
improving its resources for treating
mental health problems.
(U-WIRE) — With more and
more Harvard University students
being hospitalized for severe alcohol
abuse, the school's officials have
launched an initiative to look into
new ways to curtail irresponsible
drinking, from adjusting social atti
tudes to expanding treatment op
tions.
Yesterday, Harvard Dean Bene
dict H. Gross announced a commit
tee charged with investigating how
administrators, students and univer
sity health officials can prevent and
reduce binge drinking.
According to Gross, the commit
tee will not seek to clamp down on
student parties or tighten regula
tions, but will instead address what
he perceives to be the social problem
of alcohol abuse at Harvard.
Gross' announcement came after
24 Harvard undergraduates were
treated by Harvard University
Health Services for alcohol poison
ing this September - a substantial in
crease from the 15 admits for alco
hol-related illnesses last September.
The committee, established by
Gross and Harvard Provost Steven
E. Hyman, will be chaired by Currier
House Master Joseph L. Badaracco
and is expected to produce a set a
recommendations for ways to im
prove alcohol education and treat
ment by this spring.
Harvard's Board of Overseers
has pushed for the creation of a com
mittee following discussions with
concerned parents and in reaction to
the spike in hospitalizations, accord
ing to Gross and Hyman. Harvard
President Lawrence H. Summers has
also voiced support for the commit
tee, whose other members have not
yet been made public.
Gross said he hopes to spark dis
cussion at the university about irre
sponsible alcohol consumption and,
more broadly, the social dimensions
of drinking. The committee will seek
input and advice from students, ad
ministrators and medical experts, he
said.
Specifically, efforts will be made
to improve the Harvard UHS's re
sponse to crises as well as expanding
counseling and support for students
with recurring alcohol problems.
"The main goal is to reduce heavy
drinking, via educational and thera
peutic programs," Gross said. "I'm
doing this because I think it's a seri
ous health problem."

Hyman said that the problem
needs to be addressed from the dual
perspective of prevention and re
sponse.
"The goal is not to have a com
mittee that meets and declares victo
ry because we've had a meeting,"
Hyman said. "The goal is to proper
ly address the many sides of the
problem with binge drinking, rang
ing from health risks to academic
problems to sexual assault."
Though Gross declared his inter
est in the issue of alcohol last spring
following the release of the Leaning
Committee's report to address sexu
al assault at Harvard, Gross said that
his concerns have been heightened
by the UHS statistics.
Gross said that while it appears
that the number of people drinking
regularly has remained somewhat
level over the past 10 years, the num
ber of people who are getting dan
gerously sick has gone up consider
ably, especially among women. He
also said he is concerned that stu
dents may trivialize the dangers of
alcohol use.
"People joke about alcohol abuse
now, like they used to joke about
drug abuse and date rape when I was
in college," Gross said. "Last year,
we had a discussion of sexual vio
lence on campus, and put a program
in place to address it. I think it's now
time to discuss the dangers and con
sequences of alcohol abuse."
Sobering Statistics
Recent spikes in UHS alcohol ad
missions have contributed to the
sense of urgency about the alcohol
situation on campus.
The 60 percent increase in admits
from last September to this Septem
ber includes a marked jump in the
number of first-years treated for al
cohol poisoning. Of the 24 admits
this September, 13 were freshmen.
Last September, 8 of the 15 students
treated were freshmen.
In at least two of this year's 24
cases, the victims fell into comas, ac
cording to UHS statistics.
The total number of alcohol
check-ins has risen in the past six
years, from 18 total in the 1997-
1998 school year to 123 total in the
2002-2003 academic year. The sta
tistics show that typically, the Har
vard UHS sees the most alcohol-re
lated cases in November and De
cember.

Director of the Harvard UHS
David Rosenthal said that he is not

sure whether the increase in UHS
visits is due to an increase in binge
drinking or to a greater willingness
to seek medical attention.
Only in recent years has the ad
ministration made it clear that there
are no disciplinary repercussions for
check-ins that are purely alcohol-re
lated, Rosenthal said.
Hyman said that while he does
not believe Harvard's drinking prob
lem is bad compared to other schools
in the United States, "the problem is
bad enough to be taken seriously."
"It's very discouraging," Hyman
said. "We obviously don't have our
messages down right. We have to ad
dress these problems more clearly
and effectively."
