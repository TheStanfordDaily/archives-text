# Bon voyage: An editor's note
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITORS 
Nicole:
While I was busying myself by laying on my couch, eating
Cheet-oes, and watching re-runs of "Full House" on TBS dur
ing the summer — I received an e-mail from Karan, who had
just entered his 13th hour of waiting in the Hong Kong airport.
On his way home to New Delhi, he was trapped in the airport,
with nothing better to do than write me e-mails; the contents in
volved many combinations of the word "SARS" with multiple
expletives.
Luckily, I was able to rescue him by encouraging him to surf
the Web for Dave Barry articles. As a co-editor of Intermission,
I am constantly called upon to provide this type of moral support.
Little did I know that later in the summer, I too would be
trapped — in a bus stop in Mexico — knowing all too well that
Karan was happily at home, reading Dave Barry and eating
India's equivalent of Chee-toes.
While being a globe-trotter has its ups and downs, there is re
ally nothing like exploring another country. The people, the cul
tures, the lowered drinking age ... all make for a pleasant jour

ney. So we encourage each and every one of you to explore the
possibilities of world travel. Though it sometimes means sacri
ficing your personal self-dignity for the relentless airline securi
ty strip searches ... the journey is ultimately worth it, believe
me.
Dave Barry:
I would say that the single most important conclusion I
reached, after having spent three weeks traveling through
Japan, as well as countless hours reading, studying,and analyz
ing this fascinating culture, is that you should always tighten the
cap on the shampoo bottle before you put it in your suitcase. Be
cause otherwise — trust me here — it's going to leak all over
everything, including your toothbrush, and when you brush
your teeth you'll be foaming at the mouth, as though you've
been bitten by a dog infected with rabies.
Karan:
Let me start by saying that I am saddened that Intermission is
doing a travel issue. Not only does such an issue promote a re
gard for international cultures — something I have crusaded

against all my life — but it also annexes print space reserved for
more important features, such as "The Grand Review of Air
ports in Southern China."
Airports, my children, are underrated: People forget that
it is in their pristine bathrooms that various cultures come to
cross-urinate and it is on their runways that our journeys first
take off.
On my way home to India, I spent 13 hours in Hong Kong
Airport at the height of the S ARS epidemic. I wore a mask for
a while and then discarded it when I couldn't take the smell of
my own breath. I felt like a badass (something I am quite un
used to) and proceeded to infect one billion people in India
upon landing in Delhi airport. Muhahaha.
As you may surmise, my summer was productive even be
fore it began.
But really, the reason I delve into my own past is to make a
subtle point: Airports, with their interminable waits, are where
we experience the first excitement of the journey and where we
come to contemplate our adventures once the trip has ended.
And so, as much as this sounds like a bad 80s song title, I in
vite you, dear readers, to make Intermission your airport.
Come, press your nose against the window and watch the
land grow upon you.
