# Australia is the hottest new place to study overseas. Take flight this week and get a taste of the Australian outback.
## DOWN UNDER 
### BRIAN UCHTENSTEIN 
It was a harrowing two-day flight across the Pacific, an
endless night of fighting balmy skies and mediocre food
while personalized movies and video games were shoved
down one's throat, but at long last I arrived in Brisbane.
Quickly navigating through customs — asked only if
I was carrying beef jerky — and to the bus, it was only
a matter of time before we were dropped off at our new
accommodations in the St. Lucia apartments down the
road from Toowong. With shoulders and legs stiff from
traveling, Branden (my new roommate) and I opted for
a run before lunch to case the city by the river. Gliding
across the asphalt of our newly adopted town, we fol
lowed a route that hugged the nearby river and Uni
versity of Queensland before heading back home to
shower down.
I spent Friday night at the Royal Exchange Pub in
Toowong, a big hangout for the local students, where one
learns to get friendly.
Lesson 1: Australians cannot dance.
Lesson 2: American "accents*' are cute.
Lesson 3: An Aussie hello = handshake / hug + spilling
beer on your hand / chest.
Saturday we played tourist in Brisbane proper, start
ing out in South Bank at Breaka beach and ending up

downtown at nightfall. We went back to St. Lucia to de
compress for a couple hours till we headed back out to
the Valley, where all the cool kids go.
Lesson 4: If you say you are the best street performer
in Brisbane and in reality are incredibly bad, little kids will
cry when you go near them.
Lesson 5: Ibis = Australian pigeon.
Lesson 6: Always bring your passport to the good clubs.
Though great debate raged on what to do between
the koala sanctuary full of narcoleptic bundles of joy,
the Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise and Coolangatta, or
Mount Coot-tha's eucalyptus forest (not-that-exotic
choices for me, having been raised in a eucalyptus forest
by the beach and zoo), hiking Coot-tha won out in the
end. Not the most fantastic trails but we got a neat view
of Brisbane at the peak.
Lesson 7: Brush turkeys are mean.
Lost down under, I have no recourse but to fight my
way through the Australian brush. Having forged a slip
shod computer out of a dingo's hide, goanna teeth, box
jellies and sand, I was able to relay my last coordinates
before slipping back into the forests to find some tucker.
Though my map is from 1923, it should be accurate
enough to give you a rough idea of my current location.
If not, ask the National Security Agency. They're good
at that sort of thing.


Heron Island, which lies off the coast of Queensland, looks eerie in the evening glare of the Sun.
