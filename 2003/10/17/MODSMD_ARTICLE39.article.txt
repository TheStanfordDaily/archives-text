# Hitting Japan like a tsunami
## 
### RYAN SANDS STAFF WRITER 
Along with about a score and a half other Stanford students, I spent my
spring and summer in Japan. Now, to try and distill those amazingly full
and exciting five months of life into a short newspaper article would be
nothing more than an exercise in futility. For this week's Intermission, I
excerpted a few interesting days from the dozens and dozens of pages of
my online, blog, where I chronicled the excitement and delightful confu
sion of life as a foreigner in Japan.
Wednesday, May 7:
Today we got up at the breaka-break of dawn to visit the temples at
Nikko, about three hours north of Tokyo. Nikko is basically a huge moun
tain temple complex which centers around the graves of Tokugawa Ieya
su and his grandson Tokugawa Iemitsu.
Tokugawa Ieyasu is the man who roughly unified Japan in the begin
ning of the 1600s and was the first Shogun (military ruler) of Japan. His lin
eage stayed in power until the 1860s and the Meiji restoration/revolution.
His tomb is located painfully far up the mountain, but it was calm and
foggy up there, which gave it a sort of lovely religiosity and somberness.
Later we decided to venture a little farther west to see the famous Kegon
Falls and Lake Chuzenji.
The bus ride toward Kegon Falls was fucking ridiculous: 19 hairpin
turns as we climbed and climbed (or were we lumbering?) up the side of a
mountain. (It's always mountains — what is it with this country?) After
the bus was a teacup ropeway car ride further up the mountain. Near the
entrance to the ropeway car was a huge warning poster describing the dan
ger of wild monkeys that would attack us for our food, specifically, for our
CANDY. My new catchphrase: A MONKEY ON CANDY. Like, "Did
you see that guy at the club? He was all over that girl like A MONKEY
ON CANDY." I think it works.
Leaving reason and logic aside we decide to walk/hike over to the falls,
which were visible from our mountain vantage point. From the falls we
wondered further to the edge of Lake Chuzenji. Here we encountered a
man renting swan-shaped paddleboats. Being the enduringly queer fel
lows we are, we rented these love duckboats for an hour. The lake was
lovely, but it was hard to enjoy the sites while laughing the entire time at
how RIDICULOUS we looked.
We got out of Nikko, and headed toward the Tokyo nightlife by bullet
train.

Thursday, May 15:
I went with Mends to see the insane speed-shriek punkers Melt Banana.
It was 2,000 yen (about 16 bucks) including one free drink. When I entered,

yaSUko (lead singer) and Agata (guitarist extraordinaire) were hanging out
in the lobby area and none of the Japanese kids paid them any mind at all!

Strange, at their U.S. shows, American punks are always dying to get a word with them.
The first two opening bands were real chill, very prog-rock and a bit experimental. Then

this completely ridiculous rapper/mental patient came out with just a microphone, prison
er-looking horizontal striped jumps, backwards cap and a drum machine strapped to his
chest. I couldn't do anything except stare BLANKLY. Finally Melt Banana hit the stage.

No one there was rabid yet, so we got up to the front of the stage easily.
They rocked so hard that the tide changed, for real. It was like getting electric
shocks directly onto my brain. The Japanese kids in attendance — while
quiet and reserved as the lights went down — started really getting into it too,
jumping off the guard rails, shoving and head-banging.
Agata is like a possessed monster when he plays! At one point he was
leaning back on the crowd, facing the back of the stage and making insane
noises. That man is a legend. My first Japanese concert was a huge success.

Monday, Sept 8:
On Friday, while I was riding the main subway line in Osaka north to
meet a friend, the train stopped unexpectedly at Namba station. An an
nouncement came over the speakers in Japanese stating, "Sorry for the in
convenience, we ask for your patience please. At Dobutsuen-mae Station,
there has been a 'traffic accident resulting in personal injury or death.' The
trains going north and south will be stopped while we assess and take care of
the situation."

I was confused at first, but after hearing it a few times, I figured this warn
ing out. Turns out that somebody committed suicide by throwing themselves
in front of an oncoming subway car at a station I pass daily on my way home.
The long and short is that they had to shut down the train for about an hour
or two to clean up the body and blood. I managed to walk west to the next sta
tion and meet my friend after about a 30-minute delay.
If you have seen these trains you will know that they are fast, heavy and
full of people. I'm sure at least a hundred people were witness to this person's
grisly suicide. But, within an hour or so, the trains are up and running again.
That's crazy times in a metropolitan city.

the bus was a teacup ropeway car ride further up the mountain. Near the
entrance to the ropeway car was a huge warning poster describing the dan
ger of wild monkeys that would attack us for our food, specifically, for our
CANDY. My new catchphrase: A MONKEY ON CANDY. Like, "Did
you see that guy at the club? He was all over that girl like A MONKEY
ON CANDY." I think it works.
Leaving reason and logic aside we decide to walk/hike over to the falls,
which were visible from our mountain vantage point. From the falls we
wondered further to the edge of Lake Chuzenji. Here we encountered a
man renting swan-shaped paddleboats. Being the enduringly queer fel
lows we are, we rented these love duckboats for an hour. The lake was
lovely, but it was hard to enjoy the sites while laughing the entire time at
how RIDICULOUS we looked.
We got out of Nikko, and headed toward the Tokyo nightlife by bullet
train.

Thursday, May 15:
I went with Mends to see the insane speed-shriek punkers Melt Banana.
It was 2,000 yen (about 16 bucks) including one free drink. When I entered,

yaSUko (lead singer) and Agata (guitarist extraordinaire) were hanging out
in the lobby area and none of the Japanese kids paid them any mind at all!

Strange, at their U.S. shows, American punks are always dying to get a word with them.
The first two opening bands were real chill, very prog-rock and a bit experimental. Then

this completely ridiculous rapper/mental patient came out with just a microphone, prison
er-looking horizontal striped jumps, backwards cap and a drum machine strapped to his
chest. I couldn't do anything except stare BLANKLY. Finally Melt Banana hit the stage.

No one there was rabid yet, so we got up to the front of the stage easily.
They rocked so hard that the tide changed, for real. It was like getting electric
shocks directly onto my brain. The Japanese kids in attendance — while
quiet and reserved as the lights went down — started really getting into it too,
jumping off the guard rails, shoving and head-banging.
Agata is like a possessed monster when he plays! At one point he was
leaning back on the crowd, facing the back of the stage and making insane
noises. That man is a legend. My first Japanese concert was a huge success.

Monday, Sept 8:
On Friday, while I was riding the main subway line in Osaka north to
meet a friend, the train stopped unexpectedly at Namba station. An an
nouncement came over the speakers in Japanese stating, "Sorry for the in
convenience, we ask for your patience please. At Dobutsuen-mae Station,
there has been a 'traffic accident resulting in personal injury or death.' The
trains going north and south will be stopped while we assess and take care of
the situation."

I was confused at first, but after hearing it a few times, I figured this warn
ing out. Turns out that somebody committed suicide by throwing themselves
in front of an oncoming subway car at a station I pass daily on my way home.
The long and short is that they had to shut down the train for about an hour
or two to clean up the body and blood. I managed to walk west to the next sta
tion and meet my friend after about a 30-minute delay.
If you have seen these trains you will know that they are fast, heavy and
full of people. I'm sure at least a hundred people were witness to this person's
grisly suicide. But, within an hour or so, the trains are up and running again.
That's crazy times in a metropolitan city.


The Himeji castle, a medieval Japanese fortress, is perched in the hills.
