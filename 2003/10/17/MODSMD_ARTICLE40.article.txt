# Hanging with the turtles in Costa Rica
## 
### JENN COYLE 
Apart from the awesome cultural experience and ridiculously
rapid Spanish acquisition, one of the best aspects of my summer
in Costa Rica was the opportunity to travel every weekend, either
with the university group or independently.
During a 5-day break at the end of July I traveled with a friend,
Brooke from Cal State-Chico, to Tortuguero National Park, lo
cated in the upper northeast coast of the country. The park en
compasses about 20,000 hectares of rain-forested flatland, man
groves, and beaches, crisscrossed by hundreds of canals. The only
inhabited area is the village of Tortuguero - a tiny settlement that
is inaccessible by roads. In fact there are hardly any roads in the
town itself, and the best way to get around is on raised boards

above the soggy ground.
Just getting to it was an experience as we took two separate
busses, one straight through an expansive banana plantation, fol
lowed by an hour-long boat ride through the park's canals that
featured howler monkeys and toucans above as well as two croc
odiles sunning along the banks.
The park gets its name from the Sea Turtles (tortugas in
Spanish) that nest along the beach. We were lucky enough to
be there during the Green Sea Turtles' nesting season, so that
night we took a tour with a local guide to see the turtles come
out of the ocean to lay their eggs. We saw four turtles total,
Green Sea Turtles aren't the biggest ones, but they are about 3
feet long and do live over 150 years. Two of turtles we saw came
up on the beach, then turned around and went back into the

water because the lights from the village bothered them. This
is a very serious problem because beach developments - par
ticularly resorts - all over the country and the world are affect
ing turtles' nesting habits.
One turtle we saw had just laid its eggs and we got to crouch
down and see them, all clustered together in a hole in the sand,
with a red filtered flashlight - the female turtles can't hear while
they're laying, so noise doesn't bother them like light does.
As we watched, the turtle used her front flippers to brush
sand into the hole, covering the eggs. It probably sounds senti
mental, but watching this huge, 100-year-old creature taking
care of her eggs, following the same instructions that nature has
given her and her forebears for thousands of years was really
quite amazing.
