# Getting sketchy in Mexico
## Intermission journeys to Puerto Vallarta, Guanajuanto and beyond 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Ah, Mexico. It's really in the subtle joys of experiencing a new country that you
come to appreciate world cultures, diversity and the fact that America has water
pressure. You think the serial groper is a touchy subject on campus — he ain't got
nothing on what's going on down in Mexico. It's a rare day when you don't get your
ass grabbed. Never the less, if you are feeling so inclined to take a journey to our
neighbor to the south, here are a few things to bear in mind:
Mexico is a great country! I got to experience it with my roommate, Kalin, as we
traveled to Guanajuato. Pretty much everywhere we went we were whistled or
shouted at; one man reached his arms out of his car to try to touch us, others took
pictures of us, and we were called a whole barrage of names (guerita, mamacita,
princesa, presiosa, reina ... but my favorites were the guys who simply said, "I love
you"). It's sort of like being famous, really. J.Lo, eat your heart out.
I know that this "guera phenomenon" (which, incidentally, would make a
GREAT name for a band) occurred just because we're blonde, but I liked to think
the guys responded because we'd been working out. There was a gym close to
where we stayed that was quite popular... but it was a little weird when we ran into
one of our Tae-Bo teachers at a night-club. It is wrong to get jiggy wit' your aero
bics instructor?
Guanajuato was an interesting place (where else can you visit a mummy muse
um and a torture chamber and buy key-chains to remember the experience?), and
definitely worth the trip. There were, however, a few things that I didn't really like,
like the fact that everyone there smokes, and I'm pretty sure that I may have con
tracted lung cancer just by smelling my clothes after I'd been out for a while.. .and
the fact that they apparently don't believe in fabric softener. It was like I was wear
ing rocks. But other than that, it was really great.
In our third week in Guanajuato, Kalin and I decided a trip to the beach was in
order. We found out we could get a pretty good deal to Puerto Vallarta if we agreed
to 10 hours of "luxury bus travel" on Primera Plus. While trying to make the deci
sion as to whether the trip was feasible, we were offered another trip to "an un
known beach" with "very few people" by our aerobics instructor, Abraham. He
said that the beach was "a little rustic", but we'd travel by car with a few other peo
ple and we "wouldn't have to bring much clothing."
Kalin and I signed up with Primera Plus.
All excited about our beach trip, we took a taxi to the station with, what we
thought was, plenty of time to catch our bus. However, "se salio".
Apparently, we had been given the wrong bus schedule, and the last bus had left
for the night. After arguing in Spanish with the Primera Plus people (not my strong
suit), Kalin and I were forced into our only other alternative: buying new bus tick
ets and leaving on the next bus, at 6 a.m. It was 10 p.m.
Kalin looked at me, "We should have gone with Abraham."
Since we had to buy new bus tickets and didn't have enough money to get home,
we decided to set in for a night at the bus stop.
The first couple of hours were the worst, as we settled in for an evening of bad
movies dubbed in Spanish ("The Faculty" — seriously, what were all those good
actors thinking? and Jon Stewart?!; "Hellhound" — starring Chuck Norris, need I
say more?; and some old Jackie Chan movie — don't get me started...), but
around the seventh hour we had resorted to hypothetical questions (me: "If you
were an actress, what would your limitations be as to doing scenes involving nudi
ty?" Kalin: "I'd probably say that I wouldn't do nudity... unless I could get a butt
double, that'd be awesome.")
Finally our bus came, and nine hours later, we were in Puerto Vallarta. I must
state here that the rest of our trip was really quite enjoyable. We had a sweet hotel
on the beach with an all-inclusive package, which totally subsidized my brief but
passionate love affair with pina coladas ... so it was definitely worth it.
And what of Abraham's trip?
We ran into a girl at the university who recounted the weekend for us:
"14 hours in aVW bug with 6 people... when we got there it was seriously sticks,
and beach... and we had to sleep on tarps. TARPS."
Well, he said it would be rustic, ll's well that ends well, I guess. But where IS that
pina colada mix?
