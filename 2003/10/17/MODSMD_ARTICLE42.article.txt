# Get your midgets at this 'Station'
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
Consider the train-spotter. Not
an Irish heroin junkie from
the Danny Boyle film, but a
hobbyist who spends long
hours simply waiting for a look at his fa
vorite train. If you can see something
poignant and meaningful in this pas
time, Tom McCarthy's "The Station
Agent" might be the film for you.
The center of "The Station
Agent" is fortunately not a locomo
tive, but a young man named Finbar
McBride (Peter Dinklage). Fin's at
tractive, with a deep voice, dark hair
and brooding eyes. But that's not
why people stop in the street to look

at him — he's also a dwarf.

The double takes,
taunts and general spe
cial treatment he re
ceives — one woman

photographs him in a
supermarket — have
made him a loner who
spends his time watch
ing videos of trains and
working in the model
train shop of his one real

friend. When this friend dies and leaves
him a house on the tracks in remote
Newfoundland, N.J., he hopes to con
tinue his austere existence.
Of course, his hopes aren't com
pletely satisfied, or we wouldn't have a
movie. Immediately intruding into
Fin's life are the raucously friendly Joe
Oramas (Bobby Cannavale), owner of
the local hot dog stand and scattered,
neurotic Olivia Harris (Patricia Clark
son), who almost runs Fin over with her
car.

These intrusions are ultimately sue-

cessful, but the success is slow in com
ing. Fin spends the first half of the film
spurning friendly advances, going
about his daily business in his methodi
cal way and becoming acclimated to
life in Newfoundland in a very gradual
way. Watching this is a lot like waiting
for a train.
When it finally comes in, things
begin to get interesting. Joe and Olivia
turn out to have private troubles of
their own, and when the three bond
after weeks of awkward meetings, we
begin to care about each of them. It's
particularly fascinating to watch Fin
come out of his shell, revealing a fuller
past than we might expect from his pre
sent.

At this point, Mc-

Carthy undergoes the di
rectorial equivalent of a

psychotic episode. He leaves be

hind the visual language
of train-spotting — se
date medium and long
shots, the washed out col
ors of old railway stations
— for MTV-style quick
cuts, close-ups on shot
glasses and angry faces,
and an emotional climax

that is similarly jarring.
For 10 minutes, you may feel like
you've stepped into a different film,
one that will deliver some big-time
Hollywood thrills. But don't get too ex
cited — like a train coming out of a tun
nel, "The Station Agent" soon returns
to familiar country.
This is not a country of thrills and
climaxes, which is why McCarthy's
MTV moment works so poorly. It's a
country best viewed in a shot Mc-
Carthy reuses throughout the movie, to
gathering effect: A train track runs

through the middle third of the screen,
and a character walks slowly along it,
sandwiched between earth and sky.
This kind of shot both emphasizes
Fin's small stature and renders it irrele
vant. When all three principals walk
the tracks together, we focus for a mo
ment on their different heights. Then
the horizontal obscures the vertical.

These are all people, we sense, who are
moving not up or down, but across then
lives.
Joe, Olivia and Fin have neither
tragic falls nor epiphanies. Instead, the
end simply finds them in a slightly dif
ferent place from where they started.
Let's return to the train-spotter.
Every day, he watches the 5:23 p.m.

train steam through his town. Then,
just once, he decides to get on. He goes
on a rather uneventful journey, gets off
at the next town on the line. It's not the
paradise he'd hoped for, but it is a little
different. Maybe it's different enough
to make the journey worthwhile.
Maybe it isn't. If you see "The Station
Agent," the decision will be yours.
