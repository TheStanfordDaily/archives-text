# 'Runaway Jury' worth a trial
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
There's an old industry joke that Grisham adapta
tions are the perfect way to gauge and compare di
rectors. The reasoning is this: Since each story es
sentially starts out with the same materials, any
uniqueness associated with a particular film must be due
solely to its director's imprint.
Looking at the results of recent years, I'd say just the op
posite seems to be true; far from bringing out their idiosyn
crasies, Grisham movies feel more like universal equalizers,
bringing even the most adept directors (Francis Ford

Coppola, for instance) to their knees. The
latest Grisham thriller to hit screens — the i
movies lag behind the books by more than a
few years — is "Runaway Jury," directed by
Gary Fleder, which actually ranks above av

erage in the Grisham cannon.
Gene Hackman stars as Rankin Fitch, a
jury consultant who essentially orchestrates
court verdicts by thoroughly researching and
blackmailing each member of the jury into
voting whichever way he wants. "Trials are

too important to be decided by juries," he snarls, and Hack
man has the perfect amount of callous braggadocio to make
you believe it. He needs it, too — watching Fitch's laugh
ably complex warehouse operation, complete with huge
plasma screens tracking the movements of every juror and a
crack team of psychoanalysts to interpret their every move
— smacks of what I can only term cinematic excess; all cred
it to Hackman for managing to reel in this absurdity on the
force of his personality alone.
Fitch's current case is a wrongful death lawsuit brought

against a large gun company by the widow of an investment
banker (played by an unintentionally deadpan Dylan McDer
mott in flashbacks) who was killed in an office shooting ram
page. Fitch has been called in by the gun company to prevent
the jury from awarding a landmark settlement which would
essentially cripple the industry; what he hasn't taken into ac
count this time is the moral conviction of his opposing counsel
(Dustin Hoffman, with a surprisingly passable New Orleans
drawl) as well as a conniving jury member named Nick Easter
(John Cusack).
Easter believes he also has the jury in his pocket, and he

and his girlfriend Marlee (Rachel Weisz) are soon
trying to sell the jury verdict to whichever side will
pay. Here we have another movie that focuses on

the art of the con — watching Cusack saunter unas

sumingly into the jury room and work his magic on
the other members feels maddeningly like another
game of "Matchstick Men" — but Fleder wisely
keeps his film zipping along with an endless flurry
of cuts and dissolves, never allowing us to know any
character too intimately out of fear that too much
of the plot will be given away.
This is where the depth of the cast becomes
an advantage. Nearly every role in the movie is

played by a familiar character actor, and the narrative wisely
banks on the familiarity of their faces to fill out their lack of
character development. Whereas normally I'd be lamenting the
underusage of these actors (Why? Why doesn't Luis Guzman
get to do more?), the film charges forward so quickly that we es
sentially forget about them until they turn up onscreen again.
At long last, a situation perfectly suited to the cardboard
characters of mass market fiction. Fleder deserves credit for
the pacing, but it's really his sizeable stable of actors who
make "Runaway Jury" a trial worth following.


I'm almost haggard enough to be Al Pacino.
