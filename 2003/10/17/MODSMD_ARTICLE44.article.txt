# An April' shower with Katie Holmes
## Intermission interviews Peter Hedges and Katie Holmes 
### CHRIS LEE 
When I meet "Pieces of April" director
Peter Hedges at the Ritz Carlton in San Fran
cisco for our college roundtable interview, he's
wheeling chairs into the conference room like
a hotel busboy. He's a reasonably tall man,
with casually disheveled blonde hair that,
along with a cartoonish slant of mouth, make
him look the quintessential artist. He's in the
middle of his press junket for "Pieces of
April," (the film opens today in limited re
lease) which will be screened that night at the
Mill Valley Film Festival.
"Pieces of April" was one of the darlings of
the Sundance Film Festival this year, if not for
winning one of the prestigious dramatic
awards then for winning its audience's hearts.
I attended the opening screening at Sundance
with the Stanford Film Society, and I'll never
forget the standing ovation during the Q&A
session with the filmmakers after the film
ended-
It was clear that writer/director Peter
Hedges had managed to capture something
with his tiny movie — a subtle honesty with its
characters, a mordant truth in its seriocomic
situations that spoke of the sensibilities of his
distinct narrative voice. "Pieces of April" stars
Katie Holmes as April, a young adult who lives
with her boyfriend in a rundown New York
apartment. She has invited her estranged fam
ily over for Thanksgiving dinner, and the film
follows the trials and tribulations involved in
cooking the all-important meal and getting the
family to converge at a single location. Oliver
Piatt and Patricia Clarkson play April's par
ents, with Clarkson winning a Sundance Spe
cial Jury Prize in part for her performance as
April's tragicomic, cancer-stricken mother.

The 83-minute film was shot on Digital
Video in a scant eight days and produced by In-
DigEnt, the same company responsible for last
year's indie "Tadpole." It is Peter Hedges's di
rectorial debut; he has previously written the
book and screenplay for "What's Eating
Gilbert Grape?" as well as the excellent screen
adaptation of Nick Hornby's "About a Boy."
During the round-table interview at the
Ritz, Hedges delivers an animated, snappy dis
course on his philosophy of art and the long
process that resulted in "April."
The idea for the film came when Hedges
heard a story about New Yorkers who'd had to
go around their apartment building asking for
various neighbors' help in cooking food when
their oven went out. This is how most of his
writing ideas come about. "I look for a great
story," he says. "A story that I either have to
tell or I can't wait to tell. You know that feeling
when you're walking down the street, you hear
some news, and you just can't wait to tell your
mom? When I'm making up a story, I look for
the 'you're not gonna believe what I'm gonna
tell you.'" A pause. "I'm a bit of a story whore
in that sense," he concludes, unabashed.
The process of getting the film made was
still an ordeal, however. Hedges claims he was
more adamant than usual during the writing
phase: "When I wrote the script, I wrote it so
that I could make it... I knew when I wrote
this one that I was gonna make it if I had to pay
for it myself, and that's what helped me finish
it." Once completed, the script was shopped
around until it reached Katie Holmes, who at
tached herself to the project. But even with
Holmes on board there was a series of almost
deals that soon had Hedges doubting himself.
A deal was finally struck with InDigEnt, which
greenlit the film for DV but required that
Holmes and Patricia Clarkson both forgo then
acting fees.
Somewhere in the midst of this spiel, Katie
Holmes herself walks into the room and sits
down next to her director, but not before plac
ing a Krispy Kreme donut in front of him. She
looks so exactly like one would expect in per-

son — decent height, believably good-looking
— that I can't help but feel the slightest twinge
of disappointment. The moment is not quite
surreal enough for me; showing equal defer
ence to Hedges, she seems to join our table
more as a peer of sorts than a celebrity, with
only the small footnote that this "peer" is the
reason Dawson and Pacey have been so con
stipated for the past five years on "Dawson's
Creek."
Holmes actually ends up saying very little in
the interview, but she does provide a few semi
canned answers for why independent movies
are worth making. "I really enjoy the challenge
of doing an independent movie simply because
I feel like I can be a little more collaborative
and have a bit more fun," Holmes reveals. "A
lot of times the writing in the projects are dif
ferent, have a different take on things and you
have more freedom." She points out the con
trast of working on a show like "Dawson's
Creek," which had a very routine production
schedule and had to follow the comfy but sti
fling "parameters of a nice teen show." She's
quick to temper this with a well-rehearsed "but
it was a wonderful experience, I thoroughly en
joyed working on it," but one senses that she's
already moved on.
When asked about her best experiences
with directors she mentions Curtis Hanson
("Wonder Boys"), Kevin Williamson
("Teaching Mrs. Tingle" and "Creek" creator)
and Ang Lee ("The Ice Storm"). And just like
that, a publicist enters the room and Holmes
must leave, whisked off to the airport for un
specified reasons. During our time together,
she has managed to eat two Krispy Kreme
donuts while remaining a complete enigma.
We turn our attention back to Hedges.
What I'm struck most by is his earnest convic
tion for the importance of telling significant sto
ries, important stories that make people think.
"I like movies that are as funny as hurhanly pos
sible — humanly possible," he emphasizes.
"Not the kind of humor that's broad and makes
fun of its characters. Caricature-based story
telling doesn't interest me. I like human stories
that are very funny and sexy and angry and full
of complexity, characters that I may find myself
repulsed by but strangely attracted to. Stories
that make me embrace life... make me think
about all that I have or all that I don't have or

where the world's headed."
I ask him how being a writer first affected
his ability to direct this film and he is quick to
correct me, pointing out that before all else,
he started out as an actor. "I became a writer
because I started writing plays for my actor
friends, because I wanted to prove to the
world how good they were ... I wrote
'Gilbert Grape' for kids I went to college
with." He seems to sense that everyone in the
room has an interest in filmmaking beyond
reporting it in the press, and so begins to dis
pense the type of guidance some of us will
never get tired of hearing. "My big advice to
younger people is to look around you and see
who around you is like minded and what are
their gifts," he says. "Then make plays or de
velop stand-up comedy with them, or get a
video camera and make a movie with them
because the way I learned to write was that I
made theater with my college friends."
When asked which recent films are impor
tant to him he refers to the first Dogma 95 film,
"Celebration," effusively describing it "as if
Ibsen and Chekov had made a movie." He
gives us a mini-lesson on shooting in digital —
"no wide shots or intricate color patterns" —
but always brings us back to story. "There are
movies where you think you're watching a
good movie but what you're looking at is a
beautiful landscape and somebody puts pretty
music underneath," he says, sounding more
disappointed than scornful. "The story's just
gotta be really compelling."
It's been more than nine months since I saw
the movie, but I'm still easily reminded of the
pleasures "April" brought as a short, simple
film with a pitch-perfect tone, seamlessly
blending pain and sadness with the unexpected
humor of real life. Hedges's own mother would
succumb to cancer during his writing of the
screenplay, and though Patricia Clarkson's
character in "Pieces of April" shares this same
fate he insists there are very few similarities be
tween the two.
Whatever the case, it's clear that he has
been affected by enough events during his
lifetime (9/11 among them) to realize the im
portance of people and their stories, and it is
this conviction that will almost certainly pro
pel him onto the list of important filmmakers
to watch.

of complexity, characters that I may find myself
repulsed by but strangely attracted to. Stories
that make me embrace life... make me think
about all that I have or all that I don't have or

where the world's headed."
I ask him how being a writer first affected
his ability to direct this film and he is quick to
correct me, pointing out that before all else,
he started out as an actor. "I became a writer
because I started writing plays for my actor
friends, because I wanted to prove to the
world how good they were ... I wrote
'Gilbert Grape' for kids I went to college
with." He seems to sense that everyone in the
room has an interest in filmmaking beyond
reporting it in the press, and so begins to dis
pense the type of guidance some of us will
never get tired of hearing. "My big advice to
younger people is to look around you and see
who around you is like minded and what are
their gifts," he says. "Then make plays or de
velop stand-up comedy with them, or get a
video camera and make a movie with them
because the way I learned to write was that I
made theater with my college friends."
When asked which recent films are impor
tant to him he refers to the first Dogma 95 film,
"Celebration," effusively describing it "as if
Ibsen and Chekov had made a movie." He
gives us a mini-lesson on shooting in digital —
"no wide shots or intricate color patterns" —
but always brings us back to story. "There are
movies where you think you're watching a
good movie but what you're looking at is a
beautiful landscape and somebody puts pretty
music underneath," he says, sounding more
disappointed than scornful. "The story's just
gotta be really compelling."
It's been more than nine months since I saw
the movie, but I'm still easily reminded of the
pleasures "April" brought as a short, simple
film with a pitch-perfect tone, seamlessly
blending pain and sadness with the unexpected
humor of real life. Hedges's own mother would
succumb to cancer during his writing of the
screenplay, and though Patricia Clarkson's
character in "Pieces of April" shares this same
fate he insists there are very few similarities be
tween the two.
Whatever the case, it's clear that he has
been affected by enough events during his
lifetime (9/11 among them) to realize the im

Hey, I didn't forget to put on my wig after all.


A subtle attempt to be trashy.
When I meet "Pieces of April" director
Peter Hedges at the Ritz Carlton in San Fran
cisco for our college roundtable interview, he's
wheeling chairs into the conference room like
a hotel busboy. He's a reasonably tall man,
with casually disheveled blonde hair that,
along with a cartoonish slant of mouth, make
him look the quintessential artist. He's in the
middle of his press junket for "Pieces of
April," (the film opens today in limited re
lease) which will be screened that night at the
Mill Valley Film Festival.
"Pieces of April" was one of the darlings of
the Sundance Film Festival this year, if not for
winning one of the prestigious dramatic
awards then for winning its audience's hearts.
I attended the opening screening at Sundance
with the Stanford Film Society, and I'll never
forget the standing ovation during the Q&A
session with the filmmakers after the film
ended-
It was clear that writer/director Peter
Hedges had managed to capture something
with his tiny movie — a subtle honesty with its
characters, a mordant truth in its seriocomic
situations that spoke of the sensibilities of his
distinct narrative voice. "Pieces of April" stars
Katie Holmes as April, a young adult who lives
with her boyfriend in a rundown New York
apartment. She has invited her estranged fam
ily over for Thanksgiving dinner, and the film
follows the trials and tribulations involved in
cooking the all-important meal and getting the
family to converge at a single location. Oliver
Piatt and Patricia Clarkson play April's par
ents, with Clarkson winning a Sundance Spe
cial Jury Prize in part for her performance as
April's tragicomic, cancer-stricken mother.

The 83-minute film was shot on Digital
Video in a scant eight days and produced by In-
DigEnt, the same company responsible for last
year's indie "Tadpole." It is Peter Hedges's di
rectorial debut; he has previously written the
book and screenplay for "What's Eating
Gilbert Grape?" as well as the excellent screen
adaptation of Nick Hornby's "About a Boy."
During the round-table interview at the
Ritz, Hedges delivers an animated, snappy dis
course on his philosophy of art and the long
process that resulted in "April."
The idea for the film came when Hedges
heard a story about New Yorkers who'd had to
go around their apartment building asking for
various neighbors' help in cooking food when
their oven went out. This is how most of his
writing ideas come about. "I look for a great
story," he says. "A story that I either have to
tell or I can't wait to tell. You know that feeling
when you're walking down the street, you hear
some news, and you just can't wait to tell your
mom? When I'm making up a story, I look for
the 'you're not gonna believe what I'm gonna
tell you.'" A pause. "I'm a bit of a story whore
in that sense," he concludes, unabashed.
The process of getting the film made was
still an ordeal, however. Hedges claims he was
more adamant than usual during the writing
phase: "When I wrote the script, I wrote it so
that I could make it... I knew when I wrote
this one that I was gonna make it if I had to pay
for it myself, and that's what helped me finish
it." Once completed, the script was shopped
around until it reached Katie Holmes, who at
tached herself to the project. But even with
Holmes on board there was a series of almost
deals that soon had Hedges doubting himself.
A deal was finally struck with InDigEnt, which
greenlit the film for DV but required that
Holmes and Patricia Clarkson both forgo then
acting fees.
Somewhere in the midst of this spiel, Katie
Holmes herself walks into the room and sits
down next to her director, but not before plac
ing a Krispy Kreme donut in front of him. She
looks so exactly like one would expect in per-

son — decent height, believably good-looking
— that I can't help but feel the slightest twinge
of disappointment. The moment is not quite
surreal enough for me; showing equal defer
ence to Hedges, she seems to join our table
more as a peer of sorts than a celebrity, with
only the small footnote that this "peer" is the
reason Dawson and Pacey have been so con
stipated for the past five years on "Dawson's
Creek."
Holmes actually ends up saying very little in
the interview, but she does provide a few semi
canned answers for why independent movies
are worth making. "I really enjoy the challenge
of doing an independent movie simply because
I feel like I can be a little more collaborative
and have a bit more fun," Holmes reveals. "A
lot of times the writing in the projects are dif
ferent, have a different take on things and you
have more freedom." She points out the con
trast of working on a show like "Dawson's
Creek," which had a very routine production
schedule and had to follow the comfy but sti
fling "parameters of a nice teen show." She's
quick to temper this with a well-rehearsed "but
it was a wonderful experience, I thoroughly en
joyed working on it," but one senses that she's
already moved on.
When asked about her best experiences
with directors she mentions Curtis Hanson
("Wonder Boys"), Kevin Williamson
("Teaching Mrs. Tingle" and "Creek" creator)
and Ang Lee ("The Ice Storm"). And just like
that, a publicist enters the room and Holmes
must leave, whisked off to the airport for un
specified reasons. During our time together,
she has managed to eat two Krispy Kreme
donuts while remaining a complete enigma.
We turn our attention back to Hedges.
What I'm struck most by is his earnest convic
tion for the importance of telling significant sto
ries, important stories that make people think.
"I like movies that are as funny as hurhanly pos
sible — humanly possible," he emphasizes.
"Not the kind of humor that's broad and makes
fun of its characters. Caricature-based story
telling doesn't interest me. I like human stories
that are very funny and sexy and angry and full
of complexity, characters that I may find myself
repulsed by but strangely attracted to. Stories
that make me embrace life... make me think
about all that I have or all that I don't have or

where the world's headed."

"Celebration," effusively describing it "as if

but always brings us back to story. "There are
