# Oakenfold trapped behind 'Great Wall'

### BRENDAN MARTEN DESK EDITOR 
There isn't much need to give a biographical sketch of Paul Oakenfold's ca
reer. After all, the guy gave birth to the modern-day clubber's obsession with
Ibiza in 1987. And 10 years later, he dredged up trance music from the under
ground and presented it to the masses in the form of his notorious mix "Tran
ceport." A household name in Europe and among techno fans across the plan
et, Oakenfold broke into the American mainstream last year courtesy of his
release "Bunkka."
With his prestigious club residencies, dozens of global tours and hundreds
of releases to his name, you'd think "Oakey" has done it all.
Well, he has. And the only problem that his "been-there-done-that" su
perstar status has presented him is that it can be difficult to know where to go
next when you've been everywhere. This uncertainty is evidenced on Oaken
fold's latest release "Great Wall." The CD doesn't travel anywhere new or in
novative, and throughout the title's two discs, Oakenfold is unwilling to com-

mit himself to a consistent sound.
The first disc features a mix reminis
cent of the classic trance exhibited in i
Oakenfold's much-revered 1996 I
"Flouro" album. It starts with Nugen's
"Darksides," a surreal-sounding song.

But the track's indolent and aimless pace

quickly transitions into the precise and deliberate tone of the second song
"Eclipse." Later are the sober and reflective sounds of "Requiem for a
Dream" and "Release" by Solarstone, which provides a slow and steady mid
session climax that never quite peaks before subsiding into the rambunctious
and feisty piece "Dirty Sticky Floors" by Dave Gahan.
Oakenfold turns toward the vibrantly flavorful and funky with the refresh
ing "De Moma De." But when he spins up a remix of "Flollywood" by Madon
na, one cannot help but feel that the listening experience has been recklessly
interrupted by a song patently out of place in the mix, adding a sense of silli
ness to an otherwise serious collection of cuts. Luckily, Oakenfold provides a
last minute save with "Mercury Skies," which restores the disc's melodic na
ture just in time for its closing.
A vastly different sound emerges on the second disc, with "Fear" by Ian
Brown setting the stage for a more melancholy mix. Bjork's "Pagan Poetry" is
reminiscent of the emotion-laden and melodramatic tracks of "Bunkka" such as
"Southern Sun" and "Zoo York." The second disc then glides into the dark and
moody "Legacy" by Infusion, which is grim, yet clear and certain in its step.
But then the session decidedly goes south with "Emit / Collect," a strange
diversion that sounds like it would better belong on an Orbital album. Tracks
like "Electrofreek" and "Loveless" lack any tuneful sound and dig the mix
deeper into a hole as it continues to lose its energy. The low of the CD set is
the atrocious remix of "Hypnotised," which sounds like a shallow 1970s disco
lounge anthem. But Oakenfold finally brings the record to a strong close with
"As the Rush Comes" â€” a lovely parting gift that provides a serene and
breathtaking exit to the stormy and troubled second disc.
All in all, "Great Wall" is a mixed bag. Oakenfold's name and talent alone
make it worthy of purchase. However, the CD is nothing new, and likely will
soon be lost among the many other less notable releases in Oakenfold's vast
record catalogue. So if you're looking for a decent trance CD, "Great Wall" is
certainly worth a spin. But if you're in search of groundbreaking electronic
style, you might have to wait until Oakenfold's next album.
