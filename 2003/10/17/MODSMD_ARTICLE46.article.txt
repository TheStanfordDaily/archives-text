# Roxy Sass: guys finish themselves

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
So you say you're a nice guy. You shower regularly, you do
nate blood, you take your vitamins and you've had permanent
blue-balls for the past seven years. Girls feel comfortable
changing in front of you. They analyze their emotional bag
gage with you on Instant Messenger. Sometimes they forget
you have a penis. Your name comes up in the dictionary under
"nice," "sensitive," "funny" and "just a friend."
You may be holding onto the glimmer of hope that one day
women will stop chasing after the bad boys and trade in raw
sexuality for emotional stability. The drop-top Beamer for the
Hyundai sedan. The Belvedere for the Safeway Eggnog. While
that may be true, keep in mind that this time will not come for
a while, and when it finally does, you — as well as the girls you
once yearned for — will be old. And we all know that old peo
ple, no matter how hard they try, are just not sexy. So what can
you do now, before the cloudy mediocrity and asexuality of old
age sets in?
Be an asshole.
Forget "Revenge of the Nerds," forget morality, forget re
ligion and the golden rule. Forget tales of the triumphant un
derdog, respect for women and John Mayer lyrics on your
away messages (her body may be a wonderland but your sorry
ass couldn't even get tickets to it off eBay). Instead, work on
releasing your inner asshole. Start by swearing. And talking
about sex. A lot. For example, a nice guy would say, "Reese
Witherspoon was so cute in 'Sweet Home Alabama.' Why
can't I find a girl like that?" Meanwhile an asshole would com
ment on the quality of the movie perhaps by using several ho
mosexual derogations, and then remark on the intensity of his
desire to consummate his lust for Ms. Witherspoon, including
explicit details of where and with what.
Get wasted as often as you can and tell as many people
about it as possible. In preparation, "Dude, I'm gonna get SO
FUCKED UP," during, "Dude, I'm SO FUCKED UP" and
afterward, "Dude, last night I was SO FUCKED UP." Cate
gorize girls based on their looks and level of promiscuity. Pick
fights with people, but make sure to target people you know
won't actually fight you. Put yourself first. Don't call but al
ways say you will.
And before you know it, the girls will be waiting to finish you.
Satire is the word of the day. Live it, learn it, love it, only to
come home after a long day at work to find it doing your best
friend, and Nancy, the office slut.
