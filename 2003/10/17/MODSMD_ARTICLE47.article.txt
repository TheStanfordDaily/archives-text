# Old Mother Hubbard's Sex Life
## 
### NICHOLAS CASEY 
Folks, it looks like Gaieties eame a little early this year — dis
guised as a ballet. This is the story of a dance company named
Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, their gig last Saturday in Mem
Aud, and yes, their attempts to outdo RanCs Head in the
evening's theme of sex, sex and more sex.
Granted: They dressed it up a bit. But does a leotard really qualify as
dressing it up? Certainly the French titles gave it sophistication, no?
They called their first pieee "Petite Mort" — but then, that's just the eu
phemism for "orgasm." I give up: It was blatant, unabashed,
unashamed. Lively .Arts indeed has been keeping this secret from the stu
dent body for too long — they stage more freak dancing 011 Saturday
nights than you had at your high sehool prom.
The scene is all too familiar: The suited and tied Palo Altan husbands
filing into MemAud, their wives bespectacled and over-perfumed. A row
ahead of you. the opera glasses have emerged from a woman's purse,
then a slight chuckle from her lips. She's seen the same thing you have
and nobody needed binoculars to do it: Jirl Kylian's choreography of the
orgasmic "Petite Mort" is unfolding, and yes, you can guess what the
erect swords were supposed to mean.
It takes no genius to divine the symbolism in this one, to find mean
ing in that gloriously giant bed sheet the men and women draw out and
dance upon. Nor does it take incredible faculty to piece apart the next
work on the program titled, quite bluntly "Kiss." The two dancers are
tied to swings, taking the opportunity to make out. They swing around
together. They lose hold of each other — oh no — but then they're to
gether again. And here is when I say: The dancing is, absolutely, fantas
tically graceful, zealously beautiful.
But here's the catch: Hubbard never got past the sex. Now I love eroti
cism as much as the next person, but as is typical of my kind, the physi
cal leads me craving the metaphysical. Hubbard Street never got past
their titles. Their "Kiss" was a kiss, their "Petite Mort" an orgasm, their
"Cor Perdut," as the French indicates, the story of a lost heart. Their
choreography was to marvel, their costuming gorgeous, but concepts
didn't sail as far as I'd hoped a modern Chicago company would take
them. So instead, I'm left waiting for those that dance (or try to) in Mem
Aud and sing songs about sex without apologies. No choreographic pre
tenses — I'm talking about Gaeities.
