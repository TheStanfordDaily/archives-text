# SF Opera involved in high infidelity
## Renowned company mounts adulterous double-bill . 
### HART GILULA 
The San Francisco Opera's revival of
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" and
Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" made a number of
concessions at this Sunday's matinee, while
still retaining the Italian spirit of opera's

most redoubtable dou
ble-bill.
Since Ponelle pre
miered this production
in 1976, subsequent di
rectors have excised!
Jean-Pierre Ponelle's
cross-bearing repen-

ters without any loss of dramatic intensity.
The same was true tonight. In addition, the
pantomime that was scheduled to open
"Pagliacci" was cancelled due to an injury.
I was most disappointed, however, to learn
that Catherine Naglestad was suffering from
bronchitis. I had been looking forward to her
performance since her stunning debut in last
season's "Alcina." Naglestad chose to go on as
Nedda despite the announced sickness and she
coped admirably as the oppressed wife of an em
bittered clown. Her fearless stage presence
brought the performance up a notch, though she
was noticeably holding back the vocal goods.
As for the setting, Ponelle updated both
operas to 1930s Italy, three decades after
their premieres - though I'm not really sure
how replacing the clown troupe's cart with a
truck served the drama.

Ponelle's long-time assistant Vera Lucia
Calabria directed the revival, but was unable
to coax compelling performances from the
entire-cast.
While Andrea Gruber sang a passable
Santuzza, her singing was unnecessarily
heavy, producing noticeable pitch problems
on sustained notes.
Further, although adultery and jealousy
drive both operas, the rival "Cavalleria"
lovers, Turiddu and Alfio (played by Anto
nio Nagore and Anthony Michaels-Moore,
respectively) didn't seem particularly en
raged over all of that illicit, operatic nookie.

Michaels-Moore served
double duty, also performing
Tonio in "Pagliacci," a role
in which he seemed much
more comfortable. His Pro
logue aria was fine (sans
originally-scheduled pan
tomime troupe) but his sub-

sequent characterization some-

times crossed the too-buffoonish line.
Jon Fredric West sang his way through
Canio (after nearly not surviving last season's
"Othello") with a heartfelt "Vesti la giubba."
The best singing of the afternoon came from
James Westman, who sang Silvio with a rich,
easily produced sound that excellently served
his well-rounded characterization.
Marco Armiliato led the Opera orchestra
in a vibrant performance. The chorus, which
always sounds good, was particularly on top
of its game this Sunday, balancing the after
noon's prolific infidelity with religious fervor
in "Cavalleria" and explosive excitement in
"Pagliacci."
Note: The last performance of the Cav/Pag
double bill is tonight at 8 PM.
