# Sexploitation at the SF MOMA?
## Regan Louise's sex photography displayed at SF MOMA 
### CHRIS MEYER 
"It's just obscene," a middle-aged woman mutters with disdain.
"Those poor girls are being exploited. How could the mu
seum show this ... it's pornography."
I overheard this comment by another museumgoer before
I entered "The Photographs of Reagan Louie: Sex Work in
Asia," a controversial photography exhibit currently on dis
play at SFMOMA until Dec 7.
Louie, a fifth-generation Chinese-American, spent six
years traveling to different parts of Asia to photograph prosti
tutes in their working environments. The show includes pho
tos of "working girls" in China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and
Korea. His color prints are unframed on aluminum panels, all
at the same height and of the same size. They line the gallery
walls like a giant filmstrip.
The exhibit's opening wall panel tries to establish the im
portance of Louie's photographs by citing other examples of
famous artwork that allude to prostitution such as Titian's
"Venus of Urbino," Manet's "Olympia," and Picasso's
"Demoiselles d'Avignon." "Sex Work in Asia" is hardly a
worthy successor to those iconic images and it is a mistake for
the exhibit to set itself up as the continuation of some grand
master narrative of Western art.

He photographs naked young women in various ways:
Some act seductively by posing in erotic ways for the camera,
some stand matter-of-factly and stare blankly back at the
viewer, some are seen doing such mundane activities as watch

ing television, or even having sex with clients.
So what point is Louie trying to make and what is his rela
tionship to these women? One wall panel is a direct statement
by the artist. "I wanted to explore relationships between men
and women in Asia, and to compare them with Western rela
tionships and stereotypes about the East," Louie says. "And
though I would primarily photograph sex workers, the largest
subject was modern Asian women."
If we are to judge the exhibit based on the artist's own criteria,
then "Sex Work in Asia" is mostly a failure. Louie's comments,
combined with built-in associations inherent to the photographic
medium, lead us to expect the show to be documentary-like in
feel. But do we really know more about these women and then
lives leaving the exhibit than we did going in? The photos tell us
more about Louie's attractions than they do about the women
themselves.

The relationship of these women to the viewer is never quite
clear, but it is never one of equality. The viewer is clearly meant to
be male because the prostitutes are all women; it would have been
interesting for Louie to include some male prostitutes, presum
ably also part of the Asian sex industry. Moreover, he makes it
clear that the photos are all "collaborative" — he only took pic
tures of those women who consented.

Thus, rather than exploring Western stereotypes of exoticized
Asian women, he only perpetuates them. These women's appear
ances and actions are aimed towards creating a sexually alluring
image, in many cases to attract traveling Western businessmen.
"Couple, Hong Kong, 2000," which shows an Asian woman kiss
ing a balding blond Caucasian man, testifies to this fact.
Ironically, the most interesting photos in "Sex Work in
Asia" show no people. "Bed and Pictures, T'ai-nan, 1997"
shows the private space of one of the prostitutes. A collage of
photos mounted above the bed tells us more about the absent
woman than many of Louie's portraits of the women's faces
and bodies.
