"Luke Powell. He led the team in
passing against BYU, didn't he?"

Matt Babin's column appears every Monday. E-mail
him at babin@ stanford.edu if you think Powell should
make the switch to field general.

The guy is unstoppable. You can't stop him. You

E-mail him at popters@stanford.edu and make
fun of him for actually losing to a graduate
school intramural team.

"Tyrone. Is there a better coach?
I submit there is not."

Look for Brett Brechis' column every Wednesday.
E-mail him at bbechis@stanford.edu and give him
hell for not actually answering the question.

and potatoe salad to go with my burger. I don't want
either! I want fries and I want Ryan Eklund."

E-mail him at ssallen@stanforrd.edu if you
agree that Eklund is the right way to go.
