# Football is more than capable
## 
### 
Alumni: If you're just now
joining us, let me intro
duce you to our way of
looking at the Stanford
football team's performance this
year.
Unless you're one of the lucky stu
dents who was present during Stan
ford football's heyday of the early '70s
— and used few enough drugs that
you still remember your time here —

our current attitude
will probably be|
quite familiar to I
you.
To put it crude-1
ly, we're mainly r
just hoping thek
team doesn't suckl
too much to win I
Big Game.
No one thought L
the Cardinal would

go to the Rose Bowl this year. No
one expected it to compete for the
Pacific-10 Conference title. No one
is shocked every Monday when the
Top 25 rankings come out and Stan
ford is missing from the list.
So we undergrads aren't pulling
our nascent facial hair out over the
Cardinal's 2-2 record going into this
weekend's game. The losses have
come on the road, against heavily fa
vored opponents. The wins have given
people hope that last year's 2-9 Axe
losing debacle was an aberration.
If Stanford drops tomorrow's
game 38-14, showing flashes of po
tential amid an otherwise under
whelming performance, it won't
ruin Homecoming Weekend.
Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens will talk about what a great
team Washington State has, how the
Cougars played well in all facets of
the game and how Stanford's play
ers can glean important lessons from
the defeat. And he's a really nice
guy, so people will just nod then
heads and smile.
A few of you alumni might pick
yourselves up from the floor Sunday
morning and (after you figure out
where you are and why you smell
like stale Sierra Nevada) reflect fog
gily on how the Cardinal has fallen
off since the good ol' days of Don
Bunce and the Thunderchickens.
The majority of you won't give a
second sober thought to the loss.
We're Stanford: We do physics, not
football.
But some things have changed.
Over the last two decades, Stanford
has evolved into a college sports

mecca, and mediocrity in any form is
no longer tolerated at the "Home of
Champions."
And when you consider that ex-
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will
ingham and Teevens have pulled in
several nationally ranked recruiting
classes in recent years, there's little
reason for it to continue on the foot
ball field.
Yes, I did just imply that Stanford
now possesses top-level talent. As
much or more than Washington
State, who is currently ranked No. 6
in the nation and is a double-digit fa
vorite to beat the Cardinal in Stan
ford Stadium tomorrow.
Four of Stanford's 2001 recruits
— this year's juniors — were
ranked in the Top 40 nationally that
year, and quarterback Trent Ed
wards was the number one quarter
back in the 2002 class.
So it's not as if we're sending a
team of Stephen Hawkings out there
to get slaughtered by the big bad
jocks from State U. We shouldn't be
reduced to chanting, "That's alright,
that's OK, you'll all work for us
someday."
In a reversal for a team that used
to be known for overcoming its
physical limitations with scrappiness
and smarts, Stanford is not playing
up to its potential. The roster is full
of track stars, decathletes and blue
chippers — not the kind of players
who consider themselves lucky just
to be on the same field with their
Pac-10 competition.
Granted, they are young and thin
on the offensive line, but that's
about the only unit that doesn't yet
have the capability to compete on
even footing with nationally ranked
opponents.
Washington State has great play
ers, but so does Stanford. Our guys
know there's no good reason why
they should be considered under
dogs — but they have yet to prove
that to the fans.
A loss on Saturday wouldn't be
unforgivable. But for a team that
would like to shed its longtime repu
tation as a Pac-10 patsy, it sure
would be nice to shock both us and
you alumni with a big, fat, dominat
ing win.

Will Oremus is a senior majoring in
philosophy. He too, hopes to wake
up smelling of Sierra Nevada after
Saturday's game. E-mail him at ore
