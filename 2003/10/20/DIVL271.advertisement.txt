Nature's Magic:
Synergy in Evolution and
the Fate of Humankind
by Peter Corning
Wednesday, October 22,2003 • 7 PM
In Nature's Magic Peter Corning states that synergy-a vaguely familiar term to
many of us-has been a wellspring of creativity in the natural world and has played
a key role in the evolution of cooperation and complexity at all levels, from physics
and chemistry to the latest human technologies. The 'Synergism Hypothesis'
asserts that synergy is more than a class of interesting and übiquitous effects. It
has also been a major causal agency in evolution; it represents a unifying expla
nation for biological complexity and represents a different perspective on the evo
lutionary process. In contrast to gene-centered theories, or postulates of self
organization and emergent 'laws' of complexity, the Synergism Hypothesis repre
sents, in essence, an 'economic' (or bio-economic) theory of complexity. Peter A.
Corning, Ph.D., is the Director of the Institute for the Study of Complex Systems in
Palo Alto, California. He has published numerous research papers and articles and
three previous books, one of which was a theoretical monograph on the role of
synergy in evolution, The Synergism Hypothesis: A Theory of Progressive Evolution
