Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
spoke Saturday morning as part of a panel dissect
ing the origin and power of the United States Con
stitution. The discussion, titled "We the People,"
was moderated by Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
School of Law and a constitutional law expert.
The panel included Law Profs. Pamela Karlan
and Lawrence Lessig and History Prof. Jack
Rakove. All three have contributed to constitu
tional scholarship in recent years.
Opening the presentation with a reading of the
preamble to the Constitution, Sullivan asked the
panel members to state their own interpretations of
the framers' words.
"The answer for [Americans] was their own sov
ereignty," Kennedy said. "They needed to make a
traumatic break from England."
"They knew we could not be free until we had
our own identity," he added. "The framers had a
very special challenge. They had to state this idea in
a convincing way."
The panelists all acknowledged the vague lan
guage of the preamble as the framers' strategy to
allow for looser interpretations of the Constitution.
The ambiguity was largely intentional to allow
states to create more specific laws.
"The idea that you could submit a document to
ratification by the states was a brilliant idea,"
Rakove said. "In 1788, it was an amazing example
of the democratic process."
Kennedy explained that before the Constitution
was completed, the United States was always re
ferred to in the plural form. The use of the singular
"we the people" instead of "we the peoples" sug
gested a new national unity.
While panelists emphasized the centralized na
ture of the document, they also discussed its provi
sions for American individuality.
"The framers were children of the enlighten
ment," Kennedy said. "It introduced the idea that
you could create your own destiny, build your own
life."
At the time the Constitution was developed,
federalism was both a novel and risky idea.
