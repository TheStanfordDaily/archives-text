Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
spoke Saturday morning as part of a panel dissect
ing the origin and power of the United States Con
stitution. The discussion, titled "We the People,"
was moderated by Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
School of Law and a constitutional law expert.
The panel included Law Profs. Pamela Karlan
and Lawrence Lessig and History Prof. Jack
Rakove. All three have contributed to constitu
tional scholarship in recent years.
Opening the presentation with a reading of the
preamble to the Constitution, Sullivan asked the
panel members to state their own interpretations of
the framers' words.
"The answer for [Americans] was their own sov
ereignty," Kennedy said. "They needed to make a
traumatic break from England."
"They knew we could not be free until we had
our own identity," he added. "The framers had a
very special challenge. They had to state this idea in
a convincing way."
The panelists all acknowledged the vague lan
guage of the preamble as the framers' strategy to
allow for looser interpretations of the Constitution.
The ambiguity was largely intentional to allow
states to create more specific laws.
"The idea that you could submit a document to
ratification by the states was a brilliant idea,"
Rakove said. "In 1788, it was an amazing example
of the democratic process."
Kennedy explained that before the Constitution
was completed, the United States was always re
ferred to in the plural form. The use of the singular
"we the people" instead of "we the peoples" sug
gested a new national unity.
While panelists emphasized the centralized na
ture of the document, they also discussed its provi
sions for American individuality.
"The framers were children of the enlighten
ment," Kennedy said. "It introduced the idea that
you could create your own destiny, build your own
life."
At the time the Constitution was developed,
federalism was both a novel and risky idea.
"Federalism was the unique cre
ation of the framers," Kennedy said.
"It had an ethical and moral impera
tive that no one should give up power
to a central government that would
control their destiny."
According to Karlan, it is impor
tant to acknowledge that the famed
"We the people" did not include
everyone residing in the colonies at
the time of independence.
"If you go back to 1787 and ask
who this 'We the people' were, we
limited the vote to men, we limited
the vote to whites, we limited the
vote to landowners," she said. "Some
of these people have been included
as a result of constitutional amend
ments.
"Each generation of people has
had to give meaning to these phras
es," she added.
The panelists later turned their at
tention to what has kept the Consti
tution applicable for the past 200
years.
"The Supreme Court has done so
much to keep the document alive,"

Lessig said. "The justices on the right
and the left have made a continuous
effort to translate the spirit of the
Constitution."
Using the Internet as an example
of rapid and dramatic change in the
modern United States, Lessig said
that many of the original constitu
tional amendments are still relevant
today.
"When you think about the Inter
net and the first amendment and the
freedom of the press, the framers re
ally did have the Internet in mind,"
Lessig said. "They saw the press as
being decentralized, unregulated
and radical."
The conversation shifted from a
dissection of the Constitution to an
evaluation of the century's significant
Supreme Court decisions, primarily
Brown vs. Board of Education.
"Brown vs. Board was a great de
cision, but it came after Truman inte
grated the military, it came after a
war that fundamentally changed how
we view race," Karlan said.
In discussing Brown and the pre
ceding Plessy vs. Ferguson case,
which set the foundation for the
"separate but equal" doctrine,
Kennedy added, "We are blind to the
inequities of our own times."
Lessig pointed to the court as the

branch of government that gives the
Constitution meaning and context in
American society.
"People have thought that we
could move the Constitution into
Russian or German and it would
work the same way," he said. "But
really we need to create a sense of
norms, understandings and culture
to make it work."
Sullivan asked the panelists to dis
cuss the influence of the U.S. Consti
tution on political developments in
other countries.
"Americans believe our Constitu
tion is the golden standard for the
world, but everyone has a different way
to develop allegiance to law," Kennedy
said. "For us, law is empowering and
gives people freedom, the ability to cre
ate. TTie farther east you got, the more
authoritarian it becomes."
Kennedy concluded the discus
sion, acknowledging the importance
of political and civic engagement in
keeping the Constitution alive in the
new millennium.
"A democracy will fail if there
isn't a will to uphold its universal val
ues," he said. "It requires people to
be interested and knowledgeable
about the Constitution."
Constitutional law will be the
main focus of a new center within the

law school, which Sulhvan will head
when she steps down from her cur
rent position at the end of the acade
mic year. The center will seek to edu
cate people about the spirit of the
document and its influence on
today's society.
"It will aim to attract constitutional
scholars to Stanford for lectures and
conferences," Sullivan said. "It will
serve as a convening forum to bring to
gether academics, judges and lawyers
to discuss constitutional matters."
According to Sullivan, these experts
will participate in litigation and public
advocacy on constitutional issues and
produce media events such as televised
panels, moot courts and debates.
Sullivan's decision to leave her
post as dean was the result of her de
sire to tackle significant constitution
al issues.
"When I took the position in 1999,
I committed to one term of five years
which ends next year, always intend
ing to return to the life of writing
about, teaching and practicing consti
tutional law," she said. "The constitu
tional issues now facing our society
have become so vexing and in need of
attention that it was the right move."
Following a year-long sabbatical,
Sulhvan plans to return to full-time
teaching at the law school in 2005.
