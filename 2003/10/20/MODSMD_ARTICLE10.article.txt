(U-WIRE) ARLINGTON, Texas —The recent
drug overdose incident involving two University of
Texas-Arlington women's softball team members
ties into an national increase of GHB use.
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or "liquid ecstasy," has
gained popularity as a club drug during the last 10
years, according to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. Reports show 20 reported cases of use in
1992. By 1999, the number had risen to nearly 3,000
among teens and young adults.
More than 60 deaths have been tied to the drug
when used in combination with alcohol use since
March 2000. A special report concerning "G," as it is
also known, revealed that 20- to 29-year-olds com
prised nearly 60 percent of those deaths. It's preva
lent at late night parties, night clubs and raves.
GHB's primary uses are to induce euphoric feel
ings, to enhance sexual performance and enhance
athletic ability, said Diane Snow, assistant nursing
professor. The drug also contains a growth hormone

that builds muscles.
The government began collecting most of its in
formation about GHB in2ooo when its use became il
legal. Long-term studies haven't been performed on
the drug, and many emergency room doctors don't
recognize its symptoms, she said.
"It's scary because not enough is known yet, posi
tive or negative, about it," University Wellness Di
rector Carrie Lutter said. "My husband, a medical
resident, experienced an incident where a student
using GHB had a mild heart attack."
Die drug is a central nervous system depressant
that causes the heart rate to slow down and gives feel
ings of happiness and small bursts of energy. Mixing
it with alcohol makes it more dangerous, Snow said.
"Many students who don't use drugs find their
judgment changes when they drink and will take a
drug for the first time on impulse," she said.
Snow, the president of the International Nurses
Society on Addictions, said athletes tend to use it not
only because it builds muscles but because it effects
the body within 10 to 20 minutes and leaves the body
within four hours.

"If an athlete is facing a drug screening tomorrow,
the drug can be used today and no trace will be found
in the screening," she said.
Although university athletic officials and team
members couldn't be reached concerning the inci
dent, a former Lady Mavericks team member said
the news took her by surprise.
"I've never seen drug use at any UTA sports
function," Jessica Carriger said. "During my three
years on the team, I hung out with a lot of the ath
letes at parties and at games. I didn't ever hear of
any athletes using drugs."
Carriger also said that drug use was out of
character for the two players named in the recent
report: sophomore infielders Jenna Fortune and
Natalie Mullin.
Dean of Students Austin Lane said he can't pro
ceed in matters involving discipline for drug abuse
until receiving a disciplinary referral from the affect
ed department. Lane is conducting an investigation
into the overdose report, documented with the Ar
lington Police Department, but said he doesn't know
what action the Athletics Department will pursue.
