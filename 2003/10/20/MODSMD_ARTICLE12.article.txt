## Homecoming weekend a success 
### 
Thousands of nostalgic alumni
flocked to campus for Homecoming
weekend. The three-day event,
which ended on Saturday, was the
result of hard work from the Alumni Associ
ation and the coordinators who put Home
coming together.
We believe that the weekend was an all
around success, in that it allowed Stanford
graduates a chance to reconnect with the
campus and provided current students with
a valuable opportunity to network with
those outside the confines of the Stanford
bubble.
For current students, Homecoming can
seem like a nuisance. Alumni wander around
campus, crowding into their former resi
dences to see how things have changed. They
start up conversations about their former
lives as students. They also bring a lot of traf
fic to Campus Drive.
But Homecoming is also invaluable for its
ability to keep networking alive for both

alumni and current students. Alumni visit
with old friends, acquaintances from classes
and their former dorm neighbors. They also
see the next generation of Stanford students
soon to be alumni themselves who will
benefit greatly from alumni networks and
connections.
Perhaps most importantly, last weekend
helped acknowledge the importance of alum
ni efforts in fund-raising. Gifts to the Univer
sity allow current operation and future ex
pansion to continue. Thus, Homecoming
weekend is a way for the current students of
Stanford and the Alumni Association to
thank alumni for their contributions to the
University and to let them have a chance to
have fun with their old friends.
We must remember and recognize that the
time and effort put into the weekend is not
superfluous it is important to the success
and prosperity of this school. Soon, we too
will return to campus for this very special re
union on the Farm.
