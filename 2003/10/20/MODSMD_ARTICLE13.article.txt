# Renovation makes for a beautiful drive
## 
### 
This summer, the University renovat
ed Campus Drive between Roth
Way and Via Ortega. As work nears
completion, crews are planting trees
in the median of Campus Drive. We applaud
the University's efforts to maintain the cam
pus' attractive appearance.
Despite inconveniences to drivers, bikers
and pedestrians, the project's benefits will
far outweigh the inconveniences it has
caused in the past few months. Landscaping
the campus with plenty of trees and other

plants is not only good for the environment,
but such efforts are important for campus
visitors, residents and employees. Beautiful
roadways help reduce stress and road rage,
and make the road a more pleasant place for
everyone.
We hope that the University continues to
do such work in the future and remembers
that academic buildings and offices aren't
the only places in need of attention. This
time, Stanford took the road less travelled,
and it made all the difference.
