Full Moon on the Quad
should be canceled
In the interest of assigning con
sistent punishments to student
run organizations, the University
should ban Full Moon on the
Quad next year. Additionally, the
Senior Class Presidents, the
ASSU and the Office of Student
Activities should be put be put on
alcohol probation by the Organi
zational Conduct Review Board
(the latter obviously being a moot
point). This might be more easily
seen than done since the Conduct
Review Board is administered by
the Office of Student Activities.
This might come across as being a
little ridiculous, but let's look at
the facts. Any fraternity on cam
pus that is not on probation will
easily throw five to six parties in an
average academic year. The ag
gregate number of people attend
ing those five to six parties will un
doubtedly be over 3,000.
However, if there is even one al
cohol related incident (not four stu
dents going to the hospital, a DUI
and an arrest for public drunken
ness), the hosts of that event risk
various types of probations.
Additionally, it hardly seems rea
sonable to me that when the orga
nizers of Full Moon on the Quad ex
pected such a large crowd that they
only provided nine professionally
trained authorities (three deputies
from Department of Public Safety
and six members of Stanford's Spe
cial Event Patrol) to oversee the
event. Fraternities are required to
have at least six security guards for
parties in which they expect 500 or so
attendees. How can the Office of
Student Activities reasonably ex
pect Row residents to adhere to such
high standards when they them
selves cannot meet those same stan
dards when organizing an event?
In reality, I think that Full
Moon on the Quad was a huge suc
cess with its 4 / 3,000 ratio, but that
is not the standard by which the
Office of Student Activities holds
other student organizations. I

agreed with the ASSU president,
vice president and the Senior
Class Presidents in Wednesday's
editorial when they said that they
found it hard to control the per
sonalities and actions of every at
tendee, but this has never been an
accepted excuse for the fraterni
ties. Hopefully, the administration
will learn that no matter how care
fully an event is planned, it will
never be perfect and that their
newfound policies are only pro
moting students to binge drink be
hind closed doors.
The point that I am trying to
make is not that Full Moon on the
Quad should really be canceled,
but that the Conduct Review
Board and the Office of Student
Activities should think twice be
fore condemning Greek organiza
tions when their members or
guests commit equally "egre
gious" acts.
Hopefully, the powers-that-be
will recognize the simple fact that
each individual must be judged by
his or her own actions and that we
cannot always attribute these "in
cidents" to some external influ
ence (poor planning, poor crisis
management, etc.). Students must
be expected to behave in a manner
befitting a responsible young
adult, and it seems that although
many organizers do, a portion of
attendees do not adhere to the
same principle.

Alcohol Policy is not defendable
Junior Emilia Toledo seems to
think that she can mount a de
fense for the administration and
its oppressive new policies on ap
peals to personal responsibility /
accountability ("Students must
take responsibility for drinking,"
Oct. 16). Remarkably enough,
she goes the length of congratu
lating them for filling the Alcohol
Policy void of yesteryear. In
doing so, she has identified her

self as either or both of two mali
cious campus minorities.
I'm anxious to figure out
whether she belongs to the subset
of the student body who revel in
the misery of their peers, who sali
vate over thoughts of extending
Green Library's walls to the outer
edge of Campus Drive so they'll
be able to shush anyone who rais
es his or her voice for any non-aca
demic end; or is she just a Resi
dential Education agent em
ployed to circulate propaganda
that people actually do exist who
think they're doing a good job?
Otherwise, I have no idea where
she's coming from.
Perhaps someone from another
planet could look at the facts of
the matter and applaud the people
at the root of the problem. The
campus this year is not safer, but it
is definitely lamer and more pater
nalistic. What business does Tole
do have for congratulating the ad
ministration in the same letter
where she calls for accountability
from individuals? My understand
ing of the purpose of ResEd and
the Dean of Students is to maxi
mize safety and quality of life. If
they fail at both, are they really de
serving of congratulations, ap
proval ... or their jobs?
It's interesting that Toledo
credits the rise in alcohol incidents
of this year to shortcomings in in
dividual responsibility. It's not a
ludicrous claim that students are
less responsible this year than in
the past few years? I would expect
a sociology major to understand
the effects of poorly thought-out
policy changes that impact a fairly
large population.
Clearly, no one is "forcing"
anyone to drink. But there's noth
ing to do in Palo Alto, and there's
now nothing to do on campus.
Connect the dots: People are not
going to stop drinking because you
or ResEd want them to. You'd
have to be drunk to think so.
