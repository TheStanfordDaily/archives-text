## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK Bush better watch out in Britain 
### 
7-OUNG BLOOD!"
/ roars the leader of the
¥ Free Socialists as he
gives my back a
hearty thump. "Good!"
Looking around the Oxford city
courtroom a cavernous, slightly in
timidating venue for an anti-Bush
protest meeting I'm surprised to
see that I'm definitely the youngest
person here, and probably the only
American as well.
Most of the other protesters are in
their 30s, male and much more re
served than the Free Socialist, who,
upon arrival, bounded up to the de
fendant box and announced in an
awestruck voice, "In 1977,1 stood in
this very place! I was a professional
shoplifter at the time."
It's 7:40 p.m. the meeting
should have started by now, but since
less than 20 people are in attendance,
the organizers wait for stragglers. A
man who looks like he's pushing 80
ambles in, wearing a damp, musty
coat that I can smell from a jury
bench away. At first I'm amazed:
He's the oldest activist I've ever
seen! But it turns out he's just at the
wrong meeting.
A handful of people trickle in as
the minutes crawl by (including the
old man, who couldn't find his meet
ing and re-entered the courtroom
mumbling, "Verrrry good to stop
the Star Wars thing"); and finally,
George Rowe, leader of Oxford's
Stop the War Coalition, gets up to
speak.
"As if killing thousands and thou
sands of innocent people in Iraq wasn't
enough," he begins, "Tony Blair has
added insult to injury by inviting the
George Bush, the war-mongering

chief of the world, to this country. Just
imagine! He'll probably be paraded in
horse-drawn carriages alongside the
Queen... and discussing over dinner
which countries to bomb next."
Rowe then outlines the format of
the protests, which
are set to take
place locally in Ox
ford and nationally
in London during
Bush's visit in
November. "Bush
will probably stay
in London all three
days," he specu
lates. "Oxford's
anti-war move
ment was very
strong, so he won't likely stop by here
... But then, George Bush and Ox
ford, those two don't really go togeth
er, do they?" The crowd chuckles ap
preciatively.
"Bush is a bitch!" cries the Free So
cialist after Rowe opens the floor for
suggestions.
A pear-shaped baby-boomer rais
es his hand. "Now, I'm not anti-
Semitic, not by any means," he drawls,
"but when will the Star of David be on
the American flag? Let's wave an
American flag and replace the stars
with Stars of David."
He pauses while the rest of us won
der how in the world that suggestion
could be taken as not anti-Semitic.
Rowe clears his throat, "Er, well, yes,
there are a lot of people who hate
George Bush. We don't need to get
bogged down by details of why they
hate him. We should work on mobiliz
ing the public as a whole."
In response, someone proposes
holding a citywide mock election

where people can vote for Blair, Bush
or "None of the above" for the next
British prime minister, showing how
cozy Blair and Bush really are. This
makes me happy to hear: It's fine to
hate President Bush and his war, but
just because he started it doesn't mean
that Blair doesn't suck too.
A red-haired woman with a voice
as soft as a kitten suggests we demon
strate at the American embassy. "Is
this an anti-American protest as
well?" she asks.
"Nooo," Rowe says haltingly,
"but we do need to send a message
to the American electorate showing
the lack of British support for Bush
and the war."
The man sitting next to me shouts,
"Perhaps we could queue at the Star
bucks in city center and take a piss on
it after the demonstration!" I shift
guiltily in my seat while the others
laugh, thinking of the caramel Frap
puccino I had this morning.
As organizers compile some of the
better suggestions, we're given letters
to sign and send to Tony Blair with the
heading, "George W. Bush not wel
come here."
By the meeting's end, the final
agenda for the demonstrations has yet
to be completed, but no matter what
happens in Oxford, one thing is for
sure: When Bush comes to London on
Nov. 17, thousands of angry Brits will
be there to meet him. Insulting signs
will be waved, various types of pro
duce will be hurled and effigies will be
toppled and torched. It will be a fine,
fine mess indeed.

Are there any neo-cons left at Stanford?

the Star Wars thing"); and finally,
George Rowe, leader of Oxford's
Stop the War Coalition, gets up to
speak.
"As if killing thousands and thou
sands of innocent people in Iraq wasn't
enough," he begins, "Tony Blair has
added insult to injury by inviting the
George Bush, the war-mongering

chief of the world, to this country. Just
imagine! He'll probably be paraded in
horse-drawn carriages alongside the
Queen... and discussing over dinner
which countries to bomb next."
Rowe then outlines the format of
the protests, which
are set to take
place locally in Ox
ford and nationally
in London during
Bush's visit in
November. "Bush
will probably stay
in London all three
days," he specu
lates. "Oxford's
anti-war move
ment was very
strong, so he won't likely stop by here
... But then, George Bush and Ox
ford, those two don't really go togeth
er, do they?" The crowd chuckles ap
preciatively.
"Bush is a bitch!" cries the Free So
cialist after Rowe opens the floor for
suggestions.
A pear-shaped baby-boomer rais
es his hand. "Now, I'm not anti-
Semitic, not by any means," he drawls,
"but when will the Star of David be on
the American flag? Let's wave an
American flag and replace the stars
with Stars of David."
He pauses while the rest of us won
der how in the world that suggestion
could be taken as not anti-Semitic.
Rowe clears his throat, "Er, well, yes,
there are a lot of people who hate
George Bush. We don't need to get
bogged down by details of why they
hate him. We should work on mobiliz
ing the public as a whole."
In response, someone proposes
holding a citywide mock election

where people can vote for Blair, Bush
or "None of the above" for the next
British prime minister, showing how
cozy Blair and Bush really are. This
makes me happy to hear: It's fine to
hate President Bush and his war, but
just because he started it doesn't mean
that Blair doesn't suck too.
A red-haired woman with a voice
as soft as a kitten suggests we demon
strate at the American embassy. "Is
this an anti-American protest as
well?" she asks.
"Nooo," Rowe says haltingly,
"but we do need to send a message
to the American electorate showing
the lack of British support for Bush
and the war."
The man sitting next to me shouts,
"Perhaps we could queue at the Star
bucks in city center and take a piss on
it after the demonstration!" I shift
guiltily in my seat while the others
laugh, thinking of the caramel Frap
puccino I had this morning.
As organizers compile some of the
better suggestions, we're given letters
to sign and send to Tony Blair with the
heading, "George W. Bush not wel
come here."
By the meeting's end, the final
agenda for the demonstrations has yet
to be completed, but no matter what
happens in Oxford, one thing is for
sure: When Bush comes to London on
Nov. 17, thousands of angry Brits will
be there to meet him. Insulting signs
will be waved, various types of pro
duce will be hurled and effigies will be
toppled and torched. It will be a fine,
fine mess indeed.
