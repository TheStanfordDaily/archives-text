# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Fuzzies forgotten at CDC career fair 
### 
Careers: Not just for techies
anymore? I concur with The
Daily's recent editorial
("CDC should help out
fuzzies more," Oct. 17), as there were
more than a few fuzzies that felt left
out at last week's career fair. Stu
dents were exposed to opportunities
in business, engineering, public rela
tions and banking. In fact, I think the
fair was unintentionally biased to
wards people with practical, mar
ketable skills.
As an English major, I guess I felt
left out. There wasn't a single booth
for starving writers declaring "your
illustrious future as a pizza delivery
guy." Let's face it: Until I get that
book published or I can write this
drivel for a living, I'm not going to
be looking at Wells Fargo, but
rather, Wal-Mart or possibly
even Wei-Fare to make ends
meet.
In light of this, I needed to bright
en my spirits. I looked around and
there it was! My inspiration! My ray
of sunshine! The happiest business in
the entire world! I leapt no, frol
icked â€” over to the Internal Rev
enue Service booth.
Now, I realize that the IRS is
going to own my ass in a few years.
My love of Faberge egg omelets and
pudding will ensure that I know the
IRS very intimately. Thus, I figured
if I could get on their good side now,
I might be in a better position to ne
gotiate my future later ("Please
don't foreclose on my apartment, I
swear my next column will sell!").
The lady at the agency's booth
was very kind and warm, clad in a
black suit that seemed to cool down
the 85 degree heat considerably. I

calmly asked her, "Hey, as a hu
morist, what kind of career options
are there at the IRS?"
I heard the wheels turning, like a
medieval drawbridge being pulled
back. She smiled. "Well, if you take
15 units of accounting, you can get
your foot in the door."
She obviously wasn't getting it.
"No, no. You misunderstand. I'm
hoping to give the IRS a new image,
a 'we'll amuse you while we audit'
type of thing."
She handed me a brochure and
repeated that I should try to take 15
units of accounting as the only way
to get my foot in the door. This all
wasn't going how I planned, so I
thanked the lady and took her pam
phlet.
As it turned out, the brochure
was actually quite informative. It
seemed that some Enghsh major had
already beaten me to it: The
brochure was putting a new spin on
the good ol' IRS. Instead of accoun
tants in cubicles, there were pictures
of dramatized crime scenes. IRS
agents, the math-oriented versions
of "Homicide: Life on the Streets,"
were busting down the doors of the
criminal underworld. There were
pictures of mock criminals looking
wide-eyed and gaping at the ingenu
ity and force of the IRS agents. I
could tell all of them were scared be
cause they all wore the same "deer
in-headlights" meets "Dopey-from-
Snow-White" look.
(On a related note, all of you
Stanford actors to be, I know one
place where you can find work.)
Anyhoo, it seems the IRS has
changed and I was too late to do any
thing about it. Well, there was an

other career option to file under
"distant dreams" right next to the
previous entries of "pudding taster"
and "professional wise ass." So I
continued my walk around the ca
reer fair. But I didn't find anything
that was as appealing as action
packed accounting.
There wasn't any booth for
Time, Mad Magazine or sigh
House and Garden. Oh, how I've
dreamed of being a low-paid temp
at any of those periodicals! And be
cause I have an interest in history
and psychology, I looked for possi
ble careers in those lines as well.
There was no History Channel
booth offering a job as Roger
Mudd's personal masseuse. There
was no psychology stand with
brochures on how to be a shrink to
the stars. And even sadder, no one
passed out applications for the sec
ond Stanford Prison experiment. So
basically, with all my fuzzy fields of
interest, I got zilch. Nothing. I
stared heartbroken at the rows upon
rows of representatives for all of
these high-paying, secure jobs.
Fair planners, I humbly suggest
that you try to have a wider palette
when you select your representa
tives for the fall. It would be nice if
next fall there was career represen
tation for people who are interested
in pursuing literature, history, psy
chology or if humanly possible
philosophy.
