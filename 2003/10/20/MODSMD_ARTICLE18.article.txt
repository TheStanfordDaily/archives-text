## Sad about the Sox? Well, I'm a Tigers fan 
### 
In recent weeks, there has been a great deal
of self-indulgent bemoaning of the Boston
Red Sox's and Chicago Cubs' cursed
plights. And while I appreciate the pain a
monumental choke can produce, I still think
those fans need a little perspective.
I mean, the Sox won 95 games. That's well over
two times the amount of games my beloved De
troit Tigers won. They went to the seventh game of
the American League Championship Series. The
Tigers haven't made the playoffs since 1987, and
they just suffered their 10th straight losing season.
Now, I know a successful regular season
doesn't mean fans are going to go home happy in
October. I'm from Chicago, so I know the pain
that Cubs fans are experiencing right now as
their team accomplished the impossible by
somehow managing to take their long, incredi
ble history of playoff chokes to yet another level.
This is a fan base so tormented that people
have had to hold rallies for Steve Bartman (the
fan who interfered with a
catchable ball, costing the
Cubs a key out in their epic
Game 6 collapse). Bartman
himself is so distraught that
his friends held a rally for him
and he talks about trying to
"get his life back together."
I can't deny that things are
pretty intense in Wrigleyville.
And I can't deny that Red Sox
fans are quite capable of actively out-suffering
any challenger. But let's have some perspective
here. Both teams got to their respective league
championship series; the Tigers almost got to
the most embarrassing record in major-league
history.
Now, I was admittedly geeked when the
Tigers finished 2003 by playing their winningest
. stretch of ball all season, winning five of their
last six to narrowly avoid tying the 1962 New
York Mets' 20th century loss record (120).
But then I reflected on it, and I realized how
absurd it was that a major-league team in this
era in the seventh-largest market in America
should need two walk-off home runs in the
month of September alone by vainglorious util
ityman Shane Halter just to avoid being the
worst team ever.
I sat through three Tigers' games in Toronto
this September. In the first, Mike Maroth be
came the first pitcher in 23 years to lose 20 games.
In the second, the Tigers were no-hit until the
eighth inning as Roy Hallady became the first
pitcher in a decade to throw a 10-inning shutout.
In the third, they were simply run out of the park
on a rail, 8-0. It's pretty bad when you meet a Red
Sox fan at Skydome and he just shakes his head,
pats you on the back, and says, "God bless you."
It takes a whole lot to move a Sox fan to pity
someone else's plight more than his own.
Which begs the question: Why do good fans
stick with bad teams?
It's because they love their team uncondi
tionally and can't escape the relationship, no
matter how wretched it becomes, because they
still remember the beautiful day they first met
and how rosy things seemed then.
It's not healthy, but I think deep down every
hardcore Red Sox, Cubs, Expos or Tigers fan be
lieves their team owes them something. Like any
situation in life in which you get royally screwed,
when you sit through a series of unbelievable
playoff choke jobs or a 43-win season you
get pissed.
No one likes being had, and diehard sports
fans are all far too competitive to cut their losses
and go home. With each crushing season's end,
the fan becomes that much more resolved to
stick it out to the bitter end: "I'm going to see the
Red Sox win a World Series if it kills me."
In short, everyone's in it for the vindication. I
constantly have to remind myself just how good
it'll feel when the Tigers win the World Series
someday. It is the disillusioned, aged fan fervent
ly waiting for his team to reciprocate his affec
tion. In short, it's the crush from hell.
Sports fandom is in many ways like the
Odyssey. You choose your quest and you ride it
out, battling monsters (be they 119-loss seasons
or LCS choke-jobs) until finally you get home
(your team wins it all) and slay all the suitors
(that is, everyone who ever talked trash to you).
Sweet indeed is the fife of the fair-weather
fan. Hell knows no wrath like that of the long
sufferer for the bandwagon-jumper, the late
comer trying to cash in on all the pleasure with
out first suffering all the pain. Then there are
the fans of those few teams that just win, win
and win some more. These are even more de
. spised, because they just don't get it. They don't
play by the rules of the game.
In their heart, every long-suffering fan be
lieves, simply, that their struggle just means
more. It won't mean that much, even to a Yan
kees fan, when the Yankees win the World Se
ries for the 27th time. They've been there be
fore. Heck, they go there every few years. It's
like taking at trip to Disneyland. Nice, but noth
ing that unusual.
But it will mean everything, absolutely ev
erything, for the long-suffering fans when their
teams finally win the Series again. I mean, ev
eryone likes Disneyland, but a vacation 20,50 or
95 years in the making is bound to knock Mick
ey Mouse's socks off.

and how rosy things seemed then.
It's not healthy, but I think deep down every
hardcore Red Sox, Cubs, Expos or Tigers fan be
lieves their team owes them something. Like any
situation in life in which you get royally screwed,
when you sit through a series of unbelievable
playoff choke jobs or a 43-win season you
get pissed.
No one likes being had, and diehard sports
fans are all far too competitive to cut their losses
and go home. With each crushing season's end,
the fan becomes that much more resolved to
stick it out to the bitter end: "I'm going to see the
Red Sox win a World Series if it kills me."
In short, everyone's in it for the vindication. I
constantly have to remind myself just how good
it'll feel when the Tigers win the World Series
someday. It is the disillusioned, aged fan fervent
ly waiting for his team to reciprocate his affec
tion. In short, it's the crush from hell.
Sports fandom is in many ways like the
Odyssey. You choose your quest and you ride it
out, battling monsters (be they 119-loss seasons
or LCS choke-jobs) until finally you get home
(your team wins it all) and slay all the suitors
(that is, everyone who ever talked trash to you).
Sweet indeed is the fife of the fair-weather
fan. Hell knows no wrath like that of the long
sufferer for the bandwagon-jumper, the late

out first suffering all the pain. Then there are
the fans of those few teams that just win, win
and win some more. These are even more de

play by the rules of the game.
In their heart, every long-suffering fan be
lieves, simply, that their struggle just means
more. It won't mean that much, even to a Yan

like taking at trip to Disneyland. Nice, but noth

But it will mean everything, absolutely ev

In recent weeks, there has been a great deal
of self-indulgent bemoaning of the Boston
Red Sox's and Chicago Cubs' cursed
plights. And while I appreciate the pain a
monumental choke can produce, I still think
those fans need a little perspective.
I mean, the Sox won 95 games. That's well over
two times the amount of games my beloved De
troit Tigers won. They went to the seventh game of
the American League Championship Series. The
Tigers haven't made the playoffs since 1987, and
they just suffered their 10th straight losing season.
Now, I know a successful regular season
doesn't mean fans are going to go home happy in
October. I'm from Chicago, so I know the pain
that Cubs fans are experiencing right now as
their team accomplished the impossible by
somehow managing to take their long, incredi
ble history of playoff chokes to yet another level.
This is a fan base so tormented that people
have had to hold rallies for Steve Bartman (the
fan who interfered with a
catchable ball, costing the
Cubs a key out in their epic
Game 6 collapse). Bartman
himself is so distraught that
his friends held a rally for him
and he talks about trying to
"get his life back together."
I can't deny that things are
pretty intense in Wrigleyville.
And I can't deny that Red Sox
fans are quite capable of actively out-suffering
any challenger. But let's have some perspective
here. Both teams got to their respective league
championship series; the Tigers almost got to
the most embarrassing record in major-league
history.
Now, I was admittedly geeked when the
Tigers finished 2003 by playing their winningest
. stretch of ball all season, winning five of their
last six to narrowly avoid tying the 1962 New
York Mets' 20th century loss record (120).
But then I reflected on it, and I realized how
absurd it was that a major-league team in this
era in the seventh-largest market in America
should need two walk-off home runs in the
month of September alone by vainglorious util
ityman Shane Halter just to avoid being the
worst team ever.
I sat through three Tigers' games in Toronto
this September. In the first, Mike Maroth be
came the first pitcher in 23 years to lose 20 games.
In the second, the Tigers were no-hit until the
eighth inning as Roy Hallady became the first
pitcher in a decade to throw a 10-inning shutout.
In the third, they were simply run out of the park
on a rail, 8-0. It's pretty bad when you meet a Red
Sox fan at Skydome and he just shakes his head,
pats you on the back, and says, "God bless you."
It takes a whole lot to move a Sox fan to pity
someone else's plight more than his own.
Which begs the question: Why do good fans
stick with bad teams?
It's because they love their team uncondi
tionally and can't escape the relationship, no
matter how wretched it becomes, because they
still remember the beautiful day they first met
and how rosy things seemed then.
It's not healthy, but I think deep down every
hardcore Red Sox, Cubs, Expos or Tigers fan be
lieves their team owes them something. Like any
situation in life in which you get royally screwed,
when you sit through a series of unbelievable
playoff choke jobs or a 43-win season you
