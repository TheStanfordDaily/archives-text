# Defense not enough
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's dreams of upsetting No. 6 Washington
State vanished with just one small juke.
Senior wide receiver Sammy Moore outmaneu
vered junior cornerback Leigh Torrence after catch
ing a punt and turned a seemingly harmless play into
a 64-yard punt return and the impetus that propelled
the Cougars to a 24-14 victory over the Cardinal on
Saturday.
The return with under 10 minutes set up Matt
Kegel's third touchdown pass of the game on the next
play a three-yard toss to tight end Troy Bienemann
and completely deflated a Stanford team (2-3, 0-3
Pacific-10 Conference) that had been hanging around
at 13-7 for eons.
"He made a nice return at an opportune time," said
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens of Moore. "We
had a little momentum offensively and defensively
[and that play took it away.]"
The bigger news for Cardinal fans, however, may
have been the developments at quarterback.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Trent Edwards left
the game with 8:23 remaining in the third quarter after
spraining his right shoulder.
Further news on the injury will be delayed until
Tuesday, Teevens said. X-rays after the game came out
negative, showing no structural damage to Edwards's

throwing arm.
Fifth-year senior Chris Lewis played the rest of the
game but was unable to muster one of his come-off
the-bench-and-bring-his-team-from-behind-against-
a-really-good-team tricks.
Lewis, so renowned for engineering comebacks
against Oregon, USC and Texas in years past, finished
9-of-22 for 95 yards, a touchdown and an interception.
But the numbers don't completely tell the story,
since the Stanford offense scored both of its touch
downs with Lewis directing things.
A Lewis supporter and former teammate decided
to weigh in on the quarterback situation after the
game.
While Edwards was being interviewed outside the
Stanford locker room, ex-Cardinal wide receiver Teyo
Johnson put his arm around Lewis and made some
bold statements.
"Chris Lewis should be starting the rest of the sea
son," said Johnson with a smile. "That's all I have to
say about that.
"Things should never have changed. You guys saw
what happened in the second half. Imagine if it was like
that the whole game. If Chris doesn't start, it's politics
plain and simple."
While Edwards failed to get the Cardinal into the
endzone, he completed 11-of-28 passes for 122 yards

and an interception before exiting.
"Being the competitor I am, I
would have loved to get back in
there," he said. "But I didn't want to
push it."
The struggles of the offensive
line, though, made the question of
who was playing qtiarterback a
moot point of sorts.
The young quintet had to break
in fifth-year senior Drew Caylor at
the center spot after losing Brian
Head to a season-ending knee in
jury and it showed.
Give Washington State some
credit, too. The Cougars had four
sacks the 23rd time in the last 24
outings that the defense has record
ed a sack and blitzed, bruised and
battered both Stanford quarter
backs all afternoon.
"Every time we came out to the
sideline it was always something
new," Lewis said "They were bring
ing a lot of heat and different
blitzes."
As it talked about in the off
week, Stanford tried hard to get
Luke Powell involved in the offense,
but was successful to only a slight
degree.
The Cardinal's best offensive se
ries of the second quarter came
when it threw to the diminutive
wide receiver. Stanford gained 37
yards in the four plays that involved
Powell and only 16 in the other
five plays combined. (That drive
culminated in a missed 33-yard
Michael Sgroi field goal.)
Powell finished with five catches
for 47 yards but was unable to pro
vide a big play for the offense.
Meanwhile, Greg Camarillo had
a career-high six catches for 64
yards, and Gerren Crochet's 36-
yard reception in the third quarter
was Stanford's longest play from

scrimmage this year.
Arguably the most important
sign for the future was more fresh
men development. Wide receiver
Mark Bradford finished with a ca
reer-high four catches for 50 yards
and recorded his first career touch
down late in the fourth quarter. He
snuck by Cougar corner Jason
David and, with one hand, reeled in
an eight-yard laser beam from
Lewis.
"I was looking into the sun and
stuck my arm out there," Bradford
said. "I saw it at the last minute and
tried to grab onto it."
But for all the problems offen
sively, Stanford had to be proud of
its defensive effort especially
against the run.
The Cardinal run defense so
beleaguered in the last two contests,
giving up a whopping total of 385
yards came out with a renewed
intensity that mattered.
Stanford held Washington
State, the second-leading rushing
team in the conference, to 74 yards
on the ground. The Cougars had
amassed only 37 yards through
three quarters but racked up some
more in milking the clock during
the final period.
And the defense also knocked out
Kegel momentarily when Jared New
berry leveled the quarterback on the
Cougars' first series of the third quar
ter. (Kegel had his shoulder popped
back into place on the sideline and re
turned after two series.)
The Cardinal's seventh straight
defeat at the hands of a top-25 op
ponent was hard to swallow, but the
bottom-line lesson from this latest
loss was the importance of closing
out an opponent.
"We put ourselves in a situation
to beat the No. 6 team in the coun
try, but now we just have to learn
how to finish," said linebacker
David Bergeron. "We have to learn
how to close the deal, get the ball
back for our offense and give them a
chance to win."

bottom-line lesson from this latest
loss was the importance of closing
out an opponent.
"We put ourselves in a situation
to beat the No. 6 team in the coun
try, but now we just have to learn
how to finish," said linebacker
David Bergeron. "We have to learn
how to close the deal, get the ball
back for our offense and give them a
chance to win."

Redshirt freshman quarterback Trent Edwards hits the around on a carry during
the Cardinal's offensive struggle Saturday against the Cougars. Edwards
was injured on the play and replaced by senior Chris Lewis.
Stanford's dreams of upsetting No. 6 Washington
State vanished with just one small juke.
Senior wide receiver Sammy Moore outmaneu
vered junior cornerback Leigh Torrence after catch
ing a punt and turned a seemingly harmless play into
a 64-yard punt return and the impetus that propelled
the Cougars to a 24-14 victory over the Cardinal on
Saturday.
The return with under 10 minutes set up Matt
Kegel's third touchdown pass of the game on the next
play a three-yard toss to tight end Troy Bienemann
and completely deflated a Stanford team (2-3, 0-3
Pacific-10 Conference) that had been hanging around
at 13-7 for eons.
"He made a nice return at an opportune time," said
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens of Moore. "We
had a little momentum offensively and defensively
[and that play took it away.]"
The bigger news for Cardinal fans, however, may
have been the developments at quarterback.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Trent Edwards left
the game with 8:23 remaining in the third quarter after
spraining his right shoulder.
Further news on the injury will be delayed until
Tuesday, Teevens said. X-rays after the game came out
negative, showing no structural damage to Edwards's

throwing arm.
Fifth-year senior Chris Lewis played the rest of the
game but was unable to muster one of his come-off
the-bench-and-bring-his-team-from-behind-against-
a-really-good-team tricks.
Lewis, so renowned for engineering comebacks
against Oregon, USC and Texas in years past, finished
9-of-22 for 95 yards, a touchdown and an interception.
But the numbers don't completely tell the story,
since the Stanford offense scored both of its touch
downs with Lewis directing things.
A Lewis supporter and former teammate decided
to weigh in on the quarterback situation after the
game.
While Edwards was being interviewed outside the
Stanford locker room, ex-Cardinal wide receiver Teyo
Johnson put his arm around Lewis and made some
bold statements.
"Chris Lewis should be starting the rest of the sea
son," said Johnson with a smile. "That's all I have to
say about that.
"Things should never have changed. You guys saw
what happened in the second half. Imagine if it was like
that the whole game. If Chris doesn't start, it's politics
plain and simple."
While Edwards failed to get the Cardinal into the
endzone, he completed 11-of-28 passes for 122 yards

and an interception before exiting.
"Being the competitor I am, I
would have loved to get back in
there," he said. "But I didn't want to
push it."
The struggles of the offensive
line, though, made the question of
who was playing qtiarterback a
moot point of sorts.
The young quintet had to break
in fifth-year senior Drew Caylor at
the center spot after losing Brian
Head to a season-ending knee in
jury and it showed.
Give Washington State some
credit, too. The Cougars had four
sacks the 23rd time in the last 24
outings that the defense has record
ed a sack and blitzed, bruised and
battered both Stanford quarter
backs all afternoon.
"Every time we came out to the
sideline it was always something
new," Lewis said "They were bring
ing a lot of heat and different
blitzes."
As it talked about in the off
week, Stanford tried hard to get
Luke Powell involved in the offense,
but was successful to only a slight
degree.
The Cardinal's best offensive se
ries of the second quarter came
when it threw to the diminutive
wide receiver. Stanford gained 37
yards in the four plays that involved
Powell and only 16 in the other
five plays combined. (That drive
culminated in a missed 33-yard
Michael Sgroi field goal.)
Powell finished with five catches
for 47 yards but was unable to pro
vide a big play for the offense.
Meanwhile, Greg Camarillo had
a career-high six catches for 64
yards, and Gerren Crochet's 36-
yard reception in the third quarter
was Stanford's longest play from

scrimmage this year.
Arguably the most important
sign for the future was more fresh
men development. Wide receiver
Mark Bradford finished with a ca
reer-high four catches for 50 yards
and recorded his first career touch
down late in the fourth quarter. He
snuck by Cougar corner Jason
David and, with one hand, reeled in
an eight-yard laser beam from
Lewis.
"I was looking into the sun and
stuck my arm out there," Bradford
said. "I saw it at the last minute and
tried to grab onto it."
But for all the problems offen
sively, Stanford had to be proud of
its defensive effort especially
against the run.
The Cardinal run defense so
beleaguered in the last two contests,
giving up a whopping total of 385
yards came out with a renewed
intensity that mattered.
Stanford held Washington
State, the second-leading rushing
team in the conference, to 74 yards
on the ground. The Cougars had
amassed only 37 yards through
three quarters but racked up some
more in milking the clock during
the final period.
And the defense also knocked out
Kegel momentarily when Jared New
berry leveled the quarterback on the
Cougars' first series of the third quar
ter. (Kegel had his shoulder popped
back into place on the sideline and re
turned after two series.)
The Cardinal's seventh straight
defeat at the hands of a top-25 op
ponent was hard to swallow, but the
bottom-line lesson from this latest
loss was the importance of closing
out an opponent.
