# Defense not enough
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's dreams of upsetting No. 6 Washington
State vanished with just one small juke.
Senior wide receiver Sammy Moore outmaneu
vered junior cornerback Leigh Torrence after catch
ing a punt and turned a seemingly harmless play into
a 64-yard punt return and the impetus that propelled
the Cougars to a 24-14 victory over the Cardinal on
Saturday.
The return with under 10 minutes set up Matt
Kegel's third touchdown pass of the game on the next
play a three-yard toss to tight end Troy Bienemann
and completely deflated a Stanford team (2-3, 0-3
Pacific-10 Conference) that had been hanging around
at 13-7 for eons.
"He made a nice return at an opportune time," said
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens of Moore. "We
had a little momentum offensively and defensively
[and that play took it away.]"
The bigger news for Cardinal fans, however, may
have been the developments at quarterback.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Trent Edwards left
the game with 8:23 remaining in the third quarter after
spraining his right shoulder.
Further news on the injury will be delayed until
Tuesday, Teevens said. X-rays after the game came out
negative, showing no structural damage to Edwards's

throwing arm.
Fifth-year senior Chris Lewis played the rest of the
game but was unable to muster one of his come-off
the-bench-and-bring-his-team-from-behind-against-
a-really-good-team tricks.
Lewis, so renowned for engineering comebacks
against Oregon, USC and Texas in years past, finished
9-of-22 for 95 yards, a touchdown and an interception.
But the numbers don't completely tell the story,
since the Stanford offense scored both of its touch
downs with Lewis directing things.
A Lewis supporter and former teammate decided
to weigh in on the quarterback situation after the
game.
While Edwards was being interviewed outside the
Stanford locker room, ex-Cardinal wide receiver Teyo
Johnson put his arm around Lewis and made some
bold statements.
"Chris Lewis should be starting the rest of the sea
son," said Johnson with a smile. "That's all I have to
say about that.
"Things should never have changed. You guys saw
what happened in the second half. Imagine if it was like
that the whole game. If Chris doesn't start, it's politics
plain and simple."
While Edwards failed to get the Cardinal into the
endzone, he completed 11-of-28 passes for 122 yards

The Cardinal defense works together to halt a run by No. 6 Washington State junior Chris Bruhn. Stanford's defense held the Cougar's explosive offense to 24 points
in the Cardinal loss, its third straight this season.
