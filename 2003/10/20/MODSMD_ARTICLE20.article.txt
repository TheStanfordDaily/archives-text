# Card's offensive woes continue

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Against a team like No. 6 Washington State, you can only
stay in the game with blocked kicks, deflected passes and third
down stops for so long before you need to score some points.
And for Stanford, the points just came too slowly on Saturday.
Quarterbacks Trent Edwards and Chris Lewis found little
time and few seams in the Cougars' stiff defense, and running
backs Kenneth Tolon and J.R. Lemon fared even worse as the
Cardinal netted just 42 yards on the ground.
After the game, the offense all but admitted that it had been
outmaneuvered.
"They put an extra [defender] in the box, and that was their
approach: 'Let's make them throw the ball at us,' " said Stanford
head coach Buddy Teevens.
When the running game stalled, Stanford tried to do just that,
but couldn't find the time to look downfield due to Washington
State's pressure.
