# Card's offensive woes continue
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Against a team like No. 6 Washington State, you can only
stay in the game with blocked kicks, deflected passes and third
down stops for so long before you need to score some points.
And for Stanford, the points just came too slowly on Saturday.
Quarterbacks Trent Edwards and Chris Lewis found little
time and few seams in the Cougars' stiff defense, and running
backs Kenneth Tolon and J.R. Lemon fared even worse as the
Cardinal netted just 42 yards on the ground.
After the game, the offense all but admitted that it had been
outmaneuvered.
"They put an extra [defender] in the box, and that was their
approach: 'Let's make them throw the ball at us,' " said Stanford
head coach Buddy Teevens.
When the running game stalled, Stanford tried to do just that,
but couldn't find the time to look downfield due to Washington
State's pressure.
"They were bringing a lot of heat, a
lot of different blitzes and stuff," said
Lewis, a fifth-year senior, who entered
the game in the third quarter when
freshman starter Edwards went down
with a shoulder injury.
"We were having a tough time
picking them up," Edwards echoed.
Stanford looked for shorter passes
to take advantage of the holes left by
blitzing defenders.
"The timing of our routes, the
depth of our routes, we had to cut
down a little bit," Edwards said.
But Washington State quickly ad
justed.
"We were running the same routes
at them, and they were starting to catch
on to that," Edwards said.
"A lot of times they were sitting 10
to 12 yards [deep], right where we're
making our breaks," explained senior
wide receiver Luke Powell.
The Cardinal, shut out completely
in the first half, finally found some suc
cess by throwing the ball deep in the
second half. A 36-yard heave from Ed
wards to Gerren Crochet in the third
quarter gave Stanford a first down on
Washington State's three-yard line,
and Tolon punched it into the endzone
five plays later.
When Lewis replaced Edwards,
who has struggled to produce since
taking over as the team's starter
against Brigham Young, it looked as if
the fifth-year senior might have a
chance to lead a comeback of the sort

he became known for as Randy
Fasani's backup two years ago.
But to Washington State's defend
ers, Lewis was just another white shirt
with a red bull's eye on his chest. The
Cougars knocked him down repeated
ly and sacked him twice in a quarter
and a half of play.
The Cardinal did put together a
successful drive in the fourth quarter
with Lewis under center, but his touch
down toss to freshman Mark Bradford
with 7:17 left in the game served only to
make the final score look more re
spectable.
It was, in Teevens's words, "too lit
tle, too late."
Stanford's defense continued to
perform admirably throughout, but it
was fighting a losing field-position bat
tle due to the Cardinal's inability to
move the ball.
Bottled up for much of the day, the
Cougars' offense got a boost in the
third quarter from Sammy Moore's
64-yard punt return, which set up the
touchdown that extended the lead to
21-7. And in the fourth quarter, with
the Cougars ahead 21-14, Davard Dar
ling reached over the head of Stanford
comerback Stanley Wilson for a 31-
yard gain that led to a game-sealing
field goal.
"We stopped them so many times,"
Lewis said. "We just didn't put points
on the board."
Powell said the team isn't prepared
to accept more 14-point efforts in the
future.
"We're going to come in here [Sun
day] and watch the film, and Tuesday
we're going to go back to work and see
if we can do something better next
time," he said.
