# Card swept by No. 1 USC at Maples
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Less than one year prior to Friday night's
match against No. 1 USC, the Trojan women's
volleyball team defeated Stanford 3-1 to claim
the 2002 NCAA title and deny the Cardinal of
back-to-back championships.
Less than 24 hours prior to the match
against USC, the Cardinal had come from two
games down and only three points away from
losing to No. 11 UCLA in Game 3, to mount
an amazing come from behind victory over
the Bruins.
But the memory of the NCAA title match
in New Orleans and the momentum of the win
over UCLA were not enough to propel the
No. 7 Cardinal (14-4, 7-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) over the top-ranked Trojans (18-0, 9-0
Pac-10), as USC defeated Stanford 3-0 in
front of large homecoming weekend crowd of
3,549.
Coming into the match against the Cardi
nal, USC had only dropped one game on the
season in 16 matches and while this was
the first time the Cardinal has been swept by a
Pac-10 team since September 2000, it was also
the seventh consecutive 3-0 win for the Tro
jans and their seventh sweep of a ranked team
this year.
"I give a lot of credit to USC. They've been
working hard and playing well and they de
serve to be No. 1 in the country," said senior
Sara Dukes, who was filling in at middle
blocker.
"Right now I think they have an intimida
tion factor, especially because they have lost
so few games, but every team has some weak
nesses and we did what we could to carry out
our game plan against them, but they are great
players with a great coaching staff," she said.
In addition to facing a very strong USC
team, Stanford had to play with a depleted
lineup.

Last year, Stanford lost three of its key
players in the AVCA Player of the Year:
Logan Tom, Ashley Ivy and Lindsey Yamasa
ki.
USC, on the other hand, has 10 returners
from last year's team, including all six
starters.
Furthermore, Stanford had to play the
match against the Trojans without senior mid
dle blocker Sara McGee who was out with a
foot injury. McGee's absence forced the Car
dinal to shuffle its starting lineup to fill the
void in the middle where the 6-foot-3 middle
blocker normally played. Dukes filled in for
McGee, while junior Jennifer Hucke and
sophomore Courtney Schultz got playing time
on the right side.
"Sara Dukes did a great job filling in for
McGee in the middle," Schultz said. "She
put up a great block and we were able to
adapt to the changes, but USC is just strong
at every position. It was impossible for us to
ever predict a set or play to block their No.
1 hitter because they play with a back row
setter and at any given time they have three
great hitters at the net."
In the game, the Trojans outhit the Cardi
nal 69-48 and had seven fewer errors than
Stanford. Overall, USC's hitting percentage
was .545 the third highest hitting percent
age in USC history while Stanford ended
the match with a .286 hitting percentage.
Furthermore, USC had five players hit
double digits in kills and while Stanford junior
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani led the match
with 22 kills, she was the only Cardinal to
record more than six in the match.
Leading the attack for the Trojans was se
nior outside hitter April Ross, who had 18
kills and hit an impressive .607 in the match.
The Trojans were also strong defensively
outdigging the Cardinal 41-28 and out

blocking it 9-4, well below Stan
ford's average 3.2 blocks per game.
USC libero, senior Nicole
Davis, led the match with 15 digs,
followed by Ross with nine and
Stanford outside hitter Kristin
Richards with eight.
The Trojans' power began to
show in the first game and did not
let up as the final game scores were
30-17,30-21 and 30-23.
In the first game alone, USC
jumped out to an early five-point
lead, which doubled to 10 at 25-
15 and before Stanford could
score three more points, USC
had taken Game 1.
In Game 1 alone, USC hit .750
to Stanford's .226 and had only
one error to Stanford's seven.
USC carried this momentum
through Game 2, as it held the lead
throughout the game with another
23 kills and only two errors.
Stanford, however, came out
strong after the break in Game 3
and took its largest lead of the
match at 12-7.
That's as close as Stanford
would get to winning a game, as
USC went on a 5-1 run to bring the
game within one and then tied the
game at 14-14.
Stanford hung close for the rest
of Game 3, but USC proved too ef
fective, taking a two-point lead at
19-21 and expanding it to eight at
21-29.
The match against the Trojans is
only Stanford's second loss in the
Pac-10 and the team will be back in
conference action this Thursday
and Friday against Washington and

ford's average 3.2 blocks per game.
USC libero, senior Nicole
Davis, led the match with 15 digs,
followed by Ross with nine and
Stanford outside hitter Kristin
Richards with eight.
The Trojans' power began to
show in the first game and did not
let up as the final game scores were
30-17,30-21 and 30-23.
In the first game alone, USC
jumped out to an early five-point
lead, which doubled to 10 at 25-
15 and before Stanford could
score three more points, USC
had taken Game 1.
In Game 1 alone, USC hit .750
to Stanford's .226 and had only
one error to Stanford's seven.
USC carried this momentum
through Game 2, as it held the lead
throughout the game with another
23 kills and only two errors.
Stanford, however, came out
strong after the break in Game 3
and took its largest lead of the
match at 12-7.
That's as close as Stanford
would get to winning a game, as
USC went on a 5-1 run to bring the
game within one and then tied the
game at 14-14.
Stanford hung close for the rest
of Game 3, but USC proved too ef
fective, taking a two-point lead at
19-21 and expanding it to eight at
21-29.
The match against the Trojans is
only Stanford's second loss in the
Pac-10 and the team will be back in
conference action this Thursday
and Friday against Washington and
Washington State.
Less than one year prior to Friday night's
match against No. 1 USC, the Trojan women's
volleyball team defeated Stanford 3-1 to claim
the 2002 NCAA title and deny the Cardinal of
back-to-back championships.
Less than 24 hours prior to the match
against USC, the Cardinal had come from two
games down and only three points away from
losing to No. 11 UCLA in Game 3, to mount
an amazing come from behind victory over
the Bruins.
But the memory of the NCAA title match
in New Orleans and the momentum of the win
over UCLA were not enough to propel the
No. 7 Cardinal (14-4, 7-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) over the top-ranked Trojans (18-0, 9-0
Pac-10), as USC defeated Stanford 3-0 in
front of large homecoming weekend crowd of
3,549.
Coming into the match against the Cardi
nal, USC had only dropped one game on the
season in 16 matches and while this was
the first time the Cardinal has been swept by a
Pac-10 team since September 2000, it was also
the seventh consecutive 3-0 win for the Tro
jans and their seventh sweep of a ranked team
this year.
"I give a lot of credit to USC. They've been
working hard and playing well and they de
serve to be No. 1 in the country," said senior
Sara Dukes, who was filling in at middle
blocker.
"Right now I think they have an intimida
tion factor, especially because they have lost
so few games, but every team has some weak
nesses and we did what we could to carry out
our game plan against them, but they are great
players with a great coaching staff," she said.
In addition to facing a very strong USC
team, Stanford had to play with a depleted
lineup.

Last year, Stanford lost three of its key
players in the AVCA Player of the Year:
Logan Tom, Ashley Ivy and Lindsey Yamasa
ki.
USC, on the other hand, has 10 returners
from last year's team, including all six
starters.
Furthermore, Stanford had to play the
match against the Trojans without senior mid
dle blocker Sara McGee who was out with a
foot injury. McGee's absence forced the Car
dinal to shuffle its starting lineup to fill the
void in the middle where the 6-foot-3 middle
blocker normally played. Dukes filled in for
McGee, while junior Jennifer Hucke and
sophomore Courtney Schultz got playing time
on the right side.
"Sara Dukes did a great job filling in for
McGee in the middle," Schultz said. "She
put up a great block and we were able to
adapt to the changes, but USC is just strong
at every position. It was impossible for us to
ever predict a set or play to block their No.
1 hitter because they play with a back row
setter and at any given time they have three
great hitters at the net."
In the game, the Trojans outhit the Cardi
nal 69-48 and had seven fewer errors than
Stanford. Overall, USC's hitting percentage
was .545 the third highest hitting percent
age in USC history while Stanford ended
the match with a .286 hitting percentage.
Furthermore, USC had five players hit
double digits in kills and while Stanford junior
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani led the match
with 22 kills, she was the only Cardinal to
record more than six in the match.
Leading the attack for the Trojans was se
nior outside hitter April Ross, who had 18
kills and hit an impressive .607 in the match.
