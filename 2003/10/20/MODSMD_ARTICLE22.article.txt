# Women shutout L.A. schools
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
On Friday night, the defense of the Stanford
women's soccer team bent and just when you thought
it couldn't bend anymore, it did.
But it never broke and the Cardinal (7-6-2, 2-1-1
Pacific 10 Conference) recorded two shutouts this
weekend: a tie against No. 3 UCLA (10-1-3, 3-0-1) on
Friday and a 2-0 victory over Southern California (6-
5-4, 2-1-1) yesterday.
Stanford battled through two overtime periods
against an infinitely deeper Bruin squad. In fact, the
Bruins made twice as many substitutions in just the
first period than the Cardinal throughout the entire
110 minutes of play.
Fatigue clearly set in for Stanford. After posting a
6-4 shot lead in the first period, the Cardinal was out
shot by the Bruins 8-20 throughout the remainder of
the match.
"We got tired and dropped off a little bit," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "But I think in the
first half we were definitely the better team."
Essentially, it was several outstanding plays from
First-Team All-American UCLA defender Nandi
Pryce that stood between the Cardinal and an upset
win.
On more than one occasion, Stanford forced junior
goalkeeper Sarah Lombardo to come off her line, but
Pryce squashed each Cardinal opportunity, always
ending up in the right place at the right time.
However, the Bruins probably felt the same way
about the play of Stanford junior goalkeeper Nicole
Barnhart. The First-Team All-American tallied
seven saves, all seven of them coming after the first
period.
"Obviously, [Barnhart] was standout for us in
goal," Ratcliffe said. "But it's not just a couple indi
viduals that are going to help you tie the third ranked
team in the nation."
Barnhart's most spectacular save came at the 62-
minute mark on midfielder Jill Oakes's shot.
Oakes fired a bullet toward the top left corner of
the net, but Barnhart made a diving save, tipping the
ball over the top of the crossbar.
While Barnhart would pick up only one save in the
first overtime period, it was the busiest time of the

match for the junior.
UCLA applied pressure to the Stanford defense
for the duration of the period. The Cardinal could not
get even one shot off as the ball remained in front of
its own goal throughout the period.
The Bruins, however, recorded three shots and had
five corner kicks during those 10 minutes.
The second overtime period saw much of the same
aggressive play from UCLA.
The Bruins had an excellent scoring opportunity
when sophomore forward Iris Mora headed a lose ball
away from Barnhart. With Barnhart out of position,
senior forward Sarah-Gayle Swanson had an open
net, but missed wide left.
The Cardinal got back into the action offensively
in the second overtime, tallying two shots, one of
them on goal, but Lombardo was there to make the
stop.
Junior forward Natalie Sanderson had a chance to
end the match with an opportunity from five yards
out, but her shot sailed high over the crossbar.
"Our forwards got into the action a little bit more,"
Ratcliffe said. "They're possessing the ball better.
They're improving; there's no doubt about it."
For the struggling Stanford offense, Sunday was a
breakthrough day.
The Cardinal found the back of the net twice all the
while playing its usual stellar defense.
Redshirt freshman forward Heidi Herrick broke
the scoreless tie by driving a cross from sophomore
midfielder Leah Tapscott into the left side of the goal.
The goal was the first of Herrick's Stanford career.
Thd' Cardinal added to its lead on a penalty kick in
the 58th minute that junior forward Natalie Sander
son converted.
"We're creating chances and we're more orga
nized," Ratcliffe said. "That can only lead to good
things."
Barnhart had yet another standout day for the Car
dinal. She tallied four saves in the shutout and
brought her career shutout total to 28.
"We're definitely playing better," Ratcliffe said. "I
still think it's going to be tough to score goals on a reg
ular basis just because we don't have any natural goal
scorers."
Stanford will travel north this week to face Oregon
and Oregon State.
