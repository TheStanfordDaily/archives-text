Excellence in Teaching. He serves
as the Freeman-Thornton Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion but he still finds time to be
dean of the residential Freshman /
Sophomore Col
lege.
With so much
on his plate, we
thought we'd hit
Bravman with
our 10 random
questions.
IYou wake up
at 4:30 a.m. to
check e-mails and don't go back to
sleep. Explain.
John Bravman: I don't sleep that
much. Maybe 30 hours a week.
2 What's the most boring part of
your day?
I think I'd be making something up.
I rarely find myself bored, although
occasionally I could use a little
boredom, it feels like. But frankly
I'd be making something up.
3 You have the world's largest
collection of DVDs, and you
lend them out to students. Doesn't
that technically make you respon
sible for the demise of FLiCKS-to
go?
Free market for video.
4 If you could change one thing
about The Daily, what would
it be?
The Daily needs to employ fact
checkers the way all responsible
journalists or papers do.
5 You've been at Stanford al
most as long as dinosaurs
roamed the Earth. Why?
I've been at Stanford since 1975.
Came as a student, stayed for my
PhD, and then joined the faculty.
The real answer is, given the op
portunities, why leave?
6 People call you a bad-ass dean.
Is that because you're bad
or, something else?
This was a nickname invented by a
student during the first year of
FroSoCo which has stuck.
7 Sources say you were on Full
Moon on the Quad, snapping
photos of the streakers. Was that...
err... for faculty purposes?
I was at Full Moon on the Quad
shooting pictures of everything. I
haven't been in about 10 years and
so, I just wanted to check it out. It
was a great time. A great tradition.
8 Hypothetical situation: You're
on Stanford Administrators'
Survivor and you have to vote off
Assistant Dean of Students and Di
rector of the Office of Student Ac
tivities Nanci Howe or Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves.
Who'd get the boot and why?
I'm not going to answer that.
9 You host extravagant late
night study breaks with Pizza
Chicago. Aren't those toppings
damn weird?
They sure are.
~f A Stanford kids say that you
A guys in FroSoCo are cut off
from the rest of society. So tell
us the truth. How do you guys real
ly party down?

You'll have to ask the students
how they party. Rumor has it that
it's uphill both ways to FroSoCo
and it always snows there. But
come visit the sunny warm west
side of campus and you'll find
out.
