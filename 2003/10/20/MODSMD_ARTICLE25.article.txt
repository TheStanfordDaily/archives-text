# Sizzling Undergrad Rockin' Projects
## 
### ARAM HUR 
All the woman could manage was an awestruck sigh. No, Susie Brubaker-Cole
wasn't watching a steamy movie. She just couldn't put her feelings for this year's
second annual Symposium for Undergraduate Research in Progress into words.
The director of Undergraduate Research Programs was exulting over the turnout
at SURP. Judging by the bustling masses of students at the Arrillaga Alumni Center on Oct.
16, students share Brubaker-Cole's academic ardor.
Students with enough scholarly fervor to chat up all 74 presenters would have walked out
having learned a few facts: pricey anti-age creams are a waste of money, glancing at newspa
per headlines can up your stock-picking expertise, neuropathy diagnosis can be sped up and
first-borns have higher self-confidence. Here are some snapshots from the symposium:
Lotion Notion
If you're a fan of expensive cosmetic creams, bad news for you. Mimi Choi's research on
anti-aging creams identifies dimethicone as a key ingredient for fighting skin aging. Turns out
that store brand lotions contain the same concentration of dimethicone as expensive cosmet
ic creams. Choi, a Human Biology major and a recipient of a faculty grant funded by the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education's office, participated in a dermatology project that en
gaged her sophomore year. She warns women, "There's no need to waste your money on cos
metics!"
Students, Take Stock
Dan Siroker, a junior majoring in Computer Science, may be your next best friend if you're
in the stock market. Using sentiment classification, which sorts documents not by topic but by
the overall sentiment, Siroker developed software that quantifies the negative or positive ef
fect of a news article on a company's stock prospects.
"You train the program to recognize words like 'fired' or 'bankruptcy' as negative," Siroker ex
plains. Stock shoppers can then opt to purchase or pass on stock that day based on the number.
Siroker says he was interested in stock since high school; his idea was sparked when he met Prof.
Christopher Manning through Computer-Science Undergraduate Research Internship.
Diagnosis made easy
True Nguyen explored the diagnosis of neuropathies through Belief Network, a program
that utilizes condition dependencies between factors to quantify uncertainty. A Management
Science and Engineering major, the senior met Prof. Shachter during Summer Research Col
lege 2002. Wishing to combine medicine and biotechnology, Nguyen decided to examine how
diagnosis of neuropathies could be made more accurately and efficiently. Funded by a Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education department grant, Nguyen says that in using the pro
gram, "doctors will be able to determine the patient's situation by entering factors like gen
der, heredity, age and pain into the program."
First birth order
First-borns: Work that confidence, because you're born with it! Bethany Michel, a senior ma
joring in Social Science, decided to compare self-esteem levels of first-borns and siblings when she
noticed a peculiar response pattern from first-borns in another project. In that study, first-born
children consistently responded the same way, while students born subsequently answered dif
ferently. In Michel's current project, tests on 50 male children showed that first-borns displayed
higher levels of self-esteem. "The results are still tentative, though," says Michel.
Warm Tech Fuzzies
This is just a glimpse at the sheer variety of project topics, ranging from Incan pottery to
CD3O-CD3O lig and interaction. The significance of the Symposium on Undergraduate Re
search in Progress lies not merely in project presentations. Its true value lies in the fostering
of an interactive learning experience between Stanford peers.
"You learn a lot by having conversations with friends, and it's really motivating," said
freshman Julie Veroff.
On the same note, Brubaker-Cole said, "I'm thrilled to see so many freshmen and sopho
mores here, questioning the upperclassmen."
Timing is everything
For students raring to go with research projects next year, a few tips from research maven
Brubaker-Cole:
"Start early preferably in the winter or spring quarter of sophomore year," she says.
The greatest impediment for completing a quality project is time constraints. Starting junior
year is possible, but not recommended.
"Get actively involved," Brubaker-Cole advises. "The majority of students find their top
ics while they're at Summer Research College or through close professors."
Show me the money
If financing a research project presents a dilemma, worry not. Stanford's research pro
grams are well-funded. The Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education departmental grant
and faculty grant are available to student applicants from all disciplines. Moreover, Under
graduate Research Opportunities major grants offer up to $3,000 a year for qualified students.
But funding is not limited to Stanford resources; national fellowship and scholarship grants
are also available. (For more information on specific deadlines, go to

Full house
Compared to last year, the symposium drew a bigger crowd, says Marcia Keating, assistant di
rector for program management for the Undergraduate Research Program. "[The symposium]
was better-promoted this year," says Keating. "We used dorms, e-mails, The Daily we're going
to continue building awareness. It's great to see more alumni and faculty here, too."
