# Theta Breakers run to benefit children
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN 
While most of the student body
slept Sunday morning, throngs of men
and women dashed across the Stan
ford campus to raise money for
abused children.
The Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
sponsored the 18th Theta Breakers
Run for the Children 5K / 10K Walk /
Run, which benefited the Child Ad
vocates of Santa Clara and San Mateo
Counties, a branch of the national or
ganization Court Appointed Special
Advocates.
"We are all proud to know that our
most significant annual contribution
to the community enjoyed another
successful year," said Theta President
Cathie Simonsen, a senior. "We were
also thrilled to see so many fellow
Greeks out participating. It's really
important to us that the student body
and administration know how com
mitted Theta and other campus
Greek chapters are to service."
Child Advocates sends volunteers
to work on a personal basis with vic
tims of child abuse and neglect. The

advocates serve as mentors to these
children and are responsible for sub
mitting information to courts regard
ing the best interests of these children.
Simonsen credited junior Amy
Pentz and senior Karen Brand, the co
ordinators, for their work since last
spring in organizing the event, obtain
ing large donations from corporate
sponsors and securing a record atten
dance rate from Theta members.
Freshman Nikhil Sachdev, who
ran the men's 10K, agreed with Si
monsen in praising the event.
"Everyone was very enthusiastic,
the race was organized well, and it's
nice to know my contribution is help
ing someone out," he said.
Last year, the Thetas raised
$13,447 for Child Advocates. Early
estimates indicate that the Thetas will
approach, if not surpass, that number
this year. Philips Electronics, this
year's most generous corporate spon
sor, provided $lO,OOO for the event.
Other corporate sponsors donated a
combined $4,000. Registration fees

mates that it raised over $19,000.
"The atmosphere was no pressure:
Just run your best," said freshman
Carly York, who ran the 10K. "It's a
good community thing to do, plus it's
for a benefit to help children."
All registered participants re
ceived official race T-shirts and will
be sent their computer-calculated
times through the mail. About 200
people had pre-registered before Fri
day. An additional 200 people regis
tered on-site Sunday morning, begin
ning at 8 a.m. 'Warm-up exercises
started at 8:30, with the race lasting to
11 a.m.
The first-place finishers from each
gender in both the 5K and 10K were
all awarded prizes. Prizes were also
presented to the adult/child team
and the five-person team with the
lowest collective time.
The 5K run was held primarily on
the eastern campus, with partici
pants heading north from Stanford

Stadium, west from the Encina
Commons, past Green Library and
turning around near the western
edge of the Main Quad. The 10K cir
cled much of the main campus, with
entrants following the 5K route up
to the Main Quad, where they
turned south along Lomita Drive
before traveling west at Campus
Drive, east on Santa Teresa Street,
across White Plaza, back to Green
Library and following the 5K route
back to the stadium.
"It was just fun to run the cam
pus," York said. "There were girls all
around cheering for you."
Senior Christy Von der Ahe em
ceed the walk / run. The founder of
the Stanford chapter of Kappa Alpha
Theta, Lucinda Greene, Class of
1983, who had returned for her 20th
reunion, was present to witness the
charitable work now being conducted
by her sorority.
For much of its history, the race
had been organized primarily by
Child Advocates, but after the 1997
race, the Stanford Office of Student
Activities called on the Thetas to ex
ercise greater control over the event
to ensure that this was an activity truly
organized by a Stanford group.
