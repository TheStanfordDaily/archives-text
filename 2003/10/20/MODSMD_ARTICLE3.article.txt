# Theta Breakers run to benefit children
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN 
While most of the student body
slept Sunday morning, throngs of men
and women dashed across the Stan
ford campus to raise money for
abused children.
The Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
sponsored the 18th Theta Breakers
Run for the Children 5K / 10K Walk /
Run, which benefited the Child Ad
vocates of Santa Clara and San Mateo
Counties, a branch of the national or
ganization Court Appointed Special
Advocates.
"We are all proud to know that our
most significant annual contribution
to the community enjoyed another
successful year," said Theta President
Cathie Simonsen, a senior. "We were
also thrilled to see so many fellow
Greeks out participating. It's really
important to us that the student body
and administration know how com
mitted Theta and other campus
Greek chapters are to service."
Child Advocates sends volunteers
to work on a personal basis with vic
tims of child abuse and neglect. The

advocates serve as mentors to these
children and are responsible for sub
mitting information to courts regard
ing the best interests of these children.
Simonsen credited junior Amy
Pentz and senior Karen Brand, the co
ordinators, for their work since last
spring in organizing the event, obtain
ing large donations from corporate
sponsors and securing a record atten
dance rate from Theta members.
Freshman Nikhil Sachdev, who
ran the men's 10K, agreed with Si
monsen in praising the event.
"Everyone was very enthusiastic,
the race was organized well, and it's
nice to know my contribution is help
ing someone out," he said.
Last year, the Thetas raised
$13,447 for Child Advocates. Early
estimates indicate that the Thetas will
approach, if not surpass, that number
this year. Philips Electronics, this
year's most generous corporate spon
sor, provided $lO,OOO for the event.
Other corporate sponsors donated a
combined $4,000. Registration fees
