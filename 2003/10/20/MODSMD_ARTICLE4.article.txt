## 
### SHAHNAWAZ NAWABI 
Stanford Psychology Prof.
Phillip Zimbardo has won the
Nobel prize for "silly" research.
Or rather, Zimbardo was in fact
awarded the Ig Nobel prize in Psy
chology at a ceremony on Thurs
day, Oct. 2 at Harvard University's
Sanders Theatre.
A satirical off-shoot of the
Swiss Nobel Prize, the Ig Nobels
have been described by their
founder, Marc Abrahams, as
awards for people who "first make
you laugh, then make you think."
Zimbardo attended the cere
mony in Cambridge, Mass. and
said that he was honored for his
report, entitled "Politicians'
Uniquely Simple Personalities,"
which explored the limited and
stunted psychological develop

ment of politicians.
"Politicians like to think of
themselves as so complex, but the
electorate thinks of them as sim
ple," he said.
Sophomore Morgan Thrower,
who took Zimbardo's Psychology
1 course last spring, did not seem
surprised at hearing that Zimbar
do received such an award.
She said that his lectures were
"entertaining" and that Zimbar
do "always seemed to make
everybody laugh during his lec
tures, but still packed in a lot of
information."
The trophy, chattering teeth on
top of a metal stand, was handed
out to winners representing five
different countries. Zimbardo,
who shared the award with two
Italian scholars, is the first Stan
ford professor to receive the prize.
