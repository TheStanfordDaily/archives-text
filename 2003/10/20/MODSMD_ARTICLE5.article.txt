# Tresidder nearly done
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
With the first phase of Tresid
der Union's renovation scheduled
for completion Nov. 11, students
can expect sub sandwiches,
gourmet coffees, cozy study areas
and plasma televisions featuring
HBO programming.
Stanford Dining will own and
operate franchises of Subway and
Peet's Coffee within Tresidder,
expanding the on-campus dining
options available to students.
Construction crews have been
working on the project since the
beginning of the summer, when
Stanford Dining took over the
space previously managed by Bon
Appetit. Though the food vendors
were originally slated to open in
October, the dates were pushed
back when Dining learned that
construction would not be fin
ished and that the building per
mits would not be ready.
Employees of Stanford dining
will staff both Subway and Peet's
Coffee. The Subway will have two
counters, doubling the service
available at a single Subway store.
The Tresidder location will charge
the same prices as the Subway on
University Avenue, and it will be
only the second Subway in the
area to serve breakfast. The
Peet's Coffee kiosk will feature a
"drive-up" window, which will
allow customers to place and pick
up orders without having to enter
the building.
In addition to the expanded
food choices, Tresidder will offer
many new seating options, includ
ing a soft-seating area for studying
and taller bar-style tables.
"We are really trying to create
different opportunities for student
programming," said Amanda
Gotthold, the general manager of
retail for Tresidder. "Before this
was not an inviting space, but now
we are hoping that it will be a
place where students will want to
come and study, eat or meet with
friends."
According to Eric Montell, the
associate director of executive,

catering, concessions and retail
services, the pace of the project
has been very rapid, as plans were
not approved until late May and
an architect not selected until
early June. Montell met weekly
over the summer with Nadeem
Siddiqui, the executive director of
Stanford Dining and the Tresid
der Dining Advisory Group to
oversee the changes.
"We have a very large campus
and we want places for students to
go so that they do not get bored
with a regular routine," Siddiqui
said. "It's great for faculty, stu
dents and staff to have choices
and a variety of options."
In addition to the Subway and
Peet's Coffee, Dining plans to ex
pand the options further when it
opens a food court area in Janu
ary. However, the food court will
be blocked off when Tresidder re
opens in November, as the exten
sive renovations needed in the
kitchen area have not yet been
finished.
Dining has come up with sever
al new concepts for the food court,
Gotthold said. Though the ideas
have not yet been finalized, she ex
pects the food court to include a
grab-and-go area, a salad-by-de
sign station, a global grill featuring
a tandoor oven and a smoker, a
wrap and bowl station and a sushi
counter.
In addition, Dining is in the final
stages of negotiating a pizza pro
gram with a mainstream pizza ven
dor. Gotthold could not release the
name of the vendor since the con
tract is in procurement, but she did
say that the vendor would sell pizza
by the slice and offer late-night de
livery services to students on cam
pus.
Montell said he hoped to cre
ate a time capsule with student
memorabilia and he would also
like to have students paint a mural
on one of the walls in the dining
area. When the second phase of
construction is completed in Janu
ary, both Siddiqui and Montell
plan to have a campus-wide party
to celebrate the grand reopening
of Tresidder.
