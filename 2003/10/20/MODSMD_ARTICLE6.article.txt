## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Approximately 40 people attended the opening
night of the first Middle Eastern Film Festival last
night. Sponsored by the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network, the festival will show one movie
each week over the next month and a half, in cor
respondence with the month of Ramadan.
The festival, held every Sunday evening at
Bechtel International Center, kicked off with
"People of the Land," a documentary about the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict. Other movies to be
shown include "The Message," a dramatization of
the beginnings of the spread of Islam and the PBS
documentary "Muhammed."
"The film festival will use documentary materi
als to familiarize the audience with current affairs
affecting Muslims and will use dramatizations in
order to portray the narratives Muslims hold of
their shared history," said senior Ah Hassan, the
president of the Muslim Students Awareness Net

work.
Many of the stu
dents at last night's
screening were partic
ularly interested in
learning about the Is
raeli-Palestinian con
flict.
"It's something
that's been going on
for a long time, and I
don't know that
much about it, so I

just want to educate myself more," said freshman
Jonathan Liang.
According to Hassan, the festival is one of a
number of events the Muslim Students Awareness
Network is putting on to achieve the group's main
goals of fostering "campus awareness about issues
pertaining to Muslims and the Muslim world and
celebrating the cultures of the Muslim World."
With the holiday Ramadan starting next Sun

day, the festival and its goals of raising awareness of
Islam are well timed, according to organizers. Dur
ing Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset
for a month of reflection.
"It applies to self-restraint and character build
ing in general," Hassan said. "Treating your fellow
man with greater care, humility, being more con
scious of God, giving charity and so on."
"My warmest memories are from Ramadan be
cause it is when my extended family would get to
gether to break fast together, catch-up with one an
other and go on outings together," he continued.
"In a sense, it has all the elements of Thanksgiving.
Families gathered together being thankful for that
which they have, but stretched over a month."
The festival was scheduled for this month with
these sorts of associations with the holiday in mind.
"We thought that holding a film festival during
this month would not only bring the Stanford com
munity together in a spirit of brotherhood, but also

present a narrative of Islam and its
history through which the Stanford
community could better understand
Muslims," said Hassan.
"I thought that this was important

to go to see, a documentary film
showing one take on the whole
[Palestinian-Israeli conflict]," said se
nior Sheba Sheikh of last night's film.
Hassan added, "We hope that
Muslim students on campus may gain
something from the series as a point
of reflection and renewal."
The festival, which is free and
open to everyone, will be showing
films through Dec. 7.
