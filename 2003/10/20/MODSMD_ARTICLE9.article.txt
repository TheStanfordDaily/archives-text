## Harvard study backs Slim-Fast plan 
### ERICA JALLI THE HARVARD CRIMSON 
(U-WIRE) Slim-Fast may want to start mar
keting itself as Slim-Forever, according to the re
sults of a study by a Harvard Medical School re
searcher.
A new study by the school's Abraham Associate
Professor of Nutrition, George Blackburn, sug
gests that replacing meals with the diet drink helps
people lose weight and keep it off for a decade.
In the study, Blackburn, a trustee of the Slim-
Fast Nutritional Institute, had his participants sub
stitute Slim-Fast shakes for two meals a day, fol
lowed by a "sensible dinner."
He began the study in 1992 in a rural township in
Wisconsin that had the highest rate of obesity in the
nation. In the first follow-up, Blackburn says that
openly-recruited participants lost a mean of 15

pounds after a standard 12-week period.
According to Blackburn, this 15 pound loss was
significant because it is the average result of what a
medical weight-loss treatment program would pro
duce.
The participants' progress was charted at five
year intervals. Blackburn says he found that after a
decade, people weighed less than they did at the be
ginning of the study and unlike what usually occurs
with long-term diets, the participants did not regain
any weight.
In fact, Blackburn says that his dieters kept off
an average of seven pounds while the control group
gained half a pound. •
Sponsored by Slim-Fast, the experiment was
only the third study on long-term weight loss and
the only one of its kind since the 19705, according
to Blackburn.
The results of Blackburn's investigation were

presented at last weekend's meeting of the North
American Association for the Study of Obesity.
Blackburn recommends the program for any
one over the age of 18 who is gaining weight as an
adult. He calls the Slim-Fast plan "a scientific, safe
approach to weight control therapy."
"This study proves that, yes, we can avoid gain
ing weight. The epidemic doesn't have to overtake
us," he says.
Blackburn who says he himself has been on the
planforthepast2oyears endorses the plan as some
thing that should be turned into a routine for life.
Blackburn says the participants of the study are
still on the plan, and that those formerly in the con
trol group are now joining the study as well.
"We now have a proven 10 year approach to
weight control," says Blackburn, repeating the
mantra he developed: "Shake, shake, meal. Shake,
shake, meal."
