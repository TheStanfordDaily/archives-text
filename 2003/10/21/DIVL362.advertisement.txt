Philip Zimbardo
Professor of Psychology

12:00-1:00 P.M.
Side Chapel in Memorial Church.
Please feel free to bring your lunch.
ZIMBARDO is internationally recognized as an innovative researcher in many areas of psychology. He has been
called the "voice and image of modern psychology" because of his popular PBS-TV series, Discovering Psychology,
and his best selling text, Psychology and Life, the oldest, continuously selling textbook in psychology. He has
been President of the American Psychological Association (2002) and twice of the Western Psychological
Association.
His Stanford Prison Experiment (1971) is a classic demonstration of the power of situational forces to overwhelm
ordinary, good people. The web site documenting the chronology of that study has gotten more than 8 million
unique page viewers in the past two years. NBC will air a documentary on the study later this year and a major
Hollywood movie is under contract. Considered a leading expert in the area of shyness in adults, Zimbardo's pop
ular trade books continue to be best sellers. Zimbardo's pioneering treatment for shyness has continued for the past
25 years at the Shyness Clinic in Palo Alto, (now directed by Dr. Lynne Henderson.)
What Matters to Me and Why encourages reflection within the Stanford community on matters of personal values, beliefs and motiva'
tions in order to better understand the lives and inspirations of those who shape the University. For more information, contact Rabbi
