In response to the recent California gubernatorial re
call election, UC-Berkeley Prof. Bruce Fuller conduct
ed a study finding that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger re
ceived more coverage than other candidates, tilting the
balance in his favor.
"The New York Times had 35 headlines [about the
recall election] and Schwarzenegger appeared in 34 of
the 35 headlines and poor Cruz Bustamante appeared in
just one," Fuller said. "At week six, Bustamante was
running about eight to 10 points ahead of Schwarzeneg
ger according to the L.A. Times poll, but even [with
Cruz] as the front runner, Schwarzenegger got more
press."
The study analyzed more than 1,500 stories pub
lished by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San
Jose Mercury News and San Francisco Chronicle. Ac
cording to the study, Schwarzenegger and former Gov.
Gray Davis appeared in about 80 percent of stories and
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante was mentioned in about 60
percent of stories.
Fuller's research also showed that print media did
not focus on policy issues.
"As major media covered the candidates, they spent
very little time speaking to issues that affected children
and families," Fuller said. "In the New York Times, for
example, in only one of six stories did they mention the
state budget crisis and education."
Although Schwarzenegger got more print attention,
Phil Yost, the chief editorial writer for the San Jose
Mercury News, said that his newspaper did not cover
Schwarzenegger more favorably because not all of his
coverage was positive.
"We wrote a long profile of him, as we did with the
three or four other major candidates," Yost said. "We
investigated whether he had stretched beyond the limits
of his visa when he first came here to work for a salary
and to start a business. We published the story reported
by the L.A. Times about groping women. As part of the
extra coverage that Schwarzenegger got, we probably
published more negative stories about Schwarzenegger
than about any other candidate."
Yost said that if the San Jose Mercury News covered
