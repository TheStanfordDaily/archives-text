# Rebuilding Ita solus potitus imperio Ancient Romulus; condita urbs Rome Conditoris nomine appellata
## FORMA VRBIS ROMAE 
### GEOFF KOCH 
New technology is shedding light on an old mystery about third century imperial
Rome.
The Stanford Digital Forma Urbis Romae Project is relying on a combination of so
phisticated algorithms and old-fashioned field work to solve the Forma Urbis Romae,
or Marble Plan an archaeological jigsaw puzzle made up of more than 1,000 pieces.
Marc Levoy, project director, said the work of computer science doctoral student
David Koller illustrates the team's momentum.
"David has found half a dozen matches between map fragments in the last six
months more than archaeologists have found in the last decade using manual meth
ods," said Levoy.
With funding from the National Science Foundation and the Paul Allen Founda
tion for the Arts and staff who write code working along others who study ancient cul
ture, the Stanford Digital Forma Urbis Romae Project is far from ordinary. But so is
the Marble Plan.
At a time in Rome when gladiator games reigned as entertainment and Christians
were a small persecuted segment of the population, the Marble Plan measured 60 feet
by 43 feet and hung in one of city's grandest temples, Templum Pacis. Famous monu
ments, commercial infrastructure, and even lesser-known neighborhoods and back al
leys all were etched into its huge surface. Red paint that filled the etchings made the
details of the map stand out starkly against the white marble.
Public buildings did not fare well through the decline and fall of the Roman Em
pire. Over the years, sections of the map were stripped from the temple walls used in
the construction of other buildings or fired in kilns to make lime. Today only 10 to 15
percent of the map survives, existing in 1,186 pieces.
At the core of the project is the work of Levoy and his students to assemble three
dimensional digital models of each of the map fragments and write algorithms that
find out how these fragments fit together. The project's Web site says that "[o]ur pri
mary technological aim ... is to 'solve the map.' "
Before work on assembling the puzzle could begin, the computer science crowd
had to do some field work of its own. In June 1999, a group of Stanford students and
faculty visited Rome and digitized every known piece of the map using lasers scanners
and digital cameras.
While the team left Rome with a huge digital archive 8 billion polygons and
6,000 color images, occupying 40 gigabytes it was not always easy to collect the
data. A paper presented by Levoy in the spring of 2000 at a conference for computer
graphics professionals lists problems ranging from tedium to property rights to damp
and dusty working conditions.
Four years later, work on this data is yielding results.
"During our trip to Rome in June [2003], David presented new matches to archae
ologists there," said Levoy. "He confirmed the matches in a dramatic reopening of the
sealed crates containing the fragments."
Levoy described the excitement of one archaeologist who saw how a fragment that
he had excavated two years ago locked together with its mate, just as Koller predicted
it would.
"He yelled for everyone else to come over, saying 'Ragazzi, attacca!' ('Guys, it
fits!')."
Unfortunately, full assembly of the map may never happen. The existing data rep
resent a mere fraction of the original monument and it may prove impossible ever to
capture exact three-dimensional representations of the fragments due to the chal
lenges in calibrating laser scanners. Sophisticated scanning equipment, jagged frag
ment edges and dank working conditions do not always mix.
Yet this issue of deviant data has created a research opportunity in its own right.
Earlier this month, Levoy, along with graduate students Leslie Ikemoto and Natasha
Gelfand, presented "A Hierarchical Method for Aligning Warped Meshes" at the
Fourth International Conference on three-dimensional Imaging and Modeling in
Banff, Canada. The paper explored ways to compensate for calibration errors that
occur in collecting data with a digital scanner, the academic equivalent of making
lemonade when the data yields lemons.
While research on the algorithms continues, one part of the project is undeniably
successful. The preliminary database of the Marble Plan offers a striking way for mu
seum curators and weekend Indiana Jones types to see fragments of ancient Rome on
their computer desktops.
With detailed digital photos and comprehensive descriptive text, the database em
bodies the collaboration between the classics and computer science pros.
Thanks to the work of Ikemoto and Gelfand, good three-dimensional models exist
for more than half of the fragments. A quick installation of a program called QSplat
written by Szymon Rusinkiewicz a Princeton computer science professor who
earned his doctoral degree at Stanford in 2001 allows users to rotate, zoom and ad
just the lighting of realistic models of the fragments.
Roller's calendar is already filling up to talk about his research results. He will present at
a U.S. conference in January and at two conferences in Italy later in the spring.
"The conference in Rome in March has been organized partly around his findings,"
said Levoy. "It will be a busy year for him."
