### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
"I wish I was little bit taller,
I wish I was a bailer
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a '64 Impala"

Much like the latter-day sociologist Skee-Lo, college men
and women, while envisioning their future spouses, some
times dwell on one particular aspect: height. While some
folks would like their significant others to be of a certain
height, others might fantasize about their own height: Some
thing along the lines of a miraculous overnight growth. So
what exactly is the ideal height for a man or for a woman?
Certainly, the answer to this question varies, depending on
whom you ask; however, we would like to model this in
triguing problem and arrive at a global optimum.
Let's start by coining the term "ideal height." Due to social
conventions, we assume that most men in this country would
like their girlfriends or wives to be five inches shorter than they
are. Vice versa, most American women would like their
boyfriends or husbands to be five inches taller. Given this cus
tom, intuitively, if a man is petite, he probably doesn't have

many options for a wife; on the other hand, if he is overly tall, the
range of women he would be interested in must be quite limited
as well (I'm almost certain that Robert Wadlow, once the tallest
man in the world at 8-foot-4, wasn't too happy with his romantic
life). Since the same situation applies to women, we can see that
for both genders, there is an "acceptable range" of height differ
ences they consciously or subconsciously impose on their future
significant others. The ideal height, then, could be defined as the
height at which the highest number of potential spouses falls into
its corresponding "acceptable range."
Let's model the height distribution of all American women
as a normal distribution curve, also known as the bell-shaped
curve. The bell curve, as you all recall from your probability
class, approximates the macroscopic properties of many nat
ural phenomena that involve a large number of random
events. Let's assume further that the ideal height difference
that a woman desires between herself and her significant
other is five inches, and that the "acceptable range" is four to
seven inches. The corresponding figures for men, then, would
be an ideal height difference of negative five inches and an
"acceptable range" of negative seven to negative four inches.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, the average U.S. woman between the ages of 18
and 24 is 5-foot-3.7 tall with a standard deviation of 2.5 inch
es. Hence, the distribution of American women's height
could be modeled with the following equation:

v = e"f-fa-uV)
2(Z) !

(V(2it)l)

Where x is the woman's height and y is the percentage of
American woman with height x, X=2.5 inches and p=s-foot
-3.7.
For a man q inches tall, the percentage of women that fall
in his "acceptable range" could be obtained from the fol
lowing integral:
Z=J^y<ta
The q that maximizes this equation is 5.5 inches above the
average woman's height. Hence, the ideal height for men is
5-foot-9.2.
If we apply the same procedure to American men (aver
age 5-foot-9.1), we could obtain the following result:
Women's ideal height is 5-foot-3.6,5.5 inches below the av
erage man's height.
Luckily the ideal heights are not so far away from each
gender's average heights themselves.
But for all of you ladies out there worrying you are too
short, have no fear: I am only 5-foot-8.
