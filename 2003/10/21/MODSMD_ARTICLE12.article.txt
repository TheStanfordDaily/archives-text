# The 						Stanford Daily Editorials
## Review's reporting shaky 
### 
On Oct. 13, The Stanford Review pub
lished an editorial called "MEChA: So
cial Justice Group or KKK?" The paper
also ran a news article with the banner
headline "An Investigation of Racism within
MEChA."
MEChA, or Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan, is an organization of Latino students that has
recently come under fire for supposedly racist state
ments that are contained within some of its founding
documents. The Stanford chapter, as well as the na
tional organization, has disavowed any racist intent
and claims that the documents are preserved for their
historical value.
The Review's articles demonstrate journalistic ir
responsibility on behalf of the paper. Both articles
contain inflammatory statements without evidence
that would support their use. To begin with the most
egregious example, the title of the editorial compar
ing MEChA to the Ku Klux Klan is an example of
disingenuous, dishonest journalism designed to shock
readers in order to draw them into the editorial.
Some references in the context of world history
are considered inherently malicious, including or
ganizations such as the Nazis and the Ku Klux
Klan. When using these sorts of comparisons, any
newspaper should be careful that the evidence
supports the use of such a comparison. Although
The Review qualifies its use of the Ku Klux Klan
within the editorial to be a comparison to the mod
ern-day Ku Klux Klan, which it claims is for some
reason more acceptable than the historical Ku
Klux Klan, the headline is where the damage is
done. No qualifying statement within the editorial
can save the argument.
The use of this comparison was unwarranted

when one considers that The Review criticizes
MEChA for attempting to uphold its own particu
lar culture and unite Hispanics regardless of their
particular nationality. For example, there are no al
legations that MEChA advocates violence or sys
tematically oppresses people of other races con
tained within the articles. In fact, The Review
specifically rejects this element of the comparison,
despite the fact that these are connotations that the
Ku Klux Klan inevitably evokes.
Of course, The Review is entitled to its opinion about
whether or not MEChA is a racist organization or is in
appropriately supporting an organization that is racist.
But, The Review should not use shock journalism to get
its point across.
The news article that the Review ran was also sus
pect. The article ends with the sentence, "It is time
for Stanford MEChA to rethink with whom it wants
to unite." This sort of statement is more appropriate
for the editorial page, but its use in the news section
is inappropriate, demonstrating an unacceptable
bias on behalf of The Review.
The conservative voice on Stanford's campus is
already presumed to be rather muted. When one of
the few bastions of conservatism on campus sullies
itself by making such flagrant, unethical statements,
it further damages the ability of the conservative el
ement of Stanford's campus to participate in politi
cal discussion. Comparing MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan when no evidence exists in support of the ar
gument it is a violation of journalistic integrity. It
destroys the Review's credibility and ostracizes
many of its potential centrist and center-right read
ers. The Review should in the future exercise more
journalistic integrity and restraint in order to make
sure that its voice is respected.
