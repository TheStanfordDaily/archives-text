# Kudos to dean, faculty for reforms
## 
### 
After two years of rebuilding, the Center
for Latin American Studies is putting
forward a proposal to regain its de
gree-granting privileges. Last
Wednesday, Prof. Jim Fox the center's director
introduced such a proposal to the Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, and we ap
plaud the efforts of both the center and of the
School to reform and revamp the Latin American
Studies program.
In fall of 2001, the Committee for Undergradu
ate Studies and the Committee for Graduate Stud
ies recommended that the center lose its bachelor's
and master's degree-granting privileges. Citing the
lack of a capstone project at the undergraduate
level, a dearth of faculty involvement, and an un
clear progression of classes within the program, the
committees took away degree-granting authority
from the programs which had been on probation
for the previous three years.
But the Dean's Office did not turn its back on
the program after degree-granting authority was
taken away. Instead of allowing the program to
wither away, the Dean's Office has spent the past
Jwo years working in conjunction with the center
to fully address the concerns voiced by the com
mittees. The Dean's Office has committed itself
to providing feedback in response to the reforms
proposed and carried out by the center, and a con
sistent line of communication has been upheld
throughout the process.
The bachelor's program currently proposed by
Fox and the Center for Latin American Studies
would increase the number of required introduc
tory courses from one to two, and students would
also be obligated to take a course in theory and
methods. Such reforms will help to create a de

fined progression of classes within the Latin
American Studies program. These reforms will
also help to provide students with a broader base
of knowledge with which to pursue their special
ized studies.
The proposed reforms will also create a more
comprehensive field of study within the master's
degree program. The prior program comprised a
duration of three quarters and a summer of field
study; the recent reforms will extend the program
to a fourth quarter, to be completed after the sum
mer field study. The new program will allow stu
dents to take their field study experiences into the
classroom and to refine their specialized studies
from an outside perspective.
Although student interest in the Latin Ameri
can Studies program wasn't as high as it could be
before the revocation of the center's degree
granting privileges, the reformation of the major is
very important to the Stanford community. The
re-establishment of a sound and comprehensive
Latin American Studies program will stimulate in
tellectual debate and discussion regarding issues
within the field of study, and students interested in
such a program will again be granted the opportu
nity to pursue their academic interests in a rigor
ous and well-structured program.
We applaud the Center for Latin American
Studies and the Dean's Office in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences for their willingness to ad
dress the concerns raised two years ago and to bring
a reinvigorated program back to the table for stu
dents. Hie hard work and cooperation demonstrat
ed in this reform process is emblematic of Stanford
at its very best, and will long serve as an example of
how campus offices should cooperate to make
Stanford a better university.
