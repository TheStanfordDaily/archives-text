## YOU GO GABE Taking community service lying down 
### 
When it comes to community
service, I have to admit
that I'm not actively seek
ing out opportunities to volunteer at
Stanford. Sure, I've donated blood
once or twice and enjoy tutoring lit
tle kids, but finding volunteer work
here is like drinking water out of a
fire hose and in the writhing junk
heap that is my e-mail inbox, even
important announcements can get
lost in the shuffle. So when I re
ceived a mass e-mail promoting the
Asian American Donor Program's
Bone Marrow Typing Drive, I
wouldn't have given it a second
thought were it not for a large pho
tograph of an adorable girl named
Chloe, maybe around one year old,
clapping her hands and looking up
wards as if a butterfly or mutant
squirrel had momentarily held her
attention. For her parents, Castano
Resident Fellows Gordon Chang
and Vicki Sandin, this year's drive
holds a special significance. It repre
sents hope for their daughter, who
currently suffers from leukemia.
Her condition, which has declined in
recent weeks, has turned dire
enough to require a bone marrow
transplant.
That's why this Oct. 30 and 31,
Lambda Phi Epsilon and the Asian
American Donor Program's expect
hundreds of minority students to sign
up for the National Marrow Donor
Program Registry in White Plaza.
Could one of these "everyday
heroes" hold Chloe's future within?
A simple blood test a prick on the
finger by a licensed phlebotomist
is all that is required to find out.

"I could go for that," I thought to
myself at the time, but inevitably
the quintessential question that

plagues every
good textbook
buying, phone
bill-paying college
student crept into
my mind: How
much is this going
to cost me? Even
my dear, loving
parents will tell
you I'm a pretty
cheap guy. Hell, I
even keep cereal

in my room so I don't have to pay
Stanford Dining for a pint-sized
bowl. But thanks to national fund
ing and the hard work of the Lamb
das, typing is free for all minorities.
This is good news for the Changs
and other minority patients across
America, who, according to NBC,
are at the greatest risk of not find
ing a match due to the dearth of mi
nority and mixed-race "typees" in
the registry.
Recognizing the importance of
this event, a few academic depart
ments (History and Asian Studies)
have donated financially, and sever
al dedicated volunteers have
stepped forth to help. However, the
Asian American Donor Program re
mains in need of funding for both
typing and publicity costs, and sheer
manpower could use a boost as well.
Considering the life-saving nature
of the drive, it's time for other
groups to step up to the plate. A
generous donation from any
wealthy beneficiary perhaps

even the University itself could
transform this year's drive from a
primarily local affair to a national
campaign. Where are the Bill
Gates of the world when you need
them? Alas, no such miracle has
been forthcoming but they do
have plenty of volunteers, right?
Well, sort of. The Asian American
Donor Program, which attracted
numbers as high as 200 typees in
past years, has increased this year's
goal to a lofty 800, meaning that (if
the multiplication tables serve me
correctly) there is four times more
work to be done. Even the Lamb
das, who transform into raging
overachievers the week before the
drive, can't do it all. Wannabe vol
unteers even ones who don't
have time to do anything but put up
flyers in Cedro can help by con
tacting Connie Chan immediately
at cmchan@stanford.edu.
Despite tough odds and logistical
obstacles, the Lambdas and the
Changs remain hopeful for a match.
The plight of the Changs has cast a
personal light on leukemia at Stan
ford, making the Asian American
Donor Program's goal of 800 partic
ipants not only believable, but
achievable. Though the stakes are
high, it will only take the gift of one
person to bring hope and life to a
child sorely in need of a miracle.
