MEChA not analogous to KKK
While I appreciate the fervor of
the author of the recent Stanford
Review article regarding MEChA,
I think it almost studiously ignores
the history leading to the forma
tion of a group such as MEChA.
MEChA, and other Latino organi
zations' response ought to be one
of education. Many people are not
familiar with the history of Mexi
can-Americans, Hispanics and
Chicanos in this country, particu
larly in the Southwest. An article
which recounts the fact that al
though so many Latinos paid taxes
and have worked honorably in this
country for so long and yet often
were denied access to publicly
funded universities and are even
today fighting a legal battle with
the state of California over the
conditions children face in ele
mentary schools (no textbooks or
bathrooms, among them) would
go quite far I think in placing the
nature of MEChA in context.
A supremacist group is one that
seeks to conserve power only for
itself. One cannot truly call
MEChA such a group since people
of Mexican descent in California
— and the greater southwest —
have seen periods of great lack of
power. It was only 60 years ago
that banks in the city of Los Ange
les had policies whereby they
would not finance sales of houses
in particular neighborhoods to
people of Mexican ancestry.
The Review is right to be wary
of supremacist groups. However, a
group that seeks to affirm and sup
port a culture is not a supremacist
group. In its article, The Review
seeks to inflame readers against
MEChA by citing the fact that stu
dents involved in MEChA seek
rights for workers at Stanford's
Webb ranch. I am not clear why
this should be something shame
ful. Further, I am not clear why
someone would be turned against
an organization because it pro
motes its members feeling that
they are a "free nation." With an
understanding of the history in the
Americas of the decimation of in
digenous peoples, I find it hard to
believe that someone at Stanford
finds it scary that the few remain
ing indigenous peoples on this
continent seek to preserve their
culture.
I wish the students of Stanford
much luck and much strength as
you seek to explain the impor
tance — historically and culturally
— of student groups for students
who have traditionally been ex
cluded or marginalized from im
portant institutions such as Stan-

ford. Please know that there are
many alumni who are in support of
students' continued effort to use
their education to promote an un
derstanding and respect for their
culture. These attacks from The
Review, devoid as they are of any
understanding of history and em
pathy whatsoever for a people who
has so consistently been marginal
ized here in California, are diffi
cult, if not impossible, to read
without chuckling, "Poor thing,
you have so much yet to learn."
I challenge The Review to use
their time at this fine university to
learn something new and not just
toe a party line that says that any
thing that speaks of race is bad.
Race and culture are not bad and
pride in culture is not bad, espe
cially if that pride has been sys
tematically challenged for over
500 years. Take a history course.

MEChA member explains why
group denied The Review
an interview
I am writing to answer Seth
Ort's letter to the editor (Oct. 17)
concerning MEChA declining an
official interview with The Stan
ford Review. Let me explain the
context in which The Review was
denied an interview. The first time
I read The Review fall quarter of
last year, I asked myself if it was a
real paper because every article
had a clear bias regardless of
whether or not it was in the Opin
ions section. I concluded that The
Review was not an objective news
paper but rather a mouthpiece for
a conservative viewpoint with a
consistent stance that attacked
many campus ethnic organizations
and issues.
Upon returning to campus this
year, The Review printed two arti
cles in the first issue of volume
XXXI that mentioned MEChA as
a racist / separatist organization as
well as many other misleading and
inaccurate statements. An article
by Alec Rawls went so far as to
warn Stanford students of joining
MEChA, stating, "Stanford stu
dents who are thinking of joining
this group be warned: You will be
marked for life. This country will
not long tolerate your Nazi party."
Many students including MEChA
members share my viewpoint that
The Review is a biased publication
with a clear agenda. When we
were approached for an interview
we declined because given The
Review's recent articles, and its

history of attacking ethnic organi
zations like MEChA, we felt that it
was not in our best interests to do
so. Since The Review attacked
MEChA, it did not make sense to
grant an interview despite their
claims of investigative reporting.
After The Review did not receive
an official interview, a reporter
came to a MEChA meeting unan
nounced. Coincidentally, part of
the meeting was spent discussing
The Review article and its claims.
We discussed the nature of our or
ganization, our history and the in
accuracies presented in the article.
The reporter was present through
out this discussion and contributed
by asking questions about how we
worked, our philosophy and our
position. After the meeting ad
journed, we continued to answer
her questions in an effort to clear
up any misconceptions she may
have had. In answering her ques
tions, we emphasized the misun
derstandings and inaccuracies pre
sented in the previous issue. Es
sentially, The Review was given an
unofficial interview, and our an
swers should have been more than
enough to prevent their subse
quent inflammatory articles.
The Review wrote in its editori
al, "What we found was that Stan
ford MEChA's goals do not coin
cide with the separatist goals of
the national organization, yet
there's a hesitance to denounce
these policies on the leaderships'
part of Stanford MEChA." Per
haps their reporter failed to in
form their staff that there is no Na
tional MEChA, and that Stanford
MEChA like all other MEChA
chapters are completely au
tonomous. This would have
cleared up the insinuation that we
are affiliated with a National
MEChA whose goals are sepa
ratist and racist. While there is no
National MEChA from which we
can renounce affiliation, there is a
National MEChA Coordinating
Committee. This committee is
comprised of representatives from
many MEChA chapters. The sole
goal of this committee is to orga
nize a three-day National Confer
ence for MEChA chapters across
the nation. The conference is an
opportunity to meet with other
chapters to exchange ideas and to
attend educational workshops.
Other than organizing a confer
ence, National MEChA Coordi
nating Committee has no power
over MEChA chapters, and it does
not issue any policy that MEChA
chapters must follow. There sim
ply is no National MEChA.
The Review is a student news
paper that has the freedom to
print under the first amendment,
however, this protection comes
with the responsibility of fairness
and ethical reporting. If The Re
view is going to report on
MEChA, its history, and its orga
nizational structure, it should
make an honest attempt at look
ing at the facts rather than mis
leading the Stanford Community
in what can only be called li

belous, and outrageous articles.

Daniel Pipes has consistently
argued for curbing Muslim-Amer

ment of mosques, Muslim Sunday
schools, associations and so on.
Last January, he unabashedly
called for nationwide religious
profiling of Muslims. He predi
cates this by fabricating images as
sociating Islam with terrorism,

which in the past have resulted in
tragic hatecrimes perpetrated
against Muslim communities in the
United States. I pray that his
speech does not plant seeds of dis
trust on this campus, which he has
monitored and scrutinized via
Campus Watch for a year. I'm not
sure whether I am more horrified
by his insistent bigotry or his per

It is appalling that the Hoover In

MEChA not analogous to KKK
While I appreciate the fervor of
the author of the recent Stanford
Review article regarding MEChA,
I think it almost studiously ignores
the history leading to the forma
tion of a group such as MEChA.
MEChA, and other Latino organi
zations' response ought to be one
of education. Many people are not
familiar with the history of Mexi
can-Americans, Hispanics and
Chicanos in this country, particu
larly in the Southwest. An article
which recounts the fact that al
though so many Latinos paid taxes
and have worked honorably in this
country for so long and yet often
were denied access to publicly
funded universities and are even
today fighting a legal battle with
the state of California over the
conditions children face in ele
mentary schools (no textbooks or
bathrooms, among them) would
go quite far I think in placing the
nature of MEChA in context.
A supremacist group is one that
seeks to conserve power only for
itself. One cannot truly call
MEChA such a group since people
of Mexican descent in California
— and the greater southwest —
have seen periods of great lack of
power. It was only 60 years ago
that banks in the city of Los Ange
les had policies whereby they
would not finance sales of houses
in particular neighborhoods to
people of Mexican ancestry.
The Review is right to be wary
of supremacist groups. However, a
group that seeks to affirm and sup
port a culture is not a supremacist
group. In its article, The Review
seeks to inflame readers against
MEChA by citing the fact that stu
dents involved in MEChA seek
rights for workers at Stanford's
Webb ranch. I am not clear why
this should be something shame
ful. Further, I am not clear why
someone would be turned against
an organization because it pro
motes its members feeling that
they are a "free nation." With an
understanding of the history in the
Americas of the decimation of in
digenous peoples, I find it hard to
believe that someone at Stanford
finds it scary that the few remain
ing indigenous peoples on this
continent seek to preserve their
culture.
I wish the students of Stanford
much luck and much strength as
you seek to explain the impor
tance — historically and culturally
— of student groups for students
who have traditionally been ex
cluded or marginalized from im
portant institutions such as Stan-

ford. Please know that there are
many alumni who are in support of
students' continued effort to use
their education to promote an un
derstanding and respect for their
culture. These attacks from The
Review, devoid as they are of any
understanding of history and em
pathy whatsoever for a people who
has so consistently been marginal
ized here in California, are diffi
cult, if not impossible, to read
without chuckling, "Poor thing,
you have so much yet to learn."
I challenge The Review to use
their time at this fine university to
learn something new and not just
toe a party line that says that any
thing that speaks of race is bad.
Race and culture are not bad and
pride in culture is not bad, espe
cially if that pride has been sys
tematically challenged for over
500 years. Take a history course.

MEChA member explains why
group denied The Review
an interview
I am writing to answer Seth
Ort's letter to the editor (Oct. 17)
concerning MEChA declining an
official interview with The Stan
ford Review. Let me explain the
context in which The Review was
denied an interview. The first time
I read The Review fall quarter of
last year, I asked myself if it was a
real paper because every article
had a clear bias regardless of
whether or not it was in the Opin
ions section. I concluded that The
Review was not an objective news
paper but rather a mouthpiece for
a conservative viewpoint with a
consistent stance that attacked
many campus ethnic organizations
and issues.
Upon returning to campus this
year, The Review printed two arti
cles in the first issue of volume
XXXI that mentioned MEChA as
a racist / separatist organization as
well as many other misleading and
inaccurate statements. An article
by Alec Rawls went so far as to
warn Stanford students of joining
MEChA, stating, "Stanford stu
dents who are thinking of joining
this group be warned: You will be
marked for life. This country will
not long tolerate your Nazi party."
Many students including MEChA
members share my viewpoint that
The Review is a biased publication
with a clear agenda. When we
were approached for an interview
we declined because given The
Review's recent articles, and its

history of attacking ethnic organi
zations like MEChA, we felt that it
was not in our best interests to do
so. Since The Review attacked
MEChA, it did not make sense to
grant an interview despite their
claims of investigative reporting.
After The Review did not receive
an official interview, a reporter
came to a MEChA meeting unan
nounced. Coincidentally, part of
the meeting was spent discussing
The Review article and its claims.
We discussed the nature of our or
ganization, our history and the in
accuracies presented in the article.
The reporter was present through
out this discussion and contributed
by asking questions about how we
worked, our philosophy and our
position. After the meeting ad
journed, we continued to answer
her questions in an effort to clear
up any misconceptions she may
have had. In answering her ques
tions, we emphasized the misun
derstandings and inaccuracies pre
sented in the previous issue. Es
sentially, The Review was given an
unofficial interview, and our an
swers should have been more than
enough to prevent their subse
quent inflammatory articles.
The Review wrote in its editori
al, "What we found was that Stan
ford MEChA's goals do not coin
cide with the separatist goals of

there's a hesitance to denounce
these policies on the leaderships'
