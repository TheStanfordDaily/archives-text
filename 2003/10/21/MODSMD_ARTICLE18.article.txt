## Five Forgotten Schools 
### JOHN E. CHUBB 
The increasing demand for char
ter schools and the educational op
tions they provide has been elevated
by the belief that urban schools need
dramatic improvement. But why
hasn't this push produced more re
sults? The story of five forgotten
schools serves as one example of the
hypocrisy of some school reform
opponents of major change claiming
they want to improve schools but
being satisfied with merely blocking
change.
In December 2000, at the prod
ding of former-Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the New York City Board
of Education made national head
lines by initiating a bold reform to
improve five of its most chronically
poor-performing schools. The
schools were to be partnered with a
private manager to turn them
around. Edison Schools, Inc. had
been selected after a lengthy re
view process involving multiple ap
plicants to run PS 161 in Harlem,
PS 66 in the Bronx and MS 320, MS
246 and IS 111 in Brooklyn.
But there was one stipulation.
The parents at each school had to
vote to approve the initiative. In no
time, local activist organizations and
the city teachers union, all with vest
ed interests in keeping the schools
under direct board control,

launched a noisy campaign of misin
formation denouncing Edison as a
profiteer, the mayor as an enemy of
public education and the board as a
bunch of backroom dirty dealers.
The initiative was voted down in all
five schools.
Lost in the debate was the tragic
disservice these schools were doing
to children. In January 2001, while
activists were defending the schools
against outside intervention, the
schools were quietly failing most of
their students. On average, only 19
percent at each school achieved pro
ficiency on the New York state read
ing assessment. Of course, the
protesters promised to work for the
schools' improvement after the vot
ing was over.
But what happened? One school,
IS 111, was closed and another, MS
320, was reconstituted. The four
schools that remain open in their
new or original forms continue to
fail their students miserably. Two
years later, reading proficiency rates
have improved only 4 percent on av
erage.
Meanwhile, Edison has been
working with community groups
elsewhere in the state the Bronx,
Buffalo, Rochester, Albany and
Riverhead to open six charter
schools. These schools serve chil
dren with high levels of economic
need whose test scores two years ago

looked just like the scores in the five
New York City schools. But today,
those charter schools have taken
their students to promising heights,
raising their state reading scores an
average of 17 percent. One has to
wonder whether this kind of
progress could have come to the five
schools now sadly forgotten in
New York City.
The New York City Board of Ed
ucation has been dissolved, replaced
by direct mayoral control of the
schools. The new chancellor, Joel
Klein, is not beholden to any of the
groups that squelched the partner
ship with Edison. The politics of
school reform now hinges on the
support for Mayor Mike
Bloomberg, who appoints the chan
cellor. Thus far, Chancellor Klein
has shown tremendous resolve to
buck the status quo, maintain a
focus on children at all costs and em
brace ideas his predecessors found
too hot to handle. For the sake of the
hundreds of troubled New York
City public schools, let's hope he
keeps it up.
