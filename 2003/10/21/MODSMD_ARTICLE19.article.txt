## Maloney Field: Worth the trip or stay home? 
### 
This summer, my time was spent interning at
"Good Morning America," a fabulous
morning news show that I never watch any
more due to the ludicrous time of day it's shown. If
making my 9 a.m. class is a struggle, a 7 a.m. gabfest
isn't gonna happen either (take notes, "Cold
Pizza").
But let me tell you, there is nothing worse than
being cooped up in an office all summer with
copiers and VCRs, missing out on quality MTV
reruns, bad Comedy Central shows and back-to
back-to-back-to-back showings of Sports Center.
Thankfully, I had a computer, and I was able
to salvage my summer by following a series of ar
ticles devised by ESPN.com's Page 2 staff. Three
writers went on "The Great American Ballpark
Tour," grading every Major League Baseball Sta
dium on categories ranging from "Quality of Hot
Dogs," to "Quality of Scoreboard" to my person
al favorite "Trading-Up Factor," the ease of get
ting a better seat mid-game.
So, being the genius I am (...and I am), I

thought to myself, "Spencer,
being the genius you are, why
don't you apply the same criteria
to Stanford sports, to find the
best fan experience at a sporting
event on the Farm!"
And to think I wasn't even
Cum Laude in high school.
So I give you: The Ultimate
Stanford Fan Experience.
The first installment:
Women's Soccer.

I attended the women's highly touted game
against No. 3 UCLA last Friday, and used a sci
entifically proven (Read: make-believe) set of 10
grading categories to judge the worthiness of a
women's soccer game.
No. 1: Quality of Game and Sport. There is no
doubt that I'm biased here, but soccer is a glorious
sport. As Matt Damon's character in "Dogma"
accurately stated, "Mass Genocide is the most ex
hausting activity one can engage in, next to soc
cer." How true. It's a great sport, and UCLA vs.
Stanford was a great game between two national
powerhouses. My score? Eight out of 10.
No. 2: Ability to Find a Seat 10 Minutes Late.
Let's be honest. All you Stanford kids out there
never show up on time. You are the ones who
show up seven minutes late for your 10 a.m. lec
ture and are too shy to buck up and forge into the
rows and find a seat, so you patiently sit in the
aisle for 43 minutes. Well, not at a women's soc
cer game. Good seats are available throughout,
and behind the opposing goal is always a welcom
ing spot. My score? Eight.
No. 3: Ticket Price Pretty fair, a couple bucks,
and discounts are frequently available. Behind
the goal is free, of course. And of course, I'm a
varsity athlete, so I never have to pay anyway
(hehehe ...). My score? Nine.
No. 4: Usher / Security Friendliness. A con
stant sore spot for regulars of men's games who
claim that the redcoats have a quick trigger finger
for ejections, but at this game they were friendly,
and even struck up a pleasant conversation. My
score? Seven.
No. 5: Beauty of Event Site: Maloney Stadi
um, while all concrete, provides a solid place to
watch a night game. My score? Seven.
No. 6: Fun Stuff Besides the Game. While
Maloney Stadium itself doesn't provide any cool
quirks or beautiful architecture, the halftime
show is quite entertaining, with four has-beens
shooting soccer balls at the goal. Especially enter
taining are grad students, who take it particularly
seriously. My score? Eight.
No. 7: Food. A disappointment for anyone,
even those coming out of Stern, who must fork
over three bucks for a small soda with an absurd
amount of ice. 800. My score? Two.
No. 8: Cool Gear / Marketing/Public Address
system. The marketing table at the game was filled
with great Stanford soccer gear of yesteryear at
great prices. The P. A. system was crisp and loud,
with a special mentioning of Stanford Soccer
alumni in attendance. My score? Nine.
No. 9: Fan Knowledge. It was better than the
referee's. My score? Eight.
No. 10: Other Fans. In probably the biggest
flaw of the evening, it became very apparent who
was in the audience after Stanford had a scoring
chance in the second half. As the Cardinal ad
vanced the ball, this reporter had to cover his ears
due to the absurdly high-pitched screams of hun
dreds of pre-pubescent girls. Also of note was the
ridiculously annoying kid who tried to sell me
keychains no less than six times. After repeated
inquiries as to why he was selling keychains at a
women's soccer game, he divulged to me that he
was in debt to the concession stand for a soda. I
felt bad; I bought a chain. All in all, the intense
family presence merits a score of three.
Wild Card: The game was televised, and many
times this young aspiring thespian made it onto
the camera, an outcome that made the 0-0 tie (a
good result, but usually indicative of a boring
game) a bit more exciting. However, I enjoyed
myself, didn't get kicked out and with Hot Stuff
out of my life, I'm not going to burn any bridges
with any women's teams. My score? 15.
Final Score: a very respectable 84.
So take heed Stanford athletic teams, this re
porter is out to find the best Stanford Student Fan
Experience. Is it women's soccer? Is it football?
Or is it some unheralded sport? Maybe, dare I say
it, crew?
No. No, it's not crew. But we will have a win
ner, so keep in touch.

Spencer Porter, a junior, is happy he came up with
this series so he doesn't have to think of other origi
nal ideas in the weeks to come. If you think crew is

being the genius you are, why
don't you apply the same criteria
to Stanford sports, to find the
best fan experience at a sporting
event on the Farm!"
And to think I wasn't even
Cum Laude in high school.
So I give you: The Ultimate
Stanford Fan Experience.
The first installment:
Women's Soccer.

I attended the women's highly touted game
against No. 3 UCLA last Friday, and used a sci
entifically proven (Read: make-believe) set of 10
grading categories to judge the worthiness of a
women's soccer game.
No. 1: Quality of Game and Sport. There is no
doubt that I'm biased here, but soccer is a glorious
sport. As Matt Damon's character in "Dogma"
accurately stated, "Mass Genocide is the most ex
hausting activity one can engage in, next to soc
cer." How true. It's a great sport, and UCLA vs.
Stanford was a great game between two national
powerhouses. My score? Eight out of 10.
No. 2: Ability to Find a Seat 10 Minutes Late.
Let's be honest. All you Stanford kids out there
never show up on time. You are the ones who
show up seven minutes late for your 10 a.m. lec
ture and are too shy to buck up and forge into the
rows and find a seat, so you patiently sit in the
aisle for 43 minutes. Well, not at a women's soc
cer game. Good seats are available throughout,
and behind the opposing goal is always a welcom
ing spot. My score? Eight.
No. 3: Ticket Price Pretty fair, a couple bucks,
and discounts are frequently available. Behind
the goal is free, of course. And of course, I'm a
varsity athlete, so I never have to pay anyway
(hehehe ...). My score? Nine.
No. 4: Usher / Security Friendliness. A con
stant sore spot for regulars of men's games who
claim that the redcoats have a quick trigger finger
for ejections, but at this game they were friendly,
and even struck up a pleasant conversation. My
score? Seven.
No. 5: Beauty of Event Site: Maloney Stadi
um, while all concrete, provides a solid place to
watch a night game. My score? Seven.
No. 6: Fun Stuff Besides the Game. While
Maloney Stadium itself doesn't provide any cool
quirks or beautiful architecture, the halftime
show is quite entertaining, with four has-beens
shooting soccer balls at the goal. Especially enter
taining are grad students, who take it particularly
seriously. My score? Eight.
No. 7: Food. A disappointment for anyone,
even those coming out of Stern, who must fork
over three bucks for a small soda with an absurd
amount of ice. 800. My score? Two.
No. 8: Cool Gear / Marketing/Public Address
system. The marketing table at the game was filled
with great Stanford soccer gear of yesteryear at
great prices. The P. A. system was crisp and loud,
with a special mentioning of Stanford Soccer
alumni in attendance. My score? Nine.
No. 9: Fan Knowledge. It was better than the
referee's. My score? Eight.
No. 10: Other Fans. In probably the biggest
flaw of the evening, it became very apparent who
was in the audience after Stanford had a scoring
chance in the second half. As the Cardinal ad
vanced the ball, this reporter had to cover his ears
due to the absurdly high-pitched screams of hun
dreds of pre-pubescent girls. Also of note was the
ridiculously annoying kid who tried to sell me
keychains no less than six times. After repeated
inquiries as to why he was selling keychains at a
women's soccer game, he divulged to me that he
was in debt to the concession stand for a soda. I
felt bad; I bought a chain. All in all, the intense
family presence merits a score of three.
Wild Card: The game was televised, and many
times this young aspiring thespian made it onto
the camera, an outcome that made the 0-0 tie (a
good result, but usually indicative of a boring
game) a bit more exciting. However, I enjoyed
myself, didn't get kicked out and with Hot Stuff
out of my life, I'm not going to burn any bridges
with any women's teams. My score? 15.
Final Score: a very respectable 84.
So take heed Stanford athletic teams, this re
porter is out to find the best Stanford Student Fan
Experience. Is it women's soccer? Is it football?
Or is it some unheralded sport? Maybe, dare I say
it, crew?
No. No, it's not crew. But we will have a win
ner, so keep in touch.

Spencer Porter, a junior, is happy he came up with
this series so he doesn't have to think of other origi
nal ideas in the weeks to come. If you think crew is
fun to watch, e-mail him atporters@stanford.ediL

This summer, my time was spent interning at
"Good Morning America," a fabulous
morning news show that I never watch any
more due to the ludicrous time of day it's shown. If
making my 9 a.m. class is a struggle, a 7 a.m. gabfest
isn't gonna happen either (take notes, "Cold
Pizza").
But let me tell you, there is nothing worse than
being cooped up in an office all summer with
copiers and VCRs, missing out on quality MTV
reruns, bad Comedy Central shows and back-to
back-to-back-to-back showings of Sports Center.
Thankfully, I had a computer, and I was able
to salvage my summer by following a series of ar
ticles devised by ESPN.com's Page 2 staff. Three
writers went on "The Great American Ballpark
Tour," grading every Major League Baseball Sta
dium on categories ranging from "Quality of Hot
Dogs," to "Quality of Scoreboard" to my person
al favorite "Trading-Up Factor," the ease of get
ting a better seat mid-game.
So, being the genius I am (...and I am), I

thought to myself, "Spencer,
being the genius you are, why
don't you apply the same criteria
to Stanford sports, to find the
best fan experience at a sporting
event on the Farm!"
And to think I wasn't even
