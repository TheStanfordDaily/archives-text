# State to investigate Hospital
## California Department of Helath Services will look into union allegation of inadequate nursing staff levels at hospital 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
The California Department of Health Services will
be investigating Stanford Hospital in the next several
weeks in response to union complaints about inade
quate nursing staff levels.
The hospital recently made the move to eliminate
113 nursing assistant positions and create registered
nurse positions in their place to comply with a new state
law. The recently passed bill requires hospitals to in
crease their registered nurse-to-patient ratio. The law,
AB 394, will take effect in 2004.
SEIU Local 715, the labor union that represents
Stanford Hospital's nursing assistants and staff, charges
that this decision violates the spirit of the law. SEIU be
lieves that the law was intended to increase the overall
staff to patient ratio, and not to replace unlicensed
workers with licensed ones as the hospital has done.
"SEIU filed a complaint with the Department of
Health Services because Stanford Hospital did not lis
ten to the input of affected parties, such as complaints
from registered nurses and nursing staff, when it made
its decision," said Andrew Hagelshaw, communication
director for SEIU Local 715.
Hagelshaw said that nursing assistants are vital to
quality patient care because they perform tasks that
registered nurses are reluctant to do such as chang
ing bedpans and shaving facial hair.
Glenda Canfield, a registered nurse and the nursing
policy director for the SEIU Nurse Alliance, which
represents 30,000 registered nurses in California, pro
vided proposals to state legislators and lobbied them
for AB 394 to be passed. She said that Stanford Hos
pital's actions go against the intent of the law, which
was to fix problematic staffing levels at hospitals
around the state.
"Registered nurses and nursing assistants are not in
terchangeable," Canfield said. "Registered nurses can
do everything that a nursing assistant can do. The ques
tion is, are they going to have time to do those things?"
Both Hagelshaw and Canfield said that if Stanford
Hospital is allowed to continue this course of action, it

would set a negative precedent for hospitals throughout
the state.
Dr. Lawrence Shuer, chief of staff at Stanford Hos
pital and Clinics, defended the hospital's decision as fol
lowing the state's new regulations.
"We need to change the scale mix so that we can
have a higher registered nurse to patient ratio," Shuer
said. "The hospital does not have an endless supply of
money and we can only hire up to a certain number of
people."
He also disagreed with the union's claim that the
quality of patient care would go down if the nursing as
sistants were replaced with registered nurses.
"Patients will be receiving better care from the reg
istered nurses than from the nursing assistants who
haven't received formal training," he said.
If Stanford Hospital is found to not be in compliance
with state and federal minimum standards of operation,
it would be required to submit a "plan of correction."

The plan would state the changes the hospital would
make in order to comply with the law. There would be
no monetary fine.
The California Department of Health Services said
that it is investigating the complaint by the union on
the hospital's current situation, not a violation of AB
394.
"We don't need the law to go into effect in order to
go in and examine the hospital," said Lea Brooks,
spokesperson for the California Department of Health
Services. "We are taking a look at the current adequa
cy of the nurse-to-patient ratio, seeing if the nurses can
meet the demands of the patients.
"Our office get complaints from a wide range of
sources, from families of patients to labor unions, and
we take each of these complaints seriously," she
added.
Brooks said that the process of evaluating Stanford
Hospital would take several weeks.

Stanford Hospital workers protested last month in response to the layoff of over 100 nursing assistants. The Hospital
is now being investigated by the state to determine if its nursing staff levels are adequate.
