# Water polo takes two
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a weekend plagued by lack of officiating, the
No. 4 Stanford men's water polo team added two
more notches to its tally with a non-league victory
over No. 15 Davis on Sunday and a league win over
No. 9 Santa Barbara on Saturday. The Cardinal are
11-3 overall for the season and 1-1 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation.
In a Saturday snafu, the officials for the league
match against Santa Barbara mistakenly thought the
game was being held down south. After waiting for
45 minutes, Stanford was able to contact local refer
ees to officiate the game. Sunday seemed similarly
jinxed with pre-game clock problems and another
missing official, who showed up 15 minutes late.
The Cardinal was coming off of a difficult 9-7 loss
to Southern California last weekend.
Senior utility Mike Derse felt the team was well
prepared for this weekend's games.
"We had a good week of practice last week," he
said. "It showed this weekend that we were able to
come out and have two good games and win."
Once underway, however, both games turned out
well.
Stanford came out strong in Saturday's 10-7 vic
tory over Santa Barbara, leading 10-3 by the end of

the third period.
Junior driver Tony Azevedo scored a total of six
goals two goals in each of the first, second and
third periods and sophomore Chad Taylor tallied
seven saves at goal for Stanford. The Gauchos did
make a fourth period run of four straight goals, but
it was not enough to give them the win.
Sunday's game began with a lackluster first peri
od against the Aggies. Despite several attempts
against the Aggies' goalie, including a fastbreak by
Azevedo that failed to garner a goal, Davis held
Stanford to a single goal by junior two-meter Greg
Crum at 4:27.
The Aggies quickly crumbled however, with sev
eral members of the Cardinal crew going on to score
and every man on the bench seeing time in the pool.
Azevedo scored four goals for a season total of
45. Senior utility Mike Derse completed a hat trick.
Crum added another goal with a wrap-around shot
in the third period. Junior field Trent Wiesen and
sophomore driver Thomas Hopkins each added a
point for Stanford.
The Cardinal led the Aggies 8-1 after three peri
ods.
The huge Stanford lead allowed valuable time in
the pool for several less experienced Cardinal players.

Junior driver Tony Azevedo upped his season total to 45 goals in victories over No. 15 UC-Davis and No. 9 Santa Barbara this weekend at the Avery Aquatic Center.
The Cardinal defeated the Gauchos 10-7 on Saturday before handling the Aggies easily on Sunday, 13-3.
The freshmen came out in force
for the fourth period. JJ Garton
and redshirt freshman Marcello
Pantuliano each scored for the
Cardinal.
Freshman goalie Beau Stock
still added two saves to his record,
and said after the game that even
30 seconds in the pool teaches him
more about the game.
"Every time I go out there, no
matter what happens, it's always a
learning experience. Whether it's
learning passing in a 30 meter pool,
or shooters or positioning," he
said.
Stanford shut down Davis with
a final score of 13-3.
This weekend's matches were a
fun affair for the Cardinal, a wel

come respite and a chance to re
coup for harder games ahead.
"These games are always kind
of nice because they give us a little
bit of down time," Wiesen said.
"It's good to remind us that we
have to come out for every game
and we can't take anything for
granted."
"Two teams coming here with a
home crowd, beating them, every
one's having a good time . . . It's
great." Stockstill said. "We can
work on our game."
The real contest, however, was
not this past weekend, but will
come in two weeks when the Car
dinal faces No. 5 UCLA and No. 3
Pepperdine here at Stanford.
"That's probably going to be
the deciding point of our season,"
Derse said.
The players are optimistic
about their performance midsea
son.
"I think we're right where we

want to be," Derse said. "It'll serve
to help us in the long run because
we can learn from out mistakes."
Stockstill thinks the team is
coming together well this season.
"We're definitely showing, like
in our game against Pepperdine,
that when we come together we
have enormous power, and anyone
who gets in the way is going to get
trampled," he said. "We've got a
great team. We've got a lot of fire
power, great defense, great goalie,
so I think we're doing really well."
The Cardinal's best is yet to
come, claims Wiesen.
"Midseason, I feel like we've
got a lot of work to do, which is a
good thing because the team that
ends up winning is the team that's
peaking at the end. We're certain
ly not peaking now so there's a lot
of work we can do."
The Cardinal men's next league
contest will be at home this Friday
at 5 p.m. against San Diego.
