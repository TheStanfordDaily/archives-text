# Water polo takes two
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a weekend plagued by lack of officiating, the
No. 4 Stanford men's water polo team added two
more notches to its tally with a non-league victory
over No. 15 Davis on Sunday and a league win over
No. 9 Santa Barbara on Saturday. The Cardinal are
11-3 overall for the season and 1-1 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation.
In a Saturday snafu, the officials for the league
match against Santa Barbara mistakenly thought the
game was being held down south. After waiting for
45 minutes, Stanford was able to contact local refer
ees to officiate the game. Sunday seemed similarly
jinxed with pre-game clock problems and another
missing official, who showed up 15 minutes late.
The Cardinal was coming off of a difficult 9-7 loss
to Southern California last weekend.
Senior utility Mike Derse felt the team was well
prepared for this weekend's games.
"We had a good week of practice last week," he
said. "It showed this weekend that we were able to
come out and have two good games and win."
Once underway, however, both games turned out
well.
Stanford came out strong in Saturday's 10-7 vic
tory over Santa Barbara, leading 10-3 by the end of

the third period.
Junior driver Tony Azevedo scored a total of six
goals two goals in each of the first, second and
third periods and sophomore Chad Taylor tallied
seven saves at goal for Stanford. The Gauchos did
make a fourth period run of four straight goals, but
it was not enough to give them the win.
Sunday's game began with a lackluster first peri
od against the Aggies. Despite several attempts
against the Aggies' goalie, including a fastbreak by
Azevedo that failed to garner a goal, Davis held
Stanford to a single goal by junior two-meter Greg
Crum at 4:27.
The Aggies quickly crumbled however, with sev
eral members of the Cardinal crew going on to score
and every man on the bench seeing time in the pool.
Azevedo scored four goals for a season total of
45. Senior utility Mike Derse completed a hat trick.
Crum added another goal with a wrap-around shot
in the third period. Junior field Trent Wiesen and
sophomore driver Thomas Hopkins each added a
point for Stanford.
The Cardinal led the Aggies 8-1 after three peri
ods.
The huge Stanford lead allowed valuable time in
the pool for several less experienced Cardinal players.
