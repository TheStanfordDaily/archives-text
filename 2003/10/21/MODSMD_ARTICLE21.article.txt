# TWIN RUNNERS ARE DOUBLE TROUBLE
## 
### SEAN HOWELL 
Identical twins Amanda and Katy Trotter, freshmen
phenoms on the women's cross country team, are not
identical in every way.
"They have really different personalities," says head
coach Dena Evans.
"Katy's more superstitious," Amanda says.
But they do have a lot in common. Both eat peanut
butter before every race, and both wear necklaces for
good luck: Amanda wears a St. Christopher's medallion,
while Katy sports a seashell necklace.
"It helps people to tell us apart," Katy said.
Each of them will also play an integral role this season
in the No. 2 Cardinal's quest for a national championship.
At Saturday's pre-NCAA National meet in Waterloo,
Ind., a race which featured some of the top teams and in-
dividual runners in the country,
Katy finished fourth for Stanford
and Amanda finished sixth, help
ing the team to a first-place finish.
"Athletically, they add a
tremendous boost to our team,"
Evans said. "Both are really good
competitors, and they also have a
positive attitude that is infec
tious."
At the Finish Lynx / Murray
Keatinge Invitational earlier this
month, Amanda, Katy and freshman
Arianna Lambie, who finished fifth
overall at the pre-NCAA race, led a
pack of Stanford runners that swept
the top seven spots. And, since the
race was in Maine, relatively close to
the sisters' New Jersey home, they
were able to do it in front of their
family.
"It was a real treat for our par
ents, and it was a cool feeling to
finish with everyone," Amanda
said.
Finishing a race with other run
ners is a new feeling for the sisters.
They ran almost exclusively to
gether in their lone season on the
Red Bank Regional High School
cross-country team. Amanda and
Katy gave up soccer their senior
year to pursue the sport because
they wanted to prepare for the

track and field season and because
they wanted to avoid injury.
Both quickly became nationally
ranked cross country runners, and
Katy ended the season as the Foot
Locker National Cross Country
runner-up. Suffice to say, their
high school teammates could not
keep up.
"We did everything together,"
Amanda said.
"We ran out of things to talk
about sometimes," Katy added.
Now that they are surrounded
by world-class distance runners,
the twins are rarely left to chat by
themselves in practices. Evans
often splits them up, and they usu
ally run in large groups.
"I've been learning so much by
talking to some of the more expe
rienced runners," Amanda said.
"Sometimes I think I ask too many
questions."
Junior Alicia Craig, who won
the pre-NCAA meet, finishing
slightly ahead of second-place
teammate junior Sara Bei, thinks
that's a good thing.
"They are constantly asking
questions and asking for advice,"
Craig said. "They want to know
everything."
This attitude has helped both of
the women improve. They do not
compete much with each other,
they insist, and they are more fo
cused on helping the team get to
where it needs to be at Nationals.
"We feel like we're running

with each other and with the whole
team, not against each other,"
Amanda said. "We're running
against everybody else in the
country."
Katy, who said that sometimes
in high school she would literally
walk in Amanda's footsteps on the
way to school in hopes that she
would be able to run like her sister,
can now walk in the footsteps of a
number of experienced runners
who are happy to lead the way.
"We can learn so much from
every single person on the team,"
Katy said.
Their eagerness to learn about
the sport bodes well for their fu
tures as long-distance runners, and
for the future of the women's cross
country program.
"They train hard, they pay at
tention to the small things and
they really care about becoming
better runners," Craig said.
Added Evans: "It's hard to say
what they will be able to do in the
future. They have a lot of unex
plored potential. The sky is the
limit for them."
For now, though, they are just
trying to keep moving in the right
direction.
"I don't know what I'd do if I
didn't run," Katy said.
The team, which is counting on
the twins to help bring the nation
al title back to Palo Alto, doesn't
even want to consider that sce
nario.
