# Injuries plague Cardinal in losses
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Entering this weekend's matches with
Fresno State (4-9-0, 1-4-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) and top-ranked UCLA (12-1-0, 5-0-0),
the Cardinal men's soccer team (2-10-2,0-5-0)
hoped to translate its recently improved play
into a victory that would have snapped a three
game losing streak in conference play.
And then the injuries hit.
Stanford sophomore defender Chad Mar
shall and junior forward James Twellman
were forced to the bench during Friday night's
2-0 loss to the Bulldogs, and the pair was
joined by junior forward Matt Janusz and
sophomore midfielder Bronson McDonald in
the Cardinal's 3-0 loss to the Bruins.
The injuries "forced us to use a lot of fresh
man players," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon. "And they just got a little over
matched."
Even so, the game at Fresno State re
mained scoreless until the second half, when
the Cardinal's luck really took a turn for the
worse.
As if needing to remove Marshall and
Twellman from the game wasn't enough bad
luck for Stanford, Fresno State managed to
score two controversial goals to shut out the
Cardinal and halt a three-game losing skid.
The Bulldogs scored their first goal when
senior Jeremiah Leßoy converted a penalty
kick to give Fresno State the lead at 61:04.
"It really wasn't a clear penalty," said Stan
ford senior midfielder Mike Wilson. "It was
just a tag on the shirt. The guy didn't fall down
or anything."
Fresno State's insurance goal occurred 10
minutes later off a 20-yard free kick by senior
midfielder Ernie Vega.
Stanford junior goalkeeper Robby Fulton,
who recorded four saves on the night, seemed
to have made the stop, but the officials ruled

Vega's shot a goal, saying that Fulton was
standing inside the goal line.
"The goals were kind of luck," Wilson said.
"But we probably just shouldn't have let [the
Bulldogs] get that kind of positioning. We
gave them a chance to get ahead and they pun
ished us for it."
The Cardinal fared no better on Sunday, in
a rematch of last season's NCAA Champi
onship game with top-ranked UCLA.
The matchup with Fresno State prompted a
young Cardinal lineup to face off against the
Bruins' regular starters, seven of whom are se
niors.
"On one end of it, we did have to play with
a shuffled lineup," Wilson said. "But on the
other end it gave a lot of guys a chance to
play."
The game marked the comeback of Janusz,
Stanford's active career leader in goals, assists
and points, who had been out with a muscle
pull for three weeks. The hope was that Janusz
would be able to spark a scoring surge on the
Cardinal offense, which has found the back of
the net only 10 times this year.
But the star forwards' injury proved more
persistent than originally believed; Janusz was
sidelined again after 25 minutes of play.
McDonald was also injured in the first peri
od, with a hit to the rib. The coaching staff was
concerned that the injury may have aggravat
ed McDonald's lung, which was punctured a
year ago, so the midfielder did not return to
the game.
Meanwhile, the veteran advantage lifted
UCLA to a lead early in the match, as senior
Matt Taylor netted his 13th goal of the season
off of a cross from senior Adolfo Gregorio in
the 11th minute of the game.
Less than three minutes later, the senior
duo connected again, this time with Gregorio
putting the shot past Fulton.

Junior forward James Twellman was one of many Stanford men's soccer players
sidelined with an injury in losses to Fresno State and top-ranked UCLA last week
end. The Cardinal is still looking for its first Pac-10 victory.
Bruins sophomore Jordan Har
vey snuck in the final UCLA goal
just before the break and both teams
were scoreless for the second period.
By the end, UCLA had 23 at
tempts, which resulted in 11 saves for
Fulton.

Stanford managed only five shots,
none of which occurred in the second
half. Senior defender Abe Geiger
took the Cardinal's only shot on
goal.
"We had some young guys in
there, but it was still just two teams
battling hard," Simon said. "We
have to get some people healthy for
next week."
Simon added that Marshall and
Twellman will hopefully be ready for

Friday's game, which is a rematch
with the Bruins.
This week "is a great opportunity
for us to get prepared for Friday,"
Wilson said. "We can find ways to
flip things around on [UCLA]."
Stanford will return home to face
the Bruins again at 7 p.m. on Friday
and then will meet Fresno State Sun
day at 1 p.m. Both games will kick off
at Maloney Field.

The Cardinal fared no better on Sunday, in
a rematch of last season's NCAA Champi
onship game with top-ranked UCLA.
The matchup with Fresno State prompted a
young Cardinal lineup to face off against the
Bruins' regular starters, seven of whom are se
niors.
"On one end of it, we did have to play with
a shuffled lineup," Wilson said. "But on the
other end it gave a lot of guys a chance to
play."
The game marked the comeback of Janusz,
Stanford's active career leader in goals, assists
and points, who had been out with a muscle
pull for three weeks. The hope was that Janusz
would be able to spark a scoring surge on the
Cardinal offense, which has found the back of
the net only 10 times this year.
But the star forwards' injury proved more
persistent than originally believed; Janusz was
sidelined again after 25 minutes of play.
McDonald was also injured in the first peri
od, with a hit to the rib. The coaching staff was
concerned that the injury may have aggravat
ed McDonald's lung, which was punctured a
year ago, so the midfielder did not return to
the game.
Meanwhile, the veteran advantage lifted
UCLA to a lead early in the match, as senior
Matt Taylor netted his 13th goal of the season
off of a cross from senior Adolfo Gregorio in
the 11th minute of the game.
Less than three minutes later, the senior
duo connected again, this time with Gregorio
putting the shot past Fulton.

Junior forward James Twellman was one of many Stanford men's soccer players
sidelined with an injury in losses to Fresno State and top-ranked UCLA last week
end. The Cardinal is still looking for its first Pac-10 victory.
Bruins sophomore Jordan Har
vey snuck in the final UCLA goal
just before the break and both teams
were scoreless for the second period.
By the end, UCLA had 23 at
tempts, which resulted in 11 saves for
Fulton.

Stanford managed only five shots,
none of which occurred in the second
half. Senior defender Abe Geiger
took the Cardinal's only shot on
goal.
"We had some young guys in
there, but it was still just two teams
battling hard," Simon said. "We
have to get some people healthy for
next week."
Simon added that Marshall and
Twellman will hopefully be ready for

Friday's game, which is a rematch
with the Bruins.
This week "is a great opportunity
for us to get prepared for Friday,"
Wilson said. "We can find ways to
flip things around on [UCLA]."
Stanford will return home to face
the Bruins again at 7 p.m. on Friday
and then will meet Fresno State Sun
day at 1 p.m. Both games will kick off
at Maloney Field.
