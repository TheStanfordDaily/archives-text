## Prescription drug abuse common 
### JULIA LIFSCHULTZ TUFTS DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MEDFORD, Mass.
Rush Limbaugh's recent admission of an
addiction to prescription drugs is only one
of many examples in which celebrities
have abused drugs that were initially
meant to help them. This epidemic is not
unique to the famous, however: it has ex
isted at Tufts University, as well as many
other college campuses, for quite some
time.
Ritalin and Adderall are two of the
most commonly abused prescription
drugs on campus. Initially developed to
treat attention deficit disorder, these
"study drugs" have become an inexpen
sive way for students without attention
problems to focus before a big test, or to
get a high close to that of cocaine at a frac
tion of the price. By "bumping," or snort
ing, these pills, users can often reach a
modest level of euphoria without the fear
attached to more illicit drugs.
"I've used study drugs before for fi
nals, but it isn't something that I do often
at all," said Frank, a Tufts student who
wished to remain anonymous. "I'll use
some prescription painkillers maybe once
a semester, but it is not something I ac
tively seek to do."
"I would say 'study drugs' like Ritalin
and Adderall are used fairly frequently,
especially around finals time," Frank said.
"Muscle relaxants and pain killer use, I
think, is much less prevalent than study
drugs."
These pills do not always come cheap.
"Adderall and Ritalin go from $2 to
$5," Frank said. "Percocets and Vicodin
are like $3 to $5 each depending upon
how big the pill is. Oxys [Oxycontin pills]
I would say are about $10."
Obtaining the pills is not difficult. One
junior who has an attention problem has
been prescribed Ritalin for two years. "If
a friend needs it, 4'll give it to them," she
said. "If they think it helps them, I feel
like at this point so many people are pre
scribed it who shouldn't be."
The student believes that the problem
partially stems from the distribution of
prescriptions to students.
"When I was prescribed it, I went in

and they said, 'Here's a trial amount; tell
me what the effect is,' " she recalled.
As a result, she said it was easy to get
pills frequently and use half of them while
selling or giving away the rest.
Frank's reasons for using "study
drugs" are not unique. "I used them to
stay up and cram for exams when I was
nervous about them," he said. "The other
pills were just purely for recreational
use."
Dr. Margaret Higham, medical direc
tor of Health Services, is not surprised.
"I absolutely know that students abuse
[them], both to study for tests and it's
like being high," Higham said. "People
like that it speeds you up. For some peo
ple, it speeds up their energy and makes
them feel manic."
That manic energy could sound ap
pealing to some, but it is dangerous.
"[These drugs] override the body's
sense of tiredness," Higham said. "People
can go all night and all next day," and can
ultimately lose out on several nights'
sleep.
According to Higham, one of the side
effects of abusing study drugs is a stimu
lated metabolism, which overworks the
heart and increases blood pressure.
"It could precipitate a heart attack,"
Higham said.
In addition, the intended high can in
duce the opposite effect on some people.
"[These individuals] actually feel pretty
bad: moody, depressed, crying, anxious,
stomachache, can't concentrate," Higham
said.
One Tulane University student who
wished to remain anonymous explained
how she took Adderall before a final she
was worried about finishing on time, and
did poorly as a result of the drug.
"We didn't start the test right away and
during the period that we were waiting for
the teacher to arrive, I became really jit
tery and couldn't concentrate at all once
we started the test," she said. "I messed
up problems that I'd seen before and
ended up doing poorly on the test as a re
sult."
When combined with other pills, Rital
in and Adderall become even more dan
gerous. Almost a year ago, a student at
Boston University who had been taking a

diet pill took Adderall to study for a test
the next day. The two pills combined to
overwhelm her heart, and, while sleeping,
she entered a coma from which she has yet
to wake.
Her friend, BU junior Lauren Buch
man, is still dealing with the grief that has
come from her friend's collapse and sub
sequent vegetative state.
"I didn't even know that she was taking
either of the pills," Buchman said. "By the
time the paramedics came she had lost so
much oxygen that, even if she does ever
wake up, she'll suffer from severe brain
damage."
It makes sense that this combination
would result in a negative outcome, High
am said.
"Any of the medications that are also
in the stimulant category can combine to
make the side effects that much worse,"
she said.
Tufts seeks to help students deal with
this issue, which is far more difficult to
crack down on than illegal drug use.
Liz Moore, the university's substance
abuse specialist, says that Health Services
has appointed a new Director of Drug and
Alcohol Education Services, Margot
Abels. Abels' appointment means that
there are more hours and people to do re
search on such abuse, which could help
the school with its understanding.
At the same time, Moore is aware of
the reasons students abuse these drugs.
"It's hard in college," Moore said.
"People feel a lot of pressure."
But Frank is skeptical of the universi
ty's efforts.
"I don't think the school can do any
thing to stop the usage because those peo
ple who seek drugs to study are going to
do so for its perceived advantages any
way," he said.
Some students reject the trend because
it simply has no appeal to them.
"People end up abusing [study drugs]
and taking them to stop their procrastina
tion," junior Alicia Faneuil said. "Instead,
they need to work on their studying skills,
like not sitting next to friends in the li
brary, not listening to music when study
ing, starting their work earlier than the
day things are due. It's a culmination of
many work and study habits."

way," he said.
Some students reject the trend because
it simply has no appeal to them.
"People end up abusing [study drugs]
and taking them to stop their procrastina
tion," junior Alicia Faneuil said. "Instead,
they need to work on their studying skills,
like not sitting next to friends in the li
brary, not listening to music when study
ing, starting their work earlier than the
day things are due. It's a culmination of
many work and study habits."

Rush Limbaugh's recent admission of an
addiction to prescription drugs is only one
of many examples in which celebrities
have abused drugs that were initially
meant to help them. This epidemic is not
unique to the famous, however: it has ex
isted at Tufts University, as well as many
other college campuses, for quite some
time.
Ritalin and Adderall are two of the
most commonly abused prescription
drugs on campus. Initially developed to
treat attention deficit disorder, these
"study drugs" have become an inexpen
sive way for students without attention
problems to focus before a big test, or to
get a high close to that of cocaine at a frac
tion of the price. By "bumping," or snort
ing, these pills, users can often reach a
modest level of euphoria without the fear
attached to more illicit drugs.
"I've used study drugs before for fi
nals, but it isn't something that I do often
at all," said Frank, a Tufts student who
wished to remain anonymous. "I'll use
some prescription painkillers maybe once
a semester, but it is not something I ac
tively seek to do."
"I would say 'study drugs' like Ritalin
and Adderall are used fairly frequently,
especially around finals time," Frank said.
"Muscle relaxants and pain killer use, I
think, is much less prevalent than study
drugs."
These pills do not always come cheap.
"Adderall and Ritalin go from $2 to
$5," Frank said. "Percocets and Vicodin
are like $3 to $5 each depending upon
how big the pill is. Oxys [Oxycontin pills]
I would say are about $10."
Obtaining the pills is not difficult. One
junior who has an attention problem has
been prescribed Ritalin for two years. "If
a friend needs it, 4'll give it to them," she
said. "If they think it helps them, I feel
like at this point so many people are pre
scribed it who shouldn't be."
The student believes that the problem
partially stems from the distribution of
prescriptions to students.
"When I was prescribed it, I went in

and they said, 'Here's a trial amount; tell
me what the effect is,' " she recalled.
As a result, she said it was easy to get
pills frequently and use half of them while
selling or giving away the rest.
Frank's reasons for using "study
drugs" are not unique. "I used them to
stay up and cram for exams when I was
nervous about them," he said. "The other
pills were just purely for recreational
use."
Dr. Margaret Higham, medical direc
tor of Health Services, is not surprised.
"I absolutely know that students abuse
[them], both to study for tests and it's
like being high," Higham said. "People
like that it speeds you up. For some peo
ple, it speeds up their energy and makes
them feel manic."
That manic energy could sound ap
pealing to some, but it is dangerous.
"[These drugs] override the body's
sense of tiredness," Higham said. "People
can go all night and all next day," and can
ultimately lose out on several nights'
sleep.
According to Higham, one of the side
effects of abusing study drugs is a stimu
lated metabolism, which overworks the
heart and increases blood pressure.
"It could precipitate a heart attack,"
Higham said.
In addition, the intended high can in
duce the opposite effect on some people.
"[These individuals] actually feel pretty
bad: moody, depressed, crying, anxious,
stomachache, can't concentrate," Higham
said.
One Tulane University student who
wished to remain anonymous explained
how she took Adderall before a final she
was worried about finishing on time, and
did poorly as a result of the drug.
"We didn't start the test right away and
during the period that we were waiting for
the teacher to arrive, I became really jit
tery and couldn't concentrate at all once
we started the test," she said. "I messed
up problems that I'd seen before and
ended up doing poorly on the test as a re
sult."
When combined with other pills, Rital
in and Adderall become even more dan
gerous. Almost a year ago, a student at
Boston University who had been taking a

diet pill took Adderall to study for a test
the next day. The two pills combined to
overwhelm her heart, and, while sleeping,
she entered a coma from which she has yet
to wake.
Her friend, BU junior Lauren Buch
man, is still dealing with the grief that has
come from her friend's collapse and sub
sequent vegetative state.
"I didn't even know that she was taking
either of the pills," Buchman said. "By the
time the paramedics came she had lost so
much oxygen that, even if she does ever
wake up, she'll suffer from severe brain
damage."
It makes sense that this combination
would result in a negative outcome, High
am said.
"Any of the medications that are also
in the stimulant category can combine to
make the side effects that much worse,"
she said.
Tufts seeks to help students deal with
this issue, which is far more difficult to
crack down on than illegal drug use.
Liz Moore, the university's substance
abuse specialist, says that Health Services
has appointed a new Director of Drug and
Alcohol Education Services, Margot
Abels. Abels' appointment means that
there are more hours and people to do re
search on such abuse, which could help
the school with its understanding.
At the same time, Moore is aware of
the reasons students abuse these drugs.
"It's hard in college," Moore said.
"People feel a lot of pressure."
But Frank is skeptical of the universi
ty's efforts.
"I don't think the school can do any
thing to stop the usage because those peo
ple who seek drugs to study are going to
do so for its perceived advantages any
way," he said.
Some students reject the trend because
it simply has no appeal to them.
