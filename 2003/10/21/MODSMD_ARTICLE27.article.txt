# Cal State schools to admit fewer students

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES Three
schools in the California State University sys
tem are the first to have enrollment adverse
ly affected by state budget cuts, and some of
ficials believe this is just the beginning of a
much larger trend.
Most CSU schools accept students who
turn in applications after the posted deadline,
with the exception of five "impacted" cam
puses that have a strict applications cut-off
date of Nov. 30.
The impacted campuses are forced to ad
here to such a rigid deadline because there
are more qualified students applying to
CSUs than there is space to accommodate
them.
Recent budget cuts, however, have forced
three additional CSU schools California
State Polytechnic Institute-Pomona, CSU-
Fullerton and CSU-San Marcos to join
the fist of impacted campuses, bringing the
total number of impacted schools to eight.
Students who want to go to these campus
es are being advised to apply before the dead
fine of Nov. 30, since no further applications
will be accepted after that date, even if a stu
dent qualifies for admission.
Clara Potes-Fellow, a spokeswoman for
CSU, said the tightened deadline is a neces
sary step.
"We cannot accommodate more students,
since we do not have sufficient funding, and
so [we are forced] to implement more strict
cut-off dates at this point," she said.
She added that even though the CSU sys
tem is the first to be seriously affected by the
budget crisis, the University of California
and even community colleges will probably
follow.
"We [at CSU] admit more students and
have more students applying, and so we are
obviously getting hit first... But there will
be a domino effect, with UCs being affected
as well," Potes-Fellow said.
Furthermore, Potes-Fellow said, it is pos

sible there will be many students unable to
apply to the CSU, UC or community college
systems due to lack of space and resources.
This could lead some students to attend
private universities, and leave those who are
unable to pay for private schools without any
means of pursuing higher education.
"It could happen," Potes-Fellow said.
"There will be many students with no place to
go-"
Currently, the UC regents are considering
curbing enrollment growth as part of a pack
age of ways to deal with over $4lO million in
budget cuts last year.
However, they are waiting for the new
budget to come out in January before making
a final decision.
Hanan Eisenman, spokesman for the UC
Office of the President, said the regents are
currently being presented with many possi
ble options, including program cuts, research
cuts or enrollment restrictions, but before
January they cannot make a decision.
The CSU system faces a $304 million bud
get cut this year and a freeze on enrollment
growth for next year, which means many
CSU campuses cannot expand enough to ac
commodate the projected increase in their
number of students.
Paula Selleck, spokeswoman for CSU-
Fullerton, said the school has had to limit en
rollment in order to benefit those students al
ready enrolled.
"We do not want to take in any more stu
dents than we can serve," she said. "Our pri
ority is preserving academic integrity for stu
dents already here.
"The state budget crisis created a signifi
cant challenge for us," Selleck continued.
"Seats in classes are becoming more and
more precious."
She also said Fullerton had record enroll
ment numbers this year, consistent with an
increasing enrollment trend the school has
been experiencing for many years.
However, the university is unable to ex
pand fast enough to meet the demand since it
is short on funding.
