# Panel discusses future of U.S.-Muslim relations
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER 
Last night, a town hall gathering called
"Hope Not Hate" brought together four
speakers to discuss various aspects of the rela
tionship between the United States and the
Muslim world. The panelists encouraged dis
course between Muslims and Americans to in
crease understanding, especially in light of the
events of Sept. 11,2001 and the war in Iraq.
The event featured: Syed Muazzem Ali, for
mer foreign secretary of the People's Republic
of Bangladesh; Banafsheh Akhlaghi, a lawyer
who specializes in immigrant rights; Azmat

Abbas, a 2004 International Knight Fellow;
and Donald Emmerson, the director of the
Southeast Asia Forum and senior fellow of the
Institute for International Studies. It was orga
nized by a variety of political and international
student groups, including the Muslim Student
Awareness Network and Stanford Interna
tional Affairs Society.
Ali opened the event by describing the sta
tus of Muslim populations around the world.
He said that there are 57 Muslim majority
countries spreading across three continents,
many of which have been subjugated for cen-
turies under colonial rule and are
now facing prejudice due to alleged
terrorist ties.
After Sept. 11, 2001, "the Mus
lims felt like they were branded as
terrorists," Ali said. "The Taliban
regime was not connected with
Islam. Only three Muslim countries
were connected with the Taliban,
and two of those rejected it after
they took over Afghanistan."
Despite this, Ali said, "Even
countries that were tolerant and
moderate were seen as fundamen
talist."
He stressed the importance of
changing this outlook.
"History has proven time and
again that cooperation and not con
frontation has always been the most
effective method," he said.
He added that students play a
very important rule in opening up
channels for discourse.
Next, Emmerson described the
large presence of the Indonesian
population in the Muslim world,
mentioning that Indonesia has more
Muslims than any other country.
He highlighted the fact that 64
percent of Indonesian Muslims op
pose the war on terrorism and that,
after its onset, the popularity ratings
of the United States in Indonesia
declined from 51 percent in 2002 to
15 percent this June.
Despite American unpopularity,

in 2004 Indonesia will hold its first
directly democratic presidential
election, though feelings are mixed
among Indonesians about this
"Western-style" election.
"Only 41 percent of Indonesians
believe that American-style democ
racy will work in Indonesia," Em
merson said.
Emmerson believes that
strengthening education and judi
cial institutions in Indonesia is the
key to aiding the Muslim communi
ty.
After Emmerson, Akhlaghi
spoke of civil-rights issues on the
domestic front.
"The basis of this country has
been lost since Sept. 11," she said.
"The people of this country have
gone, with all due respect, mad."
Akhlaghi cited the Patriot Act as
an example.
"The Patriot Act says that if a
federal agent or a local agent wants
to question you, you must avail
yourself to those inquiries," she
said. "If you do not, they can detain
you. We have men in this country
who have been held for 20 months
under the Patriot Act guidelines
without charges to a crime."
She added that these men, most
ly Muslim and Middle Eastern, are
held in 24-hour lockdown without
the right to counsel or time to say
their daily prayers.

In addition, Akhlaghi said, men
from targeted countries, even high
school students and senior citizens,
were detained throughout last year
solely due to their racial back
ground.
Abbas ended the night by ex
plaining the ambivalence among
Pakistanis about collaborating with

the United States.
Although the governments of
the United States and Pakistan are
partners in the war on terror, "We
see no association between the peo
ple," Abbas said.
After the bombing in
Afghanistan, the United States lost
its credibility in the eyes of the Pak

istanis, he said.
In order to mend the shaky rela
tionship between the people of the
two countries, Abbas said, "We re
ally have to sit together and sort out
things. We have to acknowledge our
faults and then come out with a set
of solutions to prevent further dam
age."
