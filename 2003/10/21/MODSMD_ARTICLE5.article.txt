# Fundraising numbers up

### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford reached the second-highest fundraising level in the
University's history last year, raising a total of $486 million from
contributions and bringing the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education closer to its $1 billion goal.
The fundraising produced an increase of nearly 7 percent in
total donations from the previous year.
That increase is significant because the University relies on
annual gifts for a large part of its operating budget. Also, dona
tions build Stanford's endowment, which adds stability to acad
emic and financial aid programs, said Isaac Stein, chair of the
Board of Trustees.
In recent years, Stanford has experienced financial setbacks,
including budget cuts, a salary freeze and a two-year period of
negative returns on its endowment. John Ford, vice president of
development, said last year's donations will give Stanford more
financial flexibility. Stein said that the University has always
been financially strong despite the economic downturn in re
cent years.
Of the $486 million raised, $l9O million will go to the Uni
versity's endowment. About $43 million has been allocated to
new buildings, such as the Clark Center, the new home of the
Bio-X program. The rest of the funds will be used to provide

general support in all areas of the University, such as under
graduate education. ,
The Campaign for Undergraduate Education, which seeks
to raise $1 billion for undergraduate programs such as Sopho
more College, Freshman and Sophomore Seminars and Over
seas Programs by the end of 2005, generated over $lOO million
in pledges and gifts last year. The campaign, now in its fourth
year, has already brought in about $BB9 million.
This year, alumni were notified that employees were experi
encing salary freezes across the University. But officials dis
missed the suggestion that some donors may have been more
generous in light of the University's current financial strains due
to the slow economy, saying it played a minimal role.
Ford attributed the fundraising success to the hard work of
the University's development team and the long-term relation
ships established with alumni.
"Stanford's been at this for 50 years," he said. "A lot of the
goodwill, a lot of the generosity, has built up over these 50
years."
Of the $486 million donated last year, $56 million came from
people who had named Stanford in their wills, marking the sec
ond highest amount in bequest totals in the University's history.
"Stanford alums are extremely loyal," said Margot Pearson,
