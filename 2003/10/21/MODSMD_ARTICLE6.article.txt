# Registrar enacts study list petition fee
## 
### JOAQUÍN HERNÁNDEZ 
Students who submit a petition to ad
just their study lists are now being
charged $5O, an attempt by the Regis
trar's Office to convince students to final
ize their study lists by the deadline.
The charge will be applied to students
who want to add or drop a class (rather
than withdraw) or change the grading
basis after the official deadlines.
The office has had difficulty process
ing the large amount of add and drop pe
titions. Last year it surveyed nearly 2,000
petitions, University Registrar Roger
Printup said.
"This is not an insignificant amount of
work," Printup said. "If every student fol
lowed deadlines, it would save us a lot of
time and them money."

This year, the Registrar's Office hired
new staff members to help with the pro
cessing of petitions. At the same time, it
has also experienced budget cuts. The
money generated by the late fees will
cover administrative expenses; after that,
if any is left over, it will go into Stanford's
general fund.
The petition process requires an ini
tial evaluation of each petition in which
members of the Registrar's Office de
cide whether it warrants an exception to
the deadline rule. Furthermore, if a peti
tion is accepted, the necessary changes
are manually entered into the office's
system.
If a mistake in a study list is somehow the
result of a glitch on Axess, the student will
not be required to pay the fee or send a pe
tition, Printup said.

Some Stanford students said they are
not surprised by the service charge.
"The deadlines make sense, and the
amount of time they give us to shop for
classes is one of the things that makes this
university appealing," said doctoral can
didate William Edwards.
Other students said they felt unaffect
ed by the new policy.
"Nobody really cares about 50 bucks,"
senior Simon Hu said. "As long as a per
son follows policy it won't hurt them.
Even if it does, it is a reasonable charge."
Many students speculate that the policy
was adopted to encourage choosing class
es on time. As a result, many are now more
conscious of the registration timeline.
"From now on, I know I'll be much
more aware of these deadlines," junior
Maris Jones said.
