## Mars not so different from Earth

Geological History of Mars

More and more studies show that Mars is
not just a smaller and colder Earth or a com
pletely alien environment. On the contrary,
the geological history of Mars has been
shaped by many processes, some similar and
others different to what happened on Earth.
For instance, Earth has a molten core and liq
uid water, both of which are lacking in Mars

(although it presumably
had oceans in the past). On
the other hand, Mars is
considerably smaller and
has a thin atmosphere,
thus being prone to much
more drastic changes. Two
ongoing missions, Mars
Global Surveyor and Mars
Odyssey, are studying how
water, ice and wind have
helped shape the Red

Planet in the past billion years. The question
of life on Mars is more confusing. There is ev
idence both for and against it but three up
coming landers may provide the crucial an
swers.
911 and Science
In the aftermath of 9 /11, tighter visa laws
have put a dent in national science activtities.
Officials have been scrutinizing visa applica
tions from foreign students and scientists and
a good number have been unable to return to
the United States. The most hurt field is
physics since it often involves international
collaborations. At Fermi Laboratory, scien
tists from Vietnam, China, India and Russia,
who had once supplied equipment for the de
tectors are unable to arrive and perform their
duties. A dozen scientists missed a Septem
ber 2002 meeting at Brookhaven and several
other researchers were unable to return in
time to their institutions. Students have been
the most critically affected: The number of
students visas in 2002 was 234,322,20 percent
lower than 2001.
Arsenic in New England Wells
Arsenic in private wells in New England is
more widespread than thought according to a
U.S. Geological Survey. Arsenic is a highly
dangerous compound and even small quanti
ties can cause cancer. In the current study, the
researchers evaluated data on arsenic levels
for 1,600 public and private water sources, fo
cusing on area of high population density.
"We found that elevated arsenic concentra
tions in private wells were much more preva
lent than in public wells, in some cases by two
to four times," said Joseph D. Ayotte, chief
investigator for the study and a hydrologist
with the USGS unit in Pembroke, N.H. For
those drinking from wells, the USGS recom
mends getting the water tested and purchas
ing a filter if necessary.
Hot Bees Dance Better
Bees in the cold are lousy dancers. A
study reported in the Proceedings of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences found that
young bees raised in a cooler environment
than they are used to cannot dance as well as
counterparts raised normally. In adults,
dancing is crucial because that is how they
communicate to each other the location of
food sources. The researchers raised three
broods, at 32°°C, 34°°C and 36°°C at the
pupal stages. When these bees became
adult, the "colder" bees had sloppier varia
tions and less turns than the "hotter" bees.
Since there were no other physical or sur
vival differences the scientists suspect tem
perature plays a role in the cognitive abili
ties of bees.
Light from carbon Nanotubes
IBM researchers have obtained light from
a carbon nanotube by passing a current
through it. The researchers used single (no
complex stacking) nanotubes measuring 1.4
nanometers in diameter (a thousandth of a
hair's width). The key was to bias the nan
otube so that one portion would conduct elec
trons while the other would conduct holes.
When electrons and holes combine they emit
infrared radiation. Previous nanotubes have
emitted light only when excited by another
light source. Obtaining photos through an
electric current is a step forward in producing
optoelectronic application for high-speed
communications.
Regenerating Neurons
The Stanford Medical Center is study
ing a new avenue for treating brain injury.
Jeffrey Goldberg has identified the mecha
nism and some key cells involved in regen
eration of nervous cells. They have also dis
covered that the signals telling the neurons
to stop regenerating do not come from the
neurons themselves. The team believes
that neurons have an internal clock telling
them to stop regenerating. They tested this
theory by isolating embryonic neurons in
lab and observed that the lab-grown could
regenerate faster than those in recently
born rats. "There's a lot of hope right now
that in coming years and decades wefll be
able to offer new treatments to patients,"
Goldberg said.
