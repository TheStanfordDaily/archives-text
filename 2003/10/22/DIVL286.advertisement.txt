Do you ever feel that you are working
overtime to put others at ease? Or that
you have to leave your true self at the
door in order |o placate White colleagues?
Do you downplay your abilities or
strengths for fear of outshining Black
men? Do you speak one way at the office,
another way to your girlfriends? Is it
sometimes a struggle to feel good about
your looks? Are you constantly battling
stereotypes? Based on the African
American Women's Voices Project,
Shifting reveals that a large number of
African American women feel pressure to
compromise their true selves as they navi
gate America's racial and gender bigotry.
Black women "shift." They change the
expectations they have for themselves. Or
they alter their outer appearance. They
modify their speech. They shift 'white' as
they head to work in the morning and
'black' as they come back home each
night. They shift inward, internalizing the
searing pain of the negative stereotypes
that they encounter daily. And sometimes
they shift by fighting back.
With deeply moving interviews, poignant
ly revealed on each page, Shifting is a
much-needed, clear, and comprehensive
portrait of the reality of African American
women's lives today.
