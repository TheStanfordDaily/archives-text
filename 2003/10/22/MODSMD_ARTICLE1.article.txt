Stanford's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans
gender Community Resource Center will recog
nize National Coming Out Day today in a three
part event intended to allow students to express
their sexual orientation and show support for the
LGBT community on campus.
Though it is not common for Stanford students
to officially "come out" for the first time at the cam
pus National Coming Out Day event, the activities
offer the LGBT community on campus an opportu
nity to raise awareness and promote openness.
"National Coming Out Day is also about
spreading awareness of queer issues and con
fronting societal stigmas and stereotypes placed
upon the LGBT community," said sophomore
Linda Tran, an LGBT-CRC staff member. "It's
about visibility and consciousness-raising. It's also
just a day of celebration, when both lesbian, gay, bi
sexual and transgender people and straight allies
show their solidarity."
Tran is concerned about acceptance in the
Stanford community, and while she is unsure of
developments in recent years, she said she "would
like to think the campus has progressed in terms of
openness."
"There's stilTmore work to be done," she said.
Junior Hunter Hargraves believes that Stanford
is "pretty open and accepting" compared to other
institutions, but he agrees that continuing to
strengthen tolerance is crucial for any university.
"Openness is critical to any campus because it
gives an impression," he said. "Whether you're
considering Stanford and visiting its campus to
judge whether or not you'd be a good fit here, or
whether you're a questioning student wondering
how to come out to your roommate, or whether
you're an out member of the community, openness
proves to your peers that you can be comfortable
with who you are."
Some students, like senior Ankur Dalai, have
found that Stanford has done a good job in achiev
ing a safe and supportive campus for LGBT stu
dents. Dalai believes that Stanford reaches its in
coming students early with programs that foster
tolerance.
"Stanford has a commitment to diversity and the
educational opportunities that commitment pro
vides," Dalai said. "From the beginning, the LGBT
CRC and other Stanford departments work to
showcase the variety of queer perspectives that
exist here. From queer issues discussed at Faces of
the Community to queer events early in the year,
presence is established and supported."
Today's activities include a gathering at White
Plaza from noon to 1 p.m., an afternoon barbeque
at Gibbons Grove and an evening mixer at the
LGBT-CRC.
Stanford's National Coming Out Day falls more
than a week after the official National Coming Out
Day, which was on Oct. 11. According to members
of the LGBT-CRC, Stanford delays the event be
cause the quarter system makes it hard to coordi
nate the activities and to get incoming freshmen in
volved.
Tran said she is looking forward to the event
and the rest of the year, because of the enthusiasm
that the incoming freshman class has already
brought to the Stanford community.
"I think there has always been a strong communi
ty in that there's a certain solidarity within the LGBT
community in terms of relationships and support net
works," Tran said. "It strengthens every year, and, es
pecially with this incoming freshmen class, I've seen
nothing but energy and excitement."
