# Resisting the Farm's fransistor
## Stanford students don't have their antennae up for KZSU 
### JASMINE HANIFI 
Listen closely. There are
voices coining from the base
ment of Memorial Auditori
um, voices that can be heard
from San Jose to Oakland.
People might think they're
hearing the warring ghosts of
Jane Leland and David Starr
Jordan, but no the voices
belong to the student hosts of
KZSU, the campus radio sta
tion. Most freshmen haven't a
clue about what KZSU is.
"Is that another one of
those crazy acronyms?"
Marcela Hernandez, fresh
man, asked upon hearing the
station naifte. It seems that the
only frosh able to dish on
KZSU grew up in Palo Alto.
"They play pretty good music
sometimes," remarked Mea
gan Herfkens, freshman, a Bay
Area native. "Then again, I'll
listen to anything."
Why does the vastly-funded
90.1 FM have such a low-pro
file on campus? In 2002, the
KZSU budget was $98,859, ac
cording to a March 2002 article
in The Stanford Review
more than enough, it would
seem, to attract student atten
tion. Few listeners are tuning
in, however. This year KZSU
staff claim that they are work
ing diligently to keep the cam
pus radio station from remain
ing as underground as its phys
ical location. But virtually no
new programs appear to have
been implemented to lure stu
dent interest in 2003.
KZSU General Manager
Chuan-Mei Lee, senior, ac
knowledges that listener num
bers remain low, but she claims
to not know approximate fig
ures of students who patronize
the station.
Maybe audience expansion
is a difficult task on a campus
where people prefer iPods to
Walkmen. KZSU is a non
profit station that can play any
music not in violation of FCC
(Federal Communications

Commission) regulations. It
broadcasts programs on eight different Stanford sports, as well as on campus
news and opinions. Its signal emanates from the Dish, and its chief engineer
has been on hand since 1963. KZSU still offers something for Web addicts,
who may enjoy the station's streaming online broadcast at http://kzsu.stan
ford.edu.
Though the freshmen may overlook them, KZSU staffers say that they try
to represent: This year, KZSU DJs presided at Freshman Orientation events
and Full Moon on the Quad. Every Friday, students can make an appearance
at "KZSU Presents" at the CoHo to listen to a couple of live bands, one uni
versity-affiliated and one from the greater Bay Area. Several upperclassmen
recommend setting your dial to Wednesday Night Live, which showcases
Bay Area bands. Instead of listening to a 50 Cent single on repeat for 20 min
utes which seems to happen all too often on our Clear Channel-dominat
ed campus try KZSU at 9 p.m. on Wednesdays.
KZSU differs from Stanfordites' favorite commercial stations back home.
The station can't air ads yes, a radio station that doesn't advertise Mc-
Donald's Premium Garden Salads does exist! because it's a non-profit
student program. Underwriters sponsor the sports programming; with those
funds and perhaps extravagant quantities of money from the ASSU, KZSU
runs almost perpetually throughout four quarters.
But the ASSU has not been unified in its support of 90.1. Representa
tives declined to comment on the specifics of KZSU's budget for 2003.
Funding for the station seems to be a touchy issue: ASSU appropriations co
chair Lindsay Love failed to return repeated phone calls regarding KZSU's
budget.

Approval of KZSU's re
quest for special fees was cer
tainly not unanimous last
spring. The requested special
fees, comprising a total that
might seem exorbitant to some
students, passed by a 2432-
1153 ASSU vote last year, in
dicating some dissatisfaction
with recent management of
the station. The station has had
other detractors. Based online
as well as on campus, KZSU
has become a target of record
companies. Corporate labels
are attempting to charge the
station for each song played
over its streaming Internet
broadcast. (Here one stumbles
upon yet another reason to
love the RIAA: the companies
allege that FM broadcasts are
easily pirated, leading to the
"illegal" spread of music.) So
far KZSU has avoided paying
up for music rights, but the
struggle with record compa
nies will probably play on far
into the future.
The effect of file-sharing
programs like Kazaa, the
RIAA's mortal enemy, on
KZSU's listener base is unde
termined at the present time.
Lee says that the station has
been largely unaffected by the
advent of wildly popular file
sharing software, because it
doesn't play the mainstream
music that users most fre
quently download. Lee said
that she believes that KZSU's
eclectic programming will en
able it to survive in an era of
digital music.
How could the majority of
freshmen have no idea about
this on-campus media hub?
Well, probably because they
only listen to the radio for the
30 seconds or five minutes
before they groggily shut
off their alarm clocks in the
morning. KZSU staff mem
bers are trying to bring radio
back into their fellow stu
dents' lives. "KZSU is a great
opportunity for Stanford stu
dents to get hands-on experi

ence with broadcast radio,"
Lee stated in e-mail correspondence. "Whether you're interested in any
genre of music (from heavy metal to indie rock to experimental jazz), or
news reporting, or sports broadcast, or behind-the-scenes work, you can do
it all at KZSU."
In spite of KZSU staffers' alleged efforts to magnify the station's on-cam
pus presence, students haven't exactly expressed overwhelming interest in
the station lately. The population of listeners remains low; Lee said that con
ducting a poll of listener numbers and demographics would be prohibitively
expensive. Behind-the-scenes attention is wanting as well; volunteers are
desperately needed. Staff members, who review the one to two hundred CDs
KZSU receives per week from different labels, often receive promotional
concert tickets. KZSU sportscasters accompany Cardinal players to away
games. Teams covered include football, women's volleyball, and women's'
and men's soccer in the fall; women's and men's basketball in the winter, and
baseball and softball in the spring.
For the few in the know, KZSU offers DJ training classes quarterly;
trained students can create their own on-air shows. Those presiding over the
turntables must play eleven to fifteen new songs per three-hour music set.
Provided that they abide by FCC regulations on obscene and indecent con
tent, DJs exercise complete control over their shows. Who wouldn't be en
ticed by the opportunity to express his or her thoughts and musical tastes not
only to Stanford, but to the surrounding communities as well?
So far, apparently most Stanford students. If DJs and administrators are
truly working as hard as they say they are, perhaps this year KZSU will see a
boost in its audience.

students, passed by a 2432-
1153 ASSU vote last year, in
dicating some dissatisfaction
with recent management of
the station. The station has had
other detractors. Based online
as well as on campus, KZSU
has become a target of record
companies. Corporate labels
are attempting to charge the
station for each song played
over its streaming Internet
broadcast. (Here one stumbles
upon yet another reason to
love the RIAA: the companies
allege that FM broadcasts are
easily pirated, leading to the
"illegal" spread of music.) So
far KZSU has avoided paying
up for music rights, but the
struggle with record compa
nies will probably play on far
into the future.
The effect of file-sharing
programs like Kazaa, the
RIAA's mortal enemy, on
KZSU's listener base is unde
termined at the present time.
Lee says that the station has
been largely unaffected by the
advent of wildly popular file
sharing software, because it
doesn't play the mainstream
music that users most fre
quently download. Lee said
that she believes that KZSU's
eclectic programming will en
able it to survive in an era of
digital music.
How could the majority of
freshmen have no idea about
this on-campus media hub?
Well, probably because they
only listen to the radio for the
30 seconds or five minutes
before they groggily shut
off their alarm clocks in the
morning. KZSU staff mem
bers are trying to bring radio
back into their fellow stu
dents' lives. "KZSU is a great
opportunity for Stanford stu
dents to get hands-on experi

ence with broadcast radio,"
Lee stated in e-mail correspondence. "Whether you're interested in any
genre of music (from heavy metal to indie rock to experimental jazz), or
news reporting, or sports broadcast, or behind-the-scenes work, you can do
it all at KZSU."
In spite of KZSU staffers' alleged efforts to magnify the station's on-cam
pus presence, students haven't exactly expressed overwhelming interest in
the station lately. The population of listeners remains low; Lee said that con
ducting a poll of listener numbers and demographics would be prohibitively
expensive. Behind-the-scenes attention is wanting as well; volunteers are
desperately needed. Staff members, who review the one to two hundred CDs
KZSU receives per week from different labels, often receive promotional
concert tickets. KZSU sportscasters accompany Cardinal players to away
games. Teams covered include football, women's volleyball, and women's'
and men's soccer in the fall; women's and men's basketball in the winter, and
baseball and softball in the spring.
For the few in the know, KZSU offers DJ training classes quarterly;
trained students can create their own on-air shows. Those presiding over the
turntables must play eleven to fifteen new songs per three-hour music set.
Provided that they abide by FCC regulations on obscene and indecent con
tent, DJs exercise complete control over their shows. Who wouldn't be en
ticed by the opportunity to express his or her thoughts and musical tastes not
only to Stanford, but to the surrounding communities as well?
So far, apparently most Stanford students. If DJs and administrators are
truly working as hard as they say they are, perhaps this year KZSU will see a
boost in its audience.

Listen closely. There are
voices coining from the base
ment of Memorial Auditori
um, voices that can be heard
from San Jose to Oakland.
People might think they're
hearing the warring ghosts of
Jane Leland and David Starr
Jordan, but no the voices
belong to the student hosts of
KZSU, the campus radio sta
tion. Most freshmen haven't a
clue about what KZSU is.
"Is that another one of
those crazy acronyms?"
Marcela Hernandez, fresh
man, asked upon hearing the
station naifte. It seems that the
only frosh able to dish on
KZSU grew up in Palo Alto.
"They play pretty good music
sometimes," remarked Mea
gan Herfkens, freshman, a Bay
Area native. "Then again, I'll
listen to anything."
Why does the vastly-funded
90.1 FM have such a low-pro
file on campus? In 2002, the
KZSU budget was $98,859, ac
cording to a March 2002 article
in The Stanford Review
more than enough, it would
seem, to attract student atten
tion. Few listeners are tuning
in, however. This year KZSU
staff claim that they are work
ing diligently to keep the cam
pus radio station from remain
ing as underground as its phys
ical location. But virtually no
new programs appear to have
been implemented to lure stu
dent interest in 2003.
KZSU General Manager
Chuan-Mei Lee, senior, ac
knowledges that listener num
bers remain low, but she claims
to not know approximate fig
ures of students who patronize
the station.
Maybe audience expansion
is a difficult task on a campus
where people prefer iPods to
Walkmen. KZSU is a non
profit station that can play any
music not in violation of FCC
(Federal Communications

Commission) regulations. It
broadcasts programs on eight different Stanford sports, as well as on campus
news and opinions. Its signal emanates from the Dish, and its chief engineer
has been on hand since 1963. KZSU still offers something for Web addicts,
who may enjoy the station's streaming online broadcast at http://kzsu.stan
ford.edu.
Though the freshmen may overlook them, KZSU staffers say that they try
to represent: This year, KZSU DJs presided at Freshman Orientation events
and Full Moon on the Quad. Every Friday, students can make an appearance
at "KZSU Presents" at the CoHo to listen to a couple of live bands, one uni
versity-affiliated and one from the greater Bay Area. Several upperclassmen
recommend setting your dial to Wednesday Night Live, which showcases
Bay Area bands. Instead of listening to a 50 Cent single on repeat for 20 min
utes which seems to happen all too often on our Clear Channel-dominat
ed campus try KZSU at 9 p.m. on Wednesdays.
KZSU differs from Stanfordites' favorite commercial stations back home.
The station can't air ads yes, a radio station that doesn't advertise Mc-
Donald's Premium Garden Salads does exist! because it's a non-profit
student program. Underwriters sponsor the sports programming; with those
funds and perhaps extravagant quantities of money from the ASSU, KZSU
runs almost perpetually throughout four quarters.
But the ASSU has not been unified in its support of 90.1. Representa
tives declined to comment on the specifics of KZSU's budget for 2003.
Funding for the station seems to be a touchy issue: ASSU appropriations co
chair Lindsay Love failed to return repeated phone calls regarding KZSU's
budget.

Approval of KZSU's re
quest for special fees was cer
tainly not unanimous last
spring. The requested special
fees, comprising a total that
might seem exorbitant to some
students, passed by a 2432-
