# Answer Boy cleans out the closet

S Today is Stanford's Coming Out Day.
There are a bunch of events aimed at
increasing awareness and openness on
campus, including a barbeque and cafe
session. Why do you think that it's so
hard for so many people to come out of the clos
et?

A Unfortunately, even in today's most
/\ progressive societies, we still see a lot
/ | of intolerance. Fear of someone or
JL _JL something different leads to hate. It's
for this reason that coming out of the closet can
be such a difficult process. Just look, for in
stance, at the armoires in Stern. If wardrobe dis
crimination didn't exist today, we wouldn't see
such inadequate clothing space at Stanford and
it would be much easier to walk into and out of

our closets.
Discrimination against dif
ferent-sized wardrobes has been
a problem at Stanford ever since
the days of Florence Moore,
who, as legend has it, looked in
vain for a spacious enough clos
et to store her fashionable 1950s
poodle skirts. As a result, today
we have Florence Moore hall,
where the willful lady's founding

grant decreed that each room includes wide,
inviting closets. If you're limber enough, you can
even walk into them, and then come out.
Not all dorms on-campus are as lucky. Stern,
as mentioned above, is nefarious for having itsybitsy
bureaus.
In other dorms, such as the recently renovated
680 Lomita, closets have ample space but now

lack doors.
"The closet space is good but I wish there
were closet doors," said sophomore Kate
Horowitz, a 680 resident. "Last year I didn't
have a closet, I had a bureau. It was doable. I like
being able to see my clothes, so I guess this
year's is better."
And, despite the Lilliputian Lagunita rooms,
residents there laud the walk-in closets.
"It's great, it's totally spacious," said senior
Zach Levine. "I'm not that excited about it,
though, because I've had a waik-in closet for
three years in a row." Lucky Levine enjoyed
ample storage space in Xanadu and Bob before
hanging up his clothes in Naranja.
