## Student Affairs must reform 
### 
At the end of spring quarter, the de
cision was made to prohibit alco
hol from common spaces in fresh
man dorms. Last month, "Senior
Pub Night" was renamed "Senior Night."
And sources report that in the past week,
alcohol has been restricted in Toyon, the
University's only all-sophomore dorm.
This is clearly a crackdown on alcohol by
the Office of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs.
We strongly oppose it.
The changes have been sudden and with
little student input. Whether you support
the changes or disagree with them, it must
be acknowledged that the University is
rapidly changing its approach toward alco
hol.
What is more disturbing is that this new
emphasis on alcohol restriction detracts
energy and attention from other initiatives
in student life. Recent changes in the en
forcement of the Alcohol Policy show a
new attitude toward student affairs, where
the visible initiatives of the Office of the
Vice Provost of Student Affairs manifest
themselves through control and punish
ment, as opposed to other more construc
tive ways to better the Stanford communi
ty-
Since last 'year, new pressure has been
put on the ASSU to provide programs for
undergraduates. A $50,000 grant to the
ASSU is a smart move by the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs; the decision can only be
praised, because it eases the financial pres
sures the ASSU faces. However, the grant
cannot be the only initiative to improve
undergraduate life all year. The ASSU
does not have the responsibility to be the
sole provider of campus activities for stu
dents.
The Office of the Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students, created in 2002, must
pick up some of the slack. As a new and ex
pensive initiative, it is time the office
showed some positive results. So far, this
group has taken on activities that other of
fices previously ran New Student Orien

tation, Frosh Formal and Frosh Council.
The only new concepts brought about by
this office have been "Cardinal Fan 101"
and "The Walk" both events that bring
more supporters to football games. This
seems more like promotion for the Athlet
ics Department than an office designed to
cater to the needs of freshmen and transfer
students.
Most importantly, the University must
make more of a commitment to building a
new student union. While we admit that
this is an expensive long-term project, it is
also a necessity. With many houses and
fraternities on or near social probation,
many students have complained that there
is less social activity available. Freshmen
cannot bring cars to Stanford, and their
residential staff cannot absorb the re
sponsibility of providing even more pro
gramming than they already do.
Tresidder must be replaced by a much
better student union. There is no other op
tion. And it is not the job of the ASSU to
fundraise for this project.
This editorial serves as a wake-up call to
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs. We
recommend that the office prioritizes their
efforts of maintaining and improving Stan
ford's unique and nurturing quality of life.
This is part of what makes Stanford so spe
cial. If the campus looses its laid-back, fun
loving, yet socially responsible attitude, it
might also loose potential students to
other institutions. Palm trees alone do not
attract people to Stanford. If alcohol re
strictions must exist for legal reasons, then
so be it. But the Office of the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs must not put all of its
energy into this one effort. It must work to
provide alternatives to drinking. A $50,000
grant is not a ticket to administrative ne
glect toward undergraduate well-being.
University leaders are not and should
not become the campus police. If they
continue on the current policy track, we
might as well change our name to UG Stan
ford.
