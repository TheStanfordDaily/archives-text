# Registrar fee is a good decision
## 
### 
This week, the Registrar's office an
nounced a new change in its policy
regarding the adding and dropping of
classes after the official deadline for
finalizing study lists has passed. As of this
quarter, students submitting a petition to
change their study list will be charged a $5O
administrative fee. Given that Stanford stu
dents are already allowed a generous shop
ping period at the start of every quarter, we
think that the Registrar's new policy is an
appropriate response to the recent increase
in add and drop petitions.
The Registrar's office processed 2,000 pe
titions last year from students wanting to
change their study lists after the deadline,
according to University Registrar Roger
Printup. Dealing with these petitions re
quires costly administrative time: Each peti

tion must be individually evaluated by a staff
member and then, if accepted, manually en
tered into the Registrar's system. This quar
ter, Stanford students had a lengthy 19 days
from the start of the quarter to add classes
and 26 days to drop classes from their study
lists. Changes made after that time period
should be allowed, but at the expense of the
individual.
In a time of mandated budget cuts across
the University, the Registrar's change of
policy is a good example of trimming un
necessary expenses. We take issue with in
creased fees for student services that
should be free, such as printing and Inter
net access. But if students want to change
their study lists three weeks into a nine
week quarter, they shoulda pay the $5O, not
the University.
