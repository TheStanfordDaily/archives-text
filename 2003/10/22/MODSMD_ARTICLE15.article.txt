Stanford Store should stay open
I completely disagree with the
Daily's editorial last week about the
need to close the Stanford Store.
While the store may be a huge fi
nancial liability, it is a valuable
source of employment for Stanford
students, some of whom would un
doubtedly fail to find employment
elsewhere.
Should the store close, what will
happen to the mangy, hungover
Richland Bombers fan who regular
ly mans the register on Sunday
mornings? A disgustingly dirty and
unkempt reminder of the perils of
alcoholism, this student has no mar
ketable skills and would surely find
himself a vagrant without the em
ployment provided by the Stanford
Store. Rude and intoxicated? Yes.
Worthless to society? Doubtless. A
waste of space and life? Sure. But he
is a compatriot of all of us, and I'll be
damned if I'm going to let a few hun
dred thousand dollars get in the way
of employing the unemployable.

American Studies program
requires 60 units
The article "American Studies
revamping curriculum" (Oct. 17)
states that 75 credits are required
for the major. That is incorrect. Al
though many students complete the
major with approximately 75 cred
its, the minimum units required is 60
(a figure equal to the number of
credits required of majors in History
and English, for example, and high
er than that required for majors in
Art or Philosophy). Students inter
ested in accurate, up-to-date re
quirements for the major should
consult the current bulletin (pgs.
217-221). The number of American
Studies majors has been rising
steadily for the last four years. We
have a high number of students who
write honors essays and are award
ed University distinction and/or
are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. The
major welcomes students attracted
by the opportunity to do original, in
terdisciplinary research.

Review's reporting not shaky
You can imagine the irony with
which I read the Daily's latest attack
on The Stanford Review, "Review's
reporting shaky" (Oct. 21). In it, the
Editorial Board expressed its dissat
isfaction with the level of evidence
given to justify The Review's com
parison of MEChA with the Ku
Klux Klan. In particular, The Daily
notes the Review's "disingenuous,
dishonest journalism designed to
shock readers in order to draw them
into the editorial." Essentially, then,
The Daily is criticizing an editorial
for editorializing in an effort to
boost readership.
How quaint, and how terribly
ironic.
Liberal groups on campus have
consistently made vocal compar
isons of the College Republicans
and other extremist groups, at
points equivocating President Bush
to Adolf Hitler. On a more personal
note, just the other week I was ver
bally attacked because of my politi
cal ideology. And such faulty com
parisons are not reserved to student
groups or roaming packs of liberals
in The Daily itself compared the
Stanford Review to the KKK not
too many years ago. Are these to be
treated as objective comparisons of
historical memory and present real
ity, or are they simply flawed analo
gies designed to motivate, inspire or
rally?
Granted, The Review's compar
ison was rough and possibly mis
stated, but it should not obscure the
fact that MEChA, as an entity com
mitted to an exclusive racial identi
ty and culture, is racist that's
what racism is, to define based on
race. This doesn't mean that
MEChA goes out lynching whites
or even advocates a policy of brutal
oppression but then again, nei
ther does the present-day KKK,
which seems more committed to
getting drunk and ranting about an
tiquated notions of race and culture
than it does reenacting its more vi
olent past. This is not to say that the
KKK is any less racist now than it
was before; its action is indepen
dent of philosophy. This is why
modern-day Nazis are still feared in
Germany, not out of concern of a
political overthrow but because the
power of their racist beliefs. By ex
tension, a similarly thoughtful com
parison of the KKK and MEChA

can work, if taken in the proper
context. If the Review was at fault,
it was in not making this distinction
on more clear, though this is a far
cry from the more egregious sins
The Daily prescribes to the Review
editorial.
Claiming that The Review is
disingenuous or dishonest in an ef
fort to shock readers is itself a dis
honest statement designed to shock
readers. For instance, in a single
page of Tuesday's Daily, we are told
first that MEChA has a national or
ganization, and then later that they
do not. We are told that The Review
is entitled to its opinion, but then are
told not to do so in certain ways. We
learn that Stanford's conservative
voice on campus is "rather muted,"
and then we are treated to a front
page story about campus reaction to
just one of these campus conserva
tive voices. Then we are informed
that The Review should exercise
more journalistic integrity, but then
we have a column in the Oct. 15
Daily issue devoted to corrections
on news stories on a level below The
Review's investigative assignment
(keep in mind The Review has not
yet published another issue in which
it can correct or elaborate on any
points made in the prior issue). And
then we are told by The Stanford
Daily, of all things, how to best ap
peal to Stanford's conservative pop
ulation, which is far more nuanced
and diverse than The Daily recog
nizes.
All conservatives are not the
same, just as all comparisons are not
the same, which makes analogies
between anyone and the KKK, the
Nazis and other such groups inher
ently dangerous but it does not
make them wrong, if they are taken
within a carefully defined construct.
If The Review overstepped its
bounds by not defining these clear
borders as it very well might
have then The Daily could have
a point. If only The Daily's own re
porting were more balanced and
fair-minded, its paternalistic de
grees might be better taken. As it
stands, Stanford's other campus
publication is hardly the place to get
lectured about proper and fair jour
nalism.

In Tuesday's Daily (Oct. 21), my
investigative article for The Review
("An Investigation of Racism with
in MEChA," Oct. 15) was called
"unsubstantiated" and "inflamma
tory" in an editorial headlined "Re
view's reporting shaky." The Daily
failed to provide evidence contra
dicting any point of my article. In
truth, the facts of my article still
stand. Note the followihg:
Stanford MEChA posts the Na
tional Constitution as well as El
Plan de Santa Barbara on the
"about" section of its Web site with
no disclaimer, effectively endorsing
both documents. Furthermore,
when I asked for position state
ments, Stanford MEChA pointed
me to the documents on its Web site.
These endorsed documents show
that, contrary to the editorial's claim
that MEChA tries to "unite Hispan
ics regardless of their particular na
tionality," it degrades those who
don't identify as Chicano. El Plan de
Santa Barbara declares, "The Mexi
can American or Hispanic is a per
son who lacks self-respect and pride
in one's ethnic and cultural back
ground."
For the rest of the details, I sug
gest detractors read my article,
which methodically examines the
documents of MEChA and shows
how Stanford MEChA inherently
links itself to racist rhetoric.
The Daily did get one thing
right: The last line of my article was
a statement of opinion that Stan
ford students involved in MEChA
are misguided, but not as radical as
their documents suggest. It should
not have been included in my news
piece. As no factual mistakes were
presented by The Daily, I can only
assume that I was so harshly criti
cized for this one mistake, as I
know The Daily has the integrity
not to criticize someone for pre
senting an uncomfortable truth. I
apologize for the great consterna
tion this mistake caused The
Daily's editorial board.
The only shaky reporting I see
here is the Daily's own.
CHRISTINE BOEHM
Freshman, undeclared
Yesterday's editorial ("Review's
reporting shaky," Oct. 21) by The
Daily was just another example of
how poorly their fact-checking abil
ity really is. In a barely coherent
piece, The Daily attacked The Re

view for their comparison of
MEChA to the KKK, citing a lack of
evidence on their part to support the
comparison.
While these criticisms can be
valid if backed up with substantial
facts and argumentation, The Daily
not only failed to provide those
facts, but instead chose to make
statements that are patently false.
The most egregious example was
when The Daily stated, "The Re
view criticizes MEChA for attempt
ing to uphold its own particular cul
ture and unite Hispanics regardless
of their particular nationality." In
fact, this is the exact opposite of The
Review's stated criticism of
MEChA.
What they actually said:"... what
is perhaps the most injurious is the
disenfranchisement of Hispanics ad
vocated in El Plan Espiritual de Santa
Barbara. As opposed to Chicano,
"The Mexican American or Hispanic
is a person who lacks self-respect and
pride in one's ethnic and cultural
background.' Therefore, this plan
does not even recognize Hispanics ..
." (emphasis added).
The Review's criticism of
MEChA philosophy centered upon
its divisive nature, particularly with
regard to Hispanics. The Review
never criticized MEChA for at
tempting to preserve "its own par
ticular culture," but rather called
into question its ability to unite His
panics.
The Daily also states, "Although
The Review qualifies its use of the
Ku Klux Klan within the editorial to
be a comparison of the modern-day
Ku Klux Klan, which it claims is for
some reason more acceptable than
the historical Ku Klux Klan ..." (em
phasis added).
This claim that the modern KKK
is better, or more acceptable, than
the "historical" KKK was never
made.
The Review actually said, "Be
fore proceeding, note that the paral
lel is between modern day KKK and
MEChA, which is a much different
organization than the KKK of the
past. We are in no way suggesting
that MEChA is an organization that
lynches and terrorizes other races in
the manner the KKK has in the past,
nor has MEChA been the cause of
intimidation, pain, and anguish as
has the KKK. Where the compar
isons are familiar, however, are in
the present day ideologies of the or
ganizations."
Such obvious misrepresentation
of the facts make me wonder
whether The Daily even bothered to
read the Review's editorial before
they wrote theirs. If they had read it,
the only reason for getting it so
wrong is incompetence.
It makes you wonder why every
president of Stanford since Richard
Lyman has criticized The Daily for
their ridiculous errors and called on
them to hire a fact checker.

In defense of Daniel Pipes
Perhaps if Mabrookah Heneidi
("Student wary of campus speak
er," Letters to the Editor, Oct. 21)
had taken the time to hear the lec
ture by Daniel Pipes she would
have found that he is not anti-Mus
lim at all. As he described Islam: "It
is just another one of many faiths."
What he has studied and become
alarmed with for many years was
what he called "Militant Islam."
These are the folks who brought us
9/11 and are responsible for most
of the terror attacks occurring
around the world today. If Heneidi
is a peace-loving Muslim, she
should be equally concerned about
the hijacking of her religion and the
backlash of peace loving people of
the world. If Heneidi appreciates
any of the freedoms she experi
ences here, the freedom of speech
and press, the freedom to practice
her religion and if she is a citizen
the freedom to vote for the leaders
of her choice. These are not free
doms that would be allowed under
the form of Islam preached by the
Militant faction that Daniel Pipes is
hugely concerned about. All be
lievers in freedom, especially Mus
lims who believe in freedom should
listen to what Daniel Pipes is say
ing. Islam is not the enemy, but
those who murder in the name of
Allah are the enemies not only of
Christians and Jews but of peace
loving Muslims as well, and it is
only they who can address the
scourge that threatens to obliterate
all who won't subscribe to the vi
sion of those Daniel Pipes de
scribes as Militant Islamists.
