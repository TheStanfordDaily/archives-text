# TALES FROM DOWN UNDER
## Welcome to the Gus Club 
### 
Our next stop in this whirl
wind tour of Australia?
Heron Island, a mere dot
on the map of the vast
Great Barrier Reef. We showed up in
style, 80s style, that is. Forty-seven
students, fully decked out in bright
neon and black snorkeling gear and
rash guards, splashing noisily as we
made our way into the clear blue wa
ters, we were ready to go.
Enter Gus. He's a big guy, about
eight feet or so in length and he's not
exactly known for being amicable.
He's also the infamous grouper fish
that lives right underneath the boats in
the harbor, where we would be doing
our first snorkel on the island. Our tu
tors joked that every now and then, he
liked to snack on a human leg or arm.
And if he was really hungry, a small
child would provide a satisfying meal.
We entered the water cautiously,
joking that one of us might "meet"
Gus on some occasion, but secretly
hoping we never would. Soon after,
however, we were so dazzled by the
beautiful array of tropical fish that we
forgot all about our old fish friend. We
dove around happily in this heaven of
an ocean, enthusiastically pointing
out different species to each other.
I dove down contentedly at one
point to inspect a speedy little parrot
fish and suddenly saw a dark, ominous
figure. One word crossed my mind:
Gus! I choked into my snorkel, inhal
ing in a few cups of salty water. I
turned to my friend Ivan and cried out
in a raspy voice:
"Gus! He's here!"
A swarm of 40 students began flap
ping their fins wildly, swimming furi
ously towards the spot where I float
ed. Upon seeing such a frightful sight,
the poor fish probably had the first
symptoms of a fish cardiac arrest and
decided to speed away, allowing only
a small bunch of students to see the
legendary fish.

And so the Gus Club began. For
you see, the club was made up of peo
ple who had seen the infamous
grouper and other "dangerous" ma
rine life. The scarier the animals you
saw like sharks, sting rays or sea
snakes the
cooler your stories
became. And if
you had pictures or
video, well, you
just about made it
to the highest
ranks that day.
Every night, we
would sit around
the dinner table
swapping stories
like a bunch of seasoned war veterans:
"We saw a shovel-nosed ray on our
snorkel today it was about eight
feet long!"
"Yeah, well we saw three white
tipped reef sharks and got so close we
could practically hear them flapping
their tales!"
"You would never believe it, but I
spotted a rare venomous sea snake.
And I have pictures to prove it!"
Of course, none of these creatures
actually posed any danger to our
group; either they were harmless, or
they usually didn't attack humans. It
was simply exciting to believe that we
were living on the edge, interacting
with the most treacherous marine life
this reef harbored. We weren't really
scared most of the time because these
dangerous-looking creatures were
nothing compared to the prime fear
we had about this trip: We were really
worried we might strangle each other.
After all, when you have a group of
46 super-motivated Stanford class
mates, staying on a tiny island (so
small you can walk around it in 30
minutes!), with no way to vote anyone
out, well, you're bound to get a little
"island-sickness," a.k.a. "give me
some personal space or you'll be

lunch for Gus tomorrow afternoon."
Let me elaborate: We're all taking
the same lectures, sharing sometimes
cramped living spaces and eating near
ly all of our meals together. And we
participate in many "character-build
ing" group activities. It gives an entire
ly new meaning to the phrase "hanging
out you're your buddies 24 / 7."
What we've realized, though, is
that being on this amazing experience
is no fun if you don't have a pal with
whom you can share your stories or a
snorkeling buddy who will accompany
you to see the famed "Gus." Sure,
we've formed our groups of friends, as
is only natural, but when push comes
to shove, it doesn't matter who's
standing in the locker room when you
come back from a snorkel, you're
bound to tell them about all of the ex
citing and dazzling stuff you saw.
Additionally, spending so much
time together has allowed us to get to
know each other well. We've definite
ly had the opportunity to become
comfortable with each other. Perhaps
a little too comfortable people
begin to "forget" about showering on
a daily basis.
And to comfort you, dear reader,
let me assure you that your friend /
roommate / significant other survived
the island experience we're mov
ing on to the rainforest now. Just don't
ask about the wounds on her or his
body. They might be the result of a lit
tle shark bite or they might be the
result of a fight with a bunkmate or
group member who finally broke
down with island sickness one fateful
day. The truth? We'll simply never
know. What happens down under
may never resurface again.

Our next stop in this whirl
wind tour of Australia?
Heron Island, a mere dot
on the map of the vast
Great Barrier Reef. We showed up in
style, 80s style, that is. Forty-seven
students, fully decked out in bright
neon and black snorkeling gear and
rash guards, splashing noisily as we
made our way into the clear blue wa
ters, we were ready to go.
Enter Gus. He's a big guy, about
eight feet or so in length and he's not
exactly known for being amicable.
He's also the infamous grouper fish
that lives right underneath the boats in
the harbor, where we would be doing
our first snorkel on the island. Our tu
tors joked that every now and then, he
liked to snack on a human leg or arm.
And if he was really hungry, a small
child would provide a satisfying meal.
We entered the water cautiously,
joking that one of us might "meet"
Gus on some occasion, but secretly
hoping we never would. Soon after,
however, we were so dazzled by the
beautiful array of tropical fish that we
forgot all about our old fish friend. We
dove around happily in this heaven of
an ocean, enthusiastically pointing
out different species to each other.
I dove down contentedly at one
point to inspect a speedy little parrot
fish and suddenly saw a dark, ominous
figure. One word crossed my mind:
Gus! I choked into my snorkel, inhal
ing in a few cups of salty water. I
turned to my friend Ivan and cried out
in a raspy voice:
"Gus! He's here!"
A swarm of 40 students began flap
ping their fins wildly, swimming furi
ously towards the spot where I float
ed. Upon seeing such a frightful sight,
the poor fish probably had the first
symptoms of a fish cardiac arrest and
decided to speed away, allowing only
a small bunch of students to see the
legendary fish.

And so the Gus Club began. For
you see, the club was made up of peo
ple who had seen the infamous
grouper and other "dangerous" ma
rine life. The scarier the animals you
saw like sharks, sting rays or sea
snakes the
cooler your stories
became. And if
you had pictures or
video, well, you
just about made it
to the highest
ranks that day.
Every night, we
would sit around
the dinner table
swapping stories
like a bunch of seasoned war veterans:
"We saw a shovel-nosed ray on our
snorkel today it was about eight
feet long!"
"Yeah, well we saw three white
tipped reef sharks and got so close we
could practically hear them flapping
their tales!"
"You would never believe it, but I
spotted a rare venomous sea snake.
And I have pictures to prove it!"
Of course, none of these creatures
actually posed any danger to our
group; either they were harmless, or
they usually didn't attack humans. It
was simply exciting to believe that we
were living on the edge, interacting
with the most treacherous marine life
this reef harbored. We weren't really
scared most of the time because these
dangerous-looking creatures were
nothing compared to the prime fear
we had about this trip: We were really
worried we might strangle each other.
After all, when you have a group of
46 super-motivated Stanford class
mates, staying on a tiny island (so
small you can walk around it in 30
minutes!), with no way to vote anyone
out, well, you're bound to get a little
"island-sickness," a.k.a. "give me
some personal space or you'll be

lunch for Gus tomorrow afternoon."
Let me elaborate: We're all taking
the same lectures, sharing sometimes
cramped living spaces and eating near
ly all of our meals together. And we
participate in many "character-build
ing" group activities. It gives an entire
ly new meaning to the phrase "hanging
out you're your buddies 24 / 7."
What we've realized, though, is
that being on this amazing experience
is no fun if you don't have a pal with
whom you can share your stories or a
snorkeling buddy who will accompany
you to see the famed "Gus." Sure,
we've formed our groups of friends, as
is only natural, but when push comes
to shove, it doesn't matter who's
standing in the locker room when you
come back from a snorkel, you're
bound to tell them about all of the ex
citing and dazzling stuff you saw.
Additionally, spending so much
time together has allowed us to get to
know each other well. We've definite
ly had the opportunity to become
comfortable with each other. Perhaps
a little too comfortable people
begin to "forget" about showering on
a daily basis.
And to comfort you, dear reader,
let me assure you that your friend /
roommate / significant other survived
the island experience we're mov
ing on to the rainforest now. Just don't
ask about the wounds on her or his
body. They might be the result of a lit

result of a fight with a bunkmate or
group member who finally broke
down with island sickness one fateful
day. The truth? We'll simply never
know. What happens down under
may never resurface again.
