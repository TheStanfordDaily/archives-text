# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## Politicians can gab their guts out 
### 
Last week, the General en
trusted with providing in
telligence for the war on
terrorism came under fire.
It appears that Army Lt. Gen.
William G. Boykin made some
rather provocative remarks that put
his job, and some say American re
lations in the Middle East, in jeop
ardy.
Boykin's comments cast the war
on terrorism in a moralistic fight,
with Christians playing crusaders
and Osama bin Laden et al. painted
as pawns of a guy he calls Satan. Pre
dictably, the Pentagon backed their
man while the Muslim community
called for Boykin's resignation and
the chattering class in Washington
gassed about the message his reli
giously divisive comments sent to
the world. But at heart in this "inci
dent" are questions about free
speech and whether we should judge
someone by their actions or their
words.
First a look at Boykin's words:
A decorated veteran of foreign
campaigns, the three-star general
said of a 1993 battle with a Muslim
militia leader in Somalia: "I knew
that my God was bigger than his. I
knew that my God was a real God,
and his was an idol." After the man
was captured, Boykin said he told
the man, "You underestimated our
God."
And in several speeches to reli
gious audiences some of them
delivered in uniform Boykin said
the real enemy was not Osama bin
Laden but Satan, and Muslim na
tions hated America, "because
we're a Christian nation, because
our foundation and our roots are
Judeo-Christian."
Boykin claims these comments
were taken out of context. Friday he
released this mea culpa:
"I am not anti-Islam or any other
religion. I have frequently stated
that I do not see this current conflict
as a war between Islam and Chris
tianity. I support the free exercise of
all religions."Boykin swears off any

further speaking engagements.
Boykin is just one of several in
the news for making questionable
statements that belie possibly dan
gerous opinions. Governor-elect
Arnold Schwarzennegger, as you re

call, raised ire
over his ex
pressed admira
tion of Nazi dicta
tor, Adolf Hitler.
And Rush Lim
baugh's down
ward spiral began
with an observa
tion of the rela
tionship between
the media and a

minority athlete.
In each of these cases, the pattern
is the same: lots of buzz surrounding
the offending statements, some
form of apology / denial followed by
the gentle sounds of the whole mat
ter being swept under the carpet.
Offensive speech answered by ...
silence? Shouldn't it be answered by
more speech, a discussion rather
than an embarrassed hush? All
three of these men are American
spokespeople of sorts; Limbaugh
reached millions on his talk show,
Schwarzennegger is California's
new governor, and Boykin speaks
for the country with the most force,
he speaks through war.
But isn't what makes America so
great is that there is no one
spokesperson, no company fine, no
memorized mantra; people are free
to express what they believe, but
they are judged by what they do?
Before you answer those ques
tions, review the unscrubbed and
unacceptable comments of one of
history's "Great Ones" and deter
mine if the world would have been
better had Winston Churchill been
fired for his words.
"I do not understand the
squeamishness about the use of gas.
I am strongly in favor of using poi
sonous gas against uncivilized
tribes," Churchill wrote as president
of the Air Council, 1919.

"I do not admit... that a great
wrong has been done to the Red In
dians of America, or the black peo
ple of Australia ... by the fact that a
stronger race, a higher grade race ...
has come in and taken its place," he
said to Palestine Royal Commission,
1937.
"One may dislike Hitler's system
and yet admire his patriotic achieve
ment. If our country were defeated,
I hope we should find a champion as
admirable to restore our courage
and lead us back to our place among
the nations." He said in Great Con
temporaries, 1937.
"This movement among the
Jews is not new ... this worldwide
conspiracy for the overthrow of civ
ilization and for the reconstitution
of society on the basis of arrested
development, of envious malevo
lence, and impossible equality, has
been steadily growing." He wrote
on "Zionism versus Bolshevis'" in
the Illustrated Sunday Herald,
February 1920.
My point is not to apologize for
any viewpoints discussed in this arti
cle, but rather to call for an alle
giance of the First Amendment over
what is currently held as politically
correct. Boykin's job performance
isn't in the spotlight, but his (inflam
matory) words are. Maybe, though,
if a broad spectrum of thought was
in the open, instead of factional con
versations kept quiet for fear of "
reprisals, it would sweep out the dis
crimination, falsehoods and other
wise bizarre ideas for an open dis
cussion.
That was the point behind the
First Amendment, after all.
Boykin's time in the spotlight might
not be over, but I fear more what
this embarrassment does for truth
telling than I do for public outrage
over publicized opinions, no matter
how strange.
