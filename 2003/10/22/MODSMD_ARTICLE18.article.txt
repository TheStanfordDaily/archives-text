## Longing for the old days of low-tech cards 
### 
The "Baseball as America" exhibit at
the Baseball Hall of Fame begins
with a quotation on the wall: "Pop
culture holds up a mirror to society.
And when Americans gaze into that mirror..
. the reflection we see is very likely wearing a
baseball cap."
My reflection always had on a cap, and I
used to sit up on Gramma's front steps in
that hat, tearing through packs of 1990
Topps. I had a strict routine, tossing aside
Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa rookie
cards to first get to that disgustingly sugary
stick of gum at the bottom. The cards then
felt so perfect in my hands, rigid yet delicate,
with edges and corners so soft they were
handled and cherished like an old family
photo.
And I would sit there on Gramma's front
porch, memorizing stats and reading player
stories off the pulpy cardboard backs of the
cards as the afternoon sun
strained down through
pines around me. Living
was simple. Life with a card
in my hand just felt right. It
felt complete. It felt Amer
ican. It was good.
This past summer when I
last visited Gramma's, after
hugs and kisses, she present
ed me with some packs of
baseball cards. Good ole Gramma, gotta love
her. But as I scrunched up on the same steps
that had once been so big and comfortable,
something already felt terribly wrong.
Inside the first $4.99 pack were six cards
and a CD-Rom card. The best pick in the
bunch was a Sean Burroughs. $4.99?
Four dollars and ninety-nine cents for
Sean Burroughs, the kid with the mullet from
the Little League World Series 10 years ago?
And only six cards?
No Sammy, no Pujols, no Bonds? And
what's up with the CD-Rom card? This was
a pack of baseball cards right? We weren't
talking about concept cars here. Topps, what
happened?
And the cards! The plastic was crisper
than my Master Card. You could've stood
these things up, run them over with a Mack
truck and they'd still be in perfect condition. I
didn't want to give my attention to cards more
rigid than my 78-year-old fifth grade gram
mar teacher with the upside down smile. I
paid $4.99 for something that reminded me of
my elementary school nightmare?
Covered in holograms and chrome, more
of a machine than collectable, one card even
had the batter swing when I tilted it. Since
when did the cards play with me!?
My favorite stat on its back was "slugging
percentage with two outs and a lefty pitcher."
They might as well have put down "dou
bles when ahead in the count and a full moon
in a visitors stadium in mid July." What hap
pened to on-base-percentage and stolen
bases? What happened to RBI? What hap
pened to that concrete bubble gum I missed
now more than ever?
These cards, which had once been so pure,
so welcoming, so crafted, so charming, so
loveable, had become everything but. Amer
ica's National Pastime had lost its grit. Who
was this hobby for, robots?
Certainly not me.
But that $4.99 Topps Tek pack was just a
small reflection of baseball in the society's
cultural mirror.
Maybe—just maybe this hobby was
for me. This wasn't Topps' fault, but ours.
I was and still am part of an America
where digital toy pets and computer games
play with us more than we play with them,
where the backs of fortune cookies are room
for Web site advertising, where everything
from Christmas to grocery shopping is done
on a computer in the basement and human in
teraction need not exist. Buddies IM each
other from across the hall to talk, abdominal
machines do crunches for us as we sit watch
ing 900 channels of HDTV.
The virtual worlds we've built have us so
wired we've turned into machines ourselves.
How many times have we heard the phrase
"do more?" With this digital camera with
that digital phone with this gizmo with that
technology now "you can do more." The
end result, though, seems to be doing less.
Less exercise, less imagination, less creativ
ity, less handcraft, less personality less of
the little things that make us who we are.
Those baseball cards I left right on Gram
ma's kitchen table I'm sure they had a
self-cleaning mechanism along with the CD-
Rom. I didn't need the flash and the flare,
but I didn't need a Henry David Thoreau
protest either; I just needed something
human.
Sure, daily living has never incorporated
so much technology and gadgets as today, but
has it ever before removed so much of the life
from daily living?
How long until the reflection in the mirror
underneath the baseball cap is that not of a
cute little kid chewing some rock hard gum,
but a stern little robot with a CD-Rom? Ac
cording to Topps, we're a lot closer than it
seems.

ican. It was good.
This past summer when I
last visited Gramma's, after
hugs and kisses, she present
ed me with some packs of
baseball cards. Good ole Gramma, gotta love
her. But as I scrunched up on the same steps
that had once been so big and comfortable,
something already felt terribly wrong.
Inside the first $4.99 pack were six cards
and a CD-Rom card. The best pick in the
bunch was a Sean Burroughs. $4.99?
Four dollars and ninety-nine cents for
Sean Burroughs, the kid with the mullet from
the Little League World Series 10 years ago?
And only six cards?
No Sammy, no Pujols, no Bonds? And
what's up with the CD-Rom card? This was
a pack of baseball cards right? We weren't
talking about concept cars here. Topps, what
happened?
And the cards! The plastic was crisper
than my Master Card. You could've stood
these things up, run them over with a Mack
truck and they'd still be in perfect condition. I
didn't want to give my attention to cards more
rigid than my 78-year-old fifth grade gram
mar teacher with the upside down smile. I
paid $4.99 for something that reminded me of
my elementary school nightmare?
Covered in holograms and chrome, more
of a machine than collectable, one card even
had the batter swing when I tilted it. Since
when did the cards play with me!?
My favorite stat on its back was "slugging
percentage with two outs and a lefty pitcher."
They might as well have put down "dou
bles when ahead in the count and a full moon
in a visitors stadium in mid July." What hap
pened to on-base-percentage and stolen
bases? What happened to RBI? What hap
pened to that concrete bubble gum I missed
now more than ever?
These cards, which had once been so pure,
so welcoming, so crafted, so charming, so
loveable, had become everything but. Amer
ica's National Pastime had lost its grit. Who
was this hobby for, robots?
Certainly not me.
But that $4.99 Topps Tek pack was just a
small reflection of baseball in the society's
cultural mirror.
Maybe—just maybe this hobby was
for me. This wasn't Topps' fault, but ours.
I was and still am part of an America
where digital toy pets and computer games
play with us more than we play with them,
where the backs of fortune cookies are room
for Web site advertising, where everything
from Christmas to grocery shopping is done
on a computer in the basement and human in
teraction need not exist. Buddies IM each
other from across the hall to talk, abdominal
machines do crunches for us as we sit watch
ing 900 channels of HDTV.
The virtual worlds we've built have us so
wired we've turned into machines ourselves.
How many times have we heard the phrase
"do more?" With this digital camera with
that digital phone with this gizmo with that
technology now "you can do more." The
end result, though, seems to be doing less.
Less exercise, less imagination, less creativ
ity, less handcraft, less personality less of
the little things that make us who we are.
Those baseball cards I left right on Gram
ma's kitchen table I'm sure they had a
self-cleaning mechanism along with the CD-
Rom. I didn't need the flash and the flare,
but I didn't need a Henry David Thoreau
protest either; I just needed something
human.
Sure, daily living has never incorporated
so much technology and gadgets as today, but
has it ever before removed so much of the life
from daily living?
How long until the reflection in the mirror
underneath the baseball cap is that not of a
cute little kid chewing some rock hard gum,
but a stern little robot with a CD-Rom? Ac
cording to Topps, we're a lot closer than it
seems.
