# POLO ON A HIGH HORSE
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Two years ago, when Cary Kempson first learned about
Stanford's polo club he had never seen a polo match before.
"A friend of mine rode horses her entire life and was
looking for a way to keep riding at Stanford," he recounted.
"She convinced me to join the club."
Kempson, now a junior, serves as the club's president
and devotes a large part of his day to Stanford polo.
Here's a newsflash for you: "Stanford's polo club seeks
new members."
Yeah, that's right.
You heard it correctly.
Stanford actually has a polo team and the co-ed club has

been galloping along ever since several Stanford students
revived the team in the early 1980s.
No, no ... not water polo. This is the kind of polo played
with horses and mallets and athletes posed in antiquated
looking uniforms reminiscent of old-English high society.
"A lot of people don't know about the polo club be
cause we don't play on campus," he said. "People aren't
going to bike up Alpine Road to see a sport that they know
nothing about."
But this year's team is trying to change all that.
They're trying to make the sport, itself, more accessible
to Stanford students by organizing carpools down to prac
tice at Webb Ranch (off Alpine Road) and holding interac
tive demonstrations for interested students.
Stanford maintains both a women's and a men's intercol

legiate team that competes against other schools, though
filling a roster is sometimes a difficult task.
"The women's team will probably end up with five or six
players and the men have about four people who are inter
ested right now," said Heather Lake, a junior who is enter
ing her third year with the team.
"We are still looking for new members," added Stanford
head coach Greg Wolff. "There are two positions one on
each team that are still vacant and need to be filled."
Aside from the six to eight "hardcore" undergraduate
players who compete, the polo club boasts a community
of 20 to 30 players who frequent Webb Ranch to mount
the horses.

Like Kempson, Lake, who cur
rently serves as one of two horse
managers on the team, had never
played polo before when she first
joined the club.
"I've been riding horses pretty
much my whole life and it was nice to
get involved and try something new,"
she said. "Now I'm at Webb Ranch
almost everyday ... to make sure
that the horses are properly taken
care of and exercised.
"Having riding experience does

help but we've had people come in
with varying levels of experience
and be successful," Lake added.
"It's a little bit slow starting out and
it's a pretty complicated game, but
once you get the hang of it, it's real
ly fun."
The season runs from November
through Febuary, culminating with
the Western Regionals, which will be
played in Sacramento, Calif., this
year. While both the women's and
men's teams play around six to eight
games a season, the majority of their
time is spent at Webb Ranch.
"We spend a lot of time practicing
and keeping the horses in shape,"
Kempson said. "Competitions are

kind of like an added bonus. They're
a big part of what we do, but they're
not the only thing."
Needless to say, polo isn't an in
expensive sport. From horse mainte
nance to travel to equipment, the
Cardinal club tries to offset costs
through funding from the Stanford
Club Sports program and communi
ty donations.
"The polo community around this
area has been really awesome," Lake
said. "They donate horses when they
can and always offer advice."
In addition, the polo team collects
club dues. Each player is responsible
for paying $2OO per quarter to be a
part of the team.

For those who think that polo is a
"soft" sport reserved for Bel Air
country clubs and ... well, schools
like Stanford, you're only half right.
Polo, itself, is a potentially dangerous
sport because whenever you mix
huge and sometimes unpre
dictable animals into any type of
athletic competition there are some
risks involved.
"It's true that anytime 24 legs, six
mallets and a ball are traveling at
break-neck speeds there is a possibil
ity of harm for both horse and rider,"
writes Kempson on Stanford's polo
Web site. "However, extreme care is
taken to minimize the risks."
The Cardinal's polo club and the

Polo Training Foundation (the body
whichi governs college and high school
polo programs) seem extremely cog
nizant of the risks involved and, like
wise, take extra preventative mea
sures to insure the safety of both the
horses and their riders.
"All of the rules were created for
the safety of the players and the hors
es, which alleviates a lot of the dan
ger," Kempson noted. "However, un
expected things happen sometimes.
[ln my first game], I fell off the horse
and that scared me a little."
But he got back up and kept on rid
ing and two years later he finds himself
completely enthralled by the sport,
which is, perhaps, the point of it all.

"If you would have told me a few
years ago that I'd be playing on the
Stanford polo team, I wouldn't
have believed you," Kempson said.
"Going out arid riding is a wonder
ful break from school and classes
and problem sets. Galloping on a
horse at close to 25 miles per hour
and hitting a ball 75 yards down
field - the first time that happens
is an amazing feeling."
He pauses.
"It's just an incredible sport
there's really no other way to de
scribe it."
