# POLO ON A HIGH HORSE
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Two years ago, when Cary Kempson first learned about
Stanford's polo club he had never seen a polo match before.
"A friend of mine rode horses her entire life and was
looking for a way to keep riding at Stanford," he recounted.
"She convinced me to join the club."
Kempson, now a junior, serves as the club's president
and devotes a large part of his day to Stanford polo.
Here's a newsflash for you: "Stanford's polo club seeks
new members."
Yeah, that's right.
You heard it correctly.
Stanford actually has a polo team and the co-ed club has

been galloping along ever since several Stanford students
revived the team in the early 1980s.
No, no ... not water polo. This is the kind of polo played
with horses and mallets and athletes posed in antiquated
looking uniforms reminiscent of old-English high society.
"A lot of people don't know about the polo club be
cause we don't play on campus," he said. "People aren't
going to bike up Alpine Road to see a sport that they know
nothing about."
But this year's team is trying to change all that.
They're trying to make the sport, itself, more accessible
to Stanford students by organizing carpools down to prac
tice at Webb Ranch (off Alpine Road) and holding interac
tive demonstrations for interested students.
Stanford maintains both a women's and a men's intercol

legiate team that competes against other schools, though
filling a roster is sometimes a difficult task.
"The women's team will probably end up with five or six
players and the men have about four people who are inter
ested right now," said Heather Lake, a junior who is enter
ing her third year with the team.
"We are still looking for new members," added Stanford
head coach Greg Wolff. "There are two positions one on
each team that are still vacant and need to be filled."
Aside from the six to eight "hardcore" undergraduate
players who compete, the polo club boasts a community
of 20 to 30 players who frequent Webb Ranch to mount
the horses.
