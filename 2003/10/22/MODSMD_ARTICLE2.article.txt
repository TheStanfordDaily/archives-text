# Weekend film festival kicks off
## UN
						Association festival to show movies about world issues, problems 
### DAVID HERBERT 
The sixth annual United Nations Asso
ciation Film Festival will begin tonight at
Cubberly Auditorium.
The festival, which runs until Sunday,
will feature 31 documentaries from
around the world on issues ranging from
genetically modified foods, sex traffick
ing in southeast Asia and the AIDS cri
sis in Africa. The goal of the event is to
bring the academic community and the
international community together, ac
cording to Stanford faculty member Jas
mina Bojic, the festival's founder and
director.
"We want to bring films to campus that
are not usually found in theaters," she said.
Sophomore Lindsay Mecca, co-presi
dent of the Stanford Film Society, which is
a major driving force behind the festival,
echoed Bojic's comments.
"To have so many distinguished film
makers and their films on campus is a won
derful opportunity for the community to
experience different perspectives about is
sues that occur worldwide," she said.
In the past, the festival has achieved
just that, according to Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, who teaches a class
entitled The Documentary Tradition and
is an accomplished filmmaker himself.
"It's been very successful in increasing
interest in the documentary genre and
raising awareness about social issues," he
said.
Bojic agreed.
"People always ask me after the festi
val how they can bring these films to their
organizations and groups," she said.
"Many films are actually being screened
in the United States for the first time at
this festival."
Bojic founded the United Nations As
sociation Film Festival in 1998 for several
reasons. That year marked the 50th an
niversary of the signing of the Declaration

of Human Rights. Additionally, the Unit
ed Nations itself was chartered in nearby
San Francisco. Finally, Stanford has his
torically had close ties to the documentary
genre, dating back to the days of Leland
Stanford.
That connection is still visible today.
The festival will show the work of three
Stanford graduates. The festival will open
tonight with a screening of "Robert Capa:
In Love and War," directed by Anne
Makepeace, and will close on Sunday with
"Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard
Rustin," directed by Nancy Kates. Also
screened during the festival will be Renee

Fischer's "Those Who Trespass." All
three filmmakers studied in Stanford's
Communications Department.
Despite its name, the festival is not po
litically or financially connected with the
United Nations. Thus, support for the
event comes largely from Stanford groups
like the Haas Center and the Center for
East Asian Studies, as well as local com
panies and non-profits, usually in the form
of services.
"Eighty-five percent of support comes
in the form of in-kind donations," Bojic
said.
The San Francisco-based International

Diplomacy Council has provided free
publicity for the event for years.
"Our organization tries to build glob
al understanding, specifically between
the Bay Area and the international Com
munity," said Lauren Travis, manager of
marketing and membership. "We be
lieve there are many means of accom
plishing this. The film festival is a perfect
example."
Senior Mike Endler, who is volunteer
ing at this year's festival, is enthusiastic
about the event.
"Anyone interested in film or foreign
cultures should definitely attend," he said.
