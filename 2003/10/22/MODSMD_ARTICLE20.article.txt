# Men's tennis struggles in Eugene
## 
### KAIYA REEVE 
Injuries plagued the Stanford men's ten
nis team as none of the eight-team members
who traveled to Eugene, Ore., for the Omni
Hotels Regional Championship were able
to reach the finals.
The winners of the tournament in singles
and doubles competition qualified for the
Omni Hotels National Indoor Champi
onship in Ann Arbor, Mich., to be held on
Nov. 6-9, which will now be devoid of any
Stanford competitors.
Overall, the tournament helped the
coaching staff determine the strengths and
weaknesses of the team, and the level of ex
pertise on the courts displayed by the Stan
ford men underlined the fact that they are a
Division I team to be reckoned with.
"It was great to see the entire team in ac
tion," said Stanford head coach Dick
Gould. "It was a timely tournament for us, it
was good to see everyone play and some of
the guys played the best tennis games I've
seen yet. It's a good base for improvement
through the rest of the season and we will
only get better."
The team started competition on Friday
as the Round of 64 began with wins by half
of the Cardinal team, the other four were
sent to the consolation rounds after losing
their first round matches.
At the top half of the draw, No. 5-seed
James Pade flattened opponent Jarrod
Dieparam of the University of Hawaii 6-2,6-
0. He then overwhelmed California's Patrick
Briaud 6-1,6-4, and then dispatched another
Golden Bear, No. 9-seeded Tyler Browne, 6-
3, 2-6, 7-5. Pade's winning streak eventually
came to end during the quarterfinals when
he was defeated by Washington's Christoph
Palmanshofer 6-3, 6-2.
In the bottom half of the draw, junior
Phil Sheng moved into the Round of 32 by
posting a 6-4,6-1 win, defeating Drew Ernst
of Gonzaga University. He was then pitted
against University of Oregon's Sven Swin
nen and lost 6-4, 6-2.
No. 2-seed and Cardinal standout Sam
Warburg was enjoying a winning streak up
until the semifinals, when he was forced to
retire due to illness. After receiving a bye in
the first round, the junior easily dispatched
of Washington's Nick Weiss 6-1, 6-2 and
moved on to win his next match over Cal's
Jake Leivent 6-1, 4-4.
Warburg then moved into the quarterfi
nals to play No. 7 seed Wayne Wong from

California, beating him 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. In the
semifinals, he pitted his skills against No. 6
seed Alex Slovic, giving up the first set 6-1
and then retiring in the second 4-4. Warburg
will now be out of commission for the rest of
the fall season for health reasons.
Senior Joe Kao was forced into the con
solation round after losing 7-6, 6-2 to Uni
versity of Portland's Quinn Borchand.
After being handed byes in the first two
rounds of consolation play, Kao defeated
Francisco Zepponi of Santa Clara 6-3, 7-6.
Kao continued to move up in rounds by
trouncing his next opponent, Michael Ricks
of the University of Washington, 6-3, 6-1
and eventually was narrowly defeated in the
semifinal round of the consolation draw by
Washington player Chris Floyd 7-6,3-6,6-2.
Kao's skill on the court did not go unno
ticed by Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"Joe played the smartest tennis he's
played in the four years he's been at Stan
ford," Gould boasted.
Freshman Eric McKean was also
thrown into the consolation round after
being defeated 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 by St. Mary's
Dino Ferrari in the main draw round of
64. There, he downed opponent Robert
Penney of Gonzaga 6-1, 6-3. After receiv
ing a bye in the next round, McKean lost a
close 7-5, 7-5 match after battling Michael
Ricks.
"The three freshmen played very well
but have a lot to learn," Gould said. "They
will soon develop into really great players."
In doubles action, Morris and Warburg
paired up as the No. 4 seed and crushed St.
Mary's opponents Adam Fauvre and J.J.
Whitlinger 8-1. They then moved on to
beat Fesenthal and Ricks of Washington
by the same score. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the pair was not able to compete
in the semifinal round due to Warburg's
injury.
The Stanford duo of McKean and Pade
overcame Gonzaga's Bryce Cooper and
Drew Ernst 8-3, only to be edged 8-6 in the
round of 16 by Cal's Tyler Browne and
Dean Wallace.
In other first round action of doubles
play, Kao and Rasmussen were defeated
by Cal's Andreas Peterson and John Pettit
and Stanford's Sheng and Wan lost a close
9-7 match against University of Portland's
Quinn Borchard and Roman Borvanov.
The Cardinal's next tournament will be
in Maui against the University of Hawaii on
Nov. 28.
