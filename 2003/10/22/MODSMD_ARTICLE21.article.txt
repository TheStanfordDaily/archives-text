# Water polo for dummies
## 
### 
Stanford students routinely fail to ap
preciate the many excellent teams
that compete here each year, and
sadly it's a tendency I too have helped
perpetuate. Even as a Californian, a member
of the state that probably produces the most
water polo talent in the country, I had no
idea how the sport was played.
And now, as the defending national
champion Stanford men's water polo team
approaches midseason, there are probably
still a lot of you out there who are wondering
what happens during a match. Coming in as
a relative novice where water polo is con
cerned, I can empathize.
So here's a brief introduction to the most
violent and exciting of pool sports.
To start, there are seven players in the
pool at any time, including the team's goalie.
Water polo, essentially, is like a combination
of soccer and basketball except it's in a
pool. Not only do players need to tread
water, they must be able to lift themselves to
waist level in the water to gain enough lever
age to launch the ball at the net.
And the pacing is so much faster.
A match consists of four seven-minute
periods. The shot clock lasts 35 seconds.
Stalling is considered a foul. Halftime lasts

five minutes. Each team has three time-outs
during regulation and one during overtime.
If there's a tie at the end of regulation,
they have two three-minute overtime peri
ods. If the score is still locked, there's a sud
den death overtime where the first team to
score wins.
Stanford's Athletic Department likes to
refer to the third overtime as "sudden victo
ry" overtime. I'm not sure what prompted
this euphemism. Perhaps it was coined by
the same people who produced the "Honor
the Game" buttons handed out at Cal / Stan
ford match a couple of years ago.
Players come in and out of the game fair
ly frequently since there are unlimited sub
stitutions. The best water polo players can
dive into any position. The drivers are fast
swimmers who move the ball down the pool.
The two-meter or "hole" plays closest to the
goal. Like the center in basketball they are
big guys close to the net.
The offensive hole-men in theory have
the best chance at scoring. This is probably
also the most heavily defended position, and
the players responsible for guarding at two 1
meters have a high risk of being excluded for
fouls. Junior Tony Azevedo, who leads the
league in scoring with 45 goals for the sea

son, is a driver but also
plays in the hole.
Utility is the most ver
satile position, with players
switching from more of
fensive to more defensive
roles. Senior Mike Derse
has played defense in the
past, but is now a utility
player with 16 goals this
season.

The goalie is clearly a key defensive play
er, but he plays a dual role, calling out infor
mation to the offense at the other end of the
30-meter-long. pool. Goalies call out plays,
decide who's open to receive the ball and
usually keep an eye on the shot-clock, count
ing down when time is about to run out.
A whistle from one of the officials marks
a foul, but water polo is a fierce and intense
ly physical sport, especially under the sur
face of the water. Most of the fouls that occur
are never called by the refs. One key skill is
to be able to look as innocent as possible, ex
plained former Stanford water polo player
Jeff Nesmith, Class of 2003
"Water polo is one of the only sports
aside from hockey and rugby in which fight
ing is a normal part of the game, and a lot of

that fighting is accepted by players and ref
erees," Nesmith said.
Usually when a minor foul is called, the
players separate for a few seconds and the
fouled player puts the ball back in play. In
the event of a personal foul, the offending
player will be excluded from the game and
must go to a "penalty box" next to the goal
for 20 seconds or until a change in posses
sion.
For fouls, think basketball in the pool.
There's a good deal of contact, but only seri
ous holding or kicking are grounds for exclu
sion. Three personal fouls and a player is
red-flagged and out of the game. Fouls can
also lead to free throws and other penalty
shots, usually if the refs feel the shot would
have gone in if not for the foul. Offensive
fouls are possible too, when the offensive
player holds, hooks or pushes off of his de
fender.
If a defensive player fouls and is exclud
ed, then his team must play a man short for
the remainder of the play. The offensive
team then has an advantage and if it scores,
it has pulled off a "power-play." I wonder
at this terminology, but perhaps it comes
from overpowering the other team with su
perior numbers.

Players have to be able to palm the ball
since they can't touch it with both hands at
the same time. They can't hold the ball at any
time. They must either be swimming with the
ball (dribbling), protecting it while they are
stationary in the pool or taking a shot.
There's also a penalty call similar to off
sides in soccer. Players have to stay behind
the line of the ball. If they enter the area
within two-meters of the goal in front of the
ball, a penalty is called.
And are the caps with the earguards real
ly necessary? Consider how the refs would
be able to tell who was on what team. The
caps are it uniform-wise.
Every team has two sets of caps, one light,
one dark. The home team always wears dark
caps. The golie's cap always has red or white.
Oh, and sorry Cal, the caps can't be yellow or
gold we don't want to mistake a player's
head for the ball.
