## Lawsuit filed against Boston College 
### RYAN HEFFERNAN THE HEIGHTS 
(U-WIRE) CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.
Boston College is facing another hurdle on the
road to the Atlantic Coast Conference after Con
necticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
filed a lawsuit last week against the University and
Athletic Director Gene DeFilippo.
The suit, filed Oct. 14 on behalf of the Univer
sity of Connecticut, West Virginia University,
Rutgers University, and the University of Pitts
burgh, also names the ACC and its officers. It al
leges that BC's departure is part of a "backroom
conspiracy" on the part of the University, DeFil
ippo, the ACC, and the University of Miami to
"destroy" the Big East Conference. It seeks a fi
nancial payout for the damages sustained by the
plaintiffs, as well as the coverage of legal fees, and
possibly blocking the institutions from joining the
ACC by having the court "enter an appropriate
injunction to ameliorate the effects of Defen
dants' conduct."
"With full knowledge of the grave injury that
likely would be inflicted by their scheme, the ACC
has conspired with Defendant BC and Miami to
induce them to abandon their contractual and
fiduciary obligations to their partner schools in the
Big East," the plaintiffs claim in court papers filed

in Rockville Superior Court and obtained by The
Heights.
"With BC's acceptance, the conspiracy among
the ACC, BC, and Miami is complete," the court
documents continue. "They have succeeded in
stripping the Big East of three important mem
bers, creating a substantial risk that the Big East
and its members will lose significant revenues and
will be placed at risk of losing their automatic bid
to the Bowl Championship Series, which would
have disastrous consequences for the Big East
Conference as a whole and for Plaintiffs individu
ally."
The Big East, Virginia Tech, and Syracuse Uni
versity are not party to the lawsuit.
"It is a completely baseless lawsuit," said BC
spokesperson Jack Dunn. "It's politically motivat
ed, and it is beneath the dignity of the attorney
general's office. From our standpoint, the allega
tions against Gene DeFilippo are unfounded, irre
sponsible, and we will vigorously defend both
Gene and Boston College in court proceedings."
"The constitution of the Big East provides
withdrawal provisions," he said. "Schools are
within their right to withdraw from this or from
any other conference."
Since 1991, more than 70 colleges and universi
ties have changed conference affiliation, said
Dunn.

"All have done so without acrimony or law
suits," he said. "The Big East is seeking to pursue
legal action that has previously not existed within
the NCAA as schools have sought to realign
themselves out of their own desires."
The lawsuit also notes the "demonstrated com
mitment" of the state of Connecticut and the
UConn system in upgrading the football program to
be eligible to play Division I-A within the Big East.
Among the upgrades was the construction of
Rentschler Field, a $9O million football stadium,
and an investment of $10.2 million to join the Big
East Football Conference.
The Eagles last played in Rentschler on Sept.
13, a full month before accepting an invitation
from the ACC, when more than 2,000 BC students
took a road trip to the stadium, where they were
pelted with full beer cans, eggs, and water bottles
by UConn fans, according to a report in the Sept.
16 edition of The Heights.
In addition, the suit alleges that the defendants
"conspired" to "destroy" the Big East with the de
parture of BC, Miami, and Virginia Tech so that
they could "reap a larger share of the benefits of
the BCS [Bowl Championship Series] venture."
The suit also states that DeFilippo used his po
sition as president of the Big East's board of ath
