# Prof irked by unaccredited universities

### BETH HURTUBISE DAILY ILLINI 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111. While some
people benefit from Web sites that offer high
school and college degrees through the Internet
for little or no work, others including one Uni
versity of Illinois professor are concerned that
degrees provided by unaccredited institutions are
making job applicants appear more qualified than
they really are.
George Gollin, a University of Illinois physics
professor, said online degrees were first brought
to his attention in the form'of pop-up Internet
windows.
He said it was particularly annoying because
the advertisements appeared two or three
times a day and were difficult to ignore. Gollin
called to complain, but ultimately just left a
message.
Upon receiving a response, Gollin learned that

he could buy a diploma for a second doctorate de
gree from this company for a couple thousand dol
lars. They would also provide letters of recom
mendation and a transcript.
Gollin was concerned by this and decided to re
search Parkwood University and other unaccred
ited universities.
Every legitimate learning institution in the
United States is approved by an independent
agency called the Counsel of Higher Education
Accreditation, Gollin said. The process of ac
creditation is lengthy, and must be repeated
every five years.
Most of the organizations that sell diplomas
through Web sites are unaccredited, he discov
ered.
Gollin said one organization adds a disclaimer
to its Web site that says: "I further understand that
The University offers no classes, no curriculum,
no lectures, no staff or faculty, no literature, learn
ing materials, testing, or thesis or dissertation re

view."
"Some of these organizations are called diplo
ma mills," Gollin said. "A diploma mill is an orga
nization which will give what looks like an acade
mic degree with little or no work involved."
At one such diploma mill, Gollin was asked to
complete a 100-question exam in order to receive
his degree.
"The first question was: 'What is the name of
the house that the president lives in?'" Gollin
said.
He purposely answered wrong to more than 75
percent of the questions. This score was high
enough for him to receive an associate of arts de
gree with a 2.8 grade point average if he sent the
organization $l,OOO.
Gollin compiled over 100 pages of his research
on his Web site, which was taken down after a man
who ran one of the diploma mills began sending e
mails complaining about the site in
early August.
Other organizations sent e-mails
to the physics department head and
administrators at the U. Illinois,
Gollin said.
He said the e-mails were very
angry and the people who sent them
were threatening to sue him.
"I asked to meet with administra
tors, lawyers and my department
head to sort out the legal issues," he
said.
"We had a meeting to respond to
questions that he raised and decide
how to safely portray his informa
tion," said Robin Kaler, university

spokeswoman. "Some of his allega
tions and statements could have
been considered personal attacks.
We agreed that a better place for his
Web site would be at an accrediting
agency."
Gollin said he contacted the Ore
gon Office of Degree Authorization
to find a home for his research.
"They agreed to review it, copy
right it and make it their own,"
Gollin said.
Alan Contreras, administrator of
the Oregon Office of Degree Autho
rization, said the research was "real
ly excellent work."
"From our point of view this re
search is a consumer protection ac
tion," Contreras said.
He said the main issue the state of
Oregon is concerned with is whether
a person is using a degree that they
bought from a diploma mill.

"You wouldn't want to bring
your children to see a doctor that got
his job with an unaccredited diplo
ma," Contreras said.
These organizations have be
come a major issue because of the
Internet, he said. Oregon has made
it a misdemeanor to sell or use a
fake diploma.
"In North Dakota, selling an un
accredited diploma is a felony," Con
treras said, "but, as far as I know,
there is no law against it in Illinois."
Gollin's research and informa
tion will soon be available at
http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda, in
the unaccredited universities sec
tion, Contreras said.
"I feel that I've come out of this
well," Gollin said. "I feel safer. What
I wanted to accomplish is to have in
formation on these unaccredited
schools available on the Internet."
