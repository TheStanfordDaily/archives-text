# Dartmouth students inspect Greek rules

### COLIN BARRY THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.
In the wake of allegations that
Dartmouth College's Greek regu
lations are unfairly enforced, Stu
dent Assembly leaders have
formed a group to investigate the
rules governing Dartmouth's fra
ternities and sororities.
"We basically want to revisit
some of the policies that have
been enacted and try to get a sense
of the direction the College is
going," Student Body President
Janos Marton, a senior, said.
Leader James Baehr, 'O5, said
the group consisting of mem
bers of the Assembly's student or
ganizations committee has sin
gled out a number of specific poli
cies to investigate. Assembly lead
ers will reportedly be meeting
with several key administrators in
the coming weeks.
Topping the list of concerns
will be the burden of Greek com
pliance with the upcoming Col
lege requirements regarding phys
ical plant accessibility and safety,
according to Baehr.
Forthcoming facility audits will
require fraternities and sororities
to undertake expensive construc
tion, adding features like fire es
capes and access ramps for wheel
chairs. Although Dartmouth
would have to pay for such modi
fications to College-owned greek
houses, corporations with private
ly-owned houses would likely
have to foot the bill themselves.
"The fees could range from
$200,000 to $BOO,OOO, and most
houses don't' have more than
$50,000 in their accounts," Mar
ton said.
Organizations with their own
houses would presumably be
forced to take out large loans to

pay.
Baehr framed the issue as one
of fairness on the part of the Col
lege.
"We think that if the College is
going to mandate something, they
need to fund it," Baehr said.
Assembly leaders said the
group also specifically aims to end
regulations that make it difficult
for Greek organizations to serve
beer from kegs. Keg regulations
have come under fire in recent
years by environmentally-con
cerned.students, who say that such
policies result in large volumes of
wasted aluminum cans.
"It doesn't make sense ecolog
ically, it doesn't make sense finan
cially, it doesn't even make sense
from a sobriety standpoint,"
Baehr said.
Greek leaders also said that the
canned beer poses more problems
from a distribution standpoint
than beer in kegs.
"From a sorority perspective,
we prefer having control over the
alcohol in our space," Epsilon
Kappa Theta President Katie
Lieberg, a senior, said. "If we have
one keg in one location, we're
much better at being able to mon
itor that under-21-year-olds are
not having a drink."
In exploring policy, Assembly
leaders expressed a desire to over
come the atmosphere of con
frontation that characterized rela
tions between Greeks and the ad
ministration in recent years.
"Many students in the past had
the perception that the adminis
tration was battling the Greek sys
tem," Baehr said. "A lot of this is
about the administration showing
us that there's really a new tone in
Parkhurst: one that's accepting
and positive about the Greek sys
tem and all that it brings to Dart
mouth."
