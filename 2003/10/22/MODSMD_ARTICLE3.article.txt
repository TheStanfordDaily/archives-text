# Econ prof heads to Hong Kong
## 
### JULIE YEN 
Stanford Economics Prof. Lawrence
Lau has been appointed as vice-chancel
lor of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, officials announced last week. Lau
has agreed to serve for the next six years,
starting July 1, the Chinese University
said in a press release.
Prior to his appointment, Lau met with
undergraduates, postgraduates, and rep
resentatives from the teachers' and staff
associations, alumni, senate, and universi
ty management at the Chinese University
to discuss development strategies for the
university.
If Lau does not receiye approval for
extended leave, he cannot return to Stan
ford after his term at the Chinese Univer
sity. His leave request is pending approval
from the Dean of the School of Humani

ties and Sciences and the Provost.
"The general rule is that faculty cannot
take leave beyond a two-year period [in a
seven-year period] without special ex
emption from the Provost," said Dean of
the Social Sciences Karen Cook. "The
reason for the policy is that we like for the
faculty to be at Stanford to teach under
graduates and train graduate students.
We need their leadership."
The council selected Lau because he is
a "very distinguished economist and an
educationalist with vision and tremen
dous experience," according to the re
lease. Lau's research includes economic
development, growth and theory in East
Asian countries. In 1966, he developed
one of the first econometric models of
China, which he continues to revise and
update.
Freshman Rebecca Liao began work

ing with Lau this quarter to further ex
plore the rapid evolution of China's eco
nomic infrastructure. She has researched
China's political economy for the past
three years.
"I was really frustrated by the tenden
cy of economists to explain China's social
ist-market economy with free-market
principles," Liao said. "Dr. Lau, however,
has treated China as a new kind of econo
my that needs to be studied, for the time
being, on an empirical rather than theo
retical level."
Lau declined to comment to The
Daily.
The 58-year-old professor received his
bachelor's degree in physics and econom
ics from Stanford and has served as the
University's Co-Director of the Asia / Pa
cific Institute and Director of the Institute
for Economic Policy Reform.
