# Residents, commuters try to resolve traffic issues

### MELISSA CHEE 
The wide-open stretch of Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard on the
south edge of campus may get a
facelift to slow down traffic.
On Sunday, community mem
bers devoted their afternoon to
brainstorming ideas for traffic
calming improvements on Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard between
Stanford Avenue and Campus
Drive East.
The defined goals were to re
duce speeding, improve safety
for bicyclists, pedestrians and
motorists while maintaining res
idential access to the road. The
agenda addressed high travel
speeds, accidents, project goals
and traffic calming plans for the
corridor.
The Santa Clara County
Roads and Airport Department
sponsored the public meeting at
Tresidder Memorial Union. Ma
soud Akbarzadeh, a county traffic
engineer, said pedestrian and bi
cycle use around the Dish area

has increased in the last 10 years.
He said the vicinity attracts vari
ous people like recreational jog
gers and walkers, and their safety
is important.
"Our previous attempts have
shown some reduction in the
speed, but not sufficiently so it's a
good environment for all the road
users," Akb.arzadeh said.
"Anything that is developed to
reduce speeding is going to be of
benefit to [students] too," said
Therese Brekke, Stanford plan
ner and architect. "Although they
may not live right along Junipero
Serra Boulevard they certainly
travel and bicycle out there."
Consultant Steve Fitzsimons
said each day 160 cars travel 65
miles per hour on Junipero Serra,
almost twice the posted speed
limit of 35 miles per hour. He said
these statistics were shocking and
created a safety hazard. Addition
ally, 64 percent of accidents on Ju
nipero Serra are speed-related.
