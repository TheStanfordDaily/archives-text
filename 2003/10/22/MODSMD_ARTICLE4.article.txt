# Residents, commuters try to resolve traffic issues
## 
### MELISSA CHEE 
The wide-open stretch of Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard on the
south edge of campus may get a
facelift to slow down traffic.
On Sunday, community mem
bers devoted their afternoon to
brainstorming ideas for traffic
calming improvements on Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard between
Stanford Avenue and Campus
Drive East.
The defined goals were to re
duce speeding, improve safety
for bicyclists, pedestrians and
motorists while maintaining res
idential access to the road. The
agenda addressed high travel
speeds, accidents, project goals
and traffic calming plans for the
corridor.
The Santa Clara County
Roads and Airport Department
sponsored the public meeting at
Tresidder Memorial Union. Ma
soud Akbarzadeh, a county traffic
engineer, said pedestrian and bi
cycle use around the Dish area

has increased in the last 10 years.
He said the vicinity attracts vari
ous people like recreational jog
gers and walkers, and their safety
is important.
"Our previous attempts have
shown some reduction in the
speed, but not sufficiently so it's a
good environment for all the road
users," Akb.arzadeh said.
"Anything that is developed to
reduce speeding is going to be of
benefit to [students] too," said
Therese Brekke, Stanford plan
ner and architect. "Although they
may not live right along Junipero
Serra Boulevard they certainly
travel and bicycle out there."
Consultant Steve Fitzsimons
said each day 160 cars travel 65
miles per hour on Junipero Serra,
almost twice the posted speed
limit of 35 miles per hour. He said
these statistics were shocking and
created a safety hazard. Addition
ally, 64 percent of accidents on Ju
nipero Serra are speed-related.

Drivers navigate rush hour on Junipero Serra Boulevard. Commuters and community members met Sunday to diseuss
solutions for traffic congestion, speeding and safety issues on the road.
A multi-jurisdictional task force
wants to create a good design for
everyone. Akbarzadeh said the
transportation consultant CSC Plan
ning and Engineering was hired by
the county to look at previous stud
ies and come up with a plan for Ju
nipero Serra by working with the
community.
Residents dominated the meet
ing with concerns of speeding vehi

cles and pedestrian safety.
"I live near Junipero and lots of
people speed," said Margaret Jones.
"When my [mentally disabled]
daughter was a child we put up a
fence around the house, but I wor
ried if she got out of the gate because
anyone would just think she was a
pile of rags in the road."
Akbarzadeh said he hoped that
commuters would attend to share
their view and opinions and that the
meeting was advertised in local
newspapers and on street signs.
"I'm surprised we don't have any
one from the traveling public side at
the meeting," Akbarzadeh said. "I

was hoping we would get more feel
ings from the two sides."
Consultants plan to evaluate sug
gestions from the meeting and devel
op two preferred alternatives. A fol
low-up meeting will be held on Nov.
9 to provide participants with the op
portunity to review alternatives. A
presentation from consultants will
share the expected effectiveness of
the plan and build consensus on a
preferred traffic-calming plan to
turn into the county.
Traffic calming encompasses re
ducing vehicle speeding and improv
ing safety. The concept began in Eu
rope in the late 1960s when angry

Dutch residents fought cut-through
traffic by modifying streets to force
drivers to slow down. The concept
quickly spread to America and was
utilized in places like Berkeley,
Calif, and Seattle.
CSC Planning and Engineering
said that residents will need to rally
public support if their traffic calm
ing plan is to be implemented and
there needs to be a broad base of
public support for the project. Ak
barzadeh said the project has fund
ing to develop the preferred alter
natives, but after that more funding
will have to be secured to move for
ward.
