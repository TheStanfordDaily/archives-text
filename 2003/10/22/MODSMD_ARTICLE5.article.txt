# No big parties for Big Game
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
For the fourth year in a row, the
University will not allow any large
scale parties to be held on Big Game
Weekend.
The rule applies to any Level Four
parties that are open to non-Stanford
students and parties like Sigma Nu's
annual Moonsplash, which attracts
over 1,000 people every year.
"These really large events call for
extra security and we want to make
sure that we have the resources
available to support them in case
something goes wrong," said Joey
Greenwell, assistant director of stu
dent activities.
The only party affected by this rule
is Moonsplash, which had traditional
ly been held on Big Game weekend.
This year, the party will instead be
held on Nov. 15.
"While we would like to be able to
have our party on the weekend of Big
Game, we understand the concerns
of the administration," said Sigma
Nu's president, senior Zach Gerson.
"Moonsplash is such a successful
event that it does not suffer very
much from being moved to an alter
native date."
Gerson also said he understands
the University's reasoning behind
this rule.
"Although the energy and excite
ment surrounding Big Game in
many ways makes it an ideal time for
a large social event, we understand
that that same excitement can make
for a potentially more difficult and
even dangerous situation," he said.
Greenwell also emphasized that
the University has no issues with
other, smaller-scale parties taking
place on Big Game Weekend.
"We, as the University, support
parties," Greenwell said. "We just
want to ensure the health and safety of
students and the party hosts."
