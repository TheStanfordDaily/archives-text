## Let's pretend we're all bunny rabbits 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
"It kind of feels like having sex in a trash bag." The young man sitting
on the cream-colored loveseat gingerly extended what looked like a Mc-
Donald's super-sized version of a Glad sandwich baggie. "Anyone know
what this is? It's a female condom."
Silence.
The couple dozen students ringed around him on couches in the Casa
Zapata basement yesterday evening kept their eyes fixed on the speaker.
Like a magician of erotica, Sexual Health Peer Resource Center Co-Di
rector James Poole, a junior, resumed rummaging in his shiny red-and
black bag filled with contraceptives. The atmosphere at the sex talk, ar
ranged by the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, felt vaguely tense, as if we
were all privy to a delicate chemistry experiment.
Come to think of it, that's what sex is, when you get down (oh yeah)
to it a delicate chemistry experiment. In our society, where "Obey
your thirst" is a soda-jerk's platitude, "Indulgence" is a cookie brand and
"the pursuit of happiness" was built into the Bill of Rights, sex is all too
often seen as merely another avenue of gimme-gimme fun. In other
words: Your body is a wonderland and I'm gonna buy me a season pass.
"Sex gets rid of stress much faster than an evening of shared feelings
with someone who cares about us," said Stanford student who preferred
that her name not be used. "And sex burns calories, while all them din
ners, movie popcorn, and chocolates on Valentine's
Day just make you fatter!" Hold on, wait a minute.
Shouldn't hanging out with your girl or boy be just as
good of a de-stresser?
If you knew how I long
For you now that you're gone
You'd grow wings and fly
Home to me
"Is 'safe sex' an oxymoron?" one of the coordinators
of the sex tete-a-tete asked. No matter how reliable
contraceptives have become in the past few decades,
one thing hasn't changed a bit: sex messed with the
head of Tennyson's pining-away Mariana, and it just might mess with
yours.
"Our roles as sexual health counselors [is] 'to prevent [diseases] when
possible, to heal when needed, and to empower always,"' Poole told me
after the meeting. "We just want people to be safe and have fun."
If only the same approach were taken with the emotional component
of sex.
"There should be a recognized place for people to say 'Look, this is
what I want from you, I'm not shady or nasty, I just think that you are cute
enough and I want for us to satisfy this need for each other, and this need
alone,' " said one female student who preferred not to be identified.
If only it were that easy a straightforward (ladies' and) gentlemen's
agreement. But sex isn't a transaction it's not just what some people
at the meeting jokingly called, "You'll scratch my back, I'll scratch
yours." Way back in the day (we're talking 1688), Aphra Behn was right
when she described how bedroom jaunts can occupy your waking
thoughts more than you'd like:
Oh! mischievous usurper of my peace;
Oh! soft intruder on my solitude
Behn, "On Desire"
While there are products galore out there to enhance physical plea
sure (Astroglide, anyone?), there are precious few aids helping people to
deal with the emotional aftermath of sex. What the world needs now,
more than a better brand of lube, is the invention of an emotional pro
phylactic.
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Let's do it all day long
Let abbots, Babbitts and Cabots
Say Mother Nature's wrong
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a "prophylactic" as something
that "defends from or tends to prevent disease; also preservative, pre
cautionary." The failure rate of the emotional "barrier methods" people
delude themselves into using is higher than that of the lambswool con
dom.
Meanwhile, back at the fireside chat: Poole pulled out a giant dildo,
which he called the "crystal pistol."
"Lots of people are trying to buy these when they see these at the
SHPRC," Poole said, "even though they're kind of expensive."
With the economy the way it is these days, it's interesting that people
can afford to be that cavalier about dildo prices (often the same people
whining about shelling out for Wilbur sushi). But it's often the case that
people are even more cavalier now about the emotional costs of sex.
"What is no strings?" asked one female student who demurred from
being identified. "If someone from your dorm is nice enough to lend you
a chair when you need it, there is some implicit social commitment there.
No big deal, but they might feel like you have slighted them if you walk
past them in the dining hall after that and don't acknowledge them.
There is no such thing as no strings, but [more] understanding would per
haps ease some of the chafing."
I'm not sure about this whole chair analogy. People don't go to thera
py about that.
And when we've had a coup la beets
We'll put on bunny suits
I long to nibble your ears
And do as bunnies do
As we've grown up with a tolerant, "I'm okay, you're ok" attitude that
can verge on the permissive, most students I talked to seemed to think
that prescribing caution with sexual behavior was tantamount to judging
others' lifestyles.
"Being sexually active in college is generally considered a bit more
risky than being sexually active in a monogamous, marital relationship,
but if that is something that someone thinks he / she is ready for, then that
is their prerogative," said sophomore Daniel Stringer, who attended the
sex talk.
"Someone who has chosen such a lifestyle has to accept some emo
tional and physical risks, but certain things can be done to minimize those
risks," he continued.
Paradoxically, some people I talked with said that one-night stands,
which seem to often the source of "regretted sex" for students our age,
cause less emotional havoc than does sex with someone you really care
about.
"If it's a guy that you're really close to, then you're probably not going
to be able to get away with the one-night stand thing, unless you know
each other really well and both know you dig casual," said junior Celina
Herrera.
"If it's a casual acquaintance that you don't see on a regular basis and
has no real attachments to any of your friends, then there shouldn't be
any harm. In these cases, emotionally, safe sex is possible. Just make sure
he doesn't have a girlfriend," she said.
It may be possible. But you're smarter than that.
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Until we pass away
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Until we pass away
Now go do it like they do on the self-discovery channel. No, it's not
what you think. Mull it over.

"What is no strings?" asked one female student who demurred from
being identified. "If someone from your dorm is nice enough to lend you
a chair when you need it, there is some implicit social commitment there.
No big deal, but they might feel like you have slighted them if you walk
past them in the dining hall after that and don't acknowledge them.
There is no such thing as no strings, but [more] understanding would per
haps ease some of the chafing."
I'm not sure about this whole chair analogy. People don't go to thera
py about that.
And when we've had a coup la beets
We'll put on bunny suits
I long to nibble your ears
And do as bunnies do
As we've grown up with a tolerant, "I'm okay, you're ok" attitude that
can verge on the permissive, most students I talked to seemed to think
that prescribing caution with sexual behavior was tantamount to judging
others' lifestyles.
"Being sexually active in college is generally considered a bit more
risky than being sexually active in a monogamous, marital relationship,
but if that is something that someone thinks he / she is ready for, then that
is their prerogative," said sophomore Daniel Stringer, who attended the
sex talk.
"Someone who has chosen such a lifestyle has to accept some emo
tional and physical risks, but certain things can be done to minimize those
risks," he continued.
Paradoxically, some people I talked with said that one-night stands,
which seem to often the source of "regretted sex" for students our age,
cause less emotional havoc than does sex with someone you really care
about.
"If it's a guy that you're really close to, then you're probably not going
to be able to get away with the one-night stand thing, unless you know
each other really well and both know you dig casual," said junior Celina
Herrera.
"If it's a casual acquaintance that you don't see on a regular basis and
has no real attachments to any of your friends, then there shouldn't be
any harm. In these cases, emotionally, safe sex is possible. Just make sure
he doesn't have a girlfriend," she said.
It may be possible. But you're smarter than that.
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Until we pass away
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Until we pass away
Now go do it like they do on the self-discovery channel. No, it's not
what you think. Mull it over.

"It kind of feels like having sex in a trash bag." The young man sitting
on the cream-colored loveseat gingerly extended what looked like a Mc-
Donald's super-sized version of a Glad sandwich baggie. "Anyone know
what this is? It's a female condom."
Silence.
The couple dozen students ringed around him on couches in the Casa
Zapata basement yesterday evening kept their eyes fixed on the speaker.
Like a magician of erotica, Sexual Health Peer Resource Center Co-Di
rector James Poole, a junior, resumed rummaging in his shiny red-and
black bag filled with contraceptives. The atmosphere at the sex talk, ar
ranged by the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, felt vaguely tense, as if we
were all privy to a delicate chemistry experiment.
Come to think of it, that's what sex is, when you get down (oh yeah)
to it a delicate chemistry experiment. In our society, where "Obey
your thirst" is a soda-jerk's platitude, "Indulgence" is a cookie brand and
"the pursuit of happiness" was built into the Bill of Rights, sex is all too
often seen as merely another avenue of gimme-gimme fun. In other
words: Your body is a wonderland and I'm gonna buy me a season pass.
"Sex gets rid of stress much faster than an evening of shared feelings
with someone who cares about us," said Stanford student who preferred
that her name not be used. "And sex burns calories, while all them din
ners, movie popcorn, and chocolates on Valentine's
Day just make you fatter!" Hold on, wait a minute.
Shouldn't hanging out with your girl or boy be just as
good of a de-stresser?
If you knew how I long
For you now that you're gone
You'd grow wings and fly
Home to me
"Is 'safe sex' an oxymoron?" one of the coordinators
of the sex tete-a-tete asked. No matter how reliable
contraceptives have become in the past few decades,
one thing hasn't changed a bit: sex messed with the
head of Tennyson's pining-away Mariana, and it just might mess with
yours.
"Our roles as sexual health counselors [is] 'to prevent [diseases] when
possible, to heal when needed, and to empower always,"' Poole told me
after the meeting. "We just want people to be safe and have fun."
If only the same approach were taken with the emotional component
of sex.
"There should be a recognized place for people to say 'Look, this is
what I want from you, I'm not shady or nasty, I just think that you are cute
enough and I want for us to satisfy this need for each other, and this need
alone,' " said one female student who preferred not to be identified.
If only it were that easy a straightforward (ladies' and) gentlemen's
agreement. But sex isn't a transaction it's not just what some people
at the meeting jokingly called, "You'll scratch my back, I'll scratch
yours." Way back in the day (we're talking 1688), Aphra Behn was right
when she described how bedroom jaunts can occupy your waking
thoughts more than you'd like:
Oh! mischievous usurper of my peace;
Oh! soft intruder on my solitude
Behn, "On Desire"
While there are products galore out there to enhance physical plea
sure (Astroglide, anyone?), there are precious few aids helping people to
deal with the emotional aftermath of sex. What the world needs now,
more than a better brand of lube, is the invention of an emotional pro
phylactic.
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits
Let's do it all day long
Let abbots, Babbitts and Cabots
Say Mother Nature's wrong
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a "prophylactic" as something
that "defends from or tends to prevent disease; also preservative, pre
cautionary." The failure rate of the emotional "barrier methods" people
delude themselves into using is higher than that of the lambswool con
dom.
Meanwhile, back at the fireside chat: Poole pulled out a giant dildo,
which he called the "crystal pistol."
"Lots of people are trying to buy these when they see these at the
SHPRC," Poole said, "even though they're kind of expensive."
With the economy the way it is these days, it's interesting that people
can afford to be that cavalier about dildo prices (often the same people
whining about shelling out for Wilbur sushi). But it's often the case that
people are even more cavalier now about the emotional costs of sex.
