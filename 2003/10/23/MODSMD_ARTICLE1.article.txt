# Urban Studies shows increased enrollment

When School of Education Lecturer Frederic Stout began teach
ing Introduction to Urban Studies, it was an intimate, discussion
based class, with a couple dozen students. But over the past four years,
enrollment in the class has nearly doubled, paralleling a growing in
terest in the urban studies program for undergraduates.
Enrollment in Introduction to Urban Studies has increased to 97
students from 55 students in 2000, according to University Registrar
Roger Printup. Those figures indicate a growing interest in the urban
studies program as a whole, spurred on by the introduction of new ini
tiatives such an urban education track.
The increased appeal of the program has had the most obvious
effect on the Introduction to Urban Studies class, one of the core
requirements for the major. The surprising swell in numbers has
forced a complete transformation of the introductory course.
"I was frankly taken aback by the size of this year's intro class,"
Stout said. "My goal as a teacher is always to establish an individual
relationship with each of my students, but with 99 students, it's a little
daunting, to say the least."
"The major looks at urban society from many different perspec
tives: historical, physical, environmental, social, economic and politi
cal," said Colleen Scott, the department's administrator.
According to Assistant Director Michael Kahan, the urban stud
ies curriculum was initiated by student activists in the 19705, but the
program was only established as a degree-granting major in 1985.
Since 1992, the number of degrees has increased from 13 to 33 and
the number of declared majors in fall quarter has increased from 24
to 50.
The wide scope of the program has filled a deficit for many stu
dents in allowing them to pursue topics that are not addressed in other
departments. One of the major's attractions is its five highly specific
tracks: architecture and urban design, urban planning, community or
ganization and an option to design one's own track. A track in urban
education is the newest addition to the program's offerings.
"Stanford doesn't offer an architecture major," said sophomore
Laura Surma, "so I chose to combine this program with minors in civil
and environmental engineering and studio art."
Similarly, the new urban education track will help fill a gap in Stan
ford undergraduate degree offerings.
Despite the fact that Stanford is home to a top education school, it
has never offered an undergraduate major in education, Stout point
ed out.
"The urban education track will be a bold new way of preparing
