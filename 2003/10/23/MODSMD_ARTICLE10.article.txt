## Tuition bill would hurt students 
### 
For students and parents, annual in
creases in college tuition may seem
exorbitant. Yet there is a tacit under
standing that such hikes are a neces
sary evil to keep universities running so they
can offer quality education. Normally, uni
versities raise tuition with great care, taking
into account both what absolutely has to re
ceive more funding through higher bills and
what students can truly afford to pay.
One California congressman has proposed
legislation that would take this all-important
decision away from universities, and put the
power in the hands of the government. Re
publican Rep. Howard P. McKeon is pushing
a bill that would penalize public and private
universities for raising their tuition more
than twice the rate of inflation for three con
secutive years. McKeon claims excessive in
creases in tuition are pushing up to two mil
lion low-income students out of the class
room. The remedy he proposes would mean
that the federal government could take away
funding from schools that Violate the pro
posed norms.
The most alarming part of this bill is that it
would hurt the same students McKeon says it
would help. By taking away federal funding
that would go to student workers, supply
scholarship funds and finance low-interest
loans, those students most in need of assis
tance to attend school would see a primary
source of aid disappear.
Stanford's rightly opposes the legislation.
According to Provost John Etchemendy,
Stanford offers need-blind admissions so
low-income students on financial aid are un
affected by tuition hikes. Stanford calculates
what students can afford and fills in the rest
with a financial aid package, he said. But

under McKeon's tuition penalty bill, some of
the funds that constitute a part of that pack
age would be withheld, leaving the Universi
ty in a bind.
Last year, Stanford's tuition went up 5 per
cent. Since September 2002, inflation has
risen 2.3 percent, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. But Etchemendy says infla
tion is not the key factor in determining tu
ition increases, and that some of Stanford's
expenses run counter to inflation. This fact
makes McKeon's bill even more inappropri
ate because it links two variables inflation
and tuition that aren't related in practice.
In fact, Stanford's financial aid budget has
increased far beyond inflation since 2000, and
because Stanford tuition pays only 58 percent
of the cost of undergraduate education, even
students paying full tuition are actually re
ceiving a 42 percent subsidized "scholarship,"
Etchemendy said.
If passed, McKeon's "tuition indexing" bill
would set a dangerous precedent for univer
sities across the nation. It would effectively
erase universities' autonomy in making the
decisions that are best for the students, facul
ty and staff and force price controls on tuition
even at public universities. Such a blanket
policy would arbitrarily impose penalties on
schools without taking into consideration
their individual situations and needs.
McKeon's bill would have grave conse
quences, even if unintended, for students at
universities everywhere, and it would create
a system of scare tactics, not a system of ac
countability. If McKeon truly wants to help
low-income students, he will focus Lis efforts
on increasing federal financial aid instead of
trying to take it away from those who need it
the most.
