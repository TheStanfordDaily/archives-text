# American Studies a work in progress

After almost a decade of concern about
the structure of the program in Ameri
can Studies, English Prof. Shelley Fisher
Fishkin, the program's new director, and
the affiliated faculty are making moves to turn the
program's future around.
The Faculty Senate and the Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences have long emphasized that the
program has lacked intellectual focus, has not
provided a solid introductory sequence of classes
for students and has lacked a "capstone" experi
ence for graduating seniors. The program has ad
dressed all of these problems, and students
declaring majors in American Studies from now
on will be required to complete a three-course
core in history, a three-course core in literature
and arts, and one course in the area of compara
tive race and ethnicity. We commend the pro
gram's faculty and new director for taking the rec
ommendations of the Dean's office and of the
Faculty Senate seriously, and revising the pro
gram to better serve students.
But the restructuring of American Studies is not
over. Last spring, the Steering Committee of the

Faculty Senate renewed the program for two years.
This means that in the next few months, the pro
gram and the Dean's office must start the process
of gathering data to document the program's suc
cesses and failures.
We hope that the American Studies program
will follow the example set by the Center for Latin
American Studies in cooperating closely with the
Dean's office throughout the evaluation process.
The periodic review of Interdisciplinary Programs
is not designed to shut down these centers of intel
lectual vitality down, but rather, to take stock of the
programs' current state and build a stronger future
for the involved students and faculty.
American Studies has come a long way in the
last three years, when it was brought to the Faculty
Senate as a program in trouble. But work remains
to be done before this program can again be recer
tified on a solid footing. We hope that the program
in American Studies will not only look to establish
internal processes to better itself, but that it also
works in close consultation with the Dean's office
to ensure that it is offering the best possible pro
gram to its students.
