Column doesn't consider
accountability of public figures
In Kathryn Wallace's column
"Politicians can gab their guts out"
(Oct. 22), she contends that Army
Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin was
exercising his free speech rights
when he made comments that
Muslims do not worship a "real
god," among others. While he is
entitled to express his views as a
private citizen, he must be held ac
countable for his words as an ap
pointed representative of the Unit
ed States government.
By wearing his uniform while ap
pearing before congregations in the
United States and making com
ments like the one above, Boykin
sought explicitly to convey his offi
cial role. As such, his critics are more
than justified to say that he must step
down immediately.
Freedom of speech does not ex
tend to Boykin in this case because
he is not speaking as a private citi
zen; rather his words have the insti
tutional force of the strongest mili
tary in the world, a claim that no
mere citizen could ever make. And
for the people living under Ameri
can military jurisdiction in
Afghanistan and Iraq, his words are
doubly pernicious.
The headline of the column is
misleading as well. General Boykin
is not a politician; he is an appointed
military officer not accountable to
voters for his power. Considering
this, political pressure for his re
moval is our only way of holding him
accountable.
Outside of any arguments that
the author might call "politically cor
rect," like tolerance for other reli
gions or separation between church
and state, lets just think for a minute
about how this affects his job, evi
dently the only standard the author
would have us hold him to.
In national security terms,
Boykin's role as undersecretary of
defense for intelligence makes him
responsible for investigating and
capturing suspected terrorists. How
effectively can he do this when the
very nations he must collaborate
with believe that America is fighting
a holy war against their very right to
practice their religion, a sentiment
that Boykin reinforces?
Immediately after Bush criticized
Prime Minister Mahathir Moham
mad of Malaysia for making anti-
Semitic remarks on Tuesday, the
Prime Minister cited Boykin's com
ments in his defense. This is embar
rassing, and certainly does nothing
to serve our interests overseas.
Finally, considering the precari
ous position of America in public
opinion throughout the world and
the necessity for multi-lateral collab
oration in national security, Bush
has repeatedly said that the United
States is not fighting a holy war.
Boykin's comments as an American
military officer undermine this.
Do we have to wait for an exam
ple of his failure before we can re
move him for not doing his job effec
tively?
The comparison Wallace makes
between Boykin on the one hand

and Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Rush Limbaugh on the other is
disingenuous. Boykin is a represen
tative of the state, whereas Arnold
was an 18-year-old when he said he
admired certain things about Hitler
and Rush is a political commentator.
Neither can make any claim to rep
resent the United States or anything
other than a private citizen express
ing their views. How different would
our reaction be if either Arnold said
this now as governor, or if Rush was,
say, Trent Lott?
Also, Winston Churchill was not
elected Prime Minister until 1940,
and two of the comments cited were
made during the time when he could
have been considered to be a pundit
and journalist.
However, the 1919 and 1920
quotes about the use of gas and
Zionism deserve some discussion.
Had these comments been debated
and criticized at the time, maybe we
would have had a better sense of the
land-grabbing colonial mentality be
hind the Versailles treaty that led us
directly to another war. Perhaps we
should ask India, Pakistan, South
Africa, Ireland or Jamaica, just to
name a few, how they felt about their
Secretary of State for the Colonies,
which Churchill was at this time?
Churchill, despite his heroic ef
forts in war, more than proves the
importance of taking leaders to task
for their words when they underlie
the execution of their official duties.

Chubb Op-Ed was one-sided
Your op-ed piece by John Chubb
("Five Forgotten Schools," Oct. 21)
presents one view of the New York
City public schools. I am a long time
New York City resident and con
sumer (through my kids) of the City's
public school system with different
views. Chief Education Officer for
Edison Schools, Chubb recounts with
regret the events that led to rejection
of an Edison takeover of five New
York City schools by votes of the par
ents of the schools' children. While it
is true that the teachers' union cam
paigned against Edison, the parents
were adequately (to put it mildly) ex
posed to Edison's point of view, both
by Edison directly, and by school of
ficials. It is not likely that the parents
chose a worse school system for their
children to benefit the teachers'
union. Factors weighing against Edi
son included distrust of an outside for
profit company with a history of fi
nancial irregularities.
Chubb also lauds the new chan
cellor of the New York City Public
Schools, Joel Klein, and hopes that
Klein will revisit the Edison deci
sion. I agree with Chubb that Klein is
even less influenced by parent opin
ion and advice from outside his small
inner circle than his predecessors.
However, Hoover Institution Fel
low Chubb may have misjudged
Klein. Other Hoover people have
railed against whole language read
ing and fuzzy math programs, but
Klein is busily forcing these radical

discredited programs upon the New
York Public School system. The only
beneficiaries of the Bloomberg /
Klein "reforms" seem to be the ed
school buzzards who have flown in
to over to oversee the process.

MEChA should denounce motto
I think Stanford MEChA faces a
significant challenge to its claims
that it is different from the Ku Klux
Klan if it associates itself by name
with a motto "for the race, every
thing. For those outside the race,
nothing."
In all of this debate, I have not
heard any officer of Stanford
MEChA stand up and both de
nounce this motto and state that he
will not support other MEChA
chapters who refuse to do the same.
I think many are willing to give
MEChA the benefits of the doubt,
for now. But Stanford MEChA does
not appear to have done enough to
clarify its position in this debate.
Saying "we are not racist" while as
cribing to an organization with a
racist motto is double-talk. If Stan
ford MEChA truly opposes racism,
it should do so no matter what form
that racism takes. Stand up for your
beliefs, whatever they may be.

Feature article on KZSU
hits a nerve
Your recent article about KZSU
("Resisting the Farm's Transistor,"
Oct. 22) is ridiculous and inflamma
tory. I am a DJ at KZSU and know
that the station operates on a very
tight budget. We depend almost ex
clusively on the ASSU special fees
to continue to operate. Suggesting
that our budget is disproportionate
ly large does nothing but damage
our ability to promote free-form
radio and truly free media expres
sion. As a newspaper yourself, you
should know that.
With no measurement other than
a couple of uninformed opinions, it
is absurd that the article claim that
KZSU has a small listenership.

Column doesn't consider
accountability of public figures
In Kathryn Wallace's column
"Politicians can gab their guts out"
(Oct. 22), she contends that Army
Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin was
exercising his free speech rights
when he made comments that
Muslims do not worship a "real
god," among others. While he is
entitled to express his views as a
private citizen, he must be held ac
countable for his words as an ap
pointed representative of the Unit
ed States government.
By wearing his uniform while ap
pearing before congregations in the
United States and making com
ments like the one above, Boykin
sought explicitly to convey his offi
cial role. As such, his critics are more
than justified to say that he must step
down immediately.
Freedom of speech does not ex
tend to Boykin in this case because
he is not speaking as a private citi
zen; rather his words have the insti
tutional force of the strongest mili
tary in the world, a claim that no
mere citizen could ever make. And
for the people living under Ameri
can military jurisdiction in
Afghanistan and Iraq, his words are
doubly pernicious.
The headline of the column is
misleading as well. General Boykin
is not a politician; he is an appointed
military officer not accountable to
voters for his power. Considering
this, political pressure for his re
moval is our only way of holding him
accountable.
Outside of any arguments that
the author might call "politically cor
rect," like tolerance for other reli
gions or separation between church
and state, lets just think for a minute
about how this affects his job, evi
dently the only standard the author
would have us hold him to.
In national security terms,
Boykin's role as undersecretary of
defense for intelligence makes him
responsible for investigating and
capturing suspected terrorists. How
effectively can he do this when the
very nations he must collaborate
with believe that America is fighting
a holy war against their very right to
practice their religion, a sentiment
that Boykin reinforces?
Immediately after Bush criticized
Prime Minister Mahathir Moham
mad of Malaysia for making anti-
Semitic remarks on Tuesday, the
Prime Minister cited Boykin's com
ments in his defense. This is embar
rassing, and certainly does nothing
to serve our interests overseas.
Finally, considering the precari
ous position of America in public
opinion throughout the world and
the necessity for multi-lateral collab
oration in national security, Bush
has repeatedly said that the United
States is not fighting a holy war.
Boykin's comments as an American
military officer undermine this.
Do we have to wait for an exam
ple of his failure before we can re
move him for not doing his job effec
tively?
The comparison Wallace makes
between Boykin on the one hand

and Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Rush Limbaugh on the other is
disingenuous. Boykin is a represen
tative of the state, whereas Arnold
was an 18-year-old when he said he
admired certain things about Hitler
and Rush is a political commentator.
Neither can make any claim to rep
resent the United States or anything
other than a private citizen express
ing their views. How different would
our reaction be if either Arnold said
this now as governor, or if Rush was,
say, Trent Lott?
Also, Winston Churchill was not
elected Prime Minister until 1940,
and two of the comments cited were
made during the time when he could
have been considered to be a pundit
and journalist.
However, the 1919 and 1920
quotes about the use of gas and
Zionism deserve some discussion.
Had these comments been debated
and criticized at the time, maybe we
would have had a better sense of the
land-grabbing colonial mentality be
hind the Versailles treaty that led us
directly to another war. Perhaps we
should ask India, Pakistan, South
Africa, Ireland or Jamaica, just to
name a few, how they felt about their
Secretary of State for the Colonies,
which Churchill was at this time?
Churchill, despite his heroic ef
forts in war, more than proves the
importance of taking leaders to task
for their words when they underlie
the execution of their official duties.

Chubb Op-Ed was one-sided
Your op-ed piece by John Chubb
("Five Forgotten Schools," Oct. 21)
presents one view of the New York
City public schools. I am a long time
New York City resident and con
sumer (through my kids) of the City's
public school system with different
views. Chief Education Officer for
Edison Schools, Chubb recounts with
regret the events that led to rejection
of an Edison takeover of five New
York City schools by votes of the par
ents of the schools' children. While it
is true that the teachers' union cam
paigned against Edison, the parents
were adequately (to put it mildly) ex
posed to Edison's point of view, both
by Edison directly, and by school of
ficials. It is not likely that the parents
chose a worse school system for their
children to benefit the teachers'
union. Factors weighing against Edi
son included distrust of an outside for
profit company with a history of fi
nancial irregularities.
Chubb also lauds the new chan
cellor of the New York City Public
Schools, Joel Klein, and hopes that
Klein will revisit the Edison deci
sion. I agree with Chubb that Klein is
even less influenced by parent opin
ion and advice from outside his small
inner circle than his predecessors.
However, Hoover Institution Fel
low Chubb may have misjudged
Klein. Other Hoover people have
railed against whole language read
ing and fuzzy math programs, but
Klein is busily forcing these radical

discredited programs upon the New
York Public School system. The only
beneficiaries of the Bloomberg /
Klein "reforms" seem to be the ed
school buzzards who have flown in
to over to oversee the process.
