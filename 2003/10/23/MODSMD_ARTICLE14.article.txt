# ORDER IN THE COURT?
## Baseball or bad sushi: take your pick 
### 
Let's say the revamped
Tresidder included a new
restaurant called "Sketchy
Sushi." They've got some
excellent California rolls, but they
can't always be trusted. So every time
you visit, there's a 55 percent chance
you'll have an excellent raw fish ex
perience. But the other 45 percent of
the time, you'll get seafood stomach
ache so bad it'll take you a week be
fore you can even bear to look at your
beloved goldfish Herb. How much
would you pay for the sushi? How
often do you think you'd go?
I'm guessing your answers were
"not much" and "never." That's cer
tainly the rational response. Hey,
we've all got better things to do than
eat raw fish of questionable quality.
Why, then, do our answers change
when the franchise changes its name
from "Sketchy Sushi" to the "San
Francisco Giants"? If the seaweed
wrap is traded for leather gloves and
the raw eel for oversized foam fin
gers, why do we suddenly rush to buy
tickets?
Make no mistake about it — your
favorite sports team is running the
same kind of shady operation as our
friends at Sketchy Sushi. Every time
you watch a game or attend in per-

son, you're playing
the lottery. If your
team wins, you
feel pretty good
about life; if they
lose, you've just
wasted three
hours of your life
to ride an emo
tional roller coast
er that ends with a
deadly plunge.

Why pay good money to get pissed
off?
In fact, the sports franchise is
probably a worse buy than Sketchy
Sushi. Winning 55 percent of your
games is pretty darn good. When was
the last time the Cincinnati Bengals
yielded that level of customer satis
faction? Furthermore, watching a
losing sporting event can be worse
than a stomach ache. Take the Cubs
recent collapse in game six of the Na
tional League Championship Series,
a colossal swan dive blamed mainly
on one unlucky fan who got in the
way of a Cubs outfielder's play on a
fly ball. Think that guy's safe any
where in the Midwest?
When you consider your next sports
ticket purchase, be sure to factor in
the 0.00001 percent chance that you

end up as public enemy number one
of the entire Chicago-land area.
The oddest thing is that ticket
sales actually go up in the playoffs.
Why does this make any sense? The
opponents are better, the games are
closer, the stakes are higher
you're setting yourself up for some
major disappointment here. Woe
unto those unfortunate Raiders fans
who trekked all the way to last year's
Super Bowl only to see their team
blown out before they could even
make it back to their seats with their
first round of $l7 domestic beers.
What does it say about our society
when one of our major hobbies is a
communal form of fiscal and emo
tional masochism? We lambaste the
Romans for their brutal spectacles in
the Coliseum, but at least there the
Hon always won. Our pernicious self
inflicted trauma must end. Give up
sports fanaticism and find a more ful
filling, less anxious and depressing
form of entertainment. Don't forget:
At the ballet, everyone's a winner!
