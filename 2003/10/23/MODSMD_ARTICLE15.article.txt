## Stanford Store should stay open 
### KYLE ALISHARAN 
On Oct. 14, The Daily ran an ed
itorial calling for the Stanford Store
to be shut down. It claimed that the
storefront is losing money, citing
our 2002 tax returns. The editorial
further claimed that SSE was shirk
ing its financial responsibility to the
student body since these losses
were pulled directly from the ASSU
endowment.
The entity identified as the Stan
ford Store in the tax returns cited by
The Daily is and has been a collec
tion of several businesses the On
line Store, Flicks to go, the Stanford
Store Catalogue and the Stanford
Storefront. It's true that the overall
performance of this portfolio was
less than projected in the tough
economy of 2002. As a result, SSE
has already taken action to close the
unsuccessful subsidiaries. But the
storefront itself has been steadily
growing in revenues since its open
ing and has achieved profitability,
even in the economic downturn.
Closing the Stanford Store would re
sult in reduced income to SSE, and
ultimately, to the ASSU Endow
ment.
Furthermore, the Endowment
does not absorb individual business
losses, and the ASSU has not carried
any debt, now or in the past decade.
SSE's portfolio of campus business
es from the Stanford Store to
Sunday Flicks to the Stanford Direc
tory is designed to manage indi
vidual business risk. It has success
fully done so and has contributed to

the ASSU's financial position, even
through the market downturn.
If The Daily is interested in writ
ing editorials that champion the fi
nancial interests of the student body,
maybe the editorial staff should look
into The Daily's own books, and its
use of student special fees. A little
research shows that The Daily has
banked profits over many years in
the non-student-run Friends of The
Daily Foundation, yet in downturn
has chosen to increase their fees to
students, instead of funding their
losses out of savings.
According to http://www.dai
lyalumni.org, the Friends of The
Daily was founded in 1991 "to pro
tect [The Daily's] rights as an inde
pendent news gathering organiza
tion." This was accomplished by
using a portion of Daily revenue to
invest for future use and provide
scholarships for Daily alumni.
What isn't on the Web site is that
Daily revenue included special-fee
money even in years when The Daily
was profitable and that The Daily
continues to request special fees al
though the Friends of The Daily
asset pool has grown. For example,
in fiscal year 2002, The Daily record
ed revenue of $900,587 comprised of
$781,810 from advertising, $74,000
from subscriptions and $44,777 from
ASSU special fees. In that same
year, The Daily contributed $50,000
to Friends of The Daily. The next
year they requested $49,752 from
ASSU special fees.
Why is The Daily asking for
money from Stanford students when

they have a $1,000,000 asset pool in
Friends of The Daily that they not
only refuse to touch but are trying to
increase using ASSU Special Fee
money? Why did they ask for special
fees when they had enough money
to afford socking away $50,000 in
Friends of The Daily?
Unfortunately this is not an acci
dent or a one-time occurrence. It has
been going on for several years. In
the last special fees ballot, fiscal year
2004, The Daily requested and re
ceived $53,978.
What kind of journalists is The
Daily training if it has knowingly
misled and continues to mislead the
student body about its own fi
nances? Daily editorial staff, if
you're looking for financial misman
agement maybe you should look
closer to home.
We're not spiteful enough to sug
gest that The Daily should shut its
doors just because their editors irre
sponsibly ran a potentially damaging
editorial. We believe strongly in the
value of Stanford's student-run en
terprises like the Stanford Store and
The Daily, and want to see them suc
ceed.
With that in mind, we realize that
any publicity for the Stanford Store
can be good publicity. We welcome
the new customers this little letter
exchange will bring.
