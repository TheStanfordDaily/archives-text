# OUT OF AFRICA
## The 						thin line between love and hate 
### MEKLIT WORKNEH 
Last spring, I had a conversation about
popular international opinions of
Americans with a friend who is now
studying abroad in South Africa. She
said to me, "Meklit, I don't want peo
ple identifying me as American. I don't
want to be associated with all the bad
perceptions people have about Amer
ica and Americans." To avoid these
"bad" perceptions, she decided to put a
Canadian flag on her backpack and
identify herself as a Canadian
I could not disagree with her on
the idea that opinions of America
and Americans have changed
worldwide and people are not nec
essarily as welcoming as they might
have once been. However, I did not
agree that American is always neg
atively perceived. I know in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, where I'm from,
radio stations bump hip-hop, little
kids watch Teletubbies on TV, and
there is a general fascination
around American popular culture.
This is true of most urban centers
worldwide and Americans as a peo
ple tend to also be associated with
this popular culture that people ad
mire. So what is it that has changed
to make Americans feel hated
worldwide?
This summer, I became even
more interested in the topic when
I traveled to the Middle East for
the first time. When I landed in
Dubai in the United Arab Emi
rates, a tiny Gulf country, my first
observation was how westernized
it seemed. McDonald's, KFC,

Burger King and every sort of fast
food joint imaginable pervaded.
"Pirates of the Caribbean" and
"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"
were showing at the movies. Peo
ple listened to 50 Cent in the
bazaars and souks.
When I mentioned to people that
I went to school in the United
States, they would immediately get
excited and asked me all sorts of
questions. I did not encounter an en
vironment where negative percep
tions of Americans were prevalent.
So is this new idea of hatred towards
America and Americans a figment
of our imaginations?
Not necessarily.
Talking to friends at Stanford
who've been abroad gave me some
insights into the way Americans per
ceive their image abroad. I found
that a number of Stanford students
that go abroad do so apprehensively,
expecting criticism as Americans.
But they also found that they did not
necessarily receive the treatment
they expected. There is currently an
atmosphere of resentment that ex
ists around American foreign poli
cies. Just being home over the sum
mer, I found that people were vocal
with their criticisms of the war in
Iraq and of American policies else
where in the Middle East.
I knew these attitudes were popu
lar when I found them being ex
pressed by my grandmother who
neither reads newspapers nor watch
es television, and only sporadically
listens to the radio. When I asked her
where she heard of these issues, she

would say the information was relat
ed by her neighbors. However, when
I brought American friends home,
she was generally fascinated and im
pressed that they were in Ethiopia
and appreciated our country and cul
ture. Americans tend to internalize
the resentment people feel toward
their government and its policies and
associate it with resentment toward
the people and the country as a
whole.
The reason why the resentment
toward the United States exists is
because there is this discrepancy
between the ideals of democracy,
peace and justice it preaches, and
the actions it follows. People world
wide view the United States as hav
ing a double standard, especially in
developing nations. This then leads
to the rise in popular criticism of
American foreign policies. But
what Americans need to realize is
that this criticism is not usually
being directed at them on an indi
vidual basis.
So what did I tell my American
friend who wanted to be Canadian? I
said that there was no need to be
ashamed of who you are. There are a
lot of positive ideals coming out of the
United States. So yes, there is a thin
line between love and hate in this
case. But Americans can find ways to
develop this relationship positively
on the individual, as well as political,
level.
