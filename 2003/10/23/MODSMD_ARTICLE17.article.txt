## Disillusioned by football? Try reality TV 
### 
After a depressing weekend of watch
ing football, I'm liable to do just about
anything to get my mind off the work
I've put aside, and to keep my eyes
and ears away from the written and spoken re
minders of my favorite team's latest loss.
So after Stanford succumbed to Washington
State on Saturday and my beloved Redskins got
blown out on Sunday, I suppose that's why I ac
cepted a friend's invitation to a wine and cheese
party Monday night.
For the full dude-you've-got-to-be-kidding
me-effect, I should probably mention it was to
celebrate the season premiere of "The Next Joe
Millionaire" — and, oh yeah, there was a formal
dress code.
I realize I just lost the respect of several friends.
As I walked to the party, the following
thoughts crossed my mind, in no particular order:
Is my tie straight?
Does the Stanford coaching staff have to

start someone at quarterback
this Saturday at Oregon? Is
that some sort of rule?
What the heck am I doing in
formal wear, leaving the com
fort of my own couch to watch
some faux-millionaire drip
give a bunch of gold-digging
chicks the cruelest surprise of
their precious lives?
How did the Buffalo-

freakin'-Bills manhandle the Redskins?
Monday Night Football is on.
Did Travis-2.5-yards-per-carry-Henry really
rush for 167 yards and two touchdowns against
the 'Skins or was that a bad dream?
My final thought was of the scene in "Happy
Gilmore" where Shooter McGavin tells Happy
to dress nicely and meet him on the ninth green
at nine. Poor Happy arrives excitedly in a suit,
only to be soaked by the green's timer-con
trolled sprinklers.
Would I suffer a similar fate, arriving to
find a bunch of guys guzzling beer, watching
the game and laughing hysterically at the sight
of me because I fell for their sick, sick joke?
The greater part of my manhood actually
hoped so.
But this party was no farce. It was as real as
the student-bouncer at the door checking to
make sure I was on the VIP list. I scanned the
room for the "Entertainment Tonight" cam
eras as my friend poured me a glass of four
dollar wine aged to nine-month's perfection.
There was Brie and Gouda to go with gourmet
crackers. There were men in suits and women
in skirts.
As I took a seat, I pondered the absurdity of
the situation. It's hard to believe that little more
than 24 hours earlier I was sitting on a bar stool
at the Old Pro eating greasy, fried chicken wings
along with my football-watching brethren as
four different games unfolded on big screen TVs
around the room.
Getting back to Monday night, let me es
tablish one thing up front. Primarily because I
spend a large chunk of time watching sports, I
have never watched a reality series or sitcom
on a regular basis. Not "Seinfeld," not "The
Bachelor," not "Survivor" and, at the risk of
losing even more respect, I'll admit that I've
seen a grand total of two full episodes of "The
Simpsons."
That said, Monday night's premiere was one
of the funniest hours of television besides
"SNL" or "The Daily Show" I've seen in quite
some time. On the way home it crossed my mind
that if I spent half as much time watching trash
like "Joe Millionaire" as I currently do watching
sports, my faith in humanity would diminish, but
I'd also laugh more and stress less.
Allow me to illustrate:
Sunday's foreign flavor: Two middle-aged
French guys at my table are reveling in the
49er's surprising domination of Tampa Bay,
when, following yet another touchdown by the
Bills, one of them has the nerve to turn to me
and ask, "What happened to the 'Skins?" I
took six years of French in high school and
didn't learn the word for "imploded." Unbe
lievable.
Monday's foreign flavor: Fourteen Euro
pean girls, dropping classic lines like, "I'll live
on his ranch . . . and eat ranch dressing every
day."
Sunday's geography lesson: Buffalo is cold,
and the bike ride back to Mirrielees is farther
after a loss than after a win.
Monday's geography lesson: Attempting to
memorize the homelands of the women he is
about to meet, real American cowboy David
Smith asks, "So where's Dutch?" This after but
ler Paul Hogan informs him that the German
girls on the show are from Germany. Whoa
there, Paul!
Four pieces of cheese, a glass of wine and
lots of laughs later, I headed home. Nobody
left the party disappointed or with the urge to
smash things, which is more than I could say
on Sunday.
I even made it back in time to catch the excit
ing final minutes of the game, a heart-breaking
Oakland loss. Raiders fans can only imagine
how much less peeved they'd be if they had hud
dled up to "Joe Millionaire" instead.
The show has got this disgruntled football
fan's ringing endorsement — at least until col
lege basketball season begins.

Think you can convince Scott to watch "The
Simpsons" more often? E-mail him at
