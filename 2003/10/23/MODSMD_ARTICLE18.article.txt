# Card digs into Pac-10
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is the perfect time for reflection
for the No. 6 Stanford women's volley
ball team. After an intense weekend of
play which included a dramatic come
from-behind win over UCLA on Thurs
day and a tough loss to top-ranked
Southern California on Friday the
Cardinal is halfway through its Pacific 10
Conference schedule and is preparing
for its second round of play this weekend
in Washington.
The Cardinal (14-4,7-2 Pac-10) will
be facing No. 10 Washington (14-4, 5-
4 Pac-10) on Thursday and unranked
Washington State (7-12, .3-6 Pac-10)
on Friday. Stanford goes into the
matches with all-time records of 34-1
and 32-3 against the Huskies and
Cougars, respectively.
Entering the second half of confer
ence play will not be an easy feat, as the
Pac-10 has proven to be the most com
petitive conference in the NCAA with
five teams in the nation's top 10 No. 1
USC, No. 6 Stanford, No. 7 California,
No. 9 UCLA and No. 10 Washington.
Furthermore, the Pac-10 is 70-26 in non
conference matches.
Currently, USC stands alone in first
place, while Stanford and California are
tied for second with two losses apiece and
UCLA remains in third with three losses.
Head-to-head, the teams are very
tight as Stanford defeated UCLA,
UCLA defeated California and Califor
nia defeated Stanford though all
three have lost their respective matches
with USC.
The Cardinal's match against Wash
ington on Friday will be its fifth consecu
tive match against a ranked opponent. In
those matches, Stanford has gone 2-2, de
feating both UCLA and Pacific, but
dropping games to Cal and USC.
Washington and Washington State
are coming off their interstate matchup.
The Huskies completed a three-game
sweep of the Cougars for the first time
since 1997,30-26,30-26 and 31-29.

When Stanford faced the Washington
schools at home earlier in the season,
Stanford went 2-0, winning both matches
in three straight games.
Against the Huskies, Stanford won
a well-fought match in three games,
30-23,33-31, and 30-24 and while it was
a sweep, the match was certainly not a
blowout.
Overall, Washington is 2-4 this year
against ranked opponents, but it is only
3-2 in its last five matches.
In the match, Stanford sophomore
setter Katie Goldhahn led the team with
45 assists and both outside hitters and
middle blockers â€”junior Ogonna Nna
mani and freshman Kristin Richards and
seniors Jennifer Harvey and Sara
McGee all ended the game with dou
ble-digit kills.
Stanford faced Washington State in
its conference home opener in front of
1,900 fans and disposed of the Cougars
in only 85 minutes. Despite a strong
performance by Washington State,
the Cardinal won the match in three
games, by game scores of 30-28, 30-23
and 30-18.
In its two matches last weekend, Stan
ford had to play without senior middle
blocker Sara McGee, who was out with a
foot injury. The first time the Cardinal
faced the Washington schools, it had to
do it without senior setter Anna Robin
son, who was out with a wrist injury.
. This weekend in Pullman and Seattle,
however, the Cardinal should be back at
full strength and playing with a more ex
perienced rotation.
The Cardinal will be looking to
McGee and senior Jennifer Harvey to
continue to dominate at the net, as
Harvey is leading the conference in
blocks with 1.59 blocks per game, a
team-leading 23 solo blocks and a .399
hitting percentage.
Nnamani and Richards will be on the
outside and the leaders of the Cardinal
offense as they are leading the team with
5.29 and 3.10 kills per game, respectively.
Both games are set for 7 p.m. and can
be heard on KZSU, 90.1 FM.
