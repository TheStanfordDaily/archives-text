# QB spot passed to Lewis

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For now, the Stanford offense belongs to
Chris Lewis. Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens has named the fifth-year senior the
starting quarterback for Saturday's game at Ore
gon (4-3,1-2 Pacific 10 Conference).
Redshirt freshman Trent Edwards, who start
ed the last four games after replacing Lewis in
the season opener, did not practice yesterday.
He is nursing a shoulder injury he sustained in
the third quarter of Saturday's loss to No. 6
Washington State.
Lewis completed 9-of-22 passes for 95 yards,
one touchdown and one interception against the
Cougars in his first significant action since the
San Jose State game on Sept. 6.
"Chris did a good job in that game, and we
took a look at the tapes and assessed," Teevens
said of his decision to start Lewis. "I was pleased
with what he did. I was not displeased with what
Trent did, but I also had to factor in that his
shoulder was injured, and I made a decision
based on all the information I had."
Teevens did not rule out the possibility of
playing Edwards on Saturday if he is healthy, but
sophomore Kyle Matter has been Lewis's main
backup in practice so far this week.
"Could you see two quarterbacks? Yes, you
could," Teevens said. "Could you see three
quarterbacks? Yes, you could. But right now
Chris will be our starter on Saturday. He's excit
ed, and we're excited for him."
Lewis looked sharp in practice yesterday,
while Matter threw more errant passes but led
the offense down the field for a touchdown on
the last series of the afternoon.
Though Edwards's sprained shoulder kept
him on the sidelines yesterday, he said he in
tends to return to practice today.
"It's a lot better, and I'm taking some medi
cation that the doctors gave me. That should
help too," he said.
The redshirt freshman has completed 66-of
-139 passes this season, throwing four touch
downs and eight interceptions. His pass efficien
cy rating of 84.8 is nearly identical to Lewis's.
