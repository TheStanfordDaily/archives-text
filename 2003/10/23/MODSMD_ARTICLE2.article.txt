The Graduate Student Council hosted a presentation last night by
the Graduate Student Programming Board aimed at promoting
awareness of social events and opportunities for the graduate stu
dent community.
Highlighting the upcoming 20-spot lottery dinner featuring Ravi
Shankar on Oct. 25 and the annual grad student Halloween party on
Nov. 1, board co-coordinator Heather Farkas said her group tried
"to appeal [to graduate students] across the schools and bring every
one in."
The Board is not a part of the council, but the two groups often
work together to "foster greater interaction amongst the graduate
student community," according to Vicky Hwang, a board co-coordi
nator.
Most of the council's involvement centers around funding assis

sponsored by the council.
This year, the council has allocated $14,500 to the board's pro
grams in addition to what it already puts into its own annual events,
which include a Thanksgiving dinner at Tresidder and a Fourth of
July celebration.
The board's Halloween party is co-sponsored by Escondido Vil
lage residential education and the GSC. It is held at Rains' Hacien
da Commons, usually drawing a crowd of more than 500 people.
