# GSC to promote more social events
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council hosted a presentation last night by
the Graduate Student Programming Board aimed at promoting
awareness of social events and opportunities for the graduate stu
dent community.
Highlighting the upcoming 20-spot lottery dinner featuring Ravi
Shankar on Oct. 25 and the annual grad student Halloween party on
Nov. 1, board co-coordinator Heather Farkas said her group tried
"to appeal [to graduate students] across the schools and bring every
one in."
The Board is not a part of the council, but the two groups often
work together to "foster greater interaction amongst the graduate
student community," according to Vicky Hwang, a board co-coordi
nator.
Most of the council's involvement centers around funding assis
tance, since many events are heavily subsidized by the board and co
sponsored by the council.
This year, the council has allocated $14,500 to the board's pro
grams in addition to what it already puts into its own annual events,
which include a Thanksgiving dinner at Tresidder and a Fourth of
July celebration.
The board's Halloween party is co-sponsored by Escondido Vil
lage residential education and the GSC. It is held at Rains' Hacien
da Commons, usually drawing a crowd of more than 500 people.
Martin Widenbrant of the chemical engineering department, who
has attended the function in past
years, said that while it often con
flicts with other social gatherings
that weekend, students will still
make an appearance in costume.
Other events the board has put on
include Habitat for Humanity days,
wine tasting trips to Napa Valley,
karaoke nights and cooking classes,
according to the group's Web site.
With the financial support of stu
dents on the board, Moonlight on the
Bay last spring's boat dance on
San Francisco Bay cost students
only $lO to attend, just barely more
than the cost of the bus ride, accord
ing to Hwang.
Travis Hopp, the board's finan
cial officer, responded to the presen
tation by suggesting the council
would co-sponsor the board's fall

ball this year.
Other upcoming events that
Farkas brought up are a pumpkin
patch event in Escondido Village on
Saturday and next Wednesday's
movie night to see "A Little Night
Music" at Theaterworks.
Perhaps the board's most popular
production is the continuation of the
CoHo Happy Hour, which started up
again this week on Tuesdays from 7
to 9 p.m. The board hopes to entice
attendees with a free drink from the
Treehouse until the CoHo obtains its
new liquor license.
"At one point, we had 250 attend
in one night," recalled Hwang, re
flecting on the night's success last
year.
Last night, the council also hon
ored a guest presentation by William
McLennan, dean for religious life at
Stanford.
He covered the various programs
at Stanford that "provide leadership
for, and nurture," the spiritual, reli
gious and ethical lives of students of

all faiths and backgrounds.
McLennan highlighted opportu
nities like University Public Wor
ship, held at Memorial Church every
Sunday at 10 a.m. The childcare pro
vided during those services may ap
peal particularly to graduate stu
dents with children, he said.
"In many ways, graduate stu
dents feel isolated in their own dis
ciplines and areas of residence,"
McLennan said, and he sees this
isolation extending to religious life
as well.
Publicizing graduate student
news and activities remains a priority
for the GCS, the GSPB and the Of
fice of Religious Life alike.
"Grad students who live off
campus tend to get neglected be
cause they are not part of resi
dence-wide lists such as EV or
Rains," said Hwang. "We often get
people coming up to us and telling
us that they didn't hear of our past
events but would have loved to at
tend if they had."
