# Tennis hosts tourney

### MIA R. LEE 
Good hosts should never send their guests home
early.
But try telling that to No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis, the formidable hosts of the 2003 Omni Hotels ITA
Northwest Regional Championships.
Nine Cardinal players are lined up for the Oct. 24-27
showdown at Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Six of those
athletes have already received byes into the second
round.
The singles finalists and doubles champion at Region
als will qualify for the ITA National Intercollegiate In
door Championships at the University of Michigan on
Nov. 6-9.
Stanford's Erin Burdette leads the way as the top
seed for the second year in a row. The llth-ranked ju
nior is coming off a tough loss to California's Raquel
Kops-Jones in the final at the ITA All-American
Championships two weeks ago.
The outlook brightens for Burdette at Omni. Two
years ago, as a freshman, she clinched the title against for
mer teammate Gabriela Lastra, 6-1,4-6,6-3.
Not far behind Burdette stands Stanford's sixth
ranked sophomore Alice Barnes. Seeded fourth in the
tournament, Barnes made an impressive career debut at
Omni last year, dropping a final decision to Kops-Jones, 6-
7(4), 6-3,1-6.
"It was my first college tournament and I didn't really
know what to expect," Barnes said. "I just started playing
really well, had a few good wins, and suddenly I found
myself in the final."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood expects yet an
other solid Stanford showing at Regionals. However,
she tempers her confidence with knowledge that the
competition is ever-expanding.
"The level of play in our region has really gone up,"
Forood said. "It used to be that Pacific 10 Conference
schools dominated and there weren't too many other
players [out there]. Now we're really seeing more players
coming out of more schools, which will make this an even
playing field."
Among these up-and-coming players are second
seeded Chloe Carlotti, a freshman at Fresno State, as well
as ninth-seeded Anna Erikson and 12th-seeded Margari-
