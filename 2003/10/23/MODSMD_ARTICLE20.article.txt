# Tennis hosts tourney

### MIA R. LEE 
Good hosts should never send their guests home
early.
But try telling that to No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis, the formidable hosts of the 2003 Omni Hotels ITA
Northwest Regional Championships.
Nine Cardinal players are lined up for the Oct. 24-27
showdown at Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Six of those
athletes have already received byes into the second
round.
The singles finalists and doubles champion at Region
als will qualify for the ITA National Intercollegiate In
door Championships at the University of Michigan on
Nov. 6-9.
Stanford's Erin Burdette leads the way as the top
seed for the second year in a row. The llth-ranked ju
nior is coming off a tough loss to California's Raquel
Kops-Jones in the final at the ITA All-American
Championships two weeks ago.
The outlook brightens for Burdette at Omni. Two
years ago, as a freshman, she clinched the title against for
mer teammate Gabriela Lastra, 6-1,4-6,6-3.
Not far behind Burdette stands Stanford's sixth
ranked sophomore Alice Barnes. Seeded fourth in the
tournament, Barnes made an impressive career debut at
Omni last year, dropping a final decision to Kops-Jones, 6-
7(4), 6-3,1-6.
"It was my first college tournament and I didn't really
know what to expect," Barnes said. "I just started playing
really well, had a few good wins, and suddenly I found
myself in the final."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood expects yet an
other solid Stanford showing at Regionals. However,
she tempers her confidence with knowledge that the
competition is ever-expanding.
"The level of play in our region has really gone up,"
Forood said. "It used to be that Pacific 10 Conference
schools dominated and there weren't too many other
players [out there]. Now we're really seeing more players
coming out of more schools, which will make this an even
playing field."
Among these up-and-coming players are second
seeded Chloe Carlotti, a freshman at Fresno State, as well
as ninth-seeded Anna Erikson and 12th-seeded Margari-
ta Kaurnaukhova of Sacramento State.
In addition to mounting outside challenges, Stan
ford players face the unsettling possibility of competing
against their own teammates.
Last year, Barnes emerged victor, 6-2, 6-4, over sec
ond-seeded Cardinal Lauren Bamikow, a current se
nior, in the Omni quarterfinals.
"You're supposed to try and feel team-oriented,
even though it's the individual season," Barnes said.
"It's just unfortunate when you have to play each
other."
Barnes added, "[But] we were friends before the
match, and we were friends afterwards."
Barnikow is seeded fifth in the singles competition,
but is she also part of the Cardinal's plan to stir things up
in the doubles bracket. The top-seeded duo of
Barnikow and Burdette aim to improve their 2-1 season
record.
Burdette will have a chance to settle the score
with recent victor Kops-Jones. California's senior
freshman tandem of Kops-Jones and Sasha Podkolz
ina is second-seeded at Regionals.
Joining the veteran Cardinal team are two new
doubles pairs, Teresa Logar and Story Tweedie-
Yates, and Emilia Anderson and Anne Yelsey.
"Story and I work really well together," said Logar,
a freshman. "We've still got to get used to each other,
but I think the tournament's going to be good."
Yelsey, also a freshman, echoed these sentiments.
"Because [Stanford] had a really strong lineup last
year, they didn't really know where the freshmen were
going to fit in," said Yelsey. "I'm just glad they're letting
us play and giving me a shot."
Sophomores Joanna Kao and Jessica Leek will also
represent the Cardinal at Regionals.
Tournament action begins Friday morning at 8 a.m.
