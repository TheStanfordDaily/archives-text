After placing tenth overall and
sixth collegiately in the Head of the
Charles Regatta in Boston last Sat
urday, the women's varsity eight
will look to match its performance
at Saturday's Head of the Ameri
can race in Rancho Cordova, Calif.
"I am encouraged by their per
formance [last Saturday]," said
Stanford women's head coach
Aimee Baker. "They raced well
and finished within a second of last
year's national champion Harvard
and runner-up Michigan."
Last Saturday's race featured
three international eights and 10
collegiate boats that participated
in the 2003 NCAA regatta.
Noting the caliber of these op
ponents, Stanford's performance
was an indicator of the team's
physical strength early on in the
season.
"We proved that even with
some very significant losses from
our varsity boat last year we can
still hang with the top teams in the
country, all of whom have been
training for a month longer than we
have," said senior captain Melissa
Haury.
The Cardinal's race strategy for
this weekend will allow those who
raced in Boston to rest, while giv
ing the junior varsity eight the op
portunity to gain more experience.

The varsity eight will race in
smaller boats on Saturday in Ran
cho Cordova and the second boat
will hit the water for the first time
this season in the varsity eight com
petition.
Based on its success in recent per
formances, the Stanford squad feels
hopeful about the spring season.
"We've been doing some tough
training this fall, starting with our
preseason trip to Fallen Leaf Lake
and the team has handled the chal
lenges extremely well with a great
positive and competitive attitude,"
Haury said. "We get much stronger
everyday, physically and technical
ly on the water and the fast im
provements make me believe that
anything is possible for this
spring."
The women's lightweight team
will also be rowing on Saturday at
the Head of the American. The
team which is in its second year
of existence finished seventh at
the Head of the Charles.
Because the lightweight team
easily won the last season's Head
of the American, it-will race in the
openweight division this year.
"The goals for the Head of the
American are to race more aggres
sively in the first quarter of the race
and then see how many open
weight boats we can beat," said
Stanford lightweight coach A 1
Acosta.

Led by juniors Cady Kintner
and Kerin Lanyi, the lightweight
team expects to improve upon last
year's performances.
"This year, we have really
picked up where we left off and we
should be able to be quite a bit
faster than last year," Acosta said.
"The goals for this year are to raise
the level, volume and quality of
training, to be more competitive in
practice and to continue to culti
vate the positive culture and per
sonality of our team."
The men's varsity eight will race
at the Head of the American on
Saturday and at the Head of the
Estuary in Oakland on Sunday.
"[Sunday's] race will be a little
shorter by about four minutes but
the strategy will be the same," se
nior Shane Anderson said. "Push
hard the first third of the race, get
into a steady rhythm the second
third and treat the last third like a
2000 meter head race never set
tling, but always pushing hard to
create separation."
The team most recently raced
against Sacramento State and Ari
zona State at the Stanford
Boathouse on Oct. 11.
"Both varsity boats had at least
a 40 second margin of victory over
the Sacramento State boat and the
Arizona State boat,"' Anderson
said.
