# Campus water source changes

### EVA DEHLINGER 
The Stanford campus water supply quality is currently
less than ideal because of an annual maintenance check in
the infrastructure of the San Francisco Water Department,
which supplies the campus with its water, officials say.
The main difference in water quality is that it is be slight
ly more alkaline and mineral in taste.
"Most people don't even notice the difference," said
Marty Laporte, manager of water resources and environ
mental quality. "The water is safe to drink and continues to
be tested by both Stanford and the San Francisco Water De
partment."
Stanford water usually originates at the Hetch Hetchy
watershed in Yosemite National Park, which ordinarily
makes up 85 percent of campus water, according to Stan
ford's Annual Water Quality report. The rest of the water
comes from runoff collected on watersheds that are more
locally situated.
The water department will temporarily be changing how
much water comes from each source, and as a result, the
water quality will change.
Although the water remains safe, some of Stanford's
more sensitive water drinkers have reported being affected
by the taste.
"Last night I got a mug of water from the Adelfa Lounge,
and it started to burn on my tongue," freshman Dean Ki
tanidis said. "It was a little weird."
The initial source blend changes took place last week
and are expected to change again next week, when there
will be more use of local water supplies, as opposed to the
Hetch Hetchy reservoir, which will again be the main water
source in early spring.
This source blend change usually occurs every year, La
porte said.
Because there is less demand for water during the winter
and fall, the Water Department is doing work now on the
miles of piping that link the Sierras to its customers in the
San Francisco, Alameda and San Mateo counties. In order
to continue supplying water, there is a heavier dependence
on local water sources.
"This is pretty typical for this time of year," Laporte said.
Nevertheless, the Utilities Division sent notifications
around campus about the changes.
"We like to notify our costumers, so that no one gets
worried if they notice that the water tastes slightly differ
ent," Laporte said. Labs on campus were notified, as extra
filtering may be required for especially sensitive cases.
Many students already employ the use of handheld
water filters to ensure top quality in their water. Still others
chose to supply their own water by buying water bottles in
bulk, such as freshman Julia McKinney, who has stored 12
cases with 35 water bottles each. On the quality of water in
the dorms, McKinney explained, "I haven't noticed a dif
ference. I've always just tasted the chemicals."
Another change in campus water involves the use of dis
infectants. A switch from chlorine to chloramine will occur
in February 2004 to ensure compliance with stricter federal
and state water regulations.
