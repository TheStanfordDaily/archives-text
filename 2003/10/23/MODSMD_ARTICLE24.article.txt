# ASSU Senate votes to support FAIR
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate unanimously passed a bill Tues
day night encouraging the University
to join a nationwide lawsuit against
the Department of Defense's move
to cut federal funding from universi
ties that prohibit military recruiters.
The bill, debated extensively at
last week's Senate meeting, advo
cates that Stanford join the Forum
for Academic and Institutional
Rights (FAIR), a group of anony
mous academic institutions fighting
the Defense Department's deci
sion, saying that it is a violation of
the First Amendment.
The Stanford Law School has
previously prohibited the military
from recruiting on campus because
of the military's discriminatory
"don't ask, don't tell" policy on ho
mosexuality. Under the Defense
Department's interpretation of the
1994 Solomon Amendment, the
entire University can lose federal

funding because of the Law
School's decision not to allow mili
tary recruiting.
According to law students that ad
dressed the Senate last week, Stanford
stands to lose $430 million in funding,
although the University had not re
ceived a non-compliance letter from
the Defense Department as of last
week.
"That's more than any other in
stitution in America is facing," said
law student Luke Barefoot at last
week's meeting.
Groups in FAIR keep their
anonymity due to fears of govern
ment reprisal.
"A lot of universities are afraid to
bring this suit themselves because of
retaliation," said law student David
Kovick. "They're afraid that if they
bring this suit, they won't get fund
ing. To allow Stanford to sit on the
sidelines, it's sort of like not pulling
our own weight."
The law students will ask the
Graduate Student Council next
Wednesday to pass a similar bill.
