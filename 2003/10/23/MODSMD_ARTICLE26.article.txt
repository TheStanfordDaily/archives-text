## UCLA admissions criticized 
### CHARLES PROCTOR DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —The Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles turned away
over 1,000 students with high SAT scores in 2002
and admitted several hundred students with com
paratively low SAT scores that same year, ac
cording to a report compiled by the university
and released on Tuesday.
UCLA's report follows a similar one compiled
on the University of California at Berkeley ad
missions statistics that was reported on Oct. 4 by
The Los Angeles Times. The Berkeley report has
elicited a statewide debate about the transparen
cy and objectivity of university admissions prac
tices.
Although UCLA's admissions statistics for
2002 followed the same general trend as Berke
ley's, there were notable differences between the
two. ,
For example, although UCLA admitted fewer
students with SAT scores between 1500 and 1600
than did Berkeley, Berkeley also had twice as
many applicants with near-perfect scores.
Overall, UCLA admitted nearly five times as
many students with near-perfect scores as it de
nied, whereas Berkeley admitted twice as many
as it denied.
The fact that admissions statistics at the UC
system's two flagship campuses followed the
same trends could raise questions about UC ad
missions policies.
Some contend that Berkeley and perhaps
other UC campuses have admitted some ap
plicants based on factors other than their
achievement.
Regents Ward Connerly and John Moores,
who commissioned the Berkeley admissions re
port, have both suggested that Berkeley is using
comprehensive review to consider race in its ad
missions, a practice that is illegal in California.
UC officials deny that race plays a factor in the

university's admissions policy.
Neither the Berkeley nor the UCLA report
took race into account.
Comprehensive review is a system-wide poli
cy that dictates that admissions officers give
added weight to factors other than test scores,
such as an applicant's challenging life experi
ences.
Jeannie Oakes, a professor of education at
UCLA, says the university should not be so sur
prised if other campuses that implement compre
hensive review show the same admissions trends
as Berkeley.
"The goal of comprehensive review was to
provide admission to very worthy students who
have managed to succeed in spite of difficult cir
cumstances," she said. "And that seems to me
what has happened."
A university statement released in conjunc
tion with the report said UCLA's admissions pol
icy "is consistent with state, regental and faculty
policy."
The statement also said the university values
SAT I scores lower than it does other scores and
therefore weighs them less.
"Of the three major quantitative indicators of
academic preparation (GPA, SAT II scores, and
SAT I/ACT scores), SAT I scores are the least
predictive of first-year success at the UC's under
graduate campuses," the statement read.
UCLA's report was compiled at the behest of
The Los Angeles Times, which requested the in
formation after a confidential regents' report
found that UC Berkeley admitted several hun
dred students in 2002 with SAT scores between
600 to 1000 —far below the school's 1337 average
for that year. A 1600 is a perfect score on the
SAT.
Moores' report on Berkeley admissions
caused UC President Robert Dynes to say he
would convene a committee to review university
admissions policies at all eight undergraduate
campuses.
