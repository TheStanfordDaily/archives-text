# NYU considers measures to stop suicide

### BRADLEY HOPE WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK A top New York
University administrator Tuesday night told con
cerned students that the university is considering
several new outreach options, including adding a
fall break and a 24-hour health crisis hotline, in the
wake of three recent student deaths on campus.
Linda Mills, NYU vice provost for university
life and interdisciplinary initiatives, spoke to more
than 25 students at Lafayette residence hall in one
of several forums that administrators and individ
ual schools are holding to address the recent
tragedies and combat criticism that the university
has not taken enough public action in response.
"We are fully mobilized," Mills said, referring
to the high priority that officials have placed on

counseling and substance abuse issues in the after
math of the deaths.
Also Tuesday afternoon, Vice President for
Student Affairs Marc Wais sent an e-mail to stu
dents cautioning them against the tendency to turn
to drugs and alcohol in times of stress and pain.
A 19-year-old General Studies Program sopho
more fell to her death from the sixth-story window
of a non-NYU building on Saturday night, just one
week after a freshman jumped from the 10th floor
of Bobst Library. A junior jumped from the same
floor of the library on Sept. 12.
Speaking last night on her birthday, Mills dis
cussed why certain details of the deaths were not
released and also talked about new NYU initia
tives underway to support students. Mills, who is
heading a new committee charged with addressing
NYU's mental health needs, also received feed

back from the students on ideas for how the uni
versity can help students through times of trouble.
Students were eager to know details of the re
cent deaths.
"I don't like how my father knows more about
[the deaths] that I do, [just] because he's reading
the newspaper," sophomore Stephanie Hope said.
Administrators walk a fine line between re
specting the wishes of the families and the need to
communicate to students about the deaths, Mills
said.
The decision by administrators not to send out
an e-mail immediately after the first death was dri
ven "by mental-health concerns of the communi
ty," Mills said, explaining that experts advised the
administration against releasing information to
avoid the possibility of copy-cat suicides, among
other concerns.
