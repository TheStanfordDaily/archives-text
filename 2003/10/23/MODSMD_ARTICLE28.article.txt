# Baseball bat attack stuns Rutgers-New Brunswick
## 
### PATRICIA ALEX THE RECORD 
(KRT) BERGEN COUNTY,
N.J. Rutgers student Renee
Wymbs said she and four girl
friends got into a shoving match
around 3:30 a.m. Sunday with
seven drunken boys who taunt
ed them and exposed themselves as
the girls walked home from a birth
day party near the Rutgers New
Brunswick campus.
One of the girls called her
boyfriend to stay with them for pro
tection, Wymbs said. But he was in
a fight of his own at the Squam fra
ternity on College Avenue.
That brutal fight which left
two of the boyfriend's fraternity
brothers in critical condition with
head injuries and him with a bro
ken nose stunned the campus.
Eight students have been arrested
in connection with the baseball bat
attack on College Avenue a
broad thoroughfare of stately
homes and university buildings.
"It was just so malicious, and
so close to home," said Wymbs.
"This isn't something that should
happen ever, especially on a col
lege campus."
The attack and other recent
high-profile incidents the uni
versity president was mugged out
side a liquor store near campus and
an assailant in a two-year string of
sexual attacks in the city is still at
large have raised concerns
about safety at Rutgers.
"I don't tell my mom even what
happens to me because I'm scared
she won't let me go here," said
Wymbs. "We thought we were safe
walking home with five girls
that's a big group."
Joseph Catanese, police director
for New Brunswick, said "overall a
great deal of effort, expense, time
and energy" is put into making the
town and campus safe. But Catanese
acknowledged that drunken, rowdy
and lewd behavior by Rutgers stu
dents is a big problem.
"We have to devote so much
time to baby-sitting these youpg
adults, it's ridiculous," Catanese
said.
"Thursday, Friday and Satur
day nights it can become a zoo out
there," he said. "The people who
five in town year-round feel like

they're under siege, and there are
only so many officers and so much
time."
Several students expressed
fears about safety on campus but
others said Rutgers was much like
home: If you were vigilant and
avoided the rowdy party scene,
your odds of avoiding crime were
OK.
"I don't feel any less safe, but I
think if I was someone who went to
parties, that I would be a little more
cautious," said Melissa Hayes, a
student from Dumont, N. J.
"You're concerned, but they
have to grow up and you have to
trust their judgment," said Nancy
Palumbo of West Paterson, N.J.,
whose son Kevin is a freshman. "I
was very happy that he was at home
that weekend [of the Squam
fight]."
Rutgers Police Chief Barry
Roberson said police responded
quickly to the melee early Sunday
morning a sergeant was just a
block away when the call came in
and caught two of the alleged at
tackers red-handed.
Still, the chief allows that Rut
gers presents security challenges.
Nearly 42,000 people are on cam
pus every day and more than
14,000 students live there, making
it one of the largest residential cam
puses in the country.
Eleven women including
two students were sexually as
saulted in areas near the campus in
New Brunswick in the past two
years. An assailant has been identi
fied but not arrested. In response,
Rutgers police have augmented
city police.
Burglary, car theft and alcohol
related incidents keep Rutgers po
lice busiest, Roberson said. In 2002
68 burglaries were reported and 36
cars were stolen on campus, ac
cording to statistics provided by the
university. About 50 alcohol viola
tions and 40 drug incidents were re
ported.
"A lot of our problems are alco
hol-related," said Roberson.
"Thursday night is big."
Though most Rutgers students
interviewed said they felt safe on
campus and didn't worry about get
ting injured at parties, many said
small fights were a routine of
Greek life.
