# Book says founder poisoned

### TANIA ROJAS 
On the evening of Feb. 28,1905, Jane Stanford
asked her personal secretary for a glass of bicar
bonate soda. Into the night, servants heard her
agonizing cry: "I think I have been poisoned .. ."
Minutes later, Jane Stanford was pronounced
dead.
Whodunit?
That's the question posed by retired Stanford
physician Robert Cutler in his book, "The Myste
rious Death of Jane Stanford." The book has
piqued the attention of the national media with a
provocative claim: Contrary to the University's of
ficial story that Jane died of heart failure she
was actually poisoned in the Moana Hotel in
Hawaii, and her death was covered up by then-
University President David Starr Jordan.
"The 'Stanford community,' as you call it, has
been quick to say that all scrutiny is welcome,"
said Leora Romney, a Los Angeles Times re
porter who wrote a front-page feature on the
book's claim. "But at the same time, there is great
reluctance to acknowledge that Starr Jordan may
have had less than honorable motives. Cutler's re
search is solid. His scholarship has not been chal
lenged. So why not accept his conclusions? The
University insists on stopping short of that."
'Highly speculative'
The University says it has nothing to be
ashamed of.
"We believe Dr. Cutler has written an interest
ing and provocative account of the death of Jane
Stanford," said Gordon Earle, director of Univer
sity communications, pointing out that the book
was published by Stanford University Press and
featured in Stanford magazine, the University's
alumni publication.
In his book, Cutler details Jordan's cover-up of
Stanford's death, claiming that he perjured the
public by saying she had died of heart disease.
That story has been kept on official records ever
since. However, according to Cutler, Jordan knew
of the poisoning but denied it and even publicly
disparaged the doctors and coroner's jury who had
evidence she was murdered.
Earle rebuffed the possibility that Jordan cov

ered up Jane's death or, worse yet, was the mur
derer.
"Some have made the case that President Jor
dan was involved in a cover-up surrounding the
circumstances of Jane Stanford's death," he said.
"The University believes that this conclusion is
highly speculative and not supported by any solid
proof. And there is absolutely no evidence that
President Jordan was directly connected in any
way in Jane Stanford's death."
Earle said Jordan should be remembered by his
dedication to the school's academic standards.
"As a university, we strongly believe in the
value of scholarship," he said. "When you look at
the entirely of President Jordan's career at Stan
ford, it is clear that he was one of our finest presi
dents and that he made many positive contribu
tions to the University."

Earle said he is unaware of any talk about the
possibility of renaming Jordan Hall or any other
buildings or academic honors named after Jordan.
Still, University officials say they are seriously
considering revising some of Stanford's historical
overviews, including the version published on
Stanford's Web site, to reflect the findings in Cut
ler's book.
Who cares?
Despite accusations of deceit at the heart of Stan
ford's foundation and reluctance on behalf of the
University to investigate this claim, the Stanford
murder mystery seems largely unfelt on campus.
"Her being murdered doesn't really change my
world viewpoints or perspective," said sophomore
