# Book says founder poisoned
## 
### TANIA ROJAS 
On the evening of Feb. 28,1905, Jane Stanford
asked her personal secretary for a glass of bicar
bonate soda. Into the night, servants heard her
agonizing cry: "I think I have been poisoned .. ."
Minutes later, Jane Stanford was pronounced
dead.
Whodunit?
That's the question posed by retired Stanford
physician Robert Cutler in his book, "The Myste
rious Death of Jane Stanford." The book has
piqued the attention of the national media with a
provocative claim: Contrary to the University's of
ficial story that Jane died of heart failure she
was actually poisoned in the Moana Hotel in
Hawaii, and her death was covered up by then-
University President David Starr Jordan.
"The 'Stanford community,' as you call it, has
been quick to say that all scrutiny is welcome,"
said Leora Romney, a Los Angeles Times re
porter who wrote a front-page feature on the
book's claim. "But at the same time, there is great
reluctance to acknowledge that Starr Jordan may
have had less than honorable motives. Cutler's re
search is solid. His scholarship has not been chal
lenged. So why not accept his conclusions? The
University insists on stopping short of that."
'Highly speculative'
The University says it has nothing to be
ashamed of.
"We believe Dr. Cutler has written an interest
ing and provocative account of the death of Jane
Stanford," said Gordon Earle, director of Univer
sity communications, pointing out that the book
was published by Stanford University Press and
featured in Stanford magazine, the University's
alumni publication.
In his book, Cutler details Jordan's cover-up of
Stanford's death, claiming that he perjured the
public by saying she had died of heart disease.
That story has been kept on official records ever
since. However, according to Cutler, Jordan knew
of the poisoning but denied it and even publicly
disparaged the doctors and coroner's jury who had
evidence she was murdered.
Earle rebuffed the possibility that Jordan cov

ered up Jane's death or, worse yet, was the mur
derer.
"Some have made the case that President Jor
dan was involved in a cover-up surrounding the
circumstances of Jane Stanford's death," he said.
"The University believes that this conclusion is
highly speculative and not supported by any solid
proof. And there is absolutely no evidence that
President Jordan was directly connected in any
way in Jane Stanford's death."
Earle said Jordan should be remembered by his
dedication to the school's academic standards.
"As a university, we strongly believe in the
value of scholarship," he said. "When you look at
the entirely of President Jordan's career at Stan
ford, it is clear that he was one of our finest presi
dents and that he made many positive contribu
tions to the University."

Earle said he is unaware of any talk about the
possibility of renaming Jordan Hall or any other
buildings or academic honors named after Jordan.
Still, University officials say they are seriously
considering revising some of Stanford's historical
overviews, including the version published on
Stanford's Web site, to reflect the findings in Cut
ler's book.
Who cares?
Despite accusations of deceit at the heart of Stan
ford's foundation and reluctance on behalf of the
University to investigate this claim, the Stanford
murder mystery seems largely unfelt on campus.
"Her being murdered doesn't really change my
world viewpoints or perspective," said sophomore

David Gudai.
Sophomore Armando Munoz
agreed.
"I think it makes for an interest
ing story, but I feel that Stanford stu
dents aren't affected personally," he
said.
Michael Ryan, the chef at Nar
nia, offered a different perspective.
"I can't say that I feel bad," he
said. "It all harkens back to the Old
Robber Baron era. It's historically
interesting, but it has nothing to do
with Stanford today."
That lack of concern has inspired
some dialogue among the Stanford
community and the media circle.
"I wonder if anyone really has
the larger context yet," said Com
munication Prof. Laura Leets.

"Given Stanford is a community of
scholars, my sense is that people
want to be thoughtful with the new
findings and are waiting to see what
new information is uncovered."
Part of the media's fascination
with the story, according to Rom
ney, stems from the absence of in
terest in Stanford's death for
decades.
"The circumstances surrounding
her death have generated very little
response from Jane enthusiasts," she
said. "The institutional response to
what seems rather convincing
ly to have been a murder is what
made this an interesting story now,"
she said.
Susan Wolfe, who wrote an arti
cle titled "Who Killed Jane Stan
ford?" in the September / October
edition of Stanford magazine, sees
that sense of apathy as under
standable.
"The incidents took place a cen
tury ago, all of the major players are

dead, and the University has risen to
the rank of world class," she said. "I
would not have expected much
more than a shoulder shrug or, at
most, a 'gee, isn't that interesting?'
reaction. It's really a history buff's
story."
Sophomore Anne Jia doubts the
validity of Cutler's theory, though
she hasn't read the book.
"I don't think I really believe it,"
she said. "I haven't heard that much
about it, but there are other tales on
the Stanfords that aren't true."
And if it is true? Jia says she
wouldn't care.
"It doesn't seem to do that much
with the University anymore," she
said.
Still, Romney maintains that it
should.
"[The incidence] should generate
some interest and reflection at a uni
versity that enshrines its founders to
such a great degree," Romney said.
"And perhaps over time, it will."
