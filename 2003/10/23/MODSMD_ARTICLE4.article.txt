# Mausoleum Party not revived this year

### HELEN CHENG 
For the second year in a row, students will not be
dancing over the graves of the Stanford family this Hal
loween, a sign that the Mausoleum Party may be laid to
rest for good.
Last year, the Stanford Alumni Association decided
to stop funding the party, a 10-year campus tradition at
which costume-clad students danced near the final rest
ing place of University founders, in favor of broader pro
gramming. The senior class presidents at the time said
they were not able to sponsor the event on their own, due
to a lack of time and funding, but that they hoped it
would be revived in future years.
This year, the senior class presidents and cabinet or
ganized Full Moon on the Quad, another event that had
once received funding from the Alumni Association, but
they have no plans to revive the Mausoleum Party.
Some students expressed disappointment at the
decision.
"I went to the Mausoleum Party during my freshman
and sophomore years, although my freshman year was
definitely more memorable," senior Victor Wong said.
"That year, they had Sir Mix-A-Lot come and play. It
was pretty rowdy, and everyone was in costume. The
venue was also a good choice for a Halloween party."
The Alumni Association stopped funding the event
two years ago, in favor of funding more student-alumni
interaction and networking and other priorities.
"The SAA decided that we needed to focus resources
and our energy on other events that would serve a broad
er student constituency and that would better fit with
SAA's purpose and mission," said Victor Madrigal, di
rector of student programs at the association. "We con
cluded that the Mausoleum Party could easily be hosted
and organized by another group or a collaborative effort
of multiple groups."
Senior Mikey Lee, a class president, expressed ap
proval of the association's decision.
"With past years' budget cuts and the hiring freeze, I
think the Alumni Association has had to pick and choose
from the many events it has sponsored in the past," he
said. "While I can't speak on behalf of the staff, I can def
initely say that the Alumni Association is doing a very
good job of using its resources to achieve its mission."
Some students see this as part of a trend toward a qui
eter campus.
"I don't like the University's strict alcohol policies,"
junior Whalen Rozelle said. "There aren't that many
Stanford parties to begin with, so I'm for more parties in
general."
Wong also felt the alcohol policy has had a negative
impact on the campus social scene.
"The University's stringent alcohol policy doesn't
seem to have made a substantial impact on the well
being of the student body, as evidenced by the alcohol
related incidents at Full Moon, although it certainly has
dampened the social atmosphere on campus," he said.
Senior Michael Kodiak agreed.
"I do think that it is kind of ridiculous how the Uni-

versity seems to be cracking down
on everything. It's like banning
books," he said.
Students can, however, take ad
vantage of the other opportunities
available on campus.
"For those that like to celebrate
Halloween, they can attend the
theme concert usually sponsored by
the Music Department," suggested
Madrigal. "They can volunteer at
some of the local haunted houses set
up for children. And there are also
plenty of Bay Area events that one

can find on Internet event listings."
The senior class presidents and
executive cabinet are providing an
other alternative by sponsoring a
trip to the Castro district on Hal
loween, said senior Mary
Himinkool, another class president.
Tickets for the event go on sale next
Monday and Tuesday for $l5.
Himinkool said she would like to
see the University begin sponsoring
campus-wide events, particularly sur
rounding holidays like Halloween.
"The fact remains, Stanford is a
residential campus, and this means
that students need safe, realistic op
portunities to experience college so
cial life," she said. "When one tradi
tion ends, I'd like to see a new one
begin."
