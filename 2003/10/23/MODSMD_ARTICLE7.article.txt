## Vinni's big find: A good look at porn films 
### 
I was skipping down the hall the
other day (I'm gay, I'm al
lowed to skip) and, out the
corner of my eye, I caught a
glimpse of a dreadfully large breast
ed woman mounting a preposter
ously well-endowed man. My natu
ral reaction, of course, was to
scream, run away and do something
very gay (i.e. go buy a pair of Diesel
jeans), but, feeling it my duty as sex
columnist, I instead entered the
room and asked: "What the hell is
going on here?"
"We're watching porn," was the
response of my dorm-mate whose
eyes, I assure you, never left his

computer screen.
Jugs still gyrat
ing, I stood there
in amazement at
how openly my
friend watched
hardcore porn
while two other
guys and two girls
half watched, half
joked and half
paid no attention

to the scene, which, much to my dis
may, focused mainly on female pen
etration. What planet was I on? The
blatant, raw act of sex was literally
unfolding before my virgin eyes
(well, eyes, anyway).
True to human nature and to
Californians in general, after about
10 seconds I got over it and joined in
on the party.
Now that we have pornography
prostrate on the ground and ready
for us to do to it as we will, how
should we deal with one of Ameri
ca's favorite past times?
Pornography is a $10 billion in
dustry that has links to some of
American's leading corporations
including AT&T and General Mo
tors. Even if you've never personal
ly viewed porn, the University of
Chicago's Nation Opinion Re
search Center's "General Social
Survey" of approximately 3,000
adults shows that 47.7 percent of
participants age 18-29 have viewed
it within the last year. Apply that to
Stanford, and that's a lot of people
watching porn.
Is this a good thing? Many bring
up the arguments that pornography
degrades woman, that it reinforces
stereotypes and that it can even in
fluence people to perform acts of
sexual assault. All these things, to
some extent, are probably true. But
not really.
Most often women in pornogra
phy are portrayed as mindless id
iots solely there to serve the sexual
desires of men, but how is that any
different to women's role in the ma
jority of Hollywood blockbuster
hits or, more to the point, in the ma
jority of music videos? Sure,
women are getting more and more
powerful in popular media, but
that's because we've let main
stream society into the director's
studio. Wouldn't porn receive the
same benefits if we took it out of
the closet? And, coming back to the
real world, don't men come off just
as ridiculous as women in these
cheesy, C -movies?
As for aggravating sexual as
sault, common sense would dictate
that if a man's willing to rape a
woman, porn isn't going to be any
more of a catalyst than a Britney
Spears music video.
So, even if it's not so detrimental
to society, why watch porn in the first
place? The arguments here range
from its being a harmless release on
sexual energy to its role as an educa
tor of how to have better sex. The
most important argument, however,
is that it removes sex from the taboo
box of societal guilt and puts it on
your living room television.
Even though you're probably —
strike that — hopefully not going to
sit down with mom and dad and
watch "Forest Hump," the simple
idea of sex as a part of our entertain
ment economy along with french
fries and skateboarding normalizes
it and makes it no different than any
of the other pleasures we enjoy.
So if you want a random gay guy
named Vinni to come by your
room, turn off the lights and plug in
the VCR!
