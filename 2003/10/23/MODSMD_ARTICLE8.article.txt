# For Whom The Bell Tolls
## Clock tower corner the 'Intersection of Death' 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
You know, 10:56 a.m. is not a good time to be a biker or
a pedestrian especially if you have to cross the "Inter
section of Death." More perilous than Highway 101 at rush
hour, the area around the clock tower and the corner of the
Quad is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
You'd think that smart Stanford students would have
figured out some system to avoid daily near-death experi
ences. Granted, helmets, hand signaling, bells and bike
lights will always score low on the campus cool list (think of
all the jokes about sketchy grad students and bike helmets).
But come on guys, what about safety?
After many months of careful observation, I've concluded
that there are a variety of factors that make biking in the Quad
a frightening adventure. Here they are in no particular order.
Jamba Juicers : Armed with Orange-a-Peel smoothies
and sourdough pretzels, these hungry riders will be sure to
knock you over. Most of the time they won't see you com
ing because they're concentrating on their breakfast.
Pack bikers : Pedaling in herds is extremely frequent at
the beginning of the year. Any day in mid-September you
can be sure to spot dozens of confused frosh biking together
toward some mysterious destination (FLiCKS and football
games are favorite group activities). Assume they won't let
you through; they're too afraid of losing the rest of the pack.
Multi-taskers : These brave souls claim they can talk,
pedal and hold a phone to their ear at the same time. Stay
clear of the ones who are dialing and biking uphill at the In
tersection of Death these people have no idea what
they're doing and would most likely fall off backward if they
slammed on the brakes.
Clock Checkers : Tons of people will disagree, but there
couldn't be a worse place for a clock for safety reasons.
The 10-minute interval between classes is by far the worst
time to be on wheels at the Intersection of Death, because
come on, who doesn't glance up to see what time it is? The
end result is that you've got a lot of bikers looking up at the
minute hand and very few eyes on the road.
Radio heads: I confess, I'm an "I-can-pedal-and-still-lis
ten-to-my-walkman" biker. And I'm one of many on cam
pus. Gripping walkmen, discmen and iPods (usually in their
left hand), these music freaks care more about the song
they're listening to than your well-being.
Inner-Quad Bikers: These folks aren't necessarily bad
navigators; it's the place they choose bike that causes the
problems. Pedestrians, beware: Walking in the inner, shady
part of the Quad is no longer a risk-free activity. Inner-
Quad bikers will come up behind you, cut between you and
a group of friends (leaving about two inches on either side)
and then pedal away as if nothing had happened.
Bat-out-of-hell bikers: These guys are in a hurry most
likely because they're late to class. They subscribe to the be
lief that if you're biking down hill, you have right of way.
Bat-out-of-hell bikers best correspond to aggressive
drivers. If they see you coming, they're sure to pedal hard
er (yup, you're the one who's going to wind up slamming on
the brakes). They figure that you're coming back from class
and can afford to make way for them.
Bike Ride of Shamers: These bikers wouldn't be such a
threat if they weren't always biking in the opposite direc
tion. In largest abundance in the early mornings, these stu
dents have spent the night or some portion thereof in
a bed that doesn't belong to them. Chances are they didn't
get much sleep and their reflexes probably aren't their best.
People with 9 a.m. classes, be on the lookout.
"Biking for Bozos" should be a graduation requirement.
But since it isn't, and it probably won't be for a long time, I've
come up with a couple of my own strategies to make biking
in the Quad a less harrowing adventure. For starters, I always
leave for class about two minutes before everyone else does
to avoid the crunch. But what's really helping me out is the
squeaky sumo wrestler I bought for the front of my bike. But
please don't all go out and copy me; I'd like to be able to rec
ognize my bike on the Tresidder rack.
