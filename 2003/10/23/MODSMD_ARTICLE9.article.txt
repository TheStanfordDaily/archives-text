# If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's red, it's drunk

f Answer girl, I'm an Asian freshman, so I am really
M M worried about drinking. I've heard all about this
Asian flush thing, so I don't want to get drunk with
my homies before I-Hum section I'm afraid my
TFwul notice my altered state because of my novel coloring.
Why am I so cursed?
A Geez, that sucks. Going to I-Hum section, I mean.
/\ "Asian flush" isn't great either, but at least it's
/ ■ pretty common. For instance, there's this one real-
JL ly cool, nice, sweet girl I know that works at The
Daily, who even turns bright red from head to toe when she
drinks. I always feel bad for her, because everyone makes fun
of her when it happens even though it's not her fault. It's so
unfair, don't you think?
But anyway, back to your question see, about 50 percent of
Asians lack the ability to produce a certain enzyme, called the ac

etaldehydedehydrogenase-I isozyme (ALDH-
I), which helps break down alcohol. Specifical
ly, these individuals can't metabolize acety
laldehyde, which is an intermediate product of
alcohol in the body. This leads to all sorts of ef
fects when drinking alcohol, like increased
pulse and decreased blood pressure, and yes,
flushing (vasodilation).
It also means that Asian glow — or, what's
clinically called "Flushing Syndrome" — isn't
an allergy, as some people call it. It's more like

lactose intolerance, which is also due to a missing enzyme. Some
people are allergic to alcohol, but they get rashes and weird stuff
like that; and anyway, it's unrelated to Asian glow.
Finally, just like lactose intolerance, Asian flush results
from a genetic mutation. And unfortunately, it's inherited as
an autosomal dominant gene. You see, that's why it's so corn

mon among Asians and even hapas: You only need one flush
prone parent to get it yourself.
For instance, the really cool girl I was talking about earlier
let's call her Anita was telling me just the other day about how
her 5-foot-3 mom likes margaritas, and how she never turns red
at all from it, even after downing mind-boggling quantities of it.
Anita's dad, on the other hand, flushes after having a single glass
of wine with dinner, and Anita's sister is the same way.
But hey, as far as genetic mutations go, flushing syndrome
isn't so bad. Apparently, there's actually this prescription drug
called Antabuse, developed for alcoholics, which works by
mimicking this mutation: Alcoholics who take it get sick off a
small amount of alcohol, making Antabuse a kind of "aversion
therapy" which can complement other kinds of treatment.
