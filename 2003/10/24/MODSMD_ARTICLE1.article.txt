# Faculty Senate expands GER course offerings
## 
### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
Next fall, students can choose from a broader selection of cours
es to fulfill the University's General Education Requirements,
thanks to a new policy adopted at yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing that changes the organization and classification of GER courses.
Under the new policy, every department or interdisciplinary
program will be placed under the umbrella of one or more GER
sub-areas. Every course worth three or more units and taken for a
letter grade will by default satisfy a particular GER by depart
mental affiliation, unless the department or program specifies that
it should not.
As a result, many upper-division classes will now count toward
fulfilling GER sub-areas, giving students more flexibility in select
ing classes to fulfill GERs.
Though the motion to approve the proposal passed by a simple
majority, many Senate members expressed their disapproval for
the new policy.
John Bravman, vice provost for undergraduate education, ex
pressed regret that there was such "ambiguity" in how GER-satis
fying courses will be determined.
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts said that the change in
policy needed to be "seasoned a bit more" before approval and en
couraged that there be "some process of approval" established for
GER courses.
"I don't understand why this is a good thing," he said of the
change.
Philosophy Prof. Debra Satz presented her concerns with the
proposal as well.
"We are trying to train people in characteristic ways of think
ing," she said. Satz added that because not every course in a par
ticular field necessarily teaches to general education, all courses
in a department shouldn't automatically satisfy a GER.
Sociology Prof. Mark Granovetter agreed.
"There are some courses in a department that might not meet
what we mean by general education," he said.
But according to Hester Gelber, chair of the sub-committee on
general education requirements, the new process will be much
more efficient than the current method for determining GER-sat
isfying courses.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas, chair of the committee on un
more efficient than the current
method for determining GER-sat
isfying courses.
Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas, chair of the committee
on undergraduate standards and
policy, recommended that the sen
ate adopt the proposal.
"The overall effect of this pro
posal would be to make more
courses eligible for GER status and
give students a broader range of
choices in Areas 2, 3 and 4," he

said.
Some senate members said the
new policy would change the
meaning of general education at
the University but felt that it
would benefit the students.
Economics Prof. Timothy Bres
nahan said that the new policy
"changes the message we send to
students about the organization of
knowledge," but added that it
would help the students choose
courses.
Next year in the course bul
letin, instead of a list of courses
that satisfy each GER, students
will find a list of courses that do
not meet a department's criteria
for a GER course.
