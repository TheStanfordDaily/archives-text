## Clark Center has strong promise 
### 
After four years of planning and
construction, the James H. Clark
Center officially opens its doors
today. The building is the central fa
cility of the University's new Bio-X initiative,
which is attempting to foster interdisciplinary ef
forts in the biological sciences. We believe this
center will be a precious asset for Stanford and
that it has great potential to spur new and inno
vative approaches in campus research.
The Clark Center's opening provides an im
portant opportunity for the University to re
main competitive in the expanding field of bi
ological sciences. Many other universities
have already created programs similar to
Stanford's Bio-X initiative, including Harvard
University, Yale University and the California
Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Re
search a joint program headed by UC-
Berkeley, UC-San Francisco and UC-Santa
Cruz. Thanks to the Clark Center, Bio-X will
now have an adequate home base at Stanford
to conduct collaborative research comparable
to that executed at fellow institutions.
The design of the building will ensure that
researchers and scientists from different de
partments and schools at the University inter
act and exchange ideas. Bio-X links the

Schools of Engineering, Humanities and Sci
ence, and Medicine. To reinforce this partner
ship, the Clark Center provides the physical
location at which the individuals in these dif
ferent disciplines can communicate. While not
all Bio-X affiliated faculty will be housed in
the center, those placed in the building can
serve as connections between the Bio-X com
munity and faculty members' respective home
departments.
In addition to encouraging intercampus col
laboration, the building's layout will also help
develop relationships between those within
the Stanford community and those outside the
community. By setting aside 13 percent of the
building's space for sabbatical and transient
visitors, relationships will be forged with other
university scholars as well as researchers in the
private sector.
The new Clark Center is a significant step for
ward in the history of the University's Bio-X
program. It is essential that Stanford faculty and
visitors capitalize on the many unique opportu
nities that this new building affords its occupants
and associates. If properly utilized, the facility
will be an invaluable resource to both the Bio-X
initiative and the University as a whole in the
years to come.
