# Sullivan will be hard act to follow
## 
### 
Last week, Kathleen Sullivan an
nounced her plans to step down as
dean of the Law School. We commend
her for the superior job she has done
since acceding to the post in 1999, and we be
lieve that her many contributions to the
growth and betterment of the Law School
have been appreciated by the Stanford com
munity.

Sullivan is known for her steadfast commit
ment to the students of the Law School an
admirable approach considering the focus
other law schools place on rankings and alum
ni contributions (although she has been very
successful in those areas as well). She has been
the driving force behind a number of positive
changes at the Law School, including pushing
for classroom renovations and helping open a
clinic in East Palo Alto where students can
hone their skills.

In addition to her obvious abilities as an ad
ministrator, Sullivan is also a consistently top
ranked professor at the Law School. And even
though she is planning to step down from her
deanship next fall, her advocacy for student is
sues has not waned. She is actively promoting
plans to build a new Law School dorm both to

attract new students; and to improve the quali
ty of life for those aliready here.

Sullivan's strong guiding hand will be
missed when she leaves the dean's office to
return to her life of research. Sullivan is a
great asset to the Law School, and we praise
University President John Hennessy's deci
sion to select her as the head of a new consti
tutional law center at Stanford so that she
may continue to contribute to the campus
community in a leadership role. With Sullivan
just down the hall, her successor will be able
to rely on the guidance of her proven leader
ship skills to ensure a smooth transition after
she leaves the job.

The University will soon begin searching
for Sullivan's successor. In this process, Stan
ford should strive to receive input from all of
the interested groups, especially students.
One of the hallmarks of Sullivan's success is
her ability to connect with law students as well
as faculty, alumni and other administrators.
The next dean should continue this tradition
of good relations that Sullivan has established
a tradition of collaboration that has made
Stanford Law School the leading institution it
is today.
