## Future recalls need further reform 
### BILL WHALEN 
California is the first state in
more than 80 years to recall a sit
ting governor. Is this landmark
eveftt a fluke or part of a larger
strain? Would
thojje states without a recall
meqhanism be wise to follow
California's lead?
Tihe Golden State's voter re
bellion fits into a national non
partisan pattern. Gov. Gray
a Democrat, was recalled
a rrlonth after Alabama voters
rejected a $1.2 billion tax hike
craved by their Republican gov
ernor. Recall movements are
in Nevada and Wisconsin
aga nst both Republican and
Democratic lawmakers who ei
thes raised taxes or refused to
support a property-tax freeze.
At present, 18 states have re
call laws. Political activists may
attempt to add such provisions
to ifiore state constitutions as a
means of reining in incumbents
in the same vein as the term
limit laws of a decade ago.
If recalls do go national, it
should reflect populist senti
ment, not partisan desires.
States should improve on the
California model with the fol
lowing reforms in mind.
More-specific grounds: Cali

fornia law says recall is appro
priate as "the public good may
require." Other states are more
detailed. Montana limits its re
call grounds to physical or men
tal lack of fitness, incompe
tence, violation of the oath of
office or failure to perform du
ties prescribed by law.
Quicker process: In Califor
nia, opponents have 160 days to
collect recall petition signatures.
Nevada allows only 60 days,
which seems more sensible, as a
quicker timeline makes for less
of a distraction to lawmakers.
Higher threshold: California
law requires signatures from
only 12 percent of the voters
who cast ballots in the last gu
bernatorial election. Most recall
states have a threshold of 25 per
cent (in Kansas, it's 40 percent).
Given the sophistication of pro
fessional signature gatherers, a
threshold higher than Califor
nia's is appropriate.
Limited ballot: California law
requires a $3,500 deposit for gu
bernatorial replacement candi
dates. Not surprisingly, 135 can
didates cluttered the ballot. In
Nevada, replacement candi
dates have to collect the same
number of signatures (128,000)
as those required to force a re
call vote. This safeguard weeds

out non-serious candidates and
instills public confidence in the
process.
Minimize politics: Critics said
that California's recall was a par
tisan ploy by Republicans to re
verse the results of the last elec
tion. New Jersey law avoids this
by putting only the governor's
name on the ballot â€”no re
placement candidates with
the job going to the state senate
leader should the incumbent
lose.
One wonders what effect this
would have had on California's
outcome, if the only alternative
to the Democratic governor
been a fellow Democrat.
Despite its flaws, California's
recall was a resounding success.
Voter turnout increased, as did
the media's interest. In this re
gard, the recall had a therapeutic
effect on a dispirited California
electorate. Other states may be
as fortunate if they experiment
with direct democracy but
only if they improve on what
California has started.
