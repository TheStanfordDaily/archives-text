						shout out to democracy 
### 
I spend the majority of my
time thinking about friends
and family, the value of recy
cling and conservation, how I
can spend more of my time out
doors and what else I might do with
my life. (I just completed my bach
elor's in June. As I'm co-terming
now, I'm still at one of my " what-in
the-world-am-I-gonna-do-now? "
stages of life.) And when I'm not
thinking about these things, I'm
thinking about government es
pecially about America's govern
ment and its relationships with the
other governments and people of
the world.

Of course, not everyone thinks
about stuff like democracy. After
all, there are many other things to
think about. But the variety of
things available to focus one's at
tention on in life is precisely why I
question our American ideal of
democracy. In promoting the
value of democracy and thus,
civic engagement I question
whether it's actually important
that each citizen spends time
thinking about how the govern
ment should be run.

Very basically, the concept of
democracy refers to governing or
setting up rules and creating a
structure in which people may
peacefully live. Thereafter, it's
about enforcing this structure. In

the end, government is really just
about establishing and maintaining

order, right?
Although it is
necessary that
we all follow the
rules to achieve
a functional soci
ety, is it likewise
necessary that
everyone play a
part in creating
or enforcing the
rules? Or do

they merely need to decide
whether they agree with the laws
put in place? To me, it seems that a
government can achieve its validity
solely by obtaining the consent of
its citizens. But beyond this, do the
people need to do any more than
mind their own business?

Furthermore, isn't order really
just the periphery to actual life, the
boundary within which we confine
our existences? In some ways, laws
are like the frame of a house or the
skin of the body they give soci
ety some form and hold us togeth
er, but they do not determine of
what we are made. Rather, what
we are "made of' is what we do
during our daily lives when we're
not thinking about politics. If indi
viduals do get involved in the deci
sion-making process of their gov
ernment, how can they meaning

fully engage in public debate with
out diverging from the true
"meat" of life?
In the end, it is fine if you wish
to pursue other interests at the
expense of your involvement in
the deliberative aspect of the po
litical process. But then, don't
expect your opinions to play an
important role in forming policy.
For democracy to work, your
consent is crucial. But half-in
formed opinions don't make
good law. If you really want your
views represented when laws are
being made, make your involve
ment a priority.
For now, we should all be more
honest. As citizens, let's not He and
say that we know enough to speak
on pohtical issues. As lawmakers,
let's tell citizens where there is
room for input, and then let's be
careful to Hsten for their approval
or dissent of proposed policies. In
the end, the democratic culture is
still in full force, so we truly do need
the pubhc's consent to make the
order we estabhsh vahd. Being
more reahstic about our roles in the
pohtical system will certainly make
it stronger.
