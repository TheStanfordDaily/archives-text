Breilrose not 'distinguished'
In the very fine article about the
United Nations Association Film Fes
tival ("Weekend film festival kicks
off," Oct. 22), I am described as a "dis
tinguished filmmaker." There seems to
be some confusion. I am not a distin
guished filmmaker, but my colleagues
in the Department of Communication,
Profs. Kristine Samuelson and Jan
Krawitz, are very distinguished film
makers indeed. I am happy to bask in
the light of their talents.

Wallace's column misses point
I would like to ask columnist
Kathryn Wallace what differenti
ates General William G. Boykin
from Osama bin Laden and his
cronies ("Politicians can gab their
guts out," Oct. 22)?
Boykin in full uniform spews out
his hatred for the Muslims, while
Osama Bin Laden in his Jihad uni
form screams out his hatred for
Jews and Christians (the so-called
"infidels").
The author misses this point
completely. America is at war with
two Muslim countries and the
issue of Palestine and Israel is be
coming more complicated with
each passing day. Do you really
think that the First Amendment
should protect Boykin's remarks;
that too, when spoken in full uni
form?
It is comments like these that are
fodder for Osama Bin Laden and
the like, and Boykin's comments are
not in any way helping the U.S.
Army to win the hearts and minds of
the Muslim world!

Pipes's comments misunderstood
Junior Mabroqkah Heneidi fears
Mr. Pipes's comments will result in
hate crimes against Muslim-Ameri
can communities and distrust on
campus ("Student wary of campus
speaker," Oct. 21). But I don't think
she hears what Daniel Pipes is say
ing or what we as non-Muslims hear.
He is not against Islam as a faith or
religion and certainly is not perpe
trating hatred against it. He is speak
ing only of the threat of militant
Islam, which is not only a threat to
the West but to Islam itself.
Within the religion there is a bat
tle today for the heart and soul of
those who hate and those who re
spect life. The solution to this must
come from moderates who speak for
the greater Jihad; of the struggle
within the self for moral and human
decency rather than the lesser Jihad -
or "holy war" embraced by Is
lamists who use it to legitimatize
force and are willing to die for the
cause. In the Koran, it asks for a
"striving in the path of God," but it
should be "a moral struggle and not
an armed one." Every religion
speaks of peace and of war; it is by in
terpretation that we choose the side.
Mr. Pipes certainly does not portray
images associating Islam with terror
ism. He points out these events as
being caused by radical fundamentalist
Islam. Events such as the Sept. 11 at
tacks, homicide bombings in Israel and
other bombings in Morocco, Lebanon,
Yemen, Jordan, Pakistan, Saudi Ara
bia and Indonesia in the name of mili
tant Islam are unfortunately a reality.
In Mr. Pipes's call to profiling, he asks
only for common sense to prevail.
If terrorism is being caused more so
by people of Middle Eastern descent,
then, unfortunately, to look more
closely at this type of person than a 70-
year-old Irish Catholic nun just makes

sense. Today, to look more closely at
mosques or Islamic schools for hiding
militancy than at synagogues or
churches just makes sense. The truth
is, charity for fundamentalists groups
such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-
Qaeda has been funneled through
mosques and Arab charities. Some re
ligious schools or madrassas have
preached radical Islamist rhetoric of
hatred for the "infidel" and "holy war"
as a personal duty of every Muslim.
Daniel Pipes's purpose is the
truth. On the contrary from sowing
seeds of hatred, he educates us
about the difference between a faith
that can embrace peace and toler
ance and an ideology that can't.

New federal abortion bill is
wrong
Every major newspaper recently
published articles about the U.S. Sen
ate passing a ban on an abortion proce
dure. The articles went on to say that
the president is expected to sign the bill,
and that it will be challenged in court.
It would be wrong for President
George W. Bush to sign this bill.
This law is unconstitutional and im
moral. No one has the right to dic
tate to a woman what medical pro
cedures she must follow.
It seems sad to me that the Republi
can Party the party of the great
emancipator, who freed the slaves
now wants to hold women in a state of
servitude by an inhumane and cruel law.
I hope you will speak up about
this bill on your editorial page, and I
hope that other readers of The Daily
will tell their legislators and their
president how they feel about this
law, which seems so wrong to me.
