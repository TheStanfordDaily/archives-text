# CARDINAL TODAY
## Football invades Autzen 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's game between Stanford (2-3, 0-3
Pacific 10 Conference) and Oregon (4-3, 1-2)
isn't exactly a marquee match-up in the Pac-10.
But for two teams desperate to escape the con
ference's cellar, it's one of the most important
games of the year.

The Cardinal and the Ducks have each lost
three straight, and their early-season dreams of
bowl game glory have been all but dashed by
nightmarish blowout losses. This game could put
the winner on the road to recovery and the loser
on the road to Pac-10 perdition.
Neither team should have to look far for moti
vation: Oregon pounded Stanford 41-14 last year,
while the Cardinal handed the Ducks their only
loss of the season at Eugene in 2001.
"When we went in there and ended their [l7-
game home winning] streak, that was definitely a
personal thing for them," sophomore wide receiv
er Gerren Crochet said. "That will give them more
motivation to beat us."
As for Stanford's embarrassing loss last year,
"That's not something that's easily forgotten,"
Crochet said. "Obviously, if your school got beat
en last year, that's something you want to make
right."
In this year's incarnation, both Stanford and
Oregon boast stifling run defenses but have had
cracks in their pass coverage exploited for long
gains. Both also have potentially strong passing at
tacks that have faltered in recent weeks.
The teams are similar enough that the differ
ence on Saturday may come down to a few big
plays or lucky breaks.
Crochet said he thought Stanford's loss to

Washington State last week was a matter of "a
couple of inches here, just this catch there, a
block there. This week, we do expect to make
that catch, that block, break that tackle."
If those breaks go Stanford's way early in the
game, the Ducks could "quack" the way they did
when confronted with big deficits against Wash
ington State and Arizona State.
Stanford has shown more resilience in its
losses, often playing better in the second half
than the first, but has not exhibited the type of
offensive firepower necessary to mount suc
cessful comebacks.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said Stan
ford isn't counting on Oregon to self-destruct the
way it has the last three games. Instead, he's prepar
ing the team for the powerhouse that knocked off
then-No. 5 Michigan on Sept. 20.
"We have seen how talented they are in all
facets of their game," Teevens said. "We need to
bring our best."
Going into last year's game, the situation was
similar to this year: Oregon had lost two straight
after a great start to the season, and Stanford had
been hoping to emerge from the depths of the
conference ledger with a surprise win on the road.
The onus will be on the Cardinal's improved
defense to prevent a repeat of last year, when
Ducks quarterback Jason Fife scored four touch
downs and running back Terry Whitehead
scrambled for 132 yards.
That will require harassing Fife and fellow
signal-caller Kellen Clemens into making the
type of mistakes that have dogged them in the
team's losses.
"Pressure has been a great plus for us this year,"
Teevens said. "Our approach against these guys, and
they have some talented quarterbacks and good re

ceivers [in] Demetrius Williams and Sarnie Parker, is
to try to keep them somewhat off balance and try to
mix and match as best we can."
Sophomore linebacker Kevin Schimmelman
added, "Obviously, we have to stop the run first,
and then play not only good coverage but get good
pass rush... A lot of times in the Pac-10 people
look at us and decide they need to get the ball off
quickly, because we do bring pressure."
On offense, the Cardinal will need to take ad
vantage of the fact that it is facing a less-than-furious
pass rush for the first time in several games. Stan
ford's offense was unproductive against Brigham
Young, USC and Washington State, mainly be
cause those teams didn't give Trent Edwards time
to find his receivers downfield.
Oregon failed to record any sacks against Ari
zona State in its last game, and if Stanford can
keep quarterback Chris Lewis upright this week
end, the passing game could awaken from its
four-game (two-year?) slumber.
"We expect to explode," Crochet said.
Edwards' injury will likely keep him off the field
on Saturday, and Lewis may have a chance to keep L
him sidelined indefinitely if he leads the Cardinal to
victory. Some fans have been clamoring for the fifth
year senior to return to the lineup since week one, but
Lewis hasn't yet had the opportunity to justify that
support with his play.
Two years ago, however, Lewis led Stanford's
stirring comeback win in Eugene, Ore., an expe
rience that could prove valuable before the same
raucous Autzen Stadium crowd on Saturday.
Then again, it was Oregon's Fife who was at the
helm last year.
The question, then, is not whether history will re
peat itself, but which history will repeat itself: the
one recorded in 2001, or the one written last year.
