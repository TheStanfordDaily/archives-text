### NATHAN KURZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During a recent conference call with
reporters, Oregon coach Mike Bellotti
was asked to assess his team's first four
and last three games.
He paused and quipped sarcastically,
"Why'd you choose to break it up like
that?"
There's a reason for that, Mike.
Your Ducks are doing their best to put
on a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde show.
Oregon began the season 4-0, includ
ing a shocking 31-27 victory over a seem
ing national title contender (Michigan)
that landed them on the cover of Sports
Illustrated.
But since then, blowout losses to
Washington State (55-16) and Arizona
State (59-14) and an embarrassing defeat
to Utah have collectively taken all of the
steam out of that roaring start.
According to Bellotti, injuries and
turnovers have been the main causes of
the Ducks' recent downward spiral.
Over the last three games, the Ducks
have suffered injuries to its offensive line
and linebackers and have netted a minus
-10 turnover margin.
Oregon had a bye week to help prepare
for Stanford, and Bellotti is counting on
that extra time off regenerating his weary
ballclub.
•'Hopefully this will help get us back to
a competitive nature," he said.
Obviously, the biggest question this
week is which team will show up.
"Against Michigan, they put every
thing together, and that's the team we ex
pect to see [tomorrow]," Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens said.
The most important determinant of
Oregon's success will be the production it
receives at the quarterback position. The
combination of Kellen Clemens and Jason
Fife has the ability to be productive or to
be erratic the two have combined to
throw 10 interceptions in the last three
games.
Clemens threw picks on his first two
attempts of the Arizona State game
which tempted some to call for Fife to
start for the first time this weekend
but Bellotti maintains that his team's
best chance to win comes when both
quarterbacks play well.
"I think that honestly gives us the best
opportunity for success, playing both in
roles that enhance their opportunities to
maximize their talents," Bellotti said.
When Oregon's quarterbacks are ze
roed-in, they have two talented deep
threats to which they can throw. Demetrius
Williams (33 catches, 631 yards) and Sarnie
Parker (33 catches, 559 yards) both average
over 16 yards a reception and have the abil
ity to burn a secondary in the same way that
the two Williams' have done to the Cardi
nal recently.
"They have good wide receivers and
are very thorough on offense," Teevens
said.
The Ducks, who have traditionally
mixed the pass and run well, have had a
much tougher time developing a consistent
running game this season.
Terence Whitehead has finally
emerged as the starting tailback
after leading the team in rushing for
the last four games. But he's aver
aging only 56 yards a game and only
3.4 yards a carry.
The defense, too, has been good
and bad.
Kevin Mitchell, one of the Pac
10's leading tacklers has been solid
up the middle.
But Oregon's pair of defensive

ends has been the most dangerous
part of its defense.
Six-foot-6, 309-pound Igor Ol
shansky and 6-foot-4, 261-pound
Devan Long clearly possess dif
ferent defensive styles one bull
rushes you, the other dances
around you but both have been
similarly effective.
Long leads the team with 8.5
tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks, while
Olshansky has 26 tackles (seven for
loss) and two sacks.
"They are a very physical team
defensively and have chances to
make some very big plays,"
Teevens said.

through the air.
Oregon is ranked last in the con
ference and 109 th out of 117
NCAA Division-I teams against
the pass, giving up an average of
278.7 yards per game.
Things have gotten so bad for
the Ducks in the secondary that
they are considering using Parker, a
speedster with a 100-meter dash
time of 10.18, as a cornerback this
week.
"Sarnie may be used in some
pass situations as a nickel-type
back," Bellotti said.
"I think the defensive coaches
liked what they saw, and we talked
about it for two years, and there's
no time like the present."
