## TRENT EDWARDS 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Trent Edwards isn't used to this.
He's not accustomed to spending half the game on his
back and the other half running for his life while things
zip past him at a million miles an hour.
He's not trained to drop back to pass, and instead of lo
cating a receiver, almost immediately toss the ball into the
stands.
And he's not familiar with looking up at the scoreboard
at the end of the game and seeing his team behind.
The 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman arrived at Stanford last
year as one of the most highly touted quarterbacks in school
history. He was instantaneously labeled the next Plunkett,
the next Elway, the next quarterbacking hero that alumni

and students would revere for years to come.
And after a year of sitting out and learning the system, it
was his time to step into the spotlight.
But so far, things haven't worked out in such a fairy tale
like fashion.

The numbers only begin to tell the story of Edwards' try
ing, exhausting year.

He has completed only 66-of-139 passes (47.5 percent)
for only four touchdowns and eight interceptions. He is av
eraging only 130 yards per game through the air. And he has
been sacked 11 times in five games and knocked down on
countless other occasions.

These are statistics coming from the same guy who in
high school set the California state record for completion


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman Trent Edwards and the Stanford football team have had little to smile about recently. But Edwards, who
injured his shoulder in Saturday's 24-14 home loss to Washington State, remains optimistic about the future.
percentage (78.1) in a season.
Maybe most importantly, the Cardinal is
now reeling at 2-3 and is 4-12 since Edwards
matriculated at Stanford. (These are sub
.soo numbers from a leader who didn't lose a
game his last two years at nearby Los Gatos
High School.)
And he won't be able to straighten out
anything this week. Edwards will be side
lined from Stanford's game at Oregon to
morrow with a right shoulder injury and will
watch fifth-year senior Chris Lewis start for
the second time this season.
The week off has surely given Edwards
some much-needed contemplation time.
"Someone told me the other day that I
don't really look that comfortable out
there," he said. "They said it didn't seem like
I was having much fun.
"I kind of took that to heart. I need to be
confident with who I am and act like I've
been there before."

The problem is, though, he hasn't been
there before.

Edwards is learning how agonizing the
growing pains of a rookie quarterback can be.
His first-ever road game might be a good
place to start. Playing in front of 65,000 fans
in high-altitude Provo, Edwards threw for a
school-record low 25 yards and never
seemed to know what defense BYU was
throwing at him.
"It was the first game in my life that I never
got settled in to," Edwards said. "I was throw
ing off my back foot, not really throwing a spi
ral and forgetting plays and routes. It was one
of the toughest games I've ever played."
With struggles like these, Edwards has
had to play a lot of psychological games
with himself.
But he's had a plethora of support from
those close to him to help find his way
through the fog.
Edwards' eldest sister, Shelby, played
volleyball at Oregon an annual cellar
dweller in the Pac-10 and persisted
through a similar coaching change as did
Trent when Tyrone Willingham bolted for
Notre Dame in 2001.
"I was talking to her last week, just kind
of frustrated about things, and she gave
me some advice" Edwards said. "It's nice
to have someone that you're real close

with that can share their experiences with
this stuff."
Edwards' father, too, has had a hand in
dealing with Trent's toils. Andy Edwards is
by far his son's biggest supporter and cheer
leader. He frequently attends practice and
comes to every Stanford game.
But that doesn't mean he's some sort of
on-the-rail kind of dad. Andy lends support
in more of a hands-off manner.
"He loves sitting out there eating his
peanuts and watching me play," Trent said.
"His questions are always more like 'did
you have fun at practice' and not more nag
ging ones."
The myriad number of former success
ful Stanford quarterbacks has been anoth
er resource for Edwards. Sunday at a
church service, he met Steve Stenstrom
ironically the last Cardinal quarterback to
win his first freshman start before Edwards
did so.
It was a nice reminder that even the all
time passing leader in Stanford history took
his share of lumps his first go-around.
"He always had dirt in his mouthpiece and
was always on the ground and getting beat
up," Edwards said of Stenstrom's freshman
year. "He's seen those lows."

And, finally, he has the bonds he formed
in high school to draw on for encourage
ment. Edwards receives weekly e-mails from
ex-coach Butch Cattolico and talks to his
best friends from the football team two or
three times a week.
One of those buddies in particular,
Geno Gingery, is playing tight end at
nearby Foothill Community College and
has found time to reassure Edwards that
he is still the same ace QB he played with
at Los Gatos.
"He'll tell me, 'relax man, you aren't in
high school anymore, but your time will
come,' " Edwards said.
Don't think for a minute, however,
that the last year and a half-plus has been
nothing more than a waiting game for
Edwards.
Ehs redshirt year was "kind of a living
hell" since he had to practice and then lift at
7 a.m. four times a week. It was all part of a
learning experience that tried to acquaint
him with the coaches, system, rigor and
speed of college football.
Edwards has also had to modify much
of his mechanics, including his footwork,
release point and stance when releasing
the ball.

The signal caller has finally become famil
iarized with working on game film He's
starting to grasp things he can exploit
slow linebackers, weak corners and effective
routes against certain safeties, for example.
The film drudgery does pay dividends in
game situations, as Edwards has begun to see
firsthand.
"When a defense rolls to a certain cover
age, my coaches will be sitting there [in film
sessions] telling me to check to this route,"
Edwards said. "Then, you check to that
route [in the game] and sure enough, it's
wide open."
Interestingly, there doesn't appear to be
the slightest bit of animosity between the
elder Lewis and the younger Edwards.
When Edwards was answering ques
tions for this story, Lewis wandered over
and provided a little sarcasm. "Man I hate
Chris Lewis that son of a gun," said
Lewis as he jokingly impersonated Ed
wards.
Not too many people are impersonating
Edwards these days.
But if Edwards and his close associates
have it their way, they will be soon.
He is, after all, the future of Stanford foot
ball, and people better get used to that.

school-record low 25 yards and never
seemed to know what defense BYU was
throwing at him.
"It was the first game in my life that I never
got settled in to," Edwards said. "I was throw
ing off my back foot, not really throwing a spi
ral and forgetting plays and routes. It was one
of the toughest games I've ever played."
With struggles like these, Edwards has
had to play a lot of psychological games
with himself.
But he's had a plethora of support from
those close to him to help find his way
through the fog.
Edwards' eldest sister, Shelby, played
volleyball at Oregon an annual cellar
dweller in the Pac-10 and persisted
through a similar coaching change as did
Trent when Tyrone Willingham bolted for
Notre Dame in 2001.
"I was talking to her last week, just kind
of frustrated about things, and she gave
me some advice" Edwards said. "It's nice
to have someone that you're real close

with that can share their experiences with
this stuff."
Edwards' father, too, has had a hand in
dealing with Trent's toils. Andy Edwards is
by far his son's biggest supporter and cheer
leader. He frequently attends practice and
comes to every Stanford game.
But that doesn't mean he's some sort of
on-the-rail kind of dad. Andy lends support
in more of a hands-off manner.
"He loves sitting out there eating his
peanuts and watching me play," Trent said.
"His questions are always more like 'did
you have fun at practice' and not more nag
ging ones."
The myriad number of former success
ful Stanford quarterbacks has been anoth
er resource for Edwards. Sunday at a
church service, he met Steve Stenstrom
ironically the last Cardinal quarterback to
win his first freshman start before Edwards
did so.
It was a nice reminder that even the all
time passing leader in Stanford history took
his share of lumps his first go-around.
"He always had dirt in his mouthpiece and
was always on the ground and getting beat
up," Edwards said of Stenstrom's freshman
year. "He's seen those lows."

And, finally, he has the bonds he formed
in high school to draw on for encourage
ment. Edwards receives weekly e-mails from
ex-coach Butch Cattolico and talks to his
best friends from the football team two or
three times a week.
One of those buddies in particular,
Geno Gingery, is playing tight end at
nearby Foothill Community College and
has found time to reassure Edwards that
he is still the same ace QB he played with
at Los Gatos.
"He'll tell me, 'relax man, you aren't in
high school anymore, but your time will
come,' " Edwards said.
Don't think for a minute, however,
that the last year and a half-plus has been
nothing more than a waiting game for
Edwards.
Ehs redshirt year was "kind of a living
hell" since he had to practice and then lift at
7 a.m. four times a week. It was all part of a
learning experience that tried to acquaint
him with the coaches, system, rigor and
speed of college football.
Edwards has also had to modify much
of his mechanics, including his footwork,
release point and stance when releasing
the ball.

The signal caller has finally become famil
iarized with working on game film He's
starting to grasp things he can exploit
slow linebackers, weak corners and effective
routes against certain safeties, for example.
The film drudgery does pay dividends in
game situations, as Edwards has begun to see
firsthand.
"When a defense rolls to a certain cover
age, my coaches will be sitting there [in film
sessions] telling me to check to this route,"
Edwards said. "Then, you check to that
route [in the game] and sure enough, it's
wide open."
Interestingly, there doesn't appear to be
the slightest bit of animosity between the
elder Lewis and the younger Edwards.
When Edwards was answering ques
tions for this story, Lewis wandered over
and provided a little sarcasm. "Man I hate
Chris Lewis that son of a gun," said
Lewis as he jokingly impersonated Ed
wards.
Not too many people are impersonating
Edwards these days.
But if Edwards and his close associates
have it their way, they will be soon.
He is, after all, the future of Stanford foot
ball, and people better get used to that.
Trent Edwards isn't used to this.
He's not accustomed to spending half the game on his
back and the other half running for his life while things
zip past him at a million miles an hour.
He's not trained to drop back to pass, and instead of lo
cating a receiver, almost immediately toss the ball into the
stands.
And he's not familiar with looking up at the scoreboard
at the end of the game and seeing his team behind.
The 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman arrived at Stanford last
year as one of the most highly touted quarterbacks in school
history. He was instantaneously labeled the next Plunkett,
the next Elway, the next quarterbacking hero that alumni

and students would revere for years to come.
And after a year of sitting out and learning the system, it
was his time to step into the spotlight.
But so far, things haven't worked out in such a fairy tale
like fashion.

The numbers only begin to tell the story of Edwards' try
ing, exhausting year.

He has completed only 66-of-139 passes (47.5 percent)
for only four touchdowns and eight interceptions. He is av
eraging only 130 yards per game through the air. And he has
been sacked 11 times in five games and knocked down on
countless other occasions.

These are statistics coming from the same guy who in
high school set the California state record for completion

Redshirt freshman Trent Edwards and the Stanford football team have had little to smile about recently. But Edwards, who
injured his shoulder in Saturday's 24-14 home loss to Washington State, remains optimistic about the future.
percentage (78.1) in a season.
Maybe most importantly, the Cardinal is
now reeling at 2-3 and is 4-12 since Edwards
matriculated at Stanford. (These are sub
.soo numbers from a leader who didn't lose a
game his last two years at nearby Los Gatos
High School.)
And he won't be able to straighten out
anything this week. Edwards will be side
lined from Stanford's game at Oregon to
morrow with a right shoulder injury and will
watch fifth-year senior Chris Lewis start for
the second time this season.
The week off has surely given Edwards
some much-needed contemplation time.
"Someone told me the other day that I
don't really look that comfortable out
there," he said. "They said it didn't seem like
I was having much fun.
"I kind of took that to heart. I need to be
confident with who I am and act like I've
been there before."

The problem is, though, he hasn't been
there before.

Edwards is learning how agonizing the
growing pains of a rookie quarterback can be.
His first-ever road game might be a good
place to start. Playing in front of 65,000 fans
in high-altitude Provo, Edwards threw for a
school-record low 25 yards and never
