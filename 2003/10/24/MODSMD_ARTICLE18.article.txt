## TRENT EDWARDS 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Trent Edwards isn't used to this.
He's not accustomed to spending half the game on his
back and the other half running for his life while things
zip past him at a million miles an hour.
He's not trained to drop back to pass, and instead of lo
cating a receiver, almost immediately toss the ball into the
stands.
And he's not familiar with looking up at the scoreboard
at the end of the game and seeing his team behind.
The 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman arrived at Stanford last
year as one of the most highly touted quarterbacks in school
history. He was instantaneously labeled the next Plunkett,
the next Elway, the next quarterbacking hero that alumni

and students would revere for years to come.
And after a year of sitting out and learning the system, it
was his time to step into the spotlight.
But so far, things haven't worked out in such a fairy tale
like fashion.

The numbers only begin to tell the story of Edwards' try
ing, exhausting year.

He has completed only 66-of-139 passes (47.5 percent)
for only four touchdowns and eight interceptions. He is av
eraging only 130 yards per game through the air. And he has
been sacked 11 times in five games and knocked down on
countless other occasions.

These are statistics coming from the same guy who in
high school set the California state record for completion

Redshirt freshman Trent Edwards and the Stanford football team have had little to smile about recently. But Edwards, who
injured his shoulder in Saturday's 24-14 home loss to Washington State, remains optimistic about the future.
