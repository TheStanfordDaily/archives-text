# CHRIS LEWIS

### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Tomorrow's football game takes place in Eugene, Ore.,
but for senior Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis, it feels like
homecoming.
Autzen Stadium is Lewis' favorite stadium, and for good
reason it was there, two years ago, that he came off the
bench to replace the injured Randy Fasani and helped the
Cardinal overcome a 42-28 second-half deficit to hand the
Ducks its first home loss in four years and end its national
championship hopes.
"I kind of miss [the Oregon fans], I kind of miss Autzen
Stadium," said Lewis, who threw for 189 yards and two touch
downs on that afternoon. "And I know they miss me.
"The thing I most remember is the silence afterward,"
Lewis added. "They had been so ridiculously loud the whole
game. It was kind of scary how silent they were after."
Just as inspired play by Lewis and running back Kerry
Carter silenced the Oregon faithful on Oct. 20, 2001, in
juries, benchings and a suspension silenced Lewis last sea
son. He had to sit out the Cardinal's first game due to a
minor rules violation, was hurt in the second, was pulled
out in the third and fifth and suffered what turned out to be
a season-ending shoulder injury in the sixth. That injury
kept him out of the Cardinal's demoralizing loss at Oregon,
which saw the team surrender 38 first-half points en route
to a 41-14 defeat.
Things have come full circle for Lewis, though, who will
start tomorrow's game as redshirt freshman Trent Edwards
rehabilitates the shoulder injury he suffered last week.
"I thought he did a very nice job stepping into the ballgame
[last Saturday]," head coach Buddy Teevens said. "His atti

at Oregon.
tude has been tremendous, and he's
stayed focused... he's excited, and
we're excited for him."
"It feels good," Lewis said of the
chance to start. "Anytime you get on
the field and help the team out on Sat
urday, there's no feeling like that."
Lewis has gained a lot of perspec
tive since he came to Stanford in 1999.
The 1998 Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year threw a Cal
ifornia-record 107 touchdown passes
during his time at Long Beach Poly,
one of the nation's most dominant
high school football programs. He
even won the Junior Olympics as part
of the USA Volleyball team. Things
haven't always been as rosy at Stan
ford, though.
"It's tough," Lewis said. "I started
playing football when I was 10, and ev
erything came easy to me. From then
until my senior year in high school, I
never had to be in competition with
people.
"Now that it's more difficult, I've
learned that, in football, there's going
to be a lot of adversity in your life.
You've just got to maintain your com
posure and not let it affect who you are
as a person."
Despite his charmed prep experi
ence, Lewis chose Stanford knowing
that he would have to fight for playing
time.
"Todd Husak was here at the time,
Randy Fasani, Joe Borchard," he said.
"I knew all those guys were here when
I chose to come here, but I felt this was
the best spot for me to develop... I've
been fighting the whole way through,
and that's what it's going to take;
That's what it's like at the next level,
too."
In his first two seasons, Lewis
backed up Randy Fasani, usually see
ing playing time only when Fasani was
injured or ineffective.
Lewis played the role to perfection,
leading comeback wins against No. 5
Texas and Southern California as a
redshirt freshman. His sophomore
year proved equally fortuitous, as
Lewis led the Cardinal's stunning
upset of No. 5 Oregon and won three
of his four starts. Over his first two sea
sons, Lewis completed 182-of-367

passes for 2,456 yards, 12 touchdowns
and eight interceptions.
Entering last year, it seemed like it
was Lewis' turn to step into the spot
light, and experts across the country
expected Stanford, running coach
Buddy Teevens' fun-n-gun offense, to
have one of the nation's most produc
tive attacks.
Stanford scored just 20.5 points per
game, though, and won just two
games, its worst showing since 1983.
Lewis played just five games, complet
ing 68-of-139 passes for 712 yards, five
touchdowns and nine interceptions.
"We never quit or anything like
that, we were playing hard throughout
the year, but it just wasn't happening
for us," Lewis said. "People haven't
even seen all the work we've put into it
since the last game of last year...
we've worked a lot of hours and it's
been a lot of pain."
For Lewis, the losing never got any
easier, but it did teach him how to han
dle adversity.
"What I learned from last year is
how to not let the losses affect [life]
outside of football," he said. "Not
walking around with your head down
when you're off the field. Just stand
tall, be proud of who you are and what
you're doing. And that really helped
me, being happy off the field, and that
translates back on the field. You're
able to play better and more relaxed."
Lewis also credits his friends and
family for helping him stay the course.
"I had a lot of off-the-field stuff
going on in my life as well as getting
hurt and not playing," Lewis said. "I
couldn't have done it without them,
getting back and being in the right
frame of mind."
This optimistic attitude and
Lewis' own experiences spelling the
more experienced Fasani helped
Lewis stay positive even after he
was benched for Edwards 11 min
utes into the Cardinal's first game of
the season.
"When it first happened," Lewis
said, "I just kind of reverted back to
[thinking] 'Alright, what was it like
when when Randy was down?' So I
was just like, 'Alright, I'm going to be
supportive, tell him what I'm seeing
out there, give him little tips, because
you want your team to win.' "
"While we're competitors, and we
both want to be on the field at the same
time, I thought it was important that

we maintain a healthy relationship,"
Lewis said. "I'm so glad that's hap
pened."
Edwards, like Lewis, came into
Stanford as one of the most-coveted
recruits in America. And he believes
that Edwards has a tremendous future.
"I'm so excited to see how he's
gonna develop," Lewis said. "He's got
ten valuable experience ... he just
needs to take it and run with it next
year.
Although their names are in
evitably intertwined when the success
of this season's team is discussed,
Lewis and Edwards remain friends,
and Lewis vouches for his protege.
"I think he's a great guy, a great
person, funny. He has good character,
and you can't teach that, you can't beat
that. As long as he keeps being who he
is, he's going to be successful."
Both players know that anything
could happen, and Teevens' com
ments this week admit as much.
"Trent was injured, but it does not
appear significant, and it's just a matter
of how quickly he rebounds" Teevens
said. "But right now, Chris is the guy,
and let's move forward."
Lewis explained that he and Ed
wards are willing to accept whatever
decisions Teevens makes.
"It's not going to affect us," Lewis
said. "We both have to be supportive.
.. the roles are just reversed. We're
friends off the field, regardless."
Despite the past two years' tumult,
Lewis hasn't given up on his childhood
aspirations.
"NFL dreams are my number one
goal," he said. "After the season, I'm
done with school, so I'm going to go
back to L. A., train for the [NFL] Draft,
find a team somewhere and go into
that fight."
For this week, though, Lewis isn't
worried about Edwards, his profes
sional future or anything else. He just
wants to show Autzen he's still got it.
"I'm just going to go out there and
play hard and enjoy myself and play
like I played in the past," Lewis said.
"I'm just going to go out there and try
to get a victory."
Essentially, it's all that "past" that
Lewis is fighting against all that his
tory. The come-from-behind victories,
the less than stellar junior season and
all the talk of Edwards as the Cardi
nal's hope for the future.
For Lewis, the future is now.
Tomorrow's football game takes place in Eugene, Ore.,
but for senior Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis, it feels like

Buddy Teevens' fun-n-gun offense, to
have one of the nation's most produc
tive attacks.
Stanford scored just 20.5 points per
game, though, and won just two
games, its worst showing since 1983.
Lewis played just five games, complet
ing 68-of-139 passes for 712 yards, five
touchdowns and nine interceptions.
"We never quit or anything like
that, we were playing hard throughout
the year, but it just wasn't happening
for us," Lewis said. "People haven't
even seen all the work we've put into it
since the last game of last year...
we've worked a lot of hours and it's
been a lot of pain."
For Lewis, the losing never got any
easier, but it did teach him how to han
dle adversity.
"What I learned from last year is
how to not let the losses affect [life]
outside of football," he said. "Not
walking around with your head down
when you're off the field. Just stand
tall, be proud of who you are and what
you're doing. And that really helped
me, being happy off the field, and that
translates back on the field. You're
able to play better and more relaxed."
Lewis also credits his friends and
family for helping him stay the course.
"I had a lot of off-the-field stuff
going on in my life as well as getting
hurt and not playing," Lewis said. "I
couldn't have done it without them,
getting back and being in the right
frame of mind."
This optimistic attitude and
Lewis' own experiences spelling the
more experienced Fasani helped
Lewis stay positive even after he
was benched for Edwards 11 min
utes into the Cardinal's first game of
the season.
"When it first happened," Lewis
said, "I just kind of reverted back to
[thinking] 'Alright, what was it like
when when Randy was down?' So I
was just like, 'Alright, I'm going to be
supportive, tell him what I'm seeing
out there, give him little tips, because
you want your team to win.' "
"While we're competitors, and we
both want to be on the field at the same
time, I thought it was important that

we maintain a healthy relationship,"
Lewis said. "I'm so glad that's hap
pened."
Edwards, like Lewis, came into
Stanford as one of the most-coveted
recruits in America. And he believes
that Edwards has a tremendous future.
"I'm so excited to see how he's
gonna develop," Lewis said. "He's got
ten valuable experience ... he just
needs to take it and run with it next
year.
Although their names are in
evitably intertwined when the success
of this season's team is discussed,
Lewis and Edwards remain friends,
and Lewis vouches for his protege.
"I think he's a great guy, a great
person, funny. He has good character,
and you can't teach that, you can't beat
that. As long as he keeps being who he
is, he's going to be successful."
Both players know that anything
could happen, and Teevens' com
ments this week admit as much.
"Trent was injured, but it does not
appear significant, and it's just a matter
of how quickly he rebounds" Teevens
said. "But right now, Chris is the guy,
and let's move forward."
Lewis explained that he and Ed
wards are willing to accept whatever
decisions Teevens makes.
"It's not going to affect us," Lewis
said. "We both have to be supportive.
.. the roles are just reversed. We're
friends off the field, regardless."
Despite the past two years' tumult,
Lewis hasn't given up on his childhood
aspirations.
"NFL dreams are my number one
goal," he said. "After the season, I'm
done with school, so I'm going to go
back to L. A., train for the [NFL] Draft,
find a team somewhere and go into
that fight."
For this week, though, Lewis isn't
worried about Edwards, his profes
sional future or anything else. He just
wants to show Autzen he's still got it.
"I'm just going to go out there and
play hard and enjoy myself and play
like I played in the past," Lewis said.
"I'm just going to go out there and try
to get a victory."
Essentially, it's all that "past" that
Lewis is fighting against all that his
tory. The come-from-behind victories,
the less than stellar junior season and
all the talk of Edwards as the Cardi
nal's hope for the future.
For Lewis, the future is now.
Tomorrow's football game takes place in Eugene, Ore.,
but for senior Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis, it feels like
homecoming.
Autzen Stadium is Lewis' favorite stadium, and for good
reason it was there, two years ago, that he came off the
bench to replace the injured Randy Fasani and helped the
Cardinal overcome a 42-28 second-half deficit to hand the
Ducks its first home loss in four years and end its national
championship hopes.
"I kind of miss [the Oregon fans], I kind of miss Autzen
Stadium," said Lewis, who threw for 189 yards and two touch
downs on that afternoon. "And I know they miss me.
"The thing I most remember is the silence afterward,"
Lewis added. "They had been so ridiculously loud the whole
game. It was kind of scary how silent they were after."
Just as inspired play by Lewis and running back Kerry
Carter silenced the Oregon faithful on Oct. 20, 2001, in
juries, benchings and a suspension silenced Lewis last sea
son. He had to sit out the Cardinal's first game due to a
minor rules violation, was hurt in the second, was pulled
out in the third and fifth and suffered what turned out to be
a season-ending shoulder injury in the sixth. That injury
kept him out of the Cardinal's demoralizing loss at Oregon,
which saw the team surrender 38 first-half points en route
to a 41-14 defeat.
Things have come full circle for Lewis, though, who will
start tomorrow's game as redshirt freshman Trent Edwards
rehabilitates the shoulder injury he suffered last week.
"I thought he did a very nice job stepping into the ballgame
[last Saturday]," head coach Buddy Teevens said. "His atti

at Oregon.
tude has been tremendous, and he's
stayed focused... he's excited, and
we're excited for him."
"It feels good," Lewis said of the
chance to start. "Anytime you get on
the field and help the team out on Sat
urday, there's no feeling like that."
Lewis has gained a lot of perspec
tive since he came to Stanford in 1999.
The 1998 Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year threw a Cal
ifornia-record 107 touchdown passes
during his time at Long Beach Poly,
one of the nation's most dominant
high school football programs. He
even won the Junior Olympics as part
of the USA Volleyball team. Things
haven't always been as rosy at Stan
ford, though.
"It's tough," Lewis said. "I started
playing football when I was 10, and ev
erything came easy to me. From then
until my senior year in high school, I
never had to be in competition with
people.
"Now that it's more difficult, I've
learned that, in football, there's going
to be a lot of adversity in your life.
You've just got to maintain your com
posure and not let it affect who you are
as a person."
Despite his charmed prep experi
ence, Lewis chose Stanford knowing
that he would have to fight for playing
time.
"Todd Husak was here at the time,
Randy Fasani, Joe Borchard," he said.
"I knew all those guys were here when
I chose to come here, but I felt this was
the best spot for me to develop... I've
been fighting the whole way through,
and that's what it's going to take;
That's what it's like at the next level,
too."
In his first two seasons, Lewis
backed up Randy Fasani, usually see
ing playing time only when Fasani was
injured or ineffective.
Lewis played the role to perfection,
leading comeback wins against No. 5
Texas and Southern California as a
redshirt freshman. His sophomore
year proved equally fortuitous, as
Lewis led the Cardinal's stunning
upset of No. 5 Oregon and won three
of his four starts. Over his first two sea
sons, Lewis completed 182-of-367

passes for 2,456 yards, 12 touchdowns
and eight interceptions.
Entering last year, it seemed like it
was Lewis' turn to step into the spot
light, and experts across the country
expected Stanford, running coach
Buddy Teevens' fun-n-gun offense, to
have one of the nation's most produc
tive attacks.
Stanford scored just 20.5 points per
game, though, and won just two

like I played in the past," Lewis said.
"I'm just going to go out there and try

Lewis is fighting against all that his

the less than stellar junior season and
all the talk of Edwards as the Cardi
nal's hope for the future.
For Lewis, the future is now.
