# Students organize donor drive
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Standing just 34 inches tall, 21-month-old Chloe Chang is one of the smallest
members of the Stanford community. You might have seen her running through
the arches of the Main Quad, skipping around the Claw or pitter-pattering about
Manzanita Park with her parents, History Prof. Gordon Chang and Vicki Sandin,
who are the resident fellows in Castano.
When Chloe laughs, it is impossible to tell that she is very sick. But doctors at
Stanford Hospital diagnosed her with leukemia last May, at which point 80 per
cent of her bone marrow was infected with cancer.
Chloe endured two sessions of chemotherapy last summer, and the leukemia
went into remission, but this September it returned. Every day, her parents take
her to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital for treatment.
"The disease consumes our life," Chang said. "We are trying to do everything
we can for her."
So are the brothers of Stanford's Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity, Castano res
idents and other student volunteers, who are organizing a bone marrow donor
drive at the end of this month to help Chloe by registering more people, particu
larly underrepresented minorities, on the national database of potential donors.
For the past 10 years, the Lambda fraternity has organized a blood donor drive
in association with the Asian American Donor Program, a non-profit organiza
tion committed to registering Asians in the national donor database. In the past,
the drive has attracted approximately 200 to 300 people, but this year they are try
ing to expand the event to help Chloe find a match.
The drive will not only reach out to undergraduate participants, but also to fac
ulty, staff, graduate students and area residents. The history department, where
Chang teaches, has offered to pay for advertising costs.
"We are trying to get as many people typed as possible," said Kenneth Lee, a
Lambda who is coordinating public relations for the drive.
Chloe's current chemotherapy treatments can only put the cancer back into re
mission; to cure the leukemia, Chloe will need a bone marrow transplant. This
would require a compatible donor someone who has the same type of white
blood cells as Chloe. The chances of finding such a donor are about one in a mil
lion, according to the National Marrow Donor Program.
The probability is particularly low because a matching donor is most likely to
be found within Chloe's ethnic community. Chloe is biracial: Her father is of Chi
nese descent and her mother is of northern European descent. This biracial eth
nicity is underrepresented on the national database of donors. About 52 percent
of people on the national registry are Caucasian, but only 6.5 percent are Asian,
and only 2 percent are multiracial.
Lee's goal is to register at least 500 people, but he said he hopes for more. Eight
years ago, the Lambdas helped bring in about 2,000 people when one of their
