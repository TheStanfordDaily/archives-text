# Students organize donor drive
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Standing just 34 inches tall, 21-month-old Chloe Chang is one of the smallest
members of the Stanford community. You might have seen her running through
the arches of the Main Quad, skipping around the Claw or pitter-pattering about
Manzanita Park with her parents, History Prof. Gordon Chang and Vicki Sandin,
who are the resident fellows in Castano.
When Chloe laughs, it is impossible to tell that she is very sick. But doctors at
Stanford Hospital diagnosed her with leukemia last May, at which point 80 per
cent of her bone marrow was infected with cancer.
Chloe endured two sessions of chemotherapy last summer, and the leukemia
went into remission, but this September it returned. Every day, her parents take
her to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital for treatment.
"The disease consumes our life," Chang said. "We are trying to do everything
we can for her."
So are the brothers of Stanford's Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity, Castano res
idents and other student volunteers, who are organizing a bone marrow donor
drive at the end of this month to help Chloe by registering more people, particu
larly underrepresented minorities, on the national database of potential donors.
For the past 10 years, the Lambda fraternity has organized a blood donor drive
in association with the Asian American Donor Program, a non-profit organiza
tion committed to registering Asians in the national donor database. In the past,
the drive has attracted approximately 200 to 300 people, but this year they are try
ing to expand the event to help Chloe find a match.
The drive will not only reach out to undergraduate participants, but also to fac
ulty, staff, graduate students and area residents. The history department, where
Chang teaches, has offered to pay for advertising costs.
"We are trying to get as many people typed as possible," said Kenneth Lee, a
Lambda who is coordinating public relations for the drive.
Chloe's current chemotherapy treatments can only put the cancer back into re
mission; to cure the leukemia, Chloe will need a bone marrow transplant. This
would require a compatible donor someone who has the same type of white
blood cells as Chloe. The chances of finding such a donor are about one in a mil
lion, according to the National Marrow Donor Program.
The probability is particularly low because a matching donor is most likely to
be found within Chloe's ethnic community. Chloe is biracial: Her father is of Chi
nese descent and her mother is of northern European descent. This biracial eth
nicity is underrepresented on the national database of donors. About 52 percent
of people on the national registry are Caucasian, but only 6.5 percent are Asian,
and only 2 percent are multiracial.
Lee's goal is to register at least 500 people, but he said he hopes for more. Eight
years ago, the Lambdas helped bring in about 2,000 people when one of their

groups are sponsoring a bone marrow donor drive on Chloe's behalf.

bone marrow transplant. A match was
found, but due to complications, Chen
died.
Junior Connie Chan is one of
many students who are helping the
Lambdas organize and publicize the
drive. Chan, a focus assistant in Cas
tano, said she is pitching in "just be
cause I love Chloe."
"I've known her since she was bom

and went to her baby shower," Chan
said. "I play with her a lot. We read lit
tle books and play with these little peo
ple toys she has. She is very energetic
and she loves to laugh."
Chang said he appreciates the sup
port the family has received.
"As an RF, I got to know students
in a much more personal way," he said.
"Now that we have this crisis, we value
their care and support so much."
The crisis began five months ago in
the RF cottage, Chang explained,
when he was reading a book to Chloe.
After he finished the story, she slipped
off his lap and hit her chin on the cof
fee table. The wound didn't stop

bleeding, so he and his wife took Chloe
to the pediatrician. Several tests later,
Chloe was diagnosed with leukemia.
Throughout the treatment
process, "Chloe has been mar
velous," Chang said. "She is so re
silient and positive. She doesn't show
that she knows something is really
wrong. She hasn't been in pain, and
because she is so young, she doesn't
know that it is unusual to be in the
hospital almost every day. She takes it
as a matter of daily hfe."
Though Chloe has had her
"painful moments," said Chang, they
don't seem to have affected her up
beat attitude.

"Through this whole process we
have learned that there is a Stanford
community, and we have learned the
meaning of that community," he said.
The drive will be held from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Oct. 30-31 in White
Plaza. The typing process takes
about 15 minutes and is free. Partici
pants fill out paperwork and give
about five drops of blood from either
their finger or their arm; actual bone
marrow will not be donated on the
day of the drive. A small amount of
blood is taken to determine bone
marrow type.

Within about six weeks, the partic
ipant's name, contact information and

marrow type will be entered into the
national registry. The registry will only
contact a participant if he or she is
found to be an exact match. If so, the
participant will receive information
about the donation process and will
undergo a general physical examina
tion. Potential donors are not required
to donate, and they can withdraw from
the process at anytime.
Junior John Vineyard, a Lambda,
registered at the drive last year. This
September, he was found to be a
match for someone in need of a mar
row transplant. He is currently waiting
for results from his general physical
and said that he has faced no pressure

to donate.
"When I first found out it was real
ly weird," he said. "My parents asked
me if I was sure about wanting to do
nate. But I realized that there's noth
ing in my life that I'm doing that I
couldn't take a weekend off to save
someone's life."
Chang said he hopes for a large
turnout.
"I hope as many people as possible
come for Chloe's sake and for all our
sakes," he said. "There are very few
opportunities in any of our fives to lit
erally save someone else's fife by giv
ing up something we take for granted
every day in our veins."

and said that he has faced no pressure

to donate.
"When I first found out it was real
ly weird," he said. "My parents asked
me if I was sure about wanting to do
nate. But I realized that there's noth
ing in my life that I'm doing that I
couldn't take a weekend off to save
someone's life."
Chang said he hopes for a large
turnout.
"I hope as many people as possible
come for Chloe's sake and for all our
sakes," he said. "There are very few
opportunities in any of our fives to lit
erally save someone else's fife by giv
ing up something we take for granted
every day in our veins."
Standing just 34 inches tall, 21-month-old Chloe Chang is one of the smallest
members of the Stanford community. You might have seen her running through
the arches of the Main Quad, skipping around the Claw or pitter-pattering about
Manzanita Park with her parents, History Prof. Gordon Chang and Vicki Sandin,
who are the resident fellows in Castano.
When Chloe laughs, it is impossible to tell that she is very sick. But doctors at
Stanford Hospital diagnosed her with leukemia last May, at which point 80 per
cent of her bone marrow was infected with cancer.
Chloe endured two sessions of chemotherapy last summer, and the leukemia
went into remission, but this September it returned. Every day, her parents take
her to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital for treatment.
"The disease consumes our life," Chang said. "We are trying to do everything
we can for her."
So are the brothers of Stanford's Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity, Castano res
idents and other student volunteers, who are organizing a bone marrow donor
drive at the end of this month to help Chloe by registering more people, particu
larly underrepresented minorities, on the national database of potential donors.
For the past 10 years, the Lambda fraternity has organized a blood donor drive
in association with the Asian American Donor Program, a non-profit organiza
tion committed to registering Asians in the national donor database. In the past,
the drive has attracted approximately 200 to 300 people, but this year they are try
ing to expand the event to help Chloe find a match.
The drive will not only reach out to undergraduate participants, but also to fac
ulty, staff, graduate students and area residents. The history department, where
Chang teaches, has offered to pay for advertising costs.
"We are trying to get as many people typed as possible," said Kenneth Lee, a
Lambda who is coordinating public relations for the drive.
Chloe's current chemotherapy treatments can only put the cancer back into re
mission; to cure the leukemia, Chloe will need a bone marrow transplant. This
would require a compatible donor someone who has the same type of white
blood cells as Chloe. The chances of finding such a donor are about one in a mil
lion, according to the National Marrow Donor Program.
The probability is particularly low because a matching donor is most likely to
be found within Chloe's ethnic community. Chloe is biracial: Her father is of Chi
nese descent and her mother is of northern European descent. This biracial eth
nicity is underrepresented on the national database of donors. About 52 percent
of people on the national registry are Caucasian, but only 6.5 percent are Asian,
and only 2 percent are multiracial.
Lee's goal is to register at least 500 people, but he said he hopes for more. Eight
years ago, the Lambdas helped bring in about 2,000 people when one of their

bone marrow transplant. A match was
found, but due to complications, Chen
died.
Junior Connie Chan is one of
many students who are helping the
Lambdas organize and publicize the
drive. Chan, a focus assistant in Cas
tano, said she is pitching in "just be
cause I love Chloe."
"I've known her since she was bom

and went to her baby shower," Chan
said. "I play with her a lot. We read lit
tle books and play with these little peo
ple toys she has. She is very energetic
and she loves to laugh."
Chang said he appreciates the sup
port the family has received.
"As an RF, I got to know students
in a much more personal way," he said.
"Now that we have this crisis, we value
their care and support so much."
The crisis began five months ago in
the RF cottage, Chang explained,
when he was reading a book to Chloe.
After he finished the story, she slipped
off his lap and hit her chin on the cof
fee table. The wound didn't stop

bleeding, so he and his wife took Chloe
to the pediatrician. Several tests later,
Chloe was diagnosed with leukemia.
Throughout the treatment
process, "Chloe has been mar
velous," Chang said. "She is so re
silient and positive. She doesn't show
that she knows something is really
wrong. She hasn't been in pain, and
because she is so young, she doesn't
know that it is unusual to be in the
hospital almost every day. She takes it
as a matter of daily hfe."
Though Chloe has had her
"painful moments," said Chang, they
don't seem to have affected her up
beat attitude.

"Through this whole process we
have learned that there is a Stanford
community, and we have learned the
meaning of that community," he said.
The drive will be held from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Oct. 30-31 in White
Plaza. The typing process takes
about 15 minutes and is free. Partici
pants fill out paperwork and give
about five drops of blood from either
their finger or their arm; actual bone
marrow will not be donated on the
day of the drive. A small amount of
blood is taken to determine bone
marrow type.

Within about six weeks, the partic
ipant's name, contact information and

marrow type will be entered into the
national registry. The registry will only
contact a participant if he or she is
found to be an exact match. If so, the
participant will receive information
about the donation process and will
undergo a general physical examina
tion. Potential donors are not required
to donate, and they can withdraw from
the process at anytime.
Junior John Vineyard, a Lambda,
registered at the drive last year. This
September, he was found to be a
match for someone in need of a mar
row transplant. He is currently waiting
for results from his general physical
and said that he has faced no pressure

to donate.
