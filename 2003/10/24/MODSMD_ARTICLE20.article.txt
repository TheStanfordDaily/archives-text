## Look out, Julie plays the wildcard 
### 
On the playing field of life, there are
winners, losers and wildcards.
Wildcards are people who do
shocking and unexpected things in
an otherwise consistent system of rules and
expectations, like when Forrest Gump scored
a touchdown and just kept running. Tanya
Harding was a very wild card, as was Dennis
Rodman. If Stanford football were a wildcard
team, it means the Cardinal would win, unex
pectedly. Buddy made a wildcard move by
naming Chris Lewis the starting quarterback
for Saturday's game at Oregon. Then again,
Trent Edwards has a shoulder injury.
I'm a bit of a wildcard myself. I used to en
list my second-grade "boyfriends" to help me
cheat at handball. They would simply blur the
line between "in" and "out" and I got to stay
in the game longer.
Now I'm a wildcard biker. My tires need

air, I ride on the wrong side
of the road and I run stop
signs. Nope, no turn signals
either. Bad brakes, no night
light and no fancy rotating
glowstick grad student pro
tector helmet. At least I'm
not in violation of California
Vehicle Code VC2l2Olb,
which prohibits operating
bicycles "with handlebars so
raised that the operator

must elevate their hands above the level of
their shoulders in order to grasp the normal
steering grip area." This means children rid
ing old-fashioned bicycles, small people on
big bikes, and dangerous, loitering minorities
riding lowriders and wearing oversized cloth
ing, the last of whom should be punished any
way. Or does that make the law a tool of in
stitutional oppression?
Wildcards challenge our game rules, chal
lenge the dominant paradigm and remind us
that along with the rules come bad calls, foul
play, mean people or in Forrest's case, a big
wide world of alternative rule systems out
there.

It's been an epic week for Stanford wild
cards. Call it coincident with midterms, un
usually good weather or The Stanford Re
view's latest issue.

Shocker #1: No big parties allowed for Big
Game. (No Sir-Mix-A-Lot at the Mausoleum
Party either. Boo.) This makes the adminis
tration the wildcard. We would expect them
to act in our and their best interests, and you
would think that would include an organized,

high-security outlet for everyone to have fun.
! Instead Cal visitors can aimlessly circle Cam
pus Drive loop looking for stuff to do, and
freshmen just may succeed in drinking them
selves to comatose behind closed doors.
Shocker #2: "MEChA: Social Justice
; Group or KKK?" Wow, I thought MEChA
was a Chicano student group that advocates
educational equality. Next The Review will
be telling us Ujamaa is using dorm funds to
\ support Bay Area pimps.
Wildcards play by their own rules, but
they aren't so wily and unpredictable once
you learn a little about them. Here, I'll give
you sentences published in The Review by
pretty damn wild card Alec Rawls (yes, yes,
son of the John Rawls) and you can look for
common themes:
"That is the answer to black crime. Take
out the trash. The more effectively we catch
the criminals the more certain we all can be
that those blacks we encounter in public or
private life are NOT criminal" ("Thinking
Straight About Race," Feb. 26,2003).
"The best thing that most Stanford girls
will ever have a chance to do for the environ
ment is have a baby" ("Abortion 101: True
Pro-Choice," Oct. 15,2003).
Wait, does that make the Sexual Health
and Peer Resource Center anti-environ
ment? If they only distributed condoms to
black students, would crime rates go down?
Wow, I'm shocking myself.
This week I didn't have to, I got my shocks
courtesy of a wildcard professor in the philos
ophy department. Apparently what I wrote
last week about the Teevens-Edwards-Lewis
drama triangle was "tasteless and inaccurate,
with possibly harmful consequence. Much as
I know, it could have legal implications. Bet
ter check with your father. You should apol
ogize to Trent Edwards in one of next week's
Dailies."
I checked with my father, and he's doing
great. A bit of a busy week, but the weather's
been really nice in Southern California.
Shocking as it may be, my father always en
couraged me to think critically and speak my
j â– mind.
But what does he know, it's not like my
dad is John Rawls. He's not even a lawyer.
So ladies in Philosophy 171, don't bother
with your Theory of Justice readings. Instead,
why not go on a jog or visit the stairstepper?
Don't forget, healthy mommies make
healthy babies.
