# Women drop match to UW
## No. 7 Stanford digs 2-0 hole, can't come back against No. 10 Huskies 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday, the Stanford women's
volleyball team was down two games to
zero and on the verge of losing to UCLA
when the Cardinal made an amazing run
to shock the Bruins by winning the match
in five games.
Last night in Seattle, No. 7 Stanford
was in the same situation. Down two
games to zero, the Cardinal came out of
the break to win game three and it ap
peared that it would do the same thing to
the No. 10 Huskies that it had done to the
Bruins a week before.
The Huskies, however, had no inten
tion of allowing the Cardinal to take a
match from them in their home arena and
won an incredibly tight game four to hand
Stanford its first back-to-back losses since
the 2000 season.
Stanford (14-5, 7-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has now lost three conference
matches with the other two coming against
USC last Friday and California two weeks
ago in Berkeley. This match against the
Huskies was the start of the second half of
Pac-10 play for the Cardinal a confer
ence that has proven itself to be the tough
est in the nation with five teams in the na
tion's top-10.
"Playing in such a tough conference is a
double-edged sword," said Stanford coach
John Dunning. "Its no question that you
are going to have more losses, but it also
means that you are more prepared for the
post-season and it's a great conference to
coach in, but you need patience because
you're going to lose some."
In the match, Stanford was again forced

to again play without senior middle block
er Sara McGee, who is out with a foot in
jury and looked out of sync as they opened
up the match with two quick losses. It was
a different Cardinal team than the one
that came out the last time the teams met
a Stanford team that held Washington's
leading hitter Sanja Tomasevic to only 11
kills and a .093 hitting percentage in a vic
tory Sept. 27.
In the first two games, Stanford was
outhit by the Huskies .355 - .191, outdug
41-32 and out-blocked 6.5-5. Further
more, Washington outside hitter Tomase
vic had 14 kills and a .407 hitting percent
age, while Stanford hitters, junior Ogonna
Nnamani and freshman Kristin Richards
hit .266 and .000, respectively, in the two
games.
With its back up against the wall, Stan
ford came out of the break a different
team. Richards, who had only three kills in
games one and two, stepped up as Stan
ford outhit Washington in the game .405 -
.077 to cruise to an easy 30-20 win in game
three, bringing new life to the match.
Game four was a seesaw battle from
start to finish. The teams were locked at
2-2, 3-3 and 4-4 before Stanford finally
took a two-point lead at 6-4. The game
saw four more ties from 22-22 through
25-25. The Huskies, however, managed
to take a slight lead and at 29-27, with
the fans in Seattle on their feet, Wash
ington won the match on a kill from
Tomasevic.
Nnamani rebounded from her slow
start to post a match-high 28 kills, includ
ing eight in Stanford's 30-20 game three
victory.
This loss to the No. 10 team in the coun
try will not help the Cardinal as they trav
el to Pullman, Wash, today for a match
against the Cougars. Washington State
lost to Cal 3-1 last night to fall to 7-13
overall and 3-7 in conference play.
Game time is set for 7 p.m. and KZSU
coverage will be on-line only.
