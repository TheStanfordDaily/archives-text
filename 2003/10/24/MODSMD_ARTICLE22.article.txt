# Water polo welcomes Tritons to Avery
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 men's water polo team faces off against No. 6
UC-San Diego tonight at 5 p.m. at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter. The Cardinal (11-3) has moved up a spot in the rank
ings after its two wins last weekend against UC-Santa Bar
bara and UC-Davis, but is still only 1-1 in league play.
Tonight's game against the Tritons (12-7) is a non
league contest. However, it is a chance for Stanford to im
prove its overall record and prepare for tough matches
next weekend against No. 5 UCLA and No. 4 Pepperdine.
Last weekend presented a lull in what has been a diffi
cult and competitive schedule.
"It's more the placement of games this year," said ju
nior two-meter Greg Crum. "We always play the same
teams. It's not like football. Every year we're going to play
the same tough teams and we'll always play them the same
amount of times ... It starts up again in a couple of weeks
with UCLA and Pepperdine."
Tonight's game is by no means decided. The Tritons are
one of the best water polo teams in the nation, and one of
the best teams outside of the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration.
"Even though they're not in the MPSF, they're a really
tough team. They're definitely the best team not in the
Mountain Pacific," Crum said. "They've got a really good
program. They're always tough."
San Diego narrowly defeated Santa Barbara in then
last meeting, but has yet to defeat Stanford, Cal or USC.
"San Diego had a one-point game in Santa Barbara and

they're pretty good, but if we go out like
we did against Santa Barbara we should
do fine," said sophomore driver Thomas
Hopkins.
Hopkin's brother, Jonathan, is a ju
nior for the Tritons, but there's no ani
mosity between the two.
"He's my brother. I love him. We just
go out there and play a good, hard game."
The two played together at Coronado
High School and have had the chance to
learn each other's playing styles. Hopkins
occasionally attends practices with his
brother and has gotten to know the Tri
ton players.
"We always had a really good high
school team. We'd always work together.
I know all his moves and he knows all my
moves, except for a couple of new ones I
picked up [at Stanford]," Hopkins said.
With many of the nation's top teams
coming from the West coast, the defend
ing national champions have found them
selves facing strong competitors with a
young and largely unseasoned team.
"It's been coming together well,"
Crum said. "We actually watched a tape
of one of our first games this season, and
we're not even the same team anymore;
we've changed so much. Our defense is
10 times better than it was at the begin
ning of the season."
There are many outstanding players
on the team's bench, and the freshmen
have made significant contributions to
this season's play. One of the goals for
this season has been to bring the new
players and those who spend more time
off the bench, into a cohesive, unified

team.
"The freshmen have been doing well,"
Hopkins said. "They all have goals. A
freshman scored our winning goal to beat
Pepperdine two weeks ago. They've been
doing a great job."
Pacing is a key for the Cardinal. Stan
ford needs to come out hard from the
start, but it must avoid overextending it
self. Several critical games have gone into
triple overtime, and the Cardinal's shal
low bench has found itself exhausted and
unable to play at peak performance. Sev
eral players have mentioned the need, for
increased stamina a problem that c-an
be addressed in practice somewhat but
which also comes through playing experi
ence and the mental game.
"Coach always tells us that our bodies
have to be racing but our minds need to
be calm. We need to keep the mindset
where we want it, and go at our own
pace," Crum said.
Expect good matches next week
against UCLA and Peppderdine, who
should be motivated to play their hardest
against the defending national champi
ons.
"I feel like we've improved so much
since the last time we played a really good
team and everyone plays their best game
against us. I don't know why, but they
do," Hopkins said. "I think we should be
able to win out the rest of the season.?
The two top spots in the national poll
are held by Southern California which
has beat Stanford twice, once in the
SoCal Tournament and once in league
play and UC Berkeley which beat
Stanford in the championship game of
the NorCal Tournament after winning its
semifinal game against USC. The Tro
jans, however, also beat the Golden
Bears in a league match.

tough team. They're definitely the best team not in the
Mountain Pacific," Crum said. "They've got a really good
program. They're always tough."
San Diego narrowly defeated Santa Barbara in then
last meeting, but has yet to defeat Stanford, Cal or USC.
"San Diego had a one-point game in Santa Barbara and

they're pretty good, but if we go out like
we did against Santa Barbara we should
do fine," said sophomore driver Thomas
Hopkins.
Hopkin's brother, Jonathan, is a ju
nior for the Tritons, but there's no ani
mosity between the two.
"He's my brother. I love him. We just
go out there and play a good, hard game."
The two played together at Coronado
High School and have had the chance to
learn each other's playing styles. Hopkins
occasionally attends practices with his
brother and has gotten to know the Tri
ton players.
"We always had a really good high
school team. We'd always work together.
I know all his moves and he knows all my
moves, except for a couple of new ones I
picked up [at Stanford]," Hopkins said.
With many of the nation's top teams
coming from the West coast, the defend
ing national champions have found them
selves facing strong competitors with a
young and largely unseasoned team.
"It's been coming together well,"
Crum said. "We actually watched a tape
of one of our first games this season, and
we're not even the same team anymore;
we've changed so much. Our defense is
10 times better than it was at the begin
ning of the season."
There are many outstanding players
on the team's bench, and the freshmen
have made significant contributions to
this season's play. One of the goals for
this season has been to bring the new
players and those who spend more time
off the bench, into a cohesive, unified

team.
"The freshmen have been doing well,"
Hopkins said. "They all have goals. A
freshman scored our winning goal to beat
Pepperdine two weeks ago. They've been
doing a great job."
Pacing is a key for the Cardinal. Stan
ford needs to come out hard from the
start, but it must avoid overextending it
self. Several critical games have gone into
triple overtime, and the Cardinal's shal
low bench has found itself exhausted and
unable to play at peak performance. Sev
eral players have mentioned the need, for
increased stamina a problem that c-an
be addressed in practice somewhat but
which also comes through playing experi
ence and the mental game.
"Coach always tells us that our bodies
have to be racing but our minds need to
be calm. We need to keep the mindset
where we want it, and go at our own
pace," Crum said.
Expect good matches next week
against UCLA and Peppderdine, who
should be motivated to play their hardest
against the defending national champi
ons.
"I feel like we've improved so much
since the last time we played a really good
team and everyone plays their best game
against us. I don't know why, but they
do," Hopkins said. "I think we should be
able to win out the rest of the season.?
The two top spots in the national poll
are held by Southern California which
has beat Stanford twice, once in the
SoCal Tournament and once in league
play and UC Berkeley which beat
Stanford in the championship game of
the NorCal Tournament after winning its
semifinal game against USC. The Tro
jans, however, also beat the Golden
Bears in a league match.
