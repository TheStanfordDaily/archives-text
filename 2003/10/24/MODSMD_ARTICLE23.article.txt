Losing is tough. Being shutout is
tougher. Going into a losing skid is tough
est.
But in the case of the Stanford field
hockey team (3-10,1-2), just playing out its
schedule is tough enough.
Nine of its 13 opponents are ranked in
the top-20 by the National Field Hockey
Coaches Association. Eleven of the 13
have winning records.
Yet the Cardinal has gone out and
played them all with the same high level of
intensity. Unfortunately for Stanford, that
doesn't always show up in the box score.
"It's been a tough season in terms of just
playing competitive teams and very hard
teams," said Stanford head coach Leslie
Irvine. "So to have lost as many games as
many games as we have has been hard. The
scores haven't reflected the progress we're
making."
After playing against nationally-ranked

opponents most of the season, Stanford
faces a struggling Southwest Missouri
State team (4-10,0-3) this week.
"It shouldn't really matter who our op
ponents are," said freshman forward Cara-
Lynn Lopresti. "We should come out and
play the same against every opponent."

The Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence opponents will square off twice this
week as Stanford rounds out its three game
home stand.
The home series kicked off on Home
coming weekend with the annual Alumnae
game, which featured national team play
ers Justina Williams and Christina
Williams. The game served as a nice break
from what has been an arduous season, but
Stanford did not take the game lightly.
"This year we decided to take it more seri
ous than other years because we feel we real
ly need the intensity of a real game so we
didn't actually view it as a light game or as a
break," said senior co-captain Noor Dawood.
After its alumnae game on Sunday, Stan

ford is looking to get back into action and
full form for the remainder of the season.
"It's hard practicing because you don't
really know what you've learned and you
can't apply it," Lopresti said. "So it will be
really good to apply everything that we've
worked on."
The Cardinal will look to avoid its second
five- game losing skid this season by starting
strong against Southwest Missouri State.
"What we've been aiming to do all sea
son is score early in all of our games and get
on top to establish our presence on the
field right away," Dawood said. "I feel like
this is a great opportunity these two games
to do that."
Sophomore forward Lyndsay Erickson
still leads the Cardinal in both points and
goals, with 13 and five, respectively.
Following closely behind is Lopresti
with 12 points and four goals on the season.
Meanwhile, Southwest Missouri State
has not exactly been tearing up the compe
tition. It is ranked last in its conference in

goals scored this season.
Stanford is aware though that the Bears
are able to put up a tough match.
"Records don't necessarily indicate the
strength of the team," Irvine said. "So we'll
treat this team with as much respect as any
other team."
The Cardinal will have to watch out for
senior forward Abbey Rolfe, who is among
the conference's leaders in goals (6) and
points (13).
The Bears also have freshman midfield
er Trupy Adrein, who has tallied 13 points
and 3 goals this season.
Southwest Missouri State is looking to
extend its two-game winning streak this
weekend. In recent weeks, the Bears have
beat a high-scoring Davidson team and
then pulled out an overtime win against
Radford on Sunday.
Southwest Missouri State will face No.
