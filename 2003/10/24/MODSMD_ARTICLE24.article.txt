The women's cross country team
grabbed the No. 1 national ranking in the
latest poll with a victory on Saturday at the
Pre-NCAA meet in Waterloo, Ind., the site
of next month's National Championship
meet. Stanford junior Alicia Craig won the
race, touring the 6,000-meter course in
19:52.6. Fellow junior and teammate Sara
Bei finished two-tenths of a second behind
her to take second place.
The race is intended to give teams a
chance to get a feel for the course, and it also
provides them with an opportunity to come
closer to securing an at-large berth for the
NCAA Championships. The competition
included some of the best teams in the na
tion.
"The meet gave us an opportunity to
learn more about our team and about the
course," said Stanford head coach Dena
Evans. "It also gave some of the freshmen a
chance to run 6,000 meters for the first
time."
Freshman Arianna Lambie, in a perfor
mance Evans called "fearless," finished fifth
overall. Freshman Katy Trotter and junior
Jeane Goff rounded out the Cardinal's scor
ing, finishing 23rd and 35th, respectively.
"The race gave us a good indication of
where our fitness is," Craig said. "It was a
positive race for us, but we have to keep in
mind that November will be different. We
definitely have our work cut out for us."
The men dominated the field, placing six
runners in the top nine to solidify their
supremacy over the rest of the nation. Junior
Ryan HaU finished second overall, coming
in at 23:11.7 on the 8,000-meter course. Se
niors lan Dobson, Donald Sage and Louis
Luchini took spots four through six, and se
niors Seth Hejny and Adam Tenforde fin
ished eighth and ninth, respectively.
Stanford beat 34 other teams, including
nine ranked in the AP's top 25.
"We basically beat an all-star team," said
Stanford head coach Andy Gerard. "Even if
all of the other teams had been combined,
we still would have won."
Senior Grant Robison, who finished
second at the Pre-NCAA meet last year,
was held out of the meet. Gerard said that
Robison's training is progressing well, and
he expects him to make his season debut at
the Pac-10 Championships a week from to
morrow.
The race was a good indicator of fitness
for the men's team.
"It's a good sign that we were able to do
what we did despite the fact that we were
tired from training hard recently," Gerard
said.
