# Soccer set to battle No. 1 UCLA
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
"We gotta play 'em one day at a
time."
It's a fundamental strategy in
sports. If you ask Kevin Costner's
character in "Bull Durham," it's one
of the most crucial cliches to know.
And for the Stanford men's soc
cer team, it will be the plan that will
carry it through the remaining
three weekends of regular season
play.
Entering this weekend's re
matches with No. 1 UCLA (12-1-0,
5-0-0 Pacific 10 Conference) and
Fresno State (4-9-0, 1-4-0 Pac-10)
the Cardinal owns a disappointing 2-
10-2 record overall, and is 0-5 in Pac
-10 action.
The squad's record puts the Car
dinal in jeopardy of not seeing post
season play this year, but that is the
furthest thing from Stanford head
coach Bret Simon's mind.
"To have a chance at the playoffs,
we'd have to run the table and win
the rest of our games," Simon said.
"But we can't focus on that. We have
to focus on playing better and mak
ing better scoring opportunities."
Simon pointed out that the Cardi
nal has not scored in its last four
games, and has been outshot by its
opponents in three of those four
matches.
"Obviously shooting is a problem
for us for whatever reason," fresh
man midfielder Marcus Ryan said.
"We been trying a lot of shooting
drills in practice."
In addition to working the Car
dinal offense's ability to create
goals, the team has been working to
get all of its members healthy. Four
key players were injured in last
week's games against UCLA and
Fresno State.
Simon said Wednesday that
sophomore defender Chad Marshall
and junior forward James Twellman
had trained fully with the team and
were expected to "give it a go" in this
weekend's matchups. Twellman and
Marshall rank second and fourth on
the Cardinal scoring list, respective
ly-
Junior Todd Leber and sopho
more Bronson McDonald are likely
to be able to return to the midfield
for the Cardinal, though junior for
ward and team scoring leader Matt
Janusz is still listed as questionable
to play.
"[Since we played UCLA and
Fresno last week] we know what to
expect from them," junior goalkeep
er Robby Fulton said. "But it's going
to be different for the full game in
terms of us having our regular guys
back."

Last weekend, the then-shuffled
Cardinal team dropped games to the
Bruins and Bulldogs with scores of 3-
0 and 2-0, respectively.
The Cardinal has been evenly
matched with Fresno State, posting a
2-2-1 record in the teams's last five
meetings. On the other hand, Stan
ford has lost its last four contests
with UCLA.
"We got a lot of good chances
[last weekend]," Fulton said. "We
have to take those chances and put
them on frame.
"UCLA is dangerous on offense,

so we're also going to have to tighten
up defensively," he said.
The Bruins potent offense,
which has racked up 35 goals this
season 13 of which are from one
player, senior Matt Taylor is
backed by an equally powerful de
fense, which has allowed only six
goals on the year.
"We're just trying to clean up and
improve, because UCLA is a very
good team," Simon said. "We're
making some adjustments and hope
that will make an impact."
The most important thing for

Stanford, though, will be that'it
keeps its focus on the two games it is
faced with this weekend. ,
"Everybody goes into the season
with high aspirations, so [our record]
is an odd confrontation with reality,"
Ryan said. "So we're just going to
have to approach each game as a
building block."
Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on Friday
night for the Cardinal's rematch
against UCLA and Sunday's game
against Fresno State will begin at 1
p.m. Both games will be played at
Maloney Field.
