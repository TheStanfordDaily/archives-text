# New IKEA a big boon for East Palo Alto
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Anyone who's made the long
trek down University Avenue has
probably spotted the new purple
IKEA that was built over the sum
mer.
Such a recent and imposing addi
tion to the East Palo Alto skyline
begs the question: Is IKEA the be
nign discount furniture seller it pur
ports to be or an auxiliary Swedish
nation-state infiltrating United
States soil?
While six IKEA flags fly outside
and Swedish meatballs are served
u inside, these questions pass through
'' the minds of Stanford students.
"It is the size of an independent
x country," said sophomore Michael
| Laufer. "It has enough square
t footage."
To be precise, the new IKEA en
. compasses 286,000 square feet and is
spread over 10.5 acres of East Palo
Alto soil. While only a few months
old, it has already established strong

ties with the community.
In fact, the homepage for the City
of East Palo Alto prominently dis
plays two large pictures of the
store's opening day celebration.
"IKEA takes pride in its high
level of social responsibility," said
Viviana Coriat, IKEA's community
relations director for East Palo Alto.
According to her figures, the IKEA
in East Palo Alto has already donat
ed $lOO,OOO to charities and another
$54,000 to local schools.
"We are also thrilled to be one of
the largest employers in the East
Palo Alto area," Coriat said. "We are
so happy to have exceeded our ambi
tion with hires from the local area."
More than 500 locals have been
hired to staff the new IKEA, she
says, and $lOO,OOO has been put into
a pre-employment training program.
And, while officials laud the in
creased employment, city officials
are also delighted at the additional
$l.B million in annual sales and
property taxes expected from
IKEA. This money comes in addi

tion to the $1.7 million already gen
erated by the Ravenswood Retail
Center, which includes Best Buy,
McDonald's and The Good Guys.
According to the city's Web site, the
location is the city's "largest rev
enue generator."
Neither Mayor Patricia Foster
nor City Council Members Duane
Bay and David Woods were avail
able for comment on the link be
tween IKEA and East Palo Alto.
But Stanford students readily
commented on the stores pluses and
negatives.
"We were there for five hours,"
said sophomore Nyerr Parham.
"You can't just go in, find what
you're looking for and leave. You
have to go through the entire store.
They suck you in and trap you, like
test monkeys."
Parham exited with a new coffee
table and futon frame. The ware
house workers were unable to find
the futon cushion and cover. Many
students find they have to make re
turn trips to obtain all the parts nec

essary to assemble their purchases.
Laufer, on the other hand, re
ported a successful shopping trip.
"I think it's good [because] they
have cheap furniture," he said. "But
the whole place kind of freaks me
out. It's like a maze."
Laufer walked away from his trip
the proud owner of a new set of
drawers and some glass table lamps.
And as for the Swedes' aspira
tions for global hegemony?
"IKEA currently has more than
185 stores in 31 countries, including
18 in the United States and 11 in
Canada," Coriat said. "Global ex
pansion plans are targeting approxi
mately 15 new stores a year, with the
U.S., Russia and China being large
contributors to expand our world
wide presence, besides our growth in
existing markets in Europe and
Asia."
And, with tongue-pleasing prod
uct names like Verksam (an office
chair) and Granas (a coffee table),
who can help but succumb to
Swedish soft power?
