# Antidepressant use on the rise at Stanford
## 
### EUGENIE KIM 
In the last 10 years, Stanford has seen a dramatic rise
in the number of students seeking psychological coun
seling and using psychotropic drugs such as Zoloft,
Prozac and Wellbutrin, reflecting an increasing trend
among college students nationwide, experts say.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
counsels 10 percent of the student body each year. In
addition, the Bridge, a confidential peer counseling ser
vice with a 24-hour hotline and nighttime drop-in hours,
receives an average of one or two calls a day.
"Through Vaden, there has been a pretty significant
increase in the use of antidepressants at Stanford in the
past 10 years," said Alejandro Martinez, director of
CAPS. "There has also been an increase in the number
of students that are seeking help."
Martinez attributed the trend to greater willingness
to accept psychological assistance from others but
noted that there continues to be a significant number of
people who reject the idea of receiving outside help.
"There is still a proportion of students that have in
dicated to us through surveys that under no circum
stances would they even consider seeking out counsel

ing services that are offered here," he said.
Will, a senior and Bridge counselor who asked to be
identified by only his first name, agreed that many stu
dents feel that they should manage the problem alone.
"I think that the stigma attached to depression
and unhappiness is symptomatic of, basically, the
pressure to be perfect in every way that we often expe
rience at Stanford," he said. "However, it's important to
realize that the point is that feeling completely alone
and helpless is both commonplace and extremely detri
mental."
According to Martinez, the most common issues stu
dents seek help with are interpersonal relationships, de
pression and anxiety.
Experts believe that a school environment can play a
large role in the psychology of its students.
"I was blown away at how nice the people are here,
especially by the fact that it's more common to say good
things than bad things about the school here," said Mike
Le√üeau, a junior transfer from the University of Chica
go. "I think that the nice weather and the safety of this
location add to the background scenery and play a large

part in the campus mood."
His roommate, Jonathan Aroner,
a junior transfer from UC-San
Diego, also said he believes that
school surroundings can encourage
positive emotional health in a stu
dent body.

"I come from a school where 66
percent of students lived off campus,
and it seems to me that dorm living
helps to foster a more caring com
munity atmosphere, so that it be
comes more difficult for depression
to go unseen," he said.
Indeed, Stanford's residential ed
ucation system is specifically de
signed to keep community health in
mind, with resident assistants and
Peer Health Educators undergoing
specialized training to learn how to
deal with psychological issues that
may arise in a dorm environment.
"Most of our training with refer
ence to depression is just learning to
identify it," said junior Mike Endler,
a RA. "If it's something serious
that's out of our realm to help with,
then we can suggest that they talk to
CAPS or the Bridge. The problem
may be that not enough students
seek them out."
The Bridge program has 30
trained counselors, each of whom
volunteers for a number of hours
every week to keep the 24-hour hot
line open and available.
"The Bridge offers call-in and
drop-in hours to talk about any
problem," Will said. "We do not
offer multi-visit treatment, but often
it helps to have a resource when peo
ple feel they can't tell others about
their problems or don't want to bur
den anyone."
The CAPS program also offers 10
free 50-minute visits with a coun
selor for every Stanford student. If
the problem requires more than 10
sessions, CAPS may work out a
long-term counseling plan either on
campus or with a nearby therapist.
But some believe that Health
Services could be doing a better job
with the care of student depression
and anxiety. One student, who
wished to remain anonymous, said
that when he visited CAPS, the
counselor prescribed him a long
term medication to treat his anxiety
before getting a sufficient idea of his
situation.
"They didn't even bother to fax
my physician at home," he said. "In
most cases, drugs only mask the
problem [and] the same could be
said of the psychological services of

fered here on campus. Depression
and anxiety are long-term problems
requiring a serious time investment
in therapy. It's not a 'twice a day'
problem. It's not a 10-session prob
lem."
He recognized that problems in
the current program could be attrib
uted to the enormous size and diver
sity of the population it serves.
"Of course, this is problem of
quantity," he said. "With so many
patients, present or potential,
CAPS cannot match the flexibility
of even the most basic private psy
chologist. They need more ses
sions and more student-friendly
hours."
Martinez said that this student's
experience was an exception, not the
rule.
"The assessment of depression,
and when indicated, prescription of
antidepressants at CAPS, is done
with a great deal of care," he said.
"We believe that it is important that
the students who are prescribed
medication do have regular follow
ups with their doctors."
He added that students must at
tend follow-up appointments to con
tinue receiving medication.
Many believe that the issue of de
pression at Stanford is neither better
nor worse than it is at other schools.
"I don't think that the problem
here is any more severe than it is at
other top universities," said junior
Kristen Carothers, a peer health ed
ucator in Wilbur Hall.
"I don't think you can generalize
about depression on a large-scale
level," said freshman Ale Durand. "I
think it depends on the person. Anx
iety problems come more from a
personal point, not necessarily from
an institution or a school."
Martinez said that the size and
scale of the CAPS program is its
most critical challenge.
"There are times when the de
mand for appointments is very
high," he said. "So sometimes when
they call us, if it is not a crisis where
they feel that they must be seen im
mediately, they have to wait for
longer than our goal of five days or
less before they can have an ap
pointment."
Still, he categorized Stanford as
having one of the best university
programs to deal with student psy
chological issues.
"The student staff makes a big
difference in the emotional health
on campus," he said. "I think that
the immediate availability of CAPS
in crisis situations helps to make
Stanford's one of the better pro
grams in coping with student psy
chological crisis."
