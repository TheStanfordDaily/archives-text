# Antidepressant use on the rise at Stanford
## 
### EUGENIE KIM 
In the last 10 years, Stanford has seen a dramatic rise
in the number of students seeking psychological coun
seling and using psychotropic drugs such as Zoloft,
Prozac and Wellbutrin, reflecting an increasing trend
among college students nationwide, experts say.
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
counsels 10 percent of the student body each year. In
addition, the Bridge, a confidential peer counseling ser
vice with a 24-hour hotline and nighttime drop-in hours,
receives an average of one or two calls a day.
"Through Vaden, there has been a pretty significant
increase in the use of antidepressants at Stanford in the
past 10 years," said Alejandro Martinez, director of
CAPS. "There has also been an increase in the number
of students that are seeking help."
Martinez attributed the trend to greater willingness
to accept psychological assistance from others but
noted that there continues to be a significant number of
people who reject the idea of receiving outside help.
"There is still a proportion of students that have in
dicated to us through surveys that under no circum
stances would they even consider seeking out counsel

ing services that are offered here," he said.
Will, a senior and Bridge counselor who asked to be
identified by only his first name, agreed that many stu
dents feel that they should manage the problem alone.
"I think that the stigma attached to depression
and unhappiness is symptomatic of, basically, the
pressure to be perfect in every way that we often expe
rience at Stanford," he said. "However, it's important to
realize that the point is that feeling completely alone
and helpless is both commonplace and extremely detri
mental."
According to Martinez, the most common issues stu
dents seek help with are interpersonal relationships, de
pression and anxiety.
Experts believe that a school environment can play a
large role in the psychology of its students.
"I was blown away at how nice the people are here,
especially by the fact that it's more common to say good
things than bad things about the school here," said Mike
Le√üeau, a junior transfer from the University of Chica
go. "I think that the nice weather and the safety of this
location add to the background scenery and play a large
