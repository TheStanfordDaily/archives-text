## L.A. police sort out shooting 
### BRAD GREENBERG ROBERT SALONGA DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) Police are investi
gating a shooting that occurred
early Saturday morning, leaving
one person wounded and marking
the second shooting incident in two
weeks in the UCLA area.
Shots were fired in front of the
UCLA Sigma Nu fraternity house
at about 2:26 a.m., according to
University police and eyewitnesses.
The shooting victim was de
scribed as a male non-student who
suffered a wound to his ankle.
The victim was transported to a
local hospital and is in good condi
tion, according to the Los Angeles
Police Department, which is inves
tigating the shooting.
The shooting happened at the
tail end of a party held in the frater
nity house but not hosted by
UCLA's Sigma Nu chapter.
Shortly after, shots were fired in
parking Lot 8, which is located
about two blocks east of the frater
nity house. No one was hurt, ac
cording to university police, which
is investigating that incident.
Police would not comment on
whether the two incidents were re
lated, but eyewitnesses said that ap
pears to be the case.
According to a witness, police
began clearing out partygoers in
front of the fraternity house shortly
after the other incident. â€¢
Jonathan Forney, a junior and
social chairman of the nearby Beta
Theta Pi fraternity, said he saw the
events unfold from his vantage
point on one of his house's bal
conies, which has a clear line of vi
sion of both Sigma Nu and Lot 8.
Forney said that as police began
to disperse people from the party,
people started running from the
house and some on the east side of
the street ran toward Lot 8.
He added that he heard a gun
shot come from the general area of
the parking garage, followed by

cars speeding out of it.
Sigma Nu did not sponsor the
party where the shooting occurred.
House manager Sarman Bravo-
Karimi said the building was rented
out to party-management group 3
Tha Hard Way, which is run by
UCLA students. Bravo-Karimi,
who attended the party, added that
it attracted people from throughout
Los Angeles, and said 3 Tha Hard
Way conducted intense advertising
for the event.
A phone message left on Satur
day for 3 Tha Hard Way was not re
turned.
The group's Web site billed the
event at the Sigma Nu house as
"The UCLA Blue and Gold Bash."
Derrick Klunchoo, a junior and
Sigma Nu member, said most of the
fraternity members were out for the
night and not present at the party
going on in their house.
Fraternity officials agreed the
party was unmanageable for most
of its duration, due in part to the
amount of people present both in
side and outside, which according
to rough estimates totaled as many
as 800 people. "It was out of con
trol, from the get-go. There were
too many people there," said Mark
Hardin, director of risk manage
ment for the Interfraternity Coun
cil, who stopped by the party in its
early stages.
"[There were] probably a lot of
people there who couldn't get into
the party and thought they should,
and they're drinking," he said, "so
that's just asking for stuff to go
down."
Bravo-Karimi said the party in
side the house was alcohol and drug
free, and that security was instruct
ed not to admit anyone who was
under the influence. "Pretty much
everyone seemed sober," he said.
But the crowd outside the house
which Bravo-Karimi estimated
to be as many as 200 people was
less regulated.
Hardin said the large amount of
people spilling into the street was a

large part of why Black Sunday a
tradition in which fraternities throw
raucous kick-off parties before the
alcohol-free fall rush period has
been cancelled for the past two
years.
Another factor, highlighted by
Saturday's incident, was the attrac
tion of out-of-towners, he said.
The aftermath of the scene in
which police closed off much of the
street in front of the house pre
vented many members of Sigma Nu
from returning home. Many, in
cluding Klunchoo, had to find other
accommodations for the night.
Other students were left strand
ed for a ride home later in the morn
ing, since Lot 8 was closed off as
university police investigated the
shooting incident there. At 10:15
a.m., four students of the Fashion
Institute for Design and Merchan
dising could be seen sitting on the
curb in front of Lot 8, denied access
to their car that was parked in the
garage.
"We've been waiting since 8
a.m.," said Brooke Barney, a fresh
man who attended a nearby party in
Westwood, Calif., the previous
night with her three roommates.
"The cops said it would take two
hours."
But as of late Saturday morning,
they were out of luck.
They began calling for a taxi to
their home in Burbank, Calif., and
called to arrange people to fill in for
them at their jobs.
The incident was the second
shooting incident at or near UCLA
in the past two weeks.
On Oct. 5 a university police of
ficer in Kerckhoff Hall shot an al
leged trespasser, who police said at
tacked the officer. In that case the
alleged assailant, Willie Davis Fra
zier, pled not guilty Wednesday to
charges of assault and removing an
officer's weapon. He now awaits a
preliminary hearing as LAPD con
tinues to investigate the incident.
