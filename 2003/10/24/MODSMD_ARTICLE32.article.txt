# New York law tags, tracks kegs

### JOE CONNOLLY DAILY ORANGE 
(U-WIRE) It's a rivalry of
seemingly epic proportions a squad
of politicians and concerned citizens
against the indomitable rogue known
only as underage drinking. But New
York state lawmakers have a new card
up their sleeve, a weapon designed to
bring an end to the ancient battle.
A new bill, signed into law by Gov.
George Pataki on July 25, will require
beer retailers to attach to beer kegs a
special registration tag that will identi
fy the name and address of the retailer
and the name of the buyer.
Slated to go into effect in late No
vember, the legislation aims to curb il
legal keg sales to minors by placing the
responsibility of the keg's where
abouts on the buyer whose name is
printed on the keg or appears on the
tag attached to the keg.
In addition, those purchasing the
keg must sign a statement saying they
understand and will comply with un

derage drinking laws. The seller must
also keep records of each keg sold, in
cluding the buyer's license number
and the amount of beer sold.
"The law puts pressure on drinkers
and sellers," said Lt. Grant Williams of
the Department of Public Safety.
"Kegs will have to be identified, which
gives more control over who's pur
chasing the beer."
According to the 2002 National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse,
64.1 percent of full-time college stu
dents drank alcohol compared with
54.3 percent of persons 18 to 22 who
were not currently enrolled full-time.
The scene that often confronts Pub
lic Safety officers after a particularly
rowdy party may become a thing of the
past. An abandoned keg and no one
leaping to claim responsibility for the
alcohol is a potential dead end for offi
cers, Williams said.
"I don't know if the law will put a
stop to the amount of beer being con
sumed on campus," Williams said.
The new legislation will, however,

make every keg traceable, creating an
obstacle for underage buyers attempt
ing to get their hands on a keg, he said.
The actual levels of enforcement
are still being studied and debated, said
Mark Anderson, public information
officer for the New York State Liquor
Commission.
The law calls for a $75 deposit for
each keg, which is refundable upon
the keg's return, and a $250 to $450
fine if the tag is missing or damaged in
any way. The owners of businesses
that do not complete the registration
process properly would be charged
with a misdemeanor.
The legislation, while new to New
York, has already been implemented
in several states, and more states have
attempted to pass similar bills into law.
"Our bill got hung up in the last
stages," said Montana State Rep. Ros
alie Buzzas, the main proponent be
hind the bill in her state. "Underage
drinking is a huge problem in our state
because access to kegs is relatively easy
and we have no way to track them."
