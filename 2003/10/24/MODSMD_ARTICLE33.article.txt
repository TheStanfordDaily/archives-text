"Woman masturbates to concept of
commitment." "Mary Kate Olsen
weighing Ashley down." "Special
Olympics tee ball stand pitches per
fect game."
Dress was casual at New School
University's Tishman Auditorium last
night as five writers of The Onion, the
popular satirical weekly newspaper,
clumsily stumbled onto the stage to
join author Eric Alterman for a talk.
Set to air on C-SPAN in coming
weeks, the panel discussion encom
passed discourse on everything from
media bias to drunk people, but was
largely focused on file history and
publication process of The Onion,
which began in 1988.
The panel of six, which included

the paper's editor-in-chief, Carol
Kolb, appeared before a sold-out
crowd of about 500.
And if you haven't guessed it yet,
the above headlines are the kind rou
tinely found in the bitingly sarcastic
mock-paper, which recently moved to
the Big Apple from its birthplace in
Madison, Wis.
Kolb and her colleagues spent the
majority of the 90-minute conference
discussing the finer points of publish
ing the cult phenomenon, including
the process of writing collaboratively,
making fun of politics and saying what
they want without fear of censorship.
"It takes a village to write ITie
Onion," Kolb explained, adding that
every fictitious story they publish be
gins with a group headline brainstorm.
This free-thinking process has car
ried The Onion from a small-town
prank sheet with headlines like "Pen

stolen from study area" to a national
icon that boasts more than 1.5 million
readers a week.
The speakers spent a considerable
amount of time discussing their re
sponse to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
While The Onion didn't publish until
two weeks after the attacks, the speak
ers explained, they were able to re
spectfully use humor as a cathartic
tool for dealing with the tragedies.
The staff cited some of their fa
vorite post-Sept. 11 headlines for the
audience, which roared with collective
laughter. Notable headlines included
"Hijackers surprised to find selves in
Hell," "God reiterates 'no killing'
rule" and "Life turns into bad Jerry
Bruckheimer movie."
"You've got to make people laugh
first. Then you make them think,"
said John Krewson, a longtime
Onion staff writer.
