# Editor's (Suicide) Note
## 
### 
When I began working with my co-editor Nicole Beckley,
neither she or I knew that she would eventually drive me to
my death. Some would argue that there were subtle indica
tions all along: We had quarreled over how much we could
airbrush J Lo's butt; we had almost slit each other's coffee
drips over how many expletives we could accommodate in
one sentence; we had joked about an Olson Twins issue and
not repented. Things reached a head, however, when Nicole
suggested that we should-celebrate Sylvia Plath's death with
a special issue.
"I think the way she died, was like, totally cool," she said.
"I don't think we need to talk about her rap and stuff. Though
that nursery rhyme - "Daddy" - that was some hot shit."
While I am taken with the idea that Intermission is the cus
todian of stereotypes, and that we must uphold the tradition

of sidelining Sylvia's brilliant writing in favor of her grue
some suicide, I was saddened by the phrase "hot shit." Its in
tended poignancy was lost on me, as was everything else in
our hot-boxed Intermission office.
That was when I wrote my first note. And then a second.
Then, eventually, an anthology of drafted, un-publishable
deaths. Being a punctilious writer, I would have gladly filled
my little knapsack with many more such notes and incurred
the jealousy of the rock star community (kudos to Elliot
Smith, by the way) - but, like a true friend, Nicole intervened
in my hour of need.
"Karan, the deadline for your suicide note is almost up,"
she reminded me, smiling coyly as she dug into her bowl of
goldfish.
I panicked. I turned to the one bastion of truth left in this

world - Microsoft Word - but found no solace: It refused to
help me with the syntax of suicide. Heartbroken, I called the
coroner, read my unpolished draft to him on the phone and
asked him if it deserved an A+. He said: "Dude, not even
Kurt Cobain got that. And he was, like, in a band and stuff,
right?"
That rhetorical question irked me- did I have to be famous
to commit suicide? Or would my suicide note ensure my fame?
In my last hours, I found such weighty thoughts haunting me.
So, I asked myself what any rational person would ask himself
in such a situation: "What would Sylvia do?"
Now only if I could write poetry and bake a cake. Dammit.
Goodbye,
Karan Mahajan

Nicole's afterthought to Karan's note:
Dear Cruel, Cruel World:
There's a number of things that really make a person think about ending it all. In my
younger days it was the break-up of the Spice Girls, which came only too shortly after
the realization that the band Hanson was comprised of BOYS (not the "cute girls" most
people thought they were.) That was a total shock to my already-ailing system.
As I got older, I got semi-suicidal while studying Dante's "Inferno" for a whole quar
ter- nine weeks of literal hell. Dante himself probably wished he was dead. And he was.
Now it's the looming threat of the expungement of SAE. I hate to even imagine not
being able to be groped in the dark and have beer spilled on me. Seriously, what is left
to live for? How can one go on with events like these occuring in the world?
It's enough to make me consider throwing myself in front of the Margueriteâ€”
though that would probably just put a bad dent in the bumper.
What's a girl to do?
So, with that I think I'll just go ahead and call it quits. Hang up my hat. Turn in my
keys. Put my car in the garage.
Oh wait... "Friends" is 0n... gotta go.
Because the truth is, when there's so much good art and entertainment out there, it
makes life completely worth living.
Yours truly,
Nicole Beckley
PS. Don't cry your heart out. Karan will be back next week. I hear he's bringing
cake.
