# Too much static on this 'Radio'
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
Sometimes, an enthusiastic crowd has a
way of carrying you with it. They clap, they
cheer, the spirit sweeps you up, and soon
you're clapping and cheering too. Sometimes,
though, you just wonder what the hell is wrong
with them. The crowd at "Radio" was the sec
ond kind of crowd.
The film opens with the camera on Cuba
Gooding Jr. (and any prayer he had of re
deeming himself as an actor). He's walking
duck-footed down the railroad tracks,
pushing a shopping cart, gri

macing to reveal badly
faked buck teeth. A\
train comes, his eyes
bug out and he falls all
over himself to avoid it.
To his credit, Gooding
appears to draw inspira
tion from both the old
and the new - from the
time-honored stereo

type of the village idiot to the recently intro
duced but already well-loathed Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar drew some fire for his resemblance to
the buffoons of black minstrel shows, and I
wish I could say that resemblance is absent
here.
Gooding plays a real-life mentally disabled
man named James Robert "Radio" Kennedy,
whose love for transistor radios and football
made him a fixture on the campus of Hanna
High School in Anderson, S.C. There he be
friended football coach Harold Jones (here
played by Ed Harris), and the relationship
grew to enrich their lives and those of every

one in Anderson.
But not ours. We have to watch an hour of
total non-event as Radio becomes a kind of
honorary member of the football team. He
takes plenty of goofy pratfalls, but we don't
see any real development in his or Jones's
character here. When Principal Daniels (Alfre
Woodard) accuses Jones of making Radio lit
tle more than a mascot, the criticism hits home.
During this hour of tedium, we find ourselves
wondering what's in this deal for Jones - he
says he's just trying to do the right thing, but
why neglect his own daughter (newcomer
Sarah Drew) in favor of a man he's just
met? And doesn't Jones's backwoods
Southern town have something to say about
this relationship?

The film eventually deals with these
questions, but not before force-feeding us
a lot of footage of Radio that manages to
be both dull and exploitative. When Toll in
finally remembers that movies should have
conflict, the problems are resolved too
quickly and cleanly to be satisfying.
"Radio" is that rare movie that aims

at cliche and misses. Radio is the unconven
tional hero who broadens the hearts and minds
of those around him - except he doesn't really
change things all that much. Jones is the men
tor who saves both his charge and himself, but
we don't get the sense that Radio was ever in
special need of saving.
All we get is Gooding's Jar Jar routine, a lot
of folksy folks who hang out in barbershops,
and an uninspiring Ed Harris - I hope he
dreamt of "The Truman Show" while sleeping
through this role. Everyone's shot in the warm
colors of a Country Living magazine, and
backed up by a soundtrack with three settings:

croon, tinkle and swell.
At one point, Principal Daniels asks Coach
Jones, "Why on earth are you doing this?" I want
ed to ask the filmmakers the same question.
My fellow viewers, however, seemed unper
turbed. They laughed when Radio squeaked like
a football whistle. They clapped when the not-so
bad villains got their not-so-comeuppance. I can

only conclude that it's possible to fill a theater
with people who can enjoy "Radio."
Maybe you're one of them - there's really
only one way to find out. I can't, however, in
good conscience recommend that you put
yourself to the test. The risk is simply too
great.



So, who's your dentist?
