# This film is not even 'Close'

### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"So Close," the directorial debut from ac
tion choreographer Corey Yuen, contains
maybe half an hour of pure cinematic beauty
in the form of fast, violent, near-perfect ac
tion. Too bad that it's surrounded by 80 min
utes of unbearably melodramatic crap.
The film's first extended sequence is
probably its best: a hacker calling her

self the Computer Angel
(Shu Qi) gains admit-
tance to the headquarters
of an evil corporation,
only to reveal that she's
an assassin come to mur
der the president of said
corporation. The ensuing
violence is slick, giddy
fun: the sisht of Shu hans-

ing upside down from the ceiling, a pistol in
each hand, while the Carpenters' "Close to
You" plays and the wind blows through her
hair, is breathtaking yet sublimely ridicu
lous, as is her highly improbable airborne
escape.
After that, everything goes to hell.
"So Close" spends way too much time on
soap opera scenes of unspeakable badness,
centering largely on the volatile relationship
between the Computer Angel, whose real
name is Lynn, and her younger sister Sue
(Zhao Wei), and, even worse, the romance

between Lynn and the heartthrob-wannabe
Yen (Song Seung Hun). Not that I'm op
posed to brainless, boring cheese, but it takes
itself so unbearably seriously, I start to lose
my patience. And when that cheese stretch
es out for most of the film, my enjoyment of
the far too infrequent - but admittedly beau
tiful - action sequences is tainted.
Some might suspect that, since I'm not

familiar with the babes-kicking-ass
i genre of Hong Kong cinema from
which "So Close" springs, I just
ion't "get" the film's soap opera ele
ments. But the material doesn't
feel foreign at all. It's woefully fa
miliar, echoing the emotional
filler from the latest infantile Hol
lywood blockbuster du jour.
Particularly Hollywood-ized is the
way the film bludgeons you with
J its muddled, hypocritical morality,

which wants to have it both ways: Assassi
nation is evil, except when we really don't
like the targets. Obviously, the ethics of an
action movie shouldn't really matter, but
the characters just can't stop talking and
whining about it. And I don't think I'm the
only one who hated the film's ending, when
a worldwide surveillance system gets hand
ed over to the police. Yikes.
So this is definitely a wait-for-the-DVD
movie. Then you can fast forward through
the beautiful babes babbling inanely and
skip straight to the ass-kicking.


Damn, if only we' a made it as extras in "Kill Bill"
