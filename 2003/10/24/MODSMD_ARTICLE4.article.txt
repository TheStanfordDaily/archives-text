# Tri-Delts wage 'war' on cancer

### CHRIS NGUYEN 
The Delta Delta Delta sorority has been raising
money for St. Jude's Hospital to research and treat pe
diatric cancer this week through its Penny War
fundraiser in White Plaza.
According to the National Cancer Institute, an
agency of the federal government, pediatric cancer
rates have increased by 31 percent in the last quarter of
a century. But thanks to advances in medical treatment
in that time, pediatric cancer death rates have decreased
by 48 percent.
"Our sorority made a commitment to cancer re
search," said senior Veronica Alaniz, president of Tri-
Delt. "Tri-Deltas all around the United States are cele
brating St. Jude's Hospital this week. This penny war is
happening across the nation."
She added that the drive benefits the campus as well
as local hospitals.
"It is a fun and friendly competition that promotes
class unity and raises money for a great cause," Alaniz
said. "All the money raised will be donated to St. Jude's
Hospital on behalf of the winning class."
Freshman Jonathan Gibbs said he applauds the Tri-
Delts for their efforts in organizing the fundraiser.
"It's an ingenious method of utilizing class rivalry to
improve the world," he said. "With the low denomina
tions, it will raise awareness by getting everyone to par
ticipate."
Each class receives one point for every penny it con
tributes. By donating nickels, dimes, quarters and dol
lars, students can take points away from other classes.

The Tri-Delts will donate the money from the Penny
War in the name of the class with the most points at the
end of the week.

Although the Tri-Delts have conducted the Penny
War primarily in White Plaza, they have gone else
where in efforts to collect more money for St. Jude's.

"We've been going to dorms and collecting money
from people who have open doors," said junior Jessie
Juusola, a Penny War coordinator.

Junior Maria Orduna, Tri-Delt
philanthropy chair, said she
hopes to raise $3OO for cancer re
search through this event and to
raise awareness about pediatric
cancer.

"We are just happy to get the
word out about children's cancer,"
Orduna said.
