## How Plath got her groove back: Intermission interviews Director Christine Jeffs 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
My alarm clock buzzes and I glare at it with one eye still closed from
underneath the layer of warmth from my comforter. I roll over and think,
"Great, I have to get up, go have lunch at the Ritz and interview an up
and- coming director." My life is so tough.
It's a foggy day in San Francisco, cold and a bit overcast, and I make
sure my jacket is wrapped tightly around me as I head up the hill to the
Ritz Carlton. Some guy yells at me, "Hey! You got it goin' on!" as I pass
by, clad in a leather jacket, boots and a mini skirt, a few yards from the
hotel entrance. This sort of thing would never happen outside the Four
Seasons.
Finally, I'm inside and I get to meet the director herself, Christine Jeffs.
After experiencing huge acclaim with her first directed feature, "Rain"
(2001), and being named one of Daily Variety's "10 Directors to Watch,"
the New Zealand filmmaker and I sit down to find out the truth about
"Sylvia."
INTERMISSION: What is it like to be a director attempting to recre
ate a part of history?
CHRISTINE JEFFS: There's a certain amount you can do. I think
tone and emotional truth are the key areas and obviously casting
... as far as the story, the script was already set up and ready to go
... but the approach and how you open it up and bring it to an audience
was the option that was given to me.
INT: So it was your decision then to cast Gwyneth Paltrow?
CJ: No, Gwyneth cast me actually. She was on-board the picture, and
she cast me.
INT: How did that come about?
CJ: She saw my first movie "Rain" and she really loved it, so I think it
was on the basis of watching that movie.
INT: When you say "emotional truth" - what do you mean?
CJ: Well, I think that a lot of the scenes are based on fact... the
movie's all about opening up feelings within those things [that happened
in their lives]. One of the things I really sought to find was emotional truth

between the actors in those moments. I did a lot of reading of "Ariel" and
"Birthday Letters" and allowed myself to feel all that emotion that's in the
writing... then it's not just a matter of putting a camera there and so on
... Instead, you ask "what were these people going through?", "what were
they feeling?", so it becomes very grounded and a very live kind of emo
tion. Sometimes, I would find one line of poetry particularly relevant for
one scene, and [use] the feeling that came out of that line.
INT: There's a great scene where Sylvia recites Chaucer to a herd of
cows - was it difficult trying to bring poetry to life on film and give it an
"edge"?
CJ: Well, I didn't want it too stuffy. There's a bit of poignancy and a bit
of an edge and [I wanted to] take it like they're young and having fun with
it, and imbibe that with poetry - it was part of their life.
INT: There's that whole scene where they're just smoking and drink
ing and reciting poetry - it was definitely my favorite scene.
CJ: I love the scene where she's getting the washing and the little girl's
helping her. I like the real little moments like that. I guess my favorite
scene is with A 1 Alvarez (Plath's publicist in the film) - when she makes a
pass at him.
INT: How would you say that "Sylvia" is relevant today? Do you think
audiences today are more responsive thanks to films like "The Hours"
where literary history is retold visually?
CJ: Yeah, I think so because it's a very tragic love story and if you look
at it like these two people loved each other deeply but they just couldn't
live together - that's the story of a lot of people's lives.
INT: What was the biggest challenge that came with "Sylvia"?
CJ: It was very intense in terms of emotional territory. When you're
dealing with real characters, getting the tone right is a big responsibility.
Being aware that it's not fictional... but at the same time making it rele
vant to an audience. It was a tight schedule - 52 days ... so we hajl to go
for it.
INT: Do you have any advice for young filmmakers?
CJ: It's all about the heart really... unless you're going to do a big spe
cial effects movie. [Otherwise] get as close to your subject as you can.
