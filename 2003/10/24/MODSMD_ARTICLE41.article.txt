# Dying is an art and Paltrow is a true artist
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
The first frame of "Sylvia" focuses on a half
hidden face and we hear Gwyneth Paltrow say:
"Dying is an art, like everything else I do it ex
ceptionally well." With this we know that direc
tor Christine Jeffs's film about the life and suicide
of poet Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not
going to be a happy film. And there will probably
not be a secret surprise ending.
"Sylvia" is crafted largely as a love story, ex
plaining the relationship between the titular poet
and her poet husband, Ted Hughes (Daniel
Craig). From the first time they meet, in a crowd
ed dance hall, their relationship is somewhat
volatile - boy meets girl, boy steals girl's earring,
girl bites boy. Obviously, they are in love.
Jeffs takes the historical events in the authors'
lives and turned them into a beautiful fiction.
Jeffs heroically tackles the supremely difficult
task of making a movie about someone who dies
a tragic death. She employs lighting that is both
subtle and beautiful, and costuming that plays
perfectly into revealing the passage of time as
their life events unfold.
Sylvia and Ted challenge each other and keep
one another on their toes. Plath needs Hughes
and he is largely her teacher, introducing her to
the wonder of words. The film strives to convey
the impact and importance of poetry', even going
so far as to liken poems to explosions.

"Just imagine if a sonnet went
off accidentally," a
Sylvia remarks.
Poetry, she \
would have us
believe, bears
the same rela
tion to her gen
eration as
freestyling does
to ours.
The film fol
lows the couple

as their relationship develops. As Hughes experi
ences writing success, he and Sylvia decide to get
married. Sylvia's disapproving mother, played by
Paltrow's real life mom (Blythe Danner), frowns
upon her marriage to Hughes, foreshadowing his
sexual indiscretions and cautioning him to "be
good to her always," in a note that echoes
throughout the film; the tone becomes even dark
er as she reveals Sylvia's past suicide attempts.
We begin to see that the confident Sylvia who has
graced the screen has another side.
When Ted takes a teaching job, attracting
many female admirers, Jeffs builds a menacing
undertone which haunts Sylvia, as she becomes
ever-skeptical of his fidelity. Paltrow becomes
tense and cold, perfectly capturing the emo
tional conflict Sylvia must have felt within her
self. She becomes paranoid and subtly mania
cal, almost driving him to the extra-marital af
fair that ensues.
What Jeffs does so beautifully, so poetically,
is integrate Sylvia's family life without having it
negatively affect the picture or the story. It is
there and it is relevant, but it doesn't take prece
dence over the main idea of the film: Sylvia lived
more than she died. Paltrow drives the film with
her inspired portrayal of the self-tortured poet.
She keeps a perfect doubting, contemplative
look about her for the entire film, and it's no
wonder that she is already earning Oscar nom
buzz for the performance. Paltrow is nothing
short of sublime.

The success of "Sylvia" lies largely in that it is
depressing. Apart from the poetry, there are only
a few truly outstanding pieces of dialogue, but as
a whole, the picture never falters. Jeffs slowly un
wraps her story in a way that is both heart
wrenching and intriguing. But when all is said and
done, it is truly Palrow that gives "Sylvia" life.
