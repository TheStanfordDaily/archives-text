# Middlebrook tackles Sylvia's husband
## Was Sylvia 'a nutter'?: A literati doyenne says it's more complicated 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
A while back it was reported that when
feminist Camille Paglia was asked what she
would do if she were endowed with a penis
for a day, she replied that she'd hurry to find
French sexpot Catherine Deneuve. Some
women must feel the same way about Diane
Middlebrook, judging by how the mostly fe
male audience was hanging onto the stylish
Stanford English Prof. Emerita's every
word at the recent reading (Oct. 18) of her
brand new book on the marriage of Sylvia
Plath and Ted Hughes.
In "Her Husband: Hughes and Plath, Por
trait of a Marriage"( New York: Viking,
$25.95), Middlebrook traces the explosive,
"bang-smash" attraction which fueled the
1956 union, the painful dissolution of the mar
riage, and the fallout of Plath's 1963 suicide.
While Plath received a rare posthumous
Pulitzer for her "Ariel" poems, Hughes went
on to reach creative heights with works such
as his 1998 smash lit hit, "Birthday Letters."
"I wanted to write a book that was based
on the survival of a great love-in the imagi
nation of the survivor," Middlebrook ex
plained. She sees Plath's suicide as leading
Hughes to stretch his creative powers. Mid
dlebrook would contest the legion of
"Ariel" devotees who finger Hughes as the
direct cause of Plath's suicide. As she began
to write her book, Middlebrook thought of
Hughes, "He is ready to be understood."
In the cozy alcove of the Stanford book
store, before a few dozen of rapt listeners,
Middlebrook pointedly described her book
as her brainchild. "When I first saw the
book, I thought, 'lt's so beautiful," Middle
brook said. "I know it came out of me, but
now it's out in the world, it no longer be
longs to me
... but I do feel as its mom I can explain it."
Middlebrook explained the book, but she
refuses to do anything settle for pat answers

and blame. She cannot be boxed in with the
Hughes apologists. Middlebrook seems to
share some common ground with authors
who could be viewed as "Hughes-bashers,"
such as Jillian Becker, in setting out to ex
amine "how marriages fail, and how men fail
in marriage."
Indeed, upon meeting Ted Hughes when
he came to the Bay Area on a book junket,
Middlebrook sensed the same magnetic
sexual energy that was the ruin of the
literati power-duo's marriage. Glimpsing
the seated Hughes, Middlebrook recalled,
"I went, 'Boing!'" It didn't hurt that she was
sporting a form-fitting leather suit with
tight bellbottom trousers. "He just looks up
at me and he says, 'Nice Suit,"' said Middle
brook, with a wily grin.
"I can speak from the personal experi
ence of someone who has had a suicide in
the family - they are so finally inscrutable
that they are self-murder," Middlebrook
said. A woman in the audience raised her
hand and said that her husband had commit
ted suicide.
"The survivors always feel guilty, and are
not to blame," said Middlebrook. She said
she knows of no suicide note written by
Plath. "A marriage has its own script, and its
own structure," Middlebrook said. In "Her
Husband," Middlebrook brings to light to
the passionate, at-times sordid, but ever-in
triguing life of Plath and Hughes. She does
this in a way in which she does not believe
the new biopic "Sylvia," does.
Middlebrook courteously applauded star
Gwyneth Paltrow's "Sylvia Plath scowl" and
the filmmakers' treatment of Plath's poetry.
But in a review of the movie for the Chroni
cle of Higher Education, Middlebrook la
bels the film a "potboiler" which "is not ac
tually about a writer," and reduces Plath to
"a housewife struggling in the shadow" of
the talented Hughes.
As a bonus for Hughes enthusiasts, Mid
dlebrook's book fleshes out quotes from
Plath's personal writings for the first time,
previously expurgated in the published
form. "As a biographer, I filled in several of
the blanks," Middlebrook said.
The women clustered around her
clenched their autographed copies to their
chests and smiled hungrily.
