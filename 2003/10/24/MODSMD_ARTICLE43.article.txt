# Travis crafts short-term 'Memories'
## 
### MACKENZIE COOPER 
As an avid Radiohead fan, I was immedi
ately intrigued by Scotland-based band
Travis' first U.S. hit, "Why Does It Always
Rain on Me?", back in the spring of 2000.
Singer Fran Healy whines and moans in a
very Thorn Yorke-like fashion and the simple

acoustic guitar rhythms of his band are evoca
tive of the 1995 Radiohead album "The
Bends." In fact, their albums "The Man
Who" and "The Invisible Band" showcase a
band combining simple, tender songwriting
and dramatic lyrics to great effect. So when I
popped in their latest album, "12 Memories,"
I was expecting more of the same - gentle

mood-pieces with lyrics about life and love.
I was in for a surprise, and slight disap
pointment. Unlike the sunny outlook the
other albums have taken on, the 11 songs
(plus one secret song) on "12 Memories"
adopt a sad vibe, even on tracks with titles
like "Love Will Come Through." This song -
about love making everything better - starts
with the sad strum of an acoustic guitar. The
lyrics and melody are reminiscent of U2 and
Healy's inflicted voice gives the song its real
emotion (as Bono's vocals are what give pas

sion to much of U2's music).
The album's melancholy
culminates in the "secret I
track" (a trademark of the
band) - "Some Sad Song."
The song evokes the feeling of

sitting in your room, alone, crying over bad
news. The only track that could fit on "The
Man Who" or "The Invisible Band" is the
opening track, "Quicksand." Its simple repe
titious vocals and upbeat music blend with a
harder guitar rhythm that shows the band's
maturity in songwriting.
In some respects, this album is an experi
ment for Travis - the guitar has become more
imposing on most tracks, and the drumming
backs it up. In a recent interview, Healy said
he was "bored of writing stuff that is specifi
cally meaning something." Maybe that two

year song-writing hiatus, due to injuries to
drummer Neil Primrose, ruined Healy's abil
ity to write meaningful and eloquent lyrics
(and speak eloquently for that matter), but
the new reliance on instrumentation is ap
pealing.
It's easy to look past slipping lyrics when
the vocals and music work so well together.
Take, for instance, "Peace The Fuck Out," a
track about trying to get someone to realize
the mistakes they are making. Lyrics like
"you have a brain, so use it" and "the time has

come to peace the fuck
out" could easily be part
of a laughable, whiny,
wannabe punk song.
Ironically, Healy's voice
redeems his lyrics, and

ending the song with chants of "peace the
fuck out" (recorded at a soccer game) is re
freshing.
Despite the sometimes juvenile lyrics, "12
Memories" shows great growth and maturity
for Travis's songwriting skills. The album
won't disappoint the listener who, like me,
has become slightly jaded with the score of
recent bands with similar-sounding songs.
And in the next album, maybe Healy will re
discover that old poetic spark and decide to
write something with meaning.
