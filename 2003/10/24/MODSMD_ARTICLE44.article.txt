# Ludacris serves retried "Chicken"

### JOSH SHIPP 
The new Ludacris album "Chicken & Beer" long-awaited as the latest masterful cre
ation of the dirty Southern rapper - spins onto the scene almost two years after the hugely
successful "Word of Mouf." And the result is mixed: This is an album that offers many
meaty-moments that are worth the bite, but not the chew.
Luda's "Chicken and Beer" uses the same ingredients as his two previous albums, laying
down tight rhymes that are interwoven with a sense of humor and simple, profound lyrics
that are easy to remember in a crowded club.
New to this album is an Eminem-like addition: a pinch of hatred toward Bill O'Reilly from
Fox News Channel's "The O'Reilly Factor." The ultra-conservative TV host torpedoed Lu
dacris's lucrative Pepsi endorsement last year by calling for a boycott of the soft-drink giant
and their support of the southern rapper. The next day, Pepsi dropped Ludacris from their

campaign. Luda strikes back with this album, taking
aim at O'Reilly in a few choice songs. Well done Lu
dacris, well done.
The album hits hard at the start, with some of
the hottest rapping Luda has done yet in "Southern
Fried Intro." With a tight guitar track in the back
ground, Luda shows off his versatility and rapid rap

ping repertoire. He then moves on to the deep choruses of "Blow it out yo @ss!" in "Blow It
Out" - with some hilarious lines interspersed. And you've all heard "Stand Up" by now, the
main single off the album, which definitely grows on you after a while.
The next few songs sound like remixes of 1970s and 80s easy-listening music with modern
(read, dirty) lyrics. Ludacris gets back on track with "Screwed Up," a slow-paced carnival
ride through his land of the green leaf. "Hip Hop Quotables" is one of the funniest tracks
Luda has ever laid down, and it is definitely worth a listen for the inventive rhymes (he did
in fact shoot the Tooth Fairy).
Shawnna is featured heavily in "P-Poppin'," reinforcing my belief that they should drop
her faster than the man in the skit "Black Man's Struggle." Snoop Dogg is featured in "Hoes
in My Room" as the duo ponders who let "the hoes in [his] room." Turns out it was Bill
O Reilly. Almost at the end of the album we get "We Got," featuring Chingy (so hot right
now), 1-20 (the next DTP crewmember to bust out) and Tity-Boi (he's tall). It's a driving
track that ends the album on a good note.
Ludacris albums usually have a handful of singles and a few novelty tracks. This album
just has more of the novelty tracks than hot singles to get hype. If you really liked the songs
that were skipped by most and never hit the airwaves from "Word of Mouf," you'll enjoy this
CD. But, if you're looking for more "Roll Out, Area Codes" and "What's Your Fantasy,"
"Chicken & Beer" will not whet your palette.
