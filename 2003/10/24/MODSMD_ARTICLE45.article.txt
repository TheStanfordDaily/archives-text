# We'd rather go South

If you're already in a melancholy mood, then Elvis Costello's new album
"North" (Universal Classics 2003), provides a comfortable retreat - it's like sitting
for the evening in a Vegas lounge, cradling a whiskey sour and chatting with a pi
anist embittered by his failed career and the women who have hurt him along the
way.
Mellow and somber with dark harmonies, the entire collection seems to be
mourning something or someone lost. Yet the lyrics suggest Costello is finding
love, not losing it.
. "It's strange to finally find myself so tongue-tied... someone took the words

away," he says on the second track,
and while the music lapses into in
strumentals as he delivers the line,
there are plenty of words left for the
rest of the album, which walks the
line between sung melodies and spo
ken word.
Although he wrote and arranged
all the tracks, Costello only appears

on piano in the final track. But his
voice blends from song to song in what begins to feel like one long conversation:
"North" isn't so much a series of songs as a 40-minute opus to the bittersweet na
ture of love.
It's difficult to differentiate between the songs. One may be about meeting a
lover, the next about losing her, but the tone is the same. Much like the cover of
album, picturing Costello huddling in his coat as he walks along a rainy street, the
damper never comes off the music. It's not simply restrained, it's as though the
whole thing has been wrapped in a wet blanket.
Songs that are meant to be plaintive sound like lamentations. It seems like he
must be tearing his hair or beating his chest. But most likely he's looking at you
through those big black glasses and commiserating.
The music on "North" isn't bad, but it fades into the background. Maybe it is
meant to: The strength of the album, and this is likely true of most of Costello's
music, is in the lyrics. His piano and orchestral arrangements are good but not un
common.
And in case you wanted to know what Costello was thinking as he composed
the album, you can check out the accompanying DVD. Costello sits at a chipped
upright piano, sprinkled liberally with decaying fall foliage - as if to impress the
mood of the music visually.
It's hard to be up on this album after listening to it. Though relaxing, "North"
is far from uplifting. And that's the mood it appears Costello was trying to elicit
with this solemn offering.
