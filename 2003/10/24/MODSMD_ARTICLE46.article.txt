# Record Bin: We like this "Virgin"

### ERICK FLORES 
After 20 years in show business, people are starting to ques
tion Madonna's relevance in a pop world dominated by for
mulaic hip-hop collaborations from the Neptunes, bad nii
metal bands posing as rockers and sappy melodies from self
labeled singer-songwriters. But before the yoga, the children's
books and the on-stage hp-locks with pop stars half her age,
Madonna ruled the charts and the media byway of perpetual
reinvention.

Madonna's biggest record "The Im
maculate Collection" was released in
1990 and quickly went on to move over 10
million copies in the United States alone.
The LP, whose title features the singer's
ever-present references to religion and
accurately reflects her knack for self
praise, features 15 hits that gave her own

ership over the 80s and two bonus songs that were new at the
time of the album's release.
It's hard to find someone ardently insist that Madonna's
original material was good in its entirety. In fact, her first
records were mostly filler and fluff used to pad the three or
four singles that would receive massive airplay.
But on "The Immaculate Collection," the media mogul strips
away the gloss and gives us exactly what we want and what
she's best at: clever and catchy pop perfection that works well
on everything from road trips to dancing in your room in your
underwear.
Starting out as a club act in the booming gay scene of the
early 80s, it could have been easy to dismiss Madonna as an
other disco dolly, as expendable and forgettable as the slew of
one-hit wonders that ruled this era of excess. But with infec
tious dance rhythms and simple, memorable choruses, early
songs like "Holiday," "Lucky Star" and "Get Into the

Groove" cemented Madonna's role as the queen of synth pop.
In "Papa Don't Preach," "Express Yourself' and "Justify My
Love," the singer demonstrates her ability and affinity for mix
ing controversy and politics into her lyrics. She tackles hot top
ics like teen pregnancy, female empowerment and sexual lib
eration in songs that -courted criticism from conservatives,
Midwesterners and Christians alike.
Even when treading the dangerous waters that mediocre
singers should never cross - the ballad - Madonna remains

afloat on the strength of slow songs
like "Live to Tell" and "Crazy for
You."
But amidst these notables, the
heart of this record really lies in four
songs: "Like a Virgin," "Material
Girl," "Like a Prayer" and "Vogue."
Madonna fan or not, everyone will
inevitably have liked at least one of
these songs at some point in his or

her life, if not still.
These are the hits that define the artist and conjure up im
ages of her famed videos: Videos that laughed in the face of
fashion faux-pas and made wedding dresses, cone bras and or
ange lace socks with green satin pumps acceptable, if not
downright trendy. They introduced golden age actors like
Marilyn Monroe and Fred Astaire to the blockbuster genera
tion. And they made it clear that Madonna would do anything
and everything in a video, including, but not limited to, setting
crosses on fire.
If there's any greatest hits collection and guilty pleasure
that's worth having, it's this one. Because while some would
rather liken Madonna to a calculated marketing genius or an
iconoclastic material whore before seeing her fit to be called an
artist, she is arguably the most representative icon of our gener
ation's popular culture. Oh yeah, and her songs are fun too.
