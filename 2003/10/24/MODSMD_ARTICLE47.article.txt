San Francisco Opera's new production of
Rossini's "II Barbiere di Siviglia" is an near-cata
strophe. It begins with a gigantic white house that
dominates the stage - and, sadly, the action. It is
most disarming to hear the colorful vibrancy of
the well-known Rossinian tones bouncing off the
asylum white of Rosina's condo.

huge
mis
take.

Schaal, who designed last year's "St. Francis of As
sisi," unfortunately uses the same sterile aesthetic
that guided the "St. Francis" set in creating the
house for one of the greatest comedies of all time.
The house resembles a Miami Beach condo
minium and the characters fill it with loathsome

behavior. Almost 40 years ago, Theodor Adorno delivered a lec
ture known in English as "Bourgeois Opera." In it he decried the
movement toward director-centric opera, writing that, "moderni
ty... becomes a mere getup, becomes modernism-and yet, the
operatic stage director finds himself repeatedly forced into all
sorts of desperate interventions."

"Desperate" could certainly be a watchword for this new pro
duction, as the director must have felt compelled into the super
fluous, often using the house for all sorts of distracting side actions.

Much of the audience laughed uproariously, much
in the same way they would laugh at a good fart joke.
All of the comedy in this production stems from
the director's sophomoric vision, and almost none of it
is from Rossini's time-tested score. Audiences have
loved "Barbiere" for nearly two centuries. Adorno's
concerns have come to pass in a chilling way.
The cast, for the most part, was inadequate, cho
sen largely for its looks as opposed to pure vocal merit.
As Rosina, Helene Schneiderman sang with a sweet,
unaffected vocal production, though she lacked much
of the requisite charm required for the role.
Did she know that during her big aria, "Una
voce poco fa," Figaro was enticing Berta, the maid,
with cocaine? I ended up watching this side ren
dezvous, morbidly curious why one would under
mine the primary stage activity.
Clearly, musical excellence was sidelined in favor
of the production. Conductor Stefan Soltesz had trou
ble keeping some of the major ensembles together.
To its credit, this production redeemed some of
its first-act mistakes when, in the second act, it began to
rely less on its own gimmickry and made for an almost-

There are many more performances of "Barbiere". The cast
changes dramatically for the better in January, when Thomas
Hampson takes over Figaro and Met wunderkind Matthew Polen
zani sings Count Almaviva. Check sfopera.com for details.
