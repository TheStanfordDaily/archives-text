# Don't Try This in Social Dance Class Virginia Iglesias brings Flamenco to Stanford
## 
### NICHOLAS CASEY 
In my former days as a hula dancer, we'd occasionally sub
title our gyrations with clauses like: "In the beautiful land of
Hawaii, under the palm trees and sandy beaches ..It's only
now that I've discovered, under the tutelage of Virginia Igle
sias, that future aspirations for flamenco may only be rendered
in English as: "I am the goddamn best flamenco dancer you
have ever seen. You know it. Thank you, and goodbye."
Last Saturday night, the SF-based Alma Flamenca, and the
constantly costume-changing Virginia Iglesias started stomp
ing their show "Mosaico" in Dinkelspiel and didn't stop until
two and half hours later when an audience arose from a Span
ish trance and applauded till their hands were going numb.
And we realized Iglesias was the best goddamn flamenco
dancer we had ever seen.

A man in the
back wanted just
so much to tape it
on his camcorder.
He refused to sur
render the tape.
The police were

called to escort him out. It was that kind of show.
Meanwhile, Dinkelspiel was like an overcrowded bus, dot
ted with the hopeless expressions of a few late-comers groping
miserably in the dark, in search of seats which had no doubt
been stolen long before the music began. Behind the curtain
(still not drawn) you could hear the sensuous verses (amid a lit
tle to-do over a camcorder) of the Iberian bard Federico Gar
cia Lorca all sung over a tune so arabesque, you longed se
cretly for the good old days back in 711 when those Moors
were flooding across Gibraltar like nobody's business.
Sure, the fourteenth century would eventually roll by, along
with the heads of those delightful Moroccans, but the seeds for
this thing they call Flamenco, the dancing dean of the Spanish
culture, were already set along with the "paellas" that everyone
likes but no one can spell. Fantastic dresses, roses in the hair,
clod-hopping shoes - this is the dance. Here we go.
The lights have dimmed on the musicians, and among
the chants of "Vale" and "Bueno, bueno" emerging

from a rowdy audience, all you can hear is the lone hand
of a stray percussionist slapping the side the box he's sit
ting on. Virginia Iglesias begins streaming out new
rhythms from black flamencan shoes, only to be inter
rupted by her partner in crime - Melissa Cruz - who has
taken the stage; and a kind of duel ensues.
And it is only when the dancing has gotten so intense, so
fast, so stage-breaking, that the audience gasps - but not at the
dancing: the hoop of Melissa Cruz' earring flies out of her ear
and across the stage. The sound of silver breaking across wood
silences the audience. But Cruz doesn't skip a beat.
The poor silver hoop bit the dust that night my friends, for

no one ever picked it up. Smashed into the Dink flooring by an
other hour of Spanish dance, the mineral rights of that stage
have increased, if only slightly, since.
This is flamenco. So let's be honest about four facts here:
(1) Flamenco is the greatest of dances; (2) I am going to mas
ter it this month; (3) Spain is the superior European culture
and (4) if you were not at that show, then what the hell were
you doing?
Melissa Cruz, with or without her remaining earring, will be
performing this Saturday at La Tasca, 1441 Market Street, San
Francisco.
