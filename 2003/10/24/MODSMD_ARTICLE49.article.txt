The Simpsons: Hit and Run
Hold the phones, stop the
presses, there's actually a "Simp
sons" game out there that doesn't
suck!
Available for X-Box, Game
cube and Play Station 2, "Hit and
Run" is Vivendi Entertainment's
latest crack at using their "Simp
sons" license in the video game
scene. The difference is that un
like many of the past "Simpsons"
titles, this game offers an enjoy
able, fun experience that doesn't
rely on the license as it's crutch.
Set in the world of Springfield,
"Hit and Run" puts the player in
control of every member of the
Simpsons family. Missions -
sometimes overly simplistic - are
set out, and rewards (such as un
locking parts of the story) are be
stowed upon completion.
"Hit and Run" has been com
pared to Rockstar's "Grand
Theft Auto" (GTA) universe,
highly resembling its style of
game play and control scheme.
But while players can run amok,
stealing cars and interacting with
characters, "Hit and Run," is
drastically less violent than
"GTA3."
The game wins on presenta
tion: Springfield and its environs

are represented in great detail,
with familiar landmark popping
up regularly. Players can collect
hidden trading cards throughout
the game that provide descrip
tions and quotes from classic
"Simpsons" episodes. Even the
missions, from Homer trying to
shut down the power plant to
miss work to Bart's never ending
quest to get the latest "Bon
estorm" game, nail the "Simp
sons" theme perfectly. Believe
the hype-this game is a must
play fop«ny fan of the series.
Dance Dance Revolution Max 2
"Dance Dance Revolution"
(DDR) returns to the Play Sta
tion 2 in a sequel that shakes as
much ass as before.
Fans of "DDRMAX" will
have no trouble getting into the
swing of things again -Konami
has concentrated almost entirely
on new songs, with only minor
tweaks to the interface.
For those unfamiliar with
"DDR," the premise is very sim
ple: Players stand on a dance pad
and mimics dance steps that are
shown on screen. Things typically
start out with simple quarter
steps and jumps, and move on to
much more complicated moves,
until you're finally ready to get it
on at that frat party tomorrow

night.
When everything is unlocked,
"DDRMAX2" weighs in with a
whopping 69 total songs, excel
lent for those who dig variety.
Everything is here, from K.C. &
The Sunshine Band's "Get Down
Tonight" to DJ Sammy's "Heav
en." Though 13 of these songs
have been used in previous mixes,
they sound fresh in their remixed
avatars. Some hardcore fans may
be angered by the decision to in
clude more "Americanized"
songs, but personally, I think
these are better than those on the
previous release.
Graphics are identical to the
previous version, the only differ
ence being the much-needed in
clusion of more music videos as
background movies while playing
the game.
Konami hasn't done much to
improve game on the whole, but
frankly, I don't mind. My only
complaint with this version is that
songs are no longer organized by
difficulty, so beginning players
may have to search around be
fore finding easy songs.
When all is said and done, if
you haven't been a fan of "DDR"
before, you still won't be. Howev
er, for everyone that's played all
the other "DDR" mixes and want
more, "DDRMAX2" will have
you dancing the night away!
