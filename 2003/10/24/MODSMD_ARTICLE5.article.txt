## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Department of Public Safety released a
sketch of the "serial groper" suspect yesterday, the day
after he struck for at least his 18th time in the past five
months.
The suspect is described as Hispanic with black hair and
olive skin. He is reported to be 5-foot-9 tall, weighing 180
pounds with a stocky build. According to the flyer issued by
the police, he rides a mountain bike painted purple or blue
with a metallic shine.
The most recent groping incident took place near Braun
Music Hall Wednesday at about 8:40 p.m. when a man rode
up behind a female undergraduate, grabbed her buttocks

and rode off, ac
cording to police.
Another inci
dent that took
place on Oct. 8 was
reported to the po
lice 10 days later.
Director of Pub
lic Safety Laura
Wilson cautioned
everyone to be on
the lookout and to
be aware of his or
her surroundings.
At the same time,
she was optimistic
that the suspect
would be caught.
"With the help
of the community
he can be caught,"
she said, "if he con
tinues.

in a The Stanford police released this
different leads " sketch 'serial groper 7 suspect.
Wilson continued,
though she declined to elaborate. Police officers do think
that the groper is associated with the campus in some way*
"Students are encouraged to use designated travel
routes, walk with friends and carry a cell phone," the de
partment report says.

The groper approaches his victims from behind, grabs
their buttocks and rides off. All the assaults have occurred
at night, though many have come in well-traveled areas. All
the reported victims have been female.
Wilson emphasized that the faster victims respond by
calling the police, the more likely the police are to catch the
suspect.

"The most important thing to note is the direction of
travel," she said.

Still, finding a suspect who moves so fast is not that simple.
"We've been brainstorming since May," Sgt. Rick Tip
ton said. "Somebody's going to have the opportunity see
him or be there when he does it. He's going to get careless.
He'll get caught."
