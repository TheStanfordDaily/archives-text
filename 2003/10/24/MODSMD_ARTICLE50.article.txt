"What the hell was that?" These were the words uttered by my Mend who
was sitting next to me in the Aquarius Theater. I really couldn't blame him that
much, since I had the same lingering question in my head about what just took
almost two hours of my life. What I did know was the name, and.it was "Bubba
Hotep."

Now, don't get me wrong, the movie - directed by Don Coscarelli and based
on the short story by Joe R. Lansdale - did have its shining moments. Like when
a resident of a convalescent home steals the glasses off of another woman who

is in an iron lung. Or how when the drivers come
nearly weekly to take the bodies away and occa
sionally "mishandle" the deceased. Sadly, the
movie did not stay in this same vein.
The entire premise of the movie (I still al
most refuse to believe that there was one) was
that an aging Elvis Presley (Bruce Campbell) and
a black John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis) must save
an old folks home from a 2,000 year old cursed
mummy who parades around in a cowboy hat and
boots in east Texas. This mummy, by the way,

must take souls in order to live. How he gets these
souls is that he must suck them from a bodily orifice (I will leave it to your dirty
little minds to figure it out which one). As you can see, already the movie starts
out on some very shaky ground.

"Elvis" seems to be going through some type of crisis with his identity, and
JFK is running around as if he is Nancy Drew. It's all very entertaining for about
the first 10 minutes, but it seems that you can only adequately enjoy this movie
with accompanying hallucinogens or other inducers of "good-feelings," as some
of my other comrades happily discovered. If the movie would have more square
ly focused on the comedic aspects of the plot, it might have had a chance. Un
fortunately, "Bubba Hotep" will surely disappoint you, unless you're looking to
find somewhere to take a quick nap for $9.25.
