# 'Texas' massacres box office
## 
### DARREN FRANICH 
The camera pulls back from five terrified
kids, into the dead girl's mouth, through the
bullet-hole in the back of her head, out the
blood-and-brain-spattered puncture in the
back window, setting down outside the car.
And "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" has you
hooked.

You've been dancing around this movie. It
starts with a bang: Random carnage, a police
investigation and a monotone narrator. But
then you're in a 70s-era bang-bus, complete
with Cool Guy, Girlfriend, Stoner Friend A
(annoying) and Stoner Friend B (big 'n' use
less), and Horny Hitchhiker, who they picked
up on the way from Mexico to a Lynyrd
Skynyrd concert. There's drama: Cool Guy
told Girlfriend that Mexico would be roman
tic, but the trip was really to score lotsa

WEED, MAN!, which they
snuck through customs in a
pinata. We all miss the 70s.
Then they pick up an in
jured girl walking along the
road, yada yada, they have a
corpse, a gore-laden car and
no goshdarn clue. And now
the film, aptly titled "The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
(the three scariest words in the

English language), begins: What follows is a
steady climb up Mount Total Insanity, re
plete with psycho Texans, grody executions
and a pair of towering, roaring, sweet-jesus
kill-me-now monsters. There's Leatherface,
a wrestler-type who could punch your face in,
but who also has a sensitive side: he sews!
(with dead skin).
And there's the real star of the whole bloody

show: the Chainsaw.
You know it's com
ing, you think Horror
flicks can't affect us
post-Screamers.
Then a big door
opens and Leather
face and Chainsaw
blow your eyes, ears,
and mouth open.
There's a whole
weirdo family, but
they're just so much
corn-fried frosting
on the cannibalistic
cake.

There is an older
"Texas Chainsaw

Massacre,"
I (TCM) but
it's not nec
essary pre
viewing
I for the
new one:
the 70s
version, di
rected by
To be
Hooper,
was all

minimalist, psychological, near-documentary
horror; similar elements, different execution.
This rendition is directed by Marcus Nispel,
who has a keen eye for visuals. But the key
player here really is producer Michael Bay,
high-octane director of disgraceful garbage
("Pearl Harbor") and groovy garbage ("The
Rock"). He produced the new TCM and al
most certainly inspired the movie's sensa

tionalist, more-is-more scare tactic.
Thing is, it works: the gore is SO gory, the
good guys SO stupidly-innocent, the bad guys
SO crazy, the film inspires dual emotional re
actions: fright and amusement. When Chain
saw swipes through skin, muscle and bone,
and victim falls forward while leg falls back
ward, you scream, then you laugh. It's the
post-post-modern horror show: completely

serious, and completely outrageous. This is
less a battle between good and evil than sani
ty and Leatherface; no contest, really.
There are plenty of flaws here (thin char
acterization, SCREAM LOUDLY acting, a
tacked-on baby subplot - don't ask), but it's
the experience, and by that I mean big daddy
Chainsaw and Co., that you come away with
and remember forever.
