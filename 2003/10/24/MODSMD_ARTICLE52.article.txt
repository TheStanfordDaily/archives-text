# Death Cab picks up passengers
## 
### ALEXANDRA LUBOMIRKSY 
All these years, the Death Cab has
been a comfortable ride: With vocalist
Ben Gibbard at the steering wheel, gui
tarist Christopher Walla in shotgun,
Nicholas Hammer in the back and new
drummer Jason McGerr in the car
seat, the band roamed territory that
was ethereal, depressing and lyrically

graceful on their last outing, "We Have
the Facts and We're Voting Yes."
Now, it looks like the 'Cab has fi
nally stopped to pick up passengers - a
lot of them. On "Transatlanticism" -
their newest release - there are seven
people credited as "assistants," five as
"group members" and one individual
singled out for - in addition to group
membership - handclapping and
stomping. And on the band's unofficial
website, Gibbard asserts that "Transat
lanticism" exemplifies a group effort

more than any of the band's previous albums. No wonder
then that the tracks differ from each other more signifi
cantly than they have in the past.
So, as one may suspect, no one is going to pick up the
record and say that all the songs sound the same (a complaint
often leveled at Death Cab for Cutie). "Expo 'B6" begs to be

memorized verbatim and sung out loud at high volume;
teenage girls in the 50's could have bobbed their heads to this
thing. The mock excitement of "The Sound of Settling," has
Gibbard giddily singing "ba ba ba/This is the sound of set
tling." The group makes the whole growing old thing sound
so damn fun you take the ironic lines "Our youth is fleeting/

Old age is just around the bend/ and I
can't wait to go gray" with enthusiasm.
On the other hand, there are
several songs on the album that make
no reservations about their gloom. In
"Tiny Vessels," the somber groupie
gone-wrong song repeats the lines "She
was beautiful/ but she didn't mean a
thing to me" so factually you can't help
but wonder why Gibbard didn't see it
coming. Even the most smitten teenage
girls - of any decade - will resist falling
for the age-old temptation of wanting
to be the glorified groupie.
The second effect the many
contributors this album attained is
more surprising: Despite it's eclectic
sound, the album sparks in its simplici
ty. "Transatlanticism" ends with the
gentle "A Lack of Color." In it, the
group channels an Elliot Smith who
paid attention in science class.
Making complex brain func
tions into a pure and plain love song is
a talent that Death Cab has illustrated
before in their last album's "Epilogue"
which starts with the memorable line
"synapse to synapse." On "Transat

lanticism," Gibbard sings "When I see
you/1 really see you upside down/ but my brain knows
better/ it picks it up and turns you around."
Indeed, Death Cab has a talent for making the com
plex into the simple. With their new album - despite the
increasing amount of minds involved in its creation - has
only further proved this talent.
