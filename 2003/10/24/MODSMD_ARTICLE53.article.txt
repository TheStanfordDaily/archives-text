# 'Hudson River' a sweeping success
## 
### CHRIS MEYER 
Have you ever had the experience of visit
ing a place like Yosemite where nature seems
so vast and dazzling that you can't stop taking
photographs of it? How did you feel about
your pictures when you got them back from
being developed? I bet you were disappointed.
If you're like me, then you quickly flip past
the nature photos to look at the ones of your
self and your friends. As much as we like to
fashion ourselves as the next Ansel Adams, it
is extremely difficult to recapture in a photo
graph the awe and wonder we feel when im
mersed in a brilliant natural setting. It's even
harder to make a nature photo interesting.
Now imagine what it must be like to ac
complish these feats in a painting. Landscape
painting on the one hand attracts many ama
teur artists because practically anyone can
paint a passable landscape. Anyone who's
seen Bob Ross's "The Joy of Painting" on
PBS knows what I'm talking about.
On the other hand, landscape painting
presents artists with one of the most chal
lenging assignments in all of art: how do you
make a compelling representation of nature
on a two-dimensional canvas when the real
thing will always surpass its depiction? A
painting of Yosemite will never live up to ac
tually being there. Very few artists in the his
tory of art have succeeded in overcoming
this fundamental problem to make engaging
landscape painting.
"Hudson River School: Masterworks
from the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of
Art" now on view at Stanford's Cantor Cen
ter for the Visual Arts until January 18,
showcases a group of 19th century Ameri
can artists who succeeded at making land
scape images that are both aesthetically stir
ring and historically significant.
The exhibit's 55 paintings are subdivided
into sections by subject such as "Niagara
Falls" and "The American West." Every
painting in the show has a wall label, so visi
tors can get bogged down in reading about art

instead of seeing it if they're not
careful.
A few paintings in the exhibit
are simply exquisite. John William
Casilear's "Lake George" from
1860 is the first painting that greets
the viewer upon entering. A group
of cows mill around in the shallow
water of a lake while a small boat
leaves a thin wake behind them.
Trees, clouds and mountains com
plete the horizontal composition.
How Casilear turns such a mun
dane subject into something so
captivating is a mystery.
The paintings of Frederick
Edwin Church are the exhibit's
most visually stunning works.
Church's compositions posit small,
insignificant figures that are
dwarfed by powerful and wild nat
ural settings that extend into the
distance as if into infinity. Works
by Church's mentor, Thomas Cole,
are also impressive.
Church and Cole's work
proves that paintings have the
ability to evoke the vastness and
wonder of nature better than
photographs in some cases. Their
paintings are based on the close
observation of nature, but they
are not entirely faithful to it. Both

artists use their imaginations to exaggerate
topography and manipulate light for dra
matic effect.
Not all the paintings in the show measure
up to work of these masters. Like any suc
cessful movement in painting, the Hudson
River School had its leaders and then had its
followers. But the presence of these
mediocre examples serves to underscore
how rare great landscape paintings are and
makes one appreciate the show's gems.
The exhibit curators have framed "The
Hudson River School" exhibition to play to
its strengths. The show's wall panels and la

bels smartly emphasize history more than
art history. While these paintings are skill
fully executed, they did not have much in
fluence on subsequent art. The style of the
Hudson School painters had become anti
quated by the 1860s and 1870s when the Im
pressionists in France took painting in an
other, more-painterly direction.
Yet these painters have had a lasting cul
tural influence. The Hudson River School
was one of the first groups of American
artists who self-consciously took on the pro
ject of establishing an American identity. In
the 19th century, the world situation was the
reverse of what it is today: Europe was the

dominant power and America was strug
gling to assert and distinguish itself econom
ically and culturally from this power. Hud
son River painters took the established
styles and techniques of Europeans and em
ployed them to emphasize America's poten
tial, which was embodied by the country's
untapped natural resources. Their paintings
both reflected and fueled the drive West
that defined 19th century America.
"The Hudson River School" exhibition is
worth a visit for anyone who's interested in
19th century American history or for any
one who's simply been disappointed with
their photographs from a camping trip.

Not all the paintings in the show measure
up to work of these masters. Like any suc
cessful movement in painting, the Hudson
River School had its leaders and then had its
followers. But the presence of these
mediocre examples serves to underscore
how rare great landscape paintings are and
makes one appreciate the show's gems.
The exhibit curators have framed "The
Hudson River School" exhibition to play to
its strengths. The show's wall panels and la

bels smartly emphasize history more than
art history. While these paintings are skill
fully executed, they did not have much in
fluence on subsequent art. The style of the
Hudson School painters had become anti
quated by the 1860s and 1870s when the Im
pressionists in France took painting in an
other, more-painterly direction.
Yet these painters have had a lasting cul
tural influence. The Hudson River School
was one of the first groups of American
artists who self-consciously took on the pro
ject of establishing an American identity. In
the 19th century, the world situation was the
reverse of what it is today: Europe was the

dominant power and America was strug
gling to assert and distinguish itself econom
ically and culturally from this power. Hud
son River painters took the established
styles and techniques of Europeans and em
ployed them to emphasize America's poten
tial, which was embodied by the country's
untapped natural resources. Their paintings
both reflected and fueled the drive West
that defined 19th century America.
"The Hudson River School" exhibition is
worth a visit for anyone who's interested in
19th century American history or for any
one who's simply been disappointed with
their photographs from a camping trip.
