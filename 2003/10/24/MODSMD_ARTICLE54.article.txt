### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Remember when you were 7 years old and you'd tear
through the house, filled with an overwhelming sense of gid
diness and pure joy? You'd yell at the top of your lungs, not
caring who could hear you, indifferent to the world, until your
babysitter Todd kung fu'd your ass so you'd shut the hell up
and then told your mom the bruises were from a particularly
intense game of Clue. Those fuzzy memories of days past may
be long gone, but that doesn't mean you can't learn from them.
After all, this is Stanford, baby, Stanford. We should be learn
ing as much as we possibly can in these precious four years.
Getting back on track, think of the last time you got laid. How
were you? More specifically, how did you sound?
Did you cry out like in the days of yore, without inhibition,

without hesitation? Or did you hold back like the Asian kid in
I-Hum section, afraid of what your own voice might sound like?
If you identified yourself in the first question, congratulations
this article is not for you. You are on top of it, like an ultimate
player on a gravity bong. And yet, I know you're still reading,
you inquisitive bastard. As for everyone else, try to think back
and remember how good it felt to let your vocal chords go wild,
releasing all your tensions in such a raw, primal way.
Of course, I concede that as college students we run into
certain difficulties: Namely, the paper thin, damn near see
through walls separating our little rooms. But why should this
stop you from heartily vocalizing your dizzy cries of pleasure?
Because you're afraid that people will hear you and associate
you now and forever with the dirty act of [gasp] sexual inter
course? Okay, quick reality check. You go to Stanford. Re
member? You most likely belong to a hip-hop/mormon/synth

fusion a capella group that you started, you're running low on
bone marrow because you donated it all to that one frat no
one's ever heard of in White Plaza, and you've overused the
term "sketchy" to the point that it has lost all meaning.
Chances are, you're not getting laid all that often. So why
not relish those rare moments and make some noise? You
know you're going to brag to everyone the next morning
anyway how you "hit that" so what does it matter if they
hear it before they hear about it. At least now you'll have
some credibility.
To be perfectly blunt, loud sex is hot. It makes you feel hot.
It makes the person you're with feel hot. It makes the CS
major eavesdropping from two rooms down feel hot. In fact,
that's probably the hottest he's going to feel for a long time. So
don't be stingy and when you spread the legs, remember to
spread the love.
