## 1,001 Arabian Knights 
### PRIYANKA PATHAK 
They aren't dressed in shining armor. But they are
"Knights" nonetheless.
The Knight Fellows program offers seasoned journal
ists the opportunity to study at Stanford for a year away
from the pressure of the newsroom.
Relaxing at the Coffee House, the feeling of "no dead
line" life is still sinking in for the fellows.
"Its absolutely brilliant," say Kay Johnson, a journalist
from Time Magazine. No deadlines to race against, read
what you like, do what you want, study what you please
it'll spoil me!"
But as Knight Fellows begin to discuss the world out
side the oh-so-blue Stanford skies, they speak of places few
others have seen. The following interviews are with three
current Knight Fellows who retell stories that have changed
their perspectives on journalism, from guerrillas in Turkey
and the jungles of Cambodia to an execution in a California
state prison.
Bruno Giussani
"One of my most exciting stories is the one I suddenly
became a part of in the fall of 1993," Giussani says.
Kurdish guerrillas in Turkey had kidnapped one Italian
and three Swiss tourists for political recognition, but the
Italian and Swiss governments refused to comply.
As an editor of LfHebdo, an international magazine,
Giussani spoke to various people in pursuit of the story, but
he eventually became so involved in the story that he be
came part of the low-profile rescue delegation.
"It was very exciting," Giussani says. "Of course, as a
member of that delegation I could not file stories, but we
made a deal: As soon as we would leave Turkey, I would re
sume my journalistic activities," he says smiling, his excite
ment still obvious.
A delegation of four left Switzerland, unpublicized and
unnoticed. Two members of the Swiss federal parliament, a
journalist [Giussani] and a translator were on their way to
rescue the hostages.
After arriving in Ankara, the delegation was unable to
make contact with the kidnappers because phone lines
were tapped and faxes intercepted.
The Turkish government followed their every move.
The situation seemed insurmountable, until someone had
an epiphany.
"We realized that we could talk in a peculiar Swiss-Ger
man dialect, which to outsiders could sound like a barbarian
idiom," he says with a laugh. "One could feel almost immedi
ately their discomfort when we started speaking Swiss-Ger
man! It was like a natural encryption technology that gave us
the intimacy we needed to [resolve the situation]."
"The feeling of adventure was tremendous," Giussani
continues. "The hostages were left on an isolate stretch of
route outside of Van. The process was of course hectic, but
uncomplicated. The hostages looked immediately in good
health and spirit."
From Van, the Swiss plane flew directly home. And when
the captain announced that they were flying above the Turk
ish-Greek border, Giussani became a journalist again.
"Of course I had been taking notes and pictures all
along, but now suddenly I had the hostages and the mem

bers of the delegation all for myself for a few hours so I spent that
time interviewing them," he says.
Giussani filed his story despite some questions that arose about
his ethics as someone who reported on a story that he acted in. But
Guissiani sees no conflict.
"I was very open and straightforward about it, telling readers

exactly what had happened," Guissiani says. "I don't feel that I
crossed any ethical threshold. To me, the switch from actor to story
teller was very smooth."
Kay Johnson
"I have been told I live a very glamorous life," Johnson says,

smiling. "Three days of pounding through choppy waters
in a tiny boat, having leeches crawl up your boots, sleeping
on the floor of a shack in a malaria-infested jungle and,
above all, getting rained on at every turn, is glamorous. Oh,
and did I mention bathing in the river of crocodiles?"
It was September 2000 and Johnson was covering the dis
covery of a rare species in the Cardamom Mountains of
Cambodia as the Vietnam correspondent for Time maga
zine. The rainy season of the Cardamom made the remote
journey even more perilous than usual, but a sharp dead
line made it an excursion she could not pass up.
Cambodia's Cardamoms have been shrouded in mist
and mystery for more than three decades, cut off from the
world by Khmer Rouge guerrillas who used the jungle as a
refuge. The region is now the largest, most pristine wilder
ness in mainland Southeast Asia. Earlier that year scien
tists finally began to probe the secrets of the Cardamoms,
with stunning results. Dozens of globally threatened
species, including tigers, elephants and a rare crocodile
thought to be extinct in the wild, were discovered flourish
ing in isolation.
However, researchers weren't alone in taking advan
tage of the area's new accessibility.
"Logging companies and would-be settlers had moved
in," Johnson says. "The government had already granted
five timber concessions that extended into the Car
damoms. At least two logging roads led into the central
mountains. With the roads came thousands of settlers,
slashing and burning trees to clear land for farming. Im
poverished Cambodians said they needed the land, and the
government was desperate for the logging revenue."
Timing was everything.
"It was vital to see this pristine wilderness for ourselves
and to share what we saw with the world before the
upcoming debate [and decision later that year in Decem
ber] on how to control development there," she says, her
eyes sparkling.
The piece seemed to make a difference, making the hard
work worthwhile for Johnson.
"[People] said that it was this story that had sealed the
fate of the Cardamom Mountains," Johnson says. "They
were to be protected as a natural reserve a 10 million
hectare [25 million acre] reserve!"
Sara Catania
"I was one of the 11 journalists who witnessed his
death," says Sara Catania, from LA Weekly, describing
her experience in 2002. She watched the lethal injection of
Stephen Anderson, convicted of killing Elizabeth Lyman
while burglarizing her home in San Bernardino county.
"The room was silent. Anderson, the 'condemned cap
tain' as he was called, emerged through the curve-topped
door at the back of the death tank, shackled at the wrists
and waist and flanked by five guards," Catania says. "The
guards began to strap him down to a gurney about 20 feet
from where I stood.,"
Catania was having doubts.
"I was thinking, what if, just if, we were killing someone
who possibly could have reformed?" Catania says. "Two
guards appeared carrying a plastic tray of medical supplies.
Each set to work on an arm, tying it off, tapping for a vein."
What she saw convinced her that no matter what, the

death penalty could not be an answer to crime. Catania does not
yet know what the right solution to this problem is, but feels that
her task is to continue to challenge the public.
"My job as a journalist is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the
comfortable," Catania says. "What I witnessed that day is not easy
to forget." ,

"Logging companies and would-be settlers had moved
in," Johnson says. "The government had already granted
five timber concessions that extended into the Car
damoms. At least two logging roads led into the central
mountains. With the roads came thousands of settlers,
slashing and burning trees to clear land for farming. Im
poverished Cambodians said they needed the land, and the
government was desperate for the logging revenue."
Timing was everything.
"It was vital to see this pristine wilderness for ourselves
and to share what we saw with the world before the
upcoming debate [and decision later that year in Decem
ber] on how to control development there," she says, her
eyes sparkling.
The piece seemed to make a difference, making the hard
work worthwhile for Johnson.
"[People] said that it was this story that had sealed the
fate of the Cardamom Mountains," Johnson says. "They
were to be protected as a natural reserve a 10 million
hectare [25 million acre] reserve!"

"I was one of the 11 journalists who witnessed his
death," says Sara Catania, from LA Weekly, describing
her experience in 2002. She watched the lethal injection of
Stephen Anderson, convicted of killing Elizabeth Lyman
while burglarizing her home in San Bernardino county.
"The room was silent. Anderson, the 'condemned cap
tain' as he was called, emerged through the curve-topped
door at the back of the death tank, shackled at the wrists
and waist and flanked by five guards," Catania says. "The
guards began to strap him down to a gurney about 20 feet
from where I stood.,"
Catania was having doubts.
"I was thinking, what if, just if, we were killing someone
who possibly could have reformed?" Catania says. "Two
guards appeared carrying a plastic tray of medical supplies.
Each set to work on an arm, tying it off, tapping for a vein."
What she saw convinced her that no matter what, the

death penalty could not be an answer to crime. Catania does not
yet know what the right solution to this problem is, but feels that
her task is to continue to challenge the public.
"My job as a journalist is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the
comfortable," Catania says. "What I witnessed that day is not easy
to forget." ,

They aren't dressed in shining armor. But they are
"Knights" nonetheless.
The Knight Fellows program offers seasoned journal
ists the opportunity to study at Stanford for a year away
from the pressure of the newsroom.
Relaxing at the Coffee House, the feeling of "no dead
line" life is still sinking in for the fellows.
"Its absolutely brilliant," say Kay Johnson, a journalist
from Time Magazine. No deadlines to race against, read
what you like, do what you want, study what you please
it'll spoil me!"
But as Knight Fellows begin to discuss the world out
side the oh-so-blue Stanford skies, they speak of places few
others have seen. The following interviews are with three
current Knight Fellows who retell stories that have changed
their perspectives on journalism, from guerrillas in Turkey
and the jungles of Cambodia to an execution in a California
state prison.
Bruno Giussani
"One of my most exciting stories is the one I suddenly
became a part of in the fall of 1993," Giussani says.
Kurdish guerrillas in Turkey had kidnapped one Italian
and three Swiss tourists for political recognition, but the
Italian and Swiss governments refused to comply.
As an editor of LfHebdo, an international magazine,
Giussani spoke to various people in pursuit of the story, but
he eventually became so involved in the story that he be
came part of the low-profile rescue delegation.
"It was very exciting," Giussani says. "Of course, as a
member of that delegation I could not file stories, but we
made a deal: As soon as we would leave Turkey, I would re
sume my journalistic activities," he says smiling, his excite
ment still obvious.
A delegation of four left Switzerland, unpublicized and
unnoticed. Two members of the Swiss federal parliament, a
journalist [Giussani] and a translator were on their way to
rescue the hostages.
After arriving in Ankara, the delegation was unable to
make contact with the kidnappers because phone lines
were tapped and faxes intercepted.
The Turkish government followed their every move.
The situation seemed insurmountable, until someone had
an epiphany.
"We realized that we could talk in a peculiar Swiss-Ger
man dialect, which to outsiders could sound like a barbarian
idiom," he says with a laugh. "One could feel almost immedi
ately their discomfort when we started speaking Swiss-Ger
man! It was like a natural encryption technology that gave us
the intimacy we needed to [resolve the situation]."
"The feeling of adventure was tremendous," Giussani
continues. "The hostages were left on an isolate stretch of
route outside of Van. The process was of course hectic, but
uncomplicated. The hostages looked immediately in good
health and spirit."
From Van, the Swiss plane flew directly home. And when
the captain announced that they were flying above the Turk
ish-Greek border, Giussani became a journalist again.
"Of course I had been taking notes and pictures all
along, but now suddenly I had the hostages and the mem

bers of the delegation all for myself for a few hours so I spent that
time interviewing them," he says.
Giussani filed his story despite some questions that arose about
his ethics as someone who reported on a story that he acted in. But
Guissiani sees no conflict.
"I was very open and straightforward about it, telling readers

exactly what had happened," Guissiani says. "I don't feel that I
crossed any ethical threshold. To me, the switch from actor to story
teller was very smooth."
Kay Johnson
"I have been told I live a very glamorous life," Johnson says,

smiling. "Three days of pounding through choppy waters
in a tiny boat, having leeches crawl up your boots, sleeping
on the floor of a shack in a malaria-infested jungle and,
above all, getting rained on at every turn, is glamorous. Oh,
and did I mention bathing in the river of crocodiles?"
It was September 2000 and Johnson was covering the dis
covery of a rare species in the Cardamom Mountains of
Cambodia as the Vietnam correspondent for Time maga
zine. The rainy season of the Cardamom made the remote
journey even more perilous than usual, but a sharp dead
line made it an excursion she could not pass up.
Cambodia's Cardamoms have been shrouded in mist
and mystery for more than three decades, cut off from the
world by Khmer Rouge guerrillas who used the jungle as a
refuge. The region is now the largest, most pristine wilder
ness in mainland Southeast Asia. Earlier that year scien
tists finally began to probe the secrets of the Cardamoms,
with stunning results. Dozens of globally threatened
species, including tigers, elephants and a rare crocodile
thought to be extinct in the wild, were discovered flourish
ing in isolation.
However, researchers weren't alone in taking advan
tage of the area's new accessibility.
