MEChA's Call for an End to the Controversy
We would like to respond to all the unfounded criticism we have received lately in campus publica
tions. There is no need for there to be any question about whether MEChA is a racist and/or separatist
organization. An honest examination of our action and our philosophy would be sufficient to clearly
demonstrate the following:
• We are not radst. We are accepting of all races. We believe in the full equality of all people, regardless of
race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or creed;
• We are not separatist. Our motto is not nor ever has been "Por la raza todo, fuera de la raza nada";
• We do not endorse the Plan Espiritual de Aztlan. The document was written by the poet Alurista and amended
by the First Chicano National Conference in Denver, Colorado in March 1969, which predates the founding of
our organization (April 1969 in Santa Barbara);
•We do not blindly follow any other document, including the Plan of Santa Barbara, also written in 1969. We
do agree with the principles of educational advancement as a means of social advancement and recognizing
value in our culture, but also acknowledge that its rhetoric is dated, and inappropriate in these times;
• We see nothing wrong with choosing to self-identify with any term that denotes national origin or ethnicity,
whether Chicano, Hispanic, Mexican-American, Latino, etc.;
• We, the Stanford chapter of MEChA, are not subordinate to any national organization (in accordance with OSA
regulations). In fact, MEChA is a loosely organized association of campus chapters that are not directed by any
centrally organized body.
HOWEVER,
• We do promote fair labor practices for the benefit of communities and families;
• We do promote access to higher education for underprivileged youth mired in an educational system that has
failed them;
• We do promote cultural events on campus that celebrate Latino traditions and history, which contribute to the
Stanford community as a whole;
• We do promote the rights of immigrants regardless of national origin and encourage progressive immigration
reform;
• We do promote Chicano studies programs that affirm our value in the diverse American landscape;
• We do struggle for the social and economic equality of all peoples, and for the elimination of poverty, hopeless
ness, and despair too often experienced by minorities and working people in our society;
• We do work for greater democracy in the running of Colleges and Universities, including the representation of
students and employees in the decision making bodies of higher educational institutions;
• We do see MEChA, and the idea of a progressive socio-political awareness/activism group concerned with
Chicano/Latino issues, as an evolving idea that must adapt itself to our times and circumstances.
All of the above is demonstrated by our program of work, which in recent times has included support
for the campus anti-war effort, working through a coalition of campus organizations to establish a liv
ing wage for all Stanford workers, and promoting awareness about Proposition 54. We are sure that
anyone who studies our actions and involvement on campus will arrive at the conclusion that we are
not a racist or separatist organization, as we have been accused, but rather one of many social
activism groups at Stanford that strive for a more just world.
-Stanford MEChA
An Open Response to The Stanford Review
We, the members and allies of the Chicano/Latino community at Stanford, would like to express our
outrage at the illegitimate attacks made by the Editorial Board and Christine Boehm of The Stanford
Review not only about the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), but also El Centro
Chicano.
The Stanford Review made the implication that MEChA advocates separatism based on historical docu
ments that emerged from the Civil Rights Era, and therefore is a racist organization likened to the Ku
Klux Klan. Their comparison between MEChA and the KKK was not only invalid, but also disturbing,
considering the Klan's continued affiliation with white supremacy, intolerant philosophy, and prevalent
history of racial violence.
In addition, by questioning the use of MEChA Special Fee and suggesting that students should think
twice about supporting Special Fee, The Stanford Review compromised the financial stability of the
Chicano/Latino community. The Special Fee has never supported nor will ever support any racist
cause. In fact, MEChA is one of many organizations housed under El Centro Chicano dedicated to the
empowerment of Chicanos and Latinos, and their funds help to support programs sponsored by the
entire community, including Floricanto, Dfa de los Muertos, Posadas, Cesar Chavez Commemoration,
Raza Day Conference, Zoot Suit, Cinco de Mayo, Barrio Assistance/CHE Health Fair, Raza Medical
Students Association, CHE/Medical Students Buddy Program, Derechos, Chicano/Latino Graduation,
Los Hermanos, Familia, Queer Awareness Week, and Club Caliente. These events are integral to the
cultural and academic education of not only Chicano/Latino students, but the entire Stanford commu
nity.
While we respect that The Stanford Review should be granted the same freedom of speech as any other
organization on campus, we want to enlighten the Stanford community to the fact that their claims
about MEChA were false. We also hope that students will not make the same mistake of essentializing
the Chicano/Latino community ideology, which occurred when The Stanford Review included a picture
of El Centro Chicano. Both MEChA and El Centro Chicano advocate community building through unity.
As the MEChA motto states, La union hace la fuerza.

empowerment of Chicanos and Latinos, and their funds help to support programs sponsored by the
entire community, including Floricanto, Dfa de los Muertos, Posadas, Cesar Chavez Commemoration,
Raza Day Conference, Zoot Suit, Cinco de Mayo, Barrio Assistance/CHE Health Fair, Raza Medical
Students Association, CHE/Medical Students Buddy Program, Derechos, Chicano/Latino Graduation,
Los Hermanos, Familia, Queer Awareness Week, and Club Caliente. These events are integral to the
cultural and academic education of not only Chicano/Latino students, but the entire Stanford commu
nity.
While we respect that The Stanford Review should be granted the same freedom of speech as any other
organization on campus, we want to enlighten the Stanford community to the fact that their claims
about MEChA were false. We also hope that students will not make the same mistake of essentializing
the Chicano/Latino community ideology, which occurred when The Stanford Review included a picture
of El Centro Chicano. Both MEChA and El Centro Chicano advocate community building through unity.
As the MEChA motto states, La union hace la fuerza.

MEChA's Call for an End to the Controversy
We would like to respond to all the unfounded criticism we have received lately in campus publica
tions. There is no need for there to be any question about whether MEChA is a racist and/or separatist
organization. An honest examination of our action and our philosophy would be sufficient to clearly
demonstrate the following:
• We are not radst. We are accepting of all races. We believe in the full equality of all people, regardless of
race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or creed;
• We are not separatist. Our motto is not nor ever has been "Por la raza todo, fuera de la raza nada";
• We do not endorse the Plan Espiritual de Aztlan. The document was written by the poet Alurista and amended
by the First Chicano National Conference in Denver, Colorado in March 1969, which predates the founding of
our organization (April 1969 in Santa Barbara);
•We do not blindly follow any other document, including the Plan of Santa Barbara, also written in 1969. We
do agree with the principles of educational advancement as a means of social advancement and recognizing
value in our culture, but also acknowledge that its rhetoric is dated, and inappropriate in these times;
• We see nothing wrong with choosing to self-identify with any term that denotes national origin or ethnicity,
whether Chicano, Hispanic, Mexican-American, Latino, etc.;
• We, the Stanford chapter of MEChA, are not subordinate to any national organization (in accordance with OSA
regulations). In fact, MEChA is a loosely organized association of campus chapters that are not directed by any
centrally organized body.
HOWEVER,
• We do promote fair labor practices for the benefit of communities and families;
• We do promote access to higher education for underprivileged youth mired in an educational system that has
failed them;
• We do promote cultural events on campus that celebrate Latino traditions and history, which contribute to the
Stanford community as a whole;
• We do promote the rights of immigrants regardless of national origin and encourage progressive immigration
reform;
• We do promote Chicano studies programs that affirm our value in the diverse American landscape;
• We do struggle for the social and economic equality of all peoples, and for the elimination of poverty, hopeless
ness, and despair too often experienced by minorities and working people in our society;
• We do work for greater democracy in the running of Colleges and Universities, including the representation of
students and employees in the decision making bodies of higher educational institutions;
• We do see MEChA, and the idea of a progressive socio-political awareness/activism group concerned with
Chicano/Latino issues, as an evolving idea that must adapt itself to our times and circumstances.
All of the above is demonstrated by our program of work, which in recent times has included support
for the campus anti-war effort, working through a coalition of campus organizations to establish a liv
ing wage for all Stanford workers, and promoting awareness about Proposition 54. We are sure that
anyone who studies our actions and involvement on campus will arrive at the conclusion that we are
not a racist or separatist organization, as we have been accused, but rather one of many social
activism groups at Stanford that strive for a more just world.

An Open Response to The Stanford Review
We, the members and allies of the Chicano/Latino community at Stanford, would like to express our
outrage at the illegitimate attacks made by the Editorial Board and Christine Boehm of The Stanford
Review not only about the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), but also El Centro
Chicano.
The Stanford Review made the implication that MEChA advocates separatism based on historical docu
ments that emerged from the Civil Rights Era, and therefore is a racist organization likened to the Ku
Klux Klan. Their comparison between MEChA and the KKK was not only invalid, but also disturbing,
considering the Klan's continued affiliation with white supremacy, intolerant philosophy, and prevalent
history of racial violence.
In addition, by questioning the use of MEChA Special Fee and suggesting that students should think
twice about supporting Special Fee, The Stanford Review compromised the financial stability of the
Chicano/Latino community. The Special Fee has never supported nor will ever support any racist
cause. In fact, MEChA is one of many organizations housed under El Centro Chicano dedicated to the
empowerment of Chicanos and Latinos, and their funds help to support programs sponsored by the
entire community, including Floricanto, Dfa de los Muertos, Posadas, Cesar Chavez Commemoration,
Raza Day Conference, Zoot Suit, Cinco de Mayo, Barrio Assistance/CHE Health Fair, Raza Medical
Students Association, CHE/Medical Students Buddy Program, Derechos, Chicano/Latino Graduation,
Los Hermanos, Familia, Queer Awareness Week, and Club Caliente. These events are integral to the
cultural and academic education of not only Chicano/Latino students, but the entire Stanford commu
nity.
While we respect that The Stanford Review should be granted the same freedom of speech as any other
organization on campus, we want to enlighten the Stanford community to the fact that their claims
about MEChA were false. We also hope that students will not make the same mistake of essentializing
the Chicano/Latino community ideology, which occurred when The Stanford Review included a picture
of El Centro Chicano. Both MEChA and El Centro Chicano advocate community building through unity.
