# SAE on alcohol probation for rest of year
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will remain on alcohol
suspension for the rest of the quarter and will be
on alcohol probation for the academic year. This
was the finding of an Oct. 9 hearing held on ac
count of an incident that occurred last spring in
volving a pledge who was taken to the hospital
after he drank beyond his limit while celebrating
his 20th birthday.
The fraternity was found to be not guilty of vio
lating the University's policy on hazing or the Fun
damental Standard. SAE was found to be responsi
ble for the consumption of alcohol by minors.
"We were pleased that the Organizational Con
duct Board [the University organization that han
dles violations committed by student groups]
agreed with our assessment of the situation," said
SAE President Jared Parker, a senior. "We take
the findings of the board very seriously and will
work hard to ensure that no further issues arise."
Last spring, the fraternity was temporarily
placed on alcohol suspension, which precludes any
gatherings in the house of more than five people
with alcohol present. This winter and spring, SAE
will be on alcohol probation, during which it will be
allowed to host parties, but will be subject to
stricter sanctions if it violates any party planning
guidelines.
In addition to the alcohol probation, SAE was
also told to revise its pledge guidelines and it has to
develop an alcohol education program with Ralph
Castro of Vaden Health Services. The SAE judi
ciary committee had already taken steps to revise
pledge guidelines after the conduct incident.
"SAE has a judiciary committee designed to in
ternally handle conduct issues," Parker said. "This
committee acted quickly and effectively after the
incident on April 29."
The status of SAE's house remains unclear. The
fraternity was placed on housing probation in Jan
uary 2002 for residential education issues and was
due for a hearing last May. The hearing with the
Greek Housing Review Board (GHRB) had to be
rescheduled as result of the conduct incident, and
will now be held on Nov. 6.
The Organizational Conduct Board had the op
tion of forwarding the SAE case to the GHRB if it
felt that housing sanctions were necessary. Al
though the OCB chose not to forward the case, the
GHRB will still see the results of the conduct hear
ing and will make a decision as to whether SAE
should extend its housing probatiorf, lose its house
or be taken off housing probation.
"We are very proud of the large strides we have
made since being placed on probation two years
ago," Parker said. "The probationary period gave
us the motivation to improve our chapter in a num
ber of areas. We are a stronger fraternity because
of it. That being said, we are looking forward to our
meeting with the Greek Housing Review Board
and anticipate our probation being lifted."
According to Parker, many SAE members and
supporters have been sporting "Save SAE" shirts
as part of "an effort to both raise funds and garner
community support" before the GHRB hearing.
