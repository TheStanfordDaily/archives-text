## GER changes help students 
### 
The Faculty Senate adopted a policy
on Thursday that will modify the way
in which General Education Re
quirements classes are identified. The
approved changes will enable students to
choose from a broader range of courses that
fulfill General Education Requirements start
ing in the fall of the 2004-05 school year. We
applaud the Faculty Senate for its decision,
which is in the best interest of both Universi
ty students and faculty.

The reform will benefit students by
providing them with a broader array of
options with which to satisfy the Univer
sity's General Education Requirements. The
new policy will place every letter-grade
class offered for three or more units under
one of the four areas defined by the Gen
eral Education Requirements. Although
individual schools will retain the power to
refuse GER classification for particular
classes, the majority of classes at Stanford
will soon fulfill one of the four areas of
the requirements.
Previously, faculty members had to com
plete an extensive review process to have
their courses fulfill a General Education Re
quirement. But with an automatic classifica
tion of courses in a particular area, faculty
members will no longer be responsible for
pushing their courses through the review
process. The new policy will ensure that
students receive the GER credit they de

serve for the classes in which they enroll
and will cut through red tape by reducing the pa
perwork professors must fill out.
Critics of the reform claim that the ap
proved proposal creates an unnecessary
amount of ambiguity in determining
which courses fulfill which requirements.
They also argue that every course at Stan
ford cannot necessarily be grouped into
one of the four sub-areas defined by the
requirements. But we believe that the four
areas of education identified by the Gen
eral Education Requirements are broad
enough to encompass nearly every area of
study at the University. Areas 2, 3 and 4
comprise the entirety of "techie" and
"fuzzy" studies and nearly everything in
between. Moreover, since individual
schools will still have the power to declare
that a particular course cannot be grouped
under one of the four areas, GER assign
ments won't be given to the few classes that
do not deserve them.
Students and faculty will both benefit
from the Faculty Senate's changes to the
General Education Requirements policy. By
providing students with more options with
which to satisfy General Education Require
ments, the Faculty Senate is helping to en
sure that students receive a balanced edu
cation and the decision allows faculty mem
bers to spend more time teaching and less time
dealing with bureaucratic red tape.
