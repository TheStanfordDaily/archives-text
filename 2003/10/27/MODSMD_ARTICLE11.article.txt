# Students overcharged on textbooks
## 
### 
The quarterly trip to the bookstore is a
dreaded ritual for most college stu
dents. Textbook expenses can add up
quickly. But, as reported in The New
York Times last week, students should be
aware that they can purchase books abroad for
much less even at half-price in some cases
with a few clicks of the mouse. We believe it is
wrong that textbook manufacturers charge sig
nificantly higher textbook prices in American
markets than in other parts of the world. And
we encourage students to take up this issue di
rectly with publishers and in the meantime find
ways to avoid overpriced domestic books by
purchasing from vendors abroad.
Most publishers sell textbooks to overseas
wholesale distributors for lower prices than to
U.S. distributors, resulting in higher shelf prices
in America. In response, students at American
colleges are now purchasing books from coun
tries like England, Singapore, Taiwan and
Malaysia to save money. Some U.S. college
bookstores are even purchasing materials from
overseas retailers and then passing the savings
along to students. And a few business-minded
students are pocketing profits by buying texts
in bulk from overseas and then selling them to
their classmates. However, most students do
not currently buy books abroad, and thus, they
are paying the higher U.S. prices.

Buying low-cost textbooks from abroad has
not been adopted on a larger scale due to the text
book companies' preventative measures. To
maintain their high profit margins in the U.S. mar
ket, some companies stipulate in sales contracts
that books sold to overseas distributors cannot be
repurchased by American companies for domes
tic distribution. The publishers also place adviso
ry stickers on foreign-sold books to discourage
their resale in North America.
Textbook publishers claim that prevailing
conditions and dominant market forces deter
mine American and foreign book pricing. But
this doesn't change the fact that American stu
dents are still shelling out more money for the
same products as their international peers as a
result of textbook manufacturer's practice of
price discrimination. This practice needs to
change.
When publishers artificially increase prices,
they ultimately hurt students the customers
they rely upon the most. As more American stu
dents discover that they are being overcharged,
we hope they will demand change in the pub
lishers' practices. Meanwhile, students should
take advantage of available options to obtain
cheaper overseas books. Companies may not ac
knowledge students' voices, but they will be
forced to change their actions when students
voice their concerns by shopping elsewhere.
