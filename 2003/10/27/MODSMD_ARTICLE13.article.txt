Joel is the man for the job
I could not agree more with your
editorial suggesting that Time maga

to offer as this year's Commencement

Commentary on
campustruth.org ad
As a recent alumnus of the Class of
'O3 and a former Daily writer and In
termission editor, my fondest memo
ries of Stanford include my time at
The Daily and the friends I made
there. In my time as a Stanford stu
dent, I was most impressed with The
Daily during the frequent instances
when it gave various segments of the
campus community the opportunity to
debate and discuss contested issues
such as affirmative action, the war in
Iraq, the Armenian genocide and, of
course, the situation in Israel and the
occupied Palestinian territories.
Despite this, I felt deep sadness
when I head that The Daily decided to
run campustruth.org's advertisement
last Friday. The advertisement's cre
ators clearly mean to draw a sharp dis
tinction between two alleged oppo
sites: peace loving, empathic Israelis
and sadistic, barbarous Palestinians.
But things are rarely so simple. The re
duction of an entire people to a fuzzy
image of an armed man and a menac
ing, faceless crowd is plainly racist. In
deciding to run the advertisement,
The Daily has served as an accomplice
to that racism.
In the past, Daily editors exercised
restraint in publishing advertisements
and opinion pieces that served only to
excite and incite those who hate, even
when it meant turning down valuable
advertising revenue in tight economic
times. The Daily's approach to the
David Horowitz article dealing with
affirmative action was an example of
this balance. You should apologize
not just to Palestinians and other
Arabs and Arab-Americans on cam
pus, but to the entire Stanford com
munity for your glaringly irresponsi
ble decision to participate as a mouth
piece for hate.
Regardless of whether The Daily
and its editors apologize or not, I am at
least reassured by the fact that the
overwhelming majority of people I
met while at Stanford at The Daily
and otherwise were decent, toler
ant, intelligent people who are unlike
ly to be swayed by an argument that, at
its core, relies on the persistent dehu
manization of the Palestinian people.

When I came upon a campus
truth.org advertisement in last Fri
day's edition of The Daily, I was pri
marily confused. Confusion turned to
astonishment, which turned to inex
pressible sadness. The half-page ad,
which compared the reactions of both
Israelis and Palestinians after the
Sept. 11 attacks, was not an expression

of our freedom of speech, but an ex
pression of hate. Only hate could pro
duce such biased and outright racist
propaganda as this. Are we, intelligent
individuals at this elite institution,
supposed to be brainwashed like id
iots by such inflammatory lies? Are
we supposed to believe that a whole
race of people is evil because of an in
cident that only a miniscule minority
may have been involved in after Sept.
11 and that every member of another
race is the embodiment of perfection?
This ad represents a sickness, and I am
appalled The Daily allowed it to be
placed.

KZSU a valuable service during
campus emergencies
When the Loma Prieta Earth
quake of 1989 struck Stanford and the
Bay Area,
KZSU's emergency power backup
systems kicked in and maintained our
continuous broadcasting capability.
KZSU was one of the critical campus
resources for information regarding
the scope of earthquake damage and
building safety.
I was a student at that time. It was
chaotic. I recall that many displaced
students from damaged houses on
campus relied on KZSU for informa
tion about where to go and what to do.
Stanford has since then spent mil
lions of dollars to improve its emer
gency preparedness. When the next
big earthquake hits or a massive
blackout (like the East Coast black
out) hits and there is no power to op
erate computers or televisions, then a
battery-operated radio tuned to
KZSU doesn't seem so bad. KZSU's
$98,000-per-year budget also doesn't
seem so bad either a drop in the
bucket compared to what the Univer
sity spent. And you can be certain that
RAs with emergency kits will be lis
tening to KZSU, as will the freshmen.

MEChA's motto not racist
In a letter to the editor about
MEChA ("MEChA should denounce
motto," Oct. 23), Win Reis, Class of
'BB, takes the assumption that
MEChA's motto is the racist "For the
race, everything ..." quote found in
El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan, which,
unlike The Review suggests, is not a
founding document. El Plan de Aztlan
was actually a document created by
the First Chicano Youth Liberation
Conference in Denver during March
1969, a month before the creation of
the first MEChA at UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Mr. Reis is the perfect example of
what a typical reader will get from The
Review articles. While The Review
cannot flat out lie and say El Plan's
statement is MEChA's motto, they
sure were able to suggest it and have
many people, including Mr. Reis, con
clude that it is. In fact, the MEChA
motto, as The Review is forced to
admit, is actually "La union hace la
fuerza," or "Unity creates strength."

Stanford MEChA's goal has al
ways been to fight racism, not con
done it. The sad reality is that in the
1960s and 19705, blacks and Latinos
were forced to create spaces in which
they could define an identity on their
own terms, moving beyond mere vic
timization and obj edification at the
hands of "Americans." Yes, some of
the language was strong and even
racist, but should we hold today's Chi
cano activists responsible for the
words activists used 35 years ago?
If people really want to know what
MEChA stands for, they should ask a
member of MEChA, not "Stanford's
conservative voice." The Review
could find nothing racist in either the
National MEChA's constitution or
Stanford MEChA's constitution.
They chose to use 35-year-old docu
ments that most MEChistas will admit
have racist rhetoric in them. They are
a part of MEChA's history, and we
should know what they represented
during that time, but we MEChistas
should not be held accountable for
them.
DANIEL HERRERA
Sophomore, Undeclared
Pipes wrong on Israel
In defending the extremist views of
Daniel Pipes, Sheree Roth displays her
obvious bias against Muslims ("In de
fense of Daniel Pipes," Oct. 22). It is a
pity Roth and Pipes choose to ignore
the hijacking of the Jewish faith by
Sharon and other Israeli fanatics who
have unleashed a reign of terror on the
Palestinians in pursuit of a "greater Is
rael." Under the smokescreen of rout
ing out terrorists, Israel has occupied
large swaths of Gaza and the West
Bank, demolished 11,000 homes and
murdered hundreds of innocent civil
ians including women and children.
The killing of innocent civilians by
suicide bombers is repugnant. The
killing of innocent civilians using heli
copter gun ships, tanks and bombs is
equally repugnant. Perhaps Roth is
not aware that Israeli reserve pilots re
fused to bomb civilians and presented
a signed petition stating they would
not take part in "illegal and immoral"
strikes in Palestinian areas in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. This follows
hundreds of reserve soldiers who have
pledged not to serve in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, stating they will "fight
no more to rule, deport, destroy,
blockade, exterminate, starve and hu
miliate the Palestinian people."
Israel's leading human rights group
B'Tselem recently reported that Israel
had violated 29 of the 30 articles of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Roth and Pipes would do well
to heed the advice of the great Rabbi
Eliezer Waldman, who heads a yeshi
va of Kiryat Arba: "Soldiers must not
follow and order that is against the
commandment of the Torah." Fanati
cism and murder is indefensible be
it Islamic militants or Jewish terrorists.
Finally, I am appalled that the
Hoover Institution chose to tarnish its
apolitical image by sponsoring Daniel
Pipes's talk.

clude that it is. In fact, the MEChA
motto, as The Review is forced to
admit, is actually "La union hace la
fuerza," or "Unity creates strength."

Stanford MEChA's goal has al
ways been to fight racism, not con
done it. The sad reality is that in the
1960s and 19705, blacks and Latinos
were forced to create spaces in which
they could define an identity on their
own terms, moving beyond mere vic
timization and obj edification at the
hands of "Americans." Yes, some of
the language was strong and even
racist, but should we hold today's Chi
cano activists responsible for the
words activists used 35 years ago?
If people really want to know what
MEChA stands for, they should ask a
member of MEChA, not "Stanford's
conservative voice." The Review
could find nothing racist in either the
National MEChA's constitution or
Stanford MEChA's constitution.
They chose to use 35-year-old docu
ments that most MEChistas will admit
have racist rhetoric in them. They are
a part of MEChA's history, and we
should know what they represented
during that time, but we MEChistas
should not be held accountable for
them.

Pipes wrong on Israel
In defending the extremist views of
Daniel Pipes, Sheree Roth displays her
obvious bias against Muslims ("In de
fense of Daniel Pipes," Oct. 22). It is a
pity Roth and Pipes choose to ignore
the hijacking of the Jewish faith by
Sharon and other Israeli fanatics who
have unleashed a reign of terror on the
Palestinians in pursuit of a "greater Is
rael." Under the smokescreen of rout
ing out terrorists, Israel has occupied
large swaths of Gaza and the West
Bank, demolished 11,000 homes and
murdered hundreds of innocent civil
ians including women and children.
The killing of innocent civilians by
suicide bombers is repugnant. The
killing of innocent civilians using heli
copter gun ships, tanks and bombs is
equally repugnant. Perhaps Roth is
not aware that Israeli reserve pilots re
fused to bomb civilians and presented
a signed petition stating they would
not take part in "illegal and immoral"
strikes in Palestinian areas in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. This follows
hundreds of reserve soldiers who have
pledged not to serve in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, stating they will "fight
no more to rule, deport, destroy,
blockade, exterminate, starve and hu
miliate the Palestinian people."
Israel's leading human rights group
B'Tselem recently reported that Israel
had violated 29 of the 30 articles of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Roth and Pipes would do well
to heed the advice of the great Rabbi
Eliezer Waldman, who heads a yeshi
va of Kiryat Arba: "Soldiers must not
follow and order that is against the
commandment of the Torah." Fanati
cism and murder is indefensible be
it Islamic militants or Jewish terrorists.
Finally, I am appalled that the
Hoover Institution chose to tarnish its
apolitical image by sponsoring Daniel
Pipes's talk.

Commentary on
campustruth.org ad
As a recent alumnus of the Class of
'O3 and a former Daily writer and In
termission editor, my fondest memo
ries of Stanford include my time at
The Daily and the friends I made
there. In my time as a Stanford stu
dent, I was most impressed with The
Daily during the frequent instances
when it gave various segments of the
campus community the opportunity to
debate and discuss contested issues
such as affirmative action, the war in
Iraq, the Armenian genocide and, of
course, the situation in Israel and the
occupied Palestinian territories.
Despite this, I felt deep sadness
when I head that The Daily decided to
run campustruth.org's advertisement
last Friday. The advertisement's cre
ators clearly mean to draw a sharp dis
tinction between two alleged oppo
sites: peace loving, empathic Israelis
and sadistic, barbarous Palestinians.
But things are rarely so simple. The re
duction of an entire people to a fuzzy
image of an armed man and a menac
ing, faceless crowd is plainly racist. In
deciding to run the advertisement,
The Daily has served as an accomplice
to that racism.
In the past, Daily editors exercised
restraint in publishing advertisements
and opinion pieces that served only to
excite and incite those who hate, even
when it meant turning down valuable
advertising revenue in tight economic
times. The Daily's approach to the
David Horowitz article dealing with
affirmative action was an example of
this balance. You should apologize
not just to Palestinians and other
Arabs and Arab-Americans on cam
pus, but to the entire Stanford com
munity for your glaringly irresponsi
ble decision to participate as a mouth
piece for hate.
Regardless of whether The Daily
and its editors apologize or not, I am at
least reassured by the fact that the
overwhelming majority of people I
met while at Stanford at The Daily
and otherwise were decent, toler
ant, intelligent people who are unlike
ly to be swayed by an argument that, at
its core, relies on the persistent dehu
manization of the Palestinian people.

When I came upon a campus
truth.org advertisement in last Fri
day's edition of The Daily, I was pri
marily confused. Confusion turned to
astonishment, which turned to inex
pressible sadness. The half-page ad,
which compared the reactions of both
Israelis and Palestinians after the
Sept. 11 attacks, was not an expression

of our freedom of speech, but an ex
pression of hate. Only hate could pro
duce such biased and outright racist
propaganda as this. Are we, intelligent
individuals at this elite institution,
supposed to be brainwashed like id
iots by such inflammatory lies? Are
we supposed to believe that a whole
race of people is evil because of an in
cident that only a miniscule minority
may have been involved in after Sept.
11 and that every member of another
race is the embodiment of perfection?
This ad represents a sickness, and I am
appalled The Daily allowed it to be
placed.

KZSU a valuable service during
campus emergencies
When the Loma Prieta Earth
quake of 1989 struck Stanford and the
Bay Area,
KZSU's emergency power backup
systems kicked in and maintained our
continuous broadcasting capability.
KZSU was one of the critical campus
resources for information regarding
the scope of earthquake damage and
building safety.
I was a student at that time. It was
chaotic. I recall that many displaced
students from damaged houses on
campus relied on KZSU for informa
tion about where to go and what to do.
Stanford has since then spent mil
lions of dollars to improve its emer
gency preparedness. When the next
big earthquake hits or a massive
blackout (like the East Coast black
out) hits and there is no power to op
erate computers or televisions, then a
battery-operated radio tuned to
KZSU doesn't seem so bad. KZSU's
$98,000-per-year budget also doesn't
seem so bad either a drop in the
bucket compared to what the Univer
sity spent. And you can be certain that
RAs with emergency kits will be lis

MEChA's motto not racist
In a letter to the editor about
MEChA ("MEChA should denounce

MEChA's motto is the racist "For the

El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan, which,
unlike The Review suggests, is not a
founding document. El Plan de Aztlan
was actually a document created by
the First Chicano Youth Liberation

1969, a month before the creation of
the first MEChA at UC-Santa Bar

Mr. Reis is the perfect example of
what a typical reader will get from The

cannot flat out lie and say El Plan's
statement is MEChA's motto, they
sure were able to suggest it and have
many people, including Mr. Reis, con

motto, as The Review is forced to
admit, is actually "La union hace la
