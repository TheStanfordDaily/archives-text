# JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK
## Diversity abounds at Frieze Art Fair 
### 
Writing about an art show
is like singing about a
football game: The in
tent to inform and en
lighten is there, but the tools
you're given are all wrong. So I'm
bowing to the limits of metaphor
(not to mention the limits of col
umn inches) and keeping my ac
count of London's first annual
Frieze Art Fair to an art-snobbish
minimum, which, considering the
event's hip, contemporary, fine art
focus, is still pretty snobby.
Held in a custom-built ware
house in Regent's Park last week
end, the fair brought together 118
galleries from across the globe to
hawk their wares to cultured, mon
eyed Brits. It was like an artsy
farmer's market except that stalls
cost up to $35,000 to rent, and the
merchandise was even pricier. Not
surprisingly, I went home empty
handed, but my notebook was full of
observations, which, for the time
being, are still free.
Keep Amerika beautiful!
Subject-wise, American im
agery was depicted in a pre
dictably unflattering way. A few
pieces like one featuring disem
bodied Disney characters at
tacked the United States through
symbolism; others depicted dis
turbing images of war, and some
work was accompanied by text.
The angst-filled sketches of
Muntean / Rosenblum simply said,
"Protest, support and act."
But the composition of the Frieze
Fair was far from anti-American.

There were dozens of galleries from
the United States represented —
mostly from New York City, the com

mercial art capital
of the world — and
plenty of Ameri
can-made art was
on display. Seeing
trademark work by
Cindy Sherman,
Ed Ruscha and
Ellsworth Kelly
made me miss As
sociate Prof, of Art
and Art History
Pam Lee's postwar
American art his-

tory class; or, more specifically, made
me miss Pam Lee.
I worship Pam Lee. I want to
marry her and have 10 million of her
babies.
Anybody who's anybody was there
Apparently Kate Moss, Hugh
Grant and Nigella Lawson were all
in attendance at some point. I didn't
spot any of them, but I did see some
major artists on display.
Lucian Freud: Sigmund's grand
son is thought by some to be the
greatest realist painter alive. His
sketch of a dead dog was my favorite.
Damien Hirst: One of his pieces
displayed at the fair sold for over
half-a-million dollars. Hirst, a pro
lific YBA (young British artist),
made a big splash in New York City
a few years ago when "Two Fuck
ing and Two Watching," a work
that depicted a rotting cow and
bull, was banned by public health
officials because the smell of the

carcasses "might prompt vomiting
among the visitors."
Takashi Murakami: Sadly, most
people know his work from those
tacky Louis Vuitton handbags. His
graphic paradise at Frieze was
much, much more deserving of
recognition.
Bridget Riley. Her trippy op-art
designs rely on geometry and / or
color to create movement across the
retina. I imagine it's especially great
to look at when you're high.
"I can't explain and I won't even try"
Neon sign by Tracey Emin
Paola Pivi built a large grass
slope in the middle of the space
"for visitors to roll down at their
leisure." It was very strange, but I
guess that was the point.
Installation art, while generally
impressive, seemed out of sync with
the fair's "buy me!" aesthetic. Cer
tain types of sculpture aren't really
suited for private ownership.
What does one do with a Dan
Flavin fluorescent tube-light corner
display, I wonder; use it as a very ex
pensive reading lamp?
Also, who is going to buy a life
sized, incredibly realistic (down to
the pubic hair tufts) naked woman
made out of wax? Madame Tous
sauds for perverts? After coming
dangerously close to dismantling a
pile of very expensive site-specific
bricks with my butt, I decided it
was time to go.
