## Map Quest explains modern journalism 
### 
After spending the week thinking
about artificial intelligence (AI),
I've come to the following conclu
sion: To understand what has
gone wrong with American journalism over
file last few decades, just use Map Quest.com
to plan your next trip.
As it happens, Stanford is a nice vantage
point from which to survey both the rise of
AI work of which Map Quest is a small
part and the demise of good storytelling
in journalism.
I'll start with AI. In the early 19605, re
searchers at SRI International developed the
A* algorithm to automate the process of
searching graphs for the shortest distance be
tween two points. A version of this algorithm
powers the ever-popular mapping applications
on the Web today.
SRI also pioneered one the world's first
robots, Shakey. A 1969 video on the organiza
tion's Web site shows a boxy wheeled contraption
bumping its way around a room as researchers
sporting sideburns and turtlenecks take notes.
Shakey's limited problem-solving abili
ty was powered by a few million-dollar
mainframe computers. More than three
decades later, Stanford undergraduates
used laptops to develop a virtual soccer
game in which teams of independent
"player" programs several to a side
compete against and react to each other in
real time. Al's progress over the years is
undeniable even to the untrained eye.
Humanities types, like graduate journal
ism students, used to dismiss the techies'
work. Computer programs will never write
poetry, newspaper columns or music, we said.
Enter David Cope, another AI luminary
who resides just down the road. A researcher at
UC-Santa Cruz, Cope has spent years experi
menting with software that can mimic the style
of various composers, including Bach, Chopin

and Mozart The software is so good that, in live
performances, even music aficionados can
have difficulty distinguishing between the
human- and machine-composed scores.
AI is just one of thousands of technological
advances of the last several decades that have
changed the world. From Moore's Law to the
Human Genome Project to missions to Mars,
science produces concrete results as it advances.

Faced with these results that science
just plain works when it comes to understand
ing the worldâ€”journalists did something
that should flatter scientists everywhere. We
copied them.
Academic journalists, including some who
teach in Stanford's Communication Depart
ment, say that something akin to the rote stan
dardization of the scientific method has re
placed storytelling and interpretation in most
newsrooms. Driven by a quixotic quest for ob
jectivity, they say, most journalism today has
become nothing more than a low-paying
cousin of technical writing.
Pick up three or four of your favorite news
papers and see how discouragingly similar all
of the major news stories are. You get the facts
upfront and quotes on both sides of the issue
from an expected and short list of sources.
Scientists conduct experiments in such a
way that other scientists can repeat the steps
and achieve the same results. Don't journal
ists, who produce much the same story from
a given set of facts, whether their employer
is The New York Times, The Washington
Post, or San lose Mercury News, do much
the same thing?
I wonder if people really want all this ob
jectivity that we exhaust ourselves pursuing.
Public opinion about journalism has never
been lower, and many of the traditional media
outlets that offer "objective" news are coping
with a dwindling number of readers, listeners
and viewers.
Perhaps this is because mainstream jour

nalism has traded narrative and storytelling
for formulaic prose.
Consider Fox News. My point is not to de
fend Fox's content I side with A 1 Franken,
so please save your letters but to point out
that the network's approach has resonated
with viewers.
If you have not noticed, Fox is smash
ing CNN and the other cable news compa
nies in the ratings. For all of its talk of
being fair and balanced, Fox is a mouth
piece for an overtly conservative and Re
publican view of the world.
The network does not just provide a for
mulaic treatment of the news. It offers sensi
ble analysis for those who share its orientation
and an infuriating demagoguery for those
who do not.
I think Fox is onto something.
Journalism fails when it produces news the
same way that Map Quest produces its direc
tions. Too often we apply our own version of
the A* algorithm, plugging in facts, turning
the crank and churning entirely predictable
articles out the other end.
I am an aspiring science writer and a fan of
technologies like Map Quest's. But think of
how much of the world is left out of its step-by
step directions.
Does it tell you which routes are especially
pretty on fall afternoons? Or where you can
stop along the way at the best used bookstore
around? Or about the roadside stand where
you can buy a Halloween pumpkin and the last
of the year's tomatoes from a small farmer?
There is not just one way from point A to
point B, and objectivity, as it turns out, is a
farce. Scientists, faced with all the contradic
tions inherent in the fields of relativity and
quantum mechanics, know this to be true.
It's time for journalists to figure it out, too.
