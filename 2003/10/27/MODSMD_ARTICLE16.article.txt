## Stanford should help G.E. workers 
### ALAYNA BUCKNER 
For most of the Stanford community, Oct.
31 means costumes and candy, tricks or treats.
However, for the 16 employees of Cardinal
Cogen, the power plant on Stanford campus,
Oct. 31 is an extremely serious day. Right now,
Cardinal Cogen employees are in contract
renegotiations with their employer General
Electric. Their current contract will expire at
midnight on Oct. 31, and the terms are much
scarier than Halloween will be. The contract
states:
"There shall be no strike, sit-down, slowdown,
sympathy strike, employee demonstration, hand
billing, leafleting, picketing or any other orga
nized or concerted activities by the Union or the
employees covered by this Agreement, and no
such interference with work shall be directly or
indirectly authorized or sanctioned by the union,
or their respective Officers or Steward, during
the term of this agreement."
A union prohibited from any "organized or
concerted activities" is hardly a union at all.
Moreover, this prohibition has had chilling ef
fects on other parts of their contract. For ex
ample, in recent years, the wages of Cardinal
Cogen workers have fallen significantly below
the pay of other campus workers who perform
similar jobs.
Why are Cardinal Cogen workers in this sit
uation at all?
Today's problem is the result of Stanford's
decision to subcontract turbine maintenance to
General Electric. This type of subcontracting
has two significant effects.
First, it divides the workers. Workers are
the driving force of a union; with only 16 mem
bers, Cardinal Cogen employees simply do not
have the same potential. Having many differ
ent employers, compounded with the threat of
shutting down an operation or switching to a
new contractor if employees organize effec
tively as has happened at Stanford in the

past ensures that subcontracting will make
it fundamentally more difficult for workers to
represent their interests.
Second, subcontracting allows Stanford to
deny responsibility for its workers. For exam
ple, normally it would be unimaginable for an
institution of higher learning to prohibit its
workers from passing out leaflets. However, by
subcontracting, Stanford can benefit from the
lower cost of disempowered workers without
having to set the unfair policies itself.
Stanford has the power to influence a con
tractor the University pays General Electric
and in this case it should use that influence.
Stanford must tell General Electric that these
16 workers should receive fair pay and that the
section in their contract prohibiting "concerted
activities" must be removed. Without interven
tion from Stanford, it is almost a guarantee that
these workers will not receive a fair contract.
On a more general level, it is time for the
University to rethink the way it subcontracts.
Gag rules have absolutely no place on a college
campus, yet the University does not systemati
cally monitor the practices of contractors, nor
has it set any explicit standards to which con
tractors must adhere. The time has come for
Stanford to address these standards by imple
menting a Code of Conduct for all on-campus
employers.
Our values as an institution require that we
treat the workers in our community with the same
respect, fairness, inclusiveness and celebration of
diversity that we proclaim for the rest of the Stan
ford community. If you, as a member of this com
munity, want to show your support for Cardinal
Cogen workers and demand that Stanford end its
misuse of subcontracted workers, please go to the
