## Fall sports get a little bit scary 
### 
I'd like to open the column with a
moment of silence in thanks and
praise for the fact that the Evil Em
pire (that's the Yankees, for those
of you who don't listen to Boston radio)
went down in flames to a young, fast,
determined Marlins squad this week
end.
Kudos to Juan Pierre, Pudge and a
23-year-old pitcher who took the ball
on short rest to pitch a victorious mas
terpiece in the 100th World Series game
played in Yankee Stadium.
Sidenote: This does not really stop
the pain left after Boston lost Game 7
two weeks ago ... but it does dull it a
little.
The end of the baseball season in the

Fall Classic was just
one sign this week
that we are truly out
of summer and head
ed toward winter.
There was also that
extra hour of sleep
yesterday (which I
certainly needed) and
the ridiculously early
sunset yesterday

evening. Pumpkins are everywhere.
The leaves are changing — well, not re
ally, as palm fronds tend to look the
same all the time, but if we lived on a
campus in a colder climate, maybe they
would be.
Time goes on, seasons change. And
if there is one thing that's great about
fall, it's football season.
Yeah yeah, football has been going
on for weeks. But things are really just
now beginning to get interesting, both
on the college and the pro circuit. The
contenders begin to distance them
selves from the pack, the pretenders fall
off the pace.
In the NFL, teams have to take a
hard look at where they are and what
needs to be done to get into the play
offs. Should the Jets bring back Pen
nington early? Should Fassel make an
other bold prediction in attempts to
motivate his team? Can the Broncos
possibly find a quarterback who won't
get injured? Can Terrell Owens come
up with more ridiculous celebrations?
And what the hell is wrong with the
Raiders?
In the college scene, it's a different
beast as teams enter the throes of the con
ference schedule, with the BCS and at
large bowl bids hang in the balance. Can
Miami stay undefeated? Can Oklahoma?
Who will come out of the Pacific-10?
And the question most important
for Cardinal fans out there ... will we
win another game?
Granted, Autzen is a horrifically dif
ficult place to play, and Oregon is a tal
ented team — just ask Michigan. Yet a
35-0 drubbing doesn't inspire much
confidence, even with those caveats.
The quarterback carousel continues.
Perhaps a string of games at home, as
the team has scheduled now, will prove
the soothing elixir needed to get back
on track. One can only hope.
The more frightening picture — it is
almost Halloween, after all — is the cos
mic twist that seems to have hit Stanford
athletics this fall. Men's soccer has fallen
from their pedestal as one of the peren
nial national-title contenders to the
ranks of an also-ran. Though the team
put up a good fight Friday night against
No. 1 UCLA, it was clear in the second
half that the Cardinal was overmatched.
Women's soccer has had its difficul
ties. The injury bug, tough breaks and a
few chances that could have gone the
other way have presented a season much
more difficult than many anticipated.
Now don't get the wrong idea here.
This is not Chicken Little screaming
out, "The sky is falling, the sky is
falling!" from the top of Hoover Tower.
Biased as I may be, I still feel that Stan
ford offers the best athletic-academic
combination of any university in this
country. So put a sock in it, Texas.
You can see them in Austin right
now, salivating as they see the soccer
teams struggling, the football team in
dire straits and men's water polo fight
ing it out against Cal, Pepperdine,
UCLA and USC. The Longhorns
thinking that this might be their year,
the year they finally take home the cov
eted Sears Cup.
Not so fast, I say. There's a lot of the
season left, with a lot of teams that have
yet to take the field.
As for the fall, let's hope the witch
ing hour passes us over, and the Cardi
nal is able to trade in some of these
tricks for more treats.

Ultimate Frisbee should be counted to
