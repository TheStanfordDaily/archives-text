# Cardinal hit by 35-0 shutout

EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford head coach
Buddy Teevens slowly leaned against the locker
room wall, his head turned down and face de
spondent. His opening statement to reporters,
which usually lasts several minutes, was terse and
somber.
Teveens' Cardinal squad had just been down
right humiliated by Oregon, 35-0, and it was
painfully clear that he was at a loss for words.
Finally, he put things in perspective with one
simple sentence.
"[Oregon] looked like the team that beat
Michigan," he said.
The rest of the Cardinal team would probably
agree with that assessment after the Ducks
showed the in-your-face play that it had been
missing for three games.
Terrence Whitehead rushed for a career-high
172 yards and two touchdowns, the two-headed
offensive monster of Kellen Clemens and Jason
Fife combined to complete an astonishing 23-of
27 passes for 265 yards and the Oregon defense
forced four turnovers as the Ducks (5-3, 2-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) regained the form they had
shown in defeating the then-No.3 Wolverines.
"I thought Oregon played with a lot of emo
tion," said fifth-year senior Chris Lewis, who
started at quarterback in place of the injured
Trent Edwards. "They were really fired up."
The Cardinal (2-4, 0-4 Pac-10) surely isn't
fired up anymore. It has now lost its last nine con
ference games dating back to the 2002 season and
has only beat lowly Arizona in Pac-10 play during
Teevens' year-and-a-half tenure.
"We're frustrated," said junior safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe. "It's tough losing."
Stanford was shut out for the first time in 83
games — a streak that dates back to its 1996 loss
to Wisconsin, 14-0.
The Cardinal entered the red zone twice with
out scoring — including an embarrassing seven
play sequence inside Oregon's two-yard line that
netted a total of minus-25 yards.
Probably one of the most downcast Stanford
players is Lewis, who completed just 12-of-26
passes for 188 yards and three interceptions.
His first of the three picks, however, might
have been the most costly.
After a punt by Oregon's Paul Martinez
pinned the Cardinal at its own two-yard line to
start the second quarter, Stanford was forced to
confront the unfriendly confines of Autzen Sta
dium up close.
Stanford faced third-and-eight from its own
four-yard line after the Ducks stuffed two runs by
junior Kenneth Tolon. Lewis dropped back to
pass and saw sophomore receiver Justin McCul
lum cutting across the middle of the field. But as
he released the ball, Lewis was hit by linebacker
Jerry Matson.
Kevin Mitchell, another Oregon linebacker,
snatched the flailing football out of the air and re
turned it nine yards for a game-changing touch
down.
All of a sudden, the Ducks were ahead 14-0,
and that Autzen mystique seemed to be buzzing
all around.
"They did a good job of disguising that de
fense," Lewis said. "I thought they were going to
bring the blitz on that, but [linebacker] Kevin
[Mitchell] dropped off and was right in the
throwing lane."
With the fifth-year senior at the helm,
Teevens seemed more comfortable throwing the
ball down the field and at times used five-receiv
er sets — something that he has rarely done with

Edwards in the game.
And Lewis did have some success going down the
field, including Stanford's longest play of the season
a 71-yard strike to true freshman wideout Mark
Bradford midway through the second quarter.
"He made things happen during the course of the
game," Teevens said.
But what about all those mistakes?
"He was under pressure and was rushed in the pock
et," Teevens said. "I didn't see some of the routes develop
as well."
Lewis was sacked four times but seemed to hold
on to the ball too long at times and admitted he tried
to force some passes.
Whitehead, meanwhile, gave the Stanford defense
fits all afternoon with his shifty, elusive running. On his
second score a 44-yard touchdown run he took a
sweep right, saw nothing there, cut back across the en
tire field and eventually found his way through the
middle, reaching the end zone untouched.
"He was really good at making moves, cutting back
across the defense," Atogwe said. "We were over
pursuing and he would cut back [to the] weak side, get
one block and be off the gate."
The Cardinal defense, though, may have worn
down early against the Ducks. The Oregon offense
controlled the ball for nearly 13 minutes in the first
quarter alone and ran 27 plays to Stanford's six.
"Their offense was out there controlling the
clock," Atogwe said. "They were doing a lot of short
routes and running the ball here and there."
Stanford made a concerted effort to get senior re
ceiver Luke Powell more involved in the offense. The
high school quarterback fined up several times under
center, taking the snap and running left or right
In the end, he finished with only one catch for 16
yards, and again was unable to provide a big play.
But, with Oregon's defense consciously taking
Powell out of the game, Bradford was able to take ad
vantage.
Arguably the lone bright spot, Bradford, who finished
with career-highs in catches (seven) and yards (153), is al
ready beginning to showcase the athletic abilities that
made him such highly coveted recruit.
"I'm adjusting and the quarterbacks are starting to
find me," he said. "I'm starting to figure out what's
going on more."
Kyle Matter played Stanford's final series and
completed three-of-seven passes for 37 yards. Ac
cording to Teevens, Matter played out of circum
stance the circumstance being a blowout.
"Chris took some lumps today so we opted to get
Kyle some snap time," he said.
So, what's the quarterback situation for next
week?
"Chris is our starter right now," Teevens said.
"We'll look and assess how things are and see where
Trent is this week."
