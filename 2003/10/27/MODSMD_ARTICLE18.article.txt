# Cardinal hit by 35-0 shutout

EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford head coach
Buddy Teevens slowly leaned against the locker
room wall, his head turned down and face de
spondent. His opening statement to reporters,
which usually lasts several minutes, was terse and
somber.
Teveens' Cardinal squad had just been down
right humiliated by Oregon, 35-0, and it was
painfully clear that he was at a loss for words.
Finally, he put things in perspective with one
simple sentence.
"[Oregon] looked like the team that beat
Michigan," he said.
The rest of the Cardinal team would probably
agree with that assessment after the Ducks
showed the in-your-face play that it had been
missing for three games.
Terrence Whitehead rushed for a career-high
172 yards and two touchdowns, the two-headed
offensive monster of Kellen Clemens and Jason
Fife combined to complete an astonishing 23-of
27 passes for 265 yards and the Oregon defense
forced four turnovers as the Ducks (5-3, 2-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) regained the form they had
shown in defeating the then-No.3 Wolverines.
"I thought Oregon played with a lot of emo
tion," said fifth-year senior Chris Lewis, who
started at quarterback in place of the injured
Trent Edwards. "They were really fired up."
The Cardinal (2-4, 0-4 Pac-10) surely isn't
fired up anymore. It has now lost its last nine con
ference games dating back to the 2002 season and
has only beat lowly Arizona in Pac-10 play during
Teevens' year-and-a-half tenure.
"We're frustrated," said junior safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe. "It's tough losing."
Stanford was shut out for the first time in 83
games — a streak that dates back to its 1996 loss
to Wisconsin, 14-0.
The Cardinal entered the red zone twice with
out scoring — including an embarrassing seven
play sequence inside Oregon's two-yard line that
netted a total of minus-25 yards.
Probably one of the most downcast Stanford
players is Lewis, who completed just 12-of-26
passes for 188 yards and three interceptions.
His first of the three picks, however, might
have been the most costly.
After a punt by Oregon's Paul Martinez
pinned the Cardinal at its own two-yard line to
start the second quarter, Stanford was forced to
confront the unfriendly confines of Autzen Sta
dium up close.
Stanford faced third-and-eight from its own
four-yard line after the Ducks stuffed two runs by
junior Kenneth Tolon. Lewis dropped back to
pass and saw sophomore receiver Justin McCul
lum cutting across the middle of the field. But as
he released the ball, Lewis was hit by linebacker
Jerry Matson.
Kevin Mitchell, another Oregon linebacker,
snatched the flailing football out of the air and re
turned it nine yards for a game-changing touch
down.
All of a sudden, the Ducks were ahead 14-0,
and that Autzen mystique seemed to be buzzing
all around.
"They did a good job of disguising that de
fense," Lewis said. "I thought they were going to
bring the blitz on that, but [linebacker] Kevin
[Mitchell] dropped off and was right in the
throwing lane."
With the fifth-year senior at the helm,
Teevens seemed more comfortable throwing the
ball down the field and at times used five-receiv
er sets — something that he has rarely done with

Stanford in the past 83 games, halted a three-game losing streak for the Ducks.
