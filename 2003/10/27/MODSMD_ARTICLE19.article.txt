# Offense fumbles chances to score
## 
### NATHAN KURZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
EUGENE, Ore. Offensive coordinator David Kelly was pret
ty astute in explaining Stanford's offensive struggles against Oregon
on Saturday.
"We probably did the best job we have all year of moving the ball
up and down the field," he said. "And then when we got into tough
territory, we didn't execute the way we need to beat a team of this
caliber."
In other words, the Cardinal didn't come through when it count
ed. It could neither muster a big play nor move the ball a good six
inches in a key situation.
When a team gets shut out for the first time in 83 games, it will
probably ask itself, "So where did we go wrong?"
Two of Stanford's first four possessions and a meaningless series
in the second half represented much of the Cardinal's failure.
Although it may have not seemed like it at the time, Stanford's
first series was a huge one. Oregon had just motored down the field
on its first possession for a score, and if the Cardinal was going to be
competitive in Eugene, a nice momentum boost would be the quick
answer.
And so on Stanford's second play from scrimmage, head coach
Buddy Teevens went for it all.
He called Luke Powell's number except that Powell was the
one throwing the pass. The gadget play, where Powell took a quick
toss from quarterback Chris Lewis and then looked downfield, al
most worked perfectly.
Wide receiver Mark Bradford had separated from his defender
by at least 10 yards, but Powell overthrew the freshman, and a pos
sible big play turned into just another incompletion.

"The play definitely worked," Bradford said. "I think it was a
matter of miscommunication between me and Luke."
Added Lewis: "Anything we can do to get the ball in the end
zone, we are going to try."
Then, on Stanford's third possession, Lewis and company drove
to Oregon's 22-yard line before the drive stalled. But Michael Sgroi,
kicking into a 12-mile per hour wind, missed a 39-yard field goal
wide right.
As deflating as the missed field goal was, Stanford's next posses
sion would prove even more galling.
On the first play, Lewis, after faking a handoff, found Bradford
streaking down the field for a 71-yard completion that would have
gone for a touchdown had the freshman wide receiver not been
pushed out at the Oregon five-yard line.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal had first-and-goal to go and a great
opportunity to get back into a game it trailed 21-0 with less than six
minutes remaining in the first half.
After two plays for no gain, Lewis got desperate and telegraphed
a pass to a covered Powell near the goal line that was intercepted by
Ducks cornerback David Martin.
"It was a three-step drop and I was trying to get him the ball
early," Lewis said. "I didn't see the linebacker flashing across.
"If I could take that throw back, I would take it back. But they
did a good job of [defending] that play."
Yet as maddening as that goal-line series turned out to be, Stan
ford's next and last chance deep inside Oregon territory could turn
out to be the most exasperating series of the season.
After a fumble by Oregon wide receiver Marcus Maxwell was re
covered by Trevor Hooper at the Ducks' 40-yard line, Stanford
drove all the way to the one-yard
line with two long passes to Brad
ford sandwiched around a two-yard
J.R. Lemon run.
Here occurred possibly one of
the most pathetic offensive se
quences of any Stanford offense in
recent memory.
The Cardinal had seven chances
near the Oregon goal line five
from the one-yard line and two from
the two-yard marker but could
not put the ball in the end zone. (It
got a second set of chances because
the Ducks were called for a face
mask penalty after sacking Lewis on
the first third-and-goal.)
Stanford had one run for minus
one yard, four runs for no gain, and
was sacked twice.
In total, instead of moving six inch

es forward for a score, the Cardinal
moved 25 yards backward over seven
plays, preserving the Ducks' shutout.
"I think the stand at the goal line
was maybe one of the greatest things
I've ever seen," Oregon coach Mike
Bellotti said.
But what if you are Stanford?
How can you possibly even begin to
comprehend what happened?
"The bottom line is, when you are
that close to the goal line, it comes
down to the man-on-man situations
because the real estate is reduced,"
Kelly said. "In those scenarios, our
man has to beat their man. There's
nothing magical about that."
One thing is clear. Stanford has a
lot of execution problems to work out.
"Three weeks ago, everybody
was telling us that we couldn't throw
the football," Kelly said. "Our kids
have had tons of improvement in
those areas but now we have to go
back and get better in the situational
part of it that we had been pretty
good at until [Saturday]."
