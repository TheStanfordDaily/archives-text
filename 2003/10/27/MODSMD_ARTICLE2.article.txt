# Donor dedicates Clark Center
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Big donors, university administrators
and Bio-X researchers turned out Friday to
see what the newly inaugurated Clark Cen
ter was about. Amid medical school profes
sors in scrubs, graduate students in shorts
and politicians in suits, Jim Clark, the chief
donor for the building, spoke of bridging
gaps in science and looking toward the fu
ture.
"I don't know where advances will take
us," Clark said, "but like all of us, I can't
wait to find out."
University President John Hennessy
and Matthew Scott, the chair of the Bio-X
Leadership Council, also addressed the
crowd, which took tours of the open build
ing while many researchers continued their
work. Norman Foster, the building's archi
.tect gave a presentation which highlighted
the center's atmosphere and how the design
fits with the goals of the program, to foster
more connections between disciplines.
Clark gave a glimpse into his reasons for
donating the funds for the building, which
totalled approximately $9O million. But he
did not mention his decision in 2001 to sus
pend $6O million of his original $l5O million
pledge due to President George Bush's an
nouncement to limit federal funding of
stem-cell research.
Clark said that seven years ago he con
sidered returning to Stanford to become a
professor and do research in computer sci
ence and biology. But Clark, a professor at
Stanford for three years before founding
Silicon Graphics and Netscape, decided
that there were other options.
"I realized it would be a lot more effi
cient just to fund a big project than become
a professor," he said. "A lot easier, too."
Clark related the project to his own ca
reer and his experience in research and

later in the private sector.
"In my career, every major accomplish
ment occurred when I made changes and
crossed disciplines," he said.
Clark also said he wanted to give back to
the University that gave him a jump-start in
his career, allowing him to take his innova
tions from the engineering labs and start Sil

icon Graphics.
Hennessy spoke of how the Clark Cen
ter unites the campus in research and phys
ical dimensions. It sits between the School
of Engineering and the Medical School and
planners hope it will encourages people on
both sides of Campus Drive to collaborate.
The University knew that "many future

scientific breakthroughs would come at an
intersection of disciplines," he said. "What
we did not have was a facility that could act
as a nucleus. The Clark Center meets that
need."
Hennessy emphasized that the new

building was not meant to limit the
scope of Bio-X. He pointed that be
yond the 40 research labs housed in
the building, there are more than 200
faculty members involved in the pro
gram throughout campus.
Calling the center a "vanguard of a
new era," Hennessy pointed out that
the National Institutes of Health have
pledged $2 billion over six years to
ward the type of interdisciplinary re

search that Bio-X is pioneering.
Scott said that the facility was de
signed with students in mind, allow
ing graduate students to cross disci
plines and try out new ideas more eas

"The people who stand to benefit
most are the young people who we
hope to make fearless," Scott said,
emphasizing that young people make
the breakthroughs that unite fields of
science.
Clark said he was "stunned" by
the building when he first saw it, and
that he thought it would make a great
place to do research.
