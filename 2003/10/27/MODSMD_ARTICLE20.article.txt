# Men defeat No.6 UC-San Diego
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a contest that resembled a family re
union, the No. 3 Cardinal men's water
polo team delivered a firm lesson to No. 6
UC-San Diego in its 13-7 victory at the
Avery Aquatic Complex on Friday. The
non-league victory puts Stanford at 12-3
for the season.
Friday night's face-off was a fraternal
affair. Sophomore Thomas Hopkins'
older brother Jonathan is the Triton's
leading scorer and Thomas, a sophomore,
is the second leading scorer for the Cardi
nal. San Diego's Matt Ellis is the younger
brother of Stanford goalie Nick Ellis, Class
of 2002. And Stanford's assistant coach
Brian Kreutzkamp led his team against the
Triton's assistant coach (and brother)
Brad Kreutzkamp.
"We couldn't have come into this game
better," said junior driver Tony Azevedo.
The Cardinal came out to a strong start
with three goals in the first two minutes of
the game, starting with an easy lob by
sophomore driver Peter Varellas 42 sec
onds into the match which was quickly fol
lowed by goals from juniors Greg Crum
and Azevedo.
The Tritons answered with two goals by
sophomore Chris Finegold, to bring the
score to 3-2. Junior driver Matt Moser
scored on a power play with 2:11 left and
was matched by a San Diego goal with 0:59

in the first. Freshman driver JJ Garton
brought it into the net with 21 seconds left,
to end the first period with a 5-3 Cardinal
lead.
Though filled with active play, the high
light of the period may have been a pause
in play to retrieve the missing cap of one of
the San Diego players. The Cardinal was
only ahead by two at the end of the first,
but the tempo was clearly with Stanford
the entire game.
"They're a talented team," said Azeve
do. "But I think that they know if we're on
our game, there's no way they can beat us.
If they know that we're on our game, it's
hard to keep up with us, and coming out
three-nothing from the start puts a
thought in the back of their heads, 'Oh, it's
alright if we lose.'"
The Tritons trailed off in the second
period, with more of the team's energy
spent yelling at the refs to call fouls and ex
aggerated groans of pain to draw the offi
cials' attention than on playing the game.
With another goal by Varellas and two by
Azevedo, the Cardinal extended its lead to
8-4 at halftime.
Azevedo continued his powerful play,
ending the third period on a deep shot with
three seconds left. The Triton defense
held back as he sprinted down the pool for
a lob from the perimeter, leaving the score
