# Soccer shutout in pair of Pac-10 games
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Painful. That's the only way to describe
the weekend games played by the Cardinal
men's soccer team.
There was pain in watching junior for
ward James Twellman aim a corner kick in
to junior Matt Janusz, who headed the ball
at the net... only to see it fly wide left.
There was pain in watching senior mid
fielder Mike Wilson hit a solid left-footed
shot toward the g0a1... only to see it jet be
yond the goal, a foot above the crossbar.
There was pain in watching freshman
midfielder Marcus Ryan fire off a strong
shot in traffic ... only to see it blocked by a
defender in the right place at the right time.
And there was pain in watching the Stan
ford squad creating opportunities on the
field with heart and energy ... only to see it
chalk up another loss because of simple bad
luck.
The Cardinal (2-12-2,0-7 Pacific 10 Con
ference) played fiercely in both of its
matchups with No. 1 UCLA (13-1-0, 6-0
Pac-10) and Fresno State (5-10-0, 2-5 Pac
-10), but it was ultimately shutout in the pair
of conference games with scores of 2-0 and
1-0, respectively.
Noting the aggressive play of his team,
Stanford head coach Bret Simon said that
he really isn't able to pin the fact that the
Cardinal has been shutout in its last six
games on any mistakes on the field.
"It's a bit of a mystery," Simon said of
Stanford's scoring drought. "Goals are part
confidence, and they are contagious. When
you're not scoring, you go in thinking that
every shot you take might not go in. That's
a hard thing to overcome."
The large crowd at Friday night's game
witnessed a hard-fought battle, as the noto
riously quick UCLA squad encountered a
Cardinal team determined to avenge last
weekend's 3-0 loss to the Bruins.
Stanford's defense came alive in the
matchup, holding UCLA to only 12 shots,
or almost half the number of shots it al
lowed last weekend.
Despite improving on its defensive ef
fort from last Sunday, UCLA's freshman
forward Chad Barrett still managed to slip a
short shot past Stanford goalkeeper, junior
Robby Fulton, in the 28th minute. The goal
was Barrett's seventh on the season.
"The thing that's made the biggest dif
ference is that we've had an easy time mix
ing our seniors and freshmen," said UCLA
head coach Tom Fitzgerald of his top

ranked squad. "The old guys have brought
in the new guys very well and our freshmen
are finding success."
Fitzgerald's veterans put together one
more scoring drive with 15 minutes left in
the half, when junior Mike Enfield put in a
shot after a cross from senior Matt Taylor.
Fulton dove for the low ball, but couldn't
get to it from his position.
The Bruins were held goal-less after the
break, but the Cardinal was only able to get
one shot off in the second half, which se
cured the shutout.
"We're getting unlucky with the goals
against us, and we're getting unlucky with
the goals we try to score," junior midfielder
Aaron Maines said. "But we're giving the
full 90 minutes. Every player is out there
giving his all."
Sunday's matchup with the unranked
Bulldogs was an even closer contest.
"Sunday afternoons especially are hard
games, since we just played on Friday in
front of a large crowd," Maines said. "And
the game with UCLA is a big rivalry so we
exerted a lot of energy [in Friday's game]."
The game remained scoreless until the
38th minute, when Fresno State senior mid
fielder found himself in a one-on-one with
Fulton and won.
Stanford fought to even up the score
throughout the game, racking up 13 shots in
the game to the Bulldogs' 10. Junior for
ward Darren Fernandez led the way for the
Cardinal with three shots, all on goal.
Six other Stanford players recorded
shots, and Janusz and Ryan came off the
bench to combine for five. But all flew wide
or were stopped by sophomore Eric Krons
berg, who posted six saves on the afternoon.
"We gave a good effort," Simon said.
"We're playing better very hard: better than
we did three weeks ago and much better
than we did at the beginning of the season."
As for what it will take for the Cardinal to
break its losing streak, Simon contends that
scoring one goal will change everything.
"Once that one goal comes," he said,
"The goals will keep coming."
Maines is also optimistic about the fu
ture of his team.
"With our record, it doesn't seem like
the postseason will happen for us," Maines
admitted. "But instead of letting ourselves
go the other way, we're creating chances
and playing hard, because we know what
we're doing now will build for next year."
The Cardinal will travel north this week
end for another pair of Pac-10 contests.
Stanford faces Washington on Friday at 7
p.m. and Oregon State at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

Freshman midfielder Galen Thompson evades a Fresno State defender in yesterday's
1-0 loss to the Bulldogs. The Cardinal men are looking for a conference win
to end a six-game losing skid.
Painful. That's the only way to describe
the weekend games played by the Cardinal
men's soccer team.
There was pain in watching junior for
ward James Twellman aim a corner kick in
to junior Matt Janusz, who headed the ball
at the net... only to see it fly wide left.
There was pain in watching senior mid
fielder Mike Wilson hit a solid left-footed
shot toward the g0a1... only to see it jet be
yond the goal, a foot above the crossbar.
There was pain in watching freshman
midfielder Marcus Ryan fire off a strong
shot in traffic ... only to see it blocked by a
defender in the right place at the right time.
And there was pain in watching the Stan
ford squad creating opportunities on the
field with heart and energy ... only to see it
chalk up another loss because of simple bad
luck.
The Cardinal (2-12-2,0-7 Pacific 10 Con
ference) played fiercely in both of its
matchups with No. 1 UCLA (13-1-0, 6-0
Pac-10) and Fresno State (5-10-0, 2-5 Pac
-10), but it was ultimately shutout in the pair
of conference games with scores of 2-0 and
1-0, respectively.
Noting the aggressive play of his team,
Stanford head coach Bret Simon said that
he really isn't able to pin the fact that the
Cardinal has been shutout in its last six
games on any mistakes on the field.
"It's a bit of a mystery," Simon said of
Stanford's scoring drought. "Goals are part
confidence, and they are contagious. When
you're not scoring, you go in thinking that
every shot you take might not go in. That's
a hard thing to overcome."
The large crowd at Friday night's game
witnessed a hard-fought battle, as the noto
riously quick UCLA squad encountered a
Cardinal team determined to avenge last
weekend's 3-0 loss to the Bruins.
Stanford's defense came alive in the
matchup, holding UCLA to only 12 shots,
or almost half the number of shots it al
lowed last weekend.
Despite improving on its defensive ef
fort from last Sunday, UCLA's freshman
forward Chad Barrett still managed to slip a
short shot past Stanford goalkeeper, junior
Robby Fulton, in the 28th minute. The goal
was Barrett's seventh on the season.
"The thing that's made the biggest dif
ference is that we've had an easy time mix
ing our seniors and freshmen," said UCLA
head coach Tom Fitzgerald of his top

ranked squad. "The old guys have brought
in the new guys very well and our freshmen
are finding success."
Fitzgerald's veterans put together one
more scoring drive with 15 minutes left in
the half, when junior Mike Enfield put in a
shot after a cross from senior Matt Taylor.
Fulton dove for the low ball, but couldn't
get to it from his position.
The Bruins were held goal-less after the
break, but the Cardinal was only able to get
one shot off in the second half, which se
cured the shutout.
"We're getting unlucky with the goals
against us, and we're getting unlucky with
the goals we try to score," junior midfielder
Aaron Maines said. "But we're giving the
full 90 minutes. Every player is out there
giving his all."
Sunday's matchup with the unranked
Bulldogs was an even closer contest.
"Sunday afternoons especially are hard
games, since we just played on Friday in
front of a large crowd," Maines said. "And
the game with UCLA is a big rivalry so we
exerted a lot of energy [in Friday's game]."
The game remained scoreless until the
38th minute, when Fresno State senior mid
fielder found himself in a one-on-one with
Fulton and won.
Stanford fought to even up the score
throughout the game, racking up 13 shots in
the game to the Bulldogs' 10. Junior for
ward Darren Fernandez led the way for the
Cardinal with three shots, all on goal.
Six other Stanford players recorded
shots, and Janusz and Ryan came off the
bench to combine for five. But all flew wide
or were stopped by sophomore Eric Krons
berg, who posted six saves on the afternoon.
"We gave a good effort," Simon said.
"We're playing better very hard: better than
we did three weeks ago and much better
than we did at the beginning of the season."
As for what it will take for the Cardinal to
break its losing streak, Simon contends that
scoring one goal will change everything.
"Once that one goal comes," he said,
"The goals will keep coming."
Maines is also optimistic about the fu
ture of his team.
"With our record, it doesn't seem like
the postseason will happen for us," Maines
admitted. "But instead of letting ourselves
go the other way, we're creating chances
and playing hard, because we know what
we're doing now will build for next year."
The Cardinal will travel north this week
end for another pair of Pac-10 contests.
Stanford faces Washington on Friday at 7
p.m. and Oregon State at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
