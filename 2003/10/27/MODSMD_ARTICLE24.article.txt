# Globalization raises question of healthy food
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An educational conference on
food and environmental issues was
held Saturday at Kresge Auditori
um and the Cantor Center for Visu
al Arts. The conference, called
"Planet on our Plate," informed at
tendees about the environmental
dangers of genetically engineered
food, over-fishing and free trade.
Susan Stansbury, the project di
rector, said that due to globaliza
tion, fossil fuels are unnecessarily
expended in order to transport pro
duce and that excess packaging
causes wasted resources. She also
complained that free trade benefits
big business at the expense of small
farmers.
"The winners of free trade are
agro business," Stansbury said.
"The losers are the farmers. It is
cheaper to buy food from Chili than

to buy it from five miles away."
Stansbury added that farmers
could use cooperatives to help them
save money and compete with larg
er farms.
Aside from globalization, Patri
cia Becker, the manager of Com
mon Ground Garden Supply and
Education Center, argued for the
desirability of organic food over
processed food. Organic food is
farm produce that is grown locally
without the use of pesticides.
"Organic food keeps your mind
more alert and your body healthier,"
she said. "You need less sleep and
you have more energy. It is better for
the environment and farmers."
Although organic food costs
more than processed food, Jan Pe
terson, Becker's coworker, said
"It's less expensive if you look at the
cost to the environment."
According to the event's Web
site, genetically engineered food

presents a different danger from
that of processed food. Their pam
phlet raises the concern that animal
genes could be merged with other
animal or vegetable genes, and the
new food product might conflict
with the dietary standards of Jews,
Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and
Catholics. According to informa
tion distributed at the conference,
genetically engineered food is poor
ly documented and possibly un
healthy. Sometimes genetically
modified fish can escape from fish
ing farms, reproduce in the wild and
take away resources from wild fish
that are living there, according to
the materials.
Meredith Lopuch, the supervisor
of the World Wildlife Fund's Com
munity Fisheries program, said that
over fishing provides another threat
to marine life.
"Some of the U.N. statistics sug
gest that 70 percent of the world's

fisheries are at capacity or depleted
and overexploited," she said.
To deal with this problem, Lop
uch said that the Marine Steward
ship counsel provides a "market
based incentive program that helps
consumers drive conservation
change."
Jennifer Dianto, the manager of
the Monterey Bay Aquarium's
Seafood Watch program, said that
44 billion pounds of fish are by
catch, meaning that they are
caught, killed and then thrown
overboard. About a quarter of the
world's catch is thrown back into
the sea after they have already
been killed.
Dianto said there are many rea
sons for these practices.
"Either the fishers don't have
the right permit, the fish don't have
any market value or the fishers are
looking for something else," Dianto
said.
