# Hospital's midwife program to close
## 
### ARAM HUR 
Due to financial setbacks, the
midwife program at Stanford's
Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital will close in January.
After nine years of devoted
service under Stanford's Obstet
rics / Gynecology (OB / GYN)
Department, the closing will af
fect mothers-to-be who prefer to
give birth at home.
"The intent of the program
was to give pregnant women an
alternative method of delivery,"
said the program's founder, Dr.
Maurice Druzin.
According to Druzin, natural
birthing is not necessarily health
ier, but it "allows nature to take
its course with minimum inter
vention."
Linda Walsh, a midwife and
co-director of the program, said
that midwifery is "a wonderful
way to establish an intimate rela
tionship with the patient."
Rather than placing the life of
her baby and herself in the hands
of cold medical tools, the mother
is able to birth in a soothing set
ting with people that she knows
personally.
Midwives are specially
trained nurses with graduate de
grees. According to Walsh, a
midwife's relationship with the
mother develops far before
birth. The midwife acts as a con
fidant to the mother during preg
nancy, counseling her on issues
ranging from delivering worries
to where to buy baby clothes. In
short, the midwife can become
the mother's trusted friend.
According to Druzin, fi
nances were the single obstacle
that clashed head on with the
program. Health insurance costs
jumped 50 percent while mainte
nance costs were stagnant. "Re
imbursement was just too low,"
Walsh said.
The dragging economy
proved fatal to the service. The
only mothers who could afford
the service were those with
high medical insurance. The
OB / GYN Department faced
a deadlock when it had to meet

the insurance costs as well as
pay the expert nurses high
fees.
As the deficit kept growing,
demand continued to rise. "The
service was actually expanding,"
Walsh said.
However, this steady increase
was not enough to sustain the
program. When the midwives
were left with the choices of hour
cutbacks or layoffs, it was agreed
that the program would not be
able to continue.
The service has begun to take
steps toward closure. Instead of
24-hour work days, midwives are
now only available from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m, seven days a week. The
limited hours have turned away
some mothers already. The pos
sibility that they might not be
able to have their midwives next
to them at crucial times daunted
many.
"It defeats the whole purpose
of getting a midwife," said one
anonymous mother who recently
decided to use medical treat
ment instead of midwifery. "It's
all about having someone next to
you, but if you have to go under
the knife just because she's not
there, I don't know."
Although he knows that many
women will miss the midwife
program, Druzin acknowledges
that the closing of the program
was the only viable solution.
"When expenditure exceeds
income, there's really nothing
you can do about it," Druzin
said.
The closing of the service,
while "financially positive" for
the OB / GYN Department, will
limit the working opportunities
available in the area for midwife
nurses.
Walsh's response to the out
come was a sigh and the brief
words, "Very sad." She hopes,
however, that the practice will
never become completely obso
lete. While Walsh herself will not
work as a midwife for the time
being, she says that many mid
wives offer service from their
private homes or midwifery as
sociations.
