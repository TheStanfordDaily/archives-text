## Admissions officals say race is not an issue 
### CHARLES PROCTOR DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES University of
California at Los Angeles application readers con
sider a wide range of factors when they evaluate
applicants though race isn't one of them, said
two high-ranking campus admissions officials.
Both officials sought to explain why UCLA ad
mitted several hundred applicants with low SAT I
scores and turned away over a thousand appli
cants with significantly higher scores in 2002, ac
cording to a UCLA report released on Tuesday.
Vu Tran, director of admissions at UCLA, said
some of the disparity between who was admitted
and their test scores could be explained by the
wide range of factors readers weigh when they
evaluate applications.
"The students in the very low range [of SAT
scores] were admitted essentially because they
still demonstrated academic excellence in spite of
environmental conditions," he said.
Generally, SAT scores rank last on a reader's
priorities to determine who should be accepted
and who should be denied, said Keith Stolzen
bach, faculty chairman of the Academic Senate's
admissions committee.
"In fact, the SAT I is not weighed in that
process as heavily as [grade point average] or SAT

II scores," he said.
Besides looking at academic details of an appli
cant's life, such as what sort of courses he or she
took in high school and how many, readers also
consider two other things independent of test
scores: "life challenges" or difficulties an appli
cant faced growing up and "personal achieve
ment," or extracurricular activities.
In some cases, scoring high marks in these cat
egories can more than outweigh a poor SAT score.
"If someone has really had low academic
ratings, then the other factors would have to be
extremely high," Stolzenbach said. "I have
looked at these people ... they all have the
highest rankings in the other categories we
looked at."
But Tran said one aspect a reader does not con
sider or even know is an applicant's race.
"In training [the readers], we stress the point,
make it very clear, that race and ethnicity cannot
be a factor," he said.
Applicants can voluntarily state their race on a
UC application, but this information is blacked
out for the readers.
Tran also said that when rejected applicants ap
peal their denial, the university admissions office
can usually explain its reasoning.
"We have always been able to provide a satis
factory answer to those questions," he said. "We

could pinpoint always exactly why (they were de
nied)."
Tran said he remembered one student who had
high SAT scores but was denied admission be
cause he only took three classes during his last se
mester in high school. .
"People think that by the time they apply they
don't have to try anymore," he said.
Typically, applications are seen by at least
three different readers, all of whom weigh a sepa
rate aspect of the application. One reader evalu
ates the overall application, one looks at grades
and test scores and a third considers personal
achievement and life challenges.
The three readers score the applications and
then decide whether or not the applicant should
be admitted.
Such an admissions procedure is in keeping
with comprehensive review, a UC-wide policy
that lends additional weight to factors other than
an applicant's test scores.
Some contend that comprehensive review sac
rifices the UC student body quality because it does
not guarantee admission to those with the highest
SAT scores.
However, Tran disagrees that UCLA's quality is
degrading because of comprehensive review.
"If you look at our average SAT score of 1333,
that is awfully high," he said.
