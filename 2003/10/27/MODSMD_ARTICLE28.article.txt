### MARYANNE GEORGE KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS 
(KRT) The lawyer who won
the University of Michigan law
school case in the U.S. Supreme
Court issued a stern warning Wednes
day to colleges nationwide: The
court's ruling is not a blank check to
use race to boost minority enrollment.
Universities must make sure their
admissions process is fair and gives
individual consideration to each ap
plicant, Maureen Mahoney said in
an interview in Ann Arbor. Ma
honey is a partner at Latham &
Watkins in Washington D.C.
The court upheld U-M's law
school admissions policy in June but
struck down the 150-point under
graduate system that awarded 20
points to underrepresented minori
ties the equivalent of a full letter
grade boost. The court found that
the policy did not consider each ap

plicant as an individual.
The decision in the law school
case reaffirmed the court's 1978 rul
ing in the Bakke case that permitted
race as a factor to further diversity.
Universities also have a responsi
bility to improve the quality of K-12
education so consideration of race
can be eliminated, Mahoney said. In
her majority opinion in the law
school case, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said that in 25 yeafs,
racial preferences should not be nec
essary to further diversity.
"The educational community has
to take steps to reduce the disparities
that make preferences necessary,"
Mahoney said. "They need to make
sure there is enough money left over
for early education initiatives. If
they only try to get their share of the
pie at the expense of these other ef
forts, they are not meeting the re
sponsibilities imposed by the court's
directives."
