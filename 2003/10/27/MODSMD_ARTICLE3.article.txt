# Panel addresses East Palo Alto relations
## 
### MELISSA CHEE 
An East Palo Alto educational panel on Friday in
vited the Stanford community to take a closer look at
the relationship between the struggling town and the
University.
The event was sponsored by East Palo Alto Tennis
and Tutoring (EPATT) and panelists included: Debo
rah Stipek, dean of the school of education; Fred Stout,
academic research and program officer; Kesha
Weekes, EPATT academic director; Melieni Talakai,
EPATT parent; and Niki Ofa and Mele Pelea, EPATT
participants.
Stout opened the discussion with a dialogue about
the rift between the communities.
"East Palo Alto and Stanford are in some ways still
two worlds apart," Stout said. "When that kind of situ
ation exists there is a real potential for distrust, misun
derstanding or fear and even hostility."
Other added tensions in East Palo Alto include the
new developments of Home Depot and IKEA along
Interstate 101 and the costly housing market.
"East Palo Alto is right now experiencing extraordi
nary demographic and developmental pressure," Stout

said. "Also, [there is] the pressure of gentrification in
the housing market that's fueled by the Silicon Valley
economy."
While many East Palo Alto residents said they are
grateful for Stanford's public service efforts, others
feel used by the school much like research guinea
pigs.
"People in East Palo Alto . . . sometimes think that
Stanford students have a condescending, even mission
ary attitude towards East Palo Alto [and] they engage
in volunteer activities because it's good for them and
their education and not for the people of EPA itself,"
Stout said. "And that they offer what one critic has
called disabling help help that is well-intentioned,
but which serves really to keep a community in a state
of dependency rather than self-direction."
As a parent, Talakai said she is thankful for the tu
toring program that five of her children participate in.
Talakai said she hopes similarities would define the re
lationships between Stanford students and East Palo
Alto students rather than the differences.
"You have the same struggles that they are
going through," Talakai said. "They don't have to
take 10 leaps just to catch up with your one just be

cause you are in a better environment because you
still had to struggle to get where you are. You
worked hard and if they work hard they can do the
same as you."
According to Stout, the idea that all Stanford stu
dents are white and rich originated in the 19405.
"This may have been the case at one time, but in
more recent years the majority of Stanford undergrad
uates many of the last couple of entering classes
have been majority minority classes," Stout said.
Stout lived on the edge of East Palo Alto in 1973
when there was little contact between Stanford and
East Palo Alto. However, he pointed out that now stu
dents can contribute their time and energy with dozens
of volunteer groups through the Haas Center.
"Empowering someone with a good education, I
think, you can transcend many circumstances," said ju
nior Katie Field, a tutor coordinator for the
Ravenswood Reads program. "It's an unbelievable op
portunity to exist outside the contained Stanford com
munity."
