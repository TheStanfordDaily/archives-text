# Technology, medicine discussed at conference
## 
### AMIT GARG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Issues in biomedicine and engineering were dis
cussed on Saturday at the fourth annual Biomedical
Computation at Stanford.
Twelve scientific talks, two keynote speakers, 42
posters and a temperature of 96 degrees Fahrenheit
made it a noteworthy conference. The keynote speak
ers were international leaders in the field. The first was
Peter Hunter, director of the Bioengineering Institute
at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, who dis
cussed how to model heart, lungs and the musculo
skeletal system. The second was Sean Eddy, the Alvin
Goldfarb Distinguished Professor of Computation Bi
ology at Washington University in Saint Louis, who dis
cussed how RNA genes are critical in regulating cells.
Among those present were members of around 40
departments and 12 different centers or institutions at
Stanford.
Topics of interest at BCATS included informatics,
data modeling and statistics, biomechanical simulation
and modeling, structural biology and genetics, biomed
ical image acquisition and processing, computer assist
ed interventions and robotics and network and comput
ing technology in education.
Talks ranged from mathematical models of sequence
alignment to automating function data of the human
genome and a 3-D simulator for the human spine.
Posters discussed how various technologies are used to
study genes, proteins, diseases and body functions.
Mike Liang, a fifth-year doctoral candidate in bio
medical informatics, summarized this view when com
menting about his work.
"My poster is entitled 'Particular Function Sites on

Proteins,'" he said. "I am trying to use structural and se
quence information on proteins to understand function.
This is crucial so we can understand how and why de
fects in proteins cause disease and to design drugs to ef
fectively treat them."
Despite its technical nature, the conference did not
have a limited audience. People with backgrounds rang
ing from computer science to medicine sat alongside
one another at TC-SEQ.
Raymond Gan, a student at Foothill College who
used to consult for IBM Global, was one newcomer to
the field of biomedical computation.
"I have been struck by how relevant all of this is," he

said. "I watch the news and hear about breast cancer,
genetic therapy and social implications, and I appreci
ate all that I am learning. I am astounded by the open
ness of knowledge that can be useful to someone with
the interest and the training. The conference is very well
organized."
Organizing BOATS was not without its challenges,
though. Brian Naughton, a third-year doctoral candi
date in biomedical informatics and one of the eight or
ganizers, said that getting donors to sponsor the event
was the hardest part.

Scientists and non-scientists alike convened at the fourth annual BCATS conference on Saturday to discuss topics
including biomedical informatics, data modeling and structural genetics.
"We lost a few companies [from
last year] and gained a few [relative
to last year], eventually breaking
even," he said. "But there are many
different departments, great inter
nal representation and the keynote
speaker rocked."
The organizers also mentioned
that this year continued the trend of
increasing student participation. As
in previous years, registration was
free for Stanford students.

Karen Lee, a senior majoring in
biology, encouraged other students
to attend future BCATS.
"Stanford is the perfect place to
have such a conference," she said.
Among Stanford's major initia
tives in this interdisciplinary field is
the $4OO million Bio-X program, the
BioSilico conference held Thursday
and Friday and the co-terminal pro
gram in biomedical informatics
started last year. The Faculty Senate
is also considering whether to intro
duce computational biology and
bioinformatics as official undergrad
uate majors within the next five
years.
