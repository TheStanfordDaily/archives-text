### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Senior Leslie Hotson, 21, died at Stanford Hospital on
Friday morning following a life-long struggle with cystic
fibrosis. Hotson was an active member in the Delta Delta
Delta sorority and an International Relations major.
Senior Kimen Field, a resident assistant in the
Tri-Delt house, lived with Hotson in Branner during
their freshmen year. According to Field, Hotson
loved to swim and was an active member of the
sorority. The Tri-Delts held a memorial service last
night for Hotson.
"We shared stories and looked at pictures," Hotson
said. "It was a really supportive mood around the house.
We were very upset when we heard of her death, but we
were also happy that we were able to spend so much time
with her when she was here."
Though Hotson finished her freshmen and sopho
more years at Stanford, she took last year off due to
health concerns. Field said that she refused to let cystic fi
brosis take over her life and that she always maintained a
positive attitude.
Hotson lived in Palo Alto and is survived by her par
ents and two brothers. Her father is a doctor at the Stan
ford Medical Center, and her brother Drew graduated
from Stanford in 2002. Family and friends are wearing
blue ribbons today to remember her and are planning
an on-campus memorial service in the second week of
November.
