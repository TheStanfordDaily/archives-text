# Getting rid of the nuts
## Most students enjoy a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a lunch on-the-go or late-night treat. But for some, this treat can be deadly. Stanford Dining has transformed Richer into a peanut-sensitive facility in response. 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
For most students, the dining hall is a harmless place where their greatest concern is
choosing turkey casserole over pizza for dinner. For those afflicted with food allergies,
however, the dining hall can be a dangerous and potentially deadly environment.

Stanford Dining is on the cutting
edge of dealing with such issues.
Ricker dining hall has been a
peanut-sensitive facility since Fall
2002. It is the first of its kind at any
university in the country. Several
schools, including Harvard and Cor
nell, have contacted Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stanford
Dining, requesting information
about starting similar programs.
The peanut-sensitive facility was
developed when one student came
to Stanford four years ago and real
ized he could not eat safely in any of
the dining halls, due to a severe
peanut allergy.
This student, who asked to re
main anonymous for privacy rea
sons, has been living with a severe
peanut allergy since age 4. As a re
sult, he has spent most of his adoles
cence avoiding cafeteria facilities to
prevent an allergic reaction. Doc
tors told him that if he consumed
any peanut products, including
peanut butter and peanut oil, he
could go into anaphylactic shock.
"I'm cautious enough that I have
never had a serious problem with my
allergy," the student says. "But if I
were to ingest just a small bit of a
peanut, I would probably stop
breathing."
Nearly three million Americans,
or 1.1 percent of the population, suf
fer from peanut allergies. Accord
ing to the student's mother, who
also wished to remain anonymous,
people have died from as little
peanut butter exposure as a speck
on a knife. She also said that it is es
timated that 125-200 people die
each year from exposure to peanut
products.
The student with peanut allergies
carries epi-pens, which reverse the
allergic reaction, with him at all
times. His family contacted the Uni
versity about his allergy prior to his
freshman year, and although the
University told him that it would
work out a suitable solution, he
quickly realized after moving into
his freshman dorm in Wilbur that
the dining hall was unsafe for his di
etary needs. As a result, he moved
into a single in Manzanita, where he
could store and prepare some of his
food in his room. By sophomore
year, he was living alone in a studio
apartment in Escondido Village.

"Granted the apartment was really nice, but socially I felt completely isolated," he
says. "Everyone living around me was a busy graduate student, and it just was not a great
place for a sophomore to live."
Siddiqui agrees that he should not have to feel isolated because of food allergies.
"We wanted to provide a space where he felt comfortable eating with other students,"
Siddiqui says.
To develop a more suitable eating environment for people suffering from such aller

gies, the student and his family worked closely with Stanford Dining to transform Rick
er dining hall, a facility that typically serves 275 students on any given day, into a peanut
sensitive dining establishment. The family covered the extra cost of making the change.
The revamped facility opened last year and has received only positive feedback since,
Siddiqui say.
According to Siddiqui, the process of eliminating peanuts from the dining hall was a
difficult and risky task. Stanford Dining hired a full time chef, Michael Dark, to go
through all of the recipes and to either eliminate or adjust the ones that contained peanut

products. In addition, employees
scrubbed down the entire dining hall
with bleach including every chair,
table and cabinet to eliminate any
traces of peanut residue. It was also
necessary to clean out Ricker's entire
inventory and completely restock it
with new products to ensure that
none of them came from facilities that
also processed peanuts.
Dining Services contacted all of
its food vendors and alerted them not
to bring in any products that might
contain peanuts. Mary Duch, the
manager at Ricker Dining, adds that it
was also important to educate em
ployees so that they read labels care
fully and handle food correctly to en
sure that there is no cross-contamina
tion.
"It would be easy for us to order
something and to have the company
bring in the wrong item which con
tains peanuts," Duch says. "The hard
est part is always watching, watching,
watching."
Another factor in developing the
program was educating students who
live in Governor's Corner and who
eat in Ricker dining hall. Duch sent e
mails to the resident fellows and resi
dent assistants who then forwarded
information about peanut allergies to
residents. In addition, several posters
throughout the dining hall alert stu
dents of its peanut sensitive status and
request that they not bring peanut
products into the dining area.
"The student population has
been very supportive," Duch says.
"No one ever complains about it, and
they are very respectful of our goals."
For those who enjoy getting their
peanut butter and jelly fix, Duch set
up a separate table with individual
packages of peanut butter. In addi
tion, the table also has disposable
plates and utensils and a separate
garbage can in order prevent cross
contamination.
"Our facility is not completely
peanut-free," Duch says. "We are try
ing to replace peanut butter with soy
nut butter, but we also realize that
peanut butter is a mainstay in college
students' lives so we have not gotten
rid of it completely."
Both Siddiqui and Duch say that
they hope that more students who
suffer from food allergies will take ad
vantage of the facility.
"One of the challenges of dealing

with food allergies in the college population is that many college-age students feel invin
cible and would rather risk their lives than request housing and dining options that would
decrease their risks," says the mother of the student with the allergy.
Siddiqui adds that food is an important part of students' lives and that they should not
have to worry about it being safe. In the ensuing years he plans to educate students be
fore they come to Stanford so that those with allergy concerns can choose to live in a
dorm near Ricker dining.
