"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the
nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the
conversation will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer
composes, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade
secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer gen-
erates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with
composition, overcomes various impediments and blocks, and
cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities share \
experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can
learn and grow - and Stanford is an 5
rich community for gaining such insights.
