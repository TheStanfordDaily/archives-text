# Prof reflects on multiracial experiences

Hazel Carby, a Yale University cultural histo
rian, delivered a lecture last night that discussed
the lack of black identity in postwar Britain.
About 50 people attended her talk, the first of
three Presidential and Endowed Lectures in the
Humanities and Arts. Titled after her current
work in progress, "Child of the Empire," Carby's
lecture confronted the "racialized discourses of
British cultural memory" through her own expe
riences.
"The black British view does not exist, or if it
does is of no account, it is easily erased, a mere
taint in the air that will not linger long," Carby
said. "Nothing could disturb the molecules of this
narrow white universe."
Drawing from her personal relocation and dis
location, she examined the racialization that sur
rounded her birth. Carby was born to a Jamaican
father and Welsh mother in Britain. During
World War 11, her mother worked as a civil ser
vant in the Air Ministry, while her father served
as a navigator and wireless operator in Bomber
Command. Her parents' war experiences intro
duced her to British history and the workings of
the Empire.
"Each, from their distinct perspective and
place, defined themselves, unequivocally, as
British and unhesitatingly loyal to whatever
Britishness meant to them," she said. "Each had
grown up, in their own part of the globe, feeling
an unquestioned sense of belonging to a British
world."
Yet Carby did not find such a natural belong
ing in British culture. In post World War II
Britain, the coupling of a black male and white fe
male challenged the social and political relations
of colonialism.
"My coming into the world ... must also have
been fraught with tension, for I was material evi
dence of sexual relations with a colonial man,"
she said.
With their marriage shunned by society,
Carby's parents could not find an apartment and
had to live separately in South London until they
saved enough money to afford a house. As a
"half-caste child," Carby found it difficult to real
ize "black Britishness" during her upbringing; in
stead, she experienced a similar outcast status.
Carby recalled that her belonging was con
stantly questioned by her peers, who would ex
press frustration and irritation when she respond
ed that she was from Britain. Ultimately, she
found that regardless of explanations, she was liv
ing in a world where some black people were
viewed as threats to the stability and unity of
Britain.
"There was no hyphenated identity that I
could wear or proclaim," she said. "When I was
asked which country I came from I braced myself
to be considered an ungrateful black immigrant,
an eternal outsider."
Although she lacked an identity in the
British culture, she concluded, "I'm sobered
by the depth and intensity of the anger that
remains me, that still shapes me as a
