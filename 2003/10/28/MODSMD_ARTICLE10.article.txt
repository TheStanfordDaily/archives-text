# Answer Girl: Is the universe dodecahedral?
## 
### 
GMy boyfriend told me today that he loves me
as much as the universe is dodecahedral. I was
too afraid to ask him if the universe is dodeca
hedral though, so now I don't know if he loves
me or not. Answer Girl, can you give me an answer?
A Good news: Your boyfriend may have cho
/\ sen an amazingly awkward and nerdy way of
/ 1 saying it, but he did, indeed, (probably)
JL mean to say that he loves you.
You see, a paper recently published in Nature pre
sented evidence that the universe may be a boundless
dodecahedral space of definite volume. In other words,
it says the universe might be this big gigantic 12-sided fig

lire with pentagonal faces, sort of (but
not exactly) like a soccer ball; that also
means there's nothing beyond the do
decahedron (that we can measure or ob
serve, at least) and that, contrary to the
most widely accepted theory, the vol
ume of the universe is measurable and
finite.
So I realize how nutty that sounds,
but the general theory that the uni
verse is dodecahedral has actually
been around for a while. It's just that now there's actual
data bolstering that idea, as collected from NASA's new
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. What's more,
the data is really insistent: Kind of like Cinderella's slip

per, it doesn't fit at all with any of the other theories, but
it fits perfectly with the dodecahedron theory no sci
entific fudging required.
Maybe that's part of what your boyfriend meant: That
you two fit perfectly together. Alternatively, I guess, he
might have been saying that you're both really awkward
around other people. Or maybe he's saying that you guys
have no life outside each other, and that you don't know
what else is out there. Hell, maybe he's saying that every
one thinks it's really weird that you guys are together, and
that no one believes you guys really get along that well.
Hehe, just kidding! Wasn't that funny?
