## Finally, a grad student center 
### 
In the next two weeks, construction
will begin on the new Graduate Stu
dent Community Center, a building
that will be invaluable for Stanford's
large graduate population. The center is a
joint venture of a cross-section of campus
groups, including the Graduate Student
Programs Board and the Office of Student
Affairs. Plans for the building have been
many years in the making, and the ball is
now finally rolling because of a generous
donation from alumnus John Arrillaga.
The student center will be used to serve
two primary services. First, it will be a
meeting place for graduate student orga
nizations. And second, it will serve as a
community center where events can be
hosted. Additionally, a cafe has been pro
posed that would increase graduate stu
dent traffic in the building. Graduate stu
dent offices and administrators will also
have a presence in this building.
We praise the University for taking
such a positive step to acknowledge Stan

ford's growing graduate student popula
tion. Graduate students have long felt a
lack of community and a lack of a
place to call home at Stanford. This
center will help solve that problem by cre
ating a space for graduate students to
gather.
The building will also make it easier for
students to interact with the University
because of the use of the building to cen
tralize the administrative functions that
graduate students need to access. Addi
tionally, the University should be com
mended for its communications with grad
uate students on these issues, both in
terms of consultation and providing infor
mation about the construction.
Because of Stanford's large graduate
population, this project should be the be
ginning of many designed to improve the
quality of graduate student life. With this
development, the University is off to a
good start, with both an excellent idea and
buy-in from graduate students.
