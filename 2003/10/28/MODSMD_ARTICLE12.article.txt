# It's time for serial groper to go
## 
### 
There aren't many reported cases of
sexual assault on campus each year.
In fact, most students consider
Stanford a safe haven protected by
a fortress of palm trees. Dorm buildings are
commonly left unlocked and windows are
left open. Young women stroll to and from
the library at late hours of the night. And,
after recent years of police records with in
nocuous crimes like bike theft, Stanford has
built a reputation for keeping its students
safe.
Therefore, it is of great concern to the
student body that a man referred to as
"the serial groper" by authorities has de
cided to choose Stanford as the location to
commit his nefarious acts. The groper rides
up behind women on his bicycle, grabs them
on the buttocks and then rides off into the
night.
For the last five months, the groper has
been at large and has threatened Stan
ford students. At least 18 women have re
ported being attacked by him. At first no
tice, perhaps, the situation sounds ludicrous
enough to merit comparison to fiction; im
ages of Washington Irving's "The Headless
Horseman" come to mind. But the groper is
real, and he poses an imminent danger to the
student body.
Last week, the Stanford Department of
Public Safety released a sketch of the serial
groper, describing him as "Hispanic with
black hair and olive skin." He is reported to
be 5-foot-9, weighing 180 pounds with a
stocky build. According to a police flyer, he

rides a mountain bike painted purple or blue
with a metallic shine.
It is the job of the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety to find the groper
and to arrest him for the crimes that he
has committed against the student body.
In the last five months, victims of the at
tacks have been waiting for justice
while the serial groper continues to
threaten others.
Stanford, in comparative terms, is not a
large campus. It is surely not as a large as a
city, the landscape most police officers are
forced to cover to find everyday criminals.
Thus, apprehending the groper should not
be a difficult task. He has been clumsy
enough to attack regularly, in public, with
witnesses around. His sketch has been re
leased. He should be caught by the police of
ficers regularly patrolling the Stanford cam
pus.
But it is not only the job of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety to bring the se
rial groper to justice. If an arrest is made, it
will be the result of a community effort. Stu
dents must be on the lookout. The released
description and sketch are detailed, and
among a community with about 6,500 under
graduate and 8,000 graduate students, some
one somewhere must have some information
about his whereabouts.
Despite the fact that no suspect has been
apprehended, the groper must be taken seri
ously. If Stanford should once again be
called a safe and peaceful place, the serial
groper must be stopped.
