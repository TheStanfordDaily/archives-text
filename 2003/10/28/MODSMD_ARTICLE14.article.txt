Campustruth ad offensive
The Daily published an ad for a
group, and in that ad it showed a
picture of a candlelight scene with
the caption "On September 11 Is
raelis mourned in Tel-Aviv." Jux
taposed to that was the image of a
bearded man carrying a gun with
the caption, "On September 11
Palestinians celebrated in
Lebanon." I don't care what cam
pustruth is, or what it represents. I
don't care what political opinions
they hold or what stance they take
on issues. I understand that they
have a right to say what they want
and when they want but why do
they have to call me inhumane?
I see a humane scene, mourning
for death, juxtaposed with a cruel
one, the celebration of death, I see
that they are saying that Palestini
ans are a cruel race. What other
point could they be making? The
ad claims that there are two sides to
every story but only one truth. Why
is their truth the fact that Palestini
ans are inhumane? It is certainly
not to foster love and respect for
the Palestinians. It is in no way con
structive. All it is saying is that the
Palestinians are cruel, all it does is
spread hate.
Today marks the first day of Ra
madan, the holiest month of the
Muslim calendar. It marks the be
ginning of a 30-day fast in which
Muslims do not eat or drink from
dawn till dusk. More than this, it is
a time for Muslims to seek spiritu
ality, refrain from bad thoughts and
just try to make the world a gener
ally better place. In the spirit of this
month, I can forgive these people
for creating the ad and wanting it
published. But why did The Daily
publish it? Did it mean to insult me
on the eve of my holiest month?
I hope its clear to everybody
that I didn't celebrate the destruc
tion of the twin towers. I hope its
clear that all the Palestinian Amer
icans didn't celebrate their destruc
tion. I hope its clear that all the
Arabs didn't celebrate their de
struction, that we are not all cruel
and that we are humane.
I know that you would never
publish an ad by white supremacy
group, especially not on Martin
Luther King Jr. day, or an ad for
neo Nazis. Something like that
would be insensitive and maybe
even racist. In my case, it is only
controversial. So what am I left
with? A Ramadan where even the
roads bite at me, "Arab Go Away."
I can't read The Daily, not if its
going to insult me and a great num
ber of people that I love. The Daily
didn't even deem it necessary to ex
plain itself. I pray that The Daily
didn't publish the ad having visited
and read the Web site it was adver
tising for.

As a freshman, I look forward
every day at lunch to picking up
your publication and finding out
about campus happenings from an
open and honest student perspec
tive. Still, I believe your decision to
print the campustruth.org ad on the
back page of your Friday newspa
per is extremely insensitive and of
fensive, not just to Arabs and Mus
lims, but to any person on campus
who hopes that racist and bigoted
stereotypes such as the ones ex
pressed in that ad can one day be
overcome.
It appears ironic to me that you
so rightly criticized the Review last
week for its insensitivity in compar
ing MEChA to the KKK, yet you
allow this filth, which is inspired by
the same sort of ignorance, to be
printed on your very own pages.
The ad provides no real informa
tion but uses tools of propaganda to
simplify a complex, many-sided
quarrel to a matter of black and
white, good versus evil. To paint an
entire race as good and another
race as totally evil is totally irre
sponsible, and this ad does not be
long in a respected, open-minded
campus newspaper such as The
Daily. Thousands of people read
your newspaper each day, and you
have a responsibility to avoid mis
leading them.

I am writing to express my con
cern and dismay about an adver
tisement published in Friday's issue
of The Daily. This advertisement
occupies one-half of the back page,
and depicts gun-wielding Palestini
an refugees in Lebanon celebrating
the tragic events of Sept. 11,2001.1
am angered that The Daily would
choose to print an image like this
and thus continue the on-going pre
sentation of Palestinians, Arabs
and Muslims as unsympathetic ter
rorists. Pictures such as the one
printed in The Daily seem to be the
only view we receive today of
Palestinian people, and it is entire
ly a one-sided view. Through those
kinds of images, Palestinians,
Arabs and Muslims continue to be
represented as unthinking evildo
ers, which legitimizes the ongoing
subjugation and repression of the
Palestinian people.
The organization campus
truth.org sponsored this advertise
ment. This group views itself as
presenting the "truth" about the
Palestinian people. It claims that of
the two sides of a story, there is
only one truth. The truth, in this
case, is that Palestinians, Arabs and
Muslims are violent and sub
human â€” they are the bad guys,
from whom the all-perfect State of
Israel is trying to defend itself. I
would assert that contrary to cam
pustruth.org's statement, there is
actually only one side of the story,

or at least, only one side of the story
that we receive in media coverage.
The Palestinians are essentially a
powerless people, living at the
whim of the powerful Israeli mili
tary and receiving little real sympa
thy and support from other nations.
Their homeland is occupied, and
Israel strictly regulates what news
of the Palestinians' condition
reaches our eyes and ears. It is not
a question of two sides to the story,
but of one narrative that the State
of Israel, not the Palestinians, con
trols and constructs. It is this story,
this dichotomy of "good vs. evil"
that colors how we view Palestini
ans, Arabs and Muslims in general.
If it weren't for outspoken, brave
individuals such as the late scholar
Edward Said and the filmmaker
Tom Hayes, producer of the Film
"People and the Land," those of us
who have not been to Palestine
would have only the perspective of
such Web sites as campustruth.org
to base our opinions upon.
It disgusts me that The Daily
would print an advertisement that
continues to legitimize the oppres
sion of the Palestinians because they
are not people, but bloodthirsty ter
rorists. As a supposedly indepen
dent media source, The Daily
should instead try and encourage us
to question the long tradition of lies,
deceit and racism that have created
many of the popular, negative views
of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.
Instead of accepting these uncriti
cal, inhumane stereotypes, we
should carefully examine how this
news is presented to us, and how
those in power control and create
this so-called "truth." It is only by
doing this can we begin to decon
struct the "good vs. evil" dichotomy
narrative that the campustruth.org
Web site presents and see the Pales
tinians as human beings entitled to
the rights of all free people.

GER change a smart move
I applaud the Faculty Senate's
decision to widen the scope of
classes that could fulfill a GER.
This is a boon to all students, fuzzy
or techie, and will allow for every
one to pursue their undergraduate
goals with more ease. The increas
ing demands (and costs) of higher
education have put more pressure
on students to fulfill certain tracks
or objectives, and the GERs were
simply in the way. The University
must realize that a liberal arts edu
cation (which the GERs empha
size) is not convenient for many
Stanford students in science, tech
nology, math or even some pre
professional programs. It is time to
put this overly idealistic, paternal
istic system to rest.
