# THE 						BOTTOM LINE
## Too much negative media? 
### 
Last week, authorities re
leased a video showing
the Columbine gunmen,
Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, using trees and bowl
ing pins for target practice just
six weeks before they shop their
classmates and took their own
lives. The video, introduced by
Katy Couric on "The Today
Show," was filmed by the gun
men and shows them laughing
and making jokes about the de
struction of their targets, imag
ining what the bullets would do
to "someone's ... brain."
Is the dissemination of often
exclusively negative images by
the media really beneficial?
While our technology-infused
society relies on the vigorous ex
change of knowledge, the neces
sity of violent information is not
always clear.
According to an article
printed last Wednesday in the
Rocky Mountain News, a Col
orado daily newspaper, the
"video was released as a part of
an ongoing effort by the sher
iff's office and a task force es
tablished by the attorney gen
eral to examine evidence as
sembled during the Columbine
investigation. The goal is to re
lease as much evidence as pos
sible to the public."
Knowing the details of the
suicidal fury that left 12 of the
gunmen's classmates and a
teacher dead on April 20, 1999 is

key for the investigation of the
incident and those similar to it.
However, showing this video
and exposing the public to these
images prolongs terror and
pours salt on wounds that have
not been able to heal in the four
years since the Columbine

shootings occurred.
The horror that
Harris and Klebold
inflicted
has been an important
force in
opening the
country's eyes to
violence in our
schools. Michael
Moore's documentary
"Bowl

ing for Columbine," a controver
sial film, furthered this effort by
asking how and why the gunmen
had access to weapons, as well as
why they resorted to such acts of
violence.
While these are important
concerns, what are the benefits
of being repeatedly bombard
ed with images of violence?
The news media rarely offers
positive news and the exces
sive use of negative coverage is
neither instructional nor con
structive.
As a result of Columbine and
other shootings, schools around
the country have instituted poli
cies of zero tolerance with re
gard to weapons and aggressive

behavior. Teachers and adminis
trators unfortunately lack suffi
cient common sense to deter
mine proportionality, fearing
the worst consequences. Clear
ly, this knee-jerk reaction to
these events has not been posi
tive.
Our national news continues
to tally up the violent deaths of
Americans in post-war Iraq. Our
local news is riddled with stories
that would give anyone night
mares. Whether the headline is
about the "Petaluma prowler"
or Stanford's mysterious groper,
the images that the media por
trays stay with us.
Perhaps viewers have been
desensitized by such violence in
the media. Gratuitous violence
in entertainment certainly does
not mitigate this problem. We
have all unknowingly become
accustomed to living in fear.
How many times have you
looked over your shoulder walk
ing through campus at night or
double checked that you locked
your door? Are we really not
safe? Or, are the images that you
saw on television and in the
newspaper today still haunting
you?
