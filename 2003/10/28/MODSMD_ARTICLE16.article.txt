# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## An environmentalist's nightmare 
### 
Frog hermaphrodites are
popping up all over the
country, and while that
might not seem like
something to worry about, espe
cially during midterms, consider
that half the fish in Britain's
lowland rivers have undergone
sex changes. Studies by English
environmental groups blame ar
tificial estrogens used in contra
ceptive pills and emitted
through sewage works for this
phenomenon.
The bluegill fish in Texas
don't seem to be bothered by
the researchers invading their
space in Denton County Creek.
In fact, nothing bothers these
Prozac-pumped fish. Re
searchers at Bavlor University
in Texas have found traces of
Prozac and other antidepressant
in the livers, muscles and brains
of these bluegills and traces in
those who don't take Prozac but
do eat fish.
What do fish statistics have to
do with you? Well, looks like
the principle I learned in fresh
man chemistry still applies: You
can't alter the environment
without a cost. By environment,
I also mean the personal bio
spheres we call our yards and
even our bodies.
This is how it works: The pes
ticides we spray on unwanted
plants, the antibiotics we take,
the shampoos, colognes and
hair-removal cremes we smooth
over our legs (or backs), the
anti-depressants and, yes, the
Viagra and the birth control
pills eventually work their way
through the land or througn
your body. Via the sewer sys
tem, shower or toilet, these
agents leave your "biosphere"

en-route to a water treatment
plant. There, your donation to
the environment co-mingles
with everyone else's chemical
cocktails awaiting treatment
and the eventual return to water
bodies and water faucets.
Water treatment plants are
effective. A quick Internet
search reveals an almost perfect

purifying rate
of between 98
and 99 percent
of toxins re
moved from
water during
the treatment
process. One or
two percent?
Doesn't seem
like it would
make a differ
ence, right?
That's

where the frogs, the fish and
even the human research illus
trate the point of how "trace" is
still unhealthy and carries im
pact. Water treatment does
strain much of the dangerous
toxins from the water, but mi
croscopic elements remain, and
build in the human body, dam
aging the immune system, caus
ing cancers, as well as impairing
fertility.
England's Guardian Newspa
per released a troubling com
parison last year between the
virility of English men and ham
sters, The Englishman, the re
port found, produce only about
a third as much sperm as a ham
ster. Average sperm counts in
men have dropped by more than
half over the past 50 years
from about 160 million per
milliliter of semen to 66 million.-
What else has radically

changed in the last 50 years?
That s right. The prevalence of
the Pill, it's not a great leap of
logic to tie estrogen in the water
supply to sad, hamster-like
sperm counts.
Obviously, this is the kind of
problem that won't have a fast
and easy cure. Maybe in antici
pation of dealing with such trou
ble, governments are being slow
to either conduct the tests or
latch on to any probable cause
as to why fish are over-medicat
ing or the male frog populations
are turning asexual because of a
herbicide called Atrazine. (The
Environmental Protection
Agency is looking into that
one.)
Governments can't exactly
outlaw the Pill or Prozac, possi
bly the two agents that keep
peace in a troubled world. Who
is going to slap down a cease and
desist order on cosmetics, de
odorant or medicines?
As it stands today, the United
Kingdom government denies
the problem, but German,
Canadian and even the U.S. Ge
ological Survey studies have
documented painkillers, anti-in
flammatories, prescription
drugs used to treat epilepsy and
blood cholesterol, antibiotics,
Prozac and drugs common in
birth-control pills in the world's
lakes and streams.
That's just something to
think about as you sip from your
Evian bottle and prepare for
your Biology exam.
