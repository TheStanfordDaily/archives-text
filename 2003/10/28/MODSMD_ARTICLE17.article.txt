# OP-ED
## Suicide jokes insensitive 
### Ellen Freytag 
I found the juxtaposition of Fri
day's front page article on antide
pressants ("Antidepressant use on
the rise at Stanford," Oct. 24) with
the Intermission section's "Edi
tor's (Suicide) Note" atro
cious. Depression is not equi
table in any way to "unhappi
ness" nor can it be reduced to
simplistic factors such as the
weather, as your antidepres
sants article comes dangerous
ly close to implying. People
with Major Depressive Disor
der have an extremely fragile
brain chemistry deficiency
that, overloaded with a signif
icant negative event in one's
life when one is already bear
ing the many stresses of being
in a place like Stanford, lends
itself to (1) feeling that every
single aspect of one's life is ex
tremely negative; (2) that this
negative state is perpetual and
irresolvable; and (3) that one
self is somehow to blame for
all of the negativity in one's
life. Far more serious than
"feeling completely alone and
helpless," a prolonged major
depressive episode can result
in acts of self-mutilation and
suicide attempts.
Cornell is the butt of every
other university's jokes be
cause we'd all like to believe that
suicide is something that happens
to other students on some other
campus, and not to us (Cornell is
infamous as the United States uni
versity with the highest suicide
rate amongst its student body).
But the fact is, while Stanford
rightfully keeps such incidents
under wraps for the privacy of the
individuals involved, I personally

know of at least three serious sui
cide attempts by three different
individuals here on the Farm in
the past three years. A much
greater number of Stanford stu
dents have practiced cutting,
burning or other forms of self-mu

tilation on a semi-regular and
sometimes even daily basis at
some point during their Stanford
career.
As someone who has made a se
rious suicide attempt, practiced
daily cutting and who continues to
struggle with Major Depressive
Disorder, I do not find headlines
like "Head in the Oven" amusing.
I do not laugh when a Daily writer

makes casual references like
"kudos to Elliot Smith" or "Dude,
not even Kurt Cobain got that." I
do not laugh as, every single day, I
have to put up with my classmates
making references like, "Oh man,
this problem set is so hard I'm
going to kill myself." Like
jokes about Cornell, the humor
of such statements depends
upon the assumption that sui
cide is something that only
happens to people other than
ourselves (in the case of this
Daily piece, distant celebri
ties).
The perpetuation of sui
cide as something to be made
fun of and as something that
only happens to others debili
tates our ability to address the
most serious consequences of
depression in our own com
munities. I hope that Daily
writers and readers will think
more carefully next time be
fore suggesting suicide mo
tives as trivial as "the break
up of the Spice Girls" or hav
ing to read Dante; and before
making statements like, "It's
enough to make me consider
throwing myself in front of the
Marguerite," or "I'd rather
die than go to Chem section
today." It is a constant flow of
remarks like these that might
truly make it harder for some
people to go on in the world. I'd
nope that in the Stanford commu
nity, we're more supportive of
each other than that.
