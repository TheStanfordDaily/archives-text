## Confessions of a soccer referee 
### 
I lead a double life. The Spencer Porter
who writes this column for you today is
not the same as the Spencer Porter
who is at the Kent Middle School soc
cer field on Saturday mornings in the fall.
On Saturday mornings in the fall, I earn
money, power and respect, all thanks to my
red and yellow cards.
The only reason I ref is to hand out these
cards. Everything else about refereeing is to
be abhorred. The pay is measly, and the
league I ref for always seems to have trou
ble paying its referees on time. The hours I
work are less than perfect; I sure don't like
getting up at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday. I miss
my cartoons! ("Men In Black: The Animat
ed Series" look into it.) But the worst
part is, when I referee a
game, all I want to do is
get a touch on the ball, or
take a shot at goal, but
then I must remember to
remain an objective ob
server, a fly on the
proverbial wall.
For those of you
Computer Science
freaks who don't under
stand the beautiful game
of soccer, let me explain. A soccer referee
has three items that help him control the
game: his whistle, yellow card and red card.
For a "normal" foul, such as tripping, push
ing or a handball, the referee merely blows
the whistle. For fouls slightly more danger
ous, such as slide tackling or spitting, the
yellow card is shown. The yellow card
serves as a warning to the player. For espe
cially heinous fouls, such as fouling a player
with the intent to injure said player or a
combination of two yellow cards, the red
card is shown. The red card is an automatic
and immediate ejection from the game. The
player is escorted off the field, and can be
suspended for a varying amount of games,
depending on the viciousness of the crime.
This is why I referee.
I want to hand out as many cards as I can.
"Hands down! I saw that No. 7, do that
again and you'll have to buy a ticket for
your next game, cause you'll be watching
from the stands! No. 4, one more word out
of you and you'll have a one-way ticket to
the locker rooms! Coach, you better back
off, or you'll be done for the day."
I take no nonsense.
I run an efficient, clean game and any
thing out of line is punishable with a card.
I watch and wait for every opportunity
to flash a card.
What's this? An attacker is going at the
goal with only the goalkeeper to beat? And
what's this, an angry defender is running
behind the attacker, knuckles lined up and
ready to punch? Oh please, please, please
knock that attacker down with a solid up
percut so I can red card you! That would
make my day! But what's this? The attack
er takes a nifty touch and slots the ball into
the back of the net.
GOOOOOOaaaaaaaalllll
Aww! Crap!
And my cards remain untouched in my
pocket, as they have for the last six years,
because I primarily referee the under-10
girls division.
Oh the humanity.
These girls show as much violence as
Don Zimmer. When they do get upset, they
get so confused that they fall on their face.
Yet even if the girls don't have the most
violent tendencies, they have taught me a
lot about life. For instance, how would I
know that a new piercing has to stay in the
ear for six months or it closes up? How
would I stay up on the ever-changing worlds
of pregame cheers and charm bracelets?
You may laugh, but the reality is that when
I am out on that field, my job isn't as much
being a referee as it is being a leader, a guide
of how to play soccer. For most of these
girls, they have never played soccer before,
and they don't really know what to do on
the field. This is why I ref, not for the cards,
but for the kids.
I know, I'm a big softie.
But here at Stanford, I'm a long way
from my Kent Middle School soccer field
and I just can't be there for them anymore.
I haven't refereed them in a couple years,
and it's just started to hit me. So do I miss
my 9-year-old girls?
Sure.
Are there times when I wish I was back
there, telling Susie that her "Lizzie
Maguire" socks just don't have enough fab
ric to hold her shinguards up?
Of course.
But do I wish I could whip out that red
card and eject them all? I don't know, I'll
let you make the call.

Spencer Porter, a junior, used the majority
of this column as his admissions essay to
Stanford, really. No, he's not kidding. This
was it... "Lizzie Maguire" reference and
all. Want to complain to Robin Mamletfor
letting him in? First tell him at
porters@stanford. edu.

ous, such as slide tackling or spitting, the
yellow card is shown. The yellow card
serves as a warning to the player. For espe
cially heinous fouls, such as fouling a player
with the intent to injure said player or a
combination of two yellow cards, the red
card is shown. The red card is an automatic
and immediate ejection from the game. The
player is escorted off the field, and can be
suspended for a varying amount of games,
depending on the viciousness of the crime.
This is why I referee.
I want to hand out as many cards as I can.
"Hands down! I saw that No. 7, do that
again and you'll have to buy a ticket for
your next game, cause you'll be watching
from the stands! No. 4, one more word out
of you and you'll have a one-way ticket to
the locker rooms! Coach, you better back
off, or you'll be done for the day."
I take no nonsense.
I run an efficient, clean game and any
thing out of line is punishable with a card.
I watch and wait for every opportunity
to flash a card.
What's this? An attacker is going at the
goal with only the goalkeeper to beat? And
what's this, an angry defender is running
behind the attacker, knuckles lined up and
ready to punch? Oh please, please, please
knock that attacker down with a solid up
percut so I can red card you! That would
make my day! But what's this? The attack
er takes a nifty touch and slots the ball into
the back of the net.
GOOOOOOaaaaaaaalllll
Aww! Crap!
And my cards remain untouched in my
pocket, as they have for the last six years,
because I primarily referee the under-10
girls division.
Oh the humanity.
These girls show as much violence as
Don Zimmer. When they do get upset, they
get so confused that they fall on their face.
Yet even if the girls don't have the most
violent tendencies, they have taught me a
lot about life. For instance, how would I
know that a new piercing has to stay in the
ear for six months or it closes up? How
would I stay up on the ever-changing worlds
of pregame cheers and charm bracelets?
You may laugh, but the reality is that when
I am out on that field, my job isn't as much
being a referee as it is being a leader, a guide
of how to play soccer. For most of these
girls, they have never played soccer before,
and they don't really know what to do on
the field. This is why I ref, not for the cards,
but for the kids.
I know, I'm a big softie.
But here at Stanford, I'm a long way
from my Kent Middle School soccer field
and I just can't be there for them anymore.
I haven't refereed them in a couple years,
and it's just started to hit me. So do I miss
my 9-year-old girls?
Sure.
Are there times when I wish I was back
there, telling Susie that her "Lizzie
Maguire" socks just don't have enough fab
ric to hold her shinguards up?
Of course.
But do I wish I could whip out that red
card and eject them all? I don't know, I'll
let you make the call.

Spencer Porter, a junior, used the majority
of this column as his admissions essay to
Stanford, really. No, he's not kidding. This
was it... "Lizzie Maguire" reference and
all. Want to complain to Robin Mamletfor
letting him in? First tell him at
porters@stanford. edu.
