# Volleyball takes down Cougars
## No. 9 Stanford emerges victorious in its fifth five-game match of the season 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Against Washington State on Friday, the
Stanford women's volleyball team fell into
early trouble, as it lost the first six points
and dropped game one 30-20. But the Car
dinal, would not allow the Cougars to de
feat it for the third time in four years in Pull
man, Wash., as Stanford came back to win
games two and three before finally taking
the win in five games.
"The loss to Washington affected us in a
positive way in the match against Washing
ton State. We didn't perform as well as we
would have liked against Washington," said
junior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani.
Entering the match, the good news for
the Cardinal (15-5, 8-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was that after facing five straight na
tionally ranked teams from Oct. 3 through
Oct. 23, and suffering three losses, it
would not be facing another one in the
Cougars.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, there
was also bad news. First, Stanford was com
ing off of two tough conference losses a
3-0 loss to No. 1 USC last Friday and a 3-1
loss to No. 10 Washington the night earlier
in Seattle.
Furthermore, the team had to make the
trek from Seattle to Pullman and face the
Cougars in a gym where it had been ex
tremely unsuccessful. From the 1991-2002
seasons the Cougars went 222-86 in Bohler
Gym and last season only one of its seven
losses came at home.
The last bit of bad news for the Cardinal
was that senior middle blocker Sara McGee
would not be able to return to the lineup
due to a foot injury that had kept her out of
the team's three previous matches.
The Cardinal struggled in game one, as it
went behind early to the Cougars. Despite
bringing the game to within three points, it
could not fight back from the early deficit,
losing the game by 10. In the game, Stan

ford was outhit by the Cougars .436-.122,
had eight less kills and had four more hit
ting errors as well.
For the rest of the match, the Cougars
fought to keep their momentum from game
one. The Cardinal, on the other hand,
began to hit its stride, making the match a
tight five-game battle. In game two, three
and four there were 33 tied scores and 18
lead changes.
The Cardinal emerged victorious in
games two and three, winning both games
by a final score of 30-24 behind a rejuvenat
ed offense that hit .364 and .361 in the
games, respectively, and had as many errors
in the two games as it had in game one
alone.
Washington State's offense, on the
other hand, could not sustain its impres
sive game one performance, as it was un
able to hit above .200 in any of the final
four games of the match. In games two,
three and four, the Cougars had 26 hitting
errors almost nine times what they
had in game one.
After winning games two and three, the
Cardinal entered game four with a 2-1 lead
in games over Washington State, but was
unable to go up by more than three points in
what proved to be the closest game of the
match. After a kill by Nnamani, who led the
match with 24 kills, the game was tied at 28,
which was the 13th tied score of the game.
Washington State, however, was able to
take the next two points, winning game four
and forcing the match into a decisive fifth
game.
Just as in the previous three games, game
five was close as the Cougars took a very
small early lead only to have the Cardinal
move in front and go up 13-8. Stanford did
not look back, winning the game and the
match on a service ace by junior defensive
specialist Leahi Hall.
In the win, four Stanford hitters had dou
ble-digit kills Nnamani (24), senior mid
dle blocker Sara Dukes (10), freshman out
side hitter Kristin Richards (15) and senior
right side Jennifer Hucke (10). The other
middle blocker, senior Jennifer Harvey, led
the team with 10 blocks.
The Cardinal will next see action at Stan
ford against Arizona and Arizona State for
matches on Thursday and Friday. Both
matches can be heard live beginning at 6:45
p.m. on KZSU 90.1 FM.

Washington State, however, was able to
take the next two points, winning game four
and forcing the match into a decisive fifth
game.
Just as in the previous three games, game
five was close as the Cougars took a very
small early lead only to have the Cardinal
move in front and go up 13-8. Stanford did
not look back, winning the game and the
match on a service ace by junior defensive
specialist Leahi Hall.
In the win, four Stanford hitters had dou
ble-digit kills Nnamani (24), senior mid
dle blocker Sara Dukes (10), freshman out
side hitter Kristin Richards (15) and senior
right side Jennifer Hucke (10). The other
middle blocker, senior Jennifer Harvey, led
the team with 10 blocks.
The Cardinal will next see action at Stan
ford against Arizona and Arizona State for
matches on Thursday and Friday. Both
matches can be heard live beginning at 6:45
p.m. on KZSU 90.1 FM.
