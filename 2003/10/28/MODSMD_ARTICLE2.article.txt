# Search for dean nears completion
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
The University's search for a new
dean of students has narrowed down to
three candidates, who will soon enter the
final round of interviews with President
John Hennessy, Provost John
Etchemendy and Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni. The new
dean will be selected by Thanksgiving,
according to Awakuni, chair of the selec
tion committee.
After a failed attempt last spring to se
lect a new dean of students to replace
Mark Wais, who left in February, the
University hired a professional search
firm in August to aid them in a new
search.
Awakuni chose an executive search
firm based in Boston called Isaacson,
Miller because of its experience in the
field of higher education and its high

level of familiarity with Stanford.
"They have identified candidates that
I would not have been able to identify be
cause [the candidates] are comfortable in
their positions and are doing well on their
respective campuses," Awakuni said.
"They would not have applied if the
search firm had not gone and contacted
them and told them what the position in
volved and the opportunity that Stanford
was offering."
The student representatives on the se
lection committee noted the visible dif
ference the consulting firm made in the
second search process.
"On a whole these candidates were of
a higher caliber than the ones we had pre
viously seen," said ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, a senior and one of
three students on the committee. "One of
the strengths of this candidate pool is that
they are more experienced and have held
higher level positions in university ad

ministration."
The consulting firm presented a
group of about 50 candidates to the se
lection committee made up of adminis
trators, students, faculty and staff. The
group was then narrowed down to
seven.
After hour-long interviews with each
of the remaining candidates, the commit
tee selected four semi-finalists, who came
for two-day visits to campus earlier this
month.
At this time, they met with various
members of the Stanford community,
including senior administrators, direc
tors of the community centers, a collec
tion of resident fellows and resident
deans, ASSU student leaders and lead
ers of student organizations ranging
from those in Greek life to cultural
groups.
Everyone who met with the candi
dates then submitted feedback to

Awakuni, who picked the three finalists
to go to the next round of interviews. If
the chosen candidate accepts the posi
tion, he or she will start working by the
start of winter quarter.
Awakuni said that he was pleased with
how quickly the University will be able to
fill the empty position.
Blake Naughton, a doctoral candi
date in education who is a member of the
selection committee, said that he spent a
great deal of time working on the com
mittee.
He said that the final decision is im
portant because he sees the dean of stu
dents as someone who must champion
student voice on campus and advocate
a positive student life experience for
both undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
"We narrowed down the candidate
pool pretty well," Naughton said, "and
all the finalists are very strong.
