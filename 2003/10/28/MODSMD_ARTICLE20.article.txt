# Conference standings to remain constant
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
For the first time all year, there were no upsets in the Pa
cific 10 Conference play.
That doesn't mean there weren't some exciting football
games, though.
No. 6 Washington State scored 20 unanswered fourth
quarter points to stun Oregon State, 36-28, while Arizona
State came up just short against UCLA, losing 20-13, and
Oregon handed Stanford its first shutout in 83 games, 35-0.
In more routine action, No. 5 Southern California rolled
past Washington, 43-23, and California had its way with a
reeling Arizona squad, 42-14.
After building a 28-16 lead, thanks in large part to a
seven-turnover day by Cougars quarterback Matt Kegel,
Oregon State (5-3,2-2 Pac-10) needed to hold on for just 15
minutes to seal a huge upset on Washington State's home

turf.
But Kegel twice found senior wideout Scott Lunde
who had spent much of the second half on the bench after
yelling at the Cougars' offensive coordinator for two late
touchdowns, as Washington State (7-1, 4-0) recovered in
time to run its record to 7-1 and remain an undefeated 4-0 in
conference.
Pac-10 rushing leader Steven Jackson managed just 91
yards on 28 carries for the Beavers, and quarterback Derek
Anderson struggled mightily, completing just 16-of-42 pass
es while being intercepted twice.
Despite his many miscues, Kegel finished 21-of-40 for
305 yards and three touchdowns. Jonathan Smith added 50
yards rushing, including a 21-yard run for his second score of
the game, sealing the victory.
Freshman Maurice Drew's 176 yards rushing led the way
for host UCLA (6-2, 4-0), including an 83-yard rush to put
the Bruins ahead for good. The Sun Devils (4-4,1-3) played

the last three quarters without quarterback Andrew Walter,
who injured his ankle. His backup, Sam Keller, completed
11-of-21 passes for just 79 yards.
Loren Wade, who rushed for 115 yards, broke off a 61-
yard touchdown, and Jesse Ainsworth followed with a field
goal to give Arizona State a 13-10 lead, moments before
Drew's go-ahead score.
Oregon's quarterback combo, Kellen Clemens and
Jason Fife, completed an amazing 23-of-27 passes and Ter
rence Whitehead rolled for 172 yards and two scores on the
ground as the Ducks (5-3,2-2) blanked the visiting Cardinal
(2-4, 0-4). Stanford got 188 yards passing from Chris Lewis
and 153 yards receiving by Mark Bradford, but just couldn't
crack the endzone, botching one seven-play sequence from
the Ducks' two-yard line.
Sophomore Matt Leinart turned in another spectacular
performance for USC, throwing for
351 yards and four touchdowns, as
the Trojans (7-1, 3-1) overpowered
host Washington, 43-23. USC's
crowded backfield combined to rush
for 239 yards, including 103 by Her
shel Dennis. The Huskies' Cody
Pickett completed 22-of-42 passes
for 274 yards, but Kenny James mus
tered just 59 yards on the ground for
Washington (4-4,2-2), which played
without leading rusher Rich Alexis.
Adimchinobe Echemandu
rushed for a career-best 201 yards
and scored three times, while J.J. Ar
rington added 92 yards and two
more touchdowns for the ground

bound Golden Bears (4-5, 2-2),
which ran for 327 yards the
team's highest total since 1992.
Quarterback Aaron Rodgers passed
for only 93 yards, not that Cal really
needed any of them.
Arizona's true freshman QB,
Kris Heavner, passed for 186 yards
and a score. Running back Mike
Bell ran for a career-best 180 yards
but most of them came after the
Wildcats (1-7, 0-4) had fallen far
behind.
This weekend's play boasts a great
marquee matchup, as No. 3 Southern
California hosts No. 6 Washington
State. Oregon pays a visit to Wash
ington in a matchup of two teams in
make-or-break positions, while Ari
zona State hosts Cal, Oregon State
welcomes Arizona to Corvallis and
UCLA comes to Stanford.
