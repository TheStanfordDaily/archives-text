# Soccer beats Ducks; defeated by Beavers
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
You can't win if you can't score. You hear all
the time that defense wins games, but really,
when it comes down to it, if the ball doesn't go
into the net, there is no chance for a victory.
That's the lesson hitting the Stanford
women's soccer team (8-7-2, 3-2-1 Pacific-10
Conference) hard this season.
Of the seven losses the Cardinal has picked up
this season, six have been shutouts.
Its two ties? Scoreless also.
The statistics essentially translate to this:
When the Cardinal can score, it wins.
This weekend was no different. Stanford eas
ily downed Oregon (8-8-0,2-3-0) by a score of 3-
1 on Friday, but fell victim to another shutout
loss on Sunday, this time to Oregon State (6-8-2,
2-2-1).
The Beavers beat the Cardinal by a score of 1-
0. It was the first Cardinal loss to OSU in the his
tory of the women's soccer program.
After Friday night's victory, Stanford's of
fense looked back on track, having scored five
goals in its last two games.
On Friday, not only did the Cardinal score
three times, but it looked good doing it. The team
spread the ball around with six players getting
shots off, five players recording shots on goal,
three players scoring goals and three players tal
lying assists.
For the second straight match, the offense
worked the way it's designed to work.

"It was important that we scored first," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "Ally [Mar
quand] scored a really impressive goal right at
the beginning of the match and it really boosted
our confidence."
In addition to boosting the Cardinal's confi
dence with her goal in the seventh minute, senior
midfielder Marquand added an assist in the 18th
minute when senior defender Natalie Spilger
headed Marquand's corner kick past Oregon
keeper Domenique Lainez.
After getting out to a quick 2-0 lead, the
Ducks were forced to press the Cardinal defense,
leading to numerous counter-attack opportuni
ties for Stanford.
In the 59th minute, the Cardinal capitalized
on one of those opportunities when senior for
ward Brittany Oliveira took a pass from sopho
more midfielder Jenny Farenbaugh and beat the
keeper to score Stanford's third and final goal.
Clearly, it has become important for the Car
dinal to score early. In games where it records a
first half score, Stanford has compiled a 5-0
record. In contrast, it has managed only one
come-from-behind win.
"When teams play Stanford and we don't
score they gain more and more confidence as the
match goes on," Ratcliffe said. "That's basically
what happened against Oregon State and they
were able to take advantage and get in a late
goal."
The Cardinal played stellar defense through-

out the weekend, holding the Ducks
and Beavers to just seven shots
apiece.
In fact, Stanford held Oregon
State to just one second period shot.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, it
was the one shot that found the back
of the net.
"It was a pretty awkward goal,
but it seems like we've had bad

breaks like that go against us all sea
son," Ratcliffe said.
Stanford seemed to have control
of the match after being able to get
off 18 shots, but it was never able to
put away the Beavers.
"I was happy with the offensive
chances that we got," Ratcliffe said.
"I think we generally
played about as well as on Friday,
but we just couldn't finish and it
gave them a chance to beat us."
It was junior midfielder Janelle
Joy who broke the tie with her goal
in the 71st minute. Joy was assisted
by sophomore forward Tessa Baker.

"Even though [Oregon] scored
on us, I was really happy with the de
fensive play all weekend," Ratcliffe
said. "The fact that we were able to
outshoot Oregon 19-7 and Oregon
18-7 says a lot.
"We finally have most of our
players back. It's really just a matter
of scoring goals, which is tough be
cause we don't have a natural goal
scorer in the offense," he added.
The Cardinal will have action at
home this weekend against No. 14
Washington (9-4-3,2-2-1) on Friday
and Washington State (5-9-1,1-3-1)
on Sunday.

"I think we generally
played about as well as on Friday,
but we just couldn't finish and it
gave them a chance to beat us."
It was junior midfielder Janelle
Joy who broke the tie with her goal
in the 71st minute. Joy was assisted
by sophomore forward Tessa Baker.

"Even though [Oregon] scored
on us, I was really happy with the de
fensive play all weekend," Ratcliffe
said. "The fact that we were able to
outshoot Oregon 19-7 and Oregon
18-7 says a lot.
"We finally have most of our
players back. It's really just a matter
of scoring goals, which is tough be
cause we don't have a natural goal
scorer in the offense," he added.
The Cardinal will have action at
home this weekend against No. 14
Washington (9-4-3,2-2-1) on Friday
and Washington State (5-9-1,1-3-1)
on Sunday.
