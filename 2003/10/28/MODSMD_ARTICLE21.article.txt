# Soccer beats Ducks; defeated by Beavers
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
You can't win if you can't score. You hear all
the time that defense wins games, but really,
when it comes down to it, if the ball doesn't go
into the net, there is no chance for a victory.
That's the lesson hitting the Stanford
women's soccer team (8-7-2, 3-2-1 Pacific-10
Conference) hard this season.
Of the seven losses the Cardinal has picked up
this season, six have been shutouts.
Its two ties? Scoreless also.
The statistics essentially translate to this:
When the Cardinal can score, it wins.
This weekend was no different. Stanford eas
ily downed Oregon (8-8-0,2-3-0) by a score of 3-
1 on Friday, but fell victim to another shutout
loss on Sunday, this time to Oregon State (6-8-2,
2-2-1).
The Beavers beat the Cardinal by a score of 1-
0. It was the first Cardinal loss to OSU in the his
tory of the women's soccer program.
After Friday night's victory, Stanford's of
fense looked back on track, having scored five
goals in its last two games.
On Friday, not only did the Cardinal score
three times, but it looked good doing it. The team
spread the ball around with six players getting
shots off, five players recording shots on goal,
three players scoring goals and three players tal
lying assists.
For the second straight match, the offense
worked the way it's designed to work.

"It was important that we scored first," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "Ally [Mar
quand] scored a really impressive goal right at
the beginning of the match and it really boosted
our confidence."
In addition to boosting the Cardinal's confi
dence with her goal in the seventh minute, senior
midfielder Marquand added an assist in the 18th
minute when senior defender Natalie Spilger
headed Marquand's corner kick past Oregon
keeper Domenique Lainez.
After getting out to a quick 2-0 lead, the
Ducks were forced to press the Cardinal defense,
leading to numerous counter-attack opportuni
ties for Stanford.
In the 59th minute, the Cardinal capitalized
on one of those opportunities when senior for
ward Brittany Oliveira took a pass from sopho
more midfielder Jenny Farenbaugh and beat the
keeper to score Stanford's third and final goal.
Clearly, it has become important for the Car
dinal to score early. In games where it records a
first half score, Stanford has compiled a 5-0
record. In contrast, it has managed only one
come-from-behind win.
"When teams play Stanford and we don't
score they gain more and more confidence as the
match goes on," Ratcliffe said. "That's basically
what happened against Oregon State and they
were able to take advantage and get in a late
goal."
The Cardinal played stellar defense through-
