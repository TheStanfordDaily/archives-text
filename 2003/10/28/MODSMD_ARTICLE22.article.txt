(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind. Students
who are caught bringing marshmallows into
Notre Dame Stadium or throwing marshmallows
or other objects will still be ejected from the stadi
um and have their ticket books confiscated by sta
dium personnel.
"There is nothing different in our enforce
ment. We are still going to be the marshmallow
sheriffs," said Cappy Gagnon, coordinator of sta
dium personnel.
Gagnon said the crackdown on the senior
tradition of throwing marshmallows during

halftime began because students were throw
ing marshmallows with rocks, coins or other
hard objects in them, in addition to throwing
other objects. Gagnon said patrons were in
jured by flying objects in the past and that
NBC lodged a complaint that its camera equip
ment might be damaged.
Stadium personnel ejected between 12 and
15 students during the Michigan State game
for either possessing or throwing marshmal
lows. Afterward, some students complained
they were unaware that there was such a stiff
penalty for marshmallows. To combat this
problem, Gagnon said an announcement
would be made during the game, probably be

fore halftime, stating that throwing objects is
prohibited.
Gagnon said that his ushers, in addition to
Notre Dame Security and Police officers, would
be looking for "ringleaders" during halftime -
students who are throwing a large amount of
marshmallows. However, he would not rule out
the possibility that a student who threw just one
marshmallow could be ejected.
"Might we get you in the roundup even if you
only threw one marshmallow? It's possible. We
are concerned about injuries," Gagnon said.
"We don't want to be the anti-fun police, it is
just getting worse and worse. Throwing stuff is
just juvenile."
