## Fires cause low air quality in Los Angeles 
### RICHARD CLOUGH DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES
University of California at Los Ange
les students seeking a breath of fresh
air outside of their dorm rooms and
apartments might want to look else
where today.
Raging wildfires in Southern Cali
fornia have pushed a dense haze over
the Los Angeles area, reducing both
air quality and visibility.
The largest of the fires, named The
Grand Prix, has ravaged the San
Bernardino area, driving residents
from their homes and resulting in sev
eral deaths. The fire is nearly a quar
ter contained, and advisories by the
San Bernardino National Forest ex
pect it to be completely contained by
noon Thursday.

Very low humidity and the Santa
Ana winds have combined to move
smoke over 30 miles from the nearest
fire to the Los Angeles vicinity.
The National Weather Service has
issued a red flag warning through this
afternoon for the Santa Ana winds
and for low humidity. The winds are
predicted to slowly subside into the
afternoon.
Although it's not at risk of direct
fire damage, the UCLA campus is
being hit especially hard by the drift
ing smoke, said Atmospheric Sci
ences Prof. Jeffrey Lew.
"Smoke's coming pretty close to
the ground," said Lew.
He added that the primary con
cern with smoke is the inhalation of
particulate matter and all unneces
sary outdoor activity should be avoid
ed.

Additionally, the South Coast Air
Quality Management District de
clared most of the regions directly af
fected by the fire including areas
of the San Bernardino Valley, River
side and Pomona as having un
healthy air quality as of Sunday.
According to the AQMD, this
means people should discontinue vig
orous outdoor exercise lasting more
than an hour. The AQMD Web site
listed basketball, running, soccer,
football and swimming laps as some
activities that should be minimized.
The site said people with heart or
lung disease should avoid the out
doors entirely.
On Sunday the air quality index in
Los Angeles reached levels that
would be unhealthy for sensitive
groups, according to the AQMD and
the UCLA Department of Atmos

pheric Sciences. But some students
said they found it difficult to avoid
going outdoors.
Clutching a tissue over his mouth
and nose, UCLA student Michael
Kek found the smoke in the air to fur
ther compound what he called his al
ready sensitive allergies.
"My eyes are watering, and [the
smoke] feels like it's harmful to my
health," Kek said.
For some students the haze was
not a significant health concern but
merely an acrid nuisance.
UCLA alumnus Steve Lobbin still
made his way to the intramural field
to play soccer, considering the smoke
no risk to his health.
"The smoke psychosomatically af
fects performance," Lobbin said.
"But no, I'm not afraid of any long
term health effects."
