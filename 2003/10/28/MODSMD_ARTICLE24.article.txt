# Rally in D.C. protests against Iraqi occupation
## 
### VANESSA MALTIN U-WIRE D.C. BUREAU 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON
In a peaceful demonstration Satur
day, tens of thousands of protestors
gathered at the Washington Monu
ment, calling for an immediate end to
the U.S. occupation of Iraq.
Organized by Act Now to Stop
War and End Racism and United for
Peace and Justice, the rally brought to
gether a diverse mix of people includ
ing veterans, military husbands and
wives, high school and college students
and families from across the country.
Stretching around the Mall, White
House and Justice Department,
fewer protesters than organizers orig
inally expected, voiced complaints
against the Bush administration, fo
cusing primarily on the human and
economic costs of the war. With
demonstrations in more than two
dozen other cities including San Fran
cisco and Paris, organizers said the

day represented the restoration of the
anti-war movement that has been
scarcely noticed since the U.S. gained
control of Baghdad.
Protestors also criticized Bush's
request for $B7 billion for rebuilding
and use of military force in Iraq, when
the money could be used to help fail
ing schools at home.
Democratic presidential candi
date A 1 Sharpton told the crowd,
"Don't give him 87 cents!"
Persian Gulf War veteran Michael
McPhearson spoke on behalf of Vet
erans for Peace. He said the Bush ad
ministration has misled the nation
throughout the war and that the dis
honesty will lead to a loss of honor.
"No weapons have been found
and more soldiers have died since the
war ended," McPhearson said.
"Where is the honor, Mr. Bush?
Bring the troops home!"
With a sign reading, "An occupa
tion should be a person's job, not a
country's suppression", Katherine

Fuchs, a senior political science and
international development major at
the University of Wisconsin, rode a
bus for 13 hours to show her disap
pointment in the Bush administration
in the nation's capitol.
"I think it is important for young
people to show the government that
they disagree with their politics,"
Fuchs said. "If politicians see that a
lot of people believe what they're
doing is wrong then maybe they'll
change."
Fuchs said she was grateful that
ANSWER provided transportation
to D.C. from around the country so
that those who might not otherwise
be able to show their support in per
son could be standing strong on the
National Mall.
With a chuckle Fuchs added that
she didn't really see anything major
coming out of the protest being that
Bush was not in Washington to see
the masses congregated practically on
his back lawn. But she said that she

was still glad she had made the trip.
Derek Fraser, a senior at the Uni
versity of Massachusetts-Amherst
said he came to Washington to make
a difference.
"I am one more person who is ag
gravated with the war," Fraser said.
"But I think that even just one person
with an opinion can make a differ
ence today."
Rallies to counteract the masses
took place around the White Flouse
as well. D.C.'s chapter of Free Re
public brought its members to show
support for the remaining troops in
Iraq. They called shame upon the
anti-war protestors and said that
peace instead of action brought the
terrorist attacks on 9/11.
"People are so worried about mak
ing a stink that they forget to stop and
remember why we are in this war,"
said Jordan Gary, a junior at Fordham
University. "It is about the freedom of
Americans and giving that same free
dom to the Iraqi people."
