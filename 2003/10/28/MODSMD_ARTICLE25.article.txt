# Unionization debate divides Brown TAs
## 
### DANA GOLDSTEIN BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) PROVIDENCE,
R.I. In the next few months, the
National Labor Relations Board
could make its long-awaited deci
sion on graduate student unioniza
tion, a decision with far-reaching
implications for Brown University.
Since 2001, when Brown appealed
the New England NLRB's ruling
that Brown graduate students could
be considered employees with the
right to unionize, unionization has
continued to be a thorny issue
among Brown's grad students.
The precedent set in 2001 by the
NLRB's ruling on New York Uni
versity's union was that teaching as
sistants, teaching fellows and gradu
ate student proctors but not re
search assistants in the physical and
life sciences could be considered
employees.
The national NLRB could
choose to uphold grad students' em
ployee status, in which case the bal
lots cast in a 2001 referendum on
grad student unionization at Brown
will be counted. But the Board could
also decide that research assistants
must be included in that definition,
which would mean a reorganization
of the pro-unionization movement.
Most disastrous for pro-unioniza
tion groups would be a decision that
grad students as a group are not em
ployees of their universities, and
thus do not have the right to union
ize.
The Brown Graduate Employee
Organization is a group of grad stu
dents who have worked since 2001
to organize a Brown graduate stu
dent union under the United Auto
Workers.
The BGEO/UAW hopes the
national NLRB upholds the exist
ing definition of a grad student em
ployee and allows the votes from

2001 to be counted, said Jonathan
Hagel, a fourth-year grad student in
the history department.
At What Cost?, a group of
Brown University graduate stu
dents who are united in opposition
to the current proposal of unioniza
tion under the UAW, conducted an
informal survey, which they said led
them to believe the vote was anti
unionization.
"Either way, it was close," said
Sheyda Jahanbani, a BGEO /
UAW spokeswoman and fourth
year grad student in history.
Members of AWC are culled
mostly from the physical and life sci
ences partly because their work as
research assistants will not make
them eligible to join the bargaining
unit of the potential union, said
Kristin Bishop, a graduate student
in ecology and evolutionary biology
and Jennifer Anderson, a sixth-year
graduate student in the geology de
partment.
But some graduate students op
pose unionization because they feel
it impedes upon their identity as stu
dents and the types of unfettered re
lationships with faculty members
and administrators this designation
allows, Anderson said. Because
most grad students are hoping to
become professors, their work as
TAs is a central component of their
education, she said.
Jahanbani and Hagel said their
critiques were not an indictment of
their own department, which they
said tended to be very understand
ing of these issues. Rather, they are
unhappy with the administration's
reception to suggestions on how to
improve the TA experience.
"[President] Ruth Simmons said
we need to talk about the place of
graduate students at this university.
We felt like that never happened,"
Jahanbani said. "What we got instead was a pretty strong anti
unionization campaign put on through the University mailing
system and by AWC. It made this a contest, not a debate."
This aggressive anti-unionization stance sends the message
that "essentially, what you do is not making a contribution," Ja
hanbani said. "I think graduate students make a difference
here. We mediate between the professors and the undergrads
and a lot of us enjoy doing our jobs."
AWC is also skeptical about the wisdom of Brown grad stu
dents organizing under a national union that mainly represents
workers in the auto industry.
"UAW politics are not ones that graduate students at
Brown, particularly AWC members, tend to support," An
derson said. "One-third of our dues would stay local, one
third would go to the national headquarters in Detroit and
one-third would go into a strike fund. The national funds
might be used in D.C. to lobby for things we don't agree with,"
such as legislation favorable to the makers of gas-guzzling
SUVs.
"Ruth Simmons has been great for the University and positive
changes have been made for grad students," Hagel said. "But we
want something more substantive and more democratic."
