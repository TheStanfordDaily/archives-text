# Bennett to retire after 30 years at Stanford
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN 
Cedric Bennett, director of Information Security
Services, will retire in January after nearly 30 years
at Stanford.
"I think he did great work with the security
group," said Chris Handley, chief information officer
of Information Security Services. "It's one of those
things that if you're going to retire, retire on a real
success."
Information Security Services is a division of In
formation Technology Systems and Services. The di
vision is responsible for overseeing the protection of
Stanford's computer network from hackers, viruses
and other computer calamities.
Bennett, who is 64, said that he felt it was simply the
right time to leave his permanent, full-time job.
"I saw my role as helping Stanford be more secure
from an information technology perspective," Bennett
said.
Handley commented on all the challenges Ben
nett overcame in his position. "Ced got us through

a very difficult transition," Handley said, referring
to Bennett's implementation of security for new
systems, such as Axess and the University finance
system, that withstood severe attacks after instal
lation.
Bennett's position will now be shared by Sandy
Senti, ITSS executive director of technology strategy
and support, and David Hoffman of Information Se
curity Services.
Senti will be managing the overall leadership as
pect of Bennett's job and Hoffman will be covering
the day-to-day activities of the job. The decision to
split Bennett's position was made to maintain conti
nuity of experience in the department, according to
Handley.
Many of the University's digital records are
required to remain confidential by law. As direc
tor of ITSS's security branch, Bennett worked
with many departments, such as the School of
Medicine and the Registrar's Office, to maintain
this confidentiality.
Information Security Services also provides infor

mation about viruses to the University community
and it scans close to 40,000 computers connected to
the Stanford network, looking for vulnerable and
compromised machines. When these computers are
found, they are disconnected from the Internet.
Bennett will be missed in the department, co
workers said.
"Everyone I lose in ITSS is a significant loss.
Every time you lose someone who's worked at
Stanford for a long period of time, it's going to
hurt," Handley said. "You lose the institutional
knowledge."
Bennett said he plans to do work on a smaller
scale in the technology field, writing articles and con
sulting, so he can continue his involvement in the
area he enjoys.
"I've retired from Stanford University, but in a
larger sense, I'm not retired at all," Bennett said. "I'm
still active in this end of the business.".
Bennett lives in Palo Alto with his wife, Billie, who
worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
prior to her retirement.
