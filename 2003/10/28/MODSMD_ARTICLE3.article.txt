# Students celebrate Dia de los Muertos

### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Surrounded by images of skeletons and photographs of
loved ones, about 20 students took part in the blessing of
the ofrenda (which means altar in Spanish) on Sunday for
the traditional Latin American holiday Dia de los Muer
tos. The students lit candles in memory and celebration of
those who have passed away.
The altar blessing marked the beginning of a week of ac
tivities sponsored by El Centro Chicano, MEChA and the
Amigos de los Muertos committee. Activities include arts
and crafts workshops and informational presentations. The
festivities will culminate on Saturday with the Fiesta de los
Muertos, featuring the San Jose ska group Firme.
"Dia de los Muertos is a time when we honor our
dead," said senior Carmen Gutierrez, a staff member at El
Centro Chicano who has played a large part in organizing
the week's events. "Traditionally, it's thought that if you
mourn them on this day it's disrespectful. You're sup
posed to receive them with joy."
The holiday, which has pre-Columbian roots, blends in
digenous American and European religious and cultural
practices.
"We celebrate this holiday at Stanford because Dia de
los Muertos helps us to cope with grief and reinforce the
belief, held by many cultures and religions worldwide, that
our physical existence is only one phase of life," said El
Centro Assistant Director Chris Clarke.
Celia Herrera Rodriguez, a visual artist and lecturer at
UC-Berkeley and Stanford, lead the creation of the ofren
da, which is currently on display in the lounge of El Centro
Chicano.
"I placed the Virgen de Guadalupe who represents
the Earth Mother surrounded by the symbols of death
as a way to acknowledge that many in our communities
continue to suffer and die of environmental illness caused
by inadequate health coverage, education about good nu
trition and access to top quality [food]," Rodriguez said.
"That is why I chose to place the Virgen surrounded by
flowers and grapes-symbols of the Farmworkers Union's
continuous efforts to better the working conditions and
health resources of California labor force in food produc

tion."
Rodriguez stressed, though, that the altar is primarily a
space for students to honor their relatives, ancestors,
friends and role models who have died. The altar is not
only decorated with pictures of these people but also with
things they enjoyed in life, such as their favorite food.
"I think traditions like this one are handed down word

of mouth," Gutierrez said. "It's something that your par
ents have to do or that you saw growing up."
"And a lot of times when we leave home we lose a lot
of things we lose our favorite meals, we have to accom
modate to whatever we have here," she continued.

Students participate in a mask-making workshop as part of the Dia de los Muertos celebrations two years ago. The
holiday is being commemorated this year through rituals, arts and crafts workshops and a festival on Saturday.
