# New Web site aids academic job searches

Surfs up job seekers.
The Bay Area Higher Education Recruitment Consortium Web site, a new
online service designed to aid Bay Area universities, colleges and community
colleges with faculty and staff recruitment and retention, was launched publicly
last week.
The project was conceived in 2000 by a group of 15 Bay Area schools, in
cluding Stanford, which was worried about getting enough applications for fac
ulty and staff positions.
Since its inception, the consortium has grown to 18 campuses, including local
UC campuses, California State University campuses and community colleges.
The Web site (http://www.bayareaherc.org) was established as a means of both
helping schools attract faculty and staff members and furthering the group's goal
to "assist the spouses and partners of our faculty and staff to secure area em
ployment," according to officials.
A recent survey of faculty found that 30 percent of spouses and partners were
having difficulty finding appropriate work in the same geographic area.
"It's a problem we all face," said Pat Jones, vice provost for faculty develop
ment and Stanford's representative in the consortium, speaking for the institu
tions in the consortium.
"All of us have bemoaned the cost of living, transportation issues and the
problems of two people trying to get a job in close proximity," said M.R.C.
Greenwood, chancellor of UC-Santa Cruz, to the San Jose Mercury News.
The Web site will also make it easier to attract women faculty. According to
Jones, "Females frequently have spouses.who would like jobs as well in acade
mia. It's a big problem and a problem that all our institutions have experienced."
The Web site has already started helping people.
Andre C. Willis, a lecturer at San Jose State University, found his new teach
ing job through the site after his wife, Patricia Rose, was recruited by UC-Santa
Cruz. The site made it easy to learn about job possibilities at other higher edu
cation institutions within driving distance of Santa Cruz, Willis said.
In addition to helping faculty, staff and spouses find positions in the Bay
Area, students will also be able to use the Web site to find job openings at Stan
ford or other local campuses.
"We obviously recognize that this will be useful as a place for our own stu

dents who might be interested in a position at Stanford or other institutions,"
Jones said. "We clearly want to publicize this to our own people."
To spread the word, the organization is sending a poster to the Career De
velopment Center and distributing flyers around campus.
Information about staff positions at Stanford had been available on the
Web for a number of years, Jones said, but information about faculty and
other academic positions is now available through the new online service.
"It's still under development," she said. "There are still things we can im
prove to make it clearer and easier to use."
The Web site had its soft launch in August and wasn't made available to
the public until last Tuesday.
Soon after the consortium was first formed, the group quickly decided to
establish a Web page that provided additional search capabilities.
Users can search for positions by region, by institution, or by area of ex
pertise: academic, administrative, executive and others.
"A lot of energy went into making it searchable," Jones said. Each of the
institutions have been paying annual membership dues of about $145,000 to
cover Web development and other expenses.
Princeton and Harvard are also considering using the software.
