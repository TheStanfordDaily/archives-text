Black holes more numerous than
thought
Many more types of galaxies might hold
black holes than previously thought. A
study published in Astrophysical Journal
Letters confirmed the tentative discovery
three years ago of a black hole in the galaxy
NGC 4395. 'Hie finding questions the fun
damental assumption that black holes only
occur in galaxies with a central bulge.
"Having a well-developed bulge is evi
dently not a necessary condition for the
formation of massive, central black hole,"
said Luis Ho, who conducted observations
in Pasadena for the Observatories of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Almost extinct bird found again
Burma has rediscovered a bird on the
verge of extinction. Gurney's pitta was last
seen in that country 90 years ago and cur-

rently only 30 exist in a
small part of southern
Thailand. The species
is listed by lUCN
the World Conserva
tion Union as criti
cally endangered, the
highest category of
concern. Dr Michael
Rands, director of
Bird Life, an organiza
tion dedicated to bird

conservation, said: "The rediscovery of
Gurney's pitta in Burma is tremendously
exciting and potentially important, but we
must not be complacent." The area where
the 10-12 pitta pairs were discovered is cur
rently threatened by forest clearance
plans. The team that made the discovery
believes there might be other individuals
living in unexplored forest.
The largest dam in the world
In the past few months, the Three
Gorges Dam in China has started to be
come operational. When completed, it will
be the biggest dam in the world, generating
the energy equivalent of 15 nuclear power
plants. It will also prevent floods of the
Yangtze River, the third largest in the
world, which have been historically devas
tating. Chinese leaders hail the dam as the
greatest engineering feat since the Great
Wall of China but the project has met stiff
criticism from all around the world. The
dam will form a reservoir more than 600
kilometers long and 200 meters wide, sub
merging the homes of 600,000 people. Con
servationists are concerned about its envi
ronmental impact and argue that damming
could worsen pollution since pollutants will
not wash to sea. The project has consumed
over $25 billion, far in excess of the original
$lO billion predicted in 1993.
How babies learn to speak
Babies may learn to speak in the same
ways as birds learn to sing, according to a re
cent study. Birds learn to sing primarily
through social interaction. The study, pub
lished in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, found a similar pat
tern in humans. The study had two groups
of mothers one that reacted to what ba
bies vocalized and another that did not. The
babies that had a two-way conversation
with adults developed speech faster than
those who simply imitated the noises they
made. The authors claim that providing in
fants with feedback is the best way to ensure
they learn to speak correctly.
Dangers of hormone replacement
therapy
Hormone replacement therapy may
cause memory loss and dementia. A study
published in the Journal of American
Medical Association investigated women
taking estrogen or estrogen plus progestin.
The study found that women taking hor
mone supplements had a greater risk of
mental problems. "For women age 65 and
over, the balance is now so far tipped in the
direction of harm for going on estrogen
plus progestin that it's pretty difficult to
justify starting any woman in her 60s on
these hormones, no matter how much you
worry about her bones," said Marcia Ste
fanick, one of the co-authors and professor
of medicine at Stanford.
Assessing climate change by sea level
Scottish scientists are studying the ef
fects of rising sea levels on estuaries. The
scientists are going to five different loca
tions in Europe the Fife in Scotland, the
Westerschelde in the Netherlands, the Wa
terford in Ireland, the Tagus in Portugal
and the Sylt in Germany. The main purpose
is to assess global climate change using the
same metric. The project will last for three
years and the group hopes to develop pre
ventive measures for entire Europe.
