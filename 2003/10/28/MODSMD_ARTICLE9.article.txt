# Time for Change
## Falling back an hour leads to a plethora of time-warp problems 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
Just when students start getting into the swing of their schedules and
adjust to the pace of college life, the fall time change strikes. This phe
nomenon has the capacity to throw life asunder as internal clocks are
recalibrated in accordance with the time change.
Daylight-saving time begins at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday in April and
ends at 2 a.m. on the last Sunday of October with the return of "stan
dard time." But not all states observe daylight-saving time. Hawaii, Ari
zona and Indiana do not participate in the joy of "springing forward and
falling back," as many remember the ritual of setting clocks an hour for
ward in the spring and an hour back in the fall.
Freshman Shayak Baneijee is from India, so he is unfamiliar with
daylight-saving time. "I just found out about two days ago," he says.
"We don't have it where I am from, so I think it's pretty silly."
The moniker is a misnomer, however. Daylight-saving time does not
"save" time at all. This process merely shifts time up an hour in the
spring to include more daylight time in the evening. As a result, in the
summer, the sky is lighter later. In some countries, daylight-saving is re
ferred to as the "summertime period."
For example, in 1996 the European Union standardized an EU-wide
"summertime period." The EU version of daylight-saving time runs
from the last Sunday in March through the last Sunday in October.
Daylight-saving time is said to have originated as one of Benjamin
Franklin's innovative ideas to increase efficiency in France. He claimed
Parisians would not have to buy as many candles to light their homes in
the night if they would wake up with the sun in the summer. In his let
ter to a French journal, he asserted that citizens would save thousands
of francs per year.
But some people believe that daylight-saving time was instituted at
the demand of farmers.
Freshman Eric Phetteplace says, "I think it's stupid. It's an anti
quated policy that dates back to agricultural times. We don't need it any
more."
But his assertion is not necessarily true. Although daylight-saving
theoretically does give farmers more time in the sun to plant crops and
tend to their land, most countries started daylight-saving policies to
conserve energy. In fact, farmers are one of the groups to suffer conse
quences of daylight-saving since animals have difficulty adjusting to the
change.
Although daylight-saving time allows for the long evenings we take
for granted in the summer, some still complain about the mechanical
task of resetting clocks. After all, who enjoys having to change their
clocks? Luckily, most people's computers automatically change the
time, decreasing the inconvenience factor in that case, but alarm clocks,
wristwatches and car timekeepers are a hassle, students say.
"I woke up and thought I was going to make it to I-Hum early for
once," an anonymous freshman from Indiana said. "I had never heard
of daylight-saving time and ended up missing lecture. It was so embar
rassing and now everyone won't stop making fun of me for it!"
Sleep schedules can also be adversely affected. Though the "fall
back" may be nice because of its extra hour of sleep, the "spring for
ward" mechanism has negative consequences. Every year, the day after
daylight-saving time starts, there are significantly more traffic accidents
when people have an hour less sleep and every fall there are signifi
cantly fewer traffic accidents when people have an extra hour of sleep,
according to recent studies.
On the other hand, there are many reasons for people to support
daylight-saving time. Sophomore Matthew Grubb says, "I like it. The
sun helps me wake up in the morning."
For the environmentally conscious, daylight-saving time allows peo
ple to use natural light for longer periods of time during the day.
Studies also show that daylight-saving time reduces crime and traf
fic accidents because people return from work in the light and people
are more easily monitored when it is not dark outside.
Daylight-saving time has not had such a straightforward history in
the United States, however. In 1918, the policy began to help save en
ergy during World War I. It was repealed the following year because it
was unfavorably received.
In 1942, "war time" was instituted during World War 11. Many states
followed suit even after the yearlong shift ended, but it wasn't until 1966
when Congress created the Uniform Time Act that national patterns
were established. The push came from the transportation industry,
which demanded changes be made so that there was consistency across
time zones.
During the oil embargo of 1973 by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries Congress decided to enact year-round daylight
saving time. But by 1975, amid complaints that children were endan
gered walking to school in dark winter mornings, the United States re
turned to summer daylight-savings time.
Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation oversees time
changes.
