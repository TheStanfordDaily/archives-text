A Message from the Changs
Dear Friends:
Chloe very much needs your help. We thought she was responding well to her chemotherapy until last week when
we learned that she had relapsed. Her leukemia had returned. She will have to have a bone marrow transplant
sometime in the next several months and it is critical that we find a donor match for her. Because she is biracial, this
is a difficult challenge. The national registry does not have many biracial, or even Asian, potential donors. You may
hold Chloe's future within you. Please help her. A simple blood test can determine whether you might be a match.
Thank you.
