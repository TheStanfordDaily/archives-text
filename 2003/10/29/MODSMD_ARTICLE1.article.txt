# Dorms restrict publication distribution

### JESSICA HANLEY 
Some Stanford residences are reconsidering
their policies for how publications are distrib
uted, after The Stanford Review printed a con
troversial editorial comparing Chicano / Latino
student organization MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan.
In recent weeks, staff members at Castano
House and Roble Hall decided to prohibit stu
dent groups such as The Review, The Stanford
Chaparral and The Stanford Progressive from
slipping publications under residents' doors.
Those groups must now leave publications at
dorms' main entrances.
Other houses, such as Toyon Hall, are also re
considering their policies.
"I very much suspect that the door-to-door
distribution question has resurfaced as a result
of controversy over The Review's MEChA arti
cle," said junior Piotr Kosicki, ASSU publica
tions director. "However, the fates of Stanford
student publications are intertwined, and the
issue that arises is one of tremendous import for
all Stanford student publications."
The Roble staff declined to comment exten
sively on the reasons behind the change, but
Resident Assistant Katie Buchanan said, "Our
policy was not adopted solely on the basis of the
MEChA editorial."
Buchanan said the new system will operate
much like the ASSU's News Readership pro
gram, by allowing interested residents to pick up
the publications they wish to read.
While the policy will change the way Roble
and Castano residents get their publications, it is
not a new concept. According to a Residential
Education policy, publications cannot be placed
at students' doors unless specifically permitted
by the residential staff.
"Officially speaking, it's already prohibited,"
explained Kosicki, who is looking into convinc
ing Res Ed to change its policy.
"Student publications really have no better
way of reaching the Stanford student popula
tion," he said. "Fundamentally, Stanford stu
dents are lazy. They are much more likely to
look at a publication if it is under their door."
Some publications expressed disappointment
at the decision.
"We have found distribution to be one of the
most rewarding parts of producing the Chapar
ral," said senior lan Spiro, co-editor of the Stan
ford Chaparral. "It is a way for us to deliver the
magazine, but also gives us the chance to just get
out there and chat with our fellow students."
While The Chaparral plans to obey the poli
cy, The Progressive does not. The Review was
not available for comment.
"I would encourage my Progressive succes
sors and [The Stanford Review] and such to vio
late it flagrantly," said Josh Benson, former
president of The Progressive.
Senior Michael Zakaras, chief editor of The
Progressive, also expressed disagreement with
the policy.
"I don't think there is any question that this
policy will negatively affect the
readership of The Progressive,"
he said. "Distributing door to
door is the only way to guarantee
that all the students at Stanford
have a chance to read our paper."
Zakaras believes that the possi
bility of offending students is no
reason to stop door-to-door distri
bution.
"The few people who have
been offended by a campus publi
cation shouldn't dictate dorm or
campus policy," he said. "Many
more students will suffer from not
getting publications delivered to
them than the few students who
will have to throw the papers
away. In the end, unless the Uni
versity can come up with a way to
ensure the kind of wide readership
that door-to-door distribution al
lows while at the same time pro
tect the sensitive students from
being offended, then we'll contin
ue to distribute."
Buchanan said the intent of
Roble's staff is not to decrease
readership.
"We as a staff pledge to en
courage residents to read Stan
ford publications and will adver
tise new arrivals on whiteboards
and in hall meetings," Buchanan
said.
