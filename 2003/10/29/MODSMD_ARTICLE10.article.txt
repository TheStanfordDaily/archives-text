A new study by UC-Berkeley on SAT scores turned up some surprising results: There is little correlation
between standardized test scores and success in college. The results of this study are forcing colleges around
the country to re-examine their admissions policies, with an eye on standardized tests.

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES A report released on
Friday addressed a previous study that sparked contro
versy over University of California at Berkeley's admis
sions policies. Focusing on the importance of comprehen
sive admissions review, the new study indicates that
Berkeley students with low SAT scores are generally suc
cessful in school.
The University of California Coalition Report was pub
lished in response to a report commissioned by UC Regent
John Moores. The Coalition Report, titled "Facts and Fan
tasies about UC-Berkeley Admissions: A Critical Evalua
tion of Regent John Moores's Report," listed a number of
signatures of supporters including the UC Student As
sociation, the UC's chief student lobbying organization.
"It's a good report and [it is] good that it came out when
it did," said Matt Kaczmarek, the chairman of University of
California Student Association. "It is an important oppor
tunity to articulate why comprehensive review is so impor
tant instead of simply looking at SAT scores."
The authors of the report approached the student asso
ciation for its support because they had heard about the as
sociation's work in advocating comprehensive review.
Comprehensive review is a UC-wide admissions policy
that gives additional weight to factors other than appli
cants' test scores and grades.
Berkeley professors and other student organizations
were also among the signers of the report.
According to the Moores report, 374 students accepted
to Berkeley had received scores below 1000 on their SAT
I, while 3,218 applicants with scores over 1400 were denied.
Moores suggests that the selection process at Berkeley was
not objective.
Another signer of the Coalition Report was the Nation
al Center for Fair and Open Testing. Bob Schaeffer, the di
rector of public education and member of Fair Test, said he
was pleased with the report and the amount of support it
drew.
"We were pleasantly surprised and gratified by the
number and breadth of signers," he said. "We welcome the
support of [the student association] or any other campus
student organizations."
One of the primary drafters of the Coalition Report was
William Kidder, a member of the Equal Justice Society.
The report "found low-scoring students who have gone
to UC-Berkeley and other elite universities and have done
very well," negating Moores' claim that students with lower
scores did not belong in prestigious universities such as
Berkeley, Kidder said.
"We concluded that Regent Moores' comment had no
foundation," he added.
Kaczmarek emphasized the report's role in informing
the public.
"It's important to see the holistic view of the data in
stead of the one-sided view presented by Moores," Kacz
marek said, noting that the SAT is only one determining
factor "in the comprehensive review process" and does not
necessarily predetermine future success.
