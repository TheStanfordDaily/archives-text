# Boy answers your Halloween questions

QDude, I'm a freshman who fondly remembers
the Halloween dress-up days at my high
school. This year I have a great costume: My
friend and I are going as the Olsen twins, in
honor of their eighteenth birthdays. We're going all-out,
donning blonde wigs and even paying one of our sketchy
math TAs to wear a leather jacket and follow us around
"Uncle Jesse" (hubba hubba). Where's the prime place at
Stanford to show off our costumes on Halloween?
A You can start by showing up to class in full
Halloween regalia. While dressing up for class
/ I is typically the realm of prank-prone frat
-X. pledges. Halloween will give you license to
wow your profs with your waifish jail-bait outfit. Trust me,

faculty members will be grateful for the comic relief.
"I wish I could tell you I was going to a great party
dressed as Elizabeth I," says English Prof. Joyce Moser

on her holiday plans, "but what I'm
doing is buying immense amounts of
candy. On an average Halloween night,
at least 80 kids show up."
Political Science Prof. Morris Fiori
na had no qualms about avoiding all
things Halloween, even the candy dis
tribution.
"At this point in the term all I can do
on Friday nights is to go wine-tasting
then stagger off to dinner," he says. "Stu
dents, I feel, can empathize with that."

Unfortunately, opportunities to show off your goods
in a non-academic setting on the Stanford campus have
dwindled. You can't even blasphemously dance over the

graves of the school's founders at the (formerly) annual
Mausoleum Party, which lost funding from the Stanford
Alumni Association last year.
On campus, you can get sketchy and drop by the grad
student Halloween party... which is on Nov. 1. Or you
could go to the symphony orchestra's Halloween concert
and listen to "spooky tunes to woo the spirits."
Come on. Don't laugh. You can at least pretend those
are good ideas.
You can, however, join the snowballing tradition of
getting wasted and going to San Francisco's Castro Dis
trict. Last year safety was at a premium, with only five
stabbings, and police caught just a single lunatic mean
dering through the crowd with an actual chainsaw.
And that's no joke.

If you've got something fun to do on Halloween or are one
of the Olsen twins, e-mail me at barretts@stanford.edu.
