# The 						Stanford Daily Editorials
## Publications policy must be edited 
### 
The experience is not uncommon:
You return home from a night of
studying at the library to discover
a student publication at your
doorstep. Perhaps it is unwanted. Perhaps
not. Regardless, you flip through the pages
to catch the latest gags in the Chaparral, the
humor magazine, or for prize-worthy
poems in The Mind's Eye, the literary jour
nal. For student publications such as these
and others like The Stanford Review
and Stanford Undergraduate Research
Journalâ€” door-to-door distribution is a
way of life. Newspaper racks that carry The
New York Times and the San Jose Mercury
News couldn't hold the dozens of student
publications that are printed for the Stan
ford community.
Until about two weeks ago, publica
tions were distributed to dorms without
any reported hitches. Students who chose
not to read the publication simply threw
their copies out. The act was no harder
than discarding junk snail mail or deleting
spam e-mails.
But now, Roble and Castano Halls will
begin enforcing a publication distribution
policy that bans student groups from
putting publications under students' doors.
Instead, all publications must be placed in a
stack at the dorm's entryway.
According to Jane Camarillo, director of
Residential Education, the policy is not
new. Although it hasn't been enforced until
now, Residential Education has had a blan
ket policy about no "door-to-door solicita

tion" for the last two years that has banned
publications from being delivered to stu
dents' doors. Exceptions are made, said Ca
marillo, when a dorm's resident fellow
posts a policy allowing door-to-door distri
bution.
Piotr Kosicki, director of the Publica
tions Board of the ASSU, said that Roble
and Castano's policy changes might lead to
the enforcement of no-distribution policies
in other dorms. This would cause great
problems for campus publications, which
would see their readership decline.
We strongly oppose the no-distribution
policy adopted by Residential Education
and its recent enforcement by Roble and
Castano. We understand that the decision
comes on the heels of some strong debates
over the content of a recent article by The
Stanford Review comparing MEChA to
the KKK. However, restricting the distribu
tion of all publications isn't going to stop
student voices from being heard.
Despite the fact that students may some
times be offended by the content published
by their fellow students, all publications
should not be banished to a small corner of
a dormitory or house. Students have the op
tion to throw these publications away no
one is forcing anyone to read them.
Allowing student publications to be dis
tributed door-to-door fosters student voice
on campus. We hope that Residential Edu
cation will reconsider this policy because it
hurts student publications and restricts
freedom of speech.
