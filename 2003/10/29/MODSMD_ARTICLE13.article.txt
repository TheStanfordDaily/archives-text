# Bone marrow drive could save life
## 
### 
Chloe Chang is the 21-month-old
daughter of Stanford History Prof.
Gordon Chang and his wife, Vicki
Sandin. Dressed in a pink "Stan
ford Cutie" dress, she has been known to skip
around the Main Quad with her parents, who
are resident fellows in Castano.
But Chloe does not lead an ordinary life.
The young girl was diagnosed with leukemia
last May. Since then, the road to recovery has
been long and painful, with regular visits to
Stanford hospital. But Chloe cannot lead a
healthy life until she receives a bone marrow
transplant. If a match isn't found, she could
die.
The Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity, Cas
tano residents, the History department and
student volunteers have organized a bone
marrow donor match drive for Chloe, whose
cancer came out of remission in September.
Because the chances of finding a match are
slim one in a million according to the Na
tional Marrow Donor Program organizers

hope to attract large crowds for the event.
The goal is a turnout of 500 people, but we
urge members of the Stanford community to
help organizers surpass that goal.
The marrow-typing process is free and
takes only 15 minutes. All it involves is a
prick, so that a blood sample can be collect
ed and sent to a lab for analysis. If a match is
found, there is no obligation to donate mar
row, but there is information available to
help in the decision-making process. And all
potential donors, even those who don't
match Chloe's type, will be entered in the
national registry so they can be contacted in
the future if the marrow is needed for anoth
er ill patient. A few minutes is a small price
to pay to help others live a full and healthy
life.
Students, faculty, staff and area residents
are all asked to come to White Plaza Thurs
day and Friday between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to
donate just a few drops of blood. It's worth
your time. It might save a life.
