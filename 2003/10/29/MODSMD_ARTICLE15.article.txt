Editors should have known bet
ter than to joke about suicide

I was shocked to find that The
Stanford Daily's editors would
allow such a non-humorous joke
("Editor's (Suicide) Note," Oct.
24) to be published in the Intermis
sion Section. The article makes me
question the professionalism and
sensitivity of The Daily.
According to Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, the director of the Coun
seling and Psychological Services at
Vaden Health Center, the number
of students using its services has
been increasing in the past decade.
This is an alarming situation that
University officials should be
aware of. The Intermission article
reflects the stereotypes and stigmas
that people have on psychiatric dis
orders. They carry such a taboo
that no one should mention any
thing about it on campus.
Students should view depression
and other psychiatric conditions se
riously. Depressed patients should
not be viewed as failures because
depression is tied to genetics, neu
robiology and social environment.
Using anti-depressants will only al
leviate the problem temporarily.
Research has shown that being in a
supportive network plays a vital
role in improving the quality of liv
ing of depressed patients. Many
times, students on campus fear to
discuss their psychological prob
lems with others because of the
negative reactions they experience
from their peers. This will only ex
acerbate their health conditions.
CAPS has had a limited role in
preventing and educating students
about ways to deal with depression
and other psychological problems.
The 10-session limit for students
needs to be reviewed. Continuity of
service is essential for students ex
periencing psychological problems.
Think about this, who would have
the interest to repeat their entire
story to a new psychologist after 10
sessions? I have known students
who feel frustrated by CAPS and
decide not to seek help at all. Previ
ous research also shows that the
lack of communication between
one's psychologist and psychiatrist
lowers the treatment outcomes. It
is not uncommon that psychiatrists
at CAPS only have less than 15
minutes to speak with patients be
fore they write a new or refill a pre
scription order.
The prevalence of anti-depres
sant prescriptions warrants atten
tion. Anti-depressants are usually
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tri
cyclics and monoamine oxidase in
hibitors. Patients usually experi
ence some adverse drug effects in
cluding insomnia, dry mouth and
drowsiness. Using prescriptions as
means to push students away from
CAPS would only lead to the re
lapse of depression in the future.
In short, The Daily's editors
should be more sensitive to contro-

versial issues in its coverage. On
the other hand, I urge the universi
ty to take students' mental health
conditions seriously and grant a
larger budget to CAPS in each fis
cal year to ensure that students
have adequate channels to seek
help if needed.

MEChA statements removed
from Web site
Until The Review article, Stan
ford MEChA had racist and sepa
ratist statements on their Web site,
statements which the site had said
were "fundamental" and "founda
tional" (verifiable by Google
cache). Now those statements have
been removed and refuted. Let's all
take a calmer, grateful breath.

Controversy over campustruth
ad unnecessary
I find the vitriol expressed by
some people in response to The
Daily's publishing the ad by cam
pustruth.org to be somewhat puz
zling. After all, the images captured
the reaction that did indeed occur.
Is it an across-the-board condemna
tion of all Palestinians? Hardly. But
to deny the fact that the majority of
Palestinian population, at least in
the Middle East, was happy because
of the event of Sept. 11 is to deny a
fact, albeit an unpleasant one. How
ever, to claim that something is
"racist" or "hateful" just because it
exposes an unpleasant truth is disin
genuous. Despite Mr. A 1 Misnad's
declaration ("Letters to the Edi
tor," Oct. 28) that "All the Arabs
didn't celebrate [Twin Tower's] de
struction," a poll taken shortly after
9/11 showed that the majority of
Middle Eastern Arab population
were either happy about the World
Trade Center destruction or
thought that it was the work of
who else, the Jews. Pretending that
these truths don't exist doesn't do
anybody any good. Before we can
solve the problem of violent and au
tocratic Middle East, we must first
stop pretending that it doesn't exist.

Ad can't claim one truth
As a Jew who believes in the
right of Israel to exist, I applaud the
letters of Nasser Khan and Abdul
lah A 1 Misnad in regards to the
campustruth.org advertisements
("Letters to the Editor," Oct. 27
and 28, respectively). It is pre
sumptuous and completely false,
particularly in the case of a conflict
as historic, deep and complicated
as this one, to assert that there is

one truth. I hope people realize
that supporting Israel does not
mean condoning the message of
these advertisements, or other at
tempts of those with the money to
do so to foist onto Daily readers
their simplistic and propagandistic
messages. I favor the approaches
that focus attention on the common
humanity of both Israelis and
Palestinians, and also recognize
that both peoples' faults contribute
to the perpetuation of this conflict.
I am equally prepared to denounce
inhumane Israeli policies and atti
tudes as I am suicide bombers and
their sympathizers.
There is rarely, if ever, one
truth. Only the great force beyond
ourselves, not campustruth.org or
any other earthly organization,
could purport to know it.

Negative portrayal of Office of
Fresnmen and Transfer Students
unfounded
I was dismayed by your negative
portrayal of the work of the Office
of Freshmen and Transfer Students
in last Wednesday's editorial ("Stu
dent Affairs must reform," Oct.
22). In it, you asserted, "It is time
the office showed some positive re
sults," when in fact, prior issues of
The Daily have lauded the efforts
of this office, including citing the
ways in which New Student Orien
tation has been enhanced in the
year we have been at it. In addition
to The Daily articles, the feedback
we regularly receive from new stu
dents, residence staff members and
parents makes clear this office is
having a positive impact on the
quality of student life on campus.
Of course, much of our work takes
place behind the scenes helping
students with their transition into
Stanford, which may not be some
thing The Daily or the general stu
dent body for that matter is aware
of. The class spirit initiatives you
singled out as "The only new con
cepts brought about by this office,"
are therefore hardly the only new
things we are doing. Indeed, they
are just a small yet meaningful
component of what we are all
about.
Furthermore, your assertion
that this office was an expensive
initiative is simply inaccurate. In
deed, the $50,000 in funds that the
ASSU received just for social pro
gramming far exceeds the total dol
lars this office has at its disposal.
We are very excited about the
ASSU's Absolute Fun initiative,
and Nadiya Figueroa and Joey Na
toli know we will support them in
whatever manner we are able.

Using anti-depressants will only al
leviate the problem temporarily.
Research has shown that being in a
supportive network plays a vital
role in improving the quality of liv
ing of depressed patients. Many
times, students on campus fear to
discuss their psychological prob
lems with others because of the
negative reactions they experience
from their peers. This will only ex
acerbate their health conditions.
CAPS has had a limited role in
preventing and educating students
about ways to deal with depression
and other psychological problems.
The 10-session limit for students
needs to be reviewed. Continuity of
service is essential for students ex
periencing psychological problems.
Think about this, who would have
the interest to repeat their entire
story to a new psychologist after 10
sessions? I have known students
who feel frustrated by CAPS and
decide not to seek help at all. Previ
ous research also shows that the
lack of communication between
one's psychologist and psychiatrist
lowers the treatment outcomes. It
is not uncommon that psychiatrists
at CAPS only have less than 15
minutes to speak with patients be
fore they write a new or refill a pre
scription order.
The prevalence of anti-depres
sant prescriptions warrants atten
tion. Anti-depressants are usually
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tri
cyclics and monoamine oxidase in
hibitors. Patients usually experi
ence some adverse drug effects in
cluding insomnia, dry mouth and
drowsiness. Using prescriptions as
means to push students away from
CAPS would only lead to the re
lapse of depression in the future.
In short, The Daily's editors
should be more sensitive to contro-

versial issues in its coverage. On
the other hand, I urge the universi
ty to take students' mental health
conditions seriously and grant a
larger budget to CAPS in each fis
cal year to ensure that students
have adequate channels to seek
help if needed.

MEChA statements removed
from Web site
Until The Review article, Stan
ford MEChA had racist and sepa
ratist statements on their Web site,
statements which the site had said
were "fundamental" and "founda
tional" (verifiable by Google

been removed and refuted. Let's all
take a calmer, grateful breath.

Controversy over campustruth
ad unnecessary
I find the vitriol expressed by
some people in response to The
Daily's publishing the ad by cam
pustruth.org to be somewhat puz
zling. After all, the images captured
the reaction that did indeed occur.
Is it an across-the-board condemna
tion of all Palestinians? Hardly. But
to deny the fact that the majority of
Palestinian population, at least in
the Middle East, was happy because
of the event of Sept. 11 is to deny a
fact, albeit an unpleasant one. How
ever, to claim that something is
"racist" or "hateful" just because it
exposes an unpleasant truth is disin
genuous. Despite Mr. A 1 Misnad's
declaration ("Letters to the Edi
tor," Oct. 28) that "All the Arabs
didn't celebrate [Twin Tower's] de
struction," a poll taken shortly after
9/11 showed that the majority of
Middle Eastern Arab population
were either happy about the World
Trade Center destruction or
thought that it was the work of
who else, the Jews. Pretending that
these truths don't exist doesn't do
anybody any good. Before we can
solve the problem of violent and au
tocratic Middle East, we must first
stop pretending that it doesn't exist.

Ad can't claim one truth
As a Jew who believes in the
right of Israel to exist, I applaud the
letters of Nasser Khan and Abdul
lah A 1 Misnad in regards to the
campustruth.org advertisements
("Letters to the Editor," Oct. 27
and 28, respectively). It is pre
sumptuous and completely false,
particularly in the case of a conflict
as historic, deep and complicated
as this one, to assert that there is

one truth. I hope people realize
that supporting Israel does not
mean condoning the message of
these advertisements, or other at
tempts of those with the money to
do so to foist onto Daily readers
their simplistic and propagandistic
messages. I favor the approaches
that focus attention on the common
humanity of both Israelis and
Palestinians, and also recognize
that both peoples' faults contribute
to the perpetuation of this conflict.
I am equally prepared to denounce
inhumane Israeli policies and atti
tudes as I am suicide bombers and
their sympathizers.
There is rarely, if ever, one
truth. Only the great force beyond
ourselves, not campustruth.org or
any other earthly organization,
could purport to know it.

Negative portrayal of Office of
Fresnmen and Transfer Students
unfounded
I was dismayed by your negative
portrayal of the work of the Office
of Freshmen and Transfer Students
in last Wednesday's editorial ("Stu
dent Affairs must reform," Oct.
22). In it, you asserted, "It is time
the office showed some positive re
sults," when in fact, prior issues of
The Daily have lauded the efforts
of this office, including citing the
ways in which New Student Orien
tation has been enhanced in the
year we have been at it. In addition
to The Daily articles, the feedback
we regularly receive from new stu
dents, residence staff members and
parents makes clear this office is
having a positive impact on the
quality of student life on campus.
Of course, much of our work takes
place behind the scenes helping
students with their transition into
Stanford, which may not be some
thing The Daily or the general stu
dent body for that matter is aware
of. The class spirit initiatives you
singled out as "The only new con
cepts brought about by this office,"
are therefore hardly the only new
things we are doing. Indeed, they
are just a small yet meaningful
component of what we are all
about.
Furthermore, your assertion
that this office was an expensive
initiative is simply inaccurate. In
deed, the $50,000 in funds that the
ASSU received just for social pro
gramming far exceeds the total dol
lars this office has at its disposal.
We are very excited about the
ASSU's Absolute Fun initiative,
and Nadiya Figueroa and Joey Na
toli know we will support them in
whatever manner we are able.

Editors should have known bet
ter than to joke about suicide

I was shocked to find that The
Stanford Daily's editors would
allow such a non-humorous joke
("Editor's (Suicide) Note," Oct.
24) to be published in the Intermis
sion Section. The article makes me
question the professionalism and
sensitivity of The Daily.
According to Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, the director of the Coun
seling and Psychological Services at
Vaden Health Center, the number
of students using its services has
been increasing in the past decade.
This is an alarming situation that
University officials should be
aware of. The Intermission article
reflects the stereotypes and stigmas
that people have on psychiatric dis
orders. They carry such a taboo
that no one should mention any
thing about it on campus.
Students should view depression
and other psychiatric conditions se
riously. Depressed patients should
not be viewed as failures because
depression is tied to genetics, neu
robiology and social environment.
