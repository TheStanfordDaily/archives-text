## Hoover: No cause for protest 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
One thing I admire about the
fojks over at the Hoover Institu
tion the right-leaning think
tank associated with the beauti
fully Freudian tower that defines
the Stanford skyline is that
they sure know how to piss off lib
erals.
My favorite example is in one of
their regular "paid editorials" in
the center-left magazine The New
Republic (June 9), in which they
claim that all of the loopholes, in
centives and breaks written into
the tax code make our corporations
inefficient, and that the only solu
tion is to scrap the whole tax code
and switch to a flat tax in which ev
eryone pays the same percentage
rate regardless of income. What
cheek to rail against the corporate
lobbying and accounting tricks that
have gutted our tax code and then
advocate completing their project
by finally nailing the coffin shut on
progressive taxation! But if we
don't, warns the ad, our corpora
tions will be vulnerable to competi
tion from slimmer, meaner, flat
taxed Estonian corporations who
don't have to hire tax lobbyists, tax
accountants and tax lawyers be
cause they file their tax returns on
postcards.
Now that's left-baiting in style.
But what pisses off the liberals even
more is that 15 percent of Hoover's
budget is a donation from Stanford
University. If that doesn't get your
knickers in a knot, you're not a
member of the Young Communist
League.

In response, campus groups have
started a petition to cut the financial
relationship between Stanford and
the Hoover Institution. Other groups
have started a petition to protect its
academic freedom. They even had
protests and counter-protests last
year, and will likely have more this
year.
But let's take a step back. This is
not an academic freedom issue. Aca
demic freedom, as used these days, is
the fuzzy-headed idea that the things
I want to say are protected by my aca
demic freedom and the things you
want to say are political and don't de
serve institutional sponsorship. Like
how you can promote prayer at
school functions but not condoms. Or
start a peace research institute but
kick out ROTC officers. It's all rela
tive.
What is at issue then? Stanford's
contribution to Hoover is used only
for the library, which houses 1.6 mil
lion volumes and 25 miles of shelves
of archives on campus. Sinister. It's
open to the public; go check it out
sometime. By the way, Stanford's
contribution is enough to cover about
60 percent of the cost of the library,
Hoover picks up the other 40 per
cent.
After the library, another 40 per
cent of the Hoover budget used to
support social science researchers.
It's not just right-wingers, by the
way; they just pretend that to piss off
liberals. A number of Hoover fellows
have joint appointments to Stanford
departments, and this is a big factor
in attracting and retaining these peo
ple at Stanford. And even those who
don't teach classes at Stanford often

host seminars that are open to stu
dents and the general public.
Are we getting a good deal? If I
were a university president I'd jump
at the chance for some chump to pick
up 40 percent of the cost of a library
and pay salaries for a bunch of first
rate scholars, including three Nobel
laureates, to work on my campus.
And if I were a subversive leftist as
well, I'd be chortling that they were
spending their money on goodies for
my students rather than on publish
ing absurd paid editorials to piss off
the liberals, or even worse, actually
mounting an effective lobbying effort
for these policies.
But the bottom line is that it
would take more pressure than the
anti-Hoover organizers can possibly
hope to muster to convince any uni
versity president to give Hoover the
boot. Given that, let's say you take 75
people and get them to protest out
side Hoover for an hour, and the
other guys organize 25 people for a
counter-protest in favor of academic
freedom. The result? Nothing hap
pens. Is the world a better place?
Now let's say instead they all got
minimum-wage jobs flipping burgers
for that hour and donated that money
to the UNICEF. Bam, that's 5,000
children immunized against measles.
So I say, forget about Hoover.
We're lucky they're here, but it
doesn't really matter what we think
anyway. There are more worthwhile
things to get riled up about.
