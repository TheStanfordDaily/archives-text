# NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER
## Living the hardcore existence 
### 
Gory, maroon and painful-looking cuts,
bruises and scratches covered my pro
fessor's legs. Below an Australian bush
hat and a mass of carrot-orange hair, his
facial expression was one of utmost gravity. We
heard he was lost in the rainforest, whispered a
member of our class. We timidly asked him if this
was true.
"Lost?" he laughed, as if to mock us. "Lost is a
state of mind. These scrapes are just from a day
hike."
I wouldn't describe this man as an Indiana

Jones type in fact, Harrison
Ford would look like a weakling
compared to this man—just an
extreme traveler, as well as one of
our professors here in Australia.
If I had to choose one word to de
scribe his existence, it would be
"hardcore." So hardcore, in fact,
that it verges on insanity. He'll
show us slide shows about his
amazing experiences abroad
tackling dangerous terrain in Tas
mania, scaling cliffs in South

Africa. This man has no boundaries. He simply
thrives on action.
As our group stared in awe and a little fear of
this Kiwi (Australian lingo for someone from New
Zealand), we were also refreshed. There is light at
the end of the tunnel, we thought; you really can
love your job. Our other professors here have
shown similar levels of passion the type that
borders on slight craziness. Our Marine Studies
professor does not hesitate to touch, pull or poke
any marine mammal he encounters in hopes of
learning more about it. He's escaped some dicey
situations ones that I would never in my wildest
nightmares want to encounter.
Spending intense amounts of time with such
passionate and enthusiastic adults has undoubted
ly made our classes and activities more interesting
and educational, but I've found that they've also
made me realize an interesting point: just because
you become an "adult" doesn't mean you have to
enter a working life of boredom. I would even
argue that these professors here have more fun
than many young people I know. (Yes, you: Get
out of the library and enjoy the sunshine every
once in a while.)
I took my last "official teenager" breath last
week, at last turning 20 years old. It marked one of
the first times when I wasn't exactly overjoyed to
cut that birthday cake. Many of my classmates jok
ingly remarked that I had to act like a "real" adult
now, there was no turning back.
"You're old now," they jested. I tried to laugh.
I think it came out more like an asthmatic cough.
I think we're all scared to reach certain birth
days, and blowing out those 20 candles is definite

ly a landmark that can be a little unnerving. You
can no longer blame your mischievous moods on
the fact that you're still an adolescent. You are
now expected to act like a member of the mature
adult world. You have your entire life ahead of
you. Well, your working life, that is.
We all prepare for such a long time for the
working world: studying intently in high school,
taking killer classes at Stanford, often going to
graduate / law / med school afterward. And for
what? In the hopes that we will find something
that will fulfill our lives and make us successful.
You pick your definition of success: happiness,
money, fame we all strive for one or a combi
nation of these, and I'm sure that we'll work like
mad for them.
But we all know that it is not so easy, with life
throwing you hurdles in every direction. Although
I'm excited to find "the job of my dreams," I know
from many of my older friends that you very rarely
start out that way. Hearing of the crazy, demand
ing hours that some of these recent graduates have
to work in their entry-level positions is downright
frightening especially those climbing that gru
eling investment banking ladder.
So when I saw my Australian professors thor
oughly enjoying their work, whether it was
teaching or doing research, I felt revitalized. The
most enjoyable part of interacting with them was
the way in which they approached their work en
vironments, showing the same enthusiasm of a
little kid exploring the beach for the first time.
Are these professors fully mature adults? Sure,
but certainly in touch with their inner child.
Granted, their work environments are unbeat
able: coral reefs, rainforests . . . but even so,
they showed such dedication and eagerness to
wards their work that they certainly inspired our
group.
You won't find me standing in front of a class
someday with scratches covering every last inch
of my skin, like our professor stood that one day,
but I hope that I can approach life with the same
hardcore attitude as our professor. He's stepped
off the beaten path (literally, that's how he got
the scratches!), choosing a job that satisfies his
passion. As we graduate and leave Stanford,
many of us will get job offers that may sound ap
pealing for financial or fame motives, and if this
is what drives you and what will fulfill your life,
then by all means, take the chance. But don't set
tle for a job that can only satiate your spending
needs; find the kind of job you would eagerly
wake up every Monday morning to attend, and be
hardcore about discovering exactly what that
may be.

fessor's legs. Below an Australian bush
hat and a mass of carrot-orange hair, his
facial expression was one of utmost gravity. We
heard he was lost in the rainforest, whispered a
member of our class. We timidly asked him if this
was true.
"Lost?" he laughed, as if to mock us. "Lost is a
state of mind. These scrapes are just from a day
hike."
I wouldn't describe this man as an Indiana

Jones type in fact, Harrison
Ford would look like a weakling
compared to this man—just an
extreme traveler, as well as one of
our professors here in Australia.
If I had to choose one word to de
scribe his existence, it would be
"hardcore." So hardcore, in fact,
that it verges on insanity. He'll
show us slide shows about his
amazing experiences abroad
tackling dangerous terrain in Tas
mania, scaling cliffs in South

Africa. This man has no boundaries. He simply
thrives on action.
As our group stared in awe and a little fear of
this Kiwi (Australian lingo for someone from New
Zealand), we were also refreshed. There is light at
the end of the tunnel, we thought; you really can
love your job. Our other professors here have
shown similar levels of passion the type that
borders on slight craziness. Our Marine Studies
professor does not hesitate to touch, pull or poke
any marine mammal he encounters in hopes of
learning more about it. He's escaped some dicey
situations ones that I would never in my wildest
nightmares want to encounter.
Spending intense amounts of time with such
passionate and enthusiastic adults has undoubted
ly made our classes and activities more interesting
and educational, but I've found that they've also
made me realize an interesting point: just because
you become an "adult" doesn't mean you have to
enter a working life of boredom. I would even
argue that these professors here have more fun
than many young people I know. (Yes, you: Get
out of the library and enjoy the sunshine every
once in a while.)
I took my last "official teenager" breath last
week, at last turning 20 years old. It marked one of
the first times when I wasn't exactly overjoyed to
cut that birthday cake. Many of my classmates jok
ingly remarked that I had to act like a "real" adult
now, there was no turning back.
"You're old now," they jested. I tried to laugh.
I think it came out more like an asthmatic cough.
I think we're all scared to reach certain birth
days, and blowing out those 20 candles is definite

ly a landmark that can be a little unnerving. You
can no longer blame your mischievous moods on
the fact that you're still an adolescent. You are
now expected to act like a member of the mature
adult world. You have your entire life ahead of
you. Well, your working life, that is.
We all prepare for such a long time for the
working world: studying intently in high school,
taking killer classes at Stanford, often going to
graduate / law / med school afterward. And for
what? In the hopes that we will find something
that will fulfill our lives and make us successful.
You pick your definition of success: happiness,
money, fame we all strive for one or a combi
nation of these, and I'm sure that we'll work like
mad for them.
But we all know that it is not so easy, with life
throwing you hurdles in every direction. Although
I'm excited to find "the job of my dreams," I know
from many of my older friends that you very rarely
start out that way. Hearing of the crazy, demand
ing hours that some of these recent graduates have
to work in their entry-level positions is downright
frightening especially those climbing that gru
eling investment banking ladder.
So when I saw my Australian professors thor
oughly enjoying their work, whether it was
teaching or doing research, I felt revitalized. The
most enjoyable part of interacting with them was
the way in which they approached their work en
vironments, showing the same enthusiasm of a
little kid exploring the beach for the first time.
Are these professors fully mature adults? Sure,
but certainly in touch with their inner child.
Granted, their work environments are unbeat
able: coral reefs, rainforests . . . but even so,
they showed such dedication and eagerness to
wards their work that they certainly inspired our
group.
You won't find me standing in front of a class
someday with scratches covering every last inch
of my skin, like our professor stood that one day,
but I hope that I can approach life with the same
hardcore attitude as our professor. He's stepped
off the beaten path (literally, that's how he got
the scratches!), choosing a job that satisfies his
passion. As we graduate and leave Stanford,
many of us will get job offers that may sound ap
pealing for financial or fame motives, and if this
is what drives you and what will fulfill your life,
then by all means, take the chance. But don't set
tle for a job that can only satiate your spending
needs; find the kind of job you would eagerly
wake up every Monday morning to attend, and be
hardcore about discovering exactly what that
may be.
