## The 						curse of the great big baby 
### 
The Curse is the reason your team
lost last year, the year before that,
since whenever. There's no such
thing as a curse, you say? Just pick
a sport. They're all cursed: Basketball,
Baseball, Football, Golf. Pick a team: The
Clippers, the Tigers, the Bengals. They're
all cursed with the top draft picks and poor
records. Pick the equipment Tiger's
Nike Driver, which captured zero wins and
just as many fairways. Pick a streak the
Bills' Superbowl 0-4, or your hospital visit
every time you go skiing. Sports Illustrated
cover anyone?
Phil Mickelson is cursed. The guy
knocks down hundred-foot snaking putts
like Frank the Tank knocks down brews but
he's never won a major. He nets millions

handing it to second tier
players at Pro-Ams and
Invitationals, but what's
the difference?
The only thing we
care about is where he
can't win. Look at his
U.S. Open early round
lead last summer. The
curse that nips at the
guy's heels on every fair
way tripped him up and

took him down. It was destined to be. We all
saw the dark figure looming behind him,
just as we see it in the bleachers at every
Cubs and Sox game.
Don't be so quick to laugh at Cubs fans:
You've got the same shadow. It was there in
your polo shirt when you scored 115 your
last round of golf. You knew you shouldn't
have worn that polo, the one you fell down
the stairs last week, but it was the only clean
one you had left, so you did... and got
hosed.
Well let me tell you about a curse I've re
cently documented, one that has smothered
every sports figure to test it: the 2003 Curse
of "The Simpsons."
You don't believe me? Look at the
showboating ringers who appeared on Mr.
Burns' Nuclear Plant softball team. Ken
Griffey Jr. was without question the guy
destined to rewrite the offensive and gold
glove histpry books. In 2003? Injured in
spring training, then injured for the year
after coming back two months later and
gone from the superstar realm.
Darryl Strawberry? Jail. Again. Don
Mattingly, a career Yankee who retired the
year before the Yanks started turning the
World Series into a fall field trip, has had to
bear it all in front of his TV without a single
career playoff appearance. Jose Canseco?
Roided out of his mind and in prison for
spousal abuse. Wade Boggs was caught
cheating on his wife, and Angels manager
Mike Scioscia went from first to worst in
2003 with the exact same roster.
Remember when Tom Kite was on "The
Simpsons"? Kite the American Legend,
who holed out from the bunker with the lob
wedge on the 15th at the 1992 U.S. Open to
own the golfing world? Now without a sin
gle win in 2003, he's busy trying to beat up
on the real seniors on the Champions Tour.
He's lost his lob wedge contract, and he's
lost to LASIK surgery the oversized bifo
cals that made him Tom Kite.
Troy Aikman's sitting at home trying to
remember what he was trying to remember
after getting literally knocked out of foot
ball. John Madden's on a Monday Night
Football team that has the worst ratings in
its 30 year history. Mark McGwire's knees
and back are disintegrating along with his
home run records. Venus and Serena? In
jured all year.
Joe Namath lost his Flexall 454
spokesman contract.
Roger Clemens in 2003? The guy could
only consistently beat sub .500 teams. Be
lieve me now?
What was that? You say he's got 310
wins, and 4,000 plus strikeouts? Some of the
best numbers of all time you say? The guy's
got nothing on him you say, just because
every other athlete on "The Simpsons" had
a bad run in 2003?
So you want to be rational now? Well
then what's that golf shirt you sucked it up in
doing taking the blame for all your short
comings when you haven't practiced putting
in a month? Why can't you realize that if you
send in a Tim Wakefield figure throwing 70
miles per hour against an Aaron Boone with
a slow bat something is going to happen? If
you do minimal weight training like Griffey,
you're going to get injured when you get
older. If you're a coke addict, you will go to
jail. If you lack the mental approach, you
won't win at Augusta.
It's not some destiny, it's fact. The only
curse in sports is the curse of the Baby. So
stop looking for excuses in everything but
yourself and your team. The fact is, if you
show up anywhere with a curse on your
mind you're only going to get knocked out
by the same shadow you decided to sit next
to in Wrigley's bleachers. Hopefully Phil
Mickelson gets a cameo on "The Simp
sons." At least then he'll have an entertain
ing story for blowing the next major.
