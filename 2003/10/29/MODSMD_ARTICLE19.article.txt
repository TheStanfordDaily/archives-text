# Card football stays positive
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When senior offensive tackle Kirk
Chambers sat down to field questions at
Stanford's weekly football press confer
ence yesterday, a reporter joked that he
was brave to face the press at this point in
the season.
Chambers laughed.
"The season hasn't reached that point
yet, where we start cowering away from
interviews," he said.
In a more serious tone, Chambers
tried to explain why he thought this
year's team wouldn't self-destruct like
last year's did.
"Our team this year still has that fight
... that I'm not sure we had last year," he
said.
Saturday's 35-0 loss to Oregon has
convinced many that the 2003 Cardinal
(2-4,0-4) is headed in the same direction
as last year's 2-9 team, which lost eight of
its last nine games.
But if yesterday's practice is an in
dication, Chambers was right that the
team hasn't given up. The scrimmages
were particularly intense, with play
ers diving for catches and tackles, of
fering congratulations for big plays
and reprimanding each other for mis
takes.
Junior linebacker David Bergeron
said that the team's chemistry has re
mained strong despite the four-game los
ing streak.
"There's no questioning [of players'
effort or the coaches' decisions] going
on," Bergeron said. "It's a more positive,
upbeat, excited feel."
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens

said the players' attitude has been "the
most encouraging thing" amidst the frus
tration of the losing streak.
"The thing that I admire in our play
ers is the leadership we continue to see,"
Teevens said. "People take responsibili
ty and hold themselves accountable.
"They continue to play hard, and I
keep telling you we'll have that break
through opportunity. It hasn't arrived
yet, but I'm very confident that it will ar
rive quickly."
The Cardinal will get its next chance
for a breakthrough against UCLA (6-2,
4-0) on Saturday at home.
Teevens has named senior Chris
Lewis the starter at quarterback for the
second straight game. Lewis completed
12-of-26 passes for 188 yards and three
interceptions against Oregon.
"[Lewis'] decision making was posi
tive," Teevens said. "Obviously, there's
always a few plays a quarterback would
like to have back, but he did some very
positive things."
Lewis started in place of freshman
Trent Edwards, who sustained a
sprained shoulder against Washington
State on Oct. 18.
"Trent is still a little bit sore right
now," Teevens said. "He'll be assessed
today by the physicians, and we'll find
out where he is."
Edwards did take snaps in practice
yesterday, throwing with what appeared
to be his usual accuracy.
In other injury news, Teevens said
sophomore center Brian Head would
miss the UCLA game, while junior de
fensive tackle Scott Scharff and junior
tight end Alex Smith would likely return
to action.
