Crises like war and economic depres
sion can have a profound impact on how
the American public judges the character
of presidents, two scholars argued last
night at a panel discussion entitled "The
American Presidency: Character and Cri
sis," presented by the Aurora Forum series
at a packed Kresge Auditorium.
History Prof. David Kennedy and pres
idential historian Michael Beschloss dis
cussed the notion of character in past and
current presidencies in a conversation
moderated by Michael Krasny, who hosts
"Forum" on KQED Public Radio.
Beschloss highlighted the difference in
the way the American public and histori
ans make judgments about character, also
pointing out that the public lacks the hind
sight that allows better judgments.
Kennedy also underscored the value of

historical perspective in determining the
character of a president. He named three
categories by which historians judge char
acter of presidents: clarity of conviction,
clarity of principle and clarity of communi
cation.
"The presidency is a relationship be
tween the office and the electorate; the
president must be able to communicate his
vision and ideas clearly to the people,"
Kennedy said.
Another aspect that affects opinions of
a president's character, Beschloss added,
is his courage in taking actions that might
conflict with the general beliefs of the
times and thus harm his reputation.
"You want a president that will say that
an issue is more important than his popu
larity, not one that is 'afraid to rock the
boat' for fear of not getting re-elected," he
said, alluding to an unpopular Civil Rights
Bill that hurt John F. Kennedy's image in
the South but illuminated his character in

the eyes of historians.
However, courage in the face of oppo
sition and clarity of goals does not excuse
"dumb decisions," Kennedy said. He and
Beschloss mentioned instances of stub
bornness that led to what they consid
ered unsuccessful presidential terms,
such as those of Richard Nixon and Her
bert Hoover.
A recent restriction of information has
made it extremely difficult for historians to
get access to presidential data, Krasny
pointed out.
Beschloss agreed, noting the diary
written by Franklin D. Roosevelt's secre
tary of the interior, a "compelling reading
that took you right into the times of his
presidency."
Now, it is in the interest of presidents to
"keep as little a paper trail as possible, for
fear of media leakage or subpoena for
trial," he said. Character flaws, too, are in
creasingly kept as hidden as possible, cre

ating an obstacle for historians.
Kennedy and Beschloss agreed that the
benefit of hindsight and access to certain
sources would shed clearer fight on the
characters of recent presidents.
"Right now, analyzing the recent presi
dencies is similar to Dickens' installments
of novels before the conclusion is even
written," Kennedy said.
Both historians agreed that the events
of Sept. 11 and President George Bush's
high-risk gamble to wage war on terrorism
would prove to be the pivotal point of his
presidency.
In a meeting with Bill Clinton,
Beschloss recalled, Clinton said, "I wish I
was president during World War II."
Beschloss said that this was not evi
dence that Clinton is a masochist, but
rather that great presidents arise out of
great tests like war and depression and
their character is assessed through their
response to crisis.
