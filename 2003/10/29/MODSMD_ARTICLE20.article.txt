# Crum thrives on physicality of position
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior men's water polo player Greg Crum has always
been intrigued by the sport. His dedication to the game has
already paid off, not only allowing him to travel around the
world but also making him one of the key players on the
Cardinal squad at the difficult two-meter position.
As a child who loved the water and with a father who
played the game, it was natural for Crum to join the team at
Chadwick High School in San Pedro, Calif. He was a high
school All-American, made first team All-CIF twice, was
league MVP twice and the captain of his team.
"My team in high school was really fun. I got to play with
a lot of my best friends and we had a really great time. We
weren't the best team around, but we won some games and
we usually had fun," Crum said.
Stanford is generally acknowledged as the place to be for
college water polo, but Crum never thought seriously about
attending until his fourth year of high school.
"Until the middle of my senior year in high school, going
to Stanford was so far-fetched that I didn't even think about
it," he said. "Once I got in here and actually came to campus
it was kind of surreal."
Crum played reserve his freshman year at Stanford be
cause there was already a strong man in his two-meter posi

tion, giving him the chance to develop his skills.
"When I started playing with the team for the first time,
I figured I'd never be able to play with those guys," Crum
said. "Luckily, I had some good coaching and great team
mates, so the transition was made easier by those factors."
His position as a two-meter, or hole man, is one of the
most difficult in water polo, the most intensely physical spot
in what is already a vicious contact sport.
"As a two-meter man, he takes the brunt of the beating
by the other teams and is rarely rewarded," said junior Sam
Tyre, who also plays the two-meter position.
"Last year was his first big year of contribution for the
team and since then he has been a great offensive threat to
our team," added former Cardinal Jeff Nesmith, Class of
2003, who played with Crum for the last two years.
Crum's role has expanded from offensive to defensive as
well, a skill he constantly works to develop.
"I'm not one of the players that comes to mind when you
think of defense," Crum said. "I could always play decent of
fense, but to be successful on the college level, you have to
play both ways. My defense is always a work in progress, but
I'm always trying to improve."
As a two-meter, it is Crum's job to stay close to the goal
and take shots. Because the position is so prime location
wise, it's the most heavily defended spot in the pool, and the
officials often overlook all the fouling that occurs.

"My job is to hold good position, control the ball when it
comes to me, pass the ball when necessary, attempt to draw
exclusions and shoot the ball if the situation calls for it," he
said. "I definitely look to shoot more than most two-meter
players, but I'm always working on being more well-round
ed. I look to Sam Tyre's two-meter style to try to improve
my all-around play."
While much of the jockeying for position happens un
derneath the water, in the two-meter position the players
frequently push and wrestle with each other even above the
surface. In addition, the position requires that the player
tread water with his back to the net.
"As a hole man you are asked to gain position and hold
that position for at least 15 seconds of the shot clock which
can turn into a lot longer depending on the amount of fouls
being called on the perimeter," Nesmith explained.
Crum usually scores at least once a game. And he's al
ready gotten off some amazing goals this season, with a few
especially fine wrap-around points.
Crum has a particularly interesting build for a polo play
er, being stockier and a bit shorter than many men in the
two-meter position.
"It helps to be big and strong to play two meter offense.
Strong legs are really important. I'm not as tall as most two-
meter men, but I've got pretty
strong legs, so that helps a lot.
Mike Derse isn't the biggest guy
around, but he's got stronger legs
than anyone I know, so he's very
effective at two meter offense, as
well as a great all-around player,"
Crum said.
Cram has even had the chance
to travel internationally while
playing water polo, with Mike
Derse on the National Junior
Team at the World Champi
onships in Istanbul in 2001 and
last summer at the World Univer
sity Games in Korea.
"International competition is
really intense and you learn so
much playing against that kind of
competition," he said.
Nesmith values Cram's abili
ty to get fired up during a game.
Once he is provoked, Crum be
comes "a roaring inferno of
power and desire that I would
not want to get in the way of,"

Nesmith said.
"Once I actually got caught by
an elbow of his on the side of my
head and I felt it for a couple of
days," he recalled.
Crum isn't afraid to take big
shots in the pool and to play out
side his given position. Like all
good water polo players, he can
adapt to different game situa
tions. He scored the winning-goal
in the Big Splash with Cal last
year on an outside shot with four
seconds left in the game; even
though he normally plays on the
inside.
Crum has also impressed his
team with his commitment and
fortitude in developing his skills.
"Greg is the most dedicated and
one of the hardest working mem
bers on the squad," Tyre said. "He
is one of those guys that would be
in the pool the day after a loss, to
work harder then ever to make
sure it will not happen again."
"He anchors the team with his
intense determination during
practice in the pool and in the
weight room," Nesmith added.
"He has an incredible work ethic

which can't help but rub off on
those around him."
In person, Crum comes off as
a quiet, relaxed fellow. And, if
Nesmith is to be believed, he is a
man of few words until you put a
mic in his hands according to
Nesmith, Crum and teammates
Mike Derse and Matt Moser have
a band and Crum's specialty is
Rolling Stone's covers.
"Last winter we had one gig at
the athlete date auction," Derse
said.
(Nesmith also claims Crum
drives a tan VW bus named Ellie-
Mae.)
When asked how his team
mates would describe him,
Crum thought they'd think of
him as fun-loving and hard
working in and out of the pool,
but he was a bit off on Sam
Tyre's responses.
"If you talked to Mike Derse
or Sam Tyre, though, they'd prob
ably make fun of me, especially
Sam. But I've got nothing but
love for Sammy and Mike. And
the rest of my teammates for that
matter," Crum said.

way to becoming one of the most important players on the No. 3 men's water polo team.
