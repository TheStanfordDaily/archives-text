# Singles fall, pair triumphs

### MIA R.LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's something to be said
about sweltering 95-degree after
noons in late October: only in Cali
fornia.
There's also something to be said
about the singles bracket upset of
the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team in the ITA Northwest Region
al Championships: only by Califor
nia.
The Cardinal was nowhere to be
found in the final singles match of
the Oct. 24-27 tournament, held at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. In
stead, it was third-seeded Daria
Panova of Oregon who emerged vic
tor over California's Sasha Podkolz
ina in three sets, 4-6,7-5,6-2.
In her first collegiate tourna
ment, runner-up Podkolzina
wreaked havoc on the Cardinal. The
unseeded freshman mercilessly dis
posed of Stanford's fourth-seeded
Alice Barnes, a sophomore and run
ner-up at last year's Regionals, 6-2,
6-2.
Stanford senior Lauren
Barnikow and freshman Anne
Yelsey also suffered straight-set de
feats to the Golden Bear freshman.
Unseeded Yelsey survived the

longest of the three Stanford ath
letes, falling to California in the
semifinals. Nevertheless, the match
lasted just over an hour, with Pod
kolzina taking only 25 minutes to
blank Yelsey in the first set.
"I didn't play her right," said
Yelsey of her 0-6,2-6 loss. "I was hit
ting the ball just fine, [but] it was the
end of a long weekend [and] I kind
of just went out there and was not
thinking. I played to her strengths
[instead]."
Forty-five minutes into the '
match, a series of powerful serves
from Yelsey finally allowed her to
clinch her first game.
The score stood at 1-2 in the sec
ond set and Yelsey showed modest
signs of breaking back in the game.
Unfortunately, many of her would
be forehand winners fell just outside
of the baseline and Podkolzina
quickly regained momentum.
Podkolzina broke Yelsey's serve
to go up 4-1, and then forcefully
served out the rest of the match.
"I didn't really get the opportuni
ty to be aggressive," Yelsey said.
"[Sasha] was on top of everything
and she was hitting winners off of
every ball."

Junior Alice Barnes and partner Joanna Kao fell in the quarterfinals of Regional ITA action to Cardinal
teammates freshman Teresa Logar and junior Story Tweedie-Yates.
Head coach Lele Forood, though dis
pleased with the outcome of the Cardinal-
Bears showdown, acknowledged the sig
nificant threat, which Podkolzina posed.
"Sasha's a player who competes excep
tionally well. It's very difficult to play her
[because] she forces people out of their
games," Forood said. "It was good to get a
few chances to have [Stanford] people play
her and get familiar with her unusual
style."
Fifth-seeded Barnikow, despite a con
sistent serve and fierce rallying power, lost
to Podkolzina in the quarterfinals, 3-6,1-6.
Fortunately, she and the rest of the Cardi
nal troupe fared much better in doubles
competition.
Barnikow and her partner, junior Erin
Burdette, stayed true to their top-ranked,
top-seeded form, claiming the Regionals
doubles title over California's second
seeded Podkolzina and Raquel Kops-
Jones, 8-5.
Barnikow and Burdette's triumph qual
ifies them for the prestigious ITA Nation
al Intercollegiate Indoor Championships,
held at University of Michigan Nov. 6-9.
The final victory also serves as vindica
tion for Burdette, who recently dropped an
ITA All-American singles title to senior
Kops-Jones. Currently grappling with a
wrist injury, top-seeded Burdette was
forced to withdraw from the singles com
petition at Regionals.
"It was more important to her to play
the doubles," Forood said.
Overall, the Cardinal came away from
doubles competition at Regionals more as
sured. In addition to victors Barnikow and
Burdette, the teams of Teresa Logar and
Story Tweedie-Yates, Emilia Anderson
and Anne Yelsey, broke through to the
semifinals.
The fourth Stanford duo of Alice
Barnes and Joanna Kao dropped a tough
quarterfinal to Logar and Tweedie-Yates,
6-8.
With the end of Regionals, Stanford
women's tennis now faces several months
of grueling preparation for the team sea
son, which begins in late January. Forood
is pleased to wind down the individual sea
son with such a solid performance.
"I think more than anything, I'm really
happy that our freshmen got a chance to
get established and feel that they really be
long."

pleased with the outcome of the Cardinal-
Bears showdown, acknowledged the sig
nificant threat, which Podkolzina posed.
"Sasha's a player who competes excep
tionally well. It's very difficult to play her
[because] she forces people out of their
games," Forood said. "It was good to get a
few chances to have [Stanford] people play
her and get familiar with her unusual
style."
Fifth-seeded Barnikow, despite a con
sistent serve and fierce rallying power, lost
to Podkolzina in the quarterfinals, 3-6,1-6.
Fortunately, she and the rest of the Cardi
nal troupe fared much better in doubles
competition.
Barnikow and her partner, junior Erin
Burdette, stayed true to their top-ranked,
top-seeded form, claiming the Regionals
doubles title over California's second
seeded Podkolzina and Raquel Kops-
Jones, 8-5.
Barnikow and Burdette's triumph qual
ifies them for the prestigious ITA Nation
al Intercollegiate Indoor Championships,
held at University of Michigan Nov. 6-9.
The final victory also serves as vindica
tion for Burdette, who recently dropped an
ITA All-American singles title to senior
Kops-Jones. Currently grappling with a
wrist injury, top-seeded Burdette was
forced to withdraw from the singles com
petition at Regionals.
"It was more important to her to play
the doubles," Forood said.
Overall, the Cardinal came away from
doubles competition at Regionals more as
sured. In addition to victors Barnikow and
Burdette, the teams of Teresa Logar and
Story Tweedie-Yates, Emilia Anderson
and Anne Yelsey, broke through to the
semifinals.
The fourth Stanford duo of Alice
Barnes and Joanna Kao dropped a tough
quarterfinal to Logar and Tweedie-Yates,
6-8.
With the end of Regionals, Stanford
women's tennis now faces several months
of grueling preparation for the team sea
son, which begins in late January. Forood
is pleased to wind down the individual sea
son with such a solid performance.
"I think more than anything, I'm really
happy that our freshmen got a chance to
get established and feel that they really be
long."
