# Singles fall, pair triumphs

There's something to be said
about sweltering 95-degree after
noons in late October: only in Cali
fornia.
There's also something to be said
about the singles bracket upset of
the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team in the ITA Northwest Region
al Championships: only by Califor
nia.
The Cardinal was nowhere to be
found in the final singles match of
the Oct. 24-27 tournament, held at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. In
stead, it was third-seeded Daria
Panova of Oregon who emerged vic
tor over California's Sasha Podkolz
ina in three sets, 4-6,7-5,6-2.
In her first collegiate tourna
ment, runner-up Podkolzina
wreaked havoc on the Cardinal. The
unseeded freshman mercilessly dis
posed of Stanford's fourth-seeded
Alice Barnes, a sophomore and run
ner-up at last year's Regionals, 6-2,
6-2.
Stanford senior Lauren
Barnikow and freshman Anne
Yelsey also suffered straight-set de
feats to the Golden Bear freshman.
Unseeded Yelsey survived the

longest of the three Stanford ath
letes, falling to California in the
semifinals. Nevertheless, the match
lasted just over an hour, with Pod
kolzina taking only 25 minutes to
blank Yelsey in the first set.
"I didn't play her right," said
Yelsey of her 0-6,2-6 loss. "I was hit
ting the ball just fine, [but] it was the
end of a long weekend [and] I kind
of just went out there and was not
thinking. I played to her strengths
[instead]."
Forty-five minutes into the '
match, a series of powerful serves
from Yelsey finally allowed her to
clinch her first game.
The score stood at 1-2 in the sec
ond set and Yelsey showed modest
signs of breaking back in the game.
Unfortunately, many of her would
be forehand winners fell just outside
of the baseline and Podkolzina
quickly regained momentum.
Podkolzina broke Yelsey's serve
to go up 4-1, and then forcefully
served out the rest of the match.
"I didn't really get the opportuni
ty to be aggressive," Yelsey said.
"[Sasha] was on top of everything
and she was hitting winners off of
every ball."
