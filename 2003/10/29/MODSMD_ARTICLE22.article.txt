# HARVEY'S PRESENCE FELT
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS 
As a fourth-year varsity player on the women's volley
ball team, one would expect Jennifer Harvey to be an in
tegral part of the Cardinal team and key to its playoff as
pirations.
But it hasn't always been that way.
The 6-foot-5 middle blocker has grown in ways —as
both a person and a player —that many did not antici
pate.
"I wish I had her a couple more years, because she just
keeps getting better," said Stanford head coach John
Dunning.
What is unusual about Harvey this year is the vast
change in her game compared to last season. Harvey has
always been a force on the team and within the Pacific 10
Conference leading the conference in blocking aver
age during the 2002 season and she's perennially been
among the nation's leaders.
At 6-foot-5, Harvey came to Stanford as the tallest
women's volleyball player in the school's history. She al
ters opposing team's strategies by forcing them to play a
smaller court.
Dunning has ventured to say that she may "even be the
best blocker in the nation," a skill which Harvey says "just
came naturally to [her.]"
But, what has been most impressive this season is the
way in which Harvey has evolved in other aspects of her
game. She has become more of a threat from the service
line and improved her hitting percentage considerably,
making her an even more dangerous player.
Harvey leads the team in service aces (24) and is
among the team leaders in hitting percentage (up to .337
from .299 at the end of last year, and within .03 of her ca
reer high). She attributes this improvement to her
"changed arm swing," a development that Dunning says
she was "simply determined" to pursue.
Harvey is one of four seniors on this year's team
looked to for leadership, an especially important role
given the five freshmen new to Dunning's program. If ex
perience is a necessity for leadership, Harvey is qualified
for this role, having played on Stanford's 2001 National
Championship team and as a member of the U.S. Junior
National Team in 1999 with former Stanford players
Logan Tom and Ashley Ivy.
"I was able to learn there [with the National Team] and
bring the lessons here," Harvey said.
As one of the remaining players from the 2001 team,
Harvey brings a determined mindset. With the Cardinal
all but certain to be heading to the postseason again, this
experience becomes even more important for a team that
lost a heartbreaker in the NCAA Championships to USC
in the 2002 season.
Additionally, the Cardinal has lost its other senior
middle blocker, Sara McGee, to injury, placing an in
creased amount of responsibility on Harvey.
"[lt's] a pressure that I embrace," said Harvey of the

added responsibility. "We all have to adjust [with McGee
being out]."
As her level of participation has increased, so has her
level of play, going from 11 starts and 1.1 blocks per game
during her freshman year to 1.43 blocks per game last year
as a junior.
Harvey's impact on the squad goes far beyond her
blocks, aces and all the other numbers. Her work ethic
and friendly personality are contagious.
"She's someone everyone likes," Dunning said. "She
works as hard as she can everyday and leads by perfor
mance.
"She may not be really vocal, but there are lots of ways
to be a leader, and in her case, she's just strong and a ter
rific person. I would love to have someone just like her on
every team I coach," he said.
