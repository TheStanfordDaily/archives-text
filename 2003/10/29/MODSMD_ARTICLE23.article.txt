# Field hockey splits games against SMS
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After Sunday's 6-0 pummeling of the
Southwest Missouri State Bears (5-12, 1-5
Northern Pacific Conference), the Stanford
(4-11,2-3) field hockey team came out confi
dent on Tuesday for Senior Day. Unfortu
nately for the Cardinal, the Bears actually
came to play on Tuesday and managed to es
cape with a 2-1 win.
Southwest Missouri got on the score
board first when junior forward Cassie
Franklin passed to junior midfielder Gabby
Gomez.
Gomez took a shot from the right that
beat Stanford goalkeeper Emily Zander and
hit the lower left comer of the goal in the first
half.
Both the Bears and the Cardinal played
tough games, maneuvering inside the circle
oftly to have the other team come up with a
good defensive play and push them out.
Stanford was finally able to penetrate the
SMS defense in the second half.
Freshman midfielder / forward Cara-
Lynn Lopresti scored for the Cardinal after
quickly moving the ball down the field.
"I passed it down to Lyndsay [Erickson]
and then she dribbled in and shot," Lopresti
said. "It rebounded off the goalie and I just
took a shot at the top of the circle."
That goal, along with the three she scored
in Sunday's game, puts Lopresti atop the
team standings with eight goals and 22 points
this season.
The game remained tied until Adrein
Trumpy pushed the ball through the Stan
ford defense to give Southwest Missouri a 2-
1 lead in the 62nd minute and its first Nor-
Pac win.
Stanford had good chances to score on a
few penalty comers at the end of the game
but the Cardinal failed to convert those
chances into goals. Freshman Aska Sturde
van's first shot on the penalty comer went
wide and Erickson's shot was stopped with
no time on the clock by SMS goalkeeper
Jessie Lininger.
"The last four minutes we were down in
the circle," Loprresti said. "We had those last
two comers and if we had finished on some of
the shots, it could have been anyone's game."
The close game was frustrating for Stan
ford because the Cardinal felt it had the
chance to pull out a win had it been more ag
gressive when creating scoring chances.
"It was disappointing. We did generate
some very close opportunities toward the
end but we really need to be doing that much

earlier in the game," said Stanford head
coach Lesley Irvine.
Stanford couldn't help but leave the field
on Tuesday with a feeling of disappointment
after dominating the same team on Sunday.
"It should have never been that close of a
game," Lopresti said. "I said [last time] that
we should play the same every game and we
definitely didn't come out as the same team
[the second game]."
Stanford looked confident on every play
on Sunday, whether it was defense or of
fense. It maintained good possession and the
Cardinal was aggressive on defense.
Stanford scored a season-high six goals
and recorded its first shutout of the season on
Sunday. So when comparing how it played
against the same team Tuesday, the Cardinal
felt it needed to learn from the experience.
"It was definitely frustrating especially
since we know we have the capability to beat
this team, since we just did it [Sunday]," said
senior forward Noor Dawood. "It's a good
lesson for us since we know we have poten
tial for so much."
In addition to the match itself, there was a
small ceremony beforehand to celebrate the
seniors.
"It's been a pleasure just meeting all kinds
of different people and
traveling to a bunch of great places," said
Zander. "Overall it's been really exciting."
The four graduating seniors honored
were defender Dani Guernsy, midfielder
Keely Machmer-Wessels, Dawood and
Zander.
Guernsey played in 62 games and was
named National Field Hockey College Asso
ciation All-Academic during her career at
Stanford.
Machmer-Wessels co-captained the
squad this year and has been named to the
NFHCA All-Academic team three times.
Dawood, also a co-captain was a NFHCA
All-Academic and started 65 games over the
course of her Stanford career.
Zander, Stanford's rock in goal, accumu
lated 161 saves in her career, while also being
named NFHCA All Academic.
"I loved being on the team. I'm definitely
sad that this is my last game," Dawood said.
"The team has been incredible and its just
been a really great experience for me."
While she's sad to be moving on, Dawood
feels optimistic about leaving the team in the
hands of the younger players.
"I definitely think that we have some
great leaders to take over this team in the fu
ture and I'm confident that they'll do a great
job."
