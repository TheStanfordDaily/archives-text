### DAVID HERBERT 
Speaker and activist Jessica Weiner spoke
last night at Roble Hall on body image culture.
Her presentation in front of a packed
Roble parlor sought to raise awareness about
sensitive issues like eating disorders and de
pression.
"This is not a sorority issue. This is a human
issue," Weiner said.
Weiner mainly read selections from her
new memoir "A Very Hungry Girl," which
tells of her struggle with body image. She en
couraged the crowd to examine the current

state of affairs in society.
"This is a legitimate mental health issue we
need to discuss," Weiner said.
She also challenged her audience not to
look for someone to blame, like men or the
media, but to think positively.
"I am not a victim. When you purchase
media, you have a responsibility to learn about
it," Weiner said. "You need to celebrate the
everyday victories of being a conscious per
son."
Many in the audience agreed with Weiner's
message.
"Basically, I felt she removed the stigma

surrounding disorders and made it very per
sonal," said junior Mary Sun. a Peer Health
Educator in Trancos.
The event was organized by several campus
health organizations, including Vaden Health
Center, MIRROR. Health Promotion Ser
vices and the Women's Community Center.
"My observations of being a dorm staffer,
my experiences at the Bridge Peer counseling
Center and my life experiences at the end of
Stanford led me to believe that this was an
issue I couldn't ignore," said Stanford gradu
ate and MIRROR founder Molly Tanen
baum.

Tanenbaum founded MIRROR last spring
as a resource for community members with a
friend suffering from an eating disorder. The
group provides trained peer counselors to go
over communication strategies and provide
basic information about disorders.
"The main issue is silence," Tanenbaum
said.
Ultimately, it was this silence that Weiner
sought to break in her talk.
"What I've learned over the years is that
you are never alone," she said. "Someone can
always relate to you. People's strength and hu
manity is humbling."
