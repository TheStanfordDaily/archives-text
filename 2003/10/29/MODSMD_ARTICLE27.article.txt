# Free online science journal launched

### JULIE YEN 
The Public Library of Science (PLoS), co
founded by Stanford biochemist Patrick Brown,
has launched a new online science journal that
makes science research available for free as an
alternative to expensive, subscription-only
journals.
"If we succeed, the treasury of knowledge in the
scientific and scholarly literature will not be re
stricted to the lucky few who have access to the re
search libraries of wealthy institutions like Stan
ford, but to billions of people around the world,"
Brown said.
The library's two goals are to establish the
journal, called PLoS Biology, as a premiere jour
nal with scientific repute and to revolutionize the
way scientific research is published. Traditional
ly, the major science journals hold exclusive
rights to the publication of scientific break
throughs, but PLoS will not require any such
agreements.
"We believe this will be a great boost to edu
cation, informed medical practice and scientific
literacy," Brown said. "And it will enable scien
tists to develop creative new ways to organize, in
tegrate and use the information that currently ex
ists as stacks of journals on library shelves, or
their digital clones."
The journal has been well received by sci
entists and students, particularly in the field
of computational biology and genomics, in
which access to large bodies of information is
crucial. Less wealthy institutions and coun
tries that lack access to a large fraction of sci
entific and medical literature also responded
favorably. Within one day of the Web site's

debut last Sunday, the server crashed from
nearly 500,000 hits and about 80,000 down
loads.
Although PLoS Biology eliminates subscrip
tion fees, research teams must pay $1,500 to pub
lish their work. This charge is at the high end of
the cost of publishing, which can be as cheap as a
few hundred dollars.
Yet, Stanford Professor Mark Krasnow, and
associate chairman of the Department of Bio
chemistry, contends that this cost is not large rel
ative to most research budgets and should not
turn off potential contributors.
"Because rapid and wide dissemination of re
search results is important for the advance of the
field, funding agencies are willing to pay for this
added value," Krasnow said. "Indeed, some fund
ing agencies such as the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and Wellcome Trust have already
agreed to cover publication costs in journals like
PLoS Biology that make their content freely and
immediately available, and it is likely that other
funding agencies will follow."
School of Medicine Professor of Developmental
Biology and Genetics Matthew Scott said that in the
past, Stanford has paid considerably larger fees than
those charged by PLoS. He believes that PLoS's
cost is also low because charges for pages, color re
production and reprints are largely eliminated.
"As the Open Access model spreads, we will
all be paying lower subscription and online access
fees. The new system is a bargain," Scott said.
But not all subscription-only science journals
are convinced to make the leap yet. The Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science,
the publisher of Science magazine, expressed
wariness about the economic viability of the on

line journal's business plan.
"We see this as an experiment in scientific
publishing," said Alan Leshner, chief executive of
the association. "Like all scientists, we are going
to wait and see what the outcome is. We can't fig
ure out how they are going to cover all their ex
penses."
He speculated that if Science, which has been
in publication for 120 years, adopted an initiative
similar to that of PLoS Biology, it would have to
charge $lO,OOO per published article just to cover
its news and editorial costs, as opposed to PLoS's
$1,500.
Leshner said that Science will consider other
business models, but plans to continue increasing
reader access through other means. Articles from
the magazine can be viewed online, and 1,000 site
licenses have been provided to universities so that
they can have free access.
PLoS Biology will contain research in all areas
of the life sciences and allied fields. Regular fea
tures intended to reach a broad audience will con
tain explanations about the significance of the
work, background and ideas of a scientific field
and even the processes involved in creating a sci
entific paper. The journal intends to convey these
in a language and style accessible to non-experts.
Although PLoS intends to focus on its online
version, it will also offer printed copies to those
interested.
"Our business model doesn't depend on sell
ing the printed journal; we will neither save
money nor lose money if we discontinue it,"
Brown said. "But we expect that a reasonable
number of people will want it just because it's
beautiful, convenient and a great value, since
we're not making any profit."
