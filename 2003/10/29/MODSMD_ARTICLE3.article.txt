# Vice Provost Cordell to run for office
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost of Campus Relations LaDoris Cordell
has a vision for the City of Palo Alto, but she never ex
pected to be called a "Great White Hope," when she en-

tered the race for city council.
When Cordell was campaigning at
the Farmer's Market in Palo Alto one
morning, a woman approached
Cordell and announced that not only
was she voting for Cordell, she consid
ered her a "Great White Hope."
Cordell, who is black, was caught off
guard and asked her to repeat what she
had said, saying she had never been
called a "white hope" before. The
woman was embarrassed, but Cordell
gave her a big hug.
"That should have been my theme,"
Cordell said jokingly.
Though she gives no predictions for
the Nov. 4 election, Cordell's grass
roots campaign has already impressed
some voters, including Cathy Jensen,
an administration manager for the Of
fice for Religious Life.

Jensen partnered with Cordell last year for the Dia
betes Walk, at which Cordell helped organize a Stanford
team, which raised $30,000.
Cordell also organized a Stanford presence at the local
AIDS Walk two years ago.
"What primarily influenced me to support her cam
paign is the person that she is; kind-hearted, honest, trust
worthy, has a generous heart and enthusiastic spirit. She is
a quick study and a great listener," Jensen said.
'Giving back'
A Palo Alto resident for 20 years who sent both her
daughters to public schools, Cordell has a strong desire to
remain part of the community.
"I want to live out the rest of my life in Palo Alto," she said.

Cordell decided to run for city council at the request of
her neighbors. She began attending city council meetings
and talking to her neighbors out of concern about a pro
posed construction development near her home.
"I have absolutely no political aspirations. If I do this,
I do this because I want to make a contribution," she said.

Cordell highlighted a commitment to
public service as her first reason for run
ning; it was a commitment fostered by
her parents, whose dry-cleaning busi
ness outside of Philadelphia formed a
hub of the community, and by her edu
cation.
"I've spent 19 years of my profession
al life in public service. I could have been
with a private law firm somewhere mak
ing gobs of money, and I chose not to. I
chose to work in the public sector be
cause I believe in giving back," she said.
Palo Alto City Councilmember Vic
Ojakian said that while he is not person
ally familiar with Cordell, "She has good
experience working in the public arena
as a judge and hopefully understands
how to work with a cross-section of peo
ple and their personalities. She is articu
late, and people praise her intelligence."

Nevertheless, he had some reservations.
"She is relying on various organizations and individuals to
get her elected and assuming that they have influence in the
community," he said. "Her election results will partly be a
yardstick for how much influence these folks have. She is con
sidered smart but is not well versed on the current issues."
Cordell believes that her 19-year tenure as a judge has
given her the decision-making skills she thinks will be crit
ical as a city council member.
"I learned how to make decisions in a timely fashion,
make the tough ca11... I kept this little slogan taped to my
bench, 'A good judge is long of fuse and thick of skin.' "
'Bright mind'
John Barton, a Palo Alto school board member who

serves with Cordell on the board of the community Work
ing Group which is building a homeless shelter and 89
units of affordable housing said Cordell's strength is
her ability to make decisions in a timely way based on
available information.
"LaDoris is a bright mind who can get to the key issues
of a topic quite quickly. Her ability to synthesize informa
tion and make clear distinctions about what is important
and what is not will be highly valuable on the council,"
Barton said.
Cordell has noticed that it's common for city council
members to have difficulty coming to an informed agree
ment on issues.
"This isn't just this city council; it's been like this for
years," she said. "They get caught up in what's called the
'Palo Alto Process.' Nothing gets done, because decisions
don't get made in a timely fashion. It's the law in Califor
nia that if you're a judge, and a case is submitted to you,
you have to make a decision in 90 days or you don't get
paid. It's a great incentive."
Cordell wants to bring a clear view of how she feels a
city council member should approach the job: not by mi
cromanaging, or rubber-stamping, but by setting policy.
"They need to hold those who report to the city coun
cil accountable for the things they do. And I want to be
one of those people who gets the discussion going so we're
all on the same page about what it is that city council peo
ple do," Cordell said.
The four-year position is unpaid and part-time, and
Cordell plans to continue working at Stanford if elected. She
talked about running with University President John Hen
nessy, but she doesn't want any support from the University.
"He looked at me and he laughed," said Cordell of her
conversation with Hennessy, "And said, 'Why in the
world do you want to do the city council?' "
"I think he's confident, as am I, that I can do that and
do this work," she said.
Cordell has a policy of not accepting money from any
one. She is funding the campaign with $3,000 of her own
money, while a typical candidate will spend $20,000-
$30,000. She wanted to avoid issues of campaign financing

and make a statement about the im
portance of community involve
ment as part of the democratic
process.
"The person who raises the most
and spends the most wins: That is
not democracy," Cordell said.
"Change needs to come and it takes
people starting at the local level to
say we need to change the way
things work ... my hope is that a
ripple effect will go out."
To cut costs, Cordell had the
East Palo Alto Mural Art Project
hand paint lawn signs for her on do
nated paper. Her largest single ex
penditure was a $692 ad that will run
in the Palo Alto Daily.
"People who don't even have
$6OO, how do they do it? That's
just one ad for one day," she
said.
'What is Palo Alto?'
Wells believes that Cordell is well
known throughout her community.
"When you look at all the en
dorsements that LaDoris has you will
know that she does indeed have name
recognition and is not an unknown to
her community," Wells said.
One of her big efforts is neighbor
hood coffee gatherings nearly every
night, and she's held almost 40 of them.
"That's democracy, because
it's actually going into the com
munity, sitting down with people,
and finding out what their con
cerns are," she said. "I think it's
appropriate to do not just when
you're a candidate, but as a city
councilperson."
Ultimately, while Cordell advo
cates moderation in development,
one of her goals is to bring the di
verse groups of Palo Alto back to
gether as a united whole from
low- and middle-income residents,
like teachers, to the wealthy. She
also intends to address neighbor
hood traffic, one of the most divisive
issues in the city.
"The bigger issue is this: What is
Palo Alto? What do we want it to
be? I don't know if we've heard
much of that discussion in public
discourse."
