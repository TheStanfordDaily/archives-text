Weeks after Apple launched a Windows version of iTunes, its online
music store and digital music player, many Stanford students have made
the switch from traditional file-sharing programs to Apple's alternative,
citing its speed, reliability and the fact that it is legal.
Mac owners have used the iTunes music player since it came out a few
years ago, and have been able to buy songs for 99 cents a pop since the
iTunes Music Store was launched six months ago. After selling some 13
million songs to Mac users, iTunes for Windows was launched in mid-Oc
tober to serve a larger market, according to an Apple press release.
"It was ingenious for Apple to combine a music store with a music play

With a program for Macs and PCs that allows users to listen to the music
of any iTuner who authorizes it and is on the same network, more Stanford
students are jumping on the iTunes bandwagon.
"It's perfect for dorms," said sophomore Max Etchemendy. "It's a great
way to get exposed to new genres."
"I love iTunes," declared sophomore Justy Burdick, a resident comput
er consultant. Having used iTunes since the second day the PC version was
released, Burdick said that the speed and reliability of iTunes makes for a
better way to listen to music than traditional file-sharing programs.
"It's a great way to rapidly increase your music selection while on a fast
network like Stanford's," he said.
Apple calls it a "Digital Music Revolution," but most people who use
iTunes are still "Mac people," according to Burdick. Still, the trend is
spreading. Many who don't use iTunes have recently gotten wind of the
new program through advertisements for the service and its accompanying
portable music player, iPod, which plaster the skyscape of Bay Area towns.
In an e-mail titled "yay for music sharing, download iTunes" freshman
Cindy Wang encouraged her entire dorm to share music.
"They have a super cool just-as-good-as-Mac version out now for
Windows," Wang said. "Once you get the program, you can access the
MP3 music library of anyone on the local network (so it's almost as good
