# Students rave over iTunes sharing service
## 
### EVA DEHLINGER 
Weeks after Apple launched a Windows version of iTunes, its online
music store and digital music player, many Stanford students have made
the switch from traditional file-sharing programs to Apple's alternative,
citing its speed, reliability and the fact that it is legal.
Mac owners have used the iTunes music player since it came out a few
years ago, and have been able to buy songs for 99 cents a pop since the
iTunes Music Store was launched six months ago. After selling some 13
million songs to Mac users, iTunes for Windows was launched in mid-Oc
tober to serve a larger market, according to an Apple press release.
"It was ingenious for Apple to combine a music store with a music play
er," said freshman David Pfau.
With a program for Macs and PCs that allows users to listen to the music
of any iTuner who authorizes it and is on the same network, more Stanford
students are jumping on the iTunes bandwagon.
"It's perfect for dorms," said sophomore Max Etchemendy. "It's a great
way to get exposed to new genres."
"I love iTunes," declared sophomore Justy Burdick, a resident comput
er consultant. Having used iTunes since the second day the PC version was
released, Burdick said that the speed and reliability of iTunes makes for a
better way to listen to music than traditional file-sharing programs.
"It's a great way to rapidly increase your music selection while on a fast
network like Stanford's," he said.
Apple calls it a "Digital Music Revolution," but most people who use
iTunes are still "Mac people," according to Burdick. Still, the trend is
spreading. Many who don't use iTunes have recently gotten wind of the
new program through advertisements for the service and its accompanying
portable music player, iPod, which plaster the skyscape of Bay Area towns.
In an e-mail titled "yay for music sharing, download iTunes" freshman
Cindy Wang encouraged her entire dorm to share music.
"They have a super cool just-as-good-as-Mac version out now for
Windows," Wang said. "Once you get the program, you can access the
MP3 music library of anyone on the local network (so it's almost as good

as downloading, but you don't fill
up your hard drive) and, oh yeah,
it's not illegal. Woohoo."
Indeed, the craze stems not
only from the fast access to a
large amount of music, but also
because there is less worry about
legal issues than with other music
downloading programs. Because
music is being shared on the net
work, it is similar to listening to a
CD that a friend is playing in a
car. The music can be borrowed
from other users, but not copied
from them.
However, some find iTunes to
still be morally and legally iffy. A

question that some bring up is
whether one may resell music once
purchased online. And many stu
dents use the service without actu
ally ever purchasing music from
the store.
Derwin Fields, a freshman who
has used iTunes for about a week,
enjoys the chance to browse oth
ers' music. But when asked
whether he buys music as well,
Fields admits, "I usually just
mooch off the network."
So does Pfau.
"I've got 20,000 songs off of oth
ers' computers," he said. "Why
would I want to buy my own?"
However, not all users employ
this same strategy.
"I buy a fair amount of music,"
said Etchemendy, who likes to
support the non-mainstream

artists he listens to. '"Records,
CDs, everything. It's a big part of
where my disposable income
goes."
Some complain that the pro
gram still has its flaws. Unlike file
sharing, music selection is limited
to the local network, and thus find
ing exactly what you want is not al
ways possible.
"I couldn't find a lot of classic
rock I was looking for," Pfau said.
However, not all students use
iTunes as a replacement for tradi
tional file sharing.
"I view it as a way to see what
other music my friends are listen
ing to and as means of exploring
new music I'm not expecting,"
Etchemendy said.
