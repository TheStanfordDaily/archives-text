The Daily deeply regrets a misprint in
Monday's story, "Senior dies of cystic fibro
sis," in which a quote was mistakenly attrib
uted to Leslie Hotson, the student who
passed away. We would like to offer our sin
cere apologies to Hotson's family and
friends.

Also, in yesterday's story, "Search for
dean nears completion," Nadiya Figueroa
was identified as a member of the search
committee for the new dean of students.

Figueroa is not a member of the search com
mittee, nor are there three students on the
committee. The student representatives to
the committee are Monica Henestroza and
Blake Naughton.

Last Thursday, in "Book says founder
poisoned," Gordon Earle was identified as
director of University communications.
Earle is vice president for public affairs.
Alan Acosta is director of University com
munications.
