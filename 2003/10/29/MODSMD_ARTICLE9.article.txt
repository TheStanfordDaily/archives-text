## The 						Virginator: Insane in da membrane 
### 
/ / ure, they're nice guys, but you
• • know they're all virgin sur
. geons," my friend said, finger
ing her knotted hemp choker.
She regarded me through the pointy black
frames of her vintage cat's-eye glasses.
"They're up to something half the time. But
they don't bother us 'cause they know their
friends are onto them."
Deep within the towering edifice that is
Berkeley (hence the hemp) High School, we
were passing the precious seconds before
Mme. de Roquefort's (names have been
changed for discretion's sweet sake) French
class with the usual desultory chat. Suddenly,
though, at "virgin surgeon" my ears pricked
up, and my freshman-flashback self was all
agog.
Now, not much can raise a Bezerkeley girl's
eyebrows. I thought I'd pretty much seen and
heard it all, thanks to folks such as the cocoa
colored diva who worked it in only a lime-green
string bikini and gold lame stiletto sandals my
first day of high school, sauntering by just as I

was asking about the dress
code. There was the dude who
whiled away history seminar
rolling joints at his desk (the
teacher spotted him,
shrugged and continued some
interminable story about
pushing a hula hoop for miles
through the former Eastern
bloc). Then there was "shock
off" and the five-finger rule
(don't ask). And these are

only the ones fit to print. (jHay caramba!)
As Mme. de Roquefort described Tristan's
lust for Yseut in her sibilant Italian accent, I
wondered what a virgin surgeon was. In my
mind's eye, I imagined some leering, night
mare version of TV's fresh-faced Doogie
Howser, M.D. Eyes (etc.) bulging and silver
speculum in hand, he slowly advances toward
a trembling, wide-eyed teenage girl. Sloshing a
jigger of Natty light over her iridescent
Sketchers sneakers, a beer-addled grin
spreads like a salacious rigor mortis over his
face. "Come to Daddy," he croaks, snapping
his instrument ominously.
But seriously folks, if there is a modern-day
"cult of the virgin"(in the way that some of the
faithful paid homage to the Virgin Mary in
olden days), it's totally focused on the wrong
thing. To paraphrase that indelible Cypress
Hill catchphrase: People get insane about the
membrane. Some women are so concerned
about their partners believing that they are vir
gins that they go under the knife to reconstruct
their maidenhead. Down in El Lay (as the late,
great Herb Caen dubbed it), for example, one
Dr. David L. Matlock peddles, among other
spurious surgical wares, "laser hymenoplasty"
for hymen restoration.
In Saussurian terms, there's a tendency to
concentrate overmuch on the signifier, the
physical sign the rupturing of a bloody (in
the British sense) film. There's not enough at
tention paid to the signified the more ab
stract consent to intimacy with a particular per
son rather than all the casting-couch starlets or
brainy, brawny enfants terribles you certainly
be getting it on with instead (right?).
Rather than fixating on the physical state as
sociated with virginity, it would be better to con
sider why anyone might want to reserve sexual
favors for a certain partner in the first place.
Today, anyone can order wear-and-throw-away
clothing off the Internet. IKEA promotes the
concept of disposable furniture. Our fast food
feasts are use-and-discard. We takes bats to our
computers (a la "Office Space"), deep-six our
cars and even trash (mobile) homes. Now that
planned obsolescence has become a reality, are
we moving into an era in which even humans
have become disposable?
I'm not talking Terry Schiavo. I'm thinking
about how the idea of going through things to
gether with someone for a meaningful period
can be cast into the pop-culture landfill. Once
"Cedric" or "Ermentrude" is kaput sexually
once they are no longer new and fresh and "vir
ginal" to us the accepted solution seems to
be to upgrade to Cedric 2.0 or Ermentrude ME.
And so on, ad nauseum.
Ask any bartender, and they'll tell you a
"Virgin Surgeon" is a cocktail made with Blue
Curacao, Apricot Liqueur, Triple Sec and a
dash of grenadine. But behind the burgeoning
"virgin surgeon" phenomenon is a sexual
mindset that can leave some people shaken,
not stirred. It leaves others, often men, unable
to treat women as more than sexual objects.
(To see this mindset operating in an extreme
way, just look at certain areas of the world
where preteen virgins are sought after by men
who believe that having sex with a virgin will
cure them of AIDS). There's a reason we're fo
cusing more on the panties of Kobe's alleged
victim (who was not a virgin at the time of the
alleged rape) than on her psychological state,
and it's not just prurience. It's a conflation of
the physical and mental aspects of sex. And
until we disentangle the two, it's going to be a
rough ride.

When Nicole Wright was a child, at the arch
duke's, her cousin's, she had never tasted a
"Virgin Surgeon." And, alas, after years of sun
light, in the Hofgarten, she still hasn't. If you too
think that April is the cruellest month, e-mail
her at nwright@stanford.edu.

ginal" to us the accepted solution seems to
be to upgrade to Cedric 2.0 or Ermentrude ME.
And so on, ad nauseum.
Ask any bartender, and they'll tell you a
"Virgin Surgeon" is a cocktail made with Blue
Curacao, Apricot Liqueur, Triple Sec and a
dash of grenadine. But behind the burgeoning
"virgin surgeon" phenomenon is a sexual
mindset that can leave some people shaken,
not stirred. It leaves others, often men, unable
to treat women as more than sexual objects.
(To see this mindset operating in an extreme
way, just look at certain areas of the world
where preteen virgins are sought after by men
who believe that having sex with a virgin will
cure them of AIDS). There's a reason we're fo
cusing more on the panties of Kobe's alleged
victim (who was not a virgin at the time of the
alleged rape) than on her psychological state,
and it's not just prurience. It's a conflation of
the physical and mental aspects of sex. And
until we disentangle the two, it's going to be a
rough ride.

When Nicole Wright was a child, at the arch
duke's, her cousin's, she had never tasted a
"Virgin Surgeon." And, alas, after years of sun
light, in the Hofgarten, she still hasn't. If you too
think that April is the cruellest month, e-mail

/ / ure, they're nice guys, but you
• • know they're all virgin sur
. geons," my friend said, finger
ing her knotted hemp choker.
She regarded me through the pointy black
frames of her vintage cat's-eye glasses.
"They're up to something half the time. But
they don't bother us 'cause they know their
friends are onto them."
Deep within the towering edifice that is
Berkeley (hence the hemp) High School, we
were passing the precious seconds before
Mme. de Roquefort's (names have been
changed for discretion's sweet sake) French
class with the usual desultory chat. Suddenly,
though, at "virgin surgeon" my ears pricked
up, and my freshman-flashback self was all
agog.
Now, not much can raise a Bezerkeley girl's
eyebrows. I thought I'd pretty much seen and
heard it all, thanks to folks such as the cocoa
colored diva who worked it in only a lime-green
string bikini and gold lame stiletto sandals my
first day of high school, sauntering by just as I

was asking about the dress
code. There was the dude who
whiled away history seminar
rolling joints at his desk (the
teacher spotted him,
shrugged and continued some
interminable story about
pushing a hula hoop for miles
through the former Eastern
bloc). Then there was "shock
off" and the five-finger rule
(don't ask). And these are

only the ones fit to print. (jHay caramba!)
As Mme. de Roquefort described Tristan's
lust for Yseut in her sibilant Italian accent, I
wondered what a virgin surgeon was. In my
mind's eye, I imagined some leering, night
mare version of TV's fresh-faced Doogie
Howser, M.D. Eyes (etc.) bulging and silver
speculum in hand, he slowly advances toward
a trembling, wide-eyed teenage girl. Sloshing a
jigger of Natty light over her iridescent
Sketchers sneakers, a beer-addled grin
spreads like a salacious rigor mortis over his
face. "Come to Daddy," he croaks, snapping
his instrument ominously.
But seriously folks, if there is a modern-day
"cult of the virgin"(in the way that some of the
faithful paid homage to the Virgin Mary in
olden days), it's totally focused on the wrong
thing. To paraphrase that indelible Cypress
Hill catchphrase: People get insane about the
membrane. Some women are so concerned
about their partners believing that they are vir
gins that they go under the knife to reconstruct
their maidenhead. Down in El Lay (as the late,
great Herb Caen dubbed it), for example, one
Dr. David L. Matlock peddles, among other
spurious surgical wares, "laser hymenoplasty"
for hymen restoration.
In Saussurian terms, there's a tendency to
concentrate overmuch on the signifier, the
physical sign the rupturing of a bloody (in
the British sense) film. There's not enough at
tention paid to the signified the more ab
stract consent to intimacy with a particular per
son rather than all the casting-couch starlets or
brainy, brawny enfants terribles you certainly
be getting it on with instead (right?).
Rather than fixating on the physical state as
sociated with virginity, it would be better to con
sider why anyone might want to reserve sexual
favors for a certain partner in the first place.
Today, anyone can order wear-and-throw-away
clothing off the Internet. IKEA promotes the
concept of disposable furniture. Our fast food
feasts are use-and-discard. We takes bats to our
computers (a la "Office Space"), deep-six our
cars and even trash (mobile) homes. Now that
planned obsolescence has become a reality, are
we moving into an era in which even humans
have become disposable?
I'm not talking Terry Schiavo. I'm thinking
about how the idea of going through things to
gether with someone for a meaningful period
can be cast into the pop-culture landfill. Once
"Cedric" or "Ermentrude" is kaput sexually
once they are no longer new and fresh and "vir
ginal" to us the accepted solution seems to
be to upgrade to Cedric 2.0 or Ermentrude ME.
And so on, ad nauseum.
