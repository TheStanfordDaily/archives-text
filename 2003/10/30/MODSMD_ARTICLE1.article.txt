# New bill restrict early applications

### SEAN HARRIS 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to
renew the Higher Education Reauthorization Act,
potentially opening the door for the government
to intervene in college admissions' policies, includ
ing early decision and "legacy" issues. While the
bill could adversely affect smaller institutions with
limited financial resources, an institution as large
as Stanford is likely not to feel any ill effects, said
University President John Hennessy.
Still, Hennessy argued against the potential of
an attempt by the federal government to affect ad
missions policies.
"For the federal government to institute a 'one
size fits all' [policy] would not be in the best inter
ests of higher education or the students," Hen
nessy said.
This is the first year of Stanford's switch from
early decision to early action as an admissions pol
icy; next year's freshman class will be the first to be
admitted under the new policy.
"All private institutions have a set of rules that
are best for them," Hennessy said. "[A policy sim
ilar to Kennedy's] would hurt some institutions in
an attempt to reach greater diversity."
The bill could affect university admissions by
limiting federal support to schools that have cer
tain policies in place, said Valerie Williams, assis
tant director for public policy for the National As
sociation for College Admissions Counseling.
In recent weeks, in anticipation of the bill,
members of NACAC and other organizations
voiced concerns about whether the government
should be able to intervene as a "policing agent" in
college admission policies.
However, when the bill came out on Tuesday,
there was only a brief section on early decision,
which requires schools to report data on students
admitted under early decision or legacy policies
with no punitive actions toward these schools,
Williams said.
"We feel this is just getting their foot in the door
for future legislative policies," she added.
Williams said that it is uncommon for a legisla
ture to impose sudden, drastic action when shap
ing a policy.
She added that while NACAC is still debating
its position, it feels that early decision provides
some benefit to students. Still, the organization
disagrees with the bill's push to exert government
influence on universities.
"We don't agree with punishing schools for ad
missions policies," she said. "We aren't intent on
having the federal government involved [in influ
encing admissions policies]."
The biggest arguments against early decision
and legacy policies is the unfair treatment such
policies have on minority students. Poor or minor
ity students often fail to take advantage of early
decision policies, according to Kennedy's office,
because of financial aid considerations. Applicants
who wait for regular admission decisions receive
detailed information about financial aid packages
upon admission.
Kennedy's bill seeks to "address access and re-
