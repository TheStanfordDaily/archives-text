# Daily Trainer: Don't torture yourself with sleep deprivation
## 
### 
Numerous scientific studies say it's
bad for you. Captors torture
POWs with it. Yet Stanford stu
dent engage in it on a daily basis.
No, it's not the cafeteria food; this goes be
yond sketchy meal choices. The destructive
habit rampant on campus is none other than
sleep deprivation.
The National Sleep foundation reports
that two-thirds of Americans get less than
the recommended eight hours of sleep.
Come mid-term season, that lengthy luxury
of rest is almost unheard of on college cam
puses. Pulling an all-nighter or waking up at
4 a.m. to study for that crucial test is a rite of
passage in college life. Shouldn't we all
wear those dark bags under our eyes with
pride?

Think again, my sleep-indebted friend.
Those futile hours spent studying instead

of getting some REM ac
tion are going to cramp
your style. Short attention
span, drowsiness and de
creased mental retention
all accompany that line of
drool on your test where
you nodded off on prob
lem number five.
I know your mental fac
ulties might be sluggish

right now, but try and stay with me as we
enter the wonderful world of scientific stud
ies. Research done in our own backyard
shows that when you get those four hours of
sleep matters as much as your stupidity in

not getting eight. A Stanford University
Medical Center study shows that partici
pants with early morning sleep fare better
than their late-night cohorts. Moral of the
study: sleep from 2:15 a.m. to 6:15 a.m.
rather than 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Added
incentive: You can't get Dominos pizza de
livered after 2 a.m.
The Medical Center also released a
study two years ago comparing the effects
of sleep deprivation and alcohol on driving.
Sleep affects our driving skills as much as
alcohol, slowing our reaction times to
match those of a drunken person. Driving
under the influence of melatonin would,
therefore, appear to be a bad decision.
Conversely, more sleep would be a good
idea and napping would be the best idea of

all. Options available to students pressed
for time include a quick snooze in the Bing
Wing or during lecture. If you're desperate,
spend your time in section occasionally
waking up to flip the handout over, perfect
ing the art of sleeping on your fist. Your TA
will never notice.
Other more proactive approaches to
sleep-friendly lifestyles include not
being a swimmer or a member of crew; I
don't care how early they go to sleep, the
laws of the universe dictate that no one
can get a full eight hours when they wake
up at 5 a.m.
For everyone else, sleep tight. When that
alarm goes off, remember that you can't
blame anyone but yourself. And the profes
sor who gave you the midterm.
