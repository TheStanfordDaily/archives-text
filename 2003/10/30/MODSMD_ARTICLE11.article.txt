## Unit distribution should be more fair 
### 
Discrepancies in the number of units
assigned to classes have left some stu
dents with unmaneagable course
loads. While humanities classes are
assigned five units, many engineering classes are
only worth three units, even though they merit
five —or more units given the amount of
work they require.
In theory, the number of units assigned for a
class correlates with the number of hours a class
meets per week. But this rule of thumb often
doesn't hold true at Stanford. Many seminars that
require large amounts of reading meet once a
week, yet they are still worth five units. In such
situations, exceptions are reasonable given the
work involved. But for many other classes, the
number of units assigned is too low given the
amount of work for the class. Examples include
Computer Science 103 X, Electrical Engineering
103 and Chemistry 35. These classes should be
worth more units than they currently are, but in
stead they carry less unit weight than an Intro
duction to the Humanities class or a first-year for
eign language class.
This results in a frustrating outcome: Unit to
tals in different majors don't correspond. A polit
ical science student can complete his major in 12
classes, while a Computer Science major must
take more than 30 classes to complete the major.
Some engineering students say they are glad
that their classes are only three units because they
would never be able to finish their major and take
other classes. If their required classes totaled
over 20 units every quarter, they would have to
petition to take extra units every three months.
However, no major should require overloading in
order to take a class for interest or intellectual
challenges.

For many technical majors, the problem of an
overloaded number of units is worsened by "hid
den units" classes that don't count toward the
major but are prerequisites for classes required
for the major. In essence, these units are required
because students need to take them. Examples
are math and physics introductory classes for En
gineering majors.
Not only does this discrepancy in units cause
logistical confusion, it also widens the so-called
techie-fuzzy gap. Many techies those who
major in the hard sciences believe that their
majors are more difficult and more time-consum
ing than those of their humanities counterparts.
While this may not necessarily be the case, three
unit classes in different departments often re
quire vastly different amounts of work. And
while fuzzy departments grounded in the human
ities and social sciences can be equally challeng
ing, they require fewer units for degree comple
tion. According to this year's Stanford Bulletin,
the Computer Science major ranges from 97 to
112 units, Electrical Engineering requires 113,
while Psychology only requires 55 and Linguistics
50.
The Registrar's Office, the Committee for Un
dergraduate Standards and Policy, academic
deans and professors must work together to cre
ate better guidelines for assigning units to classes.
The current policy puts far too much strain on
certain students to complete the necessary class
es in four years. While a rigorous curriculum is
often essential to learning, we believe that if Stan
ford is to provide its famed liberal arts education,
the University must make the necessary efforts to
ensure that students can take a broad range of
classes no matter what department they
choose for their degree.
