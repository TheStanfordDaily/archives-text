Answer Girl needs "real" ques
tions
Answer Girl, I've got a question
for you: Do you think I'm stupid?
There's no way the last question you
answered was the inquiry of a real
person ("Answer Girl: Is the uni
verse duodecahedral?" Oct. 28) A
boyfriend telling his sweetheart he
loves her "as much as the universe is
duodecahedral"? Get real, answer
girl, that's impossible. I think you are
guilty of fake-question-writing-and
then-answering.

Ad raises several questions
Many letters published regarding
the ad by campustruth.org have
been negative, and accused The
Stanford Daily of maligning a reli
gion, Islam, and fostering racism.
Unfortunately and painfully,
many ideas that pass for "truth"
withm the Arab world need to see
the light of day so they can be evalu
ated fairly. While the world is not
black and white as the ad suggested,
the attitudes that resulted m mur
derous terror from one part of the
Arab world should be discussed
honestly, by Arabs and non Arabs,
so that a way can be found to elimi
nate the terror.
Moreover, undying hatred of
Jews by Arabs continues and un
ceasing publication of Goebbels
esque libels in the Arab press, rang
ing from the medieval blood libels to
the more modern Protocols of the
Elders of Zion, abound. Such demo
nization of the Jewish minority on
the Arabian peninsula has in
essence, transformed the Palestini
an-Jewish differences from difficult
to insurmountable. Will this prob

lem be presented in the new pro
gram for Islamic studies?
Not one of the letter writers com
plained that the photos in the ad
were doctored or untrue, only that
the context in which they were pre
sented was simplistic and unfair.
Perhaps so, but 1 would make the
same statement about the letter
writers: They presented a limited,
biased critique of the ad. Only when
the authors of such letters "take a
larger view will their views truly con
tribute to our understanding of the
Middle East.

Pictures from ad must be recog
nized as truth
In response to Lizzi Heyde
mann's letter ("Letters to the Edi
tor, Oct. 29), I understand and agree
that it is possible to support Israel
without condoning (sic) the message
of the advertisement. However,
there is a definite truth to some situ
ations, and in this case, these pic
tures were not doctored. While it is
not necessary to accuse all Palestini
ans of being anti-American, anti-Is
rael and pro-terrorism, it is counter
productive to deny the fact that the
events depicted in these pictures did
happen.
It would be much more effective
to recognize the unfortunate reality
of these photos, that many Palestini
ans did celebrate on 9 /11 and work
to change the underlying causes.
While I do not blame Palestinians as
a whole for the problem of terrorism
in the Middle East, I do blame the
society built by the regime of Yasser
Arafat and his supporters, who have
consistently encouraged Palestini
ans to take an anti-Israel, anti-
American, pro-terrorist stance. Let
us not blame the Palestinians unjust

ly, but let us correctly pinpoint the
problem and work to resolve it
through diplomatic pressure.
There is an undeniable culture of
terrorism in Palestinian society. Let
us hope that someone finally puts a
stop to it at the guilty source.

Daily should draw line
in advertising policy
After looking at the advertise
ment placed bv campustruth.org on
page 12 of The Stanford Daily, I
must question your policy on what
is considered "fair game" in adver
tising. The Daily is one of the best
student newspapers that I have ever
came across, however, recent ad
vertisements placed by campus
truth are making me change my
opinion.
Where does The Dailv draw the
line for advertisers? Would you
allow me to place advertisements for
a pornographic Web site? Would
you allow me to advertise for a fas
cist group of militants who are seek
ing new members? Or would you
deny this to me, and say that I need a
political agenda? That would proba
bly be your best defense against
those claims. However, what if I
wanted to publish an advertisement
condemning the Israeli government
for their own terrorist-like actions
against Palestine in the Middle
East? Would you allow that to go
in?
I am not Israeli and I am not
Palestinian, but I am a reader of this
paper who is offended by the blatant
bashing of all Palestinians by the ad
vertisement that you allowed to be
published in your paper.

without condoning (sic) the message
of the advertisement. However,
there is a definite truth to some situ
ations, and in this case, these pic
tures were not doctored. While it is
not necessary to accuse all Palestini
ans of being anti-American, anti-Is
rael and pro-terrorism, it is counter
productive to deny the fact that the
events depicted in these pictures did
happen.
It would be much more effective
to recognize the unfortunate reality
of these photos, that many Palestini
ans did celebrate on 9 /11 and work
to change the underlying causes.
While I do not blame Palestinians as
a whole for the problem of terrorism
in the Middle East, I do blame the
society built by the regime of Yasser
Arafat and his supporters, who have
consistently encouraged Palestini
ans to take an anti-Israel, anti-
American, pro-terrorist stance. Let
us not blame the Palestinians unjust

ly, but let us correctly pinpoint the
problem and work to resolve it
through diplomatic pressure.
There is an undeniable culture of
terrorism in Palestinian society. Let
us hope that someone finally puts a
stop to it at the guilty source.

Daily should draw line
in advertising policy
After looking at the advertise
ment placed bv campustruth.org on
page 12 of The Stanford Daily, I
must question your policy on what
is considered "fair game" in adver
tising. The Daily is one of the best
student newspapers that I have ever
came across, however, recent ad
vertisements placed by campus
truth are making me change my
opinion.
Where does The Dailv draw the
line for advertisers? Would you
allow me to place advertisements for
a pornographic Web site? Would
you allow me to advertise for a fas
cist group of militants who are seek
ing new members? Or would you
deny this to me, and say that I need a
political agenda? That would proba
bly be your best defense against
those claims. However, what if I
wanted to publish an advertisement
condemning the Israeli government
for their own terrorist-like actions
against Palestine in the Middle
East? Would you allow that to go
in?
I am not Israeli and I am not
Palestinian, but I am a reader of this
paper who is offended by the blatant
bashing of all Palestinians by the ad
vertisement that you allowed to be
published in your paper.
