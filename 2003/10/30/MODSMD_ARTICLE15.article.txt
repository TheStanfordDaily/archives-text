# ORDER IN THE COURT?
## He'll take the Software Interview 
### 
One of the great things
about law school and
the reason why it's the
refuge of last resort for
everyone and their kid brother is
the fact that there are no formal pre
requisites. Unlike our compatriots
over in the medical school, nobody

assumes that we
were prenatally
indoctrinated
with the basic
tenets of organic
chemistry. While
certain back
grounds may
come in handy
the more
episodes of "Law
and Order"
you've watched,

the better off you are as a gener
al rule, all of us are equally well
equipped for success at legal
academia.
Not so, however, when it comes
to success in getting a job. For the
first time, I'm starting to regret that
my background is in software engi
neering, rather than something from
the fuzzy side of the Great Divide.
The reason for this is that the past
few weeks have given me my first
sustained introduction to the Legal
Interview, a creature quite different
from its distant relative, the Soft
ware Interview. These two species
parted ways a long time ago on the

evolutionary tree.
In the Software Interview, your
interviewer couldn't care less -about
your resume, your affability or even
your personal hygiene. All that mat
ters is whether you can code. The in
terviewer hands you a pen, points
you at a whiteboard and gives you
some kind of problem to solve:
"Okay, you have a randomly or
dered list of 101 numbers the num
bers one through 100 with one repeat.
Write code on the board to figure out
which number is repeated."
The interviewer then sits there
smugly watching you fumble around
trying to remember which numbers
are between one and 100. Sometimes
they'll switch things up with a brain
teaser: "How many raisins would fit
in the Empire State Building?"
The Legal Interview is much less
rigid. Consider the following:
INTERVIEWER: How would
your former coworkers describe
you?
ME: Um ... (pulls out driver's li
cense) 5-foot-10,145 pounds, brown
hair, blue eyes, corrective lenses
necessary?
INTERVIEWER: Which of your
resume accomplishments are you
most proud of?
ME: Gee, I'm not sure it's really
my best work... I guess I'd say the
choice of font, followed closely by that
snazzy horizontal line I added under

my name and contact information.
As you can probably tell, I'm hav
ing a lot of trouble with this. In a
Software Interview, I knew where I
stood. For example, I remain confi
dent that "three" was a good answer
to the Empire State Building ques
tion. It's a big building, and I'm pret
ty sure there's room for three raisins.
But with the Legal Interview, I'm
adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Maybe
they like people whose coworkers
remain ignorant concerning their
ocular defects.
Frankly, I think the lawyers
should take a page from the soft
ware engineers on this one.
Hand the interviewee a pen,
point her to a whiteboard, and say
something like:
"All right, the police busted
down the door while your client was
in the shower, and questioned him
while he was naked and soapy. Write
a brief arguing that any statement
made without underwear is per se
involuntary and thus inadmissible."
Hey, at least the soapy naked guy
probably knew when he'd given a
wrong answer.
