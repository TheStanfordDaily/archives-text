UW 1 Morto Elliott
â–  J Smith," read the
' headline. That
can't be right, I
thought. Elliott Smith couldn't die.
Johnny Cash might. George Harri
son, maybe. But Elliott Smith died
Oct. 21 after a self-inflicted knife
wound to the heart. Sure, there
were addictions and depression, but
despite frequent suicide references
and song titles like "Everything
Means Nothing to Me," Smith's sui
cide was met with shock by every
one of his fans. A singer / songwrit
er working on his sixth solo album,
we all thought we knew him some
how, and now we've lost a friend.
Many of those who actually
knew Smith, though, saw this com
ing. Two of Smith's friends recently
released an album with their band,
Quasi, which featured a song dedi
cated to Smith with the lines,
"You won't live long/But you
may write the perfect song."
Perhaps even more chilling is the
comparison drawn four years ago
by founder of one of Smith's record
labels between Smith and Kurt
Cobain. Slim Moon told Spin maga
zine that Cobain was "... The
same way [as Smith]: He appeared
really fragile, and in a lot of ways
was really stubborn, and he inter
nalized everything."
While the comparison is now ob

vious due to their common heroin
addictions and similar deaths, the
two artists also shared songwriting
styles. Both mastered the balance of
raw and candid self-expression with
beautiful and accessible melodies.
Smith, who idolized John Lennon,
never scoffed at catchy pop tunes.
Smith once told Spin Magazine:
"It's a big game to play, trying to
make something that's mainstream
enough and still human."
Between his dark lyrics and ac
cessible melodies, Smith has been
adored by college radio stations
across the United States for years,
and he was often hailed as the great
est songwriter of his generation. In
New York City, a candlelight vigil
was held the night he died. Last
night, there was a memorial in Port
land, Ore. A tribute concert sched
uled for Nov. 3 in Hollywood has al
ready sold out.
Here on this side of the Atlantic,
I figured I was one of the few people
who had ever heard his name, let
alone his songs. Italians indeed lis
ten to a great deal of American
music (three of the top five singles
in Italy right now are imported from
the States), but the songs that make
it over here are the most main
stream of the mainstream singles
that were popular a few months ago
in the United States. At any given
moment, on any given night, it's

safe to assume that somewhere in
an Italian club, you can hear Beyon
ce. However, I was told by a pro
ducer at MTV in Milan, that Smith,
along with others in the United
States and United Kingdom, amass
significant cult followings in Italy.
Obscure artists often find stardom
abroad long before they become
well known at home. Smith has
played to several packed audiences
here, though it was most likely a dif
ferent type of audience than he at
tracted in the United States. While
the college students that download
his mp3s in the United States are
preoccupied with Alternative
Rock, here in Italy, Smith has a
slightly more mature group: 30-
something music buffs.
Singer / songwriters, known as
"cantautori," are on the rise in Italy
much as they have been gaining
popularity in the United States, al
beit among a different set. One de
voted Florentine fan described sen
timents strikingly similar to mine
upon hearing of Smith's death:
"I felt somehow that he was close
to me, like a friend" he said. "This is
a great loss."
Indeed it is.
