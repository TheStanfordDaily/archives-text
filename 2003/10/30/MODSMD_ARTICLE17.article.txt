## Stanford football hits rock bottom 
### 
At one point or another, we've all been
there. After you bike face first into a
pole because you were checking out
some hottie and a cop writes you a cita
tion for not having your bike registered as you're
loaded into the ambulance.
After you get a midterm back only to find your
professor has scribbled, "Mamlet may not admit
it, but you were a mistake" on the front page of
your blue book, right next to a big, fat zero and a
frowning face.
Simply put, you've hit rock bottom, the point
where things have gone so terribly wrong that
you're convinced they can't possibly get any
worse.

While it's not exactly the type of place you'd
want to spend your weekend, if you happened to

want directions to rock
bottom you couldn't find
them on Mapquest.
You'll find them in the
first seven plays of the
fourth quarter of the
Stanford football team's
dismal loss at Oregon last
Saturday, which I've pro
vided for your conve
nience.

Start out going toward
the endzone on your opponent's one-yard line.
Rush J.R. Lemon up the middle for minus-one
yard.

Rush J.R. Lemon up the middle for no gain.
Get sacked for minus-10 yards.
Following a personal foul penalty gift from the
defense, you're back to the one-yard line with a
fresh set of downs.
Rush J.R. Lemon up the middle for no gain.
Rush Chris Lewis up the middle for no gain.
Rush J.R. Lemon up the middle for no gain.
(Rare is the chance to use the copy-and-paste
function to write a significant portion of my col
umn. I could get used to this.)
Get sacked again for minus-14 yards and look
for the big "Now entering rock bottom" sign.
Seven plays, minus-14 yards and zero points.
Estimated travel time: three minutes and thirty
three seconds.
Hitting rock bottom is like visiting Sacramento
you want to leave as fast as you can and you
don't ever want to come back. The first step to
leaving rock bottom is admitting you're there, so
after no Stanford player or coach confessed as
much in the post-game press conference, I feel it
is my journalistic duty to do so:
It's official. The Stanford football team has hit
rock bottom.
How do I know this?
I guess it's a gut feeling, really. OK, so it's
more than a gut feeling.
Let's put it this way, if Stanford's season were
a series of "Blind Date" episodes, Captain Obvi
ous would've popped up on the screen after Sat
urday's goal-line debacle and stated "Newsflash:
Cardinal hits rock bottom."
In all seriousness, I'm convinced this is as low
as Buddy Teevens' troops will go for several rea
sons.
First, Arizona, which would be a more com
petitive football team with Luke Walton under
center and Lute Olson on the sideline, is not on
the schedule this year. While this ruins a great
chance for Buddy to increase last year's win total
by 150 percent (that sounds so much better than
"by one game," doesn't it?), it also eliminates the
chance of the Cardinal losing to the Wildcats,
which would be grounds for removing the foot
ball program in the name of Title IX.
Second, the Cardinal was shutout Saturday
for the first time since a 14-0 loss to Wisconsin in
1996, a span of 83 games. Last time I checked,
you can't score negative points.
Third, it is absolutely unheard of to be given
seven straight cracks at pay dirt from the one
yard line and be stuffed every time. It wasn't ex
actly the 'B5 Bears lining up opposite the Cardi
nal. As my friend Sam said earlier this week, the
Okada intramural football team could have
punched the ball in from the one-yard line given
seven chances.
Make no mistake, this year's team is probably
better than last year's and the Cardinal's journey
to rock bottom this season has not come without
its fair share of positives, including a few to be
found in Eugene, Ore.
While the defense gave up 193 rushing yards,
the offense moved the ball well (326 total yards)
despite not finding the endzone. True freshman
Mark Bradford had a coming out party (153
yards receiving) albeit against the worst pass de
fense in the conference. Looking for one more
positive? The game wasn't televised.
When you've hit rock bottom, playing the
blame game and pointing fingers is pointless.
Sure, I could rip the offensive line, the defense
and the play calling, but no team reaches rock
bottom as the result of a single unit, player or
coach.
So where does Stanford go from here? The log
ical answer is nowhere but up. a course made easi
er by the fact that four of the Cardinal's final five
games are in the friendly, if half-empty, confines of
Stanford Stadium. That's where you come in.
When you're making plans this Saturday,
think of the last time you hit rock bottom and
get out and support the Cardinal against
UCLA. Look at it this way: Things can't possi
bly get any worse.
Right?
