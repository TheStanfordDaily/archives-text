# Cardinal to face Wildcats
## 
### KIM ROBERTS STAFF WRITER 
On the season, the Stanford
women's volleyball team has only lost
five matches. However, three of those
five losses have come in the team's last
six matches, as the Cardinal has lost
one match in each of its last three
weekends of play.
This weekend, the No. 9 Cardinal
(15-5, 8-3 Pacific-10) has an opportuni
ty to go two-for-two, as Arizona and
Arizona State come to the Farm for
matches on Thursday and Friday, re
spectively.
Without a doubt, the Pac-10 has es
tablished itself as a force to be reck
oned with this season. In the latest
USA Today / AVCA Division I
Coaches Top-25 Poll, five Pac-10 teams
are in the nation's top 10, claiming the
No. 1, No. 6, No. 8, No. 9 and No. 10 po
sitions. While the Arizona schools are
not going to be effortless matches for
the Cardinal, this marks the first week
end since the last time these teams met
that Stanford has not faced one of the
conference's ranked teams.
"The Pac-10 is incredibly strong this
year," said junior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani. "Every team is
strong and anything can happen against
anyone. We have to be prepared for ev
eryone and focus on coming out strong
from the beginning of the match."
At 7 p.m. tonight, the Cardinal will
host Arizona (10-11,4-6), which is com
ing off a convincing win against cross
state rival Arizona Stat. However, the
Wildcats have struggled in its last 10
matches, winning four and dropping six
and the team is only 2-7 against ranked
opponents on the season. Entering the
year, the Wildcats were ranked No. 10
in the nation, but have since fallen out
of the top 25.

Overall, Stanford has dominated
Arizona, running up a 42-4 all-time
record.
When the teams met earlier this
season in Tucson, Ariz., the Cardinal
was again victorious. However, Stan
ford did not start off strong, falling in
the first game, only notching nine kills
with six hitting errors for a .107 hitting
percentage, as opposed to Arizona's 19
kills and .364 hitting percentage. The
Cardinal rebounded quickly and
turned the match around, hitting .375
in game two, .484 in game three and
.469 in game four.
For the game, Stanford outblocked
Arizona 11-3, led by five blocks from se
nior Jennifer Harvey and posted 22 fewer
hitting errors than Arizona (12-34).
Tonight the Wildcats will be looking
to sophomore outside hitter Kim Glass,
who is on the verge of a 1,000 kills ca
reer mark. Glass set an Arizona hitting
record with 556 kills in her freshman
season and already has 428 kills this
season, averaging 5.56 kills per game.
Glass needs just 16 kills to reach the
impressive milestone and become the
only sophomore in Arizona history to
reach the mark.

that is 3-7 in its last 10 matches, includ
ing its loss to Arizona last weekend.
Overall, the Cardinal holds a 43-4
all-time series lead over the Sun Devils
and the first time Stanford met Arizona
State this year in Tempe, Ariz., Stan
ford cruised to an easy victory, winning
three straight games 30-24, 30-22 and
30-22. In the match, the Cardinal outhit
the Sun Devils .302 to .120 and out
blocked them 15-4.
