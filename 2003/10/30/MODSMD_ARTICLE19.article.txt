# L.A. fires may put out race
## Team continues to prepare for regatta amid uncertainty

"We must protect our house."
This is the motto that the men's
varsity crew team adheres to.
"[lt] extends to all facets of our
persona .. . whether academics or
athletics we will represent," said
Stanford coach Craig Amerkhani
an.
The men's varsity eight crew
team, made up primarily of sopho
mores and juniors, is entirely com
prised of walk-on student-athletes.
As a result, the team "is filled with
[future] engineers and doctors,"
said Amerkhanian.
Amerkhanian attributes his
team's success to a character that is
"efficient effort-based."
"They do not waste time and
expect dynamic and passionate
work from one another," he
added.
The men's varsity eight hopes
to put their hard work to the test at
Sunday's Newport Fall Regatta.
But the race might not happen at
all this weekend because of poor
air equality in Southern California
after the fires. Officials will decide
today if the races will be held.
Last year, the Cardinal fin
ished five seconds behind Califor
nia's varsity eight team.
"Our primary goal is for our
two varsity boats to place one and
two in the Men's Open Eight
event," said senior Shane Ander
son.

The team also hopes to build
on last weekend's successes at the
Head of the American and Head of
the Estuary regattas.
At the Head of the American,
the men's team defended its varsi
ty eight title with a 17-second mar
gin of victory over UC-Davis.
"It was a powerful piece, but
we still have room to improve our
technique," said junior coxswain
Zack Cooper. "We showed that we
have the ability to be fast, but the
intensity of our training over the
next few months will determine
how we perform in the spring."
Last Sunday, the team raced at
the Head of the Estuary regatta for
the first time, where it placed first
and second in the Men's Open 4,
the only event the Cardinal en
tered. The first-place finish se
cured Stanford the Matt Franich
Award, given in honor of the Cali
fornia rower, by the same name,
who distinguished himself as a tail
gunner in World War 11.
"The varsity men who raced on
Sunday had a fine race,"
Amerkhanian said. "They per
formed at a level that exceeded all
other entries."
Such a diligent work ethic sug
gests a successful spring season for
the team.
"I think that we are more fo
cused on our goals and pushing
harder in the fall to achieve the re
sults we want in the spring," Coop
er said. "We know that we have to
train everyday with the same in
tensity that we expect from our
races."
"Each afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
on the ergometers in the Ford Cen
ter . . . the advantage is estab
lished," Amerkhanian added.

Fall Regatta. The status of the regatta is up in the air as a result of the raging fires in Southern California.
