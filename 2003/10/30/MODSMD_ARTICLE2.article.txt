# Bill could bar Stanford from NCAA
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
If a bill passed by the California Senate in May is sworn
into law this January, Stanford which has won eight
consecutive Sears Directors' Cups for being the best
NCAA athletic program in the country could be
kicked out of the NCAA, the organizing body under
which all of America's major college sports teams operate.
If passed, the bill would make Stanford ineligible to com
pete in almost all of its current postseason activities: football
bowl games, the "March Madness" college basketball cham
pionships, the College World Series and all other NCAA
sponsored championships. Regular-season play in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference which has four teams in California and
six elsewhere might also become a thing of the past.
The bill in question, called "the student-athlete's bill of
rights," was introduced by state Sen. Kevin Murray (D-
Culver City) and Sen. President pro tem John Burton (D-
San Francisco) and aims to better compensate college ath
letes for their work and the millions of dollars of rev
enue they bring in for their schools.
But NCAA President Myles Brand says the legislation
which will be reviewed by the California Assembly's
higher education committee when session resumes in Jan
uary is unrealistic and will make it legally impossible
for California colleges to operate under NCAA rules.
The bill, which would allow college athletes to make
money and hire agents, "will only isolate California col
leges and universities from championships," Brand told
the Associated Press. "It would be a significant loss both
for the state and the NCAA if California schools were not
a part of it."
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland agreed.
"Murray's heart is right, [but] I just don't like his pro
posal. What he's suggesting scares the heck out of me," he
told the AP.
The NCAA distributed $4O million to California col
leges in 2002. The bill's proponents say more of that
money should have trickled down to the athletes respon
sible for generating it.
Murray says he does not want California schools to
leave the NCAA but believes that the NCAA should re
form its policies if the bill becomes state law.
"We have this laudable goal of amateurism, but the re

ality is the only amateurs are the students," he told the
AP.
The bill would make it illegal for California universities
to follow current NCAA regulations about athletic schol
arships and stipends, health insurance, jobs outside of
sports, agents and attorneys and transfer student-athletes.
Stanford's Cardinal Council an organization com
prised of a representative from each Stanford varsity team
favors legislation improving student-athletes' quality
of life. But according to the council's chair, Michael

Bruce, Murray's bill goes too far.
"We appreciate his efforts," Bruce said. "It's not nec
essarily the ends [that we oppose], it's the means. Many of
the student-athletes he's putting up on the auctioning
block would receive few benefits from this piece of legis
lation."
Bruce cited the NCAA's improved receptiveness to
student-athlete input in recent years as one reason that

the student-athlete's bill of rights is
unnecessary.
He said that it is often assumed
"that student-athletes' voices get
lost in the process."
"Ten years ago that was probably
true, but since then the NCAA has
set up a hierarchy of Student-Ath
lete Advisory Committees to gather
student input," Bruce continued.
The NCAA has said that some of
the complaints addressed in Mur

ray's legislation are being reviewed
or addressed.
While Stanford and other Cali
fornia schools might work out other
solutions should the bill become law,
some at Stanford doubt the possibil
ity of additional compensation for
student-athletes is worth the
tremendous upheaval it could cause.
"Even being out of the NCAA
for one year would be fairly disas
trous for Stanford student-athletes
who have come here to win national
championships," Bruce said.
