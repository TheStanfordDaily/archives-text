bing name as its upcoming event the 2003 Hooters Col
legiate Match Play Championship.
While it is unclear how great an impact the sponsor will

have on the tournament itself, which will be played from Nov.
2 through Nov. 4, the field will be so full of talent that it
shouldn't matter one bit. Invitations for the inaugural 16-team
modified double elimination tournament were based on the
2003 NCAA Championship finish, so Myrtle Beach, S.C. will
be the host to most of the nation's top golfers next week.
The Cardinal is seeded No. 14 in the tournament and will
face Pacific-10 rival No. 3 Arizona in the first round. Cali

fornia, Southern California and UCLA will all be compet
ing as well, while Duke is the top seed in match play.
Stanford will be represented by seniors Kim Kouwabun
pat and Angela Rho, junior Wendra Liang, sophomore
Kelly Husted and a pair of freshmen, Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana and Lauren Todd.
So far this season, Stanford
has finished in sixth place at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational
and thirteenth at the Stanford
Pepsi Invitational.

Stanford sailing whisks off to a
quick start

Senior Ashley Frush took
home first place at the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Sailing As
sociation's Women's Single
handed Championship on Oct.
27, guaranteeing her a berth in the
ISCA Nationals later this month.
Senior Liz Shearer and
sophomore Liz Rountree also
sailed well, finishing fifth and
eighth for the Cardinal, respec
tively. The coed team has risen
to a No. 3 national ranking, while
the women's team is now ranked
No. 8 by the Sailing World.
At the ISCA Nationals,
Frush will be joined by sopho
more teammate Brian Haines,
as both will be making their sec
ond appearances in the presti
gious event.
However, the women's team
will get a chance to build on its
recent successes before the na
tionals, as it will compete in the
Women's Fall PCC's, held at
UC-Santa Barbara on Nov. 1.
The scores of both the A and
B divisions will count in the Fall
PCC's, which will be sailed in
double-handed FJ's.
