legiate Match Play Championship.
While it is unclear how great an impact the sponsor will

have on the tournament itself, which will be played from Nov.
2 through Nov. 4, the field will be so full of talent that it
shouldn't matter one bit. Invitations for the inaugural 16-team
modified double elimination tournament were based on the
2003 NCAA Championship finish, so Myrtle Beach, S.C. will
be the host to most of the nation's top golfers next week.
The Cardinal is seeded No. 14 in the tournament and will
face Pacific-10 rival No. 3 Arizona in the first round. Cali

fornia, Southern California and UCLA will all be compet

Stanford will be represented by seniors Kim Kouwabun
pat and Angela Rho, junior Wendra Liang, sophomore
Kelly Husted and a pair of freshmen, Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana and Lauren Todd.
