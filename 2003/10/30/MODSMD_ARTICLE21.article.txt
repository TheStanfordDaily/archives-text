# Fires affect SoCal sports

### GILBERT QUINONEZ DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES â€”For
once, Tobias Clemens didn't want to play
a tennis match.
The All-American could have earned
an automatic bid to the ITA Nationals
with a win Sunday, but that was less im
portant to him than his health.
His regional championship match
against USC's Ruben Torres was sup
posed to take place in Carson, Calif., at the
Home Depot Center.
The air in the area, however, was filled
with ash and smoke from nearby South
ern California wildfires the same fires
that have burned more than 1,100 homes
and 400,000 acres.
"I said right when I got there that I
wasn't going to play," Clemens said. "It
was like standing next to a grill. When the
ball bounced, ashes came up in the air."
Instead, Clemens, Torres and UCLA
coach Billy Martin consulted with Pepper
dine coach Peter Smith to have the match
at the Pepperdine campus, where the con
ditions were much friendlier for sports.
"Pepperdine was pretty far away. I
wasn't serious when I suggested it," said
Clemens, who won the regional champi
onship match. "But the coaches made it
happen. I'm glad we went there. I
would've rather defaulted than played at
the Home Depot Center."
More intense fires in San Diego caused
events to be moved even farther away or
canceled altogether.
The Monday Night Football game be
tween the Miami Dolphins and the San
Diego Chargers, for example, had to be
moved from San Diego to Tempe, Ariz.
"I just can't see us turning around and

going to our stadium and playing foot
ball," Charger general manager A.J.
Smith told The Associated Press.
"There's too much devastation going on
for that. Too much."
For college sports, a move to another
state wasn't possible logistically or finan
cially.
The ITA Women's Regional Champi
onship matches were supposed to take
place in San Diego on Monday but were
canceled.
"The courts were more reminiscent of
a war zone than a place to play tennis,"
ITA West Regional committee member
and San Diego State women's tennis
coach Peter Mattera said.
No sites were found by Mattera or any
one else that were suitable for tennis.
"The decision to cancel the tourna
ment was very easy," Mattera said. "The
hard part was to figure out who should ad
vance to the ITA nationals."
Ultimately, the ITA determined that
the two highest-seeded remaining singles
players (UCLA sophomore Jackie Car
leton and USC's Luana Magnani) and re
maining highest-seeded doubles team
(Carleton and senior Lauren Fisher)
would go to nationals.
This decision was made in large part to
make sure the student-athletes missed as
little class as possible. In other sports, this
accommodation was not as easily made.
The fires have even affected games as
far away as the Bay Area.
After the UCLA men's soccer team's win
at Cal on Sunday, the team learned its
flight back to Los Angeles was canceled.
The team rented some vans and drove
back to Westwood, arriving around mid
night.
"It was a real road trip," UCLA coach

Tom Fitzgerald said. "The fact that we got
to go home is great. We might have stayed
for a flight the next morning, but a lot of
our players had exams."
The UCLA women's soccer team's
game against Arizona on Sunday was
delayed 30 minutes while the teams
waited for the third official to show up,
as he couldn't fly into Southern Califor
nia.
"It wasn't a major inconvenience,"
UCLA coach Jill Ellis said. "With two of
ficials there's more of a likelihood of miss
ing offsides calls. Both coaches agreed to
play with two officials before the game."
UCLA's second goal came off of a
penalty kick, causing Ellis to fear that the
Arizona coach might appeal if the Bruins
only won by one goal.
"I told my team that we really need to
put it away in the second half," Ellis said.
The Air Force men's soccer team was
supposed to play at San Diego State on
Sunday, but because of the conditions, the
game was postponed until Monday.
But the game was postponed indefi
nitely, and Air Force had to fly back Mon
day night rather than Sunday evening.
"It's a lot like the Sept. 11 tragedy,"
said Troy Garnhart, Air Force's assistant
athletic director. "There were circum
stances beyond our control. We didn't
have too many options. The coaches de
cided to cut our losses and head back."
Tuesday's UCLA women's volleyball
match at Cal State-Northridge will go on
as scheduled, as the nearest fires to
Northridge are 10 miles away.
No other collegiate sporting events
have been canceled for this week.
The UCLA men's volleyball team's flight
back to Los Angeles on Saturday night
from Calgary was not canceled.
