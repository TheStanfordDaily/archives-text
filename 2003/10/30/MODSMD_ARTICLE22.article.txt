# Nanci Howe explains what matters to her

Yesterday afternoon, Assistant Dean and
Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe
reflected in Memorial Church upon the val
ues, beliefs and experiences that influence
her decision-making as a part of the "What
Matters to Me and Why" lecture series.
Howe recounted her early years grow
ing up in New Jersey, and then moved on
to describe her education. According to
Howe, her earlier years were marked by a
love for the creative art process, an inter
est in other cultures and a strong sense of
feminism. She said her family always
stressed a commitment to education and
that she followed through with this by
studying art education at the University of
Delaware. She also described her early
professional career, where her employ
ment ranged from working at Vassar Col
lege to a brief stint typing contracts at a
fire alarm business.
Howe originally came to Stanford to take
a marketing job and remained with the Uni
versity for 22 years. In her current position,
she interacts with about 600 student groups
and Greek organizations on campus. She
often serves as the key facilitator between
student leaders and the University.
"There must be something in my blood to
plan events, to be creative and to work in col
laboration with others," she said. She added
that her job gives her the ability to use her

creative outlet with other people and brings
her "the incredible joy, challenge and plea
sure of working with students."
The challenges, however, often include
making decisions that make her unpopular
with the student body.
"It's hard sometimes to think about doing
the right thing," she said. "Undergrads think
of issues as polar, where it's either this or
that. I'm usually in the gray. I have a respon
sibility to pose questions to students to make
them think through complicated issues and
think outside of their personal experience."
Howe mentioned Full Moon on the Quad
and the negative response she received after
she proposed eliminating the event due to
safety concerns. She noted in particular a
poll question that appeared in an issue of
The Stanford Daily that asked readers
whether they would vote her off first in an
episode of the television show "Survivor."
"I could have done without that, though
I'm sure it was in jest," she said. "We judge
our success in student affairs by how much
we can stay out of the press."
"Some people can't separate the issue
from you as a person," she added.
Howe stressed that she is a facilitator and
said that it is important to her to create a di
alogue between students.
"I love the challenge students give me,
both when they disagree with me and when
they agree with me," she said. "I'm so thank
ful that I left New Jersey.
