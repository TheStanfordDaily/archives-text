# Tufts boasts multi-majors

Tufts University is a leader in the
recent trend towards undergradu
ates pursuing multiple majors, an
issue that is becoming increasingly
contentious and leading universities
to debate where to draw the line.
Universities are concerned that
students with multiple majors may
not be getting the well-rounded ed
ucation that liberal arts schools
seek to provide.
According to Todd Quinto, the
chairman of the Tufts Educational
Policy Committee, it is more im
portant for students to have an in
depth understanding of one sub
ject area than a cursory under
standing of many.
"If people take two majors they
may be missing out on fully develop
ing one or the other major," he said.
"The big concern is that [students]
have depth in the major and breadth
in their overall curriculum."
An Oct. 24 article in the Chron
icle of Higher Education discussed
the issue and noted Tufts' high per
centage of multiple majors. With
one in four graduates completing
more than one major last year,
Tufts sits near the top of the list.
Although the Chronicle article
claimed that Tufts was considering
a ban on triple majors, according to

Quinto, this is not true.
Other universities are having
similar debates. According to the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology's Office of Undergraduate
Education, 15 percent of their stu
dents currently double major.
However, MIT banned triple ma
jors in 2002, after the faculty decid
ed that students pursuing triple
majors were missing out on other
important aspects of college life.
Regardless, many students at
Tufts pursue multiple majors.
Much of the debate centers on
whether or not multiple majors
make graduates more competitive
in the job market.
A double major by no means
guarantees employment, said
Jean Papalia, Director of Tufts
Career Services.
"I'd like to correct an impres
sion that a student's major or num
ber of majors defines success in the
job search process and/or ultimate
ly in the workplace," Papalia said.
"A liberal arts degree from a rigor
ous curriculum such as ours at
Tufts equips a student for success
in a wide variety of industries, or
ganizations, and positions."
However, students often seem
to find that two majors compliment
each other.
"Of course sometimes multiple
majors compliment each other, such
as math and economics,'' Quinto said.
