## Textbooks cheaper overseas 
### KOUSTUBH PATWARDHAN Michigan Daily 
He added that sometimes the
books sold abroad sport a plain
cover instead of a colorful one and
contains pages printed in black and
white instead of in color.
Textbook costs here are also
higher because the faculty often
recommends that students use
newer, more expensive editions in
stead of reusing old versions,
Brown said. He blamed the text
book companies for having a dou
ble standard.
More recently, rising costs of col
lege tuition and textbooks have

been a huge concern for many
politicians. Recent statistics show
that one in five students cannot af
ford to buy required college text
books.
There have been various at
tempts at tackling the increasing
costs of textbooks. In 2002, then-
Michigan State Sen. Leon Stille (R-
Spring Lake) tried unsuccessfully to
abolish sales taxes on textbooks.
Last week, U.S. Sen. Charles
Schumer (D-N.Y.) proposed legis
lation that would make $l,OOO of a
student's textbook costs tax de
ductible each year.
Schumer said in a written state
ment he hoped that by making this
deductible, students would be able
to buy the required textbooks.
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. Just as
senior citizens have saved money by buying pre
scription drugs from outside the United States, a
bare necessity of college students' lives is also
cheaper when imported. American-made text
books cost less when ordered from overseas, ac
cording to price comparisons on the Internet.
U.S. publishers are selling many college text
books in countries such as France and the Unit
ed Kingdom for little more than half the price.
The practice has been occurring for years, but
with the advent of the Internet, more and more
Americans have been able to gain access to the
cheaper books.
Mark Brown, textbook manager at Michigan
Book & Supply near the University of Michigan,
said price disparities exist because students in
other countries cannot afford to pay higher
prices. He cited marketing ploys and differences
in printing costs as other reasons for the price
differentials between countries.

While publishers argue that American stu
dents should not be able to buy their books for
less money abroad, The New York Times re
ported a 1998 Supreme Court ruling paved the
way for the re-importation of American goods
sold cheaply. Before this ruling, Americans
could not import products without violating
copyright laws.
Prices of books on foreign bookstores' Web
sites are much lower than they are in the U.S. For
example, "Fundamentals Of Physics" is listed
for $9O on amazon.co.uk while the same book
sells for $133 on amazon.com.
In addition to buying books from the Inter
net, some university students say they choose to
buy their textbooks from bookstores in Asian
countries such as India and Singapore.
University of Michigan engineering freshman
Dinkar Jain said while he understands why text
book companies charge more domestically, they
should drop those prices and "give up their ex
tensive profit margins, especially on course
packs."
"The University [of Michigan] should set up

bookstores so that products are sold at cost,"
Jain said. "Cheaper textbooks will help students
financially and thus reduce the amount of aid the
university has to provide for students,"
But UM freshman Megan Smith said students
should not buy abroad. "Supporting the text
book company is in good spirits of corporate
America, and it's worth paying the extra $lO for
textbooks."
Managers at campus bookstores do not see
overseas sales as impacting their business great

Steven Smith, textbook purchasing manager
at Shaman Drum Bookshop in Ann Arbor,

differences in prices."
He said publishers dictate prices and the
bookstores themselves are not responsible for
keeping prices high.

the prices and added that profit margins are very
low on textbooks.
