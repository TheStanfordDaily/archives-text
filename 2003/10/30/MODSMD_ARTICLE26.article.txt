## Textbooks cheaper overseas 
### KOUSTUBH PATWARDHAN Michigan Daily 
He added that sometimes the
books sold abroad sport a plain
cover instead of a colorful one and
contains pages printed in black and
white instead of in color.
Textbook costs here are also
higher because the faculty often
recommends that students use
newer, more expensive editions in
stead of reusing old versions,
Brown said. He blamed the text
book companies for having a dou
ble standard.
More recently, rising costs of col
lege tuition and textbooks have

been a huge concern for many
politicians. Recent statistics show
that one in five students cannot af
ford to buy required college text
books.
There have been various at
tempts at tackling the increasing
costs of textbooks. In 2002, then-
Michigan State Sen. Leon Stille (R-
Spring Lake) tried unsuccessfully to
abolish sales taxes on textbooks.
Last week, U.S. Sen. Charles
Schumer (D-N.Y.) proposed legis
lation that would make $l,OOO of a
student's textbook costs tax de
ductible each year.
Schumer said in a written state
ment he hoped that by making this
deductible, students would be able
to buy the required textbooks.
