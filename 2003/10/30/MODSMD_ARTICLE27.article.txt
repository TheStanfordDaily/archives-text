After students have completed the year-long Green
Corps training program, Green Corps then helps them to se
cure a position with a prominent environmental group.
Eighty percent of Green Corps graduates now have leader
ship positions in top environmental organizations.
Green Corps placed Neumann at her current job with
Toxics Action, an environmental organization that helps res
idents of dangerously polluted areas wage to protect their
health and safety.
Neumann recommended Green Corps as "one of the
greatest programs out there." Green Corps graduate
Amy Leery, another organizer at Toxics Actions, also com
mended Green Corps.
"My English major didn't fit with the work that I wanted
to do ... how do you get your foot in the door for environ
mental activities?" Leery said. "This is the way to go you
get experience, training in multiple areas of the non-profit
world and an average salary for a recent college graduate."
Although her experience was mainly positive, Neumann
did criticize the program's size. "It's not big enough," she
said. "We need more people. The more people, the more you
can make a difference."
College graduates can apply to Green Corps at Green
Corps.org. for one of 35 available positions. Green Corps re
fuses both government and corporate funding. Members and
partner groups such as the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and Pub
he Citizen subsidize Green Corps. Green Corps workers are
fully compensated, including a salary of $19,500, two weeks
of paid vacation and sick leave. Green Corps also offers a
need-based student loan repayment program. This program
allows Green Corps to add a $lOO stipend to loan payments
made by the student borrower.
"Green Corps is designed to help launch your career. It is
the first step to providing services for a long-term career,"
Neumann said.
(U-WIRE) Not sure what to do after gradu
ation? Neither was Tufts University graduate Jo
hanna Neumann, the current field organizer for the
Boston division of Toxics Action. A biology and
environmental studies double major, Neumann
did not want to begin graduate school immediate
ly, but desired a positive and challenging project
after earning her degree.
Over Sunday morning brunch, a friend gave
Neumann advice that would shape her career. The
friend recommended that Neumann join Green
Corps, calling it "by far the best program that you
could possibly do."
A field school for environmental engineering,
Green Corps was founded in 1992 in Boston by en
vironmental activists Lois Gibbs, David Brower
and Cesar Chavez. The three organized Green
Corps with the hope of uniting skilled people and
training them to bring about social and environ
mental change. The program is designed to yield

the next generation of environmental leaders. Al
though Green Corps is based in Boston, organizers
travel the country initiating campaigns and recruit
ing. Green Corps has just begun to recruit for the
coming year.
Neumann took her friend's advice, applied to
Green Corps and was accepted. She participated in
the year-long training session, which consists of
both classroom training learning how to run
press conferences and campaigns and field
work running campaigns around the coun
try.
In 2002, the year that the U.S. Senate would
reevaluate its energy policy, Neumann coordinat
ed a campaign to protect the National Wildlife
Refuge. The last pristine wilderness in the United
States, the refuge contains enough oil to power the
country for about six months. In an effort to per
suade Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas to
protect the refuge, Neumann held press confer
ences with farmers and hunters, met with Lincoln's
staff and convinced hundreds of people to send let
ters and postcards to the Senator. Her hard work

paid off: Lincoln was the 51st senator to commit to
protecting the refuge.
Neumann speaks of her Green Corps experi
ence with animated enthusiasm: "It was a very
powerful experience. It convinced me of the power
of the work that Green Corps teaches. I believe
that grassroots organizing is the best way to change
the world, and Green Corps teaches those positive
skills."
During her time with Green Corps, Neumann
traveled from Boston to San Francisco, Washing
ton, D.C., Denver, Little Rock and New Orleans.
According to Neumann, Green Corps changes the
world by starting with activism in the United States.
"Even though Green Corps operates on only
the national scale, the United States is responsible
for the majority of environmental problems that
we see in the world such as greenhouse gasses, and
pollution by corporations," she said. "Therefore,
change in the U.S. will make change on a global
