After students have completed the year-long Green
Corps training program, Green Corps then helps them to se
cure a position with a prominent environmental group.
Eighty percent of Green Corps graduates now have leader
ship positions in top environmental organizations.
Green Corps placed Neumann at her current job with
Toxics Action, an environmental organization that helps res
idents of dangerously polluted areas wage to protect their
health and safety.
Neumann recommended Green Corps as "one of the
greatest programs out there." Green Corps graduate
Amy Leery, another organizer at Toxics Actions, also com
mended Green Corps.
"My English major didn't fit with the work that I wanted
to do ... how do you get your foot in the door for environ
mental activities?" Leery said. "This is the way to go you
get experience, training in multiple areas of the non-profit
world and an average salary for a recent college graduate."
Although her experience was mainly positive, Neumann
did criticize the program's size. "It's not big enough," she
said. "We need more people. The more people, the more you
can make a difference."
College graduates can apply to Green Corps at Green
Corps.org. for one of 35 available positions. Green Corps re
fuses both government and corporate funding. Members and
partner groups such as the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and Pub
he Citizen subsidize Green Corps. Green Corps workers are
fully compensated, including a salary of $19,500, two weeks
of paid vacation and sick leave. Green Corps also offers a
need-based student loan repayment program. This program
allows Green Corps to add a $lOO stipend to loan payments
made by the student borrower.
"Green Corps is designed to help launch your career. It is
the first step to providing services for a long-term career,"
Neumann said.
