sions decisions.
"If the justification for their ad
mission was on file, this wouldn't be
a problem," Viswanthan said. "If
students are admitted with low
scores, the university should note
why. ... The data can be misinter

Comprehensive review has been
used at most of the UC schools for
the last two years.
"Every student that has been ad
mitted to every UC campus that
does not accept all eligible appli
cants ... over the last two years has
been admitted using comprehen
sive," Murray said.
Murray also said he personally
supports using comprehensive re

"I can't emphasize enough that
making decisions about who to
admit solely based on SAT scores
would be a terrible mistake," he
said. "Students are people, not
numbers, and deserve to be treated
as such."
