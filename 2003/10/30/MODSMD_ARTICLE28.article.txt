"We expected questions like this
to be raised and answered with sta
tistics," he explained.
He said that Berkeley should
have been better prepared to an
swer questions about their admis
sions decisions.
"If the justification for their ad
mission was on file, this wouldn't be
a problem," Viswanthan said. "If
students are admitted with low
scores, the university should note
why. ... The data can be misinter

preted if people are not careful."
Comprehensive review has been
used at most of the UC schools for
the last two years.
"Every student that has been ad
mitted to every UC campus that
does not accept all eligible appli
cants ... over the last two years has
been admitted using comprehen
sive," Murray said.
Murray also said he personally
supports using comprehensive re
view in UC admissions.
"I can't emphasize enough that
making decisions about who to
admit solely based on SAT scores
would be a terrible mistake," he
said. "Students are people, not
numbers, and deserve to be treated
as such."

As many University of California
at Los Angeles students have
learned the hard way. the UC sys
tem's admissions are based on
more than just numbers.
With the policy of comprehen
sive review, applicants are judged
by their overall application, not
just their test scores and grade
point averages.
In particular the admissions
process additionally looks at
"personal achievements" or
extra-curricular activities and
any "unusual circumstances or
hardships" the applicant has
faced, according to the Universi
ty of California at Berkeley ad
missions Web site.
In implementing comprehen
sive review, the UC system
hoped to change the examination
system and reduce the emphasis
on exams themselves, explained
Chand Viswanathan, professor
of electrical engineering at
UCLA. Viswanathan was chair
man of the Academic Senate
when the decision to use compre
hensive review was passed.
"My role was to ensure that
the academic council passed the
policy," he said.
He was also the one to speak
to the regents about the policy.
"[The policy was implement
ed] because several students
were not skilled at taking stan
dardized exams," Viswanathan
said. "They were very intelligent,
but that was not reflected."
He added that the frequent
use of study sessions and
preparatory classes for the SAT
also played a role in UCLA's de

cision. Scores for students who
had taken a class or studied ex
cessively no longer reflected nat
ural ability the SAT's original
intent.
Overall, Viswanathan said,
when using comprehensive re
view, applicants are judged on
whether they did the best they
could under their particular cir
cumstances.
Though some people say com
prehensive review is taking the
place of affirmative action as a
way to admit minority students,
Viswanathan said this is not the
case.
"Academics are still the pri
mary focus," he said, "and admis
sions officials are very careful not
to lower the standards."
In order to maintain the cur
rent academic standards, appli
cants must first be UC eligible be
fore they can be admitted on
other factors.
"To be admitted to any UC
campus, you need to be eligible,
which means you must be in the
top 12.5 percent of the state's
graduating class based solely on
SAT, SAT lis, and GPA," said
student regent Matt Murray.
"Comprehensive review only ap
plies to competitive admissions
to campuses that can't accept all
eligible applicants."
Upon implementing the poli
cy, Viswanathan said UC officials
did not expect admissions to un
dergo much of a change.
Despite recent reports from
UC campuses showing that stu
dents with low SAT scores were
accepted and some with high
scores were rejected,
Viswanathan said he believes the
