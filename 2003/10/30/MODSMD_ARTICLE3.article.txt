# GSC passes measure to support FAIR
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council passed a bill last night to
support the recent efforts of several law students urging the
University to join the Forum for Academic and Institution
al Fights (FAIR) in its national lawsuit against the Depart
ment of Defense.
The lawsuit revolves around the recent reinterpretation
of the Solomon Amendment, a piece of legislation that now
threatens to deny entire universities funding if any of their
schools do not offer the U.S. military full and equal access to
on-campus recruiting opportunities.
Hosting recruiters from the military, an employer
that takes into account applicants' sexual orientation,
would contradict the school's nondiscrimination policy,
according to Jen Labrocca, a law student who co-au
thored the bill.
To date, Stanford has neither received a letter of non
compliance nor been denied funding.
However, Labrocca pointed out that the Law School has
already had to compromise its ideals.
Last year, the University's Career Development Center,
rather than the Law School, hosted interviews for law stu
dents seeking positions as judge advocate generals.
Petitions continue to circulate among graduate and un

dergraduate students alike, asking University President
John Hennessy's administration to allow Stanford to be
come an anonymous member of FAIR.
Alternatively, the petitioners ask that Law School facul
ty be allowed to join FAIR as an unincorporated association
in the case.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate lent its support to the
law students' effort at a recent meeting, following Law
School organizations like Outlaw and the American Consti
tution Society.
At the Oct. 14 Senate meeting, Labrocca and three other
law students first submitted their bill, titled "In Support of
Stanford University Joining FAIR."
Labrocca was impressed by the debate that preceded the
Senate's decision.
"They asked the University for its stance on the issue,
and after the University's response, the Senate still voted
unanimously in support of the bill," she said.
The Graduate Student Council, which currently lacks a
representative from the Law School, offered a slightly dif
ferent forum for discussion on the Solomon Amendment.
GSC Representative Moriah Thomason reminded those
present at the meeting that the council's objective need not
be to campaign for the cause, but rather, to simply provide
an endorsement of existing activism in the Law School.
As the graduate branch of the ASSU, the GSC, in pass

ing the bill, will complement the undergraduate letter of
support, to be sent to the administration by the end of this
week, according to Alyssa Schwartz, advocacy chair for the
senate.
"The bills, and subsequent letters, will reinforce each
other, and will present a unified ASSU front on this issue,"
she said.
Some students are skeptical that the GSC's support will
make a difference. Amit Ganguli, a graduate student in me
chanical engineering, observed that students in the Law
School don't have much to gain from last night's vote.
"[Law students have seemed] uninterested in sending
representatives to the GSC, which, to me, seems to indicate
they think of the GSC as being irrelevant," he said.
Nonetheless, graduate students across campus could be
a vital source of support for the law students' cause, as the
students who have the most to lose if the Solomon Amend
ment threatens to deny Stanford funding, Schwartz pointed
out.
"It is extremely important that they are aware of the con
sequences of the Solomon Amendment," she said. "Having
a letter sent to the administration by the GSC, as a result of
a bill, reinforces student support as a whole for this issue."
Labrocca conceded that the University has not denied
faculty members from joining the suit
independently, but she laments that
without the "imprimatur of Stanford
University," professors will not be
able to join FAIR and will therefore
be limited in their capacities as indi
vidual plaintiffs.
University General Counsel
Debra Zumwalt confirmed that the
Stanford will not join FAIR, despite
recent declarations of support from

student groups.
"We have already assumed that
the law students and other students
would generally be in favor of the suit
and Stanford joining the suit," she
said, suggesting that the recent bill of
support passed in both the Senate and
the GSC will have a nominal impact
on the administration.
According to Schwartz, the
anonymity of FAIR suggests even if
students' efforts were successful in
getting the University involved, the
decision would not be released to the
public. She added that the advocates
of the cause plan to simply continue

circulating petitions until a predeter
mined date.
Luke Barefoot, one of the bill's
authors, praised the courage of New
York University, whose dean openly
announced its membership in FAIR
this month. He claimed it was-"funda
mentally inequitable" for Stanford, in
comparison, "to justify its refusal to
support the suit by noting its ability to
free-ride on the efforts of others."
Brian Johnson, who also co-au
thored the bill, estimated that over
half of the law student body has ex
pressed support for the movement to
make Stanford a member of FAIR,

while no student groups have come
forward in opposition.
Schwartz observed that, given
how the threat of lost funding "inti
mately affects all students" who
share the school's ideals, the growing
support for the petitioners' cause is
reassuring.
"Even if the University never
joins the lawsuit, the student body at
least will have shown support for
Stanford Law School's non-discrimi
nation policy, and we will have in
creased awareness about this issue
among the student body," Labrocca
said.
