The Asian American Activities Center has
launched a new Vietnamese American Leader Series,
to cater to a growing Vietnamese-American student
population on campus.
This year's freshman class includes almost twice as
many Americans of Vietnamese descent than last
year's. Richard Yuen, assistant dean of students and
director of the Asian American Activities Center,
said that it is important to provide role models for this
rapidly growing ethnic group at Stanford.
"It is important to have speakers come to campus
to talk about their research, work and life experiences
to our new generation of leaders, many of whom are
now Vietnamese-American," Yuen said. "I have
worked with our staff to invite prominent individuals
in the areas of law, education and politics to come to
speak to undergraduate and graduate students on
campus."
The speaker series started last Thursday, with
Quynh Tran, Class 0f1990 and M.A. 1992. Tran, who
was an staff member as an undergraduate and
became director of the Stanford Women's Center
during her career as a graduate student, is now a real
estate attorney.
Tran said it would have been helpful for her if
there had been more ethnic speakers and role models
when she was a Stanford student.
"When I was at Stanford, there weren't a lot of
Asian American courses," she said.

Minh-hoa Ta, co-director of Vietnamese Ameri
can Studies Center and assistant professor of Asian
American Studies at San Francisco State University,
spoke yesterday as the second speaker in the series. In
her role as a professor, she advises many students ma
joring in the department.
This Tuesday, the series will host Lisa Le, chief ac
counting officer of JMPT Consulting. She has served
as a consultant to many San Francisco politicians dur
ing the last decade.
"It gives Vietnamese people a voice," said
Johnny Hwin, a freshman and an intern with the
Stanford Vietnamese Students Association. "We
are a minority among a minority here at Stanford.
With the influx of new Vietnamese students, it
shows that we are getting somewhere as a cul
ture."
Freshman Dina Howard felt the series spoke to
her own experience as an African-American.
"It's like being a first-generation college student in
your family and being put into a position where you
have the opportunity to be successful in life, but if you
don't really have someone around you, you can feel
really lost," she said.
I can relate because I'm the first person in my fam
ily to go to college," she added. "I think if I didn't have
people around in the school and African-American
groups that I have been exposed to that show, 'Hey
look, we're out here of your same culture, and we're
doing something with our fives.' It's really empower
ing to know that you're not alone."
