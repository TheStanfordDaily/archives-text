## Vinni asks: Want a lollipop? 
### 
Today we'll be going over
how to suck a lollipop.
There's a great deal you
can learn from sucking a
lollipop. It's hard, it's sweet and it
lasts longer than 60 seconds. Like
men, it doesn't really matter what
brand you pick, just make sure you
like the flavor and, most important
ly, what's inside.
First things first: Know your lol
lipop. You wouldn't pick a piece of
gum off the street and start chewing
it, so don't pick a random lollipop
off the frat party floor and start
sucking it. You simply don't know
where it's been, who else has been
sucking it, whose pocket it's been
unwrapped in and what's going to
be in the center when you get there.
Your lollipop's number one
enemy: teeth. Any scraping or
scratching, any contact with your
teeth at all, will send your lollipop
shrieking out of the room. He's very
sensitive. Wrap your lips around

your teeth in the
opposite move
ment of pursing
your lips. Make
sure your teeth
stay shielded or
you'll never get to
the center of Mr.
Lollipop.
So let the suck
ing begin. (Actu-

ally, the term sucking, and especial
ly blowing, are just figures of
speech. Be careful.) As you move
up and down the length of the lol
lipop, try this technique.
Practice right now: Shield your
teeth with your lips, put the tip of
your thumb to the tip of your point
er finger and create a tunnel with
the rest of your fingers, now place
this tunnel around your mouth,
making sure to create a gasket be
tween your hps and fingers. Add a
great deal of saliva (important!) and
that's your basic pop sucking form.
Most lollipops need the extra
stimulation of your hand to really
get to the center, but feel free to try
it with no hands or switch between
the two. The quintessential sex tip is
to communicate. Don't be afraid to
ask your lollipop if it feels good,
don't be stupid and ignore the signs
he's giving you (i.e. grunts, moans,
thrusting), and, if you're the lol
lipop, don't be a lame ass. Give
feedback. Make some noise.
So you're moving up and down
on your lollipop with your mouth
and your hand, getting into a
rhythm so he doesn't get distracted,
but what about the rest of you? Feel
free to do what you will with your
other hand, but don't let it go to
waste. Grab your lollipop's other
grabbable parts. Massage things,
grope things, stick things in places.
It's fun.
Use your tongue in swirling mo
tions around his candy head. Re
member: This is where he's most
sensitive. Lollipop deep-throaters
may brag a lot, but, while that sort of
thing can be very arousing in terms
of expressing bruit passion (essen
tial to all forms of candy fun, espe
cially sucking), the head is what's
going to get you into his candy cen
ter. So, as you're moving up from
the base of his stick, swirl your
tongue around his head and feel him
quiver.
Should you chew the center or
spit out the gum? It's a personal
choice. Don't feel obligated to do
either, at this point he won't really
care. The health risks involved in
swallowing are debatable. You
could get a disease, but the chances
aren't great. Keeping risks in mind,
what's important is to do what's
comfortable and fun for you.
So go out there and blow a few
pops, then write to me and let me
know just how many licks it took to
get to the center of his lollipop.
