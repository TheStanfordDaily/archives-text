# Tasty Treats & Fattening Sweets
## 
### ARAM HUR 
You've been staring at your computer screen for a full hour
now and zilch. While the urgency of your I-Hum paper should
be hanging over your head, your thoughts are actually clogged up
by food: chicken tenders, hot wings, quesadillas and strawberry
smoothies. You try to restrain yourself, but before you know it,
you're out of the dorm and on your way to late-night dining.
Apart from academic fervor, late-night dining is the key study
aid for many Stanford students. Two dorm-based late nights,
Stern's Cyber Cafe and Lagunita Court's Lakeside Dining Hall,
cater to students' needs in the wee hours of the morning. Though
Stern starts serving its tasty treats at 9 p.m., and the two eateries
don't close their doors until 2 a.m., they attract the largest crowds
of hungry students between 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.
"I'm actually very hungry by night time," says senior Bimal
Patel.
"I'm hungry, but it's also a good study break," says Xing Chen,
a freshman.
At both late night dining spots, the most popular treat is the
same:
"Chicken tenders," says Anthony Pereyra, head cook of Lake
side. Hot wings and quesadillas trail very close behind.
While late-night dining is a religion for some students, others
are not as passionate about chowing down before bed.
Dan Cho, a senior, says "even if I'm hungry, it's just too cum
bersome to have to walk out again at night." For students in Flo
rence Moore Hall, the problem is not one of laziness but of dis
tance. Since the dorm is located halfway between both late-night
services, students tend not to devote the effort to bike at night.

So you know deep-fried food is tasty. But is it healthy?
"I feel guilty going to bed right after I eat here," says freshman
Jenny Jin. For girls and guys who are forced to hate late-night din
ing due to diet restrictions, hate no more. A study by Fitness Mag
azine shows that eating at night will not necessarily make you fat
ter. The problem is not when you eat, but what you eat.
Weight is gained only when the calorie intake exceeds calories
spent for the day. The myth that late-night eating is fatty only ex
ists due to people's tendencies to crave fatty snacks at night. Ac
cording to Pereyra of Lakeside, chicken tenders contain approxi
mately 250 calories while quesadillas contain 450.
Considering that the average person consumes 2,000 calories a
day, those numbers aren't trivial. The deep-fried chicken tenders,
for instance, sure won't be recommended to you by a dietician.
But such numbers shouldn't daunt you from going to late night,
food officials say. The cardinal rule of daily exercise still stands: If
you exercise, it will not only help you burn off those calories from
late-night dining, but it will also boost your metabolism so that
you'll be burning calories even when you're not moving. When at
late-night dining, try to choose light, non-fried foods like juice,
sushi or fruits over the pizza, chicken and smoothies, so the extra
pounds don't add up.
Of course, apart from diet, eating at night may cause other
health problems. When food is digested, gravity helps push the
food down the intestines. Because most people go straight to
bed after late-night snacks, the body lies parallel to the
ground. When the body is in such a position, however, gravity
cannot help, and indigestion may occur. The cumulative ef
fects of indigestion may lead to high chances of heartburn and
sleep disturbance.
Despite the extra pounds late-night dining may pack on, during
the 12 years that Saul Cardenas Jr. has worked in the Cyber Cafe,
he has never failed to see people who religiously come every day.
"I see them in the line and I don't even have to ask what they
want," says Cardenas. "There's a guy who comes and always gets
a Snickers and a smoothie."
A healthy lifestyle one of adequate exercise and generally
healthy eating habits should be more than enough to maintain
your dietary health. Keeping that notion in mind, go ahead and
run away from that I-Hum paper for a while.
