November to Remember
Catch the Cardinal at Stanford Stadium, Saturdays
in November as Stanford hosts UCLA (11/1), Arizona
State (11/8), Cal (11/22) and Notre Dame (11/29).
To ensure the safety of our fans, backpacks, coolers and large bags will not be
allowed into Stanford Stadium. Small nags such as purses and diaper bags will be
subject to search before entering the stadium.
