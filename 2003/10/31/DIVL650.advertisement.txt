Dear Voter:
H Foothill and De Anza are model
community colleges with national
reputations of excellence. Th.y
won't remain that way if we fon't
have an advocate on their side. The
next few years will be a challenge
as California pulls out of recession.
I will be that advocate - a fighter
for the students, for the taxpayers and for the district.
I was honored to be appointed unanimously to the
Foothill-De Anza board in 2002, selected from a field of
21 candidates. In my 18 months on the Board, 1 led the
charge to open the governing process to the public,
generate new revenue sources, and form a partnership
with NASA-Ames to bring educational programs closer to
our students.
We have accomplished much in 18 months - hired a new
chancellor, implemented "green" building practices, and
balanced the budget while increasing faculty and staff
salaries.
There is more to do - we need to fight the State's proposed
budget cuts to community colleges, and increase partner
ships with businesses that have jobs for our graduates.
The board needs experienced leadership to pide us
through these tough times. I will be that leader. Thank
vou for vour vote on November 4th.
