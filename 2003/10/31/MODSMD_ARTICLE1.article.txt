# Castro under tight security for Halloween
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The senior class has chartered four buses to
bring 200 students to the Castro tonight and
hundreds of Stanford students will make their
own treks to San Francisco's annual Halloween
gathering in Castro, facing not only hordes of
strangely costumed urbanites but also a multi
tude of new city-imposed regulations aimed at
increasing the safety of the event.
"The Toyon eating clubs, the Row, the ju
nior class and a few Greek organizations are
chartering buses as well," said Mary
Himinkool, senior class president.
A San Francisco Chronicle article two
weeks ago listed some of the changes, which in
clude an increase in undercover and uniformed
police officers, strict enforcement of the alco
hol ban and an 8 p.m. closure of the Castro
Muni station.
"There have been safety issues in the past
from the mayhem of a crowd this large," said
Himinkool. "I'm hoping that students who do
choose to go will feel more comfortable with
these new measures in place."
Most controversial of all, the event which
in previous years was permit-free and had an
air of spontaneity will now be surrounded by
three miles of police barricades. Attendees will
have to pay $3 to enter the party area.
The party, as well, will now look more like
a county fair than a bacchanalian jubilee, at
least in terms of organization. Four stages and
over 100 performers will entertain the
crowds. Both the performances and the party
itself will end at midnight this year, as op
posed to the 2 a.m. closing time that marked
past years' celebrations.
While draconian to some, these measures
represent an increased determination to make
the event secure after five gang-related stab
bings and a host of other crimes and injuries
took place at last year's gathering, which drew
a record 300,000 attendees.
University officials are aware of the dangers
associated with the Castro's Halloween party
and enjoin students to take proper precautions.
"As far as I know, Stanford students who
have gone to the Castro to celebrate Hal
loween have not personally encountered
problems," said Nanci Howe, assistant dean of
student activities.
"The health and safety of students is a prior
ity of the University," she added. "Students
who plan to go to the Castro are encouraged to
be thoughtful about the evening and to plan
safe transportation to and from the event."
Sophomore Lauren Gong attended the
party last year and came back determined to
stay away in future years.
"I had a terrible time at the Castro last
year," Gong said. "A fight broke out next to us.
I seriously thought that if we fell down we'd get
trampled. There was just a mob of humanity
and you couldn't move anywhere except where
the mob wanted you to go."
