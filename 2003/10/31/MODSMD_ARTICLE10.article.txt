## Mausoleum Party should live again 
### 
Students have reason to fear this Hal
loween. The campus' annual party is
dead literally. For the second
consecutive year, the renowned
Mausoleum Party, which invited students
to dance on the graves of Stanford's
founders, has been scrapped due to a lack
of funding.
The Mausoleum Party was a valuable an
nual function that added to the healthy so
cial scene on campus. Stanford has an obli
gation to provide its students with a cam
pus-wide Halloween party that is both safe
and fun, and we believe this could be best
achieved through restoring the annual
Mausoleum Party.
Until last year, the Mausoleum Party
was financed by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. The Alumni Association ex
plained that it ceased paying for the party
to focus on other events that serve a broad
er portion of the University population
and place more emphasis on student-alum
ni interactions. This is understandable, as
the Alumni Association has many different
competing responsibilities. Throwing par
ties for current students should not top its
list of priorities.
However, if the Alumni Association is
no longer funding the Mausoleum Party,
the annual fete should still be resurrect
ed. The Alumni Association expressed
that it felt other University groups could
step up to fund the party in the future. So

what happened? Some students expected
the Senior Class Presidents to administer
the event. However, as the presidents are
already burdened with Full Moon on the
Quad â€”also passed off to them from the
Alumni Association the cash-strapped
Senior Class is not ready to step up and
take over another program.
But there are other potential sources of
funding for the party. As officials increase
their efforts to promote dry student gather
ings, the University needs to provide a safe
campus-based Halloween event. Why
hasn't an office like the Office of Student
Affairs stepped forward to run the Mau
soleum Party for the student body? Why
hasn't the ASSU's Absolute Fun program,
which is working to encourage alcohol-free
events with a very comfortable budget of
$50,000, adopted the party as one of its
yearly functions?
The Mausoleum Party was an impor
tant part of the Stanford social scene,
attracting as many as 1,500 students per
year. It must return in the future. If the
University is serious about enforcing its
revamped Alcohol Policy, it should pro
vide alcohol alternatives. Instead of
reinventing the wheel, officials should
take advantage of the notoriety already
achieved by the Mausoleum Party. Oth
erwise, the only thing spooky about
Halloween will be how dead it is at
Stanford.
