# Cordell a good choice for Council

U-w- -jr- ind-hearted, honest, trust-,
| f worthy, with a generous
heart and enthusiastic spir-
JL. it" is how Cathy Jenson, ad
ministration manager for the Office for Reli
gious Life, describes LaDoris Cordell.
Cordell, who graduated from the Law
School in 1974 and is currently vice provost
of campus relations, would make an excel
lent addition to the Palo Alto City Council.
When voters go to the polls next Tuesday, we
hope they will recognize the talent and dedi
cation Cordell embodies.
The vice provost is running a grassroots
campaign in her attempt to gain a seat on the
Council. She is not accepting outside dona
tions and has kept to a strict campaign bud
get of $3,000 all funded from her own
money. Her down-to-earth leadership style
and ethical compass have already increased
the respectability of the sometimes-fraught
world of local politics. And we believe that
her voice of reason on the Council would

help city politicians concentrate on broader
issues of universal import.
Cordell has a long history with the commu
nity. She is a 20-year resident of Palo Alto, and
she has said that she wants to spend the rest of
her life here. She has served on the board of
the community Working Group an organi
zation that has brought sorely needed afford
able housing to Palo Alto. At Stanford, she
was a law student until 1974. From 1978 to
1982, she served as assistant dean for student
affairs in the Law School. After nearly two
decades on the bench—both as a judge in the
Municipal Court of Santa Clara County and
as Superior Court Judge in Santa Clara Coun
ty—she returned to Stanford for her current
post as vice provost of campus relations.
Cordell has the type of experience the Palo
Alto City Council needs, and we respect her
ethics and her campaign style. She is an honest
woman who would stand up for what is right in
city politics. We hope that voters will consider
her when making their decision next week.
