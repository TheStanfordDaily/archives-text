## A 						LIGHTER PERSPECTIVE Will we ever catch the 'Serial Groper?' 
### 
If Stanford is a farm, it's a funny
farm. Can we deny that we live in
a world of utter ridiculousness?
Take the "Serial Groper," for in
stance. Stanford has educated Nobel
Prize winners, an astronaut, a president
of the United States, physics whiz kids,
world leaders in economics and philos
ophy, technological geniuses ... I
could go on forever. Yet we just can't
seem to wrap our fingers around a fat
kid on a Schwinn who grabs girls' asses.
It's only a matter of time, they assure
us. The police are working on this
around their lunch breaks at times,
not even the temptation of a sugary,
syrupy, deliriously satisfying bear claw
at Happy Donuts can make them stop
for more than 20, maybe 25 minutes.
And what of their progress? Here are
the developments:
(1) Police have amassed numer
ous physical descriptions enabling
them to generate a facial image that
has an uncanny resemblance to a cut
and-pasted version of the Un
abomber.
(2) They've triangulated the crime
scene locations to enable them to pre
dict with 24 percent accuracy where
the next goosing will occur.
(3) Perhaps most reassuring of all,
they gather new clues every time he
strikes.
This got me thinking about the ab
surdity of the situation. We know
what he looks like, we know where he

commits his crimes and he can't travel
any faster than 14 miles per hour. I'd
be willing to bet University President
John Hennessy's Barbie doll collec
tion that if the "Serial Groper" was
pedaling through Hazzard County
grabbing handfuls of Daisy Duke,
Cletus Hogg would have made an ar
rest by now.
That doesn't bother me, though. In
fact, I'll be disappointed when they bring
him in because like every other male on
campus I am hoping to catch him my
self. Let's be honest, no guy at Stanford
hasn't imagined this: You're walking
down Santa Teresa Avenue because your
friends —the Swedish Bikini team—are
in town and they invited you to run
through sprinklers with them on Roble
Field. You're coming up on alumnus
Reese Witherspoon, who's here with
Cameron Diaz to show off her alma mater,
when suddenly the "Serial Groper" bikes
up behind them and does what he does
best: He touches their bums and bolts.
But you with your cat-like reflexes
sprint up to that kid who you recognize
from the Mendicants, throw him off his
Razor Scooter with gratuitous force and
kick pavement in hot pursuit of the "Se
rial Groper." After minutes of rocket
speed, curb-jumping action, you risk it
all and hurl yourself from your scooter,
pouncing on the perpetrator in slow
motion to "Danger Zone" by Kenny
Loggins. Just then, the entire student
body gathers around you screaming

your name as you lift the villain by the
scruff of his neck, removing his shades
for all to see: (Gasp!) Ex-Dean Marc
Wais never went to New York Univer
sity after all. "Stupid kids, if it wasn't for
y0u..."
And then, the next day you make
the front page of The New York Times,
you score a million dollars for a photo
spread in Playgirl and are appointed to
"Master of the Universe" by the Dalai
Llama.
In all seriousness though, the "Seri
al Groper" attacks are no laughing
matter. True, he does about as much
harm to a victim's tush as if she sat on
a grapefruit, but there is always the un
settling potential for escalation. He
could grow tired of his rump-fetish and
move on to touching chests. This
would be physically more difficult to
perpetrate he'd have to, like, ride
backwards or do some sort of rotated
wrist cupping-action or something
but this is still a frightening thought.
And then we have to ask ourselves,
after he grows tired of uninvited nip
ple-twists, what will he do next?
It is this next step that gets to the
essence of the fear underlying this
whole "Serial Groper" crisis: He
could run for governor.
