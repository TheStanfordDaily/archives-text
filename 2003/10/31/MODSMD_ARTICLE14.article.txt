# THE 						WORLD ACCORDING TO DANIEL
## Bush needs to keep up with his work 
### 
We've all got them—those
classes you've just got to
take, but can't bear to do the
work for. You drag yourself
to the library, only to spend your time out
side flirting at Moonbeams. The procrasti
nation instinct takes over and assignments
build up at the same pace so the will to do
them withers away. It's at this time that
Langston Hughes' wonderings about "A
Dream Deferred" echo in our ears: "Does
it dry up like a raisin in the sun, or fester like
a sore?" Or does it explode? Hughes asks.
It's this last alternative that we need to
worry about.
For many, finding a resolution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a dream de
ferred. Recently, the "Quartet" com
posed of the United States, United Na
tions, European Union and Russia
created a "Road Map" for peace late last
year that inspired new hope for a solu
tion. But over the summer, America
made a concerted effort to take the lead
in this issue, shunting aside its partners.
In doing so, the United States hoped to
monopolize the rewards of peace, and
signed on for the consequences of war.
The conflict represents the most sig
nificant challenge to world peace today, as
its reach extends far beyond Israel's tiny
borders. Israel is the site of holy lands for
three major religions, America's closest
ally in the Middle East and —whether
justified or not —it has become the pari
ah of the Arab world.
Iran's building nuclear weapons? The
Arab world points to Israel and says,.
"What about them?" Syria should get out
of Lebanon? The Arab world says, "Tell
it to the Israelis occupying Palestinian
lands." Because of these externalities, the

United States can never achieve its goal
of democratization of the Middle East

without a two-state
solution to the Is
raeli-Palestinian
conflict.
Yet America
has adopted a po
tentially disastrous
laissez-faire atti
tude. Since the im
position of the
Road Map, an
ephemeral peace
has deteriorated.

Against the constant backdrop of Pales
tinian suicide attacks, Israeli revenge has
escalated in frustration while the U.S.
response remains tempered. Two exam
ples deserve special attention: the Israeli
attack on an alleged terrorist training
camp in Syria and the building of a wall
that divides Israel from Palestine and
also isolates some Palestinian lands on
the Israeli side of the wall in the name of
protecting Israeli settlements.
By attacking Syria, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon allowed the Israeli reac
tion to leak outside its borders. Regard
less of whether Syria sponsors terrorism
the CIA says it does the Israeli re
sponse threatens both Israeli and Amer
ican interests. Neither can afford allow
ing an interstate war to drown the region
in chaos. However, burdened with the
peace in Iraq, the United States has been
unwilling to offer anything more than
bland condemnations to both sides. Se
curity may be the bottom line, but Israeli
escalation and American inaction don't
increase security instead, they stir up
the hornet's nest.

The second escalation the wall
breaks cleanly from Road Map guide
lines that envision the dismantling of
outer Israeli settlements and national
borders running along what is known as
the 1967 Green Line. The wall violates
both of these requirements (although to
be fair, the Road Map also mandates an
end to Palestinian attacks, which has not
occurred), and muted U.S. objections
have failed to halt its construction
Last week, the world spoke out with a
staggering 144-4 vote in the United Na
tions condemning the wall. While the
United Nations has been historically
hostile to Israel, the world body cannot
and should not be ignored. More
than anything else, the non-binding Gen
eral Assembly resolution acts as a sym
bolic message. The world is focused on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and if the
America wishes to take a leadership role
in the Middle East, it must take heed.
Continued escalation is bad for both
America and Israel. The due date for the
dream of peace cannot be deferred
much longer. What the failing war on
terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq and Israel
has shown is that might doesn't always
make right.
Sometimes you just have to do the
work. As a Stanford senior scrambling
to get his General Education Require
ments fulfilled, I realize that the com
parison can only go so far. For the Unit
ed States, Israel and the world, unfortu
nately there is no "petition" option.
