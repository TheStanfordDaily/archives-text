## What does sustainable growth mean? 
### TERRY L. ANDERSON LAURA E. HUGGINS 
A group of academics known as the
Club of Rome put forth the "limits to
growth" theory 30 years ago, predict
ing disaster for humankind unless nat
ural resource-depleting economic and
technological progress were aban
doned. This gloom-and-doom theory
has been resurrected under the guise
of sustainable development, calling
for changes in virtually every aspect of
our consumption and production.
"Sustainability," a seductive though
vague term, argues that resource use
today should leave future generations
at least as well off as current genera
tions. Of course nobody wants to make
future generations poorer and less
healthy, but this definition provides no
guidance for how this result can be
avoided. There is no way to know what
resource use is acceptable today and no
way to know what future generations
may desire. Yet because of its deceptive
simplicity, sustainability is applied to
anything from agricultural practices to
energy use to mining.
Implicit in the calls for sustainable
development are two fundamental as
sumptions. The first is that we are run
ning out of resources, thus leaving fu
ture generations with less; the second
is that market processes are the cause

of these depletions. But in fact, sever
al studies offer evidence suggesting
the opposite.
Resources are becoming less
not more scarce. Agricultural
yie.lds for rice, corn and wheat have in
creased for decades. Known reserves
of oil, natural gas and coal have been
expanding. Accessible stocks of alu
minum, zinc, iron and copper have
grown as technology develops more
conservative production techniques.
The price mechanism encourages ex
ploration and new discoveries of un
derground reserves. Moreover, life
expectancy, housing, nutrition and ed
ucation levels are improving in both
the developed and the developing
world. In short, the prosperity we
enjoy today is leaving future genera
tions better off, not worse off.
How can this be? Sustainable de
velopment, if it can be defined as a call
to maximize human welfare, is only
possible in a legal system where prop
erty rights ensure market operability.
Property rights when well defined,
enforced and transferable provide
the structure that encourages devel
opment, innovation, conservation and
discovery of new resources. Growth,
and increasing wealth through these
methods, leads to improved environ
mental quality by raising demands for
it and by providing the wherewithal to

meet these demands. In this context,
economic growth is not the antithesis
of sustainable development; it is the
essence of it. Therefore, how we deal
with the evolution and protection of
property rights in the future will de
termine not only how free and pros
perous we are but also how much en
vironmental quality we enjoy.
Sustainable development stems
from sustainable institutions politi
cal and economic systems based on se
cure property rights and the rule of law.
Doomsayers, however, continue to
profess as they have since Thomas
Malthus that exponential economic
growth and consumption will ultimate
ly run up against resource limits. They
call for more government regulation to
stop this growth. If their calls are suc
cessful, we will have neither sustain
able growth nor sustainable improve
ments in environmental quality. It is
not resources that are too scarce but
the institutions that ensure human
freedom. Only by sustaining those in
stitutions will we be able to sustain de
velopment and advance environmental
quality only then can we have our
environmental cake and eat it too.
