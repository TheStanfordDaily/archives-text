# CARDINAL TODAY
## Questions surround football team 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Is Stanford really as bad as it played last
week?
Has the rejuvenated defense completely
lost its swagger? Is the offense really unable to
convert in the red zone?
The answer to these questions and more
should come tomorrow as the Cardinal (2-4,0-
4 Pacific 10 Conference) plays host to red-hot
UCLA (6-2,4-0) at 12:30 p.m.
The Bruins have won five of their last six
games the only exception an embarrassing
loss to No. 1 Oklahoma and, in a surprise to
many, find themselves sharing the top spot in
the conference standings with Washington
State. They have begun the conference sched
ule with four consecutive wins for the first time
in five years.
Meanwhile, how Stanford responds from
last week's blowout at Oregon will be crucial
to the Cardinal's psyche for the remainder of
the season.
In other words, Stanford's season hits a cru
cial juncture this week a potential turning
point. It can eithe'r sink from here or find a way
to regain its early-season confidence with a
win against a quality opponent.
A good place to start anew is moving on
from the 35-0 blowout in Eugene, Ore., where
Stanford was blanked for the first time in 83
games.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens is
hoping last week's game was an aberration.
"Oregon was a team looking for an identity

as well," he said. "They found it and we
didn't."
Stanford's identity at quarterback has shift
ed in the last few weeks, too. On Tuesday,
Teevens named Chris Lewis the starter for the
second straight game independent of
whether Trent Edwards would be fully recov
ered from his right shoulder injury by tomor
row.
"Chris did some positive things," Teevens
said. "His decision-making was positive [al
though] obviously there are some plays [he]
would like to have back."
Lewis finished the game 12-of-26 for 188
yards and three interceptions including one
that was returned for a touchdown and anoth
er that was picked off at Oregon's goal-line.
As a plus, however, Stanford showed a
greater willingness to throw the ball deep and
spread the field with five wide-receiver sets
something that helped boost a struggling of
fense at times last Saturday.
"We had felt the need to make bigger
plays," Teevens said. "We let the quarterback
hold the ball a little longer and push the ball
downfield."
The biggest beneficiary of that renewed
push downfield was wideout Mark Bradford,
who became the first true freshman to eclipse
the 100-yard mark since Brian Manning in
1993.
On the flip side, Luke Powell's production
has continued to slide ever since catching 12
passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns
against San Jose State. In the last five games,
Powell has only 15 receptions for 133 yards

and no touchdowns.
All this wide-open, spread-the-field stuff
may not accomplish much against UCLA. The
Bruins' secondary is first in the conference in
pass defense, second with 14 interceptions and
is led by cornerback Matt Ware, who held
Washington's Reggie Williams to (just) 105
yards in UCLA's upset of the Huskies. (Ware,
however, is currently sidelined with a high
ankle sprain and will be a game-time decision
for UCLA coach Karl Dorrell.)
Free safety Brandon Chiller is the confer
ence's leading tackier (92), and Lombardi
Award candidate and defensive end Dave Ball
leads the Pac-10 in sacks (11.5) and tackles for
loss (15.5).
Obviously, this talent on the defensive side
of the ball has added up to a very stingy group
the Bruins have allowed only seven touch
downs in four conference games.
"They allow yards very grudgingly,"
Teevens said. "They defend the run very well
and pressure the quarterback to put you in
tough situations.
"Then people have to play catch-up foot
ball, and they can pressure the quarterback
more."
That the defense has been so good has been
instrumental to UCLA's success, especially
since the Bruins rank 110 th in the NCAA in
total offense at 299.63 yards a game. Stanford,
though, hasn't been much better it is 111 th
with a 295.33 average.
So that fact, coupled with the forecast of


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily File
Senior wide receiver Luke Powell evades a Washington State defender on Oct. 18. With
fellow senior quarterback Chris Lewis, Powell hopes to turn his season around when the
Cardinal take on the Bruins at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
