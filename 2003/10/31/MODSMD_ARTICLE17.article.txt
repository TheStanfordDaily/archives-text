# Card, looks to turn the beat around
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Cardinal football team is 2-4 (0-4
Pacific 10 Conference) entering its mid
season homestand. Having lost four games
in a row in conference play, the next two
weeks will go a long way toward setting the
tone for the rest of the year.
Last October, Stanford scratched out a
painful 16-6 win over Arizona, to reach 2-4
(1-2), then dropped five straight to finish at
2-9. This year's Cardinal wants more than
anything to avoid a similar collapse.
For his part, Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens insists that progress is still being
made, despite last week's disappointing
shutout loss at Oregon.
"We adjust and we continue to move
forward," he said. "I know that sounds kind
of Pollyanna when you lose 35-0, but it's an
ongoing process and we understood that
coming in."
Stanford talked all offseason long about
not letting 2002 happen again, and to its
credit the team equaled last season's win
total quickly, winning its first two games of
the year. Now, however, the team is bogged
down in a brutal Pac-10 schedule that has it
playing every team except conference
doormat Arizona; progress in practice isn't
always readily apparent on gameday.
"We're not to a point where we feel like
we need to change [our approach], we just
need to do what we're doing and execute it
better," said junior linebacker David Berg
eron. "There are flashes of brilliance where
you can see the potential on this team."
And for the Cardinal, that may be the
hardest part getting better and still get
ting beat.
"Yes, I wish we had a bunch of wins,"
Teevens said. "[But] I do see development
... you present those things to the players,
and they realize it doesn't take away the
frustration, but there's a resolve to contin
ue and look for that successful opportuni
ty."
The decision to start senior Chris Lewis
at quarterback again this week despite the
Cardinal's failure to score against the
Ducks reflects one of the challenges for
Teevens and Stanford recognizing posi
tive aspects to even the most demoralizing
defeats.
"He did some very positive things on
Saturday," Teevens said, referencing
Lewis' 188 passing yards. "We'll get yards
any way we can."
On the plus side for the Cardinal, four
of its last five games come in Stanford
Stadium's friendly (if cavernous) con
fines, against teams with a combined
record of 16-16. The lone road trip is to
Corvallis, Ore. to face a beatable 5-3
Oregon State team. This is the bright side
to a difficult schedule that saddled the
Cardinal with two early-season bye
weeks and over a month between early
season home games.
It also provides a much better opportu
nity for a late-season surge than last year's
schedule, which sandwiched trips to
UCLA, Oregon and California around
home games against Southern California
and Oregon State.
Despite its disappointing record,
Stanford has yet to lose a game Las
Vegas expected it to win (granted,
that was only one game the sea
son opener against San Jose State),
and did manage to upset seven-point
favorite Brigham Young (a team
that is now 4-5 on the year) on Sept.
20.
The challenge for Stanford as it
takes on UCLA (6-2, 4-0) and Ari
zona State (4-4, 1-3) the next two
weeks will be to see if it can surprise
anyone.
"I keep telling you we'll have that
breakthrough opportunity,"
Teevens said. "It hasn't arrived yet,

but I'm very confident it will arrive
quickly."
What Stanford seeks to do the
next two weeks is nothing ground
breaking. It just wants to win a
game or two against a couple of
good but not great football teams.
A win against UCLA would cer
tainly be a nice surprise, especially
for first-year Bruins head coach Karl
Dorrell, who did not actually use the
words "Stanford" or "Cardinal" in
his comments to the press Tuesday.
If Stanford has its way, DorreU's
comments tomorrow evening won't
be able to take the Cardinal so light
ly-
"We're getting kind of tired of
calling these games learning experi
ences," said junior tackle Kirk
Chambers. "We're looking forward
to going out there and finishing this
season the way we know we can."
