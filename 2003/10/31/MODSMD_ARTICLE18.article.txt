# SCHIMMELMAN Breaking Through
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When some guy named Schimmelman
led the Stanford football team in tackles in
the first game of the season, fans were
scratching their heads: Where did this guy
come from, and why hadn't we heard of
him?
He came from Marietta, Ga., and if fans
hadn't heard of him before this year, it's
because he recorded just seven tackles in
2002 and saw time mainly on special teams.
Recruited as a wide receiver and safety,
Kevin Schimmelman was disappointed
when he first learned that he would be
moved to linebacker prior to this season's
spring practice.
"I thought I had a good chance to be a
starter this year at safety," he said. "It was
definitely a change I didn't expect."
On paper, the switch was puzzling. Why
move an unproven, undersized sophomore
to linebacker, a position where Stanford
had its six top players back from the previ
ous season?
Schimmelman has provided a simple
answer to that question with his perfor
mance on the field: Through six games, the
redshirt sophomore is second on the team
with 37 tackles and tied for second with five
tackles for loss.

And instead of being buried at the bot
tom of the depth chart, Schimmelman has
earned a starting spot ahead of more expe
rienced players like Michael Craven and
Jon Alston
Smaller than most Division I college
linebackers, Schimmelman attributes his
success mainly to his attitude.
"I've always had a real strong work
ethic," he said. "I would never feel sorry for
myself... I never had any doubt that I
would eventually make it to the top."
Fellow starting linebacker David Berg
eron confirmed this, calling Schimmelman
"a real student of the game, who watches a
lot of film."
That's all well, but linebackers are sup
posed to be bruisers, right? As a wide re
ceiver, a defensive back and a sprinter on
the track team in high school positions
stereotypically filled by flimsy hypochon
driacs in the Deion Sanders mold
Schimmelman said no one even thought of
recruiting him as a linebacker.
But the physicality has become one of
his favorite aspects of the position.
"You're up in the mix on every play," he
said. "You get to throw people around a
lot. It's more of a mindset than it is your
physical attributes."

Still, he admits that when an of
fensive guard who outweighs him by
100 pounds is bearing down on him,
he is the one who has to take precau
tions.
"That's always a fun [situation],"
he said. "What you've got to do is,
you've got to get low, you're pads
have got to be underneath his or
you're going to go flying."
Fortunately, Schimmelman usu
ally has the quickness to do all that in
the split second before getting
crushed. Usually.
"One of the linemen here might
have gotten me in practice a couple
times," he conceded, though he
claimed never to have been upended
in a game.
Of course, his speed has other
benefits that are of more conse
quence to his teammates.
"If I miss my guy, Kevin's quick
enough to come fill my gap and
cover my guy," Bergeron said.
"When you have speed like that at
the linebacker position, it allows us
to cover each other's mistakes."
Schimmelman would probably
appreciate Bergeron's praise.
Asked what he would most like to
achieve at Stanford, he said, "I'd
like to be remembered by the peo
ple I play with as a good teammate
and a respected member of my
team."
That mission was probably ac
complished by the time he led the
defense with 11 tackles against
Washington on Sept. 17, if not be
fore, but Schimmelman isn't satis
fied yet.
"Once you [earn a starting spot],
you can't be satisfied with that," he
said. "One of the hardest things is
continuing to improve, because if
you don't make plays, somebody
else will.
"Once you're able to start, then
you have to concentrate on stripping
the ball, coming up with an intercep
tion. That's when you get to be All-
Pac-10, then All-American."
If Schimmelman could achieve
those sorts of lofty goals in the near
future, he would become even more
valuable to a defense that has had
trouble forcing turnovers all year.
And if few people expect such big
things out of such a small player,
well, Schimmelman isn't about to let
that discourage him.
