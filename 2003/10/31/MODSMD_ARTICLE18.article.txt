# SCHIMMELMAN Breaking Through
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When some guy named Schimmelman
led the Stanford football team in tackles in
the first game of the season, fans were
scratching their heads: Where did this guy
come from, and why hadn't we heard of
him?
He came from Marietta, Ga., and if fans
hadn't heard of him before this year, it's
because he recorded just seven tackles in
2002 and saw time mainly on special teams.
Recruited as a wide receiver and safety,
Kevin Schimmelman was disappointed
when he first learned that he would be
moved to linebacker prior to this season's
spring practice.
"I thought I had a good chance to be a
starter this year at safety," he said. "It was
definitely a change I didn't expect."
On paper, the switch was puzzling. Why
move an unproven, undersized sophomore
to linebacker, a position where Stanford
had its six top players back from the previ
ous season?
Schimmelman has provided a simple
answer to that question with his perfor
mance on the field: Through six games, the
redshirt sophomore is second on the team
with 37 tackles and tied for second with five
tackles for loss.

And instead of being buried at the bot
tom of the depth chart, Schimmelman has
earned a starting spot ahead of more expe
rienced players like Michael Craven and
Jon Alston
Smaller than most Division I college
linebackers, Schimmelman attributes his
success mainly to his attitude.
"I've always had a real strong work
ethic," he said. "I would never feel sorry for
myself... I never had any doubt that I
would eventually make it to the top."
Fellow starting linebacker David Berg
eron confirmed this, calling Schimmelman
"a real student of the game, who watches a
lot of film."
That's all well, but linebackers are sup
posed to be bruisers, right? As a wide re
ceiver, a defensive back and a sprinter on
the track team in high school positions
stereotypically filled by flimsy hypochon
driacs in the Deion Sanders mold
Schimmelman said no one even thought of
recruiting him as a linebacker.
But the physicality has become one of
his favorite aspects of the position.
"You're up in the mix on every play," he
said. "You get to throw people around a
lot. It's more of a mindset than it is your
physical attributes."
