# After slow start, Bruins are rolling
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The UCLA football team isn't doing too
poorly for a team that only scored 17 total
points in its first two games and surrendered 59
points in its third.
Since losing to No. 1 Oklahoma on Sept. 20,
the Bruins (6-2) have reeled off five straight
wins to put themselves atop the Pacific 10 Con
ference standings with a perfect 4-0 record in
Pac-10 play.
While it's worth noting that the best team
UCLA has played since Oklahoma is Wash
ington, which is just 4-4 (2-2 Pac-10), first-year
head coach Karl Dorrell gets credit for win
ning the easy ones while managing a largely in
experienced team with a stunning 43 freshmen
on its roster.
The Bruins have so far proven apt at win
ning close contests, despite their relative lack
of ever-important senior leadership. UCLA is
5-1 in contests decided by 10 points or less
including a 23-20 overtime victory at Califor
nia two weeks ago, a victory secured when
Cal's tying field-goal attempt bounced off the
left upright.
"We have a little bit of luck on our side,"
Dorrell said at the time. "We keep finding a
way."
Although the Bruins face a tough final
month, with road dates at No. 6 Washington
State and No. 3 Southern California, they're
already bowl-eligible, so any additional wins
are just icing on a successful season. Dorrell
and the Bruins are understandably upbeat, as
the rebuilding process for Bob Toledo's suc
cessor has thus far gone better than most an
ticipated. The Bruins' only two losses came at
the hands of nationally ranked teams Col
orado (No. 24 at the time) and Oklahoma.
"We are fortunate ... with where we are
heading," Dorrell said after the Bruins' 46-16
win over Washington on Oct. 4. "We see our
potential and know what we can become."
It doesn't hurt when you have a quarter
back who's gone 5-1 as a starter sitting on your
bench which is exactly what's happened
since Matt Moore returned from injuries sus
tained during the season opener. Drew Olson,
like Moore a sophomore, struggled at times as
a starter, throwing for 1,280 yards, six touch
downs and five interceptions in the first seven
games. He started and won against Illinois,
San Diego State, Washington, Arizona and
Cal.
Despite Olson's winning ways, though, the
6-foot-4 Moore is regarded as the more gifted
signal caller.
Moore returned to the starting lineup Sat
urday and turned in an Olson-like effort in
leading the Bruins to a 20-13 win over Arizona
State. He completed 14-of-28 passes for 190
yards, one touchdown and two interceptions
the first interceptions of Moore's nine
game career.
Cardinal fans might remember Moore from
last year, when, as a true freshman, he started
against Stanford's Kyle Matter his team
mate at Hart High School.
Moore completed just 7-of-19 passes for
142 yards and a touchdown, but Matter threw
for just 75 yards himself, and the Bruins erased
a 15-0 deficit to win, 28-18.
The Bruins haven't needed to put up big
