# RA becomes vice provost for a day
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The campus had two vice provosts of
student affairs yesterday, and one of
them was a student.
Anna Ho, a Burbank resident assis
tant, shadowed Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni yesterday in the
first a series of shadowings for RAs.
"This is for RAs to see what the role
of a vice provost is, what the office does
and what Stanford administrators do,"
Awakuni said.
The idea for the new initiative
emerged last month, when Awakuni
met with this year's group of RAs dur
ing their training session to discuss is
sues of concern to the staff members.
Awakuni suggested that any RAs
interested in learning more about what
he does as a senior administrator would
be welcome to shadow him for a day.
Several students responded by writing
two paragraphs about their interest in
the program. There are four RAs
scheduled to shadow Awakuni this
quarter.

"I've done this before when I was at
Columbia, but not as extensively,"
Awakuni said. "I just let some students
come to meetings and I found that they
got a lot of insight. Students often see
the University from the outside, as a
monolith, and don't get a chance to see
its inner workings."
Ho, the first student to participate in
this program, was excited prior to her
day with Awakuni.
. "I don't come in here with any kid of
agenda, I'm just really interested to
know, in general, what role does the
vice provost of student affairs play?"
she said. "I would like to share with my
dorm just what it is that Awakuni
does."
To that end, Awakuni scheduled a
busy day of meetings for Ho. She co
chaired a College Council meeting that
occurs on a quarterly basis, in which
about 15 offices from across campus
send representatives to discuss Univer
sity matters. Then she met with a group
of students who were lobbying Awaku
ni for funds to attend a conference. Fi-
