# RA becomes vice provost for a day
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
The campus had two vice provosts of
student affairs yesterday, and one of
them was a student.
Anna Ho, a Burbank resident assis
tant, shadowed Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni yesterday in the
first a series of shadowings for RAs.
"This is for RAs to see what the role
of a vice provost is, what the office does
and what Stanford administrators do,"
Awakuni said.
The idea for the new initiative
emerged last month, when Awakuni
met with this year's group of RAs dur
ing their training session to discuss is
sues of concern to the staff members.
Awakuni suggested that any RAs
interested in learning more about what
he does as a senior administrator would
be welcome to shadow him for a day.
Several students responded by writing
two paragraphs about their interest in
the program. There are four RAs
scheduled to shadow Awakuni this
quarter.

"I've done this before when I was at
Columbia, but not as extensively,"
Awakuni said. "I just let some students
come to meetings and I found that they
got a lot of insight. Students often see
the University from the outside, as a
monolith, and don't get a chance to see
its inner workings."
Ho, the first student to participate in
this program, was excited prior to her
day with Awakuni.
. "I don't come in here with any kid of
agenda, I'm just really interested to
know, in general, what role does the
vice provost of student affairs play?"
she said. "I would like to share with my
dorm just what it is that Awakuni
does."
To that end, Awakuni scheduled a
busy day of meetings for Ho. She co
chaired a College Council meeting that
occurs on a quarterly basis, in which
about 15 offices from across campus
send representatives to discuss Univer
sity matters. Then she met with a group
of students who were lobbying Awaku
ni for funds to attend a conference. Fi-
nally, she lunched with the staff of El
Centro Chicano as part of Awaku
ni's series of meetings with campus
community centers.
"The shadowing process was con
densed into a two-and-a-half hour
day because I know students are
busy," Awakuni told Ho at the be
ginning. "I tried to provide a diverse
set of meetings, though, so you real
ly get to see what I do."
Awakuni plans to reintroduce
the program to RAs during winter
quarter when he again meets with
them. He hopes to keep the program
open throughout the year.
Sophomore Sarah Carroll liked
the shadowing idea and saw it as a way
for the Office of Student Affairs to
make itself appear more accessible.
"I think it's really cool that Vice
Provost Awakuni is willing to give
students an opportunity to interact
so directly with the University's ad
ministration," she said. "I doubt that
the whole experience will apply im
mediately to RAs' regular in-dorm
responsibilities, but at the very min

imum, I think it will make them
much more informed as Stanford
students [because] many of us have

no clear concept of how our univer
sity actually runs or what goes on in
the upper administration."
