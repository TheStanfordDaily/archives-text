## Sports, sex and double standards 
### 
So I peer out the kitchen window
and two humongous white tigers
with blue eyes (a la Siegfried and
Roy) are prowling around my
front yard. In an ingenious move fit for
an Ivy League admissions essay, I grab
my cat and escape to the attic, chuckling
at all the dumb people huddled out in
the yard who are going to get eaten. But
the tigers are on to me, sniff me up in
the attic, and come after me through the
roof. I couldn't get away.
I woke up before I got eaten, unlike a
similar dream years ago when the at
tacker grabbed my leg and started
munching on it, but the lesson was not
lost on me. No, not the discovery of
some hide-and-go-seek repressed mem-

ones, nor a fear of my
cat; I don't want to run
away to the circus, and
I still think you should
bike the hell away
when a cop-on-foot
tries to bully you into
stopping so he can lec
ture you on bicycle
safety and slap a ticket
on you for running a
stop sign on Mayfield

i o j
Avenue.
I'm talking about sports. Believe it or
not, this is a sports column I write each
week. See, the top of the page says
"Sports."
Back to the tiger dream. You just
can't get away from certain realities in
the world of college sports. The Boulder
mascot is a 1,300-pound bull named
Ralphie, even if you put it in a tiger suit.
And you thought a tree was bad?
You can get creative and try to es
cape it, do justice to the system, it's not
going to change. Best try to understand
it:
Some sports just don't matter. The
Daily doesn't cover them, people don't
go see them and the Dollies don't even
like to perform at their games. Both the
men's and women's cross country teams
are ranked No. 1 in the nation, but did
you even know they're in season? Sail
ing doesn't matter, neither does tennis,
no one knows there's a Stanford polo
team (you know, with horses) and I bet
you can't name two people on the field
hockey team (roommates don't count).
Co-ed sailing, by the way, is ranked No.
3, and women's tennis won the NCAA
championships the last two years in a
row (my roommate played, that's how I
know).
Football? 0-4 in conference play.
That's after the 35-0 shutout last Satur
day against the Ducks. But football
matters. They can lose all they want,
only a school like Canisius (that's in
Buffalo, N.Y.) would actually axe their
football program, and who cares about
Canisius anyway. Axe the football team
and you've axed your manhood. Unless
we're talking about Boston University,
but they party hard enough to make up
for it.
Seriously, though, I extend my good
wishes to Buddy, Chris, Trent, heck,
even Kyle tomorrow. Losing is no fun.
Men's soccer also sucks this season.
They're 0-7-0 in conference play, but it
doesn't matter. The sport is popular, the
guys are popular and there are girls at
Stanford who can tell you who's single,
who's taken and who may or may not be
on the verge of break-up.
You guessed it, we're coming upon
the gender dynamic here, which may or
may not be one of those facts of reality.
Stanford is chock-full of stellar female
athletes â€” just check out Jennifer Har
vey, Ally Marquand, Sara Bei and Lau
ren Fleshman, Ogonna Nnamani . . .
the list goes on but you have no idea
who I'm talking about, right? I don't ei
ther.
At a school where no one watches
the good sports and The Daily hires a
sports editorialist who doesn't watch
any sports, there remains one constant
anomaly of shameless spectating
groupiness: the Sixth Man Club. (For
men's basketball, obviously).
Sixth Man members spend the whole
season racking up points just to increase
their chances of getting into the "Big
Three Games." Some even buy cardi
nal-colored face paint and just really go
nuts. Oh, and they're not allowed to line
up on those special game days before 6
a.m. I won't even get up for sex at 6 a.m.
The sixth man doesn't play, by the
way. Like the fifth wheel.
Stanford sports in a nutshell: foot
ball, Tony Azevedo and all that other
stuff. Don't get too distressed, the
"other stuff" is going to keep on their
path to greatness whether we know who
they are or not.

Do you really believe Julie won 7 get up
for sex at 6 a.m.? Send her boyfriend
your condolences at julieolo@stan
ford.edu and she'll pass them along.
