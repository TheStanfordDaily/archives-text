# Robison, team head to Pac-10 Championship
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, senior Grant Robison
will have a chance to accomplish a feat no
one has pulled off since Washington
State's Henry Rono in 1979 and Oregon's
legendary Steve Prefontaine in 1973. Ro
bison will try for his third cross-country in
dividual Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship and if he wins Saturday, he will be
the first runner to do so in a three-year
span.
The Pac-10 meet in Pullman, Wash.,
will be his first race of the season.
"The team's excited about having
Grant back," said head coach Andy Ger
ard. "The seniors have been racing to
gether for a long time and they look for
ward to the opportunity to race together."
Three members of that senior class
Robison, lan Dobson and Donald Sage
swept the top three spots in last year's race
to help the Cardinal to its sixth Pac-10
Championship in the past seven years.
Robison was the 2002 Pac-10 Athlete
of the Year. He was also first team All-
Conference in each of his first three sea
sons.
Asked if the team will try to put Robi
son in a position to win the race, Gerard
said, "We're not putting a lot of emphasis
on it, because it's his first race of the sea
son. Our goal is to win the team title."
If the Cardinal runs the way it has this

season, that should not be a problem. The
team has won each of the four races it has
competed in, most notably the Pre-NCAA
meet on Oct. 18, in which six Stanford
runners placed in the top nine in a field
that included more than 30 top-ranked
NCAA teams.
Stanford will, however, face some com
petition in the Pac-10, most notably from
No. 14 Arizona, No. 15 Arizona State and
No. 18 Oregon. The Arizona team in
cludes freshman Robert Cheseret, who
has not placed lower than second in any
meet so far.
"The Pac-10 is a tight bunch, but we're
the odds-on favorite," Gerard said of his
top-ranked team.
He also said that the team plans to run
together during the race, primarily be
cause of the psychological advantage of
racing with the same runners they have
been practicing with every day.
The Pac-10 record keepers had better
be prepared to get their fountain pens out
if Robison is able to make his way to the
front of that group.
The top-ranked, senior-less women's
squad will be led by juniors Sara Bei, last
year's individual champion, and Alicia
Craig, the 2002 Pacific 10 Conference Ath
lete of the Year. The Cardinal will also be
looking for strong performances from ju
niors Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki and for
