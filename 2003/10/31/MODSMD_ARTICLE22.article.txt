# Volleyball downs Wildcats in four
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The last time the Stanford women's vol
leyball team won game one of a match was
Oct. 7 in its four game victory over Pacific.
Since then, the Cardinal has dropped game
one in five straight matches and has a
record during that stretch of 2-3 losing
to Washington, USC and California.
Against Arizona last night, No. 9 Stan
ford was given a gift, as the Wildcats had
nine service errors and eight hitting errors
in game one. Behind these 17 free points,
despite another relatively slow start by the
Cardinal, it was able to win game one 30-
28.
"We're definitely fighting [the losses in
game one]," said Stanford head coach John
Dunning. "Losing the first time puts us in a
hole and puts a lot of added pressure on us.
Tonight, it was good to get that one and
their nine service errors definitely helped."
In game one, Stanford was outhit by
Arizona 12-23 and outdug 12-18. Fresh
man outside hitter Kristin Richards led the
Cardinal offense with four kills, but was
outdone by Arizona's outside hitters,
sophomore Kim Glass and Jennifer Aber
nathy, who had eight kills seven kills, re
spectively, in the game.
Riding the win in game one, Stanford
(16-5, 9-3 Pacific 10 Conference) was able
to take game two, but found itself again
having trouble out of the locker room, los
ing game three. The Cardinal managed to
rebound, taking game four 30-24, and win
ning the match three games to one over the
Wildcats (10-12,4-7).
The Cardinal was again forced to play
the match without senior middle blocker
Sara McGee who is still out with a foot
injury. To fill the void in the middle left by
McGee, Dunning had to mix up his starting
lineup, shuffling senior Sara Dukes from
the right to the middle, putting junior Jen

nifer Hucke on the right side and senior de
fensive specialist Leahi Hall in the back
row for Dukes.
"We had to move some blockers around
tonight, and McGee is getting better but
we're trying to hold her off until California
so she's fully healed," Dunning said.
In game two, as it has done consistently
throughout the season, the Cardinal
picked up its level of intensity. After hit
ting .257 with only 12 kills in game one, the
Cardinal hit .391 with 22 kills in game two.
Stanford also picked up its defense, only
allowing the Wildcats 14 kills for a .200 hit
ting percentage. Like game one, game two
remained close throughout, and included
nine ties and six lead changes. With the
game tied at 24, Richards and Nnamani tal
lied back-to-back kills to give the Cardinal
a two-point lead and Stanford did not look
back, winning the game on a kill by senior
middle blocker Jennifer Harvey.
After the break, Arizona came back on
the floor determined not to be swept and
wildcat sophomore Kim Glass was only
three kills away from reaching the 1,000 ca
reer kill milestone and becoming the
fastest player in Arizona history to reach
that mark. In the game, Glass did more
than reach her goal, as she had nine kills in
Arizona's 33-31 game three win. As in the
two previous games, neither team could
take a substantial lead and while Arizona
did go up 11-5 early in the game, Stanford
drew even, locking the game at 19 points a
piece.
The game was further tightened by a re
versed service call late in the game. With
the score at 28-26, in favor of the Cardinal,
Stanford setter sophomore Katie Gold
hahn served what appeared to be an ace
and moved the Cardinal within one point
of the match. The call, however, was re
versed, giving Arizona the point and mov-

ing the game to 28-27. Arizona was then able
to hold off two Cardinal game points and bat
tle back to win the game on a kill by sopho
more middle blocker Bre Ladd.
In game four, the Wildcats managed to
battle back from an 18-10 deficit to bring the
game within three at 20-17. But it wasn't
enough as Stanford won the game and the
match 30-24. In the game, while Stanford hit
only .125 with only six more kills than it had
hitting errors 16 kills and 10 errors
Arizona had only 13 kills to its 10 hitting er
rors for a .079 hitting percentage.
In the match, four Cardinal players had

Richards had 16, Hucke had 11 and Dukes
had 10. Additionally, Nnamani, Richards
and Hucke had double-doubles, adding 11,

The last time the Stanford women's vol
leyball team won game one of a match was
Oct. 7 in its four game victory over Pacific.
Since then, the Cardinal has dropped game
one in five straight matches and has a
record during that stretch of 2-3 losing
to Washington, USC and California.
Against Arizona last night, No. 9 Stan
ford was given a gift, as the Wildcats had
nine service errors and eight hitting errors
in game one. Behind these 17 free points,
despite another relatively slow start by the
Cardinal, it was able to win game one 30-
28.
"We're definitely fighting [the losses in
game one]," said Stanford head coach John
Dunning. "Losing the first time puts us in a
hole and puts a lot of added pressure on us.
Tonight, it was good to get that one and
their nine service errors definitely helped."
In game one, Stanford was outhit by
Arizona 12-23 and outdug 12-18. Fresh
man outside hitter Kristin Richards led the
Cardinal offense with four kills, but was
outdone by Arizona's outside hitters,
sophomore Kim Glass and Jennifer Aber
nathy, who had eight kills seven kills, re
spectively, in the game.
Riding the win in game one, Stanford
(16-5, 9-3 Pacific 10 Conference) was able
to take game two, but found itself again
having trouble out of the locker room, los
ing game three. The Cardinal managed to
rebound, taking game four 30-24, and win
ning the match three games to one over the
Wildcats (10-12,4-7).
The Cardinal was again forced to play
the match without senior middle blocker
Sara McGee who is still out with a foot
injury. To fill the void in the middle left by
McGee, Dunning had to mix up his starting
lineup, shuffling senior Sara Dukes from
the right to the middle, putting junior Jen

nifer Hucke on the right side and senior de
fensive specialist Leahi Hall in the back
row for Dukes.
"We had to move some blockers around
tonight, and McGee is getting better but
we're trying to hold her off until California
so she's fully healed," Dunning said.
In game two, as it has done consistently
throughout the season, the Cardinal
picked up its level of intensity. After hit
ting .257 with only 12 kills in game one, the
Cardinal hit .391 with 22 kills in game two.
Stanford also picked up its defense, only
allowing the Wildcats 14 kills for a .200 hit
ting percentage. Like game one, game two
remained close throughout, and included
nine ties and six lead changes. With the
game tied at 24, Richards and Nnamani tal
lied back-to-back kills to give the Cardinal
a two-point lead and Stanford did not look
back, winning the game on a kill by senior
middle blocker Jennifer Harvey.
After the break, Arizona came back on
the floor determined not to be swept and
wildcat sophomore Kim Glass was only
three kills away from reaching the 1,000 ca
reer kill milestone and becoming the
fastest player in Arizona history to reach
that mark. In the game, Glass did more
than reach her goal, as she had nine kills in
Arizona's 33-31 game three win. As in the
two previous games, neither team could
take a substantial lead and while Arizona
did go up 11-5 early in the game, Stanford
drew even, locking the game at 19 points a
piece.
The game was further tightened by a re
versed service call late in the game. With
the score at 28-26, in favor of the Cardinal,
Stanford setter sophomore Katie Gold
hahn served what appeared to be an ace
and moved the Cardinal within one point
of the match. The call, however, was re
versed, giving Arizona the point and mov-
