# Geiger leads struggling team north
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The College Cup seasons, this year's 2-12-
2 season, a coaching change: When it comes
to Stanford men's soccer, fifth-year senior
Abe Geiger has seen it all.
Geiger has been part of one of the most
unbreakable defenses in Stanford history,
he's been the team's elected captain for three
straight years and he's become the squad's

Ironman, having started 63 consecutive
games.
Stanford head coach Bret Simon has
nothing but praise for the defender, who in
his role as captain has always been a "steady
ing influence" for the team, on and off the
field.
That kind of influence is exactly what the
Cardinal needed in 2001, Geiger's first year
as captain, and in his opinion, the toughest
that he experienced on the Farm.

After the 2000-01 season, then-head
coach Bobby Clark resigned after five years
with the Cardinal, in order to coach at Notre
Dame. The event upset many of the players
and put the program in limbo for a time.
"It was like the program was in purgato
ry," Geiger said jokingly. "We didn't know
what was going to happen and we had no
sense of direction, and it got really stressful."
That winter, Geiger and the squad were
able to translate the team's uncertain future

into an opportunity to build exceptional
team chemistry, which Geiger points to as a
main reason the team made a run to the Col
lege Cup that year.
"We were a little bit worried about [the
season] because [Clark and Simon] just have
such different styles of play," Geiger admits.
"But when [Simon] got here, we knew we
had the right guy. I feel really lucky to have
played under both coaches."
Though that transitional season
was the hardest for Geiger, he allows
that this season has also tested his
abilities as a leader in many ways.
"[Being a captain] is a good expe
rience, and it's great to be involved
and have a say in what's going on."
Geiger said. "But it's tough at times
when things aren't going right. You
feel responsible for the way that
things are going."
Geiger said that the squad's cur
rent record is a source of frustration
because of the fact that many of the
Cardinal's losses haven't been a re
sult of poor play.
"You really want to do something
to help out, but we've just had some
bad luck," he said.
Geiger's teammates however,
think that he is doing more than
enough to help the team improve
and work together.
Even before the Cardinal's first
regular season game, Geiger had
won the respect of freshman Marcus
Ryan, who was impressed with his
calm leadership style.
"It's so easy to yell at each other
when we're out on the field," Ryan
said. "But Abe's great about just giv
ing constructive criticism."
Aside from the trials that Geiger
has overcome as a leader on the
field, he has also spent the last five
years struggling to stay healthy.
In high school, Geiger tore his
ACL and had surgery on his
knee. The following year he tore
his lateral meniscus, which re
quired surgery again. And then
the summer before his senior
year, he went in for surgery one
more time to clear out some scar
tissue left over from the first two
injuries.
In spite of it all, Simon still de
scribes Geiger as one of the fittest
athletes on the team, and said that he
is playing the best soccer of his col
lege career this season.
"The pain comes and goes now,"
Geiger said. "The worst part really is

just not being able to play [after
surgery]: That idle time kills you."
Though Geiger said that he will
likely require one more surgery
much like the last one he had he
plans to continue to play soccer long
after he graduates this winter.
"It's tough in the U.S., but I'd
love to go pro," he said. "I'd like to
play as long as possible, and maybe
go and do some coaching after that.
"I don't know if I could handle
having, you know, a regular job," he
added with a smile.
Geiger and the rest of the Stan
ford squad (2-12-2, 0-7 Pacific 10
Conference) travel north this week
end for matchups with No. 15 Ore
gon State (10-4-0, 4-1, Pac-10) and
No. 25 Washington (9-2-2,2-2-1 Pac
-10).
The Cardinal met the two teams
three weeks ago at home .and both
games ended in 1-0 losses for Stan
ford.
Though the Cardinal played ag
gressively against the Huskies and
Beavers in those games, Simon ex
pects that his team will have to work
even harder to secure wins this
weekend.
"Both teams will be harder to
play at their homes, and they are bet
ter than when we played them last
time," he said.
OSU is enjoying its best con
ference start in its history and is
in second place in the Pac-10.
Both Washington and Oregon
State are poised to play in the
NCAA Tournament, which caus
es the teams to play harder in
order to secure seeding in the
tourney.
"Every game mean a lot for
[these teams]," Simon said. "But
every game means a lot to us too,
because our guys have a lot of
pride."
"We've been giving the effort and
have been really unlucky," said ju
nior forward James Twehman. "But
if you can handle the adversity dur
ing the year, you can really come to
gether as a team."
Stanford will be in Seattle on Fri
day at 7 p.m. to face the Huskies be
fore heading down to Corvallis, Ore.
on Sunday for the 1 p.m. matchup
with the Beavers.
