"She was bora to play the game."
It's a sports cliche used almost as much
as "we just went out and gave it 110 per
cent," "it was a team effort" or "we're
gonna take it one game at a time," but for
redshirt junior goalkeeper Nicole Barn
hart, it just might be true.
Barnhart, known affectionately by
teammates as Barney, has a seemingly end
less list of individual accomplishments and
accolades.
She was named 2002 first-team NSCAA
All-American, a member of the gold medal
winning Under-21 National Team and is in
the process of rewriting the Stanford record
books after just one full season starting in
goal.
Currently, Barnhart is the all-time Cardi
nal leader in goals against average (.400) and
has the third-most shutouts with 28. In 2002,
she posted a single season record with a .18
GAA, allowing just four goals all season.
And along with senior midfielder
Allyson Marquand and senior defender
Natalie Spilger, she serves as one of the
team's captains for this year's Stanford
squad (8-7-2,3-2-1 Pacific 10 Conference).
Barnhart's rise to the top has been
greatly fueled by her desire to always com
pete with the best players out there.
Before Barnhart came to Stanford, she
played keeper with the Boyertown High
School boys' team. At the same time, she
participated in USA Soccer's Olympic De
velopment Program. For the past two sum
mers, she has been a member of the U-21
National Team.
"My ODP coaches probably had the
most impact on me in terms of my develop
ment as a player," Barnhart said. "And the

opportunity to play on the National Team
came after I had knee surgery, so it was a
great environment to get competitive again
right away."
Whenever Barnhart has been on the
field, she has made a huge impact for Stan
ford, but a torn ACL kept her out of action
for a full year. After playing behind Carly
Smolak in 2000, Barnhart was forced to
take a medical redshirt in 2001.
From a spectator's point of view, Barn
hart's knee problems have not shown in her
play this season.
"Knock on wood, it's been feeling great
this year," Barnhart said.
In fact, she has had more trouble with
the flu this year than with her knee. Stay
ing true to her usual role as a leader of the
team, she sucked it up and played through
it. She played the entire UCLA game,
which went to double overtime without
being able to speak, which posed a slight
communication problem with the de
fense.
"I try to lead by example," Barnhart
said. "I give it my best whether it's in prac
tice or in a game and hope that energy re
flects on everybody else."
With an injury-plagued frontline that is
without its three top scorers from last sea
son's team, Barnhart's defensive prowess
has been a necessity for the Cardinal.
"I do feel a little bit of added pressure to
play a perfect game," she said. "It comes
back to me a little bit and I feel like I need
to keep us in the game, but really it's a team
feeling of frustration."
Despite the scoring struggles, the
strength of Barnhart and the rest of the
Stanford defense allow the Cardinal to take
the field with confidence in every match.
"Nicole is the kind of player who makes
your team always feel like [it] has a chance

to win when she is in goal," Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said.
Barnhart makes strong contributions
every time she takes the field, but was
particularly outstanding in recent confer
ence action against No. 3 UCLA (12-1-3,
5-0-1) and Southern California (7-6-4, 3-
2-1).
Both the Bruins and Trojans were
shutout by the Cardinal. Barnhart racked
up 11 saves in the two matches and was
named Pac-10 Player of the Week.
Barnhart's leadership and outstanding
play will be key for Stanford this weekend
when it takes Maloney Field on Friday to
square off against No. 14 Washington (9-4-
3,2-2-1) at 7 p.m. and Washington State (5-
9-1,1-3-1) on Sunday at 12 p.m.
Stanford looks to score early as it cur
rently posts a 7-0 record when it gets the
first score.
"We've trying to increase confidence in
practice this week," Ratcliffe said. "We've
been working on finishing with a lot of one
on-one drills."
Ratcliffe expects two tough matches this
weekend, but anticipates a particularly
challenging Friday night.
"Washington is a very organized team,"
Ratcliffe said. "They have two very good
forwards. [Junior Tina Frimpong] is one of
the quickest and best forwards in the Pac
-10, so no doubt, it will be a challenge."
Frimpong leads the Husky squad with
10 goals on 50 shot attempts. She has twice
been named Pac-10 Player of the Week.
"It's a very important weekend for our
standing in the conference," Ratcliffe said.
"UCLA is sort of running away with the
title, but everyone else is bunched up in
the middle right now, so hopefully we'll
get a good crowd out and pick up a couple
wins."
