# Final regular season game crucial
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To say that the season for one team
comes down to one game is always a little bit
of an exaggeration.
That is certainly the case for the Stanford
field hockey team (4-11,2-3 Northern Pacif
ic Conference), which heads into its regular
season finale this Saturday at Pacific having
already played its fair share of difficult and
important games.
While the Cardinal's season does not
rely solely on its performance Saturday,
Stanford still has a few things to gain if it
wins.
One final win before the NorPac tourna
ment would boost the confidence of a Stan
ford team that has lost 10 of its last 12 games.
The Cardinal is currently tied for second
with Pacific in the NorPac Western Division
standings. By Saturday evening the stand
ings will have changed, and one of the teams
will have settled for third place.
The final regular season game for both

teams is essential in determining the seed
ings from the West Division in the NorPac
Championships, which will be held in St.
Louis, Mo., this year.
"We would love to leave for Saint Louis
on Tuesday with a win under our belts," said
Stanford head coach Lesley Irvine. "We're
excited about the NorPac Tournament. It
gives us another chance to qualify for post
season."
The winner of the match this weekend
will be given the No. 2 seed to face the No. 3
seed from the Eastern Division. The No. 3
seed will have to face the No. 2 seed from
the East.
If history is any indication, the Cardinal
could have a slight advantage over the
Tigers, as it has won the last 20 matches be
tween the teams, including a 4-2 win earlier
this season.
But the Cardinal's advantage might have
already been curtailed.
At the start of the season, Pacific head
coach Linda Mac Donald announced that
the team felt that it could beat any team it

played.
This fearless approach to the game has
worked well for Pacific this season. After
finishing fourth last season with a 4-14
record, Pacific has rebounded this year with
its first .500 regular season since 1989.
"I'm not surprised at all," Irvine said.
"They've been steadily adding quality play
ers and picked up a couple of nice recruits
this year that have the ability to finish. The
improvements they have made are great for
California field hockey."
The Tigers, led by freshman forward
Vianney Campos, will be looking to extend
their season high, four-game winning streak
their longest since 1981.
Campos is having a great season, having
already been named NorPac Offensive
Player of the Week and NorPac Rookie of
the Week. She leads her team with 16 points
and seven goals, including three in a 5-0 vic
tory exhibition game against Cal-Poly (5-1-
1) last Sunday.
Other Pacific notables include senior co
captain Cameron Kato, who was named Na

tional Field Hockey Coaches Association
Division I Senior All-Star.
Stanford will be led by its own offensive
bombarder, freshman forward Cara-Lynn
Lopresti, who has eight goals on the season
and a team-high 22 points.
The Cardinal heads to Pacific fresh off a
loss Tuesday to Southwest Missouri State
(5-12,1-5 NorPac). After playing well in its
previous game against the Bears, Stanford
floundered Tuesday and fell 2-1.
The Cardinal will take the knowledge
they learned from that experience into Sat
urday's matchup.
"We know we have potential for so
much," said senior forward Noor Dawood
after Tuesday's game. "If we're not putting
it up there [with] every single person believ
ing in it, it's not going to happen for us. We
just need to learn from this and take it into
[Pacific] and in the tournament to make
sure it doesn't happen again."
The NorPac Championship tournament
kicks off next Thursday, Nov. 6. and will run
through Saturday, Nov. 8.
