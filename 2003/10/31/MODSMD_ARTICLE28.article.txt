# Student entrepreneur group unveils this year's contests

### EUGENIE KIM 
Approximately 100 students crowded into the
Packard Electrical Engineering Building last night to
attend the kickoff event for the Business Association
of Stanford Engineering Students.
BASES is a non-profit, student-run organization
that works to provide Stanford students with entre
preneurship skills, resources and experience that
they will be able to apply to their future.
Founded in 1996, the association hosts three year
ly contests in which teams of Stanford students and
faculty work together to compete for a combined
total of approximately $70,000.
However, the monetary rewards were not the pri
mary attraction for the students who attended last
night's kickoff, as the organization also strives to ex
pand the traditional realm of business enterprise to
include opportunities for not-for-profit, social entre
preneurship.
"It is the first time that I heard about BASES,"
said sophomore Marie Cannizzaro, a human biology
major with a concentration in social entrepreneur
ship. "But I'm in Public Policy 193, the social entre
preneurship collaboratory, so I'm hoping to enter my
idea in the Social Entrepreneur's Challenge."
BASES executives were excited about their third
year of competition.
"BASES is building the next generation of entre
preneurs," said Victor Karkar, the vice president of
the Social Entrepreneur's Challenge competition.
"We're providing a primary form of entrepreneur
ship and innovation specifically for Stanford stu
dents."
The three competitions, the Entrepreneur's Chal
lenge (E-Challenge), the Innovator's Challenge (I-
Challenge) and the Social Entrepreneur's Challenge
(Social E-Challenge), address different types of so
cial or business ventures.
BASES holds various workshops and mixers
throughout the year to develop a network of contacts

between potential entrepreneurs, as well as to teach
them proficiency in real-life applications such as writ
ing grant proposals and creating successful teams.
Each stage in the three competitions is structured
to represent the process of undertaking a business
venture in the real world. There are eliminations
throughout the year and judges ranging from the
private banking sector to non-profit initiatives de
cide upon the final three winners in the spring.
"If you're interested in starting a business in the
traditional way, where the goal is to make a profit,
and also impact the world, and if your idea has the op
portunity to change the world today, then the E-chal
lenge is right for you," said I-Challenge Vice Presi
dent Neil Daswani. "If you plan on changing the
world in three, five, even 10 years, and your project
involves high-tech, cutting edge research, then the I-
Challenge is right for you.
"And the Social E-Challenge is for people who
want to change the world not necessarily for prof
it through a sustainable organization," Daswani
continued.
Many students were struck by the emphasis placed
on social responsibility in the business world, which
has been a growing concern in the entrepreneurial
field.
"It was really an insightful experience to hear
about non-profit organizations today, especially how
they try to distinguish themselves from the old orga
nizations," said junior Benjamin Ching.
Attendees heard brief presentations from past
years' finalists and winners, who ranged from
founders involved in video-conferencing technolo
gies to those concerned with improving the system of
gift-giving charities.
All of the presenters emphasized the valuable
skills and financial support provided by BASES, urg
ing students to get involved in the competitions if
only to meet like-minded potential entrepreneurs.
"Whether it be today or tomorrow, for profit or
not-for-profit, BASES has the right competition for
you," Daswani said.
