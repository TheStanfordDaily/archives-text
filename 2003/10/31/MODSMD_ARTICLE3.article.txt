# Treats for charity

### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
While many Stanford students have been preparing their
Halloween costumes for a night of partying, some campus
Greek organizations have planned community service events,
including trick-or-treating for cans and a haunted house for
local community members.
Tonight, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority will be visiting 500 homes in the
community, collecting canned goods for the Urban Ministry,
a Palo Alto food bank. On Wednesday night, the Sigma Nu
fraternity and Pi Beta Phi sorority held a haunted house for
children in the local community.
"The needs of the homeless and hungry need to be ad
dressed, especially as the weather cools, and SAE and Theta
feel that this event is a great way for us to not only collect food,
but also to raise awareness in the surrounding community,"
said junior Adam Ballew, the SAE community service chair.
An eerie journey through a graveyard, a maze and an en
chanted forest were just a few of the attractions of the Sigma
Nu and Pi Phi haunted house, which drew about 75 kids, in
cluding participants of Stanford's East Palo Alto Tennis and
Tutoring program, as well the children of many Stanford pro
fessors and staff.
"It was a blast getting into costumes and jumping out from
behind a gravestone or two," said senior Mike Scrafford, the
Sigma Nu community service chair. "Haunted houses are a
part of almost every kid's memories of Halloween, and it was
fun to be on the scaring side of the house with fellow Sigma
Nus and the Pi Phis."
Those Greek chapters also used the haunted house as an op
portunity to collect more than 100 book donations for a local li-

brary, as part of their campaign to
raise literacy levels. While the Pi Phis
organized a haunted house on then
own last year, this was the first time
that the two groups combined then
forces to put on the event. Each orga
nization contributed about $l5O to
cover the expenses.
"We were really excited about
the haunted house this year," said
sophomore Jennifer Heil, a Pi Phi
philanthropy co-chair. "It was a
great event and also benefited the
East Palo Alto library with dona
tions of children's books."
Sophomore Mira Rapp-Hooper,
also a philanthropy co-chair, added,

"Working with Sigma Nu has been a
fantastic experience. The combina
tion of both houses' great ideas, hard
work and enthusiasm made the
haunted house a success."
SAE's trick-or-treating for cans
event is entering its fourth year. Last
year, the fraternity was able to col
lect 1,000 canned goods. SAE's con
nection with the Urban Ministry also
comes in the form of meal donations,
serving dinners and delivering food
to the needy.
"SAE has a great philanthropy
tradition and we have continued that
tradition this quarter," Ballew said.
"We have worked very hard with
groups on and off campus to help
make their events a success."
SAE is planning a blood drive in
November and its annual Fun Run in
April on Stanford's Community Day.
