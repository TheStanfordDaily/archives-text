## UCLA supports accused coach 
### JESSICA BACH DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) After the revelation
that UCLA strength and conditioning
coach E.J. "Doc" Kreis was named in con
nection to a Denver civil suit against the
University of Colorado, the Bruins'
coaching staff and players remain sup
portive.
The suit was filed Monday in Boulder,
Colo., by a former CU student who al
leges she was gang-raped by Buffalo foot
ball recruits in 2001. She claims in the suit
that there was "deliberate indifference,
after actual notice" to the university of
the risks of sexual assault within its foot
ball recruiting program, according to the
Rocky Mountain News.
With knowledge of the suit first surfac
ing on Tuesday, the coaching staff ac

knowledges not knowing about it before
hiring Kreis, though they maintain they
are not concerned by the revelations.
"I didn't know about [Kreis' connec
tion with the civil suit]," coach Karl Dor
rell said. "But as far as I know of that sit
uation from afar, it appears to be more
that they're trying to get a case together
for a civil suit.
"As to [Kreis'] involvement, I don't
think it was anything significant. So I'm
not anticipating any issues coming out."
The suit says campus police Lt.
Michelle Irving believed Kreis, a former
CU coach, had helped organize the story
players allegedly involved would tell po
lice, the Rocky Mountain News and The
Associated Press reported.
"[Kreis] then was the kind of pipeline
to the rest of the coaches," Irving testi
fied, according to the motion as reported

by the Rocky Mountain News.
Dorrell said had he been given any
prior notice of the suit, there would have
been no changes in his choice to hire Kreis
over the summer.
"I'm sure it would [have some affect on
the hiring process]," he said. "But with all
our due diligence that was done when we
looked into him coming here to be our
strength coach, this wasn't something that
was of issue at the time."
Kreis, who came to UCLA after being
dismissed from CU, has been very well re
ceived by the players many of whom
credit him with increasing their strength
and conditioning.
"Kreis is a great man and a great per
son. He points us in the right direction,"
offensive guard Eyoseph Efseaff said.
"I don't know much about [the civil
suit], but that's not the Doc we know."
