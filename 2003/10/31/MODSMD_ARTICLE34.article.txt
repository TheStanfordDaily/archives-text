### SHAUN PARCELS RACHEL SPIVAK DAILY COLLEGIAN 
(U-WTRE) Although many local bar man
agers said bouncer training emphasizes verbal
nonviolent resolution of disputes, some Pennsyl
vania State University students have
concern about safety at downtown State College,
Pa., establishments.
Penn State student Salvador Peter Serrano,
21, died early Sunday morning following a fight in
the 100 block of East Calder Way. Police said
when they arrived, they found Serrano restrained
by a bouncer from the All American Rathskeller,
108 S. Pugh St., but unresponsive.
Local bar owners and bouncers said they train
and are taught to defuse situations involving pa
trons without violence.
Greg Haas, a Penn State senior, has worked as
a bouncer at Shandygaff Saloon for about three
months.
"We are not allowed to hit or hold down a per
son whatsoever unless they are physically attack
ing us," he said.
Haas said he would never follow a patron off
the property.
"When they get to the bottom of the stairs and
leave the platform, then we no longer are allowed
to pursue them," he said. "We never leave the
property."
Bill Rock, general manager for Player's Nite
dub, said the trainingprogramfor employees, es
pecially bouncers, is extensive. "We pride our
selves on the training," he said.
Rock said door staff must go to an orientation
where they learn basic situational-control skills.
The bouncers then attend a bar code program,
which involves the Tavern Association of State
College, a local organization of downtown bars
and restaurants working with police to increase
patron safety.

"They go to a four-hour class that goes over
expectations for patrons of the bar. how to defuse
situations and how to look out for potential prob
lems,'' he said. "They're taught to use diploma
cy."
David Wells, director of operations for
Dante's Restaurants Inc., which owns several
downtown State College restaurants, bars and
shops, said a bouncer's main responsibility is to
the patron. "A bouncer's job is to protect the cus
tomers, not only from other people but from
themselves as well," Well said. "Our training is
basically that they need to solve a problem
through talking about it, not fighting."
Elliott Fitzgibbons, a senior, said Tuesday that
he would be meeting with friends at the Shandy
gaff Saloon later in the night He said after seeing
a memorial to Serrano, he thought again about his
plans but would still go out
"Seeing it freaked me out," Fitzgibbons said.
"I thought twice about going out, but I don't think
most people will."
Joe Torrance, a junior, said he felt safe enter
ing the Gingerbread Man on Tuesday night.
"From what I have seen, the bouncers are re
spectable" he said. "I didn't think twice about
going out"
Sgt. John Wilson of State College Police De
partment said the role of the bouncer is greater
than most people assume. "They know how to
stop fake ID's and enforce security," Wilson said.
He added it is each bar's choice as to the role
of their door staff.
"Each individual establishment decides how
far they can go with their responsibilities," he said.
Local police do not get involved unless they
are called to the bar, Wilson added.
Mike Kokos, a junior, said he thinks peoples'
behavior at bars will change after the weekend in
cident. "I think people will be more cautious
when they go to [bars] and be more aware of their
surroundings and conduct," he said.
