# All-star cast makes 'Love' too complicated
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
The trailer for "Love Actually"
is packed with enough stars to make
your head spin. The actual movie
makes your head spin even more.
The cast includes Hugh Grant,
Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Laura
Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan
Rickman, Keira Knightley and Bill
Nighy. As a result, watching the film

is a lot like juggling: As you

try to focus on the inter-,
action between any two
characters, your mind is
already on the seven or
eight other story lines
that are unfolding si
multaneously.
There is no real cen
tral character in this
movie, though Grant

(playing Ken, Britain's prime minis
ter) kicks off the film by proclaiming
that love is everywhere, especially at
the airport. Then you meet Billy
Mack (Nighy), an aging rock star
who seems intent on ending his ca
reer by completely bashing his own
record. We are introduced to the
rest of the characters in the film
through these quick takes, laden
with snippets of snappy English dia
logue crafted by Richard Curtis
("Notting Hill," "Bridget Jones's
Diary"), who also directs the film.
Curtis wastes no time setting out
the plot, and the subplot and the
nine or 10 other subplots. We meet

Juliet (Knightley) and Peter, who
just got married; Jamie (Firth) and
his wife, who soon split; Colin, the
self-proclaimed "god of sex," whose
only wish is to go to America and get
laid by lots of American girls who
will love him simply because he has
an accent; a couple of stand-ins for
the porn industry; Sarah (Linney),
who is desperately in love with her

extremely sexy co-

worker Carl; and
i Daniel (Neeson),
who honors his dead
wife at her funeral by
playing the Bay City
Rollers' "Bye bye
baby. "All this within
the first 10 minutes
of the film.
I take back what I
said before: Actually
there is no plot in

"Love Actually." The only over-rid
ing and encompassing idea is "love,"
and more often "sex." The idea of
"Love Actually" is to follow the 10
couples as they explore their own
dealings with love, and make obser
vations about "the total agony of
being in love." However, most of the
time the film satirizes the concept,
and lets Neeson get away with lines
like, "Let's go have the shit kicked
out of us by love!"
Curtis does not make it clear
whether this is a movie we should
take seriously or as a farce. He at
tempts to mix semi-dramatic ele
ments (a side story about Sarah's

delusional brother) with highly
comical parts (including a promi
nent tribute to Monica Lewinsky).
Woody Allen once said, "Sex is
like having dinner: Sometimes you
joke about the dishes, sometimes
you take the meal seriously." The
problem with "Love Actually" is

that it hasn't really decided which
route to go. It leaves a lot of loose
ends, while throwing in bits of ran
dom sex. Nothing is really solved or
resolved. One comedic scene
doesn't lead to another. One would
think that maybe this is an attempt
at realism that nothing is really

solved in real-life, but then, just as
that thought flits into mind, Shan
non Elizabeth and Denise Richards
strut on to the screen, and that theo
ry goes straight out the window.
So, what is love actually? I think
I'm still trying to figure it out.



We're only "waving friends": Hugh Grant plays Britain's lovelorn Prime Minister in the romantic comedy "Love Actually."
