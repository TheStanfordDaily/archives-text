# It's hard to sing along with this 'Detective'
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
Try to remember your last nightmare.
Recall the very end of it, that boundary be
tween sleep and waking when you couldn't
quite separate the sound of your alarm from
screams of torture. If this is the kind of thing

you'd rather not relive, steer clear

of" The Singing Detective."
Otherwise, in "The Singing
Detective," you'll meet crime
novelist Dan Dark (Robert
Downey Jr.) and by "meet" I
mean flinch in your chair as his
ravaged face fills the screen. Dan
has a skin disease that gives him
hideous lesions all over his body

and leaves him unable to move on his own.
An added bonus is that the disease has
affected his mind, causing him to confuse re
ality with his paranoid hallucinations. These
delusions revolve around a 1950's hard
boiled detective (also Downey) who sings at
dance clubs in his spare time. This detective
turns out to be the star of a novel Dark once
wrote. He's hoping to sell the film rights to
it, and suspects just about everyone he
knows including his wife Nicola (Robin
Wright Penn) of trying to stop him.
The detective's case provides some fun
opportunities for the supporting cast. As
lowlife Mark Binney, Jeremy Northam
gives free rein to the sleaze that seemed to

be lurking behind his ruffled shirt in all
those period films he previously acted in.
And Adrien Brody gets to drape his gaunt
frame in pinstripes and play one of an en
gaging pair of thugs.
It's the detective's day job or rather,

his other night job, since al
most the entire movie takes
place at night — that pro

vides the film's best moments.

Downey's stage presence
manages to be both campy
and sexy — I could've spent
the whole two hours just
watching him sing "How
Much Is That Doggy In The
Window?"
Unfortunately, the film-

makers think they have bigger fish to fry.
The characters featured in his fantasy aren't
random creations — they're figures from
Dark's hellish past, and as they invade his
current life we begin to understand the
source of all his problems.
It's too bad Sigmund Freud is dead he
could've guest-starred. Taking his place is
Mel Gibson, playing against type as short,
balding psychoanalyst Dr. Gibbon. Once he
gets his hands on Dark's psyche, we find that
his mistrust of his wife, his feelings of guilt
and inadequacy, and even his bad skin are
caused by...
Well, let's just say the Austrian psycho
analyst would be proud. About halfway

through the action, the film turns into a text
book psychoanalysis, complete with cross
fades into the subconscious and simplistic
breakthroughs like, "Sex is what it's all
about!" Gee Dan, thanks for spelling it out
for us.
The sleazy underworld of 'sos nightclubs,
lit only by neon signs and ladies in red, is
compelling in a trippy way, and it's a shame
we only see it in the context of Dan's thera
py. By the time we reach the climax of
the case, this world is so mixed up with
Dan's childhood and his present that we
can't follow it anymore letting a good
whodunit dissolve into a mishmash of lurid
snapshots is one of the movie's biggest mis
takes.
The other mistake is under-using the de
tective. Convincing as Downey is as a
snarling invalid he can make the word
"rhetoric" vibrate with bitterness he's
absolutely fascinating in his second role, and
his final scene suggests a depth of character
that has been sadly unexplored.
"Watch my mouth," he says to Nicola,
and as he begins to sing it's impossible to do
anything else. In a film that alternates be
tween the tidily schematic and the unapolo
getically brutal, this instant stands out like a
neon light. It's as though Gordon, after de
voting two hours to pain, has suddenly dis
covered pleasure. If only he'd worked it out
sooner.


"This won't hurt a bit...except righ there!"
