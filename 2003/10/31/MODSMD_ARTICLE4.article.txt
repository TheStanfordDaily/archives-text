# Union argues contract late into night
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Cardinal Cogen workers were wrapping up
their fifth round of contract re-negotiations
with upper-level management as of press time
last night. Their three-year contract comes to
an end today.
Owned by General Electric Corporation,
Cardinal Cogen is the company subcontracted
by the University to operate the power plant lo
cated on Stanford campus. The power plant is
responsible for generating steam for heaters,
chilled water for air-conditioning and electrici
ty for the entire campus.
SEIU Local 715 and the 16 Cardinal Cogen
workers it represents say they are pushing for
wages and contract language that will match
those of other workers on campus who do the
same type of work.
Kennedy Helm, the SEIU Local 715 nego
tiator for the workers, said that General Elec
tric does not recognize the workers as a part of
Stanford, even though they communicate with
Stanford facilities workers on a regular basis.
"Negotiations are stagnating because they
don't think that the workers are part of the larg
er community or that they need to negotiate
over anything except wages," Helm said.
Currently, Stanford facilities workers re
ceive wages that are on average higher than
those received by Cardinal Cogen workers.
Additionally, Stanford facilities workers re
ceive more vacation days and higher differen
tials for graveyard and swing shifts than do Car
dinal Cogen workers.
Although Cardinal Cogen workers are al
lowed to unionize, language in their contract
forbids the workers from participating in union
activities, including distributing pamphlets and
picketing.
Larry Quinn, one of the workers whose job
is directly affected by the contract renegotia
tions, has been working at the power plant for
27 years. Quinn said that ever since the power
plant was subcontracted out to General Elec
tric in 1987, the company has been chipping
away at various parts of their contract, lowering
their wages and taking away their union rights.
"The goal of the negotiations is to bring the
standards in the contract back up to the same
level as when we were under University con
tract," Quinn said. "However, we realize that it
won't happen in one shot, and that it will take
time for the standards to gradually go back to
the levels they have been in the past."
The Stanford Labor Action Committee
started an online petition last week in support
of higher wages and free speech rights for the
Cardinal Cogen workers.
Junior Pati Hernandez, a member of SLAC,
said that she helped start the petition in order to
let the University know that the students want
them to pressure General Electric into consid
ering the workers' proposals.
"We at SLAC are bothered that the workers
are limited by their contracts and do not have
freedom of speech," she said. "Al
though they can't speak for them
selves, we as students have the
power to speak for them."
SLAC plans on talking to and
presenting the petition today to
Stanford Management Company

President and CEO Mike McCaf
frey. Although the University has no
say in the labor contracts of their
subcontractors, Hernandez said that
she believes that the petition, which
has 223 signatures, could still have
an impact.
"The Stanford Management
Company, one of them being
President Hennessy, have a lot of
say in things as members of the
board, and we think that if we as
students show that we're interest-

Ed, they will have to take into ac
count what we think," Hernandez
said.
Helm is hoping that the Universi
ty will exert some influence on nego
tiations in favor of the workers' in
terests.
"The Stanford Community is the
client, and as consumers of the ser
vice should have a say on General
Electric's labor contract," he said.
As of late last night, negotiations
still had not concluded.
