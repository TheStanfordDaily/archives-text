# The 						Castro: A Halloween case study
## Intermission's inside scoop on how to be sketchy and safe 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jean Baudrillard, postmodernist
extraordinaire, admired women for
"having a privileged position in the
field of seduction, the symbolic
mastery of forms."
Mmmm ... sounds divine, Jean
darling, but clearly, you've never
been felt up by a flabby-chested
man wearing nothing but a gigantic,
safety-pinned diaper and a baby
bonnet. "Privileged position" in
deed! Even so, such surreally lech
erous incidents only happen but
once a year: Yep, on Halloween in
the Castro.
For women (and a few blatantly
attractive, pompadoured men), this
festive parade closely resembles a
gauntlet, full of anonymous ass
grabbers, who, feeling so gleefully
safe behind their masks, are just
waiting to strike ... But that's no
reason to stay at home! If Hal
loween done Castro-style is good
enough for shrieking, glittery trans
vestites, it's damn well good
enough for you. Besides, where else
can you get drunk and look like a
slut while roaming the city streets
without judgment? So go already,
hurry! Unless, of course, you want
to know how to get home with your
cell phone, girlfriend and ear drums
intact. In which case, read on:
Hi, I'm California! Tell me ...
what is this "public transportation"
of which you speak?
You're going to have to call
Super Shuttle, like right now, it's
the cheapest, safest way to get the
gaggle there and back. Oh fine,

here's the number, you lazyass:
(650) 558-8500.
I really cannot overemphasize
the importance of planning for the
return trip. As you very well know,
Caltrain is shit, the Marguerite is
Stanford's Free Shittle and neither
can be trusted to get you anywhere.
Ever.
The prospect of driving yourself
there is equally dubious, as it re
quires: (1) Nerves of steel; (2) Term
life, property, liability and disaster
insurance; and (3) Sobriety.

Heyyy, what's Snoop D-double-
G doing up in here?
Independent studies have deter
mined that 98 percent of all
women's Halloween costumes are
modified by the prefix "sexy" or
"naughty." Woo-hoo! Get skanky
while you're still young and hot, I
say! But unfortunately, you can't
wander around wearing garters and
a cottontail anywhere anymore
without getting harassed. Sigh.
Make sure to be on alert for am

ateur photographers and would-be
heirs to the "Girls Gone Wild"
throne. Last year I saw many a
Sketch-o trying to snap pictures up
girls' skirts or, even creepier, trying
to videotape up them. I swear
guys like this are personally respon
sible for Alanis Morissette's record
sales.
So, to foil those pervs, you'll
have to don full-coverage under
wear or, better yet, a pair of bike
shorts under your miniskirt. True,
grandma panties might not go so

well with the whole "Naughty
Nurse" ensemble, but if you want to
avoid seeing your cooter online for
"ONLY $9.95 A MONTH!!!"
you'll make the sacrifice.
And remember: When in dan
ger, get down on all fours and eat
grass.
If someone reeeeaally gross
starts rubbing up on you, a nice
hard elbow should box him out of
your zone while you pull a fast
break. (Don't you love how super
fluous sports terminology can in
stantly make you feel all sweaty
athletic? Whew I'm 'a burnin'
the calories as I type!)
Step back a second from a nasty
situation before you start throwing
punches though; remember, you
are not at Stanford some guys
out there will actually hit you back.
On a related note, last Hal
loween, I heard that four people got
stabbed or, as I prefer to say it,
"knifed." Proof positive that S.F.,
for all its pansexual splendor, has its
fair share of crazy-asses.
And children, don't forget, it's
better to be safe than sorry.
NEVER accept popped-topped
Snapples, candy, blood, neon con
doms, shiny apples, un-sexy drugs,
well-concealed cash, hickeys or
spare buttons from strange shit,
what am I saying? It's Halloween in
Castro, for chrissakes! Go
crazy! (Grab the cash and run as fast
as your little legs will take you.)
Happy Halloween!


Innocent girls at the Castro: Can you pick the man in the picture? Hint:: He stole his top from Modonna

ger, get down on all fours and eat
grass.
If someone reeeeaally gross
starts rubbing up on you, a nice
hard elbow should box him out of
your zone while you pull a fast
break. (Don't you love how super
fluous sports terminology can in
stantly make you feel all sweaty
athletic? Whew I'm 'a burnin'
the calories as I type!)
Step back a second from a nasty
situation before you start throwing
punches though; remember, you
are not at Stanford some guys
out there will actually hit you back.
On a related note, last Hal
loween, I heard that four people got
stabbed or, as I prefer to say it,
"knifed." Proof positive that S.F.,
for all its pansexual splendor, has its
fair share of crazy-asses.
And children, don't forget, it's
better to be safe than sorry.
NEVER accept popped-topped
Snapples, candy, blood, neon con
doms, shiny apples, un-sexy drugs,
well-concealed cash, hickeys or
spare buttons from strange shit,
what am I saying? It's Halloween in
Castro, for chrissakes! Go
crazy! (Grab the cash and run as fast
as your little legs will take you.)
Happy Halloween!


Innocent girls at the Castro: Can you pick the man in the picture? Hint:: He stole his top from Modonna
