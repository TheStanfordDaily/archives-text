# How to get your freaks on
## Intermission's guide to inventive Halloween costumes 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
So, you've finally made the big decision this year you're
going to the Castro. You've heard about it, thought about it,
maybe even dreamt about it, but one problem lingers that
age-old question of what to wear.
Well, you're in luck here for your very own browsing
pleasure is a compilation of some of the very finest ideas for
how to be fashionable, original and maybe a bit mischievous
this Halloween:
AOL / Microsoft: Cover your sweatsuit in CDs (hot glue)
and you're ready to monopolize the night away. You could also
combine this with an eye-patch and hat and be a software pi
rate. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.
Bubble gum: Go with me on this one pink sweat suit, ten
nis shoe tied to your head. It's that simple, and it's downright in
ventive.
Duct tape: It is possible to make a tube top and mini skirt out
of duct tape. Trust me (and my sketchy past) on that one. Just
make sure you make it double-sided.
Static Cling: Wear any kind of mismatched clothes, pin one
pant leg up, attach dryer sheets, socks, underwear, panty hose
and spike your hair up with gel and spray.

Lightning Victim: Carefully burn the edges of your best
hole-y old clothes. Then tease your hair so it sticks straight up,
smudge your face and arms with black or brown make-up.
Tornado: Smear gray or black make-up on your face. Dress
all in black and find a bunch of "miniatures" barnyard ani
mals, Hotwheel cars, tractors and houses to attach to your
clothes with string, glue and safety pins.
One Night Stand: The name in itself is such an appeal of the
costume. Get a large box and cut out a part for your head. Cover
it with some fabric (to resemble a tablecloth) and, glue gun in
hand, glue on items from a nightstand (an alarm clock, a small
lamp, plastic cups, books, cigarettes, condoms, candles, breath
mints, etc).
A Kissing Booth: Using two boxes, construct a booth with
the opening of the top box facing forward. Next add a couple of
straps, allowing the boxes sit on your shoulders. On the front
and sides of the boxes, add a sign that says "Kissing Booth," or
"Kissing Booth: $l."
Mr. Cupid: Two words "diaper" and "hearts." With a
makeshift diaper made of a sheet, and a few paper hearts
pinned on, all you need is a bow and arrow and you're ready for
romance.
Hell on Wheels: Dress as a devil and wear roller blades.

Self-Absorbed: Attach sponges all over your body.
Baked Potato: If you wear sweats and stuff them with pil
lows, you can wrap your outer layer in foil. Now you're fit to be
baked.
Chick Magnet: Attach Barbie dolls all over yourself.
French Kiss: After taking aluminum foil and padding to
fashion yourself into a giant Hershey's Kiss, top it off with a
French beret.
Philosophy professor: Got to Lytton Plaza. Offer to buy a
homeless man lunch if he will give you his dissheveled clothes.
Don't comb your hair for a week. You're done.
Fred Durst: Wear a red cap and... no, that's way too scary.
Deviled Egg: Dress as an egg all white sweats with yellow
fabric in the middle. Add a headband with horns.
Brick: Wear red.
Brick Layer: Refer to Brick.
Helen of Troy: Note: need to become most beautiful woman
in history. Also, if you can get some ships (thousands), that
would help.

going to the Castro. You've heard about it, thought about it,
maybe even dreamt about it, but one problem lingers that
