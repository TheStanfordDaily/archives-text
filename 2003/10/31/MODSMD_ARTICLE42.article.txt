# The 						Shins kick retro-rock up a notch
## 
### GREG LARSON SARA ROWGHANI 
"Chutes Too Narrow" is the follow-up to
The Shins' critically acclaimed "Oh, Inverted
World." Their pop-rock sound is at once simple
and complex, retro and modern, smart and po
etic as all hell. Sara Rowghani and Greg Larson
listened to it together and added their own com
mentary:
Sara: "Oh, Inverted World" was fucking
perfect. I was terrified that this would blow.
Greg: Yeah, it doesn't blow.
Sara: I thought they'd try new shit and mess
it up, or just clone the first one.
Greg: Yeah, this is good.
Sara: Follow-ups to good debuts are always
terrible.
Greg: They call it the "sophomore slump."
Sara: But this is good. They've jumped over
the slump.
Greg: Right over.
Sara: Actually, I've heard this record aptly
called their sophomore "hump."
Greg: I'll show you a hump ...
A Brief History of The Shins
Greg: The Shins are actually old guys. Not
youngster-fuckers of the NY/LA cock-rock
scene. They're not The Strokes or the 'Stripes,
full of instant thrills and a hyped-up hipster
image. These guys have been around.
Sara: But only as "The Shins" since 1997;
before that they were "Flake Music."
Greg: They're home-grown.
Sara: They're from Albuquerque - they
recorded "Chutes Too Narrow" in Mercer's
basement. It's nice to see solid songs come
from such humble sources.

Greg: They're from
damned New Mexico.
They probably have Kachi
na doll bobbleheads on the
dashes of their Grand-
Ams.

"Kissing the Lipless":
Greg: That's the coolest song title I have
ever heard.
Sara: Yeah. James Mercer, the frontman
and songwriter, is cool. And it's clear he's ma
tured. He is very good at poetry... and sound.
Poetry plus sound equals... He is good.
Greg: His vocal range is unbelievable.

Sara: "Oh, Inverted World" was more muf
fled. Here, he just belts it out.
Greg: He was filtered, distant-almost blend
ed-in with the music. Now his voice guides the
song. He skyrockets off melodies, unpre
dictably, and soars. He's more confident.

"Mine's Not A High
Horse":
Greg: Is that a
synth?!
Sara: Yes. It's gen
tle and nice. Did you know
the keyboardist's name was

Marty?
Sara: I have an Uncle Marty.
"Saint Simon":
Sara: "Saint Simon" is beautifully construct
ed. You'd never expect such a delicate hook to
be hidden behind the meandering intro.
Greg: You'd never guess what a gooey in
side it has.

Sara: It's like a Cadbury egg.
Greg: I love Easter.
Sara: I heart bunny-chickens. A lot. Hey, I
think Marty's the falsetto on this track.
Greg: Doesn't falsetto somehow derive
from "eunuch," those guys who cut off their
wankers to get a good tenor?
Sara: I think they call those guys "castrati,"
and oddly enough, women loved them. They
were like the "cream" of the crop... even
though they couldn't.
"Gone For Good":
Sara: This one's crazy; it sounds like country.
Greg: Very twangy. It's like they're cow
boys, singing 'round the campfire, the sun set
ting and a cactus swaying to the rhythm.
Sara: And s'mores.
Greg: S'mores?
Sara: They're good. What?
"Those to Come":
Sara: The last track on the album, and one of

their slowest and most harmonic. The guitar
tune rarely changes pitch or meter throughout.
Mercer's voice is held mostly on one note. It's
like the Beatles they were masters at songs
based around one note.
Greg: Most songs on "Chutes Too Narrow"
are built off of only one or two chords.
Sara: "Those to Come" has such a soft key
board sound. It's gentle, ending an album that's
anything but.
Greg: It fades-out slowly, with Mercer
whistling. It's like the song and album are com
pletely unwinding, like they're exhaling. It's
subdued, minimal. They create a somber, bleak
atmosphere.
Sara: But this is the end of an upbeat album
- "Chutes" is a field of sunflowers. The entire
CD begins with the whole band shouting
"WOO!" That makes me happy.
Greg: Me too.
Sara: And then, it ends in whistling.
Greg: I love the whistling.
Sara: Exactly.
