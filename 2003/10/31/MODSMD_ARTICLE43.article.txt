# 'Echoes' sure to en-Rapture audiences

### JULIAN WASS 
Remember that grade school teacher that you had who would
always pick on you in class and single you out for stuff that all the

other kids did too? Then you found out that it
wasn't because she didn't like you, but because
she liked you best of all and knew that you were
capable of special things.
This is how I feel about the Rapture.
No, it's not that I think The Rapture sound

like any of my grade school teachers (to be honest, their sound is
more Strokes-meet-Crosby-Stills-Nash-and-Young...don't ask).

Rather, I feel like every experience I have lis
tening to the Rapture, be it the "Out of the
Races" and " Onto the Tracks" EP or their live
performances leaves me wanting more. I'm
very critical of the Rapture because at their
best, they are an awesome disco-punk-electro
band that has released some of the coolest sin
gles of the last few years.

Rapture's "Echoes" is a mix of the same anticipation, elation
and frustration that has been the distinguishing characterstic of
the band's previous albums. "Echoes" opens strong with "Oho,"

which sounds like Robert Smith singing on an acid house track.
The second track, "Heaven," is also promising; it features the
Gang of Four style guitar squak that characterized The Rapture's
famous "Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks" single.

At this point, the album takes a turn. It's not necessarily a turn
for the worse, because "Open Up Your Heart" is not an entirely

bad song. It's a piano ballad, and maybe it's
a joke that I just don't get, but anyway you
cut it, it's not what I want from The Rapture.
It's pretty simple really. There are
plenty of shelves in the musical pantry where
I get my piano ballads, and The Rapture is
not the first one I would choose. The same is

true for their southern-rocker "Love is All". It's

a fine song, but I guarantee that there are better places to get your
southern rock than on a Rapture album.
As usual, New York electro-producers the DFA add their sig-

nature touches to the best songs on the album, which do outweigh
the weaker tracks. "I Need Your Love" is a pulsing, house track,
the kind that is the best to dance to. Both the electro funk of "The
Killing" and the motoring beat of "Sister Saviour" alone make
this album worth buying, but those two tracks are sidekicks to
the brilliantly deranged disco of "House of Jealous Lovers,"
which is rightfully the first single off of the album; it's the best
song on "Echoes" and the most memorable Rapture track
since "Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks."
The more I listen to complete Rapture albums, the
more I worry that their schizophrenic nature is a byproduct of an
ongoing battle between the band they were before they teamed
up with DFA and the band that the DFA wants them to be.
Maybe the band isn't even aware of this rift, and maybe I'm com
pletely wrong, but whenever I hear songs like "House of Jealous
Lovers" and "Sister Savior" next to "Love is All" and "Open Up
Your Heart", I have to wonder if there are multiple forces at
work.
"Echoes" isn't a perfect album but it's close. Unfortunately,
coming from a band like the Rapture, anything less than perfect
is a disappointment. I'm sorry Rapture. I'm only hard on you
because I really like you

u The Rapture is an awesome
disco-punk-electro band"
