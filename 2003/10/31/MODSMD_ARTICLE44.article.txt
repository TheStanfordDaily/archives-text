# Elliott Smith: 1969-2003
## 
### JOSHUA SMITH TAM VO 
"I'm in love with the world / Through the eyes of a girl"
His record label called him "his generation's most gifted singer-song
writer." Ben Folds called him a "pop god." Elliott Smith reserved,
closed-off, and contemplative simply let his music speak for itself.
"Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do?"
Smith's first album, "Roman Candle," was recorded on four tracks
in his basement. As with all of his following albums, his voice was si
multaneously strained and airy. The words came out with ease, yet the
listener could never fully comprehend the strength needed to produce
them. The lyrics swelled naturally, clearly saturated with regret, sadness
and jealousy. The delicate plucking of his guitar melded seamlessly with
his melancholic voice. His songs were a fusion of vocals, words, and
music that went together perfectly.
"Everything means nothing to me"
Nominated for an Academy Award for the song "Miss Misery" from
"Good Will Hunting," his defeat at the hands of "My Heart Will Go
On" was emblematic; he hadn't even washed his hair that day. His pop
ularity was never greater. The next album, his major label debut "XO"
was his best-selling work, incorporating more intricate instrumentation
and complex harmonies that evoked The Beatles and Beach Boys. The
next go-round, 2000's "Figure 8" was even more elaborate, drawing
comparisons to "Pet Sounds" praise that the humble musician was
loath to accept. Recorded with a backing band, these two albums con
tained a lighter, more optimistic feel that was nonetheless colored by the
same forlorn ambiguity of his previous efforts. Smith was never one to
use albums as a diary; even so, the hauntingly dark subject matter of his
songs came across as too honest to have been forced. It was this honesty
more than anything that made the listener feel like his friend.
"Now I'm leaving you alone /
You can do whatever the hell you want to"
Smith's unfinished final album, "From a Basement on the Hill" was
originally slated for release in the spring 0f2002, but ran into chronic de
lays. He was to play all the instruments in the mold of 1997's "either/or."
"I feel more like I felt then," noted Smith. He eventually made a deal
with his record company to have the album released by an indie-label of
his own choosing. He never made the selection.
"Told me not to worry /
You were just a shooting star"
Smith's music and his influence continues to live on in sad-core acts
like Dashboard Confessional (pre-sellout) and Bright Eyes, both croon
ers whose accounts of mangled emotions sound trite and contrived
when compared to Smith's poetry. Since his tragic passing, Smith's
music has taken on an eerie quality and added meaning. Songs about
heroin addiction, alcoholism, self-loathing and heartbreak were whis
pered with a frailty that now sounds foreboding. His song "Needle in the
Hay" plays as the background to Luke Wilson's chilling suicide attempt
in "The Royal Tenenbaums."
"I'm never gonna know you now /
But I'm gonna love you anyhow"
The most touching, honest art seems to emanate from the depths of in
describable pain. Smith's voice always sounded as if it never made it
through the minefield of his personal demons unscathed. True genius is
often misunderstood. I listen to "Say Yes" on repeat, and try as I might,
I never fully grasp the emotions behind the lyrics. Optimism is born,
then crushed: "A happy day / And then you pay," only to return "the
morning after." But Smith will not return.
