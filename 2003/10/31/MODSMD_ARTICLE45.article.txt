# Nikolais: A Dancing-Fool Resurrected
## 
### NICHOLAS CASEY 
I'll admit just a little bias when it comes to people with
monikers like Nikolais. But then, we all know that Nicholas
- and all derivations thereof - is the finest name in exis

tence. This simply leaves us
with the question of whether
Friday night's Alwin Nikolais
Dance Theatre performance in
Memorial Auditorium lived up
to that, very highly outstanding
of names.
You can answer this by look
ing into your heart and asking if
you truly love amoebas chang
ing into people to the tunes of
music you swear sounds like
something the Jetsons once
played in their living room. Still
unsure? Try picturing a dozen-

odd dancers parading across the stage while harnessed to
birthday streamers of unimaginable proportion, like it was
any other day. Like the specter of Cirque du Soleil unteth
ered in some imaginary realm, Nikolais Dance Theatre re
minded folks last Friday night that aesthetics on crack were
pioneered in the USA long before they met the ever-pop
ular circus of the sun. And it was absolutely wonderful.
Anyone who dances knows Nikolais' antics. He was the
old fellow with the jet-white hair who put people in ridicu
lous get-ups and made something beautiful. The man
choreographed dances. Then he designed the costumes.
Then he composed the music. Then he built his slides and
projected them onto the company. When Nikolais died
from cancer in 1993, dance didn't just lose a great choreog
rapher, it lost a geological force.
For the next ten years the Martian amoebae, the im

probable streamers, and the Moog synthesizer would re
main for the most part collecting dust somewhere in the
East, while the original Nikolais Dance Theatre folded and
the dance world moved on. But now, a decade after Niko
lais' passing, the traditions of his school have been revived

and brought to Stanford on their
national tour.
Nikolais' choreography played
with people in the same way a pi
anist plays with the keys on a key
board-not for the singular emo
tions of each, but as a tool for some
larger, impossible visual effect.
"Noumenon Mobilus" was the in
famous saga of the prokaryotes
where two men encapsulated in
satin sacks radiated colors as they
developed, quite Darwinianly into
more humanoid forms. In "Blank
on Blank," Nikolais plays the ni-

hilist game like any good modern man, and a stage covered
in white figures becomes the scene for the endless repeti
tion of tumbles and cartwheels.
But this emphasis on color, costuming, light and staging
almost competing with the poor dancers themselves-was
what Nikolais' choreography was about. The show made
the case in point that he was indeed the ultimate control
freak. Recalling a past life in the marionette industry,
Nikolais once said, "I learned a lot from those puppets.
They are all motion and no nerves. I found out that art is
motion, not emotion."
Emotional or not, amid cheers and a standing ovation,
the old choreography from the dancing maestro was re
vived. Dancing seemed to share much with painting that
night, where, as one of the choreographers called it, "bod
ies work like a canvas for the light."
