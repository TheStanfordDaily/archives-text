# RZA raps like a pauper, not a 'Prince'
## 
### TRACY OLIVER 
"Birth of a Prince" is reminiscent of an older era of
rap: Simplistic beats and unremarkable lyrics for the
most part permeate the entire album. Only it's not so
good. Known as the "Wu-Tang Architect," the RZA is
most notable for his contribution to Wu-Tang's "Enter
the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)," a CD that without his
input would have become a disc full of talented rappers
and lyricists lacking direction. Thus, fans of Wu-Tang will
probably appreciate the "demo tape" quality of this CD,
but those listeners who have become accustomed to
"tight" beats, innovative lyrics and catchy hooks will find

at most one or two songs that
they can listen to all the way
through.
The intro song actually sets a
good tone for the album, but
that is primarily because of a
catchy sample from a female vo
calist who concludes with the
words: "It's a new dawn, it's a
new day, it's a new life for me,"
acurrately describing the theme
and title of the album. The rap
entrance into this intro song is
poorly transitioned, however, as
the vocalist abruptly ends with-

out warning and the rap melody begins with an entirely

different tempo and beat.
Following the intro, "The Grunge"
sounds as if the RZA took samples of
the television show "Cops" to create a
mixture of sirens, squealing tires and
other random unidentifiable noises.
The second verse is broken down sim
ply to the bass line and the RZA's

voice and as soon you try to enjoy the song, it's over. At
1:56, it is even shorter than the intro and arguably has no
purpose on the album.

Ol'Dirty Bastard, a favorite in the rap world, is heard
on the chorus of "We Pop," a song whose beat is similar
to P. Diddy's "Badboy for Life." This song may be one of
the better tracks on the album as ShaCronz and Freemur
da make good cameos.
"Grits" features an unnamed singer who sounds simi
lar to Wyclef Jean. This track's slower tempo provide a lit
tle diversity in the mix, while the lyrics on this track delve
into the poverty of the RZA's childhood. The song may
be appealing to new listeners as it is reminiscent of the
southern style of Nappy Roots.
"Fast Cars" turns the focus and sound into a different
direction. The singing on the hook is definitely unre-

markable, but the RZA track takes
a simple loop of four single piano
keys and layers it with horn stabs,
drum beats and lyrics, creating a de
cent product. Ghostface Killah is
featured in a verse, which combined
with RZA's outro, may remind fans
of the early music of the Wu-Tang
Clan.
"A Day to God is 1,000
Years" may be the only other at
tempt the RZA makes at establish
ing himself as a decent lyricist. This
song provides the much needed
depth in thought that is definitely

void on tracks such as "Drink, Smoke, + Fcuk."

Musically, "Birth of a Prince"
doesn't hit many right notes and only
makes the occasional step in the right
direction. Also, unlike his former al
bums, the RZA is definitely the star
and those looking for frequent
cameos from Wu-Tang members will

be disappointed. Unfortunately for the
RZA, there are no songs that have striking crossover or
mainstream appeal, which will inherently limit his expo
sure.

"This album is
reminiscent of
an older era of
rap, except it's
not as good."
