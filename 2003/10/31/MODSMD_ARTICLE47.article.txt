# Godot never comes, play never delivers
## 
### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
The staging of "Waiting for Godot" at
the Geary Theatre can be described by
the most banal of adjectives: OK. The
play written by Samuel Beckett is
itself a classic; rich and hilarious, it was
unique when first published in 1953. It's
for this reason that just about any pro
duction of "Waiting for Godot" is worth
seeing. Unfortunately, American Con
servatory Theatre's (A.C.T.) production
leaves a fair amount to be desired.
Beckett's play is a great work of ab
surdism absurdism being (the post-
World War II precursor to post-mod
ernism that you may know from read
ing lonesco's "Rhinoceros" in high
school French class.)
Beckett, an Irishman who expatriat
ed to France and won the Nobel Prize in
1969, wrote almost all of his works in
both French and English. Generally
and correctly "Godot" is read as a
play that plumbs the depths of modern
emptiness, and, like all of Beckett's

plays, and it contains both witty dia
logue and moments of pathos.
The premise of the play is simple:
Two men, Vladimir and Estragon, wait
at "A country road. A tree," for a man
called Godot, who never comes.
But simple does not mean surrealis
tically bare, as J.B. Wilson, set designer
for the A.C.T. production, seems to be
lieve. The set is framed (at an angle) by
a painted replica of the stage's perma
nent gilt border; I fear it's supposed to
be "meta-theatrical." The play's road
has become a wooden construction
whose industrial smoothness and
bleachedness smacks more of HGTV
than Beckett's mind. The gray back
ground looks like an overblown swatch
of kitchen Formica, and the white-spot
light moon looks like the setting for a
shadow-puppet extravaganza.
Peter Frechette plays Vladimir as
openly homosexual a possible but
by no means clear interpretation.
Frechette is, in any case, the source of
energy in this show; his sweat drips

throughout the performance. Gregory
Wallace plays Estragon with an attempt
at the kind of pathos the character
needs, and Steven Anthony Jones as
Pozzo is the most magnetic of the cast,
with a voice that is rich and delicious.
But in the end, the characters lose
much of the confusing, contradicting
ambiguity that is key to the play; direc
tor Carey Perloff (A.C.T.'s artistic di
rector) seems to push each of the char
acters into a set of affectations and
mannerisms that strips them of their
elusiveness. The result is a significant
drop in laughter: The play can (and
should) be relentlessly funny, but
Wednesday night's performance was
intermittent at best.
