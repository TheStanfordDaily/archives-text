# Roxy scores...even without the base system!

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
There are few concepts that Stanford students enjoy dis
cussing more than the Ã¼biquitous "hook-up." And yet, amidst
all this casual usage, does anyone know what this term really
encompasses? When you say you "hooked-up" with Mr.
Sigma Chi, do you mean: a) you felt his dance floor woody
rubbing up on your thigh; b) you performed mouth to south
resuscitation in the privacy of the "penthouse" with five of his
brothers watching intently; or c) you rode him with a strap on
dildo nicknamed "Big Pete" as he rubbed you down with liq
uefied vitamin E? I want to know if you got some and exact
ly how much you got (up till two decimal places). Last week,
Roxy set out to reinvent the phrase "hooking-up" forever.
Spread the word, dear readers: Saying you "hooked-up" is
out. Like the fat kid in dodgeball. Like a boner in sweatpants.
I know what you're thinking. "But Roxy, why not turn to
the age old wisdom of the base system?" Ah yes, the age-old
wisdom of the base system, ingrained in our horny little minds
since the childhood years. Last I checked, first base meant
kissing; second was groping; third was oral and a home run
always translated into a good old-fashioned fuck. But where

does this leave everything else? The sweet in-betweens of
digital stimulation? The awkward eagerness of the dry
hump? Depending on whom you ask, even the base system
remains vague, leaving gaping holes in tales of (possibly) sex
ual exploits.
Frankly, everyone has different standards of what consti
tutes a hook-up. I think we can all agree that anything before
and up to kissing (i.e. hand holding and hugging) isn't much
to get excited about unless your father's name is Jebediah and
you leave verses from Mathew 2:36 on your away messages.
But putting that aside for the moment, there remains a
panoply of sexual activity just waiting to be categorized. Just
imagine, there could be a whole new set of sexual standards,
modeled on the universality of old favorites like the periodic
table and the metric system. Right here, right now, why don't
we reinvent the bases in order to create a more comprehen
sive system of relaying dirty details the morning after? Why
don't we take all the guesswork that goes into uncovering and
revealing juicy tidbits and replace them with simple symbols
and equations?
It was with such noble exhortations in mind that Roxy
began her first rating system:
(1) - Kissing without tongue

(2) - French kissing
(3) - Fondling over the clothes.
(4) - Fondling under clothes and/or naked dry humping.
(5) - Digital stimulation
(6)...
At that point Roxy could go no further: She realized that
she'd be thinking of fellatio every time she saw the number 6
and that she'd have to drop her Math major in a fit of sexual
frenzy. In fact, with a list like this, we might as well say: Good
bye privacy and free will, hello sexual fascism. We might as
well wear aluminum spacesuits and surrender ourselves to an
inevitable police state in which every move is noted and
recorded.
Sure, it sounds extreme. But I don't think I'm exaggerat
ing when I say that defining the hook-up is one step away
from a totalitarian regime of sexual categorization. And what
about that one sorority sister who absolutely insists on draw
ing out all the details? Sounds an awful lot like Big Brother if
you ask me. There's nothing wrong with a little mystery, with
raised eyebrows and pursed lips. As interesting as it is to hear
about your friends' raunchy exploits, it's always a hell of a lot
more interesting to engage in your very own. Just ask Roxy.
