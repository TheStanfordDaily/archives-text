Stanford placed sixth in The Atlantic Monthly's first annual rank
ing of the top 50 schools, falling behind MIT, Princeton, Cal Tech,
Yale and Harvard, in that order.
The magazine based its rankings solely on "selectivity," which in
cluded data such as simple admission rates and the academic achieve
ment of each school's freshman class.
"I don't think that rankings do students a service," said Dean of
Admissions Robin Mamlet. "Rankings, of course, sell magazines, and
we've become a culture that wants to know what is best. Unfortunate
ly, when this comes to colleges, it's not always in a student's best in
terest to ask which college is best. Students can become so busy look
ing at which college is best that they often neglect to ask which college
is best for them."
The Atlantic Monthly defended the relevancy of the article, pub
lished earlier this month.
"The main point about our rankings is that they are not rankings in
the U.S. News [& World Report] sense," said James Fallows, national
correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and author of one of the col
lege rankings articles. "We do not claim for one second that schools
that are higher on this list are in any way better than those lower on the
list."
Mamlet still disapproved of The Atlantic Monthly's ranking and
defended Stanford's admissions process.
"Ranking a school solely on selectivity data, as the Atlantic Month
ly just did, is particularly irresponsible journalism," she said. "Would
Stanford actually be a better institution if we had admitted those ap
plicants with uniformly higher test scores and grades who in fact were
in our applicant pool, but who sometimes were passed over for stu
dents we found more compelling overall, and who now are in our class
but who had lower stats? I don't think this would make us a better
school."
Magazine rankings of colleges have become very popular in recent
years, with the U.S. News & World Report lists in September that an

nually attract media attention.
U.S. News & World Report approaches the ranking system differ
ently from The Atlantic Monthly. The U.S. News & World Report
rankings are based on retention of students, faculty resources, gradu
ation rate, alumni giving, student selectivity and assessment of the
school by administrators from other institutions. Stanford fell from
fourth to fifth on this year's U.S. News & World Report list, while Har
vard and Princeton tied for number one.
Many Stanford students said that magazine rankings did not affect
where they wanted to apply when they were going through the college
application process.
"I didn't really consider the rankings of schools in my application
process because these lists seem so arbitrary," said sophomore Tory
Brooks. "They might help you determine what schools you would be
a good candidate for; however, they don't necessarily tell you anything
about whether the school will be a good match for you." Brooks ap
plied as an early decision applicant after considering majors, extracur
ricular activities, housing, location, composition of the student body
and the atmosphere of several schools.
However, other students admitted that they used various rankings
of schools to decide where they wanted to apply. Joe Shermetaro, a se
nior, said he looked at college rankings from several sources published
over a couple of years.
"School rankings, such as the one done by U.S. News, played a big
part in the college application process for me and definitely impacted
the decisions I made regarding which schools I chose to apply to," he
said.
Mamlet said she believes that Stanford's popularity and the num
ber of students who apply this year will not be affected by The Atlantic
Monthly ranking.
The issue with the rankings included several articles relating to its
rankings in which it examined several issues regarding the college ap
plication and admission process.
Rounding out the top ten of The Atlantic Monthly's list were Co
lumbia, Penn, Brown and Swarthmore.
