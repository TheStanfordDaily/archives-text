## Down at the Heels Lady techies aren't bridging the gap: Few Stanford women choose to enter technical fields, and those who do earn less than their male counterparts. 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
West campus is known to many as the engineering side of Stanford
home to the new Clark Center, high-tech laboratories and enough
testosterone to make an NFL locker room look like a Tupperware party.
With huge gender disparities in both its faculty and its student body, is
the School of Engineering turning into a regular good ol' boys club?
More importantly, why are the percentages of women in engineering
so low here on the Farm? Touted as one of the most progressive top-tier
universities in the nation, one would think Stanford would be strides
ahead of other institutions, turning out a sizable crop of women gradu
ates in the technical sciences. But this just isn't the case the Univer
sity continues to outpace national trends only slightly.
The facts are these: Women currently make up only 6 percent of the
University's engineering faculty, including assistant, associate, full and
emerita professors. The female faculty members are commonly found
in the Management, Science and Engineering department. The chemi
cal engineering department boasts a whopping two female professors,
and the Materials Science and Engineering sector is entirely male.
Overall, 43 percent of departments on campus still have no tenured
women. By the year 2000,41 percent of departments had never hired or
promoted a female assistant professor. Even as of March of this year,
379 faculty members were women, compared to a staggering 1,335 men.
This gap has caused enough concern to merit several gender equality
studies conducted by the Provost's Advisory Committee on the Status
of Women. It's no secret that gender representation especially in the
technical fields is one of Stanford's biggest challenges.
However, Stanford is not alone. According to the Society of Women
Engineers, in 1998 only 20 percent of undergraduate students and 12
percent of doctoral students in engineering programs across the coun
try were female. To add a real-world perspective to the issue, only 11
percent of the nationwide engineering workforce was female in 1999.
"The numbers show that the percentage of women falls off incre
mentally at each level," says Jim Plummer, dean of the School of Engi
neering. "The percentage of women faculty in these fields is smaller
than the percentage of [doctoral] graduates, which is smaller than the
percentage of [master's] students, which is smaller than the percentage
of undergraduates who are women."

Even when women manage to land jobs at competitive firms, they
generally make less money than their male peers. Statistics show that
the difference between female and male salaries in these fields actually
increases over time. For example, according to SWE, five years after
graduation a man will likely make $45,000 annually, whereas his female
colleague's salary will average $42,000. Thirty years after earning a de
gree, a man will probably take home $70,000, while a woman will only
make $60,000.
"I find that being a woman in a male-dominated profession is a dou
ble-edged sword," says Andrea Goldsmith, an associate professor of
electrical engineering. "Women stand out, so if I make a mistake or my
work doesn't measure up, people remember so those standards are a bit
harsher for women. On the other hand, if I do something really great,
that also stands out and is remembered."
The lack of women in the sciences has prompted national organiza
tions to investigate exactly why this phenomenon occurs. Some psy
chologists have suggested that girls are socialized to believe that science
(and even academia in some extreme cases) is unfeminine as early as
middle school. Others have postulated that girls are simply more likely
to gravitate toward humanities-based subjects.
"I do not believe that women are consciously discouraged from ca
reers in [technical] fields," Plummer says. "Many factors contribute, in
cluding inadequate numbers of mentors at all levels and inadequate sci
ence and math instruction at the middle school and high school levels."
Junior Jen Wang, an officer in Stanford's SWE chapter, says that
the region in which a girl is raised may have a strong influence on her
decision to pursue the technical sciences. The daughter of Silicon Val
ley engineers, Wang says she always felt supported in math and sci
ence classes. But she realizes that her peers from more traditional
parts of the country might have been dissuaded from these subjects
from an early age.
"I think the root of the problem is in social conditioning," she said.
"It's kind of hard at the age of 20 to suddenly gain an aptitude and in
terest for something as difficult as engineering if you weren't exposed
to it before."
Goldsmith, who says she was definitely intimidated by the sparse
number of women in her engineering classes at UC-Santa Barbara,
agrees that it's incredibly hard for many women to succeed in technical
fields, regardless of their enthusiasm and work ethic.

"I don't think there is a lot of encouragement for women to study en
gineering, be it from family members, high school or college counselors,
especially women who are not at the top of their class in math and sci
ence," she says. "This is really unfortunate."
Female students who wish to pursue engineering beyond an un
dergraduate degree face an intensified set of challenges. Goldsmith
says the dwindling number of female doctoral students may likely be
attributed to the desire to settle down and start a family rather than
fight for tenure.
"There is also a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem," she points out.
"Since there are few women faculty in engineering, graduate students
view academia as unfriendly to women. I think women see the poten
tially negative sides of academia long hours, high competition, in
fighting without being aware of all the positive sides like intellectual
freedom, flexibility and working closely with students."
SWE President Katie Hammond, a senior, says that some Stanford
professors make obvious attempts to encourage female students.
"There is a fine line between making students feel respected and dis
missed," she said. "Professors who draw attention to gender by always
saying 'he or she' rather than the traditional 'he' do well to make stu
dents feel recognized as a viable presence, but it can also make us feel
uncomfortable since we are clearly being singled out as different from
our male peers."
Wang backs this up, adding that academic competition in the en
gineering departments appears to be the same for both men and
women. In fact, she says that many of the male students in her class
es make a point of declaring themselves less competent than their fe
male classmates.
"I believe there are some good programs in place to encourage
women students in science and engineering, both graduate and un
dergraduate," says Goldsmith. "But these programs are typically di
rected at women that have already decided they are interested in en
gineering. The best encouragement [comes from] women faculty as
mentors and role models."
Plummer adds: "The percentages of women students and faculty
members in engineering at Stanford is among the highest of engineer
ing schools in the nation, but they are still far below what they should be.
Engineering is not intrinsically a male profession and we need to do bet
ter at encouraging women to consider careers in these fields."

Even the bridge to the Science and Engineering Quad denies access to women who want to study the hard sciences. At left, a sign warns women that high heels may get stuck in the thin
grating spanning an access road. Many women complain about the bridge's design, and the gender insensitivity it implies.
