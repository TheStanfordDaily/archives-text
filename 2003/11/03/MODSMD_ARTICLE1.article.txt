# Bone marrow drive garners high turnout
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
The Lambda Phi Epsilon fraternity's annual
blood typing drive, held last Thursday and Fri
day in White Plaza, attracted 547 participants
three times higher than last year's turnout
reflecting the success of the fraternity's cam
paign to get the word out about the drive.
This year's drive was held in the name of
Chloe Chang, the daughter of History Prof.
Gordon Chang and Vicki Sandin, who are the
resident fellows in Castano. Chloe, who is 21
months old, suffers from leukemia and is in
need of a bone marrow transplant, but because
she is biracial child it will be difficult to find her
a match.
Junior Connie Chan, a focus assistant in
Castano who helped in last week's efforts, said
the drive's organizers put forth an extra push to
raise awareness before this year's drive by
printing color flyers, launching an e-mail pub
licity campaign, contacting alumni and schools
around the country and printing two local ad
vertisements.
"I think the drive was a great success not
only because we typed over 500 people, but be
cause despite the rain, freezing weather and a
long waiting line on Friday, hundreds of stu
dents took the time to make a difference,"
Chan said.
The focus of the effort was to register more
people, particularly underrepresented minori
ties, on the national database of potential
donors.
"The turnout was tremendous, and we
thank the Lambdas, the many other great vol
unteers and potential donors," Chang said.
"Vicki and I are encouraged and know that the
drive will make a difference for Chloe possibly
and for others certainly. It was very emotional
for us when we visited the typing center to see
all the heroes and heroines waiting in line to get
tested."
The matching results of the drive will not be
known for four to six weeks.
Kenneth Lee, public relations coordinator
for the Lambdas, said external factors may
have decreased turnout.
"We were initially expecting more people to
get typed on Friday, but the rain and cold re
duced our turnout," Lee said. "Also, for most
of Friday, we were one phlebotomist short,
causing a huge logjam."
Chang expressed a more positive outlook.
"The turnout was super, especially when
one considers the short amount of time there
was to organize it and the very unhelpful
weather on Friday," he said.
"In the past, we have only had funding to
type minorities," Chan said. "This year, thanks
to several private donations, we were able to
type many Caucasian students for free."
However, some students, like sophomore
Gillian Quandt, were turned away from the
drive.
"I went to the blood drive on Friday, and I
