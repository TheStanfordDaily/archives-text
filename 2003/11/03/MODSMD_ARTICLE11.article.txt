Campus commentary on
campustrufh.org's ads

Is this some sick joke? Or is
The Daily so naive as to think that
a "paid advertisement. . . does
not necessarily reflect the views of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, its Board members,
employees, or editorial board?"
Are you trying to aggravate us
students into writing in letters of
complaint about the extremist
campustruth.org adverts?
Or do you simply not check the
background of organizations pay
ing you?
Perhaps you can argue that
there is truth in the campus
truth.org adverts, but honestly,
have you been to their Web site?
Very scary (very apt for Hal
loween?).
I understand that you may
need to take paid adverts to pro
duce The Daily, but there should
be screening of where these ad
verts come from and what they
are saying. Would it be OK for
me to enter an advert saying,
"The Israeli government regular
ly kills innocent Palestinians?"
Or perhaps advertise a Web site
outlining all the horrible human
rights abuses committed by the
Israeli government on the Pales
tinians?
The Daily needs to understand
that it is a student newspaper
aimed at the entire student body,
and thus, it is wrong to alienate
certain groups through the ad
verts it publishes.
If you want to highlight an
issue, then do that in an article and
take the credit do it via an ad
vert and claim that it doesn't rep
resent your viewpoint.
The editors of this newspaper
should apologize to everyone who
they have offended with this ad
vert, and while they are at it, they
should bring back the "World and
Nation" section so that us stu
dents get a fair and balanced view
of what is happening in the out
side world, not the biased campus
truth.org view.

Earlier I acknowledged The
Daily as an organization that fos
tered and celebrated the diversity
on this campus. As a senior who
takes pride in this institution, I am
deeply hurt and disappointed by
The Daily's decision to publish
the recent flurry of ads from cam
pustruth.org. I am not alone in ex
pressing shock at The Daily's re
cent cultural and ethnic insensitiv
ity. Being a person who has been a
victim of racial and ethnic profil
ing and continues to be so I
am disappointed that The Daily
has chosen to endanger and iso
late a significant portion of the
campus population.
SYED IMRAN MOINUDDIN

I am shocked that The Daily
posted a second CampusTruth.org
ad after the outpour of negative
feeling from the University com
munity. The ad was met with virtu
ally nothing but criticism; it hurt
spme, it angered others and many
found it to be completely inappro
priate. This leads me to believe
that either The Daily has a politi
cal agenda, in which case The
Daily is no longer worth reading,
or that The Daily is so starved for
money that they'll take ads from
anybody, in which case The Daily
is using its $1 million budget ex
tremely poorly.
I do hope that the latter is the
case, because I think it would be a
shame for one of the leading (in
dependent, may I remind you?)
student newspapers to lose its
journalistic objectivity that for
which The Daily so violently criti
cized the Stanford Review not so
long ago.
To be fair, I notice that you in
cluded a little footnote this time
around, which was not present last
time: "This is a paid advertise
ment and does not necessarily re
flect the views of the Stanford
Daily ..." Does this mean that, in
theory, I could publish an ad ad
vticating neo-Nazism, an extreme
racist group or an ad demanding
immediate death of all Ameri
cans? If I paid you enough money,
would you add that too?

Advertisements are typically
made to sell a produce or idea.
The ads by campustruth.org re
cently airing in The Daily are no
different; they sell the idea that
Palestinians are terrorists and
murderers. By running these ads,
The Daily is sending the message
that it considers this a legitimate
idea to sell.
If The Daily wishes to continue
to advance this portrayal of Pales
tinians, then by all means, it
should continue to run these ads.
However, if not, I would question
the merit of making The Daily a

Anderson and Huggins
wrong on resources

In Friday's Op-Ed piece ("What
does sustainable growth mean?"
Oct. 31), Terry Anderson and
Laura Huggins appear to try and
dispel the "myth" that there are ac
tual, finite limits to resources. They
imply that a decreased rate of con
sumption brought about by conser
vation is equivalent to a decrease in
scarcity. Although I'm not an
economist, in the universe with
which I am familiar, a decreasing
rate of consumption does not cre
ate new resources. Perhaps it will
take a generation or two longer to
run out, but there is still the same
limit on consumable materials. An
economy based on growth will
sooner or later be unable to contin
ue growth, either from a scarcity of
raw materials or a limit to the num
ber of possible consumers.
Sustainability is not some ethe
real concept. Populations of bac
teria grow until they reach the lim
its of the least-available nutrient,
and then their population levels
off. The population will then re
main in equilibrium with their en
vironment. Anderson and Hug
gins' proposed definition of sus
tainability "a call to maximize
human welfare" misses the
point entirely. Sustainability is a
function of the ability to maintain
equilibrium between available re
sources and the rate of consump
tion. It is not solely a question of
human welfare, but rather a func
tion of the ability to maintain a
population indefinitely. Even if
we decrease the rate of consump
tion, we will eventually reach the
end of supply if resources are non
renewable.
To scoff at the idea of sustain
ability belies an underlying agen
da that I perceive in many writings
from the Hoover Institution: Eco
nomic growth is the appropriate
goal of our economic and political
system. Then they throw in a dose
of "respect for the rule of law and
property rights." These will only
apply if the laws and distribution
of property are fair and just. They
do not in and of themselves guar
antee a system that allows all
members an equal chance at pros

SAT article poorly titled

I'm disappointed by the mis
leading subtitle for last Wednes
day's Features piece on the SATs
("The ABCs of SATs," Oct. 29).
The article, originally published in
The Daily Bruin under a different
title and subtitle, provides no sup
port for The Daily's statement
that "there is little correlation be
tween standardized test scores
and success in college." In fact, the
article acknowledges that the
SAT, while not the sole predictor
of future success, is one important
factor.
The article discusses a study at
UC-Berkeley, which found that
students admitted to that school
despite low SAT scores "are gen
erally successful in school," there
by making the case for a compre
hensive review process in college
admissions. Published with the
subtitle "Test scores don't neces
sarily predict success, new evalua
ton [sic] posits," the article raises
the valid point that SAT scores
cannot predict the success or fail
ure of every single student.
However, this fact does not in
any way refute the existence of a
correlation between scores on the
test and academic performance. A
positive correlation would imply
that overall, American students
with higher SAT scores tend to ex
hibit more success than those with
lower scores. If Berkeley admitted

a random group of students and
compared success to SAT scores,
then a study could evaluate
whether or not a correlation ex
ists. However, due to the fact that
all accepted students passed a rig
orous admissions process, those
with lower SAT scores do not con
stitute an accurate reflection of
the low-scoring population at
large.
By printing a misleading state
ment in large bold letters as a sub
title to a legitimate article, The
Daily has misled everyone who
scanned over that subtitle without
reading the article. I don't know if
The Daily as an institution be
lieves that the SATs are irrele
vant, but if so, it should reserve
such judgments for the Opinions
page.

The Atlantic's college rankings
misrepresented

Perhaps it would behoove you
to read an article before printing a
front-page story on it ("Stanford
ranked 6th by magazine," Oct.
31). The Atlantic Monthly's 30-
plus-page piece on colleges focus
es on debunking college rankings,
not promoting them. The selectiv
ity index is only used to support an
article saying that selectivity
means very little that it has a
"fetishistic" appeal, but should
not predominate in a prospective
freshman's decision for choosing a
college. In fact, the only source of
"irresponsible journalism" as
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet puts it in the
article, is The Daily itself for writ
ing an article about a subject it
clearly did no research on.

Racial remarks at show
inappropriate

While I was impressed with
some of the performances at the
Diwali Dhamaka show Saturday
night, I was very offended and dis
appointed by some of the com
ments made by the show's emcees.
On two occasions, one of the em
cees used stereotypical comments
about "white people" to get
laughs. Not only were these re
marks wholly unnecessary, they
had the effect of alienating many
of the white (and non-white)
members of the audience most
of whom were there to learn about
Diwali, support friends who were
in the show and enjoy a night of
Indian culture and entertainment.
As a dorm staff member who en
couraged some of his residents to
come to the show and as a mem
ber of the Indian community at
Stanford, I was embarrassed that
such comments were made.
Furthermore, I found the fic
tional "plot" behind the show de
meaning. It was based on the
premise that a person can be
"whitewashed" or labeled as an
ABCD (American Born Con
fused Desi) in the Indian-Ameri
can community. The term "white
washed" alone is insulting, regard
less of what culture or ethnicity
one identifies with. Culture is not
something we are painted with;
rather, it is something internal and
deeply personal. Cultural identity
can be a sensitive and difficult
topic for many people, especially
members of a diaspora born or
raised in a foreign country. There
is no such thing as "not being Indi
an enough," and it is equally
ridiculous to call someone "not
black enough" or "not Asian
enough." Treating the issue of cul
tural identity with such broad gen
eralizations and callousness does
a disservice to everyone.
It disappoints me that a show
like Diwali Dhamaka can't just be
a time to celebrate a culture with
out placing it in context of or in
opposition to another culture or
people. It also bothers me, as an
Indian raised in America, that
there is a prevalent attitude that
bhangra, Hindi films, spicy Indian
food and flashy clothing make
someone Indian. These are impor
tant facets of Indian culture and
things that should be celebrated
and respected. However, being
Indian as with any identity
is about how you feel and act, re
gardless of who you are, where
you were born, where you shop or
how you talk.

Racial remarks at show
inappropriate

While I was impressed with
some of the performances at the
Diwali Dhamaka show Saturday
night, I was very offended and dis
appointed by some of the com
ments made by the show's emcees.
On two occasions, one of the em

about "white people" to get
laughs. Not only were these re
marks wholly unnecessary, they
had the effect of alienating many
of the white (and non-white)
members of the audience most
of whom were there to learn about
Diwali, support friends who were
in the show and enjoy a night of
Indian culture and entertainment.
As a dorm staff member who en
couraged some of his residents to
come to the show and as a mem
ber of the Indian community at
Stanford, I was embarrassed that
such comments were made.
Furthermore, I found the fic

premise that a person can be
"whitewashed" or labeled as an
ABCD (American Born Con

can community. The term "white
washed" alone is insulting, regard
less of what culture or ethnicity
one identifies with. Culture is not
something we are painted with;
rather, it is something internal and
deeply personal. Cultural identity
can be a sensitive and difficult
topic for many people, especially
members of a diaspora born or

It disappoints me that a show

out placing it in context of or in

there is a prevalent attitude that
bhangra, Hindi films, spicy Indian
food and flashy clothing make

Advertisements are typically
made to sell a produce or idea.
The ads by campustruth.org re
cently airing in The Daily are no
different; they sell the idea that
Palestinians are terrorists and
murderers. By running these ads,
The Daily is sending the message
that it considers this a legitimate
idea to sell.
If The Daily wishes to continue
to advance this portrayal of Pales
tinians, then by all means, it
should continue to run these ads.
However, if not, I would question
the merit of making The Daily a
mouthpiece of a campaign de

Anderson and Huggins
wrong on resources

In Friday's Op-Ed piece ("What
does sustainable growth mean?"
Oct. 31), Terry Anderson and
Laura Huggins appear to try and
dispel the "myth" that there are ac
tual, finite limits to resources. They
imply that a decreased rate of con
sumption brought about by conser
vation is equivalent to a decrease in
scarcity. Although I'm not an
economist, in the universe with
which I am familiar, a decreasing
rate of consumption does not cre
ate new resources. Perhaps it will
take a generation or two longer to
run out, but there is still the same
limit on consumable materials. An
economy based on growth will
sooner or later be unable to contin
ue growth, either from a scarcity of
raw materials or a limit to the num
ber of possible consumers.
Sustainability is not some ethe
real concept. Populations of bac
teria grow until they reach the lim
its of the least-available nutrient,
and then their population levels
off. The population will then re
main in equilibrium with their en
vironment. Anderson and Hug
gins' proposed definition of sus
tainability "a call to maximize
human welfare" misses the
point entirely. Sustainability is a
function of the ability to maintain
equilibrium between available re
sources and the rate of consump
tion. It is not solely a question of
human welfare, but rather a func
tion of the ability to maintain a
population indefinitely. Even if
we decrease the rate of consump
tion, we will eventually reach the
end of supply if resources are non
renewable.
To scoff at the idea of sustain
ability belies an underlying agen
da that I perceive in many writings
from the Hoover Institution: Eco
nomic growth is the appropriate
goal of our economic and political
system. Then they throw in a dose
of "respect for the rule of law and
property rights." These will only
apply if the laws and distribution
of property are fair and just. They
do not in and of themselves guar
antee a system that allows all
members an equal chance at pros
perity.

SAT article poorly titled

I'm disappointed by the mis
leading subtitle for last Wednes
day's Features piece on the SATs
("The ABCs of SATs," Oct. 29).
The article, originally published in
The Daily Bruin under a different
title and subtitle, provides no sup
port for The Daily's statement
that "there is little correlation be
tween standardized test scores
and success in college." In fact, the
article acknowledges that the
SAT, while not the sole predictor
of future success, is one important
factor.
The article discusses a study at
UC-Berkeley, which found that
students admitted to that school
despite low SAT scores "are gen
erally successful in school," there
by making the case for a compre
hensive review process in college
admissions. Published with the
subtitle "Test scores don't neces
sarily predict success, new evalua
ton [sic] posits," the article raises
the valid point that SAT scores
cannot predict the success or fail
ure of every single student.
However, this fact does not in
any way refute the existence of a
correlation between scores on the
test and academic performance. A
positive correlation would imply
that overall, American students
with higher SAT scores tend to ex
hibit more success than those with
lower scores. If Berkeley admitted

I do hope that the latter is the
case, because I think it would be a
shame for one of the leading (in
dependent, may I remind you?)
student newspapers to lose its
journalistic objectivity that for
which The Daily so violently criti
cized the Stanford Review not so
long ago.
To be fair, I notice that you in
cluded a little footnote this time
around, which was not present last
time: "This is a paid advertise
ment and does not necessarily re
flect the views of the Stanford
Daily ..." Does this mean that, in
theory, I could publish an ad ad
vticating neo-Nazism, an extreme
racist group or an ad demanding
immediate death of all Ameri
cans? If I paid you enough money,
would you add that too?

Advertisements are typically
made to sell a produce or idea.
The ads by campustruth.org re
cently airing in The Daily are no
different; they sell the idea that
Palestinians are terrorists and
murderers. By running these ads,
The Daily is sending the message
that it considers this a legitimate
idea to sell.
If The Daily wishes to continue
to advance this portrayal of Pales
tinians, then by all means, it
should continue to run these ads.
However, if not, I would question
the merit of making The Daily a
mouthpiece of a campaign de
signed to demonize Palestinians.

Anderson and Huggins
wrong on resources

In Friday's Op-Ed piece ("What
does sustainable growth mean?"
Oct. 31), Terry Anderson and
Laura Huggins appear to try and
dispel the "myth" that there are ac
tual, finite limits to resources. They
imply that a decreased rate of con
sumption brought about by conser
vation is equivalent to a decrease in
scarcity. Although I'm not an
economist, in the universe with
which I am familiar, a decreasing
rate of consumption does not cre
ate new resources. Perhaps it will
take a generation or two longer to
run out, but there is still the same
limit on consumable materials. An
economy based on growth will
sooner or later be unable to contin
ue growth, either from a scarcity of
raw materials or a limit to the num
ber of possible consumers.
Sustainability is not some ethe
real concept. Populations of bac
teria grow until they reach the lim
its of the least-available nutrient,
and then their population levels
off. The population will then re
main in equilibrium with their en
vironment. Anderson and Hug
gins' proposed definition of sus
tainability "a call to maximize
human welfare" misses the
point entirely. Sustainability is a
function of the ability to maintain
equilibrium between available re
sources and the rate of consump
tion. It is not solely a question of
human welfare, but rather a func
tion of the ability to maintain a
population indefinitely. Even if
we decrease the rate of consump
tion, we will eventually reach the
end of supply if resources are non
renewable.
To scoff at the idea of sustain
ability belies an underlying agen
da that I perceive in many writings
from the Hoover Institution: Eco
nomic growth is the appropriate
goal of our economic and political
system. Then they throw in a dose
of "respect for the rule of law and
property rights." These will only
apply if the laws and distribution
of property are fair and just. They
do not in and of themselves guar
antee a system that allows all
members an equal chance at pros
perity.

SAT article poorly titled

I'm disappointed by the mis
leading subtitle for last Wednes
day's Features piece on the SATs
("The ABCs of SATs," Oct. 29).
The article, originally published in
The Daily Bruin under a different
title and subtitle, provides no sup
port for The Daily's statement
that "there is little correlation be
tween standardized test scores
and success in college." In fact, the
article acknowledges that the
SAT, while not the sole predictor
of future success, is one important
factor.
The article discusses a study at
UC-Berkeley, which found that
students admitted to that school
despite low SAT scores "are gen
erally successful in school," there
by making the case for a compre
hensive review process in college
admissions. Published with the
subtitle "Test scores don't neces
sarily predict success, new evalua
ton [sic] posits," the article raises
the valid point that SAT scores
cannot predict the success or fail
ure of every single student.
However, this fact does not in
any way refute the existence of a
correlation between scores on the
test and academic performance. A
positive correlation would imply
that overall, American students
with higher SAT scores tend to ex
hibit more success than those with
lower scores. If Berkeley admitted

a random group of students and
compared success to SAT scores,
then a study could evaluate
whether or not a correlation ex
ists. However, due to the fact that
all accepted students passed a rig
orous admissions process, those
with lower SAT scores do not con
stitute an accurate reflection of
the low-scoring population at
large.
By printing a misleading state
ment in large bold letters as a sub
title to a legitimate article, The
Daily has misled everyone who
scanned over that subtitle without
reading the article. I don't know if
The Daily as an institution be
lieves that the SATs are irrele
vant, but if so, it should reserve
such judgments for the Opinions
page.

The Atlantic's college rankings

Perhaps it would behoove you
to read an article before printing a
front-page story on it ("Stanford
ranked 6th by magazine," Oct.
31). The Atlantic Monthly's 30-
plus-page piece on colleges focus
es on debunking college rankings,
not promoting them. The selectiv
ity index is only used to support an
article saying that selectivity
means very little that it has a
"fetishistic" appeal, but should
not predominate in a prospective
freshman's decision for choosing a
college. In fact, the only source of
"irresponsible journalism" as
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet puts it in the
article, is The Daily itself for writ

clearly did no research on.

Racial remarks at show
inappropriate

While I was impressed with
some of the performances at the
Diwali Dhamaka show Saturday
night, I was very offended and dis
appointed by some of the com
ments made by the show's emcees.
On two occasions, one of the em
cees used stereotypical comments
about "white people" to get
laughs. Not only were these re
marks wholly unnecessary, they
had the effect of alienating many
of the white (and non-white)
members of the audience most
of whom were there to learn about
Diwali, support friends who were
in the show and enjoy a night of
Indian culture and entertainment.
As a dorm staff member who en
couraged some of his residents to
come to the show and as a mem
ber of the Indian community at
Stanford, I was embarrassed that
such comments were made.
Furthermore, I found the fic
tional "plot" behind the show de
meaning. It was based on the
premise that a person can be
"whitewashed" or labeled as an
ABCD (American Born Con
fused Desi) in the Indian-Ameri
can community. The term "white
washed" alone is insulting, regard
less of what culture or ethnicity
one identifies with. Culture is not
something we are painted with;
rather, it is something internal and
deeply personal. Cultural identity
can be a sensitive and difficult
topic for many people, especially
members of a diaspora born or
raised in a foreign country. There
is no such thing as "not being Indi
an enough," and it is equally
ridiculous to call someone "not
black enough" or "not Asian
enough." Treating the issue of cul
tural identity with such broad gen
eralizations and callousness does
a disservice to everyone.
It disappoints me that a show
like Diwali Dhamaka can't just be
a time to celebrate a culture with
out placing it in context of or in
opposition to another culture or
people. It also bothers me, as an
Indian raised in America, that
there is a prevalent attitude that
bhangra, Hindi films, spicy Indian
food and flashy clothing make
someone Indian. These are impor
tant facets of Indian culture and
things that should be celebrated
and respected. However, being
Indian as with any identity
is about how you feel and act, re
gardless of who you are, where
you were born, where you shop or
how you talk.

Campus commentary on
campustrufh.org's ads

Is this some sick joke? Or is
The Daily so naive as to think that
a "paid advertisement. . . does
not necessarily reflect the views of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, its Board members,
employees, or editorial board?"
Are you trying to aggravate us
students into writing in letters of
complaint about the extremist
campustruth.org adverts?
Or do you simply not check the
background of organizations pay
ing you?
Perhaps you can argue that
there is truth in the campus
truth.org adverts, but honestly,
have you been to their Web site?
Very scary (very apt for Hal
loween?).
I understand that you may
need to take paid adverts to pro
duce The Daily, but there should
be screening of where these ad
verts come from and what they
are saying. Would it be OK for
me to enter an advert saying,
"The Israeli government regular
ly kills innocent Palestinians?"
Or perhaps advertise a Web site
outlining all the horrible human
rights abuses committed by the
Israeli government on the Pales
tinians?
The Daily needs to understand
that it is a student newspaper
aimed at the entire student body,
and thus, it is wrong to alienate
certain groups through the ad
verts it publishes.
If you want to highlight an
issue, then do that in an article and
take the credit do it via an ad
vert and claim that it doesn't rep
resent your viewpoint.
The editors of this newspaper
should apologize to everyone who
they have offended with this ad
vert, and while they are at it, they
should bring back the "World and
Nation" section so that us stu
dents get a fair and balanced view
of what is happening in the out
side world, not the biased campus
truth.org view.

Earlier I acknowledged The
Daily as an organization that fos
tered and celebrated the diversity
on this campus. As a senior who
takes pride in this institution, I am
deeply hurt and disappointed by
The Daily's decision to publish
the recent flurry of ads from cam
pustruth.org. I am not alone in ex
pressing shock at The Daily's re
cent cultural and ethnic insensitiv
ity. Being a person who has been a
victim of racial and ethnic profil
ing and continues to be so I
am disappointed that The Daily
has chosen to endanger and iso
late a significant portion of the
campus population.
SYED IMRAN MOINUDDIN
Senior, Computer Science
I am shocked that The Daily
posted a second CampusTruth.org
ad after the outpour of negative
feeling from the University com
munity. The ad was met with virtu
ally nothing but criticism; it hurt
spme, it angered others and many
found it to be completely inappro
priate. This leads me to believe
that either The Daily has a politi
cal agenda, in which case The
Daily is no longer worth reading,
or that The Daily is so starved for
money that they'll take ads from
anybody, in which case The Daily
is using its $1 million budget ex
tremely poorly.
I do hope that the latter is the
case, because I think it would be a
shame for one of the leading (in
dependent, may I remind you?)
student newspapers to lose its
journalistic objectivity that for
