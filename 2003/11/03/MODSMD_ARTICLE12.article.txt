# JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK
## Britain is nice, but where's my TV? 
### 
I was raised by the TV. Our bond
went deeper than the surface
sweetness of Mr. Roger's cardi
gans and after-school specials; it
was akin to having a robotic au pair
who tutored on the side. Language,
values, standards, social systems:
Television taught me more and in
such colorful packaging! about
American life than my immigrant par
ents ever could; a fact that was not lost
on them. They'd leave me home alone
for hours on end, knowing that as long
as I was under the warmly lit surveil
lance of a TV screen, I'd be just fine.
Sometimes, we would even watch
and learn together. When I was in
grade school, my mom and I regularly
tuned in to the daytime soaps, whicn
she said helped supplement her ESL
lessons. It certainly explained her
preference for the dramatic.
"You will live to regret this," she'd
say solemnly whenever I refused to
practice piano.
"And you don't know vtfho you're
dealing with!" I'd retort, shaking my fist.
In addition to pithy scripted dia
logue, television taught me in
easy-to-digest pop-cultural bites
just how American society worked.
"Saved by the Bell" presented six, un
ambiguously reductive teenage
archetypes for me to experiment with;
"My So-Called Life" assured me that
angst was cool; and, well, I'm still
learning from "Sex and the City."
Television is such a wonderfully ef
fective mediator for life's emotional
vagaries. Andy Warhol spoke, with
his usual acumen, about how it de
fined what fuzzy issues like ro
mance and love and betrayal were,
or at least what they were supposed to
look like. Growing up, my parents
thought picking lint off your shoulder
at church constituted PDA. I had to
fill in the gaps somehow.
Since I learned so much about the
range of human experience from

prime time programming, I don't see
why television is so often linked with

themes of mind
lessness and the
fall of mankind.
Sure, I agreed with
the fundamental
message of
"Fahrenheit 451"
book burning
and uncapped cen
sorship, both very
bad but wall
to-wall flat-screen
TVs in every
room? Woo-hoo!

If that's the world on the verge of
apocalypse, then sign me up!
Going to Stanford didn't temper
my viewing habits; if anything, they
just got worse. I finally had a TV in my
own room, and tiny as my single in
Suites was, its shoebox-like acoustics
allowed me to watch my programs at
lower volumes, disturbing no one if I
had the TV on all the time. Which, of
course, was precisely what happened.
Eventually, television waves were as
plentiful and vital as oxygen.
But now, all is silent. Oxford is a
barren TV land: There are no "The
Simpsons" reruns, History Channel
specials or "Martha Stewart Living"
here. At 1 a.m., I wait in vain for
"Sports Center" to loop, only to feel
the absence of TV sports coverage
ever so painfully, knowing that the
NBA season has started without me. I
can't believe I'm in a country where
the phrase "BEAT LA" lacks deep
rooted, historical significance and Le-
Bron's stellar debut against my Kings
fails to make the front page.
Sadly, I've also discovered that
man cannot live by The Economist
alone. TV news, for all its streaming
banners and video game aesthetics,
has its merits. My life seems so dull, so
ill informed without the ADD-in
spired staccato of CNN's "Headline

News;" so bereft of childish glee with
out the faces of Bill O'Reilly, Brit
Hume or Ann Coulter to throw things
at. I'm not as fortunate as President
George W. Bush, who doesn't need
TV news because, as he said in a re
cent Fox News interview, "The most
objective sources I have are people on
my staff who tell me what's happening
in the world." (You just can't make up
dialogue better than that, folks.)
The British have television, but it's
the weird kind and I don't like it.
There are five channels available to
watch in the common room, and all
that seems to air are old, scratchy
movies, game shows with eerie, fluo
rescent sets and melodramatic soap
operas that put telenovellas to shame.
Plus, the scheduling system confuses
me to no end. Instead of airing pro
grams in neat 30-minute or one-hour
chunks, stations play shows of all dif
ferent lengths at random times like
4:50 p.m. and 12:15 a.m. I can't possi
bly navigate this madness!
So what's this TV junkie to do?
Sigh. Maybe I ought to trade in the
clicker for direct, personal contact
to appreciate the authenticity of En
glish culture in lieu of canned Ameri
cana. Maybe . . . but to borrow a
phrase from my English friends, it's
not bloody likely.
Instead, I've found my saving
grace in TiVo, a phenomenon that I
don't completely understand, but love
passionately nonetheless for its ability
to magically transport shows from my
friend's television at Stanford to my
laptop here. I just finished watching
last Thursday's "Daily Show," and in
those 30 brief, shining minutes, in this
weird and wonderful country, I finally
felt like I was home.
