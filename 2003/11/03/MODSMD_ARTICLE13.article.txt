## Many well served by Student Affairs 
### GENE AWAKUNI 
I am writing in response to the editorial
on the Office of the Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs ("Student Affairs must re
form," Oct 21). I understand that this piece
reflects the editors' opinions about Student
Affairs, but I would have hoped that re
porting and background research would
have been conducted to give the editorial a
foundation in fact A review of past issues
of The Daily would have revealed a num
ber of initiatives, events and programs that
have been launched by various units with
in Student Affairs to improve student ser
vices and campus life. And, perhaps more
importantly, you might have arrived at a
better understanding of what areas fall
within the domain of Student Affairs.
The Office of the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs is home to the Registrar's
Office, El Centro Chicano, the Black
Community Services Center, the Asian
American Activities Center, the
LGBTCRC, the Women's Community
Center, the Native American Center,
Bechtel International Center, the Career
Development Center, the Office of Ac
cessible Education, Vaden Health Cen
ter, Residential Education, the Office of
Student Activities, the Office of Judicial
Affairs, the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, Tresidder Meeting Services, the Of
fice of Freshmen and Transfer Students
and the Graduate Life Office. These of
fices all strive to provide high quality ser
vices and developmental opportunities to
students. By its failure to understand the
broad array of services the division offers
students, The Daily editorial has done an
enormous disservice to the over 200 ded
icated staff members who have become
trusted mentors and advisors to thou
sands of Stanford students over the years.
One of the primary areas of concern
for the professional staff in Student Af
fairs is the health and safety of Stanford
students — and, by logical extension, the
use and potential abuse of alcohol. Given
our personal connections to students and

our sense of professional responsibility, it
is simply not true that the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs places an
undue "emphasis on alcohol restriction
..." as The Daily editorial contends. (I
will address this criticism in greater depth
in a separate article.) Rather, in the year
and a half that I have been vice provost
we have attempted to address the issue in
a holistic manner by sponsoring a number
of campus-wide initiatives.
One of my top priorities when I ar
rived in January 2002 was to determine
what could be done to deal with the
dearth of space for student meetings, re
hearsals and social activities. To address
this issue, I am chairing a Student Activi
ties Space Task Force. We are now in the
midst of establishing a student activity
space master plan that includes develop
ing plans for the Old Union complex,
Tresidder and White Plaza. The master
plan, when completed in a few months,
will serve as an enduring foundation for
thg revitalization of campus life.
Although Stanford's budget con
straints preclude major construction pro
jects in the short term, we are attempting
to provide some immediate, high impact
improvements in the core areas. For ex
ample, when I arrived here, it quickly be
came clear to me that the dining com
mons at Tresidder was out of sync with
student needs. As a result, last spring I de
cided that Stanford Dining, partnering
with national brand vendors, would work
to infuse Tresidder food service with new
life. In just a couple of weeks, when Peet's
Coffee, Subway and a portion of the main
dining area open, students will discover a
more appealing and inviting place
one that will encourage late-night use.
I should note that my office also pro
vides support to the over 7,000 graduate
students at Stanford. To better serve their
needs, the Graduate Student Communi
ty Center (GSCC) project is underway
and moving rapidly toward an expected
completion date of summer 2004. The
GSCC was conceived several years ago

by students and staff and made possible
through the generosity of Mr. John Arril
laga and the support of the provost. Mul
tipurpose space, a cafe / pub, a TV
Lounge, meeting rooms and office space
for student groups will be among the
main features of the building.
Beyond this, University leaders have
made a concerted effort to expand social
and recreational opportunities for under
graduates. The president and provost
gave the ASSU a $50,000 grant for its Ab
solute Fun program as the editorial
noted, but it was incorrectly stated that
the grant was "the only initiative to im
prove undergraduate life all year." The
President's Fund also provides resources
for numerous student activities, including
half-priced tickets for Lively Arts events
and class programs like the formals, tal
ent shows and community service pro
jects. In addition, the Dean of Students
co-sponsors with other offices popular
initiatives such as Full Moon on the
Quad, the Movie Express bus to the Mer
cado theater, Midnight Breakfast and
transportation for Senior Nights.
While there are dozens of other stu
dent-initiated projects that my office has
supported over the past year like ISIS
and the FACES program, I am well
aware that much more can be done to
offer students the opportunity to fully
benefit from their Stanford experience.
A hallmark of the Stanford culture is that
students are encouraged to pursue their
own entrepreneurial endeavors. The
more we can support and foster these ef
forts, the more vibrant and energized the
campus becomes. Our job in Student Af
fairs is to provide the physical space, re
sources and mentoring students need to
bring their ideas to life. To the extent we
are able to achieve that goal, students
themselves become the catalysts for cre
ating exciting new initiatives that enliven
the entire campus community.

ty Center (GSCC) project is underway
and moving rapidly toward an expected
completion date of summer 2004. The
GSCC was conceived several years ago

by students and staff and made possible
through the generosity of Mr. John Arril
laga and the support of the provost. Mul
tipurpose space, a cafe / pub, a TV
Lounge, meeting rooms and office space
for student groups will be among the
main features of the building.
Beyond this, University leaders have
made a concerted effort to expand social
and recreational opportunities for under
graduates. The president and provost
gave the ASSU a $50,000 grant for its Ab
solute Fun program as the editorial
noted, but it was incorrectly stated that
the grant was "the only initiative to im
prove undergraduate life all year." The
President's Fund also provides resources
for numerous student activities, including
half-priced tickets for Lively Arts events
and class programs like the formals, tal
ent shows and community service pro
jects. In addition, the Dean of Students
co-sponsors with other offices popular
initiatives such as Full Moon on the
Quad, the Movie Express bus to the Mer
cado theater, Midnight Breakfast and
transportation for Senior Nights.
While there are dozens of other stu
dent-initiated projects that my office has
supported over the past year like ISIS
and the FACES program, I am well
aware that much more can be done to
offer students the opportunity to fully
benefit from their Stanford experience.
A hallmark of the Stanford culture is that
students are encouraged to pursue their
own entrepreneurial endeavors. The
more we can support and foster these ef
forts, the more vibrant and energized the
campus becomes. Our job in Student Af
fairs is to provide the physical space, re
sources and mentoring students need to
bring their ideas to life. To the extent we
are able to achieve that goal, students
themselves become the catalysts for cre
ating exciting new initiatives that enliven
the entire campus community.

Gene Awakuni is the vice provost for
student affairs.
I am writing in response to the editorial
on the Office of the Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs ("Student Affairs must re
form," Oct 21). I understand that this piece
reflects the editors' opinions about Student
Affairs, but I would have hoped that re
porting and background research would
have been conducted to give the editorial a
foundation in fact A review of past issues
of The Daily would have revealed a num
ber of initiatives, events and programs that
have been launched by various units with
in Student Affairs to improve student ser
vices and campus life. And, perhaps more
importantly, you might have arrived at a
better understanding of what areas fall
within the domain of Student Affairs.
The Office of the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs is home to the Registrar's
Office, El Centro Chicano, the Black
Community Services Center, the Asian
American Activities Center, the
LGBTCRC, the Women's Community
Center, the Native American Center,
Bechtel International Center, the Career
Development Center, the Office of Ac
cessible Education, Vaden Health Cen
ter, Residential Education, the Office of
Student Activities, the Office of Judicial
Affairs, the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, Tresidder Meeting Services, the Of
fice of Freshmen and Transfer Students
and the Graduate Life Office. These of
fices all strive to provide high quality ser
vices and developmental opportunities to
students. By its failure to understand the
broad array of services the division offers
students, The Daily editorial has done an
enormous disservice to the over 200 ded
icated staff members who have become
trusted mentors and advisors to thou
sands of Stanford students over the years.
One of the primary areas of concern
for the professional staff in Student Af
fairs is the health and safety of Stanford
students — and, by logical extension, the
use and potential abuse of alcohol. Given
our personal connections to students and

our sense of professional responsibility, it
is simply not true that the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs places an
undue "emphasis on alcohol restriction
..." as The Daily editorial contends. (I
will address this criticism in greater depth
in a separate article.) Rather, in the year
and a half that I have been vice provost
we have attempted to address the issue in
a holistic manner by sponsoring a number
of campus-wide initiatives.
One of my top priorities when I ar
rived in January 2002 was to determine
what could be done to deal with the
dearth of space for student meetings, re
hearsals and social activities. To address
this issue, I am chairing a Student Activi
ties Space Task Force. We are now in the
midst of establishing a student activity
space master plan that includes develop
ing plans for the Old Union complex,
Tresidder and White Plaza. The master
plan, when completed in a few months,
will serve as an enduring foundation for
thg revitalization of campus life.
Although Stanford's budget con
straints preclude major construction pro
jects in the short term, we are attempting
to provide some immediate, high impact
improvements in the core areas. For ex
ample, when I arrived here, it quickly be
came clear to me that the dining com
mons at Tresidder was out of sync with
student needs. As a result, last spring I de
cided that Stanford Dining, partnering
with national brand vendors, would work
to infuse Tresidder food service with new
life. In just a couple of weeks, when Peet's
Coffee, Subway and a portion of the main
dining area open, students will discover a
more appealing and inviting place
one that will encourage late-night use.
I should note that my office also pro
vides support to the over 7,000 graduate
students at Stanford. To better serve their
needs, the Graduate Student Communi
ty Center (GSCC) project is underway
and moving rapidly toward an expected
completion date of summer 2004. The
GSCC was conceived several years ago

by students and staff and made possible
through the generosity of Mr. John Arril
laga and the support of the provost. Mul
tipurpose space, a cafe / pub, a TV

for student groups will be among the
