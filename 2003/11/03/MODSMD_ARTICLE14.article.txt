# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## How a good slasher flick can be made from ice cream and a boring Halloween 
### 
I hate slasher flicks. You know, those really gruesome
movies where everyone gets killed in a ridiculous and
hideous way. The ones where all the characters have a
nasty strain of "jello legs" and have the survival rate of
candy corn at a kid's party. Still with me?
OK, good, just checking. Anyway, I'm going to discuss a
real-life slasher flick. I'm sure you've read about it, it's called:
"The Alumni Massacre the Mausoleum Party." And I bet
you're thinking, "There must be some psychoactive sub
stance in Chris's Halloween candy."

To clarify: No, a bunch of 'sBers
didn't stick around for another week
after Reunion and take revenge on
those punk kids who mis-parked their
cars. (But, Stephen King, do I have a
book idea for you!)
What I'm talking about is the chain
saw-like cutting of the Mausoleum
Party's funding. The Alumni Associa
tion's cancellation of its support for Full
Moon on the Quad, and now the Mau
soleum Party, hurts Stanford traditions
that were enjoyed by students and so

popular as to be featured in almost every college book
most recently in Sports Illustrated On Campus. So we have
awesome traditions, and yet the alumni thought it would be a
good idea to stop funding said events without leaving it up to
the students to decide whether or not they wanted to contin
ue them. *
But this column is not here to rag on the alumni. I'm sav
ing most of that material for my "I want the Alumni Center
to go be converted back to the Band Shak" column.
No, this column is trying to figure out the murder mystery
of our magnificent Mausoleum merrymaking. Simply, what
killed it?
If the alumni could not fund the event, a student organiza
tion should step forward. The Senior Class already has enough
on its plate so who is left? If you said the Ping-Pong Club,

hit yourself over the head. The answer, in my opinion, would
be the ASSU.
The ASSU has this great new program called "Absolute
Fun," not to be confused with "Absolut Fun," which is I think
being planned by SAE sometime in the spring. No, Absolute
Fun is a program that is intended to provide non-alcoholic,
all-campus events that will appeal to basically everyone. This
to me is an oxymoron for college students: "non-alcoholic"
and "all campus." But to show how dedicated the ASSU is to
wards its goal, it has $50,000 in funding.
What are they doing with this lump sum of money? Buy
ing hot tubs for every residence? Swimming in it ala Scrouge
McDuck? No, they decided to give it away in ice cream form.
(Hmm ... I wonder if that's what happened to the federal
budget suiplus?) A couple of weeks ago, there was an ice
cream social thingy where the ASSU gave away free ice
cream in White Plaza. (Nah, President Bush doesn't like ice
cream. He likes pretzels.) Roughly $50,000 is a lot of ice
cream. And, dude, I would totally have gotten seconds or
thirds if they had bought that much ice cream. And think of
the sprinkles! With that much money, we could have even
had sprinkles!
But sprinkles aren't as fun or as exciting as Sir Mixalot,
who played at the Mausoleum Party a couple of years ago.
Rumor has it he rocked the house so hard that Leland and
Jane actually rose from the grave and started dancing during
"Baby Got Back." (Editor's Note: The Daily does not pro
mote exhuming the corpses of the founders in any way, par
ticularly for dancing purposes.) As fun as sprinkles are, I'd
love to see Jane bust a move. (Editor's Note: We think he's
kidding.)
So, ASSU, Absolute Fun or the Ping Pong Club: I en
courage you to fund the Mausoleum Party next year. And if
you instead fund more ice cream socials, at least give us sprin
kles.

Ever seen "Weekend At Bernie's?" Think that could work at
the next Mausoleum Party? E-mail Chris Holt at cholt@stan
ford.edu with songs you'd think Jane could dance to.
