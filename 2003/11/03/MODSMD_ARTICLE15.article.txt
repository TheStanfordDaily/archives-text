## ESPN throws one helluva tailgate party 
### 
When I think of tailgates, I usually
think of coolers full of beer and
raw meat, loud stereos, red solo
cups and a carload of people try
ing to kill the previous night's hangover by
dnnking again. Granted, sometimes special
circumstances change a few things you
might have wine and Bloody Mary's instead
of the usual Natty Lite if you wander off into
the alumni tent on your way to the stadium.
Or you might have Coors Light with pan
cakes instead of burgers, as my friends and I
once did when the Colorado-Colorado State
game was scheduled at the ungodly hour of
10:30 a.m. (As if that would prevent drinking
amongst fans of the two rival schools.)
Either way, it was thoughts like these that
were going through my mind when I was
asked, last week, to help work at the "ESPN
Heisman Tailgate" for last Saturday's game
against UCLA. We thought we'd be setting

everything up, helping
serve food and drinks, then
breaking it all down after
the game. Not a bad deal
50 bucks for a few hours of
work and all the food and
drink you wanted while you
were working.
Sounded like a great gig
I was convinced the food
and drink would be top
notch (don't ask why, I just

did ... ESPN can do no wrong, after all), I'd
be working with my friends and I'd make half
a Benjamin.
Then the house of cards that were my
dreams began to fall, one by one.
Turned out we had to be at the stadium
parking lot at 6 a.m. There are two things I'll
get up for at 6 a.m. skiing is one, and work
ing for ESPN is not the other. Strike one.
When we arrived at the parking lot in
the dark, mind you the people we were
supposed to meet weren't there. So we tried
to find some breakfast / coffee / drugs to
make the morning bearable. That's a hard
thing to do in the greater Palo Alto area at
that time of morning. Noah's, Izzy's, Hobees
.J . all closed. Safeway coffee ... not real.
Strike two.
Upon 'returning to the parking lot, we
found the crew from ESPN and the other
people there to help out. As we looked
around at what's being set up and what we'll
be doing for the day, it became clear that the
term "tailgate" was a little bit of a misnomer
as there were no food or drinks to be found .
.. anywhere.
The realization that this party was more a
temple to consumerism and advertisement
hit me as I helped set up the "Suzuki Heis
man" trophy. No knock on Suzuki, but I feel
like whoever wins the Heisman doesn't have
the Sidekick high on the list of cars he's buy
ing after he gets drafted. Strike three.
Oh yeah, I forget to mention earlier the
Heisman trophy was there. I got to see it,
touch it, take my picture with it, all that jazz.
But even that doesn't make up for getting
up at six in the morning.
After a few hours the tents were set up.
The Suzuki SUV, ATV and motorcycle sur
rounded the Heisman in some bizarre block
ing arrangement that even that famous stiff
arm isn't going to keep away. The ESPN
Magazine blimp has been filled with helium
and sent up into the heavens. And I'm seri
ously ready for a nap. It's just past nine.
I get assigned to the "Playstation2" tent
where I am supposed to watch over two
PS2s and their respective televisions and
give away demo discs for 989's "Game
breaker 2004." For the first 30 minutes I was
having a pretty good time hell, I was get
ting paid to play video games on a Saturday
morning.
Yet the novelty soon wore off. The end
less line of middle school boys flocking to the
tent began to wear on me. Added frustration
came from the "Weber Grill" tent next to me,
where they're throwing back Coronas,
grilling up some brats and beef tenderloin.
Sadly, the smoke blowing off of their grill into
my tent was as close as I would come to a tail
gate all day.
I took out my aggression by selecting
University of Miami as my team in Game
breaker and dropping 35 points (in the
first half) on some unsuspecting seventh
grader.
That would have worked if he and Ohio
State hadn't dropped 45 on me. I had been
there for hours and junior high kids were still
better at this game than me.
As kickoff came so did the blessed end of
the "tailgate." Or so we thought. It took a few
hours to pick up the trash, break everything
down, clean up, load the truck that the ESPN
guys will drive up to Eugene, Ore., next
week. By three in the afternoon we were ac
tually done.
As we left I heard from a friend that we
had actually won, 21-14.
Sadly, I was too tired to even care.
Go figure.

Sadly, I was too tired to even care.
Go figure.

When I think of tailgates, I usually
think of coolers full of beer and
raw meat, loud stereos, red solo
cups and a carload of people try
ing to kill the previous night's hangover by
dnnking again. Granted, sometimes special
circumstances change a few things you
might have wine and Bloody Mary's instead
of the usual Natty Lite if you wander off into
the alumni tent on your way to the stadium.
Or you might have Coors Light with pan
cakes instead of burgers, as my friends and I
once did when the Colorado-Colorado State
game was scheduled at the ungodly hour of
10:30 a.m. (As if that would prevent drinking
amongst fans of the two rival schools.)
Either way, it was thoughts like these that
were going through my mind when I was
asked, last week, to help work at the "ESPN
Heisman Tailgate" for last Saturday's game
against UCLA. We thought we'd be setting

everything up, helping
serve food and drinks, then
breaking it all down after
the game. Not a bad deal
50 bucks for a few hours of
work and all the food and
drink you wanted while you
were working.
Sounded like a great gig
I was convinced the food
and drink would be top
notch (don't ask why, I just

did ... ESPN can do no wrong, after all), I'd
be working with my friends and I'd make half
a Benjamin.
Then the house of cards that were my
dreams began to fall, one by one.
Turned out we had to be at the stadium
parking lot at 6 a.m. There are two things I'll
get up for at 6 a.m. skiing is one, and work
ing for ESPN is not the other. Strike one.
When we arrived at the parking lot in
the dark, mind you the people we were
supposed to meet weren't there. So we tried
to find some breakfast / coffee / drugs to
make the morning bearable. That's a hard
thing to do in the greater Palo Alto area at
that time of morning. Noah's, Izzy's, Hobees
.J . all closed. Safeway coffee ... not real.
Strike two.
Upon 'returning to the parking lot, we
found the crew from ESPN and the other
people there to help out. As we looked
around at what's being set up and what we'll
be doing for the day, it became clear that the
term "tailgate" was a little bit of a misnomer
as there were no food or drinks to be found .
.. anywhere.
The realization that this party was more a
temple to consumerism and advertisement
hit me as I helped set up the "Suzuki Heis
man" trophy. No knock on Suzuki, but I feel
like whoever wins the Heisman doesn't have
the Sidekick high on the list of cars he's buy
ing after he gets drafted. Strike three.
Oh yeah, I forget to mention earlier the
Heisman trophy was there. I got to see it,
touch it, take my picture with it, all that jazz.
But even that doesn't make up for getting
up at six in the morning.
After a few hours the tents were set up.
The Suzuki SUV, ATV and motorcycle sur
rounded the Heisman in some bizarre block
ing arrangement that even that famous stiff
arm isn't going to keep away. The ESPN
Magazine blimp has been filled with helium
and sent up into the heavens. And I'm seri
ously ready for a nap. It's just past nine.
I get assigned to the "Playstation2" tent
where I am supposed to watch over two
PS2s and their respective televisions and
give away demo discs for 989's "Game
breaker 2004." For the first 30 minutes I was
having a pretty good time hell, I was get
ting paid to play video games on a Saturday
morning.
Yet the novelty soon wore off. The end
less line of middle school boys flocking to the
tent began to wear on me. Added frustration
came from the "Weber Grill" tent next to me,
where they're throwing back Coronas,
grilling up some brats and beef tenderloin.
Sadly, the smoke blowing off of their grill into
my tent was as close as I would come to a tail
gate all day.
I took out my aggression by selecting
University of Miami as my team in Game
breaker and dropping 35 points (in the
first half) on some unsuspecting seventh
grader.
That would have worked if he and Ohio
State hadn't dropped 45 on me. I had been
there for hours and junior high kids were still
better at this game than me.
As kickoff came so did the blessed end of
the "tailgate." Or so we thought. It took a few
hours to pick up the trash, break everything
down, clean up, load the truck that the ESPN
guys will drive up to Eugene, Ore., next
week. By three in the afternoon we were ac
tually done.
As we left I heard from a friend that we
had actually won, 21-14.
Sadly, I was too tired to even care.
Go figure.
