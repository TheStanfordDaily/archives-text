# Card's still got some fight left
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
In its most impressive' victory yet during head coach
Buddy Teevens' 18-game tenure, the Stanford football team
rode inspired defense, game-breaking special teams and an
opportunistic offense to a Saturday upset of Pacific 10 Con
ference leader UCLA, 21-14.
The Cardinal (3-4,1-4 Pac-10), which broke a four-game
losing streak, picked up its first conference victory in over a
year, while the Bruins (6-3, 4-1) suffered their first Pac-10
defeat this season.
UCLA, which entered the game as the clear favorite, out
gained Stanford 287 yards to 206, picking up 24 first downs
to the Cardinal's 10. But three Bruin turnovers, two huge
special teams plays and a perfect afternoon in the red zone
by Stanford proved enough to stun the Bruins.
"I don't think that they understood what kind of football
team we were," said strong safety Trevor Hooper. "Things
haven't always gone our way, but... a win like this is some
thing to build on."
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis threw for one touch
down and ran for another, but it was senior receiver Luke
Powell's 90-yard punt return for a touchdown with 2:28
to play in the first half that defined the Cardinal's break
out effort.
With the score knotted at seven apiece, Chris Kluwe hit a
slicing 42-yard punt that Powell fielded at the Stanford 10-
yard line. The return unit opened a gap in the middle of the
field, and Powell, flashing the form that made him an Ail-
American punt returner as a sophomore, exploded through
the wedge and angled past Kluwe at midfield, reaching the

end zone untouched.
"To get ahead like that was
huge," Teevens said. "It's inspiring
to the guys on both sides of the foot
ball."
The special teams weren't done
yet, though. After Stanford punter
Eric Johnson's third-quarter kick
bounced off of UCLA blocker Mar
cus Cassel, Cardinal gunner Marcus
McCutcheon alertly recovered the
ball for the Cardinal on the Bruins'
8-yard line, setting up Stanford's
final score.
The defense did its part, as the
Bruins didn't have a cheap score all
afternoon. It earned its two touch
downs the hard way, grinding out
an 18-play, 94-yard drive in the sec
ond quarter. Its second touchdown
came on an 80-yard drive late in the
fourth quarter and was aided by
several penalties.
After a scoreless first quarter, the
Bruins drew first blood one minute
into the second, as true freshman
Maurice Drew ran nine yards up the
middle for a touchdown.
The Cardinal came right back,
though, as Lewis orchestrated an un
usually swift drive that brought
Stanford 75 yards in under five min
utes. Lewis completed 5-of-6 passes
for 44 yards on the drive, sand
wiched around a 20-yard Kenneth
Tolon third-down run.
The Cardinal found itself with
first-and-goal on the UCLA 5-yard
line. Teevens went with the Cardi
nal's most common goal-line call, a
pitch right to Tolon, on two con
secutive plays, as the crowd of
44,950 at Stanford Stadium grum
bled its disapproval.
Then, on third-and-goal from
the 2-yard line, Teevens and of
fensive coordinator David Kelly
got creative.
Stanford fined up in a triple-I a
formation with three set backs and
no wideouts that is usually used for
short-yardage running plays. Lewis
faked a handoff to Tolon, who fol
lowed the two lead blockers up the
gut. The defense converged on
Tolon, letting sophomore tight end
Matt Tr a verso cut into the end zone
uncovered. Lewis rolled out on the
play-action and lobbed the ball to
Traverso for an easy two-yard
touchdown.
Stanford would revisit the triple-
I on third-and-goal from the one
yard fine at the end of the third
quarter, this time sending three re
ceivers into the end zone. The Bru
ins, prepared for the pass this time,
covered them all. Lewis rolled right,
tucked the ball and dashed for the
right pylon, diving and extending
his arm to get the football into the
end zone as he was being pushed
out of bounds.
The insurance touchdown would
prove essential, as Drew Olson's 45-
yard pass to Craig Bragg, combined
with a pass interference penalty on
Stanford cornerback Stanley Wil
son, would set up Drew's two-yard
touchdown run with 5:28 left to play.
Drew, who exploded for 176 yards in
the Bruins' win last week, was held
to just 65 on Saturday.
Despite its two second-half
scores, Stanford's offense played
very conservatively, throwing just
six passes and rushing the ball 25
times. Stanford totaled just 61 yards
in the half, and went three-and-out
on six of its nine drives, gaining only
two first downs total.
This is where the defense comes in.
Stanford racked up eight sacks
just three short of its entire sea

son total entering the game, harass
ing Bruin quarterbacks Olson and
Matt Moore all afternoon and
stalling the Bruins drive after drive.
Thanks to the sacks and a third
quarter interception by Hooper,
the Cardinal's average starting po
sition in the second half was its own
47-yard line, meaning that even
though the offense was stalling,
punter Eric Johnson was able to re
peatedly pin the Bruins deep in
their own territory.
"After you get a whole lot of hits
on their quarterback, and you get a
lot of pressure," defensive tackle
Amon Gordon said, "that takes a
toll on them."
Sophomore linebacker Michael
Craven, in his first start this year, led
the Cardinal's inspired effort with
seven tackles and two sacks.
Particularly in a frenzied third
quarter that saw UCLA cough up
two fumbles and an interception, the
Bruins looked confused by Stan
ford's array of blitz packages.
Moore, who completed 19-of-31
passes for just 145 yards, looked
frustrated by the constant pressure.
"[The pass rush] was causing me
to hurry my throws a little bit," he
said. "There was a guy or two always
popping through on us every time."
Olson, who completed 5-of-12
passes for 94 yards, was not sacked,
but got stuffed by defensive end Will
Svitek on a fourth-and-inches quar
terback sneak with 42 seconds re
maining in the game, ending
UCLA's comeback chances.
"We didn't protect well enough,"
UCLA head coach Karl Dorrell
said. "We didn't give the quarter
back enough time to do things that
he needs to do."
Stanford's inexperienced offen
sive line gave Lewis plenty of time to
throw, though, and the fifth-year
player took full advantage, routinely
rolling out of the pocket, waiting for
open receivers to materialize a
luxury Moore and Olson rarely had.
Lewis completed 12-of-20 passes
for just 91 yards in a careful, nearly
mistake-free performance. He
threw one interception on an ill-ad
vised third-quarter pass, but it did
not lead to a Bruin score.
"Chris did what he was asked to
do," Teevens said. "The leadership
and the execution, making critical
plays and working the clock the way
that he did was very impressive."
Tolon was asked to carry the ball
24 times, and he responded with 87
yards against a UCLA defense that
entered the game ranked second in
the Pac-10 in total defense.
After the win, Stanford spoke
about resilience, confidence and
unity.
"For the first time, guys really
trusted the game plan," Lewis
said. "They did what the coaches
were telling them to do and just
played with so much heart. I guess
we see what happens when we
trust in everything."
The win was particularly mean
ingful for the Cardinal, coming as it
did on the heels of last week's 35-0
thrashing in Oregon and
Teevens' promise in Tuesday's press
conference that he was "very confi
dent that [a breakthrough] will ar
rive quickly."
"We were sick of losing," Powell
said. "All we had to do was come to
gether and start executing, and that's
what happened today."
After the game, Teevens spoke
with relief about the victory.
"It's a boost and it affirms what
we've been talking about," he said.
"It's nice to see that hard work does
pay off."
As Lewis said, "This week we
stopped the talk and walked the
walk."

first-and-goal on the UCLA 5-yard
line. Teevens went with the Cardi
nal's most common goal-line call, a
pitch right to Tolon, on two con
secutive plays, as the crowd of
44,950 at Stanford Stadium grum
bled its disapproval.
Then, on third-and-goal from
the 2-yard line, Teevens and of
fensive coordinator David Kelly
got creative.
Stanford fined up in a triple-I a
formation with three set backs and
no wideouts that is usually used for
short-yardage running plays. Lewis
faked a handoff to Tolon, who fol
lowed the two lead blockers up the
gut. The defense converged on
Tolon, letting sophomore tight end
Matt Tr a verso cut into the end zone
uncovered. Lewis rolled out on the
play-action and lobbed the ball to
Traverso for an easy two-yard
touchdown.
Stanford would revisit the triple-
I on third-and-goal from the one
yard fine at the end of the third
quarter, this time sending three re
ceivers into the end zone. The Bru
ins, prepared for the pass this time,
covered them all. Lewis rolled right,
tucked the ball and dashed for the
right pylon, diving and extending
his arm to get the football into the
end zone as he was being pushed
out of bounds.
The insurance touchdown would
prove essential, as Drew Olson's 45-
yard pass to Craig Bragg, combined
with a pass interference penalty on
Stanford cornerback Stanley Wil
son, would set up Drew's two-yard
touchdown run with 5:28 left to play.
Drew, who exploded for 176 yards in
the Bruins' win last week, was held
to just 65 on Saturday.
Despite its two second-half
scores, Stanford's offense played
very conservatively, throwing just
six passes and rushing the ball 25
times. Stanford totaled just 61 yards
in the half, and went three-and-out
on six of its nine drives, gaining only
two first downs total.
This is where the defense comes in.
Stanford racked up eight sacks
just three short of its entire sea

son total entering the game, harass
ing Bruin quarterbacks Olson and
Matt Moore all afternoon and
stalling the Bruins drive after drive.
Thanks to the sacks and a third
quarter interception by Hooper,
the Cardinal's average starting po
sition in the second half was its own
47-yard line, meaning that even
though the offense was stalling,
punter Eric Johnson was able to re
peatedly pin the Bruins deep in
their own territory.
"After you get a whole lot of hits
on their quarterback, and you get a
lot of pressure," defensive tackle
Amon Gordon said, "that takes a
toll on them."
Sophomore linebacker Michael
Craven, in his first start this year, led
the Cardinal's inspired effort with
seven tackles and two sacks.
Particularly in a frenzied third
quarter that saw UCLA cough up
two fumbles and an interception, the
Bruins looked confused by Stan
ford's array of blitz packages.
Moore, who completed 19-of-31
passes for just 145 yards, looked
frustrated by the constant pressure.
"[The pass rush] was causing me
to hurry my throws a little bit," he
said. "There was a guy or two always
popping through on us every time."
Olson, who completed 5-of-12
passes for 94 yards, was not sacked,
but got stuffed by defensive end Will
Svitek on a fourth-and-inches quar
terback sneak with 42 seconds re
maining in the game, ending
UCLA's comeback chances.
"We didn't protect well enough,"
UCLA head coach Karl Dorrell
said. "We didn't give the quarter
back enough time to do things that
he needs to do."
Stanford's inexperienced offen
sive line gave Lewis plenty of time to
throw, though, and the fifth-year
player took full advantage, routinely
rolling out of the pocket, waiting for
open receivers to materialize a
luxury Moore and Olson rarely had.
Lewis completed 12-of-20 passes
for just 91 yards in a careful, nearly
mistake-free performance. He
threw one interception on an ill-ad
vised third-quarter pass, but it did
not lead to a Bruin score.
"Chris did what he was asked to
do," Teevens said. "The leadership
and the execution, making critical
plays and working the clock the way
that he did was very impressive."
Tolon was asked to carry the ball
24 times, and he responded with 87
yards against a UCLA defense that
entered the game ranked second in
the Pac-10 in total defense.
After the win, Stanford spoke
about resilience, confidence and
unity.
"For the first time, guys really
trusted the game plan," Lewis
said. "They did what the coaches
were telling them to do and just
played with so much heart. I guess
we see what happens when we
trust in everything."
The win was particularly mean
ingful for the Cardinal, coming as it
did on the heels of last week's 35-0
thrashing in Oregon and
Teevens' promise in Tuesday's press
conference that he was "very confi
dent that [a breakthrough] will ar
rive quickly."
"We were sick of losing," Powell
said. "All we had to do was come to
gether and start executing, and that's
what happened today."
After the game, Teevens spoke
with relief about the victory.
"It's a boost and it affirms what
we've been talking about," he said.
"It's nice to see that hard work does
pay off."
As Lewis said, "This week we
stopped the talk and walked the
walk."

Stanford strong safety Trevor Hooper and free safety Oshimogo Atogwe fight UCLA tight end Mercedes Lewis to the ground. Because of its strong defensive efforts
the Cardinal handed the Bruins their first Pacific 10 Conference loss of the season.
In its most impressive' victory yet during head coach
Buddy Teevens' 18-game tenure, the Stanford football team
rode inspired defense, game-breaking special teams and an
opportunistic offense to a Saturday upset of Pacific 10 Con
ference leader UCLA, 21-14.
The Cardinal (3-4,1-4 Pac-10), which broke a four-game
losing streak, picked up its first conference victory in over a
year, while the Bruins (6-3, 4-1) suffered their first Pac-10
defeat this season.
UCLA, which entered the game as the clear favorite, out
gained Stanford 287 yards to 206, picking up 24 first downs
to the Cardinal's 10. But three Bruin turnovers, two huge
special teams plays and a perfect afternoon in the red zone
by Stanford proved enough to stun the Bruins.
"I don't think that they understood what kind of football
team we were," said strong safety Trevor Hooper. "Things
haven't always gone our way, but... a win like this is some
thing to build on."
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis threw for one touch
down and ran for another, but it was senior receiver Luke
Powell's 90-yard punt return for a touchdown with 2:28
to play in the first half that defined the Cardinal's break
out effort.
With the score knotted at seven apiece, Chris Kluwe hit a
slicing 42-yard punt that Powell fielded at the Stanford 10-
yard line. The return unit opened a gap in the middle of the
field, and Powell, flashing the form that made him an Ail-
American punt returner as a sophomore, exploded through
the wedge and angled past Kluwe at midfield, reaching the

end zone untouched.
"To get ahead like that was
huge," Teevens said. "It's inspiring
to the guys on both sides of the foot
ball."
The special teams weren't done
yet, though. After Stanford punter
Eric Johnson's third-quarter kick
bounced off of UCLA blocker Mar
cus Cassel, Cardinal gunner Marcus
McCutcheon alertly recovered the
ball for the Cardinal on the Bruins'
8-yard line, setting up Stanford's
final score.
The defense did its part, as the
Bruins didn't have a cheap score all
afternoon. It earned its two touch
downs the hard way, grinding out
an 18-play, 94-yard drive in the sec
ond quarter. Its second touchdown
came on an 80-yard drive late in the
fourth quarter and was aided by
several penalties.
After a scoreless first quarter, the
Bruins drew first blood one minute
into the second, as true freshman
Maurice Drew ran nine yards up the
middle for a touchdown.
The Cardinal came right back,
though, as Lewis orchestrated an un
usually swift drive that brought
Stanford 75 yards in under five min
utes. Lewis completed 5-of-6 passes
for 44 yards on the drive, sand
wiched around a 20-yard Kenneth
Tolon third-down run.
The Cardinal found itself with
first-and-goal on the UCLA 5-yard
line. Teevens went with the Cardi

Olson, who completed 5-of-12
passes for 94 yards, was not sacked,
but got stuffed by defensive end Will
Svitek on a fourth-and-inches quar
terback sneak with 42 seconds re
maining in the game, ending
UCLA's comeback chances.
"We didn't protect well enough,"
UCLA head coach Karl Dorrell
said. "We didn't give the quarter
back enough time to do things that
he needs to do."
Stanford's inexperienced offen
sive line gave Lewis plenty of time to
throw, though, and the fifth-year
player took full advantage, routinely
rolling out of the pocket, waiting for
open receivers to materialize a
luxury Moore and Olson rarely had.
Lewis completed 12-of-20 passes
for just 91 yards in a careful, nearly
mistake-free performance. He
threw one interception on an ill-ad
vised third-quarter pass, but it did
not lead to a Bruin score.
"Chris did what he was asked to
do," Teevens said. "The leadership
and the execution, making critical
plays and working the clock the way
that he did was very impressive."
Tolon was asked to carry the ball
24 times, and he responded with 87
yards against a UCLA defense that
entered the game ranked second in
the Pac-10 in total defense.
After the win, Stanford spoke
about resilience, confidence and
unity.
"For the first time, guys really
trusted the game plan," Lewis
said. "They did what the coaches
were telling them to do and just
played with so much heart. I guess
we see what happens when we
trust in everything."
The win was particularly mean
ingful for the Cardinal, coming as it
did on the heels of last week's 35-0
thrashing in Oregon and
Teevens' promise in Tuesday's press
conference that he was "very confi
dent that [a breakthrough] will ar
rive quickly."
"We were sick of losing," Powell
said. "All we had to do was come to
gether and start executing, and that's
what happened today."
After the game, Teevens spoke
with relief about the victory.
"It's a boost and it affirms what
we've been talking about," he said.
"It's nice to see that hard work does
pay off."
As Lewis said, "This week we
stopped the talk and walked the
walk."
