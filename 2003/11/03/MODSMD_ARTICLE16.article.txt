In its most impressive' victory yet during head coach
Buddy Teevens' 18-game tenure, the Stanford football team
rode inspired defense, game-breaking special teams and an

out effort.
With the score knotted at seven apiece, Chris Kluwe hit a
slicing 42-yard punt that Powell fielded at the Stanford 10-
yard line. The return unit opened a gap in the middle of the
field, and Powell, flashing the form that made him an Ail-
American punt returner as a sophomore, exploded through
the wedge and angled past Kluwe at midfield, reaching the
