# Stanford defense shines in upset
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
There was a reason defensive tackle Amon Gordon
broke out his patented grin after Stanford's surprising 21-14
upset of Pacific 10 Conference leader UCLA.
On a day when the Cardinal offense had only 61 yards
of total offense in the second half and six three-and-outs,
Gordon and company had to rise to the occasion to seal
the win.
They did more than that.
The Stanford defense soared.
It nearly doubled its season sack total by getting to
UCLA's quarterbacks eight times. (Stanford had generated
only 11 sacks through its first six games.)
Just listen to the beleaguered Bruin quarterback Matt
Moore, and you'll get a sense of the effects that pressure had
on the Bruin offense.
"It was causing me to hurry my throws," he said. "There
was a guy or two always popping through on us every time."
Moore was so unproductive that he was pulled in favor of
sophomore QB Drew Olson with less than seven minutes to
play in the fourth quarter.)
Stanford defenders Babatunde Oshinowo and Michael
Craven had two sacks apiece, while Jared Newberry, Will
Svitek, Julian Jenkins and David Bergeron had one each.
Craven's play was arguably the most important of the
bunch. The sophomore linebacker
unseated Kevin Schimmelmann in
practice this week, earned his first
start and made the Cardinal coach
ing staff look like geniuses.
Craven had seven tackles in
cluding three for losses and one
pass deflection to go along with his
consistent quarterback pressuring.
For Craven, this wasn't just a
breakout game. Considering that the
six-foot-one, 230-pound linebacker
arrived at Stanford as one of the
biggest recruits in Stanford history
and then suffered through injuries
and academic problems, this perfor
mance was a little bit overdue.
So you can't fault Craven's team
mates for wanting to brag about him.
"Mike is a phenomenal athlete
it took him time to grow into his spot
but he's starting to make plays for us
now," said free safety Oshimogho
Atogwe.
The Cardinal defense also forced
two turnovers at key points in the

second half.
After Stanford's first drive of the
second half ended after six plays and
a punt, Bruin returner Craig Bragg
took Eric Johnson's kick down the
sideline for a 64-yard return down to
the Stanford 27.
It seemed that any momentum
the Cardinal may have gained by
Luke Powell's 90-yard punt return
late in the first half was slipping
away.
Three plays later, though, true
freshman Maurice Drew took a
handoff, ran over left end and was hit
by Newberry, who punched the ball
out of the running back's right arm.
Atogwe swiped the ball out of midair
and fell on it at the Cardinal nine
yard-line, taking away a potentially
game-changing red-zone opportuni
ty from the Bruins.
"I just saw the ball pop up in the
air [and I grabbed it]," Atogwe said.
The Bruins' next drive also ended
with a turnover. On third-and-five
from the Stanford 49, Leigh Tor
rence deflected a pass by Moore and
Trevor Hooper scooped up the ball.
"I just saw it in the air, made a
nice break on it, got it in my hands

and turned into a running back,"
Hooper said.
Maybe most importantly, howev
er, the Stanford defense stopped
UCLA when it had to most.
The Bruins got the ball at their
own 10-yard line with 1:58 left in the
fourth quarter and a chance to tie the
game.
After two first downs, two incom
pletions and a nine-yard gain, the
Bruins faced fourth-and-inches from
their own 34 with 45 seconds left.
UCLA coach Karl Dorrell called
for a sneak by Moore, but Svitek
snuffed out the play and stopped the
quarterback short of the 35-yard line
for a game-ending turnover.
In Stanford's last win, it also
stopped a two-minute drill. In week
two against BYU, the Cardinal de
fense allowed the Cougars to drive
down inside the Stanford 10 before
stiffening and stuffing the last four
goal-to-go plays.
That scenario was something the
young Stanford defense was able to
draw upon.
"It was something that was defi
nitely in my mind," Hooper said.
"We knew we had been through

[something like] this before and we
knew how to handle ourselves."
Finally, the defense neutralized a
Bruin rushing attack that only a
week earlier had seemed to find a
way to be effective. Drew rushed for
176 yards in his first breakout game
although UCLA already had
Tyler Ebell, the conference's fourth
leading rusher, as its starter.
Neither player was able to do
much Saturday. Drew had 65 yards
on 17 carries (including two touch
downs), while Ebell was phased out
of the game plan entirely and had
only six carries for 14 yards.
It cannot be understated, howev
er, that UCLA's offense has general
ly struggled the entire year. The Bru
ins have had difficulties in all facets
of the game offensively they've
had little success running (last in the
Pac-10), passing (eighth) and scoring
(eighth).
Nonetheless, there is little doubt
that Stanford's defense played its
best game of the season.
"It was just all about the effort,"
Hooper said. "We went in there
ready to bang heads with them
and we did it."

yard-line, taking away a potentially
game-changing red-zone opportuni
ty from the Bruins.
"I just saw the ball pop up in the
air [and I grabbed it]," Atogwe said.
The Bruins' next drive also ended
with a turnover. On third-and-five
from the Stanford 49, Leigh Tor
rence deflected a pass by Moore and
Trevor Hooper scooped up the ball.
"I just saw it in the air, made a
nice break on it, got it in my hands

and turned into a running back,"
Hooper said.
Maybe most importantly, howev
er, the Stanford defense stopped
UCLA when it had to most.
The Bruins got the ball at their
own 10-yard line with 1:58 left in the
fourth quarter and a chance to tie the
game.
After two first downs, two incom
pletions and a nine-yard gain, the
Bruins faced fourth-and-inches from
their own 34 with 45 seconds left.
UCLA coach Karl Dorrell called
for a sneak by Moore, but Svitek
snuffed out the play and stopped the
quarterback short of the 35-yard line
for a game-ending turnover.
In Stanford's last win, it also
stopped a two-minute drill. In week
two against BYU, the Cardinal de
fense allowed the Cougars to drive
down inside the Stanford 10 before
stiffening and stuffing the last four
goal-to-go plays.
That scenario was something the
young Stanford defense was able to
draw upon.
"It was something that was defi
nitely in my mind," Hooper said.
"We knew we had been through

[something like] this before and we
knew how to handle ourselves."
Finally, the defense neutralized a
Bruin rushing attack that only a
week earlier had seemed to find a
way to be effective. Drew rushed for
176 yards in his first breakout game
although UCLA already had
Tyler Ebell, the conference's fourth
leading rusher, as its starter.
Neither player was able to do
much Saturday. Drew had 65 yards
on 17 carries (including two touch
downs), while Ebell was phased out
of the game plan entirely and had
only six carries for 14 yards.
It cannot be understated, howev
er, that UCLA's offense has general
ly struggled the entire year. The Bru
ins have had difficulties in all facets
of the game offensively they've
had little success running (last in the
Pac-10), passing (eighth) and scoring
(eighth).
Nonetheless, there is little doubt
that Stanford's defense played its
best game of the season.
"It was just all about the effort,"
Hooper said. "We went in there
ready to bang heads with them
and we did it."

Junior tight end Alex Smith jumps to avoid a Bruin defender. Despite only gaining 206 total yards, the Cardinal converted when it counted, capitalizing off two third
and-goal-opportunities in the 21 -14 upset.
There was a reason defensive tackle Amon Gordon
broke out his patented grin after Stanford's surprising 21-14
upset of Pacific 10 Conference leader UCLA.
On a day when the Cardinal offense had only 61 yards
of total offense in the second half and six three-and-outs,
Gordon and company had to rise to the occasion to seal
the win.
They did more than that.
The Stanford defense soared.
It nearly doubled its season sack total by getting to
UCLA's quarterbacks eight times. (Stanford had generated
only 11 sacks through its first six games.)
Just listen to the beleaguered Bruin quarterback Matt
Moore, and you'll get a sense of the effects that pressure had
on the Bruin offense.
"It was causing me to hurry my throws," he said. "There
was a guy or two always popping through on us every time."
Moore was so unproductive that he was pulled in favor of
sophomore QB Drew Olson with less than seven minutes to
play in the fourth quarter.)
Stanford defenders Babatunde Oshinowo and Michael
Craven had two sacks apiece, while Jared Newberry, Will
Svitek, Julian Jenkins and David Bergeron had one each.
Craven's play was arguably the most important of the
bunch. The sophomore linebacker
unseated Kevin Schimmelmann in
practice this week, earned his first
start and made the Cardinal coach
ing staff look like geniuses.
Craven had seven tackles in
cluding three for losses and one
pass deflection to go along with his
consistent quarterback pressuring.
For Craven, this wasn't just a
breakout game. Considering that the
six-foot-one, 230-pound linebacker
arrived at Stanford as one of the
biggest recruits in Stanford history
and then suffered through injuries
and academic problems, this perfor
mance was a little bit overdue.
So you can't fault Craven's team
mates for wanting to brag about him.
"Mike is a phenomenal athlete
it took him time to grow into his spot
but he's starting to make plays for us
now," said free safety Oshimogho
Atogwe.
The Cardinal defense also forced
two turnovers at key points in the

second half.
After Stanford's first drive of the
second half ended after six plays and
a punt, Bruin returner Craig Bragg
took Eric Johnson's kick down the
sideline for a 64-yard return down to
the Stanford 27.
It seemed that any momentum
the Cardinal may have gained by
Luke Powell's 90-yard punt return
late in the first half was slipping
away.
Three plays later, though, true
freshman Maurice Drew took a
handoff, ran over left end and was hit
by Newberry, who punched the ball
out of the running back's right arm.
Atogwe swiped the ball out of midair
and fell on it at the Cardinal nine
yard-line, taking away a potentially
game-changing red-zone opportuni
ty from the Bruins.
"I just saw the ball pop up in the
air [and I grabbed it]," Atogwe said.
