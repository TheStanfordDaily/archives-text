### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Since opening up Pacific 10 Conference
play, it's been feast or famine for the Stanford
women's soccer team (9-8-2,4-3-1 Pac-10). Its
wins have come in blowout fashion and its loss
es have been shutouts.
This weekend's matchups against No. 14
Washington (10-5-3, 3-3-1) ana Washington
State (6-9-2,2-3-2) followed the same pattern.
On Friday night, the Cardinal came away
with a convincing 3-0 win over the Huskies, but
the squad was shutout on Sunday and left the
field with a disappointing 1-0 defeat to the un
ranked Cougars.
One would think that Friday night's pouring
rain would have made the No. 14 Washington
women's soccer team feel at home. However,
Stanford was quick to remind them that they
were right in the middle of Cardinal territory.
Sopnomore midfielder Jennifer Faren
baugh headed a rebound past Husky goalkeep
er Kelsey Rasmussen just one minute and 34
seconds into the match.
While that would be the only goal Stanford
needed, the Cardinal tacked on two more
scores to record a 3-0 victory.
"We know they are a very physical team and
playoffs are on the line," Farenbaugh said. "We

came out hard from the start and were ready to
gÂ°-"
Defensively, Stanford was challenged all
night by Washington forwards Tina Frimpong
and Kim Taylor.
"We talked about [Frimpong] before the
game, how to defend against her speed," said
senior defender Natalie Spilger. "We really
talked about making sure we had good cover
on whoever was pressing the ball."
While the Cardinal was ultimately able to
shut down the two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Week, Frimpong had plenty of opportunities.
She led all players with seven shots, five of
which were on goal. Taylor, however, was
held shotless by the Stanford defense.
"The first half was a little shaky," Spilger
said. "We talked about it at halftime ana were
able to clean it up. A lot of it just comes from
communication. Our backline talked a lot and
so did [junior goalkeeper] Nicole Barnhart."
Barnhart was there to make the stop each
time Frimpong created an opportunitv. She
picked up eight saves and her seventh shutout
of the season. It was her 29th career shutout,
which puts her third on the all-time Cardinal
list
