# Women upset No. 14 UW, fall to Wash. St.
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Since opening up Pacific 10 Conference
play, it's been feast or famine for the Stanford
women's soccer team (9-8-2,4-3-1 Pac-10). Its
wins have come in blowout fashion and its loss
es have been shutouts.
This weekend's matchups against No. 14
Washington (10-5-3, 3-3-1) ana Washington
State (6-9-2,2-3-2) followed the same pattern.
On Friday night, the Cardinal came away
with a convincing 3-0 win over the Huskies, but
the squad was shutout on Sunday and left the
field with a disappointing 1-0 defeat to the un
ranked Cougars.
One would think that Friday night's pouring
rain would have made the No. 14 Washington
women's soccer team feel at home. However,
Stanford was quick to remind them that they
were right in the middle of Cardinal territory.
Sopnomore midfielder Jennifer Faren
baugh headed a rebound past Husky goalkeep
er Kelsey Rasmussen just one minute and 34
seconds into the match.
While that would be the only goal Stanford
needed, the Cardinal tacked on two more
scores to record a 3-0 victory.
"We know they are a very physical team and
playoffs are on the line," Farenbaugh said. "We

came out hard from the start and were ready to
g°-"
Defensively, Stanford was challenged all
night by Washington forwards Tina Frimpong
and Kim Taylor.
"We talked about [Frimpong] before the
game, how to defend against her speed," said
senior defender Natalie Spilger. "We really
talked about making sure we had good cover
on whoever was pressing the ball."
While the Cardinal was ultimately able to
shut down the two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Week, Frimpong had plenty of opportunities.
She led all players with seven shots, five of
which were on goal. Taylor, however, was
held shotless by the Stanford defense.
"The first half was a little shaky," Spilger
said. "We talked about it at halftime ana were
able to clean it up. A lot of it just comes from
communication. Our backline talked a lot and
so did [junior goalkeeper] Nicole Barnhart."
Barnhart was there to make the stop each
time Frimpong created an opportunitv. She
picked up eight saves and her seventh shutout
of the season. It was her 29th career shutout,
which puts her third on the all-time Cardinal
list

Sophomore Leah Tapscott challenges Washington State goalkeeper in yesterday's Pacific 10
Conference matchup. The Cardinal, however, railed to find the back of the net in the 1-0 loss.
"I told the team how difficult it would
be to play against TinaFrimpong and Kim
Taylor," said Stanford head coach Paul
Rateliffe. "And I think they gave them too
much respect and were a little bit scared of
them"
The win was just another example
as to how important it is for Stanford to
get on the scoreboard first.
"Honestly, I thought that we didn't
play well in the first half," Rateliffe
said. "It was probably the worst we've
played in a long time, but we scored a
goal in the first five minutes of the
game, so confidence levels were high
and then you see what we can do."
The Cardinal has managed just one
comeback win all season and posts an 8-
0 record when it scores first
So on Sunday when Washington
State senior forward Shelby Brown
field found the back of the net in the
12th minute off a corner kick by junior
midfielder Megan Ceccheni, frustra
tion was all over the faces of the Stan
fordplayers.
"They get angrybecause they know
it's hard to score," Rateliffe said. "If we
had forwards that were scoring goals
all year, then I don't think that would
happen. But we don't have a forward
with more than three goals on the en
tire season."
Even more frustrating for the Car
dinal was that it was able to create op
portunities, but could not capitalize
and find the net.
Stanford held an advantage in
every offensive category except the
one that ultimately matters. It outshot
the Cougars 16-3, held a 10-3 shot on
goal advantage and had seven corner
kicks to WSU's five.
Rateliffe cited a lack of effort in the
first half as the underlying reason for
the emotional loss.
"They think it's just going to hap
pen and no one shoulders the responsi
bility and says 'l'm going to make it
happen,"' Rateliffe said. "It's a difficult
loss Because Washington is a much bet
ter team than Washington State and
we win 3-0 [against them] and they just
come out ana think they're better than
theyare, in a sense."
The Cardinal will have an opportu
nity to rebound from Sunday's loss
when it takes on California (7-7-4,2-5-
1) on Friday. Friday will be the last
home game for seniors Ally Mar
quand, Natalie Spilger, Brittany
Oliveira, Alisan Pabon and Anna
Hare.

ranked Cougars.
One would think that Friday night's pouring
rain would have made the No. 14 Washington
women's soccer team feel at home. However,
Stanford was quick to remind them that they
were right in the middle of Cardinal territory.
Sopnomore midfielder Jennifer Faren
baugh headed a rebound past Husky goalkeep
er Kelsey Rasmussen just one minute and 34
seconds into the match.
While that would be the only goal Stanford
needed, the Cardinal tacked on two more
scores to record a 3-0 victory.
"We know they are a very physical team and
playoffs are on the line," Farenbaugh said. "We

came out hard from the start and were ready to
g°-"
Defensively, Stanford was challenged all
night by Washington forwards Tina Frimpong
and Kim Taylor.
"We talked about [Frimpong] before the
game, how to defend against her speed," said
senior defender Natalie Spilger. "We really
talked about making sure we had good cover
on whoever was pressing the ball."
While the Cardinal was ultimately able to
shut down the two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Week, Frimpong had plenty of opportunities.
She led all players with seven shots, five of
which were on goal. Taylor, however, was
held shotless by the Stanford defense.
"The first half was a little shaky," Spilger
said. "We talked about it at halftime ana were
able to clean it up. A lot of it just comes from
communication. Our backline talked a lot and
so did [junior goalkeeper] Nicole Barnhart."
Barnhart was there to make the stop each
time Frimpong created an opportunitv. She
picked up eight saves and her seventh shutout
of the season. It was her 29th career shutout,
which puts her third on the all-time Cardinal
list

Sophomore Leah Tapscott challenges Washington State goalkeeper in yesterday's Pacific 10
Conference matchup. The Cardinal, however, railed to find the back of the net in the 1-0 loss.
"I told the team how difficult it would
be to play against TinaFrimpong and Kim
Taylor," said Stanford head coach Paul
Rateliffe. "And I think they gave them too
much respect and were a little bit scared of
them"
The win was just another example
as to how important it is for Stanford to
get on the scoreboard first.
"Honestly, I thought that we didn't
play well in the first half," Rateliffe
said. "It was probably the worst we've
played in a long time, but we scored a
goal in the first five minutes of the
game, so confidence levels were high
and then you see what we can do."
The Cardinal has managed just one
comeback win all season and posts an 8-
0 record when it scores first
So on Sunday when Washington
State senior forward Shelby Brown
field found the back of the net in the
12th minute off a corner kick by junior
midfielder Megan Ceccheni, frustra
tion was all over the faces of the Stan
fordplayers.
"They get angrybecause they know
it's hard to score," Rateliffe said. "If we
had forwards that were scoring goals
all year, then I don't think that would
happen. But we don't have a forward
with more than three goals on the en
tire season."
Even more frustrating for the Car
dinal was that it was able to create op
portunities, but could not capitalize
and find the net.
Stanford held an advantage in
every offensive category except the
one that ultimately matters. It outshot
the Cougars 16-3, held a 10-3 shot on
goal advantage and had seven corner
kicks to WSU's five.
Rateliffe cited a lack of effort in the
first half as the underlying reason for
the emotional loss.
"They think it's just going to hap
pen and no one shoulders the responsi
bility and says 'l'm going to make it
happen,"' Rateliffe said. "It's a difficult
loss Because Washington is a much bet
ter team than Washington State and
we win 3-0 [against them] and they just
come out ana think they're better than
theyare, in a sense."
The Cardinal will have an opportu
nity to rebound from Sunday's loss
when it takes on California (7-7-4,2-5-
1) on Friday. Friday will be the last
home game for seniors Ally Mar
quand, Natalie Spilger, Brittany
Oliveira, Alisan Pabon and Anna
Hare.
