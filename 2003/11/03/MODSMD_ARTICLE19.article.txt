# Polo shows its toughness in rough conference play
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team positioned itself well in
league play this weekend with home
wins over No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
Pepperdine. With an easy 6-4 victory
over the Bruins on Saturday morn
ing and a bitterly fought 10-8 tri
umph over the Waves, the Cardinal
has improved its league record to 3-1
and its overall season record to 14-3.
Stanford did its best to keep cool
in a dirty matchup Sunday afternoon
against Pepperdine. From the first
whistle it was clear the game would
be hard fought by both sides, but the
level of physical play was intense and
the referees did little early on in the
game to curb the rough play. By the
end of the match, four players and an
assistant coach would be ejected
from the game for the Waves and
two Cardinal men were forced to
leave the pool.
"I think it's a difficult game to
ref," said senior utility Mike Derse
who was ejected from the game at
the end of the second period. "It
wasn't clean water polo. It was per
haps one of the dirtiest games I've

ever played in."
Still, the Cardinal ignored the
yells of the Pepperdine players and
protestations of the bench and con
tinued to play solid water polo in
the pool and scored four unan
swered goals to start the second half
of the game.
"Pepperdine has a lot of big guys
and they like to play rough," said ju
nior two-meter Greg Crum. "We de
cided to play rough with them, but
we played smart. I think we played
smarter than they did and that was
the difference in the game."
Junior driver Tony Azevedo
notched the first score of the game
on a pass from Crum and sophomore
Thomas Hopkins added to the Car
dinal score. Sophomore driver Peter
Varellas scored in the final second of
the first period, to bring the score to
3-2, in favor of Stanford.
The referees got serious about
making calls toward the end of the
first period. Pepperdine's Doug
Mann was ejected from the game for
his physical play and the bench was
given a yellow card. But with all the
fouls committed by both sides, the
officiating often seemed haphazard
and spurious; the refs appeared to be

having difficulty choosing who to
whistle in many of their ejections.
"Being a two-meter defender,
sometimes it happens during a
game and you've just got to take the
good with the bad. In a physical
game, I did what I needed to do,"
said Derse about his ejection from
the game.
Pepperdine surged ahead in the
second period with junior Sam
Tyre scoring the lone Cardinal goal
to lead the game 6-4 at the half.
Stanford came out for a strong 4-0
third period, with two goals each by
Azevedo and Varellas.
The Waves waved goodbye to
their assistant coach when he was red
carded and sent away from the pool
in the middle of the third period.
Stanford held a solid defense
through out the second half, holding
Pepperdine to only two goals in the
fourth period. Azevedo scored two
more goals of his own, bringing the
Cardinal to its 10-8 victory. Azevedo
now has 57 goals for the season.
"I think we held our composure
and we ended up with a win which is
good," Derse said. "We held our

composure much better than they
did. They got red cards, they got
game ejections. I think we did a good
job in trying to compete in the game
playing water polo ... and clearly we
dominated the game looking at the
scoreboard."
The Cardinal appeared to be in
control during Saturday's game
against the Bruins, as well. Al
though they failed to score in the
second half, the Cardinal firmly es
tablished the lead in the first half of
play with a score of 6-2 going into
the third period.
"We really went out that first half
and absolutely showed what Stan
ford water polo's about this year,"
said Azevedo of Saturday's game
against UCLA. "Offensively [we're]
a firepower team, and when we're
on, no one can stop us. We started
trying to play solid defensively in the
second half and we did, holding
them to one goal in each of two peri
ods. As far as we were concerned we
were up by enough and we had to
play defense."
Stanford assistant Coach Brian
Kreutzkamp agreed with Azevedo's
assessment of the game strategy.
"We struggled a little bit on the
offense, but we weren't in a position
where we needed any goals. We just
needed to play really strong defense
in the second half, definitely an
chored by Chad Taylor," Kreut
skamp said.
The Cardinal victories this week
end have placed it at the top of the
MPSF along with USC and Cal.
Stanford is well placed to make a bid
for league champion.
"It's just huge," Crum said. "It

puts us at a great advantage. I think
we're all tied for first now in MPSF
and that sets us up for the end of
the season."
"We're in great position right
now," Derse added. "No one has
beaten both UCLA and Pepper
dine in the same weekend this

year. Both USC and Cal haven't.
We're in the driver's seat. We have
a big game against Cal next week
and UOP."
With the MPSF tournament com
ing up at the end of the month, Stan
ford must continue to have big wins
like these to ensure a position in the

NCAA finals in December.
UCLA is now 4-1 in league play,
including a win last weekend against
No. 1 Southern California in sudden
death overtime. USC concluded its
league play for the season this week
end with victories over Long Beach
State and Irvine to put them at 6-1 in

league play. No. 2 Cal is 4-2 in league
play for the season.
The Cardinal faces UOP and Cal
on the road this coming weekend.
"I always love playing against Cal
either here or there," Crum said.
"It's always a fun game and I'm real
ly looking forward to it."

end have placed it at the top of the
MPSF along with USC and Cal.
Stanford is well placed to make a bid
for league champion.
"It's just huge," Crum said. "It

puts us at a great advantage. I think
we're all tied for first now in MPSF
and that sets us up for the end of
the season."
"We're in great position right
now," Derse added. "No one has
beaten both UCLA and Pepper
dine in the same weekend this

year. Both USC and Cal haven't.
We're in the driver's seat. We have
a big game against Cal next week
and UOP."
With the MPSF tournament com
ing up at the end of the month, Stan
ford must continue to have big wins
like these to ensure a position in the

NCAA finals in December.
UCLA is now 4-1 in league play,
including a win last weekend against
No. 1 Southern California in sudden
death overtime. USC concluded its
league play for the season this week
end with victories over Long Beach
State and Irvine to put them at 6-1 in

league play. No. 2 Cal is 4-2 in league
play for the season.
The Cardinal faces UOP and Cal
on the road this coming weekend.
"I always love playing against Cal
either here or there," Crum said.
"It's always a fun game and I'm real
ly looking forward to it."

5 Pepperdine, scoring 16 goals in two games.
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team positioned itself well in
league play this weekend with home
wins over No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
Pepperdine. With an easy 6-4 victory
over the Bruins on Saturday morn
ing and a bitterly fought 10-8 tri
umph over the Waves, the Cardinal
has improved its league record to 3-1
and its overall season record to 14-3.
Stanford did its best to keep cool
in a dirty matchup Sunday afternoon
against Pepperdine. From the first
whistle it was clear the game would
be hard fought by both sides, but the
level of physical play was intense and
the referees did little early on in the
game to curb the rough play. By the
end of the match, four players and an
assistant coach would be ejected
from the game for the Waves and
two Cardinal men were forced to
leave the pool.
"I think it's a difficult game to
ref," said senior utility Mike Derse
who was ejected from the game at
the end of the second period. "It
wasn't clean water polo. It was per
haps one of the dirtiest games I've

ever played in."
Still, the Cardinal ignored the
yells of the Pepperdine players and
protestations of the bench and con
tinued to play solid water polo in
the pool and scored four unan
swered goals to start the second half
of the game.
"Pepperdine has a lot of big guys
and they like to play rough," said ju
nior two-meter Greg Crum. "We de
cided to play rough with them, but
we played smart. I think we played
smarter than they did and that was
the difference in the game."
Junior driver Tony Azevedo
notched the first score of the game
on a pass from Crum and sophomore
Thomas Hopkins added to the Car
dinal score. Sophomore driver Peter
Varellas scored in the final second of
the first period, to bring the score to
3-2, in favor of Stanford.
The referees got serious about
making calls toward the end of the
first period. Pepperdine's Doug
Mann was ejected from the game for
his physical play and the bench was
given a yellow card. But with all the
fouls committed by both sides, the
officiating often seemed haphazard
and spurious; the refs appeared to be

having difficulty choosing who to
whistle in many of their ejections.
"Being a two-meter defender,
sometimes it happens during a
game and you've just got to take the
good with the bad. In a physical
game, I did what I needed to do,"
said Derse about his ejection from
the game.
Pepperdine surged ahead in the
second period with junior Sam
Tyre scoring the lone Cardinal goal
to lead the game 6-4 at the half.
Stanford came out for a strong 4-0
third period, with two goals each by
Azevedo and Varellas.
The Waves waved goodbye to
their assistant coach when he was red
carded and sent away from the pool
in the middle of the third period.
Stanford held a solid defense
through out the second half, holding
Pepperdine to only two goals in the
fourth period. Azevedo scored two
more goals of his own, bringing the
Cardinal to its 10-8 victory. Azevedo
now has 57 goals for the season.
"I think we held our composure
and we ended up with a win which is
good," Derse said. "We held our

composure much better than they
did. They got red cards, they got
game ejections. I think we did a good
job in trying to compete in the game
playing water polo ... and clearly we
dominated the game looking at the
scoreboard."
The Cardinal appeared to be in
control during Saturday's game
against the Bruins, as well. Al
though they failed to score in the
second half, the Cardinal firmly es
tablished the lead in the first half of
play with a score of 6-2 going into
the third period.
"We really went out that first half
and absolutely showed what Stan
ford water polo's about this year,"
said Azevedo of Saturday's game
against UCLA. "Offensively [we're]
a firepower team, and when we're
on, no one can stop us. We started
trying to play solid defensively in the
second half and we did, holding
them to one goal in each of two peri
ods. As far as we were concerned we
were up by enough and we had to
play defense."
Stanford assistant Coach Brian
Kreutzkamp agreed with Azevedo's
assessment of the game strategy.
"We struggled a little bit on the
offense, but we weren't in a position
where we needed any goals. We just
needed to play really strong defense
in the second half, definitely an
chored by Chad Taylor," Kreut
skamp said.
