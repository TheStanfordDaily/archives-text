# Polo shows its toughness in rough conference play
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team positioned itself well in
league play this weekend with home
wins over No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
Pepperdine. With an easy 6-4 victory
over the Bruins on Saturday morn
ing and a bitterly fought 10-8 tri
umph over the Waves, the Cardinal
has improved its league record to 3-1
and its overall season record to 14-3.
Stanford did its best to keep cool
in a dirty matchup Sunday afternoon
against Pepperdine. From the first
whistle it was clear the game would
be hard fought by both sides, but the
level of physical play was intense and
the referees did little early on in the
game to curb the rough play. By the
end of the match, four players and an
assistant coach would be ejected
from the game for the Waves and
two Cardinal men were forced to
leave the pool.
"I think it's a difficult game to
ref," said senior utility Mike Derse
who was ejected from the game at
the end of the second period. "It
wasn't clean water polo. It was per
haps one of the dirtiest games I've

ever played in."
Still, the Cardinal ignored the
yells of the Pepperdine players and
protestations of the bench and con
tinued to play solid water polo in
the pool and scored four unan
swered goals to start the second half
of the game.
"Pepperdine has a lot of big guys
and they like to play rough," said ju
nior two-meter Greg Crum. "We de
cided to play rough with them, but
we played smart. I think we played
smarter than they did and that was
the difference in the game."
Junior driver Tony Azevedo
notched the first score of the game
on a pass from Crum and sophomore
Thomas Hopkins added to the Car
dinal score. Sophomore driver Peter
Varellas scored in the final second of
the first period, to bring the score to
3-2, in favor of Stanford.
The referees got serious about
making calls toward the end of the
first period. Pepperdine's Doug
Mann was ejected from the game for
his physical play and the bench was
given a yellow card. But with all the
fouls committed by both sides, the
officiating often seemed haphazard
and spurious; the refs appeared to be

having difficulty choosing who to
whistle in many of their ejections.
"Being a two-meter defender,
sometimes it happens during a
game and you've just got to take the
good with the bad. In a physical
game, I did what I needed to do,"
said Derse about his ejection from
the game.
Pepperdine surged ahead in the
second period with junior Sam
Tyre scoring the lone Cardinal goal
to lead the game 6-4 at the half.
Stanford came out for a strong 4-0
third period, with two goals each by
Azevedo and Varellas.
The Waves waved goodbye to
their assistant coach when he was red
carded and sent away from the pool
in the middle of the third period.
Stanford held a solid defense
through out the second half, holding
Pepperdine to only two goals in the
fourth period. Azevedo scored two
more goals of his own, bringing the
Cardinal to its 10-8 victory. Azevedo
now has 57 goals for the season.
"I think we held our composure
and we ended up with a win which is
good," Derse said. "We held our
