# Cardinal offense finds its rhythm against the Bruins
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Haunted all week by its failure
to score last weekend against Ore
gon despite numerous chances, the
Stanford offense took advantage of
Halloween weekend to exorcise its
red-zone demons.
Faced with two critical third
and-goal opportunities against
UCLA on Saturday, Chris Lewis
and company punched the ball into
the end zone both times.
"We went back to school on the
[red-zone offense]," said Stanford
head coach Buddy Teevens after
the game. With a smile, he added,
"It paid off, didn't it?"
It did the difference be
tween touchdowns and field goals
on those possessions was the dif
ference between a watershed 21-
14 victory and a potentially deflat
ing loss.
The first touchdown came with

Stanford trailing 7-0 early in the
second quarter. After Lewis direct
ed an efficient drive to a first down
at UCLA's 5-yard line, junior run
ning back Kenneth Tolon was
stymied twice on sweeps to the
right side.
On third-and-goal from the two,
the game's momentum hung in the
balance as the Cardinal lined up in
an unorthodox "Full I" set, with
three backs lined up in a row be
hind Lewis. When the ball was
snapped, all three plowed straight
into the UCLA line. But the ball
stayed with Lewis, who faked the
handoff and tossed the ball instead
to wide-open tight end Matt
Traverso for the touchdown.
"That's an offensive [relic]
there we dusted off," Teevens said
of the formation, which was popu
lar in the days before the forward
pass revolutionized offensive play
books. "The whole crew sold the
run, UCLA bought it and we had

an open receiver.
The unusual call existed in com
plete contrast to the conservative
plays Stanford ran the previous
week in Eugene, Ore.
"We focused on executing in the
red zone this week in practice,"
Powell said after the game.
The work showed again at the
end of the third quarter, when
Stanford recovered a fumbled punt
return on the UCLA 8-yard line.
This time it was J.R. Lemon
who ran the ball twice to move the
ball inside the UCLA two before
Stanford again pulled out the
three-back "I." Lewis again faked
a handoff, but this timed dropped
way back and couldn't locate an
open receiver. He tucked the ball
in and sprinted for the corner of
the end zone, diving across the
goal line just before he collided
with a defender.
"It was a pass play that broke
down," Lewis explained. "They
covered it pretty well, so I just ran
with it."
The touchdown put the Cardi
nal ahead 21-7, a lead that the de
fense held onto for a 21-14 victory.
Aside from the efficiency in the
red zone, the Stanford offense
wasn't particularly productive on
Saturday, gaining just 206 total
yards. The 91 passing yards were
the sixth-fewest in team history.
But they were enough to win.
"That's a good UCLA defense,"
Stanford defensive tackle Amon
Gordon said. "With our guys mov
ing the ball, I really feel this was
just our time."
Lewis looked comfortable be
hind center, thanks in part to im
proved offensive line play and in
part to his mobility, which allowed
him to buy time by scrambling. He
was sacked just once.
"Chris did what he was asked to
do," Teevens said, praising Lewis's
"leadership and execution."
But Lewis wasn't about to take
credit for the team's success.
"A lot of it has to do with our
run game," he said. "I thought we
picked it up, got a couple big first
downs."
A couple first downs were all
that was needed in the fourth quar
ter, when the Cardinal protected
its lead by running down the clock.
But if the team is to turn a win into
a winning streak in the coming
weeks, it will need to reproduce the
rhythm it found on its first scoring
drive, when Lewis spread the ball
around to several different re

we've known all along, but other
teams didn't know that, they didn't
respect that."
Powell added that Saturday's
outcome could be an emotional
building block for him and for the
rest of the Stanford offense.
"The past couple games I
haven't caught very many balls,"
he said. "Our offense has been
struggling. Today we were able to
bring it together.
