## Moore appeases crowd by duplicating speech 
### JENNIFER MARIN THE LANTERN 
(U-WIRE) When Oscar-winning
documentary filmmaker Michael Moore
walked into the Ohio State University
Union yesterday to speak to an audience of
more than 450 people, he probably didn't
anticipate he would be giving his speech
twice.
In addition to the crowd waiting for him
in the East Ballroom, he was met by 400
more standing in front of closed doors, who
were told they couldn't go in. To appease
the masses, he gave a mini version of his

speech on the front lawn of the Union. His
message for both remained the same: re
move President George W. Bush from the
White House because "people of this coun
try don't like being lied to."
Moore said the war in Iraq was a result
of Bush manipulating the American people
to believe weapons of mass destruction
were an immediate threat, but citizens'
views shifted after the war did not end after
a few months.
"If you said anything bad against the
war, you immediately had to follow up with
'I support the troops,' " Moore said.
"What do you tell the parents ... what

their child, the child they raised all these
years, what that child died for?" he said.
One of the audience members said oil,
and Moore agreed.
"(The Bush administration) lied so
they could line the pockets of their bud
dies, so they could control the second
largest supply of oil reserves under the
earth which happens to be under Iraq.
That really is what it is all about," Moore
said.
But the right's days are numbered,
Moore said.
"They are all angry. Fox News and talk
radio are the sounds of a dying dinosaur.

We live in a liberal country now," he said.
"The angry white guy is in the minority.
Two-thirds of the country is either female
or people of color."
Moore said the right wing knows it is not
going to be in charge much longer.
In a country enforcing ignorance,
Americans spend the first 18 years of their
life in school, taught to conform, Moore
said.
"I thought we are supposed to be about
diversity of opinion and the right to speak
our minds, Moore said.
Moore said his 2002 Oscar acceptance
speech for "Bowling for Columbine" re

fleeted that sentiment.
"People ask me, 'Do you have any re
grets about your Oscar speech?' " Moore
said. "My only regret is I didn't leap into
the orchestra pit. I didn't think we were
going to win. I didn't plan on saying any
thing. I heard two voices. One said 'blow
them a kiss and walk off stage.' The other
said "No, you have a job to do. You must
say something.' "
Moore told the audience on the lawn he
was hopeful about next November.
"If we've got 10,000 people doing just a lit
tle bit, rather than 1,000 people doing a lot,
I'd rather have 10,000," Moore said.
