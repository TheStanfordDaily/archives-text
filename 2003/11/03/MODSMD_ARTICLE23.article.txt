# Coffee may prevent cancer
## 
### MEGAN SACIA THE BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) Coffee drinkers may be
doing more than jump-starting the day
with a morning cup of joe they may ac
tually be preventing colon cancer.
For years, scientists have hypothesized
that some cancer protection might come
from coffee consumption. Scientists now
say they have identified a highly-active
anti-cancer compound in coffee. German
researchers recently discovered the effec
tive compound, methylpyridinium, a po
tent antioxidant, which seems to enhance
the activity of phase two enzymes that pro
tect against colon cancer.
"We have been looking for some time at
coffee, and it appeared in the past that cof
fee was reducing cancer, but no one really
understood why," says Donna Weihofen,
senior nutritionist with the University of
Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center.
In 1998, a detailed analysis of 17 studies
on coffee drinking was executed at Har
vard. The results showed a decreasing risk

of colon cancer resulting from moderate
coffee drinking. The explanation for this,
though, had nothing to do with antioxi
dants. Instead, it said that drinking coffee
helps to expel wastes easily, which in turn
keeps the colon healthier, Weihofen says.
Coffee is one of the sole providers of
methylpyridinium. It is not actually con
tained in coffee beans, but contained in
trigonellin, its chemical antecedent, and
formed during the roasting process. The
anticancer complex is found in any type of
coffee, with or without caffeine.
Compared to a regular, medium-roast
blend, espressos are a better option be
cause they hold two to three times the
amount of the anti-cancer compound.
The study exposed specially prepared
extracts of coffee to laboratory prepara
tions of human intestinal cells for a period
of three days. The result was a dose depen
dant increase in phase two enzymes. The
consumption of more coffee produced
more enzymes.
An identical study using 24 rats dis
played the same results. Rats fed the

methylpyridinium showed a 24 percent to
40 percent increase in phase two enzymes.
The American Cancer Society reports
that, excluding skin cancers, colorectal
cancer is the third most common cancer di
agnosed in both men and women in the
United States. The ACS expects 105,000
new cases of colorectal cancer by the end of
2003. About 57,100 people are expected to
die from the cancer this year.
Factors shown to increase the risk of
colon cancer are obesity, alcohol, burnt or
blackened red meat and high sugar or high
fat diets. Coffee has not been determined
as a cause of any type of cancer, making
this discovery one of great importance,
Weihofen says.
"I like the versatility of coffee," says
Lindsay A. Mueller, a UW sophomore.
"It's excellent served steaming-hot,
straight-black, and it's good in [an] iced
cappuccino. I often use it to wake up in the
morning, but sometimes it's nice on a cold
day just to sip on."
Mueller adds it is comforting to know
coffee may have added benefits.
