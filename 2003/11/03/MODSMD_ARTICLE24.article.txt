# UW doctor under investigation
## 
### STEVE MILETICH MIKE CARTER Knight Ridder Times 
(KRT) Federal and state investiga
tors agreed Tuesday to conduct a joint
criminal investigation into the drug-dis
pensing>lpractices of former University of
Washington team doctor William Scheyer,
two senior law-enforcement officials said
last Tuesday.
The wide-ranging investigation will not
only examine Scheyer's activities but also
the conduct of trainers, coaches and ath
letes who worked with Scheyer on the UW
softball team and in the university's athlet
ic department, one official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
The investigation will be conducted by
the U.S. Attorney's Office, the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration and
the State Patrol's drug-investigation unit,
the official said.
State Patrol spokesman Nelsa Brodie
confirmed Wednesday that three detectives
and a sergeant from the patrol's narcotics
unit will investigate for the U.S. Attorney's
Office, along with the Drug Enforcement
Administration. All of the patrol's investi
gators have experience with cases involving
pharmaceuticals, Brodie said.
Brodie said the investigation would also
focus on Edward Matsuwaka, a former
pharmacist in Seattle, who provided med
ications to Scheyer.
In a prepared statement, Washington

State Patrol Chief Ronal Serpas said the
first step will be to outline the scope of the
investigation.
Serpas said the U.S. Attorney's Office
plans to review the investigation and bring
charges if warranted.
The investigation represents another
blow to the UW, which in March
from a four-year federal criminal investiga
tion into the overbilling of Medicare and
Medicaid by UW doctors.
Scheyer's attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr.,
said last night that Scheyer "has had a long
and distinguished career as a well-respect
ed sports doctor" and, since 1986, has
worked closely with officials at UW - in
cluding trainers, administrators and other
personnel in the athletic department - to
provide medical care to its athletes. Schey
er has "cooperated to date with state inves
tigators in their ongoing investigation, and
will continue to do so," Vance said.
Scheyer worked with various UW athlet
ic programs, including the football and bas
ketball teams, from 1986 to 1999. He re
mained as a team doctor and then a volunteer
for the UW Softball team until he was re
moved by Athletic Director Barbara Hedges
shortly before his license was suspended.
UW officials declined to comment last
night on the criminal investigation involv
ing Scheyer.
The state medical commission suspend
ed Scheyer's license after investigators
found he improperly provided thousands
of painkillers, tranquilizers, sedatives and

prescription drugs to trainers and members
of the softball team, sometimes without
medical examinations or documentation.
Scheyer, 76, admitted in a signed state
ment to state medical investigators that he
had improperly passed out medications to
athletes and trainers, written prescriptions
for patients who never received the drugs,
and failed to keep a record of thousands of
doses of narcotic pain pills, muscle relax
ants, steroid gels and other medications.
Scheyer prescribed testosterone gel, a
steroid, in a softball player's name. State
officials think they were for his own back
problems, but investigators haven't ruled
out that steroids were provided to others.
The state medical investigation uncov
ered that Scheyer opened unauthorized ac
counts, some with the UW's name, at phar
macies in Seattle and Kirkland, bypassing
the UW's system in which all prescriptions
to UW athletes were to be filled by a cam
pus pharmacy.
As part of his statement to state medical
investigators, Scheyer admitted he con
spired with Matsuwaka to obtain medica
tions for UW athletes. In some cases, drugs
prescribed to one athlete were given to
trainers to provide to others.
UW officials launched an internal in
quiry into the matter last week.
The criminal investigation will focus on
whether federal or state laws governing the
distribution of prescription drugs, particu
larly highly controlled medications, were
broken.
