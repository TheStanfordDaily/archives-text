# Young Conservatives list biased professors

### ELLIOT BLACKBURN THE DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) The University of Texas
chapter of the Young Conservatives of
Texas released a list of 10 professors Thurs
day who the group says indoctrinate stu
dents and are biased in their instruction.
The group had originally hoped to re
lease the list at the beginning of the week to
coincide with registration for the spring 2004
semester. YCT said its research was based
on visits to the professors' classes and a re
view of required reading material.
"We can account for every name on the
list. We can defend every selection," said
YCT chairman Austin Kinghora.
The group insists the list is not intended
to advocate retaliation against the profes
sors or to demand changes in the teaching
styles of the professors.
Most of the professors are in the College
of Liberal Arts. Eight of the professors are
described as having a liberal bias. One pro
fessor is considered conservative, and anoth
er professor is described as having a pro-
Palestinian, anti- American bias.
Edmund Gordon, director of the anthro
pology department and one of the profes
sors included on the list, said he was not sur
prised that his name was included and was
not ashamed to be on the list.

"I'm not sure that anybody is able to
teach a course that is fully objective," he
said. "I would certainly claim, I think with
some pride, that I teach a course from the
perspective of African-Americans, and that
is a healthy perspective to have on campus."
The group also listed three government
professors who YCT believes are objective
and balanced in their lecturing.
Liberal Arts Dean Richard Lariviere said
students are smart enough to judge a profes
sor's lecture for themselves.
"In some sense, this is an exercise in
naivete; [the idea] that faculty are indoctri
nating students in some form or another," he
said.
So long as students can challenge the pro
fessor, it is healthy for professors to teach
their interpretations of a topic to their stu
dents, he said.
Sitting at a West Mall table with a stack of
30 copies of the list, Kinghora said only a few
students had stopped by to take a copy, and
he was not surprised.
"I really don't expect too many people to
be picking them up," he said. "I believe we'll
have a lot of hits on the Web."
Lariviere said some concerned professors
had approached him about the list.
"I had a couple of professors worried that
they wouldn't be on it," he said.
