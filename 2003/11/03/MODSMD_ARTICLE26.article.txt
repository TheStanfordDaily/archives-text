# American flag causes controvesy on campus

(KRT) St. Louis University students
Tom Lundeen and Nicholas Payne never
thought that flying a flag, particularly the
American flag, could cause such controver
sy. But it has, pitting them and an Ohio con
gressman against university president the
Rev. Lawrence Biondi and other university
officials.
Payne, 21, a business major from Cincin
nati, and Lundeen, 21, a business major from
Cleveland, were given until Oct. 24 to re
move the Stars and Stripes from outside
their on-campus apartment, or have it re
moved for them and possibly be fined.
The flag has been draped across the metal
railing of their third-floor balcony since
shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
2001. The students were told by school offi
cials to remove the flag about a month after
they hung it, because, school officials said, it
violated school policy on flying any flag and
other paraphernalia from dormitory bal
conies.
But then for more than two years, they
never heard another word about it.
"The issue just kind of disappeared,"
Payne said.
At least until Oct. 14. That's when they
were hand-delivered a sternly worded letter
warning them to take the flag down by 5 p.m.
the next day or face the consequences. After
they didn't, they got a second letter a few
days later, their final warning, telling them it
had to be down by Friday or they would be
fined.
For help, Payne wrote his congressman,
Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, chairman of the
House Subcommittee on the Constitution.
Chabot fired off a letter to Biondi asking the
school to reconsider.
"I was surprised when I learned of the
university's decision to prevent Mr. Payne
from flying his American flag from the bal
cony of his on-campus apartment," Chabot
wrote. "I respectfully urge you to give Mr.
Payne full consideration in resolving this
matter consistent with all applicable laws
and regulations."
But on the morning of the deadline, Bion
di remained firm.
"It is not a question of the flag, or even a
student's patriotism," he wrote in a letter to
Chabot. "Instead, it is a general policy on
our campus meant to assure an atmosphere
advantageous to all ideas and belief systems,
an appearance of cleanliness and avoidance
of a cluttered appearance because of assort
ed objects handing from balconies, including
clothing, towels, blankets, lights flags, etc."
But as the 5 p.m. deadline came, the uni

versity relented, at least for now.
"In light of the fact that he went almost
two years without them hearing from us
again, and the flag was allowed to continue
to fly, I think we owe him the consideration
to take a look at how this has been handled,"
said Jeff Fowler, the university's spokesman.
"Will we look at the policy again? I don't
know. There probably needs to be dialogue
between the student and the university, and
maybe there can be a resolution that pleases
everybody."
At issue is a university policy that states:
"Nothing is to be hung from balcony/patio,
including but without limitation to flags,
strands of lights, wind chimes, or any other
items. Violation may result in confiscation of
such items for the remainder of the academ
ic year."
School officials say the policy goes back
at least four years, long before the terrorist
attacks.
Fowler said the policy initially prohibited
anything from hanging but did not specify
any particular items.
The policy was put into place for two rea
sons, he said, safety and appropriateness.
"Some of the apartments are high, and if
something fell and hit someone down below,
somebody could be hurt," he said. "And
there's also the issue of liability.
"Second is that something inappropriate
could be hung, something that would be of
fensive. Clearly, most people would have
something appropriate, but what about
something that isn't? What do you do about
that, where do you draw the line between
what can be and what can't be?"
But Lundeen, Payne and other students
say they believe the policy regarding flags
was put into effect this year. They say they
looked in the student handbook in 2001 to
see if flags were banned and couldn't find
any reference to them.
"It's odd that they say they've had this
policy for four years, yet this is the first year
that they decided to pick to enforce it,"
Payne said.
The issue of flags has come up at other
universities. For example, Texas A&M Uni
versity in College Station, Texas, has banned
the flying of American flags from dormitory
windows, citing safety hazards and a school
policy that generally bans the display of
items outside windows.
Payne said he's pleased that the universi
ty has decided to reconsider its position, but
he's not optimistic about the outcome.
"I don't think they have my best interest at
heart," he said. "If they had been more will
ing to work with me earlier, I might be less
apprehensive."
