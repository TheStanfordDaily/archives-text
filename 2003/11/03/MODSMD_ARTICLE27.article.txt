# Plasma donations yield profit
## 
### ELLYN ANGELOTTI UNIVERSITY DAILY KANSAN 
(U-WIRE) Justin Montgomery's
use of needles has resulted in visible veins
called track marks on both of his arms. Al
though his parents do not approve, the
University of Kansas junior says the money
is good.
"My parents tell me to get a real job, but
giving plasma is a good way to get quick
cash," says Montgomery, who hails from
Topeka, Kan.
The cash he makes is nice, he says, but
he assures his parents his main motivation
is to save lives.
Plasma is the liquid part of the blood,
which is composed of 90 percent water and
10 percent protein. Plasma is commonly
used to help hemophiliacs, whose blood
does not clot properly. Plasma also pro
duces albumin, a fluid replacement for
burn and trauma victims.
Montgomery, a donor of both blood and
plasma, began donating blood because he
wanted to help burn victims. Food and
Drug Administration restrictions prohibit
donors from giving plasma for 90 days after
they give blood, prompting Montgomery
to donate plasma.
Because plasma is primarily water and
more easily replaced than the red blood
cells that compose blood, donors can give
plasma twice a week. Blood donors must
wait 56 days before giving again. And plas
ma donors are paid, while blood donors are
not. Montgomery says he opts to give plas

ma so he can still help save lives and make
money doing it.
"I've probably made over $3OO since
I've started," Montgomery says.
He does not have a job. To help pay for
his expenses, he has been donating plasma
for more than two years, Montgomery says.
Plasma donors can make as much as $5O a
week, $2O for the initial visit and $3O for the
second.
While people are paid for plasma, the
larger demand is for blood supply. Right
now, the American Red Cross depends on
a three-day blood supply, meaning that
with no new donations, the supply would
fulfill the need for blood in the Kansas and
Northern Oklahoma area for three days.
While it takes 10 to 15 minutes to donate
a pint of blood, it can take as long as two
hours to give plasma. The time difference
between donating blood and plasma is a re
sult of the procedure. Both processes re
quire drawing blood, but giving plasma
consists of both a draw cycle and a return
cycle when the actual blood cells are put
back into the donor through the same nee
dle.
Michael Kanter, assistant manager of
the Lawrence Plasma Center in Lawrence
says plasma separates from the heavier red
and white blood cells during plasma dona
tion. The blood cells collect in a reservoir,
while the plasma gathers into a separate
container. When the reservoir is full, the
return cycle begins, and the blood is put
back into the donor's arm. Donors go
through 10 to 12 full cycles during each do

nation. The whole process can take as long
as two hours, depending on the size of the
donor's vein.
Anne Wempe, a KU junior also from
Topeka, has been donating blood since she
was in high school. She says she donates
blood because she knows it is for a good
cause. This summer when Wempe needed
cash, she decided to give plasma.
"It's a longer process and the needle is
in your arm for at least 45 minutes, but
other than that I felt the same after giving
plasma as I did when I gave blood,"
Wempe says.
Kanter says the center pays people for
their time. "Altruistically it would be bet
ter, and it would be better for business if
people gave us their plasma for free, but we
know more people will give if they are
paid," Kanter says.
The staff members at the plasma center,
including Kanter, do not need to be regis
tered nurses. The German Health Author
ity, the group that regulates the plasma
center, requires a registered nurse to be in
the building from the time a needle goes in
until a needle comes out. Despite being
regulated internationally, the plasma cen
ters still must meet the same FDA restric
tions that blood centers do.
"If you can donate blood, you can do
nate plasma," Kanter says.
Montgomery says that he likes that he
can give plasma once or twice a month.
"You can't go wrong with the cash," he
says, "But really, I'm all about saving
lives."
