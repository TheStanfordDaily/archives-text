# Speech calls for dialogue in Middle East
## Former Israeli politician says action is necessary 
### ZACH DEMBO 
Former Israeli politician Yossi Beilin
showed cautious optimism about the on
going Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a
speech Sunday evening, sponsored by the
Taube Center for Jewish Studies and orga
nized by Hillel.
Beilin, who was a member of the Israeli
parliament for 11 years and occupied nu
merous ministerial positions, is currently
working on a joint agreement between
members of the states of Israel and Pales
tine to be used as a model for future nego
tiations.
"The biggest mistake in [the Oslo peace
accords] was not to finish the job, to go for
an interim agreement for five years,"
Beilin said. "What is important is to show
the world that a permanent agreement be
tween Israelis and the Palestinians is pos
sible."
Beilin emphasized the need for imme
diate action due to the increasing number
of Palestinians within the disputed re
gions.
"In 2010, there will be a majority of
Palestinians, and what then? A minority
[ruling] over a majority," Beilin said.
He predicted a dire future for Israel if
negotiations are not initiated.
"If we do not have a border, Israel will
be neither Jewish nor democratic," he
said.
Beilin remained guardedly hopeful that
such a border will be created.
"I've never been euphoric about the
process since its inception," he said. "We
are building something that is very diffi
cult . . . that is undoubtedly against the
tide. The gap between official understand
ings and the emotions and feelings of peo
ple in their bellies is a significant one."
Still, Beilin expressed optimism that
"we will succeed."
Some students in the audience said they
agreed with Beilin that peace is a possibil
ity.
"Peace, in its idealized form, cannot
exist between Israelis and Palestinians,"
freshman Ryanne Brown said. "However,
perhaps they can coexist without animosi
ty."
But not everyone in attendance was
sold on Beilin's concept for a permanent
Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
"I thought he wavered between a clear
position and things meant for domestic
consumption in Israel," said graduate stu
dent Alex Kuo. "Still, I'm sympathetic
with his position."
Adina Danzig, the interim director of
Hillel, said the purpose of inviting Beilin
to speak was to add to campus discourse
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"Hillel supports the existence of Israel
as a Jewish democratic state," Danzig
said. "It fits within our mission to bring
speakers from a broad spectrum of politi
cal views who will educate the community.
My hope is that students will come, ask
tough questions and formulate their own
opinions."
Sophomore Jonathan Elkin, a member
of the student board of Hillel, said his or
ganization "hoped the talk will present a
message of hope for the quagmire we are
in now."
