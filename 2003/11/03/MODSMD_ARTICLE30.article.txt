# Students celebrate Diwali
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Vineet Bhagwat's mother
flew in from Maryland to watch her son
perform in this year's "Diwali Dhamaka
2003," a cultural show held Saturday night
and organized by Sanskriti and the Stan
ford India Association, two South Asian
student groups.
"I think my mom came once she found
out that I got the solo for the a cappella
act," Bhagwat said. "Knowing that I had
my mom in the audience taping my every
move gave me extra motivation to give it
my all. The experience was really fun be
cause it was a way for me to express my cul
ture and my identity."
The show was held in honor of Diwali, a
festival of lights celebrated in India and
throughout the world to welcome the Indi
an New Year.
"It was really a wonderful show," said
Medha Bhagwat, Vineet's mother. "The
students worked so hard and put so much
energy into the show. I'm amazed at their
talent. I wish I was that talented."
The show featured various dance, in
strumental and vocal performances, in
cluding classical, folk, bhangra and hip-hop
numbers. There were also three speakers
who shared their Diwali experiences.

"It's been a team effort everyone
wanted to do a good job," said senior Sai
Patil, who was a leader and dancer in the
Bharata Natyam performance, a spiritual
and classical Indian dance form.
"We had a good audience to appreciate
our hard work," Patil added. "We could
feel their energy, and that made it worth
it."
There were five undergraduate acts and
five graduate student acts in the show. Per
formers each put in up to 40 hours of prac
tice to prepare for the night.
"I thought the show was really good,"
said sophomore Katherine Hill. "I had
never been to anything like this before. I
have a lot of Indian friends and now I know
more about their culture."
One of the show's highlights was a per
formance by Raagapella, a South Asian
vocal group that is the newest addition to
Stanford's a cappella community. The
group debuted at last year's Diwali show
with only four members and has now
grown to 14 members.
"I thought it was awesome," said fresh
man Omar Shakir. "I got to see different
aspects of Indian culture and friends who
had talents that I never knew about."
One of the objectives of the Diwali
show is to give new freshmen and graduate
students a chance to come together to

showcase their talents. However, many
students were not too pleased with the
graduate student performances.
"I enjoyed most of the acts, but the grad
student ones were much weaker," said a
sophomore who asked to remain anony
mous. "I think the show would have been
better if it had been just undergrad perfor
mances, like Mela in the spring. They
should have at least let the undergrads do
the bhangra."
The event festivities started at 4 p.m.
with a rangoli competition for graduate
students, where students made designs
with different colors of sand. There was
also free mehndi, or henna tattoos, for stu
dents. At 6 p.m., free Indian food was pro
vided for attendees, including samosas,
chai tea and desserts.
"The show is a way for people to
come celebrate and enjoy the South
Asian festival of Diwali, especially
when they are far from home and can
not celebrate with their families," said
event organizer Kosha Shah, a sopho
more. "Since Diwali is a vibrant, joyous
holiday, we try to authentically repli
cate the atmosphere and excitement of
Diwali that a lot of people miss, while
educating others about Diwali and
South Asian culture in general through
the show."
