# Power plant workers negotiate new contract
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
In a four-year contract finalized on Fri
day afternoon, Cardinal Cogen power plant
workers won wage increases and the right to
participate in some union activities. The for
mer three-year contract expired at midnight
on Friday.
The new contract, which has already
taken effect, will allow for a 4 percent
wage increase after the first year and a
guaranteed 3 percent wage increase in
the second, third and fourth years of the
contract.
General Electric also offered the
workers incentive-based bonuses that
allow for possible wage increases of up to
4 percent in the last three years of the
contract, contingent upon perfect scores
in quarterly performance-based evalua
tions.
Coming into negotiations on Friday,
General Electric, the parent company of the

plant, had offered the workers a three year
contract with a 1 percent increase in wages
each year without considering their scores
on the evaluation.
Kenneth Helm, a union negotiator repre
senting the workers, said that workers were
concerned because if they got low scores,
they would not receive enough wage in
creases.
Another point of contention was that
General Electric did not propose to change
language in the contract forbidding the
workers from participating in any union ac
tivities.
In the new contract, workers are allowed
to participate in union activities and hand
out leaflets, as long as none of their actions
are considered disparaging to the company.
Helm said that the workers were pleased
by the final contract.
"The workers are excited about the terms
in the contract and are glad to see that the
management finally sees that they are mem
bers of a larger community," Helm said.
