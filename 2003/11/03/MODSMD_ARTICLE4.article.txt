One year after University Provost John
Etchemendy announced Stanford's $4O million
general funds deficit to the Faculty Senate, the fac
ulty and staff are feeling the effects of the tightened
budget in the form of a salary freeze.
Typically, faculty and staff salaries increase by
about 3 percent to 4 percent each year, according
to Robert Weisberg, special assistant to the
Provost for Faculty Recruitment and Retention.
This year's freeze was put into place for the
academic year to avoid laying off employees and
increasing tuition and fees by too much. The im
petus for this decision comes from the blow dealt
to Stanford's pocketbook by a weak economy, ris
ing costs of benefits, an increase in projected stu
dent aid expenses and a decrease in the Universi
ty's unrestricted endowment, Etchemendy said.
'Bad choices'
A faculty member in the math department

called the freeze "symbolically significant." Though
it hasn't had an enormous impact on his life, he said,
it would have been nice to have been rewarded by
the University as a form of appreciation.
"The freeze hit staff, as well as assistant and as
sociate professors, the hardest," said English Prof.
John Bender. "But it was a good one-time strategy
because it was straightforward as compared with
the elaborate committees, and resulting conflicts,
we saw here during the financial crisis of the late
1980s and early 19905."
Still, some staff members expressed frustration.
"It's a problem when the prices of things go up
but your income doesn't," one staff member said,
who asked to remain anonymous.
She felt that the administration has been making
"bad choices," and said current building and land
scaping projects should be a lower priority than
"paying the people who do the actual teaching."
But according to University President John
Hennessy, enough energy had been put into mak
ing salaries competitive over the past few years
that, "[We] felt that we could tolerate a one-year
freeze compared to the alternatives," he said.
Budget troubles
Many of Stanford's peer institutions, including

Princeton and Harvard, have not instituted salary
freezes for faculty or staff, though they have im
posed other budgetary restrictions. Princeton is in
a "relatively fortunate position" for the 2004 fiscal
year, according to the Report of the Priorities
Committee to the President, which led only to a
"modest increase" in tuition, room and board. The
report also states that Princeton has "ambitious
plans to continue to recruit and retain the best pos
sible faculty and staff."
According to Etchemendy, the universities less
affected by the economic climate have larger en
dowments per student, which "provide a better
cushion in economic downturns."
Etchemendy pointed out that the freeze alone
has generated a savings of $8 million in the general
funds budget. Achieving the same savings through
other means would have required either a 9 per
cent tuition increase or an additional 100 staff lay
offs.
The University instituted the freeze this Sep
tember with the intention of ending it after one
year, Etchemendy said.
He said that Stanford's faculty salaries are
among the highest in the nation and that extending

the freeze beyond one year could compromise
the University's ability to "stay competitive" with
other schools. In order to save even more jobs,
both Hennessy and Etchemendy took voluntary
5 percent salary reductions.
"We believed it was important to save as many
jobs as possible," he said.
Staying competitive
According to Weisberg, the one-year freeze has
not significantly affected the University's ability to
compete with other universities for faculty mem
bers.
"I don't think it's raised any competitive issues
with other universities," he said. "Not that we
don't face those competitive pressures, but the
freeze isn't the problem on this core."
Weisberg said that the freeze has been flexible
and that Stanford's schools have been able to
make exceptions for particular faculty members
who may be the subject of a retention effort.
He said he does not foresee any faculty mem
bers leaving because of this year's freeze.
"I am unaware of a single case where a faculty
member has said he or she was leaving or might
leave solely because of the freeze or even because
the person took the freeze as a sign that future
raises might not be very high," he said.
Tough economy
In the context of the current economic cli

mate, the financial situation at Stanford is not
unique. Former governor Gray Davis' budget
proposal for the University of California schools
included no money for salary increases.
Etchemendy said that "some other universi
ties have been hit even harder," and are dealing
with "equivalent or even worse shortfalls" than
Stanford.
"Some universities have frozen salaries, many
have reduced the size of their faculty, almost all
have raised tuition significantly," he said.
Brown University instituted a hiring freeze
last December. Duke University significantly
reduced its faculty search. The University of
California system is suffering what
Etchemendy called "a much more serious bud
get shortfall."
Harvard's endowment this year lacks the pur
chasing power it had in previous years, according
to Joe Wrinn, director of news and public affairs
at Harvard.
"We are feeling the effects of the current eco
nomic times," he said.
The University's financial situation is not
unique in Silicon Valley, either.
"Many people in Silicon Valley have seen
salary freezes several corporations are in their
third year of a salary freeze," Hennessy said.
Indeed, companies such as Intel, Cisco and
See Commerce have all had to institute either
salary freezes or reductions in pay increases and
bonuses to cope with budgetary constraints.
In spite of Stanford's financial situation,
Etchemendy said he would not extend salary
freezes beyond this year, "except in truly disas
trous circumstances."
"We fully intend to maintain our competitive
position," he said.

freeze compared to the alternatives," he said.
Budget troubles
Many of Stanford's peer institutions, including

Princeton and Harvard, have not instituted salary
freezes for faculty or staff, though they have im
posed other budgetary restrictions. Princeton is in
a "relatively fortunate position" for the 2004 fiscal
year, according to the Report of the Priorities
Committee to the President, which led only to a
"modest increase" in tuition, room and board. The
report also states that Princeton has "ambitious
plans to continue to recruit and retain the best pos
sible faculty and staff."
According to Etchemendy, the universities less
affected by the economic climate have larger en
dowments per student, which "provide a better
cushion in economic downturns."
Etchemendy pointed out that the freeze alone
has generated a savings of $8 million in the general
funds budget. Achieving the same savings through
other means would have required either a 9 per
cent tuition increase or an additional 100 staff lay
offs.
The University instituted the freeze this Sep
tember with the intention of ending it after one
year, Etchemendy said.
He said that Stanford's faculty salaries are
among the highest in the nation and that extending

the freeze beyond one year could compromise
the University's ability to "stay competitive" with
other schools. In order to save even more jobs,
both Hennessy and Etchemendy took voluntary
5 percent salary reductions.
"We believed it was important to save as many
jobs as possible," he said.
Staying competitive
According to Weisberg, the one-year freeze has
not significantly affected the University's ability to
compete with other universities for faculty mem
bers.
"I don't think it's raised any competitive issues
with other universities," he said. "Not that we
don't face those competitive pressures, but the
freeze isn't the problem on this core."
Weisberg said that the freeze has been flexible
and that Stanford's schools have been able to
make exceptions for particular faculty members
who may be the subject of a retention effort.
He said he does not foresee any faculty mem
bers leaving because of this year's freeze.
"I am unaware of a single case where a faculty
member has said he or she was leaving or might
leave solely because of the freeze or even because
the person took the freeze as a sign that future
raises might not be very high," he said.
Tough economy
In the context of the current economic cli

mate, the financial situation at Stanford is not
unique. Former governor Gray Davis' budget
proposal for the University of California schools
included no money for salary increases.
Etchemendy said that "some other universi
ties have been hit even harder," and are dealing
with "equivalent or even worse shortfalls" than
Stanford.
"Some universities have frozen salaries, many
have reduced the size of their faculty, almost all
have raised tuition significantly," he said.
Brown University instituted a hiring freeze
last December. Duke University significantly
reduced its faculty search. The University of
California system is suffering what
Etchemendy called "a much more serious bud
get shortfall."
Harvard's endowment this year lacks the pur
chasing power it had in previous years, according
to Joe Wrinn, director of news and public affairs
at Harvard.
"We are feeling the effects of the current eco
nomic times," he said.
The University's financial situation is not
unique in Silicon Valley, either.
"Many people in Silicon Valley have seen
salary freezes several corporations are in their
third year of a salary freeze," Hennessy said.
Indeed, companies such as Intel, Cisco and
See Commerce have all had to institute either
salary freezes or reductions in pay increases and
bonuses to cope with budgetary constraints.
In spite of Stanford's financial situation,
Etchemendy said he would not extend salary
freezes beyond this year, "except in truly disas
trous circumstances."
"We fully intend to maintain our competitive
position," he said.

examining the role of money in the lives of people who
work, live and study at Stanford

One year after University Provost John
Etchemendy announced Stanford's $4O million
general funds deficit to the Faculty Senate, the fac
ulty and staff are feeling the effects of the tightened
budget in the form of a salary freeze.
Typically, faculty and staff salaries increase by
about 3 percent to 4 percent each year, according
to Robert Weisberg, special assistant to the
Provost for Faculty Recruitment and Retention.
This year's freeze was put into place for the
academic year to avoid laying off employees and
increasing tuition and fees by too much. The im
petus for this decision comes from the blow dealt
to Stanford's pocketbook by a weak economy, ris
ing costs of benefits, an increase in projected stu
dent aid expenses and a decrease in the Universi
ty's unrestricted endowment, Etchemendy said.
'Bad choices'
A faculty member in the math department

called the freeze "symbolically significant." Though
it hasn't had an enormous impact on his life, he said,
it would have been nice to have been rewarded by
the University as a form of appreciation.
"The freeze hit staff, as well as assistant and as
sociate professors, the hardest," said English Prof.
John Bender. "But it was a good one-time strategy
because it was straightforward as compared with
the elaborate committees, and resulting conflicts,
we saw here during the financial crisis of the late
1980s and early 19905."
Still, some staff members expressed frustration.
"It's a problem when the prices of things go up
but your income doesn't," one staff member said,
who asked to remain anonymous.
She felt that the administration has been making
"bad choices," and said current building and land
scaping projects should be a lower priority than
"paying the people who do the actual teaching."
But according to University President John
Hennessy, enough energy had been put into mak
ing salaries competitive over the past few years
that, "[We] felt that we could tolerate a one-year
freeze compared to the alternatives," he said.
