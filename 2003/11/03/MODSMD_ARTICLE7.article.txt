## Assaulting the Silence 
### MARYF. ALBERT 
As you read this, someone within 20 miles of your comfy seat in a lecture hall off
the Quad is being battered by his or her partner. Around 1,000 cases of domestic
violence are prosecuted by the San Mateo County District Attorney's office each
year. Of those cases, between 80 and 95 percent of defendants are found guilty. And
the District Attorney's office has managed this caseload despite budget cuts.

At 9:40 p.m. on a Sunday evening, a young Latino woman, bleeding from her face,
was found sobbing in an East Palo Alto drugstore. A concerned bystander had di
aled 911 and asked police to attend to the injured woman, who spoke little En
glish. The department would need to send a Spanish-speaking officer.
When police officers and paramedics arrived, the young woman explained, between
gasps, that her husband had beaten her. She refused to provide her name or address. She
rejected medical attention.

The young woman ran her hands through her hair compul
sively, saying over and over, "I just want to go back to El Sal
vador. Why can't I go back to El Salvador?" Her light blue
pants were stained with blood wiped from her face.
An older woman quietly hovered nearby. She did not pro
vide information about the woman's identity. After the medics
left, the two women walked home, and the older one called to
onlookers, over her shoulder, "She will be just fine."
Breaking the silence is what the activities of Domestic Vio
lence Awareness Month of October were designed to promote.
October has now passed, but domestic violence remains a sig
nificant problem. On average, the East Palo Alto Police De
partment handles 40 cases every month.
"We know that there is a high rate of domestic violence in
East Palo Alto," said Erika Guzman, Support Services Direc
tor of San Mateo's Community Overcoming Relationship
Abuse (CORA) center.
"Sadly, domestic violence usually goes on for a while before
it gets reported," said Lt. Rahn Sibley, Public Information Of
ficer of the East Palo Alto Police Department.
Cases go unreported for a variety of reasons.
April Dunham, director of San Mateo's Violence in Fami
lies' Prevention Initiative Program, explained, "In communi
ties of color there is, in some cases, a reluctance to call law en
forcement due to experiences with them in that community,"
Dunham said. "Also, immigration status is another barrier to
seeking assistance. Both of these would be factors for East
Palo Alto."
Almost 44 percent of East Palo Alto residents are foreign
born, and 70 percent are nonwhite, according to 2000 census
figures.

Compounding the problem, portrayal of domestic violence in the media tends to ac
centuate the physical domestic violence, while ignoring less visible forms of violence.
"The media's coverage, which tends to portray victims with visible cuts or bruises, also

affects reporting," Guzman said. "Many survivors do not consider themselves victims until
they develop cuts or bruises. Even police can underreport cases of abuse, paging us when
they determine someone has been abused based on their understanding of 'violence.' "
Violence can occur in a variety of non-physical ways as well, according to San Mateo's
Center for Domestic Violence. Partner-inflicted violence can take many forms: emotional,
verbal, physical, sexual or financial abuse can occur.
Since the East Palo Alto police department's domestic violence prevention program
was eliminated during 2001 budget cuts, Sibley said, "We [have been] trying to revive our

program. In the meantime, we've tried to make our reporting pro
cess better."
East Palo Alto is not unique in its struggle with domestic vio
lence. San Mateo's Center for Domestic Violence reports that the
problem crops up across social, economic, cultural, educational
and religious boundaries.
In an effort to combat the problem throughout the county,
Rose Jacobs Gibson, a supervisor in San Mateo County, declared
October Domestic Violence Awareness Month. As part of aware
ness efforts last month, the county organized a walk, a conference
and a white ribbon campaign encouraging men to speak out on the
issue.
Elaine Tipton, supervisor of San Mateo County's domestic vi
olence program, described the district attorney's efforts to prose
cute offenders as "extremely proactive." In 1994, the district at
torney created a domestic violence unit with specialized attorneys.
"Having dedicated specialists is important because domestic vi
olence cases tend to be more difficult than ordinary cases," said
Tipton. "Victims often do not want to press charges against their
offenders."
The district attorney's office annually receives about 1,500 re
ports from the county's 22 police departments. About 1,000 de
fendants are prosecuted annually. Of those, 85 to 90 percent are
found guilty. All convicted offenders undergo a minimum of 104
hours of counseling. Many are sent to prison.
"Through education, we try to get people to think about the
inter-generational and social impact of domestic violence," Tip
ton said. "Children who grow up witnessing domestic violence in
their homes are more likely to commit crimes as adults."
At CORA, as community awareness of domestic violence
has grown, the number of reported incidents has increased. The
data spike is interpreted as reflecting that victims are more

likely to report incidents when they learn more about the issue. According to Guzman,
this is a positive development, showing that "domestic violence is no longer a dirty lit
tle secret."

Assaulting the Silence
A Two-Part Series
"Assaulting the Silence" is
a Features series about
local approaches to
domestic violence. This
issue's article, part one of
the series, examines efforts
to raise consciousness of
domestic violence issues in
East Palo Alto. This prob
lem is not confined to East
Palo Alto, however; look
for an upcoming article
about Stanford students'
experiences with domestic
violence.


ANDREA COX/The Stanford Daily
Victims of domestic violence are often ashamed to come forward due to concerns about retribution from their partners and negative community perception. In communities such as East Palo
Alto, where there is a large immigrant population, this problem is magnified by worries about drawing the attention of immigration officials, as well as by lower awareness of the issue.
