## Students must vote tomorrow 
### 
Stanford community members will
head to the polls tomorrow to cast
their votes for Santa Clara County
electoral races. While the recall elec
tion that came to a climactic close last
month might have attracted a great deal of
media attention due to an unprecedented
turn of events, we believe this month's elec
tion is also an important democratic process
that citizens should be informed about and
participate in.
Voters will need to cast their ballots for up to
three of the candidates running for the govern
ing board of the Foothill-De Anza Community
College District. We support Norman John
Shaskey for the position, as he has had exten
sive past experience in city government, as well
as in state- and national-level efforts to improve
education. While serving in positions such as
mayor of Mountain View ana as a Foothill-De
Anza Community College trustee, he has
gained valuable knowledge that he can apply to
help coordinate community college policy both
in the best interest of students ana, more im
portantly, in a manner that takes into consider
ation the structural constraints and resource
limitations of the district.
Andrea Leiderman would be a solid choice
as a governing board member for the commu
nity college district. She has served on the
Foothill-De Anza Community College District
Board since last year and also has had 10 years
of experience in educational matters on the
Santa Clara County Board of Education. These
are important leadership roles that would
allow her to have an informed voice as a mem
ber of the governing board.
Lastly, Betsy Bechtel is also a strong candi
date for the governing board. She has extensive
experience in city government, with nine years
on the Palo Alto City Council, serving two
years as vice mayor and one year as mayor. She
has served as president of the Foothill-De
Anza Foundation. And given current shortfalls
in budgets across the state, we applaud her ap
proach to advocate "excellence in education

with fiscal prudence." Her extensive back
ground in business would aid in helping the
board make decisions that maximize the utility
of expenditures.
Voters also will need to decide on their top
three choices among candidates running for
the governing board of the Palo Alto Unified
School District. Incumbent Mandy Lowell
has performed well so far as a board member.
She helped fight the state's move to take
property taxes away from local schools, which
would have resulted in cuts to school funding
by up to 25 percent. Her 15 years in law ana
her service on California Department of Ed
ucation review panels give her additional ex
perience, bolstering her ability to make criti
cal decisions regarding the district's educa
tional policies.
Incumbent Gail Price has worked on the
board previously and helped combat the
state's efforts to take funding away from local
schools. Additionally, her support for pro
grams that foster educational equality and
class-size reduction are important steps to
ward ensuring that all children receive a com
plete education.
Camille Townsend would also be a valu
able contribution to the board. Her efforts
earlier this year to mobilize parents against
the diversion of local property taxes to the
state in a letter-writing campaign were rec
ognized with a "Leadership in Legislative
Advocacy Award," and we believe she
would continue with similar efforts to help
the students of the district if elected. Her
experience as PTA president, site council
representative and PTA executive board
member give her important background and
insight on the education process and local
school issues.
We hope that community members will ex
ercise their right to vote and voice their opin
ions tomorrow. Local students are relying on
them it is critical that voters make sound
choices to ensure a bright educational future
for everyone.
