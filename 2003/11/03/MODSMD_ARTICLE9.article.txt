# Distribution policy can't be enforced
## 
### 
The Stanford Progressive was dis
tributed door-to-door in residences
across campus on Saturday. By deliv
ering copies of their paper in this
manner, The Progressive violated a Residen
tial Education policy reiterated at last
Wednesday's Publications Board meeting
that disallows door-to-door solicitation or
distribution in dorms unless written permis
sion to do so is posted. A number of the
dorms that The Progressive delivered its pa
pers to did not explicitly offer such autho
rization. Thus, The Progressive protested the
unjust distribution policy by refusing to rec
ognize it.
This action by The Stanford Progres
sive, taken days after Wednesday's meet
ing, indicates that Residential Educa
tion's restriction will be difficult to mon
itor and enforce. Currently, resident fel
lows decide whether or not their dorm
will receive publications. We believe
that this approach is overly decentral

ized, allowing for too many inconsisten
cies across residences. The policy should
be uniform so that student groups and
publications see where they can stand
literally.
We do not think it is appropriate that a
resident fellow decides for an entire dorm
whether or not students will be able to re
ceive campus publications. Residents
should be able to make the decision on their
own. If students are uncomfortable receiv
ing publications at their doors, they can post
notes on their doors stating that they do not
want to receive certain publications. The mi
nority of students who object to publication
distribution should not have the power to si
lence the voice of campus publications for
everyone else.
Residential Education's current publica
tion policy should be modified to better fit
the needs of Stanford students. Until a
change is made, student publications should
continue to ignore the current policy.
