# Trustees approve new pre-paid tuition plan
## 
### ERICK FLORES STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees has approved the im
plementation of a pre-paid tuition plan that could
significantly change the way future applicants fi
nance their college education at Stanford.
Tuition costs nationwide have nearly doubled
in the past 13 years, and the University is hoping
the plan, called the Independent 529 Plan, will
mitigate the burden of rising tuition by providing
an incentive for middle- and lower-income fami
lies to get a head start on saving money for their
children's education at any of 300 universities
participating in the plan.
Under the new program, families will be able
to purchase certificates to cover a certain per
centage of a year's tuition well before their chil
dren even apply to college. Payments on the plan
can be made over several years and anyone can
contribute money to an individual's plan once it
has been started. One of its most appealing qual
ities is that parents will get a 0.5 percent discount
on Stanford's annual tuition should they choose
to commit to the plan.
Aside from the discount, the plan is free of
federal taxes and will protect against tuition in
flation. If a family buys a certificate for a year's
tuition in 2004, for example, and then applies it in
2014 when their child enrolls, the certificate will
still pay for a year's tuition even though tuition
costs may have risen over the span of 10 years.
"The revolutionary aspect of this plan is that it
guarantees a particular level of tuition in the fu
ture," said Education Prof. Myra Strober. "This
feature is likely to be attractive to families who
are concerned that because tuition is rising faster
than per capita income, they may have difficulty
paying for their children's tuition in the future."
Helpful or harmful?
"We know that families are concerned about
high tuition costs, particularly at private colleges
and universities," said Associate Dean and Di
rector of Financial Aid Earl Dowling. "The
Independent 529 Plan offers a framework
for families to plan ahead so that attending
a private college or university can be finan
cially feasible."
But Strober said the plan could make it
even harder for them to afford tuition. Al
though the plan is aimed at lower-income
families as well as middle-class ones,
Strober said middle-class families are most
likely to participate.
"The families of lower-income students
probably cannot afford to save substantial
amounts for education at an expensive col
lege or university," Strober explained.
"The families of higher-income students
probably will continue to make their own
investments toward their children's higher
education or take the tuition cost out of cur
rent income at the time their children are
enrolled."
Middle-income families, on the other
hand, who can afford to put some financial
resources toward their children's education
but may not have the financial sophistica
tion to earn substantial returns on these in
vestments, are the ones who are most likely
to participate in a program that makes the
investments for them and guarantees a par
ticular level of tuition, she said.
"Unless colleges and universities take
action to provide more financial aid for stu
dents from low-income families, the exis
tence of 529 plans will increase the gap in
affordability of expensive college and uni

versity educations between low income
families and other families," Strober said.
"I hope that expensive colleges and univer
sities will use a large chunk of the expected
interest and appreciation accruing to these
funds to increase financial aid for students
from low-income families."
Mitigating the risk
Stanford began developing the program
in 1998, when it, along with approximately
300 other independent universities, be
came a charter member of the non-profit
Tuition Plan Consortium. The group's
idea was to create an alternative mecha
nism for paying for a private education
that would function under federal tax
guidelines, similar to plans offered by pub
lic institutions.
Although parents will decrease their in
vestment risk by avoiding unpredictable
markets, as has been common in the past,
the University is taking a chance by assum
ing that burden through its participation in
the plan.
Stanford will invest the money received
from a certificate's purchase until it is re
deemed and will ultimately keep the certifi
cate's worth plus the investment returns.
The Tuition Plan Consortium's publicity
materials argue that "because the Universi
ty can expect to redeem many certificates
over many years, the law of averages will
help mitigate its risk [of loss]."
A plan worth considering
Currently, the plan, whose participating

members also include Princeton and Co
lumbia, only covers tuition and other
mandatory costs, so expenses such as books,
room and board and meal plans will likely
not be covered. Also, graduate students will
not be able to reap any benefits from the
plan as it is only being offered to undergrad
uate students at this time.
Besides the financial risks facing the Uni
versity, the Board of Trustees is concerned
that families might be confused that their in
volvement in this plan will give applicants
an upper hand in the admissions process.
Isaac Stein, chair of the Board of Trustees,
claims that program administrators are
working hard to ensure that it is clear that
participation in the plan will have no bear
ing on admission decisions.
However, participation in the plan will
affect a student's eligibility and access to fi
nancial aid, although this may change in the
future should Congress decide to modify the
current financial aid rules, which factor in
these plans in evaluating a family's ability to
pay for university expenses.
The adoption of the plan is in its final
stages, awaiting a last legal review by the
University. Because there is a three-year
waiting period between the date of certifi
cate purchase and earliest redemption date,
Stanford will most likely not accept certifi
cates until 2007. But Dowling is confident
that when the time comes, this will be a great
initiative for many families.
"This plan is new. It is a relative unknown
who will participate," he said. "One thing is
clear: if a family is concerned about saving for
college and looking for a way to receive a tax
benefit, this plan would be worth consider
ing."

are concerned that because tuition is rising faster
than per capita income, they may have difficulty
paying for their children's tuition in the future."
Helpful or harmful?
"We know that families are concerned about
high tuition costs, particularly at private colleges
and universities," said Associate Dean and Di
rector of Financial Aid Earl Dowling. "The
Independent 529 Plan offers a framework
for families to plan ahead so that attending
a private college or university can be finan
cially feasible."
But Strober said the plan could make it
even harder for them to afford tuition. Al
though the plan is aimed at lower-income
families as well as middle-class ones,
Strober said middle-class families are most
likely to participate.
"The families of lower-income students
probably cannot afford to save substantial
amounts for education at an expensive col
lege or university," Strober explained.
"The families of higher-income students
probably will continue to make their own
investments toward their children's higher
education or take the tuition cost out of cur
rent income at the time their children are
enrolled."
Middle-income families, on the other
hand, who can afford to put some financial
resources toward their children's education
but may not have the financial sophistica
tion to earn substantial returns on these in
vestments, are the ones who are most likely
to participate in a program that makes the
investments for them and guarantees a par
ticular level of tuition, she said.
"Unless colleges and universities take
action to provide more financial aid for stu
dents from low-income families, the exis
tence of 529 plans will increase the gap in
affordability of expensive college and uni

versity educations between low income
families and other families," Strober said.
"I hope that expensive colleges and univer
sities will use a large chunk of the expected
interest and appreciation accruing to these
funds to increase financial aid for students
from low-income families."
Mitigating the risk
Stanford began developing the program
in 1998, when it, along with approximately
300 other independent universities, be
came a charter member of the non-profit
Tuition Plan Consortium. The group's
idea was to create an alternative mecha
nism for paying for a private education
that would function under federal tax
guidelines, similar to plans offered by pub
lic institutions.
Although parents will decrease their in
vestment risk by avoiding unpredictable
markets, as has been common in the past,
the University is taking a chance by assum
ing that burden through its participation in
the plan.
Stanford will invest the money received
from a certificate's purchase until it is re
deemed and will ultimately keep the certifi
cate's worth plus the investment returns.
The Tuition Plan Consortium's publicity
materials argue that "because the Universi
ty can expect to redeem many certificates
over many years, the law of averages will
help mitigate its risk [of loss]."
A plan worth considering
Currently, the plan, whose participating

members also include Princeton and Co
lumbia, only covers tuition and other
mandatory costs, so expenses such as books,
room and board and meal plans will likely
not be covered. Also, graduate students will
not be able to reap any benefits from the
plan as it is only being offered to undergrad
uate students at this time.
Besides the financial risks facing the Uni
versity, the Board of Trustees is concerned
that families might be confused that their in
volvement in this plan will give applicants
an upper hand in the admissions process.
Isaac Stein, chair of the Board of Trustees,
claims that program administrators are
working hard to ensure that it is clear that
participation in the plan will have no bear
ing on admission decisions.
However, participation in the plan will
affect a student's eligibility and access to fi
nancial aid, although this may change in the
future should Congress decide to modify the
current financial aid rules, which factor in
these plans in evaluating a family's ability to
pay for university expenses.
The adoption of the plan is in its final
stages, awaiting a last legal review by the
University. Because there is a three-year
waiting period between the date of certifi
cate purchase and earliest redemption date,
Stanford will most likely not accept certifi
cates until 2007. But Dowling is confident
that when the time comes, this will be a great
initiative for many families.
"This plan is new. It is a relative unknown
who will participate," he said. "One thing is
clear: if a family is concerned about saving for
college and looking for a way to receive a tax
benefit, this plan would be worth consider
ing."
The Board of Trustees has approved the im
plementation of a pre-paid tuition plan that could
significantly change the way future applicants fi
nance their college education at Stanford.
Tuition costs nationwide have nearly doubled
in the past 13 years, and the University is hoping
the plan, called the Independent 529 Plan, will
mitigate the burden of rising tuition by providing
an incentive for middle- and lower-income fami
lies to get a head start on saving money for their
children's education at any of 300 universities
participating in the plan.
Under the new program, families will be able
to purchase certificates to cover a certain per
centage of a year's tuition well before their chil
dren even apply to college. Payments on the plan
can be made over several years and anyone can
contribute money to an individual's plan once it
has been started. One of its most appealing qual
ities is that parents will get a 0.5 percent discount
on Stanford's annual tuition should they choose
to commit to the plan.
Aside from the discount, the plan is free of
federal taxes and will protect against tuition in
flation. If a family buys a certificate for a year's
tuition in 2004, for example, and then applies it in
2014 when their child enrolls, the certificate will
still pay for a year's tuition even though tuition
costs may have risen over the span of 10 years.
"The revolutionary aspect of this plan is that it
guarantees a particular level of tuition in the fu
ture," said Education Prof. Myra Strober. "This
feature is likely to be attractive to families who
are concerned that because tuition is rising faster
than per capita income, they may have difficulty
paying for their children's tuition in the future."
