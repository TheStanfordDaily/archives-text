The Board of Trustees has approved the im
plementation of a pre-paid tuition plan that could
significantly change the way future applicants fi
nance their college education at Stanford.
Tuition costs nationwide have nearly doubled
in the past 13 years, and the University is hoping
the plan, called the Independent 529 Plan, will
mitigate the burden of rising tuition by providing
an incentive for middle- and lower-income fami
lies to get a head start on saving money for their
children's education at any of 300 universities
participating in the plan.
Under the new program, families will be able
to purchase certificates to cover a certain per
centage of a year's tuition well before their chil
dren even apply to college. Payments on the plan
can be made over several years and anyone can
contribute money to an individual's plan once it
has been started. One of its most appealing qual
ities is that parents will get a 0.5 percent discount
on Stanford's annual tuition should they choose
to commit to the plan.
Aside from the discount, the plan is free of
federal taxes and will protect against tuition in
flation. If a family buys a certificate for a year's
tuition in 2004, for example, and then applies it in
2014 when their child enrolls, the certificate will
still pay for a year's tuition even though tuition
costs may have risen over the span of 10 years.
"The revolutionary aspect of this plan is that it
guarantees a particular level of tuition in the fu
ture," said Education Prof. Myra Strober. "This
feature is likely to be attractive to families who
are concerned that because tuition is rising faster
than per capita income, they may have difficulty
paying for their children's tuition in the future."
Helpful or harmful?
"We know that families are concerned about
high tuition costs, particularly at private colleges
and universities," said Associate Dean and Di
