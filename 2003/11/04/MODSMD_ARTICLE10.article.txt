# Extraordinary scientific (possibility?

### KERRY GRENS 
If we trusted the statistical results of ESP experiments as much as we do the results
of medical experiments on, say, the benefits of aspirin, we would all be believers in
psychic phenomena. However, despite statistically significant data revealing the exis
tence of psi-the anomalous events of information transfer unexplained by current sci
ence-50% of Americans remain unconvinced. Why is half of the nation reluctant to
let numbers extinguish their skepticism?
On Sunday Dr. Lee Ross of Stanford's Psychology Department and Dr. Paul
Switzer of Stanford's Statistics Department discussed the reasons for belief and skep
ticism in extrasensory perception, or ESP, as part of Wonderfest, a two-day science
symposium. Annually, Wonderfest hosts dialogues between professors at bay area
universities to examine controversial scientific topics. This year's debates were held
at Berkeley and Stanford on Saturday and Sunday.
Ross began the discussion with an introduction to psi and explained the categories
of psychic phenomena: ESP, which includes telepathy, clairvoyance, and precogni
tion, and psychokinesis, which is the mental control over physical events or objects.
Much research has focused on telepathy-thought transfer-and here lies the most con
vincing data.
Seminal telepathy experiments were conducted by Dr. J. B. Rhine at Duke Uni
versity in the first half of the last century in which subjects were asked to guess the
identity of a randomly selected card. Rhine's experiments supported the workings of
something other than chance — presumably ESP — but critics touted misgivings by
exposing potential design flaws, opportunities for fraud, and failure to replicate the
experiments in different labs.
Earlier in the century, Leland Stanford's brother Thomas Welton Stanford fund
ed psychic research at Stanford University, the results of which John Edgar Coover
published in 1917. Coover concluded that psychic phenomena did not exist.
However, recent analyses by Dr. Edwin May at the Cognitive Sciences Laborato
ry in Palo Alto and Dr. Jessica Utts at UC-Davis present a strong case for psi. May
and Utts conducted a review of STARGATE, a two-decade study of ESP funded by
the Department of Defense, and concluded that the results indicate performances far
beyond those expected by chance. Utts and May assert that ESP is responsible for the
anomalous cognition demonstrated in the study.
Most of the experiments, which were conducted first at Stanford Research Insti
tute in Menlo Park and later at the Science Applications International Corporation
from 1973 through 1994, tested remote viewing. In such a test, a subject is asked to de
scribe a stimulus that is presented in another location beyond the range of perception
through the five senses. Variations on remote viewing include the presence of a
sender, who views and concentrates on the stimulus, and descriptions of the stimulus
by either free association or by choosing the correct stimulus of several options. Par
ticipants were able to identify the stimulus more often than would be predicted by
chance.
Although they oppose Utts and May's conclusion that psi is responsible for the
data, the CIA and University of Oregon professor Dr. Ray Hyman agree that the
statistics are valid. In fact, Hyman wrote that he concurs with Utts that the data can
not be regarded as statistical accidents and that the experiments at the Science Ap
plications International Corporation were methodologically sound.
However, Hyman and the CIA do not see this as proof of ESP. Additionally,
Hyman points out that several non-methodological flaws remain: experiments were
not replicated in other laboratories, the same judge evaluated the correctness of sub
jects' answers, and ESP has not been shown to be the actual cause of observed phe
nomena.
A meta-analysis of a different psi experiment, the Ganzfeld procedure, by Dr.
Daryl J. Bern at Cornell University-an initial skeptic-and the late Charles Honorton
also supports the existence of ESP. In the Ganzfeld procedure, a sender is presented
with a stimulus and the receiver, who is given a homogenous perceptual environment
through diffuse red light and white noise, free associates for thirty minutes then ranks
several given stimuli for their similarity to the sender's stimulus. Subjects' perfor
mances again greatly exceed the expectation, and Bern and Honorton attribute this to
telepathy.
Why is it — when even skeptics like Hyman believe that the data describe a true
effect-that 50 percent of Americans don't believe in ESP? Ross listed several mis
conceptions skeptics are loathe to part with: That psi research is poorly conducted,
that the stats are not as rigorous as in other scientific studies, and that data are more
likely to be fraudulent. Both Ross and Switzer agreed none of these is the case.
However, certain qualities of psi research warrant skepticism; for example, most
psi researchers are believers in the phenomena, and may provide conducive environ
ments for positive results. Another criticism of psi studies — and most likely related
to the above — is that negative results may not be reported. Ross quipped, "What
journal would publish negative results of a phenomenon nobody believes?" Lastly,
there is no mechanistic theory of psi that leads to testable predictions regarding its
purpose and function.
But progress toward developing theories for how and why ESP may have evolved
proceeds nonetheless. Dr. Brian Josephson, Nobel laureate and University of Cam
bridge professor, has brought quantum theory into the debate as a means of explain
ing telepathy.
Switzer compared psi evidence to that of continental drift: before the theory of
plate tectonics, drift was a ridiculous interpretation of the data. Perhaps psi is simply
waiting for science to catch up.

ed psychic research at Stanford University, the results of which John Edgar Coover
published in 1917. Coover concluded that psychic phenomena did not exist.
However, recent analyses by Dr. Edwin May at the Cognitive Sciences Laborato
ry in Palo Alto and Dr. Jessica Utts at UC-Davis present a strong case for psi. May
and Utts conducted a review of STARGATE, a two-decade study of ESP funded by
the Department of Defense, and concluded that the results indicate performances far
beyond those expected by chance. Utts and May assert that ESP is responsible for the
anomalous cognition demonstrated in the study.
Most of the experiments, which were conducted first at Stanford Research Insti
tute in Menlo Park and later at the Science Applications International Corporation
from 1973 through 1994, tested remote viewing. In such a test, a subject is asked to de
scribe a stimulus that is presented in another location beyond the range of perception
through the five senses. Variations on remote viewing include the presence of a
sender, who views and concentrates on the stimulus, and descriptions of the stimulus
by either free association or by choosing the correct stimulus of several options. Par
ticipants were able to identify the stimulus more often than would be predicted by
chance.
Although they oppose Utts and May's conclusion that psi is responsible for the
data, the CIA and University of Oregon professor Dr. Ray Hyman agree that the
statistics are valid. In fact, Hyman wrote that he concurs with Utts that the data can
not be regarded as statistical accidents and that the experiments at the Science Ap
plications International Corporation were methodologically sound.
However, Hyman and the CIA do not see this as proof of ESP. Additionally,
Hyman points out that several non-methodological flaws remain: experiments were
not replicated in other laboratories, the same judge evaluated the correctness of sub
jects' answers, and ESP has not been shown to be the actual cause of observed phe
nomena.
A meta-analysis of a different psi experiment, the Ganzfeld procedure, by Dr.
Daryl J. Bern at Cornell University-an initial skeptic-and the late Charles Honorton
also supports the existence of ESP. In the Ganzfeld procedure, a sender is presented
with a stimulus and the receiver, who is given a homogenous perceptual environment
through diffuse red light and white noise, free associates for thirty minutes then ranks
several given stimuli for their similarity to the sender's stimulus. Subjects' perfor
mances again greatly exceed the expectation, and Bern and Honorton attribute this to
telepathy.
Why is it — when even skeptics like Hyman believe that the data describe a true
effect-that 50 percent of Americans don't believe in ESP? Ross listed several mis
conceptions skeptics are loathe to part with: That psi research is poorly conducted,
that the stats are not as rigorous as in other scientific studies, and that data are more
likely to be fraudulent. Both Ross and Switzer agreed none of these is the case.
However, certain qualities of psi research warrant skepticism; for example, most
psi researchers are believers in the phenomena, and may provide conducive environ
ments for positive results. Another criticism of psi studies — and most likely related
to the above — is that negative results may not be reported. Ross quipped, "What
journal would publish negative results of a phenomenon nobody believes?" Lastly,
there is no mechanistic theory of psi that leads to testable predictions regarding its
purpose and function.
But progress toward developing theories for how and why ESP may have evolved
proceeds nonetheless. Dr. Brian Josephson, Nobel laureate and University of Cam
bridge professor, has brought quantum theory into the debate as a means of explain
ing telepathy.
Switzer compared psi evidence to that of continental drift: before the theory of
plate tectonics, drift was a ridiculous interpretation of the data. Perhaps psi is simply
waiting for science to catch up.
