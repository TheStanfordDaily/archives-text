A Probabilistic Model for Dating at Stanford
Date (noun): an appointment to meet at a specified time;
especially: a social engagement between two persons that
often has a romantic character
Date (verb): to make or have a date with
Dating is a wonderful part of college and life in general
(okay, I take that back, let's just say eighty-nine-point-six
seven percent of the time). A technical attempt to analyze
this romantic activity or to make it happen has long been
deemed futile because it involves perhaps the most perplex
ing and elusive element of human emotions: love. Even our
most respected physicist, Albert Einstein, surrendered his
effort to explain the mechanism of love by claiming, "Grav
itation cannot be held responsible for people falling in
love." Alas, as I am a lovelorn techie, however, I see no bet
ter way to approach dating than to develop a somewhat re
fined mathematical model to simulate dating psychology
and behaviors. It is my hope that this week's column will lay
the groundwork for a profound dating theory. This theory
will eventually answer advanced questions like, "What is
the chance that I will find Mr. or Ms. Right at Stanford?"

Axiom One: Dating is nothing more than the assignment of
probabilities of marriage to potential spouses. Believe it or not,
every bachelor consciously or subconsciously assigns every
body else in the world a probability to marry that individual.
For instance, if you meet someone that you are highly attract
ed to and there is no one else in your life yet, you might assign
that person an eighty-one-point-two percent probability. For
people that you don't know, you might assign them a zero per
cent probability. When two people are dating, they might be
assigning each other probabilities around ninety-three-point
zero-seven percent. At the end of the day, however, the total
probabilities that you have assigned everybody must total one
hundred percent (In the case of monogamy, that is. The total
probability could actually exceed one-hundred percent if we
are talking about polygamy). As the avid reader might realize,
this potential-marriage probability distribution ought to be
highly unbalanced. For most people in the world, the probabil
ity that you assign to marry them should be around zero; for a
select few the probability enters the double-digit region.
With this axiom established, we can model the dating
psychology more precisely. To illustrate a few examples:
When some guy points to someone else and says, "she's
gorgeous," he actually means, "I am gonna assign her a high
probability of marriage."

When somebody is stigmatized as "a player" that fre
quently hooks up with numerous people and refuses to set
tle, that means he or she has a more even probability distri
bution than most people, since multiple individuals are as
signed more or less equal weights in his or her mind.
Axiom Two: the assignment of potential-marriage prob
abilities fluctuates with respect to time. As life goes on at
Stanford and as you meet more people, experience more ac
tivities, and adopt more ideas, your perception of other peo
ple alter as well. For example, if your date picks his or her
nose during dinner, you might drop his or her probability by
a fraction of a percentage. If you suddenly discover some in
credible compatibility between you and your best friend of
opposite sex, you might boost the probability for him or her.
With this probabilistic model in place, we are better
equipped to tackle questions like "what is a Stanford gradu
ate's chance of marrying another Stanford graduate?" To gain
more solid ground in such rationalizations, we will have to wait
another two weeks until the "I got game [theory]" column re
turns. By then, Axiom Three, which explains how potential
marriage probabilities are actually assigned, will be unveiled.
