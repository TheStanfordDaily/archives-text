— Eugene Patterson, former president of the
St. Petersburg Times

What is appropriate for this newspaper to run
as an advertisement? What's not? Questions
such as these have become the source of heated
debate after Oct. 21, when The Stanford Daily
began publishing advertisements from the One
Truth Foundation, a national advocacy organi
zation, and its Web site Campustruth.org. Since
then, the paper has received a flood of letters —
from both those who support the ad series and
those who vehemently oppose it.
Our paper's ad policy states we don't pub
lish ads that "incite violence, [or are] obscene
or libelous." Furthermore, we don't run ads
that "cast aspersions" based on ethnicity, reli
gion or sexual orientation. Racial implications

can obviously be found in any political ad
about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it is
our duty as a newspaper to base our judgment
on facts alone — and what is explicitly pre
sented in an advertisement.
I may not agree with viewpoints expressed
by Campustruth.org. But no single word,
phrase or image in the ads demonstrates prej
udice. The ads do not make any derogatory
blanket statements about the Israeli and
Palestinian populations.
Controversial ads are not uncommon in the
world of journalism. The decision to print or
reject an ad is made independent of financial
considerations. We will continue to run the
Campustruth.org ads for their full scheduled
duration of five weeks, which will end on Nov.
21. We will also continue to run letters —
from those who oppose the ads, those who
support the ads and those who fall anywhere
in between. We hope that this exchange of
ideas will foster greater understanding among
those in the University community.
