# OP-ED
## Offensive ads shouldn't be published 
### 
We are issuing this state
ment in response to the
advertisements that you
have published in your
newspaper for the organization One
Truth Foundation ana their Web site
Campustruth.org. We find these ads
to be distastefiu and offensive and
simply out of keeping with the spirit of
the fundamental standards to which
we all adhere as members of the Stan
ford community.
These ads were an attack on the
personal honor of a specific group of
people with no agenda other than to
smear their image and dehumanize
them. They promote the idea that it is
acceptable to make blanket state
ments regarding an entire people and

display an alarming degree of intoler
ance toward them.
This is especially harmful these
days, when a lack of journalistic in
tegrity can so easily lead to disastrous
misunderstandings. One Truth Foun
dation's advertisements violate the
University's policies about intoler
ance, University President John Hen
nessy's post-9/11 address condemn
ing all acts of intolerance directed to
ward members of the Arab and Mus
lim communities and The Daily's own
advertising policy.
We are not against free speech or
the freedom of press. In fact, we cele
brate the rights of people to hold con
troversial opinions and to express
those opinions openly. However, we

feel that these advertisements went far
beyond controversy, into the realm of
unacceptable ignorance, intolerance
and hatred.
We call on The Daily to discontin
ue this series of advertisements and re
frain from publishing any other adver
tisements that blindly attack any
group of people united in religious,
ethnic, sexual or national identifica
tion. We call on The Daily to acknowl
edge our grievances; and we suggest
the publication of an article to that ef
fect, commensurate in visibility and
magnitude to the advertisements
themselves.
