# OPINIONS
## BLOWING INTO TOWN Suffering from airport insecurity 
### 
None of us like it: the long lines,
the new rules... the greater
likelihood for an invasive and
embarrassing search. But all
of us endure it because we remember
9/11 — and we don't want it to happen
again. But is this new system just an ex
pensive waste of time inconveniencing
the innocent?
I speak of the federal Transportation
Security Administration (TSA), com
missioned with a $4.5 billion budget to
protect American air travelers. I clocked
some significant time this past weekend
in a TSA line and was selected twice for
the random searches that included a pub
lic rifling through my suitcase, an undo
ing of my pants for a closer look at my
waistband and a complimentary feel-up
of the under-wire on my bra.
I've surrendered dull manicure scis
sors, knitting needles, disposable razors
and — I'll admit this one is valid — a
hammer to the TSA guys before. And
every time, I've been forced to give up
something that could only be a weapon
in the hands of someone 100 pound heav
ier than me. I might swear a little, but I ac
cept it in the hope that all this careful
scrutiny is uncovering something more
dangerous than a warehouse full of fin
gernail clippers.
Nathaniel Heatwole, a 20-year-old
Maryland college student who is skepti
cal of airport security, issued a direct
challenge to the effectiveness of TSA's
security precautions. He somehow snuck
two pairs of box cutters, matches, bleach
and clay shaped like explosives onto two
Southwest airplanes on Sept. 15, hiding

them in the planes'
lavatories.
Heatwole then
wrote an e-mail to
the TSA, detailing
exactly what he'd
done and on what
planes, signing the
e-mail with his
phone number. His
e-mail was ignored
until a cleaning crew
found one of the

bags a month later. TSA immediately
ordered a search of all the nation's 7,000
airplanes, and that's when bag number
two was uncovered.
The government doesn't seem to find
Heatwole's free evaluation of TSA's per
formance helpful. TSA isn't saying who
first read Heatwole's e-mail and exactly
why no one followed up on it, but it's clear
this unassuming-looking student is in a lot
of trouble. He's been charged with sever
al federal offenses that carry heavy penal
ties written into the Patriot Act.
So direct democracy doesn't work
when it comes to the jittery and embat
tled government security forces. But
what does TSA have to say for itself?
Deputy TSA Administrator Stephen
McHale said, "Amateur testing of our
systems do not show us in any way our
flaws. We know where the vulnerabili
ties are and we are testing them. This
doesn't help."
"This is a bad experience," said
Homeland Security Secretary Tom
Ridge, who oversees TSA. He said offi
cials had decided Heatwole's e-mail

"wasn't an imminent threat," but they
now will "look at our protocol" for han
dling such e-mails.
Feel better? More secure? Me nei
ther. This well-heeled agency, created a
month after the 9/11 attacks, was sup
posed to put higher-paid and better
trained screeners at the airports as a
frontline protection against airplane hi
jackings. Turns out, according to critics
on the Hill, that the TS A is using outdat
ed machinery and most of the staff lacks
sufficient training.
So where is the $4.5 billion being
spent? On new uniforms? On star-and
eagle TSA emblems plastered all over
airports and its new Washington, D.C.
offices? Or more likely, on storage facili
ties to hold confiscated "contraband?"
Congressional reviews are looking
into that, but for now I'll try and resolve
my bitterness for almost missing my
flight because of a random check and
some very slow-moving TSA employees.
The agency has had two years to cre
ate a plan or train their people, but there
are big kinks in the system. Unfortunate
ly, aside from the government improving
their operation — which may seem like
the simple solution, but somehow never
is — I can't think of an alternative to the
tedious lines and invasion of privacy. If
the TSA people pick out one pair of box
cutters among ten thousand pairs of nail
clippers, it's probably a trade-off we can
all live with.

ate a plan or train their people, but there
are big kinks in the system. Unfortunate
ly, aside from the government improving
their operation — which may seem like
the simple solution, but somehow never
is — I can't think of an alternative to the
tedious lines and invasion of privacy. If
the TSA people pick out one pair of box
cutters among ten thousand pairs of nail
clippers, it's probably a trade-off we can
all live with.
