# RECCHIA'S REMARKS
## Pursuing personal liberty as a frosh 
### 
Ah, Election Day 2003: the per
fect excuse for opinions colum
nists everywhere to speak their
minds on the most important
political issues of the day. As an official
member of the "pervasive liberal hege
mony," part of me feels a vague obligation
to say something about gun control or the
state of education under President
George W. Bush. However, the part of
me that woke up at 6:30 a.m. this morning
to a faulty fire alarm is too tired to even
think about writing a column requiring
any sort of research, let alone contend
with the hate mail that inevitably haunts
the author of anything politically charged.
Therefore, I'll split the difference and
focus on a different sort of non-elected
leaders: our parents. Remember them?
For years, they were the ultimate author
ities on curfews, friends, chores and com
puter time; any act against the sovereign
will was treated as the greatest perfidy.
While we vaguely acknowledged the
benefits of such pleasantries as free food
and clean laundry, parental rule often
seemed more of a burden than a boon.
Like the colonists of old, we felt
cramped, restrained and ready for inde
pendence. Knowing that they had our
best interests at heart seemed little rec
ompense for endless advice or the occa
sional denial of driving privileges.
Enter freshman year at Stanford. With
a few awkward or tearful goodbyes, a
seemingly oligarchic family structure was
transformed into a constitutional monar
chy; the parents — still rulers in name —
became powerless to influence the day-to
day decisions of their former subjects. Re
moved from his parents both physically
and mentally, the autonomy of the student

is now nearly com
plete. Rather than
having a stake in our
daily lives, our par
ents rely upon us for
knowledge of our ac
tivities — a fact I re
cently saw illustrated
by a dorm photo of
three soon-to-be ine
briated freshmen.
(The photo's cap
tion: "Dear Mom,

College is going fine.") Once the shock of
exposure to a new environment was over,
a profound new feeling set in: I was free.
Despite this newfound liberty, I soon
found myself spontaneously following
many of my parents' lifestyle suggestions.
After half of my dorm residents caught
colds from trying to live on four hours of
sleep, I instinctively reverted to an eight
hour regimen. Making the bed every
once in awhile does, in fact, make it smell
better. And despite its intuitive tenability,
I achieved little success in smoothing out
my clothing with heavy books, so I now
just fold it as it comes out of the dryer like
Mom said.
Admittedly or not, most of us follow a
lifestyle of at least moderate self-re
straint. Why do we respect the wishes of
an unseen power? Either we have al
ready "become" our parents (perish the
thought!) or, maybe, they had a little
good advice after all. Rather than the au
tocracy we had imagined, most of our
parents' "rules" were merely suggestions
to keep us healthy, wealthy and wise.
Granted, it can be tough to let go. Just
as England doubted the colonists' capac
ity for autonomy, it's difficult for many

parents to believe that we actually can
live on our own — hence franticly obvi
ous words of parting advice like "wear
your jacket when it's cold" and "remem
ber, your RA is your residential advisor."
But as mature adults, it's time we did
away with our grievances and cut the folks
a little slack. Rather than "imposing taxes
on us without our consent," they send
money or the occasional bag of candy.
They do not call us together "at places un
usual, uncomfortable, and distant... for
the sole purpose of fatiguing [us] into
compliance with [their] measures" —
IHUM lectures take care of that. There
are few "attempts... to extend an unwar
rantable jurisdiction over us," save per
haps the occasional e-mail reminding us
of the importance of eating bananas.
No, they're simply wondering what
we're doing, watching our football
games and hoping we're feeling okay.
They're figuring out our University bills,
hoping we're making friends and secret
ly reflecting that the house seems a little
emptier without us. The predictable
moral of the story: Whether they're
across the country or ten minutes away,
they've helped get us this far, and it
couldn't hurt to call or dash off an e-mail
to say hi. If you really want to knock their
argyles off, send something handwritten,
and sign it with love. It never hurts to be
on good terms with your parents. Better
now than when you have to ask for help
paying those pesky bills.
