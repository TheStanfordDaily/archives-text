Commentary on
campustruth.org's ads

The Daily should be congratulated
— not criticized — for continuing to run
ads from campustruth.org. While the
right or wrong of campustruth.org's
opinions could take up a much longer
and complex letter, the true issue at hand
here concerns the importance of a free
press. By holding the line, The Daily has
made it clear that they will not merely
run ads or print opinions that represent a
popular view, but opinions that repre
sent all views.
If campustruth.org's ads were li
belous, this would be another story. But
this organization does not blindly make
these statements and, as a visit to their
Web site will prove, their views are con
tinuously backed up with a number of
facts and news stories. If The Daily were
to allow a few angry letters to deter them
from moderating a free and all-inclusive
forum, it would greatly impugn the jour
nalistic integrity of Stanford's student
newspaper. In America, the free press is
not about being able to say whatever you
want; the free press is about defending
things you would never want to say.

Having prompted uproar by print
ing the first ad from campustruth.org on
Oct. 24, The Daily still printed a second
ad from campustruth.org on Oct. 31 —
this time with a disclaimer stating that
the ad does not represent the views of
The Daily. This has sparked a contro
versy, as is obvious by reading the Let
ters to the Editor section in The Daily
that appears every day.
I find it extremely disturbing that a
high profile college newspaper like The

Daily would resort to printing such ads to
raise money. Yes, we know that we are in
tough economic times and that the facul
ty and staff have had a salary freeze. But
that is no excuse to print half-page, emo
tion-provoking ads on the back page of
any newspaper.
I find it even more disturbing that
The Daily printed a second ad, despite all
the letters to the editor it received — and
printed — slamming its decision to print
the first one. Do the editors not read the
letters they get? Or do they simply
choose to ignore them?
What is surprising is that the Edi
torial B oard of The D aily wrote a very
positive piece ("Islam grant boosts
awareness," Oct. 1) on how Islam
shouldn't be viewed as a "clash of civ
ilizations," but instead understood
and explored. The piece seemed to
encourage an understanding of Islam,
but printing the two ads from campus
truth.org have greatly overshadowed
the relevance of the editorial.
While the world is trying to promote
peace and harmony in the Middle East,
campustruth.org and The Daily are pro
moting hate and animosity. Sure, there
might be "two sides to every story," but
differences cannot be overcome by pro
voking anger and hostility.
I also find it appalling that The Daily
has silently printed the letters that it re
ceived. With the volume of letters that
have been printed, this issue deserves an
answer. Would the Editorial Board
please respond?

Stanford Dining falls short

Most people have heard the saying,

"If you try to please everyone, you'll end
up pleasing no one." Nonetheless, Resi
dential Education and Stanford Dining
are trying to please everyone — includ
ing vegetarians, vegans, people who
want food at 2 a.m., people who eat only
10 meals a week, people who need halal
food and people with nut allergies.
For $4,000 or more a year, are we all
pleased? From conversations with stu
dents in Wilbur and Lagunita, I've gath
ered that very few students are satisfied.
Besides the dissatisfaction with the cost
(about $17,000 in the course of a Stanford
education), there is discontent with the
fact that people who aren't well-served
by meal plans are nonetheless forced to
buy them. No matter if you don't want to
support the meat industry with your all
you-care-to-eat plan; or that you prefer to
eat several small meals throughout the
day; or that you'd prefer to buy your own
food at the grocery store — Stanford has
spoken, and if you live in University
housing, you must buy a meal plan.
This rule seems to be based less on
ideology than on economics — Stanford
Dining simply cannot stay afloat unless
every student in University housing buys
a meal plan (or pays a "general and ad
ministrative overhead fee," if lucky
enough to merit an exemption).
So, what should Stanford Dining do?
Continue trying to please everyone and
pass the costs of special accommodations
on to students? Why can't Dining Services
do what any other responsible company
would do — define the group it serves and
give them a good deal, letting those who
aren't served by that deal get their food
elsewhere? Mandatory meal plans will die
sooner or later — whether sooner or later
is up to Stanford students.

Having prompted uproar by print
ing the first ad from campustruth.org on
Oct. 24, The Daily still printed a second
ad from campustruth.org on Oct. 31 —
this time with a disclaimer stating that
the ad does not represent the views of
The Daily. This has sparked a contro
versy, as is obvious by reading the Let
ters to the Editor section in The Daily
that appears every day.
I find it extremely disturbing that a
high profile college newspaper like The

Daily would resort to printing such ads to
raise money. Yes, we know that we are in
tough economic times and that the facul
ty and staff have had a salary freeze. But
that is no excuse to print half-page, emo
tion-provoking ads on the back page of
any newspaper.
I find it even more disturbing that
The Daily printed a second ad, despite all
the letters to the editor it received — and
printed — slamming its decision to print
the first one. Do the editors not read the
letters they get? Or do they simply
choose to ignore them?
What is surprising is that the Edi
torial B oard of The D aily wrote a very
positive piece ("Islam grant boosts
awareness," Oct. 1) on how Islam
shouldn't be viewed as a "clash of civ
ilizations," but instead understood
and explored. The piece seemed to
encourage an understanding of Islam,
but printing the two ads from campus
truth.org have greatly overshadowed
the relevance of the editorial.
While the world is trying to promote
peace and harmony in the Middle East,
campustruth.org and The Daily are pro
moting hate and animosity. Sure, there
might be "two sides to every story," but
differences cannot be overcome by pro
voking anger and hostility.
I also find it appalling that The Daily
has silently printed the letters that it re
ceived. With the volume of letters that
have been printed, this issue deserves an
answer. Would the Editorial Board
please respond?

Stanford Dining falls short

Most people have heard the saying,

"If you try to please everyone, you'll end
up pleasing no one." Nonetheless, Resi
dential Education and Stanford Dining
are trying to please everyone — includ
ing vegetarians, vegans, people who
want food at 2 a.m., people who eat only
10 meals a week, people who need halal
food and people with nut allergies.
For $4,000 or more a year, are we all
pleased? From conversations with stu
dents in Wilbur and Lagunita, I've gath
ered that very few students are satisfied.
Besides the dissatisfaction with the cost
(about $17,000 in the course of a Stanford
education), there is discontent with the
fact that people who aren't well-served
by meal plans are nonetheless forced to
buy them. No matter if you don't want to
support the meat industry with your all
you-care-to-eat plan; or that you prefer to
eat several small meals throughout the
day; or that you'd prefer to buy your own
food at the grocery store — Stanford has
spoken, and if you live in University
housing, you must buy a meal plan.
This rule seems to be based less on
ideology than on economics — Stanford
Dining simply cannot stay afloat unless
every student in University housing buys
a meal plan (or pays a "general and ad
ministrative overhead fee," if lucky
enough to merit an exemption).
So, what should Stanford Dining do?
Continue trying to please everyone and
pass the costs of special accommodations
on to students? Why can't Dining Services
do what any other responsible company
would do — define the group it serves and
give them a good deal, letting those who
aren't served by that deal get their food
elsewhere? Mandatory meal plans will die
sooner or later — whether sooner or later
is up to Stanford students.
