## Sanskriti clarifies Saturday night show 
### KOSHA SHAH 
On behalf of Sanskriti's Special
Events Committee, Sanskriti Core and
the emcees for our annual Diwali show,
I would like to extend an apology to the
500-plus audience members for the re
marks made during Saturday night's
show, Diwali Dhamaka. Please under
stand that it was definitely not our in
tention to offend or alienate a single
one of our audience members. The pur
pose of events such as Diwali Dhamaka
is to bring the Stanford community to
gether in celebration of the diverse tra
ditions and people of South Asia.
One of our primary missions as the
undergraduate South Asian organiza
tion is to foster an awareness and un
derstanding of South Asian culture in
the general Stanford community. We
create cultural dialogues through
weekly meetings on issues affecting the
entire South Asian Diaspora, commu
nity service events (such as Gandhi
Day), social events and cultural shows
that include Diwali Dhamaka. We be
lieve our organization to be accepting
of all cultures, all types of people and
most importantly, all types of South
Asians regardless of how they identify
with their culture. It is not our inten

tion to judge people, let alone single
out other cultures in a harsh or divisive
way. Please understand that the pur
pose of our club is to create a safe space
for South Asian Americans and those
interested in South Asian culture to
openly discuss and appreciate all as
pects of their cultural identities and to
help celebrate the uniqueness of being
a South Asian American.
Despite all this, I can understand
how some of the comments, as well as
the overall theme of the emcee skit,
could have been interpreted as expect
ing all South Asian Americans to act
and think a certain way. We realize the
inappropriateness of certain comments
made in Diwali Dhamaka, but we sin
cerely ask that those not be taken as the
dominant message of the show. The
theme was meant to be funny and play
ful, and more importantly, to serve as a
way of introducing each act. Our pur
pose was not to give the impression of
cultural divisiveness.
While I did not personally write the
script, the intent of the skit was simply to
"educate" a young South Asian about
the diversity of his culture, and in doing
so, educate the audience. However,
with the use of inappropriate cultural
references and references to having to

choose between one culture and the
other, the lighthearted playfulness of
the theme was lost. Instead, it was dom
inated by a few inappropriate com
ments that were not planned before
hand, but were improvised during the
show without consideration to the
deeper meaning and implication behind
the words. For that, Sanskriti, the em
cees and I wholeheartedly apologize.
As a club that represents more than
400 people, it was unacceptable for us
to have made such comments, and we
appreciate Senior Gautam Raghavan's
honesty in his letter ("Racial remarks
at show inappropriate," Nov. 3). We
are taking steps to ensure that this does
not occur agam at any of Sanskriti's fu
ture events. I am saddened by the fact
that Raghavan — and potentially oth
ers — were offended by our show, es
pecially when the sole purpose of our
organization is to solicit the exact op
posite sentiment from our audience
and members. I hope the Stanford
community will accept our sincerest
apologies and continue to support our
organization in all that we do.
