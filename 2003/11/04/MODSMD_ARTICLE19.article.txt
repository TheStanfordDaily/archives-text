# OP-ED
## Debate on ad needs to be reconsidered 
### SAMIRA KHAN 
I have been following the ad debate
with ambivalent discomfiture. One side
of the debate seems to simplify the
issue to one of blocking the voice of
"hate," and the other simplifies the
issue to one of representing the "truth."
Would a similar image be allowed to
appear in The Daily? Are these standards
codified or at the discretion of the editors?
Can The Daily share the standards?
Based on that, the same standards
should apply to this ad, as the motivation
behind it is unknown. Is the motivation
bigotry or is it a product of a misinformed
self-proclaimed messenger of truth?
Firstly, the greater question is not one
of this particular ad, but the integral con
nection between media and money in the
US that puts a slant on the images our
public is exposed to. The Daily should
consider having a section for ads that
does not cost anything in order to counter
such green-backed truths.
Secondly, a recent letter brought up
the necessity for those that condemn the
ad to see the larger view of the Middle
East — I read claims that this truth rep
resents an attitude of terror in the Middle
East. But these critics fail to realize the
narrowness of their argument, as they call

it an "attitude of terror." This language is
itself hypocritical and grossly one-sided.
To us, it is an attitude of terror, for the
ravaged groups in the Middle East, it may
be their last-resort-defense against terror
or selective American foreign policy.
They fear us. Instead of looking at this as
terror, has anyone examined the possibil
ity of this negative sentiment being a re
sulting reality of our past wrongs, rather
than banishing it to an issue of autocracy
or democratic order in the region?
Another critic drew a parallel be
tween the negativity of the Arab press
(which runs under a completely different
system than Stanford) and the possibility
of negativity in the Islamic Studies Pro
gram at Stanford. This claims makes the
leap from Arab to Islamic to negative.
Let's say we accept this egregious leap.
In our shrine of freedom of expression
and truth, the powerful may be the one
with the greens for the ad or the one with
power in designing the program. So, if the
program has negative courses that are
"true," and the power structure of the
program (as with that of the media) falls
in their favor, should they be blocked?
If there was a class at Stanford that
highlighted only the atrocities of Jews
against Muslims in the West Bank, would
the fact that "it happens" be enough?

Would having an alternative course
about the reverse make the existence of
the course acceptable? These are the
questions we must ask ourselves.
The placement of the ad in The Daily
represents not only one crafted image of
the aftermath of Sept. 11 or a truth, but
also the truth in consistent bias and hate
building. It accentuates a media slant that
has and will build ignorance, as it manip
ulates human emotion under the shroud
of freedom of expression. Or, shall I say
freedom of capitalism without an alter
nate forum in The Daily?
Despite the debate on the ad itself, at
least certain parties on each side have ex
pressed the importance of their claim in fu
ture conflict resolution. How can you re
solve conflict between two groups by sup
pressing freedom of expression, or how can
you resolve conflict by perpetuating hate?
In the letters, I read words such as
truth and guilt. These critics fail to ques
tion the manifestation of truth as apart
from its existence and how painting the
picture of truth in the media and the world
is closely linked to power — whether it be
power of voice, money or world order.
