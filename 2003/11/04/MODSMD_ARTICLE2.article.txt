# Band undergoes disciplinary measures because of USC trip
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band has been
placed under disciplinary measures
after a trip to USC for Stanford's
Oct. 11 football game left the Band's
travel bus in improper condition, ac
cording to University officials.
Bus equipment was broken and
vomit was left in the bathroom sink.
The buses' custodial crew first iden
tified the vomit as feces due to trans
lation errors but have since amended
their description.
When band members loaded the
buses after the football game ended,
at around 11 p.m., the bus drivers
told the band management that the
holding containers for the bath
rooms were very full, especially on
one bus.
"We then spent about an hour in
downtown Los Angeles trying to
find a facility where buses dispose
this stuff, but everything was
closed," said senior Moses Pounds,
the Band public relations director.
"The bus drivers and band manage
ment decided that it would be best
just to head for home, figuring that
everyone would be asleep and not
using the bathroom. Sometime dur
ing the night, apparently, someone
on the one bus with the very full toi
let got sick to their stomach and . ..
vomited in the sink."
As soon as the band management
learned of the incidents from the bus
company, they implemented the fol
lowing measures: Band members
going on bus trips will now have to
sign a document with the Band's
travel policy and Fundamental Stan
dard; The Band will not drink alco
hol on buses; Band staff members
will be spread out in a ratio of one
staff member for every 10 Band
members, to ensure that there's al
ways someone around to clean
things up and manage similar issues.
After a meeting with the Athletic
Department on Oct. 24, the Univer
sity added that all Band travel must

be cleared through the Athletic De
partment and that a Department
staff member will have to accompa
ny the Band on buses indefinitely.
Some other problems with the

state of the bus included two armrests
that were broken when Band mem
bers stepped on them while retrieving

items in the overhead storage bins.
The bus was also "generally messy"
with spills and things left behind.
"The issue here is not the specific
things which were broken," Pounds
said. "As is established in the Band's
travel policy, damages are paid by

the person who broke something.
The issue for the future is instead en
suring that the Band takes care of
buses, and cleans up."
The temporary restrictions will
only affect the Band's trip to San
Francisco for a Battle of the Bands
rally with the Stanford alumni. But
Moses was not too worried about
the new disciplinary measures.
"They are not that much of a big
deal for us," Pounds said. "We usu

ally clear our travel with the Athlet
ic Department anyway. These aren't
really restrictions."
The Athletic Department said
that the case was still in a fact-find
ing stage. It has been forwarded to
the Dean of Students Office for fur
ther investigation.
"The band has been cooperative
and wants to get this resolved," said
Bob Carruesco, the assistant athletic
director for marketing.
