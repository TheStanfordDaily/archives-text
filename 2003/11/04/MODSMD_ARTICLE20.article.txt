## IM Football: another reason Branner sucks 
### 
I am not a smart guy.
I didn't get a 1600 on the SAT, I don't have a
4.0 and I think that Fiona Apple is the greatest
female vocalist of our time. I don't know how to
solve a Rubik's cube, get an eigenvalue or please a
woman. I can't find "x", Waldo, or Carmen Sandiego.
No, I'm not a smart guy.
But I do know this: if you punch someone in an IM
football game, it should be a penalty.
Is this revolutionary? I think not. Novel? No. Se
rial Groper? Should really be caught by now.
On a related note, isn't it just about that time when
some crazy kid from Columbae, Synergy or East Flo
starts a boycott of paying bike light tickets until the
Groper, or "Bert", as I like to call him, gets caught?
Am I wrong about this? Shouldn't the freshman rid
ing through the Tresidder lot on her way to Cardenal
not have to worry about the police busting her for a
dead battery when they can't catch an overweight
pervert on a K-Mart special? Also, I feel we're about
two weeks away from the Stanford Store churning

out a new line of butt-shorts that
say "You touch mine — I kick
yours," or "Don't even think about
it" ... maybe not. Just an idea.
But this column is ostensibly
about sports, so let me rant about
something other than the groper,
Branner IM football teams. I've
hated them in the past, I hate them
now and I will forever hate them in
the future. I hate them so very, very
much.

After having captained, played on and played
against them in a wide assortment of athletic activi
ties, I can honestly say they are just evil. It started as
a freshman living on the infamous (read: tame) third
floor, volunteering as the Intramural rep and thereby
suffering a huge hit to my romantic life for the rest of
the year.
But this year, it got personal. Let me set the stage.
This past Saturday, I arrived at the now-familiar
Sand HOI IM fields, playing football for the storied
Soto franchise against the Tonya Harding to our
Nancy Kerrigan, Branner. I was playing for the Soto
Gamecocks (those freshmen are so clever) thanks to
my brother, a freshman in the four-class dorm.
The game did not start well for us.
Thanks to an illegitimate pass rush, Branner got
good pressure on us 'cocks, forcing our quarterback
to launch deep balls off target, leading to several in
terceptions.
Now, to comment on their pass rush.
There are basically three rules in IM football
about a pass rush.
1: You cannot use a straight arm.
2. No holding.
3. No punching.
Guess how many of those rules Branner followed?
After a couple of our offensive linemen got com
pletely bowled over, I stepped in to find out first
hand.
On my very first play on the line, I was immedi
ately punched in the chest upon the snap, and as soon
as I righted myself, a man-child-with-way-too-much
hormonal-drive grabbed my red jersey, ripping it at
the neck, finally pushing me away with a straight arm
to the face.
I felt like I was in the Castro all over again, with
out a kind pre-op transsexual in a Hooters outfit to
help me up.
The first thing I did after the man-child molested
me — and then our quarterback well after he re
leased the ball — was yell at the referee, of course.
There were three referees on the field, the only job of
one of them being to watch the pass rush and quar
terback. I scolded him for quite some time, utilizing a
wide assortment of inappropriate and otherwise col
orful language.
I then turned to the man-child, berating him for
hitting our QB well after the play. After informing
him that this was in fact illegal, he responded with the
incredibly-well-thought-out response of "No! No!"
What an argument coming out of the man-child! If
there was ever a debate for why PWR needs to re
main a standard course for freshmen coming out of
repressive Catholic Schools where the kids' hor
mones can be seen oozing out their ears, it ended
here.
In the end, the referee never called a penalty on
them, even though my jersey, like my chest, is now
unbelievably ripped. I continued to lash out at the
referee throughout the game as Branner running
backs lowered their heads and plowed over our E)Bs,
downfield Branner blockers leveled our safeties after
the play and an unsportsmanlike penalty was called
(on us!) for retaliating against a late hit that went un
called.
But you see, I'm not a smart guy and this game
made sure I remembered that.
With about three minutes left in the game, assured
of a loss, the referee that I had swore at all game, a
guy who I made feel terrible for the awful things I said
to him throughout, a man I hated with a passion for
allowing frequent Branner transgressions, turned to
me and with the kindest, sweetest, softest tone, said,
"Hey Spencer, just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan
of your column, I read it every week."
I am an (expletive) idiot.
He knew my name, knew my column, probably
even wanted to date Hot Stuff and I spent my whole
day trying to make him feel terrible about himself.
I am such an idiot.
So all in all, I lost a football game, I lost the op
portunity to hit on Branner girls and I lost a reader.
Way to go Spencer. You are a moron.

Spencer Porter, a junior, asks Julie Ruvolo, the Fri
day columnist, if the soccer team is so popular, why
can't he get a date? Hmmmm? Maybe it's because
he's an (expletive) idiot (editor's note: or a walk-on).

suffering a huge hit to my romantic life for the rest of
the year.
But this year, it got personal. Let me set the stage.
This past Saturday, I arrived at the now-familiar
Sand HOI IM fields, playing football for the storied
Soto franchise against the Tonya Harding to our
Nancy Kerrigan, Branner. I was playing for the Soto
Gamecocks (those freshmen are so clever) thanks to
my brother, a freshman in the four-class dorm.
The game did not start well for us.
Thanks to an illegitimate pass rush, Branner got
good pressure on us 'cocks, forcing our quarterback
to launch deep balls off target, leading to several in
terceptions.
Now, to comment on their pass rush.
There are basically three rules in IM football
about a pass rush.
1: You cannot use a straight arm.
2. No holding.
3. No punching.
Guess how many of those rules Branner followed?
After a couple of our offensive linemen got com
pletely bowled over, I stepped in to find out first
hand.
On my very first play on the line, I was immedi
ately punched in the chest upon the snap, and as soon
as I righted myself, a man-child-with-way-too-much
hormonal-drive grabbed my red jersey, ripping it at
the neck, finally pushing me away with a straight arm
to the face.
I felt like I was in the Castro all over again, with
out a kind pre-op transsexual in a Hooters outfit to
help me up.
The first thing I did after the man-child molested
me — and then our quarterback well after he re
leased the ball — was yell at the referee, of course.
There were three referees on the field, the only job of
one of them being to watch the pass rush and quar
terback. I scolded him for quite some time, utilizing a
wide assortment of inappropriate and otherwise col
orful language.
I then turned to the man-child, berating him for
hitting our QB well after the play. After informing
him that this was in fact illegal, he responded with the
incredibly-well-thought-out response of "No! No!"
What an argument coming out of the man-child! If
there was ever a debate for why PWR needs to re
main a standard course for freshmen coming out of
repressive Catholic Schools where the kids' hor
mones can be seen oozing out their ears, it ended
here.
In the end, the referee never called a penalty on
them, even though my jersey, like my chest, is now
unbelievably ripped. I continued to lash out at the
referee throughout the game as Branner running
backs lowered their heads and plowed over our E)Bs,
downfield Branner blockers leveled our safeties after
the play and an unsportsmanlike penalty was called
(on us!) for retaliating against a late hit that went un
called.
But you see, I'm not a smart guy and this game
made sure I remembered that.
With about three minutes left in the game, assured
of a loss, the referee that I had swore at all game, a
guy who I made feel terrible for the awful things I said
to him throughout, a man I hated with a passion for
allowing frequent Branner transgressions, turned to
me and with the kindest, sweetest, softest tone, said,
"Hey Spencer, just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan
of your column, I read it every week."
I am an (expletive) idiot.
He knew my name, knew my column, probably
even wanted to date Hot Stuff and I spent my whole
day trying to make him feel terrible about himself.
I am such an idiot.
So all in all, I lost a football game, I lost the op
portunity to hit on Branner girls and I lost a reader.
Way to go Spencer. You are a moron.

Spencer Porter, a junior, asks Julie Ruvolo, the Fri
day columnist, if the soccer team is so popular, why
can't he get a date? Hmmmm? Maybe it's because
he's an (expletive) idiot (editor's note: or a walk-on).
Rub it in atporters@stanford.edu.

I am not a smart guy.
I didn't get a 1600 on the SAT, I don't have a
4.0 and I think that Fiona Apple is the greatest
female vocalist of our time. I don't know how to
solve a Rubik's cube, get an eigenvalue or please a
woman. I can't find "x", Waldo, or Carmen Sandiego.
No, I'm not a smart guy.
But I do know this: if you punch someone in an IM
football game, it should be a penalty.
Is this revolutionary? I think not. Novel? No. Se
rial Groper? Should really be caught by now.
On a related note, isn't it just about that time when
some crazy kid from Columbae, Synergy or East Flo
starts a boycott of paying bike light tickets until the
Groper, or "Bert", as I like to call him, gets caught?
Am I wrong about this? Shouldn't the freshman rid
ing through the Tresidder lot on her way to Cardenal
not have to worry about the police busting her for a
dead battery when they can't catch an overweight
pervert on a K-Mart special? Also, I feel we're about
two weeks away from the Stanford Store churning

out a new line of butt-shorts that
say "You touch mine — I kick
yours," or "Don't even think about
it" ... maybe not. Just an idea.
But this column is ostensibly
about sports, so let me rant about
something other than the groper,
Branner IM football teams. I've
hated them in the past, I hate them
now and I will forever hate them in
the future. I hate them so very, very
much.

After having captained, played on and played
against them in a wide assortment of athletic activi
ties, I can honestly say they are just evil. It started as
a freshman living on the infamous (read: tame) third
floor, volunteering as the Intramural rep and thereby
suffering a huge hit to my romantic life for the rest of
the year.
