# Runners take Pac-10 titles

### SEAN HOWELL 
Senior Grant Robison was not able to win his third
straight individual Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship, finishing second behind teammate Ian Dob
son, but junior Sara Bei won her second consecutive
title, finishing a tenth of a second ahead of teammate
Alicia Craig.
The one-two punch of Bei and Craig led the Cardinal
women to their eighth consecutive Pac-10 Champi
onship at the Washington State Golf Course in Pullman,
Wash., on Saturday. The team finished with 22 points,
far outpacing the rest of the field. Arizona State finished
second with 78 points.
"It's a really exciting thing to finish first for the eighth
year in a row," said Stanford head coach Dena Evans.
"It says a lot about the Stanford tradition, and it's really
meaningful for the women on the team."
Bei ran the 6,000-meter course in 21:12.10. Freshman
Arianna Lambie finished third and freshmen Katy and
Amanda Trotter placed sixth and 10th, respectively.
Craig jumped out to the early lead, while Bei and
Lambie moved up to join her later in the race. Bei and
Craig finished together, and Lambie came in seven sec
onds off the pace.
The strong performance by the three freshmen bodes
well for the Cardinal's chances in the final two races of
the season, the NCAA Regionals and Nationals.
"On this team, anyone has the ability to score,"
Evans said. "Arianna, Katy and Amanda have been
running well all year, but we have a number of good run
ners who have the ability to step up."
The race was the first the team has run in cold weath
er; the high in Pullman on Saturday was 34 degrees. The
team's strong performance in the cold is encouraging,
because weather conditions at the NCAA Regionals in
Portland, Ore., and at the Nationals in Waterloo, Iowa,
will be similar.
"It was a good experience to run in the cold, on the
hills and at the slight bit of altitude you find in Pullman,
because the conditions in our remaining races could be
very different than what we are used to in Palo Alto,"
Evans said. "The race gives us a lot of momentum going
into Regionals and NCAAs."
The men's team built up some momentum of its own,
winning the Pac-10 Championship with 23 points. Run
ner-up Oregon totaled 91 points, and Washington fin
ished third with 93.
