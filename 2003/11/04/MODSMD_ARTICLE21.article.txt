# Runners take Pac-10 titles
## 
### SEAN HOWELL 
Senior Grant Robison was not able to win his third
straight individual Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship, finishing second behind teammate Ian Dob
son, but junior Sara Bei won her second consecutive
title, finishing a tenth of a second ahead of teammate
Alicia Craig.
The one-two punch of Bei and Craig led the Cardinal
women to their eighth consecutive Pac-10 Champi
onship at the Washington State Golf Course in Pullman,
Wash., on Saturday. The team finished with 22 points,
far outpacing the rest of the field. Arizona State finished
second with 78 points.
"It's a really exciting thing to finish first for the eighth
year in a row," said Stanford head coach Dena Evans.
"It says a lot about the Stanford tradition, and it's really
meaningful for the women on the team."
Bei ran the 6,000-meter course in 21:12.10. Freshman
Arianna Lambie finished third and freshmen Katy and
Amanda Trotter placed sixth and 10th, respectively.
Craig jumped out to the early lead, while Bei and
Lambie moved up to join her later in the race. Bei and
Craig finished together, and Lambie came in seven sec
onds off the pace.
The strong performance by the three freshmen bodes
well for the Cardinal's chances in the final two races of
the season, the NCAA Regionals and Nationals.
"On this team, anyone has the ability to score,"
Evans said. "Arianna, Katy and Amanda have been
running well all year, but we have a number of good run
ners who have the ability to step up."
The race was the first the team has run in cold weath
er; the high in Pullman on Saturday was 34 degrees. The
team's strong performance in the cold is encouraging,
because weather conditions at the NCAA Regionals in
Portland, Ore., and at the Nationals in Waterloo, Iowa,
will be similar.
"It was a good experience to run in the cold, on the
hills and at the slight bit of altitude you find in Pullman,
because the conditions in our remaining races could be
very different than what we are used to in Palo Alto,"
Evans said. "The race gives us a lot of momentum going
into Regionals and NCAAs."
The men's team built up some momentum of its own,
winning the Pac-10 Championship with 23 points. Run
ner-up Oregon totaled 91 points, and Washington fin
ished third with 93.

Junior Jeane Goff and freshman Katy Trotter run at the Stanford Invitational earlier this year. The women's and men's
cross country teams won conference titles in Pullman, Wash., last weekend.
Dobson, a senior, won the 8,000-
meter race in 24:33.90. Robison
finished 1.6 seconds back, edging
Arizona's Robert Cheseret by
three tenths of a second for second
place.
"[Dobson] has always run well,
he just hasn't won many races," said
Stanford head coach Andy Gerard.
"It was nice to see him win and get
some of the accolades."
Senior Don Sage finished fourth.
He was followed by junior Chris
Emme in seventh and senior Adam
Tenforde in ninth as Stanford took
five of the top nine spots. Senior
Seth Hejny finished 12th and senior
Andrew Hill took 13th.
Dobson broke away from the
pack with 1,000 meters to go and
held the lead the rest of the way.
Gerard said that Robison was
not upset about narrowly missing
the opportunity to become the first
runner in Pac-10 history to win
three consecutive Pac-10 titles in his
first race of the season.
"He was pleased that we won
the team title, which has always
been his priority," Gerard said.
"The race was a good rust-buster
for him. I think he was happy that
he was able to bounce back and get
second."
Dobson said that the weather did
not have much of an effect on him.
"The cold was what I was more
worried about," Dobson said. "But
it turned out to be a nice day. We
knew we weren't going to be pre
pared for the cold, but there's really
nothing to do but tough it out."
Junior Ryan Hall, who finished
second overall at the Pre-NCAAs
on Oct. 18, did not run because
Gerard wanted to rest him. The
same can be said for senior Louis
Luchini, who finished sixth at the
same race.
Both men's and the women's
teams will spend the next two weeks
preparing for the NCAA West Re
gionals.
Interestingly enough, they may
be the only people on campus grate
ful for the recent stretch of bad
weather in Palo Alto.

Gerard said that Robison was
not upset about narrowly missing
the opportunity to become the first
runner in Pac-10 history to win
three consecutive Pac-10 titles in his
first race of the season.
"He was pleased that we won
the team title, which has always
been his priority," Gerard said.
"The race was a good rust-buster
for him. I think he was happy that
he was able to bounce back and get
second."
Dobson said that the weather did
not have much of an effect on him.
"The cold was what I was more
worried about," Dobson said. "But
it turned out to be a nice day. We
knew we weren't going to be pre
pared for the cold, but there's really
nothing to do but tough it out."
Junior Ryan Hall, who finished
second overall at the Pre-NCAAs
on Oct. 18, did not run because
Gerard wanted to rest him. The
same can be said for senior Louis
Luchini, who finished sixth at the
same race.
Both men's and the women's
teams will spend the next two weeks
preparing for the NCAA West Re
gionals.
Interestingly enough, they may
be the only people on campus grate
ful for the recent stretch of bad
weather in Palo Alto.
