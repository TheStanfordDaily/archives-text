# Volleyball survives scare by Sun Devils
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS 
With a five-game victory over the
Arizona State Sun Devils last Friday,
the Stanford women's volleyball
team was able to complete a sweep of
the visiting Arizona schools at
Maples Pavilion.
The win improved the Cardinal's
record to 17-5 overall and 10-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference. Arizona State
dropped to a 3-8 in conference play and
8-12 overall.
More importantly, however, the
Cardinal kept pace with UCLA and
California for second in the Pac-10, with
all three teams chasing No. 1 Southern
California coming down the stretch.
Stanford staked itself to a 2-0 lead
after the first two games and appeared
to be on the way to a three-game
sweep, leading 26-24 in Game 3. The
Sun Devils battled back though, and
converted on their sixth game point to
win,37-35.
After once again taking a lead late
into the game in the fourth, the Cardinal
lost 31-29.
The Cardinal returned to dominate
the Sun Devils in Game 5, as senior mid
dle blocker Jennifer Harvey served out
the final three points of a four-point
Cardinal run to take the decisive game,
15-9 and the match, 3-2.
Three Cardinal players led the way
on the offensive end, all with double
digit kill performances. Junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani led the way
with 19 kills, freshman outside hitter
Kristin Richards chipped in with 18 and
Harvey added 16 kills to go with her
seven blocks.
The Cardinal was able to take Game

1 from Arizona State, a feat the team
has had problems with throughout the
season. With the score tied at 24, the
Cardinal was able to put together a
three-point run and hold on for the
opening-game win.
"Winning the opener was key, be
cause we tend to put pressure on our
selves if we don't," said Stanford head
coach John Dunning. "If we get in that
early hole, it affects the way we play the
rest of the match."
Other notable efforts came from
sophomore setter Katie Goldhahn,
who had 50 assists and 10 digs, junior
outside hitter Jennifer Hucke (12 digs
and four blocks), junior defensive
specialist Leahi Hall (11 digs) and
sophomore libero Courtney Schultz
(13 digs).
For Arizona State, Natalie Harris
led the way with 23 kills, while Courtney
Blocher and Juliana Escobar had a
match-high 17 digs apiece.
Harvey was clearly the most produc
tive player of the match, though, not
only leading the team in blocks, but also
tallying 16 kills and leading the Cardinal
in hitting percentage at .464. She was
also at the service line for three strong
points at the end of the match to close
out the victory, including a service ace
to reach match point at 14-9.
The Cardinal next play host to cross
bay rival California, this Friday at
Maples Pavilion. The match is set for 7
p.m. and Stanford will be looking to
avenge a tight five-game loss sustained
at the hands of the Bears on Oct. 11.
The Bears have not beaten the Cardinal
at Maples since 1979.
Live coverage of the match will be
held on KZSU 90.1 FM.
