A collision with a buoy in the last mile
devastated the Cardinal men's varsity
eight's hopes of victory at Sunday's New
port Fall Rowing Festival at the Newport
Aquatic Center in Newport Beach, Calif.
The team, which was seeded first, fin
ished third with at time of 14:58, seven
seconds behind UC-Davis and one sec
ond behind USC.
"Anytime shells collide with a buoy it is

rather disturbing," said Stanford men's
head coach Craig Amerkhanian. "We
rowed the last mile with severe damage to
our number two rigger."
Prior to the collision, the team was
cruising. "Overall, our training and pre
buoy performance was strong enough to
win the regatta," Amerkhanian said.
"That our course was awful and dangerous
is something we will work on."
Just the weekend before, the varsity
eight finished first at the Head of the
American, 17 seconds ahead of UC-Davis.

The Stanford men's "B" team finished
fourth overall in 15:08 after crashing into
the same buoy.
Before Thursday it was questionable
whether the Cardinal would even compete
in the Newport Beach race, due to poor air
quality resulting from the extensive fires in
southern California.
"The air was very clean as we had
checked air quality throughout the week
in deciding if we would compete,"
Amerkhanian said.
Stanford's lightweight women's

team completed its fall distance season
with a first place finish in Newport.
The team finished in 16:27, 55 seconds
over second place San Diego Rowing
Club in the women's lightweight eight
event.
The Cardinal women's novice teams
finished sixth and thirteenth out of a field
of 27 in the Women's Frosh / Novice race,
their first race of the year. Stanford "A"
finished in 18:44, while Stanford "B" fin
ished with a time of 20:03. UCLA won the
event in 17:25.
