# Field hockey drops final regular season match
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford field hockey
team's regular season wound
down, it found itself facing one
final crucial game. Its final game
against conference opponent Pa
cific (8-6, 3-3 Northern Pacific
Athletic Conference) would ce
ment the seedings for the NorPac
Championships.
It also came down to the same
problems Stanford (4-12, 2-4 Nor-
Pac) has had to confront all season,
eventually leading t a 4-1 defeat.
"We just had an off day," said
sophomore forward Lyndsay Er
ickson. "Our weakness this year

was playing well when people had
off days."
These off days led to the Cardinal
finding itself closing out the season
with a sub-.500 record for the first
time in six years.
But it's not just the off days alone
that bothered Stanford this year.
The Cardinal had trouble closing out
games â€” in some instances, Stan
ford held the lead only to see it slide
away. Other times, such as in Satur
day's game, it came close by tying the
game, but could not pull through
with a victory.
"There were short times when we
dominated the game and there were
short times when Pacific dominat
ed," Erickson said. "It wasn't very

consistent."
Stanford, which is accustomed to
playing on artificial turf, also faced a
new problem.
"I would say we just didn't adjust
to the game on grass," said Stanford
head coach Lesley Irvine. "We
didn't adjust to the different style of
play that is required."
But other than that, "[Pacific]
played well and took some opportu
nities and we didn't," Irvine said.
The Tigers struck first as star
freshman forward Vianney Campos
showed why she leads the Tigers
with nine goals and 21 points by scor
ing the first goal of the game.
