# Field hockey drops final regular season match
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford field hockey
team's regular season wound
down, it found itself facing one
final crucial game. Its final game
against conference opponent Pa
cific (8-6, 3-3 Northern Pacific
Athletic Conference) would ce
ment the seedings for the NorPac
Championships.
It also came down to the same
problems Stanford (4-12, 2-4 Nor-
Pac) has had to confront all season,
eventually leading t a 4-1 defeat.
"We just had an off day," said
sophomore forward Lyndsay Er
ickson. "Our weakness this year

was playing well when people had
off days."
These off days led to the Cardinal
finding itself closing out the season
with a sub-.500 record for the first
time in six years.
But it's not just the off days alone
that bothered Stanford this year.
The Cardinal had trouble closing out
games — in some instances, Stan
ford held the lead only to see it slide
away. Other times, such as in Satur
day's game, it came close by tying the
game, but could not pull through
with a victory.
"There were short times when we
dominated the game and there were
short times when Pacific dominat
ed," Erickson said. "It wasn't very

consistent."
Stanford, which is accustomed to
playing on artificial turf, also faced a
new problem.
"I would say we just didn't adjust
to the game on grass," said Stanford
head coach Lesley Irvine. "We
didn't adjust to the different style of
play that is required."
But other than that, "[Pacific]
played well and took some opportu
nities and we didn't," Irvine said.
The Tigers struck first as star
freshman forward Vianney Campos
showed why she leads the Tigers
with nine goals and 21 points by scor
ing the first goal of the game.

Sophomore midfielder Missy Halliday works her way downfield against Southwest Missouri State earlier this season. The
Cardinal lost its final regular season match to Pacific, 4-1.
A little more than four minutes later, the Car
dinal struck back.
Freshman defender Aska Sturdevan passed the
ball to Erickson, who tied the game at 1-1. Erick
son finished the regular season with six goals and
15 points this season.
"I got a direct shot from Aska at the top of the
circle and I just deflected it," Erickson said.
Campos regained the lead for Pacific with her
second goal. She broke free up the middle for an
unassisted shot before the half.
The Tigers never looked back, as they went on
to score two more goals in the second half.
On what was "Senior Day" at Pacific, senior
midfielder Heather Kottmeier fittingly scored off
a second half penalty corner with an assist from
Campos. Pacific's fourth and final goal of the
game came three minutes later as another senior,
forward Alexandra Fiorina, fresh off a trip to Flo
rence, Italy, scored off another penalty corner.
Freshman forward Marissa Atilano was credited
with the assist.
Pacific goalie Gina Sadler closed out her colle
giate career and took the win for the Tigers with
three saves. Stanford goalkeeper Emily Zander
stopped the ball nine times and took the loss.
Pacific had a 16-7 shot advantage and a slim 11-
7 penalty corner advantage over Stanford.
The Tigers' win ended Stanford's 20-game win
ning streak over Pacific. At the start of the season
Pacific head coach Linda MacDonald had stated
that her team would no longer be intimidated by its
NorPac opponents. MacDonald kept her word as
Saturday's win also extended Pacific's winning
streak to a school record of five.
Stanford's loss resulted in a No. 3 seed in the
Western Division of the NorPac tournament,
which is being held this weekend in St. Louis, Mo.
They will face second-seeded Appalachian State
(11-7,4-2) from the Eastern Division this Friday.
The NorPac tournament allows Stanford to put
its disappointing regular season behind and ap
proach Friday with a new feeling of excitement.
"The NorPac Championships are like a new
slate for us to begin with," Irvine said.
And while the NorPac Championships give the
Cardinal a chance to start over, that does not mean
Stanford is leaving everything behind.
Stanford found it hard to play together at the
beginning of the season because half the team was
made up of incoming freshmen. After a rough
year, it can now say it goes into the NorPac tour
nament a closer team.
"We were a young team in terms of getting to
understand how everybody played," Irvine said.
"[Our biggest improvement] was the way [we]
connected and became a unit. I think it took a lot."

The NorPac tournament allows Stanford to put
its disappointing regular season behind and ap
proach Friday with a new feeling of excitement.
"The NorPac Championships are like a new
slate for us to begin with," Irvine said.
And while the NorPac Championships give the
Cardinal a chance to start over, that does not mean
Stanford is leaving everything behind.
Stanford found it hard to play together at the
beginning of the season because half the team was
made up of incoming freshmen. After a rough
year, it can now say it goes into the NorPac tour
nament a closer team.
"We were a young team in terms of getting to
understand how everybody played," Irvine said.
"[Our biggest improvement] was the way [we]
connected and became a unit. I think it took a lot."
