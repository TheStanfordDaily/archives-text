# First conference win eludes soccer team for ninth time
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Last weekend, the Cardinal
men's soccer squad scored more
goals than the team did in its past
eight games combined.
Stanford (2-14-2, 0-9 Pacific 10
Conference) succeeded in snapping
a six-game scoreless skid in Friday's
3-1 loss to unranked Washington
(10-2-2, 3-2-1 Pac-10) and Sunday's

3-2 overtime loss to No. 15 Oregon
State (12-4-0, 6-1 Pac-10).
"We scored some good goals this
weekend," said Stanford head coach
Bret Simon. "We played the best at
tacking soccer that we've played all
season."
Junior forward Darren Fernan
dez sparked the Stanford scoring
surge in the eighth minute of the
squad's faceoff with Washington.
Fernandez — who scored the Car

dinal's last goal, against Cal on Oc
tober 5 — took a pass from junior
James Twellman and booted the
ball past Huskies goalkeeper
Danny Waltman.
To say that Washington answered
quickly is an understatement. Less
than a minute after Fernandez's
goal, Ty Harden received a corner
kick and headed it into the net to tie
the game.
The Cardinal never relented, as
Fernandez and junior forward Matt
Janusz took shots from all over the
field, combining for eight of Stan
ford's total 13 shots. Freshman mid
fielder Marcus Ryan also came off
the bench and took three attempts.
However, the Huskies had more
luck getting shots into the goal, as
Troy Ready posted his fourth and
fifth goals of the season — one in the
17th minute off of a Brett Wiesner
cross, and one in the second half
after recovering a loose ball.
The 3-1 score wasn't the only bad
news for the Cardinal Friday night.
The team's starting goalkeeper, ju
nior Robby Fulton was injured be
fore the game, forcing freshman An
drew Kartunen into goal. Junior de
fender Aaron Maines also badly
bruised his hip flexor during the
game.
"The number of injuries made an
already thin defensive group even
thinner," Simon said.
Simon said that Fulton will possi
bly play this weekend, and Maines is
considered doubtful to take the field
this week.
The Cardinal scoring charge
continued on Sunday, as Stanford
got onto the board first again.
Twellman found the back of the net
25 minutes into the game on a 20-
yard free kick, scoring his third goal
on the season. Unfortunately for
the Cardinal, the notoriously explo
sive Beavers offense answered
back before the break, on a header
by Evan McNeley.
Oregon State was the first to
score after halftime, but the Cardinal
kept pressure on the Beaver defense.
Fernandez and Janusz again led the
team in shots, with three each and a
combined five on goal.
