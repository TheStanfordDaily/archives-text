# TABS receives grant to expand outreach
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
Technology Assist by Students, a student
group that connects Stanford students' technical
skills to Bay Area nonprofit organizations and
schools, received a $3,000 SBC Excelerator Grant
last week for its approach to community service
using technology.
TABS was one of few student-run organiza
tions awarded the grant this year from among the
683 groups across the nation who received a total
of $9 million from SBC Excelerator, the philan
thropic division of SBC Communications.
"SBC recognized the unique and valuable mis
sion of TABS and awarded the grant based on the
opportunities that the newfound resources would
make available to us," said Raymond Chan, Class
of 2002, the adviser and former member of TABS.
The money will be used for computer-related
equipment, including a laptop for on-site demon
strations, an upgraded server and licenses for
server software platforms.
"This grant will allow TABS to expand its
reach and resources, allowing us to purchase
much-needed equipment to support our pro
jects," Chan said. "In addition, the recognition
and publicity that this grant will receive helps
both TABS' recruiting efforts and our continuing
push to reach out to local nonprofits."
TABS gives free information technology and
computer consulting to aid non-profit organiza
tions. Students design and create technologies to
help improve the efficiency of the organizations.
Projects range from Web site development, soft
ware and computer training, technology support,
desktop publishing, graphic design and network
ing.
"TABS is important because we help other
nonprofits create more value," said senior Trisha
Okubo, president of TABS. "We allow them to
concentrate on what they do best, and we help fill
in the technological gaps."
Chan said the association is beneficial for both
the students in TABS, who utilize and develop
their technical skills while assisting the communi
ty, and local non-profits, who receive consulting
from "some of the best resources available â€”
Stanford students with rich skills in engineering,
writing and graphic design."
"TABS fills a niche for both Stanford students
and local nonprofits: Community service as tech

nical assistance and development that normally
would be beyond the financial reach of small or
ganization," Chan said.
The SBC grants support groups who use tech
nology access and resources to improve commu
nities and who focus on education, community de
velopment, health and human services or art and
culture. The awards were from $2,500 up to
$25,000.
"These grants provide critical funding to hun
dreds of organizations that are interested in more
fully integrating technology into their ongoing op
erations and community outreach efforts," said
William Daley, president of SBC Communica
tions, in a press release.
TABS, which has about 150 members, was
started in 2000 by four undergraduates.
"It was at the end of the dot-com boom, and
they saw a need for a technology resource for non
profit organizations and schools," Okubo said.
"Realizing what a great resource tech-sawy Stan
ford students could be, they decided to facilitate
the connection."
In the past, TABS created a Web site called
"Bridging 101" to connect students at the
Cesar Chavez Elementary School in East Palo
Alto to tutors and teachers through message
boards and grading systems. Last year, the
group also made a database system for the Palo
Alto division of InnVision, a South Bay organi
zation that provides services to at-risk and
homeless individuals, to manage their volun
teer base and track timesheet hours for their
programs.
This year, prospective projects include the re
vision of the Haas Center Web site, updating the
Women's Choice Clinic Web site and creating a
database and Web site for the Bread Project, a
nonprofit organization based in New York City.
"Blending technology with community ser
vice, Technology Assist By Students encourages
the socially conscious side of engineering and
other tech-sawy students," Okubo said.
The grant will help the group expand its out
reach further with better resources and, in turn,
an increased capacity for project development,
according to Okubo.
"Not only will TABS be able to expand the
range of services offered to a single organization,
but these groups that we provide assistance to can
also help get our name out to other nonprofits in
need of technological help," she said.
