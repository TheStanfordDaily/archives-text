As outgoing California Gov. Gray
Davis and Gov.-elect Arnold
Schwarzenegger begin their series of
meetings in the state Capitol, the transfer
of power has begun — and Stanford
scholars have already begun helping de
sign the new face of California politics.
Five Hoover Institution fellows —
Annelise Anderson, John Cogan,
George Shultz, Michael Boskin and Pete
Wilson — have been appointed to the 65-
member transition team that will help
shape economic policy and advise
Schwarzenegger on general policy in
coming months.

"The role of the transition team is pri

director of the Office of Management
and Budget during the Reagan adminis

John Cogan, co-chairman of the bud

budget will be presented in January 2004.
The second objective is to develop a
workable plan for addressing the inherit

George Schultz, a former U.S. secre
tary of state, called the attempt "one of
the most unusual ones" that he has seen.
"He is in a position to do so because he
is as new on the Republican scene as on
the political one and is not carrying the
political baggage of people around him,"
Schultz said. "He doesn't have anyone
whom he needs to 'reward.' "
The 65-member team, Schultz said,

will not necessarily reflect the future
strategy of the administration.
"They are people from all walks of
life, with varied levels of expertise,"
Schultz said.
The members of the team from Stan
ford said that while Schwarzenegger likes
to hear different views and the exchange
of ideas, he makes independent deci
sions, so it is impossible to predict the ex
tent to which the suggestions of the team
will translate into actual policy.
"However, it reflects the governor's
keen desire to rely on expertise," Cogan
said. "From Stanford we have a former
secretary of state and a director of fi
