# Satisfaction with cosmetic surgery declines over time, Medical Center study shows
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER 
Before deciding to go through with cosmetic
surgery, people should consider the choice carefully,
judging from the findings of a study by a researcher at
the Stanford University Medical Center.
Satisfaction with the results of surgical procedures
meant to smooth complexions declines over time, ac
cording to the study by Ritu Sonia Batra, a dermatol
ogy resident at the Medical Center.
"These findings emphasize the importance of pa
tient preparation during the preoperative visit and on
going dialogue with the patient after [laser skin resur
facing surgery]," Batra said. "Patients with unrealistic
expectations of what the procedure can actually ac
complish will most benefit from preoperative screen
ing and counseling."
Batra studied laser skin resurfacing surgery per
formed in 1999 for wrinkles or sun-damaged skin and
acne scarring, asking patients to assess their cosmetic
surgery experience at intervals after the operation.
"We queried the patients about their experiences
one day, three days and one week after the surgery and
again at three weeks, six weeks, 12 weeks and 30
months," Batra said.
The study showed that "although satisfaction re

mained quite high, it decreased significantly over
time," according to Batra.
"After three months, 100 percent of patients said
they felt they looked better than they did before the
procedure," Batra said. "By 30 months, 88 percent
said they looked better."
Patient willingness to undergo the surgery again
followed a similar pattern: It decreased from 89 per
cent at three months after the surgery to 71 percent in
30 months, according to Batra.
"The overall aesthetic results of [surgery] remained
good after 30 months," Batra said. "However, the de
cline in satisfaction between three and 30 months may
represent a real reduction in clinical improvement
over time."
Batra also found that on the day of the procedure,
37 percent of patients reported being very worried
about the outcome and that 11 percent considered
laser resurfacing a "terrible experience."
In order to further investigate the topic, Batra pro
posed an evaluation of the effect of different ap
proaches to preoperative preparation on a patient's
perception of the outcome of the surgery.
"In addition, it would be interesting to revisit
these patients in the future, perhaps five years after
their procedures, to evaluate their impressions
then," she said.
