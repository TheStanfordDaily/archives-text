# Brauman wins highest science honor

Chemistry Prof. John Brauman will receive the na
tion's highest scientific honor from President George
Bush at a White House ceremony this Thursday.
Brauman is the 29th person at Stanford and the fifth
Stanford chemist to receive the National Medal of Sci
ence, awarded to individuals "deserving of special recog
nition by reason of their outstanding contributions to
knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical or
engineering sciences."
The National Medal of Science in chemistry has typi
cally been awarded to multiple individuals each year.
However, Brauman is the sole recipient in that category
this year, has become the fourth chemist in the nation to
not share the award. Seven people in four other fields will
also receive National Medals of Science this Thursday.
"It's a great honor, in part because of the other people
that have won it and the number of people that get select
ed," Brauman said.
The U.S. Congress established the National Medal of
Science in 1959. A committee of 12 scientists and engi
neers, appointed by the president of the United States, is
responsible for evaluating the nominees for the award.
"Brauman advanced scientific knowledge by demon
strating differences in chemical reactivity in the presence or

absence of solvent, making it possible to infer the role sol
vent plays in chemical stability and reactivity," the National
Science Foundation said in a press release. "He developed
techniques for exploring and enhancing understanding of
energy transfer and its effects on chemical dynamics."
Brauman's research examined chemical equilibria, re
action rates and behavior.
Born in 1937 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Brauman received his
bachelor's degree in 1959 from the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology and his doctorate in 1963 from UC-
Berkeley. After completing a fellowship at UCLA, he
came to Stanford in 1963 as an assistant professor, be
came an associate professor in 1969 and reached full pro
fessor status in 1972.
Brauman said he owes his success, in part, to the Uni
versity and to the graduate students and colleagues he
works with, calling his research "a collective effort."
"I am happy to say that one doesn't win these kinds of
awards without a lot of assistance from other people," he
said. "I've had work that's been done with absolutely
wonderful graduate students, who have contributed both
their professional skills and their intellectual skills to help
me solve problems."
Brauman said he is continuing his research with chem
ical reactions involving ions and solvents.
"The theme's the same," he said, but "the details are
different."
