# MONEY AT STANFORD
## Job seekers choose between pay and pleasure 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Rob Gallardo, who graduated from Stanford in 1982
with a degree in sociology, was never interested in being
"super-rich" — but his parents had a different idea.
They wanted him to be a dentist or an attorney for the
associated prestige and money.
After having little luck landing a suitable social ser
vice job, Gallardo worked as a broker's assistant for
Charles Schwab in San Francisco, where he made
$23,000 during his first year out of college.
Two decades later, Gallardo's career path has taken
a different turn. Now, he relies on his personal funds to
run a counseling referral service for at-risk youth in El
Paso, Texas, through a Web site called OnRamp.
Come June, 1,700 seniors will face the first phase of
their post-collegiate lives. For many, that phase is the
working world. Many, like Gallardo, have found that
the balance between passion and pay is an important
variable in the job search.
A wide range of salaries
According to the Career Development Center's 2003
survey, starting salaries averaged $55,667 for electrical
engineering graduates and $62,273 for computer science
graduates. The starting salaries for four students who
earned their bachelor's degrees in materials science and
engineering ranged from $70,000 to $102,000.
But "techies" are not the only Stanford graduates
who have the option of entering high-paying careers.
According to WetFeet, a career information database,
"Consulting is one of the highest-paying careers open to
undergraduates with nontechnical backgrounds," offer
ing $50,000 to $60,000 a year. Starting salaries for in
vestment banking fall in the same range.
In contrast, careers in social work start at $30,000 to
$40,000, while those in music, writing and acting come
by salaries as small as about $20,000, $25,000 and
$30,000, respectively.
The median salary for teachers across the country
was $37,610 to $42,080 in 2000, according to the U.S. Bu
reau of Labor Statistics.
Tempting rewards
The jobs that ultimately win over Stanford graduates
must entice them with tempting rewards. These are
often, though not always, financial.
A graduate student in statistics who preferred to re
main anonymous said that he attended the fall career
fair with money in mind.
While he emphasized the additional importance of a

job's location, title and growth potential, he considers
himself a realist in financial matters.
"I'm not going to work at Starbucks as a barista," he
said.
Obtaining high-ranking internships in the past, he
said, has raised his standards. By also pursuing a mas
ter's degree this year, he anticipates a starting salary
$20,000 to $30,000 higher than that offered to someone
without a graduate degree.
But factors other than pay also figure in employment
decisions.
Good benefits and hours, a pleasant work environment
and a sense of altruistic efficacy, for example, are all
among the potential perks to jobs beyond life on the
Farm.
Consider recent international relations graduate
Renee Jacobson. Since starting a job as a paralegal in
New York City last June, she makes $35,000 a year. The
salaries offered by the advertising and public relations

companies she considered during
her job search "wouldn't even have
covered my living expenses, so I de
cided against [those fields] { " she
said.
Jacobson's next goal is to attend
law school in 2004, which she hopes
will ultimately increase her earning
potential to $150,000 at the same
law firm she works for now.
Despite her interest in doing pro
bono work after law school, she ac
knowledged that "struggling for a
living in order to help others" in the
public sector is less appealing than
jobs in corporate law.
Stanford's graduating class re
mains a heavily business- and tech
nology-bound crowd.
After conducting an informal
survey, senior class Vice President
of Career and Academics Jake
Kirsh estimated that 60 percent to
70 percent of his classmates will
enter consulting, business, invest
ment banking or engineering, while
only 10 percent will go into public
service.
Starting salary is a small factor
for Kirsch himself, although he
hopes to enter management or con
sulting, fields that typically pay well.
He said his decision was more
heavily based on the opportunity to
"do something that I enjoy that
gives me exposure to different in
dustries or areas of business."
Captivating interest
Some say a job that captivates in
terest is key in the long run, regard
less of the money it brings in.
The CDC Web site advises, "the
'best' major is the one that excites a
student and is pursued for the sake
of wanting to learn as much as possi
ble about the discipline, as opposed
to one that might land a high paying
job."
District Intern Recruiter for the
Los Angeles Unified School District
Willie V. Triplett believes that a de

spite the lower salaries offered by
his field, students who already have
a committed interest in teaching are
not discouraged from doing so —
especially in the context of the cur
rent recession.
He sees Stanford as a setting
where he can get other "talented in
dividuals to consider teaching as an
option."
Public service advocates like
Triplett might be successful in this
pursuit; according to a CDC survey
of 320 of last year's bachelor's,
master's and doctoral degree recip
ients, 50 went into computer jobs
while a comparable 48 went into
education.
This is despite the vast differ
ence between the average starting
salaries for the respondents in the
two fields: Computer jobs paid
$36,046 more among undergradu
ates and $30,186 more among mas
ter's students.
While one elementary school
teacher made $26,000 his first year
after obtaining a political science
degree, one computer program
manager with a bachelor's degree
started out with a salary as high as
$76,000.
Though Marlene Scherer Stern,
a career counselor at the CDC, ex
pressed faith that students select
careers based on interest rather
than earning potential, she added
that money remains "part of the
equation."
"Students don't want it to be as
much an issue as it is," Stern quali
fied, but the "reality of student
loans" and other pressing financial
situations can make money matter.
"I want to break even in living
expenses and loan interest," ex
plained Alison Appling, a senior in
symbolic systems. "Anything more
will be icing on the cake."
Appling, who hopes to go into a
sustainable agriculture or educa
tional public program like Earth
Corps or Teach for America, says
a feeling of self-sufficiency is im
portant for students who have
been financially dependent on
their families for longer than most

young adults.
Changing paths
Choy said students should not
worry about choosing the wrong
career right out of Stanford. Ac
cording to the CDC Web site, sur
veys of the Classes of 1994, 1995
and 1996 found that 40 to 50 per
cent of alumni change their job
within two years of graduation.
"It is the experience and what a
talented, motivated Stanford grad
uate does with the experience that
determines anything," Choy said.
Management Science and Engi
neering graduate student Florence
Thng said her perspective changed
after spending five years in the
working world.
Before coming to Stanford she
worked at Hewlett-Packard in Col
orado. However, her first job im
pressed Thng with its people, not its
money. Of her employment offers,
HP paid the least by 50 percent.
"After working, there is a brand
new set of criteria" in her employ
ment goals, explained Thng, who
wants to shift away from technical
research and into organization and
management.
Norbert Wu, an electrical engi
neer who graduated in 1983, had a
similar experience with his first job
as a systems analyst. Though the
job paid well, "after nine months as
a corporate player, I quit to pursue
a job more closely related to my in
terests in marine biology," he told
the CDC.
He now runs his own photogra
phy business and documents threat
ened marine species through a
Pew's Fellow's Grant in Marine
Conservation. "Money only means
so much," he reflected.
Gallardo, who 17 works hours a
day without a salary, agreed.
"I've always been a bleeding
heart about social service causes, es
pecially as they relate to teens and
Hispanic youth in the barrio," he
said, adding that he was happy to
make the occupational change and
realize his dreams.
