# MONEY AT STANFORD
## Job seekers choose between pay and pleasure 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Rob Gallardo, who graduated from Stanford in 1982
with a degree in sociology, was never interested in being
"super-rich" â€” but his parents had a different idea.
They wanted him to be a dentist or an attorney for the
associated prestige and money.
After having little luck landing a suitable social ser
vice job, Gallardo worked as a broker's assistant for
Charles Schwab in San Francisco, where he made
$23,000 during his first year out of college.
Two decades later, Gallardo's career path has taken
a different turn. Now, he relies on his personal funds to
run a counseling referral service for at-risk youth in El
Paso, Texas, through a Web site called OnRamp.
Come June, 1,700 seniors will face the first phase of
their post-collegiate lives. For many, that phase is the
working world. Many, like Gallardo, have found that
the balance between passion and pay is an important
variable in the job search.
A wide range of salaries
According to the Career Development Center's 2003
survey, starting salaries averaged $55,667 for electrical
engineering graduates and $62,273 for computer science
graduates. The starting salaries for four students who
earned their bachelor's degrees in materials science and
engineering ranged from $70,000 to $102,000.
But "techies" are not the only Stanford graduates
who have the option of entering high-paying careers.
According to WetFeet, a career information database,
"Consulting is one of the highest-paying careers open to
undergraduates with nontechnical backgrounds," offer
ing $50,000 to $60,000 a year. Starting salaries for in
vestment banking fall in the same range.
In contrast, careers in social work start at $30,000 to
$40,000, while those in music, writing and acting come
by salaries as small as about $20,000, $25,000 and
$30,000, respectively.
The median salary for teachers across the country
was $37,610 to $42,080 in 2000, according to the U.S. Bu
reau of Labor Statistics.
Tempting rewards
The jobs that ultimately win over Stanford graduates
must entice them with tempting rewards. These are
often, though not always, financial.
A graduate student in statistics who preferred to re
main anonymous said that he attended the fall career
fair with money in mind.
While he emphasized the additional importance of a

job's location, title and growth potential, he considers
himself a realist in financial matters.
"I'm not going to work at Starbucks as a barista," he
said.
Obtaining high-ranking internships in the past, he
said, has raised his standards. By also pursuing a mas
ter's degree this year, he anticipates a starting salary
$20,000 to $30,000 higher than that offered to someone
without a graduate degree.
But factors other than pay also figure in employment
decisions.
Good benefits and hours, a pleasant work environment
and a sense of altruistic efficacy, for example, are all
among the potential perks to jobs beyond life on the
Farm.
Consider recent international relations graduate
Renee Jacobson. Since starting a job as a paralegal in
New York City last June, she makes $35,000 a year. The
salaries offered by the advertising and public relations
