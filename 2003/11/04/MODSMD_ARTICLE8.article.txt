# Researchers create expanded DNA molecule
## 
### GEOFF KOCH 
In a year that marks the 50th anniversary of the
discovery by Watson and Crick of the structure of
DNA, Stanford researchers have created a "xDNA"
molecule that glows in the dark, is bigger and
stronger than its natural counterpart and might
someday help to identify life on other planets.
The new molecule is described by Chemistry Prof.
Eric Kool and chemistry graduate student Haibo Liu
in the Oct. 31 issue of the journal Science.
"One of the main motivations for this work was to
ask the question, 'How else could DNA look?' "
Kool said. "So we designed this new form of DNA,
and we used the tools of organic chemistry to build
it."
DNA contains coded instructions to build all cel
lular creatures — like squirrels and Stanford stu
dents — and most viruses. The molecule is shaped
like a twisted spiraling ladder, the rungs of which are
chemical compounds called bases.
Nature knows only two possible pairings of these

compounds, or base pairs. Adenine (A) always
matches to thymine (T) while guanine (G) matches
to cytosine (C). The Stanford scientists' innovation
was to tack benzene — a flat ring-shaped molecule
comprised of 6 carbon atoms - onto A and T base
pairs.
xDNA is marked by a new chemical pairing: en
larged A with normal T and enlarged T with normal
A. The result is a machine-made molecule 20 percent
wider and more thermally stable than natural DNA.
Kool's xDNA, which appeared in a blink com
pared to the formation of the first self-replicating
molecules that took millions of years, nonetheless is
evidence of his team's persistence.
His team started from scratch, spending years
making stretched molecules and trying to get them to
form helices.
Kool was pleased with the eventual result. "Not
only does it work — a that is, form a double helix —
a but it does so especially well."
Researchers tinkering with genetic material have
been the source of both promise and controversy.

Genetic engineering — a which involves working
with genetic material from existing organisms and is
distinct from Kool's "from scratch" work — a has
produced pest-resistant crops, fast growing fish and
cows capable of increased milk production.
Kool sees possible applications of xDNA in medi
cine, where the glow-in-the dark property could
prove especially useful. Researchers could use
xDNA to stain a biopsy of a tumor and then identify
a particular mutation by looking for certain patterns
of fluorescence under the microscope. Knowing the
exact mutation might help doctors to select the right
drug.
As it happens, genetic engineering's best success
es also have come in medicine. In 1982, the Food and
Drug Administration approved the use of insulin
produced by common bacteria with bits of human
DNA spliced into the organism's genetic code. Since
then, engineered proteins and drugs to help people
with ailments such as heart disease, anemia, hemo
philia and cancer have been approved.
xDNA also might help in the search for life on

other planets.
Life likely requires a self-replicating molecule ca
pable of storing and passing down information. "But
there's no reason that molecule has to be DNA,"
Kool said. Understanding alternate forms of DNA
might help scientists know what they are looking for
as they begin to use robots to explore the solar sys
tem and look for life, he said.
Fears of an altogether new kind of life creeping
out of a Stanford lab should be put to rest. Natural
DNA is capable of copying itself, an important first
step if it is ever to be used by cellular machinery to
produce proteins that eventually mix together to
make those squirrels and Stanford students.
The molecule produced by the Stanford team,
however, is not capable of replication. "xDNA is too
big for the natural enzymes that copy DNA," Kool
said, adding that the molecule produced by the ma
chines in his lab contains no more than 50 base pairs.
Natural DNA, by contrast, contains billions of base
pairs.
"No machine can produce that," Kool said.
