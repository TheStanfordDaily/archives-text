## 8.9 x 106 on the Richter scale? Starquakes

Starquakes
Astronomers studying starquakes have
obtained a clearer picture of stellar evolution.
The study combined more than 1400 obser
vations made at La Silla Observatory in Chile
over the course of 21 years. It focused on a
massive B start known as HD 129929. This
star has a well-developed core but little is
known about the upper, more stable layers.
The astronomers studied two movements:
'core overshooting', which is the mixing of
material from the core to the upper layers,
and the rotation of the star itself. By under
standing these two effects they have devel
oped a better model of how stars evolve.
Destroying Nuclear Weapons
Physicists at Japan and Hawaii have pro
posed a futuristic technology that would use

an ultra-high energy neu
trino beam to destroy nu
clear weapons. The scien
tists propose condensing
the energy of the neutrinos
so they would vaporize or
melt a nuclear bomb. Neu
trinos are fundamental
particles of matter and
come in three "flavors".
They are electrically neu
tral and interact weakly

with matter which means they can travel
through thousands of kilometers without
being absorbed. There are currently experi
ments trying to send man-made neutrinos
from one place to another. A high energy
neutrino beam is a "vast extrapolation of
these methods", in the words of one of the au
thors.
Memory is Subjective
Memory can be a dangerous thing. At
least that is what a study of eyewitness ac
counts published in the Journal of Experi
mental Psychology: Applied shows. Iowa re
searchers asked 253 participants to watch a
staged crime video and then to identify a sus
pect from a six-man lineup. The catch - none
of them was the true culprit. Unaware of this,
after making their choice, the eyewitnesses
were then told they had identified the suspect
correctly. Upon this the eyewitnesses tended
to further overstate their confidence and rec
ollection of details. The false certainty was
equally strong whether they heard the affir
mation right afterwards or 48 hours later. The
authors believe this is an important consider
ation for obtaining unbiased accounts from
eyewitnesses.
Humans evolved from
Small Population
Mar Feldman, professor of biology at
Stanford, believes that all humans today may
be descended from a very small population.
According to the study published in the
American Journal of Human Genetics the
entire population of ancestral humans who
expanded from Africa was around 2000. The
researchers determined this by comparing
377 markers in DNA collected from 1,056 in
dividuals representing 52 geographic sites in
all continents. "The exciting thing about
these data is that they are amenable to a com
bination of mathematical models and statisti
cal analyses that can help solve problems that
are important in paleontology, archaeology
and anthropology," Feldman said. The num
ber also explains why humans have such little
genetic variability compared to chimpanzees
and other closely related species.
Contact Lenses with Dual Function
University of Florida researchers are de
veloping contact lenses that will work as
both eyeglasses and drug-delivery systems.
The lenses, which are still under preliminary
testing, contain drug-filled particles that
slowly release medication into the eye. This
could be potentially useful to treat such ail
ments as glaucoma, which affects 2.2 million
Americans. Glaucoma and cataracts are
currently treated with eye drops, which is in
efficient because very little is absorbed.
Right now the researchers are working to
ensure that the drug delivery has a steady
rate and after that they will move to clinical
trials. They estimate the technology will hit
the markets in a decade, at the same price as
conventional eye lenses.
Parasites that mimic their Hosts
A parasite that pretends to be its host so it
can get a free lunch? Life on Earth is indeed
full of surprises. A group of tiny insects called
twisted-wing parasites (Strepsiptera) mimic
their host skin. The host is then fooled into
thinking the parasite is part of its body. The
parasite punches through the exoskeleton
and lays eggs. The eggs develop into larva,
which then feed and grow from within the
host. "Strepsipterans are very weird, and this
is another example of them doing something
weird," said Charles Godfray, an evolution
ary biologist at Imperial College in London.
