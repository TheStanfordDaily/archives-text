# ASSU funds wet tailgate for first time in years
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
If you throw it and provide alcohol they
will come.
So goes the age-old party adage, which the
ASSU is, presumably, putting its faith in. After
decades of funding exclusively alcohol-free
events, the undergraduate Senate approved
money last night for a tailgate party this Saturday,
which will include kegs.
The party, planned for 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the
Mirrielees Courtyard, is open to all students and
will offer free pizza and beer. ASSU senators
hope that the event will spur student interest in
Cardinal athletics in general and, more specifical
ly, the football game against Arizona State that af
ternoon.
"If you saw the student section [at the football
game] this last week," said Stanley Wilson, a sen
ator and football player, "there were no stu
dents."
While most senators agreed with the idea be
hind the party, many took exception with
specifics, including the cost of security, the pres
ence of alcohol and the hasty timeline.
"I don't feel like I can support this," said
sophomore Jason Sinocruz, a senator. "It think
it's a great idea. But the problem is, basically,
time. I think it would be irresponsible for me to
support this and feel completely confident that we
do it in time."
Members of the student life committee submit
ted a party proposal plan to the Office of Student
Activities only yesterday morning. After an initial
rejection, they resubmitted an altered plan late in
the afternoon. Approval is still pending.
"I love the idea and I think I would love to
work with the ASSU to have more events like
this," said Nanci Howe, the director of student ac
tivities. "We could have benefited by having more
lead time."
Typically, OSA requires 14-day notice for par
ties of this type. In this case, Joey Greenwell, the
assistant director of student activi
ties, has "waived the normal re
quirements," according to Howe.
Senators and faculty advisers also
expressed concern about putting the
ASSU's name on an event that pro
vides alcohol. Such an action, argued
some, would put the ASSU in a posi
tion of unnecessary risk.
"My concerns revolve around the
whole alcohol issue," said Morris
Graves, associate dean of students.
"If something happened on the neg
ative side and the ASSU undergrad
uate senate ends up in front of the
[Organizational Conduct Board],

that's unprecedented. That would
be an interesting kind of dynamic."
Sinocruz, with nodded affirma
tions from several others in the
room, proposed an amendment to
the funding bill that would remove
the money for alcohol.
If such an amendment had
passed, said junior Alex Moore,
"then we're just buying pizza for
Mirrielees," implying that students
would not come to a non-alcoholic
tailgater. "You're changing the na
ture of the event."
A tailgate party without the kegs
"might as well just be an Absolute
Fun event," Wilson said.
To appease worries about the
risk of an alcoholic party, the stu
dent life committee provided funds
for additional security over and

above that required by OSA. Com
mittee members plan to hire four to
six professional security guards and
provide another 15 "sober moni
tors," garnered from the ranks of
senators and senate associates.
"It's not going to be that intense
or big an event," Moore said.
"We're over-hiring security. This is
going to be overly secured."
"We're expecting 450 guests,"
said sophomore George Hill, chair
of the student life committee. With
the security guards and volunteers,
"we'll be definitely exceeding the
requirement of one sober monitor
for every 50 guests."
After the extensive debate, the
funding bill narrowly passed with
six in favor, five against and one ab
stention.
