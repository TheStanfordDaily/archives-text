# ASSU funds wet tailgate for first time in years
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
If you throw it and provide alcohol they
will come.
So goes the age-old party adage, which the
ASSU is, presumably, putting its faith in. After
decades of funding exclusively alcohol-free
events, the undergraduate Senate approved
money last night for a tailgate party this Saturday,
which will include kegs.
The party, planned for 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the
Mirrielees Courtyard, is open to all students and
will offer free pizza and beer. ASSU senators
hope that the event will spur student interest in

"I don't feel like I can support this," said
sophomore Jason Sinocruz, a senator. "It think
it's a great idea. But the problem is, basically,
time. I think it would be irresponsible for me to
support this and feel completely confident that we
do it in time."
Members of the student life committee submit
ted a party proposal plan to the Office of Student
Activities only yesterday morning. After an initial
rejection, they resubmitted an altered plan late in
the afternoon. Approval is still pending.
"I love the idea and I think I would love to
work with the ASSU to have more events like
this," said Nanci Howe, the director of student ac
tivities. "We could have benefited by having more
lead time."
