# Answer boy: Ignore your cheating heart
## 
### 
• I'm a pre-med student and I
A 1 • have a ton of midterms this
§ J week on everything from mito
chondrial inheritance to pro
tein-protein interaction. I also have to do
some serious work on my research on pre
natal peptide synthesis. I have absolutely
no time to study. Answer Boy, should I
cheat? And, if so, how should I cheat? I
have really sweaty palms and can't write
answers on my hands without the words
getting smeared.
A • First off: Quit medicine.
/■ • Every Stanford student
/ 1 comes here thinking he's
-X JL going to be a doctor. They
also all think they're doing it out of sheer

selflessness, out of saintliness on
the level of Mother Teresa. As
much as you want to tell yourself
it's about the people and not the
money, it's not. Your grand
mother may believe you, but I
don't.
Second: Don't give in to the
red-clothed little curmudgeon
on your shoulder. Cheating has
serious repercussions, despite
what movies and politicians
would have you believe.

Stanford's Office of Judicial Affairs
has the responsibility of investigating,
trying and then punishing students
charged with violating the honor code.
This, obviously, makes them one of the

most popular organizations on
campus. Oh, they hand out candy
in their office, too.
Going before a judicial affairs
panel is no laughing matter. The
time between the filing of a com
plaint and sanctioning of a student
can be 10 weeks that's longer
than a Hollywood marriages. Last
year 130 cases were reported to
JA. The typical punishment is a
one-quarter suspension and 40

hours of community service.
And, unlike the time spent in your fu
ture career in professional medicine,
those 40 hours are not billable.
However, the good folk at JA do ev
erything they can to be fair to you. The

burden of proof is "beyond a reasonable
doubt," meaning you're judged on the
same standard as first-degree murderers
and rapists.
And students sit on the panel. This is
good because, presumably, those stu
dents understand your side of things bet
ter than the balding TA that is accusing
you of academic dishonesty.
But don't cheat. Or at least don't sign
the honor code printed on the test book
let before you do. And don't be a doctor,
either. How are you going to hold a
scalpel with those gross palms?

If you 're thinking about being a doctor, let
Answer Boy talk you out of it. Contact
