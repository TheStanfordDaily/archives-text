## Admissions bill would hurt Stanford 
### 
Most people would agree that
universities are best run by
those who are living and work
ing on college campuses. Since
higher education became a priority in this
country, colleges haven't been regulated by
the federal government. However, a new
bill, passed last Tuesday by the U.S. Senate,
could change the way Stanford and
every other institution of higher learning in
the country admits its incoming student
body. The Higher Education Reauthoriza
tion Act, headed by Democratic Mas
sachusetts senator Edward Kennedy,
would open the door to federal interven
tion in college admissions policies.
While University President John Hen
nessy said the bill would have insignificant
financial repercussions for Stanford, he did
not like the idea of the federal government
instituting a "one size fits all" policy that
was not in the best interest of students. We
agree with his assessment.

If passed, the bill would limit federal
funding to schools based on their early de
cision policy and their standards for admit
ting legacies. However, Hennessy stressed
that all schools have a set of rules that work

best for them, and that a policy similar to
Kennedy's would hurt institutions.
Although admitting a number of lega
cies may sound like an elitist move, it is
necessary to build strong alumni loyalty.
By having a strong alumni association,
schools like Stanford are able to raise more
money and thus can offer better financial
aid packages to those who can't afford col
lege. The ironic part of the legislation just
passed by the Senate is that it may end up
harming the students it was meant to pro
tect.
It is not the role of the U.S. Senate to de
cide how individual universities are run.
Early decision and legacy policies should
be left up to each school. Each college has
a unique history, as well as a way of doing
things. Creating uniform regulations to be
enforced nationwide only creates more
problems.
The power of self-regulation is part of
what makes each university unique, and
blanket rules for colleges don't belong on
Capitol Hill. We hope that President
George Bush will recognize the shortcom
ings of this legislation and will refuse to
sign it when it lands on his desk in the com
ing months.
