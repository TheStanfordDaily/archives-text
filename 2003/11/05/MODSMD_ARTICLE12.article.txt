# GE's contract changes are fair

### 
Cardinal Cogen workers are one
step closer to equitable treatment
and pay. Last Friday, General
Electric, the company subcon
tracted by the University to operate the
campus' power facilities, offered its work
ers both an increase in annual raises and the
right to participate in union-related activi
ties. We applaud General Electric for bring
ing income parity to the campus and for giv
ing its workers rights they deserve.
Prior to the finalization of the new four
year contract on Friday, a pay differential
separated those workers formally em
ployed by the University and those em
ployees subtracted by the University
namely, Cardinal Cogen employees. On av
erage, Stanford facilities workers have
earned more than their Cardinal Cogen
counterparts and have received a greater
number of vacation pays per year, accord
ing to officials.
Moreover, the old contract prohibited
Cardinal Cogen employees from taking
part in union-related activities. Cardinal
Cogen employees' right to free speech were
essentially silenced by their contract with
General Electric, as was their right to dis
tribute pamphlets and to picket better
working conditions.
The final contract will bring Cardinal
Cogen workers closer to their peers em

ployed by the University. Cardinal Cogen
workers successfully lobbied for a four
year contract that granted them a four
percent increase during the first year of
the contract and a three percent increase
during the following three years. General
Electric has also offered its workers mon
etary incentives for superior performance
during the final three years of the con
tract.
Perhaps more importantly, Cardinal
Cogen workers won the right to partici
pate in union-related activities in the con
tract. General Electric agreed to permit
workers to unionize, provided that such
activity does not disparage General Elec
tric. Prior to the signing of this new con
tract, Cardinal Cogen workers were at a
disadvantage when faced with the
prospect of inequitable treatment by Gen
eral Electric; they were essentially prohib
ited from publicizing their experiences as
employees of the company.
The right to unionize is a fundamental
prerogative of workers in the developed
world. General Electric should be lauded
for its renewed commitment to Cardinal
Cogen workers and its shift in policy to
ward these employees. Cardinal Cogen
workers comprise a necessary element of
the Stanford community, and they ought to
be treated as such.
