## NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER Aussies and the life of the party 
### 
Ask your average Stanford
student how many times a
week she or he goes out to
party, and you're likely to
get an answer of about one or two
days a week. While you'll definitely
get the wild frat boy or über-social
chick who is out and about every
Thursday thru Sunday getting abso
lutely trashed, our average Stan
fordite is more likely to take things
relatively moderately. Homework,
sports, extra-curricular activities,
exams all of these take a lot of
time. At Stanford, we like to lots of
things, and we like to do them well.
Hence the less-than-fantastic party
scene on the Farm.

Here in Oz land, we've definite
ly been busy; the classes have been
great, but intense. Although we
rarely have homework or reading,
there are days when we have class
or fieldwork from 8 a.m. straight
to dinner, with a "fun" after-din
ner lecture that sometimes awaits
us after we finish our dessert. We
try to stay positive, always laugh
ing and joking about our busy,
ever-changing schedule, but there
are bound to be some days when it
gets to you. As my good friend
Molly Palmer would put it, "Why
have beer when you can have lec
ture?"

In our sparse free time, however,
our group has certainly proved to our
Aussie mates that we know how to
party. In a country where the drink
ing age is a mere 18 years old (didn't

I say earlier that
our culture had a
lot to learn from
the Australians?),
we've decided to
take part in full
cultural immer
sion. Many of Syd
ney's clubs and
bars were graced
with our presence
this past week as
we made the

rounds, finding the coolest places
and then embarrassingly realizing
that we could only afford half of the
cover charge before slinking away to
a more realistic spot.
After spending days in the rain
forest where playing cards or word
games were pretty much the only
night activities available after 9
p.m., we certainly felt we were enti
tled to a little party time when we hit
one of Australia's most beautiful
and exciting cities but things got
crazy, I would even dare say, a tad
excessive. Shall I paint you a picture
of our Halloween night here in Syd
ney? At 10 p.m., we were all decked
out in whatever costumes we could
scrounge up from vintage-clothing
shops and a dose of creativity. We
were staying in one house owned by
a hostel, which had at most only two
toilets. There were heads hanging
over those four ceramic fixtures as
the clock struck midnight on Old
Hallows Eve, and our group did not
look too chipper on the first day of

November.
It might have been a case of re
pressed madness: Having such a re
stricted schedule, where nearly every
minute of the day is planned out, is
slowly wreaking havoc on the control
freaks that we are. Thus, when we're
let loose, we go absolutely wild. The
same type of thing happens back on
the home campus: When students are
overworked or overscheduled, they
also overdo the partying. Hence the
unofficial Stanford motto: work hard,
play hard, party hard. Maybe that's
why the quarter system was put in
place to allow Stanford students to
take a break in between each intense
set of 10 weeks. It isn't healthy, nor is
it sustainable. I guess it is just one of
those things we all do when young,
"sowing our wild oats" and every
thing. There's absolutely nothing
wrong with having a good time, but
there's nothing good about excess
partying either.

I'll know we'll all come back with
plenty of memories from our experi
ences in the classroom and in the
"field" (learning about every aspect
of Australian culture) I just hope
we all make it back alive, or at least
with enough energy to make it
through winter quarter.

hard, party hard culture at Stanford?
