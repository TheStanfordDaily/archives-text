Censorship isn't the answer

To those who argue that The
Daily should not have printed the
ads paid for and designed by cam
pustruth.org I ask the following
question: Is censorship the answer?
The Daily has done this campus a
favor by publishing a view that is not
popular among students here. I find
it hard to believe that The Daily did
so out of any political motive, but
perhaps out of the long lost journal
istic desire to let its readers form
their own opinion and decide for
themselves which side makes more
sense. I further applaud The Daily
for publishing the letters it received
from those readers who disagreed
with The Daily's obligation to pub
lish the ad, as The Daily could just as
easily decided not to print those.
It will be a sad day when The
Daily does not print an ad just be
cause it disagrees with it. If people
have issues with the content of the

ad, they should use their letters to
the editor to disagree with the ad it
self, not The Daily. The Daily is sim
ply a vehicle of expression for any
body who seeks to express a view. I,
for one, am thankful that The Daily
upheld its obligation.

Daily's policy reasonable

I would simply like to register my
approval and support of The Daily's
running of Campus Truth ads, on the
grounds that they are not offensive
(as claimed by some) and that the
Daily's policy is reasonable.

Students should boycott The Daily
In the past few weeks, The Daily

has caused outcry by printing ad
vertisements for campustruth
which, though they apparently
don't specifically contravene The
Daily's standards (according to
The Daily's editor), link to a Web
site inciting hatred against Pales
tinians.
The Daily is refusing to stop run
ning these advertisements since they
are making money off them. These
ads will be run until Nov. 21.
If you, like me, are disgusted by
this policy, then why not refuse to
read The Daily until Nov. 22.
Please note that I don't condone
other, more effective, actions such as
tearing off the back page of any
Daily you come across (to remove
this offensive advertisement), or
throwing any copies of The Daily
straight mto recycling
