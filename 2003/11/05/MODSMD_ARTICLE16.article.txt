## Welcome to the Wonderful World of Nike

one's spirit. The location tells the persona
on the arm, where's the party? On the face,
slowly back away. On the lower back, quickly
approach.
Last Tuesday, I pulled up next to a Lance
Armstrong figure at a stop sign on Campus
Drive. After taking a good look at his Can
nondale racer, my gaze fell upon the black
Nike Swoosh ingrained into his left calf. A
black Nike Swoosh. Now I'd seen everything
from Mickey Mouse to flaming skulls inked
onto the human body, but this was a first.
Was it some sort of sick corporate joke,
that all Nike employees were branded with
the corporate logo, their work hours logged
by a scanning of the swoosh ,

like a barcode at each en
trance and exit of a Nike fac
tory? The cyclist couldn't
have been one of the com
pany's latest laboratory cre
ations
But then again, it
wouldn't be out of the Nike
realm. They've swooshed
sneakers, backpacks, swim-

suits, ski jackets, notebooks,
sunglasses and mp3 players. You name it, it's
been swooshed. Nike designs the shoes for the
U.S. Bobsled Team. Nike manufactures shoes
for the skydivers who strap snowboards on
their feet. Nike hosts basketball tournaments,
baseball showcases, golf tours, swim meets
and football camps.
The swoosh rules our lives. It's slapped it
self on everything. Count the swooshes you
see today. Be diligent. It's no mistake spotting
40 or 50 in an afternoon.

A company which started out making road
shoes for Forrest Gump-esque die hard run
ners has turned into a multi-billion dollar
global industry. But passing on the merger
habits of big business, Nike has instead fo
cused on the buyout and has subsequently
spread its logo across the sporting world. In
1998, Nike bought Bauer hockey equipment,
and though the New Hampshire-based com
pany still remains Bauer, most of the products
are inked with the swoosh. Nike's buyout of
Cole Haan casual wear spurred the majority
of its golf line.
Nike approaches the sports world as scien
tists and engineers, critically researching, de
veloping and testing the materials that go into
its products. The most recent company break
through, Nike Shox, was a project 16 years in
the making, inspired by the 1980s innovation
of springy rubber running tracks. The original
Shox featured 27 patents, retailed for $149.99
and couldn't be kept on the shelves.
About the same time, Nike's main com
petitor, Adidas, came out with a new line of
shoes featuring the Climax foot cooling sys
tem. Both the Nike and Adidas lines sold with
great success, as the "newest big thing" always
seems to sell.
When Nike came out with watches and
sunglasses, Adidas came out with cologne.
When Adidas took golf by storm, Nike had
just signed Tiger Woods onto its team. Nike
made Jordan in the 1980s. When Adidas
began to do the same with Tracy McGrady,
Nike signed Lebron James, outbidding Adi
das and Reebok and handing $9O million to a
player who had yet to score an NBA free
throw. Of course, the swoosh and triple stripe
donned every company product.
It's not like there's a financial need for all
this. Both companies pull in billions of dollars
per year. Nike currently has a little over 500
employees. Really. All the clothes, the shoe
soles, the watches, come to the United States
from sub-contracted companies overseas, get
swooshed and then hit stores. But in branding
herds of products Nike has claimed an increas
ingly greater part of the sportsman's world.
Why? Because it's all in the logo. There's a
lifestyle, a level of excellence, a personifica
tion that the swoosh has taken on. We're not
buying a pair of shoes or gym shorts but a
standard. Michael Jordan, Barry Sanders,
Derek Jeter, Agassi, Lebron. When we buy
Nike we're buying the winner, the class, the
life, the superhuman. When our team is
swooshed out, it means something. And for
the thousands of college and high school
teams Nike now sponsors, the swoosh means
something.
But it now means more for Nike than it does
for the sportsman. For every shoe it turns out
or team it sponsors, the logo further covers the
globe. The separate entities of the good and the
person have converged into a single resulting
product: the branded athlete. The swoosh on
notebooks, underwear, casual wear and athlet
ic wear: It encompasses the entire being. The
cyclist with the branded calf was merely a dis
play of this encompassment. The logo athletes
once helped Nike manufacture globally now
globally manufactures the athlete.

Bret Bechis is a junior economics major. He
doesn't boast a swoosh on his calf but he does
occasionally wear the undies. You can e-mail

black Nike Swoosh. Now I'd seen everything
from Mickey Mouse to flaming skulls inked
onto the human body, but this was a first.
Was it some sort of sick corporate joke,
that all Nike employees were branded with
the corporate logo, their work hours logged
by a scanning of the swoosh ,

like a barcode at each en
trance and exit of a Nike fac
tory? The cyclist couldn't
have been one of the com
pany's latest laboratory cre
ations
But then again, it
wouldn't be out of the Nike
realm. They've swooshed
sneakers, backpacks, swim-

suits, ski jackets, notebooks,
sunglasses and mp3 players. You name it, it's
been swooshed. Nike designs the shoes for the
U.S. Bobsled Team. Nike manufactures shoes
for the skydivers who strap snowboards on
their feet. Nike hosts basketball tournaments,
baseball showcases, golf tours, swim meets
and football camps.
The swoosh rules our lives. It's slapped it
self on everything. Count the swooshes you
see today. Be diligent. It's no mistake spotting
40 or 50 in an afternoon.

A company which started out making road
shoes for Forrest Gump-esque die hard run
ners has turned into a multi-billion dollar
global industry. But passing on the merger
habits of big business, Nike has instead fo
cused on the buyout and has subsequently
spread its logo across the sporting world. In
1998, Nike bought Bauer hockey equipment,
and though the New Hampshire-based com
pany still remains Bauer, most of the products
are inked with the swoosh. Nike's buyout of
Cole Haan casual wear spurred the majority
of its golf line.
Nike approaches the sports world as scien
tists and engineers, critically researching, de
veloping and testing the materials that go into
its products. The most recent company break
through, Nike Shox, was a project 16 years in
the making, inspired by the 1980s innovation
of springy rubber running tracks. The original
Shox featured 27 patents, retailed for $149.99
and couldn't be kept on the shelves.
About the same time, Nike's main com
petitor, Adidas, came out with a new line of
shoes featuring the Climax foot cooling sys
tem. Both the Nike and Adidas lines sold with
great success, as the "newest big thing" always
seems to sell.
When Nike came out with watches and
sunglasses, Adidas came out with cologne.
When Adidas took golf by storm, Nike had
just signed Tiger Woods onto its team. Nike
made Jordan in the 1980s. When Adidas
began to do the same with Tracy McGrady,
Nike signed Lebron James, outbidding Adi
das and Reebok and handing $9O million to a
player who had yet to score an NBA free
throw. Of course, the swoosh and triple stripe
donned every company product.
It's not like there's a financial need for all
this. Both companies pull in billions of dollars
per year. Nike currently has a little over 500
employees. Really. All the clothes, the shoe
soles, the watches, come to the United States
from sub-contracted companies overseas, get
swooshed and then hit stores. But in branding
herds of products Nike has claimed an increas
ingly greater part of the sportsman's world.
Why? Because it's all in the logo. There's a
lifestyle, a level of excellence, a personifica
tion that the swoosh has taken on. We're not
buying a pair of shoes or gym shorts but a
standard. Michael Jordan, Barry Sanders,
Derek Jeter, Agassi, Lebron. When we buy
Nike we're buying the winner, the class, the
life, the superhuman. When our team is
swooshed out, it means something. And for
the thousands of college and high school
teams Nike now sponsors, the swoosh means
something.
But it now means more for Nike than it does
for the sportsman. For every shoe it turns out
or team it sponsors, the logo further covers the
globe. The separate entities of the good and the
person have converged into a single resulting
product: the branded athlete. The swoosh on
notebooks, underwear, casual wear and athlet
ic wear: It encompasses the entire being. The
cyclist with the branded calf was merely a dis
play of this encompassment. The logo athletes
once helped Nike manufacture globally now
globally manufactures the athlete.

doesn't boast a swoosh on his calf but he does
occasionally wear the undies. You can e-mail
