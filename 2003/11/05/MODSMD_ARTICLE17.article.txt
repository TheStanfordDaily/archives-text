# Trojans, Bruins lead Pac-10
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's hard-fought 21-14 upset of
UCLA highlighted Saturday's play in the
Pacific 10 Conference, as every other game
was decided by 27 or more points.
In what was supposed to be the Pac-10
matchup of the year, then-No. 3 Southern
California ended up blowing out then-No. 6
Washington State, 43-16.
In other action, California exploded for a
52-23 win over Arizona State, Washington
brought Oregon back down to earth, 43-10,
and Oregon State got back on track, as
teams so often do, with a laugher against
Arizona, 52-23.
With its home victory, the Cardinal (3-4,
1-4) picked up its first Pac-10 win since Oct.
19, 2002, when it beat who else Ari
zona. For the Bruins (6-3,4-1), it was an un
affordable letdown which, given UCLA's
brutal November schedule, effectively ends
its chances of going to the Rose Bowl. The
Bruins host Oregon and play at USC and at
Washington State in the final weeks, and
would probably need to beat all three to
make the Rose Bowl.

USC (8-1, 4-1), which would play in the
national championship game if the season
ended today, according to the latest Bowl
Championship Series standings, did nothing
to call its high ranking into question against
the Cougars. Washington State (7-2, 4-1)
dropped to No. 12 in the Associated Press
poll after the loss, and USC jumped to No. 2
in the nation by virtue of its win.
USC stayed a step ahead of the Cougars
throughout the game, thanks to big play
after big play. Whether it was Matt Leinart's
55-yard scoring strike to Steve Smith, true
freshman LenDale White's 66-yard touch
down run or Hershel Dennis' 24-yard rush
ing score, the Trojans kept hitting the
Cougars while they were down.
Washington State did get 291 yards pass
ing from Matt Kegel, but Jonathan Smith
managed just 24 yards on the ground as the
Cougar attack was unable to stretch the
field.
In Tempe, Ariz., Cal quarterback Aaron
Rodgers was sizzling, completing 17-of-22
passes for 307 yards, three touchdowns and
no interceptions. Adimchinobe Echeman
du, with 128 yards rushing, became the 10th
Golden Bear to ever break 1,000 yards rush

ing in a season. Cal (5-5,3-2) scored 30 unan
swered points after Arizona State (4-5,1-4)
closed the gap to 21-17 on Loren Wade's 2-
yard touchdown early in the second quarter.
Arizona State's Andrew Walter com
pleted just 11-of-26 passes for 170 yards,
while Wade led the ground game with 109
yards rushing.
Tyler Frederickson kicked six extra
points and made all three of his field-goal at
tempts, including a 47-yarder, for the Bears.
Oregon, one week after shutting out
Stanford 35-0, was shut out 35-0 nothing in
the second half by Washington. The Ducks
jumped out to a 10-0 first-quarter lead, as
Kellen Clemens found Demetrius Williams
for an 85-yard score, but bogged down after
that. The usually explosive Terrence White
head managed just 62 yards on the ground
for the Ducks.
Washington's QB Casey Paus came in
after starting quarterback Cody Pickett was
sidelined in the second quarter, and threw
for 117 yards and two touchdowns on just
eight pass attempts. Tailbacks Kenny James
and Shelton Sampson, both redshirt fresh
men, did the rest of the work.
Sampson needed just six carries to rack

up 134 yards, thanks to a 77-yard run in the
fourth quarter, while James totaled 108
yards on 18 carries, including a 56-yard
jaunt.
Derek Anderson threw for three touch
downs, including one to Steven Jackson,
who rushed for three scores of his own, as
the Beavers (6-3,3-2) breezed past the Wild
cats, stopping a two-game losing skid. Ari
zona (1-8,0-5) did not score in the first half
and totaled just 232 yards in its eighth
straight loss, leaving the team winless since
the midseason firing of John Mackovic.
Anderson threw for 308 yards, and Jack
son, the Pac-10's leading rusher, ran for 112
yards in his first career four-touchdown
game. True freshman Kris Heavner com
pleted 12-of-28 passes for 137 yards for the
beleaguered Wildcats, who did get 113 rush
ing yards and a score from Mike Bell.
This weekend, Stanford will try to be a bad
host to struggling Arizona State, UCLA
heads north to face Washington State in a
matchup of conference frontrunners, Arizona
will try to get something going against visiting
Washington and Cal travels to Oregon, where
both teams seek their sixth win and the bowl
eligibility that comes with it.

for 117 yards and two touchdowns on just
eight pass attempts. Tailbacks Kenny James
and Shelton Sampson, both redshirt fresh
men, did the rest of the work.
Sampson needed just six carries to rack

up 134 yards, thanks to a 77-yard run in the
fourth quarter, while James totaled 108
yards on 18 carries, including a 56-yard
jaunt.
Derek Anderson threw for three touch

Junior David Bergeron finds a hole in UCLA's offensive line in an attempt to get to quarterback Matt Moore. Bergeron recorded five total tackles (four solo) in the Cardinal's 21-14
victory over conference frontrunner UCLA. USC moved into prime position for a conference title with a blowout 43-16 over Washington State.
Stanford's hard-fought 21-14 upset of
UCLA highlighted Saturday's play in the
Pacific 10 Conference, as every other game
was decided by 27 or more points.
In what was supposed to be the Pac-10
matchup of the year, then-No. 3 Southern
California ended up blowing out then-No. 6
Washington State, 43-16.
In other action, California exploded for a
52-23 win over Arizona State, Washington
brought Oregon back down to earth, 43-10,
and Oregon State got back on track, as
teams so often do, with a laugher against
Arizona, 52-23.
With its home victory, the Cardinal (3-4,
1-4) picked up its first Pac-10 win since Oct.
19, 2002, when it beat who else Ari
zona. For the Bruins (6-3,4-1), it was an un
affordable letdown which, given UCLA's
brutal November schedule, effectively ends
its chances of going to the Rose Bowl. The
Bruins host Oregon and play at USC and at
Washington State in the final weeks, and
would probably need to beat all three to
make the Rose Bowl.

USC (8-1, 4-1), which would play in the
national championship game if the season
ended today, according to the latest Bowl
Championship Series standings, did nothing
to call its high ranking into question against
the Cougars. Washington State (7-2, 4-1)
dropped to No. 12 in the Associated Press
poll after the loss, and USC jumped to No. 2
in the nation by virtue of its win.
USC stayed a step ahead of the Cougars
throughout the game, thanks to big play
after big play. Whether it was Matt Leinart's
55-yard scoring strike to Steve Smith, true
freshman LenDale White's 66-yard touch
down run or Hershel Dennis' 24-yard rush
ing score, the Trojans kept hitting the
Cougars while they were down.
Washington State did get 291 yards pass
ing from Matt Kegel, but Jonathan Smith
managed just 24 yards on the ground as the
Cougar attack was unable to stretch the
field.
In Tempe, Ariz., Cal quarterback Aaron
Rodgers was sizzling, completing 17-of-22
passes for 307 yards, three touchdowns and
no interceptions. Adimchinobe Echeman
du, with 128 yards rushing, became the 10th
Golden Bear to ever break 1,000 yards rush

ing in a season. Cal (5-5,3-2) scored 30 unan
swered points after Arizona State (4-5,1-4)
closed the gap to 21-17 on Loren Wade's 2-
yard touchdown early in the second quarter.
Arizona State's Andrew Walter com
pleted just 11-of-26 passes for 170 yards,
while Wade led the ground game with 109
yards rushing.
Tyler Frederickson kicked six extra
points and made all three of his field-goal at
tempts, including a 47-yarder, for the Bears.
Oregon, one week after shutting out
Stanford 35-0, was shut out 35-0 nothing in
the second half by Washington. The Ducks
jumped out to a 10-0 first-quarter lead, as
Kellen Clemens found Demetrius Williams
for an 85-yard score, but bogged down after
that. The usually explosive Terrence White
head managed just 62 yards on the ground
for the Ducks.
Washington's QB Casey Paus came in
after starting quarterback Cody Pickett was
sidelined in the second quarter, and threw
for 117 yards and two touchdowns on just
eight pass attempts. Tailbacks Kenny James
and Shelton Sampson, both redshirt fresh
men, did the rest of the work.
Sampson needed just six carries to rack

up 134 yards, thanks to a 77-yard run in the
fourth quarter, while James totaled 108
yards on 18 carries, including a 56-yard
jaunt.
Derek Anderson threw for three touch
downs, including one to Steven Jackson,
who rushed for three scores of his own, as
the Beavers (6-3,3-2) breezed past the Wild
cats, stopping a two-game losing skid. Ari
zona (1-8,0-5) did not score in the first half
and totaled just 232 yards in its eighth
straight loss, leaving the team winless since
the midseason firing of John Mackovic.
Anderson threw for 308 yards, and Jack
son, the Pac-10's leading rusher, ran for 112
