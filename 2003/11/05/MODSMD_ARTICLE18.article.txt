# Barnes, Barnikow to compete in Michigan
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For four consecutive years, No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis dominated the ITA National Indoor Championships in
Dallas, Texas, bringing home a title each year.
But that was 1998. Or 1999. Or ... you get the picture.
Along with the advancing chill, November 2003 brings a
more stringent outlook for the Cardinal at the Indoor Cham
pionships.
This year, Stanford is sending two lone representatives,
sophomore Alice Barnes and senior Lauren Barnikow to the
Nov. 6-9 tournament, now hosted by University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor.
Competitors usually qualify for the premiere indoor
event by reaching the finals at ITA Regional Champi
onships, held nationwide last month. Stanford's own Taube
Family Tennis Stadium was the battleground for Northwest
Regional play, which proved unkind to the Cardinal.
Fourth-seeded Barnes fell unexpectedly in the third
round of Regionals to Sasha Podkolzina of California, 6-2,6-
2. The Bears' breakout freshman also pummeled fifth-seed
ed Barnikow in the quarterfinals, 6-3,6-1.
Despite their untimely Regionals losses, Barnes and
Barnikow have solid overall statistics on their side and re
ceived at-large bids for ITA competition.
Holding the No. 2 position on the Stanford team, tenth
ranked Barnikow dropped just six matches (16-6) in 2002
team play. She finished with a 9-6 record in individual season
piay.
Meanwhile, sixth-ranked Barnes went undefeated (25-0)
last season in dual matches and boasted an 11-3 individual
record.
Undaunted in the face of upcoming challenges at Ann
Arbor, the Cardinal is out for redemption.
"I think my performance at Regionals gave me an oppor
tunity to get more match play under my belt and hopefully
made me that much more tournament tough and ready to
compete this weekend," Barnikow said.
Barnes added, "I think it's a great opportunity. We get to
see the top players from Georgia and Florida when we've
had some time to get into [the season]."

The Cardinal has competed outside of its region just once
before in 2003, at the season debut ITA All-American
Championships in September, Stanford junior Erin Bur
dette upset Georgia's top-ranked, top-seeded Agata
Cioroch in the semifinals, 6-3,3-6,6-3.
"[The All-American] is more of a warm-up," Barnes said.
"This tournament will be a real test."
Stanford got off to a rocky start last year at the ITA, with
all four of its athletes falling in first-round play.

"We were a little bit shell-shocked," Barnes said. "We felt
we were letting down [Stanford's] reputation."
Putting forth a resilient effort, Barnes went on to clinch a
consolation bracket title, 6-3,2-6,6-3, from Villmarie Castel
lvi, formerly of Tennessee. Castellvi had defeated Barnikow
in consolation semifinals the previous day, 6-3,6-1.
To better prepare for this year's Indoor Championships,
the Cardinal has devoted much of its practice time to playing
