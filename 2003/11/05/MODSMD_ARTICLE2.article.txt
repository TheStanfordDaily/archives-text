# International students to pay fee for new database

The U.S. Department of Home
land Security is set to release draft reg
ulations this week that would require
each international student to pay a
one-time $lOO fee to cover the costs of
the Student and Exchange Visitor In
formation System, or Sevis the
database that the department uses to
track students. Asa Hutchinson, a sec
retary of border and transportation
security at the department, an
nounced last week that the fee would
raise more than $3O million for Sevis.
College officials responded to the
news with both support and skepti
cism.
"Without knowing the details of
the regulations, it is difficult to judge
exactly how they will affect colleges,"
said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice pres
ident for government and public af
fairs at the American Council on Edu
cation. "The fee is larger than what
the educational community had ex
pected," he added, "but understand

able because the Homeland Security
Department wants additional money
to protect the country from potential
terrorists who might misuse student
visas."
At Stanford, John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Cen
ter said, "I don't know yet what the of
ficial Stanford response to this will be.
There is no way around it, though.
When this idea first came up in 1996,
there was still some room to maneu
ver around it. After Sept. 11, it was a
done deal."
The fee would raise money for sys
tem maintenance and for additional
staff members to work with colleges.
It would also pay for efforts to make
sure that international students arrive
on campuses as promised, do not drop
out and meet the conditions of their
student visas.
"The charge is necessary because
the law that created Sevis promised
that fees, not federal appropriations,
would pay for its operating costs. The
$lOO fee is the maximum that Con

gress permitted and more than the $95
suggested in the current rules," Pear
son said, "and honestly, I was not sur
prised that it was $lOO. The regula
tions of Sevis laid down 'no more than
sloo' and I knew this day would ar
rive."
The former U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which over
saw Sevis and was folded into the
Homeland Security Department in
March, hired KPMG Consulting in
August 2002 to evaluate whether the
$95 fee it wanted to impose on stu
dents would cover the program's
costs. KPMG found that the charge
would be too high, considering that
the USA Patriot Act provided $36.8
million to pay for Sevis, an amount
that was not factored into the original
calculations. At the time, the consul
tants suggested a $54 fee for students
and exchange visitors such as profes
sors and visiting scholars. A $35 fee
would have applied to exchange visi
