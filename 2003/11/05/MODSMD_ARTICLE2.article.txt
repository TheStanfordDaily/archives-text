# International students to pay fee for new database
## 
### Priyanka Prathak-Narain 
The U.S. Department of Home
land Security is set to release draft reg
ulations this week that would require
each international student to pay a
one-time $lOO fee to cover the costs of
the Student and Exchange Visitor In
formation System, or Sevis the
database that the department uses to
track students. Asa Hutchinson, a sec
retary of border and transportation
security at the department, an
nounced last week that the fee would
raise more than $3O million for Sevis.
College officials responded to the
news with both support and skepti
cism.
"Without knowing the details of
the regulations, it is difficult to judge
exactly how they will affect colleges,"
said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice pres
ident for government and public af
fairs at the American Council on Edu
cation. "The fee is larger than what
the educational community had ex
pected," he added, "but understand

able because the Homeland Security
Department wants additional money
to protect the country from potential
terrorists who might misuse student
visas."
At Stanford, John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Cen
ter said, "I don't know yet what the of
ficial Stanford response to this will be.
There is no way around it, though.
When this idea first came up in 1996,
there was still some room to maneu
ver around it. After Sept. 11, it was a
done deal."
The fee would raise money for sys
tem maintenance and for additional
staff members to work with colleges.
It would also pay for efforts to make
sure that international students arrive
on campuses as promised, do not drop
out and meet the conditions of their
student visas.
"The charge is necessary because
the law that created Sevis promised
that fees, not federal appropriations,
would pay for its operating costs. The
$lOO fee is the maximum that Con

gress permitted and more than the $95
suggested in the current rules," Pear
son said, "and honestly, I was not sur
prised that it was $lOO. The regula
tions of Sevis laid down 'no more than
sloo' and I knew this day would ar
rive."
The former U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which over
saw Sevis and was folded into the
Homeland Security Department in
March, hired KPMG Consulting in
August 2002 to evaluate whether the
$95 fee it wanted to impose on stu
dents would cover the program's
costs. KPMG found that the charge
would be too high, considering that
the USA Patriot Act provided $36.8
million to pay for Sevis, an amount
that was not factored into the original
calculations. At the time, the consul
tants suggested a $54 fee for students
and exchange visitors such as profes
sors and visiting scholars. A $35 fee
would have applied to exchange visi
tors working as au pairs, camp coun
selors, and participants in summer
work / travel programs.
College officials say they are mys
tified and frustrated over the Home
land Security Department's decision
to push now for a fee at almost twice
the recommended level.
"Why do these fee studies if you're
going to throw them in the wastebas
ket?" complained Victor C. Johnson,
associate executive director of Nafsa:
Association of International Educa
tors.
Bill Strassberger, the department
spokesman, said, '"Hie KPMG study
chd not account for all of the activities
that the Sevis fee would have to sup
port. There are several missing activi
ties which they have not factored into
the fee assessment."
There is also a concern that a high
fee would be a barrier to internation
al students from poor countries. The
students already have to pay a $lOO
visa-processing fee to the Depart
ment of State and a visa-issuance fee
determined by their country of origin.
There are indications that this may
be a real concern. Since the terrorist
attacks, the government has received
fewer applications and granted fewer
student visas. From Oct. 1, 2002, to
Aug. 1, 2003, the State Department
received 270,405 applications for stu
dent visas and issued nearly 175,000.

That is roughly 57,000 fewer applica
tions received and 65,000 fewer visas
issued compared with the same peri
od two years earlier.
"It is a concern that Stanford
shares," Pearson said. "Over the past
few years, the number of new inter
national students has not declined,
but it has not gone up either, as the
trends were. Our concern at Stanford
is to minimize the impact of these
laws on the exchange of education
and minimize its impact on the
young."
The opinions on this proposal
have been varied. Over the next
month, as the Homeland Security
Department announces the proposed
rule and gives colleges 30 days to sug
gest changes, there are likely to be a
range of opinions.
But the opinion sharing session
may not really amount to much as the
department will make the changes it
deems necessary, according to the
Fee Proposal 102703-1. The govern
ment hopes to have the final regula
tion in place by this spring or, at the
latest, next fall.
"Stanford will be trying very hard
to avoid being responsible for fee col
lection," Pearson said. "In 1996, the
deadlock had been over whose re
sponsibility it will be over to collect
the fee. I don't think that issue is still
clear in the current proposal. We re
ally don't want the international stu
dent community to face administra
tive issues even after paying such a
steep fee which is likely to happen if
this issue is not clear."
