# In the midst of tough season, Willingham in hot water

(U-WIRE) SOUTH BEND, Ind.
How appropriate that Notre Dame
coach Tyrone Willingham made a ref
erence to watercraft in his post-game
conference against Florida State with
Navy coming to South Bend, Ind.,
Saturday.
"The first thing we have to do is get
a win this next weekend," Willingham

said. "We have to get our ship righted
and pointed in the right direction."
Everything seems to be heading
downhill rapidly for the Irish, and
suddenly fans don't think Willingham
seems like the man to turn around this
program like he did last year. But
that's not weakening his confidence in
the master plan.
"I don't think it's any question this
is one of the toughest spots I've ever
been in," Willingham said. "But at the

same time, I know what our goal is:
Our goal is to clearly build this pro
gram to be a great team. I still believe
that can happen. Sometimes, it's diffi
cult to see. I think we are pointed in
the right direction, and we will stay in
that direction."
While at Stanford, Willingham's
teams were very inconsistent from
year to year. He started his head
coaching career with the Cardinal in
1995 with back-to-back seven win sea

sons but followed those years with
five- and three-win years.
However, Willingham led Stan
ford to the Rose Bowl in 1999 after
that 3-8 season for the school's first
trip to Pasadena, Calif., in 28 years.
Then Stanford followed that year
with a disappointing 5-6 campaign be
fore Willingham's last year, where the
team went 9-3.
At Notre Dame, Willingham start
ed last year with the most wins by a

first-year coach in Irish history, but
followed the pattern of his past head
coaching career as the Irish are 2-6
this season.
But ask the players, and they
haven't lost faith in the man Alumni
Association Executive Director
Chuck Lennon calls the captain that
sails the ship on the "Sea of Green."
"How could you not believe in a
man like that? He's been driving us
the whole time, and I put this loss

completely on myself," Irish quarter
back Brady Quinn said.
With the Irish at 2-6, even winning
four straight games would not put
them in a bowl game since Notre
Dame doesn't accept bowl bids from
the lower-tier bowls.
Therefore, all this team has left is
to play for something that has become
very common on the mouths of
coaches and players once this season
went south pride.
