# Terman suffers from dry rot
## 
### DAVID HERBERT 
The Terman Engineering Build
ing is suffering from dry rot, a struc
tural deficiency that has led school
officials to begin drawing up plans
for a new facility.
The facility was built in the 19705,
but the wood that was used to build
much of its foundation was discov
ered to be afflicted with dry rot sev
eral years ago. The current con
struction at Terman is focused on
short-term structural upkeep of this
problem.
"It [dry rot] is being monitored
and repaired as necessary," said
Maggie Burgett, who is the project
manager for the current construc
tion at Terman.

Though still in the early stages of
development, the eventual plan to
deal with Terman's structural mal
adies will likely call for a new facili
ty to be built somewhere around the
Science and Engineering Quad.
"The School of Engineering has
long-term plans for a new center
that is scheduled to be open in
2010," said Burgett. "Planning for
the new center is very preliminary,"
she added.
Unlike the recent construction at
McCullough, where occupants were
forced to temporarily relocate while
construction was completed, the
School of Engineering will remain

at its current location until the new
building is finished.
"The current occupants will re
main in Terman until the new facili
ty is complete," Burgett said.
Terman will be demolished once
its tenants have been moved out. A
concern with this plan, as with any
demolition, is possible negative en
vironmental side effects. Low air
quality in the surrounding area is of
particular concern considering Ter

man's close proximity to Roble Hall
and Lagunita Court. School offi
cials, though, claim to have such sce
narios under control.
"We do a lot of demolitions as a
part of regular renovations," said
Associate Vice Provost for Environ
mental Health and Safety Larry
Gibbs. "For any building we demol
ish, there are a whole host of regula
tions we must follow, and Terman
will be no different."

Terman until a new location for the School of Engineering is built in
2010.
