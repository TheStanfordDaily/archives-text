# STUDENT OPINION

Amit Ganguli, doctoral candidate in engineering:
"I am ambivalent about this issue. While I am not sure
the extent to which it is justified, charging this to the
students, my larger concern is the precedent it sets.
Moreover, a reverse security concern also exists. How
safe is our data with the U.S. government? Can it be
misused? I mean, I don't know what stand to take."
Kelash Kumar, MBA, Class of 2005, national of
Pakistan: "Its silly. It doesn't make any sense to me be
cause the visa process takes six months anyway. To
add another database to the already existing one which
performs an identical function sounds very silly. The
INS is already in place doing exactly what this thing is
supposed to do. It just makes more problems for inter
national students to encounter."
Vish Narain, an MBA student from India, Class of
2004: "Just because they have the right to do it, doesn't
mean that they are right about doing it. I mean, look at
it like this: This is a security concern and the imple
mentation of this proposal would mean enhanced se
curity for the U.S. nationals and lower risk of terrorist

attacks. So, if this were so high on the priority of the
Congress, then the State should fund such a project in
stead of leveraging on international students; who
have no choice to cough up. I mean, I didn't ask for it,
so why should I pay for it?"
"To some extent I understand the security concern
and there are legitimate reasons why you may want to
do so and I don't see why one would want to object to
it," said Jerome Bertrand, a French national at the
business school, Class of 2004.
"From the perspective of the American people, I
think this initiative makes a lot of sense," said Federi
co Antoni. "The U.S. government has the duty to pro
tect its citizens and the right to fund some of its pro
gram with an 'international students tax'. As an inter
national student, I prefer having to pay a tax rather
than having the U.S. government limiting the number
of foreign student visas or putting quotas on universi
ties. The latter would have an undesirable impact in
American universities that have always valued bring
ing diversity to their campuses."
