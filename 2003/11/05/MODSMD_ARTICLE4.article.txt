# Adviser to Iraq speaks at Kresge
## 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Noah Feldman, assistant professor of law at
New York University, said that he wanted to
give Stanford students an "opportunity to hear
some angle [they] wouldn't normally get in the
classroom" at a talk last night at Kresge Audi
torium.
His talk, titled "Islamic Democracy: The Fu
ture of Iraq," was sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker Bureau's and was co-sponsored by
ISIS.
Feldman, a former Rhodes scholar, recent
adviser to the Iraqi constitutional process and
the author of "After Jihad: America and the
Struggle for Islamic Democracy," said that he
wanted to deliver a speech that wasn't academic
to an academic institution.
Similarly Feldman said that his original inter
est in Iraq was academic, which, according to the
ASSU Speakers Bureau, helped Feldman be
come "the leader in Islamic thought." Since tak
ing an academic route toward the Middle East as
both an author and scholar, however, Feldman
has been named as the senior adviser for Consti
tutional Law in Iraq and currently works as an in
dependent consultant to the Iraqi government.
"I stepped out of my government job to ad
vise both independently and directly, and [lraqi
officials] could decide whether or not to take my
advice without any governmental pressure,"
Feldman said.
The main issue that Feldman tried to get
across in his guest speech was that in the after
math of the invasion of Iraq, in order to help the
Iraqi government establish a stable democracy,
the United States must confer to the Iraqi gov
ernment an opportunity for self-government.
"For a democracy to be effective it has to be
established by people who choose the way they
want to be governed," Feldman said. "It won't
be any good if it appears to come or does come
from outsiders."
In general, Feldman said he believed that
constituents of Iraq support a democratic gov
ernment and thus the United States should do
nothing but aid them in establishing their own
democratic government.
"The overwhelming majority of Iraqis have

taken the position that they are committed to
democracy," Feldman said. "The model is worth
fighting for because it is the model that most
Iraqis want."
Feldman's responses to both the invasion of
Iraq and the recent violent uprisings in Iraq,
such as the recent shooting down of an Ameri
can helicopter, further demonstrated his belief
that the United States should "rapidly transfer
authority to (the) Iraqis to show that the U.S. is
capable of doing the right thing."
Feldman argued that the benefit of invading
Iraq was that it gave Iraq an opportunity to form
its own democratic government in the absence
of an autocracy, and Feldman believes that the
way to quell current violent acts is by allowing
"other Iraqis" to utilize military positions.
Student reaction to the speech was positive.
"We thought it was a very relevant and time
ly issue especially when people are concerned
where we are headed with Iraq," said Josh
Meltzer, Community Relations Officer for the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
"Feldman has intimate knowledge of the
Middle East and is a constitutional scholar;
the combination of these things give us a
unique insight in the development of Iraq,"
Meltzer said. "It's an interesting current
events program that gets the Stanford com
munity interested in what's going on in Iraq."
Stanford sophomore Eh Lazarus, a host of
"Things We Want to Tell You," a KZSU radio
program that gives news from campus and from
around the world, found that the program did
give him a unique perspective of what is going
on in the Middle-East.
"It was very interesting particularly be
cause [Feldman has been] working not only
for the U.S. government but the Iraqi coun
cil," Lazarus said, "it was encouraging from
that insider's perspective that building a con
stitution in Iraq had a better than 50 percent
chance of succeeding."
Such optimism was evident in Feldman's
closing words.
"We have an ethical responsibility to leave
people we have conquered an opportunity to
govern themselves ... I think that is a value for
democracy and I think it is a value worth fight
ing for," Feldman said.
