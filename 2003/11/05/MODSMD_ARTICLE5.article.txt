# Money at Stanford
## Examining subcontracting on the Farm 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Editor's note: This story is the third in a week-long series ex
amining the role of money in the lives of people who work,
live and study at Stanford.

Fidel Cortez works for ABM Janitorial, the company
the University has contracted to clean the buildings in the
Quad every night. He is 24 years old and lives in East Palo
Alto with his five brothers, three sisters and his parents. He
has been working at Stanford for two years and seven
months and he is paid $10.40 an hour. He says that he would
be paid more if he spoke English or worked directly for the
University. His older brother, Atoniel, is also a janitor for
ABM Janitorial.
In recent years, as Stanford has followed a nationwide
trend toward temporary and subcontracted labor, many
workers like Atoniel have had to deal with being paid less
than directly hired workers.
"Subcontracting has really been the largest force under
cutting workers today," said former SLAC member
Meghana Reddy to The Daily last year. "Twenty percent of
[Stanford] workers are currently subcontracted, and with
subcontracting, workers aren't trained properly, are called
one day to work then called the next day and told not to
come in."

Reddy pointed out that subcontracted workers earn less
than directly hired employees, receive fewer benefits and
often have problems organizing a union.
University officials say they have no way of knowing
how many subcontracted workers are employed at Stan
ford because its agreements with contracted companies do
not specify how many workers are hired; instead, the con
tractor determines the number of employees that will be
used to perform the work.
Work is contracted out to companies because it is eco
nomically practical for the University according to a Uni
versity spokesperson. Contracting companies typically ful
fill service needs, such as janitorial work or construction,
said Susan Hoerger, director of Employee and Labor Re
lations.

Wage parity

Stanford Labor Action Coalition argues that the reason
that the subcontracted labor is cheaper is because contract
ing companies pay their workers lower wages than directly
hired workers.
Senior Leticia Ramirez, a SLAC member, said that the
biggest problem the coalition has with subcontracting is the
issue of wage parity.

"Subcontracted workers who do the same type of work
as those who are directly hired by the University are paid $2
to $3 less per hour," Ramirez said.
The University does require that contractors meet the
minimum standards of the "Living Wage and Benefit
Guidelines for Stanford Contractors." Through these
guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access
to healthcare benefits and compensated time off for work
ers.

The initial living wage is set at a minimum of $lO.lO per
hour if health benefits are provided and $11.35 if no health
benefits are provided.
The guidelines apply only to subcontracted workers
who are not unionized, not directly hired or temporary
workers.

But SLAC and SEIU Local 715, the labor union that
represents directly hired workers on campus, say that the
policy excludes many of the lowest paid workers on campus
and undercuts employees who are currently paid higher
than the living wage.
In addition, they argue that the $lO.lO living wage
calculated by Stanford is less than the $13.68 wage calcu
lated by Santa Clara County.
