# Money at Stanford
## Examining subcontracting on the Farm 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Editor's note: This story is the third in a week-long series ex
amining the role of money in the lives of people who work,
live and study at Stanford.

Fidel Cortez works for ABM Janitorial, the company
the University has contracted to clean the buildings in the
Quad every night. He is 24 years old and lives in East Palo
Alto with his five brothers, three sisters and his parents. He
has been working at Stanford for two years and seven
months and he is paid $10.40 an hour. He says that he would
be paid more if he spoke English or worked directly for the
University. His older brother, Atoniel, is also a janitor for
ABM Janitorial.
In recent years, as Stanford has followed a nationwide
trend toward temporary and subcontracted labor, many
workers like Atoniel have had to deal with being paid less
than directly hired workers.
"Subcontracting has really been the largest force under
cutting workers today," said former SLAC member
Meghana Reddy to The Daily last year. "Twenty percent of
[Stanford] workers are currently subcontracted, and with
subcontracting, workers aren't trained properly, are called
one day to work then called the next day and told not to
come in."

Reddy pointed out that subcontracted workers earn less
than directly hired employees, receive fewer benefits and
often have problems organizing a union.
University officials say they have no way of knowing
how many subcontracted workers are employed at Stan
ford because its agreements with contracted companies do
not specify how many workers are hired; instead, the con
tractor determines the number of employees that will be
used to perform the work.
Work is contracted out to companies because it is eco
nomically practical for the University according to a Uni
versity spokesperson. Contracting companies typically ful
fill service needs, such as janitorial work or construction,
said Susan Hoerger, director of Employee and Labor Re
lations.

Wage parity

Stanford Labor Action Coalition argues that the reason
that the subcontracted labor is cheaper is because contract
ing companies pay their workers lower wages than directly
hired workers.
Senior Leticia Ramirez, a SLAC member, said that the
biggest problem the coalition has with subcontracting is the
issue of wage parity.

"Subcontracted workers who do the same type of work
as those who are directly hired by the University are paid $2
to $3 less per hour," Ramirez said.
The University does require that contractors meet the
minimum standards of the "Living Wage and Benefit
Guidelines for Stanford Contractors." Through these
guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access
to healthcare benefits and compensated time off for work
ers.

The initial living wage is set at a minimum of $lO.lO per
hour if health benefits are provided and $11.35 if no health
benefits are provided.
The guidelines apply only to subcontracted workers
who are not unionized, not directly hired or temporary
workers.

But SLAC and SEIU Local 715, the labor union that
represents directly hired workers on campus, say that the
policy excludes many of the lowest paid workers on campus
and undercuts employees who are currently paid higher
than the living wage.
In addition, they argue that the $lO.lO living wage
calculated by Stanford is less than the $13.68 wage calcu
lated by Santa Clara County.

Larry Quinn has worked 27 years
for Cardinal Cogen, the power plant
on campus that the University has
contracted out to General Electric in
1987. Just this past week the 16 union
ized workers were able to negotiate a
favorable contract with General Elec
tric. Quinn expressed his belief that all
workers on the campus should be
treated the same.
"There are workers who are direct
ly hired by the University who are
earning higher wages than us even
though we are doing equivalent jobs,"
Quinn said. "Why shouldn't we be
paid the same wages for providing the
same services for the same cus
tomer?"
Kennedy Helm, a negotiator from
SEIU 715, said he believes General
Electric took a step in the right direc
tion with the new four-year contract.
"On the last day of negotiations,
the representative from G.E. had out a
copy of the contract Stanford uses to
hire its workers, and was referring to
it," Helm said.
The new four-year contract in
creased workers' wages over the next
four years and also gave them more
union rights.
Roxana Rivera, a representative

from SEIU Local 715, said that her or
ganization is not seeking to end sub
contracting altogether, but rather fight
for the rights of the workers.
"We can not stop subcontracting,
because that's the trend, to save
money and subcontract out," Rivera
said. "What we feel is that the solution
itself is that Stanford should set forth
policy in the bidding process that calls
for contracting companies to pay liv
ing wages, offer benefits, access to
health care and give workers the right
to organize."

Overstepping boundaries?

A Stanford spokesman said that
there is a boundary that exists in the
relationship between the University
and the contractors and the relation
ship between the contractor and its
employees.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Gordon Earle said, "The University is
not involved in the employment rela
tionship between contractors and their
employers, and those relationships
have not created issues of contention
between Stanford and its contractors."
Still, the University has taken steps
in recent months toward being more
involved in issues faced by all campus
workers.
Last spring quarter, six students
fasted in support of a process to bring
about a code of conduct that would
cover all workers in the Stanford com

munity. As a result of the fast Univer
sity President John Hennessy created
a joint presidential committee on
labor this fall that will make recom
mendations to the president on Uni
versity labor practices.
Earle said that the committee will be
co-chaired by Diane Peck, executive di
rector of human resources, and be com
posed of students, staff members and
administrators with relevant experi
ence. That committee will submit its rec
ommendations directly to Hennessy.
Some of the issues the committee
will examine inckude policies regard
ing temporary employees and the exist
ing living wage. The committee will
also explore subcontracting, educa
tional opportunities for employees,,
mechanisms to review and ensure com
pliance with the University's employ
ment policies and mechanisms de
signed to ensure compliance with legal
rights of employees and the University
in connection with union organization.
"The formation of this committee
represents a continued commitment
on the part of Stanford to provide
leadership on workplace issues," Hen
nessy said.
Earle said that Hennessy will take the
findings and recommendations of the
committee into serious consideration.
"The University has put in a great
deal of time and effort into this impor
tant commission," Earle said. "How
ever, all final decisions on the issue will
be made by President Hennessy."

"We can not stop subcontracting,
because that's the trend, to save
money and subcontract out," Rivera
said. "What we feel is that the solution
itself is that Stanford should set forth
policy in the bidding process that calls
for contracting companies to pay liv
ing wages, offer benefits, access to
health care and give workers the right
to organize."

Overstepping boundaries?

A Stanford spokesman said that
there is a boundary that exists in the
relationship between the University
and the contractors and the relation
ship between the contractor and its
employees.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Gordon Earle said, "The University is
not involved in the employment rela
tionship between contractors and their
employers, and those relationships
have not created issues of contention
between Stanford and its contractors."
Still, the University has taken steps
in recent months toward being more
involved in issues faced by all campus
workers.
Last spring quarter, six students
fasted in support of a process to bring
about a code of conduct that would
cover all workers in the Stanford com

munity. As a result of the fast Univer
sity President John Hennessy created
a joint presidential committee on
labor this fall that will make recom
mendations to the president on Uni
versity labor practices.
Earle said that the committee will be
co-chaired by Diane Peck, executive di
rector of human resources, and be com
posed of students, staff members and
administrators with relevant experi
ence. That committee will submit its rec
ommendations directly to Hennessy.
Some of the issues the committee
will examine inckude policies regard
ing temporary employees and the exist
ing living wage. The committee will
also explore subcontracting, educa
tional opportunities for employees,,
mechanisms to review and ensure com
pliance with the University's employ
ment policies and mechanisms de
signed to ensure compliance with legal
rights of employees and the University
in connection with union organization.
"The formation of this committee
represents a continued commitment
on the part of Stanford to provide
leadership on workplace issues," Hen
nessy said.
Earle said that Hennessy will take the
findings and recommendations of the
committee into serious consideration.
"The University has put in a great
deal of time and effort into this impor
tant commission," Earle said. "How
ever, all final decisions on the issue will
be made by President Hennessy."

Fidel Cortez works for ABM Janitorial, the company
the University has contracted to clean the buildings in the
Quad every night. He is 24 years old and lives in East Palo
Alto with his five brothers, three sisters and his parents. He
has been working at Stanford for two years and seven
months and he is paid $10.40 an hour. He says that he would
be paid more if he spoke English or worked directly for the
University. His older brother, Atoniel, is also a janitor for
ABM Janitorial.
In recent years, as Stanford has followed a nationwide
trend toward temporary and subcontracted labor, many
workers like Atoniel have had to deal with being paid less
than directly hired workers.
"Subcontracting has really been the largest force under
cutting workers today," said former SLAC member
Meghana Reddy to The Daily last year. "Twenty percent of
[Stanford] workers are currently subcontracted, and with
subcontracting, workers aren't trained properly, are called
one day to work then called the next day and told not to
come in."

Reddy pointed out that subcontracted workers earn less
than directly hired employees, receive fewer benefits and
often have problems organizing a union.
University officials say they have no way of knowing
how many subcontracted workers are employed at Stan
ford because its agreements with contracted companies do
not specify how many workers are hired; instead, the con
tractor determines the number of employees that will be
used to perform the work.
Work is contracted out to companies because it is eco
nomically practical for the University according to a Uni
versity spokesperson. Contracting companies typically ful
fill service needs, such as janitorial work or construction,
said Susan Hoerger, director of Employee and Labor Re
lations.

Wage parity

Stanford Labor Action Coalition argues that the reason
that the subcontracted labor is cheaper is because contract
ing companies pay their workers lower wages than directly
hired workers.
Senior Leticia Ramirez, a SLAC member, said that the
biggest problem the coalition has with subcontracting is the
issue of wage parity.

"Subcontracted workers who do the same type of work
as those who are directly hired by the University are paid $2
to $3 less per hour," Ramirez said.
The University does require that contractors meet the
minimum standards of the "Living Wage and Benefit
Guidelines for Stanford Contractors." Through these
guidelines, Stanford seeks to establish minimum pay, access
to healthcare benefits and compensated time off for work
ers.

The initial living wage is set at a minimum of $lO.lO per
hour if health benefits are provided and $11.35 if no health
benefits are provided.
The guidelines apply only to subcontracted workers
who are not unionized, not directly hired or temporary
workers.

But SLAC and SEIU Local 715, the labor union that
represents directly hired workers on campus, say that the
policy excludes many of the lowest paid workers on campus
and undercuts employees who are currently paid higher
than the living wage.
In addition, they argue that the $lO.lO living wage
calculated by Stanford is less than the $13.68 wage calcu
lated by Santa Clara County.

Larry Quinn has worked 27 years
for Cardinal Cogen, the power plant
on campus that the University has
contracted out to General Electric in
1987. Just this past week the 16 union
ized workers were able to negotiate a
favorable contract with General Elec
tric. Quinn expressed his belief that all
workers on the campus should be
treated the same.
"There are workers who are direct
ly hired by the University who are
earning higher wages than us even
though we are doing equivalent jobs,"
Quinn said. "Why shouldn't we be
paid the same wages for providing the
same services for the same cus
tomer?"
Kennedy Helm, a negotiator from
SEIU 715, said he believes General
Electric took a step in the right direc
tion with the new four-year contract.
"On the last day of negotiations,
the representative from G.E. had out a
copy of the contract Stanford uses to
hire its workers, and was referring to
it," Helm said.
The new four-year contract in
creased workers' wages over the next
four years and also gave them more
union rights.
Roxana Rivera, a representative

from SEIU Local 715, said that her or
ganization is not seeking to end sub
contracting altogether, but rather fight
for the rights of the workers.
