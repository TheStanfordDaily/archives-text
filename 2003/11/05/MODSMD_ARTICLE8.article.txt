## Perp fiction: The Scarlet Petter 
### 
When we thought none of the grown-ups were
watching, my best friend and I would scamper
up to the attic and rifle through her mom's
pulp detective novels. The pictures on the front of the
books were the stuff of nightmares: shattered mirrors,
puddles of blood and, on seemingly every single cover,
strangled starlets, their luscious Vargas-girl bodies pert
even in death, their flowing manes pooled around their
limpid Kewpie eyes.

The most disturbing cover of all,
however, was not so lurid. Perhaps
still up in that attic, gathering dust, is a
dog-eared copy of scare maven
Martha Grimes's 'I Am the Only Run
ning Footman', emblazoned with a
tiny cameo portrait of a girl's sur
prised, flushed face and part of her
torso; the girl is looking down at a
glove-clad hand that is about to grab
her.

Just as a New Yorker reviewer wrote of Grimes, our
campus serial groper "gets our attention and holds
it"(no pun intended, need you ask?). On two separate
occasions, I've seen students glance carelessly at The
Daily, do a double take, read the serial groper headline
aloud to themselves, snatch up a copy and continue on
their way.
In conversations around campus, I've found that in
the popular imagination, the groper is often envisioned
not as a reprehensible culprit, but as a plucky, sex
starved prankster taking it where he can grab it. A
horny Horatio Alger manifestation, proactively seizing
what he wants. (If only all of us could be satisfied with
something so simple as a handful of nubile flesh.) Or
maybe not. "Groping" implies confusion, lack of in
tent: "I'm just groping around for something in the
dark, and-whoa, hello, mama!" Our boy's a minor
league villain, incomparable to those cockeyed Dean
Koontz or Patricia Cornwall heavyweights.
We rationalize: He's not that bad, really. He's not a
serial rapist or a serial killer. Just a serial. . . groper.
And it's easier to deal with anxiety about him by laugh
ing it off.
One Stanford student, who preferred to remain
anonymous, had this to say in his online blog: "I decid
ed to walk home tonight to try to catch the serial grop
er. Okay, maybe my bike light's broken and I don't
want to chance getting killed crossing Campus Drive.
But how cool would that be to be the one who caught
the serial groper? Does anyone else think the press the
guy's receiving is just a little bit humorous?"
Every new report of the perp's malfeasance is re
ceived as another thrilling segment of an extended info
tainment miniseries: Serial groper cops another feel! To
Be Continued ... dah dah dah dum! Where and when
will he strike next? Insta-famous in Bubbleland, this guy
is literally the small-time crook's poster boy.

As if I was groping
Groping around for some ladder to fame
I am ashamed
â€”Squint, "Jesus is for Losers"

Isn't famous and feared just what he would like to
be, though? Perhaps we could protect ourselves better
if we thought of him differently. It's disquieting how
many of us have become acclimated to the idle unre
quested grab from yet another total boob. (Not in the
silicone sense.)
But we've become resigned to this: "He was, like,
totally feeling her up on the dance floor, and he didn't
even know her. She didn't say anything. She was cool
with it," says one girl to me. It's windy, and she giggles,
shivers, and looks away. "It's so funny."
One night, during the first quarter of my freshman
year, a man followed me home, pulled me into a dark
corner and kissed me. The man was no grizzled Richard
Allen Davis bogey: He was young, muscular and clean
shaven, and I had never seen him before. In Berkeley,
as in any city, you outrun people like him. You're on
your guard. But this was so sudden.
Back in my dorm room, my only thought was to keep
mum about it. It never occurred to me to report it.
A few days ago, I finally told one of my friends about
this. I expected she would get on my case about not get
ting the cops to hunt the guy down. She's the kind of
chick who dishes out attitude with a capital A, who un
consciously flexes her biceps (and she's cut) when she's
talking to you. But no.
"I got groped a few weeks ago," she said . "He just
lifted my skirt and touched me right there on the flesh.
And I never wear skirts. Had to be that one day I did."
When I asked her if she reported it, she shakes her
head.
"I just sucked it up," she says sheepishly. "I didn't like
others to see me as vulnerable." Both of us thought that
"by suffering private Mortification [we] may avoid pub
lic Shame," as that master novelist Henry Fielding put it.
What it comes down to is the misdirection of this
shame. In the high-stakes Stanford arena, there's a say
ing that students are known for paddling desperately
below the surface to keep afloat, while keeping up an
appearance of calm. In particular, some girls will do
anything to maintain their sexual sprezzatura, to avoid
being branded with the scarlet (or be it cardinal?) let
ter of a victim.
Meanwhile, the groper gets away with it in a state
where even Arnie's untouched by the fallout from what
state bigwig Bill Lockyer condoned as his "frat boy be
havior." Those he gropes become walking synec
doches; we picture their T&A being grabbed, we don't
think bother with imagining their faces. And who wants
to be one of those girls with their face blocked out on a
TV crime story segment, their features spliced and
diced into the ultimate Cubist portrait?
I always wondered why those pulp novels rarely
showed the perps on the cover. Let's kick this attitude
where it counts.
