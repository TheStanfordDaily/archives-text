# Cheerleaders like it rah

### ROB LIU 
I was a swimmer in high school. Back then it pissed me off that sports
like football and basketball had cute girls cheering for them at games,
while we only had semi-naked guys in Speedos. In fact, it pissed me off so
much that I decided I would become a basketball player, hang out with
cheerleaders, and eventually achieve fame and fortune in the NBA.
Unfortunately that dream will never happen. Part of the reason is be
cause I injured myself before I could make my pro debut. The other part
is because I'm 5-foot-10 and have a vertical that my dad once claimed
"you couldn't slide a piece of paper under."
But, for a day, I did get to hang out with some cheerleaders, or more
specifically, Cardinal Competitive Cheer. The squad was started two
years ago by Chelsea Dudek and Renee Burrull, both juniors. The goal
was to create an organization dedicated to the twin goals of competitive
cheerleading and enhancing school spirit.
As such, it bears no relation to the previous incarnation of Stanford
Cheerleading, which, according to rumor, was forced to disband after
spending its entire budget on alcohol. Nor is it affiliated with the Dollies
or the yell leaders.
When I walked in at the end of practice, I immediately noticed two
things. First, there were a lot of attractive, athletic girls, and second, there
were barely any guys. It was like I had died and gone to Arizona State.
One girl came up to me and asked if I was trying out to be a male cheer
leader. At that point I nearly decided to abandon the article and keep this
goldmine a secret.
Unfortunately, my sense of professionalism kicked in. Also, I know
nothing about cheerleading, and all of the guys who were there could
have easily kicked my butt. But I think it was the professionalism that
stopped me.
In my subsequent interview with Chelsea and Renee, both had a
lot to say about what Cardinal Competitive Cheer is and isn't, what
cheerleading in general is like and what types of events the organi
zation participates in. For starters, the squad is completely different

from other spirit organizations like the Dollies or the Band. When I
asked Chelsea why she decided to create a cheerleading team in
stead of joining the Dollies, she responded said the two were a world
apart.
"I was interested in both stunts and competitions," she said, "And no
one on campus was doing that at the time. We're not trying to displace
anybody. We just want to do our own thing."
Unfortunately, having arrived at the very end of practice, I missed out
on what that thing was. But based on their descriptions, the stunts in
volved in cheerleading require strength, poise and above all else, trust. As
Glenn, a law student and one of the few males in the group described,
"I'm throwing a girl 15 feet in the air, and she's not supposed to look
down. That requires us to all really trust each other." Cheerleading is on
the whole a very physically demanding activity, but for the members of
the CCC, that's part of the appeal.
The CCC also participates in competitions, including nationals
last year in Las Vegas. Renee and Chelsea say that for a young team,
they managed to do fairly well. My knowledge of cheerleading com
petitions is limited to what I read on the back cover of "Bring It On,"
which happens to be the only DVD my roommate owns. He has
never come up with a satisfactory explanation why his collection is
so unmanly.
I asked them to compare real cheerleading with the movie. Chelsea said
the girls on the team aren't stupid, catty and superficial. I realized I wasn't
at Arizona State after all. Glenn then insisted numerous times that, con
trary to stereotypes, he wasn't gay. And Renee pointed out that real
cheerleading requires much more time, energy, and dedication than the
movie depicts.
After they left, what struck me the most about the CCC was how en
thusiastic everyone was. Whereas I had always dreaded the physical and
mental world of pain that was swim practice, the girls here seemed gen
uinely excited about the presumably nauseating experience of being
thrown high into the air. So next time there's a home football game, look
out for the Cardinal Competitive Cheer, because they're more exciting to
watch than my swim meets ever were.
