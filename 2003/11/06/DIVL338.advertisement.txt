A note on journalistic integrity
I am deeply troubled by the flagrant factual inaccuracy of yesterday's
Student Announcement Section. The ludicrousness of the "6-0,6-0
Virtua Tennis 2" advertisement's claim, in conjunction with the
anonymity of the author, should have been more than enough to raise
the reddest of flags to the highest of heights and vehemently forbid the
printing of such fabricated trash. Let it serve as a harrowing reminder
of the atrocities that can occur when disseminators of information are
in no way bound to anything remotely resembling truth, but rather are
allowed to frolic freely through the fields of flowery falsification.
Sincerely, Hot IHUM Administrator
