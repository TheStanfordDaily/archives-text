# Clark Center still seeks finding
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Now that professors and graduate students are be
ginning research in their modular labs in the new
Clark Center, the development office has begun rais
ing money for the programs in the building. Stanford
has set a goal of raising more than $125 million for re
search equipment, interdisciplinary grants and grad
uate student stipends for Bio-X over the next few
years, despite a difficult economy and other simulta
neous fundraising goals.
With the Campaign for Undergraduate Education
winding down, some in the development office are
shifting their focus to the interdisciplinary bio
sciences initiatives — Bio-X and the new bioengi
neering department — according to Susan Aber
nethy, associate director of principal gifts.
"This fundraising goal has a very high priority,"
Abernethy said. "It's as near-term as we can make it."
Funding for some programs was up in the air in
2001 after main donor Jim Clark suspended $60 mil
lion of his $150 million pledge in protest of President
Bush's policies on stem-cell research. Now, according
to fundraisers and Bio-X officials, programs are on
schedule, though there is a bigger funding gap to re
coup.
When the suspension was first announced two
years ago, its impact was not exactly clear. The build
ing was under construction, already funded with
Clark's first $90 million and another donation in the
tens of millions of dollars from Atlantic Philan
thropies. At the time, University President John
Hennessy noted how grateful Stanford was for the
money Clark chose to donate, and he emphasized
that the loss of $60 million would not slow down con
struction. Cuts were to be made in programs, which
were left unspecified.
The first $70 million of Clark's original donation
was always earmarked for the building, according to
Abernethy. The next $80 million was meant to go to
ward endowment and expendable costs associated
with establishing Bio-X. A large portion of this
money was dedicated toward endowing fairly unique
research equipment grants.
"There's no great subtlety to this whole issue of
what we would do with more money," said Bio-X
leadership council chair Matthew Scott. "The main
things we're after is to fund the Interdisciplinary Ini
tiatives Program ... second, to have fellowships for
graduate students and post-doctoral students in the
multidisciplinary sciences, and we would [also] like to

establish an advanced instrumentation program."
Fundraisers still intend on fully funding the ad
vanced instrumentation program with a proposed
$40 million endowment. This program will allow orig
inal equipment to be developed at Stanford before
being commercialized, taking advantage of Bio-X's
cutting edge research interests. The program will pro
vide competitive grants for projects that unite biolo
gy and engineering, like DNA microarrays, a Stan
ford invention that transformed the diagnosis of cer
tain types of cancer.
Another $40 million will be committed toward
graduate student funding, and $45 million will endow
the Bio-X grant program for interdisciplinary re
search.
The past two sets of Bio-X interdisciplinary grants
— which totaled $6 million dollars — have come out
of the President's funds, not Bio-X money. These
have funded programs ranging from the ethical di
mensions of neuroscience research to an artificial
cornea project. Stanford hopes to make these grants
permanent by endowing them and making them per
manent features of Bio-X.
"All of this is part of our effort to provide incen
tives to bring new teams together to stimulate new
projects," Scott said.
He also emphasized that these grants, along with
many aspects of Bio-X, reach well beyond the Clark
Center.
"Over 260 faculty have self-identified as wanting
to be affiliated with Bio-X," Abernethy said.
Stanford officials acknowledged that now is still a
hard time to be looking for money, but they were op
timistic.
"A lot of people still have money, we're hoping
they will share that with Stanford," Abernethy said.
Stanford is pursuing other fundraising efforts at
the same time. Bio-X and the Clark Center host one
of the larger industrial affiliated programs on cam
pus. For $300,000 corporations can contribute to re
search and develop relationships with faculty, ac
cording to the Stanford corporate relations web site.
At the official Clark Center opening two weeks
ago, fundraising was a minor topic in the speeches
highlighting the effectiveness and potential of the
new $138 million building. Clark did not mention his
suspended donation in his speech.
Hennessy disclosed that Atlantic Philanthropies,
previously anonymous, was the other major donor
for the building. Atlantic Philanthropies is a $4 billion
foundation, founded and funded by
Charles Feeney, founder of Duty
Free Shoppers Group. The founda
tion, located in Bermuda, was totally
anonymous until 1997. Since then
many donations have been made
anonymously, though most are now
announced. Atlantic Philanthropies
could not be reached for this article.
The tens of millions of dollars
that the foundation donated to
Stanford was one of the larger single
donations the group has made
among its many gifts to universities
around the world. The donation was
made before Clark suspended his
donation.
