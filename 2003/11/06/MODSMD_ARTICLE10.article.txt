# Up in Smoke: Answer Girl weeds through questions
## 
### 
QHey Answer Girl, how does weed
work its splendid magic on the
human mind? And why is it that
despite its medicinal properties,
high-energy-low-cholesterol food oils, and re
silience as a clothing material, it is still illegal in
the United States and many other countries?
A Ahh, so you want to know about
/\ the effects of marijuana? Well,
/ | first off, I should thank you for
asking; I was starting to wonder
how long it'd be before this question came up.
But at any rate: You see, my half-baked
buddy, most of marijuana's special effects —

including red-eye, the munchies and what

pharmacologists call "fatu
ous euphoria" (meaning
"getting stupid and feeling
high") — are caused by one
mighty and magical com
pound produced by the mar
ijuana plant, commonly re
ferred to as "THC."
So what is THC? Well,
not only does it happen to
be the acronym for "Texas
Historical Commission," as

well as "The Hacker's Choice" (a Ger
many-based group proclaiming itself as de
voted to "hacking, phreaking and anar
chy"), but in this case it refers to the chemi

cal, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(C21H30O2). As it turns out, THC is a lot
like a certain group of compounds — called
"cannabinoids," in honor of you-know
what — which occur naturally in the brain;
Apparently, these compounds are responsi
ble for repressing the flow of certain anxi
ety-producing chemicals. As a result, just
like with heroin and other psychoactive
drugs, that means there's already a bunch of
receptors in your brain that are perfectly
made for sucking up THC. Unlike the re
ceptors for heroin, however, none of them
are located in life-sustaining areas of the
brain, like the brain stem; That's why you
don't really hear about people overdosing
and killing themselves from weed.

What's more, as you brought up, smoking
the ganja can actually be pretty good for what
ails you — depending, I guess, on what ails
you. For, not only does it have the ability to
produce hours of giggles and amusement for
you and a circle of friends, but it's also proven
to be beneficial for cancer and glaucoma pa
tients.
And as for that whole miasma of political
issues? Sorry, but I think I'm gonna stay out of
that: Getting into all that stuff can really mess
a girl up, you know.

Are you looking to whine about how biased
my answer was to this question? Do you too
think I deserve real questions to answer?
