## Student-athlete bill shouldn't pass 
### 
A bill in the California legisla
ture threatens the future of
Stanford's participation in
the NCAA. The bill propos
es that student athletes in California
should get a higher share of the profits
and benefits that they confer upon
their athletic programs. To accomplish
this, the bill mandates that institutions
of higher learning in California should
not obey NCAA regulations about stu

dent athletes on ath
letic scholarships and
stipends, agents and
attorneys, jobs out
side of sports, health
insurance and trans
fer student-athletes.
If the bill passes,
student-athletes
would basically be
come professional
athletes playing for a
college team. They
would be allowed to
have agents, could be
paid salaries and
would be subject to
far fewer restrictions
based on their status
as students than they
currently are under
NCAA rules.

It is clear that the bill will cause
schools in California to be noncompli
ant with NCAA regulations. This ef
fect is simply unacceptable. The vast,
over-reaching proposal of the bill will
do much more harm than good by
putting in jeopardy Stanford's eligibil
ity to participate in NCAA events.
The authors of the bill claim that the
NCAA's policies for student-athletes
are unfair and overly restrictive. Their
stated goal in proposing the bill is for
college athletes to get their "fair
share" of the money that college ath
letic programs make. They also seem
to believe that this bill will cause the
NCAA to change its policies.
There are several problems with
these arguments. While on the face of
things this bill may appear to suggest a
far more equitable system for student

athletes, the fact remains that these
athletes are first and foremost stu
dents. Athletes here are not participat
ing in sports at Stanford in order to
make a profit.
While there may be some inequities
and unfair regulations in the NCAA
scheme, there are ways that student
athletes and individual college athletic
programs can work within the system
to solve these problems. If problems

suggested by the bill's
proponents do arise,
there are systems set up
within the NCAA al
ready that should be
used, rather than a
blanket law that may or
may not solve these
problems and will cause
Stanford athletes to be
ineligible for NCAA
events.
The idea that the
bill will cause the
NCAA to change its
policies is also patently
ridiculous. It is doubt
ful that any college
programs have ap
proached the NCAA
asking for the changes
that this bill proposes,

and there is no evidence that the pro
posals of this bill are even good solu
tions to some of the problems facing
college athletic programs. At the very
least, the claim that the NCAA will
ever agree to a scheme that makes col
lege athletes into professional athletes
is highly dubious.
The NCAA regulations, while they
may be flawed in some ways, are basi
cally an attempt to make sure that stu
dent-athletes are treated first as stu
dents above their roles as athletes. At
their foundation, the regulations are a
way to protect student-athletes from
abuse and exploitation. The bill in the
California legislature, no matter what
its intentions are, co-opts those goals in
way that will be overwhelmingly harm
ful to student athletes and Stanford ath
letic programs.

If the bill passes,
student-athletes
would basically
become professional
athletes playing
for a college team.
