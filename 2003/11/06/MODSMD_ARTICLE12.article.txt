# College rankings need substance
## 
### 
In October, The Atlantic Monthly re
leased its new college rankings. Based
only on the selectivity of colleges
across the nation, the rankings put
Stanford in sixth place. While Stanford was
not misrepresented or placed in a bad light,
the question lingers: Do

these rankings matter?
The rankings field,
once led only by U.S.
News & World Report,
has become a bit crowded
these days. Newsweek is
in on the rankings game
with a "How to Get Into
College" issue that lists
"The 12 Hottest Schools,"
and now The Atlantic is
adding its two cents. The
selectivity criterion of The
Atlantic includes admis
sion rates and the aca
demic statistics of each
year's entering class.
While statistics paint an
overall picture of a school,
the individual brush
strokes of a college cannot
be discovered merely by
looking at numbers and
percentages. Instead of

L O
looking at the best school overall, students
need to focus on what campus will be the
best fit for them. This fit, certainly, won't be

based solely, or even primarily, on the se
lectivity of the school or its SAT score
range.
The truth is anyone cbuld compile a list
of schools, put a big magazine name behind
it and call it a valid ranking system. The
multi-million dollar business of ranking

colleges has gotten out
of hand and it's starting
to capitalize on stu
dents' anxieties instead
of helping them find the
best place to pursue
their education. Stu
dents should not en
dorse this practice by
continuing to buy and
recommend these
guides.
The bottom line is
that a student cannot
base the best match for
himself or herself on
statistics alone. Even if
a visit to a potential
school isn't possible,
talking to current stu
dents, professors and
administrators will help
paint a fuller picture of
a school. Students

should weigh these qualitative measure
ments more heavily when deciding where
to spend the next four years of their lives.
