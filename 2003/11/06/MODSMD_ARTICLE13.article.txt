# OPINIONS
## ORDER IN THE COURT? Tech's too high for this guy 
### 
Those who know my
roots as a software en
gineer are always
somewhat surprised
that I am now a self-avowed
technophobe. Actually,
"technophobe" is probably
the wrong word. I'm not really
"afraid" of technology, the
way I'm afraid of, say, tort re
form. I just hate it with a pas
sion.
Why do I feel this way? I'm
glad I asked. The main case
for technology seems to be
that it increases productivity:
You can do more things quick
ly. Well, this is exactly what
I'm against. The more I'm ca
pable of doing, the more I'm
expected to accomplish. Take
this weekend, for example:
I'm taking the redeye to Balti
more for my cousin-in-law's
wedding and turning right
around to head home the next
day so I don't miss any class.
Back in the day, simply going
over the river and through the
woods to grandmother's house
was considered a monumental
holiday-season accomplish
ment.
Two major arguments in
favor of technology are that it:
(a) improves the quality of my
leisure time; and (b) increases
the amount of leisure time I
have.
I intend to disprove both
assertions.
My friends all seem to be of
the opinion that leisure time
just wouldn't be as sweet with
out the ready availability of

videogames. I, however, can
hardly think of anything more
frustrating and torturous. I
grew up with the Nintendo. It
had exactly two buttons: "A"
and "B." No matter what game

you played,
"A" jumped
and "B" fired
your weapon.
This standard
was so rigid
that the mak
ers of "Barbie
Goes Shop
ping" had to
give the title
character a

pricing gun
just so that the "B" button
would do something. (The
"A" button was, of course, for
items on the high shelves.)
The modern eight-button
controller intimidates the hell
out of me. I lack the mental
acuity to even remember what
the buttons are called, let
alone to instantaneously re
call the arcane 17-button se
quence that will cause my
character to burp at precisely
the right moment. If I want to
feel like a clumsy idiot, I can
save a few hundred bucks by
buying a yo-yo. I'm good with
the downward yo, but the in
tricate mysteries of the up
ward yo continue to flummox
me.
I would also argue that
technology decreases, rather
than increases, the amount of
leisure time I have. For exam
ple, ask a random sampling of

European History teachers
what the most important in
vention of the last millennium
was, and they'll likely all give
you the same answer: the
printing press. Could the Mar
quis de Sade himself have de
signed a more effective tor
ture machine? Think how
much less reading we students
would have without this pain
factory. It's much harder to
assign "Moby Dick" without
any printed copies available.
And even if it were assigned,
there'd be a myriad of excuses
for failing to complete the as
signment, such as "Fred
wasn't done with the
manuscript yet" and "I
couldn't read Melville's hand
writing."
I have my own personal
vendetta against the printing
press. I have to write one of
these columns every single
week. I'm jealous of my me
dieval counterparts. If in
stead of printing presses, The
Daily instead employed 40
monks with parchment and
quill pens, I'd only have to do
one column every 20 years or
so. And that would leave me
with a heck of a lot more
leisure time to master the up
ward yo.
