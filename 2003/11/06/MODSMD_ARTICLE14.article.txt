The Daily's decision to run ads
violates Fundamental Standard
I am writing to you with regards
to the campustruth.org advertise
ments that The Stanford Daily in
sists on running despite the
protests and complaints of many
students. The case, as it stands, is
very clear: These ads are a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard
that has been the guiding clause for
Stanford students since 1896. They
do not show respect for order be
cause they have the real potential
to incite violence and misbehavior
against a specific racial and reli
gious group. They show no respect
for morality because they demo
nize an entire people based on the
actions of a few and they falsely
present subjective opinions as
facts. They show no respect for the
rights of others as they condemn an
entire people as bloodthirsty ter
rorists and show no compassion for
the cumulative suffering of a dis
placed, impoverished and humili
ated people without a homeland.
I understand The Stanford
Daily is independent of Stanford
University, but its staff are Stan
ford students, and thus are bound
to the Fundamental Standard re
gardless of the fact that their con
tributions to The Daily are not
under official University jurisdic
tion. Furthermore, The Stanford
Daily exclusively serves the Stan

ford community and thus should
assume the same guiding princi
ples that its readers are asked to
adhere to. This is not an unreason
able request: We are all one com
munity and the Fundamental Stan
dard is the very least that can be
expected of us. I insist that you ob
serve the Fundamental Standard
and remove these ads from your
publication. The ads also clearly
violate standard codes used by the
vast majority of newspapers and
publications, including The
Daily's own rules and regulations.
Continued violation of the Funda
mental Standard renders this pub
lication unworthy of the Stanford
community who, I am sure, are not
amused by cheap stunts and pro
paganda that you see fit to shower
us with.
I would like to finish by in
forming you of my deep regret
that this incident ever happened.
To think that the Stanford com
munity is being served by a news
paper that sees it fit to slander my
fellow students as well as create a
tense, unwelcome atmosphere in
an already difficult environment,
is truly disheartening. I came to
this country for the first time this
year, a hopeful but hesitant fresh
men that believed in an open, fair
society that I could embrace. I
will return home this December
holiday with low spirits and con
siderably less optimism for my fu

ture here in Stanford.

Daily's policy unreasonable
This is in response to Peter
Jaffe's letter to the editor
("Daily's policy reasonable," Oct.
5) that the Daily's policy is reason
able in ridiculing a portion of this
community. It is not justified at
any level to generalize and portray
a people as heartless tyrants espe
cially if the source of the opinion is
from a nationally recognized pro
paganda. Even though I am Pak
istani and not Palestinian, I'd like
to remind Mr. Jaffe that these ads
go far and wide to spread further
ignorance and discrimination
against people such as myself. I
Have been forwarded numerous
times at the airport to "secondary
immigration" for being "middle
eastern looking," and The Daily
has undoubtedly done me a great
disservice by adding to the suspi
cion and mistrust which is already
rampant today. This short sighted
ness attacks the very fiber of this
campus community that has pro
vided me some sort of security and
will only contribute to the great
discomfort that I already experi
ence today.
