# OUT OF AFRICA
## Hip-hopping all over the world 
### MEKLET WORKNEH 
From Gabon to Cuba, Cambodia to
Egypt, France to Brazil, hip-hop cul
ture has become one of the aefiners of
a generation. There are emcee battles
in Tokyo and Run DMC lovers in Rome.
There is hip-hop graffiti in Geneva and break
dancers in China. How did this form of music
travel from its inception on the streets of the
Bronx in New York to the streets of Havana,
Paris and Dakar?
Regardless of who wants to recognize it and
who does not, hip-hop has infiltrated the inter
national music arena and has become a domi
nant youth culture worldwide in terms of dress,
language, art and behavior. Most importantly,
hip-hop is globally coming to serve as a forum
for youth to critique economic, social and po
litical conditions m their own communities as
well as internationally. It is coming to serve as
a bridge over which cross-cultural ideals and
commonalities can be communicated because
this is a form of music which day by day is com
ing to transcend race, class and ethnic barriers.
One of the first hip-hop groups I remember
hearing was Salt 'n' Pepa. When I was in the
second grade "Let's about sex" was their big
hit. My older brother would be bumpin' it on
his stereo at our house in Nairobi. I think the
reason this particular song sticks out is because
of what I then considered explicit lyrics. My ex
posure to hip-hop music only grew from then
on.
I moved back to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia a
couple of years later and access to hip-hop
music and culture was much more limited
there than it had been in Nairobi. But people
were fascinated bv this culture and would hus
tle to keep up witn how hip-hop was develop
ing outside Ethiopia. My older orother was in
boarding school in the United States by then,
so my younger brother and I would ask him to
send us CDs and tapes. My younger brother
being the business-mindea person he was,
would charge people for mixed tapes he would
make.
Fast forward and now urban culture in most
cities in Africa has incorporated some sort of
hip-hop culture. Not only has access to the
music and the culture heightened through new
TV and radio channels, but Africans are mak
ing concrete efforts to create their own flavors
of hip-hop. Kwaito music in South Africa was
founded m townships like Soweto, and is a
blend of hip-hop ana South African rhythms.
Although the artists do not always perform in
English, you hear popular groups like Tkzee
ana Arthur getting airplay in Adais Ababa and
Nairobi.
What is it about hip-hop that has allowed its
vast popularization today/ From its inception

in urban black culture, hip-hop was a social,
political, economic critique through the eyes of
black youth. It was a form of expression that al
lowed individualism and popular entertain
ment. At the same time, it was significant be
cause it was a manner in which urban black
youth were rebelling against the restraints
placed on them not only by those outside their
community, but even older generations in their
community. This basis of nip-hop still holds
true today in that hip-hop is still a youth move
ment and a forum of youth expression against
societal ills. More and more, hip-hop culture is
becoming a prevalent culture in the clubs and
streets of urban areas worldwide.
In the same way that Paris is the center of
international fashion, the United States is seen
as the mecca of hip-hop. But across the board
we see incorporations of more familiar sounds
and beats with local influences. In Algeria, you
see groups like MBS who use Arabic instru
ments. In Cuba, groups like Orishas, whom I
heard for the first time last year, are creating a
fusion of rap with Cuban rhythms such as son,
salsa and meringue. In Senegal, arguably one
of the most productive points in Africa of hip
hop music, several artists fuse the traditional
rhythms of various ethnic groups with hip-hop
beats and rhymes. MC Solar, one of the great
pioneers of French rap, is originally Sene
falese, like many of the rappers we see in
ranee's vibrant hip-hop scene. France has one
of the biggest hip-hop industries outside the
United States ana produce some amazing hip
hop. My first exposure to French rap was in '96
with artists like Stomy Bugsy, MC Solar and
Saian Supa Crew, all of Caribbean and West
African origin. I was amazed at how advanced
the industry was in comparison to many other
countries.
Similarly, in the United States, we see
American hip-hop influenced by other coun
tries. South Asian and middle eastern rhythms
seem to be on the current most popular list.
Flip-hop is starting to do a lot for snaring of
ideas and the forming of cross-cultural connec
tions. Many of the messages coming through
hip-hop music internationally are also starting
to oecome acknowledged as positive social and
political commentary. Whether we like it or
not, this is a culture that is exploding in popu
larity worldwide and is quickly a dominant
form of social and political commentary for
youth. This is a phenomena that we should
work to promote and turn into a legitimate
forum for sharing ideas and extending respect
and love across borders.
