## The 						essence of sustainable development 
### TERRY L. ANDERSON LAURA HUG GINS 
Thirty years ago, a group of academics
known as the Club of Rome put forth the
"limits to growth" theory, predicting dis
aster for humankind unless natural re
source-depleting economic and techno
logical progress were abandoned. This
gloom-and-doom theory has been resur
rected under the guise of sustainable de
velopment, calling for changes in virtual
ly every aspect of our consumption and
production.
"Sustainability," a seductive though
vague term, argues that resource use
today should leave future generations at
least as well off as current generations. Of
course nobody wants to make future gen
erations poorer and less healthy, but this
definition provides no guidance for how
this result can be avoided. There is no
way to know what resource use is accept
able today and no way to know what fu
ture generations may desire. Yet because
of its deceptive simplicity, sustainability
is applied to anything from agricultural
practices to energy use to mining.
Implicit in the calls for sustainable de
velopment are two fundamental assump
tions. The first is that we are running out
of resources, thus leaving future genera
tions with less; the second is that market
processes are the cause of these deple
tions. But in fact, several studies offer ev

idence suggesting the opposite.
Resources are becoming less, not
more, scarce. Agricultural yields for rice,
corn and wheat have increased for
decades. Known reserves of oil, natural
gas and coal have been expanding, and
accessible stocks of aluminum, zinc, iron
and copper have grown as technology de
velops more-conservative production
techniques and the price mechanism en
courages exploration and new discover
ies of underground reserves. Moreover,
life expectancy, housing, nutrition and
education levels are improving in both
the developed and the developing world.
In short, the prosperity we enjoy today is
leaving future generations better off, not
worse off.
How can this be? Sustainable develop
ment, if it can be defined as a call to max
imize human welfare, is only possible in a
legal system where property rights ensure
market operability. Property rights
(when well defined, enforced and trans
ferable) provide the structure that en
courages development, innovation, con
servation and discovery of new resources.
Growth, and increasing wealth through
these methods, leads to improved envi
ronmental quality by raising demands for
it and by providing the wherewithal to
meet these demands. In this context, eco
nomic growth is not the antithesis of sus
tainable development; it is the essence of
it. Therefore, how we deal with the evo

lution and protection of property rights in
the future will determine not only how
free and prosperous we are but also how
much environmental quality we enjoy.
Sustainable development stems from
sustainable institutions — political and
economic systems based on secure prop
erty rights and the rule of law. Doomsay
ers, however, continue to profess, as they
have since Thomas Maltnus, that expo
nential economic growth and consump
tion will ultimately run up against re
source limits. They call for more govern
ment regulation to stop this growth. If
their calls are successful, we will have nei
ther sustainable growth nor sustainable
improvements in environmental quality.
It is not resources that are too scarce but
the institutions that ensure human free
dom. Only by sustaining those institu
tions will we be able to sustain develop
ment and advance environmental quality
— only then can we have our environ
mental cake and eat it too!
