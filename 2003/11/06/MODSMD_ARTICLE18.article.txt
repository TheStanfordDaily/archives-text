## Scott eats his words about Card... sort of 
### 
What a difference a week makes. It's
hard to believe that seven days ago I
used this space to declare that our
beloved Stanford football team had hit rock bot
tom, the lowest of lows, after a particularly bru
tal loss at Oregon.
Judging by the feedback I received in the
days that followed, that assessment rubbed
some the wrong way. Phew! Even a minor
tremor of controversy among the notoriously
apathetic Stanford football-watching communi
ty is a good thing. I was beginning to think no
body cared.
I can also imagine that some frustrated play
ers may have wanted to use my face and scrawny
frame as a personal punching bag and all I can
say to that is, well, guys, thanks for taking it out
on UCLA instead.
There was nowhere for this team to go but up
and the Cardinal moved eons away from rock
bottom, delivering a more inspired performance

against the Pacific 10 Con
ference-leading Bruins than
Snoop Dogg's guest-star
ring role on ESPN's "Play
makers."
If not for their cardinal
pants and block'S' helmets,
I don't think many of the
44,000-plus in the stands
Saturday would've recog
nized the Stanford football

team as the same group of guys we've grown ac
customed to watching and bemoaning for the
past season and a half.
With the sun shining, Stanford came out of
the locker room with a hop in its step you
wouldn't expect from a 2-4 team fresh off its first
shutout loss in seven years. Sixty minutes later,
the Cardinal left the stadium victorious and out
of the Pac-10 cellar. Fans had a reason to party
(OK, another reason) and yours truly went
home with something positive to write about
other than another sad story.
Was it a flawless victory? Hardly. Are there
negatives to harp on? You bet. But I won't — at
least not for another few paragraphs.
In a word, Saturday's win was special.
Two all beef patties, special teams, lettuce,
cheese, pickles, onions, Stanford got the job
done. Mediocre through the first six games, the
Cardinal special teams were superb Saturday.
Luke Powell, who was more due than your
student communications bill, returned a punt 90
yards for a touchdown that completely changed
the complexion of the game before halftime. In
the second half, Marcus McCutcheon set up the
decisive touchdown by pouncing on a bouncing
ball that deflected off a UCLA player deep in
Bruins territory off a punt by Eric Johnson, who
averaged 47.2 yards per kick and planted four in
side the 20.
You could feel the collective bad breath
being taken out of the UCLA players and their
impressive contingent of fans after Powell's punt
return, the second longest in school history.
The offense, (yes, Stanford has one) orches
trated a 13-play, 75-yard drive in the second
quarter that culminated in the once popular, six
point scoring tradition called a touchdown.
After two straight rushing plays evoked a horri
ble sensation of deja vu, Chris Lewis' play-ac
tion faked out half the stadium in addition to the
UCLA defense, enabling the fifth-year senior to
find Matt Traverso wide open in the corner of
the endzone.
Last, but certainly not least deserving of
recognition, is the defense. After being lit up a
week ago, the Cardinal D blew up at the expense
of the Bruins. The pass rush (yes, Stanford has
one of those, too) had eight sacks and beat on
UCLA quarterbacks Matt Moore and Drew
Olson like a Bobo doll and Patrick Ramsey. The
defense also forced three fumbles, recovered
two and added an interception.
The jubilee in the stands was topped only by
the emotion on the sidelines, where fired up
players and coaches practically convulsed after
big defensive stops, rushing to greet teammates
as they ran off the field.
There's no question it was a great win, but
don't plan your winter break around the possi
bility of Stanford becoming bowl eligible. Po
tentially the result of unimaginative or sheer
conservative play-calling, the Cardinal offense
did sputter with the exception of its touchdown
drive in the second quarter and the defense and
special teams can't be expected to bail the team
out every week.
Lewis finished the game 12-of-20 for 91
yards, one touchdown and an interception.
In the second half, the Cardinal resembled a
team playing not to lose, rather than playing to
win, completing a paltry two passes and convert
ing just two first downs.
Alas, the bottom line is that the Cardinal has
left rock bottom in the dust and there's once
again reason to believe there's light at the end of
the tunnel.
How big was Saturday's win? Easily the biggest
in Teevens' tenure and the best reason to get ex
cited about Stanford football in quite some time.
Here's to hoping there's still more reason
when all is said and done this Saturday.

Scott Allen is an optimist at heart majoring in
psychology. But still he wonders: IfTeevens has
only won five games total, isn't every win the
biggest win of his Stanford career? Hmmm ...
some food for thought. E-mail him at

There was nowhere for this team to go but up
and the Cardinal moved eons away from rock
bottom, delivering a more inspired performance

against the Pacific 10 Con
ference-leading Bruins than
Snoop Dogg's guest-star
ring role on ESPN's "Play
makers."
If not for their cardinal
pants and block'S' helmets,
I don't think many of the
44,000-plus in the stands
Saturday would've recog
nized the Stanford football

team as the same group of guys we've grown ac
customed to watching and bemoaning for the
past season and a half.
With the sun shining, Stanford came out of
the locker room with a hop in its step you
wouldn't expect from a 2-4 team fresh off its first
shutout loss in seven years. Sixty minutes later,
the Cardinal left the stadium victorious and out
of the Pac-10 cellar. Fans had a reason to party
(OK, another reason) and yours truly went
home with something positive to write about
other than another sad story.
Was it a flawless victory? Hardly. Are there
negatives to harp on? You bet. But I won't — at
least not for another few paragraphs.
In a word, Saturday's win was special.
Two all beef patties, special teams, lettuce,
cheese, pickles, onions, Stanford got the job
done. Mediocre through the first six games, the
Cardinal special teams were superb Saturday.
Luke Powell, who was more due than your
student communications bill, returned a punt 90
yards for a touchdown that completely changed
the complexion of the game before halftime. In
the second half, Marcus McCutcheon set up the
decisive touchdown by pouncing on a bouncing
ball that deflected off a UCLA player deep in
Bruins territory off a punt by Eric Johnson, who
averaged 47.2 yards per kick and planted four in
side the 20.
You could feel the collective bad breath
being taken out of the UCLA players and their
impressive contingent of fans after Powell's punt
return, the second longest in school history.
The offense, (yes, Stanford has one) orches
trated a 13-play, 75-yard drive in the second
quarter that culminated in the once popular, six
point scoring tradition called a touchdown.
After two straight rushing plays evoked a horri
ble sensation of deja vu, Chris Lewis' play-ac
tion faked out half the stadium in addition to the
UCLA defense, enabling the fifth-year senior to
find Matt Traverso wide open in the corner of
the endzone.
Last, but certainly not least deserving of
recognition, is the defense. After being lit up a
week ago, the Cardinal D blew up at the expense
of the Bruins. The pass rush (yes, Stanford has
one of those, too) had eight sacks and beat on
UCLA quarterbacks Matt Moore and Drew
Olson like a Bobo doll and Patrick Ramsey. The
defense also forced three fumbles, recovered
two and added an interception.
The jubilee in the stands was topped only by
the emotion on the sidelines, where fired up
players and coaches practically convulsed after
big defensive stops, rushing to greet teammates
as they ran off the field.
There's no question it was a great win, but
don't plan your winter break around the possi
bility of Stanford becoming bowl eligible. Po
tentially the result of unimaginative or sheer
conservative play-calling, the Cardinal offense
did sputter with the exception of its touchdown
drive in the second quarter and the defense and
special teams can't be expected to bail the team
out every week.
Lewis finished the game 12-of-20 for 91
yards, one touchdown and an interception.
In the second half, the Cardinal resembled a
team playing not to lose, rather than playing to
win, completing a paltry two passes and convert
ing just two first downs.
Alas, the bottom line is that the Cardinal has
left rock bottom in the dust and there's once
again reason to believe there's light at the end of
the tunnel.
How big was Saturday's win? Easily the biggest
in Teevens' tenure and the best reason to get ex
cited about Stanford football in quite some time.
Here's to hoping there's still more reason
when all is said and done this Saturday.

Scott Allen is an optimist at heart majoring in
psychology. But still he wonders: IfTeevens has
only won five games total, isn't every win the
biggest win of his Stanford career? Hmmm ...
some food for thought. E-mail him at
