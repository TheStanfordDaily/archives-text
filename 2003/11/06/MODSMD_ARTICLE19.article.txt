# Card battles S.J.

### JESSICA PETERS 
After playing the best attacking games of the
season last weekend in Oregon and Washing
ton, the struggling Stanford soccer team (2-14-
2, 0-9 Pacific-10 Conference) has the confi
dence it needs to turn up results today against
San Jose State (10-4-2, 5-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation).
"I think [last week's games] broke the ice and
we're feeling more confident about getting goals,"
said freshman midfielder Marcus Ryan, who tal
lied five shots in last weekend's contests. "There's
more of a risk-taking attitude with the guys on the
team and I think that bodes well for this game."
Junior forward Darren Fernandez, who broke
Stanford's scoreless skid on Friday night, said that the
team's attitude toward the game in San Jose is helped
by the fact that the squad has "nothing to lose."
"We can just go out there and have fun and
enjoy playing," he said. "And if we are having fun,
then that's when wins will come.
"Besides, everyone knows it's more fun to play
when we score," Fernandez joked.
While the lifted confidence of the Stanford
squad will help it in today's game, overcoming the
Spartans will require an intense team effort.
San Jose State clinched its conference champi
onship on Sunday with a 2-1 triumph over San
Diego State. The Spartans have yet to drop a game
on their home turf this season and have racked up
34 goals in its 16 games, more than half of which
have come from two sophomores, Randy Poggio
and Johnny Gonzalez.
The Cardinal defense, which stumbled last

weekend (partially because of injury), will have to
contain the two Spartan forwards in order to break
its nine-game losing streak. Stanford's offense will
also have to replicate its performance in the Pacif
ic Northwest to add a win to its all-time 17-11-3
record against its local rival.
Stanford's offensive charge will likely again be
led by Fernandez and junior forward Matt Janusz,
who combined for 14 shots last weekend. The pair
could have to work without the help of the squad's
leader in points and assists and co-leader in goals,
said junior James Twellman. Twellman got hit
with a knee injury against Oregon State on Sun
day.
The Cardinal will also likely be without junior
defender Aaron Maines, and the goalkeeper posi
tion is up in the air after junior starter Robby Ful
ton was injured.
Despite the problems that the Cardinal has
with keeping healthy, Ryan and Fernandez be
lieve that the team will be ready for the game, with
all of the players set on giving a proper send off to
graduating seniors Mike Wilson and Abe Geiger.
"Syd and Abe are leaving, and the season is
winding up, and we really want to establish our
selves before that," Ryan explained. "We've had a
tough season, but we can still remedy that. We
want to honor [Wilson and Geiger] that way."
Fernandez agrees that the team's chances to
win tonight are good, since the team is determine
to step up its play.
"We've been playing well for too long not to get
wins," he said. "I feel like it's our time now."
The Spartans and Cardinal will face off in San
Jose this afternoon at 2 p.m.
