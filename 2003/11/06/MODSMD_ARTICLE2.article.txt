# Old Union could be renovated
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU 
For the past 18 months, a space planning commit
tee chaired by Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni has been meeting at least once a month to
consider the possible renovation of Old Union.
According to Robert Porterfield, a health and
safety specialist, the possible renovation of Old
Union comes as a part of "a process done with most of
the older buildings, periodically looking for upgrades
to bring them into code." Porter stated that a struc
tural architect has been called in to walk the grounds
and to give some possibilities of what could be done
with the building.
The committee is composed of 25 members, four of
which are students. The rest are staff and faculty that
represent aspects of student life that range from the
registrar to residential computing.
"The committee is very interested in making
sure everyone's voice is heard," said ASSU Vice
President Joey Natoli, a junior, who regularly
attends meetings. "We have looked into the pos
sibilities of student space for the future. Within
the last 18 months we have discussed what the
needs of the campus are, and how we could pos
sibly accommodate those needs."
Students have asked for more eating spaces and
meeting rooms, according to Natoli.
Natoli also stated that in addition to the
structural architect, the "University architect
has been looking at traffic patterns, landscaping
and the environment in White Plaza, to see how
that can be improved."
However, the committee has not currently
made any definite plans.
"We are just starting this process and have not de
veloped a project timeline yet," said Laura Goldstein
of the department of project management.
Currently, the committee is still discussing the pos
sibilities for the renovation. The current economy is
also impacting the planning process, forcing the com
mittee to prioritize the resources available for the ren
ovation.
"No construction will occur until we can get donors
to support our vision of what campus life can become
with new and refurbished student space," Awakuni
said.
Old Union was constructed in 1909 and was
modeled after the Student Union building at
Harvard. At one point the building contained a
dining hall, a library, a billiards room and a
smoke shop.
Old Union served as the social hub of the Univer
sity up until the construction of Tresidder Union in
1960. The building currently houses the offices of un
dergraduate admission and financial aid, the registrar
and other student services.
