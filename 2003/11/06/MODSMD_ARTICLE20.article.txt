# Frosh Richards makes big impact
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS 
It hasn't taken Kristin Richards very long
to get used to things here on The Farm.
The freshman has quickly become one of
the strongest players on the court for the
Cardinal. She has had a little practice,
though.
For Richards, volleyball has been part of
everyday life for a long time. Her father,
Dave, was on the U.S. National Team and
her mother coaches at a junior college near
their home in Orem, Utah.
"I've been around volleyball practi
cally my whole life," Richards said. "I

started playing seriously when I was
about 8."
Prior to her Stanford career, Richards
had an award-studded high school career,
playing on the Youth National Team in
2000, the Junior National team in 2001-2002
and leading her high school team to the
Utah State Championship while garnering a
Gatorade National Player of the Year
award in 2003.
"The international arena is a lot different
than the collegiate scene," Richards re
marked, "but both are very competitive."
Clearly, Richards was a coveted recruit
coming out of high school, one that had the

Stanford coaches foaming at the mouth.
"When we recruited Kristin we knew
that she was a very experienced, very athlet
ic player â€” one skilled in all areas," said
Stanford head coach John Dunning.
When asked whether he had any qualms
about starting a freshman, Dunning replied,
"Kristin had to beat someone out. No fresh
man comes expecting to start. They have to
earn it."
"There is definitely a lot of pressure, but
it's not bad pressure," Richards said about
starting as a freshman. "It's a great opportu
nity for me."
In her short time on the team, Richards

has already won the respect of her elder
teammates.
"When I look at Kristin, I don't see a
freshman. I see my teammate," said senior
Jennifer Harvey. "It's not until you step
back and realize 'whoa, that's a freshman
doing all this.'"
On the court, Kristin's performance al
ready has spectators taking notice. She
ranks second in kills (trailing only junior
Oganna Nnamani) and third in service aces
(trailing HarVey and junior Jennifer
Hucke).
But, according to Dunning, this is
only the beginning.
"Kristin is getting better every
day," Dunning said. "You can see her
improving with every game, right in
front of you. She's just going to keep
going up."
This is great news for her team

mates, who already love playing with
the freshman.
"Kristin is so much fun, and has so
much energy," said Harvey. "She's one
of those players who will go after ev
erything with so much fight and fire."
The fire is certainly there for
Richards, who never seems to tire of
playing.
"I love volleyball. I don't think I
will ever get tired of it. Even if my
body is a little exhausted, I'm still
going to love being out there to play."
