# Tennis coaching legend retires
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dick Gould was the named "Coach of the Decade" by the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association and Wilson Sporting Goods for the 1980's. And
for the 1990's. By the way, he was also the U.S. Olympic Committee Coach
of the Year in 1998.
Oh, and he was the Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the Year in 1977, '78,
'80, '83, '86, '88, '89, and '98. Don't forget that he was World Tennis / Sharp
Electronics Coach of the Year in 1989. Not to mention that in 1974, '94, '98,
and 2000 he was the ITA / Wilson Intercollegiate Coach of the Year. And
in 2000, he was named the NCAA (yes, you guessed it) Coach of the Year.
Is there an end to this "C of the Y" madness?
Actually, yes, there is. After 38 celebratory years of being head coach of
the Stanford men's tennis team, Gould is retiring.
Gould began his tennis and educational career as an undergraduate and
graduate student at Stanford, where he was a Dean's list scholar and
earned his masters' degree. He moved on to teach at Mountain View High
School for two years and then onto Foothill College where he was head
coach. It was in the fall of 1966 when Gould debuted as Stanford's tennis
head coach.
"My coach was here at Stanford for 16 years and, when he retired, I was
able to step in and take his place," Gould said. "I'd probably still be at
Foothills had this job not opened up or had I not been hired. This was just
a dream come true since getting a job here."
Since calling the shots for the Cardinal, Gould has led the team to 17
NCAA championships. Even so, he knows there is always room for im
provement.
"Having been here this long, I cannot afford to project the image that
we're getting stagnant, that we're sitting on the fact that we've won 17
championships," Gould said. "I must continue to convey to the recruits and
to the public which supports us that we're dynamic and that we're moving
forward â€” that we're trying to improve our program and not opposed to
trying new ideas."
Starting in 1969, Gould has seen every member on his team walk away
with at least one NCAA Championship ring on his finger. If there is one
thing he wants to accomplish before he retires, it's to keep it that way.
"I've always said that if we went four years without winning a champi
onship, I would retire," Gould said. "I've got a senior on my team this year,
Joe Kao, who doesn't have a ring. This is my last chance to get one for Joe."
One such ring owner is none other than the illustrious John McEnroe, a
freshman under Gould's tutelage in 1978. Gould reminisced about the days
of coaching the notoriously hot-tempered tennis superstar.
"John had come to Stanford after just reaching the semifinals at Wim
bledon," Gould recalled. "His style is very unique and distinct, so I had to
learn how best to compliment his style of play, which was well developed
at the highest level. I think John has a lot of respect for me in terms of how
I did that. He was genius with the racket."
Not only is Dick "Coach of the Decade" Gould a master instructor on
the courts, he is also a leader in the community. Driven by a deep dedica
tion to the sport and Stanford University, he has launched campaigns that
have raised $16 million toward the building of the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
As if Gould isn't accomplished enough, you can also add the title of au
thor to his credentials. His book "Tennis Anyone?" is now in its 6th edition
of print.
"It started as a syllabus for my Foothills College class about 40 years

Cardinal coaching legend Dick Gould has announced that he is stepping down at the end of this season,
concluding a storied career in which Gould has led the team to 17 NCAA championships.
ago," Gould said. "Foothill put it
together for me, the publisher saw
it in the bookstore, and it evolved
into the last edition several years
ago. Now it's a bestseller book."
In his last season of head coach
ing glory, Gould is undoubtedly a
role model to the community and a
revered leader in the tennis world.
"I hope that I've conveyed to my
players over the years that there is
a way to approach competition and
that way can epitomize things like
sportsmanship, integrity and class.
I hope I have been a good example
in that respect, not only for my own
teams, but for other college teams
and other people in sports, espe
cially young kids."
"You must be a gentleman in
competition," Gould added. "Rel
ish and respect the game and show
it by your actions on the court."
On a campus where athletic ex
cellence has become the norm,
Gould has established himself as
the epitome of success, both on and
on off the court. And he is grateful
to have done it on The Farm.
"No school in the country has
done what Stanford has done,"
Gould said. "To be a small part of
that has been a tremendous rush
forme."
