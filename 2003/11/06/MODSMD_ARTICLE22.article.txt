# Big East raids C-USA adding five new teams
## 
### 
(U-WIRE) STORRS, Conn. â€” The Big East Con
ference just got a whole lot bigger Tuesday, as the
conference announced it had officially welcomed
five new schools to help rebuild a wounded league.
Cincinnati, DePaul, Louisville, Marquette and
South Florida, all members of Conference USA, ac
cepted the invitations from the Big East to become
full-fledged members of the conference at the start
of the 2005-06 season.
"It's a very exciting day in the history of the Big
East. We are thrilled to be joined by five great insti
tutions," Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese
said.
The Big East's expansion was in response to the
ACC's expansion earlier in the year that claimed
current, and soon to be former, Big East members
Miami, Virginia Tech and Boston College.
Cincinnati, Louisville and South Florida, who
were targeted for their football programs, will be
Big East members in all sports. DePaul and Mar
quette will be members in all sports except for
football.
In order to maintain their position as an affiliated
member of the BCS, the Big East needed to add
three football teams as is mandated by the NCAA.
Many have questioned that when the BCS con
tract runs out in 2006 that the Big East, and their less
potent football league, would not be included as a
member in the contract negotiations that will begin
within the next few months.
"I still believe that we're one of the six best foot
ball playing conferences," Tranghese said. "We
think we belong."
Cincinnati, Louisville and South Florida will now
join UConn, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Syracuse and West
Virginia to form the new football league. Temple, a
current member of the Big East only as a football
member, will leave the conference after next year.
Along with a new look football league, the Big
East will now boast one of, if not the, top basketball
conferences in the country.
The additions of DePaul and Marquette, notori
ous basketball schools, along with the other three
schools will give the Big East a basketball super-con
ference that boasts some of the best programs in the
nation.
The eight football schools will join the eight other

teams to form a 16-team league. St. John's, Seton
Hall, Villanova, Georgetown, Providence, Notre
Dame, Marquette and DePaul will form a 16-school
league for basketball.
The new look league will feature seven members
who have won a national championship, including
Syracuse last season and UConn in 1999.
Marquette is coming off an appearance in the
Final Four. Cincinnati and Louisville both made the
NCAA Tournament the past year.
Seven schools currently ranked in the
ESPN/USA Today Preseason Top 25 Coaches Poll
will be members of the Big East starting in 2005.
Combined, the new conference will have a total
of 39 Final Four appearances and nine national titles
won by seven teams.
"One of the key things, being a traditionalist and
someone that has been involved with the Big East
for almost 18-19 years, it is difficult to see such dras
tic changes," UConn coach Jim Calhoun said.
"But change does take place and, as is, becoming
evident, UConn and the other members of the new
Big East will have the best basketball league in the
country.
"It will be a great challenge for UConn and all the
schools and I am excited about the new challenges
ahead."
The actual vote for the invitation of the five
schools occurred Tuesday by the presidents of the
remaining Big East schools. That followed extensive
conference calls last week when it was finally decid
ed to go forth and extend the invitations to the five
Conference USA schools.
Tranghese, who openly criticized the ACC for
what he thought was a back door approach by the
league to expand by inviting Miami, Va. Tech and
B.C., was resolute that he and the presidents of the
Big East went about the expansion process the right
way.
"It's a difficult situation but I think we went about
it the right way," he said.
It remains to be seen if the new league can survive
what will be an unusual transitional period and
flourish. But Tranghese is confident the new Big
East can thrive.
"It's going to survive," he said. "Clearly, we're
here."
