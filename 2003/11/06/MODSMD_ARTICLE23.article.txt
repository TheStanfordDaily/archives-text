# Cardinal begins NorPac tourney
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Confidence and composure.
Those are the biggest things the
Stanford field hockey team (4-12, 2-4
Northern Pacific Conference) feels it
should bring into its next game. And
considering that its next game is its first
in the 2003 NorPac Championships, it's
no surprise that Stanford is piling on
the confidence and composure.
"We're definitely going to come out
as a completely new team and just blow
all the teams that we played in the past
away," said freshman midfielder / for
ward Cara-Lynn Lopresti. "[We're]
definitely going to win the champi
onship."
However, Stanford will not have
such an easy path to the NorPac title.
As the No. 3 seed in the Western Divi
sion, the Cardinal will first face the No.
2 seed in the East, Appalachian State
(11-7,4-2 NorPac).
But facing the Eastern Division co
champs doesn't sway the Cardinal's
confidence.
"I don't think any of the teams
we're playing this weekend are better
than us," said co-captain and senior
forward Keely Machmer-Wessels.
If the level of confidence shown by
a Stanford team that had a rough sea
son strikes you as being incredibly high,
you need only look at how the Cardinal
is approaching the tournament to un
derstand the team's sentiments.
"We're going into the tournament
with a whole new mentality," said se
nior forward and co-captain Noor Da
wood. "It almost is a totally different
season for us because how we do in this
tournament has nothing to do how we
did in the season."
In other words, the Cardinal is
putting a disappointing season be
hind it. Its newfound confidence
comes from the belief that it can start
anew without any of the regular sea
son's frustrations on its collective
mindset. After a regular season filled
with some devastating losses, this
weekend's NorPac tournament gives
the Cardinal a clean slate to work
with.
"It is our chance to do things differ
ently than we did in the season," Mach
mer-Wessels said. "It is a different
story here and it doesn't really matter
what happened last weekend or the
weekend before that."
Stanford will carry its positive atti
tude onto the field when it faces off

against Appalachian State Thursday in
St. Louis.
The Mountaineers are led by this
past week's NorPac Offensive Player
of the Week Nara Brookes, who post
ed 16 goals, six assists and 38 points on
the season. Stanford will definitely
have its eye on the National Field
Hockey Coaches Association All-Star,
especially with Brookes coming off an
outstanding week in which she scored
eight goals in the final five matches to
help her team grab a share of the East
em Division title.
The Cardinal is led by freshman Lo
presti who recorded a team high 22
points on the season.
If Stanford wins its match against
Appalachian, it will face the winner of
the match between the No. 1 seed out
of the west, California (9-3, 6-0 Nor-
Pac) and No. 4 Eastern seed St. Louis
(3-14, 1-5). The winner of that game
will then go on to Saturday's champi
onship game.
If Stanford loses to Appalachian, it
will play a consolation game Friday be
fore returning home for good.
"They're going to play each game
like it could potentially be the last, as it
is," said Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine.
Stanford has been looking forward
to playing the NorPac tournament all
season long. Its eagerness to win comes
from not only the chance it gets to pull
together its composure and confidence
to show off its great skill and ability, but
also from the fact that the winner of the
NorPac tournament has the chance to
be propelled even farther into the post
season.
The winner of the NorPac tourna
ment plays in an NCAA Play-In
Game. If Stanford wins it will partici
pate in the 16-team NCAA tourna
ment for the national title.
"It's a situation where we are huge
underdogs," Irvine said. "But in terms
of the potential of how we can play, it's
very exciting, so the challenge is
peaked right about this time."
The Cardinal last played in the
NCAA Tournament in 2000. It has
won the NorPac Championship twice
and placed second three times.
And while the Cardinal is full of
confidence, it is definitely taking the
tournament one game at a time, start
ing with Thursday's game against Ap
palachian State.
"We're not ready to be done yet,"
Machmer-Wessels said. "So it should
be a good fight there."

hind it. Its newfound confidence
comes from the belief that it can start
anew without any of the regular sea
son's frustrations on its collective
mindset. After a regular season filled
with some devastating losses, this
weekend's NorPac tournament gives
the Cardinal a clean slate to work
with.
"It is our chance to do things differ
ently than we did in the season," Mach
mer-Wessels said. "It is a different
story here and it doesn't really matter
what happened last weekend or the
weekend before that."
Stanford will carry its positive atti
tude onto the field when it faces off

against Appalachian State Thursday in
St. Louis.
The Mountaineers are led by this
past week's NorPac Offensive Player
of the Week Nara Brookes, who post
ed 16 goals, six assists and 38 points on
the season. Stanford will definitely
have its eye on the National Field
Hockey Coaches Association All-Star,
especially with Brookes coming off an
outstanding week in which she scored
eight goals in the final five matches to
help her team grab a share of the East
em Division title.
The Cardinal is led by freshman Lo
presti who recorded a team high 22
points on the season.
If Stanford wins its match against
Appalachian, it will face the winner of
the match between the No. 1 seed out
of the west, California (9-3, 6-0 Nor-
Pac) and No. 4 Eastern seed St. Louis
(3-14, 1-5). The winner of that game
will then go on to Saturday's champi
onship game.
If Stanford loses to Appalachian, it
will play a consolation game Friday be
fore returning home for good.
"They're going to play each game
like it could potentially be the last, as it
is," said Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine.
Stanford has been looking forward
to playing the NorPac tournament all
season long. Its eagerness to win comes
from not only the chance it gets to pull
together its composure and confidence
to show off its great skill and ability, but
also from the fact that the winner of the
NorPac tournament has the chance to
be propelled even farther into the post
season.
The winner of the NorPac tourna
ment plays in an NCAA Play-In
Game. If Stanford wins it will partici
pate in the 16-team NCAA tourna
ment for the national title.
"It's a situation where we are huge
underdogs," Irvine said. "But in terms
of the potential of how we can play, it's
very exciting, so the challenge is
peaked right about this time."
The Cardinal last played in the
NCAA Tournament in 2000. It has
won the NorPac Championship twice
and placed second three times.
And while the Cardinal is full of
confidence, it is definitely taking the
tournament one game at a time, start
ing with Thursday's game against Ap
palachian State.
"We're not ready to be done yet,"
Machmer-Wessels said. "So it should
be a good fight there."
