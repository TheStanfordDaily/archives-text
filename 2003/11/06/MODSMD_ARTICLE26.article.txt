# New Graduate Center poses threat to parking
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
The construction of the new Graduate Stu
dent Community Center will soon begin over
an existing parking lot near the Studio 1 grad
uate student apartments, located along Escon
dido Road.
Building should commence within two
weeks, according to Acting Dean of Students
Chris Griffith, when the County of Santa Clara
issues a final building permit.
The rapid progress in the project's develop
ment, Griffith said, is "really a testament to the
strong partnership with the students involved
in the planning and the excitement and antici
pation of creating a social center for the gradu
ate community."
The general contractor for the Center will
be Vance Brown Builders, whose previous
campus projects include the new hospital park
ing structure as well as recent renovations of
Toyon Hall, Row houses and Tresidder Union,
according to Project Manager Susan Rozakis.
Despite initial concerns about the impact
on east campus parking, students and staff are
taking the upcoming construction in stride.
"As in the past, we will work closely with
students who live in proximity to the site to
mitigate the concerns as best we can," Griffith
explained.
She added that the housing project teams
have already "met with nearby residents to
provide an overview of the construction
process and to identify available alternate

parking in proximity to their residences."
Noise and traffic are common concerns with
such building projects. Nonetheless Escondido
Road will stay open during the construction.
The University will abide by construction
regulations, and according to Rozakis, the con
struction work will not begin before 8 a.m. on
weekdays.
Rozakis said any impact on parking will be
felt most by residents of the seven Studio 1
units adjacent to the existing parking lot.
Students living in Mirrielees apartments, an
undergraduate dormitory across the street
from the future construction site, received a
notice last week via the dorm e-mail list, up
dating them on the project but anticipating
that "the impact to Mirrielees will be mini
mal."
Director of Parking and Transportation
Services Brodie Hamilton emphasized that
only the parking directly on the site will be af
fected.
The lot in front of Studio 1 is currently des
ignated for east residence permits, according
to Hamilton. He noted a "capacity in that area
to handle additional parking."
Specifically, a new Bowdoin Road lot near
the Cowell cluster and the Rains residence lots
offer more alternative parking options to resi
dents already feeling the east campus parking
crunch.
Rozakis added that established truck routes
are also posted on the Web to assist with deliv
eries.
Graduate Student Council Chair Steve Al

lison estimated that only about 35 parking
spaces will be lost.
Agreeing that the benefits far outweigh the
costs of the construction, Griffith said she be
lieves the site chosen for the Center as a "meet
ing and social gathering place" remains opti
mal.
It will be easily accessed from the Escondi
do Village and Rains communities, and also
"on the route many graduate students travel
each day," she said.
Allison said the GSC is presently working
on a building use program and deciding on
hours of operation for the Center upon its
completion, which Griffith anticipates could
be as early as summer 2004.
A goal of the GSC, Allison explained, is "to
serve as many student groups as possible and
keep the building open late at night for people
to use the pub" that is planned to be at the
heart of Escondido Village social life.
"The students I have heard from have been
excited about the new Grad Community Cen
ter, and the generosity of the donor," Rozakis
reflected.
Allison concluded that "most students rec
ognize the incredible value of the Community
Center, and they are willing to tolerate the
construction process in order to make it hap
pen."
Griffith agreed, anticipating that graduate
students will "work with us to alleviate tempo
rary inconveniences, knowing that what we're
creating will serve the community well for
years to come."
