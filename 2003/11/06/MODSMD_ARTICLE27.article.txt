# Terman Fellows announced

### FARIS MOHIUDDIN 
Recently, 10 young faculty mem
bers were named this year's Freder
ick E. Terman Fellows.
Since 1994, due to a $25 million
endowment from William Hewlett
and David Packard, the Terman fel
lowship has been conferred on
promising Stanford faculty. The fel
lowships are worth up to $100,000
for three years. The Stanford alumni
and Hewlett-Packard founders
started the fellowship in honor of
Terman, a former Stanford provost,
to whom they attribute much of then
success. Since its inception nearly a
decade ago, 72 professors have been
named Terman fellows.
The fellowship is traditionally
awarded to members in the Schools
of Humanities and Sciences, Engi
neering, Earth Sciences and Medi
cine.
"As a new professor, having fund
ing from awards like the Terman fel
lowship is really essential for getting
a research program going immedi
ately," said Materials Science and
Engineering Prof, and new Terman
fellow Nick Melosh. "Funding from
grant applications can take up to a
year from when the proposal is sub

mitted, which can be a major hurdle
for setting up a lab and starting your
research."
Beyond expediency, the fellow
ship affords young faculty newfound
opportunities to undertake more
ambitious endeavors.
"This fellowship brings a unique
opportunity in terms of funding be
cause it does not come with 'strings'
attached such as you would have
from government and industry fund
ing agencies," said Petroleum Engi
neering Prof, and earth sciences Ter
man fellow Jef Caers. "I will there
fore use it to try some of the more
riskier, but probably in the long term
more rewarding, research ideas in
my field that I would not have been
able to do without this fellowship."
Mechanical Engineering Prof,
and engineering Terman fellow
Adrian Lew explained how his fu
ture work will involve "multiscale
mechanical modeling of the cell cy
toskeleton and the modeling and op
timization of nanoscale imaging de
vices in liquids."
The School of Engineering also
recognized Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Heinz Pitsch as a 2004 fellow
while the School of Medicine's Ter
man fellowship was awarded to

Pathology Prof. Matthew Bogyo.
Beyond research, the grants can
be used to enhance the social aspect
of spurring innovation.
Mathematics Prof, and School of
Humanities and Sciences fellow
Ravi Vakil added, "More than most
other fields of study, mathematics
requires social interaction. Mathe
matical ideas are extremely dense,
so the best way to learn about the
cutting-edge is by talking one-on
one with the world expert in the sub
ject. You can't pick this stuff up pas
sively. For this reason a good portion
of research grants in mathematics go
toward inviting people to give lec
tures on their work, and organizing
conferences where experts in several
fields can come together and tell
each other the latest developments
and brainstorm."
Other School of Humanities and
Sciences winners include Profs.
Brendan Bohannan, Ian Fisher,
David Goldhaber-Gordon, and
Dmitri Petrov.
"[The Terman fellowship] is a big
help to junior faculty, and can make
a huge difference in building a ca
reer, so I'm very grateful for the op
portunities it makes possible," Vakil
said.
