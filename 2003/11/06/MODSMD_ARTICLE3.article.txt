### ELENA GEORGE DESK EDITOR 
LaDoris Cordell, Stanford's vice
provost for campus relations, was elect
ed to the Palo Alto city council on Tues
day.
Cordell, who has been a Palo Alto
resident for the past two decades, said
she hopes to be a "calming force" on the
council, which has been beset with in
fighting in the past.
"Even if people don't vote in the
same way, which is to be expected, they
can disagree without being disagree
able," she said.
Cordell beat out seven other candi
dates, including incumbent Nancy Lytle,
to win a spot on the council. She gar
nered 7,687 votes, 16.86 percent of the
total votes cast. She received approxi
mately 3,000 more votes than the closest
runner-up, Harold Justman, who
amassed 10.19 percent of the vote. The
three other city councilmen elected —
Judy Kleinberg, Dena Mossar and Bern
Beecham — were all incumbents run
ning for re-election.
Prior to accepting her position as vice
provost, Cordell spent almost 20 years as
a judge, both in the municipal court and
the superior court of Santa Clara Coun
ty-
There are four city councilmen, each
serving a term of four years. The posi
tion is part time and unpaid.
Cordell ran a grassroots campaign.
She received no money from outside
sources, preferring to fund the campaign
herself, on a budget of only $3,000.
Cordell said this decision will allow
her to "bring independence to the coun
cil."
As to some of her other goals for im
provement of Palo Alto and its methods
of governance, Cordell said that Palo
Alto's city government tends to become
mired in bureaucratic inefficiency re
ferred to as the "Palo Alto City process."
"I'm hoping there will be less process
and more progress," she said.
