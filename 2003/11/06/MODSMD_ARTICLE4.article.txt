# Ads spark controversy throughout campus
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
A group of students began circu
lating an e-mail petition yesterday
asking for the recall of Daily Editor in
Chief Ramin Setoodeh, after The
Daily decided to continue running a
series of controversial advertisements
from a pro-Israeli group.
The ads, which have run in many
college newspapers nationwide, have
attracted campus attention over the
past two weeks for claims some stu
dents say are anti-Palestinian. One ad
depicts Israelis lighting candles in re
membrance of Sept. 11 victims, under
the words, "On September 11, 2001,
Israelis mourned in Tel-Aviv." Next
to it is a photo showing Palestinian
men and children cheering, beneath
the text, "On September 11, 2001,
Palestinians celebrated in Lebanon."
Each of the ads claim, "There are
two sides to every story, but only one
truth."
"The advertisement suggests that
all Palestinians are inhumane and

they revel in the shedding of innocent
blood," wrote the group, called the
Coalition for Justice, in a letter at
tached to the petition.
The coalition contends that the ad
violates The Daily's advertising poli
cy, which states that the newspaper
will refrain from printing any ad that
"casts aspersions on individuals or
groups on the basis of race, religion,
sexual preference, national origin,
age, physical disability, or other in
vidious grounds."
But Setoodeh said the ads do not
violate The Daily's policy.
"I don't think the ads are racist,"
he said, pointing out that he is Middle
Eastern.
Blanket statements?
After meeting with members of
the coalition, Setoodeh chose to con
tinue running the ads and wrote an
editorial in Tuesday's Daily explain
ing the decision.
