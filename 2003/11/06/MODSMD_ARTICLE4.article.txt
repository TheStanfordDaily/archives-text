# Ads spark controversy throughout campus
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
A group of students began circu
lating an e-mail petition yesterday
asking for the recall of Daily Editor in
Chief Ramin Setoodeh, after The
Daily decided to continue running a
series of controversial advertisements
from a pro-Israeli group.
The ads, which have run in many
college newspapers nationwide, have
attracted campus attention over the
past two weeks for claims some stu
dents say are anti-Palestinian. One ad
depicts Israelis lighting candles in re
membrance of Sept. 11 victims, under
the words, "On September 11, 2001,
Israelis mourned in Tel-Aviv." Next
to it is a photo showing Palestinian
men and children cheering, beneath
the text, "On September 11, 2001,
Palestinians celebrated in Lebanon."
Each of the ads claim, "There are
two sides to every story, but only one
truth."
"The advertisement suggests that
all Palestinians are inhumane and

they revel in the shedding of innocent
blood," wrote the group, called the
Coalition for Justice, in a letter at
tached to the petition.
The coalition contends that the ad
violates The Daily's advertising poli
cy, which states that the newspaper
will refrain from printing any ad that
"casts aspersions on individuals or
groups on the basis of race, religion,
sexual preference, national origin,
age, physical disability, or other in
vidious grounds."
But Setoodeh said the ads do not
violate The Daily's policy.
"I don't think the ads are racist,"
he said, pointing out that he is Middle
Eastern.
Blanket statements?
After meeting with members of
the coalition, Setoodeh chose to con
tinue running the ads and wrote an
editorial in Tuesday's Daily explain
ing the decision.
"It is our duty as a newspaper to base
our judgment on facts alone â€” and what is
explicitly presented in an advertisement,"
he wrote in the editorial, arguing that "the
ads do not make any derogatory blanket
statements about the Israeli and Palestin
ian populations."
But according to Mohammed Esam, a
mechanical engineering graduate student
and president of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University, that claim is "not ac
curate."
"The ads are very offensive, very
racist," he said. "They're trying to demo
nize a whole population, and to play off the
pain of Sept. 11 is unacceptable."
The coalition has collected 300 signa
tures on a previous petition asking The
Daily to stop running the ads. According to
coalition member Ammar Nayfeh, the
number of signatures on the petition to re
call Setoodeh was not available as of last
night.

The Daily said it would not be possible
for the coalition to recall Setoodeh
through its petition unless it garnered sig
natures from a certain number of Daily
staffers.
The newspaper's bylaws state that an
editor in chief can be recalled either
through a majority vote by the Board of
Directors or a written petition signed by at
least 20 percent of the previous quarter's
staff, if they feel that the editor in chief has
"repeatedly taken action inconsistent with
the purposes of the corporation."
"This recall has started because they
disagree with me, not because I've made a
decision that is unethical or journalistical
ly wrong," Setoodeh said.
The coalition disagreed.
"He has failed his community and failed
as a leader," it wrote in the petition.
"I was disappointed that The Daily
would print the ads. I had higher expecta
tions for The Daily," Esam said.
Nationwide controversy
Over the past several months, the series
of ads from the One Truth Foundation has
stirred controversy at many campus news

papers that have chosen to print them, in
cluding, The Daily Northwestern, The
Cornell Daily Sun and The Yale Daily
News.
The most controversial ad, which The
Daily did not print, shows an Israeli
Olympic athlete beneath the text, "Israeli
schoolchildren's hero," and an Islamic ter
rorist beneath the text, "Palestinian
schoolchildren's hero."
The Daily deemed that particular ad
unfit for publication because of what it
considered to be a lack of factual substan
tiation for the ad's claims, Setoodeh said.
The Daily Northwestern chose to run 10
ads from the One Truth Foundation, in
cluding the "heroes" ad.
"We consider ourselves a forum for
ideas, so we didn't want to restrict ideas,
even one so blatantly one-sided or border
line racist as this one is," said senior Adam
Williams, the newspaper's editor in chief.
Setoodeh agreed, pointing to a contro
versial decision made a few years ago by
The Washington Post to run an ad claiming
that homosexuality can be cured.
"As a newspaper, we provide an open
forum for different viewpoints," he said.
"For us to silence one view would be

counter to what newspapers stand for."
The Coalition for Justice said its goal is
not to censor The Daily.
. "We are neither against free speech nor
freedom of press. We celebrate the rights
of people to hold controversial opinions
and to express those opinions openly," it
said in a statement. "However, we feel that
these advertisements went far beyond con
troversy and into the realm of unaccept
able ignorance, intolerance and hatred."
The Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Univer
sity's independent daily newspaper, also
decided not to run the "heroes" ad but has
been running the ad depicting Sept. 11 re
actions.
"Personally, I find the Tel Aviv vs.
Lebanon ad kind of offensive as well," said
Nate Brown, editor in chief of the Cornell
Daily Sun. "But editorially, I'm not sure
that the majority of people would find that
to be hate speech, per se."
Students at Cornell have not reacted
strongly to the ads in the Daily Sun, Brown
said.
But last year, newspapers at UC-San
Diego, the University of Arizona, the Uni
versity of Michigan, the University of
Chicago and Rutgers University decided

to pull some or all of the ads in response to
campus outcry.
"We must reconsider running the ads if
the University community does not want
them," Michigan Daily Business Manager
Jeff Valuck told The Michigan Daily in
March.
According to The Daily, representa
tives from the coalition met with Setoodeh
and Daily Business Manager Ezra Calla
han on two separate occasions over the
past week to argue their case, claiming that
the ads are very offensive and should no
longer run.
Callahan said that while The Daily's
business staff expected the ads to offend
some members of the Stanford communi
ty, it originally saw the ads as politically,
not racially, motivated.
"It never crossed anyone's mind on first
reading that they were racist," he said. "It
was a bit of a surprise at first when people
reacted the way that they did. We were
forced to re-examine them on that level
and approach it from a way that we hadn't
looked at it before."
According to Setoodeh, the ads will run
for their scheduled duration of five weeks,
ending on Nov. 21.
