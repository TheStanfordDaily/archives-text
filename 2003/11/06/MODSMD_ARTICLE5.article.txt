# More Republicans on campuses, poll reveals
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent Harvard poll has found
that Republican college students out
number Democrats.
The poll of 1,202 college students
found that 61 percent give President
George W. Bush a positive job ap
proval rating with 38 percent disap
proving while the general public was
evenly split on the President's job
performance. With regard to political
affiliations of college students, the

poll found that 31 percent were Re
publicans, 27 percent Democrats, 38
percent Independent and 4 percent
refused to identify their affiliation.
Students affiliated with one of the
minor parties were listed under inde
pendent. However, the sentiment
among Stanford students appeared to
reflect the traditional stereotype of
the liberal college student.
Political Science Prof. Morris Fior
ina said he was not surprised at the
poll's findings.
"It's not an accurate stereo
type," he said. "It's more liberal at
the Stanfords and Harvards. The
Oklahomas and the Ohio States
are more conservative."
Prof. Terry Moe, also of the po
litical science department, made a
similar speculation.
"The stereotype comes from
certain institutions — the most vis
ible and most prominent," he said.
"There are many, many colleges in
the country and perhaps the typical
student is more conservative."
Freshman Amol Helekar, who
is unaffiliated with any political
party, also said he made that obser
vation.
"I think that to a certain extent
that's true," he said. "One, because
we're close to the Bay Area and
two, the students here get in be
cause they do things like communi
ty service, which are naturally asso
ciated with leftist things. To a cer
tain extent, the people who come
into Stanford are more liberal, but
I'm not sure it's as liberal as the
general perception is. I mean stu
dents here are obviously, social lib
erals. That wouldn't be true at a
university like Baylor University
or some universities in the South
would be socially conservative."
Freshman Alex Medearis, a reg
istered independent, questioned
the poll's accuracy, but did agree
with the others that Stanford is
more liberal than other colleges in
the country.
"I think that Stanford is liberal
because California is left-leaning,"
Medearis said. "The professors
tend to be more to the left. The
reputation's a little bit more liber
al, so in that sense, that's reflected
in the student body. I think it's ob
vious Stanford has a reputation of
being a more liberal school. Pretty
much every top school in the coun
try has a reputation of being more
liberal."
"The liberal students are more
outspoken at the elite colleges, so
they dominate the political debate
at these campuses," said junior Joe
Fairbanks, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans. "I think

most students are politically apa
thetic. I think for most colleges that
it's not that they're more liberal,
it's just that the liberal students are
better at speaking up."
Sophomore Gina Bateson, com
munications director of the Stan
ford Democrats, disagreed with
Fairbanks.
According to Bateson, "1,000
students were in the anti-war strike
last spring, compared with five Re
publicans at the affirmative action
bake sale."
Bateson speculated that many
of the independents in the Harvard
poll may have been liberals who
were in the Green Party or liberals
who simply choose not to be affili
ated with a party, such as herself.
"I'm registered as an indepen
dent, but my views are strongly in
line with the Democratic Party,"
she said.
The Stanford College Republi
cans have 450 members while the
Stanford Democrats have 530
members. Officers from both
groups said there were, however,
other groups on their respective
end of the political spectrum, so
the numbers were probably low, in
terms of students who agree with
those groups.
Bateson said the most accurate
way to find out the political opin
ions on campus would be to find
out from the Registrar of Voters
how people voted at the two on
campus precincts.
The Harvard poll, conducted by
its Institute of Politics, also found
that students were nearly evenly
split in their opinion of the direc
tion of the nation. 46 percent felt
the nation was headed in the right
direction while 43 percent believed
the nation was on the wrong track.
39 percent of students would
vote to reelect President Bush, 34
percent would vote for a Democra
tic candidate and 18 percent were
undecided. 58 percent supported
the decision to go to war in Iraq
while 37 percent opposed it.
Fairbanks said, "I am very
pleased to see that, outside Stan
ford, at least, most college students
agree with the President and be
lieve that he is doing a great job
leading the country."
Although most students sup
ported the initial decision to
launch the war against Saddam

Hussein, 48 percent believe that
some American soldiers should be
withdrawn from Iraq, 8 percent
support complete withdrawal, 33
percent feel there is an adequate
number of troops and 7 percent
support an increased presence. On
the other hand, 60 percent believe
it is likely that Saddam Hussein
was involved in the terrorist at
tacks of Sept. 11, 2001, while 38
percent believe it is not likely.
Bateson, Fairbanks and Fiorina said
that the attacks upon the World Trade
Center, the Pentagon and Flight 93 prob
ably did have an impact upon student
opinions.
"I think, at least at Stanford,
Bush's war policies have generated
new student activism, primarily on
the left," Bateson said.
Fairbanks and Fiorina said the
policies had the opposite influence.
"I would probably say 9-11
probably did influence this
change," Fairbanks said. "They
have seen President Bush's leader
ship, which gave him a boost be
cause they felt safe with him in
there leading the nation."
"The one other thing that struck me
was that this younger generation was
struck harder by 9-11 than the older gen
erations," Fiorina said. "This generation
was raised in a more peaceful time and
the realization hit this younger genera
tion hard," Fiorina said. "Some of the
support reflected 9-11."
He said that many students had
appeared more depressed than
angry about the attacks and that
many students now support Presi
dent Bush because he is trying to
do something to protect them.
This shift towards conservatism
was not due simply to terrorism,
Fiorina said, because this trend had
been evident since at least the
1980s.
"Since Reagan, young people have
beentaoving towards the right," he said.
"There are more Republicans in the
younger generation than their older co
horts in the electorate. This is a '60s
stereotype. There are a surprising num
ber who hold traditional views."
Fiorina said that polls of his
classes had found that half of his
students believe in heaven and hell
and one-fourth of his students were
born-again Christians. The Har
vard poll found that 26 percent of
students nationally are born-again
Christians.

vious Stanford has a reputation of
being a more liberal school. Pretty
much every top school in the coun
try has a reputation of being more
liberal."
"The liberal students are more
outspoken at the elite colleges, so
they dominate the political debate
at these campuses," said junior Joe
Fairbanks, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans. "I think

most students are politically apa
thetic. I think for most colleges that
it's not that they're more liberal,
it's just that the liberal students are
better at speaking up."
Sophomore Gina Bateson, com
munications director of the Stan
ford Democrats, disagreed with
Fairbanks.
According to Bateson, "1,000
students were in the anti-war strike
last spring, compared with five Re
publicans at the affirmative action
bake sale."
Bateson speculated that many
of the independents in the Harvard
poll may have been liberals who
were in the Green Party or liberals
who simply choose not to be affili
ated with a party, such as herself.
"I'm registered as an indepen
dent, but my views are strongly in
line with the Democratic Party,"
she said.
The Stanford College Republi
cans have 450 members while the
Stanford Democrats have 530
members. Officers from both
groups said there were, however,
other groups on their respective
end of the political spectrum, so
the numbers were probably low, in
terms of students who agree with
those groups.
Bateson said the most accurate
way to find out the political opin
ions on campus would be to find
out from the Registrar of Voters
how people voted at the two on
campus precincts.
The Harvard poll, conducted by
its Institute of Politics, also found
that students were nearly evenly
split in their opinion of the direc
tion of the nation. 46 percent felt
the nation was headed in the right
direction while 43 percent believed
the nation was on the wrong track.
39 percent of students would
vote to reelect President Bush, 34
percent would vote for a Democra
tic candidate and 18 percent were
undecided. 58 percent supported
the decision to go to war in Iraq
while 37 percent opposed it.
Fairbanks said, "I am very
pleased to see that, outside Stan
ford, at least, most college students
agree with the President and be
lieve that he is doing a great job
leading the country."
Although most students sup
ported the initial decision to
launch the war against Saddam

Hussein, 48 percent believe that
some American soldiers should be
withdrawn from Iraq, 8 percent
support complete withdrawal, 33
percent feel there is an adequate
number of troops and 7 percent
support an increased presence. On
the other hand, 60 percent believe
it is likely that Saddam Hussein
was involved in the terrorist at
tacks of Sept. 11, 2001, while 38
percent believe it is not likely.
Bateson, Fairbanks and Fiorina said
that the attacks upon the World Trade
Center, the Pentagon and Flight 93 prob
ably did have an impact upon student
opinions.
"I think, at least at Stanford,
Bush's war policies have generated
new student activism, primarily on
the left," Bateson said.
Fairbanks and Fiorina said the
policies had the opposite influence.
"I would probably say 9-11
probably did influence this
change," Fairbanks said. "They
have seen President Bush's leader
ship, which gave him a boost be
cause they felt safe with him in
there leading the nation."
"The one other thing that struck me
was that this younger generation was
struck harder by 9-11 than the older gen
erations," Fiorina said. "This generation
was raised in a more peaceful time and
the realization hit this younger genera
tion hard," Fiorina said. "Some of the
support reflected 9-11."
He said that many students had
appeared more depressed than
angry about the attacks and that
many students now support Presi
dent Bush because he is trying to
do something to protect them.
This shift towards conservatism
was not due simply to terrorism,
Fiorina said, because this trend had
been evident since at least the
1980s.
"Since Reagan, young people have
beentaoving towards the right," he said.
"There are more Republicans in the
younger generation than their older co
horts in the electorate. This is a '60s
stereotype. There are a surprising num
ber who hold traditional views."
Fiorina said that polls of his
classes had found that half of his
students believe in heaven and hell
and one-fourth of his students were
born-again Christians. The Har
vard poll found that 26 percent of
students nationally are born-again
Christians.
A recent Harvard poll has found
that Republican college students out
number Democrats.
The poll of 1,202 college students
found that 61 percent give President
George W. Bush a positive job ap
proval rating with 38 percent disap
proving while the general public was
evenly split on the President's job
performance. With regard to political
affiliations of college students, the

poll found that 31 percent were Re
publicans, 27 percent Democrats, 38
percent Independent and 4 percent
refused to identify their affiliation.
Students affiliated with one of the
minor parties were listed under inde
pendent. However, the sentiment
among Stanford students appeared to
reflect the traditional stereotype of
the liberal college student.
Political Science Prof. Morris Fior
ina said he was not surprised at the
poll's findings.
"It's not an accurate stereo
type," he said. "It's more liberal at
the Stanfords and Harvards. The
Oklahomas and the Ohio States
are more conservative."
Prof. Terry Moe, also of the po
litical science department, made a
similar speculation.
"The stereotype comes from
certain institutions — the most vis
ible and most prominent," he said.
"There are many, many colleges in
the country and perhaps the typical
student is more conservative."
Freshman Amol Helekar, who
is unaffiliated with any political
party, also said he made that obser
vation.
"I think that to a certain extent
that's true," he said. "One, because
we're close to the Bay Area and
two, the students here get in be
cause they do things like communi
ty service, which are naturally asso
ciated with leftist things. To a cer
tain extent, the people who come
into Stanford are more liberal, but
I'm not sure it's as liberal as the
general perception is. I mean stu
dents here are obviously, social lib
erals. That wouldn't be true at a
university like Baylor University
or some universities in the South
would be socially conservative."
Freshman Alex Medearis, a reg
istered independent, questioned
the poll's accuracy, but did agree
with the others that Stanford is
more liberal than other colleges in
the country.
"I think that Stanford is liberal
because California is left-leaning,"
Medearis said. "The professors
tend to be more to the left. The
reputation's a little bit more liber
al, so in that sense, that's reflected
in the student body. I think it's ob
vious Stanford has a reputation of
being a more liberal school. Pretty
