## HOW TO SAY 'I LOVE YOU' TO YOUR BEAU 
### 
You guys are really start
ing to piss me off. No
one's e-mailing me. No
one's asking me ques
tions. No one seems to care. How's a
boy suppose to give sex advice when
no one's asking for any? And don't
give me that "my sex life is perfect"
line. No one's sex life is perfect; sex
is too complicated for it to always be

perfect. And even
if it were, there's
always something
more to ask like
"How can I show
Billy a better
time?" or "Is she
going to like it if I.
.. on her ... while
upside down?"
Will someone
please e-mail me
with a specific

problem, because until then I have
to talk in generalities about general
topics like "the general way to tell
someone you like them," our topic
for today.
Does she like me? Is he really inter
ested in me or just my body? What
would she do if Ijust pushed her against
a wall, leaned in and kissed her?
All these thoughts have gone
through our heads at various times,
producing sweaty palms and upset
stomachs. We've been kept up late
at night thinking about them, been
distracted by them in class, in short,
there have been times when these
thoughts have dominated every as
pect of our lives.
But fear not, for, as I'm sure many
of you have figured out, liking some
one doesn't have to be that brutal.
Like just about anything that smacks
of sex, it can and should be fun.
First off, don't be shy. It is better
to have told and been shot down,
than to have never told at all. If
you're sitting in your room late at
night, dominated by thoughts of a
particular someone, yet your various
fears of rejection keep you from
doing anything about it, you're being
Stupid with a capital S. Get over it.
Do something. The worst that could
happen is utter rejection, humilia
tion, degradation... things that, if
you think about it, are nothing com
pared to the pain and suffering of
silently liking someone.
Directly telling someone you like
him or her is analogous to quickly
pulling off a Band-Aid: The pain is
intense but after a fraction of a sec
ond it's over and you feel better. If
you have a friend or close acquain
tance that you've liked for a while,
then this is the way to go. Just get it
and tell the person.
The key to this kind of direct ac
tion is to go in not expecting anything.
You don't have to be pessimistic, but
if you decide consciously to tell them,
not to see if they like you in return,
but to get the burden of silently liking
someone off your shoulders, then you
can't loose. Whether they end up lik
ing you or not, you are no longer one
of those lame rejects that silently likes
someone.
The other, better way to go, is to
take the mature route and let the per
son know how you feel non-verbally
as soon as you start to like them. If
you meet someone and you think "I
want this girl prostrate in my bed
right now so that I can do bad things
to her" or if you're thinking "This
boy is really cute, I wonder if he'll let
me kiss him on the cheek," give him
or her a sign.
I'm not talking about a slap on
the ass, but look into their eyes for
longer than you should, more often
then you should, smile a lot and do
something uncommonly nice for
them. If they're not completely
Stupid, also with a capital S, they'll
get the idea, and you might just get a
date. Either way, you won't be stuck
in the proverbial rut of an unvoiced,
one-way relationship.
So, if you like someone just let
them know in one way or another if
not for the fact that it will save you
on total pain experienced and might
actually turn out well, then for the
life lesson that it is the things in life
that we choose not to do and not the
things we choose to do that we later
regret the most.
