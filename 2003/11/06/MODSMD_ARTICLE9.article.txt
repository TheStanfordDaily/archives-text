# It's a Love Shack, Baby

### KATHRYN MCGARR 
I've been at Stanford for less than two months. I don't know when
to jump during "All Right Now," I don't know who or what The Dish
is and I can't figure out what magical mystery source funds The Stan
ford Review (although that last befuddlement might not be exclusive
to me). So this is one of those I'm-a-naive-freshman articles rather
than a research piece or something I'll want to admit to having written
three years from now when I'm a senior.
Keeping that in mind, I would like to share the two absolute cer
tainties I have unearthed since coming here. The first truism is that no
one dates at Stanford — you can disagree, but everyone from the
RA's children to the professors has at least heard it. This first point
wouldn't be so extraordinarily puzzling to me if it weren't for the sec
ond "fact," which is that everyone also has sex at Stanford.
"Everyone" is an overstatement, according to "The Real World:
Stanford," which told us during its orientation presentation that only
(only! she says) 80 percent of Stanford students are sexually active.
The context of that statistic was that abstainers (or as we prefer,
"losers") shouldn't feel alone in their abstinence. If that was what they
were going for, "The Real World" needs a reality check because four
fifths of the student body is no drop in The Dish, my pet.
At the same time, I'll wager that far less than 80 percent of the
freshman class is already sexually active. In fact, I was going to wager
something along the lines of 30 percent, but as I said, I'm a (ridicu
lously) naive freshman and the actual statistic that I just found floating
around that cultural abyss called the Internet is 61 percent. Boy, do I
feel stupid and not at all on the sexual gravy train. But that doesn't re
ally matter. The material point is that, ultimately, some amount of
people will first become sexually active in college. Stanford drives
them to it.
So what's the reason? It can be summed up in five little letters, and
they aren't R-a-w-l-s, No, they're SHPRC (Sexual Health Peer Re
search Center for the other losers out there). I think it's great that
we've got an SHPRC — it's peachy that we can get 12 free condoms
every single quarter. That's 36 safe sex encounters in one academic
year, which can even be doubled to 72 if the safe sex encounters are
with other registered students with valid ID cards. Wow, what a lot of
sex. (Yet that's the equivalent of 24 Wilbur Dining points I should
have coming to me, assuming I never redeem the condoms and that
the world is a fair and just place). Counseling and information on STD
testing is also very important — it's super cool that they offer it.
But the SHPRC is also responsible for freaking out naive freshmen
by telling them that 80 percent of students are sexually active, thereby
pressuring losers to go have random sex. Because when there's a room
of five people, and when more than one of those five people are vir
gins, a wrong should be righted. Statistics just don't lie.
Plus, there's a Dish-load of other stuff that you can get at the
SHPRC that sounds a little sketch. Like lube samples, which my
roommate just explained to me is short for lubricant samples, and
massage oils. SHPRC, you've made me feel (ridiculously) naive for
not knowing what lube samples are, and it's just further ingraining
into my head the message that I should hop on board the sexmo
bile and re-enter a society that progressed, even as it left me and
Gidget behind in 1959.
And then there are all the other people out there who actually do
know what lube samples are and will now be frequenting the SHPRC
to obtain them. It's no wonder so many students are sexually active
with all this propaganda.
A girl can't even go to the bathroom anymore without reading
about the SHPRC. Hie Aids Treatment Access Initiative posted a
flyer. Its first statistic: No more than one third of the Stanford student
body visited the SHPRC for contraception last year. I first read that
stat and thought how nice it was that only one third of the campus was
sexually active. Silly is the teenager who still doesn't get that sex is the
word around here. Hence, according to this group, if people aren't vis
iting the SHPRC, it couldn't possibly be because they're going out for
malteds and catching a movie on Saturday nights — it must be be
cause they're having unsafe sex.
Brainwashed students jump to these unhappy, but apparently true,
conclusions. Brainwashed students jump into bed with each other.
Brainwashed students jump up, jump up and get down.
I have no final plea to make because, in the end, I really don't care
if Stanford undergraduates have sex until The Dish comes home. I
only wish it weren't taken so for granted that a lot of students have a
lot of sex, that it's normal to be "sexiled" by your roommate and that
Gidget and I are in a vast minority down here on the Farm.

fifths of the student body is no drop in The Dish, my pet.
At the same time, I'll wager that far less than 80 percent of the
freshman class is already sexually active. In fact, I was going to wager
something along the lines of 30 percent, but as I said, I'm a (ridicu
lously) naive freshman and the actual statistic that I just found floating
around that cultural abyss called the Internet is 61 percent. Boy, do I
feel stupid and not at all on the sexual gravy train. But that doesn't re
ally matter. The material point is that, ultimately, some amount of
people will first become sexually active in college. Stanford drives
them to it.
So what's the reason? It can be summed up in five little letters, and
they aren't R-a-w-l-s, No, they're SHPRC (Sexual Health Peer Re
search Center for the other losers out there). I think it's great that
we've got an SHPRC — it's peachy that we can get 12 free condoms
every single quarter. That's 36 safe sex encounters in one academic
year, which can even be doubled to 72 if the safe sex encounters are
with other registered students with valid ID cards. Wow, what a lot of
sex. (Yet that's the equivalent of 24 Wilbur Dining points I should
have coming to me, assuming I never redeem the condoms and that
the world is a fair and just place). Counseling and information on STD
testing is also very important — it's super cool that they offer it.
But the SHPRC is also responsible for freaking out naive freshmen
by telling them that 80 percent of students are sexually active, thereby
pressuring losers to go have random sex. Because when there's a room
of five people, and when more than one of those five people are vir
gins, a wrong should be righted. Statistics just don't lie.
Plus, there's a Dish-load of other stuff that you can get at the
SHPRC that sounds a little sketch. Like lube samples, which my
roommate just explained to me is short for lubricant samples, and
massage oils. SHPRC, you've made me feel (ridiculously) naive for
not knowing what lube samples are, and it's just further ingraining
into my head the message that I should hop on board the sexmo
bile and re-enter a society that progressed, even as it left me and
Gidget behind in 1959.
And then there are all the other people out there who actually do
know what lube samples are and will now be frequenting the SHPRC
to obtain them. It's no wonder so many students are sexually active
with all this propaganda.
A girl can't even go to the bathroom anymore without reading
about the SHPRC. Hie Aids Treatment Access Initiative posted a
flyer. Its first statistic: No more than one third of the Stanford student
body visited the SHPRC for contraception last year. I first read that
stat and thought how nice it was that only one third of the campus was
sexually active. Silly is the teenager who still doesn't get that sex is the
word around here. Hence, according to this group, if people aren't vis
iting the SHPRC, it couldn't possibly be because they're going out for
malteds and catching a movie on Saturday nights — it must be be
cause they're having unsafe sex.
Brainwashed students jump to these unhappy, but apparently true,
conclusions. Brainwashed students jump into bed with each other.
Brainwashed students jump up, jump up and get down.
I have no final plea to make because, in the end, I really don't care
if Stanford undergraduates have sex until The Dish comes home. I
only wish it weren't taken so for granted that a lot of students have a
lot of sex, that it's normal to be "sexiled" by your roommate and that
Gidget and I are in a vast minority down here on the Farm.
