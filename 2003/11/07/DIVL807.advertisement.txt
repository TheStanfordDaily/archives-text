for your
Student Group!
On Sunday, April 4, 2004, the Office of the President and
Provost will sponsor Community Day at Stanford, a university
wide open house for Stanford's neighbors. Community Day
planners are looking for student organizations to participate by
setting up an exhibit or running a program of interest to our
visitors. Registered student groups that are able to educate,
entertain or involve Stanford's neighbors are encouraged to
apply. Performance groups will be hired separately.
To find out more, or to print out an application, visit online at

or call Ryan Foley at 6-2210.
