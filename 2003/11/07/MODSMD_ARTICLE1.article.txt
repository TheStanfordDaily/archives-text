# Card looks for victory
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
As the Cardinal football team comes off
a win that it hopes marks a resurgence, the
opponent that brought it all crashing down in
the first place comes to town.
Arizona State (4-5,1-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) visits the Farm tomorrow, and Stan
ford (3-4,1-4) can only hope the results are
more fortuitous than last year in Tempe,
Ariz., when the Cardinal lost, 65-24.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils who are coming off a 51-23 loss to
California are not the team they were
last year, having struggled and battled in
juries all season long. Payback for last year's
contest in which the Sun Devils scored
the most points in their Pac-10 history is
definitely on the Cardinal's mind.
"I think it's good to remember the previ
ous year," said sophomore linebacker
Michael Craven. "It makes me mad to re

member how bad we got beat. I remember
walking off the field with our heads hanging
low. We'll be ready this week."
In that game, the upstart Sun Devils
stunned and dismantled the Cardinal,
running wild on offense as Shaun Mc-
Donald (now in the NFL) racked up 221
receiving yards. The sheer scale of the
loss 41 points shocked a Stanford
team that, the game before, had done the
same thing to San Jose State, winning 63-
26 in Stanford Stadium. No one really
saw it coming, as Stanford entered the
Sun Devils contest as an even-money
pick to win.
The loss did not sit well with the Cardinal,
which never really recovered, losing seven of
its last eight games.
After last year's game, wide receiver
Teyo Johnson (now in the NFL) said that the
Cardinal was taken by surprise.
"I've never lost a game that bad in my
entire life in all the sports that I've played,"

he said. "We looked at the fact that we beat
ASU before and just looked past this Sat
urday. We took the last three years for
granted."
Stanford has long since stopped taking
things for granted. Arizona State, thanks to
its breakout eight-win performance last year,
was ranked in the Top 25 to begin this sea
son, but has done little but disappoint since
then, winning just one conference game.
Interestingly, that win was a 59-14 explo
sion against Oregon, the same team that shut
out the Cardinal 35-0 two weeks ago.
Regardless, Koetter isn't taking Stanford
lightly this week.
'"Mien you get eight sacks in a game and
knock off a team that's leading the confer
ence, that says a lot," Koetter said about
Stanford's 21-14 upset of UCLA last week.
"I'm not sugarcoating it at all when I say that
you can tell on tape that those guys play hard
