# Card looks for victory
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
As the Cardinal football team comes off
a win that it hopes marks a resurgence, the
opponent that brought it all crashing down in
the first place comes to town.
Arizona State (4-5,1-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) visits the Farm tomorrow, and Stan
ford (3-4,1-4) can only hope the results are
more fortuitous than last year in Tempe,
Ariz., when the Cardinal lost, 65-24.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils who are coming off a 51-23 loss to
California are not the team they were
last year, having struggled and battled in
juries all season long. Payback for last year's
contest in which the Sun Devils scored
the most points in their Pac-10 history is
definitely on the Cardinal's mind.
"I think it's good to remember the previ
ous year," said sophomore linebacker
Michael Craven. "It makes me mad to re

member how bad we got beat. I remember
walking off the field with our heads hanging
low. We'll be ready this week."
In that game, the upstart Sun Devils
stunned and dismantled the Cardinal,
running wild on offense as Shaun Mc-
Donald (now in the NFL) racked up 221
receiving yards. The sheer scale of the
loss 41 points shocked a Stanford
team that, the game before, had done the
same thing to San Jose State, winning 63-
26 in Stanford Stadium. No one really
saw it coming, as Stanford entered the
Sun Devils contest as an even-money
pick to win.
The loss did not sit well with the Cardinal,
which never really recovered, losing seven of
its last eight games.
After last year's game, wide receiver
Teyo Johnson (now in the NFL) said that the
Cardinal was taken by surprise.
"I've never lost a game that bad in my
entire life in all the sports that I've played,"

he said. "We looked at the fact that we beat
ASU before and just looked past this Sat
urday. We took the last three years for
granted."
Stanford has long since stopped taking
things for granted. Arizona State, thanks to
its breakout eight-win performance last year,
was ranked in the Top 25 to begin this sea
son, but has done little but disappoint since
then, winning just one conference game.
Interestingly, that win was a 59-14 explo
sion against Oregon, the same team that shut
out the Cardinal 35-0 two weeks ago.
Regardless, Koetter isn't taking Stanford
lightly this week.
'"Mien you get eight sacks in a game and
knock off a team that's leading the confer
ence, that says a lot," Koetter said about
Stanford's 21-14 upset of UCLA last week.
"I'm not sugarcoating it at all when I say that
you can tell on tape that those guys play hard

and fly around."
The matchup against Arizona State
will certainly present different chal
lenges than the Bruins did. UCLA
plays a conservative, field-position ori
ented type of football that played to
Stanford's strengths solid defense
and a methodical offense.
The Sun Devils, though, have made
a name for themselves as an aggressive,
explosive team, keying on big plays and
gambling for turnovers.
"I look at Arizona State as a break
out type of team, with big-play capa
bilities any time they touch the foot
ball," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "Defensively, they're
aggressive and very athletic in all
spots. Again, it will be a team effort
preparing for ASU."
One thing that may work in the
Cardinal's favor is the health of Sun
Devils standout quarterback Andrew
Walter, who rang up 414 yards against
Stanford last year. Walter will get the
start despite a sore ankle and other
minor problems.
This season, Walter has thrown
for 238 yards per game, 16 touch
downs and eight interceptions. De
spite his injuries, those numbers are
comparable to last year's, when he to
taled 277 yards per game.
On the ground, the Sun Devils, like
Stanford, go with a two-back approach.
Loren Wade is averaging 5.6 yards per
carry and is averaging 66 yards per
game, while Hakim Hill is averaging 4.0
yards per carry for 49 yards per game.
Walter relies mostly on two favorite

receivers, Derek Hagan and Skyler
Fulton, to whom he has completed
more than half of his passes this year.
Hagan has caught 47 balls this season,
while Fulton's 45 receptions have yield
ed a team-leading eight touchdowns.
Standout junior safety Jason Shiv
ers leads the Arizona State defense
with a whopping 80 tackles and three
interceptions, both team highs.
Stanford will start fifth-year senior
Chris Lewis at quarterback for the third
straight game, with redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards serving as the backup.
Lewis, in five games played, has com
pleted 47-of-96 passes for 478 yards,
three touchdowns and six intercep
tions, His favorite target, senior wide
out Luke Powell, has caught 32 balls
this year for 345 yards and two scores,
leading the team in those categories.
Junior Kenneth Tolon is averaging
65 yards per game on the ground on 3.6
yards per carry, while sophomore J.R.
Lemon has chipped in 30 yards per
game on a 4.0 average.
Stanford's special teams, which
sprung Luke Powell for a 90-yard punt
return touchdown last week, will need
to focus this week against an Arizona
State squad that tends to burn through
a lot of possessions.
Despite all the emotions this week
payback for last year, the positivi
ty offered by last week's win, a chance
to get back to .500 Teevens wants
his team to approach this week like
any other.
"When you do [win], you're ob
viously excited about it, but you
put it behind you," he said. "Just
put it behind and go to work on the
next opportunity."

a win that it hopes marks a resurgence, the
opponent that brought it all crashing down in
the first place comes to town.
Arizona State (4-5,1-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) visits the Farm tomorrow, and Stan
ford (3-4,1-4) can only hope the results are
more fortuitous than last year in Tempe,
Ariz., when the Cardinal lost, 65-24.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils who are coming off a 51-23 loss to
California are not the team they were
last year, having struggled and battled in
juries all season long. Payback for last year's
contest in which the Sun Devils scored
the most points in their Pac-10 history is
definitely on the Cardinal's mind.
"I think it's good to remember the previ
ous year," said sophomore linebacker
Michael Craven. "It makes me mad to re

member how bad we got beat. I remember
walking off the field with our heads hanging
low. We'll be ready this week."
In that game, the upstart Sun Devils
stunned and dismantled the Cardinal,
running wild on offense as Shaun Mc-
Donald (now in the NFL) racked up 221
receiving yards. The sheer scale of the
loss 41 points shocked a Stanford
team that, the game before, had done the
same thing to San Jose State, winning 63-
26 in Stanford Stadium. No one really
saw it coming, as Stanford entered the
Sun Devils contest as an even-money
pick to win.
The loss did not sit well with the Cardinal,
which never really recovered, losing seven of
its last eight games.
After last year's game, wide receiver
Teyo Johnson (now in the NFL) said that the
Cardinal was taken by surprise.
"I've never lost a game that bad in my
entire life in all the sports that I've played,"

he said. "We looked at the fact that we beat
ASU before and just looked past this Sat
urday. We took the last three years for
granted."
Stanford has long since stopped taking
things for granted. Arizona State, thanks to
its breakout eight-win performance last year,
was ranked in the Top 25 to begin this sea
son, but has done little but disappoint since
then, winning just one conference game.
Interestingly, that win was a 59-14 explo
sion against Oregon, the same team that shut
out the Cardinal 35-0 two weeks ago.
Regardless, Koetter isn't taking Stanford
lightly this week.
'"Mien you get eight sacks in a game and
knock off a team that's leading the confer
ence, that says a lot," Koetter said about
Stanford's 21-14 upset of UCLA last week.
"I'm not sugarcoating it at all when I say that
you can tell on tape that those guys play hard

and fly around."
The matchup against Arizona State
will certainly present different chal
lenges than the Bruins did. UCLA
plays a conservative, field-position ori
ented type of football that played to
Stanford's strengths solid defense
and a methodical offense.
The Sun Devils, though, have made
a name for themselves as an aggressive,
explosive team, keying on big plays and
gambling for turnovers.
"I look at Arizona State as a break
out type of team, with big-play capa
bilities any time they touch the foot
ball," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "Defensively, they're
aggressive and very athletic in all
spots. Again, it will be a team effort
preparing for ASU."
One thing that may work in the
Cardinal's favor is the health of Sun
Devils standout quarterback Andrew
Walter, who rang up 414 yards against
Stanford last year. Walter will get the
start despite a sore ankle and other
minor problems.
This season, Walter has thrown
for 238 yards per game, 16 touch
downs and eight interceptions. De
spite his injuries, those numbers are
comparable to last year's, when he to
taled 277 yards per game.
On the ground, the Sun Devils, like
Stanford, go with a two-back approach.
Loren Wade is averaging 5.6 yards per
carry and is averaging 66 yards per
game, while Hakim Hill is averaging 4.0
yards per carry for 49 yards per game.
Walter relies mostly on two favorite

receivers, Derek Hagan and Skyler
Fulton, to whom he has completed
more than half of his passes this year.
Hagan has caught 47 balls this season,
while Fulton's 45 receptions have yield
ed a team-leading eight touchdowns.
Standout junior safety Jason Shiv
ers leads the Arizona State defense
with a whopping 80 tackles and three
interceptions, both team highs.
Stanford will start fifth-year senior
Chris Lewis at quarterback for the third
straight game, with redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards serving as the backup.
Lewis, in five games played, has com
pleted 47-of-96 passes for 478 yards,
three touchdowns and six intercep
tions, His favorite target, senior wide
out Luke Powell, has caught 32 balls
this year for 345 yards and two scores,
leading the team in those categories.
Junior Kenneth Tolon is averaging
65 yards per game on the ground on 3.6
yards per carry, while sophomore J.R.
Lemon has chipped in 30 yards per
game on a 4.0 average.
Stanford's special teams, which
sprung Luke Powell for a 90-yard punt
return touchdown last week, will need
to focus this week against an Arizona
State squad that tends to burn through
a lot of possessions.
Despite all the emotions this week
payback for last year, the positivi
ty offered by last week's win, a chance
to get back to .500 Teevens wants
his team to approach this week like
any other.
"When you do [win], you're ob
viously excited about it, but you
put it behind you," he said. "Just
put it behind and go to work on the
next opportunity."
