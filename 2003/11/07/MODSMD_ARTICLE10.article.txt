# Evangelists cause stir
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Hundreds of students stopped while passing
through White Plaza yesterday afternoon to gawk at
and argue with two men who attempted to prosely
tize and displayed large, religious signs, which some
students said were inflammatory.
The evangelists Jeremiah Baldwin and Frank
Warner began their display in White Plaza in the
late morning and left around 5 p.m. They carried
signs that read "God is angry at the sinner" with lists
of so-called sinners, including sports fanatics, com
puter freaks, the cult of the effeminate intellect,
power-hungry women, spineless men, Mormons and
other cults, Roman Catholics and "dykes on bikes."
"Most of these kids God is furious at and it's my
responsibility to tell them that," Baldwin said.
Students generally did not react well to the men's
message and bombarded them with questions about
their beliefs such as "What's wrong with Jews?" and
"If you think women should be so submissive, should
they not be at Stanford?"
The evangelists responded with well-formulated
answers that prompted Adam Schaeffer, a sopho
more majoring in classics to say, "This crazy drunk
Jesus guy is great. These kids [asking questions] are
getting their asses kicked."
Schaeffer supported the men's right to speak and
even thanked them before leaving.
"I don't subscribe to any particular belief, but I
really respect what you're doing here today," he
said.
However, Schaeffer also expressed his disap

to the men.
"This is just a bunch of freshmen antagonizing
[the evangelists]," he said. "It's more of a spectacle
than a learning experience."
Most students were amused at the spectacle.
Many were taking photographs and videotaping the
happenings. Some students, however, were person
ally offended and called the men hypocrites and used
various degrees of bad language to address them.
"My issue with this is that it is a very assertive and
aggressive representation of Christianity which is
counterproductive to what this University stands
for," said Jason Fang, a junior majoring in sociology.
'This isn't the kind of Christianity that should be
preached on campus."
Fang tried to reason with Baldwin following
Baldwin's verbal attack on one of Fang's friends.
"He was very verbally abusive," Fang said. "He
was interrupting her, wasn't affording her cree
dence. It felt very wrong."
According to some students, Baldwin had called
Fang's friend a "man in a woman's body," in refer-
