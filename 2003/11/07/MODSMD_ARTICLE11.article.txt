# Money at Stanford
## University deals with tuition increases 
### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford undergraduate tuition rose 4.8 percent this
year, a figure that is lower than previous years' increas
es and one that has not had a significant effect on most
students at Stanford.
Tuition has climbed steadily at Stanford for the past
two decades, and this year is no exception. However, be
tween 1999 and 2003, costs rose at a rate of 5 to 6 percent
per year, so the current increase represents a declining
rate of change. Despite the faltering economy, finan
cially disadvantaged students are generally not having
any more trouble paying tuition costs, according to As
sociate Dean and Director of Financial Aid Earl Dowl
ing.
"Since we are need-blind, low income students are
not adversely affected by tuition increases," he said.
"We have provided more financial aid money this year
than before," he added.
Students support the University's corresponding in
creases in financial aid.
"As long as the financial aid package becomes more
generous as the tuition rises, it'll be alright," said fresh
man Maia Roberts. "But if that doesn't happen, it will
become a serious burden."
Surprisingly, it is not lower-class students that are
most affected by skyrocketing tuition costs, but rather

their middle-class peers.
"The tuition increases hardest hit upper-middle class
students who are often ineligible for financial aid," said
junior Josh Seifert.
Dowling acknowledged this, but also stressed the
fact that even those who pay full tuition are still cover
ing only about half the actual price tag for attendance.
"It's important to recognize that students do not pay
for the full cost of an undergraduate education," he said.
"Everyone is receiving some help from the school."
There are also those who fall through the financial
aid cracks. Senior Max Doty is graduating a quarter
early because of a technicality in the financial aid system
that denies him a full four years of aid.
"I had 16 units of transfer credit that bumped me
ahead so I achieved graduate status early," he said.
Nationally, tuition has been skyrocketing. Public uni
versities and colleges in particular have seen huge in
creases, due in large part to state and federal budget
deficits that have led to funding cutbacks. At public in
stitutions, tuition rose 14 percent this year, the largest
increase in 25 years. At private universities and colleges,
tuition grew by six percent on average this year, mean
ing that Stanford's tuition increase was below the na
tional trend.
In an effort to stem these rapid increases, some law
makers in Washington are introducing legislation that
would seek to limit tuition increases at public universi
ties. U.S. Rep. Howard P. McKeon, a Republican from
California, has written the Higher Education Act, a bill
that would discourage some colleges from raising tu
ition by threatening to cut-off their access to federal stu
dent-aid money.
Many in Congress criticize this move. Rep. Zoe Lof
gren (Democrat) of the 16th Congressional District in
San Jose believes this legislation will make matters
worse.
"I think it's a dumb approach," she said. "This will
only punish students by taking away their aid for tu
ition," she added.
Lofgren argues that the best way to lower tuition is to
increase federal and state funding for education.
"Pell Grants have been diminishing in value," she
said. "Years ago they used to cover 80 percent of the
cost of tuition. Today they cover only 40 percent, and
Bush wants to cut them further."
Lofgren, a Stanford graduate herself and the mother
of two current Stanford undergraduates, also has a per
sonal stake in the matter.
"I feel that my wallet is significantly lighter," she
said.
