# Sophs get 'Singled Out'
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The Sophomore Class Cabinet helped form two
couples last night, in the Singled Out event that was
part of this week's 'O6 Spirit Week the first class
spirit week ever held at Stanford. Nico Barcelo and
Sharleen Villagra and Melanie Kannokada and Ali
Jamal will be going to dinner together tomorrow night,
followed by Sophomore Formal, to see if these match
es are truly made in heaven.
There were about 40 sophomores who filled out
surveys and showed up to participate in Stanford's ver
sion of "Singled Out," based on a MTV dating show in
the late '9os. Questions ranged from study habits to
majors to height and date preferences.
"I know how hard it is to plan events, so I just
showed up to support the Class officers," said "Singled
Out" participant and sophomore George Hill. "And
why not get a date?"
In the first rounds of the game, Barcelo and Kan
nokada eliminated sophomores who didn't match
their favored characteristics from the survey. In the
final round, the contestants who gave the most correct
answers to questions that were asked were selected as
dates for Nico and Melanie.
"[Having to eliminate / choose guys] was really in
tense," said Kannokada. "There were so many things
going through my head. But tomorrow should be a fun
time."
The Stanford version of the game eliminated the

second round, as the officers didn't think that students
would be willing to embarrass themselves in random
feats..
"It was awesome," said sophomore Derek Alley,
who was one of the final three guys left for Kannoka
da. "I felt like I was on top of the world when I was up
there. There was energy rushing through my veins.
This was the best event ever!"
"Singled Out" was one part of a full week of events
that was planned for the Sophomore Class. Other ac
tivities included Pajama Day, a Taco Bell run, 'Bos
Movie Night and a spirit day. The week will culminate
with Sophomore Formal, to be held on Saturday night
at Club Mirage at Piccolo's restaurant.
"The reason that 'O6 Formal â€”we changed the
name to encourage class identification is being held
off-campus is because we wanted to make it special,
not just another school dance," said sophomore class
president, Victoria Carr. "We've rented out a whole
building that includes a restaurant, a patio area for
people to chill and an upstairs dance area."
A large part of the dance costs are being subsidized
by the Sophomore Class. The cost for attendance was
$l5 per person at last year's Sophomore Formal. But
the officers wanted to encourage more people to at
tend, and thus changed the price to $6 per person.
The Class also funded the food and supplies that
went along with the spirit week activities, with the
grand total coming out to $6OO, which was three times
