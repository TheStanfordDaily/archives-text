Senior Alex Choate, 21, died on Tuesday at Stan
ford Hospital after battling brain cancer for more than
a year. Choate, a resident of the Suites at Governor's
Corner, pursued a double major in international rela
tions and economics and was a devoted member of the
Sixth Man Club.
A memorial service will be held on Sunday, Nov. 9
at 2 p.m. at the Elliott Program Center on the Stanford
campus.
Choate was first diagnosed with brain cancer in May
2002 after an emergency surgical procedure. Yet, he
refused to take a break from school, completing his fi
nals and tackling a summer research project while si
multaneously receiving chemotherapy and radiation
treatments.

"He stood out from the crowd intellectually be
cause he was so thorough in researching a question and
looked at all angles before reaching a judgment," said
Frederick Choate, his father, adding that his son en
joyed challenges. "He highly valued science and logical
analysis of any question."
According to family members, he was determined
to fight the illness and continued to take a full course
load through his junior year.
"I can hardly remember him complaining about
anything, even the high levels of pain he endured for
months this last summer," Choate's father said. "He al
ways felt that if a treatment had even a slight chance of
improving things that it should be considered. Every
one remarks on how courageous he has been."
Choate, who lived in Moscow for several years, cul
tivated a strong interest in languages, picking up
French, Russian and German at an
early age. He also spent much of his
time traveling with family and
friends to distant locales, including
most European countries, Tahiti
and Tunisia.
In 2000, he graduated from the
International High School at the
French-American International
School in San Francisco with a bilin
gual International Baccalaureate
degree.
Once he arrived at Stanford,
Choate's passion for sports prompt
ed him to join an intramural basket
ball team and the Stanford basket
ball cheering section. While he fol

lowed NCAA athletics religiously,
family members said he held a spe
cial place in his heart for the San
Francisco 49ers and the Oakland
A's.
"Alex had a wry sense of humor,"
his father said. "He was patient in
helping others, generous with his
time, intolerant of hypocrisy and
very loyal to his friends, family and
sports teams."
In the weeks before his death,
Stanford Hospital made arrange
ments to allow friends and family
members to visit Choate around the
clock, his father said.
"The Stanford community was
unbelievably supportive, especially
the close circle of friends who had
been with him since his freshman
year at Donner," he added.
Choate is survived by his parents
and younger sister, Christina.
