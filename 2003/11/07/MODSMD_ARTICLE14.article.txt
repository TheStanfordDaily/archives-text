## Joel Stein indulges himself 
### JOEL STEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Note: Believe it or not, The
Daily has produced successful gradu
ates. Joel Stein, Class of '93, is the cur
rent humor columnist for Time maga
zine and a commentator on VHl's "I
Love the 'Bos." Here, we print one of his
vintage columns.

I have enough friends to build a
barn. Not one of those small, Fisher
Price barns with the unauthentic cow
sounds either. I'm talking about the
kind of barn with plush carpets, sky
lights, self-flushing bidets and one of
those quaint ladder-loft things like
they had on "Little House."
And, when I say friends, I'm not talk
ing about a bunch of guys in 18th-century
wigs, arguing about local politics in a
small room and eating tepid oats from a
cereal bowl. No, that's not what friends
are to me.
To me, a friend means something
more. A friend is someone who knows
me. Someone who knows what kind of
presents I like, what kind of words I con
sider to be appropriate compliments
("magnetic," "riveting," "gargantuan"),
and that certain kinds of cheap cologne
turn me on. Someone who knows the
story behind why that is.
Some would accuse me of having
shallow friendships, simply by virtue of
the fact that I have so many. To them,
I say, "Screw off." My friendships are
some of the most intimate, intense re
lationships since Dustin Hoffman and
Warren Beatty.
Some people spend hours together at
coffee shops, exchanging intimate details
about their lives, which oftentimes center
around bizarre sexual fantasies in which I
star. My friendships are not like that, al
though I wouldn't be surprised if some of
that goes on in my Mends' subconscious.
But we don't talk about it.
When I pass a Mend biking by, and I
say, "Hey babe," I'm communicating a lot
more than any cup of joe could ever hope
to accomplish. When I say "Let's do dinner
some time," I don't really mean it, but
that's not what's important. What I'm say
ing is "If we're both at the same restaurant,
you should feel free to stop by my table and
say 'hi.'" In a Mendship, it's not the words
that matter, it's the emotion, the connec
tion. And that's a skill you just can't learn.
My Mendships are the most impor
tant things in my life. More important
than my personal, polydactylic masseuse.
More important than the shrub outside
the Oval Office that the gardener, with
utmost care and precision, shapes in my
likeness as an odd, but powerful, Mbute.
When my Mends call and ask for a favor,
I do it, even if it means entirely rearrang
ing the schedule of a valuable member of
the Joel Stein Service.
No, I don't have a lot of time for my
Mends. I can't personally return every
phone call or every piece of mail. And,
yes, sometimes I get confused with the
fan mail and send a form letter and a 5 x
7 glossy to someone I'm sleeping with.
But they always understand.
But although my time is extremely
limited, I make an effort to let people
know I care. If that means calling when I
know they're out, so I can save time by
leaving a message, then I do it. If it means
telling them to gather in large groups and
to wait for me in public places, like the
ATM machine and the urinal, then I do
it. I'm not afraid to bend the rules. Not
when it comes to my Mends.
And even if I'm not in touch, I make
sure I keep up on their fives. People at the
Stein Service are trained to trace their lo
cation and interrogate their Mends until
I find out what they've been eating, if
they've been exercising and who they're
sleeping with. The Service employee
then prescribes a sMct diet, a rigorous
training program and a copy of my latest
book "Staying Trim, Keeping Fit, Writ
ing Qever: The Joel Stein Secret."
Not everyone can be my Mend. They
have to be willing to deal with the
tabloids, to have their name whispered at
posh dinner parties like it was a curse or a
rare South American disease. They have
to be willing to have Stein Service em
ployees occasionally spy outside their
windows to make sure they're not screen
ing when I call. Friendship is important,
but trust is stupid.
But for those who do become my
Mends, they can look forward to a re
lationship with more depth and
strength than any they'll ever know.
No one ever had a Mend like me, not
the Lone Ranger, not Fred Flintstone,
not Serbia during World War I. If a
Mend of mine needed a kidney, I'd buy
him one. And not one of those cheap,
crack-infested ones that anyone can
find off the streets.
That's the kind of Mend I am.
