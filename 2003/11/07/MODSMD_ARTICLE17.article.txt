# Senior soccer player arrested on Saturday
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
A senior soccer player was arrested last Saturday and charged with a
misdemeanor after being cited two months ago for interfering with arrest.
She was released later that day.
At a party in Stern Hall on Sept. 1, Natalie Spilger behaved belligerent
ly and refused officer orders, according to the police report. At the time,
sophomore Hayley Hunt was being cited on a minor in possession charge,
and Spilger tried to keep her from leaving the building with the officer.
"The police report indicates the defendant was extremely intoxicated
and interfered with not one, but several sheriff officers," said Jay Boyarsky,
a supervising district attorney in Santa Clara County.
The party, which involved members of the women's soccer team, was
loud and out of control on that Monday night, according to Boyarsky.
When the dorm's resident assistant arrived to quiet the party, she was
locked out.
"People were saying, 'Don't let her in,' " Boyarsky said.
When Stanford police officers arrived, they reportedly found Hunt in
toxicated and began to take her outside to issue a citation.
"Spilger began screaming, 'Let my friend go. You can't touch her,' " Bo
yarsky quoted from the police report.
At the time, Spilger also said that her father was a lawyer and told the
officer, "You can't tell me where to go."
"He actually can tell her where to go," Boyarsky said.
Spilger subsequently tried to grab Hunt and hold her in the doorway,
the officer said in the report.
"Spilger yelled at the cop, 'The rules start next week,' " Boyarsky
added.
Many unknown suspects were rushing around interfering with the po
lice, according to the report.
"It becomes an officer safety issue," Boyarsky said.
At the time, Spilger was not arrested. According to Sgt. Rick Tipton,
this procedure is not uncommon.
Boyarsky explained that, according to the report, senior Allyson Mar
quand, who was not drunk, tried to calm Spilger down. Officers let her take
control of the situation at the time.
Neither Spilger nor other soccer players could be reached for comment.
The district attorney reviewed the case and in mid-September decided
to press charges. A warrant was subsequently issued for Spilger's arrest,
and she complied with the warrant last Saturday. She was cited and re
leased.
The maximum penalty for this misdemeanor is a year in county jail or a
$l,OOO fine. Most misdemeanors do not result in jail time, according to Bo
yarsky.
