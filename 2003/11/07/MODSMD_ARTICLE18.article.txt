# Co-term requirements change
## 
### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, the Faculty Senate voted
to approve changes in the application procedure
for co-terminal master's degree programs and to
reauthorize the Interdisciplinary Program in Epi
demiology to nominate candidates for the master
of science degree for three years.
The previous policy for candidates applying for
a co-terminal degree program stipulated that the
candidate must have completed 105 units and eight
quarters of enrollment and that the candidate must
submit the application between the eighth and
eleventh quarter of "full-tuition enrollment."
Two changes, effective this academic year, were
made to this policy. The policy now states that stu
dents have to have completed at least 120 units, in
cluding AP and transfer units, toward graduation
before applying for the program, and that students

have to submit the application for the program no
later than the quarter before they are expected to
complete the bachelor's degree.
The changes do not affect the academic re
quirements for candidates applying for the co-term
program, but only makes the policy "clearer and
simpler for everybody," said James Baron, chair of
the committee on graduate studies.
The senate also approved a three-year exten
sion for IDP in Epidemiology to nominate candi
dates for the master of science degree. â€¢
The IDP is currently in the process of recruiting
new faculty and is ultimately heading toward de
partmental status, according to Medical School
Dean Philip Pizzo.
"Epidemiology is essential to our school," he
said.
Over the past few years, the IDP has experi
enced problems with the loss of faculty and the in
ability to fill open billets. However, Ellen Porzig,

associate dean for graduate education, remains
"optimistic" about the future of the IDP.
Paul Boothroyd, senior associate dean for re
search and training in the school of medicine,
echoed Porzig's optimism for the program.
"We're not going to let this discipline decline
any further," he said. "In fact, we're going to build
it."
Prof. Arnetha Ball voiced her concern about
the lack of racial diversity in the program's stu
dents and faculty.
Boothroyd assured the senate that ensuring di
versity among students and faculty is "one of the
prime considerations" in building the program.
The program currently has almost exclusively fe
male faculty.
The senate will reconvene Thursday, Dec. 4, to
discuss the faculty quality of life survey and degree
authority for the new Bio Engineering Depart
ment.
