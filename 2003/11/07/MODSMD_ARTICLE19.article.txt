## Pre-paid tuition helps students 
### 
In the last 13 years, the cost of tuition at
Stanford has doubled, rising from
$14,280 in 1990 to $28,563 this academ
ic year. The University Board of
Trustees, recognizing the steepness of this
increase, approved a pre-paid plan last
month that allows families to avoid future

tuition hikes by locking
in lower tuition rates
and saving money now
for their children's col
lege education.
The plan is as an im
portant means of allevi
ating the financial strains
of higher education ex
penses and helping to
ensure equal access for
students of all financial
backgrounds to a Stan
ford education.
But the plan's great
est advantage is that it
offers families an op
portunity to buy into a
set tuition rate based

on current tuition pricing at an additional
one-half percent discount. While there may
be investment strategies with higher returns,
the new program is a way for families without
access to better means of investment to start
putting away money now for future college
expenses.

Furthermore, the plan is flexible, as tuition
certificates purchased through the plan can
be transferred at any time to one of 200
schools or converted into a comparable tax
advantaged college savings plan. Additional
ly, the certificates can be transferred to fellow
family members.

By guaranteeing a
fixed present-day tu
ition rate, the Universi
ty risks significant losses
in future tuition rev
enue since rates will as
sumedly increase, given
recent trends. However,
Stanford will actually
gain from a pre-paid tu
ition program because it
can put revenue from
tuition certificates sold
into high-yield invest
ments. University finan
cial advisers estimate
that, after losses in
curred by the tuition
discounts, Stanford will

have a net financial gain of about 25 percent
due to the program.
At a time when the annual cost of Stanford
tuition, room and board is only slightly less
than the median income of U.S. households,
the pre-paid tuition plan gives some families
a needed break.
