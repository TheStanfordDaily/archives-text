# All is not lost for Cardinal
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Believe it or not, Stanford still has a
shot at making a bowl game.
All it has to do is win its remain
ing home games starting with to
morrow's matchup with Arizona
State to finish with six wins and
make itself eligible for postseason
selection. (It will later host Califor
nia and Notre Dame and travels to
Oregon State for a game in which it
will surely be the underdog.)
Will Stanford be able to pull off
such a late-season run-of-the-table?
It might if it is able to recreate the
winning formula it utilized to upset
UCLA 21-14 last weekend.
Ingredient No. 1: Execute of
fensively.
Although it gained only 206 yards
and starting quarterback Chris Lewis
threw for a paltry 91 yards the sixth
worst passing performance in Stanford
history the offense scored when it
counted most.
The Stanford offense scored
both times it entered the red zone
first on a play-action pass to
tight end Matt Traverso and then
on a 1-yard run from Lewis. That
it was able to be so efficient was
doubly important to the Cardi
nal's psyche one week after failing
seven times on goal-to-go against
Oregon.
"We were opportunistic on of
fense," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said. "We learned that if we
execute and perform, then you have an
opportunity to win."
Ingredient No. 2: Make big plays on
special teams.

Luke Powell had the game
changing play of the day when he
returned a Bruins punt 90 yards
for a touchdown, the second
longest such return in Stanford
history.
The former All-America punt re
turner had struggled to regain his 2001
form this season but his second career
return touchdown ignited the Cardinal
right before halftime and dealt the
Bruins a blow they were ultimately un
able to recover from.
"Luke's return was very timely and
gave us an emotional lift," Teevens
said. "That's something we've been
working hard onâ€”we really put em
phasis last week on Luke catching
every punt."
Ingredient No. 3: Stop the run.
The Cardinal learned that if it does
so, the opposition becomes one-di
mensional and predictable, allowing
the defense to blitz heavily.
Stanford allowed the Bruins
only 48 yards rushing on 36 carries
and sacked UCLA quarterbacks
eight times the most any defense
has garnered in Teevens' year and a
half tenure.
"We did a nice job of pressuring the
quarterback," Teevens said. "The de
fensive ends had as strong a perfor
mance as they've had all season."
Moreover, the correlation between
stopping the run, getting to the quar
terback and winning has been there all
season long.
Consider the following:
In Stanford's three wins, it has given
up a total of 52 yards on the ground and
collected 14 sacks.
