# Tailgate a step in right direction
## 
### 
The student life committee came to
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
with a good idea earlier this week: To
promote school spirit, the ASSU
should fund a tailgate party in the Mirrielees
Courtyard. The tailgate, which was narrowly
approved by the ASSU Senate, was fast
tracked for consideration by the Office of Stu
dent Activities. After evaluating the proposal,
the office gave the ASSU the thumbs up.
The tailgate is exactly the type of activity
that could improve student life on campus.
Planned by the ASSU and the Office of Stu
dent Activities, it could be a success. And
with plenty of sober monitors and security
officials on-hand, it promises to be safe.
Officials from the Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs Office the umbrella under
which the Office of Student Activities falls
have repeatedly said that they do not op
pose alcohol on-campus. What is worrying,
they counter, is binge drinking and the
health dangers it poses. While beer will be
served at the tailgate, the event will not be
focused entirely on alcohol. It is for that rea

son that we are particularly pleased with
this event.
We support the Office of Student Activi
ties' speedy approval of the -event. While
maintaining standards to ensure that this
event would be safe, the normal 14-day no
tice for parties of this category was waived by
Joey Greenwell, the office's assistant direc
tor. The enthusiasm with which Greenwell
and Nanci Howe, the director of the Office of
Student Activities, greeted the event is par
ticularly encouraging.
Josh Shipp, the chair of the Undergradu
ate Senate, said that the ASSU is waiting
until Saturday to see how the event goes off
before deciding if the organization wants to
host other such events. We hope that many
students will attend the tailgate and that our
student representatives will continue to plan
this and other fun, safe social events.
This page has called on the ASSU and the
Office of Student Activities to put together
social events that are good alternatives to
binge drinking on the weekends. An event of
this nature is exactly what we had envisioned.
