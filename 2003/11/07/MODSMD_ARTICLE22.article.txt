Ads from Campustruth.org
should continue running
Let me be one of the few on cam
pus to actually come out in support
of Editor in Chief Ramin Setoodeh
and the Stanford Daily's decision to
continue running the ads. Accusa
tions of racism, demonization and
blanket stereotyping have been
raised by many people in the Stan
ford community.
So why should these so-called
racist, bigoted, terribly insensitive
ads be run?
Simple: Because free speech is at
stake, and because hate speech isn't
an issue. Now I am by no means a
categorical defender of free speech
using racist or sexist slurs is just
wrong but I don't believe that
these ads are examples of hate
speech, and I certainly don't believe
many of the hyperbolic charges lev
eled against their ability to incite vi
olence and increase discrimination.
The Arab-Palestinian conflict is
such an emotionally charged issue
that people can't seem to be objec
tive at any level. These ads do speak
a certain level of truth: There were
mourners in Tel Aviv on Sept. 11,
2001, and there were Palestinian cel
ebrators on the streets on that same
day. Even major television networks
showed the same images. Should we
now censor what is shown on TV as
well? Why not go from there to mag
azines, books maybe even every
day speech?
The ads show fact. Granted, they
are one-sided fact, and granted, they
do show emotionally powerfully im
ages and make emotionally power
ful statements. But the ads are factu
al â€” they don't make up statistics,
they don't make up numbers and
they certainly don't make up the
events. Hate speech, libel, slander;
all of these are at a broad level lies,
misrepresentation or outright mis
truth. The ads do not misrepresent.
They simply represent one side's po
litical views to the emotional anger
of the other's. One of America's
greatest qualities is the right to free
speech the right to express politi
cal opinions even if they may stir
controversy and heated debate. The
ads have certainly done that, and the
dialogue raised on campus can only
help educate and inform.

Why is there such an outcry when
a pro-Israeli side is for once presented
on this campus? Stanford students
pride themselves of tolerance - so why
such abundance of accusations rang
ing from insensitivity to racism in re
sponse to an ad that defends Israel,
who is fighting for her survival and for
the ability of her citizens to let their
children go to school without the fear
that they will be blown to bits by some
new "martyr?" I agree with freshman
Ahmed Ashraf ("The Daily's deci
sion to run ads violates Fundamental
Standard," Nov. 6), when he says we
all want "respect for order" and com
passion, but there's a drastic lack of
the above characteristics from Israel's
neighbors and other Arab countries.
Which "subjective opinions" pre
sented as "facts" would Mr. Ashraf
like to dispute? The fact that Pales
tinians danced on the streets on the
day when thousands of American
citizens were burned to death,
jumped out the windows or were
buried alive in the ruins of the World
Trade Center? Or the fact that Pales
tinian suicide bombers prefer to
carry out their attacks in strictly civil
ian areas, like a disco full of teenagers
or a restaurant where people are cel
ebrating a religious holiday?
Let me also remind the support
ers of facts that Israel's neighbors at
tacked her on the most holy day of
the Jewish year in 1973. That fails to
strike me as very respectful of the
Jewish nation. I have witnessed
"cheap stunts and propaganda"
when Palestinian supporters on this
campus formed a tight circle around
students celebrating Israel's inde
pendence day and carried mock
coffins through the crowd of celebra
tors. That's not very sensitive to the
people who have survived through
centuries of persecution and torture
just for their religion, is it?
I applaud The Daily for present
ing the Israeli side of the conflict,
and hope that supporters of the
other side have the tolerance that
they demand from everyone else to
listen to the opposing opinion, as
there can be no meaningful dialogue
with only one side's views tolerated.

I would like to express my regret
that the recent printings of the Cam
pustruth.org advertisements in The

Daily have caused some students to
feel threatened or generalized.
However, I am yet to find a sin
gle person who has felt inspired to
commit violence against any Pales
tinian, Arab or Muslim as a result of
these advertisements, and I certain
ly hope that these fears will never
be actualized. As to the issue of
generalization, the advertisements
try to bring to fight the difficulties of
the Israeli people in dealing with
the situation, and do not imply in
any way that the situation is the
fault of all Palestinians. It is simply
trying to show that all it takes is one
suicide bomber to make a people
and a nation react in the ways that
Israel does, and that as long as the
attacks continue, Israel has no
choice but to defend herself.
I'm worried that some students
who have written letters to The
Daily seem to use these fears as an
argument against the printing of the
advertisements. It would seem that
some students would much rather
deny the existence of terrorism
against Israel than acknowledge it,
since to do so might seem to incrim
inate the entire Palestinian people.
These people would do much bet
ter to distance themselves from the
actions of some minority of the
Palestinian population; unfortu
nately, they often choose to deny al
together the occurrence of the de
picted events, thus protecting the
deeds of a minority at the expense
of all Palestinians.
In one letter yesterday ("The
Daily's decision to run ads violates
Fundamental Standard," Nov. 6),
Freshman Ahmed Ashraf writes
that the ads "show no respect for
the rights of others ... and show
no compassion for the cumulative
suffering of a displaced, impover
ished and humiliated people with
out a homeland."
On the contrary, the ads don't vi
olate the rights of others, but to cen
sor them would violate the rights of
those who disagree with Mr.
Ashraf s point of view. Additionally,
the ads may not show a great deal of
compassion for Palestinians, but
they do show a great deal of com
passion for Israelis, who are a people
hurt by the terror and constant war
that has been levied against them
unilaterally since the creation of the
state of Israel. We must recognize
these injustices against the Israeli
people, respecting the rights of Is
raelis just as Mr. Ashraf wishes us to
respect the rights of the Palestinians.
There are already many events on
campus that show sympathy for the
plight of the Palestinians. These ad
vertisements choose to show sympa
thy for the plight of the Israelis and
bring people to understand the Israeli
point of view in this conflict. Their
purpose is not to promote violence,
but compassion and understanding
for what Israelis have to deal with
every day for the last 55 years. Their
purpose is not to paint all Palestini
ans, Arabs or Muslims as terrorists,
but to show the Stanford community
that Palestinians are by no means the
only victims in the conflict.

Beilin's diplomatic
role questioned
On Nov. 2, 2003, Hillel among
other groups sponsored Yossi Beilin,
the co-author of the Geneva Accord
(along with Avram Mitzna). It seems
Hillel falls short of its "mission to
bring speakers from a broad spec
trum of political views who will edu
cate the community." The speakers
Hillel sponsors for the most part,
such as Mr. Beilin, seem to only fit a
left-wing paradigm. While I applaud
Hillel's "support of Israel as a Jewish
democratic state," does Yossi Beilin
represent this?
The Geneva agreement is be
tween Palestinian authority figures
and former failed Israeli politicians
with formerly failed initiatives that
have only proven in past agreements
to bring more violence. It is an agree
ment by unauthorized "renegade"
Israelis and undercuts Israel's demo
cratically elected government. In the
United States, we define these limits
to undermine the government as the
Logan Act federal legislation that
makes it a crime for citizens to con
duct negotiations with hostile pow
ers. It is one thing to disagree with a
government, but personal or free
lance diplomacy is opposition to rule
of law and disrespects democracy.
"What makes the actions of Mitz
na and Beilin especially egregious is
that only eight months ago, these
men asked Israel's people to reject
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's lead
ership and give them the responsibil
ity to make peace with the Palestini
ans." The answer they received was

"no." They now seem to hope Amer
ican Jews will support their cause and
promote their initiative at the ex
pense of Israel's government. Some
may think their motives are a sense
of duty and conscience to work for
peace, but this is not an excuse for be
havior that circumvents democracy
and makes "Sharon's position im
possible."
Besides the old agreements of the
past, the Accord adds on initiatives to
drop supervision of weapons smug
gling, limit Israeli security, provides
no time limit for removal of the cur
rent terror infrastructure and allows
Palestinians to arm themselves with
whatever a third party decides.
Worse, among many other initia
tives, it is monitoring international
points of entry under a Multinational
Force, and a permanently open corri
dor linking the West Bank and Gaza
that cannot be closed even if abused.
Israel not only forfeits its sovereignty
over borders but also its right to carry
out defensive operations that are
under multinational authority re
porting to an international body.
Jonathan Elkin, member of the
student board of Hillel, said his orga
nization "hoped the talk will present
a message of hope for the quagmire
we are in now." As Jews, we all sup
port this hope for the harmonious ex
istence of Israel as a democratic state.
Peace is the ideal, we all pray for, but
we must be watchful about peace at
what price. Change in Palestinian in
frastructure and forfeiture of an ide
ology that denies Israel's right to exist
is critical before lasting peace for
both sides can be obtained. We
must not wish so hard that we lose all
sense of reality and reason and de
stroy that which we want most.

'Sustainable growth'
misrepresenteain Op-Ed
I can only assume that by running
the same op-ed piece twice in a single
week ("What does sustainable
growth mean?" Oct. 31 and "The
essence of sustainable develop
ment," Nov. 6) the editors of this
newspaper are attempting to send the
Stanford community some kind of
message. I did not know that The
Daily had decided to convert itself
into a public platform for the opaque
and retrograde analyses of the fel
lows of the Hoover Institution. Hav
ing had the pleasure of re-reading this
article, however, I now feel the need
to rebut some of its more egregious
malapropisms and misdirections.
Anderson andHuggins present a
reductive, outdated "definition" of
sustainable development and then
claim to undermine it with some very
specious reasoning. Their assertion
that "resources are becoming less, not
more scarce," cites rising yields of cer
tain staple crops as evidence. This im
plies a myopic and semi-backwards
understanding of ecosystem function
whereby agricultural products are de
fined as environmental resources.
Clearly, food crops are vital
human resources, but what about so
called natural resources such as un
contaminated groundwater, healthy
soils and genetic biodiversity? Surely,
these are as important to the mainte
nance and durability of human life on
earth as the subsidized surplus corn
harvests that the U.S. government
dumps on global food markets at the
end of every growing season.
Sustainable development is not
based on the simplistic belief that,
"economic growth and consump
tion will ultimately run up against
resource limits."
Rather, the ideal of sustainability
strives to reconcile the necessity for
continued human development with
the viability of existing environmen
tal systems. The distinction may ap
pear semantic, but the implications
are clear: Responsible development
need not conflict with ecosystem sta
bility and survival. In other words, we
can â€” act in such a
way so as to avoid further damage to
the environment. This hardly sounds
like gloom-and-doom to me.
In the future, I hope that Ander
son and Huggins will critique a more
contemporary and substantive vi
sion of sustainable development. I
also hope that this newspaper will do
us all the favor of not allowing such
agitational slander to go into print
on more than one occasion. That is,
unless the Hoover Institution wishes
to pay for the advertising space.

Editor's note: The Daily made the
mistake of printing the Op-Ed "What
does sustainable growth mean?"
twice in one week. In no way was this
error intended as a political statement.

choice but to defend herself.
I'm worried that some students
who have written letters to The
Daily seem to use these fears as an
argument against the printing of the
advertisements. It would seem that
some students would much rather
deny the existence of terrorism
against Israel than acknowledge it,
since to do so might seem to incrim
inate the entire Palestinian people.
These people would do much bet
ter to distance themselves from the
actions of some minority of the
Palestinian population; unfortu
nately, they often choose to deny al
together the occurrence of the de
picted events, thus protecting the
deeds of a minority at the expense
of all Palestinians.
In one letter yesterday ("The
Daily's decision to run ads violates
Fundamental Standard," Nov. 6),
Freshman Ahmed Ashraf writes
that the ads "show no respect for
the rights of others ... and show
no compassion for the cumulative
suffering of a displaced, impover
ished and humiliated people with
out a homeland."
On the contrary, the ads don't vi
olate the rights of others, but to cen
sor them would violate the rights of
those who disagree with Mr.
Ashraf s point of view. Additionally,
the ads may not show a great deal of
compassion for Palestinians, but
they do show a great deal of com
passion for Israelis, who are a people
hurt by the terror and constant war
that has been levied against them
unilaterally since the creation of the
state of Israel. We must recognize
these injustices against the Israeli
people, respecting the rights of Is
raelis just as Mr. Ashraf wishes us to
respect the rights of the Palestinians.
There are already many events on
campus that show sympathy for the
plight of the Palestinians. These ad
vertisements choose to show sympa
thy for the plight of the Israelis and
bring people to understand the Israeli
point of view in this conflict. Their
purpose is not to promote violence,
but compassion and understanding
for what Israelis have to deal with
every day for the last 55 years. Their
purpose is not to paint all Palestini
ans, Arabs or Muslims as terrorists,
but to show the Stanford community
that Palestinians are by no means the
only victims in the conflict.

Beilin's diplomatic
role questioned
On Nov. 2, 2003, Hillel among
other groups sponsored Yossi Beilin,
the co-author of the Geneva Accord
(along with Avram Mitzna). It seems
Hillel falls short of its "mission to
bring speakers from a broad spec
trum of political views who will edu
cate the community." The speakers
Hillel sponsors for the most part,
such as Mr. Beilin, seem to only fit a
left-wing paradigm. While I applaud
Hillel's "support of Israel as a Jewish
democratic state," does Yossi Beilin
represent this?
The Geneva agreement is be
tween Palestinian authority figures
and former failed Israeli politicians
with formerly failed initiatives that
have only proven in past agreements
to bring more violence. It is an agree
ment by unauthorized "renegade"
Israelis and undercuts Israel's demo
cratically elected government. In the
United States, we define these limits
to undermine the government as the
Logan Act federal legislation that
makes it a crime for citizens to con
duct negotiations with hostile pow
ers. It is one thing to disagree with a
government, but personal or free
lance diplomacy is opposition to rule
of law and disrespects democracy.
"What makes the actions of Mitz
na and Beilin especially egregious is
that only eight months ago, these
men asked Israel's people to reject
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's lead
ership and give them the responsibil
ity to make peace with the Palestini
ans." The answer they received was

"no." They now seem to hope Amer
ican Jews will support their cause and
promote their initiative at the ex
pense of Israel's government. Some
may think their motives are a sense
of duty and conscience to work for
peace, but this is not an excuse for be
havior that circumvents democracy
and makes "Sharon's position im
possible."
Besides the old agreements of the
past, the Accord adds on initiatives to
drop supervision of weapons smug
gling, limit Israeli security, provides
no time limit for removal of the cur
rent terror infrastructure and allows
Palestinians to arm themselves with
whatever a third party decides.
Worse, among many other initia
tives, it is monitoring international
points of entry under a Multinational
Force, and a permanently open corri
dor linking the West Bank and Gaza
that cannot be closed even if abused.
Israel not only forfeits its sovereignty
over borders but also its right to carry
out defensive operations that are
under multinational authority re
porting to an international body.
Jonathan Elkin, member of the
student board of Hillel, said his orga
nization "hoped the talk will present
a message of hope for the quagmire
we are in now." As Jews, we all sup
port this hope for the harmonious ex
istence of Israel as a democratic state.
Peace is the ideal, we all pray for, but
we must be watchful about peace at
what price. Change in Palestinian in
frastructure and forfeiture of an ide
ology that denies Israel's right to exist
is critical before lasting peace for
both sides can be obtained. We
must not wish so hard that we lose all
sense of reality and reason and de
stroy that which we want most.

'Sustainable growth'
misrepresenteain Op-Ed
I can only assume that by running
the same op-ed piece twice in a single
week ("What does sustainable
growth mean?" Oct. 31 and "The
essence of sustainable develop
ment," Nov. 6) the editors of this
newspaper are attempting to send the
Stanford community some kind of
message. I did not know that The
Daily had decided to convert itself
into a public platform for the opaque
and retrograde analyses of the fel
lows of the Hoover Institution. Hav
ing had the pleasure of re-reading this
article, however, I now feel the need
to rebut some of its more egregious
malapropisms and misdirections.
Anderson andHuggins present a
reductive, outdated "definition" of
sustainable development and then
claim to undermine it with some very
specious reasoning. Their assertion
that "resources are becoming less, not
more scarce," cites rising yields of cer
tain staple crops as evidence. This im
plies a myopic and semi-backwards
understanding of ecosystem function
whereby agricultural products are de
fined as environmental resources.
Clearly, food crops are vital
human resources, but what about so
called natural resources such as un
contaminated groundwater, healthy
soils and genetic biodiversity? Surely,
these are as important to the mainte
nance and durability of human life on
earth as the subsidized surplus corn
harvests that the U.S. government
dumps on global food markets at the
end of every growing season.
Sustainable development is not
based on the simplistic belief that,
"economic growth and consump
tion will ultimately run up against
resource limits."
Rather, the ideal of sustainability
strives to reconcile the necessity for
continued human development with
the viability of existing environmen
tal systems. The distinction may ap
pear semantic, but the implications
are clear: Responsible development
need not conflict with ecosystem sta
bility and survival. In other words, we
can â€” act in such a
way so as to avoid further damage to
the environment. This hardly sounds
like gloom-and-doom to me.
In the future, I hope that Ander
son and Huggins will critique a more
contemporary and substantive vi
sion of sustainable development. I
also hope that this newspaper will do
us all the favor of not allowing such
agitational slander to go into print
on more than one occasion. That is,
unless the Hoover Institution wishes
to pay for the advertising space.
AARON SHAW

Editor's note: The Daily made the
mistake of printing the Op-Ed "What
does sustainable growth mean?"
twice in one week. In no way was this
error intended as a political statement.
Ads from Campustruth.org
should continue running
Let me be one of the few on cam
pus to actually come out in support
of Editor in Chief Ramin Setoodeh
and the Stanford Daily's decision to
continue running the ads. Accusa
tions of racism, demonization and
blanket stereotyping have been
raised by many people in the Stan
ford community.
So why should these so-called
racist, bigoted, terribly insensitive
ads be run?
Simple: Because free speech is at
stake, and because hate speech isn't
an issue. Now I am by no means a
categorical defender of free speech
using racist or sexist slurs is just
wrong but I don't believe that
these ads are examples of hate
speech, and I certainly don't believe
many of the hyperbolic charges lev
eled against their ability to incite vi
olence and increase discrimination.
The Arab-Palestinian conflict is
such an emotionally charged issue
that people can't seem to be objec
tive at any level. These ads do speak
a certain level of truth: There were
mourners in Tel Aviv on Sept. 11,
2001, and there were Palestinian cel
ebrators on the streets on that same
day. Even major television networks
showed the same images. Should we
now censor what is shown on TV as
well? Why not go from there to mag
azines, books maybe even every
day speech?
The ads show fact. Granted, they
are one-sided fact, and granted, they
do show emotionally powerfully im
ages and make emotionally power
ful statements. But the ads are factu
al â€” they don't make up statistics,
they don't make up numbers and
they certainly don't make up the
events. Hate speech, libel, slander;
all of these are at a broad level lies,
misrepresentation or outright mis
truth. The ads do not misrepresent.
They simply represent one side's po
litical views to the emotional anger
of the other's. One of America's
greatest qualities is the right to free
speech the right to express politi
cal opinions even if they may stir
controversy and heated debate. The
ads have certainly done that, and the
dialogue raised on campus can only
help educate and inform.
KEVIN GAO
Sophomore, International Relations
Why is there such an outcry when
a pro-Israeli side is for once presented
on this campus? Stanford students
pride themselves of tolerance - so why
such abundance of accusations rang
ing from insensitivity to racism in re
sponse to an ad that defends Israel,
who is fighting for her survival and for
the ability of her citizens to let their
children go to school without the fear
that they will be blown to bits by some
new "martyr?" I agree with freshman
Ahmed Ashraf ("The Daily's deci
sion to run ads violates Fundamental
Standard," Nov. 6), when he says we
all want "respect for order" and com
passion, but there's a drastic lack of
the above characteristics from Israel's
neighbors and other Arab countries.
Which "subjective opinions" pre
sented as "facts" would Mr. Ashraf
like to dispute? The fact that Pales
tinians danced on the streets on the
day when thousands of American
citizens were burned to death,
jumped out the windows or were
buried alive in the ruins of the World
Trade Center? Or the fact that Pales
tinian suicide bombers prefer to
carry out their attacks in strictly civil
ian areas, like a disco full of teenagers
or a restaurant where people are cel
ebrating a religious holiday?
Let me also remind the support
ers of facts that Israel's neighbors at
tacked her on the most holy day of
the Jewish year in 1973. That fails to
strike me as very respectful of the
Jewish nation. I have witnessed
"cheap stunts and propaganda"
when Palestinian supporters on this
campus formed a tight circle around
students celebrating Israel's inde
pendence day and carried mock
coffins through the crowd of celebra
tors. That's not very sensitive to the
people who have survived through
centuries of persecution and torture
just for their religion, is it?
I applaud The Daily for present
ing the Israeli side of the conflict,
and hope that supporters of the
other side have the tolerance that
they demand from everyone else to
listen to the opposing opinion, as
there can be no meaningful dialogue
with only one side's views tolerated.
ASYA KARCHEMSKIY

I would like to express my regret
that the recent printings of the Cam
pustruth.org advertisements in The

Daily have caused some students to
feel threatened or generalized.
However, I am yet to find a sin
gle person who has felt inspired to
commit violence against any Pales
tinian, Arab or Muslim as a result of
these advertisements, and I certain
ly hope that these fears will never
be actualized. As to the issue of
generalization, the advertisements
try to bring to fight the difficulties of
the Israeli people in dealing with
the situation, and do not imply in
any way that the situation is the
fault of all Palestinians. It is simply
trying to show that all it takes is one
suicide bomber to make a people
and a nation react in the ways that
Israel does, and that as long as the
attacks continue, Israel has no
choice but to defend herself.
I'm worried that some students
who have written letters to The

'Sustainable growth'
misrepresenteain Op-Ed
I can only assume that by running
the same op-ed piece twice in a single
week ("What does sustainable
growth mean?" Oct. 31 and "The
essence of sustainable develop
ment," Nov. 6) the editors of this
newspaper are attempting to send the
Stanford community some kind of
message. I did not know that The
Daily had decided to convert itself
into a public platform for the opaque
and retrograde analyses of the fel
lows of the Hoover Institution. Hav
ing had the pleasure of re-reading this
article, however, I now feel the need
to rebut some of its more egregious
malapropisms and misdirections.
Anderson andHuggins present a
reductive, outdated "definition" of
sustainable development and then
claim to undermine it with some very
specious reasoning. Their assertion
that "resources are becoming less, not
more scarce," cites rising yields of cer
tain staple crops as evidence. This im
plies a myopic and semi-backwards
understanding of ecosystem function
whereby agricultural products are de
fined as environmental resources.
Clearly, food crops are vital
human resources, but what about so
called natural resources such as un
contaminated groundwater, healthy
soils and genetic biodiversity? Surely,
these are as important to the mainte
nance and durability of human life on
earth as the subsidized surplus corn
harvests that the U.S. government
dumps on global food markets at the
end of every growing season.
Sustainable development is not
based on the simplistic belief that,
"economic growth and consump
tion will ultimately run up against
resource limits."
Rather, the ideal of sustainability
strives to reconcile the necessity for
continued human development with
the viability of existing environmen
tal systems. The distinction may ap
pear semantic, but the implications
are clear: Responsible development
need not conflict with ecosystem sta
bility and survival. In other words, we
can â€” act in such a
way so as to avoid further damage to
the environment. This hardly sounds
like gloom-and-doom to me.
In the future, I hope that Ander
son and Huggins will critique a more
contemporary and substantive vi
sion of sustainable development. I
also hope that this newspaper will do
us all the favor of not allowing such
agitational slander to go into print
on more than one occasion. That is,
unless the Hoover Institution wishes
to pay for the advertising space.

Editor's note: The Daily made the
mistake of printing the Op-Ed "What
does sustainable growth mean?"
twice in one week. In no way was this
error intended as a political statement.
Ads from Campustruth.org
should continue running
Let me be one of the few on cam
pus to actually come out in support
of Editor in Chief Ramin Setoodeh
and the Stanford Daily's decision to
continue running the ads. Accusa
tions of racism, demonization and
blanket stereotyping have been
raised by many people in the Stan
ford community.
So why should these so-called
racist, bigoted, terribly insensitive
ads be run?
Simple: Because free speech is at
stake, and because hate speech isn't
an issue. Now I am by no means a
categorical defender of free speech
using racist or sexist slurs is just
wrong but I don't believe that
these ads are examples of hate
speech, and I certainly don't believe
many of the hyperbolic charges lev
eled against their ability to incite vi
olence and increase discrimination.
The Arab-Palestinian conflict is
such an emotionally charged issue
that people can't seem to be objec
tive at any level. These ads do speak
a certain level of truth: There were
mourners in Tel Aviv on Sept. 11,
2001, and there were Palestinian cel
ebrators on the streets on that same
day. Even major television networks
showed the same images. Should we
now censor what is shown on TV as
well? Why not go from there to mag
azines, books maybe even every
day speech?
The ads show fact. Granted, they
are one-sided fact, and granted, they
do show emotionally powerfully im
ages and make emotionally power
ful statements. But the ads are factu
al â€” they don't make up statistics,
they don't make up numbers and
they certainly don't make up the
events. Hate speech, libel, slander;
all of these are at a broad level lies,
misrepresentation or outright mis
truth. The ads do not misrepresent.
They simply represent one side's po
litical views to the emotional anger
of the other's. One of America's
greatest qualities is the right to free
speech the right to express politi
cal opinions even if they may stir
controversy and heated debate. The
ads have certainly done that, and the
dialogue raised on campus can only
help educate and inform.

Why is there such an outcry when
a pro-Israeli side is for once presented
on this campus? Stanford students
pride themselves of tolerance - so why
such abundance of accusations rang
ing from insensitivity to racism in re
sponse to an ad that defends Israel,
who is fighting for her survival and for
the ability of her citizens to let their
children go to school without the fear
that they will be blown to bits by some
new "martyr?" I agree with freshman
Ahmed Ashraf ("The Daily's deci
sion to run ads violates Fundamental
Standard," Nov. 6), when he says we
all want "respect for order" and com
passion, but there's a drastic lack of
the above characteristics from Israel's
neighbors and other Arab countries.
Which "subjective opinions" pre
sented as "facts" would Mr. Ashraf
like to dispute? The fact that Pales
tinians danced on the streets on the
day when thousands of American
citizens were burned to death,
jumped out the windows or were
buried alive in the ruins of the World
Trade Center? Or the fact that Pales
tinian suicide bombers prefer to
carry out their attacks in strictly civil
ian areas, like a disco full of teenagers
or a restaurant where people are cel
ebrating a religious holiday?
Let me also remind the support
ers of facts that Israel's neighbors at
tacked her on the most holy day of
the Jewish year in 1973. That fails to
strike me as very respectful of the
Jewish nation. I have witnessed
"cheap stunts and propaganda"
when Palestinian supporters on this
campus formed a tight circle around
students celebrating Israel's inde
pendence day and carried mock
coffins through the crowd of celebra
tors. That's not very sensitive to the
people who have survived through
centuries of persecution and torture
just for their religion, is it?
I applaud The Daily for present
ing the Israeli side of the conflict,
and hope that supporters of the
other side have the tolerance that
they demand from everyone else to
listen to the opposing opinion, as
there can be no meaningful dialogue
with only one side's views tolerated.
ASYA KARCHEMSKIY

I would like to express my regret
that the recent printings of the Cam
pustruth.org advertisements in The

Daily have caused some students to
feel threatened or generalized.
However, I am yet to find a sin
gle person who has felt inspired to
commit violence against any Pales
tinian, Arab or Muslim as a result of
these advertisements, and I certain
ly hope that these fears will never
be actualized. As to the issue of
generalization, the advertisements
try to bring to fight the difficulties of
the Israeli people in dealing with
the situation, and do not imply in
any way that the situation is the
fault of all Palestinians. It is simply
trying to show that all it takes is one
suicide bomber to make a people
and a nation react in the ways that
Israel does, and that as long as the
attacks continue, Israel has no
choice but to defend herself.
I'm worried that some students
who have written letters to The
Daily seem to use these fears as an
argument against the printing of the
advertisements. It would seem that
some students would much rather
deny the existence of terrorism
against Israel than acknowledge it,
since to do so might seem to incrim
inate the entire Palestinian people.
These people would do much bet
ter to distance themselves from the
actions of some minority of the
Palestinian population; unfortu
nately, they often choose to deny al
together the occurrence of the de
picted events, thus protecting the
deeds of a minority at the expense
of all Palestinians.
In one letter yesterday ("The
Daily's decision to run ads violates
Fundamental Standard," Nov. 6),
Freshman Ahmed Ashraf writes
that the ads "show no respect for
the rights of others ... and show
no compassion for the cumulative
suffering of a displaced, impover
ished and humiliated people with
out a homeland."
On the contrary, the ads don't vi
olate the rights of others, but to cen
sor them would violate the rights of
those who disagree with Mr.
Ashraf s point of view. Additionally,
the ads may not show a great deal of
compassion for Palestinians, but
they do show a great deal of com
passion for Israelis, who are a people
hurt by the terror and constant war
that has been levied against them
unilaterally since the creation of the
state of Israel. We must recognize
these injustices against the Israeli
people, respecting the rights of Is
raelis just as Mr. Ashraf wishes us to
respect the rights of the Palestinians.
There are already many events on
campus that show sympathy for the
plight of the Palestinians. These ad
vertisements choose to show sympa
thy for the plight of the Israelis and
bring people to understand the Israeli
point of view in this conflict. Their
purpose is not to promote violence,
but compassion and understanding
for what Israelis have to deal with
every day for the last 55 years. Their
purpose is not to paint all Palestini
ans, Arabs or Muslims as terrorists,
but to show the Stanford community
that Palestinians are by no means the
only victims in the conflict.

Beilin's diplomatic
role questioned
On Nov. 2, 2003, Hillel among
other groups sponsored Yossi Beilin,
the co-author of the Geneva Accord
(along with Avram Mitzna). It seems
Hillel falls short of its "mission to
bring speakers from a broad spec
trum of political views who will edu
cate the community." The speakers
Hillel sponsors for the most part,
such as Mr. Beilin, seem to only fit a
left-wing paradigm. While I applaud
Hillel's "support of Israel as a Jewish
democratic state," does Yossi Beilin
represent this?
The Geneva agreement is be
tween Palestinian authority figures
and former failed Israeli politicians
with formerly failed initiatives that
have only proven in past agreements
to bring more violence. It is an agree
ment by unauthorized "renegade"
Israelis and undercuts Israel's demo
cratically elected government. In the
United States, we define these limits
to undermine the government as the
Logan Act federal legislation that
makes it a crime for citizens to con
duct negotiations with hostile pow
ers. It is one thing to disagree with a
government, but personal or free
lance diplomacy is opposition to rule
of law and disrespects democracy.
"What makes the actions of Mitz
na and Beilin especially egregious is
that only eight months ago, these
men asked Israel's people to reject
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's lead
ership and give them the responsibil
ity to make peace with the Palestini
ans." The answer they received was

"no." They now seem to hope Amer
ican Jews will support their cause and
promote their initiative at the ex
pense of Israel's government. Some
may think their motives are a sense
of duty and conscience to work for
peace, but this is not an excuse for be
havior that circumvents democracy
and makes "Sharon's position im
possible."
Besides the old agreements of the
past, the Accord adds on initiatives to
drop supervision of weapons smug
gling, limit Israeli security, provides
no time limit for removal of the cur
rent terror infrastructure and allows
Palestinians to arm themselves with
whatever a third party decides.
Worse, among many other initia
tives, it is monitoring international
points of entry under a Multinational
Force, and a permanently open corri
dor linking the West Bank and Gaza
that cannot be closed even if abused.
Israel not only forfeits its sovereignty
over borders but also its right to carry
out defensive operations that are
under multinational authority re
porting to an international body.
Jonathan Elkin, member of the
student board of Hillel, said his orga
nization "hoped the talk will present
a message of hope for the quagmire
we are in now." As Jews, we all sup
port this hope for the harmonious ex
istence of Israel as a democratic state.
Peace is the ideal, we all pray for, but
we must be watchful about peace at
what price. Change in Palestinian in
frastructure and forfeiture of an ide
ology that denies Israel's right to exist
is critical before lasting peace for
both sides can be obtained. We
must not wish so hard that we lose all
sense of reality and reason and de
stroy that which we want most.
