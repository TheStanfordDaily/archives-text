# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## The 						ads must run, like soiled undies 
### 
Bastard is probably my fa
vorite word. I love saying it
aloud. Sometimes I make
up reasons to say it like
when I hit my elbow on the table
(bastard table) or when I trip over
the homeless guy (bastard homeless
guy)-
But last Friday, it wasn't so plea
surable when I had to shake my fist
at the Gods like some old geezer
blowing off steam and shout,
"Those bastards at The Daily!" I
felt as slighted as a half-eaten lob
ster.
Those bastards at The Daily told
me they were going to call me if they
edited my column. They didn't.
Those bastards at The Daily told me
they were going to print my picture
with it, too. They didn't. Worst of
all, those bastards at The Daily
dubbed my column, "A Lighter
Perspective."
You know what? They can take
their lighter perspective and shove
it where the sun don't shine. I'm en
titling this column "Death and De
struction" in protest of The Daily's
disregard for my emotional wants
and needs.
A lot of people have been pissed
with those bastards lately. The
Daily editors are getting spanked
from all ends of the food chain: from
normal students down to Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni all the way to the editors
of The Review. But what can we
make of these attacks? Doesn't it
sound like a bunch of whiner-baby
nobodies who can't go four seconds
without either complaining or
chewing on salami? No? Yeah, I
guess not.
Criticisms from Residential Edu
cation and The Review are easy to
disregard. It's kind of like that ob
noxious poodle in your neighbor
hood. Usually, you just chuckle at
the sorry critter. But sometimes, you
kick it a little when no one is looking
(sorry, Mrs. Flowers).
However, the recent attacks
from the student body require some
serious attention. The Daily's deci
sion to run the Campustruth.org ad

vertisement has sparked a debate
that is more heated than your mom
on Sunday mornings when I used to

deliver the news.
It's a hot de
bate. I can't get
my mind off of it.
Right, so the
debate is hot, but
not hard to re
solve. Here's the
obvious conclu
sion: The Daily
should absolute
ly not stop print
ing the ad. Am I

being redundant when I say, free
dom of speech, freedom of speech?
Some people need to hear that.
The ad doesn't advocate vio
lence. It doesn't encourage hate. It's
not historically inaccurate. It con
tains real photographs that were ac
tually taken and they're adequately
cited. Merely disagreeing with the
interpretation is not grounds for
preventing the ad from running.
But it's offensive, you say? The
word is meaningless to me in this
context. What I consider "offen
sive" is when the chef at Jack in the
Box jizzes on my Double Bacon
Cheeseburger or when some old
dude pulls his pants all the way
down to his socks at the urinal next
to me. This ad, which consists of
photographs labeled with a particu
lar interpretation of an event and
the quotation, "There are two sides
to every story, but only one truth." I
agree with the quote, and I consider
the ad a side of the story not the
one truth. Maybe you're offended
because you fell for it.
But you didn't fall for it. After
all, you're not offended because
you fear that one day you'll open
The Daily and be brainwashed by
the ad. If someone approached you
in the street and showed you and
only you the ad, you wouldn't
call it offensive; you'd just call it
dumb. This ad is only offensive be
cause it reaches other people.
You're suffering from "Smart Kid
Syndrome" and can't accept the fact
that everyone else has the capacity

to read with as skeptical of an eye as
you. Relax. Stanford students are
better at calculus and advanced
physics than the regular population,
but when it comes to gullibility, ev
eryone is about the same. If you
throw a whole lot of information at
people, they're better able to find
the good stuff than if you throw
none. That's the point of freedom of
speech.
And in the end, the ad was a per
fect demonstration of that. Look at
all the letters to the editor and the
diversity of opinions that got print
ed — for free. It was a net gain,
don't you think?
I wholeheartedly reject the opin
ions of those who think the ad
should be pulled. You not only want
to silence one person, but you want
to blind countless others. That kind
of passive approach to promoting
your own ideas is about as worthless
as this column is to realistically
changing your opinion. But at least
I'm trying. You, on the other hand,
make a better door than a window.
In the real world, you have to
work hard to spread the truth. And
it's never really the truth, is it? It's
only your side of the story. When
you stop farting on the couch and
stand up to tell it, we'll be there to
listen. Deal?
Whew, it got heavy for a minute
there. That might happen every so
often in "Death and Destruction,"
especially when people's attacks of
The Daily are misguided. Now that I
am one of those bastards at The
Daily, I'm ready to defend it like a
suburban mom does her pyromani
ac bastard children.
(I don't think I should have to
say this, but I also disagree with the
ad. I took a productive approach,
however, and sent letters to the peo
ple in charge of the Web site argu
ing on a point-by-point basis, you
bastard.)

Senior A.J. Magnuson knows you
hate him now. So, given that, why
don't you go ahead and tell him all
about it in an e-mail addressed to aj

Those bastards at The Daily told me
they were going to print my picture
with it, too. They didn't. Worst of
all, those bastards at The Daily
dubbed my column, "A Lighter
Perspective."
You know what? They can take
their lighter perspective and shove
it where the sun don't shine. I'm en
titling this column "Death and De
struction" in protest of The Daily's
disregard for my emotional wants
and needs.
A lot of people have been pissed
with those bastards lately. The
Daily editors are getting spanked
from all ends of the food chain: from
normal students down to Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni all the way to the editors
of The Review. But what can we
make of these attacks? Doesn't it
sound like a bunch of whiner-baby
nobodies who can't go four seconds
without either complaining or
chewing on salami? No? Yeah, I
guess not.
Criticisms from Residential Edu
cation and The Review are easy to
disregard. It's kind of like that ob
noxious poodle in your neighbor
hood. Usually, you just chuckle at
the sorry critter. But sometimes, you
kick it a little when no one is looking
(sorry, Mrs. Flowers).
However, the recent attacks
from the student body require some
serious attention. The Daily's deci
sion to run the Campustruth.org ad

vertisement has sparked a debate
that is more heated than your mom
on Sunday mornings when I used to

deliver the news.
It's a hot de
bate. I can't get
my mind off of it.
Right, so the
debate is hot, but
not hard to re
solve. Here's the
obvious conclu
sion: The Daily
should absolute
ly not stop print
ing the ad. Am I

being redundant when I say, free
dom of speech, freedom of speech?
Some people need to hear that.
The ad doesn't advocate vio
lence. It doesn't encourage hate. It's
not historically inaccurate. It con
tains real photographs that were ac
tually taken and they're adequately
cited. Merely disagreeing with the
interpretation is not grounds for
preventing the ad from running.
But it's offensive, you say? The
word is meaningless to me in this
context. What I consider "offen
sive" is when the chef at Jack in the
Box jizzes on my Double Bacon
Cheeseburger or when some old
dude pulls his pants all the way
down to his socks at the urinal next
to me. This ad, which consists of
photographs labeled with a particu
lar interpretation of an event and
the quotation, "There are two sides
to every story, but only one truth." I
agree with the quote, and I consider
the ad a side of the story not the
one truth. Maybe you're offended
because you fell for it.
But you didn't fall for it. After
all, you're not offended because
you fear that one day you'll open
The Daily and be brainwashed by
the ad. If someone approached you
in the street and showed you and
only you the ad, you wouldn't
call it offensive; you'd just call it
dumb. This ad is only offensive be
cause it reaches other people.
You're suffering from "Smart Kid
Syndrome" and can't accept the fact
that everyone else has the capacity

to read with as skeptical of an eye as
you. Relax. Stanford students are
better at calculus and advanced
physics than the regular population,
but when it comes to gullibility, ev
eryone is about the same. If you
throw a whole lot of information at
people, they're better able to find
the good stuff than if you throw
none. That's the point of freedom of
speech.
And in the end, the ad was a per
fect demonstration of that. Look at
all the letters to the editor and the
diversity of opinions that got print
ed — for free. It was a net gain,
don't you think?
I wholeheartedly reject the opin
ions of those who think the ad
should be pulled. You not only want
to silence one person, but you want
to blind countless others. That kind
of passive approach to promoting
your own ideas is about as worthless
as this column is to realistically
changing your opinion. But at least
I'm trying. You, on the other hand,
make a better door than a window.
In the real world, you have to
work hard to spread the truth. And
it's never really the truth, is it? It's
only your side of the story. When
you stop farting on the couch and
stand up to tell it, we'll be there to
listen. Deal?
Whew, it got heavy for a minute
there. That might happen every so
often in "Death and Destruction,"
especially when people's attacks of
The Daily are misguided. Now that I
am one of those bastards at The
Daily, I'm ready to defend it like a
suburban mom does her pyromani
ac bastard children.
(I don't think I should have to
say this, but I also disagree with the
ad. I took a productive approach,
however, and sent letters to the peo
ple in charge of the Web site argu
ing on a point-by-point basis, you
bastard.)

Senior A.J. Magnuson knows you
hate him now. So, given that, why
don't you go ahead and tell him all
about it in an e-mail addressed to aj
magnu@stanford.edu?

Bastard is probably my fa
vorite word. I love saying it
aloud. Sometimes I make
up reasons to say it like
when I hit my elbow on the table
(bastard table) or when I trip over
the homeless guy (bastard homeless
guy)-
But last Friday, it wasn't so plea
surable when I had to shake my fist
at the Gods like some old geezer
blowing off steam and shout,
"Those bastards at The Daily!" I
felt as slighted as a half-eaten lob
ster.
Those bastards at The Daily told
me they were going to call me if they
edited my column. They didn't.
