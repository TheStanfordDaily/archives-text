# JACK AND JILL, MINUS JACK
## The
						difficulties of dealing with race 
### 
U-w- 'm not white!" my
friend yelled at me
as we stood wash
-A. ing the dishes in
our off-campus kitchen. He
chuckled a little after he said
that to ease the indignant tone
he had just assumed. I stared
at his skin incredulously, but
took his word for it. After all,
he did have an interesting eth
nic background, no matter
what his skin tone.
While cleaning up after din
ner, we'd been bemoaning the
lack of racial diversity in our
house. "Is everyone in the
house white?" I'd questioned.
After thinking through it, we
realized that our house of 15
people had one Middle East
ern-Caucasian-unclassifiable
and one light-skinned native of
Mexico. The rest of us were of
the boring white majority
(sorry, guys). The result of this
conversation?
We were perplexed.
Race has been a stitch in my
side ever since I got to Stan
ford. Growing up in the South,
you'd think I'd already be
more than aware of race is
sues. But before I came to col
lege, I didn't think on a daily
basis about the atrocities and
pain that members of my race
have caused all others in
American (and world) history.
In high school, I was disap
pointed by history, but I didn't
rack my brain over the "whys"
or feel plagued by my inability
to fix the problem of racism.
During my first few years of
college, Stanford's focus on di
versity served to cultivate in me
a deep respect for non-majority
races and non-majority ethnici
ties. If you weren't white or of
European descent, then at least
a little piece of me looked at
you in awe. Maybe I'd begun to
believe that all minorities had

to overcome oppression or
racism. At

minimum, I
believed that
any foreign fa
milial back
ground was
interesting,
and because it
was interest
ing it was
something to
be proud of.

There was
nothing about "German,"
"American," or "white" that
seemed to merit any attention
from my fellow students. What
did I bring to Stanford's diversi
ty? Was I just the "control
group" in an otherwise great
experiment seeking to cele
brate racial diversity?
My most recent years at Stan
ford have turned my subtle awe of
diversity into more of a white
man's guilt. By taking classes like
"Writings by Women of Color,"
which made me hypersensitive
about issues of race, I began to
think incessantly about the num
ber of people that can validly re
sent white people. I read quotes
like this from Ann Cook: "Cau
casians, especially the U.S. vari
ety, are noted for their ruthless de
struction of the cultures of others
whatever parts they can reach
and their vulgarization of what
remains."
Of course I agree. How dare
I not? Cook also writes, "Even
though I identify with other
colored peoples of the world,
since we all share a common
exploiter, and I know that
being the majority of the
world's population, we should
unite to defeat this man ..."
To which I think, well . . .
yes. Judging from history, the
white man probably should be
completely annihilated.
What began as a celebra

tion of those different from
me bled into an internalized
hatred of my race's mundane
even shameful past. My
patient, loving fellow students
tell me not to feel this hate and
that it's not my fault, but my
heart still aches from the
knowledge of my past. People
always say that ignorance is
bliss, and sometimes it seems I
would have been better served
never learning history. Could
I live just as well, minus the
guilt, if I had been born color
blind?
Only after graduating from
Stanford has my race guilt
begun to fade. It is primarily by
the continued love and support
of my non-white friends that
I'm becoming convinced to let
go of my race complex. I find
this quite ironic or maybe
just fitting that my worries
about being an invalid voice on
racial issues are being resolved
by the very people who I
thought would never want to
listen to me because they'd
have nothing to gain.
I suppose this question re
mains: What do people have
to gain from me? I can't fully
answer this question myself,
but I now claim that all kinds
of diversity are significant, not
just diversity based on appear
ance.
I'm starting to believe that
I have a role to play in an en
vironment that thrives on di
versity because my contribu
tions are not just "typically
white," or "typically female,"
but rather, "typically Jill."
