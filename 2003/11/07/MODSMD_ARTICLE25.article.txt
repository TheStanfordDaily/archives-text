## I'm a quitter and I'm not the only one 
### 
As far as I cared, and I didn't par
ticularly care, they were just
weak. They hid behind the
maintenance shed, lied about
how many of the 8 3/4 dizzying laps they
had meandered, complained of heat ex
haustion. My favorite was a fast guy named
Carey who, frustrated at how a 12-year-old
girl in a bra kicked his ass in the one-mile
every time we ran it in P.E., choked on his
own phlegm with half a lap to go and melo
dramatically collapsed as I hurdled his as
phyxiating body to victory.
I was a runner. Saucony Jazz 3000's,
prescription sunglasses, the works. When
everyone else socialized, munched on
M&M's and killed time at junior high track
meets, I was alone in a high corner of the
bleachers, eating bananas and hydrating
between 1600,800 and 400 meter races.

No fun.
But in my first
place prescription sun
glass-protected eyes,
quitters sucked even
more than slackers.
Carey pathetically
gave up after trying so
hard, which was only
slightly worse than not
trying at all. He would

go on in eighth grade to exude awkward
pre-pubescent taunts of "Julie Run-For-
Fun!" while some fat bully named Ariel
(no joke, Ariel like the Little Mermaid)
chucked my brand new Jazz 3000's into the
sprinklers.
Definitely no fun.
In the off-season I trained in 5Ks. I got
recruited by private trainers and spied on
as my rival's parents would videotape my
performances, and at 14 I set the Mount
SAC record in the 800 meter.
A week later I quit forever.
Here you're thinking: Did Julie really
spend four paragraphs cataloguing her
glory days as a runner at an age when most
kids were eating hot dogs at pool parties
and slow-dancing to "End of the Road"?
I was a quitter. And guess what, Stan
ford athletics is full of them. Walk-ons,
players on national championship
teams, Dead Housers, frat presidents.
Perhaps you didn't even realize they
stopped playing. And they're still get
ting athlete perks?
According to Doug Johnstone, former
volleyball player, some girls make sure
they're hitting on athletes and not wasting
their time. On more than one occasion he's
been asked what sport he plays before a
"hi," "I looked you up on gostanford" or
"wow you're drinking a Keystone light
great me too!"
Athlete perks, remember, are all those
hidden and not-so-hidden treats the varsi
ty athletes get, including an "in" to the elu
sive Athlete's Formal every year. I went
once ... with a girl from water polo.
We've been so inundated from day one
that quitters aren't winners. Quitters give
up just when things get hard. Quitters
aren't Stanford material.
What happens when it's just not worth it
anymore? Some people quit and some
people stick it out.
Why quit? Maybe all the rad people left
the team, maybe you messed up your back,
maybe you were studying in Australia and
it was a better life choice to stay, even if it
meant leaving two straight years of NCAA
championships and a great team and
coaches, as was the case for Lizzy Bennett
on the tennis team. Shoot, I spent three
quarters lounging on Ipanema beach last
year and it was definitely a better life
choice. No doubt. And Lizzy still gets the
special zipper sweats.
That crazy guy in White Plaza yesterday
is a quitter too. You know, the one whose
sign proclaimed that God is angry at Ankle
Biters, Dykes on Bikes and Misc. Hea
thens? He's a retired police officer.
Welcome to the quitter's club. We rock
high school sweats, we run aimless circles
on Campus Loop, we pay for our meals at
Stern. (Okay, not exactly true ... only the
football team gets free food and I always
used to just sneak in anyway).
I stopped running and to most people I
stopped being a runner. They started see
ing the actress, the softball player, the trav
eler, the deejay, the ballerina. But it
doesn't matter who sees what, because we
do this for ourselves, right?
American standout and legally blind
marathon runner Maria Runvan had sore
legs in New York this Sunday, while enthu
siastic hordes of fans yelled at her to keep
her spirits up. They didn't understand it
wasn't her day.
Do whatever the hell you want. Your
viewing public has a short attention span
anyway.

check her out Monday afternoons on 90.1
KZSU. And Spencer, stop telling chicks
you're a walk-on.
