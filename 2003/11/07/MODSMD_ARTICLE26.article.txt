# Polo hits road for two games
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Cardinal men's water polo team
enters its second weekend of important league
games this Saturday and Sunday with away
games against No. 13 Pacific and No. 2 Califor
nia. A win over Cal might move Stanford up a
notch in the rankings.
The Golden Bears are currently 4-2 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and 17-4
overall. The Tigers (5-15, 0-6) are at the bottom
of the MPSF standings and were trounced by
Cal last weekend.
Still, the Cardinal knows that each game
counts at this point in the season.
"We have to be sure not to overlook [the
Tigers] even though they are in last place," said
junior two-meter Sam Tyre. "It's still a league
game and important to our standings."
Freshman driver JJ Garton, who usually
sees about a half's worth of play each game,
hopes to see some more pool time against Pa
cific on Saturday.
"Maybe a little more time than before, but
I'm happy seeing the time that I have," he said.
Both Stanford and Cal are in the midst of
winning streaks. The Cardinal has won six
consecutive games and the Bears are not far
behind with five straight victories. Stanford
has only lost one game on the road in non
tournament play, a loss to Southern Califor-

The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo heads to No. 13 Pacific and No. 2 Cal for two crucial league games this weekend.
nia. The Bears have-only lost
once at home this season.
Whenever the rivals meet, their
fierce matches are attended by
local fans of both teams.
"We definitely know each
other's teams well," Tyre said. "It's
always tough to play with their
crowd because they're so close to
the pool."
The teams have met twice
this year. Stanford defeated
Cal 10-5 in a Sept. 21 matchup
in the Southern California
Tournament. However, the

Cardinal failed to repeat its
success in the championship
game of the Northern Califor
nia Tournament held at Stan
ford on Oct. 5. The Cardinal
fell to the Bears 10-9 in sud
den-death overtime.
"We're both one-and-one with
each other this season and this
game will separate us and give us
the edge," Garton said.
A key this weekend will be
keeping cool under pressure, a skill
that was honed in last Sunday's
slug-fest with Pepperdine. The
Bears will certainly come out hard
against the Cardinal, but Stan
ford's focus is on playing clean
water polo, according to players.
"They get overly aggressive
and try to get into our heads,"

Garton said. "We have to play
our own game."
Stanford and Cal are the two
most successful water polo teams in
the nation. The Bears have gar
nered 11 NCAA titles and the Car
dinal is a close second with 10.
Stanford is the two-time defending
national champion after its victory
over Cal in the 2002 NCAA tour
nament.
A victory over Cal this weekend
could well be a prelude to this
year's NCAA finals.
"This game will set the tone for
the rest of the season," Tyre said.
The leading scorer for the
Bears is three-time All-Ameri
can Attila Banhidy (46 goals),
who shared MPSF Player of the
Week honors with Stanford ju

nior Tony Azevedo after the
NorCal Tournament. Azevedo
has 55 goals this season.
Unlike the Cardinal, the Bears
have a bench full of veterans with
eight senior players, including
goalie Tim Kates.
"The size of the squad and the
emotion evoked by that squad is
hard to play against," Tyre said.
"It's not experience but whoever
sets the tone for the game that
comes out on top."
This Sunday's match will be
played at noon at the Spieker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley. It
will be the final home game this
season for the Bears.
The Cardinal will also play Cal
in this year's Big Splash, at 10 a.m.
on Nov. 22 before Big Game

Senior middle blocker Jennifer Harvey will have to be on top of her game if the
No. 7 women's volleyball team is to avenge an early-season loss to Cal tonight.
