# For volleyball, it's payback time

Prior to its loss to California on Oct.
11, the Stanford women's volleyball
team hadn't lost to the Golden Bears
since Oct. 1, 1982 before most of
Stanford's undergraduate students were
even born.
When the two teams met in Berkeley
earlier this season, the Cardinal was
ranked No. 4 in the country with an un
blemished 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference
record while No. 9 California was a per
fect 16-0. The meeting was the first time

the Bay-Area rivals had met when both
were in the nation's top 10.
Stanford led California 2-1, but the
Golden Bears overcame an early six-point
deficit to come back and win game four,
30-28.The Bears took this momentum into
the decisive game, winning 15-9.
The loss, Stanford's fourth to Cal in 55
meetings, dropped the Cardinal to No. 7 in
the AVCA/USA Today Coach's Poll and
vaulted the Golden Bears to No. 5 their
first appearance in the top five in school
history.
This Friday night, however, the No. 8
Cardinal (17-5, 10-3 Pac-10) can avenge

that loss, as the No. 9 Golden Bears (19-3,
10-3) make the trip across the bay for a 7
p.m. rematch in Maples Pavilion.
"As a team, we know we're better than
the last time we played them," said Stan
ford sophomore setter Katie Goldhahn.
"We simulated a game so we could learn
their tendencies and we know that they are
going to bring their A game. We are ready
and we are excited for the chance to get re
venge for the game at Cal, because it was
such a hard place to play and this time we'll
have the support of our fans."
Any match against Cal carries extra ex
citement, but the hoopla surrounding this

"Big Spike" is fueled not only by the
teams' heated match earlier this season
but also by the repercussions the outcome
of tonight's match will have on conference
standings.
No. IUSC, who is not only undefeated,
but also on a 34-game winning streak that
extends back to last year's win over Stan
ford in the NGAA championship match,
leads the Pac-10. The Trojans hold a three
match lead over both Stanford and Cali
fornia, and a four-match lead over UCLA,
who lost in Arizona last night.
