# For volleyball, it's payback time
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Prior to its loss to California on Oct.
11, the Stanford women's volleyball
team hadn't lost to the Golden Bears
since Oct. 1, 1982 before most of
Stanford's undergraduate students were
even born.
When the two teams met in Berkeley
earlier this season, the Cardinal was
ranked No. 4 in the country with an un
blemished 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference
record while No. 9 California was a per
fect 16-0. The meeting was the first time

the Bay-Area rivals had met when both
were in the nation's top 10.
Stanford led California 2-1, but the
Golden Bears overcame an early six-point
deficit to come back and win game four,
30-28.The Bears took this momentum into
the decisive game, winning 15-9.
The loss, Stanford's fourth to Cal in 55
meetings, dropped the Cardinal to No. 7 in
the AVCA/USA Today Coach's Poll and
vaulted the Golden Bears to No. 5 their
first appearance in the top five in school
history.
This Friday night, however, the No. 8
Cardinal (17-5, 10-3 Pac-10) can avenge

that loss, as the No. 9 Golden Bears (19-3,
10-3) make the trip across the bay for a 7
p.m. rematch in Maples Pavilion.
"As a team, we know we're better than
the last time we played them," said Stan
ford sophomore setter Katie Goldhahn.
"We simulated a game so we could learn
their tendencies and we know that they are
going to bring their A game. We are ready
and we are excited for the chance to get re
venge for the game at Cal, because it was
such a hard place to play and this time we'll
have the support of our fans."
Any match against Cal carries extra ex
citement, but the hoopla surrounding this

"Big Spike" is fueled not only by the
teams' heated match earlier this season
but also by the repercussions the outcome
of tonight's match will have on conference
standings.
No. IUSC, who is not only undefeated,
but also on a 34-game winning streak that
extends back to last year's win over Stan
ford in the NGAA championship match,
leads the Pac-10. The Trojans hold a three
match lead over both Stanford and Cali
fornia, and a four-match lead over UCLA,
who lost in Arizona last night.
With five Pac-10 matches re
maining for each team, tonight's
match could prove decisive inifinal
conference standings. Next week,
the Cardinal travels to Los Angeles
for matches against USC and
UCLA.
"With USC so far ahead, we
have to be realistic and realize that
we are fighting for second place in
the Pac-10 with Cal and UCLA,
which gives us even more of a rea
son to come out strong against Cal,"
Goldhahn said.
This time around, Stanford will
look to shut out California's offen
sive leader, junior outside hitter Mia
Jerkov, who had a match-high 31
kills in the teams' first matchup and

is averaging 5.90 kills per game.
Jerkov has torn through the Pac-10,
being named Pac-10 Player of the
Week four times this season — in
cluding after the match against Stan
ford— while no other player has
been awarded the honor more than
once this season.
The Cardinal, however, might be
without senior middle blocker Sara
McGee, who has been hampered by
a foot injury.
Senior Sara Dukes will fill in
again tonight if McGee can't play,
teaming with senior middle blocker
Jennifer Harvey, who leads the Pac
10 in blocks.
"Sara [McGee] just started jump
ing in practice and she's getting back
in the swing of things and reconnect
ing with the setters," Goldhahn said.
"Dukes has been doing a great job fill
ing in — she had a lot of pressure on
her and everyone is proud of her."
