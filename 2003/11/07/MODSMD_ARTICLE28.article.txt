# Hoops on exhibition

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 7 Stanford women's bas
ketball team will unofficially open its
season this Sunday at 2 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion in an exhibition
against Love and Basketball.
However, the Cardinal has
caught an early injury bug and will be
without several key players in its
opener.
Junior forward Azella Perryman
(ankle), redshirt freshman forward
Eziamaka Okafor (torn achilles ten
don), senior guard Katie Denny
(sprained MCL) and junior forward
T'Nae Thiel (broken foot) will all be
forced to sit.
Additionally, redshirt juniors
Chelsea Trotter and Susan King-
Borchardt are banged up, but will
still take the floor. Trotter has expe
rienced chronic knee pain since her
arrival to the Farm and King-Bor
chardt is recovering from a high
ankle sprain.
Think this sounds horribly famil
iar?
Last year, Stanford was without
senior Nicole Powell, Okafor and
Denny, while King-Borchardt
wasn't 100 percent after ACL
surgery and Trotter, as always, was
playing with knee pain.
"It's not anything that I feel like I
can control," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "So I've
really focused on the people that are
healthy and I try and give them the
best opportunity to be successful."
While dressing just nine players
will certainly be a challenge for the
Cardinal, it's not anything it hasn't
seen before.
A month and a half ago, the
squad was on an exhibition tour of
Italy and faced an almost identical
situation.
"When we played in Italy, we
pretty much only had eight players,"
VanDerveer said. "Eight different
players than we have now, but we're
confident that Katie and Azella will
be back soon."
While Sunday's game essentially
means nothing, VanDerveer will
keep a close eye on several key com
ponents in the Cardinal's game and

in its defense in particular.
"We've worked really hard on
our defense," she said. "We have
seven key things that we've worked
really hard to improve on and
we've also been working on our
zone defense."
The Cardinal defense looks to
improve after leading the Pacific 10
Conference in points allowed per
game, giving up just 58.9.
At the other end of the floor,
Stanford is not short on offensive
firepower, even without Thiel,
Perryman, Okafor and Denny.
Junior guard Kelley Suminski, a
First Team All-Pac-10 selection
last season, has matured into an all
around scoring threat after averag
ing 11.4 points per game in her
sophomore season and junior for
ward Sebnem Kimyacioglu is dead
ly accurate from beyond the three
point stripe.
Last year, the 5-foot-11 forward
led the team in three pointers

made, sinking 70 over the course of
the season.
And then there's Powell. The
senior All-American forward is
arguably the most versatile play
er in the country and owns six of
the 12 triple doubles in Pac-10
history.
Still, VanDerveer isn't content.
"We want to run more," she
said. "We want to get the ball inside
better. We want to execute overall
better. We want to use our screens
better. We're an excellent shooting
team. We just have to find the open
shot and convert."
While the Cardinal clearly has
holes to fill in its lineup, the exhibi
tion season will serve as a gauge to
see how the team can cope with its
missing links.
"We're not going to wait around
until people get healthy," Van-
Derveer said. "We have games on
our schedule that we have to get
ready for."
