# Card men stop skid, win 5-1
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
On Wednesday, Stanford junior Darren Fer
nandez spoke confidently about his squad's
chances to claim a long-awaited win in yesterday's
matchup with San Jose State (10-5-2).
"It's our time now," he said.
And apparently Fernandez wasn't willing to be
proven wrong.
The forward contributed a goal and three assists
in Stanford's 5-1 blowout victory over the Spar
tans, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
champion.
The game marks the Cardinal's (3-14-2, 0-9 Pa
cific 10 Conference) first win after a nine-game
slump and the five goals were more than the squad
has scored in the past 10 games combined.
"We've been fighting hard all season," said Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon. "We almost had it in
Washington. We almost had it in Oregon. This day
was coming."
A Spartan goal just seven minutes before the
half a Dylan Pender header off of a long throw
in made it look as though Stanford would have
a challenge in trying to hand San Jose its first home
loss of the season.
That is, until a couple of minutes later, when
Fernandez and junior Matt Janusz teamed up on
bringing the ball downfield and found freshman
midfielder Marcus Ryan. Ryan charged up the left
side of the field and booted his first collegiate goal
past Spartan goalkeeper Tyler Tratten.
The Cardinal team that returned to the field
after halftime did nothing short of amaze.
Though it took Stanford 10 games to find itself
a win, the offense took less than 10 minutes to find
the back of the net three more times.
In the 45th minute, senior co-captain Mike Wil
son knocked a pass to Fernandez, and from 10
yards out, the forward blasted his fourth goal of the
season and his second game-winning goal
past Tratten.
Minutes later, Fernandez was in action again,
this time recovering a turnover in front of the net,
which he slipped to Ryan. Ryan, who is second on
the team in shots, collected his second goal of the game
on the play.
By the 50th minute, it became clear that the Spartan
defense couldn't contain Fernandez, who dealt yet an
other assist to Janusz on a breakaway. Janusz put the ball
in to give his team a 4-1 lead.
"I don't know what it was," Ryan said of the change
that prompted his team's offensive charge. "I think there
was just some subtle shift in mentality that made us more
comfortable in front of the goal."
The Cardinal's final goal a breakaway off a forced
turnover came off the foot of Janusz once again. The

boot helped him reclaim his spot as Stanford's leader in
goals scored, a considerable feat as the forward has been
missing from the team's starting lineup for a month.
"It's frustrating to be hurt, especially when your team
isn't playing as well as you know it can," Janusz said. "It
felt good to be out there scoring goals again."
By the time that the scoreboard read 5-1, the Cardi
nal was already frantically substituting players, and
every single healthy athlete on the squad got time on
the field.
"We still made some mistakes ... but our attacking is
coming along," Simon said. "We play in a strong confer
ence and I think that has hardened us."
Though the offense mounted the scoring fury, the
Cardinal's defensive specialists, including sophomore
Chad Marshall and senior Abe Geiger, were the un
sung heroes of the win. The defense held the Spartans'

two leading scorers, Johnny Gonzalez and Randy Pog
gio, without a single shot in the game. San Jose State
was held to 10 shots on the afternoon, four of which fell
on goal.
Freshman goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen, who filled
in for injured starting junior Robby Fulton, recorded
three saves and his second win of the season.
"It would have been easy, since we're having a bad
season, to let these last few [games] slip," Janusz said.
"This is really a testament to our seniors, who just keep
us working hard."
The squad considers the victory a bit of a gift to those
seniors, Wilson and Geiger, who will be playing their
final game in Cardinal red next weekend.
"Even though they won't be here next year, we want
ed to show them that they're giving us something that
we're carrying over to next year," Janusz said.
