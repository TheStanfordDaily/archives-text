# ASU yet to rise to expectations

### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State quarterback An
drew Walter has been holding weekly
press conferences this season—prob
ably the only QB in the nation to do so
because the Sun Devils media rela
tions people wanted to boost his Heis
man candidacy.
With the way things have been
going for Walter and company, the se
nior may feel like he's been wasting his
time with the überhype.
When asked about ASU's 62-24
blitzing of Stanford last season, Wal
ter's comments really sum up his
team's downward spiral.
"That seems like decades ago," he
said.
Recall that Arizona State, even
after losing star wide receiver Shaun
McDonald and stud defensive end

Terrell Suggs to the NFL, was still
picked a close second behind USC in
the preseason media poll because of
Walter and its experienced offensive
line and secondary.
So much for that.
The Sun Devils, at 1-4, are tied for
second-to-last in the conference with
the Cardinal and have not even come
close to meeting those gigantic presea
son expectations.
"Our season has not gone like we
thought it would," Arizona State head
coach Dirk Koetter conceded. "We
are worried about how we are playing
and what we are doing."
Last week's 51-23 loss to California
might have been the low point for the
Sun Devils.
Consider these humiliating notes:
