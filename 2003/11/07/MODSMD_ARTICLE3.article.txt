# ASU yet to rise to expectations
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State quarterback An
drew Walter has been holding weekly
press conferences this season—prob
ably the only QB in the nation to do so
because the Sun Devils media rela
tions people wanted to boost his Heis
man candidacy.
With the way things have been
going for Walter and company, the se
nior may feel like he's been wasting his
time with the überhype.
When asked about ASU's 62-24
blitzing of Stanford last season, Wal
ter's comments really sum up his
team's downward spiral.
"That seems like decades ago," he
said.
Recall that Arizona State, even
after losing star wide receiver Shaun
McDonald and stud defensive end

Terrell Suggs to the NFL, was still
picked a close second behind USC in
the preseason media poll because of
Walter and its experienced offensive
line and secondary.
So much for that.
The Sun Devils, at 1-4, are tied for
second-to-last in the conference with
the Cardinal and have not even come
close to meeting those gigantic presea
son expectations.
"Our season has not gone like we
thought it would," Arizona State head
coach Dirk Koetter conceded. "We
are worried about how we are playing
and what we are doing."
Last week's 51-23 loss to California
might have been the low point for the
Sun Devils.
Consider these humiliating notes:
The Golden Bears scored on eight
straight possessions.
Cal running back Adimchinobe Echemandu ran
for a career-high 201 yards
And Bears quarterback Aaron Rodgers thrdw for
307 yards and three touchdowns and was named Pac
-10 offensive player of the week for his efforts.
"We got our butts kicked last week, plain and sim
ple," Koetter said. "It was not a fun day."
Walter didn't have much fun either. He start
ed even though he was suffering a lingering
knee injury from the previous week's game
against UCLA and threw a 32-yard touch
down pass before the swelling and pain forced
him out of the game at the end of the third quar
ter. He finished only 11-of-26 for 170 yards with
two interceptions in one of the worst games of
his career.
According to Koetter, Walter is "healthier right
now than he was last week at this time." He said he
expects Walter to be close to 100 percent by game
time tomorrow.
Though he has battled through injuries and a
woeful season, Walter's numbers are still respectable
but not Heisman-worthy, like many had expected.
He has completed 53 percent of his passes, has a
16-to-8 touchdown-to-interception ratio and has
thrown for 2,144 yards.
"He is as good a quarterback as there is in this
league," said Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens.
Some other things have gone right for Arizona
State, too.
Redshirt freshman running back Loren Wade
had his third consecutive 100-yard game against Cal
and has scored four touchdowns in the last five
weeks. Junior free safety Jason Shivers is also the
Pac-10's second-leading tackier with 80.
But individual accomplishments have meant
very little to this underachieving squad, which has
lost five of its last seven games after starting the
season 2-0.
So what exactly has led to this dismal of a year?
You might guess the Sun Devils are missing Mc-
Donald and Suggs more than they ever imagined
they would, but that does not seem to be the case.
Wideouts Derek Hagan (47 catches, 674 yards,
four touchdowns) and Skyler Fulton (45,621,8) have
more than admirably filled the shoes of the big-play
threat McDonald. And the Sun Devils, with seven
players with at least two sacks, are still in the middle
to-top of the conference in sacks.
It's probably more likely that Arizona State has
fallen because its defense has struggled in areas that
Stanford's defense has thrived.
The Sun Devils are last in the conference in red

zone defense, allowing opponents to score 26-of-31
times inside the 20 including 20 touchdowns. (The
Cardinal defense, on the other hand, has found a way
to stiffen in that area and has allowed only 17 red
zone scores all year.)
Arizona State is also ranked ninth in the Pac-10 in
rushing defense, allowing nearly 155 yards a game on
the ground. (Stanford is fourth in the conference and
at one time had the nation's leading run defense.)
That latter problem for the Sun Devils was mag
nified last week with Echemandu's performance.
"We didn't wrap up and finish tackles very well,"
Koetter said. "We'd have guys in position and have
them stopped, but their back did a great job of spin
ning out.
The more we pressed to stop their run game, the
more they were able to play-action and throw the ball

over our head."
More than anything, however, the Sun Devils
have been a wholly inconsistent team; they beat Ore
gon 59-14 but have lost to ranked lowa, USC and
Oregon State.
"We've been really up-and-down," Koetter said.
Unpredictability has been the norm of the confer
ence this year, though. The Sun Devils beat the
Ducks, who blitzed the Cardinal, who then beat
UCLA who had already defeated Arizona State.
"I think that says a lot about the balance of the
conference," Koetter said. "You better not take any
body lightly, or you'll get your lunch handed to you."
Obviously, Arizona State has been getting its
lunch handed to it far too much this year and Palo
Alto might be the place for the Sun Devils to start
heading in the right direction.

Arizona State quarterback Andrew Walter was expected to lead the Sun Devils to national prominence
this season. The junior has been solid, but not extraordinary, and his team is a disappointing 1-4 in
conference play.
