# Women close out season versus Cal
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
It's come down to the final game for the Stan
ford women's soccer team (9-8-2, 4-3-1 Pacific 10
Conference). The Cardinal will be fighting for a
playoff berth when it faces California (7-7-4,2-5-1)
at Maloney Field tonight at 7 p.m. on Senior Night.
Stanford will attempt to bounce back from last
Sunday's disappointing shutout loss to Washing
ton State (6-9-2,2-3-2) and make a strong case for
an at-large NCAA tournament berth.
"The team should be really pumped up and
ready to play," said Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe.
Defenders Natalie Spilger, Alisan Pabon and
Anna Hare, midfielder Ally Marquand and for
ward Brittany Oliveira will all be making their last
appearances at Maloney Field. The five seniors
will be honored in a ceremony preceding tonight's
game.
As always, Stanford will look to score early.
The squad has a 5-0 record when leading at half
time and is 0-5 when trailing at the half.
Offensive struggles have plagued the Cardinal
all season. In particular, the front line has had trou
ble scoring.
The Cardinal's leading goal scorer comes from
the midfield in Marquand, who has found the back
of the net eight times this season.
Stanford's defense, however, led by Spilger and
redshirt junior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart, has
been solid.
The durable Spilger has played every minute of
every game for the Cardinal this season, while
Barnhart has been Stanford's lone Pac-10 Player
of the Week selection.
Additionally, Barnhart was named to the CoSI
DA Academic All-District VIII Team yesterday.
Barnhart has posted seven shutouts and 60 saves
for the Cardinal.
In addition to how well the Cardinal executes
on both ends of the field, the weather will likely
play a factor in tonight's matchup.
"It's hard to say who would be favored if it
rains," Ratcliffe said. "But our field is in great con
dition, so hopefully things won't get too sloppy."
Stanford, which holds an 11-8-2 edge all-time
against the Bears, didn't seem to mind the pouring
rain in last Friday's 3-0 upset win over No. 14
Washington (10-5-3,3-3-1).
Cal's offense has been strong all year long, in
cluding a nine-goal outburst in its season opener.

The Bears have also won with defense. Three
weeks ago, it came away with an impressive 3-0
shutout against offensive-minded Arizona.
While Stanford boasts one of the stingiest de
fenses in the country, it will be challenged by se
nior midfielder Kim Yokers.
Yokers joined Stanford tri-captains Marquand,
Barnhart and Spilger on the Under-21 National
Team that won the Nordic Cup this summer. Yok
ers is tied with forward Kassie Doubrava for the
team lead in goals with three apiece.
While Ratcliffe recognized Cal's strengths,
he believes the game will come down to more
than just playing the Bears' strengths and weak
nesses.

"I think you have to throw [the scouting] out
the window," he said. "With so much on the line,
playoffs, the rivalry ... it's going to be a battle."
In preparation for the matchup, Stanford has
been working on its possession game and, as usual,
its finishing.
"We will need to have good execution and keep
our composure," Ratcliffe said. "We need to make
this a soccer match rather than a fight."
Friday's game will mark just the third week of
the season that the Cardinal will have all of its
players healthy and playing together.
"I feel like we're starting to peak at the right
time," sophomore Jenny Farenbaugh said. "The
seniors are making a huge impact for us."
