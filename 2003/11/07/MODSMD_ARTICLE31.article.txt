### MOLLY QUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's crew team will close
its fall season on Sunday at the Head of the
Lake regatta in Seattle, Wash.
As the defending champions and top seed,
the women's varsity eight will go head-to-head
against some of the top teams in the nation.
"We'll see a lot of fast teams this weekend,
which always makes for an exciting race," said
senior captain and coxswain Wendy Hoeveler.
"Because we won last year we will be starting
first, with everyone charging at us, really push
ing us to row well and hard."
The team's main competitors on Sunday
will be second-seed University of Washington,
Washington State and University of Virginia.
"Our strategy is to go all out from the start
of this race and to have nothing left as we cross
the finish line," junior Missy Fiesler said.
Junior Susan Be Ville and sophomore
Alexis Peterson will be sidelined due to back
injuries and will be replaced by freshmen

Stephanie Connolly and Carly York.
Because of the intensity of the fall training
schedule, the team looks forward to the few
chances it actually gets to race.
"For all of us, just getting a chance to race
against other people is the most rewarding as
pect of all the double days we put in through
out the year," Hoeveler said.
After Sunday, Stanford crew teams will not
compete formally until March, when the
spring "main" season begins. If the fall season
is any indication, the women's varsity eight has
great expectations for the spring and the
NCAA competition.
"We are all working really hard and putting
all our concentration on putting in the work
now so it will pay off in May for Pac-10's and
NCAA's," Fiesler said. "Every day we are see
ing technical improvement as well as gaining
speed, so hopefully by our main season we will
be on fire."
"The spring is looking promising if we can
continue the high work ethic and dedication that
has been the basis of our fall," Hoeveler said.
