# Alternative Spring Break offers more programs
## 
### ELYSIA GRUBER 
Due to last year's jump in applications, Stanford's Al
ternative Spring Break Program is increasing from 11 to 13
trips the number of programs it will offer in 2004.
The ASB Program has been able to add trips this year
because it asked for and received an increase in ASSU Spe
cial Fees last year.
Funding for ASB trips comes from Special Fees, The
Stanford Fund, donations by cultural centers / dorms / de
partments and participant fees of $125 per person. Partici
pants who are flying pay for their own airfare, although a
waiver / reduction is available for the fee and the airfare.
"We are committed to not allowing the cost to prevent
someone who wants to have this experience from doing so,"

Olivia said.
Program Coordinator Jessica Olivia said that the ASB
decided to offer more trips this year because of a jump in
participant applications last year. Only 14 students can be
accepted for each trip, two student leaders and 12 partici
pants.
Each ASB program includes three components: a win
ter quarter pre-break academic component, the spring
break trip with a focus of service and learning and a spring
quarter post-break reflection component. The ASB was
founded to provide students with opportunities in direct
service, experiential learning, group discussion and indi
vidual reflection by exposing them to complex social /
cultural issues.
Senior Kate Pedatella led an ASB trip to New York City

last year that focused on providing service to people suffer
ing from AIDS. Her group worked with organizations such
as God's Love We Deliver and Harlem United.
"One of the best parts of being involved with ASB is
meeting people from such diverse backgrounds," Pedatella
said. "Everyone who does ASB brings experiences back to
Stanford, whether it's by starting a new campus group or
just talking with their friends about what they learned and
felt over the course of the week, and how all the preparation
over winter quarter paid off."
Sophomore Stephanie Nguyen is considering applying
to the ASB program titled "Asian American Issues: From
Identity to Action."
"I think that there are a lot of issues that we aren't aware
of in the Stanford Bubble, and Alternative Spring Break is

a good way for students to get first-hand experience in real
life issues that affect our nation," Nguyen said.
This year's offerings include old favorites such as "The
Real World Hawaii," but also new ones such as "Social Jus
tice and the Death Penalty in the South" and "Youth and
the Foster Care System: Troubling Lives, Troubling
Prospects".
Pedatella was happy to hear about ASB's expansion and
said that they should continue to offer more diverse pro
grams.
"ASB offers a very wide selection of trips, but there is
obviously always more to learn. I think it would be invalu
able to offer some international trips, as some other campus
programs do," Pedatella said.
The deadline to apply for an ASB trip is Nov. 16.
