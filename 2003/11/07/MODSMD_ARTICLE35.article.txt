# Korea Peace Day celebrated
## 
### EUGENIE KIM 
Yesterday afternoon, the Korean Studies Program at the Asia/Pacific
Research Center hosted an intimate seminar and discussion about U.S. poli
cy and humanitarian aid toward North Korea.
Karin Lee, the senior associate for the East Asia Policy Education Project
for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, spoke at this seminar
about the varying North Korea policymaking opinions not often heard by the
general public, focusing specifically on humanitarian efforts in the country.
The colloquium was organized by Stanford APARC Research Fellow
Chiho Sawada as part of the nationwide Korea Peace Day advocated by the
Alliance for Scholars Concerned About Korea.
"The Korea Peace Day is trying to target community outreach," said
Sawada. "We want to make people aware of it, and beyond making people
aware of the issues regarding North Korea, we want to show that it is also a
humanitarian problem."
One of the themes that Lee discussed in her talk was the complicated role
of humanitarian issues such as food aid in foreign policy toward North Korea.
While some people believe that food aid should be given to struggling
people no matter what the political situation, others argue that countries
should not help a political adversary in any way, she said.
"On some level, food aid is always politicized," she said.
Lee also showed a seven-minute video, made by Kathi Zellweger of the
non-governmental organization International Cooperation of Caritas Hong
Kong, which gave a rare glimpse into the lives of the North Korean people.
Images of emaciated infants were juxtaposed with those of highly trained
child performers, a combination that elicited both murmurs of dismay and
laughs from the audience.
"For some people, the humanitarian situation in North Korea or the
hunger in North Korea is proof for the fact that there needs to be a regime
change through collapse in North Korea," Lee said.
Lee also mentioned that there are more fundamental questions underly
ing the debate of U.S. policy.
"I would actually raise the questions: Are we prepared for the collapse?
Are we prepared to deal with the humanitarian problem? Are we prepared
to deal with the weapons of mass destruction?" she asked.
Regarding U.S. policy toward the North Korean government, Lee em
phasized the importance of shaping policy with not only American interests
in mind.
"If [the U.S. message] is a message that South Korea would repudiate,
then what business would our government have in introducing it?" she asked.
Lee's final conclusion was the fact that she hoped that people would now
be able to vocalize their own opinions using their understanding of the dif
ferent political perspectives on North Korea.
"Watch what Congress is doing," she said. "And if you don't like it, write

to your representative."
After the talk, audience members expressed their appreciation for being
able to interpret the problem in a different light.
"I thought it was very interesting, especially the explanation of what is
going on on Capitol Hill," said Won-Soo Kim, a visiting scholar at APARC
who is affiliated with the South Korean government.
The Stanford event was a success, according to Sawada.
"I think we fulfilled most of our objectives," he said. "Overall, I'm very
happy with the talk and the question-and-answer session."
