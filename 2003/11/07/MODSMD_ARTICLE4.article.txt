# CRAVEN REDISCOVERS HUNGER
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Back in high school, Michael Craven had everything
planned out. A star outfielder on the La Quinta High
School baseball team, he would play college ball for UCLA
and wear number 42, like his idol, Jackie Robinson.
But when he was accepted to the Farm, "something in
side me told me I needed to go to Stanford," he said, even
though "most of my homeboys, the guys I came up with,
went to UCLA."
Two years later, the spring of his sophomore year at
Stanford, Craven was off the baseball team, his status
on the football team was shaky and his life had never
been worse.
Family problems, disciplinary investigations, academic
struggles, injuries: "Week after week, something went
wrong," he said. "Things I'd never had to deal with before"
Craven admits he didn't react well.
"Probably last spring was the worst quarter ever in my
life," he said. "I stopped going to school. Nothing went
right, and it didn't get better, either."
He was on the verge of giving up on Stanford.
"I didn't think my future was going to be here," he said.
But last Saturday, when UCLA's football team visited
Stanford Stadium, Craven was on the field in Cardinal red
wearing number 42, making his first start of the season at
linebacker. And he wasn't just on the field, he was all over
it, making seven solo tackles and sacking the quarterback
twice to help seal Stanford's 21-14 win.
Now Craven is the reigning Pacific-10 Conference De
fensive Player of the Week.

"It feels right," Craven said of his return to
the starting lineup. "I feel like I belong there."
The coaching staff apparently agrees.
Craven will get the starting nod again in to
morrow's game against Arizona State, play-

ing ahead of Kevin Schimmelman despite
Schimmelman's continued productive play.
To those familiar with the hoopla that
accompanied his arrival at Stanford as a

freshman, the surprise is not that Craven
has earned a starting spot, but that he
struggled so much along the way. In high
school, he won the Watkins Award as
the best African-American high school
football player in the country with-

out even really trying.
"High school football was a
breeze for me," he said. "I didn't
really see myself as a football play
er I wanted to go to college to
play baseball."
Craven was recruited to Stanford
as both a football player and a base-

ball player, but it was his potential on
the gridiron that excited people most. Foot-

ball aficionados thought Stanford had found the
defensive playmaker that would change the team's
complexion.
As a redshirt freshman in 2001, Craven said
he had no major problems adjusting to life at

Stanford, despite the rigor of his
academic program.
He was named a starter at line
backer in his first collegiate game, the
2002 season opener against Boston
College, and his performance
seemed to justify all the hype: six
tackles, one for a loss, and an inter
ception that he returned 33 yards for
a touchdown.
"I went out there at Boston Col
lege and I played a good ganfe, and I
thought, 'Man, this is easy. I can do
this all the time,' " he said.
But school hadn't started yet,
and when it did, Craven said, "I
took some classes I shouldn't have
been taking."
The stress of his academic work
load, coupled with the expectation
that he immediately serve as a leader
and star on the football field, began to
wear on him.
"It was just eating me up mental
ly," he said. "In high school things are
easy, but there's a lot more to learn at
the collegiate level."
With the team sliding into a long
losing streak, Craven's mistakes,
often the result of a lack of concen
tration or mental preparation, frus
trated his coaches. They frustrated
Craven even more.

"They say some of the best
players have the shortest
memory," Craven said.
"My problem was, last
year I would miss a
tackle and I was
hard on myself. I'm
still thinking about
the negative while
we're on to the
next play."
After four starts,
Craven was benched.
But that didn't help his
academic situation.

"There's no professor
here that gives you any
advantage over other stu
dents," he said, despite
the six hours per day
Craven was committing
to the football team.
But Craven survived
the fall, and when the Car
dinal's dreadful 2-9 season
finally ended, he thought
he might have a chance to

start over in spring practice if he fo
cused exclusively on football.
Instead, he pulled his hamstring,
his father underwent surgery, he
faced "the threat of being kicked out
of school" for academic and discipli
nary reasons, and "probably 10 other
things just affected my life that I'll
never bring up again," he said.
Already in the coaches' doghouse,
Craven sank further with each new
transgression.
"The coaches were all over me
if I was late to anything," he said.
"Every week I was up twice or
three times a week at 6 a.m. as
punishment, just running. I
stopped going to school, and I
didn't take it seriously."
Though he considered giving up at
the end of the spring, Craven instead
made a commitment to attend sum-

mer school, and he re
gained some of the

coaches' confi
dence with his
strong grades.

"I was
back on
the

team, and ever since then I've had to
prove myself," he said. "I had to start
from fourth string and work my way
up. They knew I had the ability, but I
just had to show I wanted it.
"It was tough. Instead of just get
ting down on myself, I had to con
stantly motivate myself by remem
bering what I'm here for."
That's just what Craven did, and
he says the experience has made him
a different person.
"The main thing is I learned to han
dle adversity," he said. "I matured."
Though Craven insisted that he
is "still not where I need to be,
mentally or in terms of football,"
he has received more playing time
every game this year, and the
changes in his attitude have made
an impression on Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens.
"We were looking for an
awareness and a maturity,"
Teevens said. "Athletical
ly, he is gifted, but playing
within the system, being
accountable for his area
of responsibility and ex
ecuting the scheme
were important."

And now Craven
knows it will take more
hard work to follow up his
breakout game with repeat
performances.
"Mentally, I'm at a differ
ent spot," he said, contrasting

his approach this week to his
state of mind after the big game last
year against Boston College. "I'm
not going to let anything else get in
my way."
That's what Teevens ex
pects.
"He's playing with a lot of emo
tion, which, coupled with his athleti
cism, allows him to do special
things," Teevens said.
As difficult as his journey at
Stanford has proven to be,
Craven said he has no regrets
about his decision to come
here.
"Some of my friends that
went to UCLA didn't make it,"
he said. Several got expelled be
cause of grades or drugs.
"I feel like if I would have cho
sen to go there I would have been
just another statistic," he said. "In
stead, I came here and learned
life's lessons."
