# CRAVEN REDISCOVERS HUNGER
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Back in high school, Michael Craven had everything
planned out. A star outfielder on the La Quinta High
School baseball team, he would play college ball for UCLA
and wear number 42, like his idol, Jackie Robinson.
But when he was accepted to the Farm, "something in
side me told me I needed to go to Stanford," he said, even
though "most of my homeboys, the guys I came up with,
went to UCLA."
Two years later, the spring of his sophomore year at
Stanford, Craven was off the baseball team, his status
on the football team was shaky and his life had never
been worse.
Family problems, disciplinary investigations, academic
struggles, injuries: "Week after week, something went
wrong," he said. "Things I'd never had to deal with before"
Craven admits he didn't react well.
"Probably last spring was the worst quarter ever in my
life," he said. "I stopped going to school. Nothing went
right, and it didn't get better, either."
He was on the verge of giving up on Stanford.
"I didn't think my future was going to be here," he said.
But last Saturday, when UCLA's football team visited
Stanford Stadium, Craven was on the field in Cardinal red
wearing number 42, making his first start of the season at
linebacker. And he wasn't just on the field, he was all over
it, making seven solo tackles and sacking the quarterback
twice to help seal Stanford's 21-14 win.
Now Craven is the reigning Pacific-10 Conference De
fensive Player of the Week.

"It feels right," Craven said of his return to
the starting lineup. "I feel like I belong there."
The coaching staff apparently agrees.
Craven will get the starting nod again in to
morrow's game against Arizona State, play-

ing ahead of Kevin Schimmelman despite
Schimmelman's continued productive play.
To those familiar with the hoopla that
accompanied his arrival at Stanford as a

freshman, the surprise is not that Craven
has earned a starting spot, but that he
struggled so much along the way. In high
school, he won the Watkins Award as
the best African-American high school
football player in the country with-

out even really trying.
"High school football was a
breeze for me," he said. "I didn't
really see myself as a football play
er I wanted to go to college to
play baseball."
Craven was recruited to Stanford
as both a football player and a base-

ball player, but it was his potential on
the gridiron that excited people most. Foot-

ball aficionados thought Stanford had found the
defensive playmaker that would change the team's
complexion.
As a redshirt freshman in 2001, Craven said
he had no major problems adjusting to life at
