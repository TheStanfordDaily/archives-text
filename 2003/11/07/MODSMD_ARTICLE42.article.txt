Stanford Concert Network brings the snappy-happy vocal stylings of Pop
rocker Jason Mraz to Memorial Auditorium on Monday, November 10, at 7:30 p.m.
The Virginia native, whose hit song "The Remedy" has received much radio
play, has been delivering energetic performances to sold-out crowds
across the country. This night will prove to be no different, as Mraz locks
the sold out house.
