THE SINGING DETECTIVE
Dir. Gordon
2 1/2 stars
Robert Downeyjr. stars as Dan Dark,
a mentally and physically diseased
crime novelist who hallucinates a
lurid world of 1950s nightclubs as
he enters therapy. The film alternates
between the tidily schematic and the
unapologetically brutal, as it follows
a host of lowlife characters, including
a hardboiied detective (also played
by Downey).
By the time we reach the climax of
the movie, the characters from Dark's
past and present have become so
mixed up in his hallucinations, it is im
possible to follow. Anna North

Dir. Richard Curtis
2 1/2 stars
Jam-packed with an all-star cast
(Hugh Grant, Laura Liney, Liam Nee
son), "Love Actually" follows 10 cou
ples on their various romantic jour
neys. While full of witty dialogue and
humorous sequences, the film leaves
a lot of loose ends and never really
resolves anything.
Grant does his part to entertain,
but neither his character nor any other
are developed enough to make the
film really flow. —• Nicole Beckley
