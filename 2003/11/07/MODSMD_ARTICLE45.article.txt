# Poor resolution to 'Revolutions'
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
To call the final chapter of the Wachowski
brothers' increasingly ponderous sci-fi fran
chise a bona fide revolution would be tacky. A
convolution is more like it, though that term
also might be too generous in its suggestion of
actual craft and construction. What this movie
lacks is more than soul; far worse, it has no
willpower to advance the ideas and characteri
zations of the first (and even second) movie as it
churns along to its inevitable resolution. Admit
tedly, many of those ideas were cherry-picked
from existing mythologies to begin with, but the
ingenuity of the original "Matrix" was in its
premise an environment that expertly
tapped into the social Zeitgeist of paranoia and
alienation resulting from an increasingly surre
al world.
This go-around feels far more like an exer
cise in explosions explosions that destroy
any hope of rising above action movie cliches,
for example, or avoiding the crushing weight of
self-important dialogue. We slip into the action
directly where "Reloaded" left off, with Neo in
a coma after somehow stopping a group of Sen
tinels in the real world with a wave of his over
emotive hand. Lying alongside him is Bane, the
infected human form of the Agent Smith virus
who has crippled the entire hovercraft fleet.
The machines themselves are still drilling to
wards the human stronghold of Zion, which is
preparing to put up one last fight using an army
of oversized robot mechs. Humans using ma

chines to fight machines, you ask? Just go with
it.
What it all boils down to is one fantastic
show of sight and sound, but the two elements
rarely come together to elicit any sort of feel
ing other than unexcitable resignation. The
shock and awe campaign the Wachowskis
have decided to wage on their audience is
smothering in too many respects many
times there's simply too much happening on
screen, and much of it CGI "wizardry" that,
though well-done, is seldom breathtaking.
Even worse, the visual splendor Of the first
two movies including those glorious slo-mo
sequences and freeze-frame whip-arounds
is largely missing. The hand-to-hand fight se
quences that remain feel undeveloped, as if
even the Wachowskis realized that their fight
choreography is no longer interesting without
proper context. The full-scale Â£GI war
they've traded it for feels barely one step
above the recent work of one George Lucas,
and for this the Wachowskis should be
ashamed.
But what stings the most in "Revolutions" is
the steep drop-off in both metaphysics and
character development. The interesting entities
introduced in "Reloaded" namely the Ar
chitect, the sleazy French Merovingian and
Persephone make only small cameos and
offer no added explication to Neo's role. Com
pletely excised from the plot are the Albino
twins, and even the Oracle (now played by
Mary Alice, charged with the dubious task of
filling in for the late Gloria Foster) who seems

largely to have run out of compelling bon mots.
Infuriatingly, the word "love" gets bandied
about more than ever as an end-all explanation
for why the machines will never win, and while
it sounds good on paper it will forever feel to me
completely foreign both inside the clinical Ma
trix and outside in the dank and grungy real
world.
"Revolutions" is not a total loss, but by the
time the end finally rolls around it's met with
relief more than revelation.


Moss takes aim ... but "Revolutions" misses
