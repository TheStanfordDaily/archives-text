# Van Sant makes 'Elephant' unforgettable
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
The elephant is a clumsy creature. Feet the
size of pork roasts, he slowly lumbers across the
savannah, trampling smaller animals in his path.
Gus Van Sant's new film, then, belies its title:
This "Elephant" walks on tiptoe.
The film's subject a shooting at a fictional
high school in suburban Oregon is a difficult
one to treat delicately. Remember the hysteria
after Columbine, the weepy television tributes,

the newspaper columns bemoaning the fallen
state of American youth? Every media outlet it
in the country seemed out to pummel its cus
tomers with tragedy.
Van Sant avoids trampling this territory by
letting his material speak for itself. He doesn't

go in for a swelling soundtrack, shocking gun
play, extreme close-ups of fear-stricken faces.
Instead, he seems simply to turn his camera on
and watch.
What he sees are a few ordinary high school
students going about their day. Elias (Elias Mc-
Connell) snaps some pictures in the park on his
way to school. John (John Robinson), whose an
gelic good looks should charm Orlando Bloom
fans, tries to take care of his drunken father. Out
cast Michelle (Kristen Hicks) overhears muffled
taunts as she changes out of her gym clothes.
The camera lingers on these and other char
acters without intruding: it pans across a meet
ing of the gay-straight alliance, or stops on the
football field while the students wander by in
slow-motion. We hear some of their most inti
mate conversations, but there are also words we
don't catch.
The effect is a total destruction of voyeurism.
To watch "Elephant" is not to examine its char
acters under a magnifying glass. It's to walk
among them.
The walk is not always a fascinating one. A frag
mented timeframe, in which several events hap
pen more than once, doesn't serve the pacing as
well as it might. And, watching Elias hang up
negatives in the darkroom, I began to worry I'd
be in there forever.
Yet a sense of doom builds throughout the
film, entirely unencumbered by melodrama. We
feel this when Elias slowly shakes his film in the
developing can, the sound mimicking the ticking
of a clock. And when three girls joke about

"surviving til tomorrow," we know their friend's
bad driving isn't what they should worry about.
Shooters Alex (played by Alex Frost) and
Eric (played by Eric Duelen), when they appear,
are treated in the same light touch as the other
characters. They manage to avoid the post-
Columbine stereotypes of the student killer
either Nazi monster or persecuted victim
partly because of van Sant's delicate handling.
However, much of the credit is due to Frost and
Duelen themselves.
Van Sant has chosen to people his film, not
with professionals, but with actual Oregon high
school students, only a few of whom have acted
before. The choice is a risky one, but it works.
Particularly chilling is the realism of the
scene in which Duelen threatens administrator
Mr. Luce (Matt Malloy), drawing on all the awk
wardness you recognize from tenth grade gym
class.
This chill is perhaps the strongest emotion
the movie evokes. It's not a tragedy in the clas
sic sense, nor is it a bloodbath. Instead, it's what
I imagine the last memories of a ghost would
look like on film sometimes beautiful, some
times mundane, but with an eerie inevitability
throughout that reminds you, ever so gently, of
your own mortality.
If television coverage of Columbine was a
stumbling elephant, this "Elephant" is more like
a mouse. It darts quickly across you, sending a
small but unforgettable shiver down your spine.
And it leaves behind, not a trail of trampled
earth, but a line of tiny footprints on your skin.


Is that a girl? Or the lead singer of Hanson?
