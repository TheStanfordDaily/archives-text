# 'More like CRA-ZSU'
## 
### SARA ROWGHANI 
After a long night of prob
lem sets and cramming for
midterms, nothing makes me
happier than my alarm beeping,
poking, and prodding me awake
at 5 a.m. Its infernal droning is
jarring at best, but it wakes me
up to a morning filled with my
favorite music a morning of
work at KZSU.
As a DJ for 90.1 FM
KZSU, you have access to over

100,000 records with at least 100 new albums coming in every
week. In their expansive music catalogue, one can find almost
any album one can think of (except for the 852s "Time Cap
sule," for some reason... I can't get my fix of "Rock Lobster"
at six in the morning). And many of them down to Jeff
Bridges' "Be Here Soon" (yes, folks, in addition to being "The
Dude," he's also a songbird) have been reviewed by at least
one staff member.
KZSU's 500-watt signal spans the entire Bay, from San Jose
to Berkeley, and its online broadcast reaches a worldwide lis
tening audience. The DJs you hear are not all Stanford stu
dents, making the programming and content of shows more di
verse.
Even if you are happy listening to Evanescence or Jason

Mraz, you'll definitely find something you like on KZSU
that you might not otherwise be exposed to. But most Stan
ford students don't even know what and who is on the air.
For these potential listeners, here's a little glimpse at some
of the many DJs and what you can expect to hear from
them on KZSU.
DJ Alias / Name:
DJ Drew (a.k.a. Andrew Nielsen a.k.a. MC Lars Horris)
Program title and time slot:
"Pandora's Beat Box," Sunday Nights Midnight to 3 a.m.
What you can expect to hear on the show:
Underground hip-hop music you won't hear or see on
MTV.
Favorite DJs / Programs and Why:
"Raymundo ('MHz,' Saturday 6 to 9 p.m.) is pretty awe
some. He's cool because he doesn't just do hip hop, but
that's his focus, and I think he's a good DJ. Kewy Kev
('The Drum,' Sunday 6 to 9 p.m.) is also good 'cause he's
been there a long time ... He does hip-hop as well, and has
been on for about 20 years or so."
Favorite food:
"Macaroni both with or without cheese."
Album currently spinning on his CD player:
The Atmosphere's "Seven's Travels"
DJ Alias/Name:

Your Imaginary Friend (a.k.a. Music Director Bill Cuevas)
Program title and time slot:
"Brownian Motion." Wednesday nights 6 to 9 p.m.
What you can expect to hear on the show:
"Noisy irreverence, new releases, punk to country western,
metal, pop and noise. No new wave, no nu-country. Drive time
comedy and tunes to pick your nose to. Funner than popping
zits."
Favorite D Js / programs and why:
"My favorites on-air right now are 'On the Warpath' with the
Big Chief (Saturday 9 toll p.m.), 'Stirlings Approximation'
with DJ Stirling (Wednesday 9 a.m. to noon.; see below),
'Umami Jazz Program' with Ben (Tuesday 12 to 2 a.m.), 'Bap
tism of Solitude' with Mike (Thursday 5 to 7 p.m.), 'The Rust

Belt' with Pat Blue Ribbon (Sunday 12 to 2 p.m.). Gabe, Kath
leen and Arthur Groom do great shows too when they are on
the air (they are not featured on this quarter's schedule), as do
Riina, Wedge, Johnn, Mr Sparkle, Benji... I think the ones
that I mentioned share eclecticism and/or experimentalism in
their sets, a willingness to play selections that your average per
son would react to with 'You call THAT music?!?' I like to
learn from other DJs; that's why I am a huge fan of KZSU and
college radio in general."
Favorite food:
"My girlfriend. And beer."
Album currently spinning on your CD player:
"Forcefield's 'Lord of the Rings Modulator' is IN my CD play
er. A Bunnybrains record thrown into the audience at a recent
CMJ showcase in NYC is the album currently spinning ON my
record player."
DJ Name:
Stirling
Program title and time slot:
"Stirling's Approximation," Wednesday mornings 9 a.m. to
noon.
What you can expect to hear on the show:
"An approximate mix of experimental electronica, scary hip-

hop, all types of rock and a good dose of everything experi
mental. As the number of songs gets larger the approximation
gets better and better."
Favorite KZSU DJs / Programs and Why:
"I like all KZSU programming (its true!) but I particularly like
the non-genre shows. Maybe it's my small attention span.
Genre shows, however, are greatly appreciated because they
educate me about music I wouldn't learn elsewhere. I like Your
Imaginary Friend's 'Brownian Motion' (see above). The Big
Chief also does a great show Saturday nights ('On the
Warpath,' 9 a.m. to noon.). Mike's show, the 'Baptism of Soli
tude' (Thursday, 5 to 7 p.m.), is always fun too. The Byrd of
Paradise does a blues show that has taught me a thing or two
about the blues ('Blues With a Feelin" Saturday 9 to 11 a.m.).
Favorite food:
"Cheese."

Album currently spinning on your CD Player:
Chris Clark "Empty the Bones of You."
DJ Alias:
Dead Kenny-G's
Program title and time slot:
"The Dollar Bin," Monday mornings 9 a.m. to noon
What you can expect to hear on the program:
"The Dollar Bin" is dedicated to spinning the finest new and
used Jazz, Latin, Soul, Funk, Raregroove, Soundtracks, Hip
hop, and Boogaloo.
Favorite KZSU DJs / programs and why:
"If you like beats and funk you might want to explore 'MHz'
with Raymundo (see above), a hip hop mix show that also fea
tures lots of the original breaks and some other lost and forgot
ten soul gems. If you favor a more down-tempo beat experi
ence, the "Trip Over Zero" program hosted by Benjie (Thurs
day, 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.) is an ideal way to chill out on a Thursday
night. One of our newest DJs, DJ Isis seems to find funky music
from around the world. She's especially well versed in the music
from Brazil, and she can pronounce the titles correctly. Finally,
if you like funk but are also into more adventurous music, Mr.
Sparkle has some crazy good records and the audacity to play
them mixed together with just about every other kind of music.
Favorite food:

"Barbeque."
Album currently spinning on your CD player:
" 'Dis-Jointed: 10 Heavy Duty Sure Shot selections.' This
is a very diverse collection of rare and obscure cuts put to
gether by the cats that run The Groove Merchant record
store in San Francisco.
In addition to the aforementioned DJs and programs,
KZSU broadcasts news and many Stanford sports games.
The Palo Alto City Council Meeting is also broadcast on
Monday evenings. A few of the shows play world music:
On Tuesday and Thursday mornings, DJs Sutha and Ravi
play Indian classical, pop and the latest Bollywood hits on
their shows "Mostly Tamil," and "Garam Chai," respec
tively. DJ Decca plays a most eclectic set of world music,
be it Japanese electronic music or African pop, on her
Tuesday afternoon set, "At the Cafe Bohemian."
While KZSU DJs are free to pursue their preferred
musical tastes, they are also encouraged — and actually
required — to increase their musical knowledge by play
ing tracks off of the A-File, a staff-reviewed music data
base of sorts containing recent releases sent to KZSU from
almost any genre. Beginning DJs are required to play five
A-file tracks per hour, which isn't too much of a chore, as
it's likely that they can find a band or two that piques their
interest and music tastes. The A-File requirements help
motivate KZSU DJs to discover new music to share with
listeners, keeping even the most genre-specific programs
current and exciting.
Other KZSU features which add a little music to the

Stanford mix are their live events. "Wednesday Night Live" is
a weekly program from 9 to 10 p.m. during which live bands
perform on the air at the KZSU studio. Friday CoHo nights
also feature live artists at the Stanford Coffee House; this
week's program — the last program for fall quarter —features
none other than MC Lars Horris / DJ Drew / Andrew Nielsen
as well as the Moonies, DJ Danny Glover & Beaujangles.
My early mornings at KZSU are the best part of my week.
Starting the day with three hours of my favorite music is the
spoonful of sugar that helps the problem-set-sleepless-and
stressful nights go down like buttah. If you'd like to get more in
volved with KZSU, or are just interested in more information

And of course, turn those muthafuckin dials to 90.1 KZSU FM.
Note: If you'd like to listen to Sara on KZSU, tune in
Wednesday mornings from 6 to 9 a.m.
