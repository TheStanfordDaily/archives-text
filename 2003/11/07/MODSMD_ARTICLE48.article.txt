# Strokes burn through hype on 'Room on Fire'
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
We'll never be certain whether hype pre
cedes a phenomenon or lingers after it, but with
The Strokes, the question of the day certainly is:
Do they deserve it? How did this group of hip
sters with impeccably trashy wardrobes and a
list of art-house influences become the van
guards (vain-guards, for cynics) of the garage
rock movement? The answer: Sept. 11 made
these NYC darlings relevant. Hype made them
superstars. The backlash kept them in the news.
And on their new album, "Room On Fire," The
Strokes strike back with an infectious and
drunken sameness, confirming that evolution is
overrated.
Why bother arguing? The Strokes aren't
even waiting for our judgment. They bring the
gavel down with the opening lines "I want to be
forgotten / and I don't want to be reminded"
(on "What Ever Happened") as if to announce:
The only way to beat the crap out of hype is to
not live up to it.
And they don't, kids, they don't. "Room on
Fire," sounds almost exactly like "Is This It,"
except better, largely because it's more human,
less cautious and ablaze with enthusiasm. They
even use handclaps, goddamit something
that neither The Velvet Underground nor Tele
vision would sponsor even on bastard B-sides
to make the first single "12:51" a study in
catchiness. Lead singer Julian Casablancas
often lets his sexy slur degrade into bar room
howling, but he wisely holds back here, drop
ping banalities like "We could go and get for
ties," while the guitars masquerade as soothing

synth-sirens.
With songs like the glitzy-yet-roaring "Rep
tilia," it's obvious that The Strokes are down
playing two instruments: the bass and the
sleaze. I criticize the first decision because I
miss Nikolai Fraiture's bouncy annotations that
made songs like "Is This It" (the title song of
their first album) wistful, but I applaud the sec
ond: sleaze (and I am a huge proponent of
sleaze) is best experienced in small dozes. What
this really means is that the band isn't stroking

by on attitude as it did on the many weak mo
ments on "Is This It."
The other standout song here is "Under
Control," the closest The Strokes have come
to recording a ballad. Guitarists Nick Valen
si and Albert Hammond forgo their vicious
overlapping for a harmonious, even tender,
Smiths' arrangement. The sheer vulnerabili
ty of this song shows that it derives less from
"Is This It" than any other track here, and
hell, I'm all for diluting The Strokes' limited

gene-pool beyond the current Television-
Cars mix.
Towards the end, "The Way It Is," features a
heavily distorted solo and Casablancas' most in
spired stretch of screaming since "New York
City Cops": The way he screams through the
sieve of static, rather than at it is still hugely en
dearing and central to the band's guarded cool
ness.
And so what if they've stolen the riff for
"The End Has No End" from "Sweet Child O'
Mine"? I've said it before and I'll say it again:
Rock 'n' roll is really just well-cultured klepto
mania. Jesus, these kids even steal from them
selves, as is evident on the mediocre "Between
Love and Hate" (a poor cousin to "Soma" de
spite its reggae-ish chorus) and "Automatic
Stop" (a convalescing version of "Barely
Legal"). Clearly, the major problem with The
Strokes is still that their songs bleed into each
other: It takes at least three listens to resolve the
album into its eleven tracks. Three worthwhile
listens.
Hardcore fans will bristle at this point and
argue that it was just this kind of gushing review
that was detrimental to The Strokes in the first
place, the very thing that encouraged others to
dump the kids-gloves in favor of critical-shoves.
I suppose I'm not very ambitious I'm quite
happy being a cog in the hype-machine. What
the band does next is up in the air "Room of
Fire" is fuming with the secrets of evolution and
influences that The Strokes haven't burnt
through yet. But for now, the listening experi
ence is so spontaneous that analysis feels worth
less. Almost as if you're in a drunken stupor. A
very clever, professional stupor.


The Strokes: Don't drop that cigarette, it might just set the "Room on Fire."
