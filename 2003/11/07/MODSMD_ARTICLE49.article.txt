# Garage rock movement: A guide to 'The' Bands
## 
### JULIAN WASS 
These days, it seems like every respectable indie-band from
The Rapture to The Libertines has a title that begins with "The."
A lot of folks are quick to dismiss this onslaught of such titles as
trendy, but "The" bands have always been around and always will
be. After all, bands are basically gangs who use guitars instead of
knives, and gangs are always called The "Pick noun, Pluralize It."
(How's that for a post-ironic band name? Come on, I dare you.)
And no matter how much you hate The Strokes and their
brethren, you have to admit: We are living in a time that is better
(and safer) than the days of Korn vs. Limp Bizkit.
It's now been two years since The Strokes' "Is This It," opened
the floodgates for other "The" bands and with their newest re
lease "Room on Fire" in stores right now, this is an apt time to re
flect on two years of "The" phenomenon.
The Strokes
True conversation.
Random Dude: Hey, you look like the guy from the strokes.
Me: Thanks.
Just to show you how damn famous they are now, this conver
sation happened first with an indie-rocker, second with a frat guy,
third with a hip-hopper in a record store and finally when I was ac
costed by a 30-year-old white B-Boy in a restroom.
The Strokes deserve their fame: Frontman Julian Casablancas
writes excellent pop songs that combine new wave bop with a
punky strut.
Check them out if you like: Television, Velvet Underground,
The Cars.
The White Stripes
Of all the "The" Bands, The White Stripes seem to have
emerged as the group to garner the most stateside critical acclaim.
The duo of Jack and Meg White has achieved a certain level of de
rivative purity; unlike most other "The" bands, The White Stripes
were clever enough to grab their sound from the form of music
that is impossible for any hipster to diss, and that is the blues.
Check them out if you like: The blues, Led Zeppelin, the long
tradition of white people playing the blues. See also: The Black
Keys and the 22-20s for more raw guitar blues.
The Hives
Swedish-rockers The Hives can seem silly at times, but they

redeem themselves by rocking harder than any other "The" band.
Their live shows are fun in a way that most self-absorbed indie
acts usually aren't and I can see their albums sounding pretty
much the same for the next 10 years. But I'm down with it Ju
lian Casablancas and Jack White can write the tunes, and Howlin
Pelle and company can rock.
Check them out if you like: The Stooges, The MCS, getting
sweaty. See also: The Mooney Suzuki for mindless rock that is
best enjoyed live.
The Music
These guys intrigued me at first; their sound is grandiose and
their album cover is neat. When I saw them at Coachella they
came out onstage and the first, second, third (and 4th-10th) lyric
out of singer Rob Harvey's mouth was "Yeah" (to be fair he
switched it up with a little "Yeahaaah!"). Boys and I can say
this because I am older than all the members of The Music
Robert Plant worked damn hard for that "Yeah," and you just
cannot come out on stage with your Chemical Brothers take on
rock music and say "Yeah" and expect to get away with it. At their
best, the Music sound like a band stuck forever in the breakdown
of Led Zeppelin's "Dazed and Confused," which I suppose can be
both good and bad.
Check them out if you like: Chemical Brothers, Rush, Chemi
cal Brothers endlessly remixing Rush, your 15-year-old neighbor
who has one too many effects boxes between his guitar and his
amp.
The Mars Volta
Like The Music, the Mars Volta are more progressive than
the other "The" Bands, and have a vocalist who sounds like the
Geddy Lee from Rush.
While I think they need to find a way to incorporate their dis
parate influences more gracefully, I like how Cedric Bixler-
Zavala's Plant-esque wail comes from his soul rather than from
having seen "The Song Remains the Same" reruns. Their songs
have an emo quality to them which makes sense because most
emo is just prog rock about girls. Except this isn't about girls. I
have no idea what it's about actually.
Check them out if you like: Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd with
Afro-beat and jazz breakdowns, Emo, patience.

The Rapture
The Rapture: Disco-Punk Kings or Mediocre Indie-Rock? So
far, their releases would have you believe both. Tunes like "Out
of the Races and onto the Tracks" and "House of Jealous Lovers"
will always get me excited about the Rapture's next move, but I
find some of their other material lacking in both disco and punk.
Their recent full length "Echoes" is pretty awesome, but not with
out its share of less than thrilling moments.
Check them out if you like: Talking Heads, Blondie, Gang of
Four, using your CD player's skip button. See also: The Yeah
Yeah Yeahs, the Liars, and the Dance Disaster Movement for
more post-punk-disco.
The Libertines
The Libertines are the thank-you note from the English to the
Americans for providing them with so many "The" bands to be
their "next big thing." But this thank-you note may just be better
than the gift we gave.
Carl Barat and Peter Doherty, front-men and songwriters of
The Libertines, follow in the footsteps of Strummer/Jones, Mor
risey/Marr, Difford/Tillbrook, and dare I say, Lennon/McCart
ney in arriving at the perfect songwriting equation. Don't let their
shaggy hair and vintage look make you think that these are just
the British Strokes (The Brokes? I call dibs!).
If you watch them live, you'll scream so much that you might
forget that you weren't there to scream for the Beatles. I know I
did.
Check them out if you like: The Kinks, The Beatles, The Jam,
The Clash, The Smiths, the long great history of British "The"
Bands. See also: The Coral for more loosely psychedelic British
Rock.
The Polyphonic Spree
The Polyphonic Spree sound like what would happen if Phil
Spector had 25 illegitimate children who were all raised in a big,
baby blue house and only allowed to watch "Fantasia." The Spree
are led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of Tripping Daisy, and in
clude various orchestral instrumentalists, an electronics specialist
and a nine-piece chorus. What comes out is a live version of a
sound that previously appeared solely on expensively pro
duced albums. Seeing them live is really fun, especially if it's out
side.
Check then out if you like: The Flaming Lips, Grandaddy, side
two of The Beatles' "Abbey Road."

more post-punk-disco.
The Libertines
The Libertines are the thank-you note from the English to the
Americans for providing them with so many "The" bands to be
their "next big thing." But this thank-you note may just be better
than the gift we gave.
Carl Barat and Peter Doherty, front-men and songwriters of
The Libertines, follow in the footsteps of Strummer/Jones, Mor
risey/Marr, Difford/Tillbrook, and dare I say, Lennon/McCart
ney in arriving at the perfect songwriting equation. Don't let their
shaggy hair and vintage look make you think that these are just
the British Strokes (The Brokes? I call dibs!).
If you watch them live, you'll scream so much that you might
forget that you weren't there to scream for the Beatles. I know I
did.
Check them out if you like: The Kinks, The Beatles, The Jam,
The Clash, The Smiths, the long great history of British "The"
Bands. See also: The Coral for more loosely psychedelic British
Rock.
The Polyphonic Spree
The Polyphonic Spree sound like what would happen if Phil
Spector had 25 illegitimate children who were all raised in a big,
baby blue house and only allowed to watch "Fantasia." The Spree
are led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of Tripping Daisy, and in
clude various orchestral instrumentalists, an electronics specialist
and a nine-piece chorus. What comes out is a live version of a
sound that previously appeared solely on expensively pro
duced albums. Seeing them live is really fun, especially if it's out
side.
Check then out if you like: The Flaming Lips, Grandaddy, side
two of The Beatles' "Abbey Road."
These days, it seems like every respectable indie-band from
The Rapture to The Libertines has a title that begins with "The."
A lot of folks are quick to dismiss this onslaught of such titles as
trendy, but "The" bands have always been around and always will
be. After all, bands are basically gangs who use guitars instead of
knives, and gangs are always called The "Pick noun, Pluralize It."
(How's that for a post-ironic band name? Come on, I dare you.)
And no matter how much you hate The Strokes and their
brethren, you have to admit: We are living in a time that is better
(and safer) than the days of Korn vs. Limp Bizkit.
It's now been two years since The Strokes' "Is This It," opened
the floodgates for other "The" bands and with their newest re
lease "Room on Fire" in stores right now, this is an apt time to re
flect on two years of "The" phenomenon.
The Strokes
True conversation.
Random Dude: Hey, you look like the guy from the strokes.
Me: Thanks.
Just to show you how damn famous they are now, this conver
sation happened first with an indie-rocker, second with a frat guy,
third with a hip-hopper in a record store and finally when I was ac
costed by a 30-year-old white B-Boy in a restroom.
The Strokes deserve their fame: Frontman Julian Casablancas
writes excellent pop songs that combine new wave bop with a
punky strut.
Check them out if you like: Television, Velvet Underground,
The Cars.
The White Stripes
Of all the "The" Bands, The White Stripes seem to have
emerged as the group to garner the most stateside critical acclaim.
The duo of Jack and Meg White has achieved a certain level of de
rivative purity; unlike most other "The" bands, The White Stripes
were clever enough to grab their sound from the form of music
that is impossible for any hipster to diss, and that is the blues.
Check them out if you like: The blues, Led Zeppelin, the long
tradition of white people playing the blues. See also: The Black
Keys and the 22-20s for more raw guitar blues.
The Hives
Swedish-rockers The Hives can seem silly at times, but they

redeem themselves by rocking harder than any other "The" band.
Their live shows are fun in a way that most self-absorbed indie
acts usually aren't and I can see their albums sounding pretty
much the same for the next 10 years. But I'm down with it Ju
lian Casablancas and Jack White can write the tunes, and Howlin
Pelle and company can rock.
Check them out if you like: The Stooges, The MCS, getting
sweaty. See also: The Mooney Suzuki for mindless rock that is
best enjoyed live.
The Music
These guys intrigued me at first; their sound is grandiose and
their album cover is neat. When I saw them at Coachella they
came out onstage and the first, second, third (and 4th-10th) lyric
out of singer Rob Harvey's mouth was "Yeah" (to be fair he
switched it up with a little "Yeahaaah!"). Boys and I can say
this because I am older than all the members of The Music
Robert Plant worked damn hard for that "Yeah," and you just
cannot come out on stage with your Chemical Brothers take on
rock music and say "Yeah" and expect to get away with it. At their
best, the Music sound like a band stuck forever in the breakdown
of Led Zeppelin's "Dazed and Confused," which I suppose can be
both good and bad.
Check them out if you like: Chemical Brothers, Rush, Chemi
cal Brothers endlessly remixing Rush, your 15-year-old neighbor
who has one too many effects boxes between his guitar and his
amp.
The Mars Volta
Like The Music, the Mars Volta are more progressive than
the other "The" Bands, and have a vocalist who sounds like the
Geddy Lee from Rush.
While I think they need to find a way to incorporate their dis
parate influences more gracefully, I like how Cedric Bixler-
Zavala's Plant-esque wail comes from his soul rather than from
having seen "The Song Remains the Same" reruns. Their songs
have an emo quality to them which makes sense because most
emo is just prog rock about girls. Except this isn't about girls. I
have no idea what it's about actually.
Check them out if you like: Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd with
Afro-beat and jazz breakdowns, Emo, patience.

The Rapture
The Rapture: Disco-Punk Kings or Mediocre Indie-Rock? So
far, their releases would have you believe both. Tunes like "Out
of the Races and onto the Tracks" and "House of Jealous Lovers"
will always get me excited about the Rapture's next move, but I
find some of their other material lacking in both disco and punk.
Their recent full length "Echoes" is pretty awesome, but not with
out its share of less than thrilling moments.
Check them out if you like: Talking Heads, Blondie, Gang of
Four, using your CD player's skip button. See also: The Yeah
Yeah Yeahs, the Liars, and the Dance Disaster Movement for
more post-punk-disco.
