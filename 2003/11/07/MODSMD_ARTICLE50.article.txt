# Where there's a Will, there's a way cool 'Elf'
## Intermission interviews Will Ferrell 
### BEATRICE KIM 
Seeing Will Ferrell in person is a little too
normal for me. I am expecting loudness, vul
garity, lots of nudity. Instead, the real life
Will Ferrell is a lot calmer than the "Satur
day Night Live" characters he plays and
well, with clothes on, a lot less fat.
Ferrell stars in the new film "Elf," the
second movie directed by Jon Favreau
("Made"). He plays a human who grows up
believing he is one of Santa's elves. When he
discovers the truth about himself, he begins
his quest to find his real father in New York
City and on the way, changes the people
around him and saves the spirit of Christ
mas.
Aimed at an audience that involves kids
and adults alike, the comedy in "Elf" is
much tamer than what we're used to seeing
Ferrell do. He's not a rambunctious drinker
as his "Frank the Tank" character is in "Old
School" or an anal, prone-to-violence fash
ion designer as his Jacobin Mugatu's charac
ter in "Zoolander." Tamer and yet still with
his signature wildness, Ferrell keeps "Elf"
exciting and hilarious with moments that
only he could pull off: running head on to a
grown man screaming "tickle fight!" or
shouting "I love you, I love you daddy!"
with such conviction and innocence that you
have to wonder if something isn't a little
wrong with his head.
This is the first movie that Ferrell head
lines, and with old-timers such as James
Caan (as his human father) and Bob
Newhart (as his elf father) alongside him, he
proves he has the star power to carry the
show. Even with a familiar plot line, Ferrell
makes the movie a gem with his priceless fa
cial expressions and off-the-script impro
vised acting. He makes his character, an elf
experiencing city life for the first time, be
lievable and real. Elf is definitely Ferrell's
baby and he has his signature written all

over it.
On the day of the interview, along with 15
or so other college reporters, photographers
and someone who looks like a parent, I wait
in a small suite in the Clift Hotel in San Fran
cisco. There is an almost reverent hush as
Will Ferrell walks in, wearing a blue silk
shirt and sporting a gold wedding band. As
he sits down, he announces "Sorry guys, no
tape recorders, I hope that's okay with you."
Disappointed, I begin to put mine away until
I see that the others are laughing. Oh, he's
good.
And then he waits for questions.
What're you wearing for Halloween? Re
ferring to one of his "SNL" characters, Fer
rell answers, "I'll probably go as the Cheer
leaders." He forces a big laugh and just like
that, everyone follows. It doesn't really mat
ter what he says; he's just infectious.
There is a scene in the movie where
Ferrell's character (Buddy) meets a mall

Santa and
gets into a
big fight,
screaming
to the kids
to run away
because the

mall Santa "is a fake." This scene is almost
entirely ad-libbed by Ferrell with key lines
like "you smell like beef and cheese" and
my favorite, "you sit on a throne of lies."
His seven-year run at "SNL" may have
helped him with his spontaneity but the
sense of humor is all his. "The difference
with live TV is that you know right away if
its working or not in front of the audience,

where in film, you just have to trust that
you're funny." Trust me, Will, you're
pretty damn funny.
I raise my hand. Ferrell looks straight at
me with striking (albeit cliche) blue eyes.
"How was the kissing scene [with Zooey

Deschanel]?"
With a glazed look he says "Oh yes."
Laughter ensues. "No but really, it was
good! I was nervous. It had to be such a sin
cere moment; I'm usually making fun of a
moment like that. But I welcomed the chal
lenge. If you have to kiss someone, she's not
too bad."
As for the elf outfit that he had to wear
everyday of the shoot?

"Very comfortable and very relaxing."
He highly recommends it.
And what about his own favorite Christ
mas specials he watched as a kid?
"I loved Jinxy the Christmas Salamander.
It was on, it was on only once and immedi
ately taken off the air for vulgarity. Aside
from that, I was always heart-broken when I
missed Rudolph, the original." Ferrell draws

another fit of laughter. He looks comfort
able being in the center, making people
laugh. This is his element.
As for comedians that have influenced
him, he says "People like Steve Martin and
Bill Murray, Chaka Kahn. She's not a come-

dian but she's just been a big influence." It is
this very reply that makes Will Ferrell a
great comedian.
But is comedy all that's left for Ferrell?
With four more movies on his plate for this
coming year, including working with direc
tor Woody Allen, the answer seems appar
ent. He's trying something a little different:
being serious. "I will always love doing
comedies and that's probably what I'll pre-

dominantly do. The
Woody Allen movie
I'm working on isn't
serious, but it's very
real in tone. I'm
doing another film
with Ed Harris, actu-

ally, called 'Winter Passing' that is a low
budget, independent film that is complete
ly traumatic. But we'll see, we'll see. Maybe
you guys will see it and say 'nope, go back,
go back to comedy' or if people like it, it'll
be an interesting thing to try." No elves in
this one? "Never say never."

Ferrell cites Steve Martin , Bill Murray
and Chaka Kahn as his influences.

wrong with his head.
This is the first movie that Ferrell head
lines, and with old-timers such as James
Caan (as his human father) and Bob
Newhart (as his elf father) alongside him, he
proves he has the star power to carry the
show. Even with a familiar plot line, Ferrell
makes the movie a gem with his priceless fa
cial expressions and off-the-script impro
vised acting. He makes his character, an elf
experiencing city life for the first time, be
lievable and real. Elf is definitely Ferrell's
baby and he has his signature written all

over it.
On the day of the interview, along with 15
or so other college reporters, photographers
and someone who looks like a parent, I wait
in a small suite in the Clift Hotel in San Fran
cisco. There is an almost reverent hush as
Will Ferrell walks in, wearing a blue silk
shirt and sporting a gold wedding band. As
he sits down, he announces "Sorry guys, no
tape recorders, I hope that's okay with you."
Disappointed, I begin to put mine away until
I see that the others are laughing. Oh, he's
good.
And then he waits for questions.
What're you wearing for Halloween? Re
ferring to one of his "SNL" characters, Fer
rell answers, "I'll probably go as the Cheer
leaders." He forces a big laugh and just like
that, everyone follows. It doesn't really mat
ter what he says; he's just infectious.
There is a scene in the movie where
Ferrell's character (Buddy) meets a mall

Santa and
gets into a
big fight,
screaming
to the kids
to run away
because the

mall Santa "is a fake." This scene is almost
entirely ad-libbed by Ferrell with key lines
like "you smell like beef and cheese" and
my favorite, "you sit on a throne of lies."
His seven-year run at "SNL" may have
helped him with his spontaneity but the
sense of humor is all his. "The difference
with live TV is that you know right away if
its working or not in front of the audience,

where in film, you just have to trust that
you're funny." Trust me, Will, you're
pretty damn funny.
I raise my hand. Ferrell looks straight at
me with striking (albeit cliche) blue eyes.
"How was the kissing scene [with Zooey

Deschanel]?"
With a glazed look he says "Oh yes."
Laughter ensues. "No but really, it was
good! I was nervous. It had to be such a sin
cere moment; I'm usually making fun of a
moment like that. But I welcomed the chal
lenge. If you have to kiss someone, she's not
too bad."
As for the elf outfit that he had to wear
everyday of the shoot?

"Very comfortable and very relaxing."
He highly recommends it.
And what about his own favorite Christ
mas specials he watched as a kid?
"I loved Jinxy the Christmas Salamander.
It was on, it was on only once and immedi
ately taken off the air for vulgarity. Aside
from that, I was always heart-broken when I
missed Rudolph, the original." Ferrell draws

another fit of laughter. He looks comfort
able being in the center, making people
laugh. This is his element.
As for comedians that have influenced
him, he says "People like Steve Martin and
Bill Murray, Chaka Kahn. She's not a come-

dian but she's just been a big influence." It is
this very reply that makes Will Ferrell a
great comedian.
But is comedy all that's left for Ferrell?
With four more movies on his plate for this
coming year, including working with direc
tor Woody Allen, the answer seems appar
ent. He's trying something a little different:
being serious. "I will always love doing
comedies and that's probably what I'll pre-

dominantly do. The
Woody Allen movie
I'm working on isn't
serious, but it's very
real in tone. I'm
doing another film
with Ed Harris, actu-

ally, called 'Winter Passing' that is a low
budget, independent film that is complete
ly traumatic. But we'll see, we'll see. Maybe
you guys will see it and say 'nope, go back,
go back to comedy' or if people like it, it'll
be an interesting thing to try." No elves in
this one? "Never say never."

Ferrell cites Steve Martin , Bill Murray
and Chaka Kahn as his influences.

''On live : ' V, you know ...
in film, you have to trust that you're funny."


"Does somebody need a hug?": Will Ferrell gels attacked by a raccoon in the comedy "Elf."

Seeing Will Ferrell in person is a little too
normal for me. I am expecting loudness, vul
garity, lots of nudity. Instead, the real life
Will Ferrell is a lot calmer than the "Satur
day Night Live" characters he plays and
well, with clothes on, a lot less fat.
Ferrell stars in the new film "Elf," the
second movie directed by Jon Favreau
("Made"). He plays a human who grows up
believing he is one of Santa's elves. When he
discovers the truth about himself, he begins
his quest to find his real father in New York
City and on the way, changes the people
around him and saves the spirit of Christ
mas.
Aimed at an audience that involves kids
and adults alike, the comedy in "Elf" is
much tamer than what we're used to seeing
Ferrell do. He's not a rambunctious drinker
as his "Frank the Tank" character is in "Old
School" or an anal, prone-to-violence fash
ion designer as his Jacobin Mugatu's charac
ter in "Zoolander." Tamer and yet still with
his signature wildness, Ferrell keeps "Elf"
exciting and hilarious with moments that
only he could pull off: running head on to a
grown man screaming "tickle fight!" or
shouting "I love you, I love you daddy!"
with such conviction and innocence that you
have to wonder if something isn't a little
wrong with his head.
