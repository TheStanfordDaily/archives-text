# Holiday flick low on 'Elf' esteem
## 
### CHRIS LEE FILM CRITIC 
Can Will Ferrell do no wrong? The tall,
manic "Saturday Night Live" comedian is
easily one of the most successful and hilarious
personalities to break out of that show in
quite some time. Though he has yet to have a
breakthrough movie role of his own, he has
consistently provided supporting humor that
elevates any comedy above the status of Hol
lywood dreck. Who else could anchor "Old
School," or provide such priceless bit roles in
comedies like "Zoolander" or the Austin
Powers series?
"Elf" is billed as Ferrell's first lead role,
and as such it's a bittersweet accomplishment.
While it succeeds in showcasing Ferrell's un
deniable talent, it fails to provide a decent
story for him to hang on to. Ferrell plays
Buddy, an orphan who as a baby got stowed
away in Santa's sleigh one Christmas Eve,
and ended up in the North Pole. There he was
adopted by one of the worker elves and raised
as a normal elf despite his human size. Some
30-odd years later, Buddy has grown into Fer
rell's six-foot plus frame and is something of a
social reject among the elves, always falling
behind on his production quotas for toy as
sembly and proving an overall eyesore with
his gargantuan size.
Director John Favreau (of "Swingers"
fame) seems to play this one-note gag a little
too enthusiastically using camera tricks to
show Ferrell taking up space in an elven class
room or crushing his adopted father's lap gets
old pretty quickly. The entire North Pole set

ting feels off somehow. The pastel backdrops
and washed-out whites only further accentu
ate what appears to be horrid bluescreen
work when the other elves share the frame
with Ferrell.
Luckily for us, Buddy soon grows restless
and decides to look up his real father, a sleazy
New York publisher of children's books
played by the leathery James Caan. The
movie hits its stride as Buddy makes his way
to New York during the Christmas season.
Ferrell plays up the fish out of water / small
town boy in a big city angle, showing Buddy
as a kind-hearted soul keen on spreading an
infectious Christmas spirit to all who meet
him. It's not long before he's accidentally
found his way onto the staff of elves for a de
partment store Santa and meets a semi-dis
gruntled employee with a voice of gold
named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, looking
downright radiant with a Reese Wither
spoon-like makeover).
The shenanigans that unfold are random
and would probably lose their appeal if read
about here before seen, but suffice it to say
that the movie coasts along on Ferrell's inim
itable charm and cheer Buddy himself may
be as complex as a sleigh bell, but Will Ferrell
in an elf costume is more than enough to keep
a smile on your face. The film has also cob
bled together a decent supporting cast:
Caan's office alone is populated with the likes
of Andy Richter and the adorable Amy
Sedaris; who really needs to be in more
movies these days. His wife is played by the
always impressionable Mary Steenburgen.
In the end, however, the film winds up

choosing to cater to a child audience and ties
its plot to another tired quest to save Christ
mas by preserving that all-important belief in
Santa Claus. Favreau plays it entirely too

straight, and what could have been a sly,
winking adult picture will instead be lumped
together with the rest of the mediocre holiday
kid films.
