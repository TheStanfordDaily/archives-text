# Mogwai: Scottish and 'Happy' at the same time
## 
### GREG LARSON 
Mogwai's music has been called "atmospheric" a
label often applied to meandering, moody space-rock.
And yeah, it is, but in Mogwai's world, the atmosphere is
burning with the fire of a thousand suns.
Hailing from the fog-world of Glasgow, Scotland, Mog
wai has made a name for itself in brooding instrumental
music of the slow-growing, crescendo-cracking persua
sion. They play on the same genre-field as Sonic Youth,
My Bloody Valentine or more recently, Godspeed You!
Black Emperor. The 1997 debut album "Young Team" es
tablished their flair for constructing epic songs using multi
layered guitars and percussion. "Happy Songs for Happy
People," their fourth release, hammers home the reputa
tion.
In one sense, this album is classic Mogwai they're as
gloomy as ever, with rumbling songs and ominous vibes.
The title is enormously ironic, as are the track names like
"I Know You Are But What Am I?" and "Moses? I
Amn't." On their Web site you can watch an animated
video for "Hunted by a Freak," in which an obese man
robs a pet store and hurls rabbits, turtles and a few mice off
of a skyscraper. He ties a bird's wings down and drops it;
the cute little thing spirals downward, unable to spread its
wings and fly to safety. Mogwai, apparently, thinks this
kind of stuff is hilarious. Mogwai is that kid in fifth grade
who laughed at the holocaust videos.
But musically speaking, the group has mellowed, albeit

slightly. Gone is the deafening loudness: "Young Team's"
16-minute aural-onslaught "Mogwai Fear Satan" and their
third album "Rock Action"'s "You Don't Know Jesus" are
decidedly more intense. "Happy Songs" is a bit lighter,
airier, focusing more on well-crafted music and subtle mo
ments rater than all-out sound. It's a quality / quantity
thing.
Take "Killing All the Flies": Starting with a soft little
melody, they slowly weave in distorted guitars and fuzzy
feedback. A high-pitched, unintelligible voice drops in,
Sigur Ros-style. Then suddenly the melody is coated with
heavy-pedaled riffs and fierce cymbals, the speed and vol
ume quickens, it reaches a breaking point and the melody
blooms into a heavily-layered soundscape. The power
eventually wanes, the soft melody re-emerges, and the
song peters out with a few flicked notes on a guitar. It's a
wicked little bell curve. Every song is an X-Games version
of an opera. The same can be said for "Hunted by a Freak,"
"Stop Coming to My House" and the standout "Ratts of
the Capital," which is reminiscent of Slint.
So imagine if the earth's atmosphere caught fire: The
stratosphere ignites, the flames smolder slowly up the
thermosphere, everything's glowing and suddenly, infinite
explosions are razing the cosmos. Some may fear this
prospect; you perhaps are trembling at its mention. Mean
while, the crazy blokes of Mogwai are working under Glas
gow rain, channeling it into their music. "Happy Songs for
Happy People," still gloomy but less severe, fuels the
galactic fire as Mogwai strikes another match.


I'm just happy I'm not wearing a kilt.
