# Howie doing, Howie Day?

The CD cover of "Stop All The World" fea
tures Howie Day blurred and with his back

turned away, elu
sive as ever. But as
difficult as he is to
locate and picture
(especially for
young adolescent
girls with a Jason
Mraz fixation), his
music remains re
freshingly accessi
ble and personal

on his sophomore effort "Stop All The World
Now."
Coming two years after his debut album
"Australia," the beauty of the songs on "Stop .
.certainly forces one to stop and listen. This
album draws from his experiences over the last
four years including touring as a solo artist and
opening for other bands. Moreover, he con
fronts the typical uncertainties that people feel
as they go through life, such as aging ("End of
Our Days"), developing trust ("You and a
Promise"), finding ("Collide") and losing true
love ("Trouble in Here").
From the opening track "Brace Yourself,"
Day adopts a highly personal approach similar
to that of "Australia." The difference this time
is that the album reaches for a grander sound, as

is evidenced by the 25-piece orchestra on
"Numbness for Sound," "I'll take you on,"
"Collide" and "She Says." Day also plays the
piano for the first time, adding a solemn feeling

to pieces
like "End
of Our
Days."
"Collide"
and "I'll
take you
on,"
mean
while,

showcase Day's lyrical talent and stand out as
the catchiest tracks on "Stop all the World
Now." The first single "Perfect Time of Day"
(reminiscent of U2's "Beautiful Day") captures
the album's overriding theme of paying equal
attention to new beginnings and endings; Day
may express a determination to "stop all the
world now," but he also wants to endure. In the
end, he emerges hopeful, humorously affirming
in "Sunday Morning Song" that "It's not that
bad / We could have died," and "I'm still
singing."
Despite the urge for anonymity that the
cover suggests, this album inspires you to stick
with Howie Day in his words, to "Follow me
and don't look down/You're alright/Come
with me and forget that you're high / It's al

right," as sung in his closing track "Come Lay
Down."
"Stop All the World Now" may not strike
you with catchy lyrics or instantly set you on
your feet. Rather, it aims to stop you so that you
can feel the momentum of the world and the
energy of the album spin around you.

His music remains re
