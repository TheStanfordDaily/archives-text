# Jaxx go for broke with 'Kish Kash'
## 
### JOHN HOLGATE 
On "Kish Kash," The Basement
Jaxx continue a growing trend in
electronica to use turntables,
synths and jittery little drum ma
chines to write rock songs, replac
ing the guitar, bass, and drum set.
The beautiful swirls of streaming
synths and the thunking beats that
are simultaneously uplifting and
jarring are still there, only now
they support a pop song structure.
All in all, this isn't a record for
ravers who like getting their Ec
static groove on to four to the
floor repetitive beats. But you can
certainly still dance to it.
This album continues in the
vein of 2001's single "Where's
Your Head At?," filled with a
rocking urgency and a catchy cho
rus that can't

help but make
you skitter
around the room.
Gone are the
house beats and
piano frills that
made their first
two albums club
staples. "Kish
Kash" is for the

Basement Jaxx, a transformation
similar to the Prodigy's sudden left
turn from their rave and break
beats origins to the rock and dark

ness of "Fat of the Land."
On "Kish Kash," their third
album, The Basement Jaxx display
a diverse taste in music by produc
ing dance tunes full of soul and
funk. The DJs hit the phones hard,
enlisting vocalists to add spice to
their songs with everything from
sultry singing and growling punk
rawk to flowing raps. What
emerges is a CD full of eclectic
tinges and a reckless abandon to
experiment. Unlike many other
artists who try to produce albums
of genre-blending magnificence,
this record rarely, if ever, feels
forced. In fact, their genre bending
provides some of the best tracks
on the album.
On the title track "Cish Cash"
(yeah, I don't get the spelling dif
ference either) a growling bass

chug screams across the night,
complimented by seminal pun
kette Siouxsie Sioux's vocals.
"Right Here's the Spot" features

the gorgeous singing of Me' Shell
Ndegeocello intertwined with a

steamy hip
hop vibe and a
deliciously
fuzzy bass-line
all mixed to
gether in a
high density
burst of ener
gy. The
thumping
power of the

first half of the CD gives way to a
more tranquil close of near equal
beauty. Me' Shell Ndegeocello is
again featured on the closing track

"Feels Like Home," which pro
vides a tender ending to the
album.
The Basement Jaxx show in
credible talent in diversifying their
signature sound while still creating
a cohesive album they pack so
many instruments into every song
that it's surprising that the product
doesn't degenerate into grating
noise. Their electronic production
styles fit magically with their
plethora of guest vocalists. And
though this isn't the techno that
made their first two albums hits,
this is still music that will get you
up and out of your chair.
