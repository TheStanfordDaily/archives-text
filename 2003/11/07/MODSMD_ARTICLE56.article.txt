# Book doesn't live up to its 'Namesake'
## 
### ANNA NORTH 
This week, Jhumpa Lahiri threw me a dinner party.
(This is a metaphor, but stick with me, people.) I was ex
cited after she'd won the Pulitzer for her short story
collection "The Interpreter of Maladies," her invitation
was one of the hottest in town. My palms were sweating as
I shook hands with her friends from her new novel, "The
Namesake" Ashima and Ashoke Ganguli, their par
ents, their neighbors and of course their son Gogol, the
namesake of the book's title.
By the end, I'd learned a lot about them. Ashima and
Ashoke, I found out, had moved from Calcutta after their
arranged marriage to start a new life in Boston. They soon
had a son, whose name resulted from Ashoke's affinity for
a famous Russian author. He'd later changed it, and
Nikhil attended Yale, got married and divorced, and be
came a partner at a small architecture firm.
As midnight neared, they even got a little drunk and let
me in on some personal dirt. Gogol told me his parents
never assimilated into American society, causing him a
quiet shame. This shame later turned to ambivalence, a
feeling of being part at home and part foreign for which
his unusual name became a symbol.
Gogol, an appellation "neither Indian or American but
of all things Russian," chafed constantly at his sense of
self, "like the scratchy tag of a shirt he [had] been forced
permanently to wear." Coming to terms with this name,
and thus finding his place in the world, he told me, had
been the central challenge of his life.
Even knowing all this, however, was somehow not
enough. Walking home from the party, I didn't feel
Lahiri's friends were my friends. I didn't think I'd be call
ing them up the next week for coffee, telling them my
problems, swapping recipes and advice. Like so many
people you meet at parties, I hadn't really gotten to know
them.
"The Namesake" doesn't lack detail. It's not poorly

plotted or clumsily written. What it's missing is something
more elusive that flash of understanding when an au
thor plunges you into a character's heart.
Gogol's romances, for instance, are puzzlingly flat. I
knew why he was attracted to the cultured Manhattanite
Maxine and to the Indian family friend Moushimi (his par
ents' choice). But I didn't feel the heat in either relation
ship.
The same can be said for Gogol's cultural conundrum.
At one point Lahiri sends the Ganguli family on an eight
month trip to Calcutta. It seems the perfect time to show
us what it's like to be a foreigner in your parents' home,
and how such an experience might effect a boy's maturing
sense of self.
Instead we get eight pages of travelogue, peppered
with rather flaccid observations like, "No other building
he's seen has affected him so powerfully." No wonder
then that for Gogol and his sister, the trip is "quickly shed,
quickly forgotten."
Not that there's no real feeling in "The Namesake."
Lahiri's at her best in the rare moments when she de
scribes women by themselves. For instance, Ashima's ad
justment to living alone when her husband takes a job
elsewhere is heartfelt and affecting. A scene in which she
looks at her aging body in the shower tells us more than
Gogol's entire adolescence. And when we see Moushimi's
dissatisfaction with her marriage through her eyes, we get
to know her better than we ever know Gogol.
What Lahiri needs is a subject with whom she can iden
tify. Gogol is not it, but Ashima and Moushimi come close.
And several characters in "Interpreter" were right on the
mark.
I suspect Lahiri's best friends weren't at this dinner
party, but maybe they'll turn out for the next one. I can't
wait to meet them, to have Lahiri introduce me to their
inner lives in the passionate way I know she can. Don't
take my criticisms too seriously, Jhumpa I don't want
off the guest list yet.
