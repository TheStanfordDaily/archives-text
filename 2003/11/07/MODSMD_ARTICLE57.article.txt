# Ravi Shankar unplugged

### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
There is no greater redundancy in this world than endorsing a legend. Nothing I write can enhance or diminish the stature
of an individual who has consistently stayed a sitar's length ahead of his fellow Indian classical musicians indeed, Ravi
Shankar can give any rock star a complex.
Among his many achievements in the west: He fathered several schools of music, instituted the Beatle's 1-sitar-song-per
album policy, performed cross-legged at Woodstock and produced a bastard child (Nora Jones) who won 5 Grammies. But
you don't need to know any of that if you watch him perform: Virtuosity requires no opening act.
And at MemAud on Oct. 25, it didn't have one: 22-year old Anoushka Shankar was suffering from a hand injury and did
not usher us in with a solo performance as previously planned. Instead, as Dean of Humanities and Sciences Sharon Long
informed us, Anoushka would serve in "an assistant capacity" (read: second fiddle) to her father.
These were all lies. Anoushka, it turned out, was a savage sitar-plucker, constantly taking her father up on the improvi
sational challenges he sent her way and even outdoing him with sitar flourishes on a couple of occasions.
On stage, the two tanpura (a drone instrument) players, two tabla players (Tanmoy Bose and Arup Chattopadhyay) and
Anoushka arrange themselves around Shankar, the instructive nucleus of the evening. The 83-year-old Shankar introduces
each piece with a beatific voice and demeanor that belies his age and the ensemble goes on to play four splendid ragas dur
ing the course of the night. For the uninitiated each raga is based on melody and rhythm (not harmony and modulation,
as in Western classical), with improvisation being a crucial element. Like the first piece-the evening raga "bhopali" which
plays in a 3 / 2 / 2 rhythmic cycle-ragas are often associated with a time of day.
The 25-minute "bhopali" begins with scratchy, plaintive plucking and then plunges into more fluid territory, the crescen
dos coagulating at the most unexpected moments. On the "desh" raga, the crowd gasps at the sitar "solos," played with great
velocity at regular intervals; the Shankars' hands are like hummingbirds.
Then, encouraged by the generous applause, the performers loosen up for "Rangeela Peelu," a semi-classical piece that
Shankar claims will include all "compositions that come to mind." The focus shifts to Bose and Chattopadhyay, who wrench
out excellent tabla solos, book-ended by Shankar's enthusiastic shouts of "wah!" ("great!"). I don't have any experience
with Indian classical music, but this folk composition excites me the most: It seems more of a group effort, and the sitar often
slips into a backing role (Anoushka plays 3 notes over and over at one point) throwing the other instrumental contributions
into sharper relief. Shankar and his ensemble start laughing as the composition morphs in an unexpected way, and it is mo
ments like this that backlight the performance with human warmth.
Thus, by the time Anoushka an established artist in her own right leads her father away from the stage, I've been
shamed into seriously re-examining my own cultural roots (I'm from India but I listen to indie-rock). I no longer need to an
alyze George Harrison's claims that Shankar is "the godfather of world music" or take violinist Yehudi Menuhin on his
word when he says "His genius and humanity can only be compared to that of Mozart's."
Because I know it from experience.
