# Julian, the jazz prodigy
## 
### MOHESI RUSTAGI 
Judge him by his mad chops, his silky smooth de
meanor, his Armani slacks, but please don't judge
him by his age. Jazz guitarist Julian Lage, only 16,
performed with Herbie Hancock and shared an
agent with Carlos Santana at 9.
Two Saturdays ago, I sat in the posh intimacy of
Herbst Theater to hear Julian open for Peter Cin
cotti the second night of the San Francisco Jazz Fes
tival. Skinny and smiling, he entered with his trio to
start with a couple of tasteful standards and a rip
ping solo on an original tango titled accurately to
reflect his musical outlook: easy.
I heard Julian live for the first time last summer
at a jazz program on Stanford campus. Next to the
hardcore teenager jazz-boppers, his presence on
the bandstand was refreshingly relaxed and opti
mistic. At that time, he was headlining for the Stan
ford and San Jose Jazz Festivals.
Even so, he doesn't like to brag I had to read
the S Jazz program to find out that he was the sub
ject of an Academy Award-nominated film, "Jules
at Eight." Although his trio was completed Satur
day night by much older and experienced musi
cians— drummer George Marsh and guitarist
Randy Vincent Julian arranged a program that
showcased all his talents and placed him at the
same level as his mentors.
The two-guitar setup created a warm, intimate
sound, with Vincent's tasteful support throughout
the performance. Marsh soloed on almost all the
numbers, and was featured on his original tune,
"Lucy's Waltz," in 7/8. Among the originals and Ju
lian's arrangements, the trio played standards like
"You and the Night and the Music," and "Gee,
Baby Ain't I Good to You."
Of course, then there was the main act: Peter
"Hottie" Cincotti. Aside from age, you probably
couldn't get a stronger contrast between the two
acts, from sweet to ego. A dashing junior at Co
lumbia, Cincotti enjoys talking about himself,
working out (yes, ladies, check out his website),
and being compared to the sexy croon of Frank
Sinatra. Opening with Miss Brown, he tried every
trick in ten minutes: Introducing a trio of young,
suited men and a saxophonist "just for color," flip
ping his DiCaprio-esqu hair, and even throwing in
THE anecdote (yes, the same one in the program)
about the toy piano his grandmother gave him as a
5-year-old. Don't get me wrong his talent as a pi
anist landed him a gig in the Grammy Band... and
he even has his own CD! But I only caught two of
Cincotti's pieces before leaving to speak with Ju
lian Lage.
Fresh from his set, Julian was still gushing from
the performance rush and answered all my ques
tions enthusiastically. When I asked him what he
was listening to lately, he said he's into Brahms and
Joe Pass, and has enjoyed playing with George
Marsh for close to eight months. When will we hear
him again? Right now he's pretty busy with his cur
rent combo and (rolling his eyes) "starting regular
school next month" after being on tour. But no
worries - he promises to come visit us at Stanford as
soon as he gets his driver's license.
