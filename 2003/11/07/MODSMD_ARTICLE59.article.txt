# A 						matrix of outcasts: Arbus 'Revelations'
## 
### CHRIS MEYER ART CRITIC 
Working in the 1950s and 1960s, Diane Arbus pho
tographed outcasts from mainstream American culture:
dwarfs, transvestites, nudists, strippers, circus perform
ers, blind people, dominatrix prostitutes, the heavily tat
tooed, the mentally retarded and the very old. Her com
plete works, including photographs never seen before in
public, are brought together in SFMOMA's new exhibit,
"Diane Arbus Revelations." But the exhibition, on view
until Feb. 8, seems to reveal more about Arbus than her
subjects.
The artist, whose legend has grown since her 1971 sui
cide, characterized her own photography as a kind of
"contemporary anthropology." "Most people go
through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experi
ence," Arbus once said. "Freaks were born with their
trauma. They've already passed their test in life. They're
aristocrats."
Contrary to what you might expect, Arbus's photos
are not sly or voyeuristic but simple and direct. Most of
her subjects stare straight back at the camera. Arbus's
photos do not judge or violate her subjects' privacy or
dignity. The people she photographed clearly trusted
her.
Through her photographs, Arbus forces us to look at
and consider people that we otherwise would not. If ,
we encountered some of her subjects on the street,
most of us would keep walking, careful not to stare out

of politeness.
Arbus is revealing to us those who have been ignored,
shunned or neglected by society. The question is how
much is she actually revealing? Looking at an Arbus photo is
like walking in a crowded urban street and inadvertently

making eye contact with a
stranger. A moment of
recognition passes be
tween you and the other
person. You make a con
nection. Though these
people are still strangers,

Arbus's gift is to make us feel as though we know them, even
if it's only an illusion.
In fact, the revelations in "Diane Arbus Revelations" are
really about the photographer herself. One of the best fea
tures of the exhibit is the installation of "libraries" in three of
the museum's rooms. These "libraries" include Arbus's own
books, postcards she collected, items she clipped out of
newspapers, letters she wrote, notebooks she scribbled in

and extensive diaries she kept. Thought-provoking quotes
have been extracted from her diaries and put on the muse
um's walls.
The first thing I look at when visiting the living space of
another person for the first time is the books that person

owns. The books
a person has col
lected are usually
more revealing of
his or her inter
ests and values
and Arbus's

books are fascinating, especially when displayed alongside
her photographic oeuvre. Books about Picasso, Delacroix,
El Greco and Van Gogh shed light on her artistic tastes,
while those about Berenice Abbott, Lisette Model and
Walker Evans betray her photographic influences. And
books such as the "Encyclopedia of Abberations" and
Ovid's "Metamorphoses" echo her photographs' penchant
for the bizarre.

Arbus made only a few portraits of celebrities. It's
amusing to see Arbus's portrait of Norman Mailer with
his crotch thrust toward the viewer. Mailer famously
complained, "Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like
giving a hand grenade to a baby." Mailer was half right,
half wrong. Arbus's photos often contain explosive ex
pressive power. But to compare her to "a baby" belies
the intelligence that lies behind her work.
Her most famous image, "Identical Twins, Roselle,
N.J. 1967," shows a pair of twins who are identical in
every way: They wear the same clothes, they stand in the
same position and they have the same haircuts. Yet, if
you look closely, the expression of each twin could not
be more different in emotional tone. The individuality
of the twins shines out of the photograph despite their
apparent similarity.
Although Arbus lived in the era of the civil rights
movement, Vietnam and women's lib, these events are
conspicuously absent from her work. She consciously
shifted documentary photography away from social
commentary to individual lives. But not just any indi
viduals. While the 50s and the 60s saw the rise of the
mass media which has come to dominate American cul
ture (clean and dazzling images of impossibly beautiful
and happy people) Arbus' photographs are decidedly
anti-beautifbl and anti-happy. "The 1938 Debutante of
the Year at Home, Boston, Mass. 1966" encapsulates
Arbus' attitude. The picture shows a heavily wrin
kled elderly woman holding the crown she was
awarded for her beauty 28 years earlier. Her facial

expression registers only fatigue.
Despite all of the intellectually engaging aspects of
Arbus' work, I left the exhibit feeling somewhat disturbed.
Arbus' oeuvre, especially when seen as a whole, depicts pain
and suffering too repeatedly for comfort. Even her images of
children convey misery. "A Child Crying, N.J. 1967" and
"Child Selling Plastic Orchids at Night, N. Y.C. 1963" are two
examples. Rather than celebrating diversity, Arbus's work
sometimes veers into creepiness as it portrays deformity and
oddity. It's no coincidence that Stanley Kubrick deliberately
recreated Arbus' identical twins for several horror scenes in
1980's "The Shining."
Was Arbus full of compassion for her subjects as the reli
gious title of the exhibit implies? That seems to be the argu
ment made by "Diane Arbus Revelations," but I'm not so
sure I buy it: I came away feeling more compassion for the
artist herself, a tortured woman who only chose subjects that
reflected her personal pain and feelings of exclusion. Visit
ing "Diane Arbus Revelations" is a powerful, if slightly un
pleasant, experience.

books, postcards she collected, items she clipped out of
newspapers, letters she wrote, notebooks she scribbled in

and extensive diaries she kept. Thought-provoking quotes
have been extracted from her diaries and put on the muse
um's walls.
The first thing I look at when visiting the living space of
another person for the first time is the books that person

owns. The books
a person has col
lected are usually
more revealing of
his or her inter
ests and values
and Arbus's

books are fascinating, especially when displayed alongside
her photographic oeuvre. Books about Picasso, Delacroix,
El Greco and Van Gogh shed light on her artistic tastes,
while those about Berenice Abbott, Lisette Model and
Walker Evans betray her photographic influences. And
books such as the "Encyclopedia of Abberations" and
Ovid's "Metamorphoses" echo her photographs' penchant
for the bizarre.

Arbus made only a few portraits of celebrities. It's
amusing to see Arbus's portrait of Norman Mailer with
his crotch thrust toward the viewer. Mailer famously
complained, "Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like
giving a hand grenade to a baby." Mailer was half right,
half wrong. Arbus's photos often contain explosive ex
pressive power. But to compare her to "a baby" belies
the intelligence that lies behind her work.
Her most famous image, "Identical Twins, Roselle,
N.J. 1967," shows a pair of twins who are identical in
every way: They wear the same clothes, they stand in the
same position and they have the same haircuts. Yet, if
you look closely, the expression of each twin could not
be more different in emotional tone. The individuality
of the twins shines out of the photograph despite their
apparent similarity.
Although Arbus lived in the era of the civil rights
movement, Vietnam and women's lib, these events are
conspicuously absent from her work. She consciously
shifted documentary photography away from social
commentary to individual lives. But not just any indi
viduals. While the 50s and the 60s saw the rise of the
mass media which has come to dominate American cul
ture (clean and dazzling images of impossibly beautiful
and happy people) Arbus' photographs are decidedly
anti-beautifbl and anti-happy. "The 1938 Debutante of
the Year at Home, Boston, Mass. 1966" encapsulates
Arbus' attitude. The picture shows a heavily wrin
kled elderly woman holding the crown she was
awarded for her beauty 28 years earlier. Her facial

expression registers only fatigue.
Despite all of the intellectually engaging aspects of
Arbus' work, I left the exhibit feeling somewhat disturbed.
Arbus' oeuvre, especially when seen as a whole, depicts pain
and suffering too repeatedly for comfort. Even her images of
children convey misery. "A Child Crying, N.J. 1967" and
"Child Selling Plastic Orchids at Night, N. Y.C. 1963" are two
examples. Rather than celebrating diversity, Arbus's work
sometimes veers into creepiness as it portrays deformity and
oddity. It's no coincidence that Stanley Kubrick deliberately
recreated Arbus' identical twins for several horror scenes in
1980's "The Shining."
Was Arbus full of compassion for her subjects as the reli
gious title of the exhibit implies? That seems to be the argu
ment made by "Diane Arbus Revelations," but I'm not so
sure I buy it: I came away feeling more compassion for the
artist herself, a tortured woman who only chose subjects that
reflected her personal pain and feelings of exclusion. Visit
ing "Diane Arbus Revelations" is a powerful, if slightly un
pleasant, experience.

Arbus* photos are not sly or
voyeuristic, but simple


Waiting for the Arbus: Photographer's 'Revelations' surface at SF MOMA.
Working in the 1950s and 1960s, Diane Arbus pho
tographed outcasts from mainstream American culture:
dwarfs, transvestites, nudists, strippers, circus perform
ers, blind people, dominatrix prostitutes, the heavily tat
tooed, the mentally retarded and the very old. Her com
plete works, including photographs never seen before in
public, are brought together in SFMOMA's new exhibit,
"Diane Arbus Revelations." But the exhibition, on view
until Feb. 8, seems to reveal more about Arbus than her
subjects.
The artist, whose legend has grown since her 1971 sui
cide, characterized her own photography as a kind of
"contemporary anthropology." "Most people go
through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experi
ence," Arbus once said. "Freaks were born with their
trauma. They've already passed their test in life. They're
aristocrats."
Contrary to what you might expect, Arbus's photos
are not sly or voyeuristic but simple and direct. Most of
her subjects stare straight back at the camera. Arbus's
photos do not judge or violate her subjects' privacy or
dignity. The people she photographed clearly trusted
her.
Through her photographs, Arbus forces us to look at
and consider people that we otherwise would not. If ,
we encountered some of her subjects on the street,
most of us would keep walking, careful not to stare out

of politeness.
Arbus is revealing to us those who have been ignored,
shunned or neglected by society. The question is how
much is she actually revealing? Looking at an Arbus photo is
like walking in a crowded urban street and inadvertently

making eye contact with a
stranger. A moment of
recognition passes be
tween you and the other
person. You make a con
nection. Though these
people are still strangers,

Arbus's gift is to make us feel as though we know them, even
if it's only an illusion.
In fact, the revelations in "Diane Arbus Revelations" are
really about the photographer herself. One of the best fea
tures of the exhibit is the installation of "libraries" in three of
the museum's rooms. These "libraries" include Arbus's own
books, postcards she collected, items she clipped out of
newspapers, letters she wrote, notebooks she scribbled in

and extensive diaries she kept. Thought-provoking quotes
