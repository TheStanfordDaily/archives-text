# Tupac gets a re-mixed review for 'Klazzicks'
## 
### CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS 
I bet you're all wondering how is Tupac (a.k.a Machi
avelli, a.k.a Amerikaz Most Wanted a.k.a Don Killuminati)
still releasing records almost seven years after his murder in
1996? If you guessed remixes, you're dead on. Thanks to the
CEO of Death Row Records Suge Night we are treated
to yet another posthumous Tupac record titled the "Nu-Mixx
Klazzics."
The remixes on this album are of a much bouncier, hip-hop
vibe than you may have experienced in Tupac's earlier works.
One of the most notable remixes is that of "Hail Mary," which
has more in common with the beat of an Ashanti song than the
Death Row record label.
This characteristic is evident in nearly all the songs on "Nu-
Mixx Klazzics": Tupac's hard edge beats and sobering tunes
have been turned up-tempo and infused with a bit more oc
tane, creating a club-style sound. The CD starts out with "2 of
Amerikaz Most Wanted" and you are immediately treated to
a great arrangement of retro and hip-hop beats.
The track "How Do You Want It," meanwhile, boasts an
awesome Caribbean beat that makes it poppier than usual as a
flute compliments the repetition of "bitches and hoes" in the
background. You'll also be exposed to a slowed down version

of "All Eyez on Me" that plays off the duo between Tupac and
rapper Syke. Syke sounds as if the singing has been screwed
and chopped, and this only furthers the remix theme of the
label.
The album then takes a turn with the almost techno-like
mix of "Heartz of Men," easily one of the weaker songs on
the album with a static chorus and a conspicuous absence
of memorable hooks.
The song that retains most of the original structure of its
predecessor is "Toss it Up" with a chorus by Jodeci. Jodeci's
smooth melodic tunes balance nearly flawlessly with Tupac's
fast and punctuating lines, making this one of the stand-out
moments on the album.
The last track, "Ambitionz of a Ridah," is much more re
flective than the version fans have grown used to. Here, the
slowed tempo makes Pac sound much more philosophical and
the song serves as a befitting endnote to "Nu-Mixx Klazzics."
In fact, the entire record is entertaining because it presents
a new slant on Tupac's music it would certainly interest
those who found the musical stylings of the original works too
harsh. Be warned, though: The lyrics are gritty as ever and not
for the weak of heart. So if you're already a hardcore Tupac
fan, you'll dig this record. And if you're not, this might just be
the place to start.
