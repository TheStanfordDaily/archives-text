# Rise of the Machines: Sex in the Digital Age

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
When it comes to sex, I won't lie:
There ain't nothing like the real
thing baby, ain't nothing like the
reeeeaaaaal thang. But sometimes,
due to uncontrollable external fac
tors such as distance, unavailability,
social retardation or extreme unat
tractiveness, we must turn to tech
nology for satisfaction. And by tech
nology I don't mean your old pal the
removable showerhead nor am I re
ferring to the wonders of stream-in

video porn. Let us turn our attention
instead to that old standby, phone
sex, and its oft-forgotten cousin,
cyber sex.

Phone sex is usually shared be
tween two people (or more!) who
are, for one reason or another, un
able to get it on in person. Examples
include high school sweethearts on
opposite coasts, couples torn apart
by the demands of their respective
careers, and guys rocking sweat
drenched hand towels around their
necks while picking up girls at all
ages dance clubs and calling them at

4 in the morning just to see "what's
crackalackin."

Aside from that last example, I
respect telephonic fornicators, and
their ability to say things like, "I'm
stroking my ... for you," without
laughing so hard they squirt orange
juice out of their nose. While hot in
theory, phone sex can be somewhat
awkward if you don't know what
you're doing. And guys, if you can't
tell if she's faking it in person, there's
no way in hell you'll be able to dis
tinguish veritable cries of pleasure
complete with back-arching and eye

rolling from rehearsed moans (short,
short, long), belted out on her head
set between the drive from Wells
Fargo to Target. If this sounds alto
gether overwhelming for you,
there's always AIM.
On the "information superhigh
way" you are free to cruise and
choose who you want to get freaky
with. So, I decided to pop my chat
room cherry on the road to cyber
lovin' instead, I was proposi
tioned by a 39-year old, presumably
dyslexic ("hwo odl R U?" "tuch ur
vigaian") HotAFBoy4U who's
time would have been more wisely
spent running in front of cars on the
freeway to collect drug money. His
use of smiley faces was a further
turn off. "I'm storking it [smiley o
face]," "I'm coming! [smiley o face

with squinty eyes], "aight, peace
out [smiley face with cigarette]."
Cyber sex may be sweeping
through the suburbs of America
and making regular appearances on
the Montell Williams Show, but my
experience with it was ultimately
unfulfilling.
Usually, technology makes me
happy. It's my cable, my laptop, my
Playstation, my Schick Quattro
Razor (4 blades! Beat that Mach 3!
Oh no, wait... you can't. Sucker).
But when it comes to sex, I find my
self clinging to good old-fashioned
values. Like other people. And pen
etration. And cuddling, that's a good
one too. But if you do find yourself
hindered by distance, or ugliness, I
guess phone and cyber sex are all
you have. Good luck with that.
