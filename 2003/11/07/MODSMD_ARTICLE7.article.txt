## Cougar fans dying to donate bodies to Washington State U. 
### EVAN CALDWELL DAILY EVERGREEN 
(U-WIRE) PULLMAN, Wash. Some people are just dying to get into
Washington State University.
In fact, David Conley, director of the Human Anatomy Laboratory and
Willed-Body Program at Washington State, has about 200 people from
around the Northwest region who have registered to donate their bodies to
the WSU anatomy lab after they die.
"About 50 percent of donators are Coug fans somehow," he said, refer
ring to the school's Cougar mascot. "They are excited to do it. To them, it's
not morbid."
He said donors want their bodies to be gifts that keep on giving and
they are.
Thirty-seven cadavers are used by 500 to 600 students throughout the
year in two identical human anatomy labs. The labs have most things a nor
mal classroom contains: chairs, tables and white boards. But lab coats, organ
bins and cadavers set this classroom apart from many others.
"A lot of the learning is through show and tell," Conley said. "Students
are encouraged to touch things and ask questions."
Most of the bodies donated are between 60 and 80 years old, and come
from the Northwest region. Some are even husbands and wives, Conley said.
"I receive several requests a week for the paperwork needed to register
their donation to the program," Conley said.
The bodies are cremated after their time at the lab, usually about two to
four years. Afterward, the remains are either returned to the family or
buried at no cost in Seattle.
"A lot of schools are experiencing shortages of donations," Conley said.
"University of Washington is which is odd with all the population base
they have but we have no shortage."
Conley said there are some myths about the program he would like to dis
pel.
"We don't take any unclaimed bodies," he said. "No John Doe types.
Everyone must have already done all the paperwork needed to donate them
selves. All our donors want their bodies to be here, and their families want
to honor their wishes. Their donation is like a financial gift to the university,
only much more unique.
"And we're not allowed to sell body parts," Conley said. "I guarantee to
donors and families that the bodies are treated with respect. This is strictly
an educational experience."
First-year WSU medical student Alisa Baxter said the lab and class help
students get a feel for the complexity of the human body.
"Students can put their hands in the body and around organs," Conley
said. "They are trying to learn the three-dimensional topography of the
human body."
