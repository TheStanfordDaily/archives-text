# Diversity discourages binging

### 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wise. Campuses
that are not racially diverse foster a significant in
crease in student binge drinking, according to a
study appearing in the American Journal of Public
Health's November 2003 issue.
Henry Wechsler, principal investigator of the
study and director of College Alcohol Studies at the
Harvard School of Public Health, said he could not
reveal whether the study was conducted at Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison, but noted it surveyed
alcohol use at 114 predominately white colleges
across the nation and included 52,312 students in its
scope.
The study used data collected since 1993 and
found two major results: Young white men have the
highest binge drinking rates among demographic
groups and binge drinking decreases significantly in
racially diverse environments.
"Diversity offers other models for behavior, for
partying, for recreation," Wechsler explained. "In
coming students who had not been binge drinkers
in high school were less likely to take up binge

drinking if they came onto a more diverse campus.
If they went to a less diverse campus their odds of
binge drinking were greater."
Wisconsin Clinical Professor of Social Work
Beverly Flanigan considers the results of the study
valid and pointed to statistics showing black men
drink less than white men. Flanigan said blacks' re
ligious and historical tradition of drinking alcohol
only at important life events may contribute to their
lower rates of binge drinking.
In addition, the study found young males in par
ticular were the single largest contributors to drink
ing, "to facilitate social interaction with young
women," according to Flanigan.
"Guys, I feel, in their nature, have a history of
excess and, you know, it kind of comes with the
stereotype 'l'm a man, I'm a big strong guy, I can
do whatever'," said Wisconsin Interfraternity
Council Vice President of Risk Management Phil
Jaynes.
The almost homogeneous concentration of
young, white males in fraternities is a significant

reason they have the highest binge drinking rates of
any group on campus, according to Wechsler.
Jaynes disputed these claims, saying they exag
gerated the view of fraternities as centers of drink
ing.
"By just saying you're [in a fraternity] to drink,
that is not there at all. A lot of men that come to col
lege are part of a group ... and I think a fraternity
helps bolster that friendship and inner cama
raderieship," Jaynes said.
He agreed, however, that pack mentality, espe
cially among freshmen men, leads to increased
rates of binge drinking.
Wechsler outlined a number of policies the uni
versity could adopt to help lower these rates, in
cluding curbing the "exclusive concentration of
people in housing arrangements, for example,
freshman dorms."
"They might also want to think about the ad
missions process ... to get a more diverse cam
pus both with respect to age and race," Wech
sler said.
