## Researchers tackle, subdue laptop thief 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
An alert researcher and three bystanders helped the police make an arrest
on Monday that officers hope will stem a recent rash of laptop thefts.
An East Bay man was arrested for stealing multiple laptops from the Varian
Physics building after he was chased down the stairs and out the building before
being stopped by three bystanders who were eating lunch.
"When we got there, they were sitting on him," said Sgt. Rick Tipton of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety. "It was a great job by the citizens over
at Varian."
Therman Smith, 51, was charged with grand theft in the case.
Alexander Maloney, a postdoctoral researcher in physics, left his office on
the fourth floor of Varian for a few minutes around lunchtime. As he came
back, he saw a man walking out of his office with a laptop. Noticing that his lap
top was missing, Maloney took off down the stairs after the suspect.
"There was no way in hell I was going to let him get away with all my re
search," Maloney said.
Maloney ran down four flights of stairs and out the building after the suspect.
Chasing him between Varian and the Main Quad, Maloney yelled, "I can run
faster than you, just drop the laptop."
The suspect dropped the computer and kept running. Maloney, satisfied
with getting his computer back, stopped.
"I really wasn't interested in confronting him," he said.
Tom Cramer, who was eating lunch nearby, noticed the commotion and got
up and blocked the suspect, and the suspect tripped trying to run around him,
according to a coworker of Cramer.
Cramer and his two lunch companions, Lynn Mc√üae and Roland Schemers,
all Information Technology Systems and Services staff members, tackled the
suspect and held him down for minutes until the police came.
"It kind of all happened so fast," Schemers recalled.
The suspect used a variety of techniques to try to get away. First he pleaded
with his captors, and later he insisted that he had a heart condition. Finally, after
pretending to faint for a couple minutes, he began trying to bite the people who
were holding him down.
"He kept saying, 'Just let me up, I'm not going to run away,"' Schemers said.
Three police cars and a fire truck arrived soon, and Stanford police arrested
the suspect.
"These are the kind of stories we like," Tipton said. "When citizens get in
volved, the breadth of what we can do expands."
Tipton acknowledged that not everyone should confront suspicious charac
ters around campus.
"If you see somebody, pick up the phone and call us," he said.
He said that the police hope that this arrest will slow laptop thefts around
campus.
"We haven't been able to tie him to other crimes, but there is a good possi
bility he could have been involved," he said.
Still, Tipton doubted one arrest would make the problem go away. There
were five laptops stolen in the past week.
"As long as people leave laptops as attractive targets, it probably will con
tinue," he said.
Maloney is now taking new steps to make sure he doesn't get such a scare
again.
"I'm backing up my data now," he said.
