I will begin with some specific evidence of links between the ancient Greek
world and the regions of Central Asia, Mongolia and Tibet which date back to
the 7th century BC: evidence which has not been noted before but which has
enormous implications for our understanding of those individuals who
sowed the first seeds of western philosophy and culture. After this introduc
tion I will focus specifically on some of the writings—mosdy in the form of
poetry which have been left behind by certain Greeks, notably Parmenides
and Empedocles. The writings in question preserve the most extraordinary
details of meditation techniques and esoteric practices usually associated
with traditions of shamanism and yoga. I will document and demonstrate the
remarkable process which has led to these ancient Greek texts being repeat
edly mistranslated, altered and distorted by generation after generation of
scholars. Above all, I will emphasize the importance of the fact that we pre
sented for the first time in over two and a half thousand years with the
remains of a sacred, esoteric tradition which lies hidden at the very roots of
our western world. With regard to detail as well as overall subject matter, this
talk will develop and elaborate on issues examined in my recent article
"Empedocles for the New Millennium," Ancient Philosophy, Volume 22.2
(2002), pages 333-413, and in my forthcoming book, called Reality.
Free and open to the public.
