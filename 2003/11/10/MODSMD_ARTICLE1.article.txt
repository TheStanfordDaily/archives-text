# Simpsons writers discuss satire on TV
## 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
Scholarly academics and enthusiastic
fans of "The Simpsons" and "King of the
Hill" filled an auditorium in the Psychology
building Friday afternoon for a discussion
with Paul Lieberstein, Greg Daniels and
John Collier, three veteran writers of the an
imated shows. The event, presented by the
Program in American Studies, was called
"Homer, Hank & the American Dream: So
cial & Political Satire on American Televi
sion."
The discussion was preceded by a series
of short clips from "The Simpsons" that
drew loud bursts of laughter from the audi
ence, including one clip that made fun of
Stanford.
Throughout the discussion, the three
writers peppered their responses with jokes
and showed humorous clips from "King of
the Hill" episodes to illustrate some of their
points.
The discussion quickly developed into a
question-and-answer session on the writers'
approaches to creating new episodes and
storylines.
Collier, a former editor of the Harvard
Lampoon humor magazine, explained that
although satire plays a major role in the
humor of the animated shows, it is not the
writer's main focus when producing a script.
"Satire is almost an added ingredient," he
said. "You really have to tell an emotional
story that people are invested in."
"I don't know how much of the satiric
stuff is conscious," added Daniels, a "King of
the Hill" co-creator. "You could probably
live your life without knowing what 'satiric'
means and create some pretty good satire."
"I think you construct a story, and then
you're really desperate to make it funny,"
Collier joked.
Daniels argued that good television
shows have a voice and that the voice of
"The Simpsons" is satirical, with many dog
mas being criticized.
According to the writers, when "The
Simpsons" first aired, it was the complete op
posite of "The Cosby Show" and "Family
Ties," two of the most popular television
shows of the time. Homer Simpson was a man
who was chasing the American dream, but

wanted "everything without consequences."
Yet the show still focused on something most
Americans could relate to: a home, a family, a
steady job and exercising liberties.
The tone of the first season was "Andy
Griffith's back, and he's pissed," Daniels
quipped.
The writers explained that although suc
cessful animated shows tend to be about fam
ily issues to appeal to younger audiences, they
still have to incorporate several layers of
humor to satisfy different audiences.
"We work very hard at moments to dis

guise jokes," Lieberstein said in response to
an audience member's question about creat
ing situations that children and adults find
humorous for different reasons.
On the other hand, when a situation starts
getting controversial, the writers try to incor
porate it into the message of the show,
Lieberstein said.
He gave the example of a "King of the
Hill" episode about a shooting contest in
which the writers avoided commenting di
rectly on the gun issue and instead focused
on the father-son bonding at the contest.

Many students found the discussion both
entertaining and informative.
"It was interesting to hear about the
thought process when they're trying to write
a new episode," said sophomore Mike
Nguyen. "I was surprised that a lot of the
comedy isn't built into the story from the be
ginning."
Freshman Chris Nguyen said he liked the
"understated wit" of the writers.
"When you think about why the shows
are funny, knowing what the writers were
thinking makes it even funnier," he said.
