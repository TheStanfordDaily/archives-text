# JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK
## Trying to define 'cool' in the UK 
### 
When I first came to Oxford,
I thought I was the coolest
girl to ever walk the
streets of this walled city. I
was sure that it would be just another
stomping ground for me to assert my
coolness, then lord it mercilessly over
the uncool.
"Who is cooler than me? Who?!" I
asked haughtily to no one in particu
lar as I left the airport, knowing that it
wouldn't be long before I attracted a
cult-like following.
But amazingly, over a month has
gone by, and not a single soul has
stopped to admire or even remark
upon my coolness. (Last week, I
thought at last somebody was
bowing before me, but he was just
picking up a dropped pound.)
How can this be? Clearly, I am in
some kind of parallel universe where
what was once considered cool is now
decidedly uncool, myself included.
After I understood this, my mission
was revealed: Find out how to be cool
in England.
The best and easiest way to begin,
I decided, was to observe cool people
in action, and then copy their every
move. I hoped to rub elbows with such
living, breathing paragons of coolness
at an official Oxford College Hal
loween party. Getting to the party was
tedious we had to cross a moat to
get there; well, a small moat, more like
a moatlet but even so, my friends
and I arrived in high spirits, fully span
gled, costumed and ready to dazzle
the Oxford crowd.
Unfortunately, the night got off to a
bad start. I was turned away at the door
because I didn't bring my Bodleian

card. The guard said my student ID was
useless. (Lesson number one: You
need your library card to be cool.) I was
ready to traverse the moat once again
and head back home when a friendly
Oxford student offered to sign me in as
her guest. She also gave me a
Heineken. That was very cool of her.
Once inside, I expected to be

greeted by a wild
scene. But every
one was just stand
ing around, talking,
smoking, drinking
and most people
weren't even wear
ing costumes. I was
completely over
dressed and looked
like I was trying
too hard. I felt like
an insecure kid

coming to a new
school in the middle of the year: That
kid wore Topsiders while the cool kids
sported Birkenstocks. He smelled like
Tiger Balm and used pencils with
chewed-off erasers. That kid was not
cool.

My friend at the college told me
that half the crowd was on a magic
mushroom trip, which explained their
general state of malaise. I imagined
the pre-party scene: all of them eating
their hallucinogens, right out of a Tup
perware! It seemed so communal, so
granola, so mellow so not my style.
I don't have anything against a nat
ural high, I just prefer drugs that com
pel you to vacuum out desk drawers,
sort photographs chronologically,
polish stacks of CDs, neatly comb the
fringe on all the rugs; you know, do

things. Do things besides write intro
spective poetry, at the very least.
Despite the sedate atmosphere,
the party was quite entertaining, if not
exactly fun. I talked to a dizzying
array of people, some of them cooler
and kinder than others, and the spa
cious, beer-drenched dance floor
begged for uncoordinated, spastic ac
tion. By the time the party ended, it
was 2 a.m., and I was spent.
Walking home by moonlight, in my
rumpled schoolgirl costume with pig
tails askew, I looked and felt like a
Halloween leftover, a human party
favor. I wobbled cautiously along a
cobblestone path so deeply rutted it
seemed inhabited by shadows, feeling
a little happy, a lot tired and a little
happy to be so tired. It was the kind of
seamless, reflective ache you feel after
you've stayed at the party too long.

I don't want to leave Oxford feel
ing the same way. So, since then, I've
stopped trying to decipher the English
code of coolness and accepted the sad
fact that I don't have the time or ener
gy to figure it all out. Better to be a
culture vulture, to glean the most I
can, then add these findings my grow
ing arsenal of what's cool.
That way, by the time I get back to
the States, I'll be internationally cool.
It's a pretty big deal, actually, but you
might not notice the difference. I
won't be wielding my coolness around
so brazenly this time after all, I
know what it's like to be uncool.

the pre-party scene: all of them eating
their hallucinogens, right out of a Tup
perware! It seemed so communal, so
granola, so mellow so not my style.
I don't have anything against a nat
ural high, I just prefer drugs that com
pel you to vacuum out desk drawers,
sort photographs chronologically,
polish stacks of CDs, neatly comb the
fringe on all the rugs; you know, do

things. Do things besides write intro
spective poetry, at the very least.
Despite the sedate atmosphere,
the party was quite entertaining, if not
exactly fun. I talked to a dizzying
array of people, some of them cooler
and kinder than others, and the spa
cious, beer-drenched dance floor
begged for uncoordinated, spastic ac
tion. By the time the party ended, it
was 2 a.m., and I was spent.
Walking home by moonlight, in my
rumpled schoolgirl costume with pig
tails askew, I looked and felt like a
Halloween leftover, a human party
favor. I wobbled cautiously along a
cobblestone path so deeply rutted it
seemed inhabited by shadows, feeling
a little happy, a lot tired and a little
happy to be so tired. It was the kind of
seamless, reflective ache you feel after
you've stayed at the party too long.

I don't want to leave Oxford feel
ing the same way. So, since then, I've
stopped trying to decipher the English
code of coolness and accepted the sad
fact that I don't have the time or ener
gy to figure it all out. Better to be a
culture vulture, to glean the most I
can, then add these findings my grow
ing arsenal of what's cool.
That way, by the time I get back to
the States, I'll be internationally cool.
It's a pretty big deal, actually, but you
might not notice the difference. I
won't be wielding my coolness around
so brazenly this time after all, I
know what it's like to be uncool.
