Readers criticize Campustrulh.org ads

Your advertisement of cheering
Palestinians celebrating the tragedy of 9 /
11, juxtaposed alongside "grieving" Is
raelis, is die crudest of propaganda ploys
aimed at demonizing the plight of the suf
fering Palestinians. I wonder how Jewish
groups would react if pictures were
shown of the tragic loss of life of 34 Amer
icans sailors abroad the U.S.S. Liberty on
June 8, 1967 that was deliberately at
tacked by Israeli jet fighters —an indis
putable fact confirmed by survivors. Or
perhaps, a photograph of Rachel Corrie
a U.S. citizen and a member of the In
ternational Solidarity Movement
being deliberately crushed by an Israeli
bulldozer as she attempted to prevent a
house demolition

Suicide attacks are deplorable. In
deed, any attacks on innocent people, be
they Palestinians or Jewish civilians, is in
defensible. The Palestinians were wrong
to express joy at the tragic loss of life on
9/11. But is surely understandable for
Palestinians to express anger and outrage
at the United States blatant partiality to
wards Israel. A staggering 1.6 trillion of
our tax dollars have been given to Israel
over a 30-year period to wage a war of ter
ror against the Palestinians.
The atrocities committed by the Is
raeli government and the Israeli army
are crimes against humanity. Arbitrary
arrests, assassinations, house demoli
tions and torture are the order of the day.
A staggering 11,000 homes have been
demolished with a callous disregard of
human suffering. Children are killed on
their way to school and there have been
many children who have been shot in the
legs to create a climate of terror. Hun
dreds of olive trees have been cut down
to further to prevent the Palestinians
from earning a livelihood, according to a
Nov. 8 KQED report. Soldiers have
opened fire on Palestinian ambulances,
and over 40 women have given birth at
checkpoints. I wonder how the world
would react if photojournalists captured
these horrific incidents and beamed
them into our living rooms? It is no acci
dent that a large number of journalists
have been killed in the line of duty.
Large swaths of land have been seized
by Jewish terrorists to build illegal settle
ments with the approval of the Israeli gov
ernment. From 1993 to the present
years in which Israel claimed to be nego
tiating a peaceful settlement the num
ber of illegal settlers increased to 380,000.
The organization Israeli Peace Now ex
posed the blatant hypocrisy of Prime
Minister Sharon by revealing that 34 new
illegal settlements had been built after
Sharon's election as prime minister. The
settlements violate international law—
U.N. Security Council Resolution 452
states that the settlements have no legal
validity.
Israel has refused to implement 28 UN
resolutions of the Security Council and
scores of General Assembly resolutions
calling Israel to withdraw from the occu
pied Arab lands.

B'Tselem, the Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights (ACRI), has
harshly criticized the Israeli army for
gross human rights violations. They re
cently reported that the Israeli army had
violated 29 of the 30 articles of the Uni
versal Declaration of Human Rights. The
annual report by the Association of Civil
Rights in Israel castigated the official pol
icy of banning inquiries into the deaths of
Palestinians that it "decried" as causing
"unprecedented harm to innocent Pales
tinians and Israelis." The group charges
that civil rights violations arise from the
"hard-heartedness of soldiers" who have
an utter disregard for the dignity and lives
of innocent Palestinians.

Dozens of Palestinians villages will
lose most of their land to make way for
the 25-30 feet high concrete wall that me
anders many miles from the Green Wall
(1967 border). The illegal wall confiscates
wells and greenhouses and will enclose
entire communities, forcing thousands of
Palestinians to be under permanent sub
jugation of the Israeli occupation, or
forced to leave.

I would respectfully urge readers to
study a recent book by the Jewish author
Baruch Kimmerling called "Politicide:
Ariel Sharon's War against the Palestini
ans —Terrorism the last weapon."
I would urge other concerned readers
to voice their outrage on the plight of the
Palestinians and demand that the Bush
administration follow a more even-hand
ed policy. Failure to do so will result in the
tragic loss of lives of more of our Pales
tinian and Jewish brothers, sisters and
children.

I have been closely following the de
bate in The Daily around the controver
sial Campustruth.org advertisements. It
seems that the readers have already dis
cussed every aspect of this issue except for
the one that I believe is the most impor
tant. We can endlessly debate over
whether this ad is truth or propaganda;
whether it produces prejudice or justice;
whether it creates balance or bias. What
we can't deny is that this ad says: "Israelis
and Palestinians are too different to ever
be able to resolve the bloody conflict."
Instead of searching for solutions, the
people who are behind the ad deny that
solutions are possible. Instead of trying to
bring the conflict sides together, they are
willingly widening the gap between them.
It seems that they almost enjoy this gap
and enjoy telling us that the gap is not sim
ply between two different sides, but be
tween a morally superior and a morally

inferior one.
I refuse to enter into a debate about
whether they are right or wrong in this
claim. This has no importance whatsoev
er. What matters is that these people are
willingly or unwillingly working against
the prospect of peace in the Middle East.
I'm sure most of them will say they are
"for peace." They will say that, and then
they will go on doing their best to make
the divisions between the Israelis and the
Palestinians just big enough for the peace
never to become possible.

Hillei provides broad
perspectives on campus

I am writing in response to Lauren
Weinstein's letter to The Daily on Friday
"Beilin's diplomatic role questioned,"
Nov. 7) where she accused Hillel at Stan
ford of only bringing in left-wing speakers
to discuss the conflict in Israel and the
Middle East.

The Jewish community at Stanford is
comprised of people who hold a broad
range of opinions on Israel and the daily
conflict that goes on there. As the former
co-president of the Stanford Israel Al
liance under Hillel, I completely disagree
with Weinstein's statement that, "Hillel
falls short of its 'mission to bring speakers
from a broad spectrum of political views
who will educate the community'" by
bringing in Yossi Beilin.
Last year, Hillel and the Stanford Is
rael Alliance brought a great number of
speakers and events to campus that al
lowed for a wide range of perspectives
from the Jewish community on Israel to
be heard at Stanford. Among others,

Morton Klein, the president of the Zion
ist Organization of America, and Dennis
Prager, nationally syndicated radio talk
show host and author, both considered
two of the most conservative Israel sup
porters, spoke last May during the week
of Israel Independence Day celebrations.
Last year, Hillel also sponsored a lecture
by former Prime Minister of Israel Ehud
Barak, who is viewed as a more moderate
political figure. Furthermore, during Is
raeli Independence Day, the Stanford Is
rael Alliance held an Israel organization
fair with more than 20 Jewish organiza
tions that represented opinions from the
far right to far left, precisely because we
wanted to show Stanford students that
there are varying political views within
the Jewish community.
I applaud Hillel at Stanford for its con
tinued success this year in accomplishing
its mission to represent as many of the
views within the Jewish community re
garding Israel that it can.

I'm writing in response to Lauren We
instein's letter ("Beilin's Diplomatic Role
Questioned," Nov. 7) that criticized Hillel
for bringing speakers that "seem to only
fit a left-wing paradigm."

Hillel supports the right of Israel to exist
as a Jewish democratic state in peace and
security. Within that premise, Hillel's
staff and student groups bring speakers
representing a broad spectrum of views.
Yossi Beilin fits within this spectrum be
cause he is a self-proclaimed Zionist who
believes that a permanent Israeli-Pales
tinian peace settlement is the only way to
ensure that Israel can continue as both a
Jewish and democratic state.

In the past, Hillel's multi-perspective
approach to Israel has led it to sponsor
such varied speakers as Morton Klein
from the Zionist Organization of Ameri
ca (ZOA), David Meir Levi of the Israel
Peace Initiative, former Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Regina Waldman from
Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and
North Africa. Furthermore, last year's
Yom Ha'Atzmaut (Israeli Independence
Day) celebration included representation
from over 20 organizations from all parts
of the pro-Israel political spectrum, from
the ZOA and One Israel Fund to Peace
Now and the Jewish Alliance for Justice
and Peace.

Next week, Hillel is organizing a talk
by Israeli Education Minister Limor Liv
nat from noon to 1:130 p.m. in Bldg. 370,
Room 370. A senior Cabinet member
from the Likud party, Limor Livnat
should provide an alternate to Yossi
Beilin's viewpoint, as he himself acknowl
edged in his speech.
Finally, I want to quickly clarify the
original Yossi Beilin report in Monday's
Daily ("Speech Calls For Dialogue in
Middle East," Nov. 3), which reads
"Sophomore Jonathan Elkin, a member
of the student board of Hillel, said his or
ganization 'hoped the talk will present a
message of hope for the quagmire we are
in now.'"

I helped co-organize the Yossi Beilin
event along with Nathan Kurz, the Israel
education and culture chair of the Jewish
Leadership Council (the student board of
Hillel). I'm not actually on the JLC board,
and I did not intend for my personal com
ments about the significance of Yossi
Beilin's message to represent the political
opinion of the JLC or Hillel as a whole.
I'd love to talk to any interested stu
dents at future programs addressing the
Middle East, as part of greater campus
awareness and discussion.
