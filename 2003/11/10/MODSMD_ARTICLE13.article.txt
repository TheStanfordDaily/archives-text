## Seeking the Valley's conscience 
### 
At first I thought the oranges had
suffered an especially vigorous
form of voodoo, each having
been pricked many times by
the toy-like used syringes that littered the
table. Yet it was not ritualistic artifacts on
display on Oct. 15 at the Tech Museum of
Innovation in San Jose, but a new technol
ogy to improve rates of vaccination and
immunization in poor countries.
Earlier in the evening, the Program for
Appropriate Technologies in Health, a
Seattle nonprofit, won a Tech Museum
Award for developing the Uniject syringe.
The scene on the table was evidence that
many of those in attendance had accepted
the invitation of Dr. Christopher Elias to
try the device for themselves.
"The Uniject device is an example of
how a simple technology can save lives
every day," said Elias, PATH president,
accepting the $50,000 award.
The prize was presented at a black tie
ceremony celebrating technology benefit
ing humanity. I've long grumbled that the
Silicon Valley is long on people who get
paid too much to sell technology that
means too little to the world. But the
awards gave me occasion to check my cyn
icism on both counts.
You never will see PATH'S technolo
gy developed in part by Stanford alum
nus Carib Nelson, Qass of 79 on one
of the breathless billboards between here
and San Francisco. This is because
PATH'S technology is for customers far
away from our extraordinarily wealthy
comer of the world.
The syringes are impossible to reuse, a
feature that prevents the spread of disease
associated with reuse of disposable sy
ringes in developing countries. Up to 50

percent of injections in these countries are
not sterile. The devices also come pre
filled, which helps to prevent waste.
At least for one night it was nice to
know that the Silicon Valley is capable of
looking beyond share price as measure of
success.
"The Uniject device has gone all the
way from the drawing board to realization
and has helped literally millions of peo
ple," said Craig Stephens, one of the
judges for the awards. Stephens is a Santa
Gara University biology professor cur
rently on sabbatical in Stanford's Bio-X
program at the new Qark Center.
Michael J. Free, vice president and se
nior advisor for technologies for PATH,
said the syringe is in the "early adoption"
stage around die world. "About 23 million
Uniject systems were sold through 2002,"
he said.
It is an impressive figure, but the
need for vaccination and immunization
in poor countries remains great. Data
from the World Health Organization
show that in sub-Saharan Africa and
much of Asia most people are infected
with the Hepatitis B virus. Up to 10 per
cent of this population becomes chroni
cally infected, a condition that leads first
to cirrhosis of the fiver or fiver cancer,
then to death.
Tetanus, virtually eliminated in the
United States, remains a problem in the
developing world as well. Babies often are
infected through an unhealed umbilical
stump, especially when the stump is cut
with an unclean instrument. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre
vention, tetanus causes an estimated
270,000 deaths each year among children
in developing countries.

"After all is said and done, that's where
most of the population is and where the
need is the greatest," Stephens said of the
countries where Uniject might eventually
be used.
Hobnobbing in my rented tux with
tech elite, that need seemed far away, and
perhaps my only gripe of the evening was
the relatively paltry amounts of the cash
awards given to the winners.
PATH is making its difference with
the help of a philanthropist who is not in
the practice of giving paltry awards and
who is often loathed by local technology
titans. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foun
dation is one of the organization's largest
donors and has contributed tens of mil
lions of dollars to the organization over
the last few years.
The return on the investment speaks
for itself.
All 5 million children bom in Indonesia
this year will receive home vaccinations for
Hepatitis B using the device. Uniject sy
ringes also are being used to deliver 9 mil
lion doses of a drug that prevents tetanus to
women in Mali, Afghanistan, Ghana, So
malia and Sudan.
Perhaps next year, some of our own
South Bay billionaires there are several
despite the NASDAQ's fall will chip in
to make the awards than more a symbolic
nod to the bottom of the pyramid.
But even if they don't, look for me
there. The awards are a reminder that the
promise technology to improve things, at
least on some nights, can be more than so
much voodoo.
