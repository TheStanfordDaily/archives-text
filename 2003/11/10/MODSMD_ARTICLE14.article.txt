## Father, son bond over beer pong 
### 
One of the greatest things about
sports is its connection to the
past. You see the past every
where — in the throwback jer
seys that got Leßron James into so much
trouble, in the ESPN "Sportscentury" spe
cials, in the flashback highlights that domi
nate NFL broadcasts. Granted, sometimes
the past can hurt just ask a Red Sox fan
about 1975, '7B, 'B6, '9O, '95, —do I need
to keep going? '99, or 2003.

But the other side of that coin is what
keeps fans in the game and keeps the faith
alive the remembrance of the past glory
days. (Cue the Bruce Springstreen track
now.) Respect for the past is what fills Sol
dier Field as the Bears go down in defeat,
it's what keeps the crowds coming to Lam
beau Field in weather that could kill a horse.
It's what makes the Cubs lovable and the

Celtics admired. It's
what gives the Red i
Wings and Canadians \
their mystique.
More recently, it's \
what got my dad and I |
on the same beer pong
table Saturday night.
Miss the connection?
Don't worry, it was *
a bit of a jump.

You see, at halftime of Stanford's foot
ball game against Arizona State on Satur
day (a thrilling victory, I might add, which
makes a bowl game now a distinct possibil
ity for a team that two weeks ago seemed to
be stranded in rather dire straits), there was
a father-son duo, the McColls, inducted
into the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame.
The first father and son to be so honored.
It was my own father who told me about
this, as he, my mom and my sister had been
at the game which I had to miss in order
to pick up a keg and various other items to
prepare for a party I was throwing that
night.
But it got me to thinking, as my own dad
was in town, about father-son combina
tions in sports. The most direct link anyone
can find to sports is in their past the
memories of backyard whiffle ball, playing
catch, whatever. Don't worry, I'm not
going to get all nostalgic on you here. But
the fact remains a lot of people learn
sports from their parents.
The only difference, then, is that not all
father-son duos are on-par with the Mc-
Colls. Every game of backyard catcji
doesn't blossom into Bobby and Barry
Bonds, arguably the best father-son com
binations in the history of professional
sports. It isn't everyday that you get a
family quarterback dynasty from Archie
to Peyton to Eli Manning.
Now, I'm not arguing that all of Pey
ton's skill is derived from his father ge
netics can only do so much. Nor am I trying
to say that Barry wouldn't have a mystique
all his own were it not for his father after
all, if you knock 600 home runs in your ca
reer, you generate a certain aura. But I
would say that in both cases and for the
McColls, though I don't really know any
thing about them it does magnify the ef
fect. This continuation of past glory into
the present makes for a good story (which
is important for me), and good stories
sometimes make for good sports.
Still wondering how the beer pong
comes in?

So I missed the football game getting
ready for a party at my house. That night
I went out for dinner with my folks and
they came back to the house for the be
ginning of the party. We got back to the
house to find a beer pong game in full
swing in the garage, and after a few min
utes one of my housemates (Steve "But
terbean" Prefontaine, for those of you
readers who remember the "Beer Mile"
column) offers my dad a "celebrity shot"
for one of his turns.
My father, 49 years young, steps up to
the table and promptly drains his first shot.
The crowd went wild enough so to
convince him to team up with me and take
on the winners in the next game.
As we prepared for the match he told
me stories of his old college beer pong
teammate, a man who used to clean up
after parties at a prestigious east coast uni
versity by lining beer cans up in his fourth
floor window and shooting them into the
dumpster below with his hockey stick.
Too bad my house only has two floors.
As we took to the table as team "Lex-
Mundi" (The Law of the World), expecta
tions were rather high. Leßron-like hype had
been building as news of the generational
juggernaut circulated through the party.
Did we meet the expectations?
I'm ashamed you even asked.
Bring on Bobby and Barry, the Man
nings and the McColls. We'll sink 'em, you
drink 'em.

Don't worry, it was *
a bit of a jump.

You see, at halftime of Stanford's foot
ball game against Arizona State on Satur
day (a thrilling victory, I might add, which
makes a bowl game now a distinct possibil
ity for a team that two weeks ago seemed to
be stranded in rather dire straits), there was
a father-son duo, the McColls, inducted
into the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame.
The first father and son to be so honored.
It was my own father who told me about
this, as he, my mom and my sister had been
at the game which I had to miss in order
to pick up a keg and various other items to
prepare for a party I was throwing that
night.
But it got me to thinking, as my own dad
was in town, about father-son combina
tions in sports. The most direct link anyone
can find to sports is in their past the
memories of backyard whiffle ball, playing
catch, whatever. Don't worry, I'm not
going to get all nostalgic on you here. But
the fact remains a lot of people learn
sports from their parents.
The only difference, then, is that not all
father-son duos are on-par with the Mc-
Colls. Every game of backyard catcji
doesn't blossom into Bobby and Barry
Bonds, arguably the best father-son com
binations in the history of professional
sports. It isn't everyday that you get a
family quarterback dynasty from Archie
to Peyton to Eli Manning.
Now, I'm not arguing that all of Pey
ton's skill is derived from his father ge
netics can only do so much. Nor am I trying
to say that Barry wouldn't have a mystique
all his own were it not for his father after
all, if you knock 600 home runs in your ca
reer, you generate a certain aura. But I
would say that in both cases and for the
McColls, though I don't really know any
thing about them it does magnify the ef
fect. This continuation of past glory into
the present makes for a good story (which
is important for me), and good stories
sometimes make for good sports.
Still wondering how the beer pong
comes in?

So I missed the football game getting
ready for a party at my house. That night
I went out for dinner with my folks and
they came back to the house for the be
ginning of the party. We got back to the
house to find a beer pong game in full
swing in the garage, and after a few min
utes one of my housemates (Steve "But
terbean" Prefontaine, for those of you
readers who remember the "Beer Mile"
column) offers my dad a "celebrity shot"
for one of his turns.
My father, 49 years young, steps up to
the table and promptly drains his first shot.
The crowd went wild enough so to
convince him to team up with me and take
on the winners in the next game.
As we prepared for the match he told
me stories of his old college beer pong
teammate, a man who used to clean up
after parties at a prestigious east coast uni
versity by lining beer cans up in his fourth
floor window and shooting them into the
dumpster below with his hockey stick.
Too bad my house only has two floors.
As we took to the table as team "Lex-
Mundi" (The Law of the World), expecta
tions were rather high. Leßron-like hype had
been building as news of the generational
juggernaut circulated through the party.
Did we meet the expectations?
I'm ashamed you even asked.
Bring on Bobby and Barry, the Man
nings and the McColls. We'll sink 'em, you
drink 'em.
