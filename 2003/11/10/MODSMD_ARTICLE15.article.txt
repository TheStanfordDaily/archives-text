J.R. Lemon was going through his usual pre
game routine, when 20 minutes before kickoff,
he got the news. Starting tailback Kenneth Tolon
had an injured right thumb and Lemon was
going to be his replacement.
"I was caught a little off-guard." Lemon ad
mitted.

But the junior running back took full advan
tage of his opportunity and rushed for a career

Stanford's offense, maligned for its poor exe

week," he added.
The star of the afternoon, though, was
Lemon. The 6-foot-l, 225-pound back had been
getting teased by teammates for putting on too
many pounds after shoulder surgery and they
jokingly suggested he should move to fullback.
But he didn't look much like a blocking back
in this game.
"I don't know how he made some of the cuts
he did out there," said free safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe. "He proved to us why he's still a tail
back."
Lemon had been used sparingly since opening
the season with a 103-yard effort against San Jose
State, but he slid into the feature back role with
ease against the Sun Devils (4-6,1-5).
"The key to our season has been our ability to
switch and substitute when necessary," he said.
Lemon's output was the most by a Cardinal
runner since Anthony Bookman amassed 150
yards on the ground in 1997.
Stanford's success on the ground led to its
aerial game clicking for the first time in eons.
Lewis completed 18-of-34 passes for 279 yards
his best effort since throwing for 390 yards
against Cal in 2001 and two touchdowns. He
seemed more comfortable moving around in the
pocket and throwing deep than he had all season.

Stanford's offense had a day two
years in the making when it pro
duced five touchdowns and a field
goal in a 38-27 victory over Arizona
State (4-6, 1-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) on Saturday.
The Cardinal didn't just get what
it needed to win, though, as it did
last week, when it stretched just 206
yards of total offense into a 21-14
victory over UCLA. Stanford (4-4,
2-4 Pacific 10 Conference) racked
up 467 yards of offense, including
188 on the ground both season
highs.
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis
completed 18-of-34 passes for 279
yards the second-highest total of
his career and the best mark for a
Cardinal quarterback since 2001
and sophomore tailback J.R.
Lemon rushed 34 times for 151
yards, both career highs. Lemon's
yardage output was the best by a
Stanford back since Mike Mitchell
ran for 179 yards in 1994.
In fact, Stanford's point total,
total offense and passing yardage
were all the best outputs the Cardi

nal has ever achieved in conference
play under second-year head coach
Buddy Teevens.
"When you execute, those things
can happen," Teevens said. "Was it
a breakout game? Certainly numer
ically it was nice, but we still have
work to do."
Stanford's offense displayed an
increasingly wide-open approach
for the second week in a row, as
Lewis repeatedly stretched the
field, completing passes of 46, 33
and 33 yards. He had 11 passes for
10 yards or more, including four
during Stanford's 86-yard drive to
end the first half, which put the
Cardinal on top, 28-7.
That 11-play drive was Stan
ford's longest of the year eclips
ing the seven-play, 83-yard drive
the Cardinal had executed in the
first quarter.
Lemon and Lewis both aided
each other's cause with their strong
performances.
"[The passing game] helped out,
no doubt," Lemon said. "When we
would fake pass . . . [the defense
was] already way out, so there were

Senior Chris Lewis looks for a receiver in the Cardinal's 38-27 home win over Arizona State on Saturday. The quarterback threw for 279 yards and completed two touchdown pass
es to lift Stanford to a victory and an even record on the season.
The
senior
quarter
back,
making

his third consecutive start since replacing redshirt freshman
Trent Edwards, attributed his success to the growth of his ex
tremely green offensive line.
"Our line played the best it has all season," he said. "You
can tell we can do a lot of things when those guys are playing
well."
The Cardinal had been outscored 51-13 in the first quarter
entering Saturday's game, but it got off to a fast start against
Arizona State (4-6,1-5).
On the Sun Devils' third play of its opening drive, quarter
back Andrew Walter threw a pass over the middle that de
flected off linebacker Brian Gaffney's back and into the arms
of strong safety Trevor Hooper his second interception in
as many games.
On the next play from the Arizona State 11 yard-line,
Lewis faked a handoff and then executed a naked bootleg

weakside perfectly, juking past two Sun Devil defenders and
prancing into the end zone.
Stanford also scored on its next possession when Lemon
picked up his first touchdown of the afternoon on a 1-yard
run.
The Cardinal seized that early momentum, led 28-7 at half
time and never even peeped over its shoulder in producing its
most convincing conference win yet under Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens.
"Once we get our feet under us, we have a stable platform
to operate on," Amon Gordon said. "Things start to fall into
place and you get a rhythm and catch momentum."
Meanwhile, Arizona State hardly resembled the team that
blew out the Cardinal 65-24 last year in Tempe, Ariz. The Sun
Devils turned the ball over three times, had 12 penalties for 98
yards and converted only 3-of-14 third-downs.
Walter finished the game 23-of-51 for 357 yards and four
touchdowns somewhat similar numbers to last year's 414
yards and five touchdowns. But most of his stats came when
the contest was out of hand in the third and fourth quarters,
and not in running up the score against Stanford.

"He scorched us last year," Gordon said. "It stuck in our
minds."
So what was the difference in neutralizing the ever-dan
gerous Arizona State quarterback this time around?
"We were getting in his face," Atogwe said. "He was a lit
tle off-balance so his throws weren't as precise.
"Once he gets in a rhythm, he's off through the gates. But
early in the game, we didn't let him get in that rhythm. We
knocked some balls down, we hit him a couple of times and he
couldn't find his niche."
Stanford has now not only erased the sting of its previous
four-game losing streak but also started a winning streak of its
own. And if it wins two of its next three games, a bowl might
be in the cards.
"It's been a while since we've been to one of those things,"
Gordon said. "But for now, we have to focus on our next op
ponent."
For now, the Cardinal can take a few minutes to sit back,
smile and absorb the good times. Winning has been hard to
come by in the last two years, but not in the last two weeks.
"We are starting to shine," Lewis said.

six people in the box. Any good running back
should be able to run on that."
Lemon broke off a 32-yard run early in the
second quarter Stanford's longest rush of
the year and repeatedly turned small holes
into decent gains, dodging, weaving and
bulling his way up the field. He often didn't
run at full speed, waiting for openings in the
defense to materialize.
"A lot of times teams over-run you or over
play you," Lemon explained. "So you don't
really want to run as fast as you can. You want
to attack it, but you want to be under control.
So that's a lot of what I was doing, trying to
find the little seams and pick up positive
yards."
Meanwhile, in addition to Lemon's short
work and Lewis' long completions to fresh
man Evan Moore and senior Luke Powell,
Stanford exploited intermediate, crossing
routes all day long. Junior tight end Alex
Smith led the team with six catches, including
an 11-yard touchdown, and he and the rest of
the Cardinal receiving corps had consistent
success by running routes that crossed from
one side of the field to the other.
"They were playing a lot of man, and when
they're playing man, the crossing routes are
ideal," Smith said. "We were able to keep at
tacking them and they really didn't adjust
until later, when they started going to a little
zone."
Lewis credited careful execution for the of
fense's success.
"We do really well when we play within

ourselves," he said. "We had a great game
plan this week. We went out there and execut
ed it and we saw the results."
The offense was aided for the second
straight week by the opportunistic Cardinal
defense, which forced three turnovers. On just
the third play of the game, freshman strong
safety Trevor Hooper caught a deflected ball
for an interception, giving the Cardinal the
ball on Arizona State's 11-yard line.
"We feel like our job as a defense is to go
out there and get the ball back for our offense
as soon as possible, no matter where the ball
is," said junior free safety Oshiomogho Atog
we. "We get them the ball so they can score."
Stanford, which struggled in the red zone
earlier in the season, needed just one play to
hit paydirt. Lewis' 11-yard touchdown run on
a naked bootleg put the Cardinal ahead for
good just one minute into the contest.
On its next two red-zone possessions, Stan
ford scored on its first play, on runs of two and
10 yards by Lemon. On its third score, Lewis
found Smith from 11 yards out for the touch
down. On its last red-zone possession, in the
third quarter, the Cardinal stalled but sopho
more Michael Sgroi booted a 22-yard field
goal.
Two weeks ago, Stanford was mired in a
four-game losing streak and had just lost 35-0
to Oregon. Now, the team finds itself with an
even 4-4 record and the possibility of heading
to a bowl game should it finish the year strong
ly-
It's been a long time coming for the Cardi
nal, which has already doubled last season's
win total, but the players are looking toward
the future.
"We're young; we had to develop," Lewis
said. "I feel like we're starting to shine now."
