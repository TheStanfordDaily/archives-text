# Football wins two straight

J.R. Lemon was going through his usual pre
game routine, when 20 minutes before kickoff,
he got the news. Starting tailback Kenneth Tolon
had an injured right thumb and Lemon was
going to be his replacement.
"I was caught a little off-guard." Lemon ad
mitted.

But the junior running back took full advan
tage of his opportunity and rushed for a career
high 151 yards on 34 carries and two touchdowns

Stanford's offense, maligned for its poor exe
cution and even poorer numbers, racked up a
season-high 467 yards of total offense, converted
over 50 percent of its third downs and scored five
of the six times it entered the red zone includ

week," he added.
The star of the afternoon, though, was
Lemon. The 6-foot-l, 225-pound back had been
getting teased by teammates for putting on too
many pounds after shoulder surgery and they
jokingly suggested he should move to fullback.
But he didn't look much like a blocking back
in this game.
"I don't know how he made some of the cuts
he did out there," said free safety Oshiomogho
Atogwe. "He proved to us why he's still a tail
back."
Lemon had been used sparingly since opening
the season with a 103-yard effort against San Jose
State, but he slid into the feature back role with
ease against the Sun Devils (4-6,1-5).
"The key to our season has been our ability to
switch and substitute when necessary," he said.
Lemon's output was the most by a Cardinal
runner since Anthony Bookman amassed 150
yards on the ground in 1997.
Stanford's success on the ground led to its
aerial game clicking for the first time in eons.
Lewis completed 18-of-34 passes for 279 yards
his best effort since throwing for 390 yards
against Cal in 2001 and two touchdowns. He
seemed more comfortable moving around in the
pocket and throwing deep than he had all season.

Stanford's offense had a day two
years in the making when it pro
duced five touchdowns and a field
goal in a 38-27 victory over Arizona
State (4-6, 1-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) on Saturday.
The Cardinal didn't just get what
it needed to win, though, as it did
last week, when it stretched just 206
yards of total offense into a 21-14
victory over UCLA. Stanford (4-4,
2-4 Pacific 10 Conference) racked
up 467 yards of offense, including
188 on the ground both season
highs.
Senior quarterback Chris Lewis
completed 18-of-34 passes for 279
yards the second-highest total of
his career and the best mark for a
Cardinal quarterback since 2001
and sophomore tailback J.R.
Lemon rushed 34 times for 151
yards, both career highs. Lemon's
yardage output was the best by a
Stanford back since Mike Mitchell
ran for 179 yards in 1994.
In fact, Stanford's point total,
total offense and passing yardage
were all the best outputs the Cardi

nal has ever achieved in conference
play under second-year head coach
Buddy Teevens.
"When you execute, those things
can happen," Teevens said. "Was it
a breakout game? Certainly numer
ically it was nice, but we still have
work to do."
Stanford's offense displayed an
increasingly wide-open approach
for the second week in a row, as
Lewis repeatedly stretched the
field, completing passes of 46, 33
and 33 yards. He had 11 passes for
10 yards or more, including four
during Stanford's 86-yard drive to
end the first half, which put the
Cardinal on top, 28-7.
That 11-play drive was Stan
ford's longest of the year eclips
ing the seven-play, 83-yard drive
the Cardinal had executed in the
first quarter.
Lemon and Lewis both aided
each other's cause with their strong
performances.
"[The passing game] helped out,
no doubt," Lemon said. "When we
would fake pass . . . [the defense
was] already way out, so there were

Senior Chris Lewis looks for a receiver in the Cardinal's 38-27 home win over Arizona State on Saturday. The quarterback threw for 279 yards and completed two touchdown pass
es to lift Stanford to a victory and an even record on the season.
