# Soccer defeats Cal in overtime
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
There was drama. There were questionable
calls. There was physical play. There was more
drama. There were yellow cards. There was a
vocal California coach on the Women 's Soccer

sideline. There was even
more drama. There were last
minute heroics. Twice. Oh,
and did you hear about the drama?
Friday night's game between the Stanford
(10-8-2, 5-3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) and Cali
fornia (7-8-4, 2-6-1) women's soccer teams was

all you could ask for and more from any Stan
ford-Cal matchup.
The Cardinal got the best of the Golden
Bears in the last game at Maloney Field for se
niors Brittany Oliveira, Allyson Marquand, Al
isan Pabon, Natalie Spilger and Anna Hare,
taking home a 2-1 overtime victory.
In the first half, Stanford outplayed Cal and
went into the locker room with a 1-0 lead cour
tesy off a volley from almost 40 yards out by
2002 Second-Team All-Pac-10 midfielder
Marquand.
The ball ricocheted off a Cal player just past
the midfield mark and Marquand fired a bullet
past Bears goalkeeper Anna Key.
However, the Cardinal did not escape the
first period unscathed.
With 11:53 remaining in the first period, for
ward Oliveira went down hard. She was carried
off the field after suffering a torn ACL, the
nemesis of any female athlete.
The loss of Oliveira was an especially big

blow to the Cardinal: She is Stanford's second
leading scorer behind Marquand and had al
ready notched two shots on goal in her 33 min
utes of play.
Additionally, Stanford failed to convert on
two other golden opportunities in the first half.

In the ninth minute,
forward Natalie Sanderson
took a point-blank shot, but
her attempt sailed over the

crossbar. Just three minutes later, Marquand
had a similar opportunity and got off a rocket of
a shot, but it was directed square at the Cal
keeper.

"Definitely, I was happy with our play other
than [the last 25 minutes of regulation]," Stan
ford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "We got the
ball to the outside and kept things calm."
The Cardinal's inability to capitalize on such
opportunities allowed the feisty Bears to stay in
the match.

While Stanford continued to play its game at
the start of the second half, things drastically
changed with 25 minutes remaining in the game.

Cal turned what had been a soccer match
into an all-out brawl on muddy Maloney Field.
This was exactly the type of game Ratcliffe was
hoping to avoid and for good reason.
"I think Cal wanted it to be a fight, it was
turning into a fight and that's not our game," he
said. "At the end of regulation it was just a fran
tic fight and when it comes to that I think they're
tougher than us."
The Bears capitalized and posted a 4-3 shot
