# Despite injuries, Card wins exhibition
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The injury-plagued No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team unofficially opened its season
with an exhibition win over Love and Basketball,
defeating the team composed almost entirely of
UCLA graduates, 69-52.
The Cardinal never trailed despite the fact
that it was missing several key players.
Stanford was without forwards T'Nae Thiel
(broken foot), Azella Perryman (ankle), Ezia
maka Okafor (torn achilles tendon) and guard
Katie Denny (sprained MCL).
However, the absence of Thiel, Perryman and
Okafor at the post made room for freshman Kris
ten Newlin.
Newlin got the start at center and played 30
minutes before fouling out. Although Newlin got
off to a slow start, failing to score in the first half,
she found her rhythm in the second and finished
with nine points, seven boards and two blocks.
"She did really well. We're really excited
about the way she played," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "With the number of
people hurt in the post, she got thrown into the
fire and she responded really well."
Newlin was not the only Cardinal to struggle
early. Stanford didn't look quite like a team
ranked seventh in the nation as it turned the ball
over often in the opening minutes. Additionally,
the team struggled to knock down open jumpers.
"I wasn't happy with some of our turnovers,"
VanDerveer said. "I think we need to do a better
job of taking care of the ball. That was something
I was disappointed with."
Junior guard Kelley Suminski was also dis
turbed by the turnover problem.
"Turnovers are something we try and focus on
and limit as much as possible," Suminski said. "I
think we also need to keep our intensity up. We
kind of let down and starting turning the ball
over."

However, the Cardinal was missing one criti

cal component of its game in
those opening minutes: Nicole

Powell.
Stanford looked like a dif
ferent team as soon as Powell

stepped on the floor. Powell played only 22 min
utes in the contest, but her presence was felt
every second.
She managed team highs in rebounds and as
sists with 12 and three, respectively, and added 11
points in her short time on the floor, including an
impressive reverse layup.
Powell was not the only familiar face to make
notable contributions.
Redshirt junior Chelsea Trotter, who en

joyed a breakout season last year, continued to
show why she earned her starting job. Trotter
displayed an exceptional inside-outside game,
knocking down perimeter shots and demon
strating an array of effective post moves.
In 28 minutes, Trotter put up a highly impres
sive stat line: 15 points, nine rebounds, a block

and a steal.
What might have
been even more impressive
was her efficiency. Trotter
missed only one shot all night,

going seven-for-eight from the field.
Guards Suminski and Susan Borchardt were
also steady for the Cardinal.
Borchardt put on a shooting clinic in the first
half, hitting all five of her shots, including two
from behind the arc. She finished with 14 points.
Suminski scored 12 points in 30 minutes and
led the offense, which focused on pushing the ball
up the floor.
"We did look to run offensively," Van-

Derveer said. "But we didn't want to show too
much because this is an exhibition game. We
didn't run any plays. Offensively, we really
played with one hand behind our back, on pur
pose."
Defensively, Stanford was solid for the entire
game.
"Our post defense was good," VanDerveer
said. "No one went off on us. Our defense was
good, not great though. People work really hard
at it."
The Cardinal did not allow an individual to
score more than 11 points. Former UCLA
standouts Michelle Greco, Janae Hubbard
and Candace Baldwin scored 11 points
apiece.
Stanford also looked great on the boards, fin
ishing the game with a 39-26 rebounding edge.
The Cardinal will play its final exhibition on
Thursday when it takes on Everyone's Internet at
7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. The game will be
broadcast on KZSU, 90.1 FM.
