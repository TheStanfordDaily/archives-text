The United States should resolve conflicts
through international cooperation instead of
war, said presidential candidate Dennis
Kucinich, a Democrat, in a speech on Saturday
that focused on last spring's war on Iraq.
"The idea that conflict is inevitable, that war
is inevitable, needs to be inspected deeply," said
the Ohio congressman, arguing that the United
States should not have waged war on Iraq and
should remove its troops from the country im
mediately.
Kucinich, the only presidential candidate

who voted against the con
troversial USA Patriot Act,
is considered one of the most
left-wing of the Democratic
candidates "so far to the
left that he makes Howard
Dean look like Barry Gold
water," according to a Time
magazine profile published
in October.
He has been large
ly ignored by the main
stream media, barely regis

ters in most polls of primary voters and gets lit
tle support from the Democratic Party. But by
pouring the modest $4 million raised by his
campaign into grassroots efforts, Kucinich has
garnered a loyal, though small, support base.
"He's the only candidate that I truly believe
in," said Bill Barrows, a Lake County resident
who came to Stanford to hear Kucinich's
speech, sponsored by the Aurora Forum.
Kucinich's most daring proposals for the
presidency including cutting the Pentagon's
budget, creating a universal health care system
and withdrawing the United States from the
North American Free Trade Agreement and
the World Trade Organization. He also hopes
to repeal the Patriot Act, which expanded po
lice investigative and surveillance powers, and
establish a Department of Peace, which would


Dennis Kucinich
handle issues ranging from domestic
abuse to nuclear non-proliferation,
aiming to "create the day when war it
self becomes archaic."
The war on Iraq, Kucinich said,
has brought about "moral, political,
economic and cultural disaster."
He proposed that the United
States hand the United Nations con
trol of Iraq, including its oil resources
and contracts for rebuilding.
"The motivating factor of the war
is oil and the privatization of Iraqi
people's assets," he said, claiming that
the Bush administration used Sept.
11, 2001, as a pretext for waging war
on a country that had nothing to do
with the terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and Pentagon.
"Very little of it was cognitive; it
was visceral," he said.

Kucinich's political career began
in 1977, when he became the youngest
mayor of Geveland at the age of 31.
But after Kucinich refused to sell the
public municipal power company to a
private utility, the city defaulted on
loans. For the next 15 years, Kucinich
lost every election, until he won a seat
in the Ohio Senate in 1994 and be
came a congressman in 1996.
While polls suggest that Kucinich
is unlikely to be the next U.S. presi
dent, the candidate cautioned the au
dience against prematurely convict
ing him as a dud, after a student work
ing on his campaign asked if he really
has a chance.
"I am ready, after 26 years in poli
tics, to be an overnight success," he
said.
Barring that, he said, he hopes to
add more diversity to the opinions ex
pressed among the most prominent
Democratic candidates for president.
"My presence in the debate keeps
the other candidates honest," he said.
