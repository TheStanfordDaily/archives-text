### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Haas Center and the School of Education
have announced a new program called "Ready to
Read," which will train tutors in teaching tech
niques and give them a knowledge base for under
standing the social and political issues that sur
round learning the English language.
The founders of Ready to Read, including Pro
gram Assistant Savitha Moorthy, claim that the
program is the first of its kind at Stanford.
"The [program] does more than prepare stu
dents to become tutors, it gives them a broader in
tellectual framework that exposes them to the
structure of schools and ways language is integrat
ed in schools," Moorthy said.
The focus of the program is to improve the
English literacy of children in local elementary
schools. Moorthy argued that in order to accom
plish this goal, it is critical to start at improving an
individual's vocabulary.
"Often what is really important in building vo
cabulary is language and learning English to help
you access that vocabulary, that is the most inter

esting thing the Stanford student will be doing,"
she said.
Moorthy argued that English literacy and hav
ing a strong vocabulary are essential for any indi
vidual to be successful.
She said that Stanford students are perfect for
the program because they bring a "rich grasp of
vocabulary" into the tutoring.
She emphasized that the issue of English liter
acy is especially significant in California and the
surrounding Stanford area because of the great in
flux of non-native English speakers.
"There are a lot of immigrant children entering
California schools," Moorthy said. "I think the
current statistic is one out of every six children."
Moorthy says one of the problems hindering
the ability of these individuals to develop their
English skills is that since there are often high per
centages of English language learners within a
given classroom, they are unable to utilize then
peers for support, knowledge and direct tutoring.
Students accepted into the program will enroll
in a winter-quarter course called "Critical Per
spectives on Tutoring English Language Learn
ers." In the spring, they will be involved in two

two-hour tutoring sessions per week in East Palo
Alto.
Because so many service programs already
exist, some Stanford students are skeptical about
whether the new program is entirely unique.
"I think we need to put more focus on the [pro
grams] that are already in place," sophomore Jina
Hyun said. "It's an issue of quality over quantity."
Other Stanford students expressed optimism
about the program.
"It's a really good idea because English is a fun
damental thing people need to know to accom
plish things both now and later in life," said sopho
more Jennifer Lee. "The exposure sounds like it
will really help; to hear [the language] and try it is
a great way to build on their English skills."
In addition to helping students obtain English
literacy, Moorthy thinks that "Ready to Read"
will have a significant beneficial impact on the tu
tors.
"I have been a teacher [for students learning
English] most of my adult life," she said. "I wish I
had access to a program like this when I was en
tering the teaching profession. It would have
made a huge difference for me."
