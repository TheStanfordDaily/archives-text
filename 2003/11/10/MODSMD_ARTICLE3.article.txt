# Progressive risks distribution sanctions
## 
### NANCY WANG 
The Stanford Progressive, a left-wing student publication, continued
door-to-door distribution last week despite statements by University offi
cials reinforcing a policy that prohibits door-to-door distribution of publica
tions.
Morris Graves, associate dean of students, said at last Tuesday's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting that since The Progressive distributed door
to-door despite policies to the contrary, there will be ramifications if anyone
lodges a complaint.
In such a case, The Progressive would need to appear before the Organi
zation Conduct Board, which investigates reported violations of University
policies and practices.
"Possible penalties assessed by the OCB range from the freezing of the
funds in the Progressive's ASSU account, to a temporary suspension of The
Progressive's printing privileges, to the suspension of the Progressive as a
student group," said Publications Board Director Piotr Kosicki, a junior.
"It's impossible to predict how severe any penalty might be."
So far, The Progressive has yet to be punished by the University.
"Currently no complaint has been filed by any member(s) of our commu
nity," Graves said. "Further speculation at this point would be meaningless."
According to Mirrielees Resident Fellow Laurette Beeson, the Publica
tions Board telephoned to ask for the dorm's policy regarding publication
distribution. Before Mirrielees staff decided unanimously against door-to
door distribution, however, The Progressive had already been delivered to
residents' doorsteps.
"There are still papers lying in the hallway. If the dorm gets billed for
cleaning services, the bill will be sent to The Progressive," Beeson said.
A similar incident occurred at Casa Zapata.
"One of our freshman students was escorted out of Zapata by an RA and
was told that they didn't want the papers," said senior Michael Zakaras, the
president of the Progressive. "The RA actually collected all the papers that
had been distributed and handed them back to our student."
Zakaras stated that, as of yet, The Progressive has not received any ob
jections from residents themselves regarding the papers.
When asked about door-to-door distribution of publications, Roble
freshman Felicia Lee said, "I've never thought of it as a problem. If some
thing bothers you, you should just ignore it."
Freshman Emily Hite agreed, pointing out that the policy will negatively
affect publications that count on door-to-door distribution to increase their
publicity.
"I think it's fine," she said. "I wouldn't go out of my way to get the publi
cations otherwise."
According to Zakaras, the policy does not belong at an institution of high
er learning.
"We feel that a policy that inhibits the free spread of ideas contradicts the
most crucial mission of any university," said Zakaras. "The notion that stu
dents need to be protected from ideas that might make them feel uncom
fortable is absurd. It is antithetical to the long tradition of liberal education.
Instead of encouraging an atmosphere of dialogue, discussion and debate,
the administration is doing what it can to turn a place of learning into a place
of daycare."
