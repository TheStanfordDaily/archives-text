# ASSU tailgate gets lukewarm reception
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU promised partygoers
a "wet" tailgate event on Saturday
afternoon, but attendees did not
expect to have to bring their um
brellas.
The party in the Mirrielees
courtyard was the first ASSU party
with alcohol in over a decade, but
due to dreary weather and last
minute advertising, turnout was
much lower than expected.
ASSU senators had estimated
that 450 students would turn out for
the event, an afternoon tailgate
party aimed at stimulating atten
dance at Saturday's football game
against Arizona State. But fewer
than 100 students gathered in the
courtyard at any given time, and
during most of the party, atten
dance hovered around 20 people.
"We're going to learn from
this," said ASSU vice president
Joey Natoli, a junior.
Attendance was at its highest
when new batches of pizzas were
delivered to the party. Party-goers
consumed a total of 33 pizzas, but
did not finish either of the two kegs.
"The pizza draws people," said
sophomore senator George Hill,
mid-party. "Hopefully the drinks
will keep them here."
Despite the disappointing atten
dance, members of the student life
committee, which organized the
event, saw the tailgate as a success
ful affirmation of their goal to show
that alcohol, the ASSU and fun can
all coexist.
"The idea behind this event was
to create a precedent for other stu
dent-run events with alcohol," said
junior Alex Moore, a committee
member. "The faith that students
had in the ASSU putting on an
event with alcohol was very low.
Social capital was low. The atten
dance wasn't that high, but we feel
that [the tailgate party] was a good
precedent for future events with al

cohol."
Hill also added that he consid
ered the tailgate a success.
"I think [the party] was good,"
he said. "It was a nice turnout con
sidering the type of event and the
weather. We definitely set a prece
dent, in that just serving alcohol is
not that big of a problem for the
ASSU and for parties in general, as
long as you have it in control."
Security was tight at the party,

with the ASSU doing everything in
its power to follow the Office of
Student Activities' party guidelines
and prevent underage drinking.
Four paid security guards were pre
sent and volunteer "sober moni
tors" mostly the senators them
selves mingled with attendees.
According to Natoli, the fire de
partment admitted to him that it
would be sending undercover per
sonnel to the party to try to get al

cohol without wristbands. While a
few wristband-less people did try to
obtain beer, Natoli, who manned
the kegs for a large part of the
event, doubted that any of them
were undercover firemen.
"They looked too young," he
said. "And they had friends here. I
doubt if an undercover fireman
would have friends here."

Students hang around Mirrielees, partaking of the bounty of the keg during the ASSU's pre-game tailgate party.
The party was planned in con
junction with Mirrielees staff, but
some of the residents were less than
grateful for the free pizza and beer.
"F â€” You ASSU" was the subject
line of an e-mail sent out late Satur
day morning by sophomore Daniel
Balick, who initiated a rant against
the DJ's loud music. At least a half
dozen e-mails were sent over the
Mirrielees chat list in the next few
hours of the party, agreeing with
Balick.
Several ASSU supporters also
responded to the e-mail tirades, in
cluding sophomore Noriko Boyd, a
senator.
"I am sorry to see such a poor
and ungrateful reaction to this
event," she wrote. "Obviously peo
ple do not understand or appreci

ate what ASSU does for the stu
dents. People are entitled to their
opinions, but I think a more con
structive mode of communication
and action can be taken in order to
convey your thoughts."
Moore acknowledged that there
were problems not only with resi
dents but staff as well. The staff,
for instance, demanded that the
ASSU provide funds to rent two
portable toilets so that partiers
would not have to use Mirrielees
bathrooms.
"A lot of the RFs are fairly
paranoid about having alcoholic
events on their premises because
it's just so much easier to say, 'No,
I don't want it,"' Moore said. "It's
not really an issue of worrying
about kids having fun; it's more of
an issue of protecting yourself,
which is fairly understandable
when you get sued all the time. But
it's a loss to students. They're turn
ing us into Harvard."
