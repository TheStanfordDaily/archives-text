## Twelve random questions 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
We grill Nadeem Siddiqui, exec
utive director

of Dining Ser
vices, on
what's sim
mering in his
kitchen. And
how to get
cookin' with
the ladies. In
other words,
we get him to
dish, all in
good taste, no

doubt. And what's the deal with
dal?

ISome kids grow up dream
ing of being basketball play
ers or astronauts. When you
were a kid, did you want to be
the Iron Chef?

You have to carry extra insur
ance when I am cooking in your
kitchen because I'll burn it
down. My expertise is not in
cooking. When I was growing
up I wanted to be a pilot for
some reason.
2 Your culinary claim to fame
is dal. What's in it?
The only thing I can cook well
is dal, which is an Indian dish.
It's lentils and a lot of great
spices,secret spices.
3 How secret are these spices
we're talking about?
Very secret. I can't give it out
because that's just the way it is.
You'd have to kill me?
That I won't do. That's where I
draw the line.
5 If the Stanford Daily were a
dish, what would it be: filet
mignon, or pimento loaf?
I think it depends on the day.
They have a menu cycle. Each
day is a different flavor, which
is the fun part about The Stan
ford Daily. It's not the same. I
think there has been sweet
and sour.
6 After you finish preparing
some really good dal, do
you ever give a big, hearty
"Bam!"?
I just do a big laugh and sigh
that it came out okay and the
kitchen didn't burn.
7 Can you give me a good
"Bam!"?
"Bam!" Is that what they call
it?
8 They say the way to a man's
heart is through his stom
ach. What about the ladies?
I think my wife tells me it's
through her brain, not the
stomach.
So your dal doesn't do it.
My dal doesn't do it. Didn't do
it for her.
A Why do chefs wear those
A U big, goofy hats?
I don't have to worry about it be
cause I don't have much hair left.
nlf I were to save my din
ing points like Chuck E.
Cheese tickets all year, could I
get a Stanford dining T-shirt or
a spinning top?
Whatever you want. You let
me know. I'll even sign it for
you.
"| do you idolize
Wolfgang Puck or
Julia Child?
Julia Child. I have met her and
she comes from the old school,
with the basic food and flavors
greasy stuff. She's wonder
ful. She's very tall. She's, like,
six foot something. So I feel like
a little short guy, but it's okay. I
don't mind.
