### ELENA WRIGHT 
"VRRRRMMMM!" My roommate and I are watching from our window as some guy
roars up to our dorm on a motorized bike, headlights blazing. My roommate spots him first.
"Hey, Elena, check out this guy!" she calls. "He's on a motorcycle or something."
I look down and laugh gleefully. "No, that's just Edwin," I tell her. "And it's a bike. It's
electric. He made it."
Edwin is one of those guys I was told I'd meet in college. No, he's neither a sketchy So
cial Dance grad student (though he is taking the class), nor a "friendly" frat boy on the prowl.
Rather, he's a slightly crazed genius-slash-funnyman who has a mile-long resume. But he
downplays his success with self-deprecating goofiness. Edwin's the kind of guy who, when
talking about the cover story Forbes did about him (that's right, Forbes as in Forbes maga
zine), will end up telling you about the cross-dressing Annie Oakley photos which that au
gust publication's photo department still has of him. But I'll get to that later.
I notice that people ambling down the hall glance casually into the room where we're en
sconced, see Edwin, then do a double-take. Edwin is no shrinking violet. He's a bundle of
energy with waist-long black hair streaked in several places with fiery red highlights. He ges
tures profusely as he talks. And he moves around a lot. He stands up. He leans on my bed
frame. Then he sits back down.

At one point, he seems to be having some sort of attack as I'm taking notes. Alarmed, I
ask him what's wrong. "Isn't that 'Thriller?' " he asks. I realize he's alluding to the strains of
hip-hop coming from some room down the hall (it's actually a Grandmaster Flash track),
and that the raised elbows and glazed look from side-to-side is Edwin's way of "dancing."
"Maybe I should stick to the two-step," he shrugs, smiling.
I told Edwin that I wanted to interview him a while back, and he offered to make the
(loooong) trek in the rain to our dorm at about 11 at night.
So our interview begins with Edwin handing me a printout of a brochure he created

awhile back featuring all the bikes he's made. Be
side descriptions of each bike (a sample bullet
point reads, "Friction drive transmission") are
pictures of him beaming merrily atop each con
traption. On the back of the pamphlet is another
pic of him as a cherubic little kid on a red Hot
Wheels Kiddie Car.
Edwin has built eight different bikes, count
ing two that he constructed in collaboration with
his middle school electric car team (a team which
was pretty advanced for a bunch of seventh and
eighth graders). Edwin said that his gang was
taught "about electrical control, welding, calcu
lating ratios, how to make sure a vehicle can
stop —always a good thing, we had some trouble
with that in the beginning!"
His first motor-revving experience came at
the tender age of 10 years old, when he envi
sioned building a go-cart for himself. His dad
helped him out, and they used a lawnmower en
gine for power the thing.
But after handling gas engines for a while,
Edwin says, "I was like, 'That's pretty grody.' "
Gas motors were disgusting to work with be
cause of the exhaust, the oil dripping every
where, and the so-called "radiator tattoo" Edwin
feared getting if he fell off the go-cart onto the
hot engine. So Edwin decided electric power was
the best way to go. And the rest is history.
Have you been on international TV? Edwin
has. When people hear that, Edwin says, they
usually get pumped. "What show was it? 'Daw
son's Creek?"'

No, it was something even cooler? A PBS
special entitled "Triumph of the Nerds 2.01." It
was a documentary profiling up-and-coming Sil
icon Valley, um, industry enthusiasts (code-word
for you-know-what). The makers of the show
happened upon the same gadget shop Edwin fre
quented when buying the parts for the Go-Ped,
his first electric vehicle. The doc team apparent
ly decided that a 10-year-old making an E.V.
(electric vehicle) was definitely a nerd worth re
searching. So they put him on air.
Edwin and his family had no idea of the scope
of his fame until they were flying to Hong Kong
many years later, and the show popped up as the
featured in-flight entertainment. Edwin says he
could hardly stand to watch the 10-year-old
dumpling he once was say things like, "Follow
your dreams" in a high-pitched, prepubescent

lisp. He slumped down in his seat, desperately trying to avoid the other passengers' gazes.
But his parents were loud and proud. Edwin pantomimes his mother's reaction, clapping en
thusiastically and motioning for everyone else to check out the screen: "That's my son!" he
mouths.
I remember asking Edwin what reactions he usually gets. "To my smell?" he answers in
all seriousness. In terms of his flashy bike, he says he gets very positive feedback. He loves it
when people ask, "Did you build that?" He is extremely proud of his invention, and he en
joys telling people about his Madagascar Project (a pun: "Mad-at-gas-car Project, get it?")
and thus influencing the masses by example.
"What the —?" a guy says in amazement upon hearing that Edwin made the vehicle
himself. "And you're a freshman?" As our audience grows, I find myself becoming Edwin's
doting P.R. person. "Now tell them about the time you were on the cover of Forbes Maga
zine," I prompt him, and some guys standing nearby turn to him with rapt attention.
"Um, ok," agrees Edwin cheerfully. As Edwin says, he's from "all around the world and
back to here."
He went to Gunn High School, and Forbes decided that Gunn is home to business peo
ple of the future. So they visited and picked four kids, including Edwin, to feature in their
magazine. "Do I look like a businessman?" asks Edwin incredulously. "I mean, look at me."
Regardless of his appearance, Forbes fans might remember seeing Edwin on the cover
awhile back with the three other students, or reading the accompanying article with the pic
ture of Edwin pretending to be a robot. "It's the least flattering picture of me in existence."
He demonstrates, balling his fists and squeezing his eyes shut in concentration. "I look like
I'm in a Metamucil ad," he says. "I hate to say it, but I look constipated."
But Edwin is happy that they chose this picture over some others they had apparent
ly on the same day that the Forbes team came around, Edwin was doing a project with an all
male group of students. Each group in the class was assigned a historical figure to represent,
and his group was given Annie Oakley. When Edwin asked which boy would play Ms. Oak
ley, all the other boys stared at him because of his long locks.
"Ohhh, no," he said, but to no avail. Cut to Edwin in a skirt and bonnet, flirting playfully
with another boy as they sang. "They did it in silhouette behind a screen because I don't look
good in a skirt," he says. But the photographer from Forbes crept behind the screen and shot
a roll and a half of film. Luckily, they did not use any of the pictures. Edwin speculates they
are holding onto them as blackmail fodder for the future, when he makes it big.
In the course of our chat, Edwin tells me that I'm the only person who laughs at his jokes.
"Everyone else tells me to shut up. Even I tell me to shut up. 'Shut up, Edwin.' " But the kid
is hilarious. Several times during the interview he taps me with concern on the shoulder,
telling me to come up for air so I won't suffocate from laughter. "That would be a terrible
way to die ... actually, not really, right?" Edwin considers this. "At least you would die with
a smile on your face." He pauses again, then cracks, "I would say something nice at your fu
neral."

After the Go-Ped, Edwin made a new bike called the Vivace the next year, sans
papa.Chiu. The coolest thing about the Vivace, which has since been dismantled (along with
every bike except the current one—the parts of each were used to construct the next model),
was what Edwin fondly remembers as its distinctive "banana-yellow bucket seat."'
Two years later, he made the Inception, Genl, which was his first recumbent model. Re
cumbent means "laid back." There's a lower center of gravity, and supports a greater
amount of battery mass, so it's more comfy for longer distances. In "Revenge of the Nerds"
terms, it's slick.
These first three E. V.s were not very reliable like some people we all know, they were
cooler than they were practical. When Edwin started high school, he needed a better method
of transportation to make his daily four-mile commute. At first, he relied on hitching rides
from parents or friends. He also tried biking, but he hated getting stuck in traffic, winch he
describes with a shiver as "a terrible sprawling mass of .honking, angry people." Also, he
deemed the up-hill journey too inconvenient for a regular bike.
So did our hero mass tranz it? Did he buy a Beamer? Of course not. In his trademark
think-outside-the-box style, Edwin opted to put his hobby to good use. "I built the 'Gas-X,'
" he tells me, warning me that this is the first in a line of very bad puns.
"I named my bike after an anti-gas machine," he says. To clarify this for me (as if it needs
clarification), Edwin tells me, "That's, like, anti-bloating. It's really disgusting. Go to the
Gas-X Web site, they probably have some really flowery name for it." He pauses, in the man
ner of Rodin's Thinker. "Gas-reduction pills," he says. "Intestinal stabilizers."
Edwin describes his Madagascar Project (his portentous collective name for his E.V.-
making experiences) as the result of "research and development the fancy way of saying
'trial and error.'"

After he makes a vehicle, he gives it a test-drive, trying to suss out possible improvements.
Then he uses this knowledge to create a new vehicle.
To make the Gas-X, a mountain bike he converted to suit his purposes, Edwin realized

that he needed to make some changes. Each of
his prior vehicles had throttles with only two
speeds: "kinda slow and not as slow," and Edwin
knew that he would need more flexibility for a
vehicle he was using on a daily basis. So the Gas-
X is the first to feature a "variable motor speed
controller," fancy-talk for a throttle which al
lowed Edwin to speed up and slow down with
ease. It also was the first to feature his cus
tomized sound system.
According to Edwin, I am a skilled note
taker. This is not a compliment. He tells me this
in an appalled and scandalized tone, like a strait
laced suburban man discovering his neighbors
are nudists. "What is this, the Enquirer?" he
asks.
He also dislikes how I scribble down some
of his more off-kilter comments, like when he
tells me, "I'm really bad with names and faces.
Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, and
I'm brushing my teeth in front of the mirror,
then, I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, who is that and what
is he doing in my bathroom. Oh, it's me.' " He
turns to me, beaming. "Wouldn't that freak you
out?" Or when he says, apropos of nothing,
"Guess what? I also have a baby with wings, you
tabloid paparazzi!"
Edwin made the Inception Gen 2, Revl in
2000, and he says it is "meant to be a replace
ment for a car, so I tried to load it up with as
many cheesy, useless amenities as I could." On
the cover of the Madagascar Project pamphlet,
the Inception Gen 2, Revl (which I'll refer to as
the 1.G.) is pictured with Christmas ornaments.
Someone took the I.G. for a joyride and crashed
it, breaking the $6OO windshield Edwin had
talked the owner into selling for a mere $2O.
Characteristically, Edwin doesn't seem too
sad when he tells the story. "Yeah, I can't get an
other one," he says casually. "That was a once in
a lifetime deal." Another feature that's now ab
sent is a spoiler "a big, useless wing that many
people put on the backs of their cars." But
Edwin's bike still boasts cool gadgets a-plenty.
Watching Edwin show off his vehicle is like
watching "Bill Nye the Science Guy." First, he'll
turn on the stereos, which are hooked up to an
MP3 player and which rest on a sub-woofer.
Then he'll show you the blue underbody lights
and brilliant 40-watt headlights. There's a huge
basket on the back, a rear-view mirror, and a

luxurious-looking recumbent seat.
While you're gaping in awe, he'll point out the different chargers and mysterious black
boxes with technical names and functions, then whip out the retractable extension cord (a la
your vacuum cleaner).
Not only does it look cool, but it also is a practical mode of transportation, with many
fringe benefits. Some of the reasons to switch to electric, Edwin says: "It's quiet, fast, doesn't
pollute a very useful invention. " Edwin has calculated that "in a single year, I save $l2O
on gas. Every 20 miles cost me five cents."
Add that to the cool factor of going up to 30 miles per hour (don't tell the DMV) in what
looks like a bike without pedaling at all, and Edwin's E.V.s look pretty tempting.
Back in the day, Edwin was a hard-core nemesis of automobiles. He despised what he
calls "gas-guzzling pollution machines," and soon had a catch-phrase he would recite: "We
are not inescapably bound to the paradigm of combustion transportation."
He likens his proselytizing to that of an Evangelical Christian on a street comer. He
would rant at people passionately about the evils of cars in order to convert them to his way
of thinking. "That's no way to reach people," he now concedes.
Currently, he's racking up even more electric experience working with an electric vehi
cle inventor in Palo Alto who has given Edwin a more realistic ambition to convince at
least a fraction of the population to use electric vehicles instead of gas cars. "The way we [op
erate] now is pretty irresponsible," Edwin says. He's not looking to make money off this.
Rather, he wants EV's to become a trend for the good of humanity.
In fact, Edwin isn't looking for a career making the vehicles. "Right now, I'm majoring in
General Education Requirements," he tells me. "But someday, either electrical engineering
or product design." But then again, knowing Edwin, that could totally change. When I ask
Edwin what he wants to be, he says, "I want to be a real boy."
In reality, Edwin plans to become a professor, he tells me later, and I picture him as the
mad scientist teacher we all wish we'd had. He is an avid teacher whose enthusiasm for bikes
is contagious. He cajoles me into coming outside in the rain and taking a test ride on the I.G.
(ok, he didn't have to ask me twice). He gives me his helmet, shows me where the brake is
and how to turn it on, and then sends me on my way. I think Edwin's is the only bike at Stan
ford on which you can wear a helmet without feeling like a fool (in fact, if you don't wear one,
you are an idiot, plain and simple). After crashing once, I see the practicality in its use.
"Are you OK?" asks Edwin, truly worried.
"Yeah, sorry about that. I hope the bike is all right."
"Oh, it's fine. It takes some getting used to. I've flipped this bike over many, many
times."
I try to imagine Edwin doing wheelies and other tricks on the Inception 2, Gen 2 and fail
miserably. Then I climb on again and actually manage a couple successful rides without
Edwin's help. YAY! As we discuss his technique, still more guys from my dorm keep com
ing up to see what we're doing, and what this crazy contraption is.
