## Band needs to improve behavior 
### 
Last month, the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band traveled to
the University of Southern California
to perform at an Oct. 11 football game.
After the trip, the Band's bus company notified
the University that the Band had left its bus in
poor condition, with vomit in a bathroom sink,
two broken armrests and other mess strewn

about. This behavior is not
acceptable for any student
group. It is crucial that the
Band understands this, and
takes action to make sure
such behavior isn't repeat
ed in the future.
The bus company right
fully communicated with
the Band and the Univer
sity to express its discon
tent over what had oc
curred. While a group can
not be expected to leave its
bus in perfect condition, it
is clear that Band mem
bers could have avoided
the severity of damage
that resulted. Bus compa

nies are expected to clean their vehicles after
each trip, but this should not be viewed as an in
vitation for bus riders to unnecessarily make
messes or bring about damage.
Band management has taken a number of
positive steps toward correcting the problem.

Band members who travel from now on must
sign a document affirming the Band's travel pol
icy and the Fundamental Standard. Additional
ly, there must be at least one Band staff member
present for every 10 Band members and alcohol
consumption is not allowed on buses anymore.
After a meeting with the Band on Oct. 24, the
Athletic Department established that the Band

must clear all travel plans
through it and that a de
partment staff member
must travel with the Band
on future trips. These are
appropriate measures that
will help ensure such an in
cident is not repeated.
However, putting
more rules into place is
not enough. Band mem
bers need to take on an in
creased sense of individu
al responsibility. To be
successful, the Band needs
compliance from every
member. Band manage
ment should continue to
make it clear to all mem

bers what is expected of them. The Band has
gotten in trouble for misbehaving in the past. It
is time this ended. No one wants the Band to
stop having fun, but all Band members must re
alize that there is a clear line between good old
fashioned fun and harmful recklessness.
