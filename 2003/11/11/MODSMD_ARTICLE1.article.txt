Dr. Jill Tarter, director of the institute for
the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
spoke last night about the newest technology
and research methods used to find the answer
to the age-old question: Are we alone?
Throughout her presentation, Tarter ad
dressed the use of receivers for radio, optical
and infrared impulses from extraterrestrial life.
She called this endeavor "Archaeology of the
future," implying the paradox that extraterres
trial signals from the past will enlighten scien
tists of technology for the future.
Among such strategies, the most feasible in
cludes searching for minor and obvious imper
fections in received data.
"If an extraterrestrial being wants to com
municate with other life, they would most like
ly send signals that are either highly detectable
or barely noticeable so they force careful scien
tific examination," Tarter said.
As the Director and Bernard M. Oliver
Chair of SETI, Tarter oversees numerous de
veloping projects, such as the Allen Telescope
Array, which will receive signals as a radio
"fly's eye." With such technology, SETI's
speed for signal reading will increase by a fac
tor of 400, Tarter said.
She cited other large-scale future projects,
including Project Argus. This plan aspires to
include nearly 5,000 members who will place
satellite dishes in their backyard to survey the
sky for signals with greater accuracy.
In the event that a signal from intelligent life
is detected by SETI, the organization plans to
undergo private confirmation. If verified, their
finding would be announced to the world.
"Information is the property of all humani
ty," Tarter said. "If a message came to us, it
would be our duty to share it with the rest of the
world."
Several audience members, including Alex
Boon, a local resident, praised Tarter for an en
gaging lecture.
"I thought it was a very articulate discus-
