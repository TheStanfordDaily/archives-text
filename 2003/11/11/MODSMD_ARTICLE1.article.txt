# Extraterrestrial life possible, says speaker

### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ JR 
Dr. Jill Tarter, director of the institute for
the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
spoke last night about the newest technology
and research methods used to find the answer
to the age-old question: Are we alone?
Throughout her presentation, Tarter ad
dressed the use of receivers for radio, optical
and infrared impulses from extraterrestrial life.
She called this endeavor "Archaeology of the
future," implying the paradox that extraterres
trial signals from the past will enlighten scien
tists of technology for the future.
Among such strategies, the most feasible in
cludes searching for minor and obvious imper
fections in received data.
"If an extraterrestrial being wants to com
municate with other life, they would most like
ly send signals that are either highly detectable
or barely noticeable so they force careful scien
tific examination," Tarter said.
As the Director and Bernard M. Oliver
Chair of SETI, Tarter oversees numerous de
veloping projects, such as the Allen Telescope
Array, which will receive signals as a radio
"fly's eye." With such technology, SETI's
speed for signal reading will increase by a fac
tor of 400, Tarter said.
She cited other large-scale future projects,
including Project Argus. This plan aspires to
include nearly 5,000 members who will place
satellite dishes in their backyard to survey the
sky for signals with greater accuracy.
In the event that a signal from intelligent life
is detected by SETI, the organization plans to
undergo private confirmation. If verified, their
finding would be announced to the world.
"Information is the property of all humani
ty," Tarter said. "If a message came to us, it
would be our duty to share it with the rest of the
world."
Several audience members, including Alex
Boon, a local resident, praised Tarter for an en
gaging lecture.
"I thought it was a very articulate discus-
sion of the program," Boon said.
"As an engineer, I enjoyed how de
tailed she was on the different tech
nology used to survey the skies. I
also liked how she made it interest
ing for both advanced researchers
and common folk."
After the presentation, Tarter
took questions and engaged the au
dience in a forum of discussion. In
particular, audience member Sh
eryl Lawson, another local resident,
enjoyed this portion of the presen
tation.
"It gave the audience members a
chance to ask and answer any qualms
that might have been bugging us
throughout the discussion," Lawson
said.
Others, including Stanford alum
nus Peter Stevens, enjoyed the com

prehensiveness of the presentation.
"I thought it was a great overview
of the history and the range of prob
lems in the search," said Stevens.
"She outlined how difficult it was to
find these signals, which was some
thing I hadn't quite realized."
Tarter has received considerable
recognition for her work in the field
of astrophysics. She was the recipient
of two public service medals from
NASA, as well as the Group
Achievement Award for her contri
bution to the High Resolution Mi
crowave Survey Project and the Life
time Achievement Award from
Women in Aerospace. She was also
elected Fellow of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of
Science in 2002.
Although she is uncertain if life
exists on other planets, Tarter re
mains dedicated to the cause.
"I do not know when, or if SETI will
succeed," Tarter said. "I am only cer
tain that we must keep searching."
