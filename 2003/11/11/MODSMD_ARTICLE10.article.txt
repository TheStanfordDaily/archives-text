### BONITA SONG ANSWER GIRL 
QI don't really believe that global
warming exists, but my boyfriend
insists it is undeniable. Doesn't
this extremely cold weather prove
that there really isn't a warming trend?
A Man .. . here I was, thinking I
could avoid all that political
/ M funk, when you had to come and
be all up in here with the Contro
versy. Well I'll oblige, but before anyone gets
any ideas, I think I should make something

up-front right now: I promise that I will never, at any
point in my sad tenure as "Answer Girl" (and no, to
those of you who've asked, I did not choose the
name) acknowledge any questions about those
spicy Campustruth.org ads.

Not even if you try to make it science-y.
But anyway, back to your question: Almost all
scientists agree that the Earth is indeed undergoing
climate change — specifically, global warming.

Then what about the recent cold snap? You
see, the weather and the climate aren't the
same thing; the weather has to do with tem
porary local conditions, whereas the climate
refers to long-term, global weather patterns.
So, even though the recent weather has
provoked the emergence of sweaters, com
plaints and certain aspects of the human
anatomy — since yes, it happens for guys too,
it's just not as noticeable (or celebrated) —
this temperature drop doesn't even register a
blip on the climate scale. The difference be
tween weather and climate also means that

climate predictions are much more credible than
those about weather. That is, just because A1 Roker
isn't correct all that often, you can't automatically
write off climatologists, too.
The unfortunate thing is, they're saying some
pretty disturbing stuff. See, evidence indicates

that global mean temperature has risen about one
degree Fahrenheit over the past century, with a
disproportionate share of it over the past two
decades. And while that may not sound like much,
it's been enough to cause significant worldwide
ecological changes in the flowering times of plants
and migratory patterns of birds. What's really
scary is that scientists are predicting an ever-in
creasing rate in the warming of the Earth: Some
say the climate could be up to 11 degrees warmer
by 2100.
Of course, the numbers are controversial, and so
is the reported cause. Some scientists (along with
the entire oil industry) attribute most of global
warming to natural fluctuations in the sun's output;
other scientists argue that human activity is the sin
gle largest contributor.
But whatever the case: Sorry, but your boyfriend
is right. But hey, that's ok — I mean, everyone's ego
needs stroking at least once in a while.

your boyfriend, email her at bonita.song@Stanford.edu.
