## Foreign students not treated fairly 
### 
Last week, the Department of Home
land Security released plans for a new
database called the Student and Ex
change Visitor Information System
(SEVIS) that would track international students
in the United States. The stated purpose of this
database is to increase security in the wake of
the Sept. 11 attacks. In addition to the normal
fees for educational visas, international students
would be required to pay an additional $100 fee
to fund the upkeep of this new database. The
legislation that created this database mandates
that it be paid for by such fees, not by govern
ment appropriations. While national security is
an utmost concern, the government does not
have the right to hit international students with
such harsh sanctions.
It is unfair that international students should
both be subject to ever-increasing levels of re
strictions and also be forced to pay for those mea
sures. If the government truly believes that such a
database would make a difference in their efforts
to combat terrorism, it should fund the system â€”
especially when one considers the aspect of forc
ing those who haven't committed any wrongdo
ing to fund a system designed to screen out a
miniscule minority of those who do intend harm.
This result is especially disturbing given the
lack of evidence that any significant proportion
of international students have been involved in
either planning or implementing terrorist at
tacks. Additionally, there is no evidence that the
stronger security restrictions on international
students since Sept. 11 have prevented any ter

rorist attacks. Without any reason to believe that
an additional database will in anyway protect
American security interests, it is hard to see a
justification for charging international students
money to fund a system that duplicates the pur
pose of many other procedural safeguards of the
visa system.
These higher restrictions have directly affect
ed Stanford, with the University having seen no
increase in international student applications
since 1999. Before that, the trend had been to
ward a significant yearly increase in internation
al applications. Stanford administrators should
be concerned with the effect that these new re
strictions have on the school, both in terms of
promoting diversity and protecting the rights of
international students.
Stanford officials have not yet released an
opinion on this extra fee. While they have stated
that they are concerned and that they do not
want to be responsible for collecting the fee, ad
ministrators, especially those responsible for
being advocates for international students,
should take a stronger stance at this time. *
Beyond making the already restrictive pro
cess of getting a student visa harder, there are
also concerns that this will further reduce the
number of international students who are able
to attend Stanford, especially those for whom
the increasing cost proves prohibitive. Interna
tional students are a vital part of the Stanford
community. The administration should protect
this vulnerable portion of the population when
they are being treated unfairly.
