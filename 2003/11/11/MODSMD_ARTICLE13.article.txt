## What makes a quake shake?

U-w- -w- y e learn geology the day

\/\/ Ralph Waldo Emer-
T T son so presciently said.
And if you count the couple of earth
quakes we have daily, I guess there's no
way around that.
But ever since I read the "How to Pro
tect Yourself in an Earthquake" guide in
my on-campus housing brochure, I've
wanted to, well, learn geology before the
earthquake — and by earthquake, I mean
the fabled "Big One" that concerns my
mother enough that she mentioned it be
fore a congratulations was uttered after I
received my acceptance letter to Stanford.
Don't live in denial. The Big One is on
its way, says Physics Prof. Greg Beroza.
I knew embarrassingly little about
fault lines and plate tectonics before my
chat with Prof. Beroza. but I pass on here
his crash course — a little earthquake 101
— to explain exactly why the earth shakes
on average a couple times a day in this
area, and when to expect the predicted
mother of all earthquakes.
If you know about the San Andreas
Fault, you understand that we live on the
intersection of two plates: the Pacific and
the North American plates. This intersec
tion creates a line of literally shaky
ground. There are dozens of fault lines in
the area, but the San Andreas Fault is
where most of the action happens and

where most of the damage will occur.
You can't stop plate tectonics; all of the
earth's plates are in constant motion. That
works out just fine for most of the world,
but the two plates we sit upon happen to be

moving in opposing
directions. That
means that every
thing looks just fine
on the surface, but
down a few layers
from terra firma,
there is a mighty rub
bing.
Friction, Beroza
told me, isn't good
for plates. One plate
is taking a dive under
another plate and

slowly deforming. The earth is therefore
absorbing a certain amount of stress at the
fault where one plate is moving and the
other is stuck. The friction between the
plates is what causes the daily rumblings
that are detected by sensitive geophysics
tools that are too complex for you and I to
ever understand.
Besides, most of us don't feel the little
shakings and as long as we don't feel it, it's
not that big a deal.
But, as you may imagine, plates are
large, and can only absorb so much stress
before hitting a yielding point, when the
fault "slips." The last time a fault slipped

in this area was 1906, when the streets of
San Francisco looked like great, shaking
blocks of Jell-O. The next big earthquake
was in 1989, but this wasn't a fault-slip
ping earthquake according to Beroza.
The good news is that after the fault
slips and all of the pent-up stress of con
stant friction is released, then the earth
starts from zero again. In other words, the
earthquake corrects the plate "traffic
jam," the tension is cleared and danger is
averted for another hundred years or so.
The bad news is that it's been a hun
dred years or so since the last time a fault
slipped. In other words, there is an enor
mous amount of earth-deforming tension
wound-up right under us.
Are these sensitive and expensive
geophysics tools able to predict when the
San Andreas Fault might be nearing max
imum density? Beroza says the tools
aren't that good yet, but he hazarded his
own guess.
"It'll be either tomorrow or a hundred
years from now, but another earthquake
of great magnitude is inescapable,"
Beroza said.
