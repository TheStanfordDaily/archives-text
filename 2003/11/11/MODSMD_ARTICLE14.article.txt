Readers criticize Singh's letter
Jagjit Singh begins his long anti-Is
rael diatribe claiming the photo of
Palestinians celebrating the deaths of
Americans is Israeli propaganda
("Readers criticize Campustruth.org
ads," Nov. 10). That is not propaganda
— unfortunately, it's true. He will have
to give up his own bit of propaganda,
however. Apparently, Mr. Singh
hasn't heard the news that the story the
Palestinians have been using for years
about the Israelis intentionally attack
ing the U.S.S. Liberty has been finally
laid to rest.
This summer, America's National
Security Agency confirmed that Israel's
sinking of the U.S.S. Liberty was an ac
cident. Documents newly released are
transcripts of conversations held by two
Israeli Air Force pilots caught and
recorded by an American spy plane that
confirms they were convinced they had
just bombed an Egyptian warship.
Florida Judge Jay Cristol said it best:
"It's the last piece of intelligence that re
mained classified, and every rational
person that will read it will understand
that there is no truth in these conspiracy
theories against Israel. But those who
hate Israel, who hate Jews and those
who believe in conspiracy, will not be
convinced by anything."
Alan Dershowitz just wrote a terrif
ic new book, "The Case For Israel"
that I highly recommend to anyone
who wants to understand more about
the Israeli / Palestinian conflict. Per
haps Mr. Singh will be gallant enough
to read it too.

I am writing in response to Jagjit
Sighn's letter to The Daily on Monday,
where he ostensibly criticizes the Cam
pustruth.org ads ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). At
first, it appears that the purpose of his
letter is to denounce the ads for demo
nizing the Palestinians and to support
his point. He poses the question of how
"Jewish groups would react if pictures"
of incidents involving Israelis were
shown. And yet, with harsh rhetoric, he
compromises his initial point by setting
out to do to the Israelis what he alleges
the ads do to the Palestinians. More
over, many of the points he makes are
disingenuous and completely erro
neous. Several of the false assertions are
discussed below.
Contrary to the author's presenta
tion of "fact," the U.S.S. Liberty inci
dent, which occurred during a war be
tween Israel and her neighbors, was an
unintentional accident, a conclusion
that was even reached by the body of
United States' official investigation into
the episode
The figure the author provides for
the amount of American tax dollars
given to the Israel is wholly inaccurate;
the real amount of aid given to Israel is
about one tenth the amount mentioned
in the letter. Any objective observer
would have noted the hundreds of mil
lions of dollars the United States has
given to the Palestinian Authority and
the United Nations body in charge of
the Palestinian refugee camps.
It is entirely false to allege, as the au
thor does, that Israel has been "waging a
war of terror" for the last 30 years; any
honest individual knowledgeable about
the last the 30 years in the Middle East
would dismiss such an uniformed asser
tion. It is also entirely false to allege that
Israel intentionally kills civilians and re
porters and tortures individuals. Israel
does much to prevent the deaths of in
nocent bystanders, sometimes risking
the lives of her soldiers to minimize such
tragedies. In fact, many human rights or
ganizations have criticized the Palestini
an's use of human shields that places
their own civilians in danger, a practice
that only hampers the efforts of Israeli
forces to avoid innocent causalities.
And the Supreme Court of Israel has
outlawed the practice of torture.
Lastly, the many U.N. resolutions
dealing with Israel that the author men

tions, unlike the resolutions dealing
with Iraq, are non-binding resolutions
and only call for a withdrawal from
Arab territories in the context of a com
prehensive peace treaty.
It is really disquieting that, instead of
attempting to criticize the Campus
truth.org ads, this inflammatory letter
exploits the discourse in The Daily,
much of which has been centered on the
need to provide an accurate portrayal of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to only
present a distorted view of the conflict.
Yet, the Campustruth.org ads, with all
of their faults, at least contain factual ac
curacy. Unfortunately, the same cannot
be said of the author's letter.
ADAM ISEN

Jagjit Singh's letter regarding the
Campustruth.org issue sadly lacked any
semblance of historical perspective
("Readers criticize Campustruth. Org
ads," Nov. 10). In a thinly veiled effort to
legitimize murderous Palestinian suicide
bombings, Mr. Singh attempts to draw
moral equivalency between the sides by
alluding to Israeli actions that have sup
posedly resulted in the deaths of Ameri
can citizens. Unfortunately, he forgets to
mention a few key facts. During the war
of 1967, a United States ship was indeed
attacked by Israeli planes off the coast of
Israel; however, recently declassified
NS A documents have proven once again
that the attack was purely accidental —
the result of battlefield confusion: The Is
raeli military believed that the ship was
Egyptian. To condemn Israel for these
deaths is equivalent to condemning the
United States for the hundreds of friend
ly fire deaths incurred in Iraq.
On the matter of Rachel Corrie, Mr.
Singh does not note that over 50 Amer
ican citizens have been killed by Pales
tinian terrorism in the past decade, in
cluding four murdered in the bombing
of the Hebrew University on Aug. 1,
2002 and threo diplomats killed in Gaza
last month. There is a big difference be
tween the death of Ms. Corrie — who
had purposefully entered a war-zone
and was working actively to disrupt le
gitimate military activities — and the
murder of dozens of innocent American
tourists, students and government
workers. And on the matter of foreign
aid, Mr. Singh conveniently omits the
fact that Egypt, Jordan and the Pales
tinian Authority also receive billions of
dollars from the United States annually.
Moreover, while Israel has used its for
eign aid money to defend itself, the
Palestinian Authority has funneled the
money into terrorist groups and into the
pocket of its leader, Yasser Arafat.
Mr. Singh employs a string of histor
ical omissions in order to mold the facts
to fit his political ideology. This pattern
is consistent with the efforts to censor
the Campustruth.org ads: It is so much
easier to shut out and ignore any infor
mation that weakens your political ar
guments than it is to face it and chal
lenge it intellectually. It is a fact that a
significant segment of the Palestinian
population was oveijoyed by the deaths
of 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11, 2001,
and no amount of cultural sensitivity can
wash this away. The urge to censor from
public discourse those facts that one
finds politically offensive is a sad tactic
indeed, and one that is antithetical to
our duty as citizens of a democracy.
I commend The Daily and its editors
for doing their part to defend free
speech on our campus.

Jagjit Singh's recent letter to the edi
tor contains factual errors about the
Arab Israeli wars that should be cor
rected to prevent the dissemination of
false information ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). First,
though, Singh failed to appreciate the
reason for the ad.
Even a cursory reading of the Arab
press in English reveals anti-Jewish dia
tribes and a climate of demonization of
Jews that has reached a crescendo. The
president of Syria lectures a silent Pope

about Jewish mistreatment of Christ;
the president of Malaysia talks about
Jewish world domination; Egyptian
television televises a depiction of an an
cient anti-Jewish canard; the heads of
Hamas daily plot the murders of inno
cent Jews and Arabs inside and outside
Israel, while "mega-terror" attacks are
thwarted just as frequently by the Israeli
military. Yet, not a "peep" is heard
about the above from Singh, Prof. Joel
Beinin, Prof. Khalidi of Columbia Uni
versity or the rest of the Middle East
Studies Association. The anti-Jewish
rhetoric is allowed; while the responses
are pilloried.
Yes, we hear pro forma denuncia
tions of "all" terror, but as some of these
pro forma statements come from terror
perpetrators themselves, they really
sound like Israel-bashing and blaming
the victim. Even Arafat condemns ter
ror, holding a match in one hand and a
fire extinguisher in the other. No one re
ally seems to care about the lost Jewish
lives. We hear the Holocaust was "a
long time ago." What? So are we going
to repeat it? Mr. Singh should ask, how
can Israel stop fighting terror when the
goal of the terror is to deprive Israel as a
state and Jews individually of their exis
tential rights? How can terrorism and
anti-terror efforts even be equated?
Regarding U.S. aid to Israel: Large
scale assistance began during the 1973
surprise attack by Egypt and Syria
against Israel on the Jewish holiest day
of Yom Kippur. Nixon's re-supply of
Israel before the Arab oil embargo
was both lonely, heroic and unpopular
in Europe. Sound familiar? It may
have saved Israel, and Jews remain
grateful.- U.S. aid was also given to
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestini
an Authority in response to their sub
sequent respective peace efforts. How
ever, Mr. Singh, can you state your
source for the figure "1.6 trillion dol
lars" of aid? That seems extraordinar
ily high, and likely untrue.
Regarding Israeli "atrocities," Is
raeli soldiers are taught strict engage
ment procedures that have prevented
many misfortunes. As above, many such
reports of so-called atrocities are manu
factured for a receptive audience but are
found to be untrue. Unfortunately,
Palestinians have hidden bombs and
terrorists inside emergency vehicles ne
cessitating Israeli searches and causing
hardship to the Palestinian people. Pres
ident Ronald Reagan got to ask Ameri
cans whether they were better or worse
off than they were four years earlier.
Palestinians have no such rights. Pales
tinian leaders are wealthy with large as
sets in Swiss accounts. Did that largesse
come from development aid money not
meant for their personal accounts? Are
the Palestinians mad at the right peo
ple? How many Palestinians have lost
their homes, land and livelihood be
cause of the cynical use of terror by
Palestinian leaders?
Moreover, how does a wrong per
ception justify retribution? What justi
fies the murder of a Holocaust survivor,
a bride, an emergency room doctor or a
young soldier? What justifies a mass
murder at a wedding or a Passover cele
bration? Why are the perpetrators still
at large? Why does the Palestinian lead
ership offer the delusion that these at
tacks have brought anything but catas
trophe on the rank and file?
Last, but not least, is the issue of
land. The discussion of pre-1967 borders
is extremely arbitrary. Before 1967, the
issue was the 1947 partition fines, and
before that, the issue was any line that
held any hope for Jewish sovereignty or
immigration. When the PLO was
formed in 1964, the Arabs held all the
land that is presently officially contest
ed. Since 1967, the West Bank and Gaza
have been offered repeatedly in negoti
ations. Yet the Palestinians refused to
offer to end the conflict in exchange for
land. "Truth" is not democratic, nor
written in ivory towers.
Sometimes, the truth hurts. I suspect
that is why Stanford is up in arms about
an advertisement.

about the above from Singh, Prof. Joel
Beinin, Prof. Khalidi of Columbia Uni
versity or the rest of the Middle East
Studies Association. The anti-Jewish
rhetoric is allowed; while the responses
are pilloried.
Yes, we hear pro forma denuncia
tions of "all" terror, but as some of these
pro forma statements come from terror
perpetrators themselves, they really
sound like Israel-bashing and blaming
the victim. Even Arafat condemns ter
ror, holding a match in one hand and a
fire extinguisher in the other. No one re
ally seems to care about the lost Jewish
lives. We hear the Holocaust was "a
long time ago." What? So are we going
to repeat it? Mr. Singh should ask, how
can Israel stop fighting terror when the
goal of the terror is to deprive Israel as a
state and Jews individually of their exis
tential rights? How can terrorism and
anti-terror efforts even be equated?
Regarding U.S. aid to Israel: Large
scale assistance began during the 1973
surprise attack by Egypt and Syria
against Israel on the Jewish holiest day
of Yom Kippur. Nixon's re-supply of
Israel before the Arab oil embargo
was both lonely, heroic and unpopular
in Europe. Sound familiar? It may
have saved Israel, and Jews remain
grateful.- U.S. aid was also given to
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestini
an Authority in response to their sub
sequent respective peace efforts. How
ever, Mr. Singh, can you state your
source for the figure "1.6 trillion dol
lars" of aid? That seems extraordinar
ily high, and likely untrue.
Regarding Israeli "atrocities," Is
raeli soldiers are taught strict engage
ment procedures that have prevented
many misfortunes. As above, many such
reports of so-called atrocities are manu
factured for a receptive audience but are
found to be untrue. Unfortunately,
Palestinians have hidden bombs and
terrorists inside emergency vehicles ne
cessitating Israeli searches and causing
hardship to the Palestinian people. Pres
ident Ronald Reagan got to ask Ameri
cans whether they were better or worse
off than they were four years earlier.
Palestinians have no such rights. Pales
tinian leaders are wealthy with large as
sets in Swiss accounts. Did that largesse
come from development aid money not
meant for their personal accounts? Are
the Palestinians mad at the right peo
ple? How many Palestinians have lost
their homes, land and livelihood be
cause of the cynical use of terror by
Palestinian leaders?
Moreover, how does a wrong per
ception justify retribution? What justi
fies the murder of a Holocaust survivor,
a bride, an emergency room doctor or a
young soldier? What justifies a mass
murder at a wedding or a Passover cele
bration? Why are the perpetrators still
at large? Why does the Palestinian lead
ership offer the delusion that these at
tacks have brought anything but catas
trophe on the rank and file?
Last, but not least, is the issue of
land. The discussion of pre-1967 borders
is extremely arbitrary. Before 1967, the
issue was the 1947 partition fines, and
before that, the issue was any line that
held any hope for Jewish sovereignty or
immigration. When the PLO was
formed in 1964, the Arabs held all the
land that is presently officially contest
ed. Since 1967, the West Bank and Gaza
have been offered repeatedly in negoti
ations. Yet the Palestinians refused to
offer to end the conflict in exchange for
land. "Truth" is not democratic, nor
written in ivory towers.
Sometimes, the truth hurts. I suspect
that is why Stanford is up in arms about
an advertisement.

I am writing in response to Jagjit
Sighn's letter to The Daily on Monday,
where he ostensibly criticizes the Cam
pustruth.org ads ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). At
first, it appears that the purpose of his
letter is to denounce the ads for demo
nizing the Palestinians and to support
his point. He poses the question of how
"Jewish groups would react if pictures"
of incidents involving Israelis were
shown. And yet, with harsh rhetoric, he
compromises his initial point by setting
out to do to the Israelis what he alleges
the ads do to the Palestinians. More
over, many of the points he makes are
disingenuous and completely erro
neous. Several of the false assertions are
discussed below.
Contrary to the author's presenta
tion of "fact," the U.S.S. Liberty inci
dent, which occurred during a war be
tween Israel and her neighbors, was an
unintentional accident, a conclusion
that was even reached by the body of
United States' official investigation into
the episode
The figure the author provides for
the amount of American tax dollars
given to the Israel is wholly inaccurate;
the real amount of aid given to Israel is
about one tenth the amount mentioned
in the letter. Any objective observer
would have noted the hundreds of mil
lions of dollars the United States has
given to the Palestinian Authority and
the United Nations body in charge of
the Palestinian refugee camps.
It is entirely false to allege, as the au
thor does, that Israel has been "waging a
war of terror" for the last 30 years; any
honest individual knowledgeable about
the last the 30 years in the Middle East
would dismiss such an uniformed asser
tion. It is also entirely false to allege that
Israel intentionally kills civilians and re
porters and tortures individuals. Israel
does much to prevent the deaths of in
nocent bystanders, sometimes risking
the lives of her soldiers to minimize such
tragedies. In fact, many human rights or
ganizations have criticized the Palestini
an's use of human shields that places
their own civilians in danger, a practice
that only hampers the efforts of Israeli
forces to avoid innocent causalities.
And the Supreme Court of Israel has
outlawed the practice of torture.
Lastly, the many U.N. resolutions
dealing with Israel that the author men

tions, unlike the resolutions dealing
with Iraq, are non-binding resolutions
and only call for a withdrawal from
Arab territories in the context of a com
prehensive peace treaty.
It is really disquieting that, instead of
attempting to criticize the Campus
truth.org ads, this inflammatory letter
exploits the discourse in The Daily,
much of which has been centered on the
need to provide an accurate portrayal of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to only
present a distorted view of the conflict.
Yet, the Campustruth.org ads, with all
of their faults, at least contain factual ac
curacy. Unfortunately, the same cannot
be said of the author's letter.
ADAM ISEN
Sophomore, Economics and Political Science
Jagjit Singh's letter regarding the
Campustruth.org issue sadly lacked any
semblance of historical perspective
("Readers criticize Campustruth. Org
ads," Nov. 10). In a thinly veiled effort to
legitimize murderous Palestinian suicide
bombings, Mr. Singh attempts to draw
moral equivalency between the sides by
alluding to Israeli actions that have sup
posedly resulted in the deaths of Ameri
can citizens. Unfortunately, he forgets to
mention a few key facts. During the war
of 1967, a United States ship was indeed
attacked by Israeli planes off the coast of
Israel; however, recently declassified
NS A documents have proven once again
that the attack was purely accidental —
the result of battlefield confusion: The Is
raeli military believed that the ship was
Egyptian. To condemn Israel for these
deaths is equivalent to condemning the
United States for the hundreds of friend
ly fire deaths incurred in Iraq.
On the matter of Rachel Corrie, Mr.
Singh does not note that over 50 Amer
ican citizens have been killed by Pales
tinian terrorism in the past decade, in
cluding four murdered in the bombing
of the Hebrew University on Aug. 1,
2002 and threo diplomats killed in Gaza
last month. There is a big difference be
tween the death of Ms. Corrie — who
had purposefully entered a war-zone
and was working actively to disrupt le
gitimate military activities — and the
murder of dozens of innocent American
tourists, students and government
workers. And on the matter of foreign
aid, Mr. Singh conveniently omits the
fact that Egypt, Jordan and the Pales
tinian Authority also receive billions of
dollars from the United States annually.
Moreover, while Israel has used its for
eign aid money to defend itself, the
Palestinian Authority has funneled the
money into terrorist groups and into the
pocket of its leader, Yasser Arafat.
Mr. Singh employs a string of histor
ical omissions in order to mold the facts
to fit his political ideology. This pattern
is consistent with the efforts to censor
the Campustruth.org ads: It is so much
easier to shut out and ignore any infor
mation that weakens your political ar
guments than it is to face it and chal
lenge it intellectually. It is a fact that a
significant segment of the Palestinian
population was oveijoyed by the deaths
of 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11, 2001,
and no amount of cultural sensitivity can
wash this away. The urge to censor from
public discourse those facts that one
finds politically offensive is a sad tactic
indeed, and one that is antithetical to
our duty as citizens of a democracy.
I commend The Daily and its editors
for doing their part to defend free
speech on our campus.

Jagjit Singh's recent letter to the edi
tor contains factual errors about the
Arab Israeli wars that should be cor
rected to prevent the dissemination of
false information ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). First,
though, Singh failed to appreciate the
reason for the ad.
Even a cursory reading of the Arab
press in English reveals anti-Jewish dia
tribes and a climate of demonization of
Jews that has reached a crescendo. The
president of Syria lectures a silent Pope

about Jewish mistreatment of Christ;
the president of Malaysia talks about
Jewish world domination; Egyptian
television televises a depiction of an an
cient anti-Jewish canard; the heads of
Hamas daily plot the murders of inno
cent Jews and Arabs inside and outside
Israel, while "mega-terror" attacks are
thwarted just as frequently by the Israeli
military. Yet, not a "peep" is heard
about the above from Singh, Prof. Joel
Beinin, Prof. Khalidi of Columbia Uni

Jagjit Singh's letter regarding the
Campustruth.org issue sadly lacked any
semblance of historical perspective
("Readers criticize Campustruth. Org
ads," Nov. 10). In a thinly veiled effort to
legitimize murderous Palestinian suicide
bombings, Mr. Singh attempts to draw
moral equivalency between the sides by
alluding to Israeli actions that have sup
posedly resulted in the deaths of Ameri
can citizens. Unfortunately, he forgets to
mention a few key facts. During the war
of 1967, a United States ship was indeed
attacked by Israeli planes off the coast of
Israel; however, recently declassified
NS A documents have proven once again
that the attack was purely accidental —
the result of battlefield confusion: The Is
raeli military believed that the ship was
Egyptian. To condemn Israel for these
deaths is equivalent to condemning the
United States for the hundreds of friend
ly fire deaths incurred in Iraq.
On the matter of Rachel Corrie, Mr.
Singh does not note that over 50 Amer
ican citizens have been killed by Pales
tinian terrorism in the past decade, in
cluding four murdered in the bombing
of the Hebrew University on Aug. 1,
2002 and threo diplomats killed in Gaza
last month. There is a big difference be
tween the death of Ms. Corrie — who
had purposefully entered a war-zone
and was working actively to disrupt le
gitimate military activities — and the
murder of dozens of innocent American
tourists, students and government
workers. And on the matter of foreign
aid, Mr. Singh conveniently omits the
fact that Egypt, Jordan and the Pales
tinian Authority also receive billions of
dollars from the United States annually.
Moreover, while Israel has used its for
eign aid money to defend itself, the
Palestinian Authority has funneled the
money into terrorist groups and into the
pocket of its leader, Yasser Arafat.
Mr. Singh employs a string of histor
ical omissions in order to mold the facts
to fit his political ideology. This pattern
is consistent with the efforts to censor
the Campustruth.org ads: It is so much
easier to shut out and ignore any infor
mation that weakens your political ar
guments than it is to face it and chal
lenge it intellectually. It is a fact that a
significant segment of the Palestinian
population was oveijoyed by the deaths
of 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11, 2001,
and no amount of cultural sensitivity can
wash this away. The urge to censor from
public discourse those facts that one
finds politically offensive is a sad tactic
indeed, and one that is antithetical to
our duty as citizens of a democracy.
I commend The Daily and its editors
for doing their part to defend free
speech on our campus.

Jagjit Singh's recent letter to the edi
tor contains factual errors about the
Arab Israeli wars that should be cor
rected to prevent the dissemination of
false information ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). First,
though, Singh failed to appreciate the
reason for the ad.
Even a cursory reading of the Arab
press in English reveals anti-Jewish dia
tribes and a climate of demonization of
Jews that has reached a crescendo. The
president of Syria lectures a silent Pope

about Jewish mistreatment of Christ;
the president of Malaysia talks about
Jewish world domination; Egyptian
television televises a depiction of an an
cient anti-Jewish canard; the heads of
Hamas daily plot the murders of inno
cent Jews and Arabs inside and outside
Israel, while "mega-terror" attacks are
thwarted just as frequently by the Israeli
military. Yet, not a "peep" is heard
about the above from Singh, Prof. Joel
Beinin, Prof. Khalidi of Columbia Uni
versity or the rest of the Middle East
Studies Association. The anti-Jewish
rhetoric is allowed; while the responses
are pilloried.
Yes, we hear pro forma denuncia
tions of "all" terror, but as some of these
pro forma statements come from terror
perpetrators themselves, they really
sound like Israel-bashing and blaming
the victim. Even Arafat condemns ter
ror, holding a match in one hand and a
fire extinguisher in the other. No one re
ally seems to care about the lost Jewish
lives. We hear the Holocaust was "a
long time ago." What? So are we going
to repeat it? Mr. Singh should ask, how
can Israel stop fighting terror when the
goal of the terror is to deprive Israel as a
state and Jews individually of their exis
tential rights? How can terrorism and
anti-terror efforts even be equated?
Regarding U.S. aid to Israel: Large
scale assistance began during the 1973
surprise attack by Egypt and Syria
against Israel on the Jewish holiest day
of Yom Kippur. Nixon's re-supply of
Israel before the Arab oil embargo
was both lonely, heroic and unpopular
in Europe. Sound familiar? It may
have saved Israel, and Jews remain
grateful.- U.S. aid was also given to
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and the Palestini
an Authority in response to their sub
sequent respective peace efforts. How
ever, Mr. Singh, can you state your
source for the figure "1.6 trillion dol
lars" of aid? That seems extraordinar
ily high, and likely untrue.
Regarding Israeli "atrocities," Is
raeli soldiers are taught strict engage
ment procedures that have prevented
many misfortunes. As above, many such
reports of so-called atrocities are manu
factured for a receptive audience but are
found to be untrue. Unfortunately,
Palestinians have hidden bombs and
terrorists inside emergency vehicles ne
cessitating Israeli searches and causing
hardship to the Palestinian people. Pres
ident Ronald Reagan got to ask Ameri
cans whether they were better or worse
off than they were four years earlier.
Palestinians have no such rights. Pales
tinian leaders are wealthy with large as
sets in Swiss accounts. Did that largesse
come from development aid money not
meant for their personal accounts? Are
the Palestinians mad at the right peo
ple? How many Palestinians have lost
their homes, land and livelihood be
cause of the cynical use of terror by
Palestinian leaders?
Moreover, how does a wrong per
ception justify retribution? What justi
fies the murder of a Holocaust survivor,
a bride, an emergency room doctor or a
young soldier? What justifies a mass
murder at a wedding or a Passover cele
bration? Why are the perpetrators still
at large? Why does the Palestinian lead
ership offer the delusion that these at
tacks have brought anything but catas
trophe on the rank and file?
Last, but not least, is the issue of
land. The discussion of pre-1967 borders
is extremely arbitrary. Before 1967, the
issue was the 1947 partition fines, and
before that, the issue was any line that
held any hope for Jewish sovereignty or
immigration. When the PLO was
formed in 1964, the Arabs held all the
land that is presently officially contest
ed. Since 1967, the West Bank and Gaza
have been offered repeatedly in negoti
ations. Yet the Palestinians refused to
offer to end the conflict in exchange for
land. "Truth" is not democratic, nor
written in ivory towers.
Sometimes, the truth hurts. I suspect
that is why Stanford is up in arms about
an advertisement.

Readers criticize Singh's letter
Jagjit Singh begins his long anti-Is
rael diatribe claiming the photo of
Palestinians celebrating the deaths of
Americans is Israeli propaganda
("Readers criticize Campustruth.org
ads," Nov. 10). That is not propaganda
— unfortunately, it's true. He will have
to give up his own bit of propaganda,
however. Apparently, Mr. Singh
hasn't heard the news that the story the
Palestinians have been using for years
about the Israelis intentionally attack
ing the U.S.S. Liberty has been finally
laid to rest.
This summer, America's National
Security Agency confirmed that Israel's
sinking of the U.S.S. Liberty was an ac
cident. Documents newly released are
transcripts of conversations held by two
Israeli Air Force pilots caught and
recorded by an American spy plane that
confirms they were convinced they had
just bombed an Egyptian warship.
Florida Judge Jay Cristol said it best:
"It's the last piece of intelligence that re
mained classified, and every rational
person that will read it will understand
that there is no truth in these conspiracy
theories against Israel. But those who
hate Israel, who hate Jews and those
who believe in conspiracy, will not be
convinced by anything."
Alan Dershowitz just wrote a terrif
ic new book, "The Case For Israel"
that I highly recommend to anyone
who wants to understand more about
the Israeli / Palestinian conflict. Per
haps Mr. Singh will be gallant enough
to read it too.
SHEREEROTH
Palo Alto, Calif.
I am writing in response to Jagjit
Sighn's letter to The Daily on Monday,
where he ostensibly criticizes the Cam
pustruth.org ads ("Readers criticize
Campustruth.org ads," Nov. 10). At
first, it appears that the purpose of his
letter is to denounce the ads for demo
nizing the Palestinians and to support
his point. He poses the question of how
"Jewish groups would react if pictures"
of incidents involving Israelis were
shown. And yet, with harsh rhetoric, he
compromises his initial point by setting
out to do to the Israelis what he alleges
the ads do to the Palestinians. More
over, many of the points he makes are
disingenuous and completely erro
neous. Several of the false assertions are
discussed below.
Contrary to the author's presenta
tion of "fact," the U.S.S. Liberty inci
dent, which occurred during a war be
tween Israel and her neighbors, was an
unintentional accident, a conclusion
that was even reached by the body of
United States' official investigation into
the episode
The figure the author provides for
the amount of American tax dollars
given to the Israel is wholly inaccurate;
the real amount of aid given to Israel is
about one tenth the amount mentioned
in the letter. Any objective observer
would have noted the hundreds of mil
lions of dollars the United States has
given to the Palestinian Authority and
the United Nations body in charge of
the Palestinian refugee camps.
It is entirely false to allege, as the au
thor does, that Israel has been "waging a
war of terror" for the last 30 years; any
honest individual knowledgeable about
the last the 30 years in the Middle East
would dismiss such an uniformed asser
tion. It is also entirely false to allege that
Israel intentionally kills civilians and re
porters and tortures individuals. Israel
does much to prevent the deaths of in
nocent bystanders, sometimes risking
the lives of her soldiers to minimize such
tragedies. In fact, many human rights or
ganizations have criticized the Palestini
an's use of human shields that places
their own civilians in danger, a practice
that only hampers the efforts of Israeli
forces to avoid innocent causalities.
And the Supreme Court of Israel has
outlawed the practice of torture.
Lastly, the many U.N. resolutions
dealing with Israel that the author men

tions, unlike the resolutions dealing
with Iraq, are non-binding resolutions
and only call for a withdrawal from
Arab territories in the context of a com
prehensive peace treaty.
It is really disquieting that, instead of
attempting to criticize the Campus
truth.org ads, this inflammatory letter
exploits the discourse in The Daily,
much of which has been centered on the
need to provide an accurate portrayal of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to only
present a distorted view of the conflict.
Yet, the Campustruth.org ads, with all
of their faults, at least contain factual ac
curacy. Unfortunately, the same cannot
be said of the author's letter.
