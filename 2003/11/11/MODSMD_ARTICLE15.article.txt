# THE
						BOTTOM LINE
## Public should see behind Lynch story 
### 
Students and faculty show up every
day at Stanford hoping to become
leaders in society. Many succeed.
But when was the last time you re
ceived an "A" just for showing up to class?
How many times have you received high
honors for doing the bare minimum?
The NBC broadcast of "Saving Jessi
ca Lynch" on Sunday night and the cov
erage surrounding her rescue have even
Jessica Lynch asking similar questions.
Why should she receive the Bronze Star
and the Purple Heart for simply surviv
ing? Soldiers who have fought bravely in
many wars have returned home with
more serious physical injuries and psy
chological trauma — and far less fanfare.
Despite media coverage exposing the
truth about Lynch's rescue, the Bush ad
ministration continues to use this story to
bolster support for a war that supposedly
ended months ago. Making Jessica
Lynch a hero not only perpetuates the
perceived favoritism toward women that
is endemic to the military, it undermines
the success of women in general. It cre
ates the impression that women only
have to do the minimum to be rewarded.
In the military, women must excel in
mental and physical evaluations. This

means competing and being compared
with men who often appear to be physi-

cally stronger. Most
women are keenly
aware that they
have to do far more
than the minimum
to be considered
equal to their male
counterparts. In
deed, women must
surpass men to be
considered average
and accepted by
their peers.
When the Bush

administration chose Jessica Lynch, it did
not think about what defines heroism or
the ramifications of awarding honors nor
mally reserved for valor in combat to an
average soldier. It was concerned only
with approval ratings. No one would ever
re-elect a president who left a female sol
dier in the hands of the Iraqis.
Lynch's protests — including her ac
cusation that Bush's team "used" her to
increase domestic support for the war —
indicate that she understands the honor
and prestige associated with receiving the
Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

Knowing that the attention she has re
ceived has little to do with her actions, she
is riding out the wave of propaganda.
Still, Lynch does not seem to mind the
spotlight or her $1 million-dollar book
deal. Her behavior certainly does not dis
courage the Bush administration's ex
ploitation of the situation. On the con
trary, it further encourages resentment
between men and women because al
though she gives credit to the real hero
who saved her life, she has not shied away
from the limelight or offered to share the
fame with him.
It would be easy to demonize Lynch,
but that does not seem fair. She is not to
blame although she is not simply a victim.
It would be even easier to demonize the
Bush administration. After all, they are
just politicians.
But the problem is not the exploita
tion of a soldier by a ruthless government.
Resolution to this dilemma can only be
found in the hope that the American pub
lic sees the reality of the situation.
