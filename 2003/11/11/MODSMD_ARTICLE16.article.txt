## What a president should be made of: Kucinich is the right man for the job 
### ILIAS CHRISSOCHOIDIS 
In the Aurora Forum "American Presi
dency: Character and Crisis" of Oct. 28,
History Prof. David Kennedy distilled a
successful U.S. presidency into three ingre
dients: clarity of conviction, clarity of vi
sion and clarity of communication. Fate or
luck, the very next Aurora Forum on Nov.
8 featured a man who embodies all three,
Dennis John Kucinich. He also happens to
be courting the highest office in the coun
try.
I have heard U.S. Representative
Kucinich speak before. But for some reason
(venue may well be one) his extempore talk
last Saturday forced me to engage with
Kennedy's triptych of presidential greatness.
By clarity of conviction, Kennedy under
stands a president's self-awareness, who he

really is. Kucinich is remarkably aware of his
origins, humble as those of Lincoln. Still
more aware is he of the fate of the just and
righteous: The very act that terminated his
early political career (blocking the corporate
takeover of Cleveland's municipal electrici
ty) brought him back to life in the 1990s.
Kucinich is a public servant who understands
the meaning of both words: "Public" em
braces all Americans, citizens and immi
grants alike; and "servant" acknowledges the
priority of common good over one's private
interest.
Clarity of vision is for Kennedy the
ability of a president to know where ex
actly he stands in time, at what juncture in
the history of his nation and the world.
Kucinich regularly invokes the Founding
Fathers. He sees clearly that America has
tragically deviated from the principles on

which it was founded more than 200 years
ago. He never fails to mention Lincoln
and Franklin Roosevelt as leaders who
took the helm at times when the nation
was falling apart and with their vision and
will power turned the boat away from dis
aster.
America is treading once again a danger
ous path. Instead of equality, we see an in
come disparity that brings us to the door of
third world countries. A few percent of the
population devise schemes to transfer even
more wealth in their hands, constantly push
ing hundreds of millions of their fellow citi
zens to despair and social dysfunction. In
stead of justice, we see increasing masses
being refused provisions that earn for a na
tion the term "civilized." And instead of fra
ternity, we witness arrogant isolationists
whose understanding of international diplo

macy has remained at the level of high school
bullying.
Kucinich not only raises these troubling
issues, but he offers clear and honest propos
als for escaping the impending crisis. And he
does that with a rare sense of magnanimity.
Time and again, he has been solicited for
promises of impeaching the current president
over the invasion of Iraq.
Time and again, Kucinich has refused to
do so. Instead, he emphasizes the need for
healing and reconciliation and for a national
dialogue that will help bring closure to the
trauma of 9 /11.
Kennedy's third ingredient is clarity of
communication. My impression from
Kucinich is that he will leave his mark on any
stage. He has a prodigious ability to switch
from spiritual gravity to the exuberance of
the one who knows the way. He can touch

every heart because he has nothing to hide,
really.
One of the cornerstones of his campaign
is the transformative power within each one
of us. By inviting his audiences to tap their
own deeper self, he gives them hope,
courage and brings back to politics people
from all walks of life. All great traditions tell
us that the human spirit is immortal and in
exhaustible. To the extent that Kucinich taps
on the spiritual reservoir of America, he is
vouchsafed the leadership of the nation.
Whether this will happen in 2004 or later no
one can say. But one thing is sure: Dennis
John Kucinich has the stuff that a great pres
ident maketh.
