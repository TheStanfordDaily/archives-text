## Spencer's guide to frat party apparel 
### 
I have been keeping this in for so long, it's
started to give me blue balls. I'm sorry, but
if I see another faux-trucker Von Dutch
hat, I swear I'm going to explode. And this
will be a painful, violent, but at the same time,
wholly necessary explosion — much like the gas
you pass as you leave your girlfriend's room on
Sunday morning, hair a mess, testicles throb
bing and anus bleeding.
I need a new girlfriend.
But I'm not kidding, the Von Dutch thing has
got to go. Maybe this is my Marin County hippi
ness talking, but there is no reason why you
should shell out 45 bucks for a hat (not even fit
ted — another tragedy) that Billie-Jo and Joe-
Bob have been rocking for the past 40 years at
$4.95 a pop.
But you see, this Von Dutch phenomenon is
similar to something else that irks me from time
to time — sports gear worn at parties. While the
Von Dutch hat is absolutely abhorrent, it is only

the wearer of the hat that is
embarrassing himself. But
when an overweight, uncoor
dinated failure-at-life who is
paler than the paper he prints
his problem sets on shows up
at Kappa Sigma wearing a
throwback Bird jersey, talk
ing about nothing but why he
is so much more mature than
"frat guys," he is destroying
Bird's reputation along with

his own. And it kills me. Kills me!
So hear me out, and let me rant about this,
because there are some tried-and-true do's and
dont's about wearing sports gear at a party.
DO: Wear jerseys of players you feel pas
sionately about. Want Pete Rose in the Hall?
Want Dante Hall as the MVP? Then represent
them well and make your case.
DON'T: Wear the gear unless you know ev
erything about the player and team you are rep
resenting. I cannot stress this enough. Too
many times I have started a conversation with
some guy wearing a soccer or basketball jersey,
only to have them not know the player on their
back, much less the team they are representing.
Only one man in the world is not mandated
to know his team or players, and you aren't
Rickey Henderson.
On a related note, if you see someone wear
ing some gear, don't pretend you know what
they're wearing unless you actually know. True
story: two girls come into my room this weekend
(editor's note: a rarity for Spencer), notice a
handwritten sign professing Steve "Who's
Rick?" Myrick's love for Nomar, only to ask,
"What's Nomar's first name? I always forget be
cause he's a pitcher."
Honest to God, that's what she said. How
was I supposed to respond to that? "Umm,
Nomar IS his first name, he's a SHORTSTOP,
and you're...a moron?"
The point is, it puts all people involved into
an awkward situation. It's like when your TA
makes you summarize the reading and everyone
in the building knows you haven't done it. The
TA feels bad, the kid next to you squirms in his
seat, kids across the table look away, trying to
avoid eye contact — it's just a bad move.
DO: Wear jerseys of underrepresented ath
letes. I will forever love someone if they wear a
John Olerud jersey, a Steve Kerr uni or maybe a
Will Clark throwback.
DON'T: Put your name on the back of a
team's jersey. It is possibly the most toolish
thing you could ever do to yourself. You buy a
nice SF Giants jersey for 80 bucks, only to print
"Januszicz" on the back, rendering it totally un
pronounceable and utterly confusing to every
one else in the world. Way to go.
Finally — and this is one I've struggled with
all year — I'll say MAYBE: Wear your varsity
warm-up gear to a party. A frequent staple of
the men's basketball, tennis, water polo, foot
ball and baseball teams (soccer of course ex
cluded), I can't go by a single dance floor with
out walking through and seeing Nike embla
zoned on six guys who obviously won the genet
ic lottery: 6-foot-5, 230 lbs. and Abercrombie
features.
Now, back when I was a regular student, I
hated this. I hated what the varsity athlete could
pull, this whole Nike thing. And don't get me
wrong, I had Nike clothes of my own, but my
generic Nike tees just didn't get the girls as well
as those sweet red jackets. So out of jealousy, I
hated it. I hated every Nike shirt, Nike shorts,
Nike shoes, even the Nike socks. And while I
have been told that I have a striking resem
blance to Punky Brewster, I was no match for
models advertising their supreme sperm donat
ing abilities to the greater part of the Theta Delt
dance floor.
One day, water polo. One day, I'll take you
down. You and your chlorine-bleached hair,
board shorts and general "This is how we do
things in the OC, bitch!" mentality. And you'll
be left wondering how Punky Brewster and
crew got the better of you. Nothing physical, no
fighting, nothing like that. It will be something
where all you guys look around and realize that
I may as well be Keanu Reeves, because I am
The One. One day.
And when that day comes, oh and it will
come, I can only hope, for your sake, that you
guys aren't wearing Von Dutch hats.

Honest to God, that's what she said. How
was I supposed to respond to that? "Umm,
Nomar IS his first name, he's a SHORTSTOP,
and you're...a moron?"
The point is, it puts all people involved into
an awkward situation. It's like when your TA
makes you summarize the reading and everyone
in the building knows you haven't done it. The
TA feels bad, the kid next to you squirms in his
seat, kids across the table look away, trying to
avoid eye contact — it's just a bad move.
DO: Wear jerseys of underrepresented ath
letes. I will forever love someone if they wear a
John Olerud jersey, a Steve Kerr uni or maybe a
Will Clark throwback.
DON'T: Put your name on the back of a
team's jersey. It is possibly the most toolish
thing you could ever do to yourself. You buy a
nice SF Giants jersey for 80 bucks, only to print
"Januszicz" on the back, rendering it totally un
pronounceable and utterly confusing to every
one else in the world. Way to go.
Finally — and this is one I've struggled with
all year — I'll say MAYBE: Wear your varsity
warm-up gear to a party. A frequent staple of
the men's basketball, tennis, water polo, foot
ball and baseball teams (soccer of course ex
cluded), I can't go by a single dance floor with
out walking through and seeing Nike embla
zoned on six guys who obviously won the genet
ic lottery: 6-foot-5, 230 lbs. and Abercrombie
features.
Now, back when I was a regular student, I
hated this. I hated what the varsity athlete could
pull, this whole Nike thing. And don't get me
wrong, I had Nike clothes of my own, but my
generic Nike tees just didn't get the girls as well
as those sweet red jackets. So out of jealousy, I
hated it. I hated every Nike shirt, Nike shorts,
Nike shoes, even the Nike socks. And while I
have been told that I have a striking resem
blance to Punky Brewster, I was no match for
models advertising their supreme sperm donat
ing abilities to the greater part of the Theta Delt
dance floor.
One day, water polo. One day, I'll take you
down. You and your chlorine-bleached hair,
board shorts and general "This is how we do
things in the OC, bitch!" mentality. And you'll
be left wondering how Punky Brewster and
crew got the better of you. Nothing physical, no
fighting, nothing like that. It will be something
where all you guys look around and realize that
I may as well be Keanu Reeves, because I am
The One. One day.
And when that day comes, oh and it will
come, I can only hope, for your sake, that you
guys aren't wearing Von Dutch hats.

I have been keeping this in for so long, it's
started to give me blue balls. I'm sorry, but
if I see another faux-trucker Von Dutch
hat, I swear I'm going to explode. And this
will be a painful, violent, but at the same time,
wholly necessary explosion — much like the gas
you pass as you leave your girlfriend's room on
Sunday morning, hair a mess, testicles throb
bing and anus bleeding.
I need a new girlfriend.
But I'm not kidding, the Von Dutch thing has
got to go. Maybe this is my Marin County hippi
ness talking, but there is no reason why you
should shell out 45 bucks for a hat (not even fit
ted — another tragedy) that Billie-Jo and Joe-
Bob have been rocking for the past 40 years at
$4.95 a pop.
But you see, this Von Dutch phenomenon is
similar to something else that irks me from time
to time — sports gear worn at parties. While the
Von Dutch hat is absolutely abhorrent, it is only

the wearer of the hat that is
embarrassing himself. But
when an overweight, uncoor
dinated failure-at-life who is
paler than the paper he prints
his problem sets on shows up
at Kappa Sigma wearing a
throwback Bird jersey, talk
ing about nothing but why he
is so much more mature than
"frat guys," he is destroying
Bird's reputation along with

his own. And it kills me. Kills me!
So hear me out, and let me rant about this,
because there are some tried-and-true do's and
dont's about wearing sports gear at a party.
DO: Wear jerseys of players you feel pas
sionately about. Want Pete Rose in the Hall?
Want Dante Hall as the MVP? Then represent
them well and make your case.
DON'T: Wear the gear unless you know ev
erything about the player and team you are rep
resenting. I cannot stress this enough. Too
many times I have started a conversation with
some guy wearing a soccer or basketball jersey,
only to have them not know the player on their
back, much less the team they are representing.
Only one man in the world is not mandated
to know his team or players, and you aren't
Rickey Henderson.
On a related note, if you see someone wear
ing some gear, don't pretend you know what
they're wearing unless you actually know. True
story: two girls come into my room this weekend
(editor's note: a rarity for Spencer), notice a
handwritten sign professing Steve "Who's
Rick?" Myrick's love for Nomar, only to ask,
"What's Nomar's first name? I always forget be
cause he's a pitcher."
Honest to God, that's what she said. How
was I supposed to respond to that? "Umm,
Nomar IS his first name, he's a SHORTSTOP,
and you're...a moron?"
