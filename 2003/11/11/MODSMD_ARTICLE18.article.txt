# Cardinal avenges loss to Cal
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS 
Behind a strong effort by junior
outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani,
the Stanford women's volleyball
team cruised to an easy 3-1 victory
over cross-bay rival California last
Friday night at Maples Pavilion, a
site where the Bears have not won
since 1979.
The Cardinal win avenged a
heartbreaking five-game loss to
the Bears in Berkeley earlier in the
season.
With the victory, Stanford's sea
son record improved to 18-5 over
all, with an 11-3 mark in the Pacific
10 Conference. The Bears dropped
to 19-4 overall and 10-4 in the Pac
10.
More importantly, however, the
win pushed Stanford into sole pos
session of second place in the Pac
10, as it moved a full game ahead of
Cal and a half game ahead of
UCLA, which has the same num
ber of wins but one more loss than
the Cardinal.
Stanford opened the match
with a 30-25 Game 1 victory, a feat
the team has struggled to acheive
throughout the season. Nnamani
led the way with eight kills, and
the Cardinal combined to come up
with eight team blocks, four of
which came from freshman out
side hitter Kristin Richards. The
key to the Game 1 win, though, lay
in the fact that the Cardinal held
the Bears to a -.021 attack per
centage.
Game 2 was controlled by the
Bears, who came storming back for
a 30-23 victory, holding the Cardi
nal to a .125 attack percentage
while hitting .378 themselves. Cali
fornia outside hitter Alicia Powers
netted six kills.
In a slightly tighter Game 3,

Stanford was able to pull out a
victory, 30-26. The Cardinal
added four more team blocks and
senior middle blocker Sara Dukes
had three on her own. Nnamani
had five more kills, bringing her
match total to 19 through three
games.
Game 4 proved to be the deci
sive one, as the Cardinal poured it
on to down the Bears 30-19, and
take the match 3-1. Stanford had a
hitting percentage well above .300
as a team, and Nnamani added
seven more kills to bring her total
to a match-high 26.
Nnamani's efforts netted her
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors,
the second time in her career she
has garnered this award. Although
it was the 49th time a Stanford
player has won the honor, surpris
ingly, it was the first time a Cardi
nal player was named Player of the
Week this season.
Other notable efforts for the
Cardinal came from Richards, who
finished strong after a slow start
with 13 kills and 12 digs. Dukes had
a team high six blocks, and senior
middle blocker Jennifer Harvey,
playing on her birthday, chipped in
with eight kills and five blocks. Ju
nior outside hitter Jennifer Hucke
led all players with three service
aces, despite not going with her
patented jump serve.
The Cardinal's next match
comes this Thursday against
UCLA, when the two teams will
battle for second place in the Pac
10. The Cardinal then has a match
Friday night against top-ranked
USC, which is seeking to clinch
the Pac-10 title with a win this
weekend.
Both matches can be heard on
KZSU 90.1 FM, beginning at 6:45
p.m. Thursday night.
