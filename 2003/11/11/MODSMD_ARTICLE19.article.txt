# Field hockey5s season ends at NorPacs
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the final game of the season was any indication, one
might say that the Stanford field hockey team (6-13, 2-4
Northern Pacific Conference) did not want its season
come to an end. The Cardinal stayed on the field for as
long as it could, extending its final game against Southwest
Missouri State into overtime.
And when one overtime period wasn't enough, the
Cardinal extended its season into double overtime.
Hoping to end the season on a high note, the Cardinal
came out and played hard to the very end, its effort paying
off with a 2-1 season-ending victory over SMS.
Stanford came into last week's NorPac Championships
with a lot of confidence. Needing three victories to clinch
a spot in an NCAA Tournament play-in game, Stanford
took the first step toward that goal with 2-1 overtime vic
tory over Appalachian State (12-8).

The Cardinal then had to face dreaded rival No. 20 Cal
ifornia (12-3) in Friday's semifinal. The now-three-time
defending NorPac champion Bears beat Stanford 3-0 on
their way to the NorPac title.
The loss prevented Stanford from reaching the NorPac
final for the first time in its six-year history and prevented
the Cardinal from reaching the NCAA Tournament.
Fortunately, the Cardinal was able to rebound from
that loss as senior forward Noor Dawood scored the
game-winning goal in her final game to give the Cardinal
a third-place finish in the tournament.
Overall, the NorPac tournament was a pleasant sur
prise for Stanford, which did not fare very well in the reg
ular season.
The Cardinal's season started out modestly, with two
wins after an opening-day loss. But the Cardinal had trou
ble after that, going on a season-high five-game losing
skid.
There were many games in which Stanford had a

chance to close out with a victory but could not capitalize.
In retrospect, the Cardinal players felt the main reason
they lost so many games rested on their shoulders.
"When we didn't fare well against teams that were nec
essarily 'better' than us, it's not because we lacked the skill
or ability," Dawood said. "It was because we lacked the
confidence and the belief that we were capable of beating
them."
Stanford did, at times, show its potential. The Cardinal
had a 4-2 win over Pacific in which it showed improve
ment. The Cardinal then dominated the Bearcats in one of
its final games. Stanford recorded its only shutout of the
season and had an offensive outburst in a 6-0 win.
Stanford had a tough time on the road this season â€”
where most of its matches took place. Stanford finished
the season 1-9 away from the Farm and was also shutout a
total of five times.
