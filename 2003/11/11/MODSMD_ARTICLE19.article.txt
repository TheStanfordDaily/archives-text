# Field hockey5s season ends at NorPacs
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the final game of the season was any indication, one
might say that the Stanford field hockey team (6-13, 2-4
Northern Pacific Conference) did not want its season
come to an end. The Cardinal stayed on the field for as
long as it could, extending its final game against Southwest
Missouri State into overtime.
And when one overtime period wasn't enough, the
Cardinal extended its season into double overtime.
Hoping to end the season on a high note, the Cardinal
came out and played hard to the very end, its effort paying
off with a 2-1 season-ending victory over SMS.
Stanford came into last week's NorPac Championships
with a lot of confidence. Needing three victories to clinch
a spot in an NCAA Tournament play-in game, Stanford
took the first step toward that goal with 2-1 overtime vic
tory over Appalachian State (12-8).

The Cardinal then had to face dreaded rival No. 20 Cal
ifornia (12-3) in Friday's semifinal. The now-three-time
defending NorPac champion Bears beat Stanford 3-0 on
their way to the NorPac title.
The loss prevented Stanford from reaching the NorPac
final for the first time in its six-year history and prevented
the Cardinal from reaching the NCAA Tournament.
Fortunately, the Cardinal was able to rebound from
that loss as senior forward Noor Dawood scored the
game-winning goal in her final game to give the Cardinal
a third-place finish in the tournament.
Overall, the NorPac tournament was a pleasant sur
prise for Stanford, which did not fare very well in the reg
ular season.
The Cardinal's season started out modestly, with two
wins after an opening-day loss. But the Cardinal had trou
ble after that, going on a season-high five-game losing
skid.
There were many games in which Stanford had a

chance to close out with a victory but could not capitalize.
In retrospect, the Cardinal players felt the main reason
they lost so many games rested on their shoulders.
"When we didn't fare well against teams that were nec
essarily 'better' than us, it's not because we lacked the skill
or ability," Dawood said. "It was because we lacked the
confidence and the belief that we were capable of beating
them."
Stanford did, at times, show its potential. The Cardinal
had a 4-2 win over Pacific in which it showed improve
ment. The Cardinal then dominated the Bearcats in one of
its final games. Stanford recorded its only shutout of the
season and had an offensive outburst in a 6-0 win.
Stanford had a tough time on the road this season —
where most of its matches took place. Stanford finished
the season 1-9 away from the Farm and was also shutout a
total of five times.
Another theory on why the Car
dinal lost so many games was its in
ability to put everything together.
"Our weakness this year was
playing well when people had off
days," said sophomore forward Lyn
dsay Erickson.
But even when things would seem
to come together, Stanford still had
to endure its tough schedule. More
than three-fourths of its opponents
were either ranked in the top 20 in
national polls or had strong winning
records, including No. 6 Michigan
State (13-4) and No. 10 Connecticut
(15-4).
Despite the many tough times the
Cardinal faced, some players still

managed to shine.
Freshman forward Cara-Lynn
Lopresti exploded onto the scene
with her quick moves and ability to
capitalize on scoring opportunities.
Lopresti wowed everyone as she
scored on her first shot in a Cardinal
uniform. She was named NorPac
Rookie of the Week twice — for
the first week and the last week of
the season. Lopresti rounded out
the regular season with a team lead
ing eight goals, six assists and 22
points.
Erickson had a breakout year as
she scored six goals and collected
three assists for 15 points. Senior
goalkeeper Emily Zander picked up
a career-high 24 saves this season
against Old Dominion (13-9).
Dawood, a co-captain, continued
to demonstrate her importance to
the team through leadership off and
on the field. She scored the game

winning goal for her team twice, in
cluding a goal with just one second
left against Virginia Commonwealth
(9-6).
Starting out with a team that had
only four returning seniors was a dif
ficult task. The team, which was
comprised mostly of freshmen and
sophomores, had a lot of ability and
potential from the start, as the roster
included members of the National
Under-20 and Junior Olympics
teams.
The biggest task might have been
getting to know each other better on
and off the field. It did come a long
way over the season.
"We were a young team in terms
of getting to understand how ev
erybody played," said head coach
Lesley Irvine. "[Our biggest im
provement] was the way [we] con
nected and became a unit. I think it
took a lot."
