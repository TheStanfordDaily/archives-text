# Remodeled Tresidder opens today
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Five months after work began on the
$1.4 million update to the Tresidder din
ing facility, Subway and Peet's Coffee
open to the public this morning ready to
serve subs, soups, lattes and teas.
The revamped area features the two
franchise operations as well as wireless In
ternet connection, two 40-inch ISIS an
nouncement panels, three iMac comput
ers and an offset multi-purpose section
with three plasma TV screens. In addition,
the open area with seating for 295 people
will provide ample room for parties and
other events.
The space, designed by Helena Vincent
and Chris Wasney, a Stanford alumnus,
both of CAW Architects, is the first of two
phases in the Tresidder project. Construc
tion crews are still working on the back
kitchen area and the food court concept,
which are scheduled for completion in De
cember.
Stanford Dining oversees both Subway
and Peet's, and it sponsored a preview
party yesterday. Smiling employees
served sandwiches to guests as crews re
moved the last of the white paper from the
windows, allowing sunlight to flood into
the building for the first time since June.
Tan Gao, a graduate students in elec
trical engineering, walked by Tresidder
yesterday afternoon and noticed that Sub
way was serving sandwiches. Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stanford Din
ing, invited him inside where Gao enjoyed
a foot-long sub, chips and a soda.
"I heard at the beginning of the quarter
that they were going to have a Subway, but
I didn't know when it was opening," Gao
said with a grin, in between bites. "I give it
a big thumbs up, and I will absolutely be
eating here often."
Dining helped to initiate the renova
tion with the goal of creating a central
space for students to meet with each other.
"One of the things we wanted to do
with this building was to give students a
place to put on programming," Siddiqui,
said. "We want bands and groups to use
this space to perform, and we want stu

dents to really be able to relax and enjoy
the space."
The Tresidder Dining Advisory Group
met weekly throughout the process, and
according to Amanda Gotthold, director
of retail, the team was pivotal in making
the project a success.
"The group brought amazing ideas, en
ergy and enthusiasm to the concept," Got
thold said. "In developing Tresidder, we
were working to make the facility appeal
ing to a constantly changing group of stu

dents, faculty and staff."
Hours are 8 a.m. until 2 a.m. Monday
through Friday. Subway will close at 8 p.m.
daily, but Peet's Coffee will brew bever
ages until 2 a.m. Both vendors will accept
Cardinal points and Cardinal dollars. Ini
tially, the facility will not be open on Sat
urday or Sunday, but weekend hours are a
possibility should students express inter
est, said Eric Montell, associate director of
executive catering, concession and retail
services.

Stanford Dining operated a food tent
outside of Tresidder during the summer
while the main dining area was closed for
construction. In addition, Dining also
added about 25 new employees to staff
Subway and Peet's. The Stanford Man
agement Company, Residential and Din
ing Enterprises and vendors financed the
project. According to Siddiqiii, the transi
tion from Bon Appetit to Stanford Dining
in June went smoothly, with crews work
ing ever since to reopen the dining facility
