# Men's water polo takes two
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
In another stellar weekend of water polo, the No. 3
Cardinal (16-3, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) garnered two more league victories. Trampling
No. 13 Pacific 17-4 and caging No. 2 Cal 10-8 in back-to
back away games, the men proved they have indeed hit
their stride.
Seven different Cardinal players scored in Satur
day's shutout of the Tigers in Fresno. Junior driver
Tony Azevedo added another five goals to his season
total, scoring two goals each in the first and second pe
riods. Stanford led the Tigers 9-1 at the half.
Junior two-meter Greg Crum and senior utility
Mike Derse added three goals each in the onslaught
and goalies sophomore Chad Taylor and freshman
Beau Stockstill had four and five saves, respectively.
Stanford notched three goals in the third period and
five in the fourth period to bring the blowout to a close
at 17-4.
"The score shows that Pacific is kind of having an off
year," Crum said. "They'll be back next year for sure
though."
Stockstill saw the score as an indicator of how im
mense the scoring potential is throughout the Cardinal
bench.
"I think the game against Pacific, especially with
[the] win over Cal, just shows how much firepower we
have," Stockstill said. "There is no single person who
makes or breaks our team. We are strong up and down
the whole roster."
The Cardinal went up against a much tougher oppo
nent in its Sunday game. Stanford battled its cross-bay
rivals before a sellout crowd of 1,120 at the Spieker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley.
"It's always tough going to Berkeley and playing Cal
at their place," said sophomore driver Peter Varellas.
"They always get huge, loud crowds and they are right
on top of you in the pool."
Stockstill found the game to be an electrifying experience.

Sophomore driver Thomas opkins and the Stanford men's water polo team defeated UC-lrvine 17-4 before beating
California 10-8 this weekend.
"Cat's facilities were packed with
fans, and every time they scored
they would erupt in cheers," he said.
"It was just incredible every time we
scored because their fans would
grow silent and our section of the
stands would go wild."
The team faced a three-goal
deficit at halftime, but fought back
for a 10-8 victory over one of the top
teams in the nation.
"The game was intense," Varel
las said. "I don't think I've ever been
as fired up as I was during the Cal
game and the Pepperdine game last
weekend. In the Cal game, they
came out hard, as expected, playing
their physical game."
Cal outscored Stanford 3-1 in the
first period of play with a pair of
goals by Cal's Brian Kinsel and Atti
la Banhidy. But Stanford brought it
self back from a halftime deficit of 6-

3 to complete a 4-0 run in the third
period. Goals by Varellas, sopho
more Thomas Hopkins, Crum and
junior Matt Moser, with three sec
onds left in the period, brought the
Cardinal ahead 7-6.
"We didn't play very intelligently
in the first half, but we got it togeth
er in the second half," Crum said.
"We've come back from bigger
deficits and won, so we never
thought we were out of the game."
Cal brought it back to a tie in the
fourth period, but goals by Crum
with 3:16 left and a long shot by
Azevedo with a minute to go sealed
the game for the Cardinal.
Varellas credited the Cardinal
victory to its ability to play well in
the second half and its roster of of
fensive threats. He emphasized
Stanford's need to continue focusing
on solid defensive play.
"Our offense is always there, and
now our defense is becoming one of
the best around," Varellas said.
"Other teams are having a tough
time defending us. We just have too

many threats for them to handle."
A win over the Bears should
place the Cardinal right behind
Southern California in the league
standings and cements its position
going into the MPSF tournament.
"We knew this was a huge game
for us in order to set us up for the
MPSF tournament," said Varellas.
"Basically, we will finish second now
in the MPSF behind USC, giving us
an easier route through the tourna
ment than if we had taken third or
fourth."
But every game counts at this
point in the season.
"Every game we play from now
on is a big game," Stockstill said.
"The last 10 games of the regular
season play heavy into MPSF rank
ings, so every time we take the pool
it is crucial that we dominate our op
ponents."
The Bears will have their chance
at revenge on Nov. 22 at 10 a.m.,
when they will once again face the
Cardinal in the annual Big Splash at
the Avery Aquatic Center.

The Cardinal went up against a much tougher oppo
nent in its Sunday game. Stanford battled its cross-bay
rivals before a sellout crowd of 1,120 at the Spieker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley.
"It's always tough going to Berkeley and playing Cal
at their place," said sophomore driver Peter Varellas.
"They always get huge, loud crowds and they are right
on top of you in the pool."
Stockstill found the game to be an electrifying experience.

Sophomore driver Thomas opkins and the Stanford men's water polo team defeated UC-lrvine 17-4 before beating
California 10-8 this weekend.
"Cat's facilities were packed with
fans, and every time they scored
they would erupt in cheers," he said.
"It was just incredible every time we
scored because their fans would
grow silent and our section of the
stands would go wild."
The team faced a three-goal
deficit at halftime, but fought back
for a 10-8 victory over one of the top
teams in the nation.
"The game was intense," Varel
las said. "I don't think I've ever been
as fired up as I was during the Cal
game and the Pepperdine game last
weekend. In the Cal game, they
came out hard, as expected, playing
their physical game."
Cal outscored Stanford 3-1 in the
first period of play with a pair of
goals by Cal's Brian Kinsel and Atti
la Banhidy. But Stanford brought it
self back from a halftime deficit of 6-

3 to complete a 4-0 run in the third
period. Goals by Varellas, sopho
more Thomas Hopkins, Crum and
junior Matt Moser, with three sec
onds left in the period, brought the
Cardinal ahead 7-6.
"We didn't play very intelligently
in the first half, but we got it togeth
er in the second half," Crum said.
"We've come back from bigger
deficits and won, so we never
thought we were out of the game."
Cal brought it back to a tie in the
fourth period, but goals by Crum
with 3:16 left and a long shot by
Azevedo with a minute to go sealed
the game for the Cardinal.
Varellas credited the Cardinal
victory to its ability to play well in
the second half and its roster of of
fensive threats. He emphasized
Stanford's need to continue focusing
on solid defensive play.
"Our offense is always there, and
now our defense is becoming one of
the best around," Varellas said.
"Other teams are having a tough
time defending us. We just have too

many threats for them to handle."
A win over the Bears should
place the Cardinal right behind
Southern California in the league
standings and cements its position
going into the MPSF tournament.
"We knew this was a huge game
for us in order to set us up for the
MPSF tournament," said Varellas.
"Basically, we will finish second now
in the MPSF behind USC, giving us
an easier route through the tourna
ment than if we had taken third or
fourth."
But every game counts at this
point in the season.
"Every game we play from now
on is a big game," Stockstill said.
"The last 10 games of the regular
season play heavy into MPSF rank
ings, so every time we take the pool
it is crucial that we dominate our op
ponents."
The Bears will have their chance
at revenge on Nov. 22 at 10 a.m.,
when they will once again face the
Cardinal in the annual Big Splash at
the Avery Aquatic Center.
