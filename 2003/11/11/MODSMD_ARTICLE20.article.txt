# Men's water polo takes two
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
In another stellar weekend of water polo, the No. 3
Cardinal (16-3, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) garnered two more league victories. Trampling
No. 13 Pacific 17-4 and caging No. 2 Cal 10-8 in back-to
back away games, the men proved they have indeed hit
their stride.
Seven different Cardinal players scored in Satur
day's shutout of the Tigers in Fresno. Junior driver
Tony Azevedo added another five goals to his season
total, scoring two goals each in the first and second pe
riods. Stanford led the Tigers 9-1 at the half.
Junior two-meter Greg Crum and senior utility
Mike Derse added three goals each in the onslaught
and goalies sophomore Chad Taylor and freshman
Beau Stockstill had four and five saves, respectively.
Stanford notched three goals in the third period and
five in the fourth period to bring the blowout to a close
at 17-4.
"The score shows that Pacific is kind of having an off
year," Crum said. "They'll be back next year for sure
though."
Stockstill saw the score as an indicator of how im
mense the scoring potential is throughout the Cardinal
bench.
"I think the game against Pacific, especially with
[the] win over Cal, just shows how much firepower we
have," Stockstill said. "There is no single person who
makes or breaks our team. We are strong up and down
the whole roster."
The Cardinal went up against a much tougher oppo
nent in its Sunday game. Stanford battled its cross-bay
rivals before a sellout crowd of 1,120 at the Spieker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley.
"It's always tough going to Berkeley and playing Cal
at their place," said sophomore driver Peter Varellas.
"They always get huge, loud crowds and they are right
on top of you in the pool."
Stockstill found the game to be an electrifying experience.
