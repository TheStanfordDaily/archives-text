### MOLLY QUINN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's varsity eight crew team man
aged a fourth-place finish in Sunday's Head of the Lake
regatta in Seattle, Wash., the team's last competition of
the fall racing season.
The competitive field of sixteen included six boats
from the 2003 NCAA regatta and perennial power
house, Washington.
Although the team was seeded first, it was pleased
with its fourth-place performance.
"The goal was to race as hard as we possibly could, no
matter what happened out on the course, to finish the
race with nothing left and to come off the water with no
regrets," said senior Melissa Haury. "That's exactly
what we did. We rowed better together as a boat than we
ever have and felt at the end of the race like we couldn't
have performed better."
Michigan State won the race in 17:18, followed by the

University of Victoria (17:21) and the University of Virginia
(17:26). Stanford finished three seconds out of third place.
The Stanford boat held off the Huskies despite being
slowed by a patch of weeds that were lodged in the boat's
rudder with 300 meters remaining.
"It's impossible to say the results had that not hap
pened, but we're confident that it would have put us
much closer to first place," Haury said.
Additionally, Stanford competed without varsity
rowers senior Susan Be Ville and sophomore Alexis Pe
terson. Freshmen Stephanie Connolly and Carly York
raced in their place.
"We proved to everyone that even with two varsity
rowers injured we are still highly competitive with the
top teams in the country," Haury said. "This weekend
has made us all extremely excited for the spring."
Stanford crew will open its spring season at the Win
dermere Collegiate Rowing Classic March 27 at Red
wood Shores. The women's varsity eight will race the
University of Virginia, Michigan State and Cornell.
