## Ads spark controversy 
### PETER NORLANDER CORNELL DAILY SUN 
(U-WIRE) TIHACA, N.Y. — A
series of pro-Israel advertisements for
the Web site campustruth.org has
caused controversy at college newspa
pers nationwide. The ads have been
condemned by various student groups
for alleged racism and have brought up
issues of free speech and the nature of
campus debate.
The leaders of the largest Jewish
and Muslim student groups at Cornell
University said Thursday that the ads,
which have also appeared in The Sun,
Cornell's daily student newspaper, un
dermine the cooperative relationship
between their organizations.
Senior Yusif Akhund, president of
the Muslim Educational and Cultural
Association, and senior Matt Jossen,
president of the Jewish Student Union,
have condemned the advertisements.
According to Akhund, Rabbi Ed
Rosenthal, executive director of Cor
nell Hillel, came to MECA's daily din
ner Thursday to express that he was of
fended by the ads and to say that Cor
nell Hillel did not condone or support
them.
"One thing about the Jewish com
munity," said the person behind the
ads, Marcella Rosen, "is that it does not
speak with one voice."
Rosen, director of the One Truth
Foundation, which paid for the ads, said
that her organization is a reaction to "a
verbal attack on Israel that we had wit
nessed across college campuses."
The ads seek "to make students
think about the question and come to
their own conclusion," according to
Rosen, and have been successful in
drawing 70,000 people to the campus
truth.org Web site.
One example, a half-page ad which
ran in The Sun yesterday, reads: "The
effect of Abed A-Basat Uda's March
27th suicide attack on his Israeli victims:
29 civilians murdered, 140 wounded, 20
seriously wounded" on a black back
ground juxtaposed side-by-side with
"The effect of Abed A-Basat Uda's
March 27th suicide attack on his Pales
tinian family: $25,000 in cash, furnished
apartment, pension for life, celebrity
status" on a white background.
Two sides to this story
Particularly disturbing to Akhund
was the slogan at the bottom of every
ad: "There are two sides to every story,
but only one truth."
"The statement is very narrow
minded," he said Thursday. "There
never only is one unbiased truth."
Rosen disagrees. A successful busi
nessperson who said this is "the first po
litical thing I've ever been involved in,"
Rosen points out the April 2002 Jenin
massacre when Israeli troops allegedly
killed dozens of Palestinian civilians.
But a massacre never occurred, accord
ing to both Rosen and the official Unit
ed Nations report on the incident. And

yet, many people have a misconception
about the events, she said.
"One hundred percent heard
[about the massacre]," Rosen said.
"Twenty-five percent heard about the
U.N. report. That's just one example.
On many campuses, there were really
very many lies told... We felt it was im
portant to present another side. No
body was standing up and saying
"That's a lie...' There are historical
facts that are not questions for rela
tivism or one side or the other."
"There are issues in this conflict
where it's much more complicated,"
she adds, mentioning Israeli settle
ments. But when it comes to teaching
children to hate, she said, "They do, we
don't."
Nationwide reaction
Across the country, campus papers
including The Stanford Daily, The
Michigan Daily and the Yale Daily
News have run the ads and witnessed
public upset voiced through letters to
the editor, protests and calls for the res
ignation of those responsible for print
ing them.
At the Yale Daily News, publisher
Christian Schaub made the decision to
print ads by One Truth. After Friday,
five of nine paid ads will have run.
"We have received a number of let
ters regarding our decision. However,
there hasn't been any sort of on-cam
pus protest yet," Schaub said.
One of file ads, "Heroes," generat
ed the most controversy at Yale and
elsewhere.
The split-screen ad shows an "Israeli
school children's hero," an athlete jux
taposed side-by-side with a "Palestin
ian school children's hero," a suicide
bomber. On the photo of the suicide
bomber, the ad cites two public opinion
polls showing that 68 percent of Pales
tinians approved of suicide bombing in
June 2002 and that 79 percent of young
Palestinians wanted to be martyrs in
January 2003.
"It has gotten some flak," Rosen
said. "First, we never said all Palestini
ans or all Israelis. But do most Ameri
cans love Michael Jordan? Yes. The
Palestinians educate their children to
hate... The ad is legitimate and de
scribes the education to hate... Every
thing we say is documented by other
sources. It's a bad reality, but it's true."
Rosen said that the image of the sui
cide bomber was taken from a poster
circulated in Palestinian cities after the
suicide bomber's attack.
"We didn't invent that; we didn't in
vent that poster," she said, adding that
10,000 to 20,000 posters of a suicide
bomber are circulated after attacks and
that Palestinian schools are named
after suicide bombers.
"I'm not a liar nor have I ever been,"
Rosen adds.
The Sun and the Stanford Daily de
cided not to run that particular ad.
After printing the "Heroes" ad once,
the Michigan Daily decided not to run

it again.
"I did not find that it was racist,"
Schaub said. "Yes, it is a generalization,
yet with the [poll data] that they are tak
ing I felt that was the major comparison
in it. They are presenting some interest
ing survey results... The [other ads] I do
not find nearly as objectionable."
"It does get the message across. This
was something that was designed to be
controversial," Schaub said. "There's a
lot of leeway."
Schaub said that ads representing
opposite viewpoints would be welcome
and that the paper routinely publishes
ads containing messages that the edi
tors and publisher do not hold.
Rosen said that many campus pa
pers have chosen to run the One Truth
ads, and at some campuses, there has
been an instant reaction of sit-ins, letter
writing and protests. According to
Rosen, a sit-in at the campus newspa
per at Rutgers University caused the
editor-in-chief to cancel the advertising
contract.
"People don't like people mad at
them," she said.
Approach Divergence
The Jewish Student Union at Cor
nell was notified earlier this semester
that the One Truth Foundation was
planning an ad campaign, according to
Jossen. But when the JSU asked for
more information about the specific
content of the ads, Jossen said that they
never heard back from the foundation.
"It seems very difficult to figure out
who's running all this stuff," Jossen
said. "We don't know where their fund
ing is coming from... The elusiveness
has made it more difficult to deal with."
Rosen said that the One Truth
Foundation includes about 100 sup
porters from diverse cultural and reli
gious backgrounds. She did not disclose
how much money the foundation has
spent on its advertising campaign.
Jossen said that an outside group
cannot appreciate or understand the
"friendly and open dialogue" between
Jewish and Muslim students at Cornell.
"[The ads] end up causing contro
versy where there was none before,"
Jossen said. "The relationship between
Cornell's different cultural groups is
uniquely friendly and open to dialogue.
We are able to work out our differences
peacefully."
"It's nice that things are good at
Cornell," Rosen said. "On the other
hand, a lot of outrageous lies have been
spread against Israel [in general]," she
adds. She also said that "we have a dif
ferent objective than [Jossen] and I'm
sorry he's not pleased."
Rosen said her group has a long
range aim to shape the debate about.
the Middle East conflict.
"One of the ways to get rid of a prac
tice — whether it is genital mutilation
in Africa or even slavery in the United
States way back when or suicide bomb
ing — is to expose it and air it," she said.

(U-WIRE) TIHACA, N.Y. — A
series of pro-Israel advertisements for
the Web site campustruth.org has
caused controversy at college newspa
pers nationwide. The ads have been
condemned by various student groups
for alleged racism and have brought up
issues of free speech and the nature of
campus debate.
The leaders of the largest Jewish
and Muslim student groups at Cornell
University said Thursday that the ads,
which have also appeared in The Sun,
Cornell's daily student newspaper, un
dermine the cooperative relationship
between their organizations.
Senior Yusif Akhund, president of
the Muslim Educational and Cultural
Association, and senior Matt Jossen,
president of the Jewish Student Union,
have condemned the advertisements.
According to Akhund, Rabbi Ed
Rosenthal, executive director of Cor
nell Hillel, came to MECA's daily din
ner Thursday to express that he was of
fended by the ads and to say that Cor
nell Hillel did not condone or support
them.
"One thing about the Jewish com
munity," said the person behind the
ads, Marcella Rosen, "is that it does not
speak with one voice."
Rosen, director of the One Truth
Foundation, which paid for the ads, said
that her organization is a reaction to "a
verbal attack on Israel that we had wit
nessed across college campuses."
The ads seek "to make students
think about the question and come to
their own conclusion," according to
Rosen, and have been successful in
drawing 70,000 people to the campus
truth.org Web site.
One example, a half-page ad which
ran in The Sun yesterday, reads: "The
effect of Abed A-Basat Uda's March
27th suicide attack on his Israeli victims:
29 civilians murdered, 140 wounded, 20
seriously wounded" on a black back
ground juxtaposed side-by-side with
"The effect of Abed A-Basat Uda's
March 27th suicide attack on his Pales
tinian family: $25,000 in cash, furnished
apartment, pension for life, celebrity
status" on a white background.
Two sides to this story
Particularly disturbing to Akhund
was the slogan at the bottom of every
ad: "There are two sides to every story,
but only one truth."
"The statement is very narrow
minded," he said Thursday. "There
never only is one unbiased truth."
Rosen disagrees. A successful busi
nessperson who said this is "the first po
litical thing I've ever been involved in,"
Rosen points out the April 2002 Jenin
massacre when Israeli troops allegedly
killed dozens of Palestinian civilians.
But a massacre never occurred, accord
ing to both Rosen and the official Unit
ed Nations report on the incident. And

yet, many people have a misconception
about the events, she said.
"One hundred percent heard
[about the massacre]," Rosen said.
"Twenty-five percent heard about the
U.N. report. That's just one example.
On many campuses, there were really
very many lies told... We felt it was im
portant to present another side. No
body was standing up and saying
"That's a lie...' There are historical
facts that are not questions for rela
tivism or one side or the other."
"There are issues in this conflict
where it's much more complicated,"
she adds, mentioning Israeli settle
ments. But when it comes to teaching
children to hate, she said, "They do, we
don't."
Nationwide reaction
Across the country, campus papers
including The Stanford Daily, The
Michigan Daily and the Yale Daily
News have run the ads and witnessed
public upset voiced through letters to
the editor, protests and calls for the res
ignation of those responsible for print
ing them.
At the Yale Daily News, publisher
Christian Schaub made the decision to
print ads by One Truth. After Friday,
five of nine paid ads will have run.
"We have received a number of let
ters regarding our decision. However,
there hasn't been any sort of on-cam
pus protest yet," Schaub said.
One of file ads, "Heroes," generat
ed the most controversy at Yale and
elsewhere.
The split-screen ad shows an "Israeli
school children's hero," an athlete jux
taposed side-by-side with a "Palestin
ian school children's hero," a suicide
bomber. On the photo of the suicide
bomber, the ad cites two public opinion
polls showing that 68 percent of Pales
tinians approved of suicide bombing in
June 2002 and that 79 percent of young
Palestinians wanted to be martyrs in
January 2003.
"It has gotten some flak," Rosen
said. "First, we never said all Palestini
ans or all Israelis. But do most Ameri
cans love Michael Jordan? Yes. The
Palestinians educate their children to
hate... The ad is legitimate and de
scribes the education to hate... Every
thing we say is documented by other
sources. It's a bad reality, but it's true."
Rosen said that the image of the sui
cide bomber was taken from a poster
circulated in Palestinian cities after the
suicide bomber's attack.
"We didn't invent that; we didn't in
vent that poster," she said, adding that
10,000 to 20,000 posters of a suicide
bomber are circulated after attacks and
that Palestinian schools are named
after suicide bombers.
"I'm not a liar nor have I ever been,"
Rosen adds.
The Sun and the Stanford Daily de
cided not to run that particular ad.
After printing the "Heroes" ad once,
the Michigan Daily decided not to run

it again.
"I did not find that it was racist,"
Schaub said. "Yes, it is a generalization,
yet with the [poll data] that they are tak
ing I felt that was the major comparison
in it. They are presenting some interest
ing survey results... The [other ads] I do
not find nearly as objectionable."
"It does get the message across. This
was something that was designed to be
controversial," Schaub said. "There's a
lot of leeway."
Schaub said that ads representing
opposite viewpoints would be welcome
and that the paper routinely publishes
ads containing messages that the edi
tors and publisher do not hold.
Rosen said that many campus pa
pers have chosen to run the One Truth
ads, and at some campuses, there has
