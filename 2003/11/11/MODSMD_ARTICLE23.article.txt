# Pre-paid tuition plans frozen across country

### DREW STEVENS DAILY EGYPTIAN 
(U-WIRE) CARBONDALE, 111. — Earlier
this year, Colorado froze enrollments in its pre
paid tuition plan, and Ohio announced three
weeks ago it was suspending its program for a year
because the state was losing money. West Vir
ginia, Kentucky and Texas have also temporarily
cut off new enrollment in the plan.
Nancy Stephens, assistant director of College
Illinois' Prepaid Tuition Program, though, said
the suspension of prepaid tuition plans in Illinois
has not been explored as an option to alleviate the
Illinois budget crisis.
"There's no problem here in Illinois in terms of
the College Illinois' closing," Stephens said.
"We've taken some of the necessary steps to im
prove the financial stability of the program."
Fourteen states currently offer prepaid tuition
plans. In Illinois, the 529 Prepaid Tuition Program
is called College Illinois' and is administered by
the Illinois Student Assistance Commission.
Named after the section of the federal tax code
that authorizes them, 529s are state-sponsored
college funding programs designed to help fami
lies save for future college costs.
Ann Acton, associate director of financial aid
at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, said
suspending tuition plans designed to help families
pay for tuition in the future shifts the responsibil
ity for saving for college back to the family.
In places where programs have been suspend
ed, states are allowing those with money invested
in prepaid plans to keep the funds there, although
they also are being given other investment op
tions.
Stephens said Colorado has permanently
closed its programs and is not planning on re
opening it because of budget problems.
"Since the Illinois budget crisis seems to be as
serious as those in other states, perhaps Illinois'
priorities continue to be more focused on higher
education, as has traditionally been the case,"
Acton said.
Families in Illinois can begin building a strong
college-funding plan any time after a child is born,
locking in the cost of tuition and fees today and

protecting them from future inflation.
According to the College Illinois' Web site, tu
ition and fees at Illinois public universities in
creased by 10.7 percent in 2002. Standard tuition
and fees for an SIUC student enrolled in 15 hours
per semester for the 2003-2004 academic year is
$5,521, an increase of more than $500 from the
previous year.
According to Stephens, 20,000 Illinois families
have purchased 36,000 contracts since the pro
gram opened in 1998.
"We feel College Illinois' is a very safe and se
cure plan for families to use to prepare for future
college tuition and reduce their costs and at the
same time save on tuition for the future,"
Stephens said.
Families apply for the program during the en
rollment period, which runs from late October
through March, and are able to lock in that year's
tuition and fees, regardless of when the money is
going to be used. Future increases in tuition and
fees will be backed by the state.
Plans can be purchased with a single lump sum,
annual payments or monthly installments. The
purchaser can buy one to nine semesters of tuition
and mandatory fee benefits from the state based
on today's costs.
Benefits will cover the full cost at Illinois pub
lic universities and community colleges.
If a beneficiary attends a private or out-of
state public institution, College Illinois' will only
pay a portion of the costs. Benefits will equal the
mean-weighted average of tuition and fees at Illi
nois public universities or community colleges at
the time of enrollment in college. The student will
be responsible for making up the difference.
For example, the mean-weighted average tu
ition and fees for one year at Illinois public uni
versities for this academic year is $5,785. If some
one had purchased a contract for a student who
enrolled at a private or out-of-state public univer
sity or college this year, College Illinois' would
pay that institution $5,785 on behalf of that stu
dent.
College Illinois' pays for tuition and any
mandatory enrollment fees. Room, board, books
and transportation are not covered.
