# Former poet laureate draws laughs, praise

### ALBERT CHIOU 
Former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins read
selected works from his poetry in front of a packed
audience of more than 400 people in Cubberly Au
ditorium last night.
Collins' poetry reading was the opening event
of this year's Lane Lecture Series, which seeks to
bring distinguished contemporary poets and writ
ers to Stanford.
Collins' poetry is noted for its humor, wisdom
and variety. He was introduced by English profes
sor Ken Fields, a fellow poet.
"Everyone seems to like him, even poets,"
Fields said of Collins. He added that Collins was
one of the few poets that could actually outsell fic
tion writers.

"For that he should be considered holy among
our people," Fields said.
One of the first poems that Collins read was
based on one of his phobias. He explained that he
developed it while growing up in an apartment in
New York City.
"I was afraid of furniture," Collins said, "par
ticularly those with faces on them."
The poem he read recounted the horror of find
ing a stone on the beach that was shaped like a
face.
Collins then read poems about country lore, a
lanyard, love and a mid-age crisis suffered by a 10-
year-old. He consistently drew laughs from the au
dience, both through his poetry and through his

explanations of how he was inspired
to write each poem.
Collins' final poem, "Nightclub,"
drew a standing ovation.
Later that night, Collins ex
plained why he writes humorous po
etry.
"I use humor as sort of a disarm
ing device, and so the reader can't
tell how seriously I'm taking my
self," Collins said.
When an audience member
asked whether people thought of
him as a clown of a poet, he said that
humor was actually extremely
prominent in poetry during the days

of Geoffrey Chaucer and John
Donne.
"Then the Romanticists got rid of
sex and humor and substituted it
with landscapes, and I think that's a
bad deal... Humor has regained its
natural place in poetry, so I don't
think of myself as a poetry bozo."
The audience reacted positively
to Collins' reading.
"I thought it was fantastic," said
Judd Bruzgul, a graduate student. "I
haven't actually read his work, but I
found out about it through a friend
and I'm glad I came."
Lynn Varner, a Knight Fellow,
voiced the same opinion.
"I'm glad he pointed out that po
etry can be humorous. Look at the
turnout... gosh, people were sitting
on the floor. I think that says some
thing positive about poetry."
