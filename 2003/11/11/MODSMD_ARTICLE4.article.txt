# Standardized tests under review

Doing well on state high school tests
is not a guarantee that one has the tools
to succeed in college, concludes a new
study from Standards for Success, part
of the University of Oregon's Center for
Educational Policy research. Standards
for Success compiles and maintains a list
of skills necessary for success in college
endorsed by Stanford and other presti
gious universities.
Specially trained university faculty
and high school teachers, including
members of the Stanford faculty, com
pared the state tests to the set of univer
sity success standards developed by S4S.
Through analysis of 66 tests in English
and math from 20 states, the study found
that "state high school exams bear an in

consistent relationship to the knowl
edge and skills necessary for college suc
cess."
"We did content analysis to see if the
test items line up with the relevant skills
that allow one to succeed in entry level
[college] courses," explained David
Conley, project director at Standards for
Success. He added that the states did not
test research skills or probability and
statistics, despite their importance in
college level science classes.
This dichotomy of standards poses a
number of challenges to high school stu
dents. Students often arrive at college
and discovering that college demands
different skills from them.
As part of a larger project to examine
and improve the transition from sec
ondary school into higher education,

Professors of Education Michael Kirst
and Anthony Antonio, with Andrea
Venezia, conducted a study entitled,
"Betraying the College Dream." The
study found that, "The coursework be
tween high school and college is not con
nected; students graduate from high
school under one set of standards and,
three months later, are required to meet
a whole new set of standards in college."
Conley explained that while still in
high school, the preponderance of tests
is difficult to justify to students, who feel
that they are not a valuable assessment.
This sentiment is amplified for gifted
students, who may not be challenged by
the examinations.
