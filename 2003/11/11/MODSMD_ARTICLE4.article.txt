# Standardized tests under review

### HENRY F. BRIDGE 
Doing well on state high school tests
is not a guarantee that one has the tools
to succeed in college, concludes a new
study from Standards for Success, part
of the University of Oregon's Center for
Educational Policy research. Standards
for Success compiles and maintains a list
of skills necessary for success in college
endorsed by Stanford and other presti
gious universities.
Specially trained university faculty
and high school teachers, including
members of the Stanford faculty, com
pared the state tests to the set of univer
sity success standards developed by S4S.
Through analysis of 66 tests in English
and math from 20 states, the study found
that "state high school exams bear an in

consistent relationship to the knowl
edge and skills necessary for college suc
cess."
"We did content analysis to see if the
test items line up with the relevant skills
that allow one to succeed in entry level
[college] courses," explained David
Conley, project director at Standards for
Success. He added that the states did not
test research skills or probability and
statistics, despite their importance in
college level science classes.
This dichotomy of standards poses a
number of challenges to high school stu
dents. Students often arrive at college
and discovering that college demands
different skills from them.
As part of a larger project to examine
and improve the transition from sec
ondary school into higher education,

Professors of Education Michael Kirst
and Anthony Antonio, with Andrea
Venezia, conducted a study entitled,
"Betraying the College Dream." The
study found that, "The coursework be
tween high school and college is not con
nected; students graduate from high
school under one set of standards and,
three months later, are required to meet
a whole new set of standards in college."
Conley explained that while still in
high school, the preponderance of tests
is difficult to justify to students, who feel
that they are not a valuable assessment.
This sentiment is amplified for gifted
students, who may not be challenged by
the examinations.
"Kids are taking a lot of tests
which yield only ambiguous results,"
said Conley. "They feel they're a
complete waste of time."
Directors of state testing pro
grams rightly point out that the tests
were never designed to measure col
lege readiness. Yet S4S maintains
they should.
"The problem is, if you pass these
tests and graduate, it doesn't neces
sarily mean that you can da anything.

If kids have to spend all this time tak
ing tests, why not have them mean
something?" Conley said.
Although the Scholastic Aptitude
Test is traditionally held to be the na
tional standard of college prepared
ness, Conley rejects this claim, and
feels that state tests are actually in a
better position to evaluate ability:
"The SAT in the future might be
that way [a good measure of future
college success], but keep in mind
that that SAT is limited to 75 ques
tions and a couple of hours, whereas
state tests are often six hours long, go
more in depth and look at the whole
curriculum" he said.
According to Education Prof.

Michael Kirst, who was extensively in
volved in the S4S study, these prob
lems have long been a characteristic of
the United States' education system.
"The lack of connection between
K-12 and higher education is rooted
deeply in the history of U.S. educa
tion policy," he said.
The S4S study offers several sug
gestions to remedy this gap. First and
foremost, it asserts that states can
and should consider college require
ments when devising their tests. To
further this end, it suggests studies
tracking students' records in high
school, on state exams, and college
grades. Once these data have been
extracted, it recommends frequent

modifications to adjust for changing
college standards.
It is unclear whether such modifi
cations would affect the admissions
process.
"Our decision to not use state
tests has little to do with our thoughts
about the accuracy of the individual
exams," explained Robin Mamlet,
dean of admissions. "Our primary in
terest is not a measurement of suc
cess after one day of subject-based
testing but rather how an individual
student challenged himself or her
self, took advantage of available op
portunities and developed passions
throughout the entire high school ex
perience."
