# Daily Board dismisses recall
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Ammar Nayfeh from the Coalition for Justice asked The
Stanford Daily Board of Directors last night to recall editor in
chief Ramin Setoodeh, but the Board did not believe grounds
existed for initiating a recall.
The Daily did, however, unanimously pass a motion to or
ganize and fund a panel to discuss ethics in advertising and the
media.
Nayfeh had been invited before the Board because he and
the Coalition for Justice have been seeking to stop the publica
tion of pro-Israeli advertisements from the One Truth Foun
dation, which they feel are racist and unfair to the Palestinian
community. Nayfeh told the Board that he has 300 signatures
on a petition asking The Daily to stop running the ads, and 120
signatures on a separate petition asking The Daily to recall Se
toodeh.
The Board discussed the issue with Nayfeh, and expressed
concern, but ultimately decided that it would be overstepping
The Daily's bylaws for the Board to take any action.
"These ideas represented by this organization do exist," said
Board member Michael Londgren. "Is it better to squelch them
or to allow them to be heard? I personally think they should be
heard."
Nayfeh disagreed with The Daily's stance on the ads.

"Anything in The Daily that hurts anyone should not be al
lowed," Nayfeh said. "I see an error here and I feel like I'm
going to do my best to stop it."
Board member and Communication Prof. Ted Glasser
sympathized with Nayfeh.
"I think the ads are mean and stupid and I wish they'd never
run anywhere, including The Daily," he said. "[But] I feel like
we wouldn't have much left if we as a Board started interfering
with how the students run this newspaper."
The Daily's bylaws state that the editor in chief has sole dis
cretion over the content of the newspaper, including advertise
ments.
"We are governed by bylaws and articles of incorporation,
which outline what we can do," Londgren said. "The editor has
complete control over the content, which actually extends to
the ad policy."
Nayfeh said that regardless of whether the One Truth Foun
dation ad series was pulled prior to its scheduled completion on
Nov. 21, he hoped that The Daily would address what he saw as
a lack of concern for and communication with the offended stu
dents. Nayfeh also criticized The Daily for not responding to
student complaints quickly enough.
"Our main goal is not the recall but more so to find a solution
for the future of The Daily, so that these kinds of hate ads are not
