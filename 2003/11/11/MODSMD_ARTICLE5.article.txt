# Daily Board dismisses recall
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Ammar Nayfeh from the Coalition for Justice asked The
Stanford Daily Board of Directors last night to recall editor in
chief Ramin Setoodeh, but the Board did not believe grounds
existed for initiating a recall.
The Daily did, however, unanimously pass a motion to or
ganize and fund a panel to discuss ethics in advertising and the
media.
Nayfeh had been invited before the Board because he and
the Coalition for Justice have been seeking to stop the publica
tion of pro-Israeli advertisements from the One Truth Foun
dation, which they feel are racist and unfair to the Palestinian
community. Nayfeh told the Board that he has 300 signatures
on a petition asking The Daily to stop running the ads, and 120
signatures on a separate petition asking The Daily to recall Se
toodeh.
The Board discussed the issue with Nayfeh, and expressed
concern, but ultimately decided that it would be overstepping
The Daily's bylaws for the Board to take any action.
"These ideas represented by this organization do exist," said
Board member Michael Londgren. "Is it better to squelch them
or to allow them to be heard? I personally think they should be
heard."
Nayfeh disagreed with The Daily's stance on the ads.

"Anything in The Daily that hurts anyone should not be al
lowed," Nayfeh said. "I see an error here and I feel like I'm
going to do my best to stop it."
Board member and Communication Prof. Ted Glasser
sympathized with Nayfeh.
"I think the ads are mean and stupid and I wish they'd never
run anywhere, including The Daily," he said. "[But] I feel like
we wouldn't have much left if we as a Board started interfering
with how the students run this newspaper."
The Daily's bylaws state that the editor in chief has sole dis
cretion over the content of the newspaper, including advertise
ments.
"We are governed by bylaws and articles of incorporation,
which outline what we can do," Londgren said. "The editor has
complete control over the content, which actually extends to
the ad policy."
Nayfeh said that regardless of whether the One Truth Foun
dation ad series was pulled prior to its scheduled completion on
Nov. 21, he hoped that The Daily would address what he saw as
a lack of concern for and communication with the offended stu
dents. Nayfeh also criticized The Daily for not responding to
student complaints quickly enough.
"Our main goal is not the recall but more so to find a solution
for the future of The Daily, so that these kinds of hate ads are not
allowed on our campus," Nayfeh said.
"Hopefully you guys can set a prece
dent and reunite the community, be
cause there are a lot of people who feel
disenfranchised from The Daily."

Setoodeh defended the decision to
run the ads, despite the fact that many

staff members — Setoodeh included
— did not agree with their message, al
though he did say that e-mails he re
ceived on the subject were "50-50" in
regards to their support for or disap
proval of the ads.
"If I only let in ideas that I support,
then this isn't an objective newspaper,
it's what the editor in chief thinks," he
said. "I don't think as editor in chief I
should have the power to say what we
can't discuss."

After Nayfeh left, the Board deter
mined that no member was interested
in motioning for a recall of Setoodeh.
Glasser, though, motioned and
Board member Prof. William Woo
seconded the proposal for the panel
discussing how advertising decisions
are made at newspapers.
"I'd like the community to know
that we recognize this debate, without
taking a stand on it," Glasser said.
The motion put Daily Advertising

Manager Lilla Toal in charge of plan
ning the event, possibly in conjunction
with the Program in Ethics and Society.
Londgren cautioned that this
process could take months.
Setoodeh and Daily Business Man
ager Ezra Callahan are already sched
uled to represent The Daily in an
ASSU-sponsored discussion of the
role of campus publications, which will
take place this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union's Oak West Room.
