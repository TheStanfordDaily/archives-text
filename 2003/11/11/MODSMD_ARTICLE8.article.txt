Waging on the Number of Genes
GeneSweep has a winner — the number
25,947. GeneSweep is the betting pool over the
number of human genes. The competition start
ed informally at the start of the Human Genome
Project and soon became a favorite in the scien
tific community. Estimates ran as low as 10,000 to
as high as 100,000. Ensembl, a database of genes,
currently has 24,847 entries but the exact number

remains unknown. The rea
son is that recognizing genes is
a tough task because it is diffi
cult to find what exactly is
translated into a protein and
what is not. Added to that is
the problem that one human
gene may be processed in
many different ways, giving
rise to a host of proteins. Most
scientists believe the final
number of human genes is

higher, probably a little over 30,000.
Cancer and Plant Sap
A plant sap may be associated with childhood
cancer. British scientists found a connection be
tween the sap of the African milkbush and en
demic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL), the most com
mon form of childhood cancer in sub-Saharan
Africa. The sap is frequently used in herbal
medicines, glue and as a play item for children.
The researchers found that even very low con
centrations of the sap can trigger the Epstein-
Barr virus, believed to be the leading cause of
eBL. The genes that are activated allow the virus
to replicate and infect new cells. The study was
published in the British Journal of Cancer.
Pulsars Teach us about Extrasolar Planets
Astronomers have been successful in finding
the mass of planets orbiting a pulsar. Pulsars are
the remains of stars that are spinning very fast, re
leasing intense amounts of radiation. The first
extra-solar planets (beyond our solar system)
were discovered around pulsar PSR B1257+12.
The recent studies found that the planetary sys
tem around this pulsar is remarkably similar to
our own in terms of mass—indeed the most sim
ilar found to date. This suggests that planetary
formation may be much more common than first
thought. Alex Wolszczan, an astronomer at Penn
State and one of the co-authors, said, "This find
ing and the striking similarity of the appearance
of the pulsar system to the inner solar system pro
vide an important guideline for planning the fu
ture searches for Earth-like planets around near
by stars."
Vietnam War and Herbicides
Herbicide use in the Vietnam War may have
been more extensive than thought — and could
have potentially caused more damage. The study
published in Nature analyzed military flight
records for Agent Orange—as well as other her
bicides known as Agent Purple and Agent Pink -
and found that the total amount of dioxin was
four times more than previously estimated. The
data suggests that at least 3,000 hamlets were
sprayed, affecting between 2 million and 4 million
people. Originally the authors were trying to de
velop better computer modeling for environ
mental analysis. The unforeseen discovery has
prompted reactions from U.S. veteran groups
seeing compensation and the Vietnamese gov
ernment.
Cloning Primates Difficult
Remember the Raelians, the cult that
claimed they had cloned a human baby? Well,
more and more studies suggest that cloning
primates is not possible with the current tech
nology. Researchers attempted to clone rhe
sus macaques but not one of the resulting em
bryos transplanted onto surrogates mothers
survived. Apparently the clone's chromo
somes divide unevenly and some cells end up
with too much and others with too little. The
key seems to be spindle proteins, which are in
volved in chromosome migration during cell
division. As bioethicists have pointed out
though, the pace of technological develop
mental is relentless and discussing the ethics of
cloning is crucial.
Parkison's may be caused by excess Iron
Scientists have found that removing excess
iron from neurons may improve Parkinson's.
The study used both transgenic (dealing with
genes) and pharmacological (dealing with drugs)
methods to sequester iron in mice exposed to
neurotoxins. They found that ferritin, which con
verts iron from a reactive into an unreactive form,
attenuated the loss of neurons. Antibiotics
chelated with protective metals were also able to
protected neurons from free radical iron ions.
Several studies have found that iron is associated
with neurodegenerative diseases and that its lev
els increase with aging.
