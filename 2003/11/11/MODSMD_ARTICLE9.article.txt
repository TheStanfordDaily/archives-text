# STOP, THIEF !
## How to prevent the great laptop caper 
### ARAM HUR 
Losing your bike is just an inconvenience; losing your laptop is devasta
tion. Although Stanford has a relatively safe environment, there have been
five laptop thefts just this past week, and a total of 53 thefts since January, ac
cording to campus police.
The consequences for the victim of a laptop theft can be drastic. While
having to resort to resident computer clusters is unfortunate, it is nothing
compared to the financial loss that ranges from roughly $2,000 to $4,000.
More importantly, however, there is no way to recover the invaluable data
stored on the laptops.
Freshman Claire Liu, who says she is thankful that her laptop has never
been stolen, says that if it were pilfered, "I'd be angry that someone was
shameless enough to take valuable property that wasn't his or hers. But more
than that, I'd feel shocked first that I didn't take any measures to prevent it
from being stolen."
But sometimes we don't realize our negligence until after we've broken a
vase. Since all students live with the potential threat of laptop theft, it would
behoove most on campus to take the appropriate precautions to prevent lap
top theft, authorities say.
The first danger laptops lies in the machine's very nature: mobility. With
laptops getting smaller and smaller, it's becoming easier to steal them every
year. The logical solution is to always lock your laptop even if it's in your
room. But few students actually take these precautions.
Not many realize how easy it is for a person to break into dorm rooms via
windows and unlocked doors, according to Sgt. Tim Hanrahan of the De
partment of Public Safety who adds that campus thieves follow a set pattern.
They will walk into buildings and roam through open offices to see if there
are any loose laptops. Ever so casually, laptops happen to walk out the door
with them.
"A lock is by no means a guarantee, but definitely a discouragement," says
Hanrahan.
Another mistake students often make is trusting in the safety of a public
setting. In a library, they believe that theft is impossible for there are so many
bystanders. The point is, however, that those bystanders are busily occupied
with their own affairs and do not pay attention to what is going on around
them. Authorities suggest that you use tables with portholes for laptop locks.
"Never leave your laptop unattended," says Sgt. Rick Tipton.
An additional precaution to the lock is frequently changing the password.
A conniving thief may figure out the password and suavely unlock it to avoid
any suspicion from standers-by. Although cumbersome, changing your code
right before you leave the room will act as a definite safeguard against theft.
Finally, don't show off your laptop. While your excitement of purchasing
the newest Sony or Toshiba is completely understandable, try to keep your
happiness to yourself. Your enthusiasm about your new computer may inad
vertently be heard by the wrong person, which could provide information or
motivation for theft.
If, by misfortune, you become the victim of laptop theft, immediately no
tify the police department. "If students don't report cases to us, we have no
data and will have absolutely no chance of finding the laptop," says Tipton.
Both officers recommend that students know their laptop's serial number for
the same reason that they should know their bike's. The serial number acts as
an ID tag for the laptop. While Stanford does not have a computer registra
tion system within itself, the police department has an automated law en
forcement database. When a student updates a serial number in its database,
the system will track the laptop if the serial number surfaces and report it
back to Stanford's police department.
"The chances of retrieving a laptop are still very low," admits Hanrahan.
"Once stolen, the laptops are sold away pretty quickly."
More and more, though, college students are finding laptops to be an in
dispensable commodity to daily life. While their inner workings may be be
yond everybody but the electrical engineer down the hall, keeping them safe
is simple.
Tipton aptly sums it up: "Use common sense and always be on the look
out."
