No Beginning, No End:
The Intimate Heart of Zen
by Jakusho Kwong
Wednesday, November 12, 2003
7:OOPM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
The "Big Mind" that Zen Buddhist master
Shunryu Suzuki Roshi so poetically
described in his classic Zen Mind,
Beginner's Mind shines throughout this
collection of talks by Kwong, a disciple and
authorized successor of Suzuki's.
Appropriately for someone erasing the
usual dualistic lines that separate self and
other, Kwong's voice is strikingly reminis
cent of his teacher's, from the traditional
stories and poems he cites to the same cen
tral figures of speech and simple diction he
uses. The book is also organized like Zen
Mind into three parts with quotes pulled
out to head each chapter. It even includes
10 of Kwong's calligraphic illustrations,
while Zen Mind opens with calligraphy fac
ing its title page. Unlike his teacher, how
ever, the California-born Kwong speaks the
language of Zen with an American accent.
He is intimately familiar with the American
lexicon of words and values, which gives
him direct experience-important in Zen-to
bring to the cultural meeting of modern
American and Japanese Zen minds. He uses
"living words"-concrete nouns and simple
examples from everyday observation or
experience-rather than abstract concepts
to make plain and understandable the
teasing and logic-confounding contradic
tions found in Zen. Culled from a lifetime
of teaching and studying, the book is per
suasive. It is the fruit of a ripened mind,
hardened by practice but also softened by
the compassionate wisdom drawn from
those same long years of experience.
