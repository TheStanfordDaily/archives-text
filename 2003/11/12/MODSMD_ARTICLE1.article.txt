## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Lanita Foley, assistant director in the Office of Under
graduate Admission and director of African American
Outreach at Stanford, has announced that she will be leav
ing Stanford on Friday.
Though this notice comes as a surprise to many, Foley
said that it has been a long and deliberate decision.
"This was not a rash or impulsive decision on my part,"
Foley said. "In fact, it was quite hard. I love Stanford, and
I'm really proud of the work that I've been able to accom
plish here."
Foley declined to comment on her plans for the future.
"I'm sure that I will continue to give back to the world
in other meaningful ways," was all that she would allow. ".I
have more to give."
Foley, Class of 1997, insisted that the decision to step
down was hers, despite rumors suggesting that she was
asked to leave.
Dean of Undergraduate Admission Robin Mamlet
confirmed that Foley chose to step down.
"Lanita is an incredibly talented admission officer and
I actually asked her to stay, not leave," Mamlet said. "I am
sad to lose her."
Many at Stanford say they are sad to lose Foley. Her
presence on campus was felt in particular by the black
community, with which she worked closely. Foley cham
pioned black student admissions, and during her time at
Stanford, the University achieved the highest black stu
dent yield (percentage of admitted student choosing to en
roll).
Mamlet attributed this fact to Foley's tireless work
ethic. It was not unheard of for Foley to call black students
upon their admission to Stanford to encourage them to at
tend.
Mamlet also deserves credit for Stanford's success with
black students, according to Jan Barker-Alexander, dean
of the Black Community Services Center.
"The admissions office has done great things," Barker
Alexander said. "It has been a collective effort. The dean
of admission calls the shots because she's overseeing the
whole division, and Robin has been very supportive of
Lanita's work."
Barker-Alexander pointed out that black student yield
has been steadily increasing throughout the time Mamlet
has been at Stanford.
"My personal commitment to diversity remains
strong," Mamlet said.

Foley said she remains confident that Stanford will
continue to lead the country in black student yield.
"From my perspective, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission has a commitment to diversity broadly de
fined, so I think that diversity will thrive," Foley said. "I
know that my colleagues will maintain their commit
ment."

her final days at Stanford.
"When I attended the Black Com
munity Welcome during Orientation
Week, she walked up to my parents
and me, introduced herself and told
me that if I ever needed anything I
should come see her," junior Ron
Ragin said of his first impression of
Foley. "I have taken her up on that
offer many times in the past two

years. She is a person that I feel I can
always approach, someone who will
always make time for students."
Ragin, who is from a small town in
Georgia, said that he told Foley that
he would like Stanford to put more
effort into recruiting Georgia high
school students who are not from the
Atlanta area.
"Lanita took my request to heart,
and the following year she was
pleased to tell me that more non-At
lanta people were admitted," he said.
"I was very impressed and thankful. I

have not experienced that kind of
care and attention from any other
Stanford faculty member."
Foley said she has been over
whelmed by the recent outpouring of
gratitude.
"I am very touched," she said. "It
has been more than I could have ever
imagined. As a graduate from the
Class of 1997, this is not good-bye.
You cannot say good-bye to family,
right? I am sure that our paths will
cross again somewhere in the future.
The world is quite small."
