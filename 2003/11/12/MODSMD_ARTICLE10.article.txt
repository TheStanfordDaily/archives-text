eYo Answer Boy, Why's
The Daily got to be so
hatemongering? I've
seen these so-called
"Campus Truth" ads, and they
ain't nothin' but a negative gener
alization of the Palestinian peo
ple. That's not cool.
A I'm glad that you asked
/\ this question. Bonita
/ 1 Song, my companion in
. JL crime (a.k.a. Answer
Girl), declared yesterday that she
refuses to address this issue in her
column. I, on the other hand, do
not shirk my responsibilities as
The Stanford Daily's Answer

Boy. When a question is there to
be answered, I answer it. While

Song may sing
quite nicely, In
novation's pusil
lanimous An
swer Girl seems
not to have the
cojones to ad
dress the serious
issues on cam
pus.
You seem
like a smart kid.

Unless you have a serious eye de
fect like glaucoma, conjunctivitis
or macular degeneration, I'm sure
that you caught the disclaimer at
the bottom of the campustruth.org
ad yesterday, noting that it does

not necessarily reflect the views of
anyone at The Daily. This, in
legalese, is a "save-my-ass-from
controversy" clause. Obviously, it
didn't work.
Instead, The Daily has been
barraged with letters, opinions
pieces and an attempt to recall the
editor in chief. Critics argue that
The Daily should refuse to print
the ads.
The Daily refuses to print ads
that engage in name-calling or ad
vocate violent or illegal activities.
But The Daily will print silly
statements about itself if you pay
them to.
Campustruth.org approached
The Daily to run another ad which
features a picture of an "Israeli

school children's hero," an athlete,
juxtaposed next to a "Palestinian
school children's hero," a suicide
bomber. It then cites a survey that
says 68 percent of Palestinians ap
proved of suicide bombing. The
Daily refused to run this ad, saying
that it is not factually correct be
cause approval is not equivalent to
hero-worship.
Marcella Rosen is the director
of the One Truth Foundation,
which pays for the ads. If you have
a problem with them, go accuse
her of hatemongering.

Answer boy hates hate. He also likes
to answer questions. If you have
one, e-mail him at barretts@stan
ford.edu.
