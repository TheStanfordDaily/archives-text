## Tresidder opens in good time 
### 
After five months of construction, the
remodeled Tresidder dining area
opened yesterday. We applaud Din
ing Services for completing this pro
ject on a fast-track timetable. Projects of this
scale normally take two years from the drawing
board to completion. This speedy renovation
will now provide a valuable eating space*for stu
dents, faculty and staff to enjoy themselves.
The opening day attracted large crowds
eager to sample the new types of food. Subway
sold more than $4,000 worth of sandwiches,
with the line reaching out the door during the
lunch hour. Into the night, the crowds re
mained, attracted by the video screens, comput
ers and plasma announcement boards in the
dining area. Plenty of tables and chairs allowed
students to study, sit with friends or simply
enjoy a cup of coffee from Peet's.
Keeping Peet's Coffee open until 2 a.m. is a
step in the right direction to promote safe, qual
ity nightlife on campus. During weekdays, bev
erages will be served until closing. Dining ser
vices is waiting to see if students are interested

in keeping the dining area open on weekends,
stating that if there is enough student interest,
extended hours will be offered. We encourage
students to express an interest in keeping the
Tresidder dining area open on weekends. Not
only is the new dining center an improvement
over the old Tresidder eating area, it provides
an invaluable meeting space for members of the
Stanford community.
Designers should also be applauded for in
cluding several computers that patrons can use
to check their e-mail or surf favorite Web sites.
However, we would like to see the computer
services expanded to include additional laptop
hookup spaces, more computers and optional
printing.
Overall, the renovations are visually pleas
ing, and we look forward to phase two, the
opening of the main restaurant area in January.
We would like to encourage extended hours for
these services as well. Now is the perfect time
for planners to get student input to improve
upon the area so that it best meets Stanford's
needs.
