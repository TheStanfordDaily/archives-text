# Skateboarding not a crime
## 
### 
Recently, some students have been
surprised to find themselves tick
eted by police for skateboarding
on campus. Although few stu
dents might be aware of the law, a Santa
Clara County ordinance was passed in 1992
that prohibits skateboarding within a large
section of campus, including the area
bounded by Campus Drive. We believe the
prohibition of all skateboarding, while
roller-blading and biking remain legal, is an
inconsistent law that should be amended.
Earlier this year, six juveniles were ar
rested for skateboarding near Building 380.
This sort of police action seems more akin
to a subplot from an episode of "The Simp
sons." Stanford has indeed found itself in a
sad place if it is arresting minors for skate
boarding, yet cannot capture the infamous
"Serial Groper."
The ordinance against skateboarding was
passed in response to property damage in
curred by skateboarders attempting tricks
on campus structures. While behavior that
clearly damages property or poses a safety
hazard is inappropriate and should be out
lawed, there are plenty of skateboarders
who use their boards in a safe manner. For
these students, skateboarding provides a
quick and fun way to get around campus.

The law takes a negative stereotype about
the destructive behavior of skateboarders
and gives it universal validity by prohibiting
all skateboarding in the area.
Rather than making this form of trans
portation illegal, only reckless skateboard
ing should be prohibited. For bicyclists and
rollerbladers, a law mandates that it's ille
gal to perform stunts that can cause injury
or damage property. Speeding, failing to
obey traffic signs and hitching rides from
vehicles are also outlawed. Similar restric
tions on skaterboarders would be more rea
sonable.
In reality, officers prioritize safety
threats and are unlikely to ticket students
for responsible skateboarding on campus.
However, the law says that they can; and in
some circumstances, citations have been is
sued and arrests have bee made. There is
nothing more inherently dangerous about
skateboarding than biking or rollerblad
ing. Ignoring basic traffic rules and travel
ing at unsafe speeds is dangerous, regard
less of whether you are on a bike, blades or
board. Likewise, campus property can be
damaged by any of these three means of
transportation. In all fairness, students
who skateboard responsibly should not be
penalized.
