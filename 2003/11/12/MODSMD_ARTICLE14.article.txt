A thanks for
community support

Vicki and I would like to thank
the Stanford community for its ef
forts and incredible generosity in
helping us find a bone marrow
donor for our daughter, Chloe.
You touched us deeply and
strengthened our faith in humani
ty. When we briefly visited the
typing site in White Plaza on Oct.
30 and 31, we were moved to tears,
seeing the many volunteers and
potential donors. So many of you
stood in line for more than an
hour in the cold rain. It was a
scene we will never forget. We
know your efforts will help Chloe
or someone else in great need.
Chloe is doing well, but we
don't yet know what kind of fur
ther treatment she will need be
fore the transplant. In addition to
the hundreds who were typed,
helped organize the drive or con
tributed in other ways, we would
like to give special thanks to the
Lambda Phi Epsilon Fraternity,
Provost John Etchemendy, Vice
Provost LaDoris Cordell, Shirley
Everett and Stanford Dining Ser
vices, the Asian American Activi

Editorial makes light of
international-student situation

The editorial "Foreign students
not treated fairly" (Nov. 11) illus
trates the unfair treatments that
international students have been
receiving in the country. The new
Student and Exchange Visitor In
formation System (SEVIS) devel
oped by the Department of
Homeland Security has posed un
necessary concerns for interna
tional students, who pour in mil
lions of dollars each year to the
United States. The $lOO fee re
quired for the setup of the
database system is unjustified.
Imagine that you were a student
from a developing country in
Africa or Asia, who barely raised
enough money to support your tu
ition and living expenses for your
degree in the States. Everything in
United States is already 10 or even
100 times more expensive that
what it costs in your home coun
try. Now, you need to shell out an
other $lOO to pay for the database
fee. You shouldn't be surprised if
one exclaims, "Give me a break! I
just want to study in the States."
The avoidable financial burden
created by the SEVIS to Interna
tional students is not an isolated
incident. International students
have to return to their "home"
country to renew their student
visa, instead of going to Canada or
Mexico to get the paper work
done. There are cases at Stanford
that students have to defer their
admissions because they cannot
get a visa from the United States
embassy aboard. You have no
idea how much you need to pay
just to submit the application for a
visa. In my home country, Hong
Kong, you need to pay around
HK$BOO (about $100) just to sub
mit your visa application for con
sideration. The cost of applying
for a visa has doubled since I first
came to the States in 1995. Every
one applying for a visa also needs
to go through a humiliating expe
rience with the staff at the em
bassy. They "interrogate" you to a
point which makes you feel like
that you committed a crime or
something.
International students also
have to face unjust treatments in
employments (because of the citi
zenship requirements) and in day
to-day living. How many times did
you get yelled at because you
didn't speak with an American ac
cent? How many times did you get
ignored because no one could un
derstand what you said? The sug
gestion is, sorry international stu
dents no one has the patience
here to listen to you. Go to take a
class at De Anza or hire a lan
guage coach (if you can afford to

pay $lOO per hour) to learn a bet
ter accent (I think the London
type British accent is well-re
ceived here.)
My dear fellow students, I chal
lenge all of you to spend some
time talking to some international
students. Let them know that they
come here for a reason to learn
from you and to give you some
thing to learn. It's a social ex
change relationship that rewards
are always overlooked or taken
for granted.
I just want to study and work.
Leave me alone. Dear Americans,
show me the love.

Editorial on international stu
dents got facts wrong

While I am grateful to the sup
port shown by The Daily for the
challenges faced by international
students at Stanford, the editorial
"Foreign students not treated fair
ly" (Nov. 11) was so full of errors
as to mystify the message. To pro
vide an editorial on such an im
portant issue that begins with a
major factual error is depressing
enough. To read the rest of the ed
itorial and find almost no back
ground on the SEVIS fee does a
disservice to those who hope for
reasonable reporting from The
Daily.
First, the Student and Ex
change Visitor Information Sys
tem was not introduced last week
by the Department of Homeland
Security. It has been active since
January and was mandated in the
1996 Immigration Act. Stanford
has been using SEVIS since the
end of January 2003. Even a casu
al glance at past issues of The
Daily would have clarified this.
What was announced last week
was a proposed rule on the fee
level that would be charged to in
ternational students and scholars
to fund SEVIS on an ongoing
basis, as opposed to the Congres
sional funding of $3B million that
provided start up costs after Sept.
11, 2001. This fee was also man
dated in the 1996 act; what the rule
does is suggest a cost for this fee
($lOO per student and exchange
visitor which is the maximum al
lowed by law) and proposes cer
tain collection mechanisms. The
editorial states that "Stanford of
ficials have not yet released an
opinion on this extra fee." In fact,
Stanford and other institutions of
higher education did comment on
this fee in the mid-19905, suggest
ing that the cost of the system be
federally funded and providing
comments on how the fee should
be collected. But what is impor
tant to note is that the proposed
rule of last week was not asking
for comments on whether there
should be a fee but rather on the
cost of the fee and its means of col
lection. The fee has been autho
rized by Congress since 1996 and
no one that I have spoken to
thinks it will go away, no matter
what we might wish. The proposed
rule of last week allows a com
ment period of 60 days.
At issue is how we can best ar
ticulate the needs of international
students post-Sept. 11. This is not
an issue of our own beliefs or
whether we think something is fair
or unfair; rather it is a need to look
at the possibilities for doing all we
can to ensure that international
students can still come to Stanford
and face as few obstacles as possi
ble in doing so. As many students
know from personal experience, it
is now a difficult journey to get
from their home to Stanford.
Many colleagues that I have
worked with over the years
around the United States are
struggling with this new reality of
international educational ex
change and how we may continue
to support students and comply
with federal legislation.
I do agree with the sentiment of
the editorial that links the en
hanced security measures with the
welcome provided to internation
al students. International students
are a remarkable resources for
this campus (and Stanford has
conveyed this message numerous
times to members of Congress)
and this country and I, speaking
personally, am concerned that the
United States will not be per
ceived as such an attractive place
to study. But where did The Daily

get the idea that " these higher re
strictions have directly affected
Stanford, with the University hav
ing seen no increase in interna
tional student applications since
1999." I am sure I didn't say this to
the writer of the editorial. In fact
applications from international
students have increased each year
since 1999 (certainly at the gradu
ate level and I suspect at the un
dergraduate level as well). Total
international student numbers at
Stanford have also increased each
year since 1999. But that is not re
ally the point. The data that is im
portant is what is happening to the
enrollment of new students from
overseas each year and what is
happening to the distribution of
new students by country of origin.
I hope to have this data in some
readable form just after Thanks
giving.

Reader criticizes
Shacham's letter

It has been dismaying to read
the distortions and half-truths
contained in the recent spate of
letters to the Daily defending Is
rael's actions. An example is
Matan Shacham's reference to
Rachel Corrie in "Letters to the
editor," (Nov. 11), the young
American woman who was
crushed to death by an Israeli bull
dozer in Gaza. According to
Shacham, Corrie had purposefully
entered a war-zone and was work
ing actively to disrupt legitimate
military activities. In fact, there
was nothing "legitimate" about Is
rael's military activities in Gaza or
even the army's presence there.
Israeli forces have turned the
Gaza Strip into a war zone in
order to protect the 6,000 Jewish
settlers who have taken over the
most fertile territory and use a dis
proportionate share of the exist
ing water, while 2 million Pales
tinians are crowded into refugee
camps where their every move
ment is restricted, water is danger
ously scarce, and their children
suffer from severe malnutrition.
The settlements that Israel is pro
tecting are in violation of interna
tional law and have long been de
clared illegal by the United Na
tions. What Rachel Corrie was
doing when she was killed was
standing in front of a Palestinian
family's home, in full view of the
bulldozer operator, in an effort to
prevent its destruction. This was
admittedly a Quixotic act since ac
cording to the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, the Israelis have demol
ished 10,000 Palestinians homes in
the West Bank and Gaza since
1967, including 3,000 in the past
three years. All but a few hundred
were torn down to make way for
settlements or the highways that
serve them. What one would
never know from the letters is that
Israel is occupying Palestinian
land in defiance of repeated Unit
ed Nations resolutions and has for
years been building settlements
and highways (for Jewish use
only) to prevent a return of that
land. Israel is now constructing
giant wall in the West Bank that
will isolate Palestinian communi
ties from one another, divide fam
ilies, and deprive thousands of
Palestinian farmers of their land
and water.
The bloodshed on both sides
during the past three years has
been tragic, but it is certain to
continue as long as Palestinians
have no hope of a just peace. The
vast majority of Palestinians,
along with many Israelis, are
willing to accept peace based on
Israel's return to its 1967 bor
ders. Contrary to repeated
claims, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak did not make such
an offer at Camp David in 2000,
but a group of prominent Israelis
and Palestinians has now en
dorsed a plan known as the
Geneva Accord that recognizes
Israel as a state of the Jewish
people, and allows for a viable
Palestinian state in most of the
West Bank and Gaza. Since a
just solution to the conflict
would be to Israel's benefit as
well as the Palestinians, I hope
those who so fervently defend Is
rael will support it.

at the possibilities for doing all we
can to ensure that international
students can still come to Stanford
and face as few obstacles as possi
ble in doing so. As many students
know from personal experience, it
is now a difficult journey to get
from their home to Stanford.
Many colleagues that I have
worked with over the years
around the United States are
struggling with this new reality of
international educational ex
change and how we may continue
to support students and comply
with federal legislation.
I do agree with the sentiment of
the editorial that links the en
hanced security measures with the
welcome provided to internation
al students. International students
are a remarkable resources for
this campus (and Stanford has
conveyed this message numerous
times to members of Congress)
and this country and I, speaking
personally, am concerned that the
United States will not be per
ceived as such an attractive place
to study. But where did The Daily

get the idea that " these higher re
strictions have directly affected
Stanford, with the University hav
ing seen no increase in interna
tional student applications since
1999." I am sure I didn't say this to
the writer of the editorial. In fact
applications from international
students have increased each year
since 1999 (certainly at the gradu
ate level and I suspect at the un
dergraduate level as well). Total
international student numbers at
Stanford have also increased each
year since 1999. But that is not re
ally the point. The data that is im

enrollment of new students from
overseas each year and what is

I hope to have this data in some

Reader criticizes
Shacham's letter

It has been dismaying to read
the distortions and half-truths
contained in the recent spate of
letters to the Daily defending Is
rael's actions. An example is
Matan Shacham's reference to
Rachel Corrie in "Letters to the
editor," (Nov. 11), the young
American woman who was
crushed to death by an Israeli bull
dozer in Gaza. According to
Shacham, Corrie had purposefully
entered a war-zone and was work
ing actively to disrupt legitimate
military activities. In fact, there
was nothing "legitimate" about Is
rael's military activities in Gaza or
even the army's presence there.
Israeli forces have turned the
Gaza Strip into a war zone in
order to protect the 6,000 Jewish
settlers who have taken over the
most fertile territory and use a dis
proportionate share of the exist
ing water, while 2 million Pales
tinians are crowded into refugee
camps where their every move
ment is restricted, water is danger
ously scarce, and their children
suffer from severe malnutrition.
The settlements that Israel is pro
tecting are in violation of interna
tional law and have long been de
clared illegal by the United Na
tions. What Rachel Corrie was
doing when she was killed was
standing in front of a Palestinian
family's home, in full view of the
bulldozer operator, in an effort to
prevent its destruction. This was
admittedly a Quixotic act since ac
cording to the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, the Israelis have demol
ished 10,000 Palestinians homes in
the West Bank and Gaza since
1967, including 3,000 in the past
three years. All but a few hundred
were torn down to make way for
settlements or the highways that
serve them. What one would
never know from the letters is that
Israel is occupying Palestinian
land in defiance of repeated Unit
ed Nations resolutions and has for
years been building settlements
and highways (for Jewish use
only) to prevent a return of that
land. Israel is now constructing
giant wall in the West Bank that
will isolate Palestinian communi
ties from one another, divide fam
ilies, and deprive thousands of
Palestinian farmers of their land
and water.
The bloodshed on both sides
during the past three years has
been tragic, but it is certain to
continue as long as Palestinians
have no hope of a just peace. The
vast majority of Palestinians,
along with many Israelis, are
willing to accept peace based on
Israel's return to its 1967 bor
ders. Contrary to repeated
claims, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak did not make such
an offer at Camp David in 2000,
but a group of prominent Israelis
and Palestinians has now en
dorsed a plan known as the
Geneva Accord that recognizes
Israel as a state of the Jewish
people, and allows for a viable
Palestinian state in most of the
West Bank and Gaza. Since a
just solution to the conflict
would be to Israel's benefit as
well as the Palestinians, I hope
those who so fervently defend Is
rael will support it.

Chloe is doing well, but we

Editorial makes light of
international-student situation

The editorial "Foreign students
not treated fairly" (Nov. 11) illus
trates the unfair treatments that
international students have been
receiving in the country. The new
Student and Exchange Visitor In
formation System (SEVIS) devel
oped by the Department of
Homeland Security has posed un
necessary concerns for interna
tional students, who pour in mil
lions of dollars each year to the
United States. The $lOO fee re
quired for the setup of the
database system is unjustified.
Imagine that you were a student
from a developing country in
Africa or Asia, who barely raised
enough money to support your tu
ition and living expenses for your
degree in the States. Everything in
United States is already 10 or even
100 times more expensive that
what it costs in your home coun
try. Now, you need to shell out an
other $lOO to pay for the database
fee. You shouldn't be surprised if
one exclaims, "Give me a break! I
just want to study in the States."
The avoidable financial burden
created by the SEVIS to Interna
tional students is not an isolated
incident. International students
have to return to their "home"
country to renew their student
visa, instead of going to Canada or
Mexico to get the paper work
done. There are cases at Stanford
that students have to defer their
admissions because they cannot
get a visa from the United States
embassy aboard. You have no
idea how much you need to pay
just to submit the application for a
visa. In my home country, Hong
Kong, you need to pay around
HK$BOO (about $100) just to sub
mit your visa application for con
sideration. The cost of applying
for a visa has doubled since I first
came to the States in 1995. Every
one applying for a visa also needs
to go through a humiliating expe
rience with the staff at the em
bassy. They "interrogate" you to a
point which makes you feel like
that you committed a crime or
something.
International students also
have to face unjust treatments in
employments (because of the citi
zenship requirements) and in day
to-day living. How many times did
you get yelled at because you
didn't speak with an American ac
cent? How many times did you get
ignored because no one could un
derstand what you said? The sug
gestion is, sorry international stu
dents no one has the patience
here to listen to you. Go to take a
class at De Anza or hire a lan
guage coach (if you can afford to

pay $lOO per hour) to learn a bet
ter accent (I think the London
type British accent is well-re
ceived here.)
My dear fellow students, I chal
lenge all of you to spend some
time talking to some international
students. Let them know that they
come here for a reason to learn
from you and to give you some
thing to learn. It's a social ex
change relationship that rewards
are always overlooked or taken
for granted.
I just want to study and work.
Leave me alone. Dear Americans,
show me the love.

Editorial on international stu
dents got facts wrong

While I am grateful to the sup
port shown by The Daily for the
challenges faced by international
students at Stanford, the editorial
"Foreign students not treated fair
ly" (Nov. 11) was so full of errors
as to mystify the message. To pro
vide an editorial on such an im
portant issue that begins with a
major factual error is depressing
enough. To read the rest of the ed
itorial and find almost no back
ground on the SEVIS fee does a
disservice to those who hope for
reasonable reporting from The
Daily.
First, the Student and Ex
change Visitor Information Sys
tem was not introduced last week
by the Department of Homeland
Security. It has been active since
January and was mandated in the
1996 Immigration Act. Stanford
has been using SEVIS since the
end of January 2003. Even a casu
al glance at past issues of The
Daily would have clarified this.
What was announced last week
was a proposed rule on the fee
level that would be charged to in
ternational students and scholars
to fund SEVIS on an ongoing
basis, as opposed to the Congres
sional funding of $3B million that
provided start up costs after Sept.
11, 2001. This fee was also man
dated in the 1996 act; what the rule
does is suggest a cost for this fee
($lOO per student and exchange
visitor which is the maximum al
lowed by law) and proposes cer
tain collection mechanisms. The
editorial states that "Stanford of
ficials have not yet released an
opinion on this extra fee." In fact,
Stanford and other institutions of
higher education did comment on
this fee in the mid-19905, suggest
ing that the cost of the system be
federally funded and providing
comments on how the fee should
be collected. But what is impor
tant to note is that the proposed
rule of last week was not asking
for comments on whether there
should be a fee but rather on the
cost of the fee and its means of col
lection. The fee has been autho
rized by Congress since 1996 and
no one that I have spoken to
thinks it will go away, no matter
what we might wish. The proposed
rule of last week allows a com
ment period of 60 days.
At issue is how we can best ar
ticulate the needs of international
students post-Sept. 11. This is not
an issue of our own beliefs or
whether we think something is fair
or unfair; rather it is a need to look
at the possibilities for doing all we
can to ensure that international
students can still come to Stanford
and face as few obstacles as possi
ble in doing so. As many students
know from personal experience, it
is now a difficult journey to get
from their home to Stanford.
Many colleagues that I have

what it costs in your home coun
try. Now, you need to shell out an
other $lOO to pay for the database
fee. You shouldn't be surprised if
one exclaims, "Give me a break! I
just want to study in the States."
The avoidable financial burden
created by the SEVIS to Interna
tional students is not an isolated
incident. International students
have to return to their "home"
country to renew their student
visa, instead of going to Canada or
Mexico to get the paper work
done. There are cases at Stanford
that students have to defer their
admissions because they cannot
get a visa from the United States
embassy aboard. You have no
idea how much you need to pay
just to submit the application for a
visa. In my home country, Hong
Kong, you need to pay around
HK$BOO (about $100) just to sub
mit your visa application for con
sideration. The cost of applying
for a visa has doubled since I first
came to the States in 1995. Every
one applying for a visa also needs
to go through a humiliating expe
rience with the staff at the em
bassy. They "interrogate" you to a
point which makes you feel like
that you committed a crime or
something.
International students also
have to face unjust treatments in
employments (because of the citi
zenship requirements) and in day
to-day living. How many times did
you get yelled at because you
didn't speak with an American ac
cent? How many times did you get
ignored because no one could un
derstand what you said? The sug
gestion is, sorry international stu
dents no one has the patience
here to listen to you. Go to take a
class at De Anza or hire a lan
guage coach (if you can afford to

pay $lOO per hour) to learn a bet
ter accent (I think the London
type British accent is well-re
ceived here.)
My dear fellow students, I chal
lenge all of you to spend some
time talking to some international
students. Let them know that they
come here for a reason to learn
from you and to give you some
thing to learn. It's a social ex
change relationship that rewards
are always overlooked or taken
for granted.
I just want to study and work.
Leave me alone. Dear Americans,
show me the love.

Editorial on international stu
dents got facts wrong

While I am grateful to the sup
port shown by The Daily for the
challenges faced by international
students at Stanford, the editorial
"Foreign students not treated fair
ly" (Nov. 11) was so full of errors
as to mystify the message. To pro
vide an editorial on such an im
portant issue that begins with a
major factual error is depressing
enough. To read the rest of the ed
itorial and find almost no back
ground on the SEVIS fee does a
disservice to those who hope for
reasonable reporting from The
Daily.
First, the Student and Ex
change Visitor Information Sys
tem was not introduced last week
by the Department of Homeland
Security. It has been active since
January and was mandated in the
1996 Immigration Act. Stanford
has been using SEVIS since the
end of January 2003. Even a casu
al glance at past issues of The
Daily would have clarified this.
What was announced last week
was a proposed rule on the fee
level that would be charged to in
ternational students and scholars
to fund SEVIS on an ongoing
basis, as opposed to the Congres
sional funding of $3B million that
provided start up costs after Sept.
11, 2001. This fee was also man
dated in the 1996 act; what the rule
does is suggest a cost for this fee
($lOO per student and exchange
visitor which is the maximum al
lowed by law) and proposes cer
tain collection mechanisms. The
editorial states that "Stanford of
ficials have not yet released an
opinion on this extra fee." In fact,
Stanford and other institutions of
higher education did comment on
this fee in the mid-19905, suggest
ing that the cost of the system be
federally funded and providing
comments on how the fee should
be collected. But what is impor
tant to note is that the proposed
rule of last week was not asking
for comments on whether there
should be a fee but rather on the
cost of the fee and its means of col
lection. The fee has been autho
rized by Congress since 1996 and
no one that I have spoken to
thinks it will go away, no matter
what we might wish. The proposed
rule of last week allows a com
ment period of 60 days.
At issue is how we can best ar
ticulate the needs of international
students post-Sept. 11. This is not
an issue of our own beliefs or
whether we think something is fair
or unfair; rather it is a need to look
at the possibilities for doing all we
can to ensure that international
students can still come to Stanford
and face as few obstacles as possi
ble in doing so. As many students
know from personal experience, it
is now a difficult journey to get
from their home to Stanford.
Many colleagues that I have
worked with over the years
around the United States are
struggling with this new reality of
international educational ex
change and how we may continue
to support students and comply
with federal legislation.
I do agree with the sentiment of
the editorial that links the en
hanced security measures with the
welcome provided to internation
al students. International students
are a remarkable resources for
this campus (and Stanford has
conveyed this message numerous
times to members of Congress)
and this country and I, speaking
personally, am concerned that the
United States will not be per
ceived as such an attractive place
to study. But where did The Daily

get the idea that " these higher re
strictions have directly affected
Stanford, with the University hav
ing seen no increase in interna
tional student applications since
1999." I am sure I didn't say this to
the writer of the editorial. In fact
applications from international
students have increased each year
since 1999 (certainly at the gradu
ate level and I suspect at the un
dergraduate level as well). Total
international student numbers at
Stanford have also increased each
year since 1999. But that is not re
ally the point. The data that is im
portant is what is happening to the
enrollment of new students from
overseas each year and what is
happening to the distribution of
new students by country of origin.
I hope to have this data in some
readable form just after Thanks
giving.

Reader criticizes
Shacham's letter

It has been dismaying to read
the distortions and half-truths
contained in the recent spate of
letters to the Daily defending Is
rael's actions. An example is
Matan Shacham's reference to
Rachel Corrie in "Letters to the
editor," (Nov. 11), the young
American woman who was
crushed to death by an Israeli bull
dozer in Gaza. According to
Shacham, Corrie had purposefully
entered a war-zone and was work
ing actively to disrupt legitimate
military activities. In fact, there
was nothing "legitimate" about Is
rael's military activities in Gaza or
even the army's presence there.
Israeli forces have turned the
Gaza Strip into a war zone in
order to protect the 6,000 Jewish
settlers who have taken over the
most fertile territory and use a dis
proportionate share of the exist
ing water, while 2 million Pales
tinians are crowded into refugee
camps where their every move
ment is restricted, water is danger
ously scarce, and their children
suffer from severe malnutrition.
The settlements that Israel is pro
tecting are in violation of interna
tional law and have long been de
clared illegal by the United Na
tions. What Rachel Corrie was
doing when she was killed was
standing in front of a Palestinian
family's home, in full view of the
bulldozer operator, in an effort to
prevent its destruction. This was
admittedly a Quixotic act since ac
cording to the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, the Israelis have demol
ished 10,000 Palestinians homes in
the West Bank and Gaza since
1967, including 3,000 in the past
three years. All but a few hundred
were torn down to make way for
settlements or the highways that
serve them. What one would
never know from the letters is that
Israel is occupying Palestinian
land in defiance of repeated Unit
ed Nations resolutions and has for
years been building settlements
and highways (for Jewish use
only) to prevent a return of that
land. Israel is now constructing
giant wall in the West Bank that
will isolate Palestinian communi
ties from one another, divide fam
ilies, and deprive thousands of
Palestinian farmers of their land
and water.
The bloodshed on both sides
during the past three years has
been tragic, but it is certain to
continue as long as Palestinians
have no hope of a just peace. The
vast majority of Palestinians,
along with many Israelis, are
willing to accept peace based on
Israel's return to its 1967 bor
ders. Contrary to repeated
claims, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak did not make such
an offer at Camp David in 2000,
but a group of prominent Israelis
and Palestinians has now en
dorsed a plan known as the
Geneva Accord that recognizes
Israel as a state of the Jewish
people, and allows for a viable
Palestinian state in most of the
West Bank and Gaza. Since a
just solution to the conflict
would be to Israel's benefit as
well as the Palestinians, I hope
those who so fervently defend Is
rael will support it.

A thanks for
community support

Vicki and I would like to thank
the Stanford community for its ef
forts and incredible generosity in
helping us find a bone marrow
donor for our daughter, Chloe.
You touched us deeply and
strengthened our faith in humani
ty. When we briefly visited the
typing site in White Plaza on Oct.
30 and 31, we were moved to tears,
seeing the many volunteers and
potential donors. So many of you
stood in line for more than an
hour in the cold rain. It was a
scene we will never forget. We
know your efforts will help Chloe
or someone else in great need.
Chloe is doing well, but we
don't yet know what kind of fur
ther treatment she will need be
fore the transplant. In addition to
the hundreds who were typed,
helped organize the drive or con
tributed in other ways, we would
like to give special thanks to the
Lambda Phi Epsilon Fraternity,
Provost John Etchemendy, Vice
Provost LaDoris Cordell, Shirley
Everett and Stanford Dining Ser
vices, the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the Stanford Asian
Pacific American Alumni Club,

Editorial makes light of
international-student situation

The editorial "Foreign students
not treated fairly" (Nov. 11) illus
trates the unfair treatments that
international students have been
receiving in the country. The new
Student and Exchange Visitor In
formation System (SEVIS) devel
oped by the Department of
Homeland Security has posed un
necessary concerns for interna
tional students, who pour in mil
lions of dollars each year to the
United States. The $lOO fee re
quired for the setup of the
database system is unjustified.
Imagine that you were a student
from a developing country in
Africa or Asia, who barely raised
enough money to support your tu
ition and living expenses for your
degree in the States. Everything in
United States is already 10 or even
100 times more expensive that
what it costs in your home coun
try. Now, you need to shell out an
other $lOO to pay for the database
fee. You shouldn't be surprised if
one exclaims, "Give me a break! I
just want to study in the States."
The avoidable financial burden
created by the SEVIS to Interna
tional students is not an isolated
incident. International students
have to return to their "home"
country to renew their student
visa, instead of going to Canada or
Mexico to get the paper work
done. There are cases at Stanford
that students have to defer their
admissions because they cannot
get a visa from the United States
embassy aboard. You have no
idea how much you need to pay
just to submit the application for a
visa. In my home country, Hong
Kong, you need to pay around
HK$BOO (about $100) just to sub

for a visa has doubled since I first

one applying for a visa also needs
to go through a humiliating expe
rience with the staff at the em
bassy. They "interrogate" you to a
point which makes you feel like
that you committed a crime or
something.
International students also
have to face unjust treatments in
employments (because of the citi
zenship requirements) and in day
to-day living. How many times did
you get yelled at because you
didn't speak with an American ac
