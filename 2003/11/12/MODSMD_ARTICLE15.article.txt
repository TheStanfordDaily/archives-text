# OP-ED
## Class, parties and politics; never religion 
### JASON FANG 
While chatting with a friend at the
University of Florida over the week
end, I learned that the very same
street preachers that came to our
campus on Thursday had similarly
visited his college. Like me, my
friend had confronted them over the
message they were preaching, with
the opinion that they were not only
preaching a false message, but also
misrepresenting Christianity as a
whole. And likewise, the two street
preachers did not entertain my
friend's concerns.
I had already intended to engage
the preachers in conversation having
seen their condemnatory signs while
biking by earlier in the day, but what
compelled me to address them was
their hurtful verbal attack on a stu
dent, whom I do not believe meant
them any ill will. Within five minutes
of my intervention, I was paraded
before the crowd as a "hypocrite"
and a "heel-biter," as someone who
was disgraceful and (I might infer)
evil. I had made no statements at all,
much less any that I could have been
hypocritical about. My attempts to
defend myself proved futile, and it
soon became clear to me that I was
merely being used to further their
agenda; that they would not be al
lowing me the dignity of finishing a
sentence without it being hijacked
for their purposes.
I believe that many students
sensed this same sort of frustration:
that they were not actually talking
with these so-called Christians, but
rather, being talked at by them. In
the aftermath of the incident, I heard
many comments about how people
had not stopped to converse with

them, simply because they already
knew that they would not actually be
afforded a real conversation. In
stead, they would be subjected to a
religious diatribe that would do little
to further their understanding of
Christianity.
There appears to be an interest
ing dichotomy here on campus when
it comes to religion. While I am
aware of the many endeavors that
the Office of Religious Studies and
the campus' various religious groups
make to foster and facilitate dis
course, I rarely see it occurring on an
informal basis. There are times when
I believe that the subject of religion
is a taboo that few dare to broach, for
fear of offending those who might
have different (and potentially disso
nant) beliefs. The majority of Stan
ford students, I have noticed, appear
open to discussing a vast majority of
topics at the dinner table the tri
als and tribulations of their classes,
the humorous and captivating sto
ries of dorm life, national and global
politics, gender and cultural diversi
ty .. . but seldom religion. In its
place is an eerie silence a sense
that there is an integral element of
education missing from the venues
in which they should be most evi
dent.
On the other end of the spectrum,
there are the various forums, lec
tures and fellowships that present
and examine different beliefs; the
formal structures that students are
invited to explore should they so
please. Students are free to compare
and contrast religious viewpoints at
their own pace, in what generally is a
safe, intellectually stimulating envi
ronment.

And yet there doesn't seem to be

any middle ground between these
two extremes. Religion isn't a casual
subject at Stanford. In consideration
and sensitivity towards others' be
liefs, I have found students politely
avoiding discourse over the subject
of belief, ensuring that no tensions
arise out of religious disagreement..
. but also none of the valuable learn
ing that dialectical conversation
could produce.
So instead, street preachers be
come a spectacle, magnets for the
questions and curiosities that we har
bor about religion, but cannot al
ways comfortably ask fellow stu
dents. Given the abusive and impos
ing answers that students received in
exchange for their honest queries
last Thursday, I find that a little sad.
On Friday, I set up a little stand in
White Plaza, inviting people to "Ask
a Christian . . . anything." A few
people did oblige, and I tried to an
swer their questions as frankly and
clearly as I could, from the stand
point of what I believed in. Nothing
more. I think they appreciated how
at my little stand, they wouldn't be
persuaded to believe in what I be
lieved, but could simply learn of
what I believed. I hope they also had
the sense that I was interested in
learning what they believed; that I
would have enjoyed actually com
paring viewpoints with them.

Junior Jason Fang has found that
some of his most enjoyable conversa
tions began with a simple question
asked out of the blue. So feel free to ask
him one if you see him seated beside a
poorly designed sign in White Plaza
playing his guitar. Or email him at
