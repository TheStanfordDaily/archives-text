# NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER
## The 						Runner's High 
### 
Beep. Beep. Beep. You're
snuggled up in your nice,
warm, comfy bed when
your roommate's dreadful,
loud alarm goes off. You open up a
red eye and squint at the clock: It is
only 6 a.m.! Why, you ask yourself,
would anyone in their right mind
wake up at this ungodly hour? She
struggles out of bed, whips on some
clothes, laces up her shoes and
sprints out the door. Damn those
runners, you think.
Sorry, but you won't get any
sympathy from me. You're out of
luck I'm one of those damn run
ners along with a very dedicated
bunch here with me in Australia.
When everyone else is in bed,
dreading having to wake up at 7 or 8
a.m. to start the day's planned activ
ities, we'll be outside. Wherever
that may be: cities, beaches, country
roads, you can be sure we're going
on our daily run. I'm quite im
pressed with our group of runners; it
is definitely harder to motivate
yourself to go out and run when
you're in a strange land and when
you often feel like you're on vaca
tion (at least weather and location
wise). Then again, this isn't an unfa
miliar scene on the Stanford campus
I've seen people running at every
possible time of the day, on every
day of the week. There's something
about the Stanford personality that
lends itself very well to running.
However, if you haven't jumped
on the bandwagon and never under
stood why anyone would subject
themselves to what you may consid
er daily abuse, I'll try to enlighten
you on the runner's mindset:
Even though it can be hellish
waking up at the crack of dawn (I
don't think a single runner in our
group is overjoyed at the thought of
hitting the pavement first thing in
the morning, but with the hectically
packed schedules we're often sub
jected to here in the Australia pro
gram, the wee morning hours may
be the only time we can squeeze in
some running time), there's nothing

like seeing a city slowly coming to
life or running through country
roads in the crisp, quiet morning.
Running on a beach when the soft
dawn still colors the sky or when the
birds are chirping their first few
songs in the rainforest the re
wards are worth every step.
It may also be the only time of
the day you get wholly to yourself,
keeping you from going "tropo" (a
serious malady that affects those
who've spent too long in the tropics
or too much time with other like
minded overachievers) and allow
ing you to reflect on life's existential
questions. At Stanford, running
serves the same purpose, permitting
one to run away figuratively and

literally from
stand spending
anot^er m * nute * n
for a run and re
]ease some
steam?

Then there's the famous "run
ner's high." Can you really get a
high from running? Or is it all sim
ply a scam your P.E. teacher tried to
pull on you in middle school to get
you to run the mile? Here are my
observations, you can decide for
yourself: I can definitely tell when
my fellow runner buddies have gone
running that day. They emit a warm,
healthy glow and the expression on
their face is of serene peace. My ver
dict? Perhaps it's the "runner's
high," perhaps it's the feeling of
achievement and satisfaction one
gets after a completing a great run.
Bad news is, just like any very
good thing, one can become addict
ed. Non-runners, I understand if
you fail to completely conceive this
idea. I know you're wondering, how
could any sane person possibly get
addicted to hard, physical exertion?

Trust me, it is perfectly plausible.
Here's a quick run-through the
symptoms: You know you're ad
dicted when you haven't gone run
ning in a few days and you're feeling
antsy and cranky. You watch others
come back from their run, sweaty
and glowing, and you feel as though
you're eating guilt rather than
Cheerios for breakfast that morn
ing. You'll push yourself to run on
days when you're body simply cries
out for some rest.
Well, rest assured, there is help.
Go back to the reason you started
running and re-evaluate. Running
shouldn't be painful, nor should you
dread getting up every morning
with the idea that you have to run.
Running should be fun at least
most of the time. I'd be lying if I
didn't admit that I've gone on "junk
runs," where I certainly haven't felt
my best and probably should have
taken it easier, but, hey, nobody's
perfect.
Running isn't for everyone
some people are better suited for
other sports, and kudos to you for
recognizing that and doing what you
like best. You may have tried run
ning and absolutely hated it, but
also remember that it takes a little
time to get your muscles and lungs
accustomed to running. Give it an
other try, and, hey, maybe I'll see
you doing the Campus Drive loop
when I come back winter quarter.
Lastly, though, I'm glad to be
part of the group of runners on the
trip. I think running links us all in
some way: We chat about the scenic
places one can go for a run, and I
know some friendships have formed
through our devotion to running.
I'm really not looking forward to
waking up at 5:45 a.m. tomorrow
morning, but I know that as soon as
I'm warmed up, it will be worth the
effort.

like seeing a city slowly coming to
life or running through country
roads in the crisp, quiet morning.
Running on a beach when the soft
dawn still colors the sky or when the
birds are chirping their first few
songs in the rainforest the re
wards are worth every step.
It may also be the only time of
the day you get wholly to yourself,
keeping you from going "tropo" (a
serious malady that affects those
who've spent too long in the tropics
or too much time with other like
minded overachievers) and allow
ing you to reflect on life's existential
questions. At Stanford, running
serves the same purpose, permitting
one to run away figuratively and

literally from
stand spending
anot^er m * nute * n
for a run and re
]ease some
steam?

Then there's the famous "run
ner's high." Can you really get a
high from running? Or is it all sim
ply a scam your P.E. teacher tried to
pull on you in middle school to get
you to run the mile? Here are my
observations, you can decide for
yourself: I can definitely tell when
my fellow runner buddies have gone
running that day. They emit a warm,
healthy glow and the expression on
their face is of serene peace. My ver
dict? Perhaps it's the "runner's
high," perhaps it's the feeling of
achievement and satisfaction one
gets after a completing a great run.
Bad news is, just like any very
good thing, one can become addict
ed. Non-runners, I understand if
you fail to completely conceive this
idea. I know you're wondering, how
could any sane person possibly get
addicted to hard, physical exertion?

Trust me, it is perfectly plausible.
Here's a quick run-through the
symptoms: You know you're ad
dicted when you haven't gone run
ning in a few days and you're feeling
antsy and cranky. You watch others
come back from their run, sweaty
and glowing, and you feel as though
you're eating guilt rather than
Cheerios for breakfast that morn
ing. You'll push yourself to run on
days when you're body simply cries
out for some rest.
Well, rest assured, there is help.
Go back to the reason you started
running and re-evaluate. Running
shouldn't be painful, nor should you
dread getting up every morning
with the idea that you have to run.
Running should be fun at least
most of the time. I'd be lying if I
didn't admit that I've gone on "junk
runs," where I certainly haven't felt
my best and probably should have
taken it easier, but, hey, nobody's
perfect.
Running isn't for everyone
some people are better suited for
other sports, and kudos to you for
recognizing that and doing what you
like best. You may have tried run
ning and absolutely hated it, but
also remember that it takes a little
time to get your muscles and lungs
accustomed to running. Give it an
other try, and, hey, maybe I'll see
you doing the Campus Drive loop
when I come back winter quarter.
Lastly, though, I'm glad to be
part of the group of runners on the
trip. I think running links us all in
some way: We chat about the scenic
places one can go for a run, and I
know some friendships have formed
through our devotion to running.
I'm really not looking forward to
waking up at 5:45 a.m. tomorrow
morning, but I know that as soon as
I'm warmed up, it will be worth the
effort.

Beep. Beep. Beep. You're
snuggled up in your nice,
warm, comfy bed when
your roommate's dreadful,
loud alarm goes off. You open up a
red eye and squint at the clock: It is
only 6 a.m.! Why, you ask yourself,
would anyone in their right mind
wake up at this ungodly hour? She
struggles out of bed, whips on some
clothes, laces up her shoes and
sprints out the door. Damn those
runners, you think.
Sorry, but you won't get any
sympathy from me. You're out of
luck I'm one of those damn run
ners along with a very dedicated
bunch here with me in Australia.
When everyone else is in bed,
dreading having to wake up at 7 or 8
a.m. to start the day's planned activ
ities, we'll be outside. Wherever
that may be: cities, beaches, country
roads, you can be sure we're going
on our daily run. I'm quite im
pressed with our group of runners; it
is definitely harder to motivate
yourself to go out and run when
you're in a strange land and when
you often feel like you're on vaca
tion (at least weather and location
wise). Then again, this isn't an unfa
miliar scene on the Stanford campus
I've seen people running at every
possible time of the day, on every
day of the week. There's something
about the Stanford personality that
lends itself very well to running.
However, if you haven't jumped
on the bandwagon and never under
stood why anyone would subject
themselves to what you may consid
er daily abuse, I'll try to enlighten
you on the runner's mindset:
Even though it can be hellish
waking up at the crack of dawn (I
don't think a single runner in our
group is overjoyed at the thought of
hitting the pavement first thing in
the morning, but with the hectically
packed schedules we're often sub
jected to here in the Australia pro
gram, the wee morning hours may
be the only time we can squeeze in
some running time), there's nothing

like seeing a city slowly coming to
life or running through country
roads in the crisp, quiet morning.
Running on a beach when the soft
dawn still colors the sky or when the
birds are chirping their first few
songs in the rainforest the re
wards are worth every step.
