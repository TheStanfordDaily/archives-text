## The 						evolution of athletic equipment 
### 
The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association made national sports head
lines last November when it announced
that baseball state playoff games would be
played strictly with wooden bats. This ruling was an
extension of nationwide decisions made the year
before to reduce metal bat barrel size and weight ra
tios in all senior levels of amateur baseball. The goal
of the reform? To reduce ball speeds coming off
baseball bats and subsequent injuries.
The latest Wilson driver, the Fat Boy, features a
427 cubic centimeter head, an ultra-thin titanium
spring faceplate, an oversized sweet spot to offer
maximum forgiveness on mishit balls, and a gold
graphite spun shaft. Arnold haters everywhere
right now are writing up plans to launch balls
through the bulletproof windows on his Hummer
with the Fat Boy; the club is simply lethal.
In the U.S. Open this past summer, Andy Rod
dick reached 151 miles per hour on his serve. He
was using a Babolat Pure Drive Plus racket, com
posed of Graphite and Kevlar, featuring an over
sized head, and a patented "woofer" system, which

allows the racket to deliver full
potential energy to each ball
strike. Babolat assures that the
racquet is "stiffer, lighter and
more powerful than a traditional
player's racket."
There's no doubt balls flying
off bats, rackets and clubs at light
speed have made sports more
jaw-dropping than ever. Don't
tell me you'd rather see John
Daly lay up on a 340 yard par 4

and hit a nice conservative approach to the green
than drop a Big Bertha tee shot a foot from the cup.
And don't tell me watching your overweight
uncle in his tiny white shorts and aviators tingles
your spine more than a 2,000 miles per hour flaming
laser beam serve from Mark Philapoussis.
And what about watching your kid brother drop
bombs a hundred feet over the little league fence
with his titanium scandium NASA alloy bat like
Mark McGwire without the steroids? You'd rather
see him drop down a sac bunt with no one on and
two outs because the coach knows he couldn't swing
a wooden bat if the ball was on a tee? I thought so.
That's probably been the biggest result of all the
new alloys and technologies: turning Frankie Flynn
into Frank Thomas, Phil "hey Phil" Girbosi into
Phil Mickelson and Petey McNamara into Pete
Sampras. We've now got guys concussing their dou
bles partners in the back of the head off the serve,
guys killing the birds nesting in the trees above the
driving range's 325 yard marker and kids hitting
moonshots over the light towers at the Little
League World Series.
The excitement of doing it like the pros has put
alloy equipment into everyone's hands. Sure, all the
guys at Goldman Sachs would be talking about golf
anyway, but now they're actually doing it on the
course! Danny Almonte loved swining metal bats
so much he tried to stay back a couple years. My
mom called last week to tell me my dad smashed the
dogs' face off while hitting tennis balls at it.
Sure, good for Dad, he's hit the century mark
serving balls at Barky with his Wilson Hammer
racket in their daily game of fetch. But put this same
equipment in the paws of an Andy Roddick and
you've got a seriously dangerous weapon.
At the Battle of the Bridges this past summer
ABC measured the ball speed on Ernie Els' 352
yard drive at 184 miles per hour. The only audible
comment amongst the oohs and ahs came was the
whisper of "Drive for show, putt for dough, big cat"
from a Phil Mickelson who had saved Ins A-game
for the meaningless exhibition event. Big surprise
there.
They say Tiger could pick up a composite driver
that's a wood club and still pound a ball 315
yards. Bjorn Borg could still serve up 21 aces a
match with the high socks, headband and the wood
racket he now keeps as a coaster by the wet bar.
Tennis and golf were struggling among the com
mercial audience, though, right? They needed to
beef up the flash to win over America? Well, where
was baseball in 1980, Mr. Reason? You're gonna sit
there and tell me watching Willie McGee leg out 216
jam shot rollers to shortstop off a pitcher with a piti
fully untamed beard and sandlot windup in 1985 was
exciting? No, okay, you wouldn't. But you didn't see
Candy Maldanado turning around and toting an
Easton Black Magic up to die plate in 1986.
Because the game evolved. The bats have stayed
wooden, but the game has become faster and more
explosive than ever before in history. It's athletic
Darwinism, survival of the fittest athlete. And
who's the fittest? The strongest, fastest, hardest
throwing. See ya later Cecil Cooper, Cecil Espy and
Cecil Fielder.
Every sport's that way. Craig Stadler's not out
there dominating the Seniors Tour by driving the
ball 223 yards and Serena's not kissing champi
onship trophies because she perfected the marsh
mallow fluff serve. These athletes, though, don't
need super alloys to dominate and they never
did. The game will take itself to the next level on its
own if you let it. It's science.
The bottom line is you can extend golf course
lengths to accommodate your longer drives and im
plement laser sensors to determine whether your
baseline forehand was inbounds since you now hit
the ball too hard to see, but you still have to go out
there and win. While amateurs might be reaching
higher skill levels quicker than Dikembe Mutumbo
can swat them down, it's not teaching the pros a
thing but to go out there and kill whatever ball
they're playing with. But they would've gotten to
that point anyway, if they had just let it happen nat
urally like baseball did. So next time your kid broth
er's out practicing his Bonds swing, put a wooden
bat in his hands and tell him he better start evolving
or take up tennis.

than drop a Big Bertha tee shot a foot from the cup.
And don't tell me watching your overweight
uncle in his tiny white shorts and aviators tingles
your spine more than a 2,000 miles per hour flaming
laser beam serve from Mark Philapoussis.
And what about watching your kid brother drop
bombs a hundred feet over the little league fence
with his titanium scandium NASA alloy bat like
Mark McGwire without the steroids? You'd rather
see him drop down a sac bunt with no one on and
two outs because the coach knows he couldn't swing
a wooden bat if the ball was on a tee? I thought so.
That's probably been the biggest result of all the
new alloys and technologies: turning Frankie Flynn
into Frank Thomas, Phil "hey Phil" Girbosi into
Phil Mickelson and Petey McNamara into Pete
Sampras. We've now got guys concussing their dou
bles partners in the back of the head off the serve,
guys killing the birds nesting in the trees above the
driving range's 325 yard marker and kids hitting
moonshots over the light towers at the Little
League World Series.
The excitement of doing it like the pros has put
alloy equipment into everyone's hands. Sure, all the
guys at Goldman Sachs would be talking about golf
anyway, but now they're actually doing it on the
course! Danny Almonte loved swining metal bats
so much he tried to stay back a couple years. My
mom called last week to tell me my dad smashed the
dogs' face off while hitting tennis balls at it.
Sure, good for Dad, he's hit the century mark
serving balls at Barky with his Wilson Hammer
racket in their daily game of fetch. But put this same
equipment in the paws of an Andy Roddick and
you've got a seriously dangerous weapon.
At the Battle of the Bridges this past summer
ABC measured the ball speed on Ernie Els' 352
yard drive at 184 miles per hour. The only audible
comment amongst the oohs and ahs came was the
whisper of "Drive for show, putt for dough, big cat"
from a Phil Mickelson who had saved Ins A-game
for the meaningless exhibition event. Big surprise
there.
They say Tiger could pick up a composite driver
that's a wood club and still pound a ball 315
yards. Bjorn Borg could still serve up 21 aces a
match with the high socks, headband and the wood
racket he now keeps as a coaster by the wet bar.
Tennis and golf were struggling among the com
mercial audience, though, right? They needed to
beef up the flash to win over America? Well, where
was baseball in 1980, Mr. Reason? You're gonna sit
there and tell me watching Willie McGee leg out 216
jam shot rollers to shortstop off a pitcher with a piti
fully untamed beard and sandlot windup in 1985 was
exciting? No, okay, you wouldn't. But you didn't see
Candy Maldanado turning around and toting an
Easton Black Magic up to die plate in 1986.
Because the game evolved. The bats have stayed
wooden, but the game has become faster and more
explosive than ever before in history. It's athletic
Darwinism, survival of the fittest athlete. And
who's the fittest? The strongest, fastest, hardest
throwing. See ya later Cecil Cooper, Cecil Espy and
Cecil Fielder.
Every sport's that way. Craig Stadler's not out
there dominating the Seniors Tour by driving the
ball 223 yards and Serena's not kissing champi
onship trophies because she perfected the marsh
mallow fluff serve. These athletes, though, don't
need super alloys to dominate and they never
did. The game will take itself to the next level on its
own if you let it. It's science.
The bottom line is you can extend golf course
lengths to accommodate your longer drives and im
plement laser sensors to determine whether your
baseline forehand was inbounds since you now hit
the ball too hard to see, but you still have to go out
there and win. While amateurs might be reaching
higher skill levels quicker than Dikembe Mutumbo
can swat them down, it's not teaching the pros a
thing but to go out there and kill whatever ball
they're playing with. But they would've gotten to
that point anyway, if they had just let it happen nat
urally like baseball did. So next time your kid broth
er's out practicing his Bonds swing, put a wooden
bat in his hands and tell him he better start evolving
or take up tennis.

The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic
Association made national sports head
lines last November when it announced
that baseball state playoff games would be
played strictly with wooden bats. This ruling was an
extension of nationwide decisions made the year
before to reduce metal bat barrel size and weight ra
tios in all senior levels of amateur baseball. The goal
of the reform? To reduce ball speeds coming off
baseball bats and subsequent injuries.
The latest Wilson driver, the Fat Boy, features a
427 cubic centimeter head, an ultra-thin titanium
spring faceplate, an oversized sweet spot to offer
maximum forgiveness on mishit balls, and a gold
graphite spun shaft. Arnold haters everywhere
right now are writing up plans to launch balls
through the bulletproof windows on his Hummer
with the Fat Boy; the club is simply lethal.
In the U.S. Open this past summer, Andy Rod
dick reached 151 miles per hour on his serve. He
was using a Babolat Pure Drive Plus racket, com
posed of Graphite and Kevlar, featuring an over
sized head, and a patented "woofer" system, which

allows the racket to deliver full
potential energy to each ball
strike. Babolat assures that the
racquet is "stiffer, lighter and
more powerful than a traditional
player's racket."
There's no doubt balls flying
off bats, rackets and clubs at light
speed have made sports more
jaw-dropping than ever. Don't
tell me you'd rather see John
Daly lay up on a 340 yard par 4

and hit a nice conservative approach to the green
than drop a Big Bertha tee shot a foot from the cup.
And don't tell me watching your overweight
uncle in his tiny white shorts and aviators tingles
