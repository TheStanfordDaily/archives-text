# Runners prepare for Regional
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
the No. 1 Stanford men's cross country team's
most recent race, senior Grant Robison narrowly
missed capturing his third consecutive individual
Pac-10 title, finishing second to senior teammate
lan Dobson. This weekend, senior Donald Sage
will have a similar opportunity. Having won the
last two NCAA West Regional individual titles,
Sage will shoot for his third on Saturday in Port
land, Ore.
The team, however, is only interested in
preparing for the NCAA Championships.
"Our primary goal is to advance and our sec
ondary goal is to set ourselves up well for Nation
als," said Stanford head coach Aiidy Gerard. "We
would like to expend as little effort as possible and
still secure a spot."
The top two teams in the West Region, which
includes schools in Arizona, California, Oregon
and Washington, will be guaranteed a place at Na
tionals in Waterloo, lowa on Nov. 24. Eighteen
teams will earn slots at Nationals by finishing ei
ther first or second in one of the nine regions, while
13 at-large berths will be awarded.
Even if the top-ranked Cardinal does not finish
in the top two in the West Region, it will almost
certainly be awarded an at-large spot for a string of
impressive races all season long.
Last year, the Stanford men took six of the top
nine spots at the meet while coasting to victory.
Pac-10 champ Dobson finished third overall.
The team has begun to ease up its workouts in
preparation for the season's final two races.
"We've started to slide back in workouts so
that we can freshen up a little bit," Gerard said.
"We're starting to peak."
He said that the team's fate will be determined
by the work the runners have done all season; now,
it is just a matter of seeing how far their training
will take them.
"To use a cliche, most of the hay is already in
the barn," Gerard said. "We've done most of our
preparation."
The weather forecast for Portland on Satur
day is even more ominous than it was at the Pac
-10 Championships in Pullman, Wash., when

temperatures dipped into the 40s. It is expected
to rain, but the team is not worried because it has
been practicing in the rain, off-and-on, for over a
week.
"The only preparation we're doing is in terms
of equipment," Gerard said. "We'll have longer
spikes on our shoes, but that's about it."
On the women's side, junior Sara Bei repeated
as Pac-10 champion last week, and this week ju
nior Alicia Craig will try to defend her West Re
gional title and lead the No. 1 women's team to vic
tory. However, head coach Dena Evans is not con
cerned with individual performances.
"We just want to score the fewest points,"
Evans said. "It doesn't matter to me what order
the runners come in."
Stanford is counting on strong performances
from Craig and Bei, who finished fifth in the re
gional meet last year, as the Cardinal took four of
the top five individual spots.
"They have a role to play in the scoring," Evans
said. "We expect them to be wise in the race and to
lay the groundwork for everyone else."
Evans also spoke of the example that the pan
sets for the younger runners on the team.
"They might be more focused on the larger pic
ture than some of the younger runners," Evans
said. "They are good at focusing on daily chal
lenges and tuning out the rest."
Evans would not reveal which runners she
plans on using Saturday, but juniors Jeane Goff
and Anita Siraki, who finished 11th and 17th over
all, respectively, at last year's meet, will likely be
counted on for solid performances. Freshmen Ar
ianna Lambie and Amanda and Katy Trotter will
probably also compete, based on their perfor
mances at the Pac-10 Championships.
The team has not significantly altered its train
ing schedule, Evans said.
"We're just trying to stay sharp and healthy and
get ready to race."
Evans, like Gerard, is not concerned about the
possibility of rain.
"I would rather it rain in Portland because the
conditions in lowa [at the NCAA Championships]
will most likely be similar," Evans said.
Both teams are hoping for a repeat of last year's
performance, at which each squad skated through
the West Region with little difficulty.

The women's and men's cross country teams spent the weekend preparing for
subpar weather as they head to Pullman, Wash., this week to compete for the
Western Regional Championship. Both teams are heavy favorites to take
home the titles.
