# Home sweet home for Pac-10
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Thanksgiving is still a couple
weeks away, but the Pacific 10
Conference's host teams sure felt
like they were home for the holi
days last weekend.

All four home teams won
including a huge upset by Ari
zona over Washington and Stan
ford's upset win over Arizona
State. Also, Oregon edged Cali
fornia and No. 12 Washington
State dispatched UCLA.

PAC-10 UPDATE

Arizona (2-8, 1-6 Pac-10) en
tered its game against Washing
ton (5-5,3-3) as a 161/2-point un
derdog, although its play on the
field didn't give that impression.
Sophomore Mike Bell rushed for
222 yards including touch
down runs of 67, 69 and 37 yards
as the Wildcats eclipsed the
struggling Huskies, 27-22, for
their first conference win at home
since 2000.
Quarterback Cody Pickett
completed 31-of-51 passes for
351 yards for the Huskies, but
threw three critical incomple
tions on Washington's last pos
session to seal the victory for Ari
zona.
While true freshman Kris
Heavner managed to throw for
151 yards and a touchdown for
Arizona, it was Bell's game from
start to finish. His 69-yard score
on a third-and-one play gave Ari
zona its first lead, 20-16, and his
37-yard run minutes later put the
Wildcats ahead for good. Ari
zona fans stormed the field after
the long-awaited victory.
Stanford (4-4, 2-4) had its
most productive conference
game since 2001, outgunning Ari
zona State, 38-27. Chris Lewis
passed for 279 yards, ran for one
score and threw for another,
while J.R. Lemon racked up 151
yards on 34 carries, both career
highs, and scored twice as well.
The Sun Devils (4-6, 1-5) got
357 yards from a hobbled An
drew Walter, but they came
mostly in garbage time, and run
ning back Loren Wade was
knocked out of the game due to a
concussion as Stanford avenged
its 65-24 thrashing in Tempe,
Ariz., last year.
The evenly-matched game be
tween Cal (5-6, 3-3) and Oregon
(6-4,3-3) came down to the wire,
with Kellen Clemens returning

from a first-quarter benching to
lead the Ducks' 14-point fourth
quarter effort. Oregon rallied for
the win, 21-17, on Terrence
Whitehead's 1-yard touchdown
run with just 47 seconds left to
play.
Clemens and Jason Fife com
bined to pass for 224 yards and
two scores, keeping Oregon in

the game despite just 32 yards on
10 carries from Whitehead.
Cal's Aaron Rodgers passed
for just 188 yards and Adimchi
nobe Echemandu totaled a dis
appointing for the star se
nior, anyhow 70 yards on 24
carries. The Bears held a 10-7
halftime lead thanks to a career
long 53-yard field goal by Tyler

Frederickson.
Washington State's matchup
with UCLA would prove less
competitive, even after its start
ing quarterback, Matt Kegel,
went down in the second quarter.
Even with backup Josh Swogger
completing only 5-of-16 passes
for 82 yards and being intercept
ed twice, the Cougars (8-2, 5-1)

were never in danger, thanks to
Jonathan Smith. The senior run
' ning back torched the normally
stingy Bruins for 140 yards, scor
ing three times and leading his
team to a 31-13 victory.
