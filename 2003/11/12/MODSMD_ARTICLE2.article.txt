# Israeli official speaks on education, rights
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Two days after the Israeli government's marginal approval of a prisoner swap
with Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, Israeli Minister of Education Limnor Livat
spoke on campus yesterday to a crowd of approximately 150 people.
Livat discussed her decision to vote against the prisoner swap, education in
the Middle East and Israel's right to exist.
Livat has served as the minister of education for two and a half years, and is
the first Israeli minister to visit Stanford in the past two years. The event was
sponsored by Hillel, the Stanford Israel Alliance and the Israeli Student Orga
nization.
"It wasn't easy," said Livat in response to her vote against the deal with
Hezbollah guerrillas to swap 400 Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners for a kid
napped Israeli businessman and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers. "That the Is
raeli government is split 12 to 11 shows how difficult it is."
Livat defended her position by arguing that the prisoner swap could make Is
rael appear weak.
"This could cause more and more terror attacks and kidnapping by the

Hezbollah," she said.
While the swap does not include Is
raeli airman Ron Arad, whose capture
in Lebanon 17 years ago is widely
known, Livat said that there is evidence
that Arad is alive and being held in Iran.
"We deal with regimes in the Mid
dle East that have no clue about demo
cratic values," Livat said. "Israel is the
only country with democratic values
[in the Middle East], which we share
with the United States. We are trying
to keep with us those democratic val
ues yet we still have to deal with
Hezbollah or Iran."
Livat was engaged with her audi
ence for most of her talk, fielding ques
tions and debate that addressed both
sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"I thought that one of the important
points that she made was the lack of
fair representation of Israel as a coun
try, which is the only democracy in a re
gion where the other countries have as
their purpose to destroy Israel," said
Dan Kaganovich, a graduate student in
biological sciences and a board mem
ber of the Stanford Israel Alliance.

"It's important to point out where Is
rael is. It's the Middle East, as some
people say, not the Midwest."
Some audience members voiced
their criticism of the Israeli security
fence.
In response, Livat asked, "Do you
know any other nation whose citizens
have been attacked daily for the past
three years by its neighbors and
wouldn't take all the necessary steps to
protect them?
"This is not a wall." she continued,
"It is a fence, literally, except for two
very short sections. It is a defensive
fence."
Freshman Julie Veroff remained
critical of the security fence after the
talk.
"To me, that's contradictory to the
peace process, to leave up the fence
and to proclaim that Israel is supposed
to represent the fight against anti-
Semitism when Israel itself is not al
lowing itself to be seen as favorably as
it would be if it took a more coopera
tive stance," Veroff said.
livat said that education in Israel
and throughout the Middle East plays
an important role in the peace process.
"In our education system we edu
cate our people with knowledge, but
also values," Livat said. "Even in the

last three years [of violence], we still
have hope. We have to educate our
children to hope."
She praised the Israeli education
system, adding that Israel's highly edu
cated workforce has developed a high
tech sector second only to the United
States.
"Being second in the world in high
tech means we did something in 55
years that no one could've thought pos
sible," Livat said.
She insisted, though, that quality
education "is not a matter of money,
it's a matter of curriculum."
Livat applied this philosophy to ed
ucation in the entire Middle East.
"In the Palestinian Authority, but not
only in the PA, they educate the children
right from the cradle —to hate," she
said. "That is why education and the sub
stance of education is important."
When one audience member ques
tioned the need for Israel to even exist,
Livat said it was a necessity because of
the prevalence in parts of the world of
views that she termed anti-Semitic.
"On this land, our historic land,
there should be a homeland for Jews
around the world," she said. "I frankly
believe that without the state of Israel
many Jews around the world would
not be safe."

When one audience member ques
tioned the need for Israel to even exist,
Livat said it was a necessity because of
the prevalence in parts of the world of

around the world," she said. "I frankly
believe that without the state of Israel
many Jews around the world would
not be safe."
