# UCLA hoops finally agrees to allow press in Pauley for practice
## 
### 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES â€”The UCLA
men's basketball practice was open to the media for
the first time since around the first Bush adminis
tration, and I wasn't about to let that opportunity
slip by.
This sort of thing doesn't happen very often, so
when I actually walked into Pauley Pavilion, I felt
as though I was entering the Forbidden City. I half
expected some sort of ceremonious entrance, re
plete with dancers dressed in red silk, burning in
cense and Imperial Guardsmen. But instead, at
around 3:05 on Friday afternoon, I found a door
that had been left ajar, and slipped inside.
3:06 Well, that was easy. I take my seat some
where in the student-seating section, close to the
floor. The team is warming up, doing some running
and lay-up drills. I get my first look at Brian Morri
son, the transfer from North Carolina. As Hubie
Brown might say, the guy is an "ath-a-lete." He gets
off the ground quickly and has excellent hops.
3:09 Hey, check it out, Andy Katz from
ESPN is here! Oh wait, it's Jay Bilas. Never mind.
3:15 The bigs are separated from the guards,
with the former working against each other on their
post-up moves, while the latter work on baseline
screens, cuts to the basket, and recognizing defen
sive schemes. By the way, Michael Fey looks pretty
good now that he's lost that afro. Maybe the hair

was squashing his brain or something. Ryan Hollins
looks a little out of control every time he touches
the ball, but he's also developed some skills in the
low post.
3:28 Freshman Trevor Ariza is a nice-look
ing guard. He's got a good jumper and good pass
ing skills, though his handles leave a little to be de
sired. What's that you say? He's playing power
forward? Oh hush, you can't pull a fast one over
these eyes. Wait, you're serious? Uh ... Trevor,
do you have a 19 premiere meal plan? Because, I
mean, you should use those swipes. All of them.
Tomorrow.
3:37 Quote of the day courtesy of coach Ben
Howland. After Ryan Walcott sets a soft screen,
Howland stops practice and yells, "I expect us to
get some fouls setting screens!"
Awesome.
3:41 OK, the Imperial Guardsmen are here. I
have to move. Apparently TV media needs exactly
three-quarters of Pauley Pavilion. Us newspaper
types are getting in the way. Never mind that a cam
era hadn't come within 15 feet of me the entire
time.
3:45 Blue shirts vs. White shirts. I can't tell
who is on which team, because I'm now viewing the
action from Mt. Kilimanjaro. Suffice to say that the
defensive intensity in these scrimmages is much

higher than I expected. Either that or this team
can't shoot very well.
4:00 It's official. This team is going to struggle
to score. Dijon Thompson is a smooth criminal, to
be sure, but the rest of the team doesn't seem to be
confident yet in their offense.
4:17 Well, at least they're running plays. It
may not be as elegant as Steve Lavin's motion
(read: voodoo) offense, but they're running plays.
The curls are generally tight, the screens are hard (I
expect us to get some fouls!), and the offense has a
definite purpose.
More on this later.
4:45 Ahh, the action really begins. It's the
first unit versus the bench, always fun to watch.
Hollins slams right into the center of Fey's chest,
picking up a slew of offensive fouls. Frustration
much? Hollins doesn't seem to think he's bench
material.
5:30 Practice wraps up and the players are al
lowed to talk to the media. I asked Dijon to com
pare the offense from last year to the present, and
he had this to say:
"We're pretty much running the same thing as
before, but last year it was a little more freelance."
The improvement, therefore, "comes from coach
Howland. He has us setting good screens, setting
hard picks and getting good shots."
