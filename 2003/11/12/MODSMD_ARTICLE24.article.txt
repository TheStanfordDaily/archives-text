## Law schools sue to ban military recruiters 
### CHE RISE M. WILLIAMS GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY 
(U-WIRE) In a partial victory for the coali
tion of law schools, professors and students serv
ing as plaintiffs, a U.S. District Court judge will
allow a case to continue which challenges the right
of the Department of Defense to cut funding to
schools that bar military recruiters.
But in last Wednesday's ruling in Newark, N.J.,
the judge also refused to issue a preliminary in
junction that would immediately allow law
schools to bar access to Judge Advocate General
recruiters, a practice currently enforced by the
Solomon Amendment.
The lawsuit contends that the military's "don't
ask, don't tell" policy toward homosexuals is in vi
olation of the Association of American Law
Schools' bylaw 6-4, which added sexual orienta
tion to the list of protected categories under its
non-discrimination provisions. The suit alleges
that the Solomon Amendment is unconstitutional
because it requires that the military be granted ac
cess to campus regardless of a school's nondis

crimination policies.
The Forum for Academic and Institutional
Rights filed the suit in September.
FAIR has declined to name the 15 law schools
involved in the lawsuit, but the group's board in
cludes professors from Georgetown, Yale, Stan
ford and New York Universities and the Universi
ty of Southern California.
In his decision to throw out the Department of
Justice's motion to dismiss the suit, Judge John C.
Lifland supported the plaintiff's argument that a
law school's refusal to comply with the Solomon
Amendment should not result in a loss of funds for
the parent institution from all federal sources. He
also rejected the Department of Defense's argu
ment that law schools must offer completely equal
access to the military.
But Lifland said he would not grant an injunc
tion because he did not support FAIR'S complaint
that the law was unconstitutional.
"While allowing or assisting military recruiters
on campus could be viewed as a dilution of the law
schools' message of nondiscrimination, it is far dif
ferent from endorsing the military's policy to

wards sexual orientation, particularly where, as
here, there is no restriction on speech or conduct
disclaiming any such endorsement," Lifland said
in his decision.
E. Joshua Rosenkranz, lead counsel on the
case for the plaintiffs, said "the judge's ruling not
only instills comfort in law schools that they were
doing nothing wrong in upholding their anti-dis
crimination policies, but also leaves the door
wide-open for an appeal."
Rosenkranz said he and his clients have inten
tions to appeal the ruling against an injunction.
Georgetown law professor Mike Seidman said
that Georgetown is not a member of FAIR and
that law professors had not joined the lawsuit. Sei
dman said he thinks the case will ultimately be re
solved by a Court of Appeals or by the Supreme
Court.
The suit, Forum for Academic and Institution
al Integrity v. Rumsfeld, was the first of four simi
lar lawsuits filed since September. FAIR will con
tinue to seek an injunction and will appeal
Lifland's decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court.
