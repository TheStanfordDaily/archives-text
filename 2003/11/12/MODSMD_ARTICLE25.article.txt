# NYU offers new Milk and Cookies Club
## 
### LISA FLEISHER NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
(U-WIRE) New York University junior Adam
Stein explained the mission of one of the newest clubs at
NYU: "We want to save the world, one cookie at a
time," he said.
The Milk and Cookies Club at NYU held its latest
bash Monday night at Gould Plaza, drawing about 50
people on a dark, chilly night.
The idea is simple: Bring students together for a good
time, creating a fun, non-ideological atmosphere at a
campus without a campus.
"The problem with the university, we thought, was
that people have a lack of the humor involved in
school," said Stein, the club's prime minister. "We just
thought it would be a great way of having people come
together."
The club debuted in September with a "BYOMC"
party Bring Your Own Milk and Cookies.
Stein and club president Nathan Silberman, a Col
lege of Arts and Science senior, phoned about five
friends each, Stein said, and the word spread from there.
About 55 people showed up to the first event, also held
in Gould Plaza.
After a recent physics test, members stationed them
selves throughout the Silver Center for Arts and Sci
ence, giving away about 14 boxes of Entenmann's cook
ies and pouring nearly 4 gallons of milk.
There are currently about 70 members, going by the
e-mail list, Stein said. Members are invited to nominate
themselves for waggish governmental positions such as
Minister of Lactose Affairs (Sam Rockwell), Guardian
of the Cookie Monster (Jennie Perlmutter) and Ambas
sador for a More Cultural Cookie (Jessica Cohen). To
date, nobody has been turned down for a ministerial po
sition.
