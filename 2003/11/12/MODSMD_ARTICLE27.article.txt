# Students struggle to work, raise family
## 
### JARED PABEN OREGON DAILY EMERALD 
(U-WIRE) EUGENE, Ore.
Kimberly Gwynne knows that she
can't five the same life as most stu
dents. The 34-year-old University
of Oregon student and her nine
year partner, David Watson, 38,
wake up at 6:15 a.m. three days a
week to get to their 9 a.m. Geogra
phy 141 class on time.
The two environmental science
majors five in Salem, Ore., and com
mute every weekday to attend
school in Eugene. They home
school their children, work all day
Saturday and Sunday to pay the
bills and struggle to manage their
load of homework and reading.
Gwynne and Watson are classic
examples of nontraditional stu
dents.
University of Oregon Nontradi
tional Student Union co-Director
Steven Burns estimated that ap
proximately 1,600 nontraditional
students attend the University of
Oregon, but he admitted that it is
hard to know for sure because the
criteria for being a "nontrad"
having children, transferring from
another school or being older than
the typical student are often diffi
cult to track or gauge.
He said that Gwynne and Wat
son's situation is a common one,
noting that he has seen students
drive from Roseburg, Salem and
Florence every day to go to school at
U. of Oregon. Many of them are
even forced to spend the night if the
weather is bad or if they don't have
time to drive back and forth.
Gwynne and Watson know first
hand how difficult it can be for non
traditional students to pay the bills
and raise a family while attending
school.
Their grades are also suffering
from the extra pressure.
During his last term at
Chemeketa Community College
where both Gwynne and Watson
earned Associate of Arts Oregon
Transfer degrees Watson held a
part-time job on campus and a part
time job off campus, was heavily in
volved in student government and
took 24 credits.
"He still got a 4.0 GPA,"
Gwynne said, adding that she too
pulled A'sandß's.
When he came to the University
last fall, Watson realized his AAOT
degree was a "complete waste of
time" that grossly under-prepared
him for studies at the University.
"This term we're taking 16 cred
its with weekend part-time pizza
driver jobs, and this term is over
whelming," Watson said. "This is
not a sustainable practice. Our
GPAs are suffering."
Gwynne said the most difficult

part of school is the over-abun
dance of required reading. Yet,
they've managed to turn the incon
venience of a grueling commute
into a useful time for studying by
reading to each other as they drive.
"We just find little squish times
when we can read to each other,"
Gwynne said.
For Watson and Gwynne, pay
ing the bills is especially difficult.
They support Gwynne's 16-year
old daughter Breanna and the cou
ple's four-year-old son Drey an.
To deal with the financial demands
of higher education, the couple has
started recording and typing class
notes for University Disability Ser
vices, bringing in about $lOO per term,
Gwynne said. She also said they're
going to start auctioning things on
eßay to bring in a little extra money.
"Our typical pattern is to work
like crazy during the summer and
then try to do a collage of small
things for small incomes when we
have the opportunity," Watson
said.
Another part of their life that
often suffers with their busy lifestyle
is their family, which Watson de
scribes as "remarkably close."
Gwynne said they don't have a
lot of quality time with their chil
dren except for the occasional
evening. While Breanna and
Dreyan come down to Eugene with
their parents on the weekdays, all of
them are usually occupied with
reading and studying.
Burns explained that juggling
jobs, family and school can be diffi
cult for many nontraditional stu
dents, which is why the Nontradi
tional Student Union is needed.
The group helps students find
money and arrange childcare, as
well as provide other resources for
nontraditional students.
He also said feeling like an out
sider is a common problem.
"For a nontraditional student to
come to this University as an older
student feeling like a sore thumb,
that is a psychological barrier that
we have to deal with," he said.
But the apparent age barrier be
tween traditional and nontradition
al students didn't discourage Wat
son. He decided that his two-year
forestry degree from Chemeketa
wasn't going to be good enough
and that he needed to go back to
school.
"That forestry degree opened
opportunities for me to be a season
al, part-time, entry-level state forest
ranger in charge of cleaning [Port-
A-Potty] cans in three state parks in
Wisconsin and one in Nebraska,
with tens of visitors every year," he
said. "So, I decided that life needed
to be better than that. We both went
back and got our AAOTs so we
could come here as juniors."

mute every weekday to attend
school in Eugene. They home
school their children, work all day
Saturday and Sunday to pay the
bills and struggle to manage their
load of homework and reading.
Gwynne and Watson are classic
examples of nontraditional stu
dents.
University of Oregon Nontradi
tional Student Union co-Director
Steven Burns estimated that ap
proximately 1,600 nontraditional
students attend the University of
Oregon, but he admitted that it is
hard to know for sure because the
criteria for being a "nontrad"
having children, transferring from
another school or being older than
the typical student are often diffi
cult to track or gauge.
He said that Gwynne and Wat
son's situation is a common one,
noting that he has seen students
drive from Roseburg, Salem and
Florence every day to go to school at
U. of Oregon. Many of them are
even forced to spend the night if the
weather is bad or if they don't have
time to drive back and forth.
Gwynne and Watson know first
hand how difficult it can be for non
traditional students to pay the bills
and raise a family while attending
school.
Their grades are also suffering
from the extra pressure.
During his last term at
Chemeketa Community College
where both Gwynne and Watson
earned Associate of Arts Oregon
Transfer degrees Watson held a
part-time job on campus and a part
time job off campus, was heavily in
volved in student government and
took 24 credits.
"He still got a 4.0 GPA,"
Gwynne said, adding that she too
pulled A'sandß's.
When he came to the University
last fall, Watson realized his AAOT
degree was a "complete waste of
time" that grossly under-prepared
him for studies at the University.
"This term we're taking 16 cred
its with weekend part-time pizza
driver jobs, and this term is over
whelming," Watson said. "This is
not a sustainable practice. Our
GPAs are suffering."
Gwynne said the most difficult

part of school is the over-abun
dance of required reading. Yet,
they've managed to turn the incon
venience of a grueling commute
into a useful time for studying by
reading to each other as they drive.
"We just find little squish times
when we can read to each other,"
Gwynne said.
For Watson and Gwynne, pay
ing the bills is especially difficult.
They support Gwynne's 16-year
old daughter Breanna and the cou
ple's four-year-old son Drey an.
To deal with the financial demands
of higher education, the couple has
started recording and typing class
notes for University Disability Ser
vices, bringing in about $lOO per term,
Gwynne said. She also said they're
going to start auctioning things on
eßay to bring in a little extra money.
"Our typical pattern is to work
like crazy during the summer and
then try to do a collage of small
things for small incomes when we
have the opportunity," Watson
said.
Another part of their life that
often suffers with their busy lifestyle
is their family, which Watson de
scribes as "remarkably close."
Gwynne said they don't have a
lot of quality time with their chil
dren except for the occasional
evening. While Breanna and
Dreyan come down to Eugene with
their parents on the weekdays, all of
them are usually occupied with
reading and studying.
Burns explained that juggling
jobs, family and school can be diffi
cult for many nontraditional stu
dents, which is why the Nontradi
tional Student Union is needed.
The group helps students find
money and arrange childcare, as
well as provide other resources for
nontraditional students.
He also said feeling like an out
sider is a common problem.
"For a nontraditional student to
come to this University as an older
student feeling like a sore thumb,
that is a psychological barrier that
we have to deal with," he said.
But the apparent age barrier be
tween traditional and nontradition
al students didn't discourage Wat
son. He decided that his two-year
forestry degree from Chemeketa
wasn't going to be good enough
and that he needed to go back to
school.
"That forestry degree opened
opportunities for me to be a season
al, part-time, entry-level state forest
ranger in charge of cleaning [Port-
A-Potty] cans in three state parks in
Wisconsin and one in Nebraska,
with tens of visitors every year," he
said. "So, I decided that life needed
to be better than that. We both went
back and got our AAOTs so we
could come here as juniors."
