### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
University Architect David Neu
man is leaving one picturesque cam
pus for another.
The University of Virginia named
Neuman as its new architect yester
day. He has spent the past 14 years as
Stanford's architect, and he will leave
later this month.
"David Neuman comes to Char
lottesville with an impressive back
ground and range of experience in
preservation and campus planning,"
said University of Virginia President
John Casteen 111. "His prior work at
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia shows that he has both the vi
sion and the ability to inspire great ar
chitecture in an academic setting."
At Virginia, Neuman will oversee
the 180-year-old Academical Vil

lage, home to buildings designed by
university founder Thomas Jeffer
son. In addition to this preservation
work and serving as UVA's repre
sentative to various state, city and
county organizations, he will be re
sponsible for designing other signifi
cant construction and renovation
projects.
"I am appreciative of the opportu
nity to oversee both the preservation
and future development of Thomas
Jefferson's grounds," Neuman said.
"[l] am prepared to continue in the
tradition of the Jeffersonian legacy."
At Stanford, Neuman followed in
the footsteps of Frederick Law Olm
sted, who created the University's
original plan in 1886. Neuman has
been cited by the American Institute
of Architects for what it called an in
spired integration of the original
founders' and architects' vision with

a new and thoughtful master plan.
Neuman said he relied heavily on
Olmsted's original plans while initiat
ing campus renewal that won him a
10-year National Trust for Historic
Preservation Award. In 2000, he re
ceived the Corporate Architect
Honor Award from the California
Council of the American Institute of
Architects.
The award said that Neuman
"promoted and encouraged the
restoration of Stanford University,
masterfully blending the old and the
new, while responding to the imme
diate needs of the campus and its stu
dents."
Senior Andrea Johnson con
curred with this judgment. Having
worked in Neuman's office and on a
project under his advisement, she
said she noted his concern for stu
dents' needs.
"He was very involved and very
concerned about what the students
wanted," Johnson said. "He was con
cerned about meeting students' needs
while staying on budget. He came up
with new designs that weren't too ex

pensive but looked nice."
Prior to his stint at Stanford, Neu
man spent 12 years leading design and
planning at UC-Irvine as campus ar
chitect and associate vice chancellor.
At Virgina, he succeeds Samuel
(Pete) Anderson, who retired in May.
"It is our hope that under David's
guidance, we will have a clear vision of
the University's physical design needs
for the next 50 years," said UVA Ex
ecutive Vice President Leonard San
dridge.

Neuman is the author of three
books, most recently "Building Type
Basics for College and University Fa
cilities," which was published this
year.
Holding undergraduate degrees
from the University of Notre Dame
and the University of Michigan, Neu
man received his master's from Bowl
ing Green State University and is cur
rently a doctoral candidate at UCLA.
Stanford has not yet named a re
placement architect.
