# Synergy residents install solar panels

### RACHEL RUBIN 
Synergy is employing a new form of
energy this year, after the cooperative
house installed solar power panels over
the summer.
For the past two years, Synergy and
Student Housing have been working
together to implement a solar powered
energy system. Synergy now has a
rooftop that holds a 54-panel solar en
ergy system, divided into three 18-
panel arrays. According to the Stan
ford Report, Student Housing worked
closely with the University architect's
office on the placement of the panels to
ensure the modern technology would
only have a minimal effect on the
house's historic appearance.
The solar systems act as an environ
mentally friendly way to generate elec
tricity, supplementing the house's elec
trical system with renewable energy for
about 15 percent of the overall house

use.
The systems work by independent
ly converting the sun's light into elec
tricity. Synergy's system is expected to
produce more than 11,000 kilowatt
hours of electricity a year and reduce
the amount of carbon dioxide that oth
erwise would be released into the air by
15,444 pounds, according to Student
Housing calculations. *
The total cost of the system, includ
ing installation, was about $BO,OOO. Stu
dent Housing provided $20,000, the
State of California provided a $30,000
rebate and $30,000 came from Synergy
alumni. The alumni funds were donat
ed following the 1989 earthquake to
ensure the survival of the Synergy com
munity, according to House Manager
Justin Kuczynski, a senior.
Rob Kolar, energy coordinator for
Student Housing and a major collabo
rator in the project, created a website
that will track the daily power output.

"This will allow us to validate the
total system output and cost savings
over time," Kolar said. "It will also
serve as a diagnostic tool for our main
tenance staff, who can periodically
check on the system to insure that the
output is consistent with our expecta
tions."
The Student Housing Energy and
Water Conservation Web site is acces
sible through a Student Housing Web
site, conserve.stanford.edu, an educa
tional tool for Stanford students who
would like to know more about the
Synergy Solar System and other con
servation projects that Student Hous
ing is pursuing.
The project is a model that will
hopefully influence others, both from
Stanford and from other universities
and businesses, Kolar said.
"Solar energy is viable and effective
