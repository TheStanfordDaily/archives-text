# Student evangelists stress positivity
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many students walking or biking
through White Plaza yesterday af
ternoon witnessed a display of Chris
tianity very different from the one
presented by two evangelists last
Thursday afternoon.
United in Christ members spent
the afternoon holding up signs to
show Christianity in a light different
from that of last Thursday's contro
versial street preachers. Unlike the
angry rebellion against last week's
spectacle, however, reaction to yes
terday's demonstration was general
ly subdued.
Though the demonstration was
not just a direct response to last
week's incident, organizers did hope
to present Christianity in a more
positive light than it was presented
last Thursday.
"We know people were affected
by Thursday's message and remem
ber it," said junior Eric Frantz.
UIC, an organization of about 10
on-campus fellowship groups, also
saw this as an opportunity to engage
the Stanford community in dialogue.
"We've been wanting to do some
thing like this for a long time," Frantz
said. "It's just about presenting the
Christian gospel so people can feel
comfortable approaching us and asking
us questions on an individual level."
Large posters with phrases like
"God is Love" conveyed the group's
message to bystanders and interest
ed students.
Frantz hoped there was a clear
contrast between UlC's message
and the message from last week's
evangelists, because some people
found the street preachers' words to
be hateful.
"I think last week really focused
on people's sins," Frantz said. "We
think they were missing the other
side of the Christian message, which
is love and salvation leading to for
giveness through Jesus Christ."
Frantz hoped that students would

feel free to discuss matters of reli
gion and spirituality with their
friends following yesterday's
demonstration.
"We want students to take away a
sense that there are people on cam
pus open to talk to," Frantz said.
Other than a few observers in
White Plaza who expressed frustra
tion at Christians in general, public
reaction to the demonstrators was

modest.
"A lot of other Christians have
stopped to encourage us," sopho
more Cyndy Chen said at the time.
"I think a lot of people who don't
have positive reactions just don't
stop and talk."
Some students said that the scene
revived conversations about last
week's evangelists.
"It was a positive way to counter

the upsetting display of intolerance
seen last week," sophomore Carla
Fenves said.
Sophomore Jeffrey Hu appreci
ated that this week's demonstration
of Christianity was less offensive
than that of the street preachers.
"I don't necessarily agree with
their ideas, but at least they're trying
to get their beliefs across in a less ag
gressive way," he said.
