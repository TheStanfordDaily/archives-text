## I think I shall pimp the column myself, said Mrs. Dalloway 
### 
As you read these words, somewhere in the heartland of our
great nation a gold-plated pendant spelling out "BITCH" is
warming itself in the vintage cleavage of an otherwise mild
mannered grandmother. Or at least, that's what her grand
daughter, who shall remain nameless for fear of randy Farm boys dialing
long-distance for an earful from a sassy older woman, would have me be
lieve.
I tend to take such stories with a pinch of the ol' Morton. I have no
way to corroborate this old wife tale (I know, I know, the pun was just
too tempting), and I do not think that I would want to confirm it even if

the venerable matriarch were in front of me right now,
bosom all a-quiver. It's not the tale of the spunky
granny that I suspect; rather, I would contest the cur
rently in-vogue concept that one can successfully put a
positive spin on certain sexual terms loaded with neg
ative connotations. The granddaughter claims that her
grandmother is one of a cadre of feisty females who
are re-claiming the term"bitch" for the ladies. Instead
of a pejorative term, she avers, "bitch" is well on its
way to being construed as a complimentary you-go
girl honorific.
Do you buy this? I don't. But you can buy your very

own cubic zirconium "#1 Bitch" pendant from Golden Charm.com. It's
the one right next to the "Madonna and Child" necklace. Like your av
erage pole-dancer, it's "got loads of sparkly bits, and not too subtle," the
ad primly cautions potential buyers.
Unbeknownst to those City Nights club-kid creepazoids who still use
the tired-out "Nice shoes, wanna f—?", negatively-charged sexual dic
tion is undergoing a renovation more extensive than Madonna's transi
tion from "Breathless" smutstress to Material Mom. "Bitch" magazine,
a proud product of San Francisco (surprised?), justifies its love, er, name
thus: "For as long as we've been publishing Bitch, there's one question
that gets asked over and over. And over. 'Why did you choose that word
as the name of your magazine?' While we're aware that our title is off
putting to some people, we think it's worth it. And here's why: when it's
being used as an insult, 'bitch' is most often hurled at women who speak
their minds, who have opinions and don't shy away from expressing
them. If being an outspoken woman means being a bitch, we'll take that
as a compliment, thanks. If we take it as a compliment, it loses its power
to hurt us. And if we can get people thinking about what they're saying
when they use the word, that's even better."
In an interview this fall, Bitch, one half of the Brooklyn "queer-girl"
fiddle-and-ukulele duo Bitch and Animal, said that the pair chose their
moniker because "we're about reclaiming words."
It's wonderful to think that we can salvage negatively loaded sexual
language, words such as "f—," "pimp" and "bitch," like so many used vi
brators. But face it, we can't reclaim either of these. (Ever heard of a sec
ond-hand vibrator?) The problem is, we never claimed them in the first
place. There was never a time when "F— you!" was a sweet nothing. If
you greet the next woman you meet with a friendly, "Hey, bitch," odds
are good she'll step to you. Them's fighting words, no matter what you
say.
"It isn't really sex unless it's dirty," Woody Allen once said. I would
paraphrase this by saying that we don't think it's sex talk unless it's dirty.
Often, the same people who argue that we should all discuss sex in
positive language, because it's a byootifill thang, will later be overheard
lambasting some poor schmuck with a hearty Old Norse "F— you!" Just
go about your business on campus and you'll be privy to many instances
of sexual language deployed as the worst possible insult. Some samples
I gleaned this week:
"My E4O midterm f dme up the ass," a nervous-looking techie
mutters to his pal, as I pass him in hallway. Probably the only play he'll
get for a while, I think facetiously. This is a variant of another oft-re
peated Stanford phrase, "That test raped me."
"You f—ing liar!" a woman tells her boyfriend. Well, at least part of
that is true.
"Shove it up his ass!" a girl advises her friend after hearing some he
done-me-wrong story.
A guy pleads with a girl to perform oral sex on him, the same girl to
whom he offered up, "That sucks" as a phrase of comfort. "Sucks" takes
a direct object, honey, and it ain't "ice cube."
"I'm gonna pimp this reaction," boasts a bespectacled fellow in a
computer company T-shirt, scrawling carbonyl groups and ketones on a
whiteboard.
Who profaned what rightfully should be our terms of endearment? In
"The Language War," UC Berkeley linguistics Prof. Robin Tolmach
Lakoff speculates that the 1991 Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings
"made sex more titillatingly discussible in public. Hill's use of "penis" on
the Senate floor, and its subsequent necessary iteration on TV news
broadcasts, made it acceptable public fare."
Because of this and other high-profile early-1990s sex scandals,
Lakoff explains, "the specifics of sexuality became not only permissible,
but normal, on the nightly news. In the 1970s there had been earnest de
bate about whether it was seemly to say 'breast' on television in the open
discussion about breast cancer initiated by Betty Ford." It follows that in
the early 19905, Lakoff notes, "references to alternative sexual practices
were the stuff of prime time ... attacks and allegations [became] more
hurtful because they could be more intimate."
As Foucault observed, contemporary Freud-fried society dissembles
that we are trained to repress our sexuality, while in fact we are con
stantly, if subconsciously, talking about it. We are just talking about it in
a downright dysfunctional way. Perhaps this is because the sexual lan
guage we bandy about in our everyday speech was first publicly con
doned in negative contexts such as sexual-harassment hearings, domes
tic violence trials such as the notorious Lorena Bobbitt case, cancer
awareness programs and reports on hate crimes against gays such as
Brandon Teena and Matthew Shepherd.
In his seminal treatise "Art as Technique," the leading Russian For
malist theoretician Viktor Shklovsky described defamiliarization(asfra
nenie, or "making strange") as the basic technique of the erotic riddle, a
technique based on euphemism. Defamiliarization is the process of pre
senting language (and other art objects) as "unfamiliar" in order to re
mind people that words are consciously constructed, in order to encour
age non-automatic perception of words. What we are doing now is the op
posite of that. We have become desensitized to the power of words to af
fect our perspective on sex. People think that language is a passive tool,
but it does more work than we realize.
When French essayist Georges Bataille said that "the essence of
eroticism is given in the inextricable association of sexual pleasure and
interdiction." What a delicious double entendre is offered by this trans
lation-interdict as meaning "to destroy" and the Latin "inter" + "dictus"
meaning, "said between." Between the lines of our sexual discourse lies
a negative meaning. I'll leave you with the thoughts of another esteemed
purveyor of belles lettres, 50 Cent: "I'm into having sex, babe / I'm not
into making love." There do be a difference. When we call it talking dirty,
unfortunately we mean what we say.
