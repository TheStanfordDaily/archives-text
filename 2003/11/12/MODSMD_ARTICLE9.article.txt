# Volunteer work keeps Stanford ballerina
## On Her Toes 
### ARAM HUR 
Corrugated iron boards and plastic bags clump together in bunches, poor
excuses for houses. Muffled cries mingle with the gibberish of drunkards
roaming the streets. In one house, yet another mother is dying of AIDS. Next
door, an abandoned baby wails for help. This is the reality of the ramshackle
settlements of Cape Town, South Africa. This, not paradisal pools or tanned
beachcombers, is what senior Maya Adam saw on
her summer vacation.

Sixty children are raped a day in South Africa,
according to "Globe and Mail," a national Canadi
an newspaper. Ravaged by dire poverty, men in the
Cape Town settlements often resort to alcoholism
and physical abuse to assuage their feelings of help
lessness. Consequently, women and children are
frequently victimized in a vicious cycle of negli
gence and abuse. Amidst this grim reality, however,
some, still hopeful, soldier on for change. Stanford
senior Maya Adam is one of these volunteers.
Last April, Adam, a Human Biology major, pro
cured the Haas Center's African Service Fellow
ship, which provided her with two months of hands
on experience with child health and nutrition issues
in Africa. Since Maya's mother is South African
and Maya herself spent a few years of high school in
Cape Town, she looked forward to returning there.
Adam took part in Philani, an independent non-

profit organization devoted to improving the health of women and children
in the scattered Cape Town settlements. Spearheaded by the Swedish physi
cian Ingrid le Roux, the program encompasses a clinic, an "educare" pro
gram, a women's weaving program and an outreach program, providing mul
tifaceted aid for Cape Town women and children.
"I was engaged in the outreach program," says Adam. "I went to the
townships every day with the coordinator and one or two other volunteers.
Our job was to lend constant support to the women and bring children in des
perate need of medical aid to the clinics."

For Adam, her two-month stay was an indelible experience, both posi
tively and negatively. "I saw things this summer that I could never have even
imagined," she says. Adam remembers watching infants whose ribs stuck out
due to malnutrition, while other babies lacked the strength to even cry.
Rampant HTV / AIDS claims a variety of victims, ranging from babies to
elderly women. Adam recounts one villager telling her how his family and
friends were "dropping like flies" due to the dreaded disease.

Of all the people whom Adam encountered on
her trip, it is a tiny baby girl who most haunts her
memories. The infant was abandoned by her parents
in a shack, where she was subsequently gang-raped by
several neighborhood boys. She was only two years
and seven months old. As Adam held the baby in her
arms on the drive to the clinic, Adam watched the
baby fall asleep ever so peacefully. While the baby girl
is only one out of many, Adam truly felt a sense of
purpose for existence right then.
"I really felt I was making a difference with my
life. I was needed there," she says.
Apart from medical assistance, Adam also in
stilled hope through quite an unusual medium, dance.
Having been a professional dancer for 10 years before
matriculating at Stanford, Adam taught ballet for the
"Dance for All" program operating in the Guguletu
Township, one of Cape Town's older settlements.
The program offers activity programs to children so
that they have something else to do other than wan-

dering the streets. For some, dancing has changed their lives by providing
them with a life goal.
Adam has returned at Stanford, but her outlook has been inevitably al
tered. While Adam helped some of those whom she met on her trip, the ex
perience has enriched her life as well, helping her to ascertain her life goals.
"I'm almost certain of taking the path to a medical career," she says. The
grave medical reality of Cape Town's settlements has impressed itself upon
Adam, and she says that she will eventually return and try to make a greater
contribution in the future.

"I really felt I was mak
ing a difference with my
life. I was needed there.

as a volunteer in South Africa last summer. Adam is a senior majoring in Human Biology.
