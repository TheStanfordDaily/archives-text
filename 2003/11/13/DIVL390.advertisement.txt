Seductress
by Betsy Prioleau
Thursday, November 13, 2003
7:OOPM • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Prioleau's captivating debut is a fervid
self-help tract well-disguised as a
history. "Seductresses are in fact the
liberated women incarnate," asserts
the author in her opening chapter.
"They're the stealth heroines of history.
The first feminists." It's a persuasive
argument, which Prioleau pounds
home with massive fists full of quota
tions, attributions and texts from
anthropology, religion, psychology,
history, art, literature, music and
anything else she can get her hyper
intellectual hands on. Modern women
have lost their goddess-centered
groove, the Manhattan College profes
sor asserts, and as a consequence the
entire race is going to hell in a male
dominated, bimbo-focused hand bas
ket. If only women would search their
collective unconscious for their arche
typal Goddess roots, they'd realize
modern feminism has rendered them
joyless, and the reality TV/Barbie look
alike trends are hooey. Rather, women
of any age (there's a chapter on "silver
foxes") or looks (another chapter on
"homely sirens") are multi-orgasmic,
brilliant, joyous power mavens who
possess everything to bring a man to
his willing knees and keep both gen
ders happy and sated. Telling wonder
fully peripatetic tales of self
possessed sirens and seductresses
throughout the eons, Prioleau makes a
string case for women to take back
their ancestral birthright of sexy whole
ness.
