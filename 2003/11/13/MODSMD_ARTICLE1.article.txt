# New grad dorm may house 700
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
A large new graduate residence planned near the
Law School to help remedy a housing shortage has
some members of the Stanford community con
cerned.
According to current plans, the residence will
house 600 to 700 students twice as many as Roble
Hall, which sleeps 311, according to the ASSU
Housing Guide.
Mirrielees, the largest undergraduate residence,
houses 435 students, according to the guide.
The residence will also cause the removal of four
houses on Salvatierra Walk.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the Law School,
stressed that the decision to build the residence has
not yet been finalized and that although the project
is becoming more tangible, it remains in its early
stages.
While the Zapata parking lot has been designated
as the site, the Board of Trustees has not yet ap
proved any of the building designs. According to
Robert Reidy, vice provost of land and buildings,
there is only one design under consideration, al
though the dimensions of the individual buildings
vary.
The project will be funded by a gift from an
anonymous donor, who has independently hired Los
Angeles-based Nakada Associates and West
Builders to design and construct the new residence.
"We are extremely involved in the plans," Uni
versity Architect David Neuman said. "University
architects, facilities, project management and the
Law School are all working on it."
Reidy did not designate which four of the houses
on Salvatierra Walk will be cleared. He added that
occupants of these houses will be accommodated to
minimize disruption of their operations.
"We haven't heard anything about it, and I sus
pect if we were to be moved we would have been
told," said senior Caroline Moore-Kochlacs, who
works in the Bridge, currently located in Rogers
house on Salvatierra. "They just spent a lot of money
restoring this house, and when we moved in it
seemed like a permanent arrangement."
A faculty member who asked to remain anony
mous expressed her concern that the building will
blight the aesthetic landscape of this region of cam
pus. Indeed, if built, the structure will likely over
shadow nearby homes.
Reidy sajd that there have been some outreach
programs within the University to address residents'
concerns, and that discussions will continue as the

project progresses.
"Growth is always difficult, and balancing the
many competing factors creates a challenging envi
ronment," he said.
Still, some have questioned whether the residence
will be built too close to Stern, causing congestion
near the undergraduate dorms on East Campus.
"There is no doubt that the density of people and
pedestrian and bike traffic will increase in this area,"
said John Bravman, vice provost for undergraduate
education. "Of course having more graduate stu
dents living on campus will reduce the automobile
commute traffic that many deal with everyday."
Addressing these concerns, Reidy said that the
construction team is concerned about the faculty,
student and staff residents of the surrounding area,
adding that the University has tried to improve
pedestrian and bike circulation.
"The area between Stern Hall and the proposed

project will be improved and designed to enhance
circulation in the area," he said.
Bravman added that he does not foresee the new
residence impacting undergraduate life in any signif
icant way.
The Zapata parking lot was chosen because the
General Use Permit, which controls the University's
use of land, dictates that the new residence must be
built on current Stanford property, despite the limit
ed amount of empty space.
Neuman said architects are brainstorming solu
tions for the parking shortage the building will like
ly cause. Sullivan said the University might compen
sate for lost parking by building large garages near
the new structure.

hopes to alleviate the recent housing crunch that

has left 1,200 graduate students,
and nearly 200 law students
without on-campus housing.
This pinch was somewhat re
lieved by the construction of new
studio departments in Escondi
do Village.
Although many graduate stu
dents continue to live in Palo Alto
and Menlo Park, Bravman said that
on-campus housing vacancies are
becoming more common, especial
ly during winter and spring quar
ters.
However, Sullivan said law stu
dent housing still presents a problem.
"The only law student housing
now is at Crothers, which is seriously
inadequate," she said. "Law students
compete with other graduate stu
dents for campus housing, but not all
get in, and those that do are scattered
across campus."

The location of the new residence
is patterned after housing at both
Yale and the University of Michigan,
where law students live in close prox
imity to their classrooms.
"Learning law is all about dis
cussing ideas and working in
teams," Sullivan said. "Creating
a physical extension of our intel
lectual life in a complete law
school 'campus' would provide
important new common space
for law school events and activi
ties."
According Sullivan, construc
tion will likely start in 2004 or
2005, and the residence will open
its doors in 2006. Although the
building is intended to house law
students, it will probably be
home to other graduate students
as well.
Sullivan said that the Law
School decided it was time to
pursue plans for the new resi
dence to "enhance the quality of
life for student of the future and
make Stanford more attractive to
applicants."

lieved by the construction of new
studio departments in Escondi
do Village.
Although many graduate stu
dents continue to live in Palo Alto
and Menlo Park, Bravman said that
on-campus housing vacancies are
becoming more common, especial
ly during winter and spring quar
ters.
However, Sullivan said law stu
dent housing still presents a problem.
"The only law student housing
now is at Crothers, which is seriously
inadequate," she said. "Law students
compete with other graduate stu
dents for campus housing, but not all
get in, and those that do are scattered
across campus."

The location of the new residence
is patterned after housing at both
Yale and the University of Michigan,
where law students live in close prox
imity to their classrooms.
"Learning law is all about dis
cussing ideas and working in
teams," Sullivan said. "Creating
a physical extension of our intel
lectual life in a complete law
school 'campus' would provide
important new common space
for law school events and activi
ties."
According Sullivan, construc
tion will likely start in 2004 or
2005, and the residence will open
its doors in 2006. Although the
building is intended to house law
students, it will probably be
home to other graduate students
as well.
Sullivan said that the Law
School decided it was time to
pursue plans for the new resi
dence to "enhance the quality of
life for student of the future and
make Stanford more attractive to
applicants."
A large new graduate residence planned near the
Law School to help remedy a housing shortage has
some members of the Stanford community con
cerned.
According to current plans, the residence will
house 600 to 700 students twice as many as Roble
Hall, which sleeps 311, according to the ASSU
Housing Guide.
Mirrielees, the largest undergraduate residence,
houses 435 students, according to the guide.
The residence will also cause the removal of four
houses on Salvatierra Walk.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the Law School,
stressed that the decision to build the residence has
not yet been finalized and that although the project
is becoming more tangible, it remains in its early
stages.
While the Zapata parking lot has been designated
as the site, the Board of Trustees has not yet ap
proved any of the building designs. According to
Robert Reidy, vice provost of land and buildings,
there is only one design under consideration, al
though the dimensions of the individual buildings
vary.
The project will be funded by a gift from an
anonymous donor, who has independently hired Los
Angeles-based Nakada Associates and West
Builders to design and construct the new residence.
"We are extremely involved in the plans," Uni
versity Architect David Neuman said. "University
architects, facilities, project management and the
Law School are all working on it."
Reidy did not designate which four of the houses
on Salvatierra Walk will be cleared. He added that
occupants of these houses will be accommodated to
minimize disruption of their operations.
"We haven't heard anything about it, and I sus
pect if we were to be moved we would have been
told," said senior Caroline Moore-Kochlacs, who
works in the Bridge, currently located in Rogers
house on Salvatierra. "They just spent a lot of money
restoring this house, and when we moved in it
seemed like a permanent arrangement."
A faculty member who asked to remain anony
mous expressed her concern that the building will
blight the aesthetic landscape of this region of cam
pus. Indeed, if built, the structure will likely over
shadow nearby homes.
Reidy sajd that there have been some outreach
programs within the University to address residents'
concerns, and that discussions will continue as the

project progresses.
"Growth is always difficult, and balancing the
many competing factors creates a challenging envi
ronment," he said.
Still, some have questioned whether the residence
will be built too close to Stern, causing congestion
near the undergraduate dorms on East Campus.
"There is no doubt that the density of people and
pedestrian and bike traffic will increase in this area,"
said John Bravman, vice provost for undergraduate
education. "Of course having more graduate stu
dents living on campus will reduce the automobile
commute traffic that many deal with everyday."
Addressing these concerns, Reidy said that the
construction team is concerned about the faculty,
student and staff residents of the surrounding area,
adding that the University has tried to improve
pedestrian and bike circulation.
"The area between Stern Hall and the proposed

project will be improved and designed to enhance
circulation in the area," he said.
Bravman added that he does not foresee the new
residence impacting undergraduate life in any signif
icant way.
The Zapata parking lot was chosen because the
General Use Permit, which controls the University's
use of land, dictates that the new residence must be
built on current Stanford property, despite the limit
ed amount of empty space.
Neuman said architects are brainstorming solu
tions for the parking shortage the building will like
ly cause. Sullivan said the University might compen
sate for lost parking by building large garages near
the new structure.
The new dorm is also one way the University
hopes to alleviate the recent housing crunch that
