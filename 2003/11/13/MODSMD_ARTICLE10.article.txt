# Daily Trainer left out in the cold

GNext time you're awake in lec
ture, listen. No, not to the pro
fessor, but to the background
soundtrack. Do you hear that ca
cophony of coughing, sniffling and sneez
ing? It seems like the Stanford "winter," in
all of its cold and rainy glory, has finally ar
rived. Midterms, sleepless nights and
skipped meals are leaving students' im
mune systems wide open for attack. What
do you think?
A Luckily, the traditional bane of
/\ winter, the flu, has yet to make a
/ 1 strong stand here. But The Mer-
JL cury News reports that the virus
is hitting Northern California early and

hard this year. With 25 percent of potential
flu victims testing positive where 10 percent
constitutes an outbreak, the season promis
es to be rough.

But it's Vaden Health
Center to the rescue, hit
ting us with their best shot,
offering flu vaccinations
every Wednesday, from 3
p.m. to 6 p.m. Until Dec. 3,
students with Cardinal
Care can get one for $lO,
while it's $2O for everyone

else. Take the shot. Go for
the meningococcal menin-

gitis vaccine while you're
at it. Live a long, healthy life.
Less flashy than influenza, the common
cold is what ails most students. A month

after Full Mono on the Quad, some stu
dents are still suffering the ill affects of in
discriminate amorous acts. Yet menaces
other than the promiscuous Tree spread
disease. The dorm environment is extreme
ly friendly to various diseases that can deci
mate a residence in less than a week.
For example, in the tradition of last
year's Toyon plague, a rampant new epi
demic is sweeping through Manzanita. So
perhaps the most important thing anyone
can do to avoid puking her guts is never to
draw north of Escondido Road.
Peer Health Educators help contain epi
demics by stopping them before they start.
Listen to the PHEs when they send out e
mails reminding you to wash your hands and
sleep more (or for some of you, sleep peri
od). Stanford students definitely need more

of both. Other preventative measures in
clude loading up on Vitamin C and Zinc.
Word on the street says that chicken soup,
garlic and tea help with colds, too. Also, a lit
tle exercise never hurt the immune system.
But a little goes a long way, so don't run 20
miles with a cough. It's not pretty. Trust me.
Finally, if you're sick and you love your
roommate, start foisting Vitamin C supple
ments upon them. Vitamin C won't help
you once you're sick, but it can save anyone
that's living in close proximity to you. Of
course, if you hate your annoying room
mate and wish they would die, hide this ar
ticle and start coughing up a storm.
