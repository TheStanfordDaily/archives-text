## Athletics program needs a workout 
### 
At a whopping $270 million,
Stanford University Athletics
boasts the largest endowment
of any university athletic pro
gram. The number certainly dwarfs rival
Cal, which is ranked ninth with a $3 mil
lion endowment. Stanford's massive en
dowment makes its athletic program one
of the best in the country.
However, many students are not able
to enjoy this program. High-priced stu
dent tickets prohibit some from attend
ing games. Most sporting events cost a
few dollars, but football tickets cost at
least $lO per game or $6O for the new
"All Axe-ess pass," which includes sea
son tickets to football games and all
other sporting events, excluding men's
basketball. Student season tickets for
only football games are no longer
available. At $5O for a Big Game ticket,
Stanford students might be better
served scalping a ticket from a Cal stu
dent.

These prices seem particularly steep
when compared to other major universi
ties, where student admission to football
games costs nothing, and admission en
tails only the swipe of a student ID card.
While we are not advocating that all
games at Stanford be free, it seems odd
that other schools with much smaller
athletic endowments give students the
privilege of attending sporting events
for free.

Stanford students should have access
to sporting events to appreciate their
talented classmates. The fruits of the
$270 million endowment should be en
joyed by current students, not just alum
ni and donors who are able to attend the
games. There's no reason why a small
fraction of the endowment cannot go to

ward student admissions.
The high price of tickets is obviously
hurting attendance at games, as the stu
dent section of the stadium has been vir
tually empty for recent home football
games. Not only does this low atten
dance hurt school spirit, but student
athletes are less appreciated for their
achievements.
There is a high incentive for the ath
letic department to lower the cost of
football tickets. If students build a close
connection to attending games as under
graduates, they are more likely to. return
to games as alumni with their spouses,
children and friends. This will increase
ticket sales in the future. But currently,
most students have very little enthusi
asm for football, and this lack of enthu
siasm could carry on into their adult
lives. Less alumni enthusiasm means less
ticket sales and fewer donations to the
athletic department.
Perhaps the issue of ticket prices

should be taken on by the ASSU and
their Absolute Fun initiative, which
brings students together for recreation
al activities. More reasonably priced
student tickets would enable more stu
dents attend football games, which
would be an opportunity for students to
bond and enjoy themselves in a healthy
and constructive way.
The issue of high-priced tickets is an
issue of the quality of student life. Stan-

ford is a school where athletics are val
ued, yet the student population can't al
ways appreciate and enjoy the thriving
athletic program. If students received
free admission to athletic events, more
students will attend, school spirit will in
crease and alumni attendance will grow
in the long term.
