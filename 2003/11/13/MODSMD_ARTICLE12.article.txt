# Co-term change better for students
## 
### 
Last week, the Faculty Senate voted to
make the application process for the
co-terminal master's programs easi
er. The old policy for co-term appli
cants — which specified that students may
apply no earlier than the eighth quarter of en
rollment at Stanford but no later than the
third week of the 11th quarter of undergrad
uate study— was confusing and unwieldy.
The pattern by which full-tuition quarters
were calculated often left students struggling
with the math, and the process was some
times so complicated that some students
missed critical deadlines. We are pleased that
the Faculty Senate addressed the problem
and made the process more logical for stu
dents and department administrators.
Although the unit minimum to apply to a
co-terminal program has now increased to
120 units, this should not be overly burden
some because now Advanced Placement

credit like transfer credit will be appli
cable to this total. This change brings order to
University requirements, as it treats all units
equally.

The chance to co-term is a valuable oppor
tunity for undergraduates looking to explore
graduate study. It allows students to more
fully explore their intellectual interests with
out the commitment that a six-year doctoral
program requires. It also allows students to
continue to work with the faculty they have
grown to know during their undergraduate
years.

The new policy, which brings a sense of
clarity to a confusing and sometimes stressful
process, will undoubtedly benefit students.
We hope that when applying for co-terms,
students will recognize the hard work that the
Faculty Senate, the committee for Graduate
Studies and the Registrar's Office put into
making this policy work.
