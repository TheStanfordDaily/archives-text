## ORDER IN THE COURT? If only the Job Fairy existed 
### 
W r hile driving around the
other day, I heard Alan
Greenspan on the radio
saying that he thinks
that "jobs will be created" over the
next fiscal quarter. This exciting
revelation prompted the following
question from my traveling com
panion: How does a job get "creat
ed" exactly? Assuming you don't
believe in tne Job Fairy (and boy do
I have bad news for you seniors
putting a tooth under your pillow in
hopes that it will be replaced
overnight by a McKinsey job offer),
this is a very interesting question.
One answer might be the in
creasing size of the population. At
least, that's what I think my mother
meant when she told me, "You see,
Eric, when two people really love
each other, they get together and
nine months later there's a lot of
work to do." But with all apologies
to dear old Mom, it seems clear that
when it comes to creating jobs, pop
ulation growth takes a back seat to
the real catalyst: language growth.
English is just too damn big.
Need proof? Watch the National
Spelling Bee. The winning word
from 1995 was "xanthosis." The
grammar checker won't even admit
that's a word. It thinks I have simply
misspelled an everyday word like
"antnodia" or "canthans." And the
language is getting bigger the
OxforaEnglisn Dictionary needs to
publish regular supplements just to
keep up. Rumor has it we've made a

hostile takeover bid for Swedish.
The unchecked expansion of lan
guage demands occupations whose
job it is to occupy specialized lin
guistic niches. Law school is basical
ly three years of learning how to ma-

nipulate obscure
remnants of long
dead languages
that have been
kept alive due to
the lobbying ef
forts of the Amer
ican Bar Associa
tion. Consider the
following opening
sentence from an
1887 Minnesota
Supreme Court
opinion: "Re
plevin for a cow."

Rather than being some kind of mir
acle bovine drug, "replevin" is actu
ally a legal cause of action for the re
covery of property. Basically, the
plaintiff here is paying his lawyer
$5OO an hour simply because she
knows Middle English for "Give me
my cow back, you cow-stealing bas
tard."

But language doesn't just create
jobs via entrenchment. It can also be
proactive. The tech boom of the '9os
provides a perfect example. In order
to bring the economy out of the dol
drums, software engmeers began in
venting terms like "high-perfor
mance real-time XML-based Web
services technology." They'd then
go to Fortune 500 companies and

try to convince them that although
they'd been doing quite well these
past 40 years or so, they faced finan
cial apocalypse without this kind of
"middleware." Impressed by the en
gineers' creativity, the mid-level
execs on the other end of the sales
pitch would pay several million dol
lars to join the linguistic fraternity,
enabling them to run bragging to
their bosses about how much they'd
improved "enterprise sales chain ef
ficiency." Then they'd cover their
rear ends by hiring an IT depart
ment fluent in engineer-speak to
figure out what the neck they d just
bought. Is it any wonder jobs were
created and the economy skyrock
eted? Too bad the massive increase
in computer science education had
to ruin the exclusivity of the linguis
tic cartel and create a recession.
But I don't think the current out
look is so grim. Hopefully, the next
wave of recovery can build upon the
lessons of the last. Market analysts
are already looking to biotech as the
next Big Thing. After all, what For
tune 500 company could possibly
compete in the 21st century market
without recombinant DNA splic
ing?
