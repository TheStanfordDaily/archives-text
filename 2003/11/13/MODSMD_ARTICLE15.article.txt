UC-Santa Cruz would've shied
away from controversy

I am a second year student at UC-
Santa Cruz and I visited Stanford on
Tuesday to hear Israeli Knesset
Member Limor Livnat. I happened
to pick up a copy of The Stanford
Daily and I was surprised to see all
the fuss generated by the Campus
truth.org ad campaign.
Your editor in chief, Ramin Se
toodeh, has shown tremendous fair
ness in publishing the ads that ap
pear to be controversial. I know
from experience that the newspaper
of UC-Santa Cruz, City On a Hill
Press would censor such ads and
wouldn't bother allowing any oppos
ing view to be heard. Last year the
faculty instructor of our newspaper
was a signer of the UC Divestment
Pledge; he was very fond of publish
ing anything that was anti-Zionist.
Nothing in UCSC's student paper
ever mentions anything positive
about Israel.

Nothing in UCSC's paper ever
condemns Palestinian terrorism.
Indeed what I read at Santa Cruz
about Israel, is that "the Jewish state
is a puss sore in the Middle East" as
well as other nasty things and week
after week (we don't have the funds
to be a daily paper in Santa Cruz) the
cheap attacks on Israel make a sham
of journalism.
I saw the ads at Campustruth.org

and what they are doing is reminding
readers via photographs of recent
events. Criticisms of "racism" being
hurled at publishing the pho
tographs that caught tragic and
shameful moments are unfounded.
Frivolously hurling the charge of
racism dilutes the meaning when the
charge of racism is appropriate. In
Santa Cruz, too often we use the
word "racism" when what we are re
ally trying to say is we vehemently
disagree. Stanford should not bring
itself to our low level. The term
racism is certainly not appropriate in
this case.

These ads remind us that Israel
and the United States are allies be
cause both countries revere life,
both are democratic, both promote
freedom of the press, freedom of
speech, both strive for peace to
gether against a bellicose and ter
ror-minded enemy, both promote
equal rights for women, gays and
minorities.

These ads remind us to hope for
the day when all Arabs and Muslims
in the Middle East join with Israelis
to routinely celebrate their freedom.
There is nothing that your truly
genuine free speech minded newspa
per has to be ashamed of for publish
ing these ads.

Editorial shouldn't have criticized
the Stanford Band

The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board could do better than take
cheap shots at the Stanford Band
("Band Needs to Improve Behav
ior," Nov. 10). Certainly Band mem
bers should have behaved more re
sponsibly, but if you are looking for
persons behaving badly at Stanford,
there are more important issues to
focus on. You might start with Uni
versity President John Hennessy,
who continues to drag his feet on is
sues relating to economic justice for
Stanford workers. The staff of the
Hoover Institute may practice better
personal hygiene than Band mem
bers, but their right-wing worldview
had led to the deaths of thousands of
people in the quagmire known as
Iraq. Finally, The Daily could look
at its own behavior in running a se
ries of ads designed to foment hatred
of Palestinians.
The Stanford Band is one of the
few iconoclastic, free thinking orga
nizations left on a campus that is in
creasing bent on stifling dissent and
promoting money and militarism
over just and humane values.
The Band rocks!
