# OP-ED
## Defining the 'third' side 
### AMIR AMIRKHANY 
So far the letters to The Daily re
garding the ads by the One Truth
Organization have focused on the
racist and offending nature of the
advertisements. Only recently, there
was a letter by Jagjit Singh ("Letters

to the Editor, Nov
10) that took a differ
ent approach and
pointed to a very im
portant issue, wnich I
can call the "third"
side to the stories.
This third side is es
sentially the underly
ing reason and moti
vation behind the in
cidents. I am not par
ticularly trying to op-

pose or agree with Singh's state
ments or with the advertisements,
but I'd rather take the opportunity
to raise some questions that could
possibly lead to this third side for the
two stories mentioned in the ads.
Once the motivations are found,
only those conclusions are valid that
are consistent.

Let's first consider the suicide
bombing ad that has already been
published a couple of times in The
Daily: A suicide bomber blows up
himself and causes 29 deaths and 160
injuries, 20 of which serious, and
earns his family $25,000, a furnished
apartment, pension for life and
celebrity status. When I read this ad,
I tend to ask myself: Wasn't there
any better way for the bomber to get

a furnished apartment for his family
than killing himself? Was $25,000 re
ally a motivation for him to give up
his life? With the unstable situation
in Palestine and strict worldwide
monitoring of all funds and transac
tions, how could he depend on a life
time pension for his family and feel

comfortable leaving them alone? If
all these can serve as motivations,
who is responsible for making him
and others like him so desperate that
they sell their own lives for such
petty prices? At the end, if they can
not serve as motivations, what were
the bomber's goals and motiva
tions?

I never let myself judge ordi
nary people as inhumane, or as
people who don't respect inno
cent people's lives. Any ordinary
person has his or her own beloved
ones, and sympathizes with other
people's sufferings. Such an indi
vidual would never be pleased if a
mother, a father or a child is
killed. So, if anything, like the 9 /
11 celebration ads, suggests some

thing to the contrary, I stop to
think: Why might some people
celebrate the death of innocent
souls? If they did celebrate, what
was it that they were celebrating?
What was hit on 9 /11 from a for
eigner's point of view was it the
United States, the twin towers or

the people? Would they
celebrate 9/11 if it had
happened in another
country, like France or
other European coun
tries, and innocent peo
ple were killed? I might
still wonder: What was fi
nally the reason that they
celebrated? Did they
have a right to do so?
Would I nave done the
same thing?

Different people might get to
different conclusions from the
same set of questions. Some might
even prefer to look at the issue
from a different point of view and
raise other questions. In my view,
what is important is to ask the ques
tions, consider the third side and
try to analyze the information that
is provided to us. The fact is that
the truth will prevail even if only
one side of the story is presented,
provided that right questions are
asked and may this be the case at
the end of this controversy.
