# UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN
## No lights on and nobody's home 
### 
Fifteen years ago, modern
architect I. M. Pei erected
a giant glass pyramid in the
courtyard of the tradition
al Louvre Museum, and Paris ex
ploded in controversy. It was a
city divided: children against par
ents, teachers against students,
husbands against wives. Some
Parisians continue this debate
today, between smoking
cigarettes and bashing America.
Similarly, in the 19605, New York
was horrified by Robert Moses'
destruction of the magnificent
Penn Station in favor of the more
pragmatic structure that stands on
the West Side today.
Much, if not all, of Italy's
charm lies in its abhorrence of
such historical desecrations. Ital
ians take great pains to display
their proud past, such that the
sight of scaffolding nine times out
of 10 indicates restoration, not
construction. If building restric
tions at Stanford seem stiff, see
how far you get designing a mod
ernist glass pyramid for the center
of St. Peter s in Rome. Historical
purity is prized to the point where
the medieval or Baroque version
of any given city is valued far
above the current incarnation.
Nowhere is this strange set of
priorities more pronounced than
in the fairyland called Venice.
Over the past few centuries, most
inhabited parts of the world have
seen some change. California, for
example, has a shockingly differ
ent landscape than it did in, say,
1700. Venice, on the other hand,
can be successfully navigated
using an 18th century Canaletto
painting. This fact, on a sunny
day, makes Venice a strong con
tender for the most beautiful city
in existence. Long black gondolas
float down peaceful canals and
their passengers gaze up at proud,
aristocratic palazzos. The small
shops that line the streets sparkle
with delicate glass birds, lace fans
and exquisite carnevale masks.
San Marco, famous for its pigeon
filled piazza and dazzling mosaics,
is the most magnificent church I
have ever seen (this is says quite a
bit even though I am Jewish
since American students in Italy
could set a record for greatest
number of churches seen in a peri

od of three months). When I was a
little girl, I used to imagine this
magical city that had rivers for
streets and boats instead of cars. It
couldn't be real.
It shouldn't be. At age 4,1 was
on to something.
Wandering the streets of
Venice last week, I began to ask
myself why the city felt strange.
Why, for example, was English
heard far more than Italian?
Where were the barbershops, su
permarkets and opticians? How
many adorable glass stores does
one city need? If that group of
teenagers just got out of tneir
Venetian high school for the day,
why were they speaking Ger
man? Does anyone actually live
here?
The answer is: not really. As a
city, Venice is pretty dead. Some
charitably describe it as a muse
um; others prefer Disneyland.
Halfway through the 20th century,
life in Venice became impractical,
and residents began leaving in
droves. The population has been
declining ever since, leaving it
today at about one-third of what it
was 50 years ago. There are sever
al reasons for this flight. Cars
increasingly essential to postwar
life are difficult to park on the
Grand Canal. Impossible, some
might argue. Furthermore, Venice
was becoming increasingly expen
sive and property extremely valu
able, sucn that heirs to palazzos
were wise to sell them and move
elsewhere. These palazzos are
now owned largely by wealthy for
eigners who use them for a few
weeks each year. I searched in
vain for an illuminated window in
anypalazzo.
Those who work in Venice
most likely base their livelihood
on tourism, and the vast majority
commute from one of the outlying
towns, Mestre in particular.
Venice, like its palazzos and its
masks, has been reduced to a
beautiful facade with a rich histo
ry.
Florence can be accused of sim
ilar shortcomings, but to a lesser
extent. I do have a real sense of
what contemporary Florentines
are like. The city also has its share
of vibrant nightlife and young
people (many of whom do, in fact,

live in the cityl. Every so often,
though, as I walk to class past the
colossal Duomo, Ghiberti's
bronze panels, Michelangelo's
David and over the Ponte Vecchio
("Old Bridge"), I wonder how
long the Florentines can continue
living on their Renaissance ac
complishments. I just might be liv
ing in a museum.
Curiously, this does not seem
to bother Italians. In Venice, I
asked a bartender named Diego
about contemporary Venetian
culture. Diego commutes daily
from Mestre, though he was born
in Venice and considers himself
fully Venetian.
"We have so many old tradi
tions," was the reply I garnered
from his rapidly spoken Italian.
"Yes," I saia. "But today's
Venetians, what is their culture
like?"
"Venetians are a very proud
people with a rich history."
"Right," I pressed. "But who
actually lives in Venice now?"
"I don't know," Diego paused.
"Very few people."
America's disregard for its past
can be infuriating. My first year at
Stanford, the thing I missed most
about New York (other than 24-
hour subway transportation) is a
sense of the past. New York has a
habit of destroying the symbols of
its history as soon as a better op
tion presents itself, but California
barely has a past to demolish. At
least, though, the States are alive.
Real people live in the cities all
year round. The buildings, bridges
and streets are functional, if not
always beautiful. The next time I
mourn the loss of Penn Station or,
worse yet, the presence of count
less fast food chains on El
Camino, I can at least console my
self with the knowledge that these
are natural and unforced products
of their time and place. If, in 400
years, families are traveling across
oceans to take tours of defunct In
n-Out's, then we can start to
worry.
