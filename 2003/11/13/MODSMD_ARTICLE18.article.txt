## A 						disappointing legacy 
### ZIYAD JABAJI 
"Mom, am I really an Arab?"
As surprising as it may sound,
this question was a crucial one in my
early life. Growing up Arab-Ameri
can in Los Angeles, 8,000 miles
away from my family's homeland, I
struggled with identity issues for a
large part of my life. During the Per
sian Gulf War, when I was still only
7 years old, I was confronted by the
other children in school with com
ments like, "I bet Saddam Hussein
is your uncle," or "You're just a
sand-nigger." I was largely ignorant
of the magnitude of such attitudes
as I lacked a proper understanding
of my background. This wasn't be
cause of any family alienation with
the Arab world — my parents had
themselves only immigrated to the
States in the late 70s, Arabic was my
first language and my family is as
proud of its heritage as any other in
this world. Instead, it was a result of
the media's depiction of my people
— I, a Palestinian born in the West,
was limited by these Western myths
of the Orient. I was ashamed of
being an Arab, thinking that we
were a petty, barbarous people.
And then came 9/11; the after
math of which changed everything.
Even in our little Palo Alto, the tires
of a Palestinian youth's car were
slashed. Hate crimes were directed
blindly throughout the nation at
Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs
and anybody related to the Middle

East. They at least were not discrim
inating in this respect. Why should
they be? The media portrayal of the
Middle East doesn't distinguish be
tween the inhabitants of the region,
the worldwide Arab and Muslim
populations and anyone who ap
pears even remotely Middle East
ern. How can the average American
hope to distinguish images of Arabs
from those of Africans, Indians, Per
sians, or even Latinos based on un
representative sound bytes and
short videos? Immediately after the
attacks, the media presented the en
tire Oriental world as being culprit
to the devastating attacks, even be
fore the first mention of Osama Bin
Laden. The media has done little
since then to dispel these myths, and
it appears as though they haven't yet
realized the role they played in cre
ating them.

Anyone in the Stanford commu
nity can see one manifestation of
this trend. Over these past few
weeks and for the weeks to come,
The Stanford Daily has been pub
lishing advertisements for the orga
nization One Truth Foundation. It
is evident from even a superficial
examination of the ads as well as
their Web site Campustruth.org,
they publicize that this organization
is one of many established to take
advantage of the media's compla
cency. They are running a smear
campaign against the Palestinians in
particular and, by natural extension,
the Arabs in general. It is a tribute

to the Stanford community that
there has been such a sizable and
outspoken dialogue concerning
whether or not such ads are appro
priate in our midst. It is unfortunate,
however, that the only constructive
dialogue has been limited to the
issue of journalistic responsibility.
The much more important question
concerning Palestine and Israel
has all but degenerated into a
match of insults and ridiculous gen
eralizations.

The depiction of all Arabs as ter
rorists has become one of the most
glaringly visible political weapons
of our time. To oppose this portray
al has become equivalent to dis
agreeing with a political opinion.
This is precisely why The Daily has
refused to discontinue the series of
ads it is their position that the ads
provide nothing more than "a con
troversial opinion." However, in the
process, they have done nothing less
than to perpetuate a disappointing
legacy of racist and libelous misrep
resentation of minorities in the
Western media.
