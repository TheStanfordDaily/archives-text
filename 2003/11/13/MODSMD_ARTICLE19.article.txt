## Scott Allen talks football and midterms 
### 
You gotta love the quarter system,
where, like the NFL season, every
week matters, I've poured over
pages of course readers, lecture
notes and Powerpoint slides this week like a
Stanford wide receiver dutifully learning the
complex playbook of Buddy Teevens' Fun 'n'
oh, wait. If only neuroscience were as sim
ple as memorizing three variations of a run up
the middle.

After extending its winning streak to two
games, the Stanford football team deserves
mentioning for a third consecutive week. J.R.
Lemon ran for a sick 156 yards and two touch
downs, while Chris Lewis turned in his best
game of the season.
But honestly, what's up with the draw
play? The Cardinal runs it so often that it's
bound to yield a few yards the 50th time if
only for the fact that the defense is convinced
Teevens couldn't possibly call the play again.
It's sort of like half-heartedly studying the

essay questions on a practice
exam because you assume
there's no way your profes
sor would ask the same ques
tion come test day. Whoops.
The buzzwords around
campus are no longer "rock
bottom" but "bowl eligible,"
two words I refuse to utter
(much less write about) in
the context of Cardinal foot
ball at least not until Stan-

ford takes care of business this Saturday.
Instead, I'm copping out and rambling
about various goings-on in the sports world.
If Bill Walton can make money to sit court
side at NBA games and babble incomprehen
sibly about anything and everything week
after week, I'm entitled to do it once for free
from the comfort of my own room.
One reason "Monday Night Football" de
served at least a look during commercials of
"The Next Joe Millionaire" earlier this week:
A 1 Michaels, speaking over a video of two
men working at a Green Bay sauerkraut fac
tory: "More sauerkraut is made here than in
the entire country of Germany." John Mad
den: "You know, when you've got two guys
with pitchforks, that's gotta be true." Maybe
you just had to see it.
One reason to stick to "Joe," where at
least they don't pretend to be rational: Inex
plicably, Packers defensive tackles Gilbert
Brown and Grady Jackson (340 and 350
pounds, respectively, undoubtedly after fast
ing for a month) were shafted when the
Snickers Hungriest Player award was given to
Donovan McNabb and Ahman Green.
Major League Baseball is working to es
tablish a World Cup of baseball to be held in
the spring of 2005. Teams would consist of
top stars from Major League teams, repre
senting their native countries. Hey, that's a
swell idea. Not.
First, why would baseball, or any sport for
that matter, strive to be more like soccer?
Second, is this supposed to make Americans
forget about the fact that the United States
won't even compete in the 2004 Olympics
thanks to an embarrassing loss to Mexico in a
qualifying game last week?
That's like Kenya failing to qualify long
distance runners or Canada failing to qualify,
um, stoned snowboarders.
I refused to let myself buy into the un
precedented hype surrounding Leßron
James and a sick, sick part of me wanted the
likes of second-round draft picks Sofoklis
Schortsanitis and Szymon Szewczyk to out
shine the Akron, Ohio native and make the
self-prescribed experts look like Scott-pre
scribed idiots.
Besides, hearing announcers and fans
sweat and swoon over those two names would
be somewhat amusing. Alas, King James, or
whatever the cool kids are calling him now,
has been the real deal thus far and the only
real idiots are people like myself for pass
ing him up in fantasy basketball drafts.
Back to the NFL, where Bengals wide re
ceiver Chad Johnson guaranteed a victory
earlier this week in anticipation of Sunday's
game against the undefeated Chiefs. A pretty
bold statement for sure, but one of my inside
sources (read: imaginary) informed me that
Baylor place kicker Kenny Webb has guaran
teed victory over undefeated Oklahoma this
Saturday. Perhaps victory means covering the
ridiculous 52 1/2 point spread.
Critics can bash Redskins head coach
Steve Spurrier all they want, but his decision
to go for it on fourth-and-one from the Red
skins' 25-yard line with the game tied and six
minutes remaining was the gutsiest call of the
NFL season.
Sure, if the Skins didn't convert Spurrier
might be out of a job and I'd be hiding under
a rock somewhere, but that's why I love the
guy-
On the other hand, putting off reading
until the day before an exam isn't a gutsy call,
it's plain stupid.
I feel like it's fourth-and-24 from my own
goal line, trailing by six, no timeouts left and
a minute to go. No sweat, I'll just call the draw
play.

Scott Allen is a stressed-out junior who wishes
you luck on your midterms. He guarantees
Stanford will call a draw play on first down at
least six times on Saturday. E-mail him at

mentioning for a third consecutive week. J.R.
Lemon ran for a sick 156 yards and two touch
downs, while Chris Lewis turned in his best
game of the season.
But honestly, what's up with the draw
play? The Cardinal runs it so often that it's
bound to yield a few yards the 50th time if
only for the fact that the defense is convinced
Teevens couldn't possibly call the play again.
It's sort of like half-heartedly studying the

essay questions on a practice
exam because you assume
there's no way your profes
sor would ask the same ques
tion come test day. Whoops.
The buzzwords around
campus are no longer "rock
bottom" but "bowl eligible,"
two words I refuse to utter
(much less write about) in
the context of Cardinal foot
ball at least not until Stan-

ford takes care of business this Saturday.
Instead, I'm copping out and rambling
about various goings-on in the sports world.
If Bill Walton can make money to sit court
side at NBA games and babble incomprehen
sibly about anything and everything week
after week, I'm entitled to do it once for free
from the comfort of my own room.
One reason "Monday Night Football" de
served at least a look during commercials of
"The Next Joe Millionaire" earlier this week:
A 1 Michaels, speaking over a video of two
men working at a Green Bay sauerkraut fac
tory: "More sauerkraut is made here than in
the entire country of Germany." John Mad
den: "You know, when you've got two guys
with pitchforks, that's gotta be true." Maybe
you just had to see it.
One reason to stick to "Joe," where at
least they don't pretend to be rational: Inex
plicably, Packers defensive tackles Gilbert
Brown and Grady Jackson (340 and 350
pounds, respectively, undoubtedly after fast
ing for a month) were shafted when the
Snickers Hungriest Player award was given to
Donovan McNabb and Ahman Green.
Major League Baseball is working to es
tablish a World Cup of baseball to be held in
the spring of 2005. Teams would consist of
top stars from Major League teams, repre
senting their native countries. Hey, that's a
swell idea. Not.
First, why would baseball, or any sport for
that matter, strive to be more like soccer?
Second, is this supposed to make Americans
forget about the fact that the United States
won't even compete in the 2004 Olympics
thanks to an embarrassing loss to Mexico in a
qualifying game last week?
That's like Kenya failing to qualify long
distance runners or Canada failing to qualify,
um, stoned snowboarders.
I refused to let myself buy into the un
precedented hype surrounding Leßron
James and a sick, sick part of me wanted the
likes of second-round draft picks Sofoklis
Schortsanitis and Szymon Szewczyk to out
shine the Akron, Ohio native and make the
self-prescribed experts look like Scott-pre
scribed idiots.
Besides, hearing announcers and fans
sweat and swoon over those two names would
be somewhat amusing. Alas, King James, or
whatever the cool kids are calling him now,
has been the real deal thus far and the only
real idiots are people like myself for pass
ing him up in fantasy basketball drafts.
Back to the NFL, where Bengals wide re
ceiver Chad Johnson guaranteed a victory
earlier this week in anticipation of Sunday's
game against the undefeated Chiefs. A pretty
bold statement for sure, but one of my inside
sources (read: imaginary) informed me that
Baylor place kicker Kenny Webb has guaran
teed victory over undefeated Oklahoma this
Saturday. Perhaps victory means covering the
ridiculous 52 1/2 point spread.
Critics can bash Redskins head coach
Steve Spurrier all they want, but his decision
to go for it on fourth-and-one from the Red
skins' 25-yard line with the game tied and six
minutes remaining was the gutsiest call of the
NFL season.
Sure, if the Skins didn't convert Spurrier
might be out of a job and I'd be hiding under
a rock somewhere, but that's why I love the
guy-
On the other hand, putting off reading
until the day before an exam isn't a gutsy call,
it's plain stupid.
I feel like it's fourth-and-24 from my own
goal line, trailing by six, no timeouts left and
a minute to go. No sweat, I'll just call the draw
play.

Scott Allen is a stressed-out junior who wishes
you luck on your midterms. He guarantees
Stanford will call a draw play on first down at
least six times on Saturday. E-mail him at
