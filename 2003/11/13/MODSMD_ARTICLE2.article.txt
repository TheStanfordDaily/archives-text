# Workshop examines student space ideas

### ILENA GEORGE DESK EDITOR 
Administrators, staff and students participated in a workshop yester
day designed to evaluate the use of space in the center of campus which
includes Tresidder Union, White Plaza and Old Union. The "open-space"
areas in and around the campus center were specifically targeted.
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for student affairs, explained that one of
the main goals of the workshop was to generate salient points that the
space planning committee created to investigate and find solutions for
the question of student space on campus will address at their next meet
ing.
"We have architects ... that will be presenting a couple of options for
the interior space for the buildings that surround White Plaza," Awakuni
said. "This is the exterior work that is going to be folded into the work that
we're doing to the interior structures of the buildings."
The workshop began with an introduction by David Neuman, Stan
ford's architect, and Donlyn Lyndon, a consultant for the project, who
presented photographs, from the past and the present, of the area in ques
tion, compared the area to Italian architecture and explained how some of
the structures in White Plaza and its environs were aesthetically effective
and useful in terms of urban planning of public spaces.
Afterward, the participants split into groups and stationed themselves
in different spots throughout the center of campus. They evaluated how
the community used the space, what seemed to be effective and what
could use improvement. The workshop culminated in an open forum
wherein the participants and concerned community members voiced their
opinions.
According to Lyndon, several issues were brought up that would be
pertinent to future meetings of the planning committee.
"The observation was several times made that there is a conflict in cir
culation [in the area around the Birdcage]," said Lyndon. "The conflict
between this as a kind of information gathering place, a place where peo
ple can encounter and inform each other and its function as a kind of
throughway of circulation through the campus is something that needs a
little bit more modulation."
He also mentioned the space around and between Dinkelspiel Audito
rium and Tresidder as rife with opportunities for modification and im
provement.
"I think there is great potential in sorting out the entry between
Dinkelspiel and Tresidder," he said. "There's not a lot of symbiosis there;
the pieces don't reinforce each other."
Cathy Blake, assistant director of campus planning and designing, ex
plained that there are two committees working on improving student
space in the center of campus one focusing on the interior of the build
ings and one, the University Committee for Land and Buildings, focusing
on the exterior, open spaces. The first group will finish their planning in
December, after which the UCLB will be able to create more concrete
plans around their decisions. She said that an open forum where stu
dent input will play a big role could take place in March or April.
