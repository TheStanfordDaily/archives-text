# Women face tough L.A. road trip
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Women's volleyball has been dominated this year by
the Pacific 10 Conference. In the latest USA Today/
AVCA Coaches poll, five Pac-10 teams are ranked in the
nation's top-11, the No. 1 spot has been held throughout
the year by defending national champion Southern Cali
fornia and, as a whole, the Pac-10 has gone 71-24 against
non-conference opponents on the season.
This weekend, the No. 7 Cardinal (18-5,11-3 Pac-10)
has its most critical road trip yet, traveling to Los Angeles
to face No. 8 UCLA (20-5,11-4) on Thursday and No. 1
USC (24-0, 15-0) on Friday. While USC has already
clinched a share of the Pac-10 title, the real fight for Stan
ford is not for first place, but for second.
Entering last weekend, USC held a strong three-game
lead in the conference over Stanford, UCLA and Califor
nia, which were all tied for second at 10-3 in league play.
With its win over California last Friday and UCLA's loss
to Arizona, Stanford now sits alone in second place at 11-
3 in conference while UCLA and California both have
four conference losses apiece.
"This will be one of the more important weekends

we've had because UCLA is in the hunt for second place
with us and USC is at the top of the conference and these
games can really affect the standings," said junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani who was named Pac-10 Player of
the Week on Nov. 10. "The Pac-10 is such a strong con
ference this year and has gained a lot of respect in the
country, so doing well in the conference can really help
our seeding in the NCAA's."
If last month's matchup between the Cardinal and
the Bruins is any indication of how tonight's match will
unfold, then fans are in store for a treat. When UCLA
traveled to the Farm back on Oct. 16, Stanford stormed
back from a two-game deficit to win the match in game
five.-
"Unfortunately, they will have the home court advan
tage, but we're looking at it as an advantage for us because
when you're on the road and away from school you can
focus more on the match," Nnamani said. "UCLA is a
great team and we'll need to be ready to come out strong
in game one and set the tone of the match, so that extra
focus can really help us."
While the Cardinal has little hope of catching USC for
the Pac-10 title, Friday's match could still impact Stan
ford's postseason seeding if it can pull off the upset

and obviously a great deal of pride is at stake for the Car
dinal.
Last season, the Trojans defeated Stanford 3-1 to claim
the 2002 NCAA title, denying the Cardinal any hopes of
repeating as national champion. The first time the two
teams met this season, USC defeated Stanford 3-0 in front
of large homecoming crowd of 3,549 at Maples Pavilion.
USC is currently on a 36-match winning streak ex
tending back to last season and the Trojans have only
dropped four games in their 24 matches this year.
"USC is a very good team. They are very balanced and
are strong at every position," Nnamani said. "They play
with three attackers and we've been working really hard
on our blocking and being able to use our instincts on
blocking when you have to defend against three hitters all
of the time. We've been playing better and are going to
have to work hard, but we are ready."
One thing the Cardinal has in its favor is its capacity to
stifle both opponents at the net. Senior middle blocker
Jennifer Harvey is still leading the conference in blocks
with 1.52 blocks per game and Nnamani has been on a hit
ting tear the last couple weeks.
Both matches are set for 7 p.m. and can be heard on
90.1 KZSU.
