# Card preps for first tourney match
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
When the bracket for the 2003
NCAA Women's College Cup
came out on Monday afternoon,
the Stanford women's soccer
team was filled with mixed emo
tions. On the one hand, the Car
dinal actually made the postsea
son tournament despite a
mediocre record. But on the
other, Stanford found itself faced
with a first-round matchup
against cross-town rival No. 3
Santa Clara (12-3-5), which dom
inated the Cardinal in a meeting
earlier this season.
Friday night, the Cardinal will
travel to Santa Clara for a 7:30
p.m. matchup in Buck Shaw Sta
dium, one of the toughest places
to play in all of collegiate soccer.
"We were excited just to get
in," sophomore defender Hayley
Hunt said. "Our bracket's really
hard, but it's a good opportunity
to gain momentum. It's really a
bad draw for them because we've
played our best against good
teams."
One thing working in Stan
ford's favor is the momentum it
has coming off a dramatic over
time win over California. The vic
tory was highlighted by senior
midfielder Allyson Marquand's
golden goal in the 99th minute.
However, the Broncos have a
streak of their own going that
isn't too shabby. Santa Clara
hasn't dropped a match since a 3-
0 loss to Southern California on

Sept. 26.
The match looks to be an epic
battle of potent offense versus
staunch defense.
The Broncos posted a devas
tating 2.65 goal per game aver
age, while the Cardinal boasts a
back line filled with experience
and straight-up talent.
Santa Clara's offense is led by
junior midfielder Leslie Osborne.
Osborne, who joined Stanford's
Natalie Spilger, Nicole Barnhart
and Marquand on last summer's
Nordic Cup-winning Under-21
National Team, has tallied 11
goals and six assists in 20 games.
Freshman Tina Estrada has
also put up impressive statistics
for the Broncos. The highly tout
ed recruit has found the back of
the net six times and assisted on
four of her teammates' goals.
Not to be overlooked is senior
forward Veronica Zepeda. While
her statistics indicate otherwise
(three goals, five assists), Zepeda
is perhaps the most talented and
dangerous player on the Santa
Clara roster.
The 5-foot-2 forward has been
forced to play limited minutes
due to a seemingly endless string
of leg injuries, the most recent
problem being shin splints.
However, Zepeda has come
off the bench in 14 games to pro
vide an invaluable boost for the
Broncos and without a doubt will
be an impact player in the tourna-

ment.
What may be even more impressive
than individual statistics, though, is the
Broncos' team play. Twelve different
players have scored goals, and eight of
those 12 have scored at least four goals.
By contrast, nine Stanford players
have found the back of the net and only
two of those players, Marquand and for
ward Brittany Oliveira, have four or more
goals.
Oliveira, however, will not be available
for the Cardinal. In her final career match
at Maloney Field and with the squad look
ing healthy for the first time all season, the
senior went down with a torn ACL.
"[Brittany's] been a good sport about

everything," Hunt said. "It was really
tough the way it happened in her last
[regular season] game as a senior. And we
count on her on offense."
While Santa Clara's offense certainly
poses an imminent threat to any defense it
faces, Stanford will not be taking the field
with unloaded guns.
Just for starters, the Cardinal boasts
two "Soccer Buzz Magazine" preseason
All-Americans in junior goalkeeper Barn
hart and senior sweeper Spilger.
Probably the best collegiate keeper in
the country, Barnhart carries a 0.78 goals
allowed average and has posted seven
shutouts this season. And more impor
tantly, she has played her best when it re
ally counts, posting impressive shutouts
against then-No. 3 UCLA's lethal offense
and then-No. 2 Notre Dame.
Spilger has made intelligent decisions
on the field for the Cardinal all season
long, stifling oppenents' attacks with accu

rate clearances and making Barnhart's job
just that much easier.
Senior Alisan Pabon has also been a
major factor on defense all season long
and her almost unparalleled quickness
will be needed to keep up with the Bronco
forwards.
Rounding out the defense are the Hunt
twins, Hayley and Lindsey, who have both
come back from early-season injuries to
contribute strongly for the Cardinal.
One key for the Stanford offense will
be to score the first goal. The Cardinal has
not lost a match when it gets on the board
first.
"[Scoring first] will definitely be really
important for us," Hunt said. "Or not giv
ing up a goal. If we don't give up a goal, we
feel like we can find a way to win."
The team that comes out on top will
face either Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (18-
1-2) or Arizona State (12-4-3) in the sec
ond round on Sunday at 1 p.m.
