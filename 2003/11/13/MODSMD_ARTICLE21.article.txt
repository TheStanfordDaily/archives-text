# Card preps for first tourney match
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
When the bracket for the 2003
NCAA Women's College Cup
came out on Monday afternoon,
the Stanford women's soccer
team was filled with mixed emo
tions. On the one hand, the Car
dinal actually made the postsea
son tournament despite a
mediocre record. But on the
other, Stanford found itself faced
with a first-round matchup
against cross-town rival No. 3
Santa Clara (12-3-5), which dom
inated the Cardinal in a meeting
earlier this season.
Friday night, the Cardinal will
travel to Santa Clara for a 7:30
p.m. matchup in Buck Shaw Sta
dium, one of the toughest places
to play in all of collegiate soccer.
"We were excited just to get
in," sophomore defender Hayley
Hunt said. "Our bracket's really
hard, but it's a good opportunity
to gain momentum. It's really a
bad draw for them because we've
played our best against good
teams."
One thing working in Stan
ford's favor is the momentum it
has coming off a dramatic over
time win over California. The vic
tory was highlighted by senior
midfielder Allyson Marquand's
golden goal in the 99th minute.
However, the Broncos have a
streak of their own going that
isn't too shabby. Santa Clara
hasn't dropped a match since a 3-
0 loss to Southern California on

Sept. 26.
The match looks to be an epic
battle of potent offense versus
staunch defense.
The Broncos posted a devas
tating 2.65 goal per game aver
age, while the Cardinal boasts a
back line filled with experience
and straight-up talent.
Santa Clara's offense is led by
junior midfielder Leslie Osborne.
Osborne, who joined Stanford's
Natalie Spilger, Nicole Barnhart
and Marquand on last summer's
Nordic Cup-winning Under-21
National Team, has tallied 11
goals and six assists in 20 games.
Freshman Tina Estrada has
also put up impressive statistics
for the Broncos. The highly tout
ed recruit has found the back of
the net six times and assisted on
four of her teammates' goals.
Not to be overlooked is senior
forward Veronica Zepeda. While
her statistics indicate otherwise
(three goals, five assists), Zepeda
is perhaps the most talented and
dangerous player on the Santa
Clara roster.
The 5-foot-2 forward has been
forced to play limited minutes
due to a seemingly endless string
of leg injuries, the most recent
problem being shin splints.
However, Zepeda has come
off the bench in 14 games to pro
vide an invaluable boost for the
Broncos and without a doubt will
be an impact player in the tourna-
