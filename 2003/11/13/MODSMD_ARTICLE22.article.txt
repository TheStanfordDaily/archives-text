# Hoops set for final exhibition game
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After Sunday's 69-52 victory over Love and Basketball,
the No. 6 Cardinal women's basketball team faces Every
one's Internet in its final exhibition game tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion. The exhibition is free for all Stanford facul
ty, staff and students.

Junior center Chelsea Trotter led Stanford in scoring on
Sunday with 15 points, making seven of eight field goals. Se
nior forward Nicole Powell also made a significant contribu
tion with limited playing time, posting her first double-dou
ble of the season with 11 points and 12 rebounds in 22 min
utes of play.
Months of preseason training are drawing to a close with
tonight's game against Texas-based Everyone's Internet

coached by Kevin Cook, an assistant coach with the Houston
Comets since 1997. EVI has a 2-2 record in 2003 with wins
over Louisiana-Lafayette and Southwest Texas State. It fell
to the No. 2 Duke Blue Devils 88-72 last Sunday.
"From what I have heard, this team is very good," Trot
ter said. "They have a couple of ex-pros on the team, so it
should be a better game than Sunday's."
The Cardinal women are ready to begin the season,
which opens Nov. 21 with a non-conference game against
Pepperdine.
"I think at this point everyone is ready to begin competi
tion," Trotter said. "We have been practicing for such a long
time realizing that everything we do in the offseason affects
how we perform in games."
These preseason games provide Stanford the opportuni
ty to work out any kinks before starting the regular season.
"I think the preseason games are an excellent gauge of
how far we have come since the beginning of practice and
yet, illuminate all the things we still need to work on," Trot
ter added.
Cardinal head coach Tara VanDerveer is taking the same
approach.
"Exhibition games are a time to really see where you're
at," VanDerveer said. "We're not really concentrating on
their team as much as we are just on our team."
However, it has been hard to judge the preseason play of
the team, since so many of the women have seen limited or
no practice time due to a host of injuries. Senior guard Katie
Denny, junior forwards T'Nae Thiel, Azella Perryman and
freshman forward Eziamaka Okafor were all forced to sit
out Sunday's game. These injured Cardinal will probably be
able to contribute this season, but they will likely watch from
the bench during tonight's exhibition game.
"Whenever you have injuries, it is disappointing and a
cause for concern," Trotter said. "T'Nae, Azella, Katie and
Ezi are all amazing players and make such positive contribu
tions when they are playing."
Trotter sounded hopeful that the injured players would
be back on the court in the near future and looked forward
to their return.
"Fortunately, they should all be back soon, which will
definitely give practice a boost and make things a lot more

competitive."
Even with a lengthy injured list, the Cardinal
has performed well on the court. Freshman
center Kristen Newlin turned in a strong show
ing at center on Sunday with nine points, seven
rebounds and two blocked shots in her colle
giate debut. Newlin's strong performance looks
to get her some quality minutes come regular
season action.
While the Cardinal put forth a strong effort as
a team last Sunday shooting 52.7 percent from
the field VanDerveer noted several aspects of
its game where she is seeking improvement.
"I hope that we take care of the ball better
we had too many turnovers [against Love and
Basketball]," she said. "I hope that we get on the
offensive boards better than we did.

In addition, the Cardinal team is excited to get
another chance to play in front of a Maple,s
crowd.
"I think the team views the exhibition games as
a time to have some fun," Trotter said. "After
playing in an empty gym for a month, anything in
volving popcorn and some boosters elicits a lot of
excitement. The neat thing about exhibition
games is that they are as close to a real game as
possible without the pressure associated with hav
ing to win games."
The Cardinal comes into the season picked as
the top women's basketball team for the 2003-04
Pacific 10 Conference race. The Cardinal re
ceived all 18 first-place votes in a poll of media
members and eight first-place votes from Pac-10
coaches. This is the fourth straight year Stanford
has been picked by the media as the preseason fa
vorite and the Pac-10 media poll has correctly
predicted the conference champion in five of the
last six seasons.

Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion and
the game can be heard on KZSU, 90.1 FM.
