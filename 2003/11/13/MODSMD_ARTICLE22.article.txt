# Hoops set for final exhibition game
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After Sunday's 69-52 victory over Love and Basketball,
the No. 6 Cardinal women's basketball team faces Every
one's Internet in its final exhibition game tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion. The exhibition is free for all Stanford facul
ty, staff and students.

Junior center Chelsea Trotter led Stanford in scoring on
Sunday with 15 points, making seven of eight field goals. Se
nior forward Nicole Powell also made a significant contribu
tion with limited playing time, posting her first double-dou
ble of the season with 11 points and 12 rebounds in 22 min
utes of play.
Months of preseason training are drawing to a close with
tonight's game against Texas-based Everyone's Internet

coached by Kevin Cook, an assistant coach with the Houston
Comets since 1997. EVI has a 2-2 record in 2003 with wins
over Louisiana-Lafayette and Southwest Texas State. It fell
to the No. 2 Duke Blue Devils 88-72 last Sunday.
"From what I have heard, this team is very good," Trot
ter said. "They have a couple of ex-pros on the team, so it
should be a better game than Sunday's."
The Cardinal women are ready to begin the season,
which opens Nov. 21 with a non-conference game against
Pepperdine.
"I think at this point everyone is ready to begin competi
tion," Trotter said. "We have been practicing for such a long
time realizing that everything we do in the offseason affects
how we perform in games."
These preseason games provide Stanford the opportuni
ty to work out any kinks before starting the regular season.
"I think the preseason games are an excellent gauge of
how far we have come since the beginning of practice and
yet, illuminate all the things we still need to work on," Trot
ter added.
Cardinal head coach Tara VanDerveer is taking the same
approach.
"Exhibition games are a time to really see where you're
at," VanDerveer said. "We're not really concentrating on
their team as much as we are just on our team."
However, it has been hard to judge the preseason play of
the team, since so many of the women have seen limited or
no practice time due to a host of injuries. Senior guard Katie
Denny, junior forwards T'Nae Thiel, Azella Perryman and
freshman forward Eziamaka Okafor were all forced to sit
out Sunday's game. These injured Cardinal will probably be
able to contribute this season, but they will likely watch from
the bench during tonight's exhibition game.
"Whenever you have injuries, it is disappointing and a
cause for concern," Trotter said. "T'Nae, Azella, Katie and
Ezi are all amazing players and make such positive contribu
tions when they are playing."
Trotter sounded hopeful that the injured players would
be back on the court in the near future and looked forward
to their return.
"Fortunately, they should all be back soon, which will
definitely give practice a boost and make things a lot more
