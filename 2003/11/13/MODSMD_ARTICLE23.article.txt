# FERNANDEZ MEETS GOALS
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Two years ago, then-rookie forward
Darren Fernandez was referred to as a
"freshman sensation," and was expected to
be an asset to the Cardinal soccer squad.
Fernandez, who is more often called
"Dazza" by his teammates and his fans,
didn't disappoint, as he finished second
in goals and points in his rookie cam
paign. The following year, Fernandez
continued to establish himself, leading
the College Cup team in goals with nine,
goal-winners with four and ranking third
in points overall.
The Benoni, South Africa native faced
even more pressure this year to improve
upon the accomplishments of his previous
two seasons, though the push didn't have a
huge effect on his mentality.
"Actually, that year that I had all of
those goals, I didn't have any assists. I got a
lot of crap for that," Fernandez admitted
with a laugh. "But I would rather have had
the team win than score. I just cared that we
scored goals, even if they weren't mine."
But when the junior headed in a game
winner in overtime against Old Dominion
earlier this season, it seemed as though he
would indeed play like the Darren Fernan
dez that dominated Stanford in scoring
stats in 2001 and 2002.
However, the outcome of only one
game is not always the best tool for predic
tion. Afterall, the now 3-14-2 Cardinal was
ranked sixth nationally in that first game.
After that season-opening nail biter,
Stanford began to struggle with scoring and
Fernandez seemed to falter accordingly.
Onlookers only saw glimpses of the im
pressive forward that Fernandez had
proven to be in earlier years. A couple of
times in every contest, a fast breakaway, a
quick steal or a skillfully placed shot would
incite hope that he would find his rhythm.
On Oct. 5, Fernandez fired in his second

goal of the season and then the team went
on a nine-game scoreless streak.

After the frustration that the Cardinal
experienced in the course of its scoring
drought and losing skid, it seemed only fit
ting that Fernandez would be the one to
turn things around.
All at once, Fernandez hit the field in
Washington, playing like the dangerous
striker that he had always been and
knocked in the goal that led a slew of
Cardinal players to rediscover the back
of the net.
Fernandez believed that the fact that he
has suddenly regained the on-the-field fi
nesse of last year could be attributed large
ly to his physical condition.
He said that he feels more fit now than
he did at the beginning of the season.
"I was out at the end of last season with
a bad ankle injury and I spent the winter
and spring rehabilitating and coming
back," Fernandez explained. "I didn't
think that it would bother me as much."
Apparently, the forward is in full repair,
as he showed in the Cardinal's 5-1 win over
San Jose State. Fernandez racked up the as
sists on three of Stanford's goals and put
one in himself.
He also said that the changed team
mindset has helped him play better.
"At the beginning of the year we were
trying to win and trying to get into the
tournament, but eventually we [realized
that we] just weren't going to have the
tournament," he said. "We had a lot of
frustration because we have a great team.
But now we have nothing to lose and
we're having a lot of fun and I think that
that makes us play better."
Fernandez has returned to the top of the
Cardinal scoring fists, leading the team in
game-winning goals, co-leading in assists
and ranking second in points and goals.
Off the field, Fernandez has proven cor
rect head coach Bret Simon's 2001 predic
tion: "This year's team at Stanford has

some strange [but wonderful] personali
ties. Top of the list, without a doubt, is ...
Darren Fernandez. I'm sure we will all see
and hear lots from Darren through the
years."
Fernandez laughed at the memory of
that comment, and said that the fact that he
was adapting to a new culture made him do
and say strange things.
"A lot of the things that all Americans
know about, I wouldn't understand, so it
just led to me saying a lot of stupid stuff,"
Fernandez said. "And I'm really not that
shy about doing weird stuff."
Fernandez has now been going to school
in the United States for five years he at
tended two years of high school in Con
necticut on a soccer scholarship and has
been grateful for the experience.
"A college education in South Africa
doesn't count for much outside of Africa,
but a Stanford education means something
everywhere. So academically it's been
great for me," Fernandez said. "[Also] it's
hard to go anywhere with soccer back
home, where here, if you want it and you're
good enough, you can play."
According to Fernandez, soccer has cre
ated a new family for him here in the Unit
ed States and possibly a future career path.
For now though, the junior will work
with the rest of his Cardinal family to fin
ish off the season on Saturday, in solid
form and to begin the rebuilding process
for next season.
The effort that goes into a developing
team has put a good deal of responsibility
on this year's junior class.
Fernandez said that he doesn't feel as
though his role in the leadership of the
team is a very conventional style, but he
hopes that he is helping the team to contin
ue to work together on the field.
"I don't get vocal on the field," he
said. "But I hope that I help make every
body feel comfortable and really enjoy
the game."

disappointing season. With only California left, the forward hopes to end the season on a high note.
