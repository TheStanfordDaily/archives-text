# Prestigious schools get more federal funds
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is one of a group of rich, private uni
versities that receive far more federal financial
support than less prestigious schools, according to
an article published this week in The New York
Times.
During the 2000-01 academic year, Stanford
received $211.80 for each student who applied for
financial aid in order to run its Perkins Loan pro
gram, compared to a nationwide median of
$14.38. Dartmouth and Brown received $174.88
and $169.23 per student, respectively, while some
200 colleges each received less than $3 per stu
dent.
There was a similar disparity in the money that
colleges and universities receive to place students
on financial aid in work-study jobs.
According to the article, those disparities leave
smaller schools struggling to meet the financial
needs of their poorer students.
But Earl Dowling, associate dean and director
of financial aid, justified the imbalances. Accord
ing to Dowling, all institutions eligible for federal
student aid submit an application for funds. The
application includes the number of the previous
year's financial aid applicants by income levels,
the school's Pell Grant expenditures and the total

expenditures in state grants and scholarships.
"With this information, the federal govern
ment, employing a Congressionally developed
formula, determines the amount of federal cam
pus-based monies each campus is to receive,"
Dowling said. "Wealth is not a factor in the for
mula."
These monies include Federal Perkins Loans,
Federal Work-Study and Federal Supplemental
Opportunity Grants.
Dowling also pointed out that long-time partic
ipants in the federal student aid program, includ
ing Stanford, can "recycle" loan payments from
alumni who are still repaying loans, using this
money to finance aid for current students. When
universities spend these loan repayments, their
need for federal aid decreases, increasing the
funds available for allocation to other schools.
According to The New York Times, some col
lege officials argue that "some protections need to
be built in so that low-income students continue to
attend elite universities." However, Dowling said
he does not think that a shift in federal funding
would deter students from applying to Stanford,
primarily because of the need-blind review
process for applications.
"It is important and, I believe significant, to re
member that Stanford admits students regardless
of their ability to pay," Dowling said. "Stanford's

contribution towards need-based scholarships
and grants is more significant than the gift assis
tance monies Stanford receives from the federal
government."
According to Dowling, Stanford spent $67 mil
lion on scholarships and grants last year, while the
federal government allocated $5.3 million to the
University.
According to the article, Congress tried to cor
rect the imbalance in federal aid in 1980 by creat
ing a new policy, but that policy's provisions guar
anteed that all participating universities would not
see a decrease in the aid than they were already re
ceiving from the federal government. As a result,
the redistribution did not significantly help uni
versities with larger percentages of financial aid
applicants.
Dowling said that a regular review of the fund
ing allocation formula is worthwhile and that
Stanford would openly discuss the topic.
"Stanford wants to be fair and would be will
ing, I would suggest, to engage in a dialogue about
the most equitable way to distribute federal stu
dent aid funds," Dowling said. "As a member of
the national higher education community, we
want students who can benefit from a post-sec
ondary education to have the opportunity to do so
if not at Stanford, then a institution where their
dreams, aspirations or goals can be realized."
