## Students pad resumes with fake activities 
### MICHAEL KAN MICHIGAN DAILY 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. Students
are always looking for ways to spruce up their re
sumes to impress potential employers and graduate
schools. But some University of Michigan students
are gaining an edge over other applicants by creating
fake student organizations for the sole purpose of
filling out their applications.
According to one student, many Business School
applicants have been creating University clubs meant
to improve the content on their resumes.
"I think that this is so unfair for those people who
[apply] fair pnd square," said the student, who asked
4 to remain anonymous.

One such club at the University was founded by
her friend, she said. "But this club doesn't do any
thing, it is just a waste of another club," she added.
The six members of the club registered themselves
under the different club positions, such as president
and vice president, which they would eventually
write on their Business School applications in order
to improve them.
"I asked seniors who are in the Business School
and they said that this has been going on since God
knows when," she said.
Michigan Student Assembly administrative assis
tant Amy McGovern said students possibly could reg

ister a club under MSA that holds no club activities
and is instead used to boost the members' resumes.
"A club doesn't have to have a function according
to the [MSA] guidebook," McGovern added.
"Groups must contain five [University] students,
and we check everyone through their University of
Michigan identification. It's the only way of verifica
tion we have. We don't monitor the groups."
Registering a student organization under MSA is
not necessary for a club to exist at the University. "It's
a voluntary process," McGovern said. Clubs who do
register with MSA gain privileges such as funding and
room usage, but there are also many clubs on campus
that have not registered.
Even though no stipulations explicitly state that
clubs must have an established purpose, McGov
ern said MSA could disband groups that do not
hold any meetings.
She explained if an organization's name does not
accurately describe the activities of the club, MSA can
cancel it. Because of this, an organization registered
under MSA that does not hold any activities at all
could be misleading of its club's name and then could
be revoked of its MSA privileges.
Furthermore, MSA Treasurer Elliot Wells-Reid
said if a club is misusing its MSA funds, the assembly
can not only revoke the club's status, but issue a fine.
"But a lot of this [club validity] relies on honesty,"
added McGovern..

University admissions officers also have to rely on
the honesty of its applicants when admitting students.
University spokeswoman Julie Peterson said no uni
versity could check every reference on all the applica
tions it receives.
"We have to rely on the honor system," she added.
This year, undergraduate admissions at the Uni
versity have attempted to prevent students from falsi
fying extra-curricular activities on their applications.
Peterson said the undergraduate application now
asks students to list the clubs they have joined in order
of their importance to them, making it more detailed
and harder to falsify.
James Hayes, associate director of admissions at
the undergraduate Business School, said the school
checks its applicants' transcripts and recommenda
tions on a random basis. But the Business School does
not verify information about club involvement.
"We just don't have enough time. There's not
enough man power," Hayes said.
The Career Center at the University also does
not verify the resumes of its registered students.
Lynne Sebille-White, assistant director of recruit
ment services at the Career Center, said the large
number of students registered there makes check
ing them all impossible.

Sebille-White said students should be aware that
employers thoroughly verify the information of its
employees.
