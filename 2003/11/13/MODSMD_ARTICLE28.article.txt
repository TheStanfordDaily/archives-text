# Law clinic files suit against Diebold
## 
### JESSICA BOROWICK 
The Stanford University Cy
berlaw Clinic filed a temporary
restraining order last Tuesday
against Diebold, Inc., in an effort
to bar the corporation from mak
ing legal threats against two
Swarthmore students who pub
lished internal Diebold memos
on their Web site.
In March, an unknown hacker
stole and publicized more than
13,000 pages of internal memos
from Diebold, a large producer
of self-service and card based
equipment, including electronic
voting machines. Although the
memos could have been altered,
they feature company executives
admitting to know about incom
plete certification of systems and
serious glitches in the voting soft
ware and dismissing problems
that could potentially compro
mise election security and the ac
curacy of voting counts. The stu
dents, Luke Smith and Nelson
Pavlosky, subsequently removed
the memos, but the case pits the
students' first amendment rights
against the corporation's claim
of copyright infringement.
The Cyberlaw Clinic, headed
by Law School Prof. Jennifer
Granick, is part of the Stanford
Law School Center for Internet
and Society and seeks to provide
students with supervised experi
ence in litigation and advocacy to
address public policy issues aris
ing from technological innova
tion. Students, who can earn
credit by working on clinic cases,
have participated in the repre
sentation of clients against com
panies including Google, Yahoo!
and American Airlines. The
Diebold case was chosen because
it involves copyright, technologi
cal and constitutional issues.

"[The Diebold case is] good
for study, a manageable amount
of work, and interrelates copy
right and free speech," Granick
said.
Like other law schools, Stan
ford has a number of issue-ori
ented clinics, such as the Racial
Justice Clinic and the Earthjus
tice Clinic, but Stanford's loca
tion and ties to Silicon Valley
strategically enable the Cyber
law Clinic to provide uniquely in
sightful representation for

clients.
The case will eventually de
cide if Diebold's copyright pro
tection precludes the students, or
anyone, from publishing internal
memos on the Web. Smith and
Pavlosky argue that they have
the right to share their deep con
cerns about the voting system
with the public via their Web site,
and that voters have a right to
know about the current weak
nesses of e-voting technology.
On the other hand, Diebold
points to the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act as legal justifica
tion for protection of the privacy
of their internal documents. Fur
thermore, Diebold argues that
the restraining order threatens
its own first amendment right to
file a lawsuit.
The questions highlighted by
this case are increasingly com
mon as policy-makers continue
navigating the uncharted possi
bilities and implications of inno
vation, in efforts to delineate the
bounds of constitutionally ac
ceptable technology use.
According to Granick, this
case is a determinant of "whether
and how the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act can be used to
squelch criticism by over-broad
claims of copyright rights." She is
optimistic about the case, argu
ing that the students' postings
were "clearly fair use of e-mail
archives" and that the law is "100
percent" on the student's side.
"In the clinic, there is a strong
focus on intellectual property and
free speech issues, but many of the
cases we work on involve tech
companies, so one can really
never separate the two fields of
law," said second-year law student
Nina Holly, who is working on the
Diebold case at the clinic. "There
are corporate policy and gover
nance issues lurking in the back
ground of so many of our cases."
Originally from Czechoslova
kia, Holly expressed a great per
sonal investment and interest in
the case.
"I feel very privileged to help
uphold people's right to investi
gate the mechanism of elec
tions," she said. "This trans
parency is really what makes
America unique, and it's won
derful to see people fighting for
their right to know."
