# Medical apps down despite national trend

### REBECCA LIAO 
While medical school applications nationwide
increased this year, the number of applicants to
Stanford's School of Medicine actually decreased.
The Association of Medical Colleges reported
last week that the number of applicants to Amer
ican medical schools climbed 3.4 percent last year,
to 35,000 from the previous year's 33,625.
From 1996 to 2001, the number of applications
to medical school dropped 28 percent, declining
steadily from a high of 47,000 in 1996. This is the
first year since 1996 in which applications have in
creased from the preceding year.
"It's reassuring that medicine remains an at
tractive career option for young people," said
AAMC President Jordan J. Cohen, in an inter
view with the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The Stanford School of Medicine, however,
did not follow this trend of increased applicants.
The number of applicants in 2002 fell by 3.5
percent, according to Associate Dean of Medical
School Admissions Gabriel Garcia.
Philip Pizzo, dean of Stanford's School of Med
icine, attributed Stanford's decrease in apphcants
to the recent change in the medical school's cur
riculum.
"We did introduce a new curriculum this fall
that emphasizes special opportunities for our stu
dents to pursue Scholarly Concentrations [the
equivalent of majors for undergraduates]," he
said. "We expect that our curriculum will appeal
to many but not all students."
Pizzo pointed out that, for many years, the
number of women at the medical school has ex
ceeded the number of men, and that the number
of underrepresented minorities at Stanford's
medical school is among the highest in the coun
try.
The number of spots offered by Stanford for its
first-year class in the School of Medicine has re
mained unchanged at 86, meaning that the rate of
admission to the University's medical school has
increased this year.
