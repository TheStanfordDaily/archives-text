# Medical apps down despite national trend
## 
### REBECCA LIAO 
While medical school applications nationwide
increased this year, the number of applicants to
Stanford's School of Medicine actually decreased.
The Association of Medical Colleges reported
last week that the number of applicants to Amer
ican medical schools climbed 3.4 percent last year,
to 35,000 from the previous year's 33,625.
From 1996 to 2001, the number of applications
to medical school dropped 28 percent, declining
steadily from a high of 47,000 in 1996. This is the
first year since 1996 in which applications have in
creased from the preceding year.
"It's reassuring that medicine remains an at
tractive career option for young people," said
AAMC President Jordan J. Cohen, in an inter
view with the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The Stanford School of Medicine, however,
did not follow this trend of increased applicants.
The number of applicants in 2002 fell by 3.5
percent, according to Associate Dean of Medical
School Admissions Gabriel Garcia.
Philip Pizzo, dean of Stanford's School of Med
icine, attributed Stanford's decrease in apphcants
to the recent change in the medical school's cur
riculum.
"We did introduce a new curriculum this fall
that emphasizes special opportunities for our stu
dents to pursue Scholarly Concentrations [the
equivalent of majors for undergraduates]," he
said. "We expect that our curriculum will appeal
to many but not all students."
Pizzo pointed out that, for many years, the
number of women at the medical school has ex
ceeded the number of men, and that the number
of underrepresented minorities at Stanford's
medical school is among the highest in the coun
try.
The number of spots offered by Stanford for its
first-year class in the School of Medicine has re
mained unchanged at 86, meaning that the rate of
admission to the University's medical school has
increased this year.
Junior Jonathan Chen, who is looking into ap-
plying to medical school, said that
the increase in applications is only
of concern if admissions rates de
crease.
"As long as the medical schools
don't start accepting fewer people,
I'm not worried," he said.
The primary reason for the na
tional increase in medical school ap
plications is being attributed to the 7
percent jump from 2002 in the num
ber of women applicants. For the
first time in history, women made
up the majority of medical school
applicants nationwide.
Additionally, the number of
black applicants rose nearly 5 per
cent, while the number of Hispanic
applicants increased by less than 2
percent.
In response to the recent U.S.

Supreme Court decision that de
fended affirmative action practices
at the University of Michigan Law
School, statistics on minorities un
derrepresented in medicine will
probably be watched very closely in
the next few years.
However, the number of black
and Hispanic students who enrolled
in medical schools actually de
creased.
"These latest figures contain
both good and bad news for the
medical profession," Cohen told the
Chronicle. "The decrease in minori
ties entering medical school under
scores the need for redoubled ef
forts to attract a critical mass of stu
dents from diverse backgrounds in
order to enhance the education of
all future physicians."
It is still unclear as to what
caused the nationwide increase in
medical school applications, and
why women constituted the majori
ty of applicants this year.
