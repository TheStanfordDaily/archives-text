# Alcohol scrutiny increases on campus
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Though the official change in
the enforcement of the Stanford al
cohol policy this year is focused on
freshman dorms, upperclassmen
have also had to deal with stricter
drinking regulations. Upperclass
dorms and houses have seen
changes from prior years in alco
hol-related activities.
Toyon Hall, an all-sophomore
residence, hosts gatherings like a
weekly TGIF and a quarterly spe
cial dinner through its eating clubs.
Eating club membership is not lim
ited to Toyon residents, and the
eating clubs serve a number of eat
ing associates across campus. This
year, there is a conspicuous ab
sence of alcohol at eating club
events.
Toyon staff members say they
will continue to serve alcohol, see
ing as there are more than 150 eat
ing associates that are over 21. A
representative from Toyon added
that they would be stricter about
carding.
Giancarlo Aquilanti, the resi
dent fellow of Toyon and a member
of the Eating Club Board, main
tains that the reason for a reduction
in the amount of alcohol served is
not due to a policy change.
"As an employee of Stanford,
my job is to make sure that the eat
ing clubs comply with both the Uni
versity and state policy," Aquilanti
said.
Though there has been no offi
cial policy change concerning
Toyon, some residents feel a no
ticeable difference from alcohol
related events in the pasts.
"I knew upon moving into
Toyon that the eating clubs used
money from our board bill to fi
nance social activities that involved
alcohol," said sophomore Tom
Feulner, a Toyon resident. "It
seems like we're paying a lot of
money and we're not even getting

what we expected."
Alcohol scrutiny has not fallen
only on dorms. 717 Dolores has
been asked to stop referring to its
Friday night gatherings as "TGIF"
due to the University's concern
that the name has alcohol-related
connotations.
"The Party Planning Guide
states that an event should not have
alcohol as its primary focus, so my
goal in working with party planners
is to come up with fun and exciting
themes that will have a broad ap
peal to students," said Joey Green
well, assistant director of student
activities.
While the Office of Student Ac

tivities maintains that there will not
be a change in the availability of al
cohol in houses on the Row, 717
residents question the need for any
change regarding alcohol-related
events.
"I think that the OSA has mis
understood what TGIF is all about,
and it is not addressing real issues
surrounding underage drinking by
making Dolores House and other
organizations rename their social
events," said Sika Stanton, social
manager at 717. "We may serve al
cohol, but it is hardly the focus of
our small weekly gathering. TGIF
is mainly an opportunity to get to
know other members of the house

and to socialize with friends in a
fun, informal and relaxed atmos
phere."
The University's policies have
not been altered to reduce drinking
in upperclassmen dorms and hous
es. Still, some houses and dorms
feel it is more difficult to maintain
similar social drinking environ
ments to years past.
"Even though we'd prefer to not
change a thing, we are considering
changing the name to TBIF in
order to cooperate with the Univer
sity's request while still maintain
ing the spirit of the event," Stanton
said. "TBIF stands for Thank
Babar It's Friday."
