## CNN regrets planting question 
### SARAH LABRIE BROWN DAILY HERALD 
(U-WIRE) PROVIDENCE, R.I. —Brown student
Alexandra Trustman said it wasn't her idea to ask what one
media critic called "the most ridiculed question at CNN's
Rock the Vote." Her defense, published as an opinions col
umn in The Herald Monday, instantly sparked nationwide
scrutiny of the debate and a response from CNN on Tuesday.
Trustman asked eight Democratic presidential candi
dates whether they preferred Macs or PCs at the Nov. 4 de
bate held in Boston. In her Herald guest column, she said
CNN fed her the question that made her an object of mock
ery on campus and across the country. National news orga
nizations including the Washington Post and The New York
Times picked up the story early Tuesday morning, and
CNN quickly issued a statement regretting the incident.
"In an attempt to encourage a Hghthearted moment in
the debate, a CNN producer working with Ms. Trustman
clearly went too far. CNN regrets the producer's actions," a
CNN spokesman told The Herald.
A spokeswoman for CNN told the Los Angeles Times
that the incident was isolated and that no other questions

had been planted.
Trustman's assertion that CNN planted the debate ques
tion has led some to doubt the news network's integrity in
how it handled the debate. Although members of the de
bate's audience who were slated to ask questions were noti
fied in advance of the topic they were to address and the
order in which they were to speak, it was extremely unusu
al for the network to actually plant a question, Washington
Post columnist Howard Kurtz said.
"CNN is clearly embarrassed by this revelation," Kurtz
said.
In her column, Trustman wrote that the question she
asked at the forum was fed to her by a CNN producer the
morning of the event. She added that she was confused by
the insignificance of the topic, and that she constructed a
new, more relevant question about technology. During the
forum, Trustman was told that she could not ask her new
question because "it was not light-hearted enough."
Kurtz told The Herald that he came across Trustman's
column after it was linked to Jim Romenesko's media news
blog, one of the most popular sources for industry news on
the Web.
Trustman declined to comment.
