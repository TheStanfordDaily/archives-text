## Beep: Vinni comes up on Gaydar 
### 
Women have great ones,
straight men don't seem
to have one at all and
mine is sporadically out
of order... yes, I'm speaking of Gay
dar, a sixth sense allowing one to iden
tify gay people without prior knowl
edge of them being gay.
Like a geiger counter clicks louder
and louder as one gets closer to a ra
dioactive source, the inborn meter
that is gaydar (the gay Geiger) clicks
louder and louder as one gets closer to
the gay vibes (gaydio-activity, if you
will) given off by a gay person. Most
people describe the sense they get

from these vibes as
an emotion or an in
tuition, saying "I just
have a feeling he is"
or "I don't know
why, but that girl just
has to be." These
emotions and intu
itions come from
human beings' ob
session with classifi
cations and stereo
types.

It must suck to be a heterosexual
guy in this day and age: If you dress
poorly, are insensitive to other peo
ple's feelings or are aggressive, people
think you're straight, but they also
think you're an ape that never quite got
the hang of evolution. If you dress well,
are sensitive to other people's feelings
or are a pacifist, people think you're
stylish and nice but they also think
you're gay. You guys just can't win.
On the flip side, it sucks to be gay in
the same respect. Unless you wear
Diesel Jeans, talk with a lisp or know
how to dance, everyone assumes
you're straight. You have to work to
be perceived as gay just like more and
more straight guys today have to work
to maintain a straight image.
I'm afraid we've lost human sexu
ality in a sea of stereotypes. Know one
thinks of being gay as simply liking
members of the same sex; they think
of it as being fashionable, being bitchy
and knowing every piece of gossip on
campus. No one thinks of being
straight as simply liking members of
the opposite sex; they think of it as
being fashionably indifferent, being
aggressive, and knowing every base
ball statistic since 1975.
The problem lies in the assump
tions. We assume that someone is
straight or gay based on how well they
fit our stereotypes of different forms
of sexuality. We can't help but assume
because we can't help but judge.
When I see a well groomed man walk
ing down the street wearing Gucci
sunglasses and tight black clothes I
can't help but think he's gay because
almost every other person I've ever
met who dresses like this has been a
huge flamer (or European).
So stereotypes are sometimes cor
rect, and some stereotypes are more
often correct than others. Should we
then all use them as much as we can,
be proud of them and perpetuate
them?
No way. Don't even suggest it. Get
out of here! Stereotypes exist because
humans are too stupid to take into
consideration every detail when mak
ing an impression and when using that
impression to make a judgment.
Stereotypes are partial truths oth
erwise known as lies based not on
fact but on the incomplete, partial
data our brains collect as we go
through a world that does not include
everyone, but only the people we hap
pen to meet.
Wouldn't we all just be happier if
we dropped these unnecessary stereo
types? Sure, you might want to keep
stereotypes like "huge men with guns
often shoot people," but how do
stereotypes about gay people and
straight people help anyone? Yes, it
may serve to allow these groups to
identify fellow members more easily,
but it results in forcing those who act
differently to change who they are in
order to fit into the status quo, leaving
out those who refuse to change or
don't know how to —out of the group.
Let's just all assume the other per
son's attracted to both sexes or, better
yet, let's stop assuming all together.
When you first meet a person recog
nize the fact that even though you may
think you have Military grade gaydar,
you simply can't know until you try to
kiss the person (or, you know, ask).
