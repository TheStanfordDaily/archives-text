# What's Cookin'?
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
The morning I saw 200 Argentine ants crawling up a refried beans
smeared plate that one of my "housemates" had left in the kitchen
sink, I vowed to write a dramatic article about how Stanford students
are disgusting pigs.
Really and truly I had this sensationalistic piece all planned out.
I would visit open kitchens on campus and interview people for tales
of rodents, bugs and lethal cases of food poisoning.
But I went up and down the Row and couldn't weasel a single hor
ror story out of anyone. What I found instead were students and chefs
who are content with the way the open kitchens look; cleanliness, they
claim, is rarely a severe problem.
Matthew Neeley, a senior in Haus Mitt, thought everything was
just fine.
"This is the first time I've lived in a place with an open kitchen and
it's been a great experience," he said. "People have done a really good
job. People are careful to keep the lids on the containers; they're care
ful to make sure the living space is kept clean."
"When your house is clean, everyone is just that much happier,"
Neeley continued. "The only thing that's annoying is that they run out
of chocolate-covered raisins."
Chloe Rothstein, a junior who lives in La Maison Francaise, said
that she has lived in Row houses for two years and never had a prob
lem.
"The open kitchen is pretty clean," Rothstein said. "There's no
hashing on Saturday and sometimes it gets slightly messy, but it's not
a big deal."
Aaron Baca, a sophomore who also lives in la Maison Francaise,
agrees with Rothstein that "hashers do their job."
"Maybe living in a smaller house makes a difference, but this place
is fantastic. I have no complaints," Baca said. "I think that [keeping
the kitchen clean] has a lot do with respecting your chef and respect
ing the place he works in."
But do Stanford students respect their chefs? The people I talked
to hadn't entirely convinced me. Glowing reports from hashers don't
say much about how the chefs actually feel.
Michael Ryan, a chef in his second year at Narnia, has never had a
major problem.
"If the kitchen is too dirty, there's a procedure that says I can walk
out," Ryan said. "I would call the kitchen manager if I found the
kitchen unsafe or unsanitary. This has never happened to me. I know
a couple of chefs who have walked out, however."
"Sometimes [the way hashers leave the open kitchen] rises to the
level of annoying," Ryan continued. "But it's never been a health or
safety issue. The worst thing that happens is when hashers spill things
and don't clean them up. Once I came in the kitchen and found frozen
vegetables all over the place. It was a real mess."
Geoffrey Thomson, the chef at Kappa Alpha, has also had to put
up with messes though he claims the dorm is "pretty clean for a
bunch of frat boys."
"The kitchen has improved as the year has progressed," Thomson
said.
"Earlier in the year there were a couple of really messy days," he
said. "Things are better now. There's a lot of excitement at first, es
pecially when there's unlimited ice cream. Sometimes they forget to
clean up after the mess they make. But they're really a pretty togeth
er group, and for the most part, they respect the space."
Thomson explained how he cuts to the chase when it comes to mak
ing known his expectations for the way the kitchen should be kept.
"I let them know what I think is unacceptable," he said. "I try be
adult about any matters that arise. I address the matters directly;
yelling doesn't do any good. Getting mad is not effective."
Thomson sometimes uses drastic ways of getting across his point.
He writes down complaints on a white board outside, using, ahem,
language not fit to print in The Daily. One morning after finding a big
mess, he started peeling out bills from his wallet and tossing them in
the garbage.
"I tell them, 'it's your money.' We might as well just throw the
money in the trash. Let's not waste the food. It's ludicrous, asinine
and unreasonable."
Thomson is adamant that it's important to establish a strong rela
tionship with the house members and kitchen manager.
"Building a wall is not good," Thomson continued. "It's important
to form a good cohesive group. It improves the quality of life and
makes this place feel more like home.
"But I do give them some leeway. I understand that they have a lot
to take on."
"They're not perfect tind I'm not expecting that," Thomson added.
"There are going to be slips here and there. I try to do the best job for
them that I can. And I really believe that goodness begets goodness."
