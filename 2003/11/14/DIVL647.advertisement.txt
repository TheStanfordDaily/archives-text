The Stanford
Daily
IS SEEKING STUDENTS
INTERESTED IN
LAYOUT
We're looking for
people to lay out the
paper one night per
week. Students with
layout experience or
familiarity with Quark
are encouraged to apply,
but all are welcome to
try it out. It's a paying
gig, too.
E-mail eic@daily or
call 5-2100 x5Ol.
