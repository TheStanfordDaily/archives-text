# Card seeks to extend winning streak
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Numbers don't always tell the whole story,
and that's a good thing for the Cardinal foot
ball team as it travels to Corvallis, Ore. this
weekend. Oregon State (6-3, 3-2) is superior
to Stanford (4-4, 2-4) in almost every major
statistical category, boasting the Pacific 10
Conference's leaders in passing yards, lush
ing yards and receiving yards.
The Cardinal players may have dreams of
winning the rest of their games and playing in
the Las Vegas Bowl, but Sin City odds favor
the Beavers by more than two touchdowns in
Saturday's game. Motivated by bowl aspira
tions of its own, Oregon State isn't taking the
Cardinal lightly.
"Stanford is winning and they're coming in
pretty confident, so it should make for a great
game," said OSU running back Steven Jack
son.
It should, if the Cardinal continues to play
like the solid, balanced squad that beat
UCLA and Arizona State and not like the
team that lost to Oregon 35-0 in its most re
cent trip north.
"After the [2-4] start, we looked at the
schedule and always felt we had a great op
portunity to run the table," junior cornerback
Leigh Torrence said. "We have been able to
do that the last two weeks."
Perhaps the team's newfound confidence
can compensate for its comparative short
comings in productivity so far this season.
Whereas Arizona State (weak defense) and
UCLA (weak offense) had obvious weak
nesses, it is harder to see where Stanford
matches up well with the Beavers.
The Cardinal scores fewer points and gives
up more points, gains fewer yards and allows

more yards both running and passing. Oregon
State quarterback Derek Anderson, running
back Jackson and wide receiver James New
son rank first in the conference in productivi
ty at their respective positions, while no Stan
ford player is in the top eight in any of those
categories.
So why isn't Stanford scared? One big rea
son is that the team has momentum on its
side.
"We're jelling, and getting better," Tor
rence said of the Cardinal's defensive sec
ondary. "We're more consistent and improv
ing with experience."
Junior running back J.R. Lemon made
similar comments about the offensive line's
recent success.
"It's a matter of clicking during game
time," he said. "They're focusing a lot bet
ter."
In other words, the Stanford team that
faces Oregon State on Saturday isn't neces
sarily the same team that struggled to move
the ball against Brigham Young and Wash
ington State and failed to slow down South
ern California's offense.
But there are other reasons that this
weekend's match-up may not be as lopsided
as it appears on paper. Oregon State's stars
racked up many of their yards in non-confer
ence play, against talent-deficient oppo
nents like Boise State and Sacramento State.
The Beavers have won just one game in the
past four weeks, against lowly Arizona last
week.
Most encouraging for Stanford, Oregon
State has often undermined its own efforts
with costly mistakes. Yardage totals don't
count when the team fails to score because of
turnovers, a category in which it ranks near
the bottom of the conference with 25. And

the Beavers have seen many tough defensive
stands undercut by the 107 penalties they
have incurred.
"There's a lot of flags out when those guys
play," Teevens said. "You hope that you can
take advantage of penalty situations that give
you first downs and field position."
One matchup Stanford won't be able to ex
ploit on Saturday is 6-foot-7 freshman wide
receiver Evan Moore against the Beaver de
fensive backs. Moore is out with a dislocated
shoulder and sprained ankle, and he may not
return to action this season.
The good news for the Stanford passing
game is Oregon State's weak pass rush, which
is tied with the Cardinal for last place in the
league in quarterback sacks. That should give
senior quarterback Chris Lewis even more
reason to be relaxed as he looks for receivers
downfield.
"He's so nonchalant," Lemon said of
Lewis. "He has a smooth, calm demeanor."
Lemon looked comfortable himself as he
churned out a career-high 151 yards and two
touchdowns last Saturday. Though his perfor
mance on Saturday was the best by a Stanford
running back since 1997, Lemon will share
time this week with junior Kenneth Tolon,
who returns to the lineup after injuring his
thumb in last week's pre-game warm-ups.
"Whenever I get in I want to make the
most of my opportunities," Lemon said.
He'll have to, if he hopes to win the duel
with Oregon State's Jackson, who has piled
up more than 100 yards from scrimmage in
every game this year. On paper, Jackson is
more accomplished than Lemon and Tolon
combined. And on paper, Oregon State's run
defense is even stiffer than Stanford's.
But, as everyone knows, football games
aren't played on paper.

the Las Vegas Bowl, but Sin City odds favor
the Beavers by more than two touchdowns in
Saturday's game. Motivated by bowl aspira
tions of its own, Oregon State isn't taking the
Cardinal lightly.
"Stanford is winning and they're coming in
pretty confident, so it should make for a great
game," said OSU running back Steven Jack
son.
It should, if the Cardinal continues to play
like the solid, balanced squad that beat
UCLA and Arizona State and not like the
team that lost to Oregon 35-0 in its most re
cent trip north.
"After the [2-4] start, we looked at the
schedule and always felt we had a great op
portunity to run the table," junior cornerback
Leigh Torrence said. "We have been able to
do that the last two weeks."
Perhaps the team's newfound confidence
can compensate for its comparative short
comings in productivity so far this season.
Whereas Arizona State (weak defense) and
UCLA (weak offense) had obvious weak
nesses, it is harder to see where Stanford
matches up well with the Beavers.
The Cardinal scores fewer points and gives
up more points, gains fewer yards and allows

more yards both running and passing. Oregon
State quarterback Derek Anderson, running
back Jackson and wide receiver James New
son rank first in the conference in productivi
ty at their respective positions, while no Stan
ford player is in the top eight in any of those
categories.
So why isn't Stanford scared? One big rea
son is that the team has momentum on its
side.
"We're jelling, and getting better," Tor
rence said of the Cardinal's defensive sec
ondary. "We're more consistent and improv
ing with experience."
Junior running back J.R. Lemon made
similar comments about the offensive line's
recent success.
"It's a matter of clicking during game
time," he said. "They're focusing a lot bet
ter."
In other words, the Stanford team that
faces Oregon State on Saturday isn't neces
sarily the same team that struggled to move
the ball against Brigham Young and Wash
ington State and failed to slow down South
ern California's offense.
But there are other reasons that this
weekend's match-up may not be as lopsided
as it appears on paper. Oregon State's stars
racked up many of their yards in non-confer
ence play, against talent-deficient oppo
nents like Boise State and Sacramento State.
The Beavers have won just one game in the
past four weeks, against lowly Arizona last
week.
Most encouraging for Stanford, Oregon
State has often undermined its own efforts
with costly mistakes. Yardage totals don't
count when the team fails to score because of
turnovers, a category in which it ranks near
the bottom of the conference with 25. And

the Beavers have seen many tough defensive
stands undercut by the 107 penalties they
have incurred.
"There's a lot of flags out when those guys
play," Teevens said. "You hope that you can
take advantage of penalty situations that give
you first downs and field position."
One matchup Stanford won't be able to ex
ploit on Saturday is 6-foot-7 freshman wide
receiver Evan Moore against the Beaver de
fensive backs. Moore is out with a dislocated
shoulder and sprained ankle, and he may not
return to action this season.
The good news for the Stanford passing
game is Oregon State's weak pass rush, which
is tied with the Cardinal for last place in the
league in quarterback sacks. That should give
senior quarterback Chris Lewis even more
reason to be relaxed as he looks for receivers
downfield.
"He's so nonchalant," Lemon said of
Lewis. "He has a smooth, calm demeanor."
Lemon looked comfortable himself as he
churned out a career-high 151 yards and two
touchdowns last Saturday. Though his perfor
mance on Saturday was the best by a Stanford
running back since 1997, Lemon will share
time this week with junior Kenneth Tolon,
who returns to the lineup after injuring his
thumb in last week's pre-game warm-ups.
"Whenever I get in I want to make the
most of my opportunities," Lemon said.
He'll have to, if he hopes to win the duel
with Oregon State's Jackson, who has piled
up more than 100 yards from scrimmage in
every game this year. On paper, Jackson is
more accomplished than Lemon and Tolon
combined. And on paper, Oregon State's run
defense is even stiffer than Stanford's.
But, as everyone knows, football games
aren't played on paper.
