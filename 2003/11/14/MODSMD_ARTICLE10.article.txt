# Resource Awareness Days encourage eco-friendly ways
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER 
Resource Awareness Days, a three-day event which ends
today, was organized to encourage resource conservation.
While Stanford is already a recycling-aware campus, event or
ganizers say they hope the days will encourage less waste of
reusable material.
Each of the days had a theme: food cycle, energy and solid
waste awareness, the last of which will be today's focus from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in White Plaza.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford and the PSSI / Student
Recycling Center started Resource Awareness Days this year,
in recognition of National Day of Action for Energy Justice
(yesterday) and America Recycles Day (tomorrow).
The goal of Resource Awareness Days is to "provide stu
dents with information on the resource cycles their functional
lives depend upon, as well as a stimulus for engaging in more
sustainable habits," said Lauren Dietrich, a representative of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford.
Each Resource Awareness Day features a free item ex
change, an opportunity for students to donate or take items,
as well as a sculpture that graphs energy in raw materials ver
sus recycled materials and an interactive Eco-Footprint quiz
with information about the total amount of waste created by
people in the Stanford community. In addition, speakers
from a multitude of Stanford-affiliated groups gave presen
tations each day.
On Wednesday, Stanford Dining spoke on organics pur
chasing, Stanford Community Farm spoke on growth cycles
and compost and the Stanford Project on Hunger spoke on

redistribution of dining hall waste. On Thursday, there were
several presentations about solar power and energy conser
vation.
Thursday's event was part of the Youth Power Shift cam
paign, which involved 54 universities across the country.
"To show support for the awareness-raising events, EAD
Environmental, a networking non-profit out of NYC, is do
nating 10,000 kilowatt-hours of wind energy to each campus
that hosts an event," Dietrich said.
Today's presentation will consist of instructions on the
purchasing of recycled paper and presentations on minimiz
ing solid waste.
Organizers said Stanford is already a very environmental
ly friendly campus but expressed their hopes that Resource
Awareness Days will significantly reduce waste of resources.
"The University as a whole is great at recycling we cur
rently divert 53 percent of our waste from the landfill, and
after the food compost program is expanded to include all of
the dining halls, this percentage will rise significantly," said
Jennifer Chiu, a PSSI / Student Recycling Center intern. "I
think most students recycle to some extent, although there's a
lot of room for improvement."
Last year, Stanford recycling saved a total of about 91,626
BTUs of energy, Chiu said enough energy to power nearly
948 homes, more than the number of homes on campus, for
one year.
Dietrich said representatives from Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford are passing out petitions during the
event in an effort to collect signatures in support of long
range planning and consideration of sustainable infra
structure development.

that is in White Plaza for Resource Awareness Days. The event features speakers and other
activities to encourage resource management.
