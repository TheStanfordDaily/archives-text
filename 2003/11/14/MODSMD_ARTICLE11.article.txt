# Students hold Ramadan fast for charity
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
With the number of hungry families in the United States
continually increasing, the Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity is hosting the Ramadan Fast-A-Thon to acknowl
edge those in the community who go hungry and also to
bring awareness of the celebration of Ramadan on Sunday.
The society, in conjunction with the ASSU, the Stan
ford Egyptian Association and the Organization of Arab
Students, is asking students and staff on Sunday to fast
and share a complimentary meal at the end of the day.
For each student who registers for the event, local busi
nesses will donate $2 to the Rahima Foundation, a local
charity organization distributing food in the San Jose
area to those in need.

"One of the main benefits of fasting is to call attention to
those who go hungry every day, not as an exercise of reli
gious expression, but as a fact of life," said Ragip Pala, who
is a second-year doctoral student in applied physics and an
organizer of the event. "We wanted to use this opportunity
to put something together to help those who are hungry in
the Bay Area, and we felt that a lot of other people on cam
pus would love to join us in doing so."
According to data from the Census Bureau, the number
of hungry families in the United States increased last year by
8.6 percent from 2001 and 13 percent from 2000. The society
is hoping to alleviate local hunger by having around 200 to
250 people participate, raising $4OO to $5OO. So far, more
than 100 people have signed up.
"Fasting is related to humanity's collective life, for God's
decision not to give each person livelihood means that the

rich are to help the poor," Pala said. "Without fasting, many
well-off people cannot perceive the pain of hunger and
poverty or to what extent the poor need care. Care for one's
fellow beings is a foundation of true Thanksgiving."
The event also aims to teach the Stanford community
more about Ramadan and Islamic practices.
"We want to bring to campus the celebration held world
wide during Ramadan," said Imran Moinuddin, a senior
who is a member of the Islamic Society and is helping with
the event. "It's a large and significant event throughout the
world, and we thought it was something we should share
with our community."
During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast by abstain
ing from all food, drink and sexual relations from dawn to
sunset.
"Fasting in Ramadan is one of the Islam's foremost pil

lars and greatest symbols," Pala said. "Many of its purposes
relate to submitting to God's Lordship and giving thanks for
His bounties, as well as to humanity's individual and collec
tive life."
Moinuddin explained that fasting is "a means of self-disci
pline learning to deal with difficult circumstances."
The Fast-A-Thon will come to a close at 5 p.m. on Sun
day, minutes after sunset, when participants will break their
fast with the traditional serving of dates and water, followed
by a Middle Eastern dinner.
"We want to build a community on campus," Moinuddin
said. "Having events helps us build a community and lets
other people learn about Islam and share in the celebration
and festivities."
People can register for the Fast-A-Thon on the Islamic
Society's Web site.
