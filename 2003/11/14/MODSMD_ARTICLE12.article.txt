## School libraries to distribute music online 
### JOSH BRODIE THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. The Prince
ton University Library is considering making
music available through its Web site in an effort to
legally distribute recordings to community mem
bers.
In what would be an extension of the e-reserve
system, the University Library may subscribe to a
service that would provide streaming audio to
users, said Assistant Music Librarian Daniel
Boomhower. Streaming is a process that sends
music to a user across a network without giving
the user a permanent copy.
"There is definite interest on the part of the
music library and the University Library to sub
scribe to online audio services," Boomhower said.
Though there are currently no services available
that meet the university's needs, some are in pro
duction, he said.
HNH International Limited, Classical Interna
tional, Inc. and Smithsonian Global Sound are the
three online music subscription services under
consideration, he said.
Princeton is not the only institution aiming to
solve the problem of legal music distribution. Stu
dents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolo

gy and Penn State University's administration
have also both moved toward solutions of their
own.
At MIT, two students created the Library Ac
cess to Music Project. The service was supposed to
work by allowing students to act as DJs for a cam
pus-wide music service which would be broadcast
across existing cable TV lines.
However, after only a week of activity, the ser
vice was shut down when the Universal Music
Group claimed LAMP operators had not ob
tained the necessary licenses to distribute music
on the campus.
Penn State recently reached a deal with Nap
ster which would give students free access to a new
version of the once-popular program which now
charges a fee for downloads. Students would be
able to freely download any song from the Nap
ster library and burn CD's for 99 cents each. This
spring, 18,000 students will have access to the ser
vice on their campus.
Some students feel that spending educational
funds to finance recreational music is not the uni
versity's job.
"Pop music isn't necessarily part of a college
experience," said Nathan Domingue, who has
composed several original rap songs with Brian
Root-Bernstein. Domingue said he wouldn't ex

pect the University to provide music any more
than he would "expect the school to buy me a TV
or refrigerator."
While these systems are running their courses
at other institutions, the newest version of Apple's
iTunes is already having an effect on Princeton's
campus.
In addition to letting students pay for music as
they download it, the new version also enables
both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows users to
share songs across the University network. The
program lets users listen to files off each other's
computers without copying the files.
This sharing feature has Domingue and Root-
Bernstein excited. The duo has recorded three
original rap songs and is encouraging the commu
nity to listen to them through iTunes.
"I think sharing is really good for someone like
me who is trying to get heard and not necessarily
make money," Domingue said.
But this easy distribution is a double-edged
sword:
"I think programs like iTunes and even Kazaa
are wonderful for up-and-coming musicians who
have no chance of being signed to a major record
label," said Root-Bernstein. "But for those artists
that depend on record sales for a living, they are
certainly the opposite."
