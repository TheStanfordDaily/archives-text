(U-WIRE) MEDFORD, Mass. —Three stu
dents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy are trying to improve the social scene for col
lege students in Boston with a Web site that helps
students from different schools connect.
Wicked Party.com is an online guide to
nightlife to nightlife for college students and was
founded by MIT sophomores Arun Agarwal,
Steve Fredette, and Paul Wehner.
"All you hear about when you decide to go to
school in Boston is how great the social scene is
and what an amazing 'college town' it is," Agarw
al said. "But there just isn't a lot of mingling be
tween the schools because there has never been an
infrastructure for it. We decided to create a site
that would tie the city together socially."
The students began building the Web site in
January and launched it six weeks ago. The three
are now co-presidents of Awf Beat Inc. pro
nounced off-beat. The acronym was derived from
the first letters of their last names.
The Web site generates an income from club
promotion, although the creators hope to grow
revenue through advertising on the site.
Since the Web site's launch, the company has

launched a public relations campaign to spread
word of the website, and employs 42 promoters at
15 schools.
Mike Decker, a freshman at Boston Universi
ty, promotes Wicked Party.com at his school.
"It's just a matter of getting the [Web site's]
name out there, then people will start coming to
the parties," he said.
The Web site features college party listings,
club events and shows in Boston, as well as cheap
restaurant listings, movie schedules, and columns
written by students.
The Web site also allows students to post per
sonal profiles to meet other students in the area.
"The idea is that you can not only find out
what's going on at the other schools, but you can
network and meet people using their profiles,"
said Fredette, who manages many of the technical
aspects of the site.
Wicked Party.com also sponsors events such as
club nights, but it has experienced difficulty at
tracting students to events. The first two events
were held at a bar next to Fenway Park, and the
most recent was a Halloween party.
"The bar was difficult to work with and the
turnout was bad," Decker said.
Organizers say students can put their names on
a guest fist through their school's promoter and

pay a reduced admission to the club, but one stu
dent who attended the Halloween party said that
the event did not meet expectations.
"It just seemed really unorganized," MIT ju
nior Julie Burstein said. "There were no guest lists
like they had said there would be, and inside the
club, you couldn't tell which people were college
students and which weren't. It defeated the pur
pose of going."
But organizers expect the next party a beach
bash on Nov. 20 to be more successful. "This
time [the promoters] have plenty of time to adver
tise, and it will be much more organized," he said.
For organizers, the Web venture has helped
them meet students from other schools in the area.
"I hang out with Wicked Party.com people all
the time," sophomore and promoter Dan Wein
beck said. "I love that every person I work with is
as outgoing and social as I am."
But organizers recognize that they still have
work to do to make the website successful.
"Right now, it's just about gaining clout,"
Agarwal said.
"You have to remember that we're college stu
dents," the computer science and electrical engi
neering double-major said. "We have classes and
a lot of other stuff going on, too."
