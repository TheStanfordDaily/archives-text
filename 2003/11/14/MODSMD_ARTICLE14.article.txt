# Extreme smoking fights for rights

There's a new extreme sport at Ohio
University: extreme smoking.
Jenn Shagrin, Cara Smith and Sarah
Smith are in the process of founding an
Extreme Smokers Club. The three
freshmen walked through South Green
residence halls, asking residents to sign
a list if they were interested in joining
the club and purchasing a hooded
sweatshirt. So far there are about 50
names on the list, most of which are
freshmen.
The group is more than the Ameri
can Cancer Society's worst nightmare.
"It's to form a coalition with a firm be
lief in tobacco rights," said Shagrin. She
and her neighbors on South Green had
frequently discussed the idea of bring
ing back residence halls in which smok
ing would be permitted. Only smokers
would live in these dorms.
"We also believe that nonsmokers

have rights," Shagrin said, and forbid
ding smoking in "buildings that every
one has access to is understandable, but
dormitories aren't."
"We decided we should rally our
support together to make some kind of
action possible," she said.
The founders are in the process of
putting together the club's mission
statement and planning a course of ac
tion to take their ideas to OU adminis
tration after they have formed "some
what of a coalition." Shagrin said that
petitions are being considered.
Bryan Helminiak, resident director
of the Atkinson Complex on South
Green, said there were several reasons
why this year was the first that OU of
fered no residence halls in which smok
ing was permitted. He said OU had
been phasing out those types of resi
dence halls.
The main reason to eliminate these
residence halls was in consideration for
students with allergies to smoking, he
said.
