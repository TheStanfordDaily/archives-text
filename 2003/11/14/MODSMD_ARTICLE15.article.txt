# Student suicides increase and move into the spotlight

(U-WIRE) ITHACA, N.Y.
The issue of suicide on col
lege campuses has been thrust
into the national media spot
light following three New York
University student suicides this
semester.
According to the Jed Foun
dation, a non-profit organiza
tion committed to reducing the
suicide rate among young
adults, approximately seven col
lege students per 100,000 die
from suicide each year. The or
ganization projects 1,100 sui
cides this year among college
students. According the U.S.
Department of Health, the sui
cide rate among teens tripled
between 1970-1990, rising from
3.6 youths per 100,000 to 11.
"Nationwide, you will see
colleges and universities priori
tizing suicide prevention," said
Sharon Dittman, associate di
rector of community relations at
Gannett: Cornell University
Health Services.
Last April, there were four
student deaths at Cornell, al
though not all were determined
to be suicides.
"We are doing more and
more every year [to prevent sui
cides]," Dittman said. "We are
determined to become atypical
[with respect to national aver
ages]."
The university has set out to
accomplish this goal in a num
ber of ways. For the past six
years, after every suicide at Cor
nell, the Community Support
Team Network has met to re
spond to and assess each situa
tion.
"We go out on very short
notice and help people talk
about their feelings and
thoughts and come together as
a community," explained Phil
Meilman, director of counsel
ing and psychological services
and support team member.
"It's one of the best things
we've instituted."
It is not yet clear whether the
three suicides at NYU were re
lated, but concern over the
"copycat" effect of a suicide is
omnipresent. "It's a time when
anyone who has had a suicidal
thought tends to revisit it,"
Meilman said. "It's a time when
people are particularly vulnera
ble."
This is one of the primary
reasons the support team was
formed.
Support team and suicide
prevention foundations nation
wide have discovered that the
secret to prevention may lie in
awareness. According to Kent
Hubbell '67, the Robert W. and
Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Stu
dents, "The key is to educate the
community when they find a
student who they believe is in
crisis."
Collaborating with the Uni
versity Counseling and Advis
ing Network, Cornell has begun
programs to help educate com
munity members who are in a
position to help, including resi
dential advisors.
According to Dittmann, the
most important outreach likely
comes from peers.
"I think that students really
need to take care of one anoth
er," Hubbell said. "If someone
who you are acquainted with is
thinking about suicide and ex
pressing it in various ways, we
need to know."
"It's these personal connec
tions that can make a huge dif
ference," Dittman added.
The reason awareness is so
important is that it most often
leads to counseling for students
who are exhibiting signs of trou
ble, Dittman said. "If you look
at the statistics, it's a relative mi
nority of people who are in
counseling who commit suicide
nationwide," Meilman ex
plained. "People who commit
suicide tend not to be in coun
seling."
According to Meilman, mak
ing sure people get help and
counseling is a a priority on East
Hill.
When Cornell students do
seek counseling through Gan
nett's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services department,
each is given a mental health
screening to determine suicide
risk factors. Once counseling

begins, it can act as a protective
factor.
"Suicidal thinking is not an
all-or-nothing proposition,"
Meilman added. "It's usually
51-49 [in the person's mind]. In
order to get someone from sui
cidal to not suicidal, all we need
is a one percent shift. Just a little
help at the critical moment can
make the difference between
life and death."
Recent lawsuits have forced
universities to reevaluate the
amount of outreach they offer
students contemplating suicide.
In 2000, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology student Eliza
beth Chin and Ferrum College
student Michael Frentzel both
committed suicide, after which
their parents initiated litigation
against each respective univer
sity. They alleged that the
schools were too concerned
with student privacy that they
overlooked obvious warning
signs that the students were sui
cidal.
While the verdict on the case
against MIT is still pending,
Ferrum College reached an
agreement with the Frentzel
family in which they admitted
they had failed to recognize key
warning signs.
Because of the media atten
tion being devoted to these two
cases —in addition to the re
cent NYU suicides universi
ties nationwide are taking steps
to avoid a .repeat of these
tragedies.
Cornell has engaged in meet
ings with a group of peer institu
tions. These universities, which
met last week in New York to
continue discussions, are work
ing closely with the Jed Founda
tion to help prevent suicides.
The foundation was founded by
the parents of a University of
Arizona student who took his
own life.
"[These meetings] have been
very good because [they] enable
us to talk to peer institutions
and brainstorm together and
look at what's being done,"
Meilman, who attended one of
the meetings last Tuesday, said.
"You get a cross-pollination of
ideas."
"These problems are not
unique to Cornell," Dittman
added. "We shouldn't work
from scratch."
Striking the balance between
privacy and outreach a cen
tral feature of the MIT and Fer
rum College lawsuits can be
a difficult task for universities to
accomplish.
"Some people feel strongly
that [early detection programs]
are an invasion of privacy,"
Hubbell said. "Especially at
Cornell, where we have a great
tradition of protecting personal
privacy." Yet, Hubbell contin
ued, "the idea would be to come
up with some kind of [early out
reach] system that allows stu
dents in this kind of community
to [help each other]."
"Privacy has a very high
value, but saving lives has a
higher value," Meilman said.
"You can't protect the former if
someone isn't alive."
Meilman also stressed that
the University can notify stu
dents' families that a life-and
death problem exists without
necessarily revealing the rea
sons for that situation doing
so could be exceedingly invasive
for the person seeking help.
"Most of the time, families are
amazingly helpful when it
comes to a crisis of life-threat
ening proportion," he reiterat
ed.
Nearly everyone agrees that
suicide prevention programs
and efforts could always be im
proved. "Every time there's
been a suicide in recent memo
ry, we always feel like there's
more we could be doing,"
Dittman said. However, she
noted that she felt good about
the programs that have been im
plemented as the university has
made constant forward progress
in suicide prevention. "It's the
evolution of [our efforts] that
makes us feel good," she ex
plained.
"It's fair to say that Cornell is
not a place where there are
more suicides than other uni
versities, but that doesn't mean
we can't continue to strive to get
better," Hubbell said. "One sui
cide is too many."

cides this year among college
students. According the U.S.
Department of Health, the sui
cide rate among teens tripled
between 1970-1990, rising from
3.6 youths per 100,000 to 11.
"Nationwide, you will see
colleges and universities priori
tizing suicide prevention," said
Sharon Dittman, associate di
rector of community relations at
Gannett: Cornell University
Health Services.
Last April, there were four
student deaths at Cornell, al
though not all were determined
to be suicides.
"We are doing more and
more every year [to prevent sui
cides]," Dittman said. "We are
determined to become atypical
[with respect to national aver
ages]."
The university has set out to
accomplish this goal in a num
ber of ways. For the past six
years, after every suicide at Cor
nell, the Community Support
Team Network has met to re
spond to and assess each situa
tion.
"We go out on very short
notice and help people talk
about their feelings and
thoughts and come together as
a community," explained Phil
Meilman, director of counsel
ing and psychological services
and support team member.
"It's one of the best things
we've instituted."
It is not yet clear whether the
three suicides at NYU were re
lated, but concern over the
"copycat" effect of a suicide is
omnipresent. "It's a time when
anyone who has had a suicidal
thought tends to revisit it,"
Meilman said. "It's a time when
people are particularly vulnera
ble."
This is one of the primary
reasons the support team was
formed.
Support team and suicide
prevention foundations nation
wide have discovered that the
secret to prevention may lie in
awareness. According to Kent
Hubbell '67, the Robert W. and
Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Stu
dents, "The key is to educate the
community when they find a
student who they believe is in
crisis."
Collaborating with the Uni
versity Counseling and Advis
ing Network, Cornell has begun
programs to help educate com
munity members who are in a
position to help, including resi
dential advisors.
According to Dittmann, the
most important outreach likely
comes from peers.
"I think that students really
need to take care of one anoth
er," Hubbell said. "If someone
who you are acquainted with is
thinking about suicide and ex
pressing it in various ways, we
need to know."
"It's these personal connec
tions that can make a huge dif
ference," Dittman added.
The reason awareness is so
important is that it most often
leads to counseling for students
who are exhibiting signs of trou
ble, Dittman said. "If you look
at the statistics, it's a relative mi
nority of people who are in
counseling who commit suicide
nationwide," Meilman ex
plained. "People who commit
suicide tend not to be in coun
seling."
According to Meilman, mak
ing sure people get help and
counseling is a a priority on East
Hill.
When Cornell students do
seek counseling through Gan
nett's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services department,
each is given a mental health
screening to determine suicide
risk factors. Once counseling

begins, it can act as a protective
factor.
"Suicidal thinking is not an
all-or-nothing proposition,"
Meilman added. "It's usually
51-49 [in the person's mind]. In
order to get someone from sui
cidal to not suicidal, all we need
is a one percent shift. Just a little
help at the critical moment can
make the difference between
life and death."
Recent lawsuits have forced
universities to reevaluate the
amount of outreach they offer
students contemplating suicide.
In 2000, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology student Eliza
beth Chin and Ferrum College
student Michael Frentzel both
committed suicide, after which
their parents initiated litigation
against each respective univer
sity. They alleged that the
schools were too concerned
with student privacy that they
overlooked obvious warning
signs that the students were sui
cidal.
While the verdict on the case
against MIT is still pending,
Ferrum College reached an
agreement with the Frentzel
family in which they admitted
they had failed to recognize key
warning signs.
Because of the media atten
tion being devoted to these two
cases —in addition to the re
cent NYU suicides universi
ties nationwide are taking steps
to avoid a .repeat of these
tragedies.
Cornell has engaged in meet
ings with a group of peer institu
tions. These universities, which
met last week in New York to
continue discussions, are work
ing closely with the Jed Founda
tion to help prevent suicides.
The foundation was founded by
the parents of a University of
Arizona student who took his
own life.
"[These meetings] have been
very good because [they] enable
us to talk to peer institutions
and brainstorm together and
look at what's being done,"
Meilman, who attended one of
the meetings last Tuesday, said.
"You get a cross-pollination of
ideas."
"These problems are not
unique to Cornell," Dittman
added. "We shouldn't work
from scratch."
Striking the balance between
privacy and outreach a cen
tral feature of the MIT and Fer
rum College lawsuits can be
a difficult task for universities to
accomplish.
"Some people feel strongly
that [early detection programs]
are an invasion of privacy,"
Hubbell said. "Especially at
Cornell, where we have a great
tradition of protecting personal
privacy." Yet, Hubbell contin
ued, "the idea would be to come
up with some kind of [early out
reach] system that allows stu
dents in this kind of community
to [help each other]."
"Privacy has a very high
value, but saving lives has a
higher value," Meilman said.
"You can't protect the former if
someone isn't alive."
Meilman also stressed that
the University can notify stu
dents' families that a life-and
death problem exists without
necessarily revealing the rea
sons for that situation doing
so could be exceedingly invasive
for the person seeking help.
"Most of the time, families are
amazingly helpful when it
comes to a crisis of life-threat
ening proportion," he reiterat
ed.
Nearly everyone agrees that
suicide prevention programs
and efforts could always be im
proved. "Every time there's
been a suicide in recent memo
ry, we always feel like there's
more we could be doing,"
Dittman said. However, she
noted that she felt good about
the programs that have been im
plemented as the university has
made constant forward progress
in suicide prevention. "It's the
evolution of [our efforts] that
makes us feel good," she ex
plained.
"It's fair to say that Cornell is
not a place where there are
more suicides than other uni
versities, but that doesn't mean
we can't continue to strive to get
better," Hubbell said. "One sui
cide is too many."
