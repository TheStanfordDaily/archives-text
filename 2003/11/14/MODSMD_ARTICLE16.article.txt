## Stein on fearing poor people and The Gap 
### JOEL STEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Note: No one said we need a special occasion to
celebrate tacky humor and spontaneous rioting. Joel Stein,
Class of' 93, is the current humor columnist for Time mag
azine. Here, we print one of his vintage columns from The
Daily, written after the '92 Los Angeles riots.

This isn't about white guilt. Jews don't have white guilt.
Jews have more kinds of guilt than you've ever heard of
guilt about leaving lights on, guilt about breaking large
bills, guilt about eating all the little crumb things off the
Entenmann's doughnuts they even have some kind of
misplaced guilt about food products containing yeast. But
they don't have white guilt.
This is about violence. It's about revolution. It's about
making real sacrifices. Like wearing black on hot Friday
afternoons.
When I watched the riots on the television in my well
protected dorm lounge, I had mixed feelings. Most of me
was repulsed and scared and like all the politicians who
repeat the same platitudes the way Phi Delts respond to
an "incident" "sickened."
But another part of me I'm still not sure which one,
but I'm sure it was wearing black was excited. This
other, more demented part of me hoped the riots would
keep going.
My whole life I had these assumptions about what I
could expect from people. I could expect them to laugh
politely at my jokes; I could expect them to eat pizza with
a knife and fork when they were with my friends' parents;
I could expect them, even if they were atheists, to spout
short, religious statements whenever I sneezed.
And, most of all, I could expect them not to steal arm
fuls of CDs and tube socks while police just stood there
and watched.
And this sick part of me got a vicarious thrill out of
watching people taking power, however twisted and vio
lent the method might be, into their own hands.
I liked the anarchy. I liked the rebellion. And I liked
the silly way people run when they have large appliances
strapped onto their backs. In some weird way, it was the
America I had always envisioned.
I was watching people lose their jobs, their homes and
their lives. And although I knew I shouldn't have, I felt
good in some weird way. For a second, I felt free.
I think some of this arose because I experienced my
own suburban version of looting in a very safe, very
white way. Let's see, if I can just remember ...
It was the summer after my freshman year, and the
CPPC had just let me down in a big way. So I filled out an
employment card at Compact Disc World, and knocked
their socks off by quoting Elway Blues when they asked
about my past criminal record.
Although I got a kick out of spending my day memo
rizing things like the name of the one black guy in "The
Average White Band," I hated the job. I knew the fat guy
who owned the store was doing nothing and making all
the money. And the only thing he gave me was a big, ugly,
yellow pin with my name on it.
So one day a day so hot I thought I was in a Spike
Lee movie I swiped a couple of discs, shoved a small
wad of cash in my pants and walked right through the
door.
I felt like some suburban teenager from a Joyce Carol
Oates story, hoping to get arrested so my wealthy, di
vorced father would finally pay attention to me. But it
wasn't like that. I was just frustrated ...
All right, so I only get a three for rebellion. But once I
got home and played my brand new, still hot, copy of the
soundtrack to "The Graduate," I wound up pulling a 30
for hp sync. And, for me, well, it was a pretty big moment
overall.
So when I watched the riots, I think that part of me
came back. The part that said, "I don't want to go to law
school. I don't want to get a nine to five job. I don't event
want to fulfill DR 8."
I liked watching everything fall to pieces before my
eyes. Especially The Gap. I hate The Gap.
And there was plenty of white guys like me in San Fran
cisco, running from stores with boxes of, well, loot. It was
like America brought in a substitute teacher for two days
and no one wanted to pass up the chance to throw spit
balls.
But deep inside, I knew if I had been in San Francisco, I
wouldn't have taken any pocket-T's, not even black ones.
Because when I hear a bunch of white people singing
along to that catchy Tracy Chapman song as it spins on
their five-disc changer, I have to take a step back.
I realize that these poor people who are going to rise up
are going to rise up against me. And they're not going to
be carrying acoustic guitars.
As much as I may empathize with the rioting, I still
have too much invested in the system to not feel relieved
at the sight of national guardsmen in L.A. though I
question the purpose of camouflage suits in South Central
Los Angeles.
And after seeing all the things I had once placed so
much faith in fall apart, even just for those two days, I
can't trust them any more.
The people in the inner cities understand power struc
tures far better than I do. And although the romantic
trope of La Revolution may appeal to us, neither I nor Ms.
Chapman is going to be thrilled when the "poor people"
get organized.
Somebody's got to do something soon, or people are
going to stop asking "Why are they burning their own
cities?" and start building those "Escape from New York"
walls somewhere right between the upper West Side and
Harlem.
I wonder how much apartments cost in London and
whether or not they'd like my accent.
Hey, they went for Terry Gilliam.
