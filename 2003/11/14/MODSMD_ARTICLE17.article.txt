## Psych researchers hit paydirt in preschool 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford University campus is
world-renowned for its ability to train and
shape the leaders of tomorrow. Few stu
dents are aware that it is also renowned for
training the kindergarteners of tomorrow.
Located on Escondido Road, just east
of the bollards in Escondido Village, the
Bing Nursery School sits on four acres of
well-manicured Stanford land. It suffers
from a case of being hidden in plain sight;
the school lies just behind the Rains gradu
ate housing and a short walk down Escon
dido from Mirrielees, but few Stanford stu
dents know of its existence.
In fact, seclusion is one of the things the
school strives for. "The founding director
said she liked this site because it would
take a while for the rest of the campus to
encroach upon it," said Director Jeanne
Lepper. "Sufficient space is very impor
tant."
In child-rearing circles, however, the
school is anything but hidden. "Child"
magazine has listed Bing as one of the 10
best preschools in the nation. "Gentry," a
Silicon Valley-specific publication, said
that it is a place where "anything is possible
... a stage for child's play of such richness
and wonder it can make you believe in
magic."
Despite the loaded imagery, at this point
you're probably wondering, "So what?"
There are plenty of quality preschools in the
country, and just because one of them sits
on the Stanford campus doesn't make it ter
ribly special. Bing is unique, though, be
cause while the school's 450 students are
getting a quality preschool experience, they
are also the subjects of studies and experi
ments conducted by members of the Stan
ford psychology department.
"The purpose of the school," Lepper

x r ' JTJL
said, "is to be a research laboratory."
Some of the most important studies on child development have been con
ducted at Bing. Stanford psychology professor Albert Bandura's famous "Bobo
doll studies" involved showing the preschoolers a video of an adult hitting a bob
bing blowup doll and proved that televised violence resulted in imitation in
young viewers. Bandura later testified before Congress on his findings.
Mark Lepper, Jeanne Lepper's husband and another professor at the Universi
ty, conducted an experiment on how extrinsic rewards (i.e. candy, points, chips) can
undermine a child's intrinsic desire to participate in an activity. To complete his
study, Lepper utilized one of Bing's two observation rooms, replete with a one-way
mirror, to examine how children behaved in a controlled experiment.
But it's not only faculty that utilize the research capabilities of Bing. Students
in several psychology classes have the opportunity to work with children here. In
fact, students in Psychology 147, a class on development and early childhood, are
required to complete a research project at Bing, typically an in-depth study of one
child who is closely watched for a period of time.
The final project of Ilyssa Silverman, who took Psych 147 as a student, turned

into a children's illustrated book titled "It
Feels Good To Be Let In." The book was
motivated by Silverman's observation of
preschoolers who were excluded from
groups and published by Helen Bing, the
school's namesake and primary donor. Sil
verman is now a full-time teacher at the
school.
"It's a haven for students that are
going to go out and be teachers, or physi
cians, or clinicians," Jeanne Lepper said.
The Bing campus is architecturally
impressive: an open-air atrium, offices and
three large classrooms that each open up
into their own half-acre play yard. Red
wood trees, wisteria vines, trellises, sand
lots, water spouts and traditional play
ground equipment fill the yards.
"We're so lucky," Lepper added,
"the University provides us with a wonder
ful gardening team."
Lepper, who was involved with Bing
at its opening in 1966, was visibly excited
when she gave a tour of the school grounds
last Wednesday. She stopped several times
to point and whisper, "Oh, look what that
child is doing!" One time it was a girl clean
ing up without being asked the
blocks she had been playing with; another
time a group of children had invented a
game using some old car tires; in a third in
stance, a girl was playing a make-believe
rescue game.
This attitude of childlike wonder at a
child's activities infects Bing's staff, which
includes almost 40 full- and part-time teach
ers. Eric Stuart, an East Palo Alto native
who volunteered at Bing during his high
school years at St. Francis, is now the head
teacher in Bing's easternmost classroom.
"Our theme of our classroom this
fall is holes," he said. "It's something that's
different. So many things in every day life
have holes. We have holes in our shoes,
holes in our face."

One of the thematic activities involved burying "treasure" really just deco
rated trinkets in a hole in the sandpit. Another involved an intricate series of
pipes and tubes down which students could roll balls.
"For show-and-tell, we had somebody bring in a cheese grater yesterday," he
said. Another child brought in a whiffle ball for her "holy" show-and-tell object.
After high school, Stuart attended Long Beach State and received a bache
lor's in child development a degree typical of Bing staffers. He returned to
Bing because of "the teachers and the children. It's a wonderful place to work."
About 50 percent of Bing's students are the children of Stanford staff mem
bers. Slots are reserved for members of the community as well. The school's an
nual Harvest Moon silent auction is tomorrow at the Schwab residence center
and will seek donations to cover the cost of some of the $250,000 to $300,000 in
scholarships that the school gives out every year.
Back at Bing, walking through the snack-time smells of freshly cut pears and
juice, it's easy to get a little bit lost in talk about the particulars: the architecture,
playtime activities, fundraising events. Lepper likes to keep it all in perspective.
"Early experiences affect children deeply," she said. "That's the point."
