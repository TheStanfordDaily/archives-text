## Grad dorm plan poses problems 
### 
We agree with Kathleen Sullivan,
dean of the Law School, that some
thing needs to be done about hous
ing for law students and other grad
uate students at Stanford. With plans in the works
to provide beds for an additional 700 students, the
University has taken a decisive step toward solv
ing one of its most pervasive problems. But as de
sign decisions are made and drawings are final

ized, we hope the
University will take
a very careful look
at the impact that
the various plans
for the new housing
structure or
structures will
have on the campus
as a whole.
Current plans
call for a large dorm
complex in the area
behind Stern Hall,
which is currently
occupied by the Za
pata parking lot.
The complex will
house between 600
and 700 students
pegging it at more
than three times the
size of Toyon Hall,
which sleeps 215,
according to the

ASSU Draw Guide. While the need for graduate
housing is desperate, the reason behind concen
trating all of these beds in one facility has not been
clearly articulated by the University.
The facility may be five or even six stories
high, according to a highly placed University
source. Four houses on Salvatierra walk will be
demolished in order to make way for this dorm.
And the construction of such a facility while
it may alleviate traffic in other parts of campus
and will cut down on the total number of com

muters driving to campus every day will un
doubtedly increase congestion on Campus
Drive in the vicinity of the new dorm.
Parking for the new structure, according to
Sullivan, may come in the form of several large
garages nearby. These structures would not
only be unsightly, but also would increase the
overall footprint of the facility beyond its
presently envisioned size.

As it is current
ly planned, the pro
posed graduate
dormitory is entire
ly out-of-scale for its
location. It would
be preferable for
the University to re
duce the size of this
facility and make
space elsewhere on
campus to accom
modate additional
graduate student
dorms.
While we
strongly believe
that graduate stu
dents should be
able to choose to
live on-campus,
the currently
planned graduate
student dorm is
not an end-all so

lution to this major problem. While we com
mend University administrators for their will
ingness to try to find housing for graduate stu
dents, it is time to take these plans back to the
drawing board. With University Architect
David Neuman soon departing for the Univer
sity of Virginia, it is ever more imperative that
the University work to ensure that the aesthet
ic character of our campus is properly pre
served, and we urge administrators to take this
obligation very seriously.
