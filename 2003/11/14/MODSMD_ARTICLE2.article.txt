# Stanford o-line gets physical
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
You can offer a number of explanations
about why the much-maligned Stanford of
fense has suddenly clicked in its last two
games, but one of the most important ratio
nales has been too-easily overlooked: the play
of the young Cardinal offensive line.
Entering the season, the Stanford coaching
staff knew fourth-year starter Kirk Chambers
would be a rock at left tackle, but the rest of the
offensive line was a big question mark with 12
of the 16 linemen either redshirt or true fresh
men.
And when starting center Brian Head was
lost for the season after injuring his knee in the
Cardinal's embarrassing loss at USC, it was
supposed to spell doomsday.
Instead, senior Drew Caylor, who spent
most of his time as a defensive end the last two
years, has stepped in admirably at center, red
shirt freshmen guards Ismail Simpson and Jeff
Edwards have continued to improve in each of
their eight starts and senior right tackle Mike
Sullivan has helped anchor the line along with
Chambers.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens has
continually pointed out a so-called week-to
week progression in the offensive line, but
such a progression has not been readily appar
ent to the naked eye until the last two weeks.
In Stanford's first six games, the offensive
line surrendered 18.5 sacks.
In its last two?
Only three.
"It's just acclimating to things they'd never
seen before and things they'd never done be
fore," Teevens said. "There were some times
guys were cut loose and they couldn't maintain
or sustain a block for a long period of time.
"Now they've done it seven or eight games
in, and they're just better than when they'd
never done it before."
Also, in Stanford's first six games, Teevens
and offensive coordinator David Kelly
seemed hesitant to let their quarterbacks
throw the ball down the field with great regu
larity. In the last two wins over UCLA and
Arizona State, Chris Lewis has gone down the
field consistently including two long com
pletions to freshman wideout Evan Moore last
week.
"Chris can throw passes now that he
couldn't throw earlier in the season because
the offensive line is holding blocks longer,"
Teevens said. "And because of some of the
things we've done, we're not seeing as
much pressure as we were seeing ear
lier in the season.
"People were increasing their blitz
package by 30-50 percent against us
and just putting great pressure on the
offensive line to hold blocks and to
make the quarterback get rid of the
ball more quickly. They're now pass
protecting better and that's allowed
us to hold the ball a little bit longer."
A telling example of how far the
line has come occurred last week,
when Edwards sustained a knee in
jury in the first half and had to leave
the game. Fellow redshirt freshman
Josiah Vinson replaced him in the
lineup and, instead of panicking
about what to do, didn't seem to miss
a beat.
"We feel very comfortable with
him," Teevens said. "He's acclimated
quickly and I thought he finished the
[Arizona State] game on a strong
note."
(With Edwards still reeling from
that knee injury, Vinson will start in
Edwards' place this weekend at Ore
gon State.)
The biggest difference, for
Teevens at least, has been a growing

understanding on the part of the
young linemen about what it means
to pass protect.
"Look at a redshirt freshman such
as Edwards, who is a wishbone offen
sive guard, and he'd never taken an
offensive pass set in high school," said
Teevens. "They were thrust into the
fire and they did a tremendous job
learning quickly."
Others offer more simple explana
tions for the recent successes.
"They're focusing a lot better,"
running back J.R. Lemon said.
"They've been pretty much the same
all year. It's a matter of clicking during
game time."
(Lemon, of course, should know.
He rushed for a career high 151 yards
last week the most for a Stanford
back since Mike Mitchell ran for 179
yards in 1994.)
Of course, these are the guys you
never hear about. It's the nature of
being an offensive lineman. When
you play poorly, people rip you.
When you play well, people don't no
tice and your teammates are the only
ones to pat you on the back.
That probably doesn't matter all
that much to offensive line coach
Steve Morton and the rest of his con
tingent— as long as Stanford just
keeps on winning.

about what to do, didn't seem to miss
a beat.
"We feel very comfortable with
him," Teevens said. "He's acclimated
quickly and I thought he finished the
[Arizona State] game on a strong
note."
(With Edwards still reeling from
that knee injury, Vinson will start in
Edwards' place this weekend at Ore
gon State.)
The biggest difference, for
Teevens at least, has been a growing

understanding on the part of the
young linemen about what it means
to pass protect.
"Look at a redshirt freshman such
as Edwards, who is a wishbone offen
sive guard, and he'd never taken an
offensive pass set in high school," said
Teevens. "They were thrust into the
fire and they did a tremendous job
learning quickly."
Others offer more simple explana
tions for the recent successes.
"They're focusing a lot better,"
running back J.R. Lemon said.
"They've been pretty much the same
all year. It's a matter of clicking during
game time."
(Lemon, of course, should know.
He rushed for a career high 151 yards
last week the most for a Stanford
back since Mike Mitchell ran for 179
yards in 1994.)
Of course, these are the guys you
never hear about. It's the nature of
being an offensive lineman. When
you play poorly, people rip you.
When you play well, people don't no
tice and your teammates are the only
ones to pat you on the back.
That probably doesn't matter all
that much to offensive line coach
Steve Morton and the rest of his con
tingent— as long as Stanford just
keeps on winning.

The offensive line has been the unsung hero of the Stanford's recent offensive
successes and looks to continue its tight pass protection at OSU.
