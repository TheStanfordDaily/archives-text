# Stanford o-line gets physical
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
You can offer a number of explanations
about why the much-maligned Stanford of
fense has suddenly clicked in its last two
games, but one of the most important ratio
nales has been too-easily overlooked: the play
of the young Cardinal offensive line.
Entering the season, the Stanford coaching
staff knew fourth-year starter Kirk Chambers
would be a rock at left tackle, but the rest of the
offensive line was a big question mark with 12
of the 16 linemen either redshirt or true fresh
men.
And when starting center Brian Head was
lost for the season after injuring his knee in the
Cardinal's embarrassing loss at USC, it was
supposed to spell doomsday.
Instead, senior Drew Caylor, who spent
most of his time as a defensive end the last two
years, has stepped in admirably at center, red
shirt freshmen guards Ismail Simpson and Jeff
Edwards have continued to improve in each of
their eight starts and senior right tackle Mike
Sullivan has helped anchor the line along with
Chambers.
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens has
continually pointed out a so-called week-to
week progression in the offensive line, but
such a progression has not been readily appar
ent to the naked eye until the last two weeks.
In Stanford's first six games, the offensive
line surrendered 18.5 sacks.
In its last two?
Only three.
"It's just acclimating to things they'd never
seen before and things they'd never done be
fore," Teevens said. "There were some times
guys were cut loose and they couldn't maintain
or sustain a block for a long period of time.
"Now they've done it seven or eight games
in, and they're just better than when they'd
never done it before."
Also, in Stanford's first six games, Teevens
and offensive coordinator David Kelly
seemed hesitant to let their quarterbacks
throw the ball down the field with great regu
larity. In the last two wins over UCLA and
Arizona State, Chris Lewis has gone down the
field consistently including two long com
pletions to freshman wideout Evan Moore last
week.
"Chris can throw passes now that he
couldn't throw earlier in the season because
the offensive line is holding blocks longer,"
Teevens said. "And because of some of the
