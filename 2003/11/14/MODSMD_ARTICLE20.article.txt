# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Tresidder Union is not that cool 
### 
A concept building like
most of Stanford's recent
structures requires an
understandably tedious
drafting process. The blueprint design
requires such considerations as sym
metry, beauty, efficiency, ease of pas
sage and more.
Tresidder Union, on the other
hand, is different. This is not "differ
ent," but "special," as Kathleen Ann
Magnuson lovingly reassures me.
Tresidder is different like that carton
of eggs you bought from the grocery
store that hatched into a two-headed,
neutered-Smurf a cappella group
called "Everyday People." Tresidder
is different like that rash you found
"downstairs" one day which the doc
tor wasn't able to diagnose so you
seared it off with a hot spoon and then
passed out in your tighty-whiteys on
your roommate's beanbag chair.
By you, I mean me.
By me, I mean my friend Rod.
Tresidder's design serves to deflect
students, not collect them. Either the
CoHo or the Treehouse would fill the
student union void were it not for the
mere shape of their allotted spaces.
Whenever something minimally ex
citing happens, the CoHo maxes its ca
pacity like a Residential Education de
partment MasterCard on crotchless
armor at the wholesale S&M outlet.
Musical performances are popular on
the CoHo stage, but the audience is di
vided equally between people to the
very front and those to the very left of it
nothing in between. Finding a seat if
you're a student is equivalent to finding
a use if you're a Stanford Community
Service personnel. In both cases, you
have to stretch the definitions of the ob
ject of your quest. And don't even at
tempt to score one of those coveted at
the-counter seats with the electrical
jacks because the kids sitting there now
have been there since 1986. No joke.
The Treehouse is similarly hindered
by space. There are two or three tables
at the front for the lucky ones, a line of
booths along the inner wall that put
your eye at the anus level of everyone

waiting for burritos and then there's a
collection of tables in the back a
cave-like belly of the joint where

there's no cell
phone service and
you can't watch TV
without a crucified
cartoon character
with an oddly
swollen groinal
area staring at your
lunch. What the
hell? Not the most
inviting dining at
mosphere.

Besides those two valid attempts at
student unification, what else does
Tresidder offer?
Well, it has an exercise facility.
What a convenient place for it, too. To
add to the embarrassment of jogging
past your beer-festing, ridiculing peers
in sweat bands and tube socks, your
jumping jacks and toe curls must be
performed before an audience. It's a
real shame for the females who mount
the stair-masters to the sheer delight of
those Stanford Hair barber dudes
the ones who always give you the same
haircut no matter who says what. So I
pose this question: Is this a gym or an
elaborate peep show?
Tres-X is a prime example of the
need for monopoly restrictions in the
United States. When you pay $4 for a
candy bar and $39 for a box of cereal
and then find them both stale, there's
a high probability your next $4 will be
spent on a gallon of gasoline and a box
of matches.
But dare I criticize the Stanford
Store? Of course not! The proceeds go
to us students. If the bookstore is evil,
then this is our way to fight the man.
The Stanford Store is where you should
go to buy those Stanford T-shirts and
sweatshirts and hats and T-shirts and
hats that you never seem to stop wear
ing day in and day out a redundant
little reminder of that which we already
know: You go to friggin' Stanford. On
second thought, don't shop at the Stan
ford Store. Here're some old jeans and
a Van Halen shirt. You can keep 'em.

Besides the Lair, the upstairs is
pretty useless.
There's the Stanford Credit Union
where everyone banks at as freshman
and where no one banks at as sopho
mores or ever again in our lives.
There's the Office of Student Ac
tivities: An office of people who gen
uinely want the Stanford party scene
to return but are rendered powerless
by the checks and balances of the Uni
versity bureaucracy. By checks and
balances, I'm referring to the tazer
like devices attached to the genitals of
OSA employees installed by Resi
dential Education for the purposes of
"checking" and / or "balancing".
And how about the new Tresidder
additions... the ones Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni boast
ed in his list of accomplishments for
making our lives more fun? Hmm.
Thanks, Gene, but it's still just a
cafeteria. There's no arcade, no bowl
ing alley, no wet bar, no roulette
wheel, no Beirut tables, no slip 'n'
slides, no roller-girls, no Hollywood
Hogan, no Million Dollar Man and no
Macho Man Randy Savage.
All of which are American Dreams.
I also thoroughly question
whether Peet's Coffee was the best
candidate for the location. After all,
the CoHo is just 30 yards away and
also serves coffee Peet's brand cof
fee in particular. Maybe they were
trying to prevent a monopoly in the
Peet's Coffee market?
In that case, let's add a Treehouse
taco stand next to the Treehouse, an
overpriced-yet-seldom-restocked
convenience vendor by Tres-X and,
if there's time, how about a women's
locker room with cold-water showers
and live Web-cam feeds to Stanford
Hair? But don't bother adding any
thing cool because there wasn't any
thing cool there to begin with.
Except Jamba Juice. Jamba Juice is
good.

nothing in between. Finding a seat if
you're a student is equivalent to finding
a use if you're a Stanford Community
Service personnel. In both cases, you
have to stretch the definitions of the ob
ject of your quest. And don't even at
tempt to score one of those coveted at
the-counter seats with the electrical
jacks because the kids sitting there now
have been there since 1986. No joke.
The Treehouse is similarly hindered
by space. There are two or three tables
at the front for the lucky ones, a line of
booths along the inner wall that put
your eye at the anus level of everyone

waiting for burritos and then there's a
collection of tables in the back a
cave-like belly of the joint where

there's no cell
phone service and
you can't watch TV
without a crucified
cartoon character
with an oddly
swollen groinal
area staring at your
lunch. What the
hell? Not the most
inviting dining at
mosphere.

Besides those two valid attempts at
student unification, what else does
Tresidder offer?
Well, it has an exercise facility.
What a convenient place for it, too. To
add to the embarrassment of jogging
past your beer-festing, ridiculing peers
in sweat bands and tube socks, your
jumping jacks and toe curls must be
performed before an audience. It's a
real shame for the females who mount
the stair-masters to the sheer delight of
those Stanford Hair barber dudes
the ones who always give you the same
haircut no matter who says what. So I
pose this question: Is this a gym or an
elaborate peep show?
Tres-X is a prime example of the
need for monopoly restrictions in the
United States. When you pay $4 for a
candy bar and $39 for a box of cereal
and then find them both stale, there's
a high probability your next $4 will be
spent on a gallon of gasoline and a box
of matches.
But dare I criticize the Stanford
Store? Of course not! The proceeds go
to us students. If the bookstore is evil,
then this is our way to fight the man.
The Stanford Store is where you should
go to buy those Stanford T-shirts and
sweatshirts and hats and T-shirts and
hats that you never seem to stop wear
ing day in and day out a redundant
little reminder of that which we already
know: You go to friggin' Stanford. On
second thought, don't shop at the Stan
ford Store. Here're some old jeans and
a Van Halen shirt. You can keep 'em.

Besides the Lair, the upstairs is
pretty useless.
There's the Stanford Credit Union
where everyone banks at as freshman
and where no one banks at as sopho
mores or ever again in our lives.
There's the Office of Student Ac
tivities: An office of people who gen
uinely want the Stanford party scene
to return but are rendered powerless
by the checks and balances of the Uni
versity bureaucracy. By checks and
balances, I'm referring to the tazer
like devices attached to the genitals of
OSA employees installed by Resi
dential Education for the purposes of
"checking" and / or "balancing".
And how about the new Tresidder
additions... the ones Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni boast
ed in his list of accomplishments for
making our lives more fun? Hmm.
Thanks, Gene, but it's still just a
cafeteria. There's no arcade, no bowl
ing alley, no wet bar, no roulette
wheel, no Beirut tables, no slip 'n'
slides, no roller-girls, no Hollywood
Hogan, no Million Dollar Man and no
Macho Man Randy Savage.
All of which are American Dreams.
I also thoroughly question
whether Peet's Coffee was the best
candidate for the location. After all,
the CoHo is just 30 yards away and
also serves coffee Peet's brand cof
fee in particular. Maybe they were
trying to prevent a monopoly in the
Peet's Coffee market?
In that case, let's add a Treehouse
taco stand next to the Treehouse, an
overpriced-yet-seldom-restocked
convenience vendor by Tres-X and,
if there's time, how about a women's
locker room with cold-water showers
and live Web-cam feeds to Stanford
Hair? But don't bother adding any
thing cool because there wasn't any
thing cool there to begin with.
Except Jamba Juice. Jamba Juice is
good.

A concept building like
most of Stanford's recent
structures requires an
understandably tedious
drafting process. The blueprint design
requires such considerations as sym
metry, beauty, efficiency, ease of pas
sage and more.
Tresidder Union, on the other
hand, is different. This is not "differ
ent," but "special," as Kathleen Ann
Magnuson lovingly reassures me.
Tresidder is different like that carton
of eggs you bought from the grocery
store that hatched into a two-headed,
neutered-Smurf a cappella group
called "Everyday People." Tresidder
is different like that rash you found
"downstairs" one day which the doc
tor wasn't able to diagnose so you
seared it off with a hot spoon and then
passed out in your tighty-whiteys on
your roommate's beanbag chair.
By you, I mean me.
By me, I mean my friend Rod.
Tresidder's design serves to deflect
students, not collect them. Either the
CoHo or the Treehouse would fill the
student union void were it not for the
mere shape of their allotted spaces.
Whenever something minimally ex
citing happens, the CoHo maxes its ca
pacity like a Residential Education de
partment MasterCard on crotchless
armor at the wholesale S&M outlet.
Musical performances are popular on
the CoHo stage, but the audience is di
vided equally between people to the
very front and those to the very left of it
nothing in between. Finding a seat if
you're a student is equivalent to finding
a use if you're a Stanford Community
Service personnel. In both cases, you
have to stretch the definitions of the ob
ject of your quest. And don't even at
tempt to score one of those coveted at
