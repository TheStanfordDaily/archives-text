## LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
### 
Ad letters should be refocused

Many of the letters to The Daily re
garding the volatile situation in the
Middle East have one thing in com
mon: The authors defending either
side cry for "active dialogue" and open
discussion. Yes, that's the way but I
thought active dialogue involves re
sponding to the other side's arguments
and addressing them, rather than re
peating the same thing over and over
regardless of what the proponents of
the other side say. This is what I see
happening with the accusations of
"racism" and "libel" thrown around by
the opponents of Campustruth.org
ads: Despite numerous rebuttals of
these charges in multiple letters to the
editor, the anti-ad authors keep saying
the same thing over again, in hopes
that by repeating the word "racism"
enough they'll convince the audience.
I also heard a lot of "if only" argu
ments: If only Israel returned to the
pre-1967 borders; if only Israel would
lift closures on Palestinian villages;
then all would be well and there will
be peace of our times. Well, at one
point Israel was at its pre-1967 bor
ders but there was no peace and if it
were not for the Israeli pre-emptive
strike in the Six-Day War, there
probably would be no Israel today.
Closures on Palestinian towns are not
always in place, so why no peace at
that time? What reason is there to be
lieve that when "if only" arguments
were satisfied there will be peace?
The children under Palestinian
Authority are brought up in the cli
mate of hate promoted by the Arab
media, and until that continues there
will be no peace. While martyrdom is
glorified and the Israelis / Jews /
Americans demonized, no Israeli
concessions and attempts at talks will
be successful. After all, when the
scapegoat for all the problems is
gone, the Palestinians may take a
closer look at the corruption in then
own leadership that squanders the re
lief money and uses the misery of its

people to promote its political goals.
Junior Ziyad Jabaji wrote that all
Arabs are often viewed as terrorists
by the American public, and I think
that indeed this does happen and it is
wrong. I also think that if more Arab
citizens and Arab leaders around the
world denounced terrorist attacks
on civilians openly and loudly, it
would greatly help to combat this er
roneous perception.

Sustainable development
Op-Ed misses the mark

Is this the way sustainable devel
opment is understood and translated?
I was quite shocked when reading the
article on sustainable development
("The essence of sustainable develop
ment," Nov. 6). The authors present
ed a reductive and outdated defini
tion of sustainable development and
bring critics that are ill founded.
Yes, the definition of sustainable
development is rather evasive (de
velopment that meets the needs of
the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs). But one
should be careful not to translate it
in a narrow and purely economic
function involving "maximizing"
and "results." That's misinterpret
ing and misrepresenting what the
concept is about.
Sustainable development is first of
all not an end, but a process. There
fore, the definition does not offer tools
("guidance") because it is not some
thing you can reach or attain. It is
more an ideology one should strive
for. It is not about avoiding but rather
about providing a direction. The eva
siveness of the definition of sustain
able development is not a shortcom
ing but a necessary quality for allow
ing development and change. Because
the concept of sustainable develop
ment deals with uncertainties, it is im

portant not to narrow it down to a
couple of indicators, which would be
outdated and meaningless after a
short while, but to leave it open in
order to allow it to evolve over time.
Anderson and Huggins argue
that sustainable development goes
against economic growth. No, it is
not. It only warns about irresponsi
ble and short-term growth. That's
quite different.
I almost had to laugh when reading:
"They [those who advocate sustainable
development] call for more govern
ment regulation to stop this growth."
Then I thought: "No, they just want to
provoke reactions; they don't think
what they write." But who knows.
For me, the essence of sustain
ability is about questioning what we
do and the way we do it and empha
sizing that our today's actions have
repercussions in the future.
I sincerely hope that the newspa
per will publish in the near future a
following article presenting another
view on sustainable development.
Authors of the article have omitted
crucial aspects of the concept of sus
tainable development that would be
only fair to mention.

Grad students prefer easy access

In regards to the photograph ac

new housing structure ("New grad
dorm may house 700," Nov. 13), Stan
ford officials should be applauded on
considering such a radical design for
graduate housing, in which one build
ing will lean precipitously towards what
appears to be Meyer Library. Perhaps
this is to encourage lagging doctoral

Ad letters should be refocused

Many of the letters to The Daily re
garding the volatile situation in the
Middle East have one thing in com
mon: The authors defending either
side cry for "active dialogue" and open
discussion. Yes, that's the way but I
thought active dialogue involves re
sponding to the other side's arguments
and addressing them, rather than re
peating the same thing over and over
regardless of what the proponents of
the other side say. This is what I see
happening with the accusations of
"racism" and "libel" thrown around by
the opponents of Campustruth.org
ads: Despite numerous rebuttals of
these charges in multiple letters to the
editor, the anti-ad authors keep saying
the same thing over again, in hopes
that by repeating the word "racism"
enough they'll convince the audience.
I also heard a lot of "if only" argu
ments: If only Israel returned to the
pre-1967 borders; if only Israel would
lift closures on Palestinian villages;
then all would be well and there will
be peace of our times. Well, at one
point Israel was at its pre-1967 bor
ders but there was no peace and if it
were not for the Israeli pre-emptive
strike in the Six-Day War, there
probably would be no Israel today.
Closures on Palestinian towns are not
always in place, so why no peace at
that time? What reason is there to be
lieve that when "if only" arguments
were satisfied there will be peace?
The children under Palestinian
Authority are brought up in the cli
mate of hate promoted by the Arab
media, and until that continues there
will be no peace. While martyrdom is
glorified and the Israelis / Jews /
Americans demonized, no Israeli
concessions and attempts at talks will
be successful. After all, when the
scapegoat for all the problems is
gone, the Palestinians may take a
closer look at the corruption in then
own leadership that squanders the re
lief money and uses the misery of its

people to promote its political goals.
Junior Ziyad Jabaji wrote that all
Arabs are often viewed as terrorists
by the American public, and I think
that indeed this does happen and it is
wrong. I also think that if more Arab
citizens and Arab leaders around the
world denounced terrorist attacks
on civilians openly and loudly, it
would greatly help to combat this er
roneous perception.

Sustainable development
Op-Ed misses the mark

Is this the way sustainable devel
opment is understood and translated?
I was quite shocked when reading the
article on sustainable development
("The essence of sustainable develop
ment," Nov. 6). The authors present
ed a reductive and outdated defini
tion of sustainable development and
bring critics that are ill founded.
Yes, the definition of sustainable
development is rather evasive (de
velopment that meets the needs of
the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs). But one
should be careful not to translate it
in a narrow and purely economic
function involving "maximizing"
and "results." That's misinterpret
ing and misrepresenting what the
concept is about.
Sustainable development is first of
all not an end, but a process. There
fore, the definition does not offer tools
("guidance") because it is not some
thing you can reach or attain. It is
more an ideology one should strive
for. It is not about avoiding but rather
about providing a direction. The eva
siveness of the definition of sustain
able development is not a shortcom
ing but a necessary quality for allow
ing development and change. Because
the concept of sustainable develop
ment deals with uncertainties, it is im

portant not to narrow it down to a
couple of indicators, which would be
outdated and meaningless after a
short while, but to leave it open in
order to allow it to evolve over time.
Anderson and Huggins argue
that sustainable development goes
against economic growth. No, it is
not. It only warns about irresponsi
ble and short-term growth. That's
quite different.
I almost had to laugh when reading:
"They [those who advocate sustainable
development] call for more govern
ment regulation to stop this growth."
Then I thought: "No, they just want to
provoke reactions; they don't think
what they write." But who knows.
For me, the essence of sustain
ability is about questioning what we
do and the way we do it and empha
sizing that our today's actions have
repercussions in the future.
I sincerely hope that the newspa
per will publish in the near future a
following article presenting another
view on sustainable development.
Authors of the article have omitted
crucial aspects of the concept of sus
tainable development that would be
only fair to mention.

Grad students prefer easy access

In regards to the photograph ac
companying The Daily's article on the
new housing structure ("New grad
dorm may house 700," Nov. 13), Stan
ford officials should be applauded on
considering such a radical design for
graduate housing, in which one build
ing will lean precipitously towards what
appears to be Meyer Library. Perhaps
this is to encourage lagging doctoral
students to leave their rooms or to pro
vide easy access to Moonbeams from
the upper floors?
