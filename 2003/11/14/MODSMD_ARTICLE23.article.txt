# THE
						WORLD ACCORDING TO DANIEL
## Cheating is a bad thing... anytime 
### 
You can't miss it. Printed on
the back of every Universi
ty blue test booklet is a copy
of the school's prided
Honor Code. Even before starting at
Stanford, my half-Italian, half-Argen
tinean tour guide boasted of tests
without proctors and an atmosphere
of trust and respect in the exam room.
Cheating does occur, and the Honor
Code might make it easier for those
few who cheat, but all students enjoy
the everyday freedom and faith of the
system. And on the whole, the system
works here.
Similarly, international law de
pends upon the honorable behavior of
states. There is no world army, and
many world courts require the con
demned to accept their jurisdiction.
Instead of relying on rulings that re
quire the consent of those prosecuted
and a global military force that doesn't
exist, states have come to rely on a sys
tem of mutual trust, much like our
Honor Code. Some bending of the
rules is tolerated if the others are in
vested in the status quo and want it to
continue. But eventually, too much
abuse can put the entire system in
jeopardy.
The United States is only slowly
beginning to realize the cost of its re
cent moves. In Iraq, increasing expen
ditures and soldiers returning in flag
wrapped coffins make international
consensus and the aid that accompa
nies it seem ever more important than
before.

On Monday, the World Trade Or
ganization court found the United
States guilty of employing illegal barri

ers to trade due to
the tariffs created
to protect the po
litically salient
Pittsburgh steel in
dustry. The unsur
prising judgment
(it was an appeals
case) upheld a $2
billion award to
the European
Union payable in

retaliatory tariffs. The E.U. has
promised to target its reprisal mea
sures at vital electoral segments like
Florida's orange growers and textile
producers in the South. The United
States has not indicated whether it in
tends to accept the W.T.O. decision.
But some things have already been
decided. Accompanying the W.T.O.
decision in the headlines, internation
al observers recently confirmed that
Iran's nuclear program is progressing
rapidly. Unlike North Korea, oil-rich
Iran insists it use the nuclear technolo
gy for energy. North Korea uses a
more direct vernacular, but the mes
sage is the same: deterrence.
Suddenly, $2 billion doesn't seem
so expensive.
Perhaps Iran and North Korea
have reason to fear. Branded as mem
bers of the the "axis of evil" in Presi
dent George W. Bush's 2001 State of
the Union address and knowing the

fate of the third member of that infa
mous club (Iraq), Iran and North
Korea are certain of one thing: They
are potential targets. What they can't
be sure about is how restrained the
United States will be.
While it helped write most of the
international agreements that now
regulate relations between countries,
the United States has recently
proven frustrated with such self-im
posed restraints. Even if American
officials believe they are doing the
right thing by going their own way,
the United States compromises the
trust and predictability of the system
by acting so. The remainder of the
axis of evil, feeling that they can't let
their fate be decided by the "new
sheriff in town," has taken matters
into their own hands. It may seem a
stretch from illegal tariffs to nuclear
deterrence, but U.S. military action
in Iraq bridges that gap.
Cheating is inevitable, whether in
the international system or at Stan
ford. The system can tolerate a certain
amount, and the line to cross is often
blurry. But that line is reached, turn
ing back is extremely difficult. Even
the cheaters especially the
cheaters don't want a system
where everyone cheats. It turns out
that with these codes, there's more at
stake than just honor.
