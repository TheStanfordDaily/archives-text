## For Julie, the quitting just keeps going 
### 
One-time quitters are like one-time veg
etarians. It's an insult, really. Do you
feel better about supporting animal
slaughter because you went vegan for a
month? Somehow more authentic?
Side note, I'm not a vegetarian. I'm a pro
gressive vegetarian. I cut things out slowly one
by one and I don't look back. Like cows, and
pigs. P.S. Foie gras involves force-feeding ducks
so their livers can swell over 500 percent in two
weeks. Mmmm.
Real quitters don't just quit once. Quitting is
a way of life.
One-time quitters give the rest of us a bad
name.
That one quitting incident sticks out for them
like a drowning fat lady in a sea of otherwise suc
cessful and persevering enterprises. Maybe they
quit because they got burned out. Found their
ex-girlfriend shacking up with their best friend
the shortstop and couldn't take it. Got over-com
mitted and "something had to go." They aren't

real quitters. They actually re
gret quitting. On some deep,
secret level, they feel guilty for
jumping ship and very, very
ashamed.
I mean really bad, guys.
That's the difference be
tween manning your own ship
and serving crew on someone
else's. Real quitters run their
own ships.
The first time I ever quit,

after my pre-pubescent running career, was so
exhilarating that I have never stopped. I went on
to join three softball teams (school, league and a
traveling team) and felt less guilty for abandon
ing quarter-mile sprints and sK's from hell. And
I have never run one since.
But then, your junior high team doesn't even
have the right bats and the outfielders don't even
have gloves. League play ends after months of
team mothers cooking nachos and harmonized
"2-4-6-8, who do we appreciate!" cheers. Oh,
and don't forget the gnarly orange slices. Either
you eat the whole thing grossed out or you just
suck out the juice and feel lame.
My club team, however, played to a different
cheer. As the lone 14-year-old on a 16-and-under
(read: 17, 18) team, I just didn't blend. They
cheered, "Tight like a virgin, nothing gets
through!" while I reminisced about my third
grade crush on Doug Rose. Once he spit hotdog
leftovers on my desk so I wouldn't touch it. I was
so enamored.
What can you do? You have a bad game, ev
eryone wants this junior high nerd off the team.
If you hit the game-winning two-run triple, dom
inate center field and bat first, they hate you.
Only one girl liked me, Kat, and I think she was
a lesbian anyway.
So I quit again. Routine quitters realize that
they have more to offer themselves than any pre
set organization does. One-time quitters cling on
to teams, clubs and e-mail lists like they're
Leonardo DiCaprio in "Titanic." Weak!
There's really no functional reason not to
quit. We Stanford kids get so caught up in being
good at something that we put faith in our activ
ities instead of ourselves. You can be good at
anything!
My freshman roommate Leslie walked on to
the track team. Practices sucked, day four of
school she got hit by a car and in no time she
found the rugby team and replaced her car in
juries with real ones. With absolutely no rugby
experience, she rocked the field, and I got to see
what new thing was broken each week.
Rugby is hard. Any female (like me) who has
found herself jealous this football season, watch
ing these guys get popular and get girls tackling
each other, should try rugby. Tackle all you want
with no pads, in the mud with a bunch of big girls.
You can't beat it.
The best thing about quitting softball was
growing out my nails. There, I said it. Plus I got
to go on and play suicidal actresses, Jewish plant
shopkeepers and what have you in a whole host
of school plays.
I used to actually lose sleep over deciding
whether I should play soccer or basketball dur
ing winter high school season. Ditch them both,
I did acting instead. Then after such an invest
ment in acting, I quit all that and started ballet at
Stanford.
I am a real quitter. Anyone who joins a ballet
class teeming with post-professional ballerinas,
without knowing what the hell a pliet is, has ob
viously quit a lot. Ballet is great, guys. Possibly
harder than any race I have ran, and exponen
tially more beautiful. Guys, before you think bal
let is gay, try to lift up your leg to your head with
out bending your back or opening up your hips.
Not so Rambo anymore, are you?
Real quitters are constantly doing new things
and learning about themselves. It's completely
selfish and completely rewarding, but in a few
years (or weeks) no one will care what team you
played on at Stanford or what place you came in
for the second grade 50-yard dash. (I came in sec
ond of two after trying to get my best friend to
cheat and tie with me, so I could surprise her and
win. She won.) And you shouldn't care either.
Non-quitters who really should have: Ameri
cans in Vietnam, the Bush dynasty, Siegfried and
Roy, Bette Midler, Vlade Divac.
