Last night in Los Angeles, the Bruins had the opportunity to
turn the tables on the Cardinal. In a battle between the No. 7 and
No. 8 teams in the country Stanford and UCLA, respective
lyâ€” Stanford went .up two games to zero and then lost game
three. In game four, however, UCLA could not complete the
comeback and history was not repeated as Stanford won game
four with relative ease 30-17. Stanford is now 19-5 overall and 12-
3 in the Pac-10.
The win lifted Stanford to a one and a half game lead in the

Pacific 10 Conference
over UCLA and Cal
ifornia. Moreover,
the victory gives the
Cardinal some much
needed momentum

heading into tomorrow night's match against the USC Trojans,

the Bruins was at the net as Stanford outblocked UCLA 21-6
and outhit the Bruins .284-.131.
Five different Cardinal players ended the match with eight

hitter Ogonna Nnamani who had 26 kills and only three errors
for a .343 hitting percentage. Senior middle blocker Jennifer
Harvey had 10 kills with nine blocks while freshman Kristin
Richards had nine kills and 17 defensive digs.
"We were able to set up really well on defense," said senior
middle blocker Sara Dukes who was named player of the game
with seven kills. "It's a guessing game, but we did a really good
job scouting the other team and we definitely had a strategy
tonight."
The Cardinal started the match strong, taking an early lead
in game one a feat that has been the Achilles' heel for the
team this season. The Cardinal increased its lead to 11 at 23-12
and would not slow down, winning the game 30-17.

game drew even at four's, five's, six's, seven's, eight's, nine's, 10's
and ll's before UCLA was finally able to notch two straight
