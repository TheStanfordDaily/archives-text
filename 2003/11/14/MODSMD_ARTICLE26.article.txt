### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team (16-3, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) embarks on its last pair of
away games for the season this weekend
when it faces No. 7 UC-Irvine (11-3, 3-4
MPSF) and No. 8 Long Beach State (14-

11,3-4 MPSF). The Car

dinal moved up a spot im
the national rankings!
last weekend after victo-'
ries over No. 13 Pacific
and No. 3 California.

The two upcoming games down south
and the Big Splash against Cal, which is
played the morning of Big Game, will
complete the Cardinal's league schedule
before the MPSF tournament.
The Cardinal has an eight-game win
ning streak and is looking to extend that
streak into double digits. Stanford is ex
pected to find itself second in the rankings
going into the league tournament.
"You're always worried about your
league opponents," said junior two-meter
Greg Crum. "They're always really good
teams and everybody steps up to play
against Stanford."
Neither Irvine nor Long Beach has
faced Stanford this year, but both have
played well against strong opponents dur
ing the season.
"The games are not going to be easy by
any means," said senior utility Mike

Stanford's performance has been
steadily improving throughout the season
and the team has gained experienced play
ing with one another and has tightened up
its defensive game.
"I think were doing great," Crum said.
"I'm really happy with the way we're play
ing, but we can always play better, obvi-

ously."
A powerhouse
on offense, Stanford
must continue to deliv
er a complete game on

both ends of the pool if it is to make it to
the NCAA finals in December.
"We took a little while figuring out
what kind of defense would be best and
we've finally figured it out," Crum said.
"We try to be a suffocating, pressing kind
of defense instead of a zone. We like to go
man-to-man."
"We're pressing out a lot more on other
teams," Derse added. "Really, that's our
type of game. We have a lot of quick play
ers. We're not a team that wants to drop
back anymore. We're going to press and
make other teams try to deal with that."
Stanford turned in a strong perfor
mance against Cal last Sunday, coming
back from a three-point deficit at the half
to beat the Bears 10-8 in Berkeley. It was a
promising sign that the Cardinal may be
ready to take on Southern California for
