The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team (16-3, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) embarks on its last pair of
away games for the season this weekend
when it faces No. 7 UC-Irvine (11-3, 3-4
MPSF) and No. 8 Long Beach State (14-

11,3-4 MPSF). The Car

last weekend after victo-'
ries over No. 13 Pacific
and No. 3 California.

The two upcoming games down south
and the Big Splash against Cal, which is
played the morning of Big Game, will
complete the Cardinal's league schedule
before the MPSF tournament.
The Cardinal has an eight-game win
ning streak and is looking to extend that
streak into double digits. Stanford is ex
pected to find itself second in the rankings
going into the league tournament.
"You're always worried about your
league opponents," said junior two-meter
Greg Crum. "They're always really good
teams and everybody steps up to play
against Stanford."
Neither Irvine nor Long Beach has
faced Stanford this year, but both have
played well against strong opponents dur
ing the season.
"The games are not going to be easy by
any means," said senior utility Mike

Stanford's performance has been
steadily improving throughout the season
and the team has gained experienced play

its defensive game.
"I think were doing great," Crum said.

must continue to deliv

both ends of the pool if it is to make it to
the NCAA finals in December.
"We took a little while figuring out
what kind of defense would be best and
we've finally figured it out," Crum said.
"We try to be a suffocating, pressing kind
of defense instead of a zone. We like to go
man-to-man."
"We're pressing out a lot more on other
teams," Derse added. "Really, that's our
type of game. We have a lot of quick play
ers. We're not a team that wants to drop
back anymore. We're going to press and
make other teams try to deal with that."

the MPSF Championship.
Saturday afternoon's game will
be the final home game of the season
for UC-Irvine. The Anteaters split a
pair of MPSF games last weekend
with a 10-7 loss to No. 4 UCLA on
Saturday and an 8-7 victory over No.
5 Pepperdine on Sunday.
The Anteaters have several high
scoring players on the squad. Junior
Dan Noon leads the team in scoring
with 57 goals and senior Phil Garcia
has 52 goals for the season.
The Cardinal, in contrast, has a

much more even scoring distribution
among its players. Junior driver Tony
Azevedo leads the pack with 63 goals
for the season, but sophomores
Thomas Hopkins (37) and Peter
Varellas (32), Crum (24) and Derse
(22) all routinely make contributions
to Stanford's final game totals.
Long Beach State is coming off of
a pair of league losses last weekend.
The 49ers were narrowly defeated
by Pepperdine 12-11 and lost at
home 12-7 to UCLA. Their match
against Stanford will be their final
MPSF game of the season.
The Cardinal has come away
with victories its past five games
with the 49ers. Long Beach State has
not defeated Stanford since the 2000
season.

Junior Erik Geoffroy leads the
49ers in scoring with 59 goals, and a
tally of 131 goals in his career at
Long Beach. Freshman Reid
Tomassi is the squad's second lead
ing scorer with 40 goals.
The Cardinal's greatest strength
this season has been its ability to
maintain a dominating presence in
the pool. This, coupled with a good
defense and growing stamina,
should allow the team a berth in the
college championships hosted by
Stanford on Dec. 6-7.
The Cardinal will be in Irvine
to face off with the Anteaters on
Saturday before traveling to Long
Beach to play the 49ers on Sun
day. Both matches are scheduled
for noon.

Stanford's performance has been
steadily improving throughout the season
and the team has gained experienced play

its defensive game.
"I think were doing great," Crum said.
"I'm really happy with the way we're play
ing, but we can always play better, obvi-

ously."
A powerhouse
on offense, Stanford
must continue to deliv
er a complete game on

both ends of the pool if it is to make it to
the NCAA finals in December.
"We took a little while figuring out
what kind of defense would be best and
we've finally figured it out," Crum said.
"We try to be a suffocating, pressing kind
of defense instead of a zone. We like to go
man-to-man."
"We're pressing out a lot more on other
teams," Derse added. "Really, that's our
type of game. We have a lot of quick play
ers. We're not a team that wants to drop
back anymore. We're going to press and
make other teams try to deal with that."

the MPSF Championship.
Saturday afternoon's game will
be the final home game of the season
for UC-Irvine. The Anteaters split a
pair of MPSF games last weekend
with a 10-7 loss to No. 4 UCLA on
Saturday and an 8-7 victory over No.
5 Pepperdine on Sunday.
The Anteaters have several high
scoring players on the squad. Junior
Dan Noon leads the team in scoring
with 57 goals and senior Phil Garcia
has 52 goals for the season.
The Cardinal, in contrast, has a

much more even scoring distribution
among its players. Junior driver Tony
Azevedo leads the pack with 63 goals
for the season, but sophomores
Thomas Hopkins (37) and Peter
Varellas (32), Crum (24) and Derse
(22) all routinely make contributions
to Stanford's final game totals.
Long Beach State is coming off of
a pair of league losses last weekend.
The 49ers were narrowly defeated
by Pepperdine 12-11 and lost at
home 12-7 to UCLA. Their match
against Stanford will be their final
MPSF game of the season.
The Cardinal has come away
with victories its past five games
with the 49ers. Long Beach State has
not defeated Stanford since the 2000
season.

Junior Erik Geoffroy leads the
49ers in scoring with 59 goals, and a
tally of 131 goals in his career at
Long Beach. Freshman Reid
Tomassi is the squad's second lead
ing scorer with 40 goals.
The Cardinal's greatest strength
this season has been its ability to
maintain a dominating presence in
the pool. This, coupled with a good
defense and growing stamina,
should allow the team a berth in the
college championships hosted by
Stanford on Dec. 6-7.
The Cardinal will be in Irvine
to face off with the Anteaters on
Saturday before traveling to Long
Beach to play the 49ers on Sun
day. Both matches are scheduled
for noon.
