# Men to tip off season in exhibition
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Whatever the outcome, Sunday will
definitely be a win-win situation for

Nike.
As the No. 19 Stanford men's basket
ball team opens up its 2003-04 campaign
against visiting Team Nike, all that's
guaranteed is that someone wearing the
swoosh will end up victorious.
Interestingly enough, Team Nike (2-
4) is pretty well battle-tested at this

point. The club has already faced many
of the nation's top teams including
preseason ranked opponents No. 1 Con
necticut, defending NCAA National
Champion No. 7 Syracuse, 2003 Final
Four participant No. 23 Marquette and
No. 3 Michigan State.
Of course, Nike lost all four of those
games, with its biggest defeat coming at
the hands of University of Connecticut
in a 96-78 loss on Nov. 3.
The Nike club, which boasts former
Kansas guard Jeff Boschee, dropped a
respectable 12-point decision to Syra
cuse, lost by only nine to Marquette and
fell to the Spartans in a close 85-81
matchup last night in East Lansing,
Mich.

Nike has already registered wins over
Penn State and Patriot League con
tender Lehigh.
But for the Cardinal, its first and only
exhibition game will be the only oppor
tunity it has to iron out all the kinks be
fore the official season begins against
unranked Sacramento State on Nov. 22.
"I think we might come out a little bit
anxious just because we haven't played a
real game since the one we lost in the
[NCAA] tournament [last season]," said
junior center Rob Little. "But we want
to come out and play solid defense, be
efficient on offense and not turn the ball
over."
Tipoff is set for 5 p.m. on Sunday and
the game can be heard on KZSU 90.1

FM.
Chris Hernandez returns to lineup
The re-addition of point guard Chris
Hernandez should go a long way toward
recreating the team chemistry of last
season's team that is, if the redshirt
sophomore can manage to stay healthy
for the duration of the year. After bat
tling through an injury-laden "sopho
more" campaign Hernandez broke
his left foot twice last season before re
ceiving a medical redshirt from the
NCAA the once-again sophomore
has been forced to take it easy during practices be
cause of a nagging back injury that has kept the coach
ing staff on alert. While the lightened practice sched
ule is mostly a preventative measure, Hernandez's
back shouldn't affect his availability on Sunday.

Stanford fans should get the opportunity to ob
serve the newest additions to the Cardinal lineup in
the team's exhibition games. Freshmen guard Tim
Morris and forward Fred Washington will both expe
rience their first games in front of the Cardinal faith
ful on Sunday.
Stanford signs two recruits on
first day of the early signing period
In other news, Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery announced the signing of two high school se
niors to national letters of intent. The Cardinal ac
quired 6-foot-10, 245-pound center Peter Prowitt out
of McLean, Va., and 6-foot-8,195-pound forward Taj
Finger from Bedford, N.Y.
"We identified Peter early in the recruiting process
as someone who could help us tremendously along the
frontline," Montgomery said in a statement. "Peter
has a huge upside, and is an extremely competitive
player. He will thrive in the Stanford system. Taj had
a great summer and jumped to the top of our recruit
ing list. He is a skilled power forward, who can also
play the three. We are extremely excited about the
contributions Peter and Taj will make in the Stanford
program."
