# Men face Cal in final game
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
On Wednesday afternoons, the
under-11 Strikers — a local club soc
cer team — practices its moves on the
Stanford intramural fields. This
Wednesday, the boys noticed the Car
dinal men practicing and stopped to
watch, nudging each other excitedly
and whispering things like, "That's the
goalie. I saw him jump 10 feet in the air
this one time" or "Whoa, can we go
play with them?"

It was a lucky day for the Strikers,
who were immediately invited by
Stanford head coach Bret Simon to do
cool-down stretches with the team.
The two teams merged, introduced
themselves to one another and talked
soccer while they worked.
The exchange seemed to epitomize
the positive outlook and pride of the
Stanford soccer squad.
"It's crazy [because] this has been
the worst year ever, and people still
look up to [us]," said junior forward
Darren Fernandez. "[To the kids], it
doesn't matter how well you do, it's just
that you're out there doing it, doing
something that they would like to."
The two teams formed a huddle
and after a yell of the word "Strikers!"
the Cardinal (3-14-2, 0-9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) went back to business,
preparing for its final game a home
field matchup with California (9-8-2,
4-4-1 Pac-10) that will be its last chance
to find a Pac-10 win.
Saturday's game will also be senior
co-captains' Mike Wilson and Abe

vs. California. Saturday, 7 p.m.

Geiger's final game in a Stanford jer
sey. Geiger, the anchor of the Cardinal
defense and a three-year captain, will
be starting in his 66th consecutive
game. Wilson, who has been a force in
the midfield both for Stanford and the
New Zealand national team, will un
fortunately miss his final contest as a
result of a yellow card that he received
last week against San Jose State.
Simon said that Stanford would
likely put in just a little bit of extra ef
fort on Saturday in hopes of giving the
two leaders a nice going-away present.
"[Geiger and Wilson] are ideal cap
tains," Simon said. "They are gentle
men off the field and competitors on it
... and any success that we have in the
next couple of years will be in part be
cause of die work that they have done."
While the Cardinal will be pro
pelled by pride and a desire to send off
its captains with a victory, the Golden
Bears have just as strong motivations
to win the match.
With a near-even record overall
and in conference action, the Bears'
berth to the NCAA tournament hangs
in the balance, making this last game
crucial to its postseason hopes. A win
over Stanford which would give
Cal a "W" in each of its final three
games could likely ensure the
Bears a spot among the 48 teams that
will battle for a trip to the College Cup
in Columbus, Ohio next month.
The Cardinal last met Cal in Berke
ley in early October, and the contest
ended in a 3-1 Stanford loss.
"We gave that game away," Simon
said. "They do have quick attacking
players, but when you let them get
chances, that's when those players are
dangerous."
The Cardinal defense has been

pounded by injury in recent weeks, but
junior Robby Fulton should return in
goal this weekend and junior defender
Aaron Maines will also find himself
back in the starting lineup. Despite
these comebacks, the defense is still
not in ideal shape and Simon said that
spectators should expect to see a dif
ferent organization protecting the
Stanford goal.
The Cardinal will be hoping for re
peat performances from junior for
ward Matt Janusz and Fernandez, both
of whom are coming off a huge game in
San Jose. Janusz racked up two goals
and an assist in the matchup, and co-led
the squad with four shots on the after
noon. Fernandez had a hand in four of
Stanford's five goals with one goal and
three assists. The two forwards, who
rank first and second in points for the
Cardinal Janusz has 12, Fernandez
has 11 have been tough to stop in re
cent games, despite the absence of a
third key junior forward, James Twell
man, who is out for the season with a
knee injury.
Cal is also coming off a win over San
Jose State, a 2-1 overtime game that
marked the squad's final home contest.
Fernandez said that while expecta
tions for the Bears are high, the Cardi
nal would prove a force to be reckoned
with in its final game of the season.
"We're the underdogs in every
game," he said. "But there's no use
getting frustrated anymore."
Simon added that the fact that
Stanford will not see postseason play is
not a reason to stop playing to win.
"We're going to [play like it is] our
national championship," Simon said.
Kickoff for the final Cardinal men's
soccer game of the season is set for 7
p.m. on Saturday at Maloney Field.

dinal men practicing and stopped to
watch, nudging each other excitedly
and whispering things like, "That's the
goalie. I saw him jump 10 feet in the air
this one time" or "Whoa, can we go
play with them?"

It was a lucky day for the Strikers,
who were immediately invited by
Stanford head coach Bret Simon to do
cool-down stretches with the team.
The two teams merged, introduced
themselves to one another and talked
soccer while they worked.
The exchange seemed to epitomize
the positive outlook and pride of the
Stanford soccer squad.
"It's crazy [because] this has been
the worst year ever, and people still
look up to [us]," said junior forward
Darren Fernandez. "[To the kids], it
doesn't matter how well you do, it's just
that you're out there doing it, doing
something that they would like to."
The two teams formed a huddle
and after a yell of the word "Strikers!"
the Cardinal (3-14-2, 0-9-0 Pacific 10
Conference) went back to business,
preparing for its final game a home
field matchup with California (9-8-2,
4-4-1 Pac-10) that will be its last chance
to find a Pac-10 win.
Saturday's game will also be senior
co-captains' Mike Wilson and Abe

Men's Soccer

vs. California. Saturday, 7 p.m.

Geiger's final game in a Stanford jer
sey. Geiger, the anchor of the Cardinal
defense and a three-year captain, will
be starting in his 66th consecutive
game. Wilson, who has been a force in
the midfield both for Stanford and the
New Zealand national team, will un
fortunately miss his final contest as a
result of a yellow card that he received
last week against San Jose State.
Simon said that Stanford would
likely put in just a little bit of extra ef
fort on Saturday in hopes of giving the
two leaders a nice going-away present.
"[Geiger and Wilson] are ideal cap
tains," Simon said. "They are gentle
men off the field and competitors on it
... and any success that we have in the
next couple of years will be in part be
cause of die work that they have done."
While the Cardinal will be pro
pelled by pride and a desire to send off
its captains with a victory, the Golden
Bears have just as strong motivations
to win the match.
With a near-even record overall
and in conference action, the Bears'
berth to the NCAA tournament hangs
in the balance, making this last game
crucial to its postseason hopes. A win
over Stanford which would give
Cal a "W" in each of its final three
games could likely ensure the
Bears a spot among the 48 teams that
will battle for a trip to the College Cup
in Columbus, Ohio next month.
The Cardinal last met Cal in Berke
ley in early October, and the contest
ended in a 3-1 Stanford loss.
"We gave that game away," Simon
said. "They do have quick attacking
players, but when you let them get
chances, that's when those players are
dangerous."
The Cardinal defense has been

pounded by injury in recent weeks, but
junior Robby Fulton should return in
goal this weekend and junior defender
Aaron Maines will also find himself
back in the starting lineup. Despite
these comebacks, the defense is still
not in ideal shape and Simon said that
spectators should expect to see a dif
ferent organization protecting the
Stanford goal.
The Cardinal will be hoping for re
peat performances from junior for
ward Matt Janusz and Fernandez, both
of whom are coming off a huge game in
San Jose. Janusz racked up two goals
and an assist in the matchup, and co-led
the squad with four shots on the after
noon. Fernandez had a hand in four of
Stanford's five goals with one goal and
three assists. The two forwards, who
rank first and second in points for the
Cardinal Janusz has 12, Fernandez
has 11 have been tough to stop in re
cent games, despite the absence of a
third key junior forward, James Twell
man, who is out for the season with a
knee injury.
Cal is also coming off a win over San
Jose State, a 2-1 overtime game that
marked the squad's final home contest.
Fernandez said that while expecta
tions for the Bears are high, the Cardi
nal would prove a force to be reckoned
with in its final game of the season.
"We're the underdogs in every
game," he said. "But there's no use
getting frustrated anymore."
Simon added that the fact that
Stanford will not see postseason play is
not a reason to stop playing to win.
"We're going to [play like it is] our
national championship," Simon said.
Kickoff for the final Cardinal men's
soccer game of the season is set for 7
p.m. on Saturday at Maloney Field.
