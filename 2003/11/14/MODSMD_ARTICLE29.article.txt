"When we had our rotation in
the game, we were getting on the
boards better [than in the first
game] and I thought we were
playing fairly well defensively, es
pecially in the first half," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
Stanford rode the strong play
of freshman center Kristin Newlin
and junior guard Kelley Sumins
ki.
Newlin notched her first colle
giate double-double, tallying 18
points and 11 boards on 7-for-9
shooting. Suminski scored a game
high 24 points and added four as
sists.
"Kristin really stepped up big,"
said VanDerveer. "Those are good,
physical post players. Tausha Mills
played in the WNBA. I was really
excited by how well she did."
Tonight's game marked the sec
ond straight solid performance
from Newlin she recorded nine
points and seven rebounds in her
debut.
Newlin and VanDerveer credit
ed Newlin's impressive showing to
intense workouts with her Cardinal
teammates.
"Nothing prepares me more
than practice because I'm going
against great players and that just
prepares me the best... I realized
[that my opponents] aren't as good
as what I'm playing against [in

practice everyday]."
The freshman showed a stellar
all-around game. On defense, she
forced players to change their shots
and on offense, she managed to get
herself to the line where she went 4-
for-7 on the evening.
Newlin's play has made her a
probable candidate to start in the
post while junior forwards T'Nae
Thiel and Azella Perryman are out
with injuries.
On the offensive side of the
floor, the Cardinal wasn't running
its standard offense, but players in
stead responded to events as they
occurred, creating a more sponta
neous style of play.
"There was a good combination
of individual scoring," said Van-
Deerveer. "We saw so many oppor
tunities for people to create for
themselves. That's what [the de
fense] was giving you, so you didn't
really see the assists."
Suminski, the team's leading
scorer, shot the lights out, going 8-
for-12 from the field and putting on
a clinic from three-point land,
shooting 4-for-6.
Junior guard Sebnem Kimya
cioglu also turned in a strong offen
sive performance. She proved she is
more than just a three-point special
ist, showing several drives to the
hoop. She capped her second half
scoring run with a flashy three-point
play.
However, Stanford's offense
was far from perfect. It faced a full
court press for the first time, which
forced numerous Cardinal
turnovers.
"Coach has prepared us for the
full-court press," Suminski said.
"We were expecting it, but we did
[turn the ball over]. It's some
thing we need to focus on and
work on a little bit more."
While Stanford came away
with only a six-point margin of
victory, it dominated the game
while its stronger players were in.
With 15:37 to go in the second half
the Cardinal had a commanding
30 point lead.
VanDerveer was not going to
tempt fate as she gave the entire
bench time on the court.
"I'm not going to risk [another

injury]. I just had visions of
Michael Vick," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal is already with
out Thiel, Perryman, senior guard
Katie Denny and freshman for
ward Eziamaka Okafor.
The four have one week before
the regular season starts to get
healthy, but returns to the floor

are unlikely.
VanDerveer has hopes that
Denny and Perryman will be able
to make appearances by the
fourth or fifth game of the regular
season.
Regular season action starts on
Nov. 21 with a road game against
Pepperdine.
