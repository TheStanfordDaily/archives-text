# Johnson gets his kicks
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Eric Johnson came to Stanford four years ago as a
walk-on placekicker. Now, in his senior season, he's one of
the top punters in Stanford history —as well as a member
of the Cardinal golf team.
Johnson, whose average of 43.3 yards per punt ranks
24th nationally, is on pace to break the school's single-sea
son record for punting yards. His average would rank
third-best in Cardinal history.
Not bad for a guy who didn't even expect to play foot
ball in college.
"When I was in high school, I saw myself down the
road playing collegiate golf," Johnson said. "I played a lot
of junior golf, and I was pretty successful, but then I start
ed kicking my sophomore year [and] a lot of doors opened
for me because of football that weren't so much there for
golf."
Johnson's improved considerably since his freshman
year at Stanford, when he averaged just 34.0 yards as a
fledgling punter.
"When I came in, I was more of a kicker who just hap

pened to punt," he said. "But when I came in, Mike Bisel
li had his all-Pac-10 year and we went to the Rose Bowl, so
I soon realized that if I wanted to get on the field, it would
be through punting."
It wasn't always an easy process for Johnson, who bat
tled inconsistency and drew some criticism for the lack of
distance on many of his punts.
"I remember when I was younger, there'd be days
when I'd go out and punt great and I didn't know why and
there'd be days when I'd come out and kick horrible and
didn't know why," he said. "I think [it has] been a big
source of improvement, just knowing my mechanics and
what I have a tendency to do, so I can fix it."
This year, Johnson has been solid week after week, av
eraging at least 38 yards per punt in every one of the Car
dinal's contests.
"Eric's been fairly consistent throughout the year,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said.
In last week's rainy win over Arizona State, Johnson
sprained his ankle on Stanford's last kickoff—and still
managed to total 111 yards on his last three punts.
