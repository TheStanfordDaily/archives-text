# Johnson gets his kicks
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Eric Johnson came to Stanford four years ago as a
walk-on placekicker. Now, in his senior season, he's one of
the top punters in Stanford history —as well as a member
of the Cardinal golf team.
Johnson, whose average of 43.3 yards per punt ranks
24th nationally, is on pace to break the school's single-sea
son record for punting yards. His average would rank
third-best in Cardinal history.
Not bad for a guy who didn't even expect to play foot
ball in college.
"When I was in high school, I saw myself down the
road playing collegiate golf," Johnson said. "I played a lot
of junior golf, and I was pretty successful, but then I start
ed kicking my sophomore year [and] a lot of doors opened
for me because of football that weren't so much there for
golf."
Johnson's improved considerably since his freshman
year at Stanford, when he averaged just 34.0 yards as a
fledgling punter.
"When I came in, I was more of a kicker who just hap

pened to punt," he said. "But when I came in, Mike Bisel
li had his all-Pac-10 year and we went to the Rose Bowl, so
I soon realized that if I wanted to get on the field, it would
be through punting."
It wasn't always an easy process for Johnson, who bat
tled inconsistency and drew some criticism for the lack of
distance on many of his punts.
"I remember when I was younger, there'd be days
when I'd go out and punt great and I didn't know why and
there'd be days when I'd come out and kick horrible and
didn't know why," he said. "I think [it has] been a big
source of improvement, just knowing my mechanics and
what I have a tendency to do, so I can fix it."
This year, Johnson has been solid week after week, av
eraging at least 38 yards per punt in every one of the Car
dinal's contests.
"Eric's been fairly consistent throughout the year,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said.
In last week's rainy win over Arizona State, Johnson
sprained his ankle on Stanford's last kickoff—and still
managed to total 111 yards on his last three punts.

"That was not so much fun," Johnson
said. "I had to change my form and it re
ally hurt a lot."
Johnson does both punting and kick
offs for the Cardinal, and sprained an
kles aren't the only occupational hazard
he encounters as a result —he has to
maintain two sets of kicking mechanics
without letting them influence each
other.
"Kicking you come across [your
body], in punting everything has to stay
straight," he said. "But I feel like the
kickoffs help me stay loose and stay in
volved in the game, and also sort of
make me more aware of my funda
mentals ... so I think ultimately it helps
you more than it hurts you."
The one thing that Johnson doesn't
do though, is placekick. Although
Johnson has an impressive high school
kicking resume one that includes
field goals of 53,48,47 and 45 yards
he doesn't practice field goals much
anymore, because the mechanics are
too different.
"If I want to be a good punter, I can't
do a lot of [placekicking], because,
probably more so than kickoffs, that
will sort of infiltrate itself into the punt
ing," he said.
In addition to mechanics, Johnson
occasionally has to worry about making
a tackle something that's a difficult
task for many kicking specialists. He
doesn't mind the challenge, though—
he had three tackles last year and has
two more this year.
"I probably get more excited than
nervous because I always feel like I can
run the guy down," Johnson said. "I'm
always like, 'Okay, I'm gonna get you.'
It's sort of a pride thing, because I don't
want anyone taking one back for a
touchdown on me."
Thanks to a strong coverage team,
though, Johnson hasn't had to worry
too much about that this year.
"I'd say they sort of make me who I
am," Johnson said of the punt team.
"When you have a good team that can
protect and cover, it gives you confi
dence. You don't have to worry about
[defenders] rushing so you can go and
put a nice ball down there for them to
cover."
Just as he doesn't want to give up a
touchdown, Johnson doesn't like being

responsible for a touchback. He has
placed 14 of his 58 punts inside the 20-
yard line against just eight touchbacks,
despite the Cardinal's aversion to direc
tional punting schemes.
"The coaches like to put the return
er in a position where they have to
make a decision," Johnson explained.
"I think you have the ability to get it
closer to the goal line when you punt it
straight because you can let it trickle
down in there and have your guys grab
it, whereas if you directional punt, cof
fin comer, where you put it out is where
you get it."
Against UCLA, the strategy paid
dividends, as Johnson's punt bounced
off of UCLA's Matt Cassel and was re
covered by Stanford's Marcus Mc-
Cutcheon, leading to a touchdown in a
game Stanford won by one score.
Teevens certainly appreciated the ef
fort.
"Eric Johnson did a tremendous job
punting the football and hit them a
good distance, an average of 47 yards
with four inside the 20-yard line and
that forces the other team to play a long
field," he said.
Johnson's consistency on the foot
ball field is something he hopes he can
match in his first full season on the golf
course.
"It was something I'd always want
ed to do, to play golf here, and I thought
I might have die game to do it," said
Johnson, whose initial plans to join the
golf team in 2001 were derailed when
former coach Tyrone Willingham left
for Notre Dame and he had to arrange
things anew with current head coach
Buddy Teevens.
"I didn't really get to go out as early
as I would've liked to, but, you know,
better late than never," Johnson said.
While he doesn't know what he'll be
doing this time next year, Johnson does
know what he'd like to be doing.
"I'd love to have an opportunity to
maybe pursue something in the NFL,
but I'm pretty much just going to take
things as they come," he said. "I really
don't know what's going to happen, but
hopefully something good."
He does know, though, what he
would like to be doing for the holidays
this year—play in the Cardinal's first
bowl game in three years.
"I would mean a lot to me as a senior
... we've been through a lot, and we've
started to play the kind of football that
we're capable of," Johnson said. "No
one, no senior, wants to spend their last
Christmas at home. I mean, it's good to
be with the family, but they'll still be
there after the bowls."

kickoffs help me stay loose and stay in
volved in the game, and also sort of
make me more aware of my funda
mentals ... so I think ultimately it helps
you more than it hurts you."
The one thing that Johnson doesn't
do though, is placekick. Although
Johnson has an impressive high school
kicking resume one that includes
field goals of 53,48,47 and 45 yards
he doesn't practice field goals much
anymore, because the mechanics are
too different.
"If I want to be a good punter, I can't
do a lot of [placekicking], because,
probably more so than kickoffs, that
will sort of infiltrate itself into the punt
ing," he said.
In addition to mechanics, Johnson
occasionally has to worry about making
a tackle something that's a difficult
task for many kicking specialists. He
doesn't mind the challenge, though—
he had three tackles last year and has
two more this year.
"I probably get more excited than
nervous because I always feel like I can
run the guy down," Johnson said. "I'm
always like, 'Okay, I'm gonna get you.'
It's sort of a pride thing, because I don't
want anyone taking one back for a
touchdown on me."
Thanks to a strong coverage team,
though, Johnson hasn't had to worry
too much about that this year.
"I'd say they sort of make me who I
am," Johnson said of the punt team.
"When you have a good team that can
protect and cover, it gives you confi
dence. You don't have to worry about
[defenders] rushing so you can go and
put a nice ball down there for them to
cover."
Just as he doesn't want to give up a
touchdown, Johnson doesn't like being

responsible for a touchback. He has
placed 14 of his 58 punts inside the 20-
yard line against just eight touchbacks,
despite the Cardinal's aversion to direc
tional punting schemes.
"The coaches like to put the return
er in a position where they have to
make a decision," Johnson explained.
"I think you have the ability to get it
closer to the goal line when you punt it
straight because you can let it trickle
down in there and have your guys grab
it, whereas if you directional punt, cof
fin comer, where you put it out is where
you get it."
Against UCLA, the strategy paid
dividends, as Johnson's punt bounced
off of UCLA's Matt Cassel and was re
covered by Stanford's Marcus Mc-
Cutcheon, leading to a touchdown in a
game Stanford won by one score.
Teevens certainly appreciated the ef
fort.
"Eric Johnson did a tremendous job
punting the football and hit them a
good distance, an average of 47 yards
with four inside the 20-yard line and
that forces the other team to play a long
field," he said.
Johnson's consistency on the foot
ball field is something he hopes he can
match in his first full season on the golf
course.
"It was something I'd always want
ed to do, to play golf here, and I thought
I might have die game to do it," said
Johnson, whose initial plans to join the
golf team in 2001 were derailed when
former coach Tyrone Willingham left
for Notre Dame and he had to arrange
things anew with current head coach
Buddy Teevens.
"I didn't really get to go out as early
as I would've liked to, but, you know,
better late than never," Johnson said.
While he doesn't know what he'll be
doing this time next year, Johnson does
know what he'd like to be doing.
"I'd love to have an opportunity to
maybe pursue something in the NFL,
but I'm pretty much just going to take
things as they come," he said. "I really
don't know what's going to happen, but
hopefully something good."
He does know, though, what he
would like to be doing for the holidays
this year—play in the Cardinal's first
bowl game in three years.
"I would mean a lot to me as a senior
... we've been through a lot, and we've
started to play the kind of football that
we're capable of," Johnson said. "No
one, no senior, wants to spend their last
Christmas at home. I mean, it's good to
be with the family, but they'll still be
there after the bowls."
Eric Johnson came to Stanford four years ago as a
walk-on placekicker. Now, in his senior season, he's one of
the top punters in Stanford history —as well as a member
of the Cardinal golf team.
Johnson, whose average of 43.3 yards per punt ranks
24th nationally, is on pace to break the school's single-sea
son record for punting yards. His average would rank
third-best in Cardinal history.
Not bad for a guy who didn't even expect to play foot
ball in college.
"When I was in high school, I saw myself down the
road playing collegiate golf," Johnson said. "I played a lot
of junior golf, and I was pretty successful, but then I start
ed kicking my sophomore year [and] a lot of doors opened
for me because of football that weren't so much there for
golf."
Johnson's improved considerably since his freshman
year at Stanford, when he averaged just 34.0 yards as a
fledgling punter.
"When I came in, I was more of a kicker who just hap

pened to punt," he said. "But when I came in, Mike Bisel
li had his all-Pac-10 year and we went to the Rose Bowl, so
I soon realized that if I wanted to get on the field, it would
be through punting."
It wasn't always an easy process for Johnson, who bat
tled inconsistency and drew some criticism for the lack of
distance on many of his punts.
"I remember when I was younger, there'd be days
when I'd go out and punt great and I didn't know why and
there'd be days when I'd come out and kick horrible and
didn't know why," he said. "I think [it has] been a big
source of improvement, just knowing my mechanics and
what I have a tendency to do, so I can fix it."
This year, Johnson has been solid week after week, av
eraging at least 38 yards per punt in every one of the Car
dinal's contests.
"Eric's been fairly consistent throughout the year,"
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said.
In last week's rainy win over Arizona State, Johnson
sprained his ankle on Stanford's last kickoff—and still
managed to total 111 yards on his last three punts.

"That was not so much fun," Johnson
said. "I had to change my form and it re
ally hurt a lot."
Johnson does both punting and kick
offs for the Cardinal, and sprained an
kles aren't the only occupational hazard
he encounters as a result —he has to
maintain two sets of kicking mechanics
without letting them influence each
other.
"Kicking you come across [your
body], in punting everything has to stay
straight," he said. "But I feel like the
kickoffs help me stay loose and stay in
volved in the game, and also sort of
make me more aware of my funda
mentals ... so I think ultimately it helps
you more than it hurts you."
