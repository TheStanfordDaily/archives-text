ELEPHANT
Dir. Gus van Sant
4 stars
The film's subject — a shooting at
a fictional high school in suburban
Oregon is a difficult one to treat
delicately. However, van Sant's film
avoids trampling this territory by al
lowing the camera to roam among
students at an ordinary high school
without notice. The effect is a total de
struction of voyeurism.
Shooters Alex (Alex Frost) and
Eric (Eric Duelen), when they appear,
are treated in the same light touch as
the other characters, yet a sense of
doom builds throughout the movie.
The result is an ever-so-gentle re
minder of your own mortality that will
surely send an unforgettable shiver
down your spine.

THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS
Dir. the Wachowski brothers
2 1 /2 stars
A disappointing final chapter in
the "Matrix" series that lacks more
than soul. Lacking the willpower to
advance the ideas and characteri
zations of the first two films, "Revolu
tions" leaves the viewer alienated at
best.
While the visual splendor of the
first two films is largely missing, it is re
placed with well-done, but hardly
breathtaking CGI "wizardry." The
film's emphasis on computer graph
ics offers a fantastic show of sight
and sound, but when the end of the
picture finally rolls around, it's met
with relief more than revelation.
