# 'Shattered Glass' cuts deep
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
These days, every movie is a schizophrenic
episode for me. Half of me acts just like the rest of
the audience eating popcorn, ogling the stars,
yelling at the girl not to open that door. The other
half the critic half scribbles notes about the
lighting.
Once in a while, though, a movie comes along
that puts this half to sleep. A movie that's so much
fun I forget I'm supposed to be criticizing it. "Shat
tered Glass" is such a movie.
Director Billy Ray's newsroom drama isn't a
tour de force seeing it won't change your life.
It's just a thoroughly pleasing movie, what my fa
ther would call "darn good."
Perhaps its greatest pleasure is watching Hay
den Christensen redeem himself after his dismal
performance in "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones."
As Anakin Skywalker, he made the serious funny
and the funny lame. But as Stephen Glass, hot
young reporter for The New Republic, he com
bines sad-puppy insecurity with the finesse of a con
man.
The result: We're never sure which one he is.
This suits the material perfectly, as "Shattered
Glass" is the true story of a reporter who faked
more than half of his stories in an effort to rise to
the top of his profession. Was this sin more the re
sult of the pressures of national journalism, or of
Glass' personal greed for recognition? It's a ques
tion that has become more important as more re
porting scandals come to light.
"Shattered Glass" quite rightly offers no easy

answers. Instead, we get a com
pelling portrait of the stresses, plea
sures and politics of the newsroom.
It's a place of great loyalty as
Michael Kelly, Hank Azaria plays
an editor and father figure that's im
possible not to love. But it's also a
place of rivalry and resentment.
This resentment heats up when
chairman Marty Peretz (Ted Kotch
eff) replaces Kelly with the less lik
able Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard),
as the new editor. Around the same
time, a couple of reporters at the

Web-based "Forbes Digital Tool" (Steve Zahn and
Rosario Dawson) start questioning Glass' story on
hackers. When Lane takes their allegations serious
ly, his staff accuses him of trying to pick off Kelly loy
alists.
Two mysteries then begin to unravel at once.
One is the hacker story itself, which collapses be
fore our eyes as Lane and the Forbes reporters un
cover he after he. The other is Glass, whose almost
childlike friendliness may be more calculated than
his coworkers suspect. Both mysteries kept my
eyes on the screen and my hands away from my
notes.
It helps that the actors hold themselves to the
same high standards as the journalists they play.
Steve Zahn goes after his scoop with wide-eyed,
crackling energy, while Chloe Sevigny brings a bull
dog tenacity to the role of Glass' friend Caitlin Avey.
And Sarsgaard, with his rueful, lizard-eyed gaze, ac
complishes the delicate balancing act of making us
dislike him and feel for him at the same time.

Despite all of the film's good qualities, my
critic half did awaken to find a few faults. A
frame story in which Glass lectures a class at his
old high school about how to succeed in journal
ism seems unnecessary. The irony here is a bit
heavy-handed, and the beloved teacher Glass
visits is so full of praise she seems like a figment
of his imagination.
It's a surprising lapse, because "Shattered
Glass" otherwise displays admirable restraint. It
doesn't get bogged down with psychoanalyzing
Glass; instead, it leaves us to draw our own conclu
sions about his motivations. Throughout the film,
Glass asks the other characters, "Are you mad at
me?" When it's over, we're left to answer this ques
tion for ourselves.
So "Shattered Glass" isn't a perfect movie, it
may not even be a great movie. But for the half of
me that just enjoys movies, and for all you movie
goers with just one personality to please, darn
good is good enough.


Hey dude, wanna shatter my glasses?
