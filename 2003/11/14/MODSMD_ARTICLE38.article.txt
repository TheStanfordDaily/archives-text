# Crowe: Gladiator of the high seas
## Smooth sailing 
### JOHN HOLGATE 
"Master & Commander" deliv
ers like a broad

side from a 28-
gun frigate. (The
movie inspired
me enough to
make cheesy
puns about it!)
Swooping
through the deck
of a ship which
bustles with the

energy of sailors hard at work, the
camera bursts upon a gorgeous
panorama of the sea. Surrounded
by the boundless ocean, the HMS
Surprise sails crisply through sea,
and the audience gets a special
treat. This movie not only opens up
the world of 19th century seaman
ship, it beckons you inside and
gives you a seat in Captain Jack
Aubrey's quarters (played by Rus
sell Crowe).
By far the most enticing aspect
of the movie is the up-close look at
life on the high seas it offers its au
dience. Director Peter Weir treats
the cramped, lonely lives of the
sailors and the explosive sea bat
tles with equal aplomb. In the
opening shots, dozens of ham
mocks sway eerily like pendulums.

Reminiscent of World War ll's
courageous air warriors, names
are lovingly etched on the sides of

the cannons.
During the
film's tenser
moments, can
nonballs whiz by
without regard
for the ship's
sails or the
men's limbs, as
the sailors strug
gle in desperate

hand-to-hand battle. Believe me,
you don't forget seeing a one
armed 10-year-old in full battle at
tire leaping across from ship to
ship with pistol drawn and firing.
The visual aspects of the movie
certainly deserve the greatest
credit in this movie, but Russell
Crowe's understated acting as
Captain Jack Aubrey brings one
of literature's great warriors to
life. A collation of the two novels
in Patrick O'Brian's books about
Jack Aubrey and Stephen Ma
turim, the film does justice to the
spirit of the literature. This movie
perfectly captures adventure on
the high seas without forgetting
the men who made the stories we
so eagerly watch.
