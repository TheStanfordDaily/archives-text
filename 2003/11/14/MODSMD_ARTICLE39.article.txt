"We've gone to great lengths for
historical authenticity ... and used
mathematical formulas to determine

Leon Poindexter, technical and
historical consultant.
Therein lies the essence to the con
temptibility of "Master and Comman
der." Shoddy work is allowed to be
bad. What makes this movie absolute
ly horrifying is that you are watching

someining wun so
much potential fall
flat on its face. The
movie has all the
right ingredients
a mostly stellar cast
and crew, a screen
play based on pow
erful writing, stun
ning cinematogra
phy and rich histor
ical detail. And yet,
a trashy romance
novel delivers
more inspiring
emotional rhetoric.
What went wrong?

I blame Russell Crowe.
You thought Anthony Hopkins
playing an African-American in "The
Human Stain" is the greatest piece of

miscasting of the year? Be ready to eat
Crowe then, because the casting direc
tors couldn't have done much worse.
The only emotion Crowe displays is a
barely suppressed smirk which is suc
cessful in turning even the most moving
dialogue into corny hogwash. Crowe
fails to be transformed under the skin of
the character. And let me tell you, a
pompous ass whose favorite past-time
is "brawling-in-bars" is not always the
best man to play a father figure, true
friend and war-hero. If I weren't too
busy being sick to my stomach after

watching an Oscar
winner single-hand
edly destroy an en
tire movie, I would
be amused at noting
that Russell Crowe's
tragic flaw is that he is
just too Russell
Crowe.
In all honesty, you
probably won't be
experiencing such
feelings of indigna
tion and disappoint
ment when you
watch the movie ...

You'll be lucky if you can muster up
enough energy to yawn. This movie is
about as exciting as sex on prom
night; you lie there and wait for it to
stop.
