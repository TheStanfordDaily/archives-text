# OSU hopes to take advantage of bye-week
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last time Oregon State played a game after a bye
week, the Beavers waddled out of the locker room at
Reser Stadium and got devoured by a team of Washing
ton Huskies, 38-17. This weekend, the visiting underdog
is the Cardinal, and the 18 Beaver seniors playing their
last home game will want to make sure they don't get em
barrassed again.
In some ways, the situation is different.
Washington had lost its last two games and was easy
to overlook; Stanford has won its past two games and is
clearly a threat.
The Beavers hadn't lost a Pacific 10 Conference game
before Washington and may have been coasting; they
now have two tough conference losses and know they
need to win out to make the season a success.
But there are similarities to the assurances Oregon
State head coach Mike Riley gave the press before each
contest.
"It's always focused on the team you're playing,"
Riley said of his team's attitude before the Washington
game. "All I've said is, basically, don't fall into any traps
here. This game coming up has nothing to do with the
past; it's all about this one ball game."
Riley trotted out essentially the same speech this week.
"The only way we really guard against that is we talk
about it a ton that the most important game of the
year is Stanford," Riley said. "We won't feel very good
about going to the next week unless we beat Stanford."
That's especially true for senior linebacker Richard
Seigler and senior defensive tackle Dwan Edwards, two
of the team's defensive anchors, who will draw plenty of
attention in their final game in Corvallis, Ore.
"It will be very emotional," junior running back
Steven Jackson said.
But the biggest question for Oregon State fans is
whether Senior Night will also mark Jackson's last home
game. The conference's leading rusher with 124 yards
per game, Jackson will have the opportunity to turn pro
fessional after this season.
Jackson said he isn't using that possibility to motivate him
"No, I'm just treating this as my last home game of my
junior year," he said. "That's how I'm treating it, and
that's how I'm going to take it."
Still, he doesn't expect the team to come out flat like
it did against Washington.
"It's a little bit different," he said. "We know the cir
cumstances: We know we need to go 3-0 and finish out
the conference and hopefully get to eight or nine wins
and make it to the highest bowl possible."
The Beavers' chances of reaching the Rose Bowl
withered after their back-to-back losses to the Washing
ton schools, but a 52-23 pounding of
Arizona in their most recent game put
them back on the radar of other major
bowls with a 6-3 record. To play on
New Year's Day, they will need to
achieve some consistency in the sea
son's final stretch.
"It's been a good year, but kind of
an up-and-down year," Riley said.
TTie "up" has included the produc
tion of Jackson and conference-leading
wide receiver James Newson, the ag
gressive play of Seigler and defensive
end Bill Swancutt, and a four-game win
streak early in the season. In addition to
the Washington losses, the "down" has
come from a disheartening 16-14 defeat
at Fresno State and a rash of penalties
and turnovers throughout the season.
Count junior quarterback Derek An

derson in both the up and the down cate
gories. The 6-foot-6 passer from Scap
poose, Ore., leads the Pac-10 in total of
fense with 281 yards per game. But he has
also thrown more interceptions (16) than
touchdowns (15) and against Fresno
State he completed just 15 of 44 passes
and was intercepted five times.
Riley acknowledged that Ander
son's sporadic struggles have been
vexing but said he trusts his quarter
back can find a rhythm as the season
winds down.
Riley would also love to see an end
to his team's rampant penalties, which
have averaged out to a truly foul 118
yards per game.
Putting a positive spin on the bye
week may seem like a stretch, but that
didn't stop Riley from trying.
"Whoever makes the schedule,
don't do this again please," Jackson
pleaded. "As you get to rolling in the
season, you start to pick up on the pace
and start to play at a certain level. Then
you have that bye week and I think
guys get relaxed."
