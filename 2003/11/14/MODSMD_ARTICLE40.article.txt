# Tobias Wolff

### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Tobias Wolff is widely considered to be one of
the masters of the modern short story and has pro
duced a body of work that includes the classic mem
oir "This Boy's Life" (made into a film starring
Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio) and the
PEN/Falkner Award-winning novella "The Bar
racks Thief." A life-long practitioner and teacher of
the art of fiction, he has been a professor in the Eng
lish department at Stanford since 1997. He teaches
fiction writing workshops and an IHUM class, and
was a Stegner fellow here in 1975.
Wolff is currently on tour for his first novel, "Old
School." Described by Booklist as "a marvelous
novel with resonance for old and young alike," " Old
School" centers on the life of a prep-school student
trying to conform to the conventions forced upon
him. At its core, this is a novel about the obsessive
pursuit of literature and its icons. The narrator and
his friends vie for first place in an annual writing
contest in the hope of winning a private audience
with a famous visiting writer. And this is a school
preppy enough to snag Robert Frost, Ayn Rand
and Ernest Hemingway, all of whom figure as char
acters in the novel.
I had the opportunity to talk with Wolff briefly
on the phone between has engagements.
INTERMISSION: How much of the narrative in
"Old School" is derived from your personal experi
ences?
Tobias Wolff: I couldn't have written it without hav
ing gone to a school like the one I've described. A
lot of the novel is drawn from memory, but I was not
faithful to it... much has been indented to give
shape to the novel... Of course, the narrator's anx

ieties about class, identity and other issues are
things I share with him.
INT: What was it like to shift to the novel form after hav
ing spent a career writing short stories and memoirs?
TW: The one advantage of a short story is that you
can finish it before you die. I didn't [always feel the
same way] about this novel...
I like the challenge of spending two to three
months on one story, but it can be rather wear
ing. [With the novel], I enjoyed coming back to
the same world again and again. I particularly en
joyed entering the minds of the three writers
Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and Ernest Hemingway
in the novel... it involved much research and
meditation.

John Steinbeck "East of
Eden," "Of Mice and Men,"
"The Grapes of Wrath":
When you think of writing at
Stanford, you think of Steinbeck.
While at Stanford, Steinbeck chose
an independent study program in
stead of an English Major, and left
the University, before completing
his degree, in 1925 to write his first
novel, "Cup of Gold." Steinbeck
went on to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature after the publication of
"Grapes of Wrath" in 1962.
Ken Kesey "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
"Sometimes A Great No
tion": Legend has it that
Kesey wrote "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" (1962) while at
Stanford, working with chemicals,
including LSD, in army-sponsored
experiments in the psych depart
ment. He lived in a bohemian com
munity in Palo Alto, partied with the
Grateful Dead and associated with
Jack Kerouac.
Scott Turow "Presumed
Innocent," "The Burden of
Proof': In 1970, Turow came
to Stanford on an Edith Mir
relees Fellowship. When he finished
his degree, he spent three years,
teaching in the creative writing de
partment, before attending law
school at Harvard. After working as
a lawyer in Chicago, Turow spun
"legal thrillers" from real-life court
room drama. His literary adventures
in the legal profession have sold over
25 million copies.
Tom Wolfe —"A Man in
Full," "The Bonfire of the
Vanities": In 1999, Wolfe
spent three months on the
Stanford campus talking to students,
delivering speeches and gathering
research for a novel. The trademark
white-suit-wearing author, who won
the American book award in 1979
for "The Right Stuff," started his ca
reer in 1940, when he attempted a bi
ography on Napoleon and a comic
book about the life of Mozart. These
works were never finished. Instead,
Wolfe rose as a journalist, writing ar
ticles for the New York Herald Tri
bune, The Washington Post, and Es
quire. His background allowed him
to speak heartily on the subject of
journalism during his stay at Stan
ford.
Raymond Carver— -"What
We Talk About When We
Talk About Love,"
"Cathedral," "Where I'm
Calling From": Best known for his po
etry and short stories, Carver received
a Stegner Fellowship from Stanford in
1972. At the time of the release of
"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?"
in 1974, Carver was living in Palo Alto
and teaching at UC-Berkeley.
Citing novels such as "Swiss
Family Robinson," and "Franken
stein" as childhood favorites, Carver
grew up to delve into the over-arch
ing topics of life, love and philoso
phy. Frequently referred to as a
"minimalist master," Carver accom
plished the supremely difficult task
of capturing a deep and meaningful
feeling in only a few lines, displayed
most notably in "What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love:
stories." The Sunday Times chris
tened him "The American
Chekhov."

in the legal profession have sold over
25 million copies.
Tom Wolfe —"A Man in
Full," "The Bonfire of the
Vanities": In 1999, Wolfe
spent three months on the
Stanford campus talking to students,
delivering speeches and gathering
research for a novel. The trademark
white-suit-wearing author, who won
the American book award in 1979
for "The Right Stuff," started his ca
reer in 1940, when he attempted a bi
ography on Napoleon and a comic
book about the life of Mozart. These
works were never finished. Instead,
Wolfe rose as a journalist, writing ar
ticles for the New York Herald Tri
bune, The Washington Post, and Es
quire. His background allowed him
to speak heartily on the subject of
journalism during his stay at Stan
ford.
Raymond Carver— -"What
We Talk About When We
Talk About Love,"
"Cathedral," "Where I'm
Calling From": Best known for his po
etry and short stories, Carver received
a Stegner Fellowship from Stanford in
1972. At the time of the release of
"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?"
in 1974, Carver was living in Palo Alto
and teaching at UC-Berkeley.
Citing novels such as "Swiss
Family Robinson," and "Franken
stein" as childhood favorites, Carver
grew up to delve into the over-arch
ing topics of life, love and philoso
phy. Frequently referred to as a
"minimalist master," Carver accom
plished the supremely difficult task
of capturing a deep and meaningful
feeling in only a few lines, displayed
most notably in "What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love:
stories." The Sunday Times chris
tened him "The American
Chekhov."


Wolff's new novel "Old School" is also his first
Tobias Wolff is widely considered to be one of
the masters of the modern short story and has pro
duced a body of work that includes the classic mem
oir "This Boy's Life" (made into a film starring
Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio) and the
PEN/Falkner Award-winning novella "The Bar
racks Thief." A life-long practitioner and teacher of
the art of fiction, he has been a professor in the Eng
lish department at Stanford since 1997. He teaches
fiction writing workshops and an IHUM class, and
was a Stegner fellow here in 1975.
Wolff is currently on tour for his first novel, "Old
School." Described by Booklist as "a marvelous
novel with resonance for old and young alike," " Old
School" centers on the life of a prep-school student
trying to conform to the conventions forced upon
him. At its core, this is a novel about the obsessive
pursuit of literature and its icons. The narrator and
his friends vie for first place in an annual writing
contest in the hope of winning a private audience
with a famous visiting writer. And this is a school
preppy enough to snag Robert Frost, Ayn Rand
and Ernest Hemingway, all of whom figure as char
acters in the novel.
I had the opportunity to talk with Wolff briefly
on the phone between has engagements.
INTERMISSION: How much of the narrative in
"Old School" is derived from your personal experi
ences?
Tobias Wolff: I couldn't have written it without hav
ing gone to a school like the one I've described. A
lot of the novel is drawn from memory, but I was not
faithful to it... much has been indented to give
shape to the novel... Of course, the narrator's anx

ieties about class, identity and other issues are
things I share with him.
INT: What was it like to shift to the novel form after hav
ing spent a career writing short stories and memoirs?
TW: The one advantage of a short story is that you
can finish it before you die. I didn't [always feel the
same way] about this novel...
I like the challenge of spending two to three
months on one story, but it can be rather wear
ing. [With the novel], I enjoyed coming back to
the same world again and again. I particularly en
joyed entering the minds of the three writers
Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and Ernest Hemingway
in the novel... it involved much research and
meditation.

John Steinbeck "East of
Eden," "Of Mice and Men,"
"The Grapes of Wrath":
When you think of writing at
Stanford, you think of Steinbeck.
While at Stanford, Steinbeck chose
an independent study program in
stead of an English Major, and left
the University, before completing
his degree, in 1925 to write his first
novel, "Cup of Gold." Steinbeck
went on to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature after the publication of
"Grapes of Wrath" in 1962.
Ken Kesey "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
"Sometimes A Great No
tion": Legend has it that
Kesey wrote "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest" (1962) while at
Stanford, working with chemicals,
including LSD, in army-sponsored
experiments in the psych depart
ment. He lived in a bohemian com
munity in Palo Alto, partied with the
Grateful Dead and associated with
Jack Kerouac.
Scott Turow "Presumed
Innocent," "The Burden of
Proof': In 1970, Turow came
to Stanford on an Edith Mir
relees Fellowship. When he finished
his degree, he spent three years,
teaching in the creative writing de
partment, before attending law
school at Harvard. After working as
a lawyer in Chicago, Turow spun
"legal thrillers" from real-life court
room drama. His literary adventures
in the legal profession have sold over
25 million copies.
