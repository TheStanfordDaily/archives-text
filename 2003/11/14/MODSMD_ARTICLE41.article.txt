### ANTHONY HA 
"Parasites Like Us," the debut novel from Adam
Johnson, tells the story of anthropologist Hank Han
nah and his struggles after a plague wipes out most of
North America; Michiko Kakutani of The New York
Times writes that the book "announces the arrival of
a talented new writer with a wink and a flourish." The
stories in Johnson's critically-acclaimed collection
"Emporium" also take place in bleak, futuristic land
scapes and feature odd, lonely characters like a
teenage police sniper and a family that runs a bullet
proof vest rental shop.
This is Johnson's third and final year as a Jones
Teaching Fellow in creative writing at Stanford.
INTERMISSION: How did the idea for "Parasites
Like Us" develop?
ADAM JOHNSON: I was living in L.A. with my
wife, and we used to go for walks at night. We'd look
at satellites that flew by, and we would talk as if we
were living a thousand years from now. "Oh, remem
ber when the world was filled with cute little pink bun
galows? Remember when we talked on telephones
and satellites flew by in the sky?" I wanted to write a
book that was nostalgic for the present, and so I want
ed a great future perspective. And I had to make an
apocalypse happen; I had to get a vantage point from
which there'd be enough dramatic irony.
In terms of the setting, my family's from a small
town in South Dakota, which had a small, private re
ligious college. At some time in the 1980s, the school
went bankrupt, and it was bought by the Federal Bu
reau of Prisons. They turned it into the toniest mini
mum security prison on Earth...
Basically, the prisoners did gardening and lived
this nice little collegiate lifestyle. These 50-year-old
white guys hung out in their dorm rooms and played
video games and stuff. It really struck me that this was
a metaphor of our society, that this place that
should've been educating the future was instead in
carcerating the people that should have been our so
ciety's elders. I think the way that had been turned on
its ear spoke a little bit to what had happened to our
culture.
INT: There's a character named Eggers in your story,
who you poke some fun at. Is he based at all on a cer

tain other, real-life Eggers?
JOHNSON: Not at all. Characters like Gusterson
and Hannah and Eggers all came from this small
town, Yankton, S.D., or from the prison itself.
So I named this characters Eggers and I knew I'd
have to change the name later, because of Dave Eg
gers, the writer; I just figured I'd do it right before
the book was published. But I fell in love with the
name. I've exchanged e-mails with Dave Eggers;
there's no controversy.
INT: How was the transition from writing short sto
ries to writing the novel?
JOHNSON: Because you can only do so much work
in a short number of pages, the short story functions
on suggestion and withholding to a great degree. But
in the novel you have to deliver character. You can't
suggest character; you've got to really lay out some
one's life.
As far as the process for the novel goes, I like the
long-term rewards of the novel. When I was starting
the novel, people were like, "Oh dude, the novel is the
lonely marathon. Adam, the novel is the dark Everest
of the soul," you know, and everyone would tell sto
ries about other humans who had had their lives ru
ined by novels. I don't know how good the book is,
but the writing of the book makes it challenging and
rewarding daily. I loved it.

I am no stranger to writing long narratives, but
for this novel I was able to allow myself a freedom
of invention.
INT: Is there any reason why you picked Frost,
Rand and Hemingway in particular as characters
in your novel?
TW: Well yes, they represent the different [percep
tions] of writing. They were, in their own way, the
most influential writers of their time and my narra
tor, like me, was under the spell of each of those writ
ers at different times. Finally, I chose them because I
was sensitive about the question of using real people
as fictional characters and I felt comfortable doing it
with these three writers because they all used them
selves as fictional characters. They all created images
of themselves for consumption and they did that very
deliberately and with great care and so I thought I
could use them [on those terms].
INT: Over the years, has the process of writing got
ten easier or is it still as harrowing?
TW: It isn't easy. As you go on in the life of writing, you
ask more and more of yourself, so in that sense, it be
comes more difficult. But at least you know you can fin
ish something. You become a little more comfortable
with your writing and stop comparing yourself to others.

INT: I've heard you say that you started out writing
more traditional, realistic stories and at some point
switched to stories written from a skewed, futuristic
perspective.
JOHNSON: I guess fairly straightforward, realistic,
traditional stories are less satisfying to me. People say,
"Adam, your stories are crazy, they're weird, you've
got a bulletproof vest salesman, you've got a talking
robot, those things are absurd." What always seemed
absurd to me was a father who walks out on his fami
ly. What seems absurd is being a latchkey kid and
spending your entire day isolated. What seems ab
surd are people who love and need each other and
don't talk to each other. That seems completely in
sane to me and it happens every day.
INT: Of everything you've written so far, is there any
thing that strikes you as the best or the closest to your
heart?
JOHNSON: I'll say this there are different kinds
of writers. There are writers who write about them
selves, who look inward, for whom writing is a slow,
emotionally painful process. There are other writers
who write externally, who are less autobiographical;
they can write faster and more consistently. I'm more
of the former. I think all the stories I've written have
been about some aspect of my life, my family, my
story. The novel was about it all.
[But] I don't think I was prepared for the sense
of completion that came with really doing this thing,
which had been to tell my story in a slow and satis
fying way. I felt like I did it, and when I was done,
my urge to write in that same kind of way kind of
dropped off, and I wonder if I might have to become
more of that second type of writer from now on.
