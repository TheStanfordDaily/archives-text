# Stephen Elliott

As a conscientious journalist, I am tempted to do
the right thing: First introduce you to Stephen El
liott's writing career and then segue into his bizarre
and terrifying childhood. But I can't. Elliot's fiction is
so inextricably linked to his life experiences, that
nothing beats a brief Amazon.com biography byway
of introduction. Here goes:
"Stephen Elliott left home at 13 and after a year
sleeping on the roof of a convenience store on Chica
go's north side he was made a ward of the court and
channeled through various large and small group
homes and institutional learning facilities. He has
since worked as a stripper, a cabdriver, a bartender
and a marketing executive. Stephen Elliott was
awarded the 2001 Stegner Fellowship from Stanford
University, offered to emerging writers in fiction and
poetry."
Elliot is presently a lecturer at Stanford and has
published three novels and edited the anthology "Po
litically Inspired," a collection of political stories by
prominent authors.
His latest novel "Happy Baby," set for release in
February, is a chronicle of sexual abuse and its after
effects one of the most powerful chapters "Stalk
ing Mr. Grade," is about a man who stalks the person
who molested him as a child.

On how he became a writer
"I always wrote. Even when I was 10 years old, my
walls were covered in poetry that I'd written. But I
wrote to express myself and to communicate, which is
one reason for writing other people write because
they love or esteem literature. I had no intention of
becoming a writer because my father was a writer and
I didn't like my father very much. So, I was very sur
prised when people started paying me for my writing.
Then I got the Stegner here and sold a couple of
books all within a month so all of a sudden I was
making a living as a writer. Prior to that, I was just
jumping around from job to job."
On his new novel
"It comes out Feb. 19. It's called 'Happy Baby.' It's
about a person who grows up as a ward of the court
in the state of Illinois in various group homes and ju
venile learning facilities, and learns to assodate
abuse with affection. It's a very dark, very sexual
book. I wrote it while I was here as a Stegner and it's
by far the best book I've written."
On the anthology "Politically Inspired"
"The idea of 'Politically Inspired' was really born
from frustration about the political events of our
generation. I was in the middle of writing 'Happy
Baby'which deals with issues that are personal to me
and I didn't feel what I was writing was meaning
ful. I became very obsessed with politics and what I
wanted to do was create a forum to give fiction writ
ers a political voice."
On his next venture, after "Happy Baby"
"It's a campaign trail book. It's going to involve just

going on the campaign (for the 2004 presidential elec
tion) and being on the bus. The only difference is I'm
not going to worry so much about getting the facts
right and I'm going to use very extensive quotes from
unreliable sources to illuminate the candidates and
their positions. I'm going to fade in and out of fiction
... It'll be for people who want to get a generational
feel for the election."
Recommended Reading
"Tobias Wolff has just come out with one of the great
est novels I've ever read, 'Old School.' It's his first
novel and anybody who loves writing should read
that. But I also think that everybody should go
through a Charles Bukowski phase ... And of
course, you've got to read Hemingway.
"A lot of the more interesting stuff can be found in
the 'gay and lesbian' sections of the bookstores
Dennis Cooper, JT Leroy, Michelle Tea.
"David Eggers and David Foster Wallace are
going to have more of an impact on where literature
is going [than anyone else] we're currently moving
towards maximalism, exploring every tangent.
"Read some lady writers too. Because if you don't,
then people are going to call you a sexist, [laughs] I'm
kidding. Elizabeth Tallent, Michelle Tea and Sylvia
Plath are some of my favorite writers."
What's next
"All I want to do is write books. I feel like with 'Happy
Baby,' my fourth novel, I'm pretty much done with
the scrape-out-the-insides kind of writing, I've ex
ploited my experiences as far as th'ey'd go. I want to
write a detective novel. I like messing around with dif
ferent genres."
Advice for aspiring writers
"I would say, don't do it. [laughs] You're going to to
tally clutter the field and it's hard enough even for an
established writer to get published; we'd really appre
ciate it if people stopped sending submissions so that
it wasn't so difficult on the rest of us. Also, if you do
write, you should know that it's a really poor-paying
position and you get very little in response. Even
though you think that by expressing yourself, enough
people reading your work will give you a measure of
identity, self-worth, self-knowledge and reason to live
â€”none of that will happen. You'll be just as miser
able whether you're published or not published: It's
just one more thing to be miserable about. But the
misery doesn't go away, even when you start accom
plishing things. So, I would say, look for your happi
ness elsewhere. Study economics or something. And
then do volunteer work."
