# John L'Heureux
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Prof. John L'Heureux was a Jesuit for 17 years be
fore he joined the faculty at Stanford in 1973. Fitting
ly, his 17th book, "The Miracle," returns to the insti
tution of the church with an unorthodox priest as its
protagonist. The novel, which won the Gold Medal
in the Commonwealth Club of California's Califor
nia Book Award and was selected as a "Best Book of
the Year" by The New York Times and Publishers
Weekly, is now out on paperback.
L'Heureux has had a long and distinguished ca
reer he served as editor of The Atlantic Monthly
and has taught fiction to a generation of writers in
cluding Ron Hansen, Harriet Doerr and Tobias
Wolff. He is best known for the novel "A Woman
Run Mad," though his 15th novel "The Handmaid of
Desire" a satirical and biting depiction of an Eng
lish department at a Californian University set in
foothills and lined with palm-trees (ahem) —is
memorable for its trouble-making potential.
INTERMISSION: You were a priest in the Jesuit
order for a number of years. How did you decide to
become a writer?
John L'Heureux: I'd always been interested in writ
ing since childhood, as most writers are. I had a
cousin who was a very gifted painter and he inspired
me to want to paint and when I discovered I couldn't,
I decided to do the next best thing which is to try
to write. That's how I became a writer. I began by
writing stories early on and then, writing poetry in my
late teens. My first four books are books of poetry.
When I was in the Jesuits, it was possible to find time
to write poems, whereas it certainly was not possible
to find the occasion to write either a short story or a
novel. Besides, I would have felt that I was using the
confessional as a source for my fiction.

INT: What is the inspiration behind your latest novel
"The Miracle"?
JL: The inspiration for it was reflection on the situation
of the church today with the scandals of the priesthood
and how different the priesthood seemed to be at the
time I entered the Jesuits. That is to say, everyone I
knew who had dedded to enter the Jesuits did it pri
marily to offer their lives to God by offering it to their
fellow men and women. It always interested me that
somewhere along the line the notion of sanctity en
tered the equation and it struck me that it's very easy,
especially for young and idealistic people, to aspire to
sanctity because there's a glamour to it that there is not
to the priesthood. The book is about the confusion of
being a saint and being a good human being.
INT: Given that you were a priest yourself, is much
of the narrative in "The Miracle" autobiographical?
JL: It's not autobiographical at all. [laughs] I was never
handsome, I was never pursued by beautiful women

or even non-beautiful women, I was never able to play
basketball, I never could sing, unlike this young man
What is autobiographical is the spiritual urgency of the
character who's trying to be something he's not. I'm
ashamed of that, but that's how it is. [laughs]
INT: What writing process do you subscribe to?
JL: Hard work. Everyday begin at nine in the morn
ing and don't quit till you've got two pages done. At
least work until one o'clock. So two to four hours a
day, intense concentration on writing. The rest of the
day you may do research Or read and at night you
may watch a little television. But you should be
thinking about your work for tomorrow.
INT: If you were to review your own writing using a
few adjectives, what would they be?
JL: Hard, relentless, funny (I would hope), disturb
ing. That would be enough, [laughs]
INT: Who are some of your favorite writers?
JL: My age is showing here. I like Graham Greene,
Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark among the British
Among the Americans I like Bellow, Roth, Malamud.
AmongcontemporarywritersllovelanMcEwanand
most particularly, John Coetzee (2003 Nobel-prize win
ner) who's going to be here in the spring. His book "Dis
grace" is one of the great accomplishments of the century.
INT: What advice do you have for young writers?
JL: If you have to do it, then by all means go ahead.
But do it not for fame, not for money, not for psychi
atric clearance but simply to make a good thing that
didn't exist before. If you can work for that purpose
you won't be disappointed, because it's the process of
making that's fulfilling, not the reaction you get af
terwards, when some people will read it and say: "So
you wrote a book, uh uh? Well that just shows what
some people will do."

Wallace Stegner
"Where the Bluebird
Sings to the Lemonade
Springs: Living and
Writing in the West": In 1945, Steg
ner became the director of the writ
ing program at Stanford, a position
he would hold for 25 years. The year
after he retired he published his
most notable work, "Angle of Re
pose," which went on to win the
Pulitzer in 1972. As a prominent
western author loyal to Califor
nia "Angle of Repose" was not
reviewed by The New York Times,
in what was thought to be a brush
off by the eastern elite. The Stegner
Fellowship offered through the cre
ative writing department today
bears his name.
Larry McMurtry "Lone
some Dove," "Terms of
Endearment": A few years
after his Stegner fellow
ship from 1960-61 at Stanford, Mc-
Murtry went on to experience much
success with works such as "The
Last Picture Show." Basing his nov
els in the west, specifically in the
state of Texas, McMurtry used his
experiences as a cowhand to add re
alism to his prolific works.
Michael Cunningham
"The Hours": After
obtaining a degree in
English from Stanford,
Cunningham published a number of
articles in magazines such as The
New Yorker and Vogue, before
gaining public attention and Pulitzer
Prize-winning praise for his work
"The Hours." The novel won the
PEN / Faulkner award, and became
an Academy-Award winning film
starring Nicole Kidman, Julianne
Moore, and Meryl Streep.
Yikram Seth "The
Golden Gate," "A Suit
able Boy": Prolific Indi
an author and poet
Vikram Seth was trained as an econ
omist at Stanford spending, in his 1
own words, "11 years (from 1975 to
1986) not getting an economics
Ph.D." He took a year's leave from
the economics department in 1977-
78 on a Stegner fellowship and his
journeys in Tibet and China (where
he continued research for his doc
toral degree at Nanjing University in
1981) served as a basis for the
award-winning travelogue "From 1
Heaven Lake." , 1

Seth's body of work includes the
"The Golden Gate: A Novel in
Verse," praised by Gore Vidal as
"the great California novel" and "A
Suitable Boy," the longest novel in
the English language. This epic
work about a family in 1950s India
won the WH Smith Literary Award
and the Commonwealth Writers
. Prize, establishing Seth as a writer of
international repute.

INTERMISSION: You were a priest in the Jesuit
order for a number of years. How did you decide to
become a writer?
John L'Heureux: I'd always been interested in writ
ing since childhood, as most writers are. I had a
cousin who was a very gifted painter and he inspired
me to want to paint and when I discovered I couldn't,
I decided to do the next best thing which is to try
to write. That's how I became a writer. I began by
writing stories early on and then, writing poetry in my
late teens. My first four books are books of poetry.
When I was in the Jesuits, it was possible to find time
to write poems, whereas it certainly was not possible
to find the occasion to write either a short story or a
novel. Besides, I would have felt that I was using the
confessional as a source for my fiction.

INT: What is the inspiration behind your latest novel
"The Miracle"?
JL: The inspiration for it was reflection on the situation
of the church today with the scandals of the priesthood
and how different the priesthood seemed to be at the
time I entered the Jesuits. That is to say, everyone I
knew who had dedded to enter the Jesuits did it pri
marily to offer their lives to God by offering it to their
fellow men and women. It always interested me that
somewhere along the line the notion of sanctity en
tered the equation and it struck me that it's very easy,
especially for young and idealistic people, to aspire to
sanctity because there's a glamour to it that there is not
to the priesthood. The book is about the confusion of
being a saint and being a good human being.
INT: Given that you were a priest yourself, is much
of the narrative in "The Miracle" autobiographical?
JL: It's not autobiographical at all. [laughs] I was never
handsome, I was never pursued by beautiful women

or even non-beautiful women, I was never able to play
basketball, I never could sing, unlike this young man
What is autobiographical is the spiritual urgency of the
character who's trying to be something he's not. I'm
ashamed of that, but that's how it is. [laughs]
INT: What writing process do you subscribe to?
JL: Hard work. Everyday begin at nine in the morn
ing and don't quit till you've got two pages done. At
least work until one o'clock. So two to four hours a
day, intense concentration on writing. The rest of the
day you may do research Or read and at night you
may watch a little television. But you should be
thinking about your work for tomorrow.
INT: If you were to review your own writing using a
few adjectives, what would they be?
JL: Hard, relentless, funny (I would hope), disturb
ing. That would be enough, [laughs]
INT: Who are some of your favorite writers?
JL: My age is showing here. I like Graham Greene,
Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark among the British
Among the Americans I like Bellow, Roth, Malamud.
AmongcontemporarywritersllovelanMcEwanand
most particularly, John Coetzee (2003 Nobel-prize win
ner) who's going to be here in the spring. His book "Dis
grace" is one of the great accomplishments of the century.
INT: What advice do you have for young writers?
JL: If you have to do it, then by all means go ahead.
But do it not for fame, not for money, not for psychi
atric clearance but simply to make a good thing that
didn't exist before. If you can work for that purpose
you won't be disappointed, because it's the process of
making that's fulfilling, not the reaction you get af
terwards, when some people will read it and say: "So
you wrote a book, uh uh? Well that just shows what
some people will do."

ing program at Stanford, a position

most notable work, "Angle of Re
pose," which went on to win the
Pulitzer in 1972. As a prominent
western author loyal to Califor

reviewed by The New York Times,
in what was thought to be a brush
off by the eastern elite. The Stegner
Fellowship offered through the cre
ative writing department today
bears his name.
Larry McMurtry "Lone
some Dove," "Terms of
Endearment": A few years
after his Stegner fellow
ship from 1960-61 at Stanford, Mc-
Murtry went on to experience much
success with works such as "The
Last Picture Show." Basing his nov
els in the west, specifically in the
state of Texas, McMurtry used his
experiences as a cowhand to add re

the economics department in 1977-
78 on a Stegner fellowship and his
journeys in Tibet and China (where
he continued research for his doc
toral degree at Nanjing University in

award-winning travelogue "From 1
Heaven Lake." , 1

Seth's body of work includes the
"The Golden Gate: A Novel in
Verse," praised by Gore Vidal as
"the great California novel" and "A
Suitable Boy," the longest novel in
the English language. This epic
work about a family in 1950s India
won the WH Smith Literary Award
and the Commonwealth Writers
. Prize, establishing Seth as a writer of
international repute.
