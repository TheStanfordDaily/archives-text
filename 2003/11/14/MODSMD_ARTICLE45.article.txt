# Adams rolls out rockier sound, cockier attitude
## 
### MACKENZIE COOPER 
When I learned that Ryan
Adams' album was titled "Rock 'N'
Roll," I had to laugh. This is a man
known for his "alt-country" music,
who once formed a group called the
Patty Duke Syndrome: He's no
more "rock and roll" than Match
box 20's Rob Thomas. His last
album was full of country flavor.
How could he possibly pull off any
sort of real rock?
But he's clearly brushed over the
country influences in favor of more,
well, rock 'n' roll influences. Bruce
Springsteen comes to mind during
"Do Miss America," and the
Rolling Stones are übiquitous, es
pecially on tracks like "Shallow"
and "1974." Previous Ryan Adams
albums had guest appearances from
country superstars like Emmylou
Harris; "Rock 'N' Roll" features
Melissa Auf Der Maur, a former
Hole and Smashing Pumpkins
bassist, actress Parker Posey and
Greenday's Billie Joe Armstrong
all singing backup vocals.
I can't decide if it was a con
scious decision to change his image,
or if his music evolved and his
image came along for the ride, but
it's clear that he is no longer the
soft-spoken alt-country star I once
supposed he was. Adams' lyrics are
forthright and his music is louder
and more imposing. Ryan Adams
has an attitude and he wants you to

know. On "1974," his voice adopts
an inflection half way between
Mick Jagger and AC / DC lead
singer Dave Evans, quite a change
from the sad, romantic vocals from
tracks like "Sylvia Plath" on his last
album "Gold."
Adams' most recent album is
much less poppy than past albums

and pictures in the booklet show
Adams looking his most rock, ciga
rette between his lips and tattoos
bared. Remember "New York,
New York," the semi-hit that had
everyone waving American flags
and praising New York cops and
firefighters back in September of
2001? You won't find that sort of

pop complicity on this album. The
closest you'll get is "Burning Pho
tographs," one of the slower songs
on the album, in which Adams'
voice reverts to its country roots
and mimics the more upbeat songs
from "Gold."
The standout song of the album,
"So Alive," is a sweet and slightly
softer song, in which Adams' vocals
reach a new level and range of emo
tion. I was surprised to hear songs
like "Note to Self: Don't Die," a
hard rock, almost screechy track
about not changing for anyone
("don't change, just lie"), alongside
songs like "So Alive," but I guess
the juxtaposition reflects Adams'
personality. Even his website re
flects the semi-schizophrenic na
ture of his album and his new per
sonality: He first claims to be "a
threat to all Mankind and all living
things," and then says "he loves
most everybody and does not want
to start any more trouble." His
album is the manifestation of these
paradigmatic beliefs. He's an in
your-face rock star and a subtle
country man all at once.
True rock fans need not fear the
"country" side of Ryan Adams in
"Rock 'N' Roll," for it's been flaw
lessly melded with Adams' rock in
fluences. And fans of Adams' earli
er work will most likely appreciate
the newly infused alt-country-rock
he perfects on this album.
