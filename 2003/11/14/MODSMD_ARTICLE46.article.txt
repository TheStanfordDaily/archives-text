# Don't evade the IRS

### MARCEL SOLORZANO 
Hip-hop has seen its share of space
traveling, alien-sounding, futuristic
themed albums that disappear off the map
quicker than the UFO that your uncle
claims he saw. One of the most successful
of these was Outkast's second album,
"ATLiens," which displayed the audio ex
perimentation abilities that they are now
famous for. IRS, in their debut album
"Welcome to Planet IRS," is all about try
ing new sounds and techniques.

The "Planet" isn't in outer space at all, but instead it's a reference to Scar
borough Canada, proclaimed as one of the most multicultural cities in the
world. Home to a large Caribbean population, the influences of these cul
tures seeps into the IRS sound. On top of that, add the fact that Black Cat
(half of the emcee equation), is accomplished at several instruments, DJ

T.R.A.C.K.S has been making beats for the 15 member Monolith crew for
years, and that Black Cat and Deez (the other half), have been trading
rhymes since they were in high school.
Heads in Canada have been tuned into IRS for over three years now and
this album's release is due to their demand for more from the group. In 2000,
they released a 12-inch that forced them into the forefronts of the Canadian
hip-hop scene, performing live with Kardinal Offishall and recording collab
orations with many other artists. "Welcome to Planet IRS" is the culmina
tion of their efforts since that point.
The album begins with an eerie spaceship countdown, and then a jumble
of sounds: guitar riffs, DJ scratching and cuts, the beginnings of drum tracks.
None of it sounds in unison, but once Black Cat starts rhyming and the beat
drops, everything clicks and moves forward together. This proves to be one
of IRS' most skilled maneuvers: As the record progresses, they are able to
adeptly combine a variety of different sounds track after track.
The emcees also manipulate their styles to match the song, as
T.R.A.C.K.S. relates, "We don't have any one specific sound or any pre
dictable flows or rhymes and that messes with people's heads." You can hear
the delivery style of Busta Rhymes on one rap, and then Black Eyed Peas on
the next.
One of the best songs on the album is "Munyam Jam," which is placed in

the middle of the album as the "Bunnin
Break." It proves to be one of the more
memorable smoking interludes in a genre
full of these necessary breaks. The beat is
controlled to vary in intensity according to
the inhalations and exhalations of the em
cees and once they get into a flow these two
really can bust.
"Welcome to Planet IRS" is a fresh blast
of creativity to an industry stale with
overused ideas. There is a lot to listen to, and
it's one of those albums that get better the

more times you listen to it because you begin catching more. However, it is
not for people looking for something to blast from their trunk or for the next
big thing on the radio. In their debut album IRS shows that they have a lot of
ideas and the skills to work them in their music. Watch for them to drop a
classic in the near future.
