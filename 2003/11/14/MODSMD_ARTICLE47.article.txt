### MERRITT FORREST BAER 
Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece comes
to life in this compelling and sophisticated
production of "A Little Night Music." Not
without flaws, the show propels its audience
deep into the summer night. Loosely based
on Ingmar Bergman's film "Smiles of a Sum
mer Night" this beloved musical adaptation
is currently being transferred from the
Mountain View Center to the Post Street
Theater in San Francisco.
The story line is complex and intriguing:
A trio of lovers see their lives change when
they meet for a weekend in the country.

Seen through the eyes of
a 15-year-old girl, the
true star of this produc
tion is Sondheim's score.
Filled with innuendo
and subde sarcasm, it's
easy to see where the
roots for "Into the
Woods" began to grow

in his mind. The entire score is written in 3/4
time (or some multiple thereof) which brings
to mind waltzes, mazurkas, gallops, etc. This
brisk music adds to the stylized effect of the
production on a whole.
Director Robert Kelley, a Stanford gradu
ate, sets this production in 1913 and makes
the most of this chronological shift from the
late 19th century. Tom Langguth's sets and
screens are a beautiful homage to the art
deco period and Mannshardt's lighting is
particularly attractive. By the end of the
evening, it's obvious that the design team
worked exceptionally well together. The 12-

piece orchestra succeeds brilliantly in high
lighting the nuances of the score. However,
the performances don't always hold up their
end of the collaboration.
Charlotte Cornwell as Desiree, who seems
a tad old for this role, brings her acting chops
from London's Royal National Theatre, but
her singing is less than satisfactory. The fa
mous ballad "Send in the Clowns," is only ac
ceptable due to Cornwell's fine acting. The
charming Lianne Marie Dobbs plays a fine
Anne, but she is nothing groundbreaking.
The same is true for Carmichael Blanken
ship as Carl-Magnus, who seems more suit
able for Coalhouse in "Ragtime" than this
period piece. Stanley Bahorek has an in

credible tenor voice;
however, his nerdy
portrayal of Henrik
comes off as forced.
Unfortunately, the
show does drag due to
the poor casting of
Norma Hughes as

Madame Armfeldt (De
siree's mother). Her performance lacks any
motivation or passion. Her song is dull and
the audience is only grateful upon her death,
which also lacks any realism.
Sondheim's score and Wheeler's book do
shine when graced by three seasoned pro
fessionals: Allan Fitzpatrick, Annmarie Mar
tin and Margaret Nichols. Fitzpatrick play
ing Fredrik brings his Broadway skills to the
rescue. His performance of "You Must Meet
My Wife" is particularly touching. He works
quite well with Cornwell to create a believ
able romance. Martin as Charlotte (only dur
ing the Mountain View extension) gives a

bold and daring performance. She stands
out in every scene and sings a moving rendi
tion of "Every Day a Little Death." Mean
while, Nichols' Petra is fierce and seductive.
Her 11 o'clock number, "The Miller's Son,"
is rousing and thrilling. These three actors
grace "A Little Night Music" with a perfor
mance it truly deserves.
Kelly's ensemble (including 2003 Stan
ford graduate Sean Fenton) is vocally su
perb. However, their choreography is static
and rather repetitive. The only character to
get around this is Frid, played by Tarek

Khan, whose intensity and presence are felt
even just standing as a simple servant. The
one company number that truly glows is the
first act finale "Weekend in the Country."
However, the second act finale seems con
trived as it ends too perfectly, with little bows
on the sides.
This "Night Music" may not always soar,
but it shines in many moments. The produc
tion certainly gives hope for the future of re
gional theater in the Bay Area.



"What's wrong? It's just a little night music."
