# An A-Mraz-ing Event
## 
### JIMMY LIN 
Although Monday night's concert in
MemAud was Jason Mraz's seventh stage
performance in six days, he was not even
close to being burned out. The show was
filled with so much energy and spirit that it
was impossible to take your eyes off the
stage. Jason's voice so powerful and
with such an incredible range was the
star of the show. And Monday night, the
star did not disappoint.
Like The Dave Matthews Band, Jason
Mraz likes to mix things up by making sure
every concert is different. Monday's setlist
was a great mix of old classics, fan fa
vorites and songs off his album, "Waiting
For My Rocket To Come." He opened
with a jazzed up version of "Common
Pleasure" that immediately brought
everyone to their feet. He followed it with
the dating anthem "I'll Do Anything" and
decided to include in the song the cell
phone number of Toca, his percussionist.
This originally started out as a joke but has
since then turned into an amusing stage
antic. And yes, it really is Toca's number.
The crowd was practically begging for
Jason to play "0% Interest" and "Dream
life of Rand McNally," but unfortunately
it didn't happen. However, he did honor
one request when he performed a moving
rendition of "After An Afternoon," imme
diately followed by the equally touching

song "Sleeping The Dream." These two
songs definitely showed the audience how
soothing yet gripping Jason's voice can be.
In addition, they were a welcome gift to
those who had attended his concert at The
Warfield two days earlier and were hoping
to hear more of his slower songs.
Other highlights of the evening includ
ed a performance of "Right Kind of
Phrase" in which Mraz had the audience
sing along with him in a language he im
provised on the spot. He also brought back
childhood memories when he performed a
cover of the Muppets ballad "Rainbow
Connection" during his encore.
The night also had its share of humor
ous moments. When Mraz was introducing
Toca, he mentioned that he was audition
ing for "The Vagina Monologues." Later
on, when someone shouted out a request
for the song "10,000 Motherfâ€”ers," Mraz
nonchalantly replied, "Hey, watch your
mouth!" The best part though, was when
Mraz called Sigma Nu the "Sigma Freaks."
While many concert-goers were brand
new to Jason and his music, the show un
doubtedly earned Mraz a host of new fans.
Unlike many musicians, Mraz knows how
to connect with the audience when he's
performing, and can immediately capti
vate them with his commanding stage
presence. Mraz possesses an allure that
makes one want to listen to him for hours.
