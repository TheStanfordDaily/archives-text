# Drama department presents fantastic 'Flea' circus

### ALICE KIM STAFF WRITER 
First things first: "One Flea Spare" was more
perverse and exhilarating than being horse
whipped by a Weimar-era prostitute. I don't
know theater, you see. I was expecting to be
tastefully bored and then to leave after yawning
my way through various monologues about
leaves falling from trees. Slowly.
But I had fun! I was shocked! Moved!
Grossed-out! "One Flea Spare" by Naomi Wal
lace takes place during the Great Plague of 1665
in London. In possibly the most psychologically
spicy situation EVER, a sly servant holds a
wealthy couple prisoner, along with two vagrants
trapped with them, in two small rooms.
Kabe the servant (Misan Re wane), is the only

source of supplies and news for the people quar
antined inside. He is a true opportunist ramp
ing up prices, baiting the wealthy couple at every
opportunity and even demanding sexual favors
for treats.
The wealthy couple, a.k.a. the Snelgraves
(Kendra Arimoto and Aaron Kabaker), have a
calm, sexless relationship, which is quickly
thrown into disarray by the two vagrants trapped
with them. Bunce (Chris Babson) is a virile sailor
who seems to tempt both the Snelgraves into sin.
Morse (Jennifer Carr) is a precocious, menacing
young girl who creates tension between every
one else, while also serving as a guide into this
world.
Among other things, advertisements for
"One Flea Spare" promise imprisonment, seduc
tion and strange penetrations. They did not he.

There is urine, blood and spit. There is despera
tion, death and strange sex. But the play is more
than just a sum of its shocking moments.
"One Flea Spare" explores many topics in
depth, including death, class, disease and sex. In
a particularly telling moment of the play, Mr.
Snelgrave allows Bunce to try on his fine leather
shoes, relishing the fact that he has total control
over the situation. There are many more scenes
like this all boundaries disappear as everyone
becomes antsy with cabin fever and sexual ten
sion.
The acting is great all around. Kendra Ari
moto's Mrs. Snelgrave is all stiff upper lip and
boiling repression, until circumstances force her
to let go of her reserve. Aaron Kabaker's Mr.
Snelgrave is a classic pompous jerk, often conde
scending, full of rage and desperation. Chris

Babson channels a mean Russell Crowe as
Bunce, who serves as a sort of fantasy figure for
the Snelgraves while remaining stubbornly hon
orable. Jennifer Carr, as Morse, is convincing
and disturbing as a child who has seen and expe
rienced too much. Finally, Kabe, played by
Misan Rewane, is terrific dirty bastard com
pletely at ease with being coarsely black-hearted.
"One Flea Spare" was 10 billion times bet
ter than the TV show "Friends," which basi
cally has the same premise, minus the Black
Plague and aristocracy. (Two
apartment/rooms? Rampant sexual tension?)
So instead of settling into your futon groove
with a hand on the remote, try seeing "One
Flea Spare." Contrary to my expectations, I
found it fascinatingly kinky and quite moving.
Trust me, it'll blow your mindhole.
