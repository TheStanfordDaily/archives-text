# SF Film Society offers taste of Italy
## 
### 
Next week, the San Francisco Film Society is putting on a New Italian
Cinema film series. The event runs from Nov. 16-23 at the AMC Kabuki the
ater off Fillmore Street in San Francisco.
Every spring, the Film Society puts on the International Film Festival, a
pretty killer event for San Francisco to have, which gets an impressive line
up of indie and international films together (see The Daily's coverage of last
year's event in the archives online).
This Italian cinema event is a little different; it's small and focuses on con
temporary Italian cinema. The impetus for such an event comes from the
feeling in the film world that the great days of Italian cinema (the 50s,
60s and 70s, with directors like Vittorio De Sica, the assassinated Pier Paolo
Pasolini and Federico Fellini) are past.
The film series is screening 10 films, including two tribute screenings to
director Francesca Archibugi. The other films were selected from Italian
films that were screened in this year's European film festivals (Berlin,
Venice, etc.). Most of the films will also be preceded by Italian film shorts.
A few highlights:
"I Am Emma" ("Emma Sono Io") more or less a comedy about a
group of friends and family preparing for a wedding, when their dear friend
Emma forgets her Lithium (an anti-depressant). It's a fairly funny and well
done look into contemporary Italian social relations.
"Pater Familias" a pretty heavy, but at times quite beautiful, film
about a young Italian man granted leave from prison to visit his dying father.
Be prepared for some jerky, but emotionally compelling, flashbacks.
Showtimes and summaries of all the films are on the Film Society's Web site
(www.sffs.org).
