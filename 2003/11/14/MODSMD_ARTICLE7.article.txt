## Early applicant numbers soar 
### By: SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The number of early applicants to Stanford
surged by a record 62 percent this year, according
to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Rough
ly 4,000 students applied under the University's
new "single-choice early action" admissions policy,
which replaced the early decision program this
year.
"The fact that we've received over 1,500 more
applications than last year suggests that our new
single-choice early action option more closely
matches the needs and desires of our applicant
pool than did our old early decision program,"
said Dean of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet.
Stanford's "single-choice early action" admissions*
policy allows students to leam their admission deci
sion early, in December, but gives students the option
to wait until May to commit to a school. Stanford pre
viously had an early decision policy, under which stu
dents could apply early only to Stanford with binding
commitment to the school, requiring students to at
tend. With the new policy, students are still only al
lowed to apply to one school early, unlike other early
action programs where students can apply to other
early action, decision or notification programs.
"This new policy offers those who have set their
hearts on attending Stanford the opportunity to
apply early in their senior year without the addi
tional pressure of having to commit before they are
ready," said University President John Hennessy
last year, when the new policy was announced.
Harvard, which switched to a stricter early ad
missions policy, experienced a 47 percent drop in
early applicants, to 4,000 matching Stanford's
number of applications. Harvard switched to the
single-choice early action policy after using an early
action policy last year that allowed students to
apply early to multiple schools.
"Last year we heard about students firing off a
range of early applications without doing much
homework about where they really wanted to go,"
said Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid William R. Fitzsimmons to The New York
Times. "In the long run, we think this is going to be
the best answer for a sane and comfortable admis
sions process."
Yale, which also switched to the single-choice
early action policy this year, witnessed an increase
of 42 percent in its applicant pool, receiving 3,700
applications.
The increase in applications at Stanford and
Yale seemed to come at the expense of other
schools like Princeton and MIT. Princeton, which is
still using a binding early decision program, saw its
number of early applicants drop 23 percent. MIT,
which still has a liberal early action program that al
lows students to apply to multiple schools early,

witnessed a 22 percent decrease.
"The most interesting aspect of this increase is
that more students are saying that Stanford is their
first choice," Mamlet said. "But although we have
received more early applications, we expect our
total number of applications to hold steady at
roughly 20,000."
Mamlet said she did not notice any changes in
the strength of the applicant pool. However, the
soaring number of applications means that the ad
missions office is busier than ever.
"We've hired a few more part-time readers, and
we are all working very hard," Mamlet said.
Students said they understand the popularity of
the new admissions policy.
"I would have applied to Stanford early if this
policy had been in place two years ago," said sopho
more Maneesh Singh. "At the time, I didn't know
what school I wanted to go to. But this way, I would
have found out early if I got accepted, and I
wouldn't have been obligated to come."
Other early decision schools saw little change
this year, according to The New York Times, with
the University of Pennsylvania receiving the same
number of early applications, applications to
Brown and Cornell increasing by 1 percent and Co
lumbia applications decreasing by 1 percent. At the
University of Chicago, which switched from early
action to single-choice early action this year, appli
cations fell 17 percent.
