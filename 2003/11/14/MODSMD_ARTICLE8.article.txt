# A 						little Stanford admissions history
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford is one of the most selective univer
sities in the country — in 2002, 12 percent of
Stanford applicants were admitted. But that has
not always been the case; in the 19405, 83 per
cent of applicants who paid a $5 fee and proper
ly filled out an application were admitted to the
University, according to Associate Dean and
Director of Admission Emeritus John Bunnell,
who spoke yesterday about the history of the
University's undergraduate admissions process.
Bunnell, membership chair of the Stanford
Historical Society, also said that applications to
Stanford have multiplied nine times in the last
50 years, from 2,020 applicants in 1951 to 18,599
in 2001. In 1978, nearly one in four of all 10,000
applicants were accepted to fill a class ranging
from 1,550 to 1,650 students. Now, fewer than
one in seven of the nearly 19,000 applicants are
usually accepted to fill a class of that size. Ap
plications have nearly doubled in the last 25
years, but the number of students admitted has

remained the same, causing the admit rate to
drop by almost half.
Stanford's yield, the number of admitted stu
dents who decide to matriculate, has hovered in
recent years around 70 percent, though various
external factors have weakened the yield in
some years, such as the Loma Prieta earthquake
and lower rankings in U.S. News & World Re
port's college guide. Bunnell said that in the
early 19905, one father even requested a refund
of the application fee because Stanford had fall
en to the third position in the U.S. News &
World Report rankings.
Although there is great diversity among ad
mitted students, one thing that unites all of them
is their ability to spell "Stanford" correctly; this
has been an unofficial, unspoken requirement,
according to Bunnell. Students who were re
jected during Bunnell's time in the admissions
office have sent applications to: "Stamford,
Standford, Satanford (that application arrived
on Halloween, ironically), die University of
California at Stanford, USC (University of
Stanford, California) and Mr. Stan Ford."
Other admissions standards have
changed a bit in the last century. In 1892,
applicants were required to possess certifi
cates or pass exams in English and nine out
of 25 fields. For the English exams, stu
dents had to answer six out of seven ques
tions— for example, "Quote five lines
from Julius Caesar." Admissions
requirements changed greatly over the
next 50 years. In 1948, prospective stu
dents were evaluated on the basis of three
factors: high school grade point average,
SAT score and personal qualifications for
work at Stanford as shown by applications
and credentials. Students were required to
have taken 11 units of "recommended
quality" in the last three years of high
school and 15 units of "passing quality" in
all four years of high school.
Standards in the last 50 years have not
changed significantly.
"The primary criterion for admission to
Stanford is academic excellence, and the
most important single credential is the
high school transcript," according to this
year's viewbook. "In addition to academic
excellence, we are interested in students

who have made significant contributions
to the life of their school or community."
There is no longer a required curricu
lum to gain admission to the University,
but students are expected to take "the
most challenging courses available to them
in a broad, liberal arts program."
Another change in Stanford admissions
relates to gender. When the University
was founded in 1891, 25 percent of enter
ing freshmen were women. That number
steadily rose to 40 percent by 1899, when
Jane Stanford imposed a limit of 500
women on entering classes because she felt
the University, built in memorial to her de
ceased son, should not have too many
women. That limit was changed in the
1950s to 40 percent. In 1972, the quota was
eliminated so that men and women be
came evaluated on the basis of merit, not
gender. The classes admitted since 1972
have included roughly the same number of
men and women.
In some years, there have been slight
discrepancies.
"Last year, the admit rate was 14 per
cent for women and 13 percent for men,"
Bunnell said.
However, Bunnell also said that admis
sions officers are not infallible. One year,
two out of the three Rhodes Scholars at
Stanford had been admitted here as trans
fers after their freshman applications were
initially rejected.

ing freshmen were women. That number
steadily rose to 40 percent by 1899, when
Jane Stanford imposed a limit of 500
women on entering classes because she felt
the University, built in memorial to her de
ceased son, should not have too many
women. That limit was changed in the
1950s to 40 percent. In 1972, the quota was
eliminated so that men and women be
came evaluated on the basis of merit, not
gender. The classes admitted since 1972
have included roughly the same number of
men and women.
In some years, there have been slight
discrepancies.
"Last year, the admit rate was 14 per
cent for women and 13 percent for men,"
Bunnell said.
However, Bunnell also said that admis
sions officers are not infallible. One year,
two out of the three Rhodes Scholars at
Stanford had been admitted here as trans
fers after their freshman applications were
initially rejected.
