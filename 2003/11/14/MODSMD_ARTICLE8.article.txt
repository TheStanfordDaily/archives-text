Stanford is one of the most selective univer
sities in the country â€” in 2002, 12 percent of
Stanford applicants were admitted. But that has
not always been the case; in the 19405, 83 per
cent of applicants who paid a $5 fee and proper
ly filled out an application were admitted to the
University, according to Associate Dean and
Director of Admission Emeritus John Bunnell,
who spoke yesterday about the history of the
University's undergraduate admissions process.
Bunnell, membership chair of the Stanford
Historical Society, also said that applications to
Stanford have multiplied nine times in the last
50 years, from 2,020 applicants in 1951 to 18,599
in 2001. In 1978, nearly one in four of all 10,000
applicants were accepted to fill a class ranging
from 1,550 to 1,650 students. Now, fewer than
one in seven of the nearly 19,000 applicants are
usually accepted to fill a class of that size. Ap
plications have nearly doubled in the last 25
years, but the number of students admitted has

remained the same, causing the admit rate to
drop by almost half.
Stanford's yield, the number of admitted stu
dents who decide to matriculate, has hovered in
recent years around 70 percent, though various
external factors have weakened the yield in
some years, such as the Loma Prieta earthquake
and lower rankings in U.S. News & World Re
port's college guide. Bunnell said that in the
early 19905, one father even requested a refund
of the application fee because Stanford had fall
en to the third position in the U.S. News &
World Report rankings.
Although there is great diversity among ad
mitted students, one thing that unites all of them
is their ability to spell "Stanford" correctly; this
has been an unofficial, unspoken requirement,
according to Bunnell. Students who were re
jected during Bunnell's time in the admissions
office have sent applications to: "Stamford,
Standford, Satanford (that application arrived
on Halloween, ironically), die University of
